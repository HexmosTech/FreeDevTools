       Fuse - write filesystems in Perl using FUSE

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Fuse;

         Fuse::main(
             mountpoint =&gt; '/mnt/my_fs',
             threaded   =&gt; 0,
             debug      =&gt; 1,

             getattr    =&gt; sub { ... }, # fetches attributes, like 'stat'
             getdir     =&gt; sub { ... }, # obtains directory listings
             open       =&gt; sub { ... }, # opens files
             statfs     =&gt; sub { ... }, # returns filesystem data
             read       =&gt; sub { ... }, # reads file contents

             # there are many more you can implement!
             # See "FUNCTIONS YOUR FILESYSTEM MAY IMPLEMENT" below.
         );

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module lets you implement filesystems in Perl, through the FUSE &lt;<a href="http://fuse.sourceforge.net">http://fuse.sourceforge.net</a>&gt;
       (Filesystem in USErspace) kernel/lib interface.

       FUSE expects you to implement callbacks for the various functions.

       In the following definitions, "errno" can be 0 (for a success), -EINVAL, -ENOENT, -EONFIRE, any integer
       less than 1 really.

       You can import standard error constants by saying something like:

           use POSIX qw(EDOTDOT ENOANO);

       Every constant you need (file types, <b>open()</b> flags, error values, etc) can be imported either from POSIX
       or from Fcntl, often both.  See their respective documentations, for more information.

   <b>EXPORTED</b> <b>SYMBOLS</b>
       None by default.

       You can request all exportable symbols by using the tag ":all".

       You can request the extended attribute symbols by using the tag ":xattr".  This will export XATTR_CREATE
       and XATTR_REPLACE.

   <b>FUNCTIONS</b>
       <u>Fuse::main</u>

       Takes arguments in the form of hash key=&gt;value pairs.  There are many valid keys.  Most of them
       correspond with names of callback functions, as described in section 'FUNCTIONS YOUR FILESYSTEM MAY
       IMPLEMENT'.  A few special keys also exist:

       debug =&gt; boolean
        This turns FUSE call tracing on and off.  Default is 0 (which means off).

       mountpoint =&gt; string
        The  point  at  which to mount this filesystem.  There is no default, you must specify this.  An example
        would be '<a href="file:/mnt">/mnt</a>'.

       mountopts =&gt; string
        This is a comma separated list of mount options to pass to the FUSE kernel module.

        At present, it allows the  specification  of  the  allow_other  argument  when  mounting  the  new  FUSE
        filesystem.  To  use  this,  you  will  also  need  'user_allow_other' in <a href="file:/etc/fuse.conf">/etc/fuse.conf</a> as per the FUSE
        documentation

          mountopts =&gt; "allow_other" or
          mountopts =&gt; ""

       threaded =&gt; boolean
        This turns FUSE multithreading on and off.  The default is 0, meaning  your  FUSE  script  will  run  in
        single-threaded  mode.   Note that single-threaded mode also means that you will not have to worry about
        reentrancy, though you will have to worry about recursive lookups.  In single-threaded mode, FUSE  holds
        a global lock on your filesystem, and will wait for one callback to return before calling another.  This
        can lead to deadlocks, if your script makes any attempt to access files or directories in the filesystem
        it  is  providing.   (This  includes  calling  <b>stat()</b>  on  the mount-point, <b>statfs()</b> calls from the 'df'
        command, and so on and so forth.)  It is worth paying a little attention and being careful about this.

        Enabling multithreading will cause FUSE to make multiple simultaneous calls into  the  various  callback
        functions  of  your  perl script.  If you enable threaded mode, you can enjoy all the parallel execution
        and interactive response benefits of threads, and you get to enjoy all the benefits of  race  conditions
        and locking bugs, too.  Please also ensure any other perl modules you're using are also thread-safe.

        (If  enabled, this option will cause a warning if your perl interpreter was not built with USE_ITHREADS,
        or if you have failed to use threads or threads::shared.)

       nullpath_ok =&gt; boolean
        This flag tells Fuse to not pass paths for functions that operate on file  or  directory  handles.  This
        will  yield  empty  path parameters for functions including read, write, flush, release, fsync, readdir,
        releasedir, fsyncdir, truncate, fgetattr and lock. If you  use  this,  you  must  return  file/directory
        handles  from  open,  opendir  and  create. Default is 0 (off).  Only effective on Fuse 2.8 and up; with
        earlier versions, this does nothing.

       utimens_as_array =&gt; boolean
        This flag causes timestamps passed via the <b>utimens()</b> call to be passed as arrays containing the time  in
        seconds,  and  a  second  value containing the number of nanoseconds, instead of a floating point value.
        This allows for more precise times, as the normal floating  point  type  used  by  Perl  (double)  loses
        accuracy starting at about tenths of a microsecond.

       nopath =&gt; boolean
        Flag indicating that the path need not be calculated for the following operations:

        read,  write, flush, release, fsync, readdir, releasedir, fsyncdir, ftruncate, fgetattr, lock, ioctl and
        poll

        Closely related to nullpath_ok, but if this flag is set then the path will not be calculated even if the
        file wasn't unlinked. However the path can still be defined if it needs to be calculated for some  other
        reason.

        Only effective on Fuse 2.9 and up.

       utime_omit_ok =&gt; boolean
        Flag  indicating  that  the  filesystem accepts special UTIME_NOW and UTIME_OMIT values in its "utimens"
        operation.

        If you wish to use these constants, make sure to include the  ':utime'  flag  when  including  the  Fuse
        module, or the ':all' flag.

        Only effective on Fuse 2.9 and up.

       <u>Fuse::fuse_get_context</u>

        use Fuse 'fuse_get_context';

        my $caller_uid = fuse_get_context()-&gt;{uid};
        my $caller_gid = fuse_get_context()-&gt;{gid};
        my $caller_pid = fuse_get_context()-&gt;{pid};

       Access context information about the current Fuse operation.

       <u>Fuse::fuse_version</u>

       Indicates the Fuse version in use; more accurately, indicates the version of the Fuse API in use at build
       time.  If  called  in scalar context, the version will be returned as a decimal value; i.e., for Fuse API
       v2.6, will return "2.6". If called in array context, an array will be  returned,  containing  the  major,
       minor and micro version numbers of the Fuse API it was built against.

       <u>Fuse::fuse_buf_size</u>

       Computes the total size of a buffer vector. Applicable for "read_buf" and "write_buf" operations.

       <u>Fuse::fuse_buf_copy</u>

       Copies  data  from  one  buffer vector to another. Primarily useful if a buffer vector contains multiple,
       fragmented chunks or if it contains an FD buffer instead of a memory buffer. Applicable for "write_buf".

       <u>Fuse::notify_poll</u>

       Only available if the Fuse module is built against libfuse 2.8 or later.  Use <b>fuse_version()</b> to determine
       if this is the case. Calling this function  with  a  pollhandle  argument  (as  provided  to  the  "poll"
       operation   implementation)  will  send  a  notification  to  the  caller  <b>poll()</b>ing  for  I/O  operation
       availability. If more than one pollhandle is provided for the same filehandle, only use the  latest;  you
       *can* send notifications to them all, but it is unnecessary and decreases performance.

       ONLY  supply poll handles fed to you through "poll" to this function.  Due to thread safety requirements,
       we can't currently package the pointer up in an object the way we'd like to to  prevent  this  situation,
       but  your  filesystem server program may segfault, or worse, if you feed things to this function which it
       is not supposed to receive. If you do anyway, we take no responsibility for whatever Bad  Things(tm)  may
       happen.

       <u>Fuse::pollhandle_destroy</u>

       Only available if the Fuse module is built against libfuse 2.8 or later.  Use <b>fuse_version()</b> to determine
       if  this is the case. This function destroys a poll handle (fed to your program through "poll"). When you
       are done with a poll handle, either because it has been replaced, or because a notification has been sent
       to it, pass it to this function to dispose of it safely.

       ONLY supply poll handles fed to you through "poll" to this function.  Due to thread safety  requirements,
       we  can't  currently  package the pointer up in an object the way we'd like to to prevent this situation,
       but your filesystem server program may segfault, or worse, if you feed things to this function  which  it
       is  not  supposed to receive. If you do anyway, we take no responsibility for whatever Bad Things(tm) may
       happen.

   <b>FUNCTIONS</b> <b>YOUR</b> <b>FILESYSTEM</b> <b>MAY</b> <b>IMPLEMENT</b>
       <u>getattr</u>

       Arguments:  filename.

       Returns a list, very similar to the 'stat' function (see perlfunc).  On error,  simply  return  a  single
       numeric scalar value (e.g. "return -<b>ENOENT()</b>;").

       FIXME:  the  "ino"  field  is  currently  ignored.   I  tried setting it to 0 in an example script, which
       consistently caused segfaults.

       Fields (the following was stolen from <b><a href="../man1/perlfunc.1.html">perlfunc</a></b>(1) with apologies):

           (
            $dev, $ino, $mode, $nlink, $uid, $gid, $rdev, $size,
            $atime, $mtime, $ctime, $blksize, $blocks
           ) = getattr($filename);

       Here are the meaning of the fields:

        0 dev      device number of filesystem
        1 ino      inode number
        2 mode     file mode  (type and permissions)
        3 nlink    number of (hard) links to the file
        4 uid      numeric user ID of file's owner
        5 gid      numeric group ID of file's owner
        6 rdev     the device identifier (special files only)
        7 size     total size of file, in bytes
        8 atime    last access time in seconds since the epoch
        9 mtime    last modify time in seconds since the epoch
       10 ctime    inode change time (NOT creation time!) in seconds
                   since the epoch
       11 blksize  preferred block size for file system I/O
       12 blocks   actual number of blocks allocated

       (The epoch was at 00:00 January 1, 1970 GMT.)

       If you wish to provide sub-second precision timestamps, they may be passed either as the fractional  part
       of  a  floating-point  value,  or  as a two-element array, passed as an array ref, with the first element
       containing the number of seconds since the epoch, and the second containing the  number  of  nanoseconds.
       This  provides  complete  time  precision,  as a floating point number starts losing precision at about a
       tenth of a microsecond. So if you really care about that sort of thing...

       <u>readlink</u>

       Arguments:  link pathname.

       Returns a scalar: either a numeric constant, or a text string.

       This is called when dereferencing symbolic links, to learn the target.

       example rv: return "/proc/self/fd/stdin";

       <u>getdir</u>

       Arguments:  Containing directory name.

       Returns a list: 0 or more text strings (the filenames), followed by a numeric errno (usually 0).

       This is used to obtain directory listings.  It's <b>opendir()</b>, <b>readdir()</b>, <b>filldir()</b> and  <b>closedir()</b>  all  in
       one call.

       example rv: return ('.', 'a', 'b', 0);

       <u>mknod</u>

       Arguments:  Filename, numeric modes, numeric device

       Returns an errno (0 upon success, as usual).

       This function is called for all non-directory, non-symlink nodes, not just devices.

       <u>mkdir</u>

       Arguments:  New directory pathname, numeric modes.

       Returns an errno.

       Called to create a directory.

       <u>unlink</u>

       Arguments:  Filename.

       Returns an errno.

       Called to remove a file, device, or symlink.

       <u>rmdir</u>

       Arguments:  Pathname.

       Returns an errno.

       Called to remove a directory.

       <u>symlink</u>

       Arguments:  Existing filename, symlink name.

       Returns an errno.

       Called to create a symbolic link.

       <u>rename</u>

       Arguments:  old filename, new filename.

       Returns an errno.

       Called to rename a file, and/or move a file from one directory to another.

       <u>link</u>

       Arguments:  Existing filename, hardlink name.

       Returns an errno.

       Called to create hard links.

       <u>chmod</u>

       Arguments:  Pathname, numeric modes.

       Returns an errno.

       Called to change permissions on a file/directory/device/symlink.

       <u>chown</u>

       Arguments:  Pathname, numeric uid, numeric gid.

       Returns an errno.

       Called to change ownership of a file/directory/device/symlink.

       <u>truncate</u>

       Arguments:  Pathname, numeric offset.

       Returns an errno.

       Called to truncate a file, at the given offset.

       <u>utime</u>

       Arguments:  Pathname, numeric actime, numeric modtime.

       Returns an errno.

       Called to change access/modification times for a file/directory/device/symlink.

       <u>open</u>

       Arguments:   Pathname, numeric flags (which is an OR-ing of stuff like O_RDONLY and O_SYNC, constants you
       can import from POSIX), fileinfo hash reference.

       Returns an errno, a file handle (optional).

       No creation, or truncation flags (O_CREAT, O_EXCL, O_TRUNC) will be passed to <b>open()</b>.  The fileinfo  hash
       reference  contains  flags  from  the Fuse open call which may be modified by the module. The only fields
       presently supported are:
        direct_io (version 2.4 onwards)
        keep_cache (version 2.4 onwards)
        nonseekable (version 2.8 onwards) Your <b>open()</b> method needs only check if the operation is permitted  for
       the  given  flags,  and  return  0  for success.  Optionally a file handle may be returned, which will be
       passed to subsequent read, write, flush, fsync and release calls.

       <u>read</u>

       Arguments:  Pathname, numeric requested size, numeric offset, file handle

       Returns a numeric errno, or a string scalar with up to $requestedsize bytes of data.

       Called in an attempt to fetch a portion of the file.

       <u>write</u>

       Arguments:  Pathname, scalar buffer, numeric offset, file handle.  You can use  length($buffer)  to  find
       the buffersize.  Returns length($buffer) if successful (number of bytes written).

       Called  in  an  attempt to write (or overwrite) a portion of the file.  Be prepared because $buffer could
       contain random binary data with NULs and all sorts of other wonderful stuff.

       <u>statfs</u>

       Arguments:  none

       Returns any of the following:

       -<b>ENOANO()</b>

       or

       $namelen, $files, $files_free, $blocks, $blocks_avail, $blocksize

       or

       -<b>ENOANO()</b>, $namelen, $files, $files_free, $blocks, $blocks_avail, $blocksize

       <u>flush</u>

       Arguments: Pathname, file handle

       Returns an errno or 0 on success.

       Called to synchronise any cached data. This is called before  the  file  is  closed.  It  may  be  called
       multiple times before a file is closed.

       <u>release</u>

       Arguments:  Pathname,  numeric  flags passed to open, file handle, flock_release flag (when built against
       FUSE 2.9 or later), lock owner ID (when built against FUSE 2.9 or later)

       Returns an errno or 0 on success.

       Called to indicate that there are no more references to the file. Called once for  every  file  with  the
       same pathname and flags as were passed to open.

       <u>fsync</u>

       Arguments: Pathname, numeric flags

       Returns an errno or 0 on success.

       Called  to  synchronise  the  file's  contents.  If  flags  is  non-zero, only synchronise the user data.
       Otherwise synchronise the user and meta data.

       <u>setxattr</u>

       Arguments: Pathname, extended attribute's name, extended attribute's value, numeric flags  (which  is  an
       OR-ing of XATTR_CREATE and XATTR_REPLACE

       Returns an errno or 0 on success.

       Called to set the value of the named extended attribute.

       If  you  wish  to  reject setting of a particular form of extended attribute name (e.g.: regexps matching
       user\..* or security\..*), then return - EOPNOTSUPP.

       If flags is set to XATTR_CREATE and the extended attribute  already  exists,  this  should  fail  with  -
       EEXIST.  If flags is set to XATTR_REPLACE and the extended attribute doesn't exist, this should fail with
       - ENOATTR.

       XATTR_CREATE and XATTR_REPLACE are provided by this module, but not exported by default. To import them:

           use Fuse ':xattr';

       or:

           use Fuse ':all';

       <u>getxattr</u>

       Arguments: Pathname, extended attribute's name

       Returns an errno, 0 if there was no value, or the extended attribute's value.

       Called to get the value of the named extended attribute.

       <u>listxattr</u>

       Arguments: Pathname

       Returns a list: 0 or more text strings (the extended  attribute  names),  followed  by  a  numeric  errno
       (usually 0).

       <u>removexattr</u>

       Arguments: Pathname, extended attribute's name

       Returns an errno or 0 on success.

       Removes the named extended attribute (if present) from a file.

       <u>opendir</u>

       Arguments: Pathname of a directory Returns an errno, and a directory handle (optional)

       Called  when  opening  a directory for reading. If special handling is required to open a directory, this
       operation can be implemented to handle that.

       <u>readdir</u>

       Arguments: Pathname of a directory, numeric offset, (optional) directory handle

       Returns a list of 0 or more entries, followed by a numeric errno (usually 0).  The entries can be  simple
       strings  (filenames),  or  arrays  containing an offset number, the filename, and optionally an array ref
       containing the stat values (as would be returned from <b>getattr()</b>).

       This is used to read entries from a directory. It can be used to return just entry names  like  <b>getdir()</b>,
       or can get a segment of the available entries, which requires using array refs and the 2- or 3-item form,
       with  offset  values  starting  from  1. If you wish to return the parameters to fill each entry's struct
       stat, but do not wish to do partial entry lists/entry counting, set the first element of each array to  0
       always.

       Note that if this call is implemented, it overrides <b>getdir()</b> ALWAYS.

       <u>releasedir</u>

       Arguments: Pathname of a directory, (optional) directory handle

       Returns an errno or 0 on success

       Called  when there are no more references to an opened directory. Called once for each pathname or handle
       passed to <b>opendir()</b>. Similar to <b>release()</b>,  but  for  directories.  Accepts  a  return  value,  but  like
       <b>release()</b>, the response code will not propagate to any corresponding <b>closedir()</b> calls.

       <u>fsyncdir</u>

       Arguments: Pathname of a directory, numeric flags, (optional) directory handle

       Returns an errno or 0 on success.

       Called  to  synchronize any changes to a directory's contents. If flag is non-zero, only synchronize user
       data, otherwise synchronize user data and metadata.

       <u>init</u>

       Arguments: None.

       Returns (optionally) an SV to be passed as private_data via <b>fuse_get_context()</b>.

       <u>destroy</u>

       Arguments: (optional) private data SV returned from <b>init()</b>, if any.

       Returns nothing.

       <u>access</u>

       Arguments: Pathname, access mode flags

       Returns an errno or 0 on success.

       Determine if the user attempting to access the  indicated  file  has  access  to  perform  the  requested
       actions. The user ID can be determined by calling <b>fuse_get_context()</b>. See <b><a href="../man2/access.2.html">access</a></b>(2) for more information.

       <u>create</u>

       Arguments: Pathname, create mask, open mode flags

       Returns errno or 0 on success, and (optional) file handle.

       Create  a  file  with the path indicated, then open a handle for reading and/or writing with the supplied
       mode flags. Can also return a file handle like <b>open()</b> as part of the call.

       <u>ftruncate</u>

       Arguments: Pathname, numeric offset, (optional) file handle

       Returns errno or 0 on success

       Like <b>truncate()</b>, but on an opened file.

       <u>fgetattr</u>

       Arguments: Pathname, (optional) file handle

       Returns a list, very similar to the 'stat' function (see perlfunc).  On error,  simply  return  a  single
       numeric scalar value (e.g. "return -<b>ENOENT()</b>;").

       Like <b>getattr()</b>, but on an opened file.

       <u>lock</u>

       Arguments: Pathname, numeric command code, hashref containing lock parameters, (optional) file handle

       Returns errno or 0 on success

       Used  to  lock  or  unlock regions of a file. Locking is handled locally, but this allows (especially for
       networked file systems) for protocol-level locking semantics to also be employed, if any are available.

       See the Fuse documentation for more explanation of <b>lock()</b>. The needed symbols for the lock constants  can
       be obtained by importing Fcntl.

       <u>utimens</u>

       Arguments: Pathname, last accessed time, last modified time

       Returns errno or 0 on success

       Like  <b>utime()</b>,  but  allows  time  resolution  down  to  the  nanosecond. By default, times are passed as
       "numeric" (internally these are  typically  represented  as  "double"),  so  the  sub-second  portion  is
       represented  as  fractions  of  a  second.  If  you want times passed as arrays instead of floating point
       values, for higher precision, you should pass the "utimens_as_array" option to "Fuse::main".

       Note that if this call is implemented, it overrides <b>utime()</b> ALWAYS.

       <u>bmap</u>

       Arguments: Pathname, numeric blocksize, numeric block number

       Returns errno or 0 on success, and physical block number if successful

       Used to map a block number offset in a file to the physical block offset on the block device backing  the
       file  system.  This  is  intended  for  filesystems  that  are stored on an actual block device, with the
       'blkdev' option passed.

       <u>ioctl</u>

       Arguments: Pathname, ioctl command code, flags, data if ioctl op is a write, (optional) file handle

       Returns errno or 0 on success, and data if ioctl op is a read

       Used to handle <b>ioctl()</b> operations on files. See <b><a href="../man2/ioctl.2.html">ioctl</a></b>(2) for more information  on  the  fine  details  of
       ioctl  operation  numbers.  May need to h2ph system headers to get the necessary macros; keep in mind the
       macros are highly OS-dependent.

       Keep in mind that read and write are from the client perspective, so read from  our  end  means  data  is
       going *out*, and write means data is coming *in*. It can be slightly confusing.

       <u>poll</u>

       Arguments: Pathname, poll handle ID (or undef if none), event mask, (optional) file handle

       Returns errno or 0 on success, and updated event mask on success

       Used to handle <b>poll()</b> operations on files. See <b><a href="../man2/poll.2.html">poll</a></b>(2) to learn more about event polling. Use IO::Poll to
       get  the  POLLIN,  POLLOUT,  and other symbols to describe the events which can happen on the filehandle.
       Save the poll handle ID to be passed to "notify_poll" and "pollhandle_destroy" functions, if  it  is  not
       undef. Threading will likely be necessary for this operation to work.

       There   is   not   an   "out   of   band"   data   transfer   channel   provided  as  part  of  FUSE,  so
       POLLPRI/POLLRDBAND/POLLWRBAND won't work.

       Poll handle is currently a read-only scalar; we are investigating a way to make this an object instead.

       <u>write_buf</u>

       Arguments: Pathname, offset, buffer vector, (optional) file handle.

       Write contents of buffer to an open file.

       Similar to the "write" method, but data is supplied in a generic buffer.  Use <b>fuse_buf_copy()</b> to transfer
       data to the destination if necessary.

       <u>read_buf</u>

       Arguments: Pathname, size, offset, buffer vector, (optional) file handle.

       Store data from an open file in a buffer.

       Similar to the "read" method, but data is stored and returned in a generic buffer.

       No actual copying of data has to take place, the source file descriptor may simply be placed in the  'fd'
       member of the buffer access hash (and the 'flags' member OR'd with FUSE_BUF_IS_FD) for later retrieval.

       Also,  if  the FUSE_BUF_FD_SEEK constant is OR'd with 'flags', the 'pos' member should contain the offset
       (in bytes) to seek to in the file descriptor.

       If data is to be read, the read data should be placed in the 'mem' member of the buffer access hash,  and
       the 'size' member should be updated if less data was read than requested.

       <u>flock</u>

       Arguments: pathname, (optional) file handle, unique lock owner ID, operation ID

       Perform BSD-style file locking operations.

       Operation  ID will be one of LOCK_SH, LOCK_EX or LOCK_UN. Non-blocking lock requests will be indicated by
       having LOCK_NB OR'd into the value.

       For more information, see the <b><a href="../man2/flock.2.html">flock</a></b>(2) manpage. For the lock symbols, do:

         use Fcntl qw(flock);

       Locking is handled locally, but this allows (especially for networked file  systems)  for  protocol-level
       locking semantics to also be employed, if any are available.

       <u>fallocate</u>

       Arguments: pathname, (optional) file handle, mode, offset, length

       Allocates space for an open file.

       This  function  ensures  that  required  space is allocated for specified file.  If this function returns
       success then any subsequent write request to specified range is guaranteed not to fail because of lack of
       space on the file system media.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       There are a few example scripts in the examples/ subdirectory.  These are:

       example.pl A simple "Hello world" type of script
       loopback.pl A filesystem loopback-device.  like fusexmp from the main FUSE dist, it simply recurses file
       operations into the real filesystem.  Unlike fusexmp, it only re-shares files under the /tmp/test
       directory.
       rmount.pl An NFS-workalike which tunnels through SSH. It requires an account on some ssh server
       (obviously) with public-key authentication enabled (if you have to type in a password, you don't have
       this. See *man ssh_keygen* for more information). Copy rmount_remote.pl to your home directory on the
       remote machine, and create a subdir somewhere, and then run it like: ./rmount.pl host /remote/dir
       /local/dir
       rmount_remote.pl A ripoff of loopback.pl meant to be used as a backend for rmount.pl.

</pre><h4><b>THE</b> <b>"FUSE"</b> <b>NAMESPACE</b></h4><pre>
       Additional   filesystems   using   Fuse   are   released   on   CPAN   under   the    Fuse::    namespace
       &lt;https://metacpan.org/search?q=FUSE&gt;.   It  includes  modules  like  Fuse::DBI  which allows you to mount
       database as file system, and Fuse::PDF, a filesystem embedded in a PDF document.
