       Sub::Defer - Defer generation of subroutines until they are first called

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        use Sub::Defer;

        my $deferred = defer_sub 'Logger::time_since_first_log' =&gt; sub {
           my $t = time;
           sub { time - $t };
        };

         Logger-&gt;time_since_first_log; # returns 0 and replaces itself
         Logger-&gt;time_since_first_log; # returns time - $t

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       These subroutines provide the user with a convenient way to defer creation of subroutines and methods
       until they are first called.

</pre><h4><b>SUBROUTINES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>defer_sub</b>
        my $coderef = defer_sub $name =&gt; sub { ... }, \%options;

       This subroutine returns a coderef that encapsulates the provided sub - when it is first called, the
       provided sub is called and is -itself- expected to return a subroutine which will be goto'ed to on
       subsequent calls.

       If a name is provided, this also installs the sub as that name - and when the subroutine is undeferred
       will re-install the final version for speed.

       Exported by default.

       <u>Options</u>

       A hashref of options can optionally be specified.

       package
           The  package  to  generate the sub in.  Will be overridden by a fully qualified $name option.  If not
           specified, will default to the caller's package.

       attributes
           The "Subroutine Attributes" in perlsub to apply to the sub generated.   Should  be  specified  as  an
           array reference.

   <b>undefer_sub</b>
        my $coderef = undefer_sub \&amp;Foo::name;

       If  the  passed  coderef  has  been  deferred this will "undefer" it.  If the passed coderef has not been
       deferred, this will just return it.

       If this is confusing, take a look at the example in the "SYNOPSIS".

       Exported by default.

   <b>defer_info</b>
        my $data = defer_info $sub;
        my ($name, $generator, $options, $undeferred_sub) = @$data;

       Returns original arguments to defer_sub, plus the  undeferred  version  if  this  sub  has  already  been
       undeferred.

       Note that $sub can be either the original deferred version or the undeferred version for convenience.

       Not exported by default.

   <b>undefer_all</b>
        undefer_all();

       This  will  undefer  all deferred subs in one go.  This can be very useful in a forking environment where
       child processes would each have to undefer the same subs.  By calling this just before you start  forking
       children you can undefer all currently deferred subs in the parent so that the children do not have to do
       it.   Note  this may bake the behavior of some subs that were intended to calculate their behavior later,
       so it shouldn't be used midway through a module load or class definition.

       Exported by default.

   <b>undefer_package</b>
         undefer_package($package);

       This undefers all deferred subs in a package.

       Not exported by default.
