       Test::Unit::Procedural - Procedural style unit testing interface

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Test::Unit::Procedural;

           # your code to be tested goes here

           sub foo { return 23 };
           sub bar { return 42 };

           # define tests

           sub test_foo { assert(foo() == 23, "Your message here"); }
           sub test_bar { assert(bar() == 42, "I will be printed if this fails"); }

           # set_up and tear_down are used to
           # prepare and release resources need for testing

           sub set_up    { print "hello world\n"; }
           sub tear_down { print "leaving world again\n"; }

           # run your test

           create_suite();
           run_suite();

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Test::Unit::Procedural is the procedural style interface to a sophisticated unit testing framework for
       Perl that is derived from the JUnit testing framework for Java by Kent Beck and Erich Gamma.  While this
       framework is originally intended to support unit testing in an object-oriented development paradigm (with
       support for inheritance of tests etc.), Test::Unit::Procedural is intended to provide a simpler interface
       to the framework that is more suitable for use in a scripting style environment.  Therefore,
       Test::Unit::Procedural does not provide much support for an object-oriented approach to unit testing - if
       you want that, please have a look at Test::Unit::TestCase.

       You test a given unit (a script, a module, whatever) by using Test::Unit::Procedural, which exports the
       following routines into your namespace:

       <b>assert()</b>
           used to assert that a boolean condition is true

       <b>create_suite()</b>
           used to create a test suite consisting of all methods with a name prefix of "test"

       <b>run_suite()</b>
           runs the test suite (text output)

       <b>add_suite()</b>
           used to add test suites to each other

       For  convenience,  create_suite()  will  automatically  build a test suite for a given package. This will
       build a test case for each subroutine in the package given that has a name starting with "test" and  pack
       them  all  together  into  one  TestSuite  object  for easy testing.  If you don't give a package name to
       create_suite(), the current package is taken as default.

       Test output is one status line (a "." for every successful test run, or an "F" for any failed  test  run,
       to  indicate  progress),  one  result  line ("OK" or "!!!FAILURES!!!"), and possibly many lines reporting
       detailed error messages for any failed tests.

       Please remember, Test::Unit::Procedural is intended to be a simple and convenient interface. If you  need
       more functionality, take the object-oriented approach outlined in Test::Unit::TestCase.
