</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       PCGESV - compute the solution to a complex system of linear equations   sub( A ) * X = sub( B ),

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       SUBROUTINE PCGESV( N, NRHS, A, IA, JA, DESCA, IPIV, B, IB, JB, DESCB, INFO )

           INTEGER        IA, IB, INFO, JA, JB, N, NRHS

           INTEGER        DESCA( * ), DESCB( * ), IPIV( * )

           COMPLEX        A( * ), B( * )

</pre><h4><b>PURPOSE</b></h4><pre>
       PCGESV computes the solution to a complex system of linear equations

       where  sub(  A  )  =  A(IA:IA+N-1,JA:JA+N-1)  is  an  N-by-N  distributed  matrix  and  X  and sub( B ) =
       B(IB:IB+N-1,JB:JB+NRHS-1) are N-by-NRHS distributed matrices.

       The LU decomposition with partial pivoting and row interchanges is used to factor sub( A ) as sub( A )  =
       P  *  L * U, where P is a permu- tation matrix, L is unit lower triangular, and U is upper triangular.  L
       and U are stored in sub( A ). The factored form of sub( A ) is then used to solve the system of equations
       sub( A ) * X = sub( B ).

       Notes
       =====

       Each global data object is described by  an  associated  description  vector.   This  vector  stores  the
       information required to establish the mapping between an object element and its corresponding process and
       memory location.

       Let  A  be  a  generic  term  for  any  2D  block cyclicly distributed array.  Such a global array has an
       associated description vector DESCA.  In the following comments, the character _ should be  read  as  "of
       the global array".

       NOTATION        STORED IN      EXPLANATION
       ---------------  -------------- -------------------------------------- DTYPE_A(global) DESCA( DTYPE_ )The
       descriptor type.  In this case,
                                      DTYPE_A = 1.
       CTXT_A (global) DESCA( CTXT_ ) The BLACS context handle, indicating
                                      the BLACS process grid A is distribu-
                                      ted over. The context itself is glo-
                                      bal, but the handle (the integer
                                      value) may vary.
       M_A    (global) DESCA( M_ )    The number of rows in the global
                                      array A.
       N_A    (global) DESCA( N_ )    The number of columns in the global
                                      array A.
       MB_A   (global) DESCA( MB_ )   The blocking factor used to distribute
                                      the rows of the array.
       NB_A   (global) DESCA( NB_ )   The blocking factor used to distribute
                                      the columns of the array.
       RSRC_A (global) DESCA( RSRC_ ) The process row over which the first
                                      row of the array A is distributed.  CSRC_A (global)  DESCA(  CSRC_  )  The
       process column over which the
                                      first column of the array A is
                                      distributed.
       LLD_A  (local)  DESCA( LLD_ )  The leading dimension of the local
                                      array.  LLD_A &gt;= MAX(1,LOCr(M_A)).

       Let  K  be  the  number  of rows or columns of a distributed matrix, and assume that its process grid has
       dimension p x q.
       LOCr( K ) denotes the number of elements of K that a process would receive if K were distributed over the
       p processes of its process column.
       Similarly, LOCc( K ) denotes the number of elements  of  K  that  a  process  would  receive  if  K  were
       distributed over the q processes of its process row.
       The values of LOCr() and LOCc() may be determined via a call to the ScaLAPACK tool function, NUMROC:
               LOCr( M ) = NUMROC( M, MB_A, MYROW, RSRC_A, NPROW ),
               LOCc(  N ) = NUMROC( N, NB_A, MYCOL, CSRC_A, NPCOL ).  An upper bound for these quantities may be
       computed by:
               LOCr( M ) &lt;= ceil( ceil(M/MB_A)/NPROW )*MB_A
               LOCc( N ) &lt;= ceil( ceil(N/NB_A)/NPCOL )*NB_A

       This routine requires square block decomposition ( MB_A = NB_A ).

</pre><h4><b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       N       (global input) INTEGER
               The number of rows and columns to be operated on, i.e. the order  of  the  distributed  submatrix
               sub( A ). N &gt;= 0.

       NRHS    (global input) INTEGER
               The  number  of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns of the distributed submatrix sub( A
               ). NRHS &gt;= 0.

       A       (local input/local output) COMPLEX pointer into the
               local memory to an array of dimension (LLD_A,LOCc(JA+N-1)).  On entry, the local pieces of the N-
               by-N distributed matrix sub( A ) to be factored. On exit, this array contains the local pieces of
               the factors L and U from the factorization sub( A ) = P*L*U; the unit diagonal elements of L  are
               not stored.

       IA      (global input) INTEGER
               The row index in the global array A indicating the first row of sub( A ).

       JA      (global input) INTEGER
               The column index in the global array A indicating the first column of sub( A ).

       DESCA   (global and local input) INTEGER array of dimension DLEN_.
               The array descriptor for the distributed matrix A.

       IPIV    (local output) INTEGER array, dimension ( LOCr(M_A)+MB_A )
               This  array contains the pivoting information.  IPIV(i) -&gt; The global row local row i was swapped
               with.  This array is tied to the distributed matrix A.

       B       (local input/local output) COMPLEX pointer into the
               local memory to an array of dimension (LLD_B,LOCc(JB+NRHS-1)).  On entry,  the  right  hand  side
               distributed  matrix  sub(  B  ).  On  exit,  if INFO = 0, sub( B ) is overwritten by the solution
               distributed matrix X.

       IB      (global input) INTEGER
               The row index in the global array B indicating the first row of sub( B ).

       JB      (global input) INTEGER
               The column index in the global array B indicating the first column of sub( B ).

       DESCB   (global and local input) INTEGER array of dimension DLEN_.
               The array descriptor for the distributed matrix B.

       INFO    (global output) INTEGER
               = 0:  successful exit
               &lt; 0:  If the i-th argument is an array and  the  j-entry  had  an  illegal  value,  then  INFO  =
               -(i*100+j),  if the i-th argument is a scalar and had an illegal value, then INFO = -i.  &gt; 0:  If
               INFO = K, U(IA+K-1,JA+K-1) is exactly zero.  The factorization has been completed, but the factor
               U is exactly singular, so the solution could not be computed.
