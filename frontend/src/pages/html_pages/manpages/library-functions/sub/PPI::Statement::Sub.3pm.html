</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       PPI::Statement::Sub - Subroutine declaration

</pre><h4><b>INHERITANCE</b></h4><pre>
         PPI::Statement::Sub
         isa PPI::Statement
             isa PPI::Node
                 isa PPI::Element

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Except for the special BEGIN, CHECK, UNITCHECK, INIT, and END subroutines (which are part of
       PPI::Statement::Scheduled) all subroutine declarations are lexed as a PPI::Statement::Sub object.

       Primarily, this means all of the various "sub foo {}" statements, but also forward declarations such as
       "sub foo;" or "sub foo($);". It <b>does</b> <b>not</b> include anonymous subroutines, as these are merely part of a
       normal statement.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       "PPI::Statement::Sub" has a number of methods in addition to the standard PPI::Statement, PPI::Node and
       PPI::Element methods.

   <b>name</b>
       The "name" method returns the name of the subroutine being declared.

       In some rare cases such as a naked "sub" at the end of the file, this may return false.

   <b>prototype</b>
       If it has one, the "prototype" method returns the subroutine's prototype.  It is returned in the same
       format as "prototype" in PPI::Token::Prototype, cleaned and removed from its brackets.

       Returns the subroutine's prototype, or undef if the subroutine does not define one. Note that when the
       sub has an empty prototype ("()") the return is an empty string.

   <b>block</b>
       With its name and implementation shared with PPI::Statement::Scheduled, the "block" method finds and
       returns the actual Structure object of the code block for this subroutine.

       Returns false if this is a forward declaration, or otherwise does not have a code block.

   <b>forward</b>
       The "forward" method returns true if the subroutine declaration is a forward declaration.

       That is, it returns false if the subroutine has a code block, or true if it does not.

   <b>reserved</b>
       The "reserved" method provides a convenience method for checking to see if this is a special reserved
       subroutine. It does not check against any particular list of reserved sub names, but just returns true if
       the name is all uppercase, as defined in perlsub.

       Note that in the case of BEGIN, CHECK, UNITCHECK, INIT and END, these will be defined as
       PPI::Statement::Scheduled objects, not subroutines.

       Returns true if it is a special reserved subroutine, or false if not.

   <b>type</b>
       The "type" method checks and returns the declaration type of the statement, which will be one of 'my',
       'our', or 'state'.

       Returns a string of the type, or "undef" if the type is not declared.
