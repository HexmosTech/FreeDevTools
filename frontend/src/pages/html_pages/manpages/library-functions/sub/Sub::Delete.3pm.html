</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Sub::Delete - Perl module enabling one to delete subroutines

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       1.00002

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Sub::Delete;
           sub foo {}
           delete_sub 'foo';
           eval 'foo();1' or die; # dies

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module provides one function, "delete_sub", that deletes the subroutine whose name is passed to it.
       (To load the module without importing the function, write "use Sub::Delete();".)

       This does more than simply undefine the subroutine in the manner of "undef &amp;foo", which leaves a stub
       that can trigger AUTOLOAD (and, consequently, won't work for deleting methods).  The subroutine is
       completely obliterated from the symbol table (though there may be references to it elsewhere, including
       in compiled code).

</pre><h4><b>PREREQUISITES</b></h4><pre>
       This module requires perl 5.8.3 or higher.

</pre><h4><b>LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       If you take a reference to a glob containing a subroutine, and then delete the subroutine with
       "delete_sub", you will find that the glob you referenced still has a subroutine in it. This is because
       "delete_sub" removes a glob, replaces it with another, and then copies the contents of the old glob into
       the new one, except for the "CODE" slot. (This is nearly impossible to fix without breaking
       constant::lexical.)

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       If you find any bugs, please report them to the author via e-mail.

       perltodo, which has "delete &amp;sub" listed as a possible future feature

       Symbol::Glob and Symbol::Util, both of which predate this module (but I only discovered them recently),
       and which allow one to delete any arbitrary slot from a glob. Neither of them takes perl 5.10 constants
       into account, however. They also both differ from this module, in that a subroutine referenced in
       compiled code can no longer be called if deleted from its glob. The entire glob must be replaced (which
       this module does).
