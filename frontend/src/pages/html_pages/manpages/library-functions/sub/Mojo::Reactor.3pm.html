</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Mojo::Reactor - Low-level event reactor base class

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         package Mojo::Reactor::MyEventLoop;
         use Mojo::Base 'Mojo::Reactor';

         sub again      {...}
         sub io         {...}
         sub is_running {...}
         sub next_tick  {...}
         sub one_tick   {...}
         sub recurring  {...}
         sub remove     {...}
         sub reset      {...}
         sub start      {...}
         sub stop       {...}
         sub timer      {...}
         sub watch      {...}

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Mojo::Reactor is an abstract base class for low-level event reactors, like Mojo::Reactor::EV and
       Mojo::Reactor::Poll.

</pre><h4><b>EVENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Mojo::Reactor inherits all events from Mojo::EventEmitter and can emit the following new ones.

   <b>error</b>
         $reactor-&gt;on(error =&gt; sub ($reactor, $err) {...});

       Emitted for exceptions caught in callbacks, fatal if unhandled. Note that if this event is unhandled or
       fails it might kill your program, so you need to be careful.

         $reactor-&gt;on(error =&gt; sub ($reactor, $err) { say "Something very bad happened: $err" });

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       Mojo::Reactor inherits all methods from Mojo::EventEmitter and implements the following new ones.

   <b>again</b>
         $reactor-&gt;again($id);
         $reactor-&gt;again($id, 0.5);

       Restart timer and optionally change the invocation time. Meant to be overloaded in a subclass. Note that
       this method requires an active timer.

   <b>detect</b>
         my $class = Mojo::Reactor-&gt;detect;

       Detect and load the best reactor implementation available, will try the value of the "MOJO_REACTOR"
       environment variable, Mojo::Reactor::EV or Mojo::Reactor::Poll.

         # Instantiate best reactor implementation available
         my $reactor = Mojo::Reactor-&gt;detect-&gt;new;

   <b>io</b>
         $reactor = $reactor-&gt;io($handle =&gt; sub {...});

       Watch handle for I/O events, invoking the callback whenever handle becomes readable or writable. Meant to
       be overloaded in a subclass.

         # Callback will be executed twice if handle becomes readable and writable
         $reactor-&gt;io($handle =&gt; sub ($reactor, $writable) {
           say $writable ? 'Handle is writable' : 'Handle is readable';
         });

   <b>is_running</b>
         my $bool = $reactor-&gt;is_running;

       Check if reactor is running. Meant to be overloaded in a subclass.

   <b>next_tick</b>
         my $undef = $reactor-&gt;next_tick(sub {...});

       Execute callback as soon as possible, but not before returning or other callbacks that have been
       registered with this method, always returns "undef". Meant to be overloaded in a subclass.

   <b>one_tick</b>
         $reactor-&gt;one_tick;

       Run reactor until an event occurs. Note that this method can recurse back into the reactor, so you need
       to be careful.  Meant to be overloaded in a subclass.

         # Don't block longer than 0.5 seconds
         my $id = $reactor-&gt;timer(0.5 =&gt; sub {});
         $reactor-&gt;one_tick;
         $reactor-&gt;remove($id);

   <b>recurring</b>
         my $id = $reactor-&gt;recurring(0.25 =&gt; sub {...});

       Create a new recurring timer, invoking the callback repeatedly after a given amount of time in seconds.
       Meant to be overloaded in a subclass.

   <b>remove</b>
         my $bool = $reactor-&gt;remove($handle);
         my $bool = $reactor-&gt;remove($id);

       Remove handle or timer. Meant to be overloaded in a subclass.

   <b>reset</b>
         $reactor-&gt;reset;

       Remove all handles and timers. Meant to be overloaded in a subclass.

   <b>start</b>
         $reactor-&gt;start;

       Start watching for I/O and timer events, this will block until "stop" is called. Note that some reactors
       stop automatically if there are no events being watched anymore. Meant to be overloaded in a subclass.

         # Start reactor only if it is not running already
         $reactor-&gt;start unless $reactor-&gt;is_running;

   <b>stop</b>
         $reactor-&gt;stop;

       Stop watching for I/O and timer events. Meant to be overloaded in a subclass.

   <b>timer</b>
         my $id = $reactor-&gt;timer(0.5 =&gt; sub {...});

       Create a new timer, invoking the callback after a given amount of time in seconds. Meant to be overloaded
       in a subclass.

   <b>watch</b>
         $reactor = $reactor-&gt;watch($handle, $readable, $writable);

       Change I/O events to watch handle for with true and false values. Meant to be overloaded in a subclass.
       Note that this method requires an active I/O watcher.

         # Watch only for readable events
         $reactor-&gt;watch($handle, 1, 0);

         # Watch only for writable events
         $reactor-&gt;watch($handle, 0, 1);

         # Watch for readable and writable events
         $reactor-&gt;watch($handle, 1, 1);

         # Pause watching for events
         $reactor-&gt;watch($handle, 0, 0);
