</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module adds the ability to quickly create new types of tie objects without creating a complete
       class. It does so in such a way as to try and make the programmers life easier when it comes to single-
       use ties that I find myself wanting to use from time-to-time.

       The "Tie::Simple" package is actually a front-end to other classes which really do all the work once
       tied, but this package does the dwimming to automatically figure out what you're trying to do.

       I've tried to make this as intuitive as possible and dependent on other bits of Perl where I can to
       minimize the need for documentation and to make this extra, extra spiffy.

</pre><h4><b>SIMPLE</b> <b>TYING</b></h4><pre>
       To setup your quick tie, simply start with the typical tie statement on the variable you're tying. You
       should always tie to the "Tie::Simple" package and not directly to the other packages included with this
       module as those are only present as helpers (even though they are really the tie classes).

       The type of tie depends upon the type of the first argument given to tie. This should be rather obvious
       from the "SYNOPSIS" above. Therefore, the arguments are:

       1.  The variable to be tied.

       2.  The string 'Tie::Simple'.

       3.  A scalar value (hereafter called the "local data").

       4.  A list of name/CODE pairs.

       At this point, you'll need to have some understanding of tying before you can continue. I suggest looking
       through perltie.

       As  you  will note in the perltie documentation, every tie package defines functions whose first argument
       is called "this". The third argument, local data, will take the place of "this"  in  all  the  subroutine
       calls  you  define in the name/CODE pair list. Each name should be the name of the function that would be
       defined for the appropriate tie-type if you were to do a full-blown package  definition.  The  subroutine
       matched to that name will take the exact arguments specified in the perltie documentation, but instead of
       "this"  it  will  be  given the local data scalar value you set (which could even be "undef" if you don't
       need it).

</pre><h4><b>TIES</b> <b>CAN</b> <b>BE</b> <b>SIMPLER</b> <b>STILL</b></h4><pre>
       The synopsis above shows the typical subroutines you could define. (I left out the "UNTIE" and  "DESTROY"
       methods,  but  you  may  define  these if you need them, but be sure to read the perltie documentation on
       possible caveats.) However, the "SYNOPSIS" is way more complete then you probably  need  to  be  in  most
       cases. This is because "Tie::Simple" does it's best to make use of some of the handy Perl built-ins which
       help with creating tie packages.

   <b>SCALARS</b>
       If you are creating a scalar tie, then you can assume all the benefits of being a Tie::Scalar.

   <b>ARRAYS</b>
       If you are creating an array tie, then you may assume all the benefits of being a Tie::Array.

   <b>HASHES</b>
       If you are creating a hash tie, then you may assume all the benefits of being a Tie::Hash.

   <b>HANDLES</b>
       If you are creating a handle tie, then you may assume all the benefits of being a Tie::Handle.

</pre><h4><b>TO</b> <b>DO</b></h4><pre>
       It  sure  would  be  nice  if  you  could declare custom @ISA lists, wouldn't it?  I'd like to add such a
       feature, but coming up with some custom "SUPER::" dispatch code or generating  new  "anonymous"  packages
       are the only ways I can think to do it. I don't really have time to add such a feature just now.
