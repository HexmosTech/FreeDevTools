</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Test::File::Contents - Test routines for examining the contents of files

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Test::File::Contents;

         file_contents_eq         $file,  $string,  $description;
         file_contents_eq_or_diff $file,  $string,  $description;
         file_contents_like       $file,  qr/foo/,  $description;
         file_md5sum_is           $file,  $md5sum,  $description;
         files_eq                 $file1, $file2,   $description;
         files_eq_or_diff         $file1, $file2,   $description;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Got an app that generates files? Then you need to test those files to make sure that their contents are
       correct. This module makes that easy. Use its test functions to make sure that the contents of files are
       exactly what you expect them to be.

</pre><h4><b>INTERFACE</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Options</b>
       These test functions take an optional hash reference of options which may include one or more of these
       options:

       "encoding"
           The  encoding in which the file is encoded. This will be used in an I/O layer to read in the file, so
           that it can be  properly  decoded  to  Perl's  internal  representation.  Examples  include  "UTF-8",
           "iso-8859-3",  and  "cp1252".  See  Encode::Supported  for a list of supported encodings. May also be
           specified as a layer, such as ":utf8" or ":raw". See perlio for a complete list of layers.

           Note that it's important to specify the encoding if you have non-ASCII characters in your  file.  And
           the  value  to  be  compared  against  (the  string  argument to "file_contents_eq()" and the regular
           expression argument to "file_contents_like()", for example, must be decoded to Perl's internal  form.
           The simplest way to do so use to put

             use utf8;

           In your test file and write it all in "UTF-8". For example:

             use utf8;
             use Test::More tests =&gt; 1;
             use Test::File::Contents;

             file_contents_eq('utf8.txt',   'ååå', { encoding =&gt; 'UTF-8' });
             file_contents_eq('latin1.txt', 'ååå', { encoding =&gt; 'UTF-8' });

       "style"
           The   style   of   diff   to   output   in   the   diagnostics   in   the   case   of  a  failure  in
           "file_contents_eq_or_diff". The possible values are:

           Unified
           Context
           OldStyle
           Table
       "context"
           Determines the amount of context displayed in diagnostic diff output. If you need to seem more of the
           area surrounding different lines, pass this option to determine how many more  links  you'd  like  to
           see.

   <b>Test</b> <b>Functions</b>
       <u>file_contents_eq</u>

         file_contents_eq $file, $string, $description;
         file_contents_eq $file, $string, { encoding =&gt; 'UTF-8' };
         file_contents_eq $file, $string, { encoding =&gt; ':bytes' }, $description;

       Checks  that  the  file's  contents  are equal to a string. Pass in a Unix-style file name and it will be
       converted for the local file system. Supported options:

       "encoding"

       The old name for this function, "file_contents_is", remains as an alias.

       <u>file_contents_eq_or_diff</u>

         file_contents_eq_or_diff $file, $string, $description;
         file_contents_eq_or_diff $file, $string, { encoding =&gt; 'UTF-8' };
         file_contents_eq_or_diff $file, $string, { style    =&gt; 'context' }, $description;

       Like "file_contents_eq()", only in the event of failure, the diagnostics will contain a diff  instead  of
       the full contents of the file. This can make it easier to test the contents of very large text files, and
       where only a subset of the lines are different. Supported options:

       "encoding"
       "style"
       "context"

       <u>file_contents_ne</u>

         file_contents_ne $file, $string, $description;
         file_contents_ne $file, $string, { encoding =&gt; 'UTF-8' };
         file_contents_ne $file, $string, { encoding =&gt; ':bytes' }, $description;

       Checks  that  the  file's  contents  do not equal a string. Pass in a Unix-style file name and it will be
       converted for the local file system. Supported options:

       "encoding"

       The old name for this function, "file_contents_isnt", remains as an alias.

       <u>file_contents_like</u>

         file_contents_like $file, qr/foo/, $description;
         file_contents_like $file, qr/foo/, { encoding =&gt; 'UTF-8' };
         file_contents_like $file, qr/foo/, { encoding =&gt; ':bytes' }, $description;

       Checks that the contents of a file match a regular expression. The regular expression must be passed as a
       regular expression object created by "qr//".  Supported options:

       "encoding"

       <u>file_contents_unlike</u>

         file_contents_unlike $file, qr/foo/, $description;
         file_contents_unlike $file, qr/foo/, { encoding =&gt; 'UTF-8' };
         file_contents_unlike $file, qr/foo/, { encoding =&gt; ':bytes' }, $description;

       Checks that the contents of a file <u>do</u> <u>not</u> match a regular expression.  The  regular  expression  must  be
       passed as a regular expression object created by "qr//". Supported options:

       "encoding"

       <u>file_md5sum_is</u>

         file_md5sum_is $file, $md5sum, $description;
         file_md5sum_is $file, $md5sum, { encoding =&gt; 'UTF-8' };
         file_md5sum_is $file, $md5sum, { encoding =&gt; ':bytes' }, $description;

       Checks  whether a file matches a given MD5 checksum. The checksum should be provided as a hex string, for
       example, "6df23dc03f9b54cc38a0fc1483df6e21".  Pass in a Unix-style file name and it will be converted for
       the local file system. Supported options:

       "encoding"
           Probably not useful unless left unset or set to ":raw".

       The old name for this function, "file_md5sum", remains as an alias.

       <u>files_eq</u>

         files_eq $file1, $file2, $description;
         files_eq $file1, $file2, { encoding =&gt; 'UTF-8' };
         files_eq $file1, $file2, { encoding =&gt; ':bytes' }, $description;

       Tests that the contents of two files are the same. Pass  in  a  Unix-style  file  name  and  it  will  be
       converted for the local file system. Supported options:

       "encoding"

       The old name for this function, "file_contents_identical", remains as an alias.

       <u>files_eq_or_diff</u>

         files_eq_or_diff $file1, $file2, $description;
         files_eq_or_diff $file1, $file2, { encoding =&gt; 'UTF-8' };
         files_eq_or_diff $file1, $file2, { style    =&gt; 'context' }, $description;

       Like  "files_eq()", this function tests that the contents of two files are the same. Unlike "files_eq()",
       on failure this function outputs a diff of the two files in the diagnostics. Supported options:

       "encoding"
       "style"
       "context"
