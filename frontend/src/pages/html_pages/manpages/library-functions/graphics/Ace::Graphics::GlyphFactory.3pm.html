</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Ace::Graphics::GlyphFactory - Create Ace::Graphics::Glyphs

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Ace::Graphics::GlyphFactory;

         my $factory = Ace::Graphics::GlyphFactory($glyph_name,@options);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The Ace::Graphics::GlyphFactory class is used internally by Ace::Graphics::Track and Ace::Graphics::Glyph
       to hold the options pertaining to a set of related glyphs and creating them on demand.  This class is not
       ordinarily useful to the end-developer.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       This section describes the class and object methods for Ace::Graphics::GlyphFactory.

   <b>CONSTRUCTORS</b>
       There is only one constructor, the <b>new()</b> method.  It is ordinarily called by Ace::Graphics::Track, in the
       <b>make_factory()</b> subroutine.

       $factory = Ace::Graphics::GlyphFactory-&gt;new($glyph_name,@options)
           The  <b>new()</b>  method  creates a new factory object.  The object will create glyphs of type $glyph_name,
           and using the options specified in @options.  Generic options are described in  Ace::Graphics::Panel,
           and specific options are described in each of the Ace::Graphics::Glyph::* manual pages.  =back

   <b>OBJECT</b> <b>METHODS</b>
       Once a track is created, the following methods can be invoked:

       $glyph = $factory-&gt;glyph($feature)
           Given  a  sequence  feature,  creates  an  Ace::Graphics::Glyph  object  to  display it.  The various
           attributes of the glyph are set from the options provided at factory creation time.

       $option = $factory-&gt;option($option_name [,$new_option])
           Given an option name, returns its value.  If a second argument is provided, sets the  option  to  the
           new value and returns its previous one.

       $index = $factory-&gt;fgcolor
           Returns  the  desired  foreground color for the glyphs in the form of an GD::Image color index.  This
           may be the one of the special colors gdBrushed and gdStyled.  This is only useful while the enclosing
           Ace::Graphics::Panel object is rendering the object.  In other contexts it returns undef.

       $scale = $factory-&gt;scale([$scale])
           Get  or  set  the  scale,  in  pixels/bp,  for  the  glyph.   This   is   ordinarily   set   by   the
           Ace::Graphics::Track  object just prior to rendering, and called by each glyphs' <b>map_pt()</b> method when
           performing the rendering.

       $color = $factory-&gt;bgcolor([$color])
           Get or set the background color for the glyphs.

       $color = $factory-&gt;fillcolor([$color])
           Get or set the fill color for the glyphs.

       $font = $factory-&gt;font([$font])
           Get or set the font to use for rendering the glyph.

       $color = $factory-&gt;fontcolor
           Get the color for the font (to set it, use <b>fgcolor()</b>).   This  is  subtly  different  from  <b>fgcolor()</b>
           itself, because it will never return a styled color, such as gdBrushed.

       $panel = $factory-&gt;panel([$panel])
           Get or set the panel that contains the GD::Image object used by this factory.

       $index = $factory-&gt;translate($color)
       @rgb = $factory-&gt;rgb($index)
           These  are  convenience procedures that are passed through to the enclosing Panel object and have the
           same effect as the like-named methods in that class.  See Ace::Graphics::Panel.
