</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Bio::Graphics::Glyph::cds - The "cds" glyph

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         See L&lt;Bio::Graphics::Panel&gt; and L&lt;Bio::Graphics::Glyph&gt;.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This glyph draws features that are associated with a protein coding region.  At high magnifications,
       draws a series of boxes that are color-coded to indicate the frame in which the translation occurs.  At
       low magnifications, draws the amino acid sequence of the resulting protein.  Amino acids that are created
       by a splice are optionally shown in a distinctive color.

   <b>OPTIONS</b>
       The following options are standard among all Glyphs.  See Bio::Graphics::Glyph for a full explanation.

         -hilite       Highlight color                undef (no color)

       In addition, the cds glyph recognizes the following glyph-specific options:

         Option      Description                      Default
         ------      -----------                      -------

         -frame0f    Color for first (+) frame        background color

         -frame1f    Color for second (+) frame       background color

         -frame2f    Color for third (+) frame        background color

         -frame0r    Color for first (-) frame        background color

         -frame1r    Color for second (-) frame       background color

         -frame2r    Color for third (-) frame        background color

         -gridcolor  Color for the "staff"            lightslategray

         -translation Number of lines of reading      3frame
                      frames to show. One of
                      "3frame", or "6frame".
                      For 6frame, specify a height
                      of at least 30 pixels.

         -sixframe   Draw a six-frame staff           0 (false; usually draws 3 frame)
                     This value overrides
                     -translation, which essentially
                     does the same thing.

         -require_subparts
                     Don't draw the reading frame 0   false
                     unless it is a feature
                     subpart.

         -sub_part   For objects with multiple        undef
                     subpart types, defines which
                     is the CDS part.

         -codontable   Codon table to use             1 (see Bio::Tools::CodonTable)

         -phase_style  The way phase is to be
                       interpreted. One of            "012"
                       "012" or "021"
         -ignore_empty_phase                          false
                     Only draw features that have
                     their phase defined.

         -cds_only   Only draw features of type       false
                     'CDS'

       This glyph is more sensitive to the underlying data model than usual, so there are a few additional
       options to use to help adapt the glyph to different environments.

       The -require_subparts option is suggested when rendering spliced transcripts which contain multiple CDS
       subparts.  Otherwise, the glyph will hickup when zoomed way down onto an intron between two CDSs (a
       phantom reading frame will appear).  For unspliced sequences, do *not* use -require_subparts.

       The -phase_style controls how the value returned by the <b>phase()</b> or <b>frame()</b> methods is to be interpreted.
       The official interpretation is that the phase value indicates the offset into the feature at which the
       reading frame starts -- e.g. a phase of "2" means the reading frame starts after skipping two bases from
       the beginning of the feature.  However, many GFF2 format feature files interpret this field to mean the
       position reading frame of the first base of the feature -- e.g. a phase of "2" means that the reading
       frame starts after skipping just one base from the beginning of the feature. Specify "012" to interpret
       the phase field in the correct way, and "021" to interpret the phase field in the legacy way. The default
       is "012."

       Here is how the option names were chosen:

           * * *                  Base the reading frame starts on
           A B C A B C A B C...
           0 1 2                  PHASE REPRESENTED CORRECTLY
           0 2 1                  PHASE REPRESENTED IN THE LEGACY WAY

       Set the -ignore_empty_phase option to true if you wish to skip subfeatures that do not have a defined
       <b>phase()</b> or <b>frame()</b>. This is useful if you are rendering exons that have both translated and untranslated
       parts, and you wish to skip the untranslated parts.

       Set the -cds_only option to true if you wish to draw the glyph only for subfeatures of type 'CDS'. This
       is recommended.
