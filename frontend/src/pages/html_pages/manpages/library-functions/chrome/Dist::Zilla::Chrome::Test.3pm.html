</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Dist::Zilla::Chrome::Test - the chrome used by Dist::Zilla::Tester

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 6.032

</pre><h4><b>PERL</b> <b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This module should work on any version of perl still receiving updates from the Perl 5 Porters.  This
       means it should work on any version of perl released in the last two to three years.  (That is, if the
       most recently released version is v5.40, then this module should work on both v5.40 and v5.38.)

       Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made that the minimum required version
       will not be increased.  The version may be increased for any reason, and there is no promise that patches
       will be accepted to lower the minimum required perl.

</pre><h4><b>ATTRIBUTES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>response_for</b>
       The response_for attribute (which exists only in the Test chrome) is a hashref that lets you specify the
       answer to questions asked by "prompt_str" or "prompt_yn".  The key is the prompt string.  If the value is
       a string, it is returned every time that question is asked.  If the value is an arrayref, the first
       element is shifted off and returned every time the question is asked.  If the arrayref is empty (or the
       prompt is not listed in the hash), the default answer (if any) is returned.

       Since you can't pass arguments to the Chrome constructor, response_for is initialized to an empty hash,
       and you can add entries after construction with the "set_response_for" method:

         $chrome-&gt;set_response_for($prompt =&gt; $response);
