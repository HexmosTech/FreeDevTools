       Coro::EV - do events the coro-way, with EV

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        use Coro;
        use Coro::EV;

        EV::READ &amp; Coro::EV::timed_io_once $fh, EV::READ, 60
           or die "timeout\n";

        EV::run;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module does two things: First, it offers some utility functions that might be useful for threads
       (although Coro::AnyEvent offers more and more portable functions), and secondly, it integrates Coro into
       the EV main loop:

       Before the process blocks (in EV::run) to wait for events, this module will schedule and run all ready (=
       runnable) threads of the same or higher priority. After that, it will cede once to a threads of lower
       priority, then continue in the event loop.

       That means that threads with the same or higher priority as the threads running the main loop will
       inhibit event processing, while threads of lower priority will get the CPU, but cannot completeley
       inhibit event processing. Note that for that to work you actually have to run the EV event loop in some
       thread.

</pre><h4><b>RUNNING</b> <b>WITH</b> <b>OR</b> <b>WITHOUT</b> <b>A</b> <b>MAINLOOP</b></h4><pre>
       In general, you should always run EV::run, either in your main program, or in a separate coroutine. If
       you don't do that and all coroutines start waiting for some events, this module will run the event loop
       once, but this is very inefficient and will also not make it possible to run background threads.

       To run the EV event loop in a separate thread, you can simply do this:

         async { EV::run };

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       $revents = Coro::EV::timed_io_once $fileno_or_fh, $events[, $timeout]
           Blocks the coroutine until either the given event set has occurred on the fd, or the timeout has been
           reached (if timeout is missing or "undef" then there will be no timeout). Returns the received flags.

           Consider  using "Coro::AnyEvent::readable" and "Coro::AnyEvent::writable" instead, they work with any
           AnyEvent-supported event loop.

       Coro::EV::timer_once $after
           Blocks the coroutine for at least $after seconds.

           Consider using "Coro::AnyEvent::sleep" instead, which works with any AnyEvent-supported event loop.
