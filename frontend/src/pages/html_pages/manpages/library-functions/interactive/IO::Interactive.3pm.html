       IO::Interactive - Utilities for interactive I/O

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This document describes IO::Interactive version 1.02

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use IO::Interactive qw(is_interactive interactive busy);

           if ( is_interactive() ) {
               print "Running interactively\n";
           }

           # or...

           print {interactive} "Running interactively\n";

           $fh = busy {
               do_noninteractive_stuff();
           }

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module provides three utility subroutines that make it easier to develop interactive applications.

       The "ARGV" filehandle, the one that "&lt;&gt;" or an empty readline() uses, has various magic associated with
       it. It's not actually opened until you try to read from it. Checking "-t ARGV" before you've tried to
       read from it might give you the wrong answer.  Not only that, you might not read from "ARGV". If the
       value in @ARGV is the magic filename "-" (a convention to mean the standard filehandle for input or
       output), "ARGV" might actually be "STDIN".  You don't want to think about all of this. This module is
       discussed in <u>Perl</u> <u>Best</u> <u>Practices</u> on page 218. Also see the "ARGV" entry in perlvar and the "readline"
       entry in perlfunc.

       is_interactive()
           This  subroutine  returns  true  if *ARGV and the currently selected filehandle (usually *STDOUT) are
           connected to the terminal. The test is considerably more sophisticated than:

               -t *ARGV &amp;&amp; -t *STDOUT

           as it takes into account the magic behaviour of *ARGV.

           You can also pass "is_interactive" a writable filehandle, in which case it requires  that  filehandle
           be connected to a terminal (instead of the currently selected). The usual suspect here is *STDERR:

               if ( is_interactive(*STDERR) ) {
                   carp $warning;
               }

           Note   that   "is_interactive"   may  return  true  in  a  Windows  Scheduled  Task.  See  Github  #6
           (https://github.com/briandfoy/io-interactive/issues/6).

       interactive()
           This  subroutine  returns  *STDOUT  if  "is_interactive"  is  true.  If  is_interactive()  is  false,
           "interactive" returns a filehandle that does not print.

           This makes it easy to create applications that print out only when the application is interactive:

               print {interactive} "Please enter a value: ";
               my $value = &lt;&gt;;

           You  can also pass "interactive" a writable filehandle, in which case it writes to that filehandle if
           it is connected to a terminal (instead of writing to *STDOUT).  Once  again,  the  usual  suspect  is
           *STDERR:

               print {interactive(*STDERR)} $warning;

       "busy {...}"
           This  subroutine  takes  a block as its single argument and executes that block.  Whilst the block is
           executed, *ARGV is temporarily replaced by a closed filehandle. That  is,  no  input  from  *ARGV  is
           possible  in  a  "busy" block.  Furthermore, any attempts to send input into the "busy" block through
           *ARGV is intercepted and a warning message  is  printed  to  *STDERR.   The  "busy"  call  returns  a
           filehandle that contains the intercepted input.

           A "busy" block is therefore useful to prevent attempts at input when the program is busy at some non-
           interactive task.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       Unknown subroutine (%s) requested
           This  module only exports the three subroutines described above.  You asked for something else. Maybe
           you misspelled the subroutine you wanted.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>AND</b> <b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       IO::Interactive requires no configuration files or environment variables.

</pre><h4><b>DEPENDENCIES</b></h4><pre>
       This module requires the openhandle() subroutine from the Scalar::Util module.

</pre><h4><b>INCOMPATIBILITIES</b></h4><pre>
       None reported.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       No bugs have been reported.
