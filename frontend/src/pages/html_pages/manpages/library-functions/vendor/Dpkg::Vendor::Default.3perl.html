</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Dpkg::Vendor::Default - default vendor class

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       A vendor class is used to provide vendor specific behaviour in various places. This is the default class
       used in case there's none for the current vendor or in case the vendor could not be identified (see
       Dpkg::Vendor documentation).

       It provides some hooks that are called by various dpkg-* tools.  If you need a new hook, please file a
       bug against dpkg-dev and explain your need. Note that the hook API has no guarantee to be stable over an
       extended period of time. If you run an important distribution that makes use of vendor hooks, you'd
       better submit them for integration so that we avoid breaking your code.

       <b>Note</b>: This is a private module, its API can change at any time.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       $vendor_obj = Dpkg::Vendor::Default-&gt;<b>new()</b>
           Creates  the  default  vendor  object.  Can be inherited by all vendor objects if they don't need any
           specific initialization at object creation time.

       $vendor_obj-&gt;run_hook($id, @params)
           Run the corresponding hook. The parameters are hook-specific. The supported hooks are:

           before-source-build ($srcpkg)
                   The first parameter is a Dpkg::Source::Package object. The hook is  called  just  before  the
                   execution of $srcpkg-&gt;<b>build()</b>.

           package-keyrings ()
                   The  hook  is called when dpkg-source is checking a signature on a source package (since dpkg
                   1.18.11). It takes no parameters, but returns a  (possibly  empty)  list  of  vendor-specific
                   keyrings.

           archive-keyrings ()
                   The  hook  is called when there is a need to check signatures on artifacts from repositories,
                   for example by a download method (since dpkg 1.18.11).  It takes no parameters, but returns a
                   (possibly empty) list of vendor-specific keyrings.

           archive-keyrings-historic ()
                   The hook is called when there is a need  to  check  signatures  on  artifacts  from  historic
                   repositories,  for example by a download method (since dpkg 1.18.11). It takes no parameters,
                   but returns a (possibly empty) list of vendor-specific keyrings.

           builtin-build-depends ()
                   The hook is  called  when  dpkg-checkbuilddeps  is  initializing  the  source  package  build
                   dependencies (since dpkg 1.18.2). It takes no parameters, but returns a (possibly empty) list
                   of vendor-specific <b>Build-Depends</b>.

           builtin-build-conflicts ()
                   The  hook  is  called  when  dpkg-checkbuilddeps  is  initializing  the  source package build
                   conflicts (since dpkg 1.18.2). It takes no parameters, but returns a (possibly empty) list of
                   vendor-specific <b>Build-Conflicts</b>.

           register-custom-fields ()
                   The hook is called in Dpkg::Control::Fields to register custom fields.  You should  return  a
                   list  of  arrays.  Each  array is an operation to perform.  The first item is the name of the
                   operation and corresponds to  a  field_*  function  provided  by  Dpkg::Control::Fields.  The
                   remaining fields are the parameters that are passed unchanged to the corresponding function.

                   Known operations are "register", "insert_after" and "insert_before".

           post-process-changelog-entry ($fields)
                   The  hook  is called in Dpkg::Changelog to post-process a Dpkg::Changelog::Entry after it has
                   been created and filled with the appropriate values.

           update-buildflags ($flags)
                   The hook is called in Dpkg::BuildFlags to allow the vendor to override the default values set
                   for the various build flags. $flags is a Dpkg::BuildFlags object.

           update-buildprofiles ($build_profiles_ref)
                   The hook is called in Dpkg::BuildProfiles to allow the vendor to override the default  values
                   set. $build_profiles_ref is a array ref to Dpkg::BuildProfiles object.

           builtin-system-build-paths ()
                   The  hook  is called by dpkg-genbuildinfo to determine if the current path should be recorded
                   in the <b>Build-Path</b> field (since dpkg 1.18.11). It takes no parameters, but returns a (possibly
                   empty) list of root paths  considered  acceptable.  As  an  example,  if  the  list  contains
                   "/build/",   a   Build-Path   field   will   be   created   if   the   current  directory  is
                   "/build/dpkg-1.18.0". If the list contains "/", the path will always be recorded. If the list
                   is empty, the current path will never be recorded.

           build-tainted-by ()
                   The hook is called by dpkg-genbuildinfo to determine if the current system has  been  tainted
                   in  some  way  that  could  affect  the resulting build, which will be recorded in the <b>Build-</b>
                   <b>Tainted-By</b> field (since dpkg 1.19.5). It takes no parameters, but returns a (possibly  empty)
                   list of tainted reason tags (formed by alphanumeric and dash characters).

           sanitize-environment ()
                   The  hook  is  called  by  dpkg-buildpackage  to  sanitize  its build environment (since dpkg
                   1.20.0).

           backport-version-regex ()
                   The hook is called by dpkg-genchanges  and  dpkg-mergechangelog  to  determine  the  backport
                   version string that should be specially handled as not an earlier than version or remapped so
                   that it does not get considered as a pre-release (since dpkg 1.21.3).  The returned string is
                   a  regex  with  one  capture group for the backport delimiter string, or undef if there is no
                   regex.

       $vendor-&gt;set_build_features($flags)
           Sets the vendor build features, which will then be used to initialize the build flags.

       $vendor-&gt;add_build_flags($flags)
           Adds the vendor build flags to  the  compiler  flag  variables  based  on  the  vendor  defaults  and
           previously set build features.
