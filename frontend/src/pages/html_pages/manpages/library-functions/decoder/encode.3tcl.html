</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This package provides a class for the generation of zip archives.

</pre><h4><b>CLASS</b> <b>API</b></h4><pre>
       <b>::zipfile::encode</b> ?<u>objectName</u>?
              The  class  command  constructs  encoder instances, i.e. objects. The result of the command is the
              fully-qualified name of the instance command.

              If no <u>objectName</u> is specified the class will generate and use an automatic name. If the <u>objectName</u>
              was specified, but is not fully qualified the command will be created in the current namespace.

</pre><h4><b>INSTANCE</b> <b>API</b></h4><pre>
       <b>&lt;encoder&gt;</b> <b>comment:</b> <u>text</u>
              This method specifies the text of the global comment for the archive.  The result of the method is
              the empty string.  In case of multiple calls to this method for the same encoder the data from the
              last call prevails over all previous texts.

       <b>&lt;encoder&gt;</b> <b>file:</b> <u>dst</u> <u>owned</u> <u>src</u> ?<u>noCompress</u>?
              This method adds a new file to the archive.  The contents of the file are found in the  filesystem
              at <u>src</u>, and will be stored in the archive under path <u>dst</u>.  If the file is declared as <u>owned</u> by the
              archive  the  original  file  will  be  deleted  when  the archive is constructed and written.  If
              <u>noCompress</u> is set to <b>true</b> the file will not be compressed on writing. Otherwise (the default)  the
              file is compressed if it is advantageous.  The result of the method is an empty string.

       <b>&lt;encoder&gt;</b> <b>write</b> <u>archive</u>
              This method takes the global comment and all added files, encodes them as a zip archive and stores
              the result at path <u>archive</u> in the filesystem.  All added files which were owned by the archive are
              deleted  at  this point.  On the issue of ordering, the files are added to the archive in the same
              order as they were specified via <b>file:</b>. <u>Note</u> that this  behaviour  is  new  for  version  0.4  and
              higher.  Before  0.4 no specific order was documented. It was lexicographically sorted. The change
              was made to support <b>zip</b>-based file formats which require a specific order of files in the archive,
              for example "<u>.epub</u>".

</pre><h4><b>BUGS,</b> <b>IDEAS,</b> <b>FEEDBACK</b></h4><pre>
       This document, and the package it describes, will undoubtedly contain bugs and  other  problems.   Please
       report  such  in  the  category  <u>zipfile</u>  of  the <u>Tcllib</u> <u>Trackers</u> [<a href="http://core.tcl.tk/tcllib/reportlist">http://core.tcl.tk/tcllib/reportlist</a>].
       Please also report any ideas for enhancements you may have for either package and/or documentation.

       When proposing code changes, please provide <u>unified</u> <u>diffs</u>, i.e the output of <b>diff</b> <b>-u</b>.

       Note further that <u>attachments</u> are strongly preferred over inlined patches. Attachments  can  be  made  by
       going  to the <b>Edit</b> form of the ticket immediately after its creation, and then using the left-most button
       in the secondary navigation bar.
