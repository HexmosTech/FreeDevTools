</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       MIME::Decoder - an object for decoding the body part of a MIME stream

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       Before reading further, you should see MIME::Tools to make sure that you understand where this module
       fits into the grand scheme of things.  Go on, do it now.  I'll wait.

       Ready?  Ok...

   <b>Decoding</b> <b>a</b> <b>data</b> <b>stream</b>
       Here's a simple filter program to read quoted-printable data from STDIN (until EOF) and write the decoded
       data to STDOUT:

           use MIME::Decoder;

           $decoder = new MIME::Decoder 'quoted-printable' or die "unsupported";
           $decoder-&gt;decode(\*STDIN, \*STDOUT);

   <b>Encoding</b> <b>a</b> <b>data</b> <b>stream</b>
       Here's a simple filter program to read binary data from STDIN (until EOF) and write base64-encoded data
       to STDOUT:

           use MIME::Decoder;

           $decoder = new MIME::Decoder 'base64' or die "unsupported";
           $decoder-&gt;encode(\*STDIN, \*STDOUT);

   <b>Non-standard</b> <b>encodings</b>
       You can <b>write</b> <b>and</b> <b>install</b> your own decoders so that MIME::Decoder will know about them:

           use MyBase64Decoder;

           install MyBase64Decoder 'base64';

       You can also <b>test</b> if a given encoding is supported:

           if (supported MIME::Decoder 'x-uuencode') {
               ### we can uuencode!
           }

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This abstract class, and its private concrete subclasses (see below) provide an OO front end to the
       actions of...

       •   Decoding a MIME-encoded stream

       •   Encoding a raw data stream into a MIME-encoded stream.

       The  constructor for MIME::Decoder takes the name of an encoding ("base64", "7bit", etc.), and returns an
       instance of a <u>subclass</u> of MIME::Decoder whose decode()  method  will  perform  the  appropriate  decoding
       action, and whose encode() method will perform the appropriate encoding action.

</pre><h4><b>PUBLIC</b> <b>INTERFACE</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Standard</b> <b>interface</b>
       If all you are doing is <u>using</u> this class, here's all you'll need...

       new ENCODING
           <u>Class</u>  <u>method,</u>  <u>constructor.</u>   Create  and  return  a  new  decoder object which can handle the given
           ENCODING.

               my $decoder = new MIME::Decoder "7bit";

           Returns the undefined value if no known decoders are appropriate.

       best ENCODING
           <u>Class</u> <u>method,</u> <u>constructor.</u>  Exactly like <b>new()</b>, except that this defaults any unsupported encoding to
           "binary", after raising a suitable warning (it's a fatal error if there's no binary decoder).

               my $decoder = best MIME::Decoder "x-gzip64";

           Will either return a decoder, or a raise a fatal exception.

       decode INSTREAM,OUTSTREAM
           <u>Instance</u> <u>method.</u>  Decode the document waiting in the  input  handle  INSTREAM,  writing  the  decoded
           information to the output handle OUTSTREAM.

           Read the section in this document on I/O handles for more information about the arguments.  Note that
           you can still supply old-style unblessed filehandles for INSTREAM and OUTSTREAM.

           Returns true on success, throws exception on failure.

       encode INSTREAM,OUTSTREAM
           <u>Instance</u>  <u>method.</u>   Encode the document waiting in the input filehandle INSTREAM, writing the encoded
           information to the output stream OUTSTREAM.

           Read the section in this document on I/O handles for more information about the arguments.  Note that
           you can still supply old-style unblessed filehandles for INSTREAM and OUTSTREAM.

           Returns true on success, throws exception on failure.

       encoding
           <u>Instance</u> <u>method.</u>  Return the encoding that  this  object  was  created  to  handle,  coerced  to  all
           lowercase (e.g., "base64").

       head [HEAD]
           <u>Instance</u>  <u>method.</u>   Completely  optional: some decoders need to know a little about the file they are
           encoding/decoding; e.g., x-uu likes to have the filename.  The HEAD is any object which  responds  to
           messages like:

               $head-&gt;mime_attr('content-disposition.filename');

       supported [ENCODING]
           <u>Class</u>  <u>method.</u>  With one arg (an ENCODING name), returns truth if that encoding is currently handled,
           and falsity otherwise.  The ENCODING will be automatically coerced to lowercase:

               if (supported MIME::Decoder '7BIT') {
                   ### yes, we can handle it...
               }
               else {
                   ### drop back six and punt...
               }

           With no args, returns a reference to a hash of all available decoders, where the key is the  encoding
           name (all lowercase, like '7bit'), and the value is true (it happens to be the name of the class that
           handles  the decoding, but you probably shouldn't rely on that).  You may safely modify this hash; it
           will <u>not</u> change the way the module performs its lookups.  Only "install" can do that.

           <u>Thanks</u> <u>to</u> <u>Achim</u> <u>Bohnet</u> <u>for</u> <u>suggesting</u> <u>this</u> <u>method.</u>

   <b>Subclass</b> <b>interface</b>
       If you are writing (or installing) a new decoder subclass, there are some other methods  you'll  need  to
       know about:

       decode_it INSTREAM,OUTSTREAM
           <u>Abstract</u>  <u>instance</u>  <u>method.</u>   The back-end of the <b>decode</b> method.  It takes an input handle opened for
           reading (INSTREAM), and an output handle opened for writing (OUTSTREAM).

           If you are writing your own decoder subclass, you must override this  method  in  your  class.   Your
           method  should  read  from the input handle via getline() or read(), decode this input, and print the
           decoded data to the output handle via print().  You may do this however you see fit, so long  as  the
           end result is the same.

           Note  that  unblessed  references  and  globrefs are automatically turned into I/O handles for you by
           decode(), so you don't need to worry about it.

           Your method must return either "undef" (to indicate failure), or 1 (to  indicate  success).   It  may
           also throw an exception to indicate failure.

       encode_it INSTREAM,OUTSTREAM
           <u>Abstract</u>  <u>instance</u>  <u>method.</u>   The back-end of the <b>encode</b> method.  It takes an input handle opened for
           reading (INSTREAM), and an output handle opened for writing (OUTSTREAM).

           If you are writing your own decoder subclass, you must override this  method  in  your  class.   Your
           method  should  read  from the input handle via getline() or read(), encode this input, and print the
           encoded data to the output handle via print().  You may do this however you see fit, so long  as  the
           end result is the same.

           Note  that  unblessed  references  and  globrefs are automatically turned into I/O handles for you by
           encode(), so you don't need to worry about it.

           Your method must return either "undef" (to indicate failure), or 1 (to  indicate  success).   It  may
           also throw an exception to indicate failure.

       filter IN, OUT, COMMAND...
           <u>Class</u>  <u>method,</u>  <u>utility.</u>   If  your  decoder involves an external program, you can invoke them easily
           through this method.  The command must be a "filter": a command  that  reads  input  from  its  STDIN
           (which  will  come  from  the  IN argument) and writes output to its STDOUT (which will go to the OUT
           argument).

           For example, here's a decoder that un-gzips its data:

               sub decode_it {
                   my ($self, $in, $out) = @_;
                   $self-&gt;filter($in, $out, "gzip -d -");
               }

           The usage is similar to IPC::Open2::open2 (which it uses internally), so you can specify COMMAND as a
           single argument or as an array.

       init ARGS...
           <u>Instance</u> <u>method.</u>  Do any necessary initialization of the new instance, taking whatever arguments were
           given to new().  Should return the self object on success, undef on failure.

       install ENCODINGS...
           <u>Class</u> <u>method</u>.  Install this class so that each encoding in ENCODINGS is handled by it:

               install MyBase64Decoder 'base64', 'x-base64super';

           You should not override this method.

       uninstall ENCODINGS...
           <u>Class</u> <u>method</u>.  Uninstall support for  encodings.   This  is  a  way  to  turn  off  the  decoding  of
           "experimental" encodings.  For safety, always use MIME::Decoder directly:

               uninstall MIME::Decoder 'x-uu', 'x-uuencode';

           You should not override this method.

</pre><h4><b>DECODER</b> <b>SUBCLASSES</b></h4><pre>
       You  don't need to "use" any other Perl modules; the following "standard" subclasses are included as part
       of MIME::Decoder:

            Class:                         Handles encodings:
            ------------------------------------------------------------
            MIME::Decoder::Binary          binary
            MIME::Decoder::NBit            7bit, 8bit
            MIME::Decoder::Base64          base64
            MIME::Decoder::QuotedPrint     quoted-printable

       The following "non-standard" subclasses are also included:

            Class:                         Handles encodings:
            ------------------------------------------------------------
            MIME::Decoder::UU              x-uu, x-uuencode
            MIME::Decoder::Gzip64          x-gzip64            ** requires gzip!

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Input/Output</b> <b>handles</b>
       As of MIME-tools 2.0, this class has to play nice with the new MIME::Body class... which means that input
       and output routines cannot just assume that they are dealing with filehandles.

       Therefore, all that MIME::Decoder and its subclasses require (and, thus, all that  they  can  assume)  is
       that  INSTREAMs  and  OUTSTREAMs  are  objects  which  respond to a subset of the messages defined in the
       IO::Handle interface; minimally:

             print
             getline
             read(BUF,NBYTES)

       <u>Thanks</u> <u>to</u> <u>Achim</u> <u>Bohnet</u> <u>for</u> <u>suggesting</u> <u>this</u> <u>more-generic</u> <u>I/O</u> <u>model.</u>

   <b>Writing</b> <b>a</b> <b>decoder</b>
       If you're experimenting with your own encodings, you'll probably want to write a decoder.  Here  are  the
       basics:

       1.  Create a module, like "MyDecoder::", for your decoder.  Declare it to be a subclass of MIME::Decoder.

       2.  Create the following instance methods in your class, as described above:

               decode_it
               encode_it
               init

       3.  In your application program, activate your decoder for one or more encodings like this:

               require MyDecoder;

               install MyDecoder "7bit";   ### use MyDecoder to decode "7bit"
               install MyDecoder "x-foo";  ### also use MyDecoder to decode "x-foo"

       To illustrate, here's a custom decoder class for the "quoted-printable" encoding:

           package MyQPDecoder;

           @ISA = qw(MIME::Decoder);
           use MIME::Decoder;
           use MIME::QuotedPrint;

           ### decode_it - the private decoding method
           sub decode_it {
               my ($self, $in, $out) = @_;
               local $_;
               while (defined($_ = $in-&gt;getline)) {
                   my $decoded = decode_qp($_);
                   $out-&gt;print($decoded);
               }
               1;
           }

           ### encode_it - the private encoding method
           sub encode_it {
               my ($self, $in, $out) = @_;

               my ($buf, $nread) = ('', 0);
               while ($in-&gt;read($buf, 60)) {
                   my $encoded = encode_qp($buf);
                   $out-&gt;print($encoded);
               }
               1;
           }

       That's  it.   The  task was pretty simple because the "quoted-printable" encoding can easily be converted
       line-by-line... as can even "7bit" and "8bit" (since all these encodings guarantee short  lines,  with  a
       max  of  1000 characters).  The good news is: it is very likely that it will be similarly-easy to write a
       MIME::Decoder for any future standard encodings.

       The "binary" decoder, however, really required block reads and writes:  see  "MIME::Decoder::Binary"  for
       details.
