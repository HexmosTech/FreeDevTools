       Proc::Daemon - Run Perl program(s) as a daemon process.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Proc::Daemon;

           $daemon = Proc::Daemon-&gt;new(
               work_dir =&gt; '/my/daemon/directory',
               .....
           );

           $Kid_1_PID = $daemon-&gt;Init;

           unless ( $Kid_1_PID ) {
               # code executed only by the child ...
           }

           $Kid_2_PID = $daemon-&gt;Init( {
                           work_dir     =&gt; '/other/daemon/directory',
                           exec_command =&gt; 'perl /home/my_script.pl',
                        } );

           $pid = $daemon-&gt;Status( ... );

           $stopped = $daemon-&gt;Kill_Daemon( ... );

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module can be used by a Perl program to initialize itself as a daemon or to execute ("exec") a
       system command as daemon. You can also check the status of the daemon (alive or dead) and you can kill
       the daemon.

       A daemon is a process that runs in the background with no controlling terminal. Generally servers (like
       FTP, HTTP and SIP servers) run as daemon processes. Do not make the mistake to think that a daemon is a
       server. ;-)

       Proc::Daemon does the following:

       1.  The script forks a child.

       2.  The child changes the current working directory to the value of 'work_dir'.

       3.  The child clears the file creation mask.

       4.  The child becomes a session leader, which detaches the program from the controlling terminal.

       5.  The  child forks another child (the final daemon process). This prevents the potential of acquiring a
           controlling terminal at all and detaches the daemon completely from the first parent.

       6.  The second child  closes  all  open  file  descriptors  (unless  you  define  "dont_close_fh"  and/or
           "dont_close_fd").

       7.  The second child opens STDIN, STDOUT and STDERR to the location defined in the constructor ("new").

       8.  The  second child returns to the calling script, or the program defined in 'exec_command' is executed
           and the second child never returns.

       9.  The first child transfers the PID of the second child (daemon) to the parent. Additionally the PID of
           the daemon process can be written into a file if 'pid_file' is defined. Then the first child exits.

       10. If the parent script is looking for a return  value,  then  the  PID(s)  of  the  child/ren  will  be
           returned. Otherwise the parent will exit.

       NOTE:  Because  of the second fork the daemon will not be a session-leader and therefore Signals will not
       be send to other members of his process group. If you need the functionality of a session-leader you  may
       want to call <b>POSIX::setsid()</b> manually at your daemon.

       INFO:  Since  "fork"  is  not performed the same way on Windows systems as on Linux, this module does not
       work with Windows. Patches appreciated!

</pre><h4><b>CONSTRUCTOR</b></h4><pre>
       new ( %ARGS )
           The constructor creates a new Proc::Daemon object based on the hash %ARGS. The  following  keys  from
           %ARGS are used:

           work_dir
                   Defines the path to the working directory of your daemon. Defaults to "/".

           setuid  Sets  the  real  user  identifier  ($&lt;) and the effective user identifier ($&gt;) for the daemon
                   process using "POSIX::setuid( ... )", in case you want to run your daemon under  a  different
                   user from the parent. Obviously the first user must have the rights to switch to the new user
                   otherwise  it  will stay the same. It is helpful to define the argument "setuid" if you start
                   your script at boot time by init with the superuser, but wants the  daemon  to  run  under  a
                   normal user account.

           setgid  Sets  the  real  group identifier ($() and the effective group identifier ($)) for the daemon
                   process using "POSXI::setgid( ... )", just like "setuid".  As with "setuid", the  first  user
                   must have the rights to switch to the new group, otherwise the group id will not be changed.

           child_STDIN
                   Defines  the  path  to  STDIN  for  your daemon. Defaults to "/dev/null". Default Mode is '&lt;'
                   (read). You can define other Mode the same way as you do using Perls "open" in a two-argument
                   form.

           child_STDOUT
                   Defines the path where the output of your daemon will go. Defaults  to  "/dev/null".  Default
                   Mode  is  '+&gt;'  (write/read).  You  can  define other Mode the same way as you do using Perls
                   "open" in a two-argument form.

           child_STDERR
                   Defines the path where the error output of your daemon  will  go.  Defaults  to  "/dev/null".
                   Default  Mode  is  '+&gt;'  (write/read). You can define other Mode the same way as you do using
                   Perls "open" in a two-argument form, see example below.

           dont_close_fh
                   If you define it, it must be an arrayref with file handles you  want  to  preserve  from  the
                   parent  into  the  child  (daemon).  This may be the case if you have code below a "__DATA__"
                   token in your script or module called by "use" or "require".

                       dont_close_fh =&gt; [ 'main::DATA', 'PackageName::DATA', $my_filehandle, ... ],

                   You can add any kind of file handle to the array (expression in single  quotes  or  a  scalar
                   variable),  including  'STDIN', 'STDOUT' and 'STDERR'. Logically the path settings from above
                   ("child_STDIN", ...) will be ignored in this case.

                   DISCLAIMER: Using this argument may not detach your daemon fully from the parent! Use  it  at
                   your own risk.

           dont_close_fd
                   Same  function  and  disclaimer as "dont_close_fh", but instead of file handles you write the
                   numeric file descriptors inside the arrayref.

           pid_file
                   Defines the path to a file (owned by the parent user) where the PID  of  the  daemon  process
                   will be stored. Defaults to "undef" (= write no file).

           file_umask
                   Defines  umask  for  "pid_file",  "child_STDIN",  "child_STDOUT"  and  "child_STDERR"  files.
                   Defaults to 066 (other users may not modify or read the files).

           exec_command
                   Scalar or arrayref with system command(s) that will be executed by the daemon via Perls "exec
                   PROGRAM_LIST". In this case the child will never return to the parents process!

           Example:

               my $daemon = Proc::Daemon-&gt;new(
                   work_dir     =&gt; '/working/daemon/directory',
                   child_STDOUT =&gt; '/path/to/daemon/output.file',
                   child_STDERR =&gt; '+&gt;&gt;debug.txt',
                   pid_file     =&gt; 'pid.txt',
                   exec_command =&gt; 'perl /home/my_script.pl',
                 # or:
                 # exec_command =&gt; [ 'perl /home/my_script.pl', 'perl /home/my_other_script.pl' ],
               );

           In this example:

           •       the PID of the daemon will be returned to $daemon in the parent process and a  pid-file  will
                   be created at "/working/daemon/directory/pid.txt".

           •       STDOUT  will  be open with Mode '+&gt;' (write/read) to "/path/to/daemon/output.file" and STDERR
                   will be open to "/working/daemon/directory/debug.txt" with Mode '+&gt;&gt;' (write/read opened  for
                   appending).

           •       the  script  "/home/my_script.pl" will be executed by "perl" and run as daemon. Therefore the
                   child process will never return to this parent script.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       Init( [ { %ARGS } ] )
           Become a daemon.

           If used for the first time after "new", you call "Init"  with  the  object  reference  to  start  the
           daemon.

               $pid = $daemon-&gt;Init();

           If  you want to use the object reference created by "new" for other daemons, you write "Init( { %ARGS
           } )". %ARGS are the same as described in "new". Notice  that  you  shouldn't  call  "Init()"  without
           argument  in  this  case, or the next daemon will execute and/or write in the same files as the first
           daemon. To prevent this use at least an empty anonymous hash here.

               $pid = $daemon-&gt;Init( {} );
               @pid = $daemon-&gt;Init( {
                   work_dir     =&gt; '/other/daemon/directory',
                   exec_command =&gt; [ 'perl /home/my_second_script.pl', 'perl /home/my_third_script.pl' ],
               } );

           If you don't need the Proc::Daemon object reference in your script,  you  can  also  use  the  method
           without object reference:

               $pid = Proc::Daemon::Init();
               # or
               $pid = Proc::Daemon::Init( { %ARGS } );

           "Init"  returns  the  PID  (scalar)  of  the daemon to the parent, or the PIDs (array) of the daemons
           created if "exec_command" has more then one program to execute. See examples above.

           "Init" returns 0 to the child (daemon).

           If you call the "Init" method in the context without looking for a return value  (void  context)  the
           parent process will "exit" here like in earlier versions:

               Proc::Daemon::Init();

       Status( [ $ARG ] )
           This function checks the status of the process (daemon). Returns the PID number (alive) or 0 (dead).

           $ARG can be a string with:

           •       "undef", in this case it tries to get the PID to check out of the object reference settings.

           •       a PID number to check.

           •       the path to a file containing the PID to check.

           •       the  command  line entry of the running program to check. This requires Proc::ProcessTable to
                   be installed.

       Kill_Daemon( [ $ARG [, SIGNAL] ] )
           This function kills the Daemon process. Returns the number of processes  successfully  killed  (which
           mostly is not the same as the PID number), or 0 if the process wasn't found.

           $ARG  is  the same as of "Status()". SIGNAL is an optional signal name or number as required by Perls
           "kill" function and listed out by "kill -l" on your  system.  Default  value  is  9  ('KILL'  =  non-
           catchable, non-ignorable kill).

       Fork
           Is like the Perl built-in "fork", but it retries to fork over 30 seconds if necessary and if possible
           to  fork  at  all.  It returns the child PID to the parent process and 0 to the child process. If the
           fork is unsuccessful it "warn"s and returns "undef".

</pre><h4><b>OTHER</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       Proc::Daemon also defines some other functions. See source code for more details:

       OpenMax( [ $NUMBER ] )
           Returns the maximum file descriptor number. If undetermined $NUMBER will be returned.

       adjust_settings
           Does some fixes/adjustments on the "new" settings together with "fix_filename".

       fix_filename( $KEYNAME )
           Prevents double use of same filename in different processes.

       get_pid( [ $STRING ] )
           Returns the wanted PID if it can be found.

       get_pid_by_proc_table_attr( $ATTR, $MATCH )
           Returns  the  wanted  PID  by  looking  into  the   process   table,   or   "undef".   Requires   the
           "Proc::ProcessTable" module to be installed.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       "Proc::Daemon::init" is still available for backwards capability.

       Proc::Daemon is now taint safe (assuming it is not passed any tainted parameters).
