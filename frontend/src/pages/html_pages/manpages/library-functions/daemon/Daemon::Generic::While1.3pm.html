</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
        Daemon::Generic::While1 - Daemon framework with default <a href="../man1/while.1.html">while</a>(1) loop

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        @ISA = qw(Daemon::Generic::While1);

        sub gd_run_body {
               # stuff
        }

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This is a slight variation on Daemon::Generic: a default "gd_run()" provided.  It has a <b><a href="../man1/while.1.html">while</a></b>(1) loop
       that calls "gd_run_body()" over and over.  It checks for reconifg and and terminate events and only
       actions them between calls to "gd_run_body()".

       Terminate events will be forced through after $Daemon::Generic::force_quit_delay seconds if
       "gd_run_body()" doesn't return quickly enough.

</pre><h4><b>SUBCLASS</b> <b>METHODS</b> <b>REQUIRD</b></h4><pre>
       The following method is required to be overridden to subclass Daemon::Generic::While1:

       <b>gd_run_body()</b>  This  method  will be called over and over.  This method should include a call to <a href="../man1/sleep.1.html">sleep</a>(1)
                      (or a bit more).  Reconfig events will not interrupt it.  Quit events will only  interrupt
                      it after 15 seconds.

</pre><h4><b>ADDITIONAL</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       The following additional methods are available for your use (as compared to Daemon::Generic):

       gd_sleep($period)
                      This  will  sleep  for  $period seconds but in one-second intervals so that if a SIGINT or
                      SIGHUP arrives the sleep period can end more quickly.

                      Using  this   makes   it   safe   for   "gd_run_body()"   to   sleep   for   longer   than
                      $Daemon::Generic::force_quit_delay seconds at a time.

</pre><h4><b>ADDITIONAL</b> <b>MEMBER</b> <b>DATA</b></h4><pre>
       The following additional bits of member data are defined:

       gd_sigint      The time at which an (unprocessed) SIGINT was received.

       gd_sighup      The time at which an (unprocessed) SIGHUP was received.
