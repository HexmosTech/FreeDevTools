</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       NGWSYM - Draws a symbol from the standard WMO/NOAA meteorological fonts by reference to the font name and
       symbol number within that font.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       CALL NGWSYM(FTYPE,NUM,X,Y,SIZE,ICOLOR,IALT)

</pre><h4><b>C-BINDING</b> <b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;ncarg/ncargC.h&gt;

       void c_ngwsym(char *ftype, int num, float x, float y,
       float size, int icolor, int ialt)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       FTYPE       (an input parameter of type CHARACTER) specifying the desired font.  Legal values are:

                   'WW'   -  Present weather.

                   'C'    -  Cloud types.

                   'CL'   -  Low clouds.

                   'CM'   -  Medium clouds.

                   'CH'   -  High clouds.

                   'W'    -  Past weather.

                   'N'    -  Sky cover.

                   'a'    -  Pressure tendency.

       NUM         (an  input  parameter of type INTEGER) specifying the number of the desired symbol within the
                   specified font.

       X           (an input parameter of type REAL) specifying the X coordinate position, in world coordinates,
                   where the symbol is to be positioned.  This X position marks the  horizontal  center  of  the
                   symbol.

       Y           (an input parameter of type REAL) specifying the Y coordinate position, in world coordinates,
                   where  the  symbol  is  to  be  positioned.  This Y position marks the vertical center of the
                   symbol.

       SIZE        (an input parameter of type REAL) the value of which is the height, in world coordinates,  of
                   the symbol.

       ICOLOR      (an  input  parameter  of  type INTEGER) the value of which is the GKS color index specifying
                   what color the symbol will be.

       IALT        (an input parameter of type INTEGER) indicating whether an alternate representation  for  the
                   specified  symbol is to be used.   If IALT=1, then the alternate symbol for the one specified
                   is drawn.  This applies only to a few symbols such as numbers 7, 93, 94, 95,  97  in  the  WW
                   font and number 3 in the W font.

</pre><h4><b>C-BINDING</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The C binding argument descriptions are the same as the FORTRAN argument descriptions.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       This  function  simply  looks  up  the  appropriate  symbol  in either font 36 or 37 of Plotchar and uses
       Plotchar to draw the symbol.

       To produce a table of all the weather symbols broken down by font and  symbol  number,  execute  "ncargex
       fngwsym".

       For the WW (present weather) font, the descriptions for the symbols are:

       CALL NGWSYM('N',5,.5,.5,.25,1,0)

              color.

       CALL NGWSYM('a',6,.2,.8,.3,1,0)
              Plots the symbol for barometric pressure that is falling then steady.

       CALL NGWSYM('WW',95,.5,.5,.2,1,1)
              Plots the alternate symbol for slight or moderate thunderstorm without hail.

</pre><h4><b>ACCESS</b></h4><pre>
       To  use NGWSYM or c_ngwsym, load the NCAR Graphics libraries ncarg, ncarg_gks, and ncarg_c, preferably in
       that order.

</pre><h4><b>MESSAGES</b></h4><pre>
       If an illegal font, or symbol number within a font, is requested, then a warning is issued.
