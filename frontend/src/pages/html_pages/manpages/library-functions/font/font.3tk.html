</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       font - Create and inspect fonts.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>font</b> <u>option</u> ?<u>arg</u> <u>...</u>?
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>font</b>  command  provides  several facilities for dealing with fonts, such as defining named fonts and
       inspecting the actual attributes of a font.  The command has several different forms, determined  by  the
       first argument.  The following forms are currently supported:

       <b>font</b> <b>actual</b> <u>font</u> ?<b>-displayof</b> <u>window</u>? ?<u>option</u>? ?<b>--</b>? ?<u>char</u>?
              Returns  information  about  the actual attributes that are obtained when <u>font</u> is used on <u>window</u>'s
              display; the actual attributes obtained may differ from the attributes requested due to  platform-
              dependent  limitations, such as the availability of font families and point sizes.  <u>font</u> is a font
              description; see <b>FONT</b> <b>DESCRIPTIONS</b> below.  If the <u>window</u> argument is omitted, it defaults  to  the
              main  window.   If <u>option</u> is specified, returns the value of that attribute; if it is omitted, the
              return value is a list of all the attributes and their values.  See <b>FONT</b> <b>OPTIONS</b> below for a  list
              of  the possible attributes.  If the <u>char</u> argument is supplied, it must be a single character. The
              font attributes returned will be those of the specific font used to render that  character,  which
              will  be  different  from the base font if the base font does not contain the given character.  If
              <u>char</u> may be a hyphen, it should be preceded by <b>--</b> to distinguish it from a misspelled <u>option</u>.

       <b>font</b> <b>configure</b> <u>fontname</u> ?<u>option</u>? ?<u>value</u> <u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>...</u>?
              Query or modify the desired attributes for the named  font  called  <u>fontname</u>.   If  no  <u>option</u>  is
              specified,  returns  a list describing all the options and their values for <u>fontname</u>.  If a single
              <u>option</u> is specified with no <u>value</u>, then returns the current value of that attribute.   If  one  or
              more  <u>option</u>-<u>value</u> pairs are specified, then the command modifies the given named font to have the
              given values; in this case, all widgets using that font will redisplay themselves  using  the  new
              attributes for the font.  See <b>FONT</b> <b>OPTIONS</b> below for a list of the possible attributes.

              Note  that on Aqua/macOS, the system fonts (see <b>PLATFORM</b> <b>SPECIFIC</b> <b>FONTS</b> below) may not be actually
              altered because they are implemented by the system theme. To achieve the effect  of  modification,
              use  <b>font</b> <b>actual</b> to get their configuration and <b>font</b> <b>create</b> to synthesize a copy of the font which
              can be modified.

       <b>font</b> <b>create</b> ?<u>fontname</u>? ?<u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>...</u>?
              Creates a new named font and returns its name.  <u>fontname</u> specifies the name for the font; if it is
              omitted, then Tk generates a new name of the form <b>font</b><u>x</u>, where <u>x</u> is an integer.  There may be  any
              number  of  <u>option</u>-<u>value</u>  pairs, which provide the desired attributes for the new named font.  See
              <b>FONT</b> <b>OPTIONS</b> below for a list of the possible attributes.

       <b>font</b> <b>delete</b> <u>fontname</u> ?<u>fontname</u> <u>...</u>?
              Delete the specified named fonts.  If there are widgets using the named font, the named font  will
              not  actually  be  deleted  until  all the instances are released.  Those widgets will continue to
              display using the last known values for the named font.  If a deleted named font  is  subsequently
              recreated  with another call to <b>font</b> <b>create</b>, the widgets will use the new named font and redisplay
              themselves using the new attributes of that font.

       <b>font</b> <b>families</b> ?<b>-displayof</b> <u>window</u>?
              The return value is a list of the case-insensitive names  of  all  font  families  that  exist  on
              <u>window</u>'s display.  If the <u>window</u> argument is omitted, it defaults to the main window.

       <b>font</b> <b>measure</b> <u>font</u> ?<b>-displayof</b> <u>window</u>? <u>text</u>
              Measures the amount of space the string <u>text</u> would use in the given <u>font</u> when displayed in <u>window</u>.
              <u>font</u>  is  a  font description; see <b>FONT</b> <b>DESCRIPTIONS</b> below.  If the <u>window</u> argument is omitted, it
              defaults to the main window.  The return value is the total width in pixels of <u>text</u>, not including
              the extra pixels used by highly exaggerated  characters  such  as  cursive  “f”.   If  the  string
              contains  newlines  or tabs, those characters are not expanded or treated specially when measuring
              the string.

       <b>font</b> <b>metrics</b> <u>font</u> ?<b>-displayof</b> <u>window</u>? ?<u>option</u>?
              Returns information about the metrics (the font-specific data),  for  <u>font</u>  when  it  is  used  on
              <u>window</u>'s  display.   <u>font</u>  is  a  font  description;  see  <b>FONT</b> <b>DESCRIPTIONS</b> below.  If the <u>window</u>
              argument is omitted, it defaults to the main window.  If <u>option</u> is specified, returns the value of
              that metric; if it is omitted, the return value is a list of all the  metrics  and  their  values.
              See <b>FONT</b> <b>METRICS</b> below for a list of the possible metrics.

       <b>font</b> <b>names</b>
              The return value is a list of all the named fonts that are currently defined.

</pre><h4><b>FONT</b> <b>DESCRIPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following formats are accepted as a font description anywhere <u>font</u> is specified as an argument above;
       these same forms are also permitted when specifying the <b>-font</b> option for widgets.

       [1] <u>fontname</u>
              The name of a named font, created using the <b>font</b> <b>create</b> command.  When a widget uses a named font,
              it  is guaranteed that this will never cause an error, as long as the named font exists, no matter
              what potentially invalid or meaningless set of attributes the named font has.  If the  named  font
              cannot  be  displayed  with  exactly  the  specified  attributes,  some  other  close font will be
              substituted automatically.

       [2] <u>systemfont</u>
              The platform-specific name of a font, interpreted by the graphics  server.   This  also  includes,
              under  X, an XLFD (see [4]) for which a single “<b>*</b>” character was used to elide more than one field
              in the middle of the name.  See <b>PLATFORM</b> <b>SPECIFIC</b> <b>FONTS</b> for a list of the system fonts.

       [3] <u>family</u> ?<u>size</u>? ?<u>style</u>? ?<u>style</u> <u>...</u>?
              A properly formed list whose first element is the desired font <u>family</u> and  whose  optional  second
              element  is  the  desired  <u>size</u>.   The interpretation of the <u>size</u> attribute follows the same rules
              described for <b>-size</b> in <b>FONT</b> <b>OPTIONS</b> below.  Any additional optional arguments following  the  <u>size</u>
              are font <u>style</u>s.  Possible values for the <u>style</u> arguments are as follows:

                     <b>normal</b>      <b>bold</b>        <b>roman</b>      <b>italic</b>
                     <b>underline</b>   <b>overstrike</b>

       [4] X-font names (XLFD)
              A            Unix-centric            font           name           of           the           form
              <u>-foundry-family-weight-slant-setwidth-addstyle-pixel-point-resx-resy-spacing-width-charset-encoding</u>.
              The “<b>*</b>” character may be used to skip individual fields that the user does not care about.   There
              must be exactly one “<b>*</b>” for each field skipped, except that a “<b>*</b>” at the end of the XLFD skips any
              remaining  fields;  the shortest valid XLFD is simply “<b>*</b>”, signifying all fields as defaults.  Any
              fields that were skipped are given default values.  For compatibility, an XLFD  always  chooses  a
              font  of  the  specified pixel size (not point size); although this interpretation is not strictly
              correct, all existing applications using XLFDs assumed that one “point” was in fact one pixel  and
              would display incorrectly (generally larger) if the correct size font were actually used.

       [5] <u>option</u> <u>value</u> ?<u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>...</u>?
              A  properly  formed list of <u>option</u>-<u>value</u> pairs that specify the desired attributes of the font, in
              the same format used when defining a named font; see <b>FONT</b> <b>OPTIONS</b> below.

       When font description <u>font</u> is used, the system attempts to parse the description according to each of the
       above five rules, in the order specified.  Cases [1] and [2] must match the name  of  an  existing  named
       font  or  of  a  system  font.   Cases  [3],  [4],  and [5] are accepted on all platforms and the closest
       available font will be used.  In some situations it may not be possible to find any close font (e.g., the
       font family was a garbage value); in that case, some system-dependent default font  is  chosen.   If  the
       font description does not match any of the above patterns, an error is generated.

</pre><h4><b>FONT</b> <b>METRICS</b></h4><pre>
       The  following  options  are used by the <b>font</b> <b>metrics</b> command to query font-specific data determined when
       the font was created.  These properties are for the whole font itself and not for  individual  characters
       drawn  in that font.  In the following definitions, the “baseline” of a font is the horizontal line where
       the bottom of most letters line up; certain letters, such as lower-case “g” stick below the baseline.

       <b>-ascent</b>
              The amount in pixels that the tallest letter sticks up above the baseline of the  font,  plus  any
              extra blank space added by the designer of the font.

       <b>-descent</b>
              The  largest amount in pixels that any letter sticks down below the baseline of the font, plus any
              extra blank space added by the designer of the font.

       <b>-linespace</b>
              Returns how far apart vertically in pixels two lines of text using the same font should be  placed
              so  that none of the characters in one line overlap any of the characters in the other line.  This
              is generally the sum of the ascent above the baseline line plus the descent below the baseline.

       <b>-fixed</b> Returns a boolean flag that is “<b>1</b>” if this is a fixed-width font, where each normal  character  is
              the  same  width  as  all the other characters, or is “<b>0</b>” if this is a proportionally-spaced font,
              where individual characters  have  different  widths.   The  widths  of  control  characters,  tab
              characters, and other non-printing characters are not included when calculating this value.

</pre><h4><b>FONT</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following options are supported on all platforms, and are used when constructing a named font or when
       specifying a font using style [5] as above:

       <b>-family</b> <u>name</u>
              The  case-insensitive  font family name.  Tk guarantees to support the font families named <b>Courier</b>
              (a monospaced “typewriter” font), <b>Times</b> (a serifed “newspaper” font), and <b>Helvetica</b> (a  sans-serif
              “European”  font).  The most closely matching native font family will automatically be substituted
              when one of the above font families is used.  The <u>name</u> may also be the name of a native, platform-
              specific font family; in that case it will work as desired on one platform  but  may  not  display
              correctly  on  other platforms.  If the family is unspecified or unrecognized, a platform-specific
              default font will be chosen.

       <b>-size</b> <u>size</u>
              The desired size of the font.  If the <u>size</u> argument is a positive number, it is interpreted  as  a
              size  in  points.   If  <u>size</u>  is a negative number, its absolute value is interpreted as a size in
              pixels.  If a font cannot be displayed at the specified size, a nearby size will  be  chosen.   If
              <u>size</u> is unspecified or zero, a platform-dependent default size will be chosen.

              Sizes should normally be specified in points so the application will remain the same ruler size on
              the  screen,  even  when changing screen resolutions or moving scripts across platforms.  However,
              specifying pixels is useful in certain circumstances such as when a piece of  text  must  line  up
              with  respect  to  a  fixed-size  bitmap.   The  mapping between points and pixels is set when the
              application starts, based on properties of the installed monitor, but  it  can  be  overridden  by
              calling the <b>tk</b> <b>scaling</b> command.

       <b>-weight</b> <u>weight</u>
              The  nominal  thickness of the characters in the font.  The value <b>normal</b> specifies a normal weight
              font, while <b>bold</b> specifies a bold font.  The closest available weight to the one specified will be
              chosen.  The default weight is <b>normal</b>.

       <b>-slant</b> <u>slant</u>
              The amount the characters in the font are slanted away from the vertical.  Valid values for  slant
              are  <b>roman</b>  and <b>italic</b>.  A roman font is the normal, upright appearance of a font, while an italic
              font is one that is tilted some number of degrees from upright.  The closest  available  slant  to
              the one specified will be chosen.  The default slant is <b>roman</b>.

       <b>-underline</b> <u>boolean</u>
              The  value  is a boolean flag that specifies whether characters in this font should be underlined.
              The default value for underline is <b>false</b>.

       <b>-overstrike</b> <u>boolean</u>
              The value is a boolean flag that specifies whether a horizontal line should be drawn  through  the
              middle of characters in this font.  The default value for overstrike is <b>false</b>.

</pre><h4><b>STANDARD</b> <b>FONTS</b></h4><pre>
       The  following  named  fonts  are  supported on all systems, and default to values that match appropriate
       system defaults.

       <b>TkDefaultFont</b>
              This font is the default for all GUI items not otherwise specified.

       <b>TkTextFont</b>
              This font should be used for user text in entry widgets, listboxes etc.

       <b>TkFixedFont</b>
              This font is the standard fixed-width font.

       <b>TkMenuFont</b>
              This font is used for menu items.

       <b>TkHeadingFont</b>
              This font should be used for column headings in lists and tables.

       <b>TkCaptionFont</b>
              This font should be used for window and dialog caption bars.

       <b>TkSmallCaptionFont</b>
              This font should be used for captions on contained windows or tool dialogs.

       <b>TkIconFont</b>
              This font should be used for icon captions.

       <b>TkTooltipFont</b>
              This font should be used for tooltip windows (transient information windows).

       It is <u>not</u> advised to change these fonts, as they may be modified by  Tk  itself  in  response  to  system
       changes. Instead, make a copy of the font and modify that.

</pre><h4><b>PLATFORM</b> <b>SPECIFIC</b> <b>FONTS</b></h4><pre>
       The following system fonts are supported:

       <b>X</b> <b>Windows</b>

                  .t insert end ${family}:\t {} \
                          "This is a simple sampler\n" f$count
                  set w [<b>font</b> <b>measure</b> [.t cget -font] ${family}:]
                  if {$w + 5 &gt; $tabwidth} {
                      set tabwidth [expr {$w + 5}]
                      .t configure -tabs $tabwidth
