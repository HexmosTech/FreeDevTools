       PDF::API2 - Create, modify, and examine PDF files

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use PDF::API2;

           # Create a blank PDF file
           $pdf = PDF::API2-&gt;new();

           # Open an existing PDF file
           $pdf = PDF::API2-&gt;open('some.pdf');

           # Add a blank page
           $page = $pdf-&gt;page();

           # Retrieve an existing page
           $page = $pdf-&gt;open_page($page_number);

           # Set the page size
           $page-&gt;size('Letter');

           # Add a built-in font to the PDF
           $font = $pdf-&gt;font('Helvetica-Bold');

           # Add an external TrueType font to the PDF
           $font = $pdf-&gt;font('/path/to/font.ttf');

           # Add some text to the page
           $text = $page-&gt;text();
           $text-&gt;font($font, 20);
           $text-&gt;position(200, 700);
           $text-&gt;text('Hello World!');

           # Save the PDF
           $pdf-&gt;save('/path/to/new.pdf');

</pre><h4><b>INPUT/OUTPUT</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>new</b>
           my $pdf = PDF::API2-&gt;new(%options);

       Create a new PDF.

       The following options are available:

       •   file

           If  you will be saving the PDF to disk and already know the filename, you can include it here to open
           the file for writing immediately.  "file" may also be a filehandle.

       •   compress

           By default, most of the PDF will be compressed to save space.   To  turn  this  off  (generally  only
           useful for testing or debugging), set "compress" to 0.

   <b>open</b>
           my $pdf = PDF::API2-&gt;open('/path/to/file.pdf', %options);

       Open an existing PDF file.

       The following option is available:

       •   compress

           By  default,  most  of  the  PDF  will be compressed to save space.  To turn this off (generally only
           useful for testing or debugging), set "compress" to 0.

   <b>save</b>
           $pdf-&gt;save('/path/to/file.pdf');

       Write the PDF to disk and close the file.  A filename is optional if one was specified while  opening  or
       creating the PDF.

       As  a  side  effect,  the document structure is removed from memory when the file is saved, so it will no
       longer be usable.

   <b>close</b>
           $pdf-&gt;close();

       Close an open file (if relevant) and remove the object structure from memory.

       PDF::API2 contains circular references, so this call is necessary in long-running processes to keep  from
       running out of memory.

       This  will  be  called  automatically  when you save or stringify a PDF.  You should only need to call it
       explicitly if you are reading PDF files and not writing them.

   <b>from_string</b>
           my $pdf = PDF::API2-&gt;from_string($pdf_string, %options);

       Read a PDF document contained in a string.

       The following option is available:

       •   compress

           By default, most of the PDF will be compressed to save space.   To  turn  this  off  (generally  only
           useful for testing or debugging), set "compress" to 0.

   <b>to_string</b>
           my $string = $pdf-&gt;to_string();

       Return the PDF document as a string.

       As a side effect, the document structure is removed from memory when the string is created, so it will no
       longer be usable.

</pre><h4><b>METADATA</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>title</b>
           $title = $pdf-&gt;title();
           $pdf = $pdf-&gt;title($title);

       Get/set/clear the document's title.

   <b>author</b>
           $author = $pdf-&gt;author();
           $pdf = $pdf-&gt;author($author);

       Get/set/clear the name of the person who created the document.

   <b>subject</b>
           $subject = $pdf-&gt;subject();
           $pdf = $pdf-&gt;subject($subject);

       Get/set/clear the subject of the document.

   <b>keywords</b>
           $keywords = $pdf-&gt;keywords();
           $pdf = $pdf-&gt;keywords($keywords);

       Get/set/clear a space-separated string of keywords associated with the document.

   <b>creator</b>
           $creator = $pdf-&gt;creator();
           $pdf = $pdf-&gt;creator($creator);

       Get/set/clear the name of the product that created the document prior to its conversion to PDF.

   <b>producer</b>
           $producer = $pdf-&gt;producer();
           $pdf = $pdf-&gt;producer($producer);

       Get/set/clear the name of the product that converted the original document to PDF.

       PDF::API2 fills in this field when creating a PDF.

   <b>created</b>
           $date = $pdf-&gt;created();
           $pdf = $pdf-&gt;created($date);

       Get/set/clear the document's creation date.

       The  date  format  is "D:YYYYMMDDHHmmSSOHH'mm", where "D:" is a static prefix identifying the string as a
       PDF date.  The date may be truncated at any point after the year.  "O" is one of "+", "-", or  "Z",  with
       the following "HH'mm" representing an offset from UTC.

       When setting the date, "D:" will be prepended automatically if omitted.

   <b>modified</b>
           $date = $pdf-&gt;modified();
           $pdf = $pdf-&gt;modified($date);

       Get/set/clear the document's modification date.  The date format is as described in "created" above.

   <b>info_metadata</b>
           # Get all keys and values
           %info = $pdf-&gt;info_metadata();

           # Get the value of one key
           $value = $pdf-&gt;info_metadata($key);

           # Set the value of one key
           $pdf = $pdf-&gt;info_metadata($key, $value);

       Get/set/clear  a  key  in the document's information dictionary.  The standard keys (title, author, etc.)
       have their own accessors, so this is primarily intended for interacting with custom metadata.

       Pass "undef" as the value in order to remove the key from the dictionary.

   <b>xml_metadata</b>
           $xml = $pdf-&gt;xml_metadata();
           $pdf = $pdf-&gt;xml_metadata($xml);

       Get/set the document's XML metadata stream.

   <b>version</b>
           $version = $pdf-&gt;version($new_version);

       Returns true if the opened PDF is encrypted.

</pre><h4><b>INTERACTIVE</b> <b>FEATURE</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>outline</b>
           $outline = $pdf-&gt;outlines();

       Creates (if needed) and returns the document's outline tree, which is also known as its bookmarks or  the
       table of contents, depending on the PDF reader.

       To examine or modify the outline tree, see PDF::API2::Outline.

   <b>open_action</b>
           $pdf = $pdf-&gt;open_action($page, $location, @args);

       Set the destination in the PDF that should be displayed when the document is opened.

       $page  may  be  either  a  page  number  or  a  page  object.   The  other parameters are as described in
       PDF::API2::NamedDestination.

   <b>page_layout</b>
           $layout = $pdf-&gt;page_layout();
           $pdf = $pdf-&gt;page_layout($layout);

       Get/set the page layout that should be used when the PDF is opened.

       $layout is one of the following:

       •   single_page (or undef)

           Display one page at a time.

       •   one_column

   <b>page_mode</b>
           # Get
           $mode = $pdf-&gt;page_mode();

           # Set
           $pdf = $pdf-&gt;page_mode($mode);

       Get/set the page mode, which describes how the PDF should be displayed when opened.

       $mode is one of the following:

       •   none (or undef)

           Neither outlines nor thumbnails should be displayed.

       •   outlines

           Show the document outline.

       •   thumbnails

           Show the page thumbnails.

       •   full_screen

           Open in full-screen mode, with no menu bar, window controls, or any other window visible.

   <b>viewer_preferences</b>
           # Get
           %preferences = $pdf-&gt;viewer_preferences();

           # Set
           $pdf = $pdf-&gt;viewer_preferences(%preferences);

       Get or set PDF viewer preferences, as described in PDF::API2::ViewerPreferences.

</pre><h4><b>PAGE</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>page</b>
            # Add a page to the end of the document
            $page = $pdf-&gt;page();

            # Insert a page before the specified page number
            $page = $pdf-&gt;page($page_number);

       Returns a new page object.  By default, the page is added to the end of the document.  If you include  an
       existing page number, the new page will be inserted in that position, pushing existing pages back.

       If  $page_number  is  -1, the new page is inserted as the second-last page; if $page_number is 0, the new
       page is inserted as the last page.

   <b>open_page</b>
           $page = $pdf-&gt;open_page($page_number);

       Returns the PDF::API2::Page object of page $page_number, if it exists.

       If $page_number is 0 or -1, it will return the last page in the document.

   <b>import_page</b>
           $page = $pdf-&gt;import_page($source_pdf, $source_page_num, $target_page_num);

       Imports a page from $source_pdf and adds it to the specified position in $pdf.

       If $source_page_num or $target_page_num is 0, -1, or unspecified, the last page in the document is used.

       <b>Note:</b> If you pass a page object instead of a page number for $target_page_num, the contents of  the  page
       will be merged into the existing page.

       <b>Example:</b>

           my $pdf = PDF::API2-&gt;new();
           my $source = PDF::API2-&gt;open('source.pdf');

           # Add page 2 from the source PDF as page 1 of the new PDF
           my $page = $pdf-&gt;import_page($source, 2);

           $pdf-&gt;save('sample.pdf');

       <b>Note:</b> You can only import a page from an existing PDF file.

   <b>embed_page</b>
           $xobject = $pdf-&gt;embed_page($source_pdf, $source_page_number);

       Returns a Form XObject created by extracting the specified page from a $source_pdf.

       This  is useful if you want to transpose the imported page somewhat differently onto a page (e.g. two-up,
       four-up, etc.).

       If $source_page_number is 0 or -1, it will return the last page in the document.

       <b>Example:</b>

           my $pdf = PDF::API2-&gt;new();
           my $source = PDF::API2-&gt;open('source.pdf');
           my $page = $pdf-&gt;page();

           # Import Page 2 from the source PDF
           my $object = $pdf-&gt;embed_page($source, 2);

           # Add it to the new PDF's first page at 1/2 scale
           my ($x, $y) = (0, 0);
           $page-&gt;object($object, $x, $y, 0.5);

           $pdf-&gt;save('sample.pdf');

       <b>Note:</b> You can only import a page from an existing PDF file.

   <b>page_count</b>
           $integer = $pdf-&gt;page_count();

       Return the number of pages in the document.

   <b>page_labels</b>
           $pdf = $pdf-&gt;page_labels($page_number, %options);

       Describes how pages should be numbered beginning at the specified page number.

           # Generate a 30-page PDF
           my $pdf = PDF::API2-&gt;new();
           $pdf-&gt;page() for 1..30;

           # Number pages i to v, 1 to 20, and A-1 to A-5, respectively
           $pdf-&gt;page_labels(1, style =&gt; 'roman');
           $pdf-&gt;page_labels(6, style =&gt; 'decimal');
           $pdf-&gt;page_labels(26, style =&gt; 'decimal', prefix =&gt; 'A-');

           $pdf-&gt;save('sample.pdf');

       The following options are available:

       •   style

           One of "decimal" (standard decimal arabic numerals),  "Roman"  (uppercase  roman  numerals),  "roman"
           (lowercase roman numerals), "Alpha" (uppercase letters), or "alpha" (lowercase letters).

           There  is no default numbering style.  If omitted, the page label will be just the prefix (if set) or
           an empty string.

       •   prefix

           The label prefix for pages in this range.

       •   start

           An integer (default: 1) representing the first value to be used in this page range.

   <b>default_page_size</b>
           # Set
           $pdf-&gt;default_page_size($size);

           # Get
           @rectangle = $pdf-&gt;default_page_size()

       Set the default physical size for pages in the PDF.  If called without arguments, return the  coordinates
       of the rectangle describing the default physical page size.

       See "Page Sizes" in PDF::API2::Page for possible values.

   <b>default_page_boundaries</b>
           # Set
           $pdf-&gt;default_page_boundaries(%boundaries);

           # Get
           %boundaries = $pdf-&gt;default_page_boundaries();

       Set  default  prepress  page  boundaries  for pages in the PDF.  If called without arguments, returns the
       coordinates of the rectangles describing each of the supported page boundaries.

       See the equivalent "page_boundaries" method in PDF::API2::Page for details.

</pre><h4><b>FONT</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>font</b>
           my $font = $pdf-&gt;font($name, %options)

       Add a font to the PDF.  Returns the font object, to be used by PDF::API2::Content.

       The font $name is either the name of one of the standard 14 fonts (e.g. Helvetica) or the path to a  font
       file.

           my $pdf = PDF::API2-&gt;new();
           my $font1 = $pdf-&gt;font('Helvetica-Bold');
           my $font2 = $pdf-&gt;font('/path/to/ComicSans.ttf');
           my $page = $pdf-&gt;page();
           my $content = $page-&gt;text();

           $content-&gt;position(1 * 72, 9 * 72);
           $content-&gt;font($font1, 24);
           $content-&gt;text('Hello, World!');

           $content-&gt;position(0, -36);
           $content-&gt;font($font2, 12);
           $content-&gt;text('This is some sample text.');

           $pdf-&gt;save('sample.pdf');

       The  path  can be omitted if the font file is in the current directory or one of the directories returned
       by "font_path".

       TrueType (ttf/otf), Adobe PostScript Type 1 (pfa/pfb), and Adobe Glyph Bitmap Distribution  Format  (bdf)
       fonts are supported.

       The following %options are available:

       •   format

           The  font format is normally detected automatically based on the file's extension.  If you're using a
           font with an atypical extension, you can set "format" to one of "truetype"  (TrueType  or  OpenType),
           "type1" (PostScript Type 1), or "bitmap" (Adobe Bitmap).

       •   kerning

           Kerning (automatic adjustment of space between pairs of characters) is enabled by default if the font
           includes this information.  Set this option to false to disable.

       •   afm_file (PostScript Type 1 fonts only)

           Specifies the location of the font metrics file.

       •   pfm_file (PostScript Type 1 fonts only)

           Specifies the location of the printer font metrics file.  This option overrides the -encode option.

       •   embed (TrueType fonts only)

           Fonts  are  embedded  in  the  PDF  by  default,  which is required to ensure that they can be viewed
           properly on a device that doesn't have the font installed.  Set this option to false to  prevent  the
           font from being embedded.

   <b>synthetic_font</b>
           $font = $pdf-&gt;synthetic_font($base_font, %options)

       Creates and returns a new synthetic font object.  See PDF::API2::Resource::Font::SynFont for details.

   <b>standard_fonts</b>
           @names = $pdf-&gt;standard_fonts()

       Returns  the  names  of  the  14  standard (built-in) fonts.  See PDF::API2::Resource::Font::CoreFont for
       details.

   <b>is_standard_font</b>
           $boolean = PDF::API2-&gt;is_standard_font($name);

       Returns true if $name is an exact, case-sensitive match for one of the standard font names.

   <b>font_path</b>
           @directories = PDF::API2-&gt;font_path()

       Return the list of directories that will be searched (in order) in addition to the current directory when
       you add a font to a PDF without including the full path to the font file.

   <b>add_to_font_path</b>
           @directories = PDF::API2-&gt;add_to_font_path('/my/fonts', '/path/to/fonts');

       Add one or more directories to the list of paths to be searched for font files.

       Returns the font search path.

   <b>set_font_path</b>
           @directories = PDF::API2-&gt;set_font_path('/my/fonts', '/path/to/fonts');

       Replace the existing font search path.  This should only be necessary if you need to remove  a  directory
       from the path for some reason, or if you need to reorder the list.

       Returns the font search path.

</pre><h4><b>GRAPHICS</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>image</b>
           $object = $pdf-&gt;image($file, %options);

       Import a supported image type and return an object that can be placed as part of a page's content:

           my $pdf = PDF::API2-&gt;new();
           my $page = $pdf-&gt;page();

           my $image = $pdf-&gt;image('/path/to/image.jpg');
           $page-&gt;object($image, 100, 100);

           $pdf-&gt;save('sample.pdf');

       $file may be either a file name, a filehandle, or a GD::Image object.

       See "place" in PDF::API2::Content for details about placing images on a page once they're imported.

       The  image  format  is  normally  detected  automatically  based  on  the  file's extension.  If passed a
       filehandle, image formats GIF, JPEG, and PNG will be detected based on the file's header.

       If the file has an atypical extension or the filehandle is for a different kind of image, you can set the
       "format" option to one of the supported types: "gif", "jpeg", "png", "pnm", or "tiff".

       Note: PNG images that include an alpha (transparency) channel go through a  relatively  slow  process  of
       splitting  the  image into separate RGB and alpha components as is required by images in PDFs.  If you're
       having performance issues, install PDF::API2::XS or Image::PNG::Libpng to speed this  process  up  by  an
       order of magnitude; either module will be used automatically if available.

   <b>barcode</b>
           $object = $pdf-&gt;barcode($format, $code, %options);

       Generate and return a barcode that can be placed as part of a page's content:

           my $pdf = PDF::API2-&gt;new();
           my $page = $pdf-&gt;page();

           my $barcode = $pdf-&gt;barcode('ean13', '0123456789012');
           $page-&gt;object($barcode, 100, 100);

           my $qr_code = $pdf-&gt;barcode('qr', '<a href="http://www.example.com">http://www.example.com</a>');
           $page-&gt;object($qr_code, 100, 300, 144 / $qr_code-&gt;width())

           $pdf-&gt;save('sample.pdf');

       $format  can  be  one of "codabar", "code128", "code39" (a.k.a. 3 of 9), "ean128", "ean13", "itf" (a.k.a.
       interleaved 2 of 5), or "qr".

       $code is the value to be encoded.  Start and stop characters are only required when  they're  not  static
       (e.g. for Codabar).

       The following options are available:

       •   bar_width

           The width of the smallest bar or space in points (72 points = 1 inch).

           If  you're  following a specification that gives bar width in mils (thousandths of an inch), use this
           conversion: "$points = $mils / 1000 * 72".

       •   bar_height

           The base height of the barcode in points.

       •   bar_extend

           If present and applicable, bars for non-printing characters (e.g. start and stop characters) will  be
           extended  downward  by this many points, and printing characters will be shown below their respective
           bars.

           This is enabled by default for EAN-13 barcodes.

       •   caption

           If present, this value will be printed, centered, beneath the barcode, and should be a human-readable
           representation of the barcode.  This option is ignored for QR codes.

       •   font

           A font object (created by "font") that will be used to print the caption, or the printable characters
           when "bar_extend" is set.

           Helvetica will be used by default.

       •   font_size

           The size of the font used for printing the caption or printable characters.

           The default will be calculated based on the barcode size, if "bar_extend" is set, or 10 otherwise.

       •   quiet_zone

           A margin, in points, that will be place before the left and bottom edges of  the  barcode  (including
           the  caption,  if  present).  This is used to help barcode scanners tell where the barcode begins and
           ends.

           The default is the width of one encoded character, or four squares for QR codes.

       •   bar_overflow

           Shrinks the horizontal width of bars by this  amount  in  points  to  account  for  ink  spread  when
           printing.  This option is ignored for QR codes.

           The default is 0.01 points.

       •   color

           Draw bars using this color, which may be any value accepted by "fillcolor" in PDF::API2::Content.

           The default is black.

       QR codes have additional options for customizing the error correction level and other niche settings.

   <b>colorspace</b>
           $colorspace = $pdf-&gt;colorspace($type, @arguments);

       Colorspaces  can be added to a PDF to either specifically control the output color on a particular device
       (spot colors, device colors) or to save space by limiting the available colors to a defined color palette
       (web-safe palette, ACT file).

       Once added to the PDF, they can be used in place of regular hex codes or named colors:

           my $pdf = PDF::API2-&gt;new();
           my $page = $pdf-&gt;page();
           my $content = $page-&gt;graphics();

           # Add colorspaces for a spot color and the web-safe color palette
           my $spot = $pdf-&gt;colorspace('spot', 'PANTONE Red 032 C', '#EF3340');
           my $web = $pdf-&gt;colorspace('web');

           # Fill using the spot color with 100% coverage
           $content-&gt;fill_color($spot, 1.0);

           # Stroke using the first color of the web-safe palette
           $content-&gt;stroke_color($web, 0);

           # Add a rectangle to the page
           $content-&gt;rectangle(100, 100, 200, 200);
           $content-&gt;paint();

           $pdf-&gt;save('sample.pdf');

       The following types of colorspaces are supported

       •   spot

               my $spot = $pdf-&gt;colorspace('spot', $tint, $alt_color);

           Spot colors are used to instruct a device (usually a printer) to use  or  emulate  a  particular  ink
           color  ($tint)  for  parts of the document.  An $alt_color is provided for devices (e.g. PDF viewers)
           that don't know how to produce the named color.  It can either be an approximation of  the  color  in
           RGB, CMYK, or HSV formats, or a wildly different color (e.g. 100% magenta, %0F00) to make it clear if
           the spot color isn't being used as expected.

       •   web

               my $web = $pdf-&gt;colorspace('web');

           The  web-safe  color  palette  is  a  historical collection of colors that was used when many display
           devices only supported 256 colors.

       •   act

               my $act = $pdf-&gt;colorspace('act', $filename);

           An Adobe Color Table (ACT) file provides a custom palette of colors that can  be  referenced  by  PDF
           graphics and text drawing commands.

       •   device

               my $devicen = $pdf-&gt;colorspace('device', @colorspaces);

           A  device-specific colorspace allows for precise color output on a given device (typically a printing
           press), bypassing the normal color interpretation performed by raster image processors (RIPs).

           Device colorspaces are also needed if you want to blend spot colors:

               my $pdf = PDF::API2-&gt;new();
               my $page = $pdf-&gt;page();
               my $content = $page-&gt;graphics();

               # Create a two-color device colorspace
               my $yellow = $pdf-&gt;colorspace('spot', 'Yellow', '%00F0');
               my $spot = $pdf-&gt;colorspace('spot', 'PANTONE Red 032 C', '#EF3340');
               my $device = $pdf-&gt;colorspace('device', $yellow, $spot);

               # Fill using a blend of 25% yellow and 75% spot color
               $content-&gt;fill_color($device, 0.25, 0.75);

               # Stroke using 100% spot color
               $content-&gt;stroke_color($device, 0, 1);

               # Add a rectangle to the page
               $content-&gt;rectangle(100, 100, 200, 200);
               $content-&gt;paint();

               $pdf-&gt;save('sample.pdf');

   <b>egstate</b>
           $resource = $pdf-&gt;egstate();

       Creates and returns a new extended graphics state object, described in PDF::API2::ExtGState.

</pre><h4><b>BACKWARD</b> <b>COMPATIBILITY</b></h4><pre>
       Code written using PDF::API2 should continue to work unchanged for  the  life  of  most  long-term-stable
       (LTS)  server  distributions.   Specifically,  it  should continue working for versions of Perl that were
       released within the past five years (the typical  support  window  for  LTS  releases)  plus  six  months
       (allowing plenty of time for package freezes prior to release).

       In PDF::API2, method names, options, and functionality change over time.  Functionality that's documented
       (not just in source code comments) should continue working for the same time period of five years and six
       months,  though  deprecation warnings may be added.  There may be exceptions if your code happens to rely
       on bugs that get fixed, including when a method in PDF::API2 is changed to more closely  follow  the  PDF
       specification.

       Occasional breaking changes may be unavoidable or deemed small enough in scope to be worth the benefit of
       making  the change instead of keeping the old behavior.  These will be noted in the Changes file as items
       beginning with the phrase "Breaking Change".

       Undocumented features, unreleased code, features marked as experimental, and underlying  data  structures
       may change at any time.  An exception is for features that were previously released and documented, which
       should continue to work for the above time period after the documentation is removed.

       Before  migrating to a new LTS server version, it's recommended that you upgrade to the latest version of
       PDF::API2, "use warnings", and check your server logs for  deprecation  messages  after  exercising  your
       code.   Once  these  are  resolved,  it  should  be safe to use future PDF::API2 releases during that LTS
       support window.

       If your code uses a PDF::API2 method that isn't documented here, it has probably been deprecated.  Search
       for it in the Migration section below to find its replacement.

</pre><h4><b>MIGRATION</b></h4><pre>
       Use this section to bring your existing code up to date with current method names and options.  If you're
       not getting a deprecation warning, this is optional, but still recommended.

       For example, in cases where a method was simply renamed, the old name will be set up as an alias for  the
       new  one, which can be maintained indefinitely.  The main benefit of switching to the new name is to make
       it easier to find the appropriate documentation when you need it.

       new(-compress =&gt; 0)
       new(-file =&gt; $filename)
           Remove the hyphen from the option names.

       <b>new()</b> with any options other than "compress" or "file"
           Replace with calls to "INTERACTIVE FEATURE METHODS".  See the  deprecated  "preferences"  method  for
           particular option names.

       finishobjects
       saveas
       update
           Replace with "save".

       end
       release
           Replace with "close".

       open_scalar
       openScalar
           Replace with "from_string".

       stringify
           Replace with "to_string".

       info
           Each of the hash keys now has its own accessor.  See "METADATA METHODS".

           For  custom  keys  or  if you prefer to give the key names as variables (e.g. as part of a loop), use
           "info_metadata".

       infoMetaAttributes
           Use "info_metadata" without arguments to get a list of currently-set  keys  in  the  Info  dictionary
           (including  any  custom keys).  This is slightly different behavior from calling "infoMetaAttributes"
           without arguments, which always returns the standard key names and  any  defined  custom  key  names,
           whether or not they're present in the PDF.

           Calling  "infoMetaAttributes"  with arguments defines the list of Info keys that are supported by the
           deprecated "info" method.  You can now just call "info_metadata" with a standard or  custom  key  and
           value.

       xmpMetadata
           Replace with "xml_metadata".  Note that, when called with an argument, "xml_metadata" returns the PDF
           object rather than the value, to line up with most other PDF::API2 accessors.

       isEncrypted
           Replace with "is_encrypted".

       outlines
           Replace with "outline".

       preferences
           This  functionality  has been split into a few methods, aligning more closely with the underlying PDF
           structure.  See the documentation for each of the methods for revised option names.

           •   -fullscreen, -thumbs, -outlines

               Call "page_mode".

           •   -singlepage, -onecolumn, -twocolumnleft, -twocolumnright

               Call "page_layout".

           •   -hidetoolbar,   -hidemenubar,   -hidewindowui,    -fitwindow,    -centerwindow,    -displaytitle,
               -righttoleft,   -afterfullscreenthumbs,  -afterfullscreenoutlines,  -printscalingnone,  -simplex,
               -duplexfliplongedge, -duplexflipshortedge

               Call "viewer_preferences".

           •   -firstpage

               Call "open_action".

       openpage
           Replace with "open_page".

       importpage
           Replace with "import_page".

       importPageIntoForm
           Replace with "embed_page".

       pages
           Replace with "page_count".

       pageLabel
           Replace with "page_labels".  Remove hyphens from the argument names.  Add  "style  =&gt;  'decimal'"  if
           there wasn't a "-style" argument.

       mediabox
       cropbox
       bleedbox
       trimbox
       artbox
           Replace with "default_page_boundaries".  If using page size aliases (e.g. "letter" or "A4"), check to
           ensure that the alias is still supported (you'll get an error if it isn't).

       synfont
           Replace with "synthetic_font".

       addFontDirs
           Replace with "add_to_font_path".

       corefont
           Replace with "font".  Note that "font" requires that the font name be an exact, case-sensitive match.
           The full list can be found in "STANDARD FONTS" in PDF::API2::Resource::Font::CoreFont.

       ttfont
           Replace with "font".  Replace "-noembed =&gt; 1" with "embed =&gt; 0".

       bdfont
           Replace with "font".

       psfont
           Replace with "font".  Rename options "-afmfile" and "-pfmfile" to "afm_file" and "pfm_file".

           Note  that  Adobe  has  announced  that  their  products  no  longer support Postscript Type 1 fonts,
           effective early 2023.  They recommend using TrueType or OpenType fonts instead.

       cjkfont
       unifont
           These are old methods from back when Unicode was still new and poorly supported.  Replace  them  with
           calls to "font" using a TrueType or OpenType font that has the characters you need.

           If  you're  successfully using one of these two methods and feel they shouldn't be deprecated, please
           contact me with your use case.

       image_gd
       image_gif
       image_jpeg
       image_png
       image_pnm
       image_tiff
           Replace with "image".

       xo_code128
       xo_codabar
       xo_2of5int
       xo_3of9
       xo_ean13
           Replace with "barcode".  Replace arguments as follows:

           •   "-color": "color"

           •   "-fnsz": "font_size"

           •   "-font": "font"

           •   "-lmzn": "bar_extend"

           •   "-ofwt": "bar_overflow"

           •   "-quzn": "quiet_zone"

           •   "-zone": "bar_height"

               These options are simple renames.

           •   "-mils": "bar_width"

               This requires a conversion from mils to points.  The "bar_width" documentation has sample code to
               do the conversion.

           •   "-ean"

               Specify "ean128" as the barcode format instead of "code128".

       colorspace_act
       colorspace_web
       colorspace_separation
       colorspace_devicen
           Replace with "colorspace".

       colorspace_hue
           This is deprecated because I wasn't able to find a corresponding  standard.   Please  contact  me  if
           you're using it, to avoid having it be removed in a future release.

       default
           The optional changes in default behavior have all been deprecated.

           Replace  "pageencaps"  with calls to "save" and "restore" when embedding or superimposing a page onto
           another, if needed.

           "nounrotate" and "copyannots" will continue to work until better options are  available,  but  should
           not be used in new code.
