       Font::TTF::Font - Memory representation of a font

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       Here is the regression test (you provide your own font). Run it once and then again on the output of the
       first run. There should be no differences between the outputs of the two runs.

           $f = Font::TTF::Font-&gt;open($ARGV[0]);

           # force a read of all the tables
           $f-&gt;tables_do(sub { $_[0]-&gt;read; });

           # force read of all glyphs (use read_dat to use lots of memory!)
           # $f-&gt;{'loca'}-&gt;glyphs_do(sub { $_[0]-&gt;read; });
           $f-&gt;{'loca'}-&gt;glyphs_do(sub { $_[0]-&gt;read_dat; });
           # NB. no need to $g-&gt;update since $f-&gt;{'glyf'}-&gt;out will do it for us

           $f-&gt;out($ARGV[1]);
           $f-&gt;release;            # clear up memory forcefully!

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       A Truetype font consists of a header containing a directory of tables which constitute the rest of the
       file. This class holds that header and directory and also creates objects of the appropriate type for
       each table within the font.  Note that it does not read each table into memory, but creates a short
       reference which can be read using the form:

           $f-&gt;{$tablename}-&gt;read;

       Classes are included that support many of the different TrueType tables. For those for which no special
       code exists, the table type "table" is used, which defaults to Font::TTF::Table. The current tables which
       are supported are:

           table       Font::TTF::Table      - for unknown tables

</pre><h4><b>INSTANCE</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       Instance variables begin with a space (and have lengths greater than the 4 characters which make up table
       names).

       nocsum
           This  is  used  during  output  to  disable  the creation of the file checksum in the head table. For
           example, during DSIG table creation, this flag will be set to ensure that the file checksum  is  left
           at zero.

       noharmony
           If set, do not harmonize the script and lang trees of GPOS and GSUB tables. See Font::TTF::Ttopen for
           more info.

       nocompress
           Is  the  default  value  controlling  WOFF  output  table  compression.  If undef, all tables will be
           compressed if there is a size benefit in doing so.  It may be set to  an  array  of  tagnames  naming
           tables  that should not be compressed, or to a scalar integer specifying a table size threshold below
           which tables will not be compressed.  Note that individual Font::TTF::Table objects may override this
           default. See Font::TTF::Table for more info.

       fname (R)
           Contains the filename of the font which this object was read from.

       INFILE (P)
           The file handle which reflects the source file for this font.

       OFFSET (P)
           Contains the offset from the beginning of the read file  of  this  particular  font  directory,  thus
           providing support for TrueType Collections.

       WOFF
           Contains a reference to a "Font::TTF::Woff" object.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Font::TTF::Font-&gt;AddTable($tablename,</b> <b>$class)</b>
       Adds  the given class to be used when representing the given table name. It also 'requires' the class for
       you.

   <b>Font::TTF::Font-&gt;Init</b>
       For those people who like making fonts without reading them. This subroutine will require all  the  table
       code for the various table types for you. Not needed if using Font::TTF::Font::read before using a table.

   <b>Font::TTF::Font-&gt;new(%props)</b>
       Creates a new font object and initialises with the given properties. This is primarily for use when a TTF
       is  embedded  somewhere.  Notice  that the properties are automatically preceded by a space when inserted
       into the object. This is in order that fields do not clash with tables.

   <b>Font::TTF::Font-&gt;open($fname)</b>
       Reads the header and directory for the given font file and creates appropriate objects for each table  in
       the font.

   <b>$f-&gt;read</b>
       Reads  a  Truetype font directory starting from location "$self-"{' OFFSET'}&gt; in the file.  This has been
       separated from the "open" function to allow support for embedded TTFs for example in TTCs. Also reads the
       "head" and "maxp" tables immediately.

   <b>$f-&gt;out($fname</b> <b>[,</b> <b>@tablelist])</b>
       Writes a TTF file consisting of the tables in tablelist. The list is checked to ensure that  only  tables
       that  exist  are output. (This means that you cannot have non table information stored in the font object
       with key length of exactly 4)

       In many cases the user simply wants to output all the tables in alphabetical order.  This can be done  by
       not  including  a @tablelist, in which case the subroutine will output all the defined tables in the font
       in alphabetical order.

       Returns $f on success and undef on failure, including warnings.

       All output files must include the "head" table.

   <b>$f-&gt;out_xml($filename</b> <b>[,</b> <b>@tables])</b>
       Outputs the font in XML format

   <b>$f-&gt;XML_start($context,</b> <b>$tag,</b> <b>%attrs)</b>
       Handles start messages from the XML parser. Of particular interest to us are &lt;font&gt; and &lt;table&gt;.

   <b>$f-&gt;update</b>
       Sends update to all the tables in the font and then resets all the isDirty flags on each table. The  data
       structure in now consistent as a font (we hope).

   <b>$f-&gt;dirty</b>
       Dirties all the tables in the font

   <b>$f-&gt;tables_do(&amp;func</b> <b>[,</b> <b>tables])</b>
       Calls  &amp;func  for  each table in the font. Calls the table in alphabetical sort order as per the order in
       the directory:

           &amp;func($table, $name);

       May optionally take a list of table names in which case func is called for each  of  them  in  the  given
       order.

   <b>$f-&gt;release</b>
       Releases  ALL  of  the  memory used by the TTF font and all of its component objects.  After calling this
       method, do <b>NOT</b> expect to have anything left in the "Font::TTF::Font" object.

       <b>NOTE</b>, that it is important that you call this method on any "Font::TTF::Font" object  when  you  wish  to
       destruct  it  and  free  up  its  memory.   Internally, we track things in a structure that can result in
       circular references, and without calling '"release()"' these will not properly get cleaned  up  by  Perl.
       Once  you've  called  this  method,  though,  don't  expect  to  be  able  to  do  anything else with the
       "Font::TTF::Font" object; it'll have <b>no</b> internal state whatsoever.

       <b>Developer</b> <b>note:</b> As part of the brute-force cleanup done here, this method will throw  a  warning  message
       whenever  unexpected  key  values  are  found  within the "Font::TTF::Font" object.  This is done to help
       ensure that any unexpected and unfreed values are brought to your attention so that you  can  bug  us  to
       keep  the  module  updated  properly;  otherwise  the potential for memory leaks due to dangling circular
       references will exist.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Bugs abound aplenty I am sure. There is a lot of code here and plenty of scope.  The parts  of  the  code
       which haven't been implemented yet are:

       Post
           Version 4 format types are not supported yet.

       Cmap
           Format  type  2 (MBCS) has not been implemented yet and therefore may cause somewhat spurious results
           for this table type.

       Kern
           Only type 0 &amp; type 2 tables are supported (type 1 &amp; type 3 yet to come).

       TTC and WOFF
           The current Font::TTF::Font::out method does not support the writing of TrueType Collections or  WOFF
           files.

       DSIG
           Haven't figured out how to correctly calculate and output digital signature (DSIG) table

       In addition there are weaknesses or features of this module library

       •   There  is  very  little  (or no) error reporting. This means that if you have garbled data or garbled
           data structures, then you are liable to generate duff fonts.

       •   The exposing of the internal data structures everywhere means that doing  radical  re-structuring  is
           almost impossible. But it stop the code from becoming ridiculously large.

       Apart from these, I try to keep the code in a state of "no known bugs", which given the amount of testing
       this code has had, is not a guarantee of high quality, yet.

       For more details see the appropriate class files.
