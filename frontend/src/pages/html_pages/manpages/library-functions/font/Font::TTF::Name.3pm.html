</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Font::TTF::Name - String table for a TTF font

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Strings are held by number, platform, encoding and language. Strings are accessed as:

           $f-&gt;{'name'}{'strings'}[$number][$platform_id][$encoding_id]{$language_id}

       Notice that the language is held in an associative array due to its sparse nature on some platforms such
       as Microsoft ($pid = 3). Notice also that the array order is different from the stored array order
       (platform, encoding, language, number) to allow for easy manipulation of strings by number (which is what
       I guess most people will want to do).

       By default, $Font::TTF::Name::utf8 is set to 1, and strings will be stored as UTF8 wherever possible. The
       method "is_utf8" can be used to find out if a string in a particular platform and encoding will be
       returned as UTF8. Unicode strings are always converted if utf8 is requested. Otherwise, strings are
       stored according to platform:

       You now have to set &lt;$Font::TTF::Name::utf8&gt; to 0 to get the old behaviour.

       Apple Unicode (platform id = 0)
           Data  is  stored  as  network  ordered  UCS2. There is no encoding id for this platform but there are
           language ids as per Mac language ids.

       Mac (platform id = 1)
           Data is stored as 8-bit binary data, leaving the interpretation to the user according to encoding id.

       Unicode (platform id = 2)
           Currently stored as 16-bit network ordered UCS2. Upon release of Perl 5.005 this will change to  utf8
           assuming current UCS2 semantics for all encoding ids.

       Windows (platform id = 3)
           As  per  Unicode,  the  data is currently stored as 16-bit network ordered UCS2. Upon release of Perl
           5.005 this will change to utf8 assuming current UCS2 semantics for all encoding ids.

</pre><h4><b>INSTANCE</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       strings
           An array of arrays, etc.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>$t-&gt;read</b>
       Reads all the names into memory

   <b>$t-&gt;out($fh)</b>
       Writes out all the strings

   <b>$t-&gt;XML_element($context,</b> <b>$depth,</b> <b>$key,</b> <b>$value)</b>
       Outputs the string element in nice XML (which is all the table really!)

   <b>$t-&gt;XML_end($context,</b> <b>$tag,</b> <b>%attrs)</b>
       Store strings in the right place

   <b>$t-&gt;minsize()</b>
       Returns the minimum size this table can be. If it is smaller than this, then the table must  be  bad  and
       should be deleted or whatever.

   <b>is_utf8($pid,</b> <b>$eid)</b>
       Returns whether a string of a given platform and encoding is going to be in UTF8

   <b>find_name($nid)</b>
       Hunts down a name in all the standard places and returns the string and for an array context the pid, eid
       &amp; lid as well

   <b>remove_name($nid)</b>
       Removes all strings with the given name id from the table.

   <b>set_name($nid,</b> <b>$str[,</b> <b>$lang[,</b> <b>@cover]])</b>
       Sets  the  given  name  id string to $str for all platforms and encodings that this module can handle. If
       $lang is set, it is interpretted as a language tag and if the particular language of a string is found to
       match, then that string is changed, otherwise no change occurs.

       If supplied, @cover should be a list of references to two-element arrays containing  pid,eid  pairs  that
       should be added to the name table if not already present.

       This function does not add any names to the table unless @cover is supplied.

   <b>Font::TTF::Name-&gt;match_lang($pid,</b> <b>$lid,</b> <b>$lang)</b>
       Compares  the  language  associated  to the string of given platform and language with the given language
       tag. If the language matches the tag (i.e. is equal or more defined than the given language tag)  returns
       true.  This  is  calculated by finding whether the associated language tag starts with the given language
       tag.

   <b>Font::TTF::Name-&gt;get_lang($pid,</b> <b>$lid)</b>
       Returns the language tag associated with a particular platform and language id

   <b>Font::TTF::Name-&gt;find_lang($pid,</b> <b>$lang)</b>
       Looks up the language name and returns a lang id if one exists

   <b>Font::TTF::Name-&gt;pe_list()</b>
       Returns an array of references to two-element arrays containing pid,eid pairs that already exist in  this
       name table.  Useful for creating @cover parameter to <b>set_name()</b>.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       â€¢   Unicode  type strings will be stored in utf8 for all known platforms, once Perl 5.6 has been released
           and I can find all the mapping tables, etc.
