       PDF::Builder::Resource::Font::SynFont - Module for creating temporary synthetic Fonts

       Inherits from PDF::Builder::Resource::Font

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       This module permits you to create a "new" font (loaded temporarily, but not permanently stored) based on
       an existing font, where you can modify certain attributes in the original font, such as:

           * slant/obliqueness
           * extra weight/boldness (by drawing glyph outlines at various line
             thicknesses, rather than just filling enclosed areas)
           * condense/expand (narrower or wider characters)
           * extra space between characters
           * small caps (synthesized, not using any provided with a font)
           * change the encoding

           $pdf = PDF::Builder-&gt;new();
           $cft = $pdf-&gt;font('Times-Roman');  # corefont, ttfont, etc. also works
           $sft = $pdf-&gt;synfont($cft, 'condense' =&gt; .75);  # condense by 25%

       This works for <u>corefonts</u>, <u>PS</u> <u>fonts</u>, and <u>TTF/OTF</u> <u>fonts</u>; but does not work for <u>CJK</u> <u>fonts</u> or <u>bitmapped</u>
       <u>fonts</u>.  See also "Synthetic Fonts" in PDF::Builder::Docs.

       <b>Alternate</b> <b>name:</b> "synthetic_font"

       This is for compatibility with recent changes to PDF::API2.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>new</b>
           $font = PDF::Builder::Resource::Font::SynFont-&gt;new($pdf, $fontobj, %opts)

           Returns a synfont object. $fontobj is a normal font object read in from a file, and $font is the
           modified output.

           Valid options %opts are:

           <u>encode</u>
               Changes  the  encoding of the font from its default.  See <u>Perl's</u> <u>Encode</u> for the supported values.
               <b>Warning:</b> only single byte encodings are supported. Multibyte encodings such as UTF-8 are invalid.

           <u>pdfname</u>
               Changes the reference-name of  the  font  from  its  default.   The  reference-name  is  normally
               generated automatically and can be retrieved via $pdfname=$font-&gt;<b>name()</b>.

               <b>Alternate</b> <b>name:</b> "name" (for PDF::API2 compatibility)

           <u>condense</u>
               Character  width  condense/expand factor (0.1-0.9 = condense, 1 = normal/default, 1.1+ = expand).
               It is the multiplier to apply to the width of each character.

               <b>Alternate</b> <b>names:</b> "hscale" and "slant" (for PDF::API2 compatibility)

               The <u>slant</u> option is a deprecated name in both PDF::Builder and PDF::API2.  Its value is the  same
               as  <u>condense</u> value (1 = normal, unchanged scale).  For the <u>hscale</u> option, the value is percentage
               (%), with 100 being normal, and other values 100 times the <u>condense</u>  value.   <b>Use</b>  <b>only</b>  <b>one</b>  <b>(at</b>
               <b>most)</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>three</b> <b>option</b> <b>names.</b>

           <u>oblique</u>
               Italic  or  slanted text angle (+/-) in degrees, where the character box is skewed (sheared), top
               to the right. While it's unlikely that anyone will want to slant characters  at  +/-360  degrees,
               they  should  be  aware  that  these  will  be  treated as an angle of 0 degrees (<b>deg2rad()</b> wraps
               around). 0 degrees of italic slant (obliqueness) is the default.

               <b>Alternate</b> <b>name:</b> "angle" (for PDF::API2 compatibility)

               <b>Use</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>(at</b> <b>most)</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>two</b> <b>option</b> <b>names.</b>

           <u>bold</u>
               Embolding factor (0.1+, bold=1, heavy=2, ...). It is additional  outline  <b>thickness</b>  (<b>linewidth</b>),
               which  expands  the character (glyph) outwards (as well as shrinking unfilled enclosed areas such
               as bowls and counters).  Normally, the glyph's outline is not drawn (it  is  only  filled);  this
               adds a thick outline. The units are in 1/100ths of a text unit.

               If  used  with the "synthetic_font" alternate entry name, the unit is 1/1000th of a text unit, so
               you will need a value 10 times larger than with the "synfont" entry to get the same effect.

           <u>space</u>
               Additional charspacing in thousandths of an em.

           <u>caps</u>
               Create synthetic small-caps. 0 = no, 1 = yes. These are capitals of  lowercase  letters,  at  80%
               height  and  88%  width.  Note  that  this is guaranteed to cover ASCII lowercase letters only --
               single byte encoded accented characters <u>usually</u> work, but we can make  no  promises  on  accented
               characters in general, as well as ligatures!

               <b>Alternate</b> <b>name:</b> "smallcaps" (for PDF::API2 compatibility)

               <b>Use</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>(at</b> <b>most)</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>two</b> <b>option</b> <b>names.</b>

               Note that only lower case letters which appear in the "standard" font (plane 0 for core fonts and
               PS  fonts)  will be small-capped. This may include eszett (German sharp s), which becomes SS, and
               dotless i and j which become I and J respectively. There are many other accented  Latin  alphabet
               letters  which  <u>may</u>  show  up  in  planes  1 and higher. Ligatures (e.g., ij and ffl) do not have
               uppercase equivalents, nor does a long s. If you have text which includes  such  characters,  you
               may  want to consider preprocessing it to replace them with Latin character expansions (e.g., i+j
               and f+f+l) before small-capping.
