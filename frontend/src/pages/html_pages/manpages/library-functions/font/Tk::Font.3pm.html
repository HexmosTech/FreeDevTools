</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Tk::Font - Create and inspect fonts.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>Font</b>(<u>option</u>?, <u>arg,</u> <u>arg,</u> <u>...</u>?)

           <u>$font</u>-&gt;<u>Option</u>?(<u>arg,</u> <u>arg,</u> <u>...</u>)?

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>Font</b> method provides several facilities for dealing with fonts, such as defining named fonts and
       inspecting the actual attributes of a font.  The command has several different forms, determined by the
       first argument.  The following forms are currently supported:

       <u>$font</u>-&gt;<b>actual</b>(<u>-option</u>?)
       <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>fontActual</b>(<u>font</u>?, <u>-option</u>?)
           Returns  information  about  the  actual  attributes  that  are obtained when <u>font</u> is used on <u>$font</u>'s
           display; the actual attributes obtained may differ from the attributes  requested  due  to  platform-
           dependant  limitations,  such  as  the  availability of font families and pointsizes.  <u>font</u> is a font
           description; see "FONT DESCRIPTION" below.  If  <u>option</u>  is  specified,  returns  the  value  of  that
           attribute;  if it is omitted, the return value is a list of all the attributes and their values.  See
           "FONT OPTIONS" below for a list of the possible attributes.

       <u>$font</u>-&gt;<b>configure</b>(<u>-option</u>??=&gt;<u>value</u>, <u>-option</u>=&gt;<u>value</u>, ...?)
           Query or modify the desired attributes for <u>$font</u>.   If  no  <u>-option</u>  is  specified,  returns  a  list
           describing  all  the options and their values for <u>fontname</u>.  If a single <u>-option</u> is specified with no
           <u>value</u>, then returns the current value of that attribute.  If  one  or  more  <u>option-value</u>  pairs  are
           specified,  then the method modifies the given named font to have the given values; in this case, all
           widgets using that font will redisplay themselves using the new attributes for the font.   See  "FONT
           OPTIONS" below for a list of the possible attributes.

           Note: the above behaviour differs in detail to <b>configure</b> on widgets, images etc.

       <u>$font</u> = <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>Font</b>(<u>-option</u>=&gt;<u>value</u>, ...&gt;?)
       <u>$font</u> = <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>fontCreate</b>(?<u>fontname</u>??, <u>-option</u>=&gt;<u>value</u>, ...&gt;?)
           Creates  a  new font object and returns a reference to it.  <u>fontname</u> specifies the name for the font;
           if it is omitted, then Tk generates a new name of the form <b>font</b><u>x</u>, where <u>x</u> is an integer.   There  may
           be  any  number  of  <u>option-value</u> pairs, which provide the desired attributes for the new named font.
           See "FONT OPTIONS" below for a list of the possible attributes.

           Note: the created font is <u>not</u> shared between widgets of different MainWindows.

       <u>$font</u>-&gt;<b>delete</b>
       <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>fontDelete</b>(<u>fontname</u>?, <u>fontname</u>, ...?)
           Delete the specified named fonts.  If there are widgets using the named font, the  named  font  won't
           actually  be  deleted  until  all the instances are released.  Those widgets will continue to display
           using the last known values for the named font.  If a deleted named font  is  subsequently  recreated
           with  another  call  to  <b>fontCreate</b>, the widgets will use the new named font and redisplay themselves
           using the new attributes of that font.

       <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>fontFamilies</b>
           The return value is a list of the case-insensitive names of all font families that exist on <u>$widget</u>'s
           display.

       <u>$font</u>-&gt;<b>measure</b>(<u>text</u>)
       <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>fontMeasure</b>(<u>font</u>, <u>text</u>)
           Measures the amount of space the string <u>text</u> would use in the given <u>font</u> when displayed  in  <u>$widget</u>.
           <u>font</u>  is  a  font  description; see "FONT DESCRIPTION" below.  The return value is the total width in
           pixels of <u>text</u>, not including the extra pixels used by highly exagerrated characters such as  cursive
           ``<u>f</u>''.   If  the  string  contains  newlines  or  tabs,  those characters are not expanded or treated
           specially when measuring the string.

       <u>$font</u>-&gt;<b>metrics</b>(<u>-option</u>?)
       <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>fontMetrics</b>(<u>font</u>?, <u>-option</u>?)
           Returns information about the metrics (the font-specific data), for <u>font</u> when it is used on <u>$widget</u>'s
           display.  <u>font</u> is a font description; see "FONT DESCRIPTION" below.  If <u>option</u> is specified,  returns
           the  value  of that metric; if it is omitted, the return value is a list of all the metrics and their
           values.  See "FONT METRICS" below for a list of the possible metrics.

       <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>fontNames</b>
           The return value is a list of all font objects that are currently defined for <u>$widget</u>'s MainWindow.

</pre><h4><b>FONT</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The following formats are accepted as a font description anywhere <u>font</u> is specified as an argument above;
       these same forms are also permitted when specifying the <b>-font</b> option for widgets.

       [1] <u>fontname</u>
           The name of a named font, created using the <b>fontCreate</b> method.  When a widget uses a named  font,  it
           is  guaranteed  that this will never cause an error, as long as the named font exists, no matter what
           potentially invalid or meaningless set of attributes the named font has.  If the named font cannot be
           displayed with  exactly  the  specified  attributes,  some  other  close  font  will  be  substituted
           automatically.

       [1a] <u>$font</u>
           A  font object created using the <b>Font</b> method. This is essentially the same as using a named font. The
           object is a reference to the name, and  carries  additional  information  e.g.  which  MainWindow  it
           relates to in an manner peculiar to perl/Tk.

       [2] <u>systemfont</u>
           The  platform-specific name of a font, interpreted by the graphics server.  This also includes, under
           X, an XLFD (see [4]) for which a single ``<b>*</b>'' character was used to elide more than one field in  the
           middle of the name.  See "PLATFORM-SPECIFIC ISSUES" for a list of the system fonts.

       [3] [<u>family</u>,?<u>size</u>,??<u>style</u>,??<u>style</u> <u>...</u>?]
           A  properly  formed  list  whose  first  element is the desired font <u>family</u> and whose optional second
           element is the desired <u>size</u>.  The interpretation  of  the  <u>size</u>  attribute  follows  the  same  rules
           described  for  -size  in "FONT OPTIONS" below.  Any additional optional arguments following the <u>size</u>
           are font <u>style</u>s.  Possible values for the <u>style</u> arguments are as follows:

               normal      bold    roman   italic
               underline   overstrike

       [4] X-font names (XLFD)
           A           Unix-centric            font            name            of            the            form
           <u>-foundry-family-weight-slant-setwidth-addstyle-pixel-point-resx-resy-spacing-width-charset-encoding</u>.
           The  ``<b>*</b>''  character may be used to skip individual fields that the user does not care about.  There
           must be exactly one ``<b>*</b>'' for each field skipped, except that a ``<b>*</b>'' at the end of  the  XLFD  skips
           any  remaining  fields;  the  shortest valid XLFD is simply ``<b>*</b>'', signifying all fields as defaults.
           Any fields that were skipped are given default values.  For compatibility, an XLFD always  chooses  a
           font  of  the  specified  pixel  size  (not point size); although this interpretation is not strictly
           correct, all existing applications using XLFDs assumed that one ``point'' was in fact one  pixel  and
           would display incorrectly (generally larger) if the correct size font were actually used.

       [5] <u>option</u> <u>value</u> ?<u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>...</u>?
           A  properly formed list of <u>option-value</u> pairs that specify the desired attributes of the font, in the
           same format used when defining a named font; see "FONT OPTIONS" below.

       When font description <u>font</u> is used, the system attempts to parse the description according to each of the
       above five rules, in the order specified.  Cases [1] and [2] must match the name  of  an  existing  named
       font  or  of  a  system  font.   Cases  [3],  [4],  and [5] are accepted on all platforms and the closest
       available font will be used.  In some situations it may not be possible to find any close font (e.g., the
       font family was a garbage value); in that case, some system-dependant default font  is  chosen.   If  the
       font description does not match any of the above patterns, an error is generated.

</pre><h4><b>FONT</b> <b>METRICS</b></h4><pre>
       The  following  options are used by the <b>metrics</b>/<b>fontMetrics</b> method to query font-specific data determined
       when the font was created.  These properties are for  the  whole  font  itself  and  not  for  individual
       characters  drawn  in  that  font.   In  the  following  definitions,  the  ``baseline'' of a font is the
       horizontal line where the bottom of most letters line up; certain letters, such as lower-case ``g'' stick
       below the baseline.

       <b>-ascent</b>
           The amount in pixels that the tallest letter sticks up above the baseline of the font, plus any extra
           blank space added by the designer of the font.  (<u>$font</u>-&gt;<b>ascent</b> is provided for compatibility.)

       <b>-descent</b>
           The largest amount in pixels that any letter sticks down below the baseline of  the  font,  plus  any
           extra blank space added by the designer of the font.  (<u>$font</u>-&gt;<b>descent</b> is provided for compatibility.)

       <b>-linespace</b>
           Returns  how far apart vertically in pixels two lines of text using the same font should be placed so
           that none of the characters in one line overlap any of the characters in the  other  line.   This  is
           generally the sum of the ascent above the baseline line plus the descent below the baseline.

       <b>-fixed</b>
           Returns  a  boolean  flag that is ``<b>1</b>'' if this is a fixed-width font, where each normal character is
           the the same width as all the other characters, or is ``<b>0</b>'' if this is a proportionally-spaced  font,
           where individual characters have different widths.  The widths of control characters, tab characters,
           and other non-printing characters are not included when calculating this value.

</pre><h4><b>FONT</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following options are supported on all platforms, and are used when constructing a named font or when
       specifying a font using style [5] as above:

       <b>-family</b> =&gt; <u>name</u>
           The  case-insensitive  font family name.  Tk guarantees to support the font families named <b>Courier</b> (a
           monospaced ``typewriter'' font), <b>Times</b> (a serifed ``newspaper'' font), and  <b>Helvetica</b>  (a  sans-serif
           ``European''  font).   The most closely matching native font family will automatically be substituted
           when one of the above font families is used.  The <u>name</u> may also be the name of  a  native,  platform-
           specific  font  family;  in  that  case  it  will work as desired on one platform but may not display
           correctly on other platforms.  If the family is  unspecified  or  unrecognized,  a  platform-specific
           default font will be chosen.

       <b>-size</b> =&gt; <u>size</u>
           The desired size of the font.  If the <u>size</u> argument is a positive number, it is interpreted as a size
           in  points.  If <u>size</u> is a negative number, its absolute value is interpreted as a size in pixels.  If
           a font cannot be displayed at the specified  size,  a  nearby  size  will  be  chosen.   If  <u>size</u>  is
           unspecified or zero, a platform-dependent default size will be chosen.

           The  original  Tcl/Tk authors believe sizes should normally be specified in points so the application
           will remain the same ruler size on the screen,  even  when  changing  screen  resolutions  or  moving
           scripts  across  platforms.  While  this is an admirable goal it does not work as well in practice as
           they hoped.  The mapping between points and  pixels is set when  the  application  starts,  based  on
           alleged  properties  of  the  installed  monitor,  but  it  can be overridden by calling the  scaling
           command. However this can be problematic when system has no way of telling if (say)  an  11"  or  22"
           monitor  is attached, also if it <u>can</u> tell then some monitor sizes may result in poorer quality scaled
           fonts being used rather than a "tuned" bitmap font.  In  addition  specifying  pixels  is  useful  in
           certain circumstances such as when a piece of text must line up with respect to a fixed-size bitmap.

           At  present  the  Tcl/Tk  scheme is used unchanged, with "point" size being returned by <u>actual</u> (as an
           integer), and used internally. Suggestions for work-rounds to undesirable behaviour welcome.

       <b>-weight</b> =&gt; <u>weight</u>
           The nominal thickness of the characters in the font.  The value  <b>normal</b>  specifies  a  normal  weight
           font,  while  <b>bold</b>  specifies a bold font.  The closest available weight to the one specified will be
           chosen.  The default weight is <b>normal</b>.

       <b>-slant</b> =&gt; <u>slant</u>
           The amount the characters in the font are slanted away from the vertical.  Valid values for slant are
           <b>roman</b> and <b>italic</b>.  A roman font is the normal, upright appearance of a font, while an italic font  is
           one  that  is  tilted  some  number  of degrees from upright.  The closest available slant to the one
           specified will be chosen.  The default slant is <b>roman</b>.

       <b>-underline</b> =&gt; <u>boolean</u>
           The value is a boolean flag that specifies whether characters in this font should be underlined.  The
           default value for underline is <b>false</b>.

       <b>-overstrike</b> =&gt; <u>boolean</u>
           The value is a boolean flag that specifies whether a horizontal line  should  be  drawn  through  the
           middle of characters in this font.  The default value for overstrike is <b>false</b>.

</pre><h4><b>PLATFORM-SPECIFIC</b> <b>ISSUES</b></h4><pre>
       The following named system fonts are supported:

       X Windows:
           All valid X font names, including those listed by <b><a href="../man1/xlsfonts.1.html">xlsfonts</a></b>(1), are available.

       MS Windows:
            system       ansi       device
            systemfixed  ansifixed  oemfixed

       Macintosh:
            system       application

</pre><h4><b>COMPATIBILITY</b> <b>WITH</b> <b>PREVIOUS</b> <b>VERSIONS</b></h4><pre>
       In  prior  versions  of  perl/Tk  the <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>Font</b> method was a perl wrapper on the original "[4] X-font
       names (XLFD)" style as described above (which was the only form supported by versions of core tk prior to
       version tk8.0).  This module is provided in its original form (it has just been renamed) via:

        use Tk::X11Font;
        I&lt;$widget&gt;-E&lt;gt&gt;B&lt;X11Font&gt;(...)

       However the methods of the old scheme have been mimiced as closely as possible with the new scheme. It is
       intended that code should work without modification, except for the case of using :

         @names = $font-&gt;Name;

       i.e. the <u>Name</u> method in an array/list context. This now returns one element on all platforms (as  it  did
       on  Win32),  while  previously  on  X systems it returned a list of fonts that matched an under-specified
       pattern.

       Briefly the methods supported for compatibility are as follows:

       $newfont = <u>$font</u>-&gt;<b>Clone</b>(<u>-option</u>=&gt;<u>value</u>, ...&gt;?)
           Returns a new font object <u>$newfont</u> related to the original  <u>$font</u>  by  changing  the  values  of  the
           specified <u>-option</u>s.

       <u>$font</u>-&gt;Family - maps to -family
       <u>$font</u>-&gt;Weight - maps to -weight
       <u>$font</u>-&gt;Slant - maps to -slant
       <u>$font</u>-&gt;Pixel and Point - map to -size

       New code should use <u>$font</u>-&gt;<b>configure</b> to achieve same effect as last four items above.

       Foundry, Swidth, Adstyle, Xres, Yres, Space, Avgwidth, Registry, Encoding
           Are all ignored if set, and return '*' if queried.

       <u>$font</u>-&gt;<b>Name</b>
           Returns  the  name  of  a named font, or a string representation of an unnamed font. Using <u>$font</u> in a
           scalar context does the same. Note this is distinctly different from behaviour of X11Font's Name in a
           list context.

       <u>$font</u>-&gt;<b>Pattern</b>
           Returns a XLFD string for the font based on <u>actual</u> values, and some heuristics to map Tk's  forms  to
           the "standard" X conventions.
