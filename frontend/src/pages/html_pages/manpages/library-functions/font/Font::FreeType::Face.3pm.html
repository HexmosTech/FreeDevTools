</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Font::FreeType::Face - font typefaces loaded from Font::FreeType

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Font::FreeType;

           my $freetype = Font::FreeType-&gt;new;
           my $face = $freetype-&gt;face('Vera.ttf');

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This class represents a font face (or typeface) loaded from a font file.  Usually a face represents all
       the information in the font file (such as a TTF file), although it is possible to have multiple faces in
       a single file.

       Never 'use' this module directly; the class is loaded automatically from Font::FreeType.  Use the
       "Font::FreeType-&gt;face()" method to create a new Font::FreeType::Face object from a filename.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       Unless otherwise stated, all methods will die if there is an error.

       <b>ascender()</b>
           The  height  above  the baseline of the 'top' of the font's glyphs, scaled to the current size of the
           face.

       attach_file(<u>filename</u>)
           Informs FreeType of an ancillary file needed for reading the font.  Hasn't been tested yet.

       <b>current_face_index()</b>
           The index number of the current font face.  Usually this will be zero, which  is  the  default.   See
           "Font::FreeType-&gt;face()" for how to load other faces from the same file.

       <b>descender()</b>
           The  depth below the baseline of the 'bottom' of the font's glyphs, scaled to the current size of the
           face.  Actually represents the distance moving up from the baseline, so usually negative.

       <b>family_name()</b>
           A string containing the name of the family this font claims to be from.

       <b>fixed_sizes()</b>
           In scalar context returns the number of fixed sizes (of embedded bitmaps) available in the font.   In
           list  context returns a list of hashes which detail those sizes.  Each hash can contain the following
           keys, but they will be absent if the information isn't available:

           size
               Size of the glyphs in points.  Only available with Freetype 2.1.5 or newer.

           height
               Height of the bitmaps in pixels.

           width
               Width of the bitmaps in pixels.

           x_res_dpi, y_res_dpi
               Resolution the bitmaps were designed for, in dots per inch.  Only available with  Freetype  2.1.5
               or newer.

           x_res_ppem, y_res_ppem
               Resolution  the  bitmaps were designed for, in pixels per em.  Only available with Freetype 2.1.5
               or newer.

       foreach_char(<u>code-ref</u>)
           Iterates through all the characters in the font, and calls <u>code-ref</u> for each of them in turn.  Glyphs
           which don't correspond to Unicode characters are ignored.

           Each time your callback code is called, $_ will be set to  a  Font::FreeType::Glyph  object  for  the
           current glyph.  For an example see the program <u>list-characters.pl</u> provided in the distribution.

       foreach_glyph(<u>code-ref</u>)
           Iterates through all the glyphs in the font, and calls <u>code-ref</u> for each of them in turn.

           Each  time  your  callback  code  is called, $_ will be set to a Font::FreeType::Glyph object for the
           current glyph.

       glyph_from_char(<u>character</u>, <u>fallback</u> <u>=</u> <u>0</u>)
           Returns a Font::FreeType::Glyph object for the glyph corresponding to  the  first  character  in  the
           string  provided.   Note that currently non-ASCII characters are not likely to work with this, so you
           might be better using the glyph_from_char_code() method below and the Perl "ord" function.

           Returns <u>undef</u> if the glyph is not available in the font and <u>fallback</u> isn't defined;  otherwise,  i.e.
           if <u>fallback</u> <u>=</u> <u>true</u> returns fonts <u>missing</u> <u>glyph</u>.

       glyph_from_char_code(<u>char-code</u>, <u>fallback</u> <u>=</u> <u>0</u>)
           Returns  a  Font::FreeType::Glyph  object for the glyph corresponding to Unicode character <u>char-code</u>.
           FreeType supports using other character sets, but this module doesn't yet.

           Returns <u>undef</u> if the glyph is not available in the font and <u>fallback</u> isn't defined;  otherwise,  i.e.
           if <u>fallback</u> <u>=</u> <u>true</u> returns fonts <u>missing</u> <u>glyph</u>.

       get_name_index(<u>name</u>)
           Looks  up  a glyph by name and returns the index for that glyph in the font. Returns 0 if the name is
           not found.

       glyph_from_index(<u>index</u>)
           Returns a Font::FreeType::Glyph object for the glyph at the given index.

       glyph_from_name(<u>name</u>, <u>fallback</u> <u>=</u> <u>0</u>)
           Looks up a glyph by name and returns a Font::FreeType::Glyph object.

           Returns <u>undef</u> if the glyph is not available in the font and <u>fallback</u> isn't defined;  otherwise,  i.e.
           if <u>fallback</u> <u>=</u> <u>true</u> returns fonts <u>missing</u> <u>glyph</u>.

       <b>has_glyph_names()</b>
           True  if  individual  glyphs have names.  If so, the names can be retrieved with the name() method on
           Font::FreeType::Glyph objects.

           See also has_reliable_glyph_names() below.

       <b>has_horizontal_metrics()</b>
       <b>has_vertical_metrics()</b>
           These return true if the font contains metrics for the corresponding directional layout.  Most  fonts
           will  contain  horizontal  metrics,  describing (for example) how the characters should be spaced out
           across a page when being written horizontally like English.  Some fonts, such as  Chinese  ones,  may
           contain vertical metrics as well, allowing typesetting down the page.

       <b>has_kerning()</b>
           True if the font provides kerning information.  See the kerning() method below.

       <b>has_reliable_glyph_names()</b>
           True  if the font contains reliable PostScript glyph names.  Some Some fonts contain bad glyph names.
           This method always returns false when used with Freetype versions earlier than 2.1.1.

           See also has_glyph_names() above.

       <b>height()</b>
           The line height of the text, i.e. distance between baselines of two lines of text.

       <b>is_bold()</b>
           True if the font claims to be in a bold style.

       <b>is_fixed_width()</b>
           True if all the characters in the font are the same width.  Will be true for  monospaced  fonts  like
           Courier.

       <b>is_italic()</b>
           Returns true if the font claims to be in an italic style.

       <b>is_scalable()</b>
           True  if  the  font  has a scalable outline, meaning it can be rendered nicely at virtually any size.
           Returns false for bitmap fonts.

       <b>is_sfnt()</b>
           True if the font file is in the 'sfnt' format, meaning it is either TrueType or OpenType.  This isn't
           much use yet, but future versions of this library might provide access  to  extra  information  about
           sfnt fonts.

       kerning(<u>left-glyph-index</u>, <u>right-glyph-index</u>, [<u>mode</u>])
           Returns the suggested kerning adjustment between two glyphs.  When called in scalar context returns a
           single  value, which should be added to the position of the second glyph on the <u>x</u> axis for horizontal
           layouts, or the <u>y</u> axis for vertical layouts.

           Note: currently always returns the <u>x</u> axis kerning, but this will be fixed when vertical  layouts  are
           handled properly.

           For example, assuming $left and $right are two Font::FreeType::Glyph objects:

               my $kern_distance = $face-&gt;kerning($left-&gt;index, $right-&gt;index);

           In list context this returns two values corresponding to the <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> axes, which should be treated in
           the same way.

           The "mode" argument controls how the kerning is calculated, with the following options available:

           FT_KERNING_DEFAULT
               Grid-fitting  (hinting)  and scaling are done.  Use this when rendering glyphs to bitmaps to make
               the kerning take the resolution of the output in to account.

           FT_KERNING_UNFITTED
               Scaling is done, but not hinting.  Use this when extracting the outlines of glyphs.  If you  used
               the  "FT_LOAD_NO_HINTING"  option  when  creating  the  face  then  use this when calculating the
               kerning.

           FT_KERNING_UNSCALED
               Leave the measurements in font units, without scaling, and without hinting.

       <b>load_flags()</b>
           Retrieve the <u>load_flags</u> option used.

       load_flags(<u>load_flags</u>)
           Setting the <u>load_flags</u> option. Returns the newly set value.

       <b>number_of_faces()</b>
           The number of faces contained in the file from which this one was created.   Usually  there  is  only
           one.  See "Font::FreeType-&gt;face()" for how to load the others if there are more.

       <b>number_of_glyphs()</b>
           The number of glyphs in the font face.

       <b>postscript_name()</b>
           A string containing the PostScript name of the font, or <u>undef</u> if it doesn't have one.

       set_char_size(<u>width</u>, <u>height</u>, <u>x_res</u>, <u>y_res</u>)
           Set  the  size  at which glyphs should be rendered.  Metrics are also scaled to match.  The width and
           height will usually be the same, and are in points.  The resolution is in dots-per-inch.

           When generating PostScript outlines a resolution of 72 will scale to PostScript points.

       set_pixel_size(<u>width</u>, <u>height</u>)
           Set the size at which bitmapped fonts will be loaded.  Bitmap fonts  are  automatically  set  to  the
           first available standard size, so this usually isn't needed.

       <b>style_name()</b>
           A  string  describing the style of the font, such as 'Roman' or 'Demi Bold'.  Most TrueType fonts are
           just 'Regular'.

       <b>underline_position()</b>
       <b>underline_thickness()</b>
           The suggested position and thickness of underlining for the font, or <u>undef</u> if the  information  isn't
           provided.  Currently in font units, but this is likely to be changed in a future version.

       <b>units_per_em()</b>
           The  size  of  the  em  square  used  by  the font designer.  This can be used to scale font-specific
           measurements to the right size, although that's usually done for you by FreeType.   Usually  this  is
           2048 for TrueType fonts.

       <b>charmap()</b>
           The current active charmap for this face.

       <b>charmaps()</b>
           An array of the charmaps of the face.

       <b>bounding_box()</b>
           The outline's bounding box for this face.
