       Font::FreeType::Glyph - glyphs from font typefaces loaded from Font::FreeType

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Font::FreeType;

           my $freetype = Font::FreeType-&gt;new;
           my $face = $freetype-&gt;face('Vera.ttf');
           $face-&gt;set_char_size(24, 24, 100, 100);

           my $glyph = $face-&gt;glyph_from_char('A');
           my $glyph = $face-&gt;<a href="../man65/glyph_from_char_code.65.html">glyph_from_char_code</a>(65);

           # Render into an array of strings, one byte per pixel.
           my ($bitmap, $left, $top) = $glyph-&gt;bitmap;

           # Read vector outline.
           $glyph-&gt;outline_decompose(
               move_to =&gt; sub { ... },
               line_to =&gt; sub { ... },
               conic_to =&gt; sub { ... },
               cubic_to =&gt; sub { ... },
           );

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This class represents an individual glyph (character image) loaded from a font.  See Font::FreeType::Face
       for how to obtain a glyph object, in particular the glyph_from_char_code() and glyph_from_char() methods.

       Things you an do with glyphs include:

       •   Get metadata about the glyph, such as the size of its image and other metrics.

       •   Render  a  bitmap  image of the glyph (if it's from a vector font) or extract the existing bitmap (if
           it's from a bitmap font), using the bitmap() method.

       •   Extract a precise description of the lines and curves that make up the  glyph's  outline,  using  the
           outline_decompose() method.

       For  a detailed description of the meaning of glyph metrics, and the structure of vectorial outlines, see
       &lt;<a href="http://freetype.sourceforge.net/freetype2/docs/glyphs/">http://freetype.sourceforge.net/freetype2/docs/glyphs/</a>&gt;

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       Unless otherwise stated, all methods will die if there is an error, and the metrics  are  scaled  to  the
       size of the font face.

       bitmap([<u>render-mode</u>])
           If  the glyph is from a bitmap font, the bitmap image is returned.  If it is from a vector font, then
           the outline is rendered into a bitmap at the face's current size.

           Three values are returned: the bitmap itself, the number of pixels from the origin to where the  left
           of  the area the bitmap describes, and the number of pixels from the origin to the top of the area of
           the bitmap (positive being up).

           The bitmap value is a reference to an array.  Each item in the array represents a line of the bitmap,
           starting from the top.  Each item is a string of bytes, with one byte representing one pixel  of  the
           image,  starting  from  the left.  A value of 0 indicates background (outside the glyph outline), and
           255 represents a point inside the outline.

           If antialiasing is used then shades of grey between 0 and 255 may occur.  Antialiasing  is  performed
           by default, but can be turned off by passing the "FT_RENDER_MODE_MONO" option.

           The size of the bitmap can be obtained as follows:

               my ($bitmap, $left, $top) = $glyph-&gt;bitmap;
               my $width = length $bitmap-&gt;[0];
               my $height = @$bitmap;

           The optional "render_mode" argument can be any one of the following:

           FT_RENDER_MODE_NORMAL
               The default.  Uses antialiasing.

           FT_RENDER_MODE_LIGHT
               Changes  the  hinting  algorithm  to make the glyph image closer to it's real shape, but probably
               more fuzzy.

               Only available with Freetype version 2.1.4 or newer.

           FT_RENDER_MODE_MONO
               Render with antialiasing disabled.  Each pixel will be either 0 or 255.

           FT_RENDER_MODE_LCD
               Render in colour for an LCD display, with three times as many pixels across the image as  normal.
               This mode probably won't work yet.

               Only available with Freetype version 2.1.3 or newer.

           FT_RENDER_MODE_LCD_V
               Render  in  colour  for  an  LCD display, with three times as many rows down the image as normal.
               This mode probably won't work yet.

               Only available with Freetype version 2.1.3 or newer.

       bitmap_magick([<u>render_mode</u>])
           A simple wrapper around the bitmap() method.  Renders the bitmap as  normal  and  returns  it  as  an
           Image::Magick  object,  which  can  then  be composited onto a larger bitmapped image, or manipulated
           using any of the features available in Image::Magick.

           The image is in the 'gray' format, with a depth of 8 bits.

           The left and top distances in pixels are returned as well, in  the  same  way  as  for  the  bitmap()
           method.

           This  method, particularly the use of the left and top offsets for correct positioning of the bitmap,
           is demonstrated in the <u>magick.pl</u> example program.

       bitmap_pgm([<u>render_mode</u>])
           A simple wrapper around the bitmap() method.  It renders the bitmap and  constructs  it  into  a  PGM
           (portable  grey-map)  image  file,  which it returns as a string.  The optional <u>render-mode</u> is passed
           directly to the bitmap() method.

           The PGM image returned is in the 'binary' format, with one byte per pixel.  It is  not  an  efficient
           format,  but  can  be  read  by  many image manipulation programs.  For a detailed description of the
           format see &lt;<a href="http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/doc/pgm.html">http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/doc/pgm.html</a>&gt;

           The left and top distances in pixels are returned as well, in  the  same  way  as  for  the  bitmap()
           method.

           The <u>render-glyph.pl</u> example program uses this method.

       <b>char_code()</b>
           The character code (in Unicode) of the glyph.  Could potentially return codes in other character sets
           if the font doesn't have a Unicode character mapping, but most modern fonts do.

       <b>has_outline()</b>
           True  if  the  glyph  has  a  vector  outline,  in which case it is safe to call outline_decompose().
           Otherwise, the glyph only has a bitmap image.

       <b>height()</b>
           The height of the glyph.

       <b>horizontal_advance()</b>
           The distance from the origin of this glyph to the place where the  next  glyph's  origin  should  be.
           Only  applies  to horizontal layouts.  Always positive, so for right-to-left text (such as Hebrew) it
           should be subtracted from the current glyph's position.

       <b>index()</b>
           The glyph's index number in the font.  This number is determined by  the  FreeType  library,  and  so
           isn't necessarily the same as any special index number used by the font format.

       <b>left_bearing()</b>
           The left side bearing, which is the distance from the origin to the left of the glyph image.  Usually
           positive for horizontal layouts and negative for vertical ones.

       <b>load()</b>
           Tell FreeType to load the glyph. There are very few reasons to use this as it is called implicitly if
           needed, by most of the other methods.

           A  few  of  these reasons include: timing or profiling tests of FreeType, debugging FreeType via side
           effects of glyph loading (by setting FT2_DEBUG).

       <b>name()</b>
           The name of the glyph, if the font format supports glyph names, otherwise <u>undef</u>.

       <b>outline_bbox()</b>
           The bounding box of the glyph's outline.  This box will enclose all the 'ink' that would be laid down
           if the outline were filled in.  It is calculated by studying each segment of the outline, so may  not
           be particularly efficient.

           The bounding box is returned as a list of four values, so the method should be called as follows:

               my ($xmin, $ymin, $xmax, $ymax) = $glyph-&gt;outline_bbox();

       outline_decompose(<u>%callbacks</u>)
           This method can be used to extract a description of the glyph's outline, scaled to the face's current
           size.  It will die if the glyph doesn't have an outline (if it comes from a bitmap font).

           Vector  outlines  of  glyphs are represented by a sequence of operations.  Each operation can start a
           new curve (by moving the imaginary pen position), or draw a line or curve from the  current  position
           of  the pen to a new position.  This Perl interface will walk through the outline calling subroutines
           (through code references you supply) for each operation.  Arguments are passed to your subroutines as
           normal, in @_.

           Note: when you intend to extract the outline of a glyph, always pass the "FT_LOAD_NO_HINTING"  option
           when creating the face object, or the hinting will distort the outline.

           The <u>%callbacks</u> parameter should contain three or four of the following keys, each with a reference to
           a "sub" as it's value.  The "conic_to" handler is optional, but the others are required.

           "move_to"
               Move  the  pen  to  a  new position, without adding anything to the outline.  The first operation
               should always be "move_to", but characters with disconnected  parts,  such  as  "i",  might  have
               several of these.

               The <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> coordinates of the new pen position are supplied.

           "line_to"
               Move the pen to a new position, drawing a straight line from the old position.

               The  <u>x</u>  and  <u>y</u> coordinates of the new pen position are supplied.  Depending you how you are using
               this information you may have to keep track of the previous position yourself.

           "conic_to"
               Move the pen to a new position, drawing a conic Bézier arc (also  known  as  a  quadratic  Bézier
               curve) from the old position, using a single control point.

               If  you don't supply a "conic_to" handler, all conic curves will be automatically translated into
               cubic curves.

               The <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> coordinates of the new pen position are supplied, followed by the <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> coordinates
               of the control point.

           "cubic_to"
               Move the pen to a new position, drawing a cubic Bézier arc  from  the  old  position,  using  two
               control points.

               Cubic arcs are the ones produced in PostScript by the "curveto" operator.

               The <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> coordinates of the new pen position are supplied, followed by the <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> coordinates
               of the first control point, then the same for the second control point.

           Note that TrueType fonts use conic curves and PostScript ones use cubic curves.

       postscript([<u>file-handle</u>])
           Generate PostScript code to draw the outline of the glyph.  More precisely, the output will construct
           a PostScript path for the outline, which can then be filled in or stroked as you like.

           The  <u>glyph-to-eps.pl</u>  example program shows how to wrap the output in enough extra code to generate a
           complete EPS file.

           If you pass a file-handle to this method then it  will  write  the  PostScript  code  to  that  file,
           otherwise it will return it as a string.

       <b>right_bearing()</b>
           The  distance  from  the  right  edge  of  the  glyph image to the place where the origin of the next
           character should be (i.e., the end of the  advance  width).   Only  applies  to  horizontal  layouts.
           Usually positive.

       <b>svg_path()</b>
           Turn  the  outline  of  the glyph into a string in a format suitable for including in an SVG graphics
           file, as the "d" attribute of a "path" element.  Note that because SVG's coordinate  system  has  its
           origin  in the top left corner the outline will be upside down.  An SVG transformation can be used to
           flip it.

           The <u>glyph-to-svg.pl</u> example program shows how to wrap the output in enough XML to generate a complete
           SVG file, and one way of transforming the outline to be the right way up.

           If you pass a file-handle to this method then it will write the path string to that  file,  otherwise
           it will return it as a string.

       <b>vertical_advance()</b>
           The  distance  from the origin of the current glyph to the place where the next glyph's origin should
           be, moving down the page.  Only applies to vertical layouts.  Always positive.

       <b>width()</b>
           The width of the glyph.  This is the distance from the left side to the right side,  not  the  amount
           you  should  move  along  before  placing  the  next  glyph  when  typesetting.   For  that,  see the
           horizontal_advance() method.
