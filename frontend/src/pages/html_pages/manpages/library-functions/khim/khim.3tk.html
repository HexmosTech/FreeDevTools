       khim  -  Provides  key bindings for entering international characters on a keyboard that does not support
       them

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       package require <b>Tcl</b>

       package require <b>khim</b> <b>?1.0.3?</b>

       <b>::khim::getOptions</b> <u>path</u>

       <b>::khim::getConfig</b>

       <b>::khim::setConfig</b> <u>version</u> <u>enabled</u> <u>compose</u> <u>map</u>

       <b>::khim::showHelp</b> <u>path</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This package provides a set of key bindings to allow a user to enter arbitrary characters on  a  keyboard
       that  does not support them.  It works by designating some seldom-used key of the keyboard as a "Compose"
       key (this key is distinct from any key so labeled, and is often "Pause," "F12" or "L2"), and  having  the
       "Compose"  key,  followed by a two-key sequence, have the effect of inserting some character in a widget.
       In addition, the "Compose" key, when struck twice in succession, brings up a dialog containing a  Unicode
       character map, allowing arbitrary characters to be inserted.

       The  vast  bulk  of the package's functionality is implemented in a single bindtag, <b>KHIM</b>.  An application
       can request that any text or entry widget use the package to allow for entry of arbitrary  characters  by
       placing this binding tag ahead of the <b>Text</b> or <b>Entry</b> binding tag for the widget:

              text .t -width 80 -height 24
              bindtags .t {.t KHIM Text . all}

       Note  that  the  <b>KHIM</b>  tag must precede the <b>Text</b> or <b>Entry</b> class binding, or the package will not function
       correctly.

</pre><h4><b>PROCEDURES</b></h4><pre>
       In addition to commands supporting the KHIM binding tag, the following commands  are  exported  from  the
       package:

       <b>::khim::getOptions</b> <u>path</u>
              Posts  a  top-level  modal  dialog with the path name <u>path</u> that prompts the user for KHIM options.
              The user is allowed to reconfigure the key sequences for the "Compose" key, change the  choice  of
              key to use for the "Compose" function, and enable/disable the KHIM key bindings entirely.

       <b>::khim::getConfig</b>
              Returns  a Tcl script that restores the current configuration of KHIM: the enabled/disabled state,
              the choice of "Compose" key, and the key sequences that may be composed.  This script is  designed
              to be saved to a configuration file for use in a subsequent invocation of the same application:

              # Save KHIM configuration
              set f [open <a href="file:~/.khimrc">~/.khimrc</a> w]
              puts $f [::khim::getConfig]
              close $f

              # Restore KHIM configuration
              source <a href="file:~/.khimrc">~/.khimrc</a>

       <b>::khim::setConfig</b> <u>version</u> <u>enabled</u> <u>compose</u> <u>map</u>
              Restores  an earlier saved configuration.  Few, if any, applications will call this command in any
              other way than to evaluate it as returned from <b>::khim::getConfig</b>.

       <b>::khim::showHelp</b> <u>path</u>
              Displays a top-level dialog giving user-level help for KHIM; the dialog will have  the  path  name
              <u>path</u>.

</pre><h4><b>LOCALISATION</b></h4><pre>
       Programmers  who  wish  to  make KHIM available in a non-English-speaking locale may do so by providing a
       <b>.msg</b> file with the appropriate localised text.  The catalog requires the following messages:

       <b>Apply</b>  Text that will appear on the "Apply" button in the dialog that sets KHIM options.

       <b>Cancel</b> Text that will appear on the "Cancel" button in several dialogs.

       <b>Change</b> Text that will appear on the "Change" button, which alters the  binding  of  a  pair  of  composed
              characters (creating or replacing as appropriate).

       <b>Character</b>
              Text  that  will appear on the label of the entry widget that accepts a character resulting from a
              composed sequence.

       <b>{Compose</b> <b>Key}</b>
              Window title for a dialog that prompts the user to strike the  key  that  will  be  used  for  the
              "Compose" key.

       <b>{Compose</b> <b>key:}</b>
              Label that identifies a component showing the "Compose" key choice in the KHIM options dialog.

       <b>{Composed</b> <b>sequence</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>two</b> <b>characters</b> <b>long}</b>
              Error  message  that  is  displayed  if  the  user attempts to define a "Compose" sequence that is
              shorter or longer than two characters.

       <b>Delete</b> Text for a button that deletes a "Compose" sequence.

       <b>Help...</b>
              Text for a button that displays the KHIM user help dialog.

       <b>HELPTEXT</b>
              Complete text for the user-level help for  KHIM.   Refer  to  "<u>en.msg</u>"  for  the  English-language
              version of the help.

       <b>{Input</b> <b>key</b> <b>sequence}</b>
              Text  for  a  label  of the entry widget that prompts the user for a two-character sequence to use
              with the "Compose" key.

       <b>{Insert</b> <b>Character}</b>
              Window title of the dialog box that displays a Unicode character  map  and  prompts  the  user  to
              select a character to insert.

       <b>{Key</b> <b>sequences}</b>
              Text for a label at the head of a listbox showing the composed sequences that are currently bound.

       <b>{KHIM</b> <b>Controls}</b>
              Window title for the dialog box that prompts for KHIM settings.

       <b>{KHIM</b> <b>Help}</b>
              Window title for the window that display help text for KHIM.

       <b>OK</b>     Label for the OK button on several dialogs.

       <b>Select</b> <b>code</b> <b>page:</b>
              Label for a spinbox that prompts the user for a Unicode code page number.

       <b>SELECT</b> <b>COMPOSE</b> <b>KEY</b>
              A  message, which should be composed in short lines, prompting the user to press the key that will
              become the "Compose" key in KHIM.

       <b>Unicode...</b>
              Text for a button that brings up the character map to select the character  to  which  a  composed
              sequence binds.

       <b>{Use</b> <b>KHIM}</b>
              Text  for  a  checkbutton  that  asks  whether  the user wishes to use KHIM to manage composed key
              sequences.

</pre><h4><b>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       KHIM was originally inspired by the key bindings that Brent Welch developed for the 'sedit'  editor  used
       in the 'exmh' mail user agent.  The code for KHIM is entirely separate from that for 'sedit'.
