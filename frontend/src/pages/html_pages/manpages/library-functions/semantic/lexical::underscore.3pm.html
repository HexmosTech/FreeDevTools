       lexical::underscore - access your caller's lexical underscore

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
          use 5.010;
          use lexical::underscore;
          use Test::More;

          sub is_uppercase {
             my $var = @_ ? shift : ${lexical::underscore()};
             return $var eq uc($var);
          }

          my $thing = 'FOO';
          my $works = 0;

          given ( $thing ) {
             when ( is_uppercase ) { $works++ }
          }

          ok($works);
          done_testing();

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Starting with Perl 5.10, it is possible to create a lexical version of the Perl default variable $_.
       Certain Perl constructs like the "given" keyword automatically use a lexical $_ rather than the global
       $_.

       It is occasionallly useful for a sub to be able to access its caller's $_ variable regardless of whether
       it was lexical or not. The "(_)" sub prototype is the official way to do so, however there are sometimes
       disadvantages to this; in particular it can only appear as the final required argument in a prototype,
       and there is no way of the sub differentiating between an explicitly passed argument and $_.

       This caused me problems with Scalar::Does, because I wanted to enable the "does" function to be called as
       either:

          does($thing, $role);
          does($role);  # assumes $thing = $_

       With "_" in the prototype, $_ was passed to the function at the end of its argument list; effectively
       "does($role, $thing)", making it impossible to tell which argument was the role.

       Enter "lexical::underscore" which allows you to access your caller's lexical $_ variable as easily as:

          ${lexical::underscore()}

       You can access lexical $_ further up the call stack using:

          ${lexical::underscore($level)}

       If you happen to ask for $_ at a level where no lexical $_ is available, you get the global $_ instead.

       This module does work on Perl 5.8 but as there is no lexical $_, always returns the global $_.

   <b>Technical</b> <b>Details</b>
       The "lexical::underscore" function returns a scalar reference to either a lexical $_ variable somewhere
       up the call stack (using PadWalker magic), or to the global $_ if there was no lexical version.

       Wrapping "lexical::underscore" in "${ ... }" dereferences the scalar reference, allowing you to access
       (and even assign to) it.
