</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       DBIx::Class::Manual::Reading - How to read and write DBIx::Class POD.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This doc should help users to understand how the examples and documentation found in the DBIx::Class
       distribution can be interpreted.

       Writers of DBIx::Class POD should also check here to make sure their additions are consistent with the
       rest of the documentation.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       Methods should be documented in the files which also contain the code for the method, or that file should
       be hidden from PAUSE completely, in which case the methods are documented in the file which loads it.
       Methods may also be documented and referred to in files representing the major objects or components on
       which they can be called.

       For example, DBIx::Class::Relationship documents the methods actually coded in the helper relationship
       classes like DBIx::Class::Relationship::BelongsTo. The BelongsTo file itself is hidden from PAUSE as it
       has no documentation. The accessors created by relationships should be mentioned in DBIx::Class::Row, the
       major object that they will be called on.

   <b>Method</b> <b>documentation</b>
       •   Each method starts with a "head2" statement of its name.

           Just  the  plain  method  name,  not an example of how to call it, or a link.  This is to ensure easy
           linking to method documentation from other POD.

       •   The header is followed by a two-item list. This contains a description of the arguments the method is
           expected to take, and an indication of what the method returns.

           The first item provides a list of all possible values for the  arguments  of  the  method  in  order,
           separated by ", ", preceded by the text "Arguments: "

           Example (for the belongs_to relationship):

             =item Arguments: $accessor_name, $related_class, $fk_column|\%cond|\@cond?, \%attr?

           The following possible argument sigils can be shown:

           •   $var - A scalar (string or numeric) variable.

           •   \%var - A variable containing reference to a hash.

           •   \@var - A variable containing a reference to an array.

           •   \$var - A variable containing a reference to a scalar variable.

           •   %var - A hashref variable (list of key/value pairs) - rarely used in DBIx::Class.

               Reading  an  argument  as  a hash variable will consume all subsequent method arguments, use with
               caution.

           •   @var - An array variable (list of values).

               Reading an argument as a array variable will consume all subsequent method  arguments,  use  with
               caution.

           •   $obj - Reference to the source class or object definition

               All  arguments  and  return  values  should provide a link to the object's class documentation or
               definition, even if it's the same class as the current documentation.  For example:

                 ## Correct, if stated within DBIx::Class::ResultSet
                 L&lt;$resultset|/new&gt;

                 ## Correct, if stated outside DBIx::Class::ResultSet
                 L&lt;$resultset|DBIx::Class::ResultSet&gt;

           •   ? - Optional, should be placed after the argument type and name.

                 ## Correct
                 \%myhashref|\@myarrayref?

                 ## Wrong
                 \%myhashref?|\@myarrayref

               Applies to the entire argument.

               Optional arguments can be left out of method calls, unless the caller needs to pass in any of the
               following arguments. In which case the caller  should  pass  "undef"  in  place  of  the  missing
               argument.

           •   | - Alternate argument content types.

               At least one of these must be supplied unless the argument is also marked optional.

           The  second  item  starts with the text "Return Value:". The remainder of the line is either the text
           "not defined" or a variable with a descriptive name.

             ## Good examples
             =item Return Value: not defined
             =item Return Value: L&lt;$schema|DBIx::Class::Schema&gt;
             =item Return Value: $classname

             ## Bad examples
             =item Return Value: The names

           "not defined" means the method does not deliberately return a value, and the caller should not use or
           rely on anything it does return.  (Perl functions always return something, usually the result of  the
           last  code  statement,  if there is no explicit return statement.)  This is different than specifying
           "undef", which means that it explicitly returns undef, though  usually  this  is  used  an  alternate
           return (like "$obj | undef").

       •   The argument/return list is followed by a single paragraph describing what the method does.

       •   The  description  paragraph  is  followed  by another list. Each item in the list explains one of the
           possible argument/type combinations.

           This list may be omitted if the author feels that the variable names are self-explanatory  enough  to
           not require it. Use best judgement.

       •   The  argument/return  list  is  followed by some examples of how to use the method, using its various
           types of arguments.

           The examples can also  include  ways  to  use  the  results  if  applicable.  For  instance,  if  the
           documentation is for a relationship type, the examples can include how to call the resulting relation
           accessor, how to use the relation name in a search and so on.

           If  some  of  the  examples  assume default values, these should be shown with and without the actual
           arguments, with hints about the equivalent calls.

           The example should be followed by one or more paragraphs explaining what it does.

           Examples and explaining paragraphs can be repeated as necessary.
