</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Class::DBI::Relationship - base class for Relationships

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       A Class::DBI class represents a database table. But merely being able to represent single tables isn't
       really that useful - databases are all about relationships.

       So, Class::DBI provides a variety of Relationship models to represent common database occurences (HasA,
       HasMany and MightHave), and provides a way to add others.

</pre><h4><b>SUBCLASSING</b></h4><pre>
       Relationships should inherit from Class::DBI::Relationship, and provide a variety of methods to represent
       the relationship. For examples of how these are used see Class::DBI::Relationship::HasA,
       Class::DBI::Relationship::HasMany and Class::DBI::Relationship::MightHave.

   <b>remap_arguments</b>
               sub remap_arguments {
                       my $self = shift;
                       # process @_;
                       return ($class, accessor, $foreign_class, $args)
               }

       Subclasses should define a 'remap_arguments' method that takes the arguments with which your relationship
       method will be called, and transforms them into the structure that the Relationship modules requires.  If
       this method is not provided, then it is assumed that your method will be called with these 3 arguments in
       this order.

       This should return a list of 4 items:

       class
           The  Class::DBI  subclass  to which this relationship applies. This will be passed in to you from the
           caller who actually set up the relationship, and is available for  you  to  call  methods  on  whilst
           performing this mapping. You should almost never need to change this.

           This  usually  an  entire  application base class (or Class::DBI itself), but could be a single class
           wishing to override a default relationship.

       accessor
           The method in the class which will provide access to the results of the relationship.

       foreign_class
           The class for the table with which the class has a relationship.

       args
           Any additional args that your relationship requires.  It is  recommended  that  you  use  this  as  a
           hashref to store any extra information your relationship needs rather than adding extra accessors, as
           this information will all be stored in the 'meta_info'.

   <b>triggers</b>
               sub triggers {
                       return (
                               before_create =&gt; sub { ... },
                               after_create  =&gt; sub { ... },
                       );
               }

       Subclasses  may  define  a 'triggers' method that returns a list of triggers that the relationship needs.
       This method can be omitted if there are no triggers to be set up.

   <b>methods</b>
               sub methods {
                       return (
                               method1 =&gt; sub { ... },
                               method2 =&gt; sub { ... },
                       );
               }

       Subclasses may define a 'methods' method that returns a list of methods to  facilitate  the  relationship
       that  should  be  created  in  the  calling Class::DBI class.  This method can be omitted if there are no
       methods to be set up.
