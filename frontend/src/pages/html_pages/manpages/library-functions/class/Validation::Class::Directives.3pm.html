</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Validation::Class::Directives - Validation::Class Core Directives Registry

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 7.900059

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Validation::Class::Directives provides a collection of installed Validation::Class directives. This class
       inherits from Validation::Class::Mapping. Please look at Validation::Class::Directive for information of
       developing your own directives.

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       The following is a list of core directives that get installed automatically with Validation::Class and
       can be used to jump-start your data validation initiative.  <b>Please</b> <b>Note!</b> The purpose of the core
       directives is merely to provide a reasonable layer of protection against bad/malformed data, the
       validators are not very sophisticated and were created using a minimal level of strictness (e.g. the
       email and hostname directives do not perform a hostname lookup nor does the email directive conform to
       the RFC specification).

       Various applications have varied levels of strictness regarding various types of input (e.g. a hospital
       API may require a more sophisticated SSN validation than that of a department of education API; likewise;
       an email service API may require a more sophisticated email validation than that of a file sharing API).
       Validation::Class does not attempt to provide validators for all levels of strictness and the core
       directives exist to support typical use-cases with a minimal level of strictness.
