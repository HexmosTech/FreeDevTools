</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Catalyst::Authentication::Store::DBIx::Class::User - The backing user class for the
       Catalyst::Authentication::Store::DBIx::Class storage module.

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This documentation refers to version 0.1506.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       Internal - not used directly, please see Catalyst::Authentication::Store::DBIx::Class for details on how
       to use this module. If you need more information than is present there, read the source.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The Catalyst::Authentication::Store::DBIx::Class::User class implements user storage connected to an
       underlying DBIx::Class schema object.

</pre><h4><b>SUBROUTINES</b> <b>/</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>new</b>
       Constructor.

   <b>load</b> <b>(</b> <b>$authinfo,</b> <b>$c</b> <b>)</b>
       Retrieves a user from storage using the information provided in $authinfo.

   <b>supported_features</b>
       Indicates the features supported by this class.  These are currently Roles and Session.

   <b>roles</b>
       Returns an array of roles associated with this user, if roles are configured for this user class.

   <b>for_session</b>
       Returns a serialized user for storage in the session.

   <b>from_session</b>
       Revives a serialized user from storage in the session.

   <b>get</b> <b>(</b> <b>$fieldname</b> <b>)</b>
       Returns the value of $fieldname for the user in question.  Roughly translates to a call to the
       DBIx::Class::Row's get_column( $fieldname ) routine.

   <b>get_object</b>
       Retrieves the DBIx::Class object that corresponds to this user

   <b>obj</b> <b>(method)</b>
       Synonym for get_object

   <b>auto_create</b>
       This is called when the auto_create_user option is turned on in Catalyst::Plugin::Authentication and a
       user matching the authinfo provided is not found.  By default, this will call the "auto_create()" method
       of the resultset associated with this object. It is up to you to implement that method.

   <b>auto_update</b>
       This is called when the auto_update_user option is turned on in Catalyst::Plugin::Authentication. Note
       that by default the DBIx::Class store uses every field in the authinfo hash to match the user. This means
       any information you provide with the intent to update must be ignored during the user search process.
       Otherwise the information will most likely cause the user record to not be found. To ignore fields in the
       search process, you have to add the fields you wish to update to the 'ignore_fields_in_find' authinfo
       element.  Alternately, you can use one of the advanced row retrieval methods (searchargs or resultset).

       By default, auto_update will call the "auto_update()" method of the DBIx::Class::Row object associated
       with the user. It is up to you to implement that method (probably in your schema file)

   <b>AUTOLOAD</b>
       Delegates method calls to the underlying user row.

   <b>can</b>
       Delegates handling of the "can" method to the underlying user row.
