</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       TFBS::TFFM - class for Transcription Factor Flexible Models (TFFMs)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       TFBS::TFFM is a class to hold basic information about a TFFM. It was mainly designed to store the
       information about a TFFM stored in the TFFM table of the JASPAR DB newly introduced in the JASPAR 2016
       version.  It does NOT (currently) store the actual XML describing the the model but this would be simple
       to add. At the time of this writing the relationship between JASPAR matrices as stored in the MATRIX
       table and TFFMs was not completely clear and the matrix IDs related to a TFFM are stored in the TFFM
       table. The relationship could be 1:n, m:1 or m:n in the future so this may well be changed and a joining
       table created to facilitate this.

</pre><h4><b>APPENDIX</b></h4><pre>
       The rest of the documentation details each of the object methods. Internal methods are preceded with an
       underscore.

   <b>ID</b>
        Title   : ID
        Usage   : my $id = $tffm-&gt;ID();

        Function: Get/set the ID of this TFFM.
        Returns : The ID of this TFFM.
        Args    : None for get or a new string ID.

   <b>name</b>
        Title   : name
        Usage   : my $name = $tffm-&gt;name();

        Function: Get/set the name of the transcription factor for which this TFFM
                  was modelled.
        Returns : Name of the TF modelled by this TFFM.
        Args    : None for get or a new string TF name.

   <b>experiment_name</b>
        Title   : experiment_name
        Usage   : my $filename = $tffm-&gt;experiment_name();

        Function: Get/set the name of the experimental data on which this TFFM
                  (generally ChIP-seq peak data) TFFM was trained. Often this
                  is base file name of ChIP-seq peaks file.
        Returns : Name of the experiment/datafile.
        Args    : None for get or a new experiment/datafile name.

   <b>log_p_1st_order</b>
        Title   : log_p_1st_order
        Usage   : my $log_p_val = $tffm-&gt;log_p_1st_order();

        Function: Get/set the log(p) value for the 1st order model of this TFFM.
        Returns : Log(p) value of the 1st-order model.
        Args    : None for get or a new 1st-order log(p) value.

   <b>log_p_detailed</b>
        Title   : log_p_detailed
        Usage   : my $log_p_val = $tffm-&gt;log_p_detailed();

        Function: Get/set the log(p) value for the detailed model of this TFFM.
        Returns : Log(p) value of the detailed model.
        Args    : None for get or a new detailed log(p) value.

   <b>matrix_ID</b>
        Title   : matrix_ID
        Usage   : my $matrix_id = $tffm-&gt;matrix_ID();

        Function: Get/set the ID of the matrix associated to this TFFM.
        Returns : ID of the matrix associated to this TFFM.
        Args    : None for get or a JASPAR matrix ID.

   <b>matrix</b>
        Title   : matrix
        Usage   : my $matrix = $tffm-&gt;matrix();

        Function: Get/set the matrix object related to this TFFM
        Returns : A reference to TFBS::Matrix object which was used to train the
                  TFFM.
        Args    : None for get or a new TFBS::Matrix object reference.
