</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       DBIx::Class::Storage::Statistics - SQL Statistics

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This class is called by DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI as a means of collecting statistics on its actions.
       Using this class alone merely prints the SQL executed, the fact that it completes and begin/end
       notification for transactions.

       To really use this class you should subclass it and create your own method for collecting the statistics
       as discussed in DBIx::Class::Manual::Cookbook.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>new</b>
       Returns a new DBIx::Class::Storage::Statistics object.

   <b>debugfh</b>
       Sets or retrieves the filehandle used for trace/debug output.  This should be an IO::Handle compatible
       object (only the print method is used). By default it is initially set to STDERR - although see
       discussion of the DBIC_TRACE environment variable.

       Invoked as a getter it will lazily open a filehandle and set it to autoflush (if one is not already set).

   <b>print</b>
       Prints the specified string to our debugging filehandle.  Provided to save our methods the worry of how
       to display the message.

   <b>silence</b>
       Turn off all output if set to true.

   <b>txn_begin</b>
       Called when a transaction begins.

   <b>txn_rollback</b>
       Called when a transaction is rolled back.

   <b>txn_commit</b>
       Called when a transaction is committed.

   <b>svp_begin</b>
       Called when a savepoint is created.

   <b>svp_release</b>
       Called when a savepoint is released.

   <b>svp_rollback</b>
       Called when rolling back to a savepoint.

   <b>query_start</b>
       Called before a query is executed.  The first argument is the SQL string being executed and subsequent
       arguments are the parameters used for the query.

   <b>query_end</b>
       Called when a query finishes executing.  Has the same arguments as query_start.
