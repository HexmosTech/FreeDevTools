       Class::Handle - Create objects that are handles to Classes

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         # Create a class handle
         use Class::Handle;
         my $class = Class::Handle-&gt;new( 'Foo::Class' );
         my $name = $class-&gt;name;

         # UNIVERSAL type methods
         $class-&gt;VERSION();
         $class-&gt;isa( 'Foo:Bar' );
         $class-&gt;can( 'blah' );

         # Class::Inspector type methods
         $class-&gt;installed();
         $class-&gt;loaded();
         $class-&gt;filename();
         $class-&gt;resolved_filename();
         $class-&gt;functions();
         $class-&gt;function_refs();
         $class-&gt;function_exists( 'function' );
         $class-&gt;methods( 'public', 'full' );
         $class-&gt;subclasses();

         # Class::ISA type methods
         $class-&gt;super_path();
         $class-&gt;self_and_super_path();

         # Loading and unloading
         $class-&gt;load();

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Class related functionality in Perl is broken up into a variety of different modules. Class::Handle
       attempts to provide a convenient object wrapper around the various different types of functions that can
       be performed on a class.

       Please note that this is an initial non-production quality release, and should be used as such.
       Functionality and API are subject to change without notice.

       Currently, Class::Handle provies what is effectively a combined API from "UNIVERSAL", "Class::ISA" and
       "Class::Inspector" for obtaining information about a Class, and some additional task methods, such as
       "load" to common tasks relating to classes.

</pre><h4><b>UNIVERSAL</b> <b>API</b></h4><pre>
       To ensure we maintain compliance with other classes that rely on methods provided by "UNIVERSAL",
       Class::Handle acts in the normal way when something like "&lt;Class::Handle-"VERSION&gt;&gt; is called. That is,
       it returns the version of Class::Handle itself. When "UNIVERSAL" methods are called on an instantiation
       the method is changed to act on the class we have a handle to. For example, the two following statements
       are equivalent.

         # Getting the version directly
         print Foo::Bar-&gt;VERSION;

         # Getting the version via Class::Handle
         my $class = Class::Handle-&gt;new( 'Foo::Bar' );
         print $class-&gt;VERSION;

       This also applies to the "isa" and "can" methods.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>new</b> <b>$class</b>
       The "new" constructor will create a new handle to a class or unknown existance or status. That is, it
       won't check that the class actually exists at this time. It WILL however check to make sure that your
       class name is legal.

         Returns a new Class::Handle object on success
         Returns undef if the class name is illegal

   <b>name</b>
       The c&lt;name&gt; method returns the name of the class as original specified in the constructor.

   <b>VERSION</b>
       Find the version for the class. Does not check that the class is loaded ( at this time ).

       Returns the version on success, "undef" if the class does not defined a $VERSION or the class is not
       loaded.

   <b>isa</b> <b>$class</b>
       Checks to see if the class is a subclass of another class. Does not check that the class is loaded ( at
       this time ).

       Returns true/false as for "UNIVERSAL::isa"

   <b>can</b> <b>$method</b>
       Checks to see if a particular method is defined for the class.

       Returns a "CODE" ref to the function is the method is available, or false if the class does not have that
       method available.

   <b>installed</b>
       Checks to see if a particular class is installed on the machine, or at least that the class is available
       to perl. In this case, "class" really means "module". This methods cannot detect a class that is not a
       module. ( Has its own file ).

       Returns true if the class is installed and available, or false otherwise.

   <b>loaded</b>
       Checks to see if a class is loaded. In this case, "class" does NOT mean "module". The "loaded" method
       will return true for classes that do not have their own file.

       For example, if a module "Foo" contains the classes "Foo", "Foo::Bar" and "Foo::Buffy", the "loaded"
       method will return true for all of the classes.

       Returns true if the class is loaded, or false otherwise.

   <b>filename</b>
       Returns the base filename for a class. For example, for the class "Foo::Bar", "loaded" would return
       "Foo/Bar.pm".

       The "filename" method is platform neutral, it should always return the filename in the correct format for
       your platform.

   <b>resolved_filename</b> <b>@extra_paths</b>
       The "resolved_filename" will attempt to find the real file on your system that will be used when a class
       is loaded. If additional paths are provided as argument, they will be tried first, before the contents of
       the @INC array.  If a file cannot be found to match the class, returns false.

   <b>loaded_filename</b>
       If the class is loaded, returns the name of the file that it was originally loaded from.

       Returns false if the class is not loaded, or did not have its own file.

   <b>functions</b>
       Returns a list of the names of all the functions in the classes immediate namespace. Note that this is
       not the METHODS of the class, just the functions.  Returns a reference to an array of the function names
       on success.

       Returns undef on error or if the class is not loaded.

   <b>function_refs</b>
       Returns a list of references to all the functions in the classes immediate namespace.

       Returns a reference to an array of CODE refs of the functions on success, or "undef" on error or if the
       class is not loaded.

   <b>function_exists</b> <b>$function</b>
       Checks to see if the function exists in the class. Note that this is as a function, not as a method. To
       see if a method exists for a class, use the "can" method in UNIVERSAL, and hence to every other class.

       Returns true if the function exists, false if the function does not exist, or "undef" on error, or if the
       class is not loaded.

   <b>methods</b> <b>@options</b>
       Attempts to find the methods available to the class. This includes everything in the classes super path
       up to, but NOT including, UNIVERSAL. Returns a reference to an array of the names of all the available
       methods on success.  Returns undef if the class is not loaded.

       Any provided options are passed through, and alter the response in the same way as for the options to
       "&lt;Class::Inspector-"<b>methods()</b>&gt;&gt;, that is, 'public', 'private', 'full' and 'expanded', and combinations
       thereof.

   <b>subclasses</b>
       The "subclasses" method will search then entire namespace (and thus <b>all</b> currently loaded classes) to find
       all of the subclasses of the class handle.

       The actual test will be done by calling "isa" on the class as a static method. (i.e.
       "&lt;My::Class-"isa($class)&gt;&gt;.

       Returns a reference to a list of the names of the loaded classes that match the class provided, or false
       is none match, or "undef" if the class name provided is invalid.

   <b>super_path</b>
       The "super_path" method is a straight pass through to the "Class::ISA::super_path" function. Returns an
       ordered list of class names, with no duplicates. The list does NOT include the class itself, or the
       UNIVERSAL class.

   <b>self_and_super_path</b>
       As above, but includes ourself at the beginning of the path. Directly passes through to Class::ISA.

   <b>full_super_path</b>
       The "full_super_path" method is an additional method not in "Class::ISA".  It returns as for
       "super_path", except that it also contains BOTH the class itself, and "UNIVERSAL". This full list is more
       technically accurate, but less commonly used, and as such isn't available from Class::ISA itself.
