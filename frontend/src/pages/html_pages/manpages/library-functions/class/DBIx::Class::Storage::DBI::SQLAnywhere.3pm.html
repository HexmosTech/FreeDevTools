</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::SQLAnywhere - Driver for SQL Anywhere

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This class implements autoincrements for SQL Anywhere and provides DBIx::Class::InflateColumn::DateTime
       support and support for the "uniqueidentifier" type (via DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::SQLAnywhere::Cursor.)

       You need the "DBD::SQLAnywhere" driver that comes with the SQL Anywhere distribution, <b>NOT</b> the one on
       CPAN. It is usually under a path such as:

         /opt/sqlanywhere11/sdk/perl

       Recommended connect_info settings:

         on_connect_call =&gt; 'datetime_setup'

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>connect_call_datetime_setup</b>
       Used as:

           on_connect_call =&gt; 'datetime_setup'

       In connect_info to set the date and timestamp formats (as temporary options for the session) for use with
       DBIx::Class::InflateColumn::DateTime.

       The "TIMESTAMP" data type supports up to 6 digits after the decimal point for second precision. The full
       precision is used.

       The "DATE" data type supposedly stores hours and minutes too, according to the documentation, but I could
       not get that to work. It seems to only store the date.

       You will need the DateTime::Format::Strptime module for inflation to work.

</pre><h4><b>MAXIMUM</b> <b>CURSORS</b></h4><pre>
       A DBIx::Class application can use a lot of cursors, due to the usage of prepare_cached.

       The default cursor maximum is 50, which can be a bit too low. This limit can be turned off (or increased)
       by the DBA by executing:

         set option max_statement_count = 0
         set option max_cursor_count    = 0

       Highly recommended.
