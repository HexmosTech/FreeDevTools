       SOAP::Transport::TCP - TCP Transport Support for SOAP::Lite

   <b>SOAP::Transport::TCP</b>
       The classes provided by this module implement direct TCP/IP communications methods for both clients and
       servers.

       The connections don't use HTTP or any other higher-level protocol. These classes are selected when the
       client or server object being created uses an endpoint URI that starts with tcp:/<a href="file:/.">/.</a> Both client and
       server classes support using Secure Socket Layer if it is available. If any of the parameters to a new
       method from either of the classes begins with SSL_ (such as SSL_server in place of Server), the class
       attempts to load the IO::Socket::SSL package and use it to create socket objects.

       Both of the following classes catch methods that are intended for the socket objects and pass them along,
       allowing calls such as $client-&gt;accept( ) without including the socket class in the inheritance tree.

       <u>SOAP::Transport::TCP::Client</u>

       Inherits from: SOAP::Client.

       The TCP client class defines only two relevant methods beyond new and send_receive. These methods are:

       SSL(<u>optional</u> <u>new</u> <u>boolean</u> <u>value</u>)
               if ($client-&gt;SSL) # Execute only if in SSL mode

           Reflects   the   attribute  that  denotes  whether  the  client  object  is  using  SSL  sockets  for
           communications.

       io_socket_class
               ($client-&gt;io_socket_class)-&gt;new(%options);

           Returns the name of the class to use when creating socket objects for internal use in communications.
           As implemented, it returns one of IO::Socket::INET or IO::Socket::SSL, depending on the return  value
           of the previous SSL method.

       If  an  application  creates  a  subclass that inherits from this client class, either method is a likely
       target for overloading.

       The new method behaves identically to most other classes, except that it detects  the  presence  of  SSL-
       targeted values in the parameter list and sets the SSL method appropriately if they are present.

       The  send_receive  method  creates  a  socket  of  the  appropriate  class and connects to the configured
       endpoint. It then sets the socket to nonblocking I/O, sends the message, shuts down the client end of the
       connection (preventing further writing), and reads the response back from the server. The  socket  object
       is discarded after the response and appropriate status codes are set on the client object.

       <u>SOAP::Transport::TCP::Server</u>

       Inherits from: SOAP::Server.

       The server class also defines the same two additional methods as in the client class:

       SSL(<u>optional</u> <u>new</u> <u>boolean</u> <u>value</u>)
               if ($client-&gt;SSL) # Execute only if in SSL mode

           Reflects   the   attribute  that  denotes  whether  the  client  object  is  using  SSL  sockets  for
           communications.

       io_socket_class
               ($client-&gt;io_socket_class)-&gt;new(%options);

           Returns the name of the class to use when creating socket objects for internal use in communications.
           As implemented, it returns one of IO::Socket::INET or IO::Socket::SSL, depending on the return  value
           of  the  previous  SSL method. The new method also manages the automatic selection of SSL in the same
           fashion as the client class does.

           The handle method in this server implementation isn't designed  to  be  called  once  with  each  new
           request.  Rather,  it  is  called with no arguments, at which time it enters into an infinite loop of
           waiting for a connection, reading the request, routing the request and sending  back  the  serialized
           response.  This  continues  until the process itself is interrupted by an untrapped signal or similar
           means.
