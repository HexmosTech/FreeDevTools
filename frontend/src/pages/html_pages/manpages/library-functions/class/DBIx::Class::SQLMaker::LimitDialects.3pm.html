</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       DBIx::Class::SQLMaker::LimitDialects - SQL::Abstract::Limit-like functionality in DBIx::Class::SQLMaker

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       DBIC's SQLMaker stack replicates and surpasses all of the functionality originally found in
       SQL::Abstract::Limit. While simple limits would work as-is, the more complex dialects that require e.g.
       subqueries could not be reliably implemented without taking full advantage of the metadata locked within
       DBIx::Class::ResultSource classes. After reimplementation of close to 80% of the SQL::Abstract::Limit
       functionality it was deemed more practical to simply make an independent DBIx::Class-specific limit-
       dialect provider.

</pre><h4><b>SQL</b> <b>LIMIT</b> <b>DIALECTS</b></h4><pre>
       Note that the actual implementations listed below never use "*" literally.  Instead proper re-aliasing of
       selectors and order criteria is done, so that the limit dialect are safe to use on joined resultsets with
       clashing column names.

       Currently the provided dialects are:

   <b>LimitOffset</b>
        SELECT ... LIMIT $limit OFFSET $offset

       Supported by <b>PostgreSQL</b> and <b>SQLite</b>

   <b>LimitXY</b>
        SELECT ... LIMIT $offset, $limit

       Supported by <b>MySQL</b> and any SQL::Statement based DBD

   <b>RowNumberOver</b>
        SELECT * FROM (
         SELECT *, ROW_NUMBER() OVER( ORDER BY ... ) AS RNO__ROW__INDEX FROM (
          SELECT ...
         )
        ) WHERE RNO__ROW__INDEX BETWEEN ($offset+1) AND ($limit+$offset)

       ANSI standard Limit/Offset implementation. Supported by <b>DB2</b> and <b>MSSQL</b> <b>&gt;=</b> <b>2005</b>.

   <b>SkipFirst</b>
        SELECT SKIP $offset FIRST $limit * FROM ...

       Supported by <b>Informix</b>, almost like LimitOffset. According to SQL::Abstract::Limit "... SKIP $offset LIMIT
       $limit ..." is also supported.

   <b>FirstSkip</b>
        SELECT FIRST $limit SKIP $offset * FROM ...

       Supported by <b>Firebird/Interbase</b>, reverse of SkipFirst. According to SQL::Abstract::Limit "... ROWS $limit
       TO $offset ..." is also supported.

   <b>RowNum</b>
       Depending on the resultset attributes one of:

        SELECT * FROM (
         SELECT *, ROWNUM AS rownum__index FROM (
          SELECT ...
         ) WHERE ROWNUM &lt;= ($limit+$offset)
        ) WHERE rownum__index &gt;= ($offset+1)

       or

        SELECT * FROM (
         SELECT *, ROWNUM AS rownum__index FROM (
           SELECT ...
         )
        ) WHERE rownum__index BETWEEN ($offset+1) AND ($limit+$offset)

       or

        SELECT * FROM (
           SELECT ...
         ) WHERE ROWNUM &lt;= ($limit+1)

       Supported by <b>Oracle</b>.

   <b>Top</b>
        SELECT * FROM

        SELECT TOP $limit FROM (
         SELECT TOP $limit FROM (
          SELECT TOP ($limit+$offset) ...
         ) ORDER BY $reversed_original_order
        ) ORDER BY $original_order

       Unreliable Top-based implementation, supported by <b>MSSQL</b> <b>&lt;</b> <b>2005</b>.

       <u>CAVEAT</u>

       Due to its implementation, this limit dialect returns <b>incorrect</b> <b>results</b> when $limit+$offset &gt; total
       amount of rows in the resultset.

   <b>FetchFirst</b>
        SELECT * FROM
        (
        SELECT * FROM (
         SELECT * FROM (
          SELECT * FROM ...
         ) ORDER BY $reversed_original_order
           FETCH FIRST $limit ROWS ONLY
        ) ORDER BY $original_order
          FETCH FIRST $limit ROWS ONLY
        )

       Unreliable FetchFirst-based implementation, supported by <b>IBM</b> <b>DB2</b> <b>&lt;=</b> <b>V5R3</b>.

       <u>CAVEAT</u>

       Due to its implementation, this limit dialect returns <b>incorrect</b> <b>results</b> when $limit+$offset &gt; total
       amount of rows in the resultset.

   <b>GenericSubQ</b>
        SELECT * FROM (
         SELECT ...
        )
        WHERE (
         SELECT COUNT(*) FROM $original_table cnt WHERE cnt.id &lt; $original_table.id
        ) BETWEEN $offset AND ($offset+$rows-1)

       This is the most evil limit "dialect" (more of a hack) for <u>really</u> stupid databases. It works by ordering
       the set by some unique column, and calculating the amount of rows that have a less-er value (thus
       emulating a "RowNum"-like index). Of course this implies the set can only be ordered by a single unique
       column.

       Also note that this technique can be and often is <b>excruciatingly</b> <b>slow</b>. You may have much better luck
       using "software_limit" in DBIx::Class::ResultSet instead.

       Currently used by <b>Sybase</b> <b>ASE</b>, due to lack of any other option.
