</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::SQLite - Automatic primary key class for SQLite

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         # In your table classes
         use base 'DBIx::Class::Core';
         __PACKAGE__-&gt;set_primary_key('id');

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This class implements autoincrements for SQLite.

   <b>Known</b> <b>Issues</b>
       RT79576
            NOTE - This section applies to you only if ALL of these are true:

             * You are or were using DBD::SQLite with a version lesser than 1.38_01

             * You are or were using DBIx::Class versions between 0.08191 and 0.08209
               (inclusive) or between 0.08240-TRIAL and 0.08242-TRIAL (also inclusive)

             * You use objects with overloaded stringification and are feeding them
               to DBIC CRUD methods directly

           An  unfortunate chain of events led to DBIx::Class silently hitting the problem described in RT#79576
           &lt;https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=79576&gt;.

           In order to trigger the bug condition one needs to supply <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> bind value that is an  object
           with overloaded stringification (numification is not relevant, only stringification is). When this is
           the case the internal DBIx::Class call to "$sth-&gt;bind_param" would be executed in a way that triggers
           the  above-mentioned  DBD::SQLite bug. As a result all the logs and tracers will contain the expected
           values, however SQLite will receive <b>all</b> these bind positions being set  to  the  value  of  the  <b>last</b>
           supplied stringifiable object.

           Even  if  you  upgrade DBIx::Class (which works around the bug starting from version 0.08210) you may
           still have corrupted/incorrect data in your database.  DBIx::Class warned about  this  condition  for
           several  years, hoping to give anyone affected sufficient notice of the potential issues. The warning
           was removed in 2015/v0.082820.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>connect_call_use_foreign_keys</b>
       Used as:

           on_connect_call =&gt; 'use_foreign_keys'

       In connect_info to turn on foreign key (including cascading) support for recent versions  of  SQLite  and
       DBD::SQLite.

       Executes:

         PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON

       See &lt;<a href="http://www.sqlite.org/foreignkeys.html">http://www.sqlite.org/foreignkeys.html</a>&gt; for more information.
