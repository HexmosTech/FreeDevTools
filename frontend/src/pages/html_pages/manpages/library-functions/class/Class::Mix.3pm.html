</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Class::Mix - dynamic class mixing

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Class::Mix <a href="../manmix_class/qw.mix_class.html">qw</a>(mix_class);

           $foobar_object = mix_class("Foo", "Bar")-&gt;new;
           $digest_class = mix_class("Foo", "Bar", {prefix=&gt;"Digest::"});

           use Class::Mix qw(genpkg);

           $package = genpkg;
           $package = genpkg("Digest::Foo::");

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The "mix_class" function provided by this module dynamically generates `anonymous' classes with specified
       inheritance.

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       mix_class(ITEMS ...)
           This  function  is  used  to dynamically generate `anonymous' classes by mixing pre-existing classes.
           This is useful where an incomplete class requires use of a mixin in  order  to  become  instantiable,
           several  suitable  mixins  are  available,  and  it  is  desired to make the choice between mixins at
           runtime.

           Each <u>ITEM</u> in the argument list is either the name of a class to inherit from (a parent  class)  or  a
           reference  to  a  hash  of  options.  The @ISA list of the mixture class is set to the list of parent
           class names, in the order supplied.  The options that may be supplied are:

           <b>mro</b> Specifies the desired method resolution order (MRO) of the mixture class.  See mro for details of
               the valid values and the default determined by Perl.  Typically, this should  be  set  to  <b>c3</b>  if
               mixing into an existing C3-based class hierarchy.

           <b>prefix</b>
               Specifies  where  the  resulting  package  will  go.   May be "undef" to indicate that the caller
               doesn't care (which is the default state).  Otherwise it must be  either  the  empty  string  (to
               create a top-level package) or a bareword followed by "::" (to create a package under that name).
               For  example,  "Digest::"  could  be  specified  to  ensure that the resulting package has a name
               starting with "Digest::", so that "Digest-&gt;new" will accept it as the name of  a  message  digest
               algorithm.

           The  function  generates  a  class of the form described by the arguments, and returns its name.  The
           same class will be returned by repeated invocations with the same parent class list and options.  The
           returned name may be used to call a constructor or other class methods of the mixed class.

           A class name must be returned because there is no such thing as an anonymous class in Perl.   Classes
           are  referenced by name.  The names that are generated by this function are unique and insignificant.
           See "genpkg" below for more information.

           If fewer than two classes to inherit from are specified, the function tries  to  avoid  generating  a
           separate  class  for  the  mixture.   If  only  one  parent class is specified then that class may be
           returned, and if no parent classes are specified then "UNIVERSAL" may be returned.  This provides the
           desired inheritance without creating superfluous classes.  These special  cases  only  apply  if  the
           options are compatible with the pre-existing class.

           This function relies on the classes it returns remaining unmodified in order to be returned by future
           invocations.   If  you  want  to  modify your dynamically-generated `anonymous' classes, use "genpkg"
           (below).

       genpkg([PREFIX])
           This function selects and returns a package name  that  has  not  been  previously  used.   The  name
           returned is an ordinary bareword-form package name, and can be used as the second argument to "bless"
           and in all other ways that package names are used.  The package is initially empty.

           The  package  names returned by this function are of a type that should not be used as ordinary fixed
           module names.  However, it is not possible to entirely prevent a clash.  This  function  checks  that
           the  package  name  it  is  about  to return has not already been used, and will avoid returning such
           names, but it cannot guarantee that a later-loaded module will not create a clash.

           PREFIX, if present, specifies where the resulting package will go.   It  must  be  either  the  empty
           string (to create a top-level package) or a bareword followed by "::" (to create a package under that
           name).   For  example,  "Digest::" could be specified to ensure that the resulting package has a name
           starting with "Digest::", so that "Digest-&gt;new" will accept it  as  the  name  of  a  message  digest
           algorithm.  If the PREFIX is not supplied, the caller is not expressing any preference.
