</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Class::Data::Inheritable - Inheritable, overridable class data

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         package Stuff;
         use base qw(Class::Data::Inheritable);

         # Set up DataFile as inheritable class data.
         Stuff-&gt;mk_classdata('DataFile');

         # Declare the location of the data file for this class.
         Stuff-&gt;DataFile('/etc/stuff/data');

         # Or, all in one shot:
         Stuff-&gt;mk_classdata(DataFile =&gt; '/etc/stuff/data');

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Class::Data::Inheritable is for creating accessor/mutators to class data.  That is, if you want to store
       something about your class as a whole (instead of about a single object).  This data is then inherited by
       your subclasses and can be overridden.

       For example:

         Pere::Ubu-&gt;mk_classdata('Suitcase');

       will generate the method <b>Suitcase()</b> in the class Pere::Ubu.

       This new method can be used to get and set a piece of class data.

         Pere::Ubu-&gt;Suitcase('Red');
         $suitcase = Pere::Ubu-&gt;Suitcase;

       The interesting part happens when a class inherits from Pere::Ubu:

         package Raygun;
         use base qw(Pere::Ubu);

         # Raygun's suitcase is Red.
         $suitcase = Raygun-&gt;Suitcase;

       Raygun inherits its Suitcase class data from Pere::Ubu.

       Inheritance of class data works analogous to method inheritance.  As long as Raygun does not "override"
       its inherited class data (by using <b>Suitcase()</b> to set a new value) it will continue to use whatever is set
       in Pere::Ubu and inherit further changes:

         # Both Raygun's and Pere::Ubu's suitcases are now Blue
         Pere::Ubu-&gt;Suitcase('Blue');

       However, should Raygun decide to set its own <b>Suitcase()</b> it has now "overridden" Pere::Ubu and is on its
       own, just like if it had overridden a method:

         # Raygun has an orange suitcase, Pere::Ubu's is still Blue.
         Raygun-&gt;Suitcase('Orange');

       Now that Raygun has overridden Pere::Ubu further changes by Pere::Ubu no longer effect Raygun.

         # Raygun still has an orange suitcase, but Pere::Ubu is using Samsonite.
         Pere::Ubu-&gt;Suitcase('Samsonite');

</pre><h4><b>Methods</b></h4><pre>
   <b>mk_classdata</b>
         Class-&gt;mk_classdata($data_accessor_name);
         Class-&gt;mk_classdata($data_accessor_name =&gt; $value);

       This is a class method used to declare new class data accessors.  A new accessor will be created in the
       Class using the name from $data_accessor_name, and optionally initially setting it to the given value.

       To facilitate overriding, mk_classdata creates an alias to the accessor, <b>_field_accessor()</b>.  So
       <b>Suitcase()</b> would have an alias <b>_Suitcase_accessor()</b> that does the exact same thing as <b>Suitcase()</b>.  This
       is useful if you want to alter the behavior of a single accessor yet still get the benefits of
       inheritable class data.  For example.

         sub Suitcase {
             my($self) = shift;
             warn "Fashion tragedy" if @_ and $_[0] eq 'Plaid';

             $self-&gt;_Suitcase_accessor(@_);
         }
