</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Lots of times, Class::DBI is used in web-based applications. (In fact, coupled with a templating system
       that allows you to pass objects, such as Template::Toolkit, Class::DBI is very much your friend for
       these.)

       And, as we all know, one of the most irritating things about writing web-based applications is the
       monotony of writing much of the same stuff over and over again. And, where there's monotony there's a
       tendency to skip over stuff that we all know is really important, but is a pain to write - like Taint
       Checking and sensible input validation. (Especially as we can still show a 'working' application without
       it!). So, we now have CGI::Untaint to take care of a lot of that for us.

       It so happens that CGI::Untaint also plays well with Class::DBI.  Class::DBI::FromCGI is a little wrapper
       that ties these two together.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>untaint_columns</b>
       All you need to do is to 'use Class::DBI::FromCGI' in your class (or in your local Class::DBI subclass
       that all your other classes inherit from. You do do that, don't you?).

       Then, in each class in which you want to use this, you declare how you want to untaint each column:

         __PACKAGE__-&gt;untaint_columns(
           printable =&gt; [qw/Title Director/],
           integer   =&gt; [qw/DomesticGross NumExplodingSheep/],
           date      =&gt; [qw/OpeningDate/],
         );

       (where the keys are the CGI::Untaint package to be used, and the values a listref of the relevant
       columns).

   <b>update_from_cgi</b>
       When you want to update based on the values coming in from a web-based form, you just call:

         $obj-&gt;update_from_cgi($h =&gt; @columns_to_update);

       If every value passed in gets through the CGI::Untaint process, the object will be updated (but not
       committed, in case you want to do anything else with it). Otherwise the update will fail (there are no
       partial updates), and $obj-&gt;cgi_update_errors will tell you what went wrong (as a hash of problem field
       =&gt; error from CGI::Untaint).

   <b>create_from_cgi</b>
       Similarly, if you wish to create a new object, then you can call:

         my $obj = Class-&gt;create_from_cgi($h =&gt; @columns_to_update);

       If this fails, $obj will be a defined object, containing the errors, as with an update, but will not
       contain the values submitted, nor have been written to the database.

   <b>untaint_type</b>
         my $how = $film-&gt;untaint_type('Title'); # printable

       This tells you how we're going to untaint a given column.

   <b>cgi_update_errors</b>
         if (my %errors = $film-&gt;cgi_update_errors) {
           while (my ($field, $problem) = each %errors) {
             warn "Problem with $field: $problem\n";
           }
         }

       This returns a hash of any errors when updating. Despite its name it also applies when inserting.

</pre><h4><b>Column</b> <b>Auto-Detection</b></h4><pre>
       As Class::DBI knows all its columns, you don't even have to say what columns you're interested in, unless
       it's a subset, as we can auto-fill these:

         $obj-&gt;update_from_cgi($h);

       You can also specify columns which must be present, or columns to be ignored even if they are present:

         $film-&gt;update_from_cgi($h =&gt; {
           all      =&gt; \@all_columns, # auto-filled if left blank
           ignore   =&gt; \@cols_to_ignore,
           required =&gt; \@cols_needed,
         });

       Doesn't this all make your life so much easier?

</pre><h4><b>NOTE</b></h4><pre>
       Don't try to update the value of your primary key. Class::DBI doesn't like that. If you try to do this it
       will be silently skipped.

</pre><h4><b>ANOTHER</b> <b>NOTE</b></h4><pre>
       If you haven't set up any 'untaint_column' information for a column which you later attempt to untaint,
       then we try to call $self-&gt;column_type to ascertain the default handler to use. Currently this will only
       use if you're using Class::DBI::mysql, and only for certain column types.
