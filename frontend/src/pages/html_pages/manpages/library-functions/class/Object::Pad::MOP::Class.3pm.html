</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       "Object::Pad::MOP::Class" - meta-object representation of a "Object::Pad" class

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Instances of this class represent a class or role implemented by Object::Pad. Accessors provide
       information about the class or role, and methods that can alter the class, typically by adding new
       elements to it, allow a program to extend existing classes.

       Where possible, this API is designed to be compatible with MOP::Class.

       This API should be considered <b>experimental</b>, and will emit warnings to that effect. They can be silenced
       with

          use Object::Pad qw( :<a href="../manmop/experimental.mop.html">experimental</a>(mop) );

       or

          use Object::Pad::MOP::Class qw( :<a href="../manmop/experimental.mop.html">experimental</a>(mop) );

</pre><h4><b>CONSTRUCTOR</b></h4><pre>
   <b>for_class</b>
          $metaclass = Object::Pad::MOP::Class-&gt;for_class( $class );

       <u>Since</u> <u>version</u> <u>0.38.</u>

       Returns the metaclass instance associated with the given class name. Throws an exception if the requested
       class is not using "Object::Pad".

   <b>try_for_class</b>
          $metaclass = Object::Pad::MOP::Class-&gt;try_for_class( $class );

       <u>Since</u> <u>version</u> <u>0.808.</u>

       If the given class name is built using "Object::Pad" then returns the metaclass instance for it. If not,
       returns "undef".

   <b>for_caller</b>
          $metaclass = Object::Pad::MOP::Class-&gt;for_caller;

       <u>Since</u> <u>version</u> <u>0.38.</u>

       A convenient shortcut for obtaining the metaclass instance of the calling package scope. Often handy
       during "BEGIN" blocks of the class itself to perform adjustments or additions.

          class Some::Class::Here 1.234 {
             BEGIN {
                my $meta = Object::Pad::MOP::Class-&gt;for_caller;
                ...
             }
          }

   <b>create_class</b>
          my $metaclass = Object::Pad::MOP::Class-&gt;create_class( $name, %args );

       <u>Since</u> <u>version</u> <u>0.61.</u>

       Creates a new class of the given name and yields the metaclass for it.

       Takes the following additional named arguments:

       extends =&gt; STRING
       isa =&gt; STRING
           An  optional  name  of a superclass that this class will extend. These options are synonyms; new code
           should use "isa", as "extends" will eventually be removed.

       abstract =&gt; BOOL
           Optionally; if given a true value the newly-created class will be declared as  abstract,  as  if  the
           ":abstract" attribute had been applied.

       Once  created,  this  metaclass  must be sealed using the "seal" method before it can be used to actually
       construct object instances.

   <b>create_role</b>
          my $metaclass = Object::Pad::MOP::Class-&gt;create_role( $name, %args );

       <u>Since</u> <u>version</u> <u>0.61.</u>

       As "create_class" but creates a role instead of a class.

   <b>begin_class</b>
          BEGIN {
             my $metaclass = Object::Pad::MOP::Class-&gt;begin_class( $name, %args );
             ...
          }

       <u>Since</u> <u>version</u> <u>0.46.</u>

       A variant of "create_class" which sets the newly-created class as the current complication scope  of  the
       surrounding code, allowing it to accept "Object::Pad" syntax forms such as "has" and "method".

       This  must  be  done  during  "BEGIN" time because of this compiletime effect.  It additionally creates a
       deferred code block at "UNITCHECK" time  of  its  surrounding  scope,  which  is  used  to  finalise  the
       constructed  class.  In  this  case  you  do  not  need  to  remember  to call "seal" on it; this happens
       automatically.

   <b>begin_role</b>
       <u>Since</u> <u>version</u> <u>0.46.</u>

       As "begin_class" but creates a role instead of a class.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>is_class</b>
   <b>is_role</b>
          $bool = $metaclass-&gt;is_class;
          $bool = $metaclass-&gt;is_role;

       Exactly one of these methods will return true, depending on whether this metaclass instance represents  a
       true "class", or a "role".

   <b>is_abstract</b>
          $bool = $metaclass-&gt;is_abstract;

       True on a "role", or a "class" that was declared with the ":abstract" attribute.

   <b>name</b>
          $name = $metaclass-&gt;name;

       Returns the name of the class, as a plain string.

   <b>superclasses</b>
          @classes = $metaclass-&gt;superclasses;

       Returns a list of superclasses, as Object::Pad::MOP::Class instances.

       Because "Object::Pad" does not support multiple superclasses, this list will contain at most one item.

   <b>direct_roles</b>
          @roles = $metaclass-&gt;direct_roles;

       Returns a list of the roles introduced by this class (i.e. added by `does` declarations but not inherited
       from the superclass), as Object::Pad::MOP::Class instances.

       This method is also aliased as "roles".

   <b>all_roles</b>
          @roles = $metaclass-&gt;all_roles;

       <u>Since</u> <u>version</u> <u>0.56.</u>

       Returns  a  list  of  all  the  roles  implemented by this class (i.e. including those inherited from the
       superclass), as Object::Pad::MOP::Class instances.

   <b>add_role</b>
          $metaclass-&gt;add_role( $rolename );
          $metaclass-&gt;add_role( $rolemeta );

       <u>Since</u> <u>version</u> <u>0.56.</u>

       Adds a new role to the list of those implemented by the class.

       The  new  role  can  be  specified  either  as   a   plain   string   giving   its   name,   or   as   an
       "Object::Pad::MOP::Class" meta instance directly.

       Before version 0.56 this was called "compose_role".

   <b>add_BUILD</b>
          $metaclass-&gt;add_BUILD( $code );

       Adds a new "BUILD" block to the class, as a CODE reference.

   <b>add_method</b>
          $metamethod = $metaclass-&gt;add_method( $name, %args, $code );

       Adds a new named method to the class under the given name, as CODE reference.

       Returns an instance of Object::Pad::MOP::Method to represent it.

       Recognises the following additional named arguments:

       common =&gt; BOOL
           <u>Since</u> <u>version</u> <u>0.62.</u>

           If true, the method is a class-common method.

   <b>get_direct_method</b>
          $metamethod = $metaclass-&gt;get_direct_method( $name );

       Returns an instance of Object::Pad::MOP::Method to represent the method of the given name, if one exists.
       If not an exception is thrown.

       This can only see directly-applied methods; that is, methods created by the "method" keyword on the class
       itself,  or  added  via  "add_method".  This  will not see other names in the package stash, even if they
       contain a "CODE" slot, nor will it see methods inherited from a superclass.

       This is also aliased as "get_own_method" for compatibility with the MOP::Class interface.

   <b>get_method</b>
          $metamethod = $metaclass-&gt;get_method( $name );

       <u>Since</u> <u>version</u> <u>0.57.</u>

       Returns an instance of Object::Pad::MOP::Method to represent the method of the given name, if one exists.
       If not an exception is thrown.

       This will additionally search superclasses, and may return a method belonging to a parent class.

   <b>direct_methods</b>
          @metamethods = $metaclass-&gt;direct_methods;

       <u>Since</u> <u>version</u> <u>0.57.</u>

       Returns a list of Object::Pad::MOP::Method instances to represent all the direct methods  of  the  class.
       This list may be empty.

   <b>all_methods</b>
          @metamethods = $metaclass-&gt;all_methods;

       <u>Since</u> <u>version</u> <u>0.57.</u>

       Returns a list of Object::Pad::MOP::Method instances to represent all the methods of the class, including
       those inherited from superclasses. This list may be empty.

   <b>add_field</b>
          $metafield = $metaclass-&gt;add_field( $name, %args );

       <u>since</u> <u>version</u> <u>0.60.</u>

       Adds  a  new field to the class, using the given name (which must begin with the sigil character "$", "@"
       or "%").

       Recognises the following additional named arguments:

       default =&gt; SCALAR
           <u>Since</u> <u>version</u> <u>0.43.</u>

           Provides a default value for the field; similar to using the syntax

              has $field = SCALAR;

           This value may be "undef", to set the value as being optional if  it  additionally  has  a  parameter
           name.

       param =&gt; STRING
           <u>Since</u> <u>version</u> <u>0.43.</u>

           Provides  a  parameter  name  for the field; similar to setting it using the ":param" attribute. This
           parameter will be required unless a default value is set (such value may still be "undef").

       reader =&gt; STRING
       writer =&gt; STRING
       mutator =&gt; STRING
           <u>Since</u> <u>version</u> <u>0.46.</u>

       accessor =&gt; STRING
           <u>Since</u> <u>version</u> <u>0.56.</u>

           Provides method names for generated reader, writer, lvalue-mutator or reader+writer accessor methods,
           similar to setting them via the ":reader", ":writer", ":mutator" or ":accessor" attributes.

       weak =&gt; BOOL
           <u>Since</u> <u>version</u> <u>0.46.</u>

           If true, reference values assigned into the field by the constructor  or  accessor  methods  will  be
           weakened, similar to setting the ":weak" attribute.

       attributes =&gt; ARRAY
           <u>Since</u> <u>version</u> <u>0.811.</u>

           Provides  additional  attributes  to  apply to the field, as if declared by attribute syntax. This is
           largely useful for applying third-party field attributes.

           The referenced array should contain an even-sized list of pairs. The first of each pair will  be  the
           name  of  an  attribute,  and the second will be a value to pass (or "undef" if not applicable). Note
           that if the third-party attribute provides separate parse and apply phases in its hook functions, the
           parse part will <u>not</u> be invoked by this parameter. Whatever value is passed must be something accepted
           by the apply phase alone.

       Returns an instance of Object::Pad::MOP::Field to represent it.

   <b>add_slot</b>
          $metafield = $metaclass-&gt;add_slot( $name, %args );

       <u>Now</u> <u>deprecated.</u>

       Back-compatibility alias for "add_field".

   <b>get_field</b>
          $metafield = $metaclass-&gt;get_field( $name );

       <u>Since</u> <u>version</u> <u>0.60.</u>

       Returns an instance of Object::Pad::MOP::Field to represent the field of the given name, if  one  exists.
       If not an exception is thrown.

   <b>get_slot</b>
          $metafield = $metaclass-&gt;get_slot( $name );

       <u>Now</u> <u>deprecated.</u>

       Back-compatibility alias for "get_field".

   <b>fields</b>
          @metafields = $metaclass-&gt;fields;

       <u>Since</u> <u>version</u> <u>0.60.</u>

       Returns  a  list of Object::Pad::MOP::Field instances to represent all the fields of the class. This list
       may be empty.

   <b>slots</b>
          @metafields = $metaclass-&gt;slots;

       <u>Since</u> <u>version</u> <u>0.42;</u> <u>now</u> <u>deprecated.</u>

       Back-compatibility alias for "fields".

   <b>add_required_method</b>
          $metaclass-&gt;add_required_method( $name );

       <u>Since</u> <u>version</u> <u>0.61.</u>

       Adds a new required method to the role, whose name is given as a plain string.

       Currently returns nothing. This should be considered temporary, as eventually  a  metatype  for  required
       methods will be added, at which point this method can return instances of it. It may also take additional
       parameters to define the required method with. Currently extra parameters are not permitted.

   <b>required_method_names</b>
          @names = $metaclass-&gt;required_method_names;

       <u>Since</u> <u>version</u> <u>0.61.</u>

       Returns a list names of required methods for the role, as plain strings.

       This  should  be  considered  a temporary method. Currently there is no metatype for required methods, so
       they are represented as plain strings. Eventually a type may be defined and a  "required_methods"  method
       will be added.

   <b>seal</b>
          $metaclass-&gt;seal;

       <u>Since</u> <u>version</u> <u>0.61.</u>

       If  the  metaclass  was  created  by  "create_class"  or  "create_role",  this method must be called once
       everything has been added into it, as the class  will  not  yet  be  ready  to  construct  actual  object
       instances before this is done.
