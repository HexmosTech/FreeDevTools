       Class::MakeMethods::Autoload - Declare generated subs with AUTOLOAD

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         package MyObject;
         use Class::MakeMethods::Autoload 'Standard::Hash::scalar';

         package main;
         my $obj = bless {}, 'MyObject';

         $obj-&gt;foo("Foozle");
         print $obj-&gt;foo();

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This package provides a generate-on-demand interface to Class::MakeMethods.

       When your class uses this package, it imports an AUTOLOAD function that resolves missing methods by using
       Class::MakeMethods to generate and install a standard type of method.

       You must specify the type of method to be generated by passing a single argument to your use
       Class::MakeMethods::Autoload statement, which can take any of these forms:

       •   A Class::MakeMethods generator name and method type.

           Here are three examples:

             use Class::MakeMethods::Autoload 'Standard::Hash:scalar';

             use Class::MakeMethods::Autoload 'Basic::Universal::no_op';

             use Class::MakeMethods::Autoload
                           '::Class::MakeMethod::Composite::Global:array';

       •   A  reference  to  a  subroutine  which  will  be called for each requested function name and which is
           expected to return the name of the method generator to use.

           Here's a contrived example which generates scalar accessors for methods except those with a digit  in
           their name, which are treated as globals.

             use Class::MakeMethods::Autoload sub {
               my $name = shift;
               ( $name =~ /\d/ ) ? 'Standard::Global::scalar'
                                 : 'Standard::Hash::scalar'
             };

       •   A  reference  to  a  hash  which  defines which method type to use based on the name of the requested
           method. If a key exists which is an exact match for the requested function name, the associated value
           is used; otherwise, each of the keys is used as a regular expression, and the value of the first  one
           that  matches  the  function  name  is used. (For regular expression matching, the keys are tested in
           reverse length order, longest to shortest.)

           Here's an example which provides a <b>new()</b> constructor, a <b>DESTROY()</b> method that  does  nothing,  and  a
           wildcard match that provides scalar accessors for all other Autoloaded methods:

             use Class::MakeMethods::Autoload {
               'new'     =&gt; 'Standard::Hash::new',
               '.*'      =&gt; 'Standard::Hash::scalar',
               'DESTROY' =&gt; 'Standard::Universal::no_op',
             };

           Here's  a  more  sophisticated  example  which  causes all-upper-case method names to be generated as
           globals, those with a leading upper-case letter to be generated  as  inheritable  data  methods,  and
           others to be normal accessors:

             use Class::MakeMethods::Autoload {
               'new'     =&gt; 'Standard::Hash::new',
               '.*'      =&gt; 'Standard::Hash::scalar',
               '[A-Z].*' =&gt; 'Standard::Inheritable::scalar',
               '[A-Z0-9]+' =&gt; 'Standard::Global::scalar',
               'DESTROY' =&gt; 'Standard::Universal::no_op',
             };

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       The  following  warnings  and errors may be produced when using Class::MakeMethods::Attribute to generate
       methods. (Note that this list does not include  run-time  messages  produced  by  calling  the  generated
       methods, or the standard messages produced by Class::MakeMethods.)

       No default method type; can't autoload
           You   must   declare   a   default   method   type,   generally   by  passing  its  name  to  a  "use
           Class::MakeMethods::Autoload" statement, prior to autoloading any methods.

       Construction of %s method %s failed to produce usable method
           Indicates that Autoload  successfully  called  Class::MakeMethods-&gt;make  to  generate  the  requested
           method,  but  afterwards  was  not  able  to  invoke  the  generated method. You may have selected an
           incompatible method type, or the method may not have been installed successfully.
