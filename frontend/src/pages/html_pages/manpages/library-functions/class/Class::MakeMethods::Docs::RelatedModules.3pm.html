</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Class::MakeMethods::Docs::RelatedModules - Survey of Class Builders

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         <a href="http://search.cpan.org/search">http://search.cpan.org/search</a>?mode=module&amp;query=Class

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       There are a variety of modules on CPAN dedicated to the purpose of generating common constructor and
       accessor methods. Below, I survey several of these, summarizing some basic features and technical
       approaches, and comparing them to Class::MakeMethods and other modules.

   <b>Caution</b>
       <b>Please</b> <b>note</b> <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>comments</b> <b>are</b> <b>for</b> <b>basic</b> <b>comparison</b> <b>purposes</b> <b>only</b> <b>and</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>incorrect</b> <b>or</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b>
       <b>date.</b> Please consult the documentation from a current version of each module for more specific details.
       Corrections and clarifications would by welcomed by the author at the email address below.

   <b>Points</b> <b>of</b> <b>Comparison</b>
       In general, I compared the following characteristics:

       Distribution
           Is it included with Perl, or on CPAN? Is it being actively maintained?

       Usage
           How do you go about declaring your class's methods?

       Mechanism
           How are they generated and delivered?

       Instance type
           Are the objects of your class blessed hashes, or something else?

       Core Methods
           Does  the  module  provide a constructor and basic accessors? Are there specialized methods for hash-
           ref, array-ref, and object-ref accessors?

       Extensible
           Can you subclass the package to create new types of methods, or is there some other way to extend it?

       Other Methods
           Other types of methods provided.

       Emulator
           Does Class::MakeMethods provide a drop-in replacement for this module?

       Comments
           Other characteristics or features of note.

   <b>Class::Accessor</b>
       Distribution
           CPAN. Last update 4/01.

       Usage

           Cleanly.

       Standard Methods
           Scalar accessors.

       Extensible

       Comments
           Accessor methods call overwritable "self-&lt;get(<u>key</u>)" and "self-&lt;set(<u>key</u>, <u>value</u>)" methods.

           Also includes Class::Accessor::Fast, which creates direct hash keys accessors without calling get and
           set methods.

           Individual objects may be assigned a subroutine that  will  be  called  as  a  method  on  subsequent
           accesses.  If an instance does not have a value for a given accessor, looks for a method defined with
           a leading underscore.
