</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Class::Adapter::Builder - Generate Class::Adapter classes

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 1.09

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         package My::Adapter;

         use strict;
         use Class::Adapter::Builder
             ISA     =&gt; 'Specific::API',
             METHODS =&gt; [ qw{foo bar baz} ],
             method  =&gt; 'different_method';

         1;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       "Class::Adapter::Builder" is another mechanism for letting you create <u>Adapter</u> classes of your own.

       It is intended to act as a toolkit for generating the guts of many varied and different types of <u>Adapter</u>
       classes.

       For a simple base class you can inherit from and change a specific method, see Class::Adapter::Clear.

   <b>The</b> <b>Pragma</b> <b>Interface</b>
       The most common method for defining <u>Adapter</u> classes, as shown in the synopsis, is the pragma interface.

       This consists of a set of key/value pairs provided when you load the module.

         # The format for building Adapter classes
         use Class::Adapter::Builder PARAM =&gt; VALUE, ...

       ISA The "ISA" param is provided as either a single value, or a reference to an "ARRAY" containing is list
           of classes.

           Normally  this  is  just  a  straight  list  of  classes.  However,  if the value for "ISA" is set to
           '_OBJECT_' the object will identify itself as whatever is  contained  in  it  when  the  "-&gt;isa"  and
           "-&gt;can" method are called on it.

       NEW Normally, you need to create your "Class::Adapter" objects separately:

             # Create the object
             my $query = CGI-&gt;new( 'param1', 'param2' );

             # Create the Decorator
             my $object = My::Adapter-&gt;new( $query );

           If  you  provide  a class name as the "NEW" param, the Decorator will do this for you, passing on any
           constructor arguments.

             # Assume we provided the following
             # NEW =&gt; 'CGI',

             # We can now do the above in one step
             my $object = My::Adapter-&gt;new( 'param1', 'param2' );

       AUTOLOAD
           By default, a "Class::Adapter" does not pass on any  methods,  with  the  methods  to  be  passed  on
           specified explicitly with the 'METHODS' param.

           By  setting  "AUTOLOAD"  to  true, the "Adapter" will be given the standard "AUTOLOAD" function to to
           pass through all unspecified methods to the parent object.

           By default the AUTOLOAD will pass through any and all calls, including calls to private methods.

           If the AUTOLOAD is specifically set to 'PUBLIC', the AUTOLOAD  setting  will  ONLY  apply  to  public
           methods, and any private methods will not be passed through.

       METHODS
           The  "METHODS"  param is provided as a reference to an array of all the methods that are to be passed
           through to the parent object as is.

       Any params other than the ones specified above are taken as translated methods.

         # If you provide the following
         # foo =&gt; bar

         # It the following are equivalent
         $decorator-&gt;foo;
         $decorator-&gt;_OBJECT_-&gt;bar;

       This capability is provided primarily because in Perl one of the main situations in  which  you  hit  the
       limits  of  Perl's  inheritance model is when your class needs to inherit from multiple different classes
       that containing clashing methods.

       For example:

         # If your class is like this
         package Foo;

         use base 'This', 'That';

         1;

       If  both  "This-&gt;method"  exists  and  "That-&gt;method"  exists,  and  both  mean  different  things,  then
       "Foo-&gt;method" becomes ambiguous.

       A "Class::Adapter" could be used to wrap your "Foo" object, with the "Class::Adapter" becoming the "That"
       sub-class, and passing "$decorator-&gt;method" through to "$object-&gt;that_method".

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       Yes,  "Class::Adapter::Builder" has public methods and later on you will be able to access them directly,
       but for now they are remaining undocumented, so  that  I  can  shuffle  things  around  for  another  few
       versions.

       Just stick to the pragma interface for now.
