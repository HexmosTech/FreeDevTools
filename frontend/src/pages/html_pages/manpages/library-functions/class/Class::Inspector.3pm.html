</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Class::Inspector - Get information about a class and its structure

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 1.36

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Class::Inspector;

         # Is a class installed and/or loaded
         Class::Inspector-&gt;installed( 'Foo::Class' );
         Class::Inspector-&gt;loaded( 'Foo::Class' );

         # Filename related information
         Class::Inspector-&gt;filename( 'Foo::Class' );
         Class::Inspector-&gt;resolved_filename( 'Foo::Class' );

         # Get subroutine related information
         Class::Inspector-&gt;functions( 'Foo::Class' );
         Class::Inspector-&gt;function_refs( 'Foo::Class' );
         Class::Inspector-&gt;function_exists( 'Foo::Class', 'bar' );
         Class::Inspector-&gt;methods( 'Foo::Class', 'full', 'public' );

         # Find all loaded subclasses or something
         Class::Inspector-&gt;subclasses( 'Foo::Class' );

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Class::Inspector allows you to get information about a loaded class. Most or all of this information can
       be found in other ways, but they aren't always very friendly, and usually involve a relatively high level
       of Perl wizardry, or strange and unusual looking code. Class::Inspector attempts to provide an easier,
       more friendly interface to this information.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>installed</b>
        my $bool = Class::Inspector-&gt;installed($class);

       The "installed" static method tries to determine if a class is installed on the machine, or at least
       available to Perl. It does this by wrapping around "resolved_filename".

       Returns true if installed/available, false if the class is not installed, or "undef" if the class name is
       invalid.

   <b>loaded</b>
        my $bool = Class::Inspector-&gt;loaded($class);

       The "loaded" static method tries to determine if a class is loaded by looking for symbol table entries.

       This method it uses to determine this will work even if the class does not have its own file, but is
       contained inside a single file with multiple classes in it. Even in the case of some sort of run-time
       loading class being used, these typically leave some trace in the symbol table, so an Autoload or
       Class::Autouse-based class should correctly appear loaded.

       Returns true if the class is loaded, false if not, or "undef" if the class name is invalid.

   <b>filename</b>
        my $filename = Class::Inspector-&gt;filename($class);

       For a given class, returns the base filename for the class. This will NOT be a fully resolved filename,
       just the part of the filename BELOW the @INC entry.

         print Class-&gt;filename( 'Foo::Bar' );
         &gt; Foo/Bar.pm

       This filename will be returned with the right separator for the local platform, and should work on all
       platforms.

       Returns the filename on success or "undef" if the class name is invalid.

   <b>resolved_filename</b>
        my $filename = Class::Inspector-&gt;resolved_filename($class);
        my $filename = Class::Inspector-&gt;resolved_filename($class, @try_first);

       For a given class, the "resolved_filename" static method returns the fully resolved filename for a class.
       That is, the file that the class would be loaded from.

       This is not necessarily the file that the class WAS loaded from, as the value returned is determined each
       time it runs, and the @INC include path may change.

       To get the actual file for a loaded class, see the "loaded_filename" method.

       Returns the filename for the class, or "undef" if the class name is invalid.

   <b>loaded_filename</b>
        my $filename = Class::Inspector-&gt;loaded_filename($class);

       For a given loaded class, the "loaded_filename" static method determines (via the %INC hash) the name of
       the file that it was originally loaded from.

       Returns a resolved file path, or false if the class did not have it's own file.

   <b>functions</b>
        my $arrayref = Class::Inspector-&gt;functions($class);

       For a loaded class, the "functions" static method returns a list of the names of all the functions in the
       classes immediate namespace.

       Note that this is not the METHODS of the class, just the functions.

       Returns a reference to an array of the function names on success, or "undef" if the class name is invalid
       or the class is not loaded.

   <b>function_refs</b>
        my $arrayref = Class::Inspector-&gt;function_refs($class);

       For a loaded class, the "function_refs" static method returns references to all the functions in the
       classes immediate namespace.

       Note that this is not the METHODS of the class, just the functions.

       Returns a reference to an array of "CODE" refs of the functions on success, or "undef" if the class is
       not loaded.

   <b>function_exists</b>
        my $bool = Class::Inspector-&gt;function_exists($class, $functon);

       Given a class and function name the "function_exists" static method will check to see if the function
       exists in the class.

       Note that this is as a function, not as a method. To see if a method exists for a class, use the "can"
       method for any class or object.

       Returns true if the function exists, false if not, or "undef" if the class or function name are invalid,
       or the class is not loaded.

   <b>methods</b>
        my $arrayref = Class::Inspector-&gt;methods($class, @options);

       For a given class name, the "methods" static method will returns ALL the methods available to that class.
       This includes all methods available from every class up the class' @ISA tree.

       Returns a reference to an array of the names of all the available methods on success, or "undef" if the
       class name is invalid or the class is not loaded.

       A number of options are available to the "methods" method that will alter the results returned. These
       should be listed after the class name, in any order.

         # Only get public methods
         my $method = Class::Inspector-&gt;methods( 'My::Class', 'public' );

       public
           The  "public"  option  will  return  only  'public'  methods,  as  defined  by the Perl convention of
           prepending an underscore to any 'private' methods. The "public" option will  effectively  remove  any
           methods that start with an underscore.

       private
           The  "private"  options  will  return  only  'private'  methods, as defined by the Perl convention of
           prepending an underscore to an private methods. The  "private"  option  will  effectively  remove  an
           method that do not start with an underscore.

           <b>Note:</b> <b>The</b> <b>"public"</b> <b>and</b> <b>"private"</b> <b>options</b> <b>are</b> <b>mutually</b> <b>exclusive</b>

       full
           "methods"  normally  returns just the method name. Supplying the "full" option will cause the methods
           to be returned as the full names. That is, instead of returning "[  'method1',  'method2',  'method3'
           ]", you would instead get "[ 'Class::method1', 'AnotherClass::method2', 'Class::method3' ]".

       expanded
           The  "expanded" option will cause a lot more information about method to be returned. Instead of just
           the method name, you will instead get an array reference containing  the  method  name  as  a  single
           combined name, a la "full", the separate class and method, and a CODE ref to the actual function ( if
           available   ).  Please  note  that  the  function  reference  is  not  guaranteed  to  be  available.
           "Class::Inspector" is intended at some later time, to work with modules that have some kind of common
           run-time loader in place ( e.g "Autoloader" or "Class::Autouse" for example.

           The response from "methods( 'Class', 'expanded' )" would look something like the following.

             [
               [ 'Class::method1',   'Class',   'method1', \&amp;Class::method1   ],
               [ 'Another::method2', 'Another', 'method2', \&amp;Another::method2 ],
               [ 'Foo::bar',         'Foo',     'bar',     \&amp;Foo::bar         ],
             ]

   <b>subclasses</b>
        my $arrayref = Class::Inspector-&gt;subclasses($class);

       The "subclasses" static method will search then entire namespace (and thus <b>all</b> currently loaded  classes)
       to find all classes that are subclasses of the class provided as a the parameter.

       The   actual   test   will   be   done  by  calling  "isa"  on  the  class  as  a  static  method.  (i.e.
       "My::Class-&gt;isa($class)".

       Returns a reference to a list of the loaded classes that match the  class  provided,  or  false  is  none
       match, or "undef" if the class name provided is invalid.
