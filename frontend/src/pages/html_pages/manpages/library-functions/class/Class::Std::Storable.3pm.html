</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Class::Std::Storable - Support for creating serializable "inside-out" classes

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This document describes Class::Std::Storable version 0.0.1

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       In general, use this class exactly as you would Class::Std.

           package Ice::Cream;
           use Class::Std::Storable;
           {
               my %name_of :ATTR( :get&lt;name&gt; :set&lt;name&gt; );
               my %flavor_of :ATTR( :get&lt;flavor&gt; :set&lt;flavor&gt; );
           }

           package main;
           my $object = Ice::Cream-&gt;new;
           $object-&gt;set_name("Vanilla Bean");
           $object-&gt;set_flavor("vanilla");

       But now, you may also serialize the object with Storable.

           use Storable;
           my $serialized = Storable::freeze($object);
           #store to a file, database, or wherever, and retrieve later.
           my $clone = Storable::thaw($serialized);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Class::Std introduced the "inside-out" model for classes (perldoc Class::Std for details).  Among its
       salient features is complete encapsulation; that is, an object's data may only be accessed via its
       methods, unlike the usual hashref model that permits direct access by any code whatsoever.  However, the
       drawback of complete encapsulation is that normal mechanisms for serialization won't work, as they rely
       on direct access to an object's attributes.

       This class provides the class-building functionality from Class::Std, and in addition provides an
       interface to allow Storable to freeze and thaw any declared attributes of this class and any superclasses
       that were built via Class::Std::Storable.

       However, in order to let Storable save attributes and construct the object, it is necessary to expose the
       attributes of the class to the world.  Thus, any code could use the same interface that Storable does to
       get a copy of object attributes and create new objects with arbitrary attributes without going through
       the constructor.  While the interface CAN'T be used to replace the existing attributes of an object, it
       COULD be used to create an arbitrarily mutated clone of an object without going through its methods.
       Also, if attributes are themselves references, then the objects to which they refer can be obtained and
       modified.

       As true encapsulation is one of the major features of Class::Std, this would be a good reason NOT to use
       this class.  But this sacrifice is required to provide serialization.  You must choose which is more
       important for your purposes, serialization or complete encapsulation.  Consider also that while bypassing
       the class methods is possible to a limited degree with Class::Std::Storable, doing so is much more
       complicated than just using the methods, so use of this class still discourages casual violations of
       encapsulation.

</pre><h4><b>INTERFACE</b></h4><pre>
       See Class::Std

       This package provides object methods STORABLE_freeze and STORABLE_thaw which are not intended to be used
       directly or overridden.

       A class generated using Class::Std::Storable may provide hooks to be called when a freeze or a thaw is
       performed.  These methods will be called if provided:

       $obj-&gt;STORABLE_freeze_pre($cloning)
           Called against the object at the very beginning of a freeze.  First parameter is Storable's "cloning"
           flag  --  see Storable.  This method could be used, for example, to adjust or remove non-serializable
           attributes.

       $obj-&gt;STORABLE_freeze_post($cloning, $param_ref)
           Called against the object after the parameters for the freeze have been determined, but before actual
           serialization.  First parameter is Storable's "cloning" flag -- see Storable.  Second parameter is  a
           reference  to a hash of hashes of parameters to be frozen, where the first level hash is keyed on the
           package name of the class, and the second level is keyed on the declared parameters  of  that  class.
           E.g.:

               $param_ref = {
                   'Base::Class' =&gt; {
                       flavor  =&gt; "vanilla",
                       name  =&gt; "Vanilla Bean",
                   },
                   'Sub::Class' =&gt; {
                       name =&gt; "Shiny Wax",
                       price =&gt; '$0.02',
                   },
               };

           This  hook  could  be used to adjust the attributes that are about to be frozen for its class.  It is
           probably unwise to adjust the attributes of other classes or to add new top-level hash entries.  This
           hook could also be used to undo any changes that were necessary in STORABLE_freeze_pre.

       $obj-&gt;STORABLE_thaw_pre($cloning, $param_ref)
           Called against the object at the very beginning of a thaw.  First parameter is  Storable's  "cloning"
           flag -- see Storable.  Second parameter is the same parameter hash described for the previous method,
           which will be used to reconstruct the object.

           This method could be used for validation, or to reconstruct attributes that couldn't be serialized.

       $obj-&gt;STORABLE_thaw_post($cloning)
           Called against the object when a thaw is otherwise complete.  First parameter is Storable's "cloning"
           flag  --  see  Storable.   This  method  could be used for validation, to reconstruct attributes that
           couldn't be serialized, or to adjust class data.

       It would undoubtedly be a good idea to mark these methods :CUMULATIVE if provided, so that  base  classes
       can perform their own hooks.  Also, these methods can not be provided via AUTOLOAD.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       See  Class::Std for its diagnostics.  Only the following are particular to Class::Std::Storable.  All are
       exceptions thrown with Carp::croak.

       "unknown attribute(s) seen while thawing"
           This indicates that when STORABLE_thaw tried to thaw an object, it found that the frozen  object  had
           an attribute that is not declared in the class.

           This  could  mean the class definition changed, removing or renaming attributes, between the freezing
           and thawing of the object.

           It could also mean that the STORABLE_freeze_post hook was used to insert  an  unknown  key  into  the
           freezing  hash  for  this  class.   Remove  such  additions in the STORABLE_thaw_pre hook (before the
           thawing gets under way).

       "unknown base class '$package' seen while thawing"
           This means that when thawing an object, its frozen hash representation  included  an  entry  that  is
           neither  the  class or a base class.  While this could mean that class names changed between freezing
           and thawing the object (don't do that), a more likely explanation is that a STORABLE_freeze_post hook
           inserted an unknown key into the top level of the freezing hash (don't do that either).

       "trying to modify existing attributes for $package"
           This probably means that some code is calling STORABLE_thaw directly on  an  existing  object  in  an
           attempt to fiddle with its attributes.  Don't even think about doing that.

           The  other  explanation  would be that the STORABLE_thaw_pre hook set an attribute for the object but
           left that attribute in the frozen hash to be thawed later.  STORABLE_thaw_pre should delete from  the
           frozen hash any attributes that it sets itself.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>AND</b> <b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       Class::Std::Storable requires no configuration files or environment variables.

</pre><h4><b>DEPENDENCIES</b></h4><pre>
       Class::Std  version 0.0.4 or newer, which is not at this time part of the Perl core modules.  This module
       depends on a small set of Class::Std  internals  staying  largely  the  same  and  could  break  if  that
       assumption proves false.

</pre><h4><b>INCOMPATIBILITIES</b></h4><pre>
       None reported.

</pre><h4><b>LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Vanilla  Class::Std  objects  are not themselves serializable.  Any base classes that are not built using
       Class::Std::Storable will probably not serialize correctly without special tricks.  This is a feature, as
       it means no one can just subclass a Class::Std class and break its encapsulation.

       Class::Std::Storable works fine with nested structures and correctly persists multiple references to  the
       same object, as long as all references are contained in a single serialization.

       Class::Std::Storable has never been tested for thread safety, so no guarantees there.

       Class::Std::Storable  attempts  to  identify  attributes  by their declaration, that is, according to how
       :ATTR declares their getters/setters/initializers.  If none of these are declared for  an  attribute,  it
       can  only  be  identified by its position, that is, the order of its appearance in the source code.  This
       scheme will break if you change the position of these nameless attributes, or change  the  names  of  the
       named ones, between the freezing and the thawing of an object.

       Serialization  of  inside-out objects naturally maintains the same caveats as for any other object.  Only
       declared (:ATTR) object attributes identified with the object will be serialized  with  the  object.   In
       particular, "class data" won't be serialized with the object.  Also, an object can't be serialized if any
       of its attributes cannot themselves be serialized, e.g. if one is a closure.
