</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Class::Refresh - refresh your classes during runtime

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 0.07

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Class::Refresh;
         use Foo;

         Class::Refresh-&gt;refresh;

         # edit Foo.pm

         Class::Refresh-&gt;refresh; # changes in Foo.pm are applied

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       During development, it is fairly common to cycle between writing code and testing that code. Generally
       the testing happens within the test suite, but frequently it is more convenient to test things by hand
       when tracking down a bug, or when doing some exploratory coding. In many situations, however, this
       becomes inconvenient - for instance, in a REPL, or in a stateful web application, restarting from the
       beginning after every code change can get pretty tedious. This module allows you to reload your
       application classes on the fly, so that the code/test cycle becomes a lot easier.

       This module takes a hash of import arguments, which can include:

       track_require
             use Class::Refresh track_require =&gt; 1;

           If  set,  a  "require()" hook will be installed to track modules which are loaded. This will make the
           list of modules to reload when "refresh" is called more accurate, but may  cause  issues  with  other
           modules which hook into "require" (since the hook is global).

       This  module  has  several  limitations, due to reloading modules in this way being an inherently fragile
       operation. Therefore, this module is recommended for use only in development environments - it should not
       be used for reloading things in production.

       It makes several assumptions about how code is structured that simplify the logic involved quite  a  bit,
       and  make  it  more reliable when those assumptions hold, but do make it inappropriate for use in certain
       cases. For instance, this module is named  "Class::Refresh"  for  a  reason:  it  is  only  intended  for
       refreshing  classes,  where  each  file  contains a single namespace, and each namespace corresponds to a
       single file, and all function calls happen through method dispatch. Unlike Module::Refresh,  which  makes
       an  effort  to track the files where subs were defined, this module assumes that refreshing a class means
       wiping out everything in the class's namespace, and reloading the file corresponding to  that  class.  If
       your  code  includes  multiple  files  that  all load things into a common namespace, or defines multiple
       classes in a single file, this will likely not work.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>refresh</b>
       The main entry point to the module. The first call to "refresh" populates a cache of  modification  times
       for  currently loaded modules, and subsequent calls will refresh any classes which have changed since the
       previous call.

   <b>modified_modules</b>
       Returns a list of modules which have changed since the last call to "refresh".

   <b>refresh_module</b> <b>$mod</b>
       This method calls "unload_module" and "load_module" on $mod, as well as on any  classes  that  depend  on
       $mod  (for instance, subclasses if $mod is a class, or classes that consume $mod if $mod is a role). This
       ensures that all of your classes are consistent, even when  dealing  with  things  like  immutable  Moose
       classes.

   <b>unload_module</b> <b>$mod</b>
       Unloads $mod, using Class::Unload.

   <b>load_module</b> <b>$mod</b>
       Loads $mod, using Class::Load.

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
       Refreshing modules may miss modules which have been externally loaded since the last call to refresh
           This  is  because it's not easily possible to tell if a module has been modified since it was loaded,
           if we haven't seen it so far. A workaround for this may be to set the "track_require" option  in  the
           import  arguments  (see  above),  although this comes with its own set of caveats (since it is global
           behavior).

       Global variable accesses and function calls may not work as expected
           Perl resolves accesses to global variables and functions in other packages at compile time, so if the
           package is later reloaded, changes to those will not be noticed. As mentioned above, this  module  is
           intended for refreshing <b>classes</b>.

       File modification times have a granularity of one second
           If  you  modify  a file and then immediately call "refresh" and then immediately modify it again, the
           modification may not be seen on the next call to "refresh". Note however that  file  size  and  inode
           number  are  also  compared,  so  it  still  may  be seen, depending on if either of those two things
           changed.

       Tracking modules which "use" a given module isn't possible
           For instance, modifying a Moose::Exporter module which is used in a class won't cause the class to be
           refreshed, even if the change to the exporter would cause a change in the class's metaclass.

       Classes which aren't completely defined in a single file and files which define multiple classes cause
       problems
           If a class is defined across multiple files, there's no easy guaranteed way  to  restore  the  entire
           state  of  the  class,  since there may be load order issues.  This includes Moose classes which have
           "make_immutable" called on them from outside of the class file itself.

           Also, files which define multiple classes cause  problems  since  we  can't  always  determine  which
           classes are defined in the file, and so reloading the file may cause class definitions to be run more
           than once.

       Classes which build themselves differently based on the state of other classes may not work properly
           This  module  attempts to handle several cases of this sort for Moose classes (modifying a class will
           refresh all of its subclasses, modifying a role will refresh all classes and roles which consume that
           role, modifying a metaclass will  refresh  all  classes  whose  metaclass  is  an  instance  of  that
           metaclass), but it's not a problem that's solvable in the general case.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Reloading classes when their metaclass is modified doesn't quite work yet
           This will require modifications to Moose to support properly.

       Tracking changes to metaclasses other than the class metaclass isn't implemented yet
       Metacircularity probably has issues
           Refreshing a class which is its own metaclass will likely break.
