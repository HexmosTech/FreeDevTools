</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       DBIx::Class::Manual::Component - Developing DBIx::Class Components

</pre><h4><b>WHAT</b> <b>IS</b> <b>A</b> <b>COMPONENT</b></h4><pre>
       A component is a module that can be added in to your DBIx::Class classes to provide extra functionality.
       A good example is the PK::Auto component which automatically retrieves primary keys that the database
       itself creates, after the insert has happened.

</pre><h4><b>USING</b></h4><pre>
       Components are loaded using the <b>load_components()</b> method within your DBIx::Class classes.

         package My::Thing;
         use base qw( DBIx::Class::Core );
         __PACKAGE__-&gt;load_components(qw/InflateColumn::DateTime TimeStamp/);

       Generally you do not want to specify the full package name of a component, instead take off the
       DBIx::Class:: part of it and just include the rest.  If you do want to load a component outside of the
       normal namespace you can do so by prepending the component name with a +.

         __PACKAGE__-&gt;load_components(qw/ +My::Component /);

       Once a component is loaded all of its methods, or otherwise, that it provides will be available in your
       class.

       The order in which is you load the components may be very important, depending on the component. If you
       are not sure, then read the docs for the components you are using and see if they mention anything about
       the order in which you should load them.

</pre><h4><b>CREATING</b> <b>COMPONENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Making your own component is very easy.

         package DBIx::Class::MyComp;
         use base qw(DBIx::Class);
         # Create methods, accessors, load other components, etc.
         1;

       When a component is loaded it is included in the calling class' inheritance chain using Class::C3.  As
       well as providing custom utility methods, a component may also override methods provided by other core
       components, like DBIx::Class::Row and others.  For example, you could override the insert and delete
       methods.

         sub insert {
           my $self = shift;
           # Do stuff with $self, like set default values.
           return $self-&gt;next::method( @_ );
         }

         sub delete {
           my $self = shift;
           # Do stuff with $self.
           return $self-&gt;next::method( @_ );
         }

       Now, the order that a component is loaded is very important.  Components that are loaded first are the
       first ones in the inheritance stack.  So, if you override <b>insert()</b> but the DBIx::Class::Row component is
       loaded first then your <b>insert()</b> will never be called, since the DBIx::Class::Row <b>insert()</b> will be called
       first.  If you are unsure as to why a given method is not being called try printing out the current
       linearized MRO.

         print join ', ' =&gt; mro::get_linear_isa('YourClass::Name');

</pre><h4><b>EXISTING</b> <b>COMPONENTS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Extra</b>
       These components provide extra functionality beyond basic functionality that you can't live without.

       DBIx::Class::CDBICompat - Class::DBI Compatibility layer.

       DBIx::Class::FormTools - Build forms with multiple interconnected objects.

       DBIx::Class::HTMLWidget - Like FromForm but with DBIx::Class and HTML::Widget.

       DBIx::Class::Ordered - Modify the position of objects in an ordered list.

       DBIx::Class::PK::Auto - Retrieve automatically created primary keys upon insert.

       DBIx::Class::QueriesTime - Display the amount of time it takes to run queries.

       DBIx::Class::RandomStringColumns - Declare virtual columns that return random strings.

       DBIx::Class::UUIDColumns - Implicit UUID columns.

       DBIx::Class::WebForm - CRUD methods.

   <b>Experimental</b>
       These components are under development, their interfaces may change, they may not work, etc.  So, use
       them if you want, but be warned.

       DBIx::Class::Validation - Validate all data before submitting to your database.

   <b>Core</b>
       These are the components that all, or nearly all, people will use without even knowing it.  These
       components provide most of DBIx::Class' functionality.

       DBIx::Class::Core - Loads various components that "most people" would want.

       DBIx::Class::AccessorGroup - Lets you build groups of accessors.

       DBIx::Class::DB - Non-recommended classdata schema component.

       DBIx::Class::InflateColumn - Automatically create objects from column data.

       DBIx::Class::PK - This class contains methods for handling primary keys and methods depending on them.

       DBIx::Class::Relationship - Inter-table relationships.

       DBIx::Class::ResultSourceProxy::Table - Provides a classdata table object and method proxies.

       DBIx::Class::Row - Basic row methods.
