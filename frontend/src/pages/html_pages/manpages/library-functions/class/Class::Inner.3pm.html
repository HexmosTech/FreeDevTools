</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Class::Inner - A perlish implementation of Java like inner classes

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Class::Inner;

           my $object = Class::Inner-&gt;new(
               parent =&gt; 'ParentClass',
               methods =&gt; { method =&gt; sub { ... } }, },
               constructor =&gt; 'new',
               args =&gt; [@constructor_args],
           );

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Yet another implementation of an anonymous class with per object overrideable methods, but with the added
       attraction of sort of working dispatch to the parent class's method.

   <b>METHODS</b>
       <b>new</b> <b>HASH</b>
           Takes a hash like argument list with the following keys.

           <b>parent</b>
               The  name  of  the parent class. Note that you can only get single inheritance with this or <b>SUPER</b>
               won't work.

           <b>methods</b>
               A hash, keys are method names, values are CODEREFs.

           <b>constructor</b>
               The name of the constructor method. Defaults to 'new'.

           <b>args</b>
               An anonymous array of arguments to pass to the constructor. Defaults to an empty list.

           Returns an object in an 'anonymous' class which inherits from the parent class. This anonymous  class
           has a couple of 'extra' methods:

           <b>SUPER</b>
               If you were to pass something like

                   $obj = Class::Inner-&gt;new(
                       parent  =&gt; 'Parent',
                       methods =&gt; { method =&gt;  sub { ...; $self-&gt;SUPER::method(@_) } },
                   );

               then  "$self-"gt"SUPER::method"  almost  certainly wouldn't do what you expect, so we provide the
               "SUPER" method which dispatches to the parent implementation of the current method.  There  seems
               to be no good way of getting the full "SUPER::" functionality, but I'm working on it.

           <b>DESTROY</b>
               Because  <b>Class::Inner</b>  works  by  creating  a  whole  new  class  name  for your object, it could
               potentially leak memory if you create a lot of them. So we add a "DESTROY"  method  that  removes
               the class from the symbol table once it's finished with.

               If    you    need    to    override    a    parent's   DESTROY   method,   adding   a   call   to
               "Class::Inner::clean_symbol_table(ref $self)" to it. Do it at the end of the method or your other
               method calls won't work.

       <b>clean_symbol_table</b>
           The helper subroutine that DESTROY uses to remove the class from the symbol table.

       <b>new_classname</b>
           Returns a name for the next anonymous class.

       Thanks to the Iterative Software people: Leon Brocard, Natalie Ford and Dave Cross. Also, this module was
       written  initially  for  use  in the PerlUnit project, AKA Test::Unit. Kudos to Christian Lemburg and the
       rest of that team.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       There are a million and one differen Class constructors available on CPAN, none of them does quite what I
       want, so I wrote this one to add to that population where hopefully it will live and thrive.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Bound to be some. Actually the "SUPER" method is a workaround for what I consider to be a bug in perl.
