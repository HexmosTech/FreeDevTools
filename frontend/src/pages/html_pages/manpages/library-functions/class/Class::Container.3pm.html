</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This class facilitates building frameworks of several classes that inter-operate.  It was first designed
       and built for "HTML::Mason", in which the Compiler, Lexer, Interpreter, Resolver, Component, Buffer, and
       several other objects must create each other transparently, passing the appropriate parameters to the
       right class, possibly substituting other subclasses for any of these objects.

       The main features of "Class::Container" are:

       •   Explicit declaration of containment relationships (aggregation, factory creation, etc.)

       •   Declaration of constructor parameters accepted by each member in a class framework

       •   Transparent passing of constructor parameters to the class that needs them

       •   Ability to create one (automatic) or many (manual) contained objects automatically and transparently

   <b>Scenario</b>
       Suppose  you've got a class called "Parent", which contains an object of the class "Child", which in turn
       contains an object of the class "GrandChild".  Each class creates the  object  that  it  contains.   Each
       class  also  accepts  a set of named parameters in its "new()" method.  Without using "Class::Container",
       "Parent" will have to know all the parameters that "Child" takes, and "Child" will have to know  all  the
       parameters  that "GrandChild" takes.  And some of the parameters accepted by "Parent" will really control
       aspects of "Child" or "GrandChild".  Likewise, some of the parameters accepted  by  "Child"  will  really
       control  aspects  of  "GrandChild".   So,  what happens when you decide you want to use a "GrandDaughter"
       class instead of the generic "GrandChild"?  "Parent" and "Child" must be modified  accordingly,  so  that
       any  additional  parameters  taken  by "GrandDaughter" can be accommodated.  This is a pain - the kind of
       pain that object-oriented programming was supposed to shield us from.

       Now, how can "Class::Container" help?  Using  "Class::Container",  each  class  ("Parent",  "Child",  and
       "GrandChild") will declare what arguments they take, and declare their relationships to the other classes
       ("Parent"  creates/contains  a  "Child",  and  "Child"  creates/contains a "GrandChild").  Then, when you
       create a "Parent" object, you can pass "Parent-&gt;new()" all the parameters for all three classes, and they
       will trickle down to the right places.  Furthermore, "Parent" and "Child" won't  have  to  know  anything
       about  the  parameters  of  its  contained  objects.   And  finally,  if  you  replace  "GrandChild" with
       "GrandDaughter", no changes to "Parent" or "Child" will likely be necessary.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>new()</b>
       Any class that inherits from "Class::Container" should also inherit its "new()" method.  You can do  this
       simply  by  omitting  it in your class, or by calling "SUPER::new(@_)" as indicated in the SYNOPSIS.  The
       "new()" method ensures that the proper parameters and  objects  are  passed  to  the  proper  constructor
       methods.

       At  the moment, the only possible constructor method is "new()".  If you need to create other constructor
       methods, they should call "new()" internally.

   <b>__PACKAGE__-&gt;contained_objects()</b>
       This class method is used to register what other objects, if any, a given class creates.   It  is  called
       with  a hash whose keys are the parameter names that the contained class's constructor accepts, and whose
       values are the default class to create an object of.

       For example, consider the "HTML::Mason::Compiler" class, which uses the following code:

         __PACKAGE__-&gt;contained_objects( lexer =&gt; 'HTML::Mason::Lexer' );

       This defines the relationship between the "HTML::Mason::Compiler" class and the class it creates to go in
       its "lexer" slot.  The "HTML::Mason::Compiler" class "has a" "lexer".  The "HTML::Mason::Compiler-&gt;new()"
       method will accept  a  "lexer"  parameter  and,  if  no  such  parameter  is  given,  an  object  of  the
       "HTML::Mason::Lexer" class should be constructed.

       We  implement  a  bit  of  magic  here,  so  that  if  "HTML::Mason::Compiler-&gt;new()"  is  called  with a
       "lexer_class"   parameter,   it   will   load   the   indicated   class   (presumably   a   subclass   of
       "HTML::Mason::Lexer"),  instantiate  a  new  object  of that class, and use it for the Compiler's "lexer"
       object.  We're also smart enough to notice if parameters given to "HTML::Mason::Compiler-&gt;new()" actually
       should go to the "lexer" contained object, and it will make sure that they get passed along.

       Furthermore, an object may be declared as "delayed", which means that an object <u>won't</u> be created when its
       containing class is constructed.  Instead, these objects will be created "on  demand",  potentially  more
       than  once.   The constructors will still enjoy the automatic passing of parameters to the correct class.
       See the "create_delayed_object()" for more.

       To declare an object as "delayed", call this method like this:

         __PACKAGE__-&gt;contained_objects( train =&gt; { class =&gt; 'Big::Train',
                                                    delayed =&gt; 1 } );

   <b>__PACKAGE__-&gt;valid_params(...)</b>
       Specifies the parameters accepted by this class's "new()" method  as  a  set  of  key/value  pairs.   Any
       parameters accepted by a superclass/subclass will also be accepted, as well as any parameters accepted by
       contained  objects.   This  method  is  a get/set accessor method, so it returns a reference to a hash of
       these key/value pairs.  As a special case, if you wish to set the valid params to an empty  set  and  you
       previously set it to a non-empty set, you may call "__PACKAGE__-&gt;valid_params(undef)".

       "valid_params()"  is  called  with  a  hash  that  contains  parameter  names  as its keys and validation
       specifications as values.  This validation specification  is  largely  the  same  as  that  used  by  the
       "Params::Validate" module, because we use "Params::Validate" internally.

       As an example, consider the following situation:

         use Class::Container;
         use Params::Validate qw(:types);
         __PACKAGE__-&gt;valid_params
             (
              allow_globals        =&gt; { type =&gt; ARRAYREF, parse =&gt; 'list',   default =&gt; [] },
              default_escape_flags =&gt; { type =&gt; SCALAR,   parse =&gt; 'string', default =&gt; '' },
              lexer                =&gt; { isa =&gt; 'HTML::Mason::Lexer' },
              preprocess           =&gt; { type =&gt; CODEREF,  parse =&gt; 'code',   optional =&gt; 1 },
              postprocess_perl     =&gt; { type =&gt; CODEREF,  parse =&gt; 'code',   optional =&gt; 1 },
              postprocess_text     =&gt; { type =&gt; CODEREF,  parse =&gt; 'code',   optional =&gt; 1 },
             );

         __PACKAGE__-&gt;contained_objects( lexer =&gt; 'HTML::Mason::Lexer' );

       The  "type",  "default",  and  "optional"  parameters  are  part  of the validation specification used by
       "Params::Validate".  The  various  constants  used,  "ARRAYREF",  "SCALAR",  etc.  are  all  exported  by
       "Params::Validate".   This  means that any of these six parameter names, plus the "lexer_class" parameter
       (because of the "contained_objects()" specification given earlier), are valid arguments to the Compiler's
       "new()" method.

       Note  that  there  are  also  some  "parse"  attributes  declared.   These  have  nothing  to   do   with
       "Class::Container"  or  "Params::Validate"  -  any extra entries like this are simply ignored, so you are
       free to  put  extra  information  in  the  specifications  as  long  as  it  doesn't  overlap  with  what
       "Class::Container" or "Params::Validate" are looking for.

   <b>$self-&gt;create_delayed_object()</b>
       If  a  contained  object  was  declared with "delayed =&gt; 1", use this method to create an instance of the
       object.  Note that this is an object method, not a class method:

          my $foo =       $self-&gt;create_delayed_object('foo', ...); # YES!
          my $foo = __PACKAGE__-&gt;create_delayed_object('foo', ...); # NO!

       The first argument should be a key passed to the "contained_objects()" method.  Any additional  arguments
       will  be  passed  to the "new()" method of the object being created, overriding any parameters previously
       passed to the container class constructor.  (Could I possibly be more alliterative?  Veni, vedi, vici.)

   <b>$self-&gt;delayed_object_params($name,</b> <b>[params])</b>
       Allows you to adjust the parameters that will be used to create any delayed objects in the  future.   The
       first  argument specifies the "name" of the object, and any additional arguments are key-value pairs that
       will become parameters to the delayed object.

       When called with only a $name argument and no list  of  parameters  to  set,  returns  a  hash  reference
       containing the parameters that will be passed when creating objects of this type.

   <b>$self-&gt;delayed_object_class($name)</b>
       Returns  the class that will be used when creating delayed objects of the given name.  Use this sparingly
       - in most situations you shouldn't care what the class is.

   <b>__PACKAGE__-&gt;decorates()</b>
       Version  0.09  of  Class::Container  added  [as  yet  experimental]  support  for  so-called  "decorator"
       relationships, using the term as defined in <u>Design</u> <u>Patterns</u> by Gamma, et al. (the Gang of Four book).  To
       declare  a  class  as a decorator of another class, simply set @ISA to the class which will be decorated,
       and call the decorator class's "decorates()" method.

       Internally, this will ensure that objects are instantiated as decorators.  This means that you can mix  &amp;
       match extra add-on functionality classes much more easily.

       In  the current implementation, if only a single decoration is used on an object, it will be instantiated
       as a simple subclass, thus avoiding a layer of indirection.

   <b>$self-&gt;validation_spec()</b>
       Returns a hash reference suitable for passing to the "Params::Validate" "validate"  function.   Does  <u>not</u>
       include any arguments that can be passed to contained objects.

   <b>$class-&gt;allowed_params(\%args)</b>
       Returns  a hash reference of every parameter this class will accept, <u>including</u> parameters it will pass on
       to its own contained objects.  The keys are the parameter names, and the values are  their  corresponding
       specifications  from  their  "valid_params()"  definitions.   If  a parameter is used by both the current
       object and one of its contained objects, the specification returned will be from the container class, not
       the contained.

       Because the parameters accepted by "new()" can vary based on the parameters <u>passed</u> to  "new()",  you  can
       pass  any  parameters  to  the  "allowed_params()"  method  too,  ensuring  that the hash you get back is
       accurate.

   <b>$self-&gt;container()</b>
       Returns the object that created you.  This is remembered by storing a reference to that object, so we use
       the "Scalar::Utils" "weakref()" function to avoid persistent circular references that would cause  memory
       leaks.   If  you don't have "Scalar::Utils" installed, we don't make these references in the first place,
       and calling "container()" will result in a fatal error.

       If you weren't created by another object via "Class::Container", "container()" returns "undef".

       In most cases you shouldn't care what object created you, so use this method sparingly.

   <b>$object-&gt;show_containers</b>
   <b>$package-&gt;show_containers</b>
       This method returns a string meant to describe the containment relationships among classes.   You  should
       not  depend  on the specific formatting of the string, because I may change things in a future release to
       make it prettier.

       For example, the HTML::Mason code returns the following when you do "$interp-&gt;show_containers":

        HTML::Mason::Interp=<a href="../man0x238944/HASH.0x238944.html">HASH</a>(0x238944)
          resolver -&gt; HTML::Mason::Resolver::File
          compiler -&gt; HTML::Mason::Compiler::ToObject
            lexer -&gt; HTML::Mason::Lexer
          request -&gt; HTML::Mason::Request (delayed)
            buffer -&gt; HTML::Mason::Buffer (delayed)

       Currently, containment is shown by indentation, so the Interp object contains a resolver and a  compiler,
       and  a  delayed  request  (or several delayed requests).  The compiler contains a lexer, and each request
       contains a delayed buffer (or several delayed buffers).

   <b>$object-&gt;dump_parameters</b>
       Returns a hash reference containing a set of parameters that should be sufficient to re-create the  given
       object  using  its  class's "new()" method.  This is done by fetching the current value for each declared
       parameter (i.e. looking in $object for hash entries  of  the  same  name),  then  recursing  through  all
       contained objects and doing the same.

       A few words of caution here.  First, the dumped parameters represent the <u>current</u> state of the object, not
       the state when it was originally created.

       Second,  a class's declared parameters may not correspond exactly to its data members, so it might not be
       possible to recover the former from the latter.  If it's possible but requires some manual  fudging,  you
       can override this method in your class, something like so:

        sub dump_parameters {
          my $self = shift;
          my $dump = $self-&gt;SUPER::dump_parameters();

          # Perform fudgery
          $dump-&gt;{incoming} = $self-&gt;{_private};
          delete $dump-&gt;{superfluous};
          return $dump;
        }
