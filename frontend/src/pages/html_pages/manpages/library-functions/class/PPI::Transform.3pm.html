</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       PPI::Transform - Abstract base class for document transformation classes

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       "PPI::Transform" provides an API for the creation of classes and objects that modify or transform PPI
       documents.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>new</b>
         my $transform = PPI::Transform-&gt;new(
             param1 =&gt; 'value1',
             param2 =&gt; 'value2',
         );

       The "new" constructor creates a new object for your "PPI::Transform" subclass. A default constructor is
       provided for you which takes no params and creates a basic, empty, object.

       If you wish to have your transform constructor take params, these <b>must</b> be in the form of a list of
       key/value pairs.

       Returns a new "PPI::Transform"-compatible object, or returns "undef" on error.

   <b>document</b>
       The "document" method should be implemented by each subclass, and takes a single argument of a
       PPI::Document object, modifying it <b>in</b> <b>place</b> as appropriate for the particular transform class.

       That's right, this method <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>clone</b> and <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>clone</b> the document object. If you do not want the
       original to be modified, you need to clone it yourself before passing it in.

       Returns the numbers of changes made to the document. If the transform is unable to track the quantity
       (including the situation where it cannot tell <b>IF</b> it made a change) it should return 1. Returns zero if no
       changes were made to the document, or "undef" if an error occurs.

       By default this error is likely to only mean that you passed in something that wasn't a PPI::Document,
       but may include additional errors depending on the subclass.

   <b>apply</b>
       The "apply" method is used to apply the transform to something. The argument must be a PPI::Document, or
       something which can be turned into one and then be written back to again.

       Currently, this list is limited to a "SCALAR" reference, although a handler registration process is
       available for you to add support for additional types of object should you wish (see the source for this
       module).

       Returns true if the transform was applied, false if there is an error in the transform process, or may
       die if there is a critical error in the apply handler.

   <b>file</b>
         # Read from one file and write to another
         $transform-&gt;file( 'Input.pm' =&gt; 'Output.pm' );

         # Change a file in place
         $transform-&gt;file( 'Change.pm' );

       The "file" method modifies a Perl document by filename. If passed a single parameter, it modifies the
       file in-place. If provided a second parameter, it will attempt to save the modified file to the
       alternative filename.

       Returns true on success, or "undef" on error.
