</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       DBIx::Class::DeploymentHandler - Extensible DBIx::Class deployment

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        use aliased 'DBIx::Class::DeploymentHandler' =&gt; 'DH';
        my $s = My::Schema-&gt;connect(...);

        my $dh = DH-&gt;new({
          schema              =&gt; $s,
          databases           =&gt; 'SQLite',
          sql_translator_args =&gt; { add_drop_table =&gt; 0 },
        });

        $dh-&gt;prepare_install;

        $dh-&gt;install;

       or for upgrades:

        use aliased 'DBIx::Class::DeploymentHandler' =&gt; 'DH';
        my $s = My::Schema-&gt;connect(...);

        my $dh = DH-&gt;new({
          schema              =&gt; $s,
          databases           =&gt; 'SQLite',
          sql_translator_args =&gt; { add_drop_table =&gt; 0 },
        });

        $dh-&gt;prepare_deploy;
        $dh-&gt;prepare_upgrade({
          from_version =&gt; 1,
          to_version   =&gt; 2,
        });

        $dh-&gt;upgrade;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       "DBIx::Class::DeploymentHandler" is, as its name suggests, a tool for deploying and upgrading databases
       with DBIx::Class.  It is designed to be much more flexible than DBIx::Class::Schema::Versioned, hence the
       use of Moose and lots of roles.

       "DBIx::Class::DeploymentHandler" itself is just a recommended set of roles that we think will not only
       work well for everyone, but will also yield the best overall mileage.  Each role it uses has its own
       nuances and documentation, so I won't describe all of them here, but here are a few of the major benefits
       over how DBIx::Class::Schema::Versioned worked (and DBIx::Class::DeploymentHandler::Deprecated tries to
       maintain compatibility with):

       •   Downgrades in addition to upgrades.

       •   Multiple sql files files per upgrade/downgrade/install.

       •   Perl scripts allowed for upgrade/downgrade/install.

       •   Just  one  set  of  files  needed  for  upgrade,  unlike  before  where  one  might  need to generate
           "factorial(scalar @versions)", which is just silly.

       •   And much, much more!

       That's really just a taste of some of the differences.  Check out each role for all the details.

</pre><h4><b>ATTRIBUTES</b></h4><pre>
       This is just a "stub" section to make clear that the bulk of implementation is documented somewhere else.

</pre><h4><b>WHERE</b> <b>IS</b> <b>ALL</b> <b>THE</b> <b>DOC?!</b></h4><pre>
       To get up and running fast, your best place to start is DBIx::Class::DeploymentHandler::Manual::Intro and
       then DBIx::Class::DeploymentHandler::Manual::CatalystIntro if your intending on using this with Catalyst.

       For    the    full    story    you   should   realise   that   "DBIx::Class::DeploymentHandler"   extends
       DBIx::Class::DeploymentHandler::Dad, so that's probably the first place to look when you  are  trying  to
       figure out how everything works.

       Next  would be to look at all the pieces that fill in the blanks that DBIx::Class::DeploymentHandler::Dad
       expects to  be  filled.   They  would  be  DBIx::Class::DeploymentHandler::DeployMethod::SQL::Translator,
       DBIx::Class::DeploymentHandler::VersionHandler::Monotonic,
       DBIx::Class::DeploymentHandler::VersionStorage::Standard,                                             and
       DBIx::Class::DeploymentHandler::WithReasonableDefaults.

</pre><h4><b>WHY</b> <b>IS</b> <b>THIS</b> <b>SO</b> <b>WEIRD</b></h4><pre>
       "DBIx::Class::DeploymentHandler" has a strange structure.  The gist is that it delegates to  three  small
       objects  that  are  proxied to via interface roles that then create the illusion of one large, monolithic
       object.  Here is a diagram that might help:

       The nice thing about this is that we have well defined interfaces  for  the  objects  that  comprise  the
       "DeploymentHandler",  the smaller objects can be tested in isolation, and the smaller objects can even be
       swapped in easily.  But the real win is that you can subclass  the  "DeploymentHandler"  without  knowing
       about  the  underlying  delegation; you just treat it like normal Perl and write methods that do what you
       want.

</pre><h4><b>THIS</b> <b>SUCKS</b></h4><pre>
       You started your project and weren't using "DBIx::Class::DeploymentHandler"?  Lucky for you I had you  in
       mind when I wrote this doc.

       First, define the version in your main schema file (maybe using $VERSION).

       Then you'll want to just install the version_storage:

        my $s = My::Schema-&gt;connect(...);
        my $dh = DBIx::Class::DeploymentHandler-&gt;new({ schema =&gt; $s });

        $dh-&gt;prepare_version_storage_install;
        $dh-&gt;install_version_storage;

       Then set your database version:

        $dh-&gt;add_database_version({ version =&gt; $s-&gt;schema_version });

       Now you should be able to use "DBIx::Class::DeploymentHandler" like normal!

</pre><h4><b>LOGGING</b></h4><pre>
       This  is a complex tool, and because of that sometimes you'll want to see what exactly is happening.  The
       best way to do that is to use the built in logging  functionality.   It  the  standard  six  log  levels;
       "fatal",  "error",  "warn",  "info",  "debug",  and  "trace".  Most of those are pretty self explanatory.
       Generally a safe level to see what all is going on is debug, which will give you  everything  except  for
       the exact SQL being run.

       To  enable the various logging levels all you need to do is set an environment variables: "DBICDH_FATAL",
       "DBICDH_ERROR", "DBICDH_WARN", "DBICDH_INFO", "DBICDH_DEBUG", and "DBICDH_TRACE".  Each level can be  set
       on  its  own, but the default is the first three on and the last three off, and the levels cascade, so if
       you turn on trace the rest will turn on automatically.

</pre><h4><b>DONATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       If you'd like to thank me for the work I've done on this module, don't give me a donation. I spend a  lot
       of free time creating free software, but I do it because I love it.

       Instead,  consider donating to someone who might actually need it.  Obviously you should do research when
       donating to  a  charity,  so  don't  just  take  my  word  on  this.   I  like  Matthew  25:  Ministries:
       &lt;<a href="http://www.m25m.org/">http://www.m25m.org/</a>&gt;,  but  there  are a host of other charities that can do much more good than I will
       with         your         money.          (Third         party         charity         info         here:
       &lt;<a href="http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm">http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm</a>?bay=search.summary&amp;orgid=6901&gt;

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       This  is  just  a  "stub"  section  to  make  clear  that  the  bulk  of  implementation is documented in
       DBIx::Class::DeploymentHandler::Dad. Since that is implemented using Moose  class,  see  "ATTRIBUTES"  in
       DBIx::Class::DeploymentHandler::Dad  and  "ORTHODOX  METHODS"  in DBIx::Class::DeploymentHandler::Dad for
       methods callable on the resulting object.

   <b>new</b>
         my $s = My::Schema-&gt;connect(...);
         my $dh = DBIx::Class::DeploymentHandler-&gt;new({
           schema              =&gt; $s,
           databases           =&gt; 'SQLite',
           sql_translator_args =&gt; { add_drop_table =&gt; 0 },
         });

   <b>prepare_version_storage_install</b>
        $dh-&gt;prepare_version_storage_install

       Creates the needed ".sql" file to install the version storage and not the rest of the tables

   <b>prepare_install</b>
        $dh-&gt;prepare_install

       First prepare all the tables to be installed and the prepare just the version storage

   <b>install_version_storage</b>
        $dh-&gt;install_version_storage

       Install the version storage and not the rest of the tables
