</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       MooseX::Storage is a serialization framework for Moose, it provides a very flexible and highly pluggable
       way to serialize Moose classes to a number of different formats and styles.

   <b>Levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>Serialization</b>
       There are three levels to the serialization, each of which builds upon the other and each of which can be
       customized to the specific needs of your class.

       <b>base</b>
           The first (base) level is "pack" and "unpack". In this level the class is serialized into a Perl HASH
           reference, it is tagged with the class name and each instance attribute is stored. Very simple.

           This level is not optional, it is the bare minimum that MooseX::Storage provides and all other levels
           build on top of this.

           See MooseX::Storage::Basic for the fundamental implementation and options to "pack" and "unpack"

       <b>format</b>
           The  second  (format)  level  is  "freeze"  and "thaw". In this level the output of "pack" is sent to
           "freeze" or the output of "thaw" is sent to "unpack". This levels primary role is to convert  to  and
           from the specific serialization format and Perl land.

           This  level  is  optional,  if  you  don't  want/need it, you don't have to have it. You can just use
           "pack"/"unpack" instead.

       <b>io</b>  The third (io) level is "load" and "store". In  this  level  we  are  reading  and  writing  data  to
           file/network/database/etc.

           This  level  is  also  optional,  in  most cases it does require a "format" role to also be used, the
           exception being the "StorableFile" role.

   <b>Behaviour</b> <b>modifiers</b>
       The serialization behaviour can be changed by supplying "traits" to either the  class  or  an  individual
       attribute.

       This can be done as follows:

         use MooseX::Storage;

         # adjust behaviour for the entire class
         with Storage( traits =&gt; [Trait1, Trait2,...] );

         # adjust behaviour for an attribute
         has my_attr =&gt; (
           traits =&gt; [Trait1, Trait2, ...],
           ...
         );

       The following <b>class</b> <b>traits</b> are currently bundled with MooseX::Storage:

       OnlyWhenBuilt
           Only  attributes  that have been built (i.e., where the predicate returns 'true') will be serialized.
           This avoids any potentially expensive computations.

           See MooseX::Storage::Traits::OnlyWhenBuilt for details.

       DisableCycleDetection
           Disables the default checks for circular references, which is necessary if you use such references in
           your serialisable objects.

           See MooseX::Storage::Traits::DisableCycleDetection for details.

       The following <b>attribute</b> <b>traits</b> are currently bundled with MooseX::Storage:

       DoNotSerialize
           Skip serialization entirely for this attribute.

           See MooseX::Storage::Meta::Attribute::Trait::DoNotSerialize for details.

   <b>How</b> <b>we</b> <b>serialize</b>
       There are always limits to any serialization framework -- there are just some  things  which  are  really
       difficult to serialize properly and some things which cannot be serialized at all.

   <b>What</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>serialized?</b>
       Currently  only  numbers,  string,  ARRAY  refs,  HASH refs and other MooseX::Storage-enabled objects are
       supported.

       With  Array  and  Hash  references  the  first  level  down  is  inspected  and  any  objects  found  are
       serialized/deserialized  for  you.  We  do  not  do this recursively by default, however this feature may
       become an option eventually.

       The specific serialize/deserialize routine  is  determined  by  the  Moose  type  constraint  a  specific
       attribute  has.  In  most  cases  subtypes  of  the supported types are handled correctly, and there is a
       facility for adding handlers for custom types as well. This will get documented  eventually,  but  it  is
       currently still in development.

   <b>What</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>serialized?</b>
       We  do not support CODE references yet, but this support might be added in using B::Deparse or some other
       deep magic.

       Scalar refs are not supported, mostly because there is no way to know if the value being referenced  will
       be  there  when the object is inflated.  I highly doubt will be ever support this in a general sense, but
       it would be possible to add this yourself for a small specific case.

       Circular references are specifically disallowed, however if  you  break  the  cycles  yourself  then  re-
       assemble  them  later  you can get around this.  The reason we disallow circular refs is because they are
       not always supported in all formats we use, and they tend to be very tricky to do for all possible cases.
       It is almost always something you want to have tight control over anyway.

</pre><h4><b>CAVEAT</b></h4><pre>
       This is <b>not</b> a persistence framework; changes to your object after you  load  or  store  it  will  not  be
       reflected in the stored class.

</pre><h4><b>EXPORTS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Storage</b> <b>(%options)</b>
           This  module  will  export  the  "Storage"  method  and  can  be  used  to  load  a  specific  set of
           MooseX::Storage roles to implement a specific combination of features. It is  meant  to  make  things
           easier, but it is by no means the only way. You can still compose your roles by hand if you like.

           By default, options are assumed to be short forms.  For example, this:

             Storage(format =&gt; 'JSON');

           ...will  result  in  looking  for MooseX::Storage::Format::JSON.  To use a role that is not under the
           default namespace prefix, start with an equal sign:

             Storage(format =&gt; '=My::Private::JSONFormat');

           To use a parameterized role (for which, see MooseX::Role::Parameterized) you can pass an arrayref  of
           the role name (in short or long form, as above) and its parameters:

             Storage(format =&gt; [ JSONpm =&gt; { json_opts =&gt; { pretty =&gt; 1 } } ]);

       <b>import</b>

   <b>Introspection</b>
       <b>meta</b>

</pre><h4><b>TODO</b></h4><pre>
       This  module  needs docs and probably a Cookbook of some kind as well.  This is an early release, so that
       is my excuse for now :)

       For the time being, please read the tests and feel free to email me  if  you  have  any  questions.  This
       module can also be discussed on IRC in the #moose channel on irc.perl.org.
