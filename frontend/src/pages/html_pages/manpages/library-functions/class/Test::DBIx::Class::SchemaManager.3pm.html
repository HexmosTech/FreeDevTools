       Test::DBIx::Class::SchemaManager - Manages a DBIx::Class::SchemaManager for Testing

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       this class is a helper for Test::DBIx::Class.  Basically it is a type of wrapper or adaptor for your
       schema so we can more easily and quickly deploy it and cleanup it for the purposes of automated testing.

       You shouldn't need to use anything here.  However, we do define %ENV variables that you might be
       interested in using (although its probably best to define inline configuration or use a configuration
       file).

       FORCE_DROP_TABLE
           Set to a true value will force dropping tables in the deploy phase.  This will generate warnings in a
           database  (like  sqlite)  that can't detect if a table exists before attempting to drop it.  Safe for
           Mysql though.

       KEEP_DB
           Usually at the end of tests we cleanup  your  database  and  remove  all  the  tables  created,  etc.
           Sometimes  you  might  want  to  preserve  the  database after testing so that you can 'poke around'.
           Personally I think it's better to write tests for the poking, but sometimes you  just  need  a  quick
           look.

           Please Note that KEEP_DB is not intended for use as a way to preserve deployed databases across tests
           or test runs.  I realize you may wish to try this as a way to reduce testing time, since starting and
           deploying  databases  can  be time consuming, however it negates the goal we have to properly isolate
           the test cases.

           If there is tremendous need for this type of feature, we may in the future  try  to  develop  a  good
           working   system.    For   now   I   recomment   using  the  "reset_schema"  (see  "reset_schema"  in
           Test::DBIx::Class for more) and subtests if you want to try this for a given test run..
