</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::Replicated::Balancer::Random - A 'random' Balancer

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       This class is used internally by DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::Replicated.  You shouldn't need to create
       instances of this class.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Given a pool (DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::Replicated::Pool) of replicated database's
       (DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::Replicated::Replicant), defines a method by which query load can be spread
       out across each replicant in the pool.

</pre><h4><b>ATTRIBUTES</b></h4><pre>
       This class defines the following attributes.

   <b>master_read_weight</b>
       A number greater than 0 that specifies what weight to give the master when choosing which backend to
       execute a read query on. A value of 0, which is the default, does no reads from master, while a value of
       1 gives it the same priority as any single replicant.

       For example: if you have 2 replicants, and a "master_read_weight" of 0.5, the chance of reading from
       master will be "20%".

       You can set it to a value higher than 1, making master have higher weight than any single replicant, if
       for example you have a very powerful master.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       This class defines the following methods.

   <b>next_storage</b>
       Returns an active replicant at random.  Please note that due to the nature of the word 'random' this
       means it's possible for a particular active replicant to be requested several times in a row.

</pre><h4><b>FURTHER</b> <b>QUESTIONS?</b></h4><pre>
