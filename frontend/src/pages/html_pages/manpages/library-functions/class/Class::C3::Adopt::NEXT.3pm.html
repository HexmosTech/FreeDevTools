</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Class::C3::Adopt::NEXT - make NEXT suck less

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 0.14

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           package MyApp::Plugin::FooBar;
           #use NEXT;
           use Class::C3::Adopt::NEXT;
           # or 'use Class::C3::Adopt::NEXT -no_warn;' to suppress warnings

           # Or use warnings::register
           # no warnings 'Class::C3::Adopt::NEXT';

           # Or suppress warnings in a set of modules from one place
           # no Class::C3::Adopt::NEXT qw/ Module1 Module2 Module3 /;
           # Or suppress using a regex
           # no Class::C3::Adopt::NEXT qr/^Module\d$/;

           sub a_method {
               my ($self) = @_;
               # Do some stuff

               # Re-dispatch method
               # Note that this will generate a warning the _first_ time the package
               # uses NEXT unless you un comment the 'no warnings' line above.
               $self-&gt;NEXT::method();
           }

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       NEXT was a good solution a few years ago, but isn't any more.  It's slow, and the order in which it re-
       dispatches methods appears random at times. It also encourages bad programming practices, as you end up
       with code to re-dispatch methods when all you really wanted to do was run some code before or after a
       method fired.

       However, if you have a large application, then weaning yourself off "NEXT" isn't easy.

       This module is intended as a drop-in replacement for NEXT, supporting the same interface, but using
       Class::C3 to do the hard work. You can then write new code without "NEXT", and migrate individual source
       files to use "Class::C3" or method modifiers as appropriate, at whatever pace you're comfortable with.

</pre><h4><b>WARNINGS</b></h4><pre>
       This module will warn once for each package using NEXT. It uses warnings::register, and so can be
       disabled like by adding "no warnings 'Class::C3::Adopt::NEXT';" to each package which generates a
       warning, or adding "use Class::C3::Adopt::NEXT -no_warn;", or disable multiple modules at once by saying:

           no Class::C3::Adopt::NEXT qw/ Module1 Module2 Module3 /;

       somewhere before the warnings are first triggered. You can also setup entire name spaces of modules which
       will not warn using a regex, e.g.

           no Class::C3::Adopt::NEXT qr/^Module\d$/;

</pre><h4><b>MIGRATING</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Current</b> <b>code</b> <b>using</b> <b>NEXT</b>
       You add "use MRO::Compat" to the top of a package as you start converting it, and gradually replace your
       calls to "NEXT::method()" with "maybe::next::method()", and calls to "NEXT::ACTUAL::method()" with
       "next::method()".

       Example:

           sub yourmethod {
               my $self = shift;

               # $self-&gt;NEXT::yourmethod(@_); becomes
               $self-&gt;maybe::next::method();
           }

           sub othermethod {
               my $self = shift;

               # $self-&gt;NEXT::ACTUAL::yourmethodname(); becomes
               $self-&gt;next::method();
           }

       On systems with Class::C3::XS present, this will automatically be used to speed up method re-dispatch. If
       you are running perl version 5.9.5 or greater then the C3 method resolution algorithm is included in
       perl. Correct use of MRO::Compat as shown above allows your code to be seamlessly forward and backwards
       compatible, taking advantage of native versions if available, but falling back to using pure perl
       "Class::C3".

   <b>Writing</b> <b>new</b> <b>code</b>
       Use Moose and make all of your plugins Moose::Roles, then use method modifiers to wrap methods.

       Example:

           package MyApp::Role::FooBar;
           use Moose::Role;

           before 'a_method' =&gt; sub {
               my ($self) = @_;
               # Do some stuff
           };

           around 'a_method' =&gt; sub {
               my $orig = shift;
               my $self = shift;
               # Do some stuff before
               my $ret = $self-&gt;$orig(@_); # Run wrapped method (or not!)
               # Do some stuff after
               return $ret;
           };

           package MyApp;
           use Moose;

           with 'MyApp::Role::FooBar';

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
       There are some inheritance hierarchies that it is possible to create which cannot be resolved to a simple
       C3 hierarchy. In that case, this module will fall back to using "NEXT". In this case a warning will be
       emitted.

       Because calculating the method resolution order of every class every time "-&gt;NEXT::foo" is used from
       within it is too expensive, runtime manipulations of @ISA are prohibited.

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       This module replaces "NEXT::AUTOLOAD" with its own version. If warnings are enabled then a warning will
       be emitted on the first use of "NEXT" by each package.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       MRO::Compat and Class::C3 for method re-dispatch and Moose for method modifiers and roles.

       NEXT for documentation on the functionality you'll be removing.
