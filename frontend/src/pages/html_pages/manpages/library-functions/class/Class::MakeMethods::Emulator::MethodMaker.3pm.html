</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Class::MakeMethods::Emulator::MethodMaker - Emulate Class::MethodMaker

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         package MyObject;
         use Class::MakeMethods::Emulator::MethodMaker(
           new_with_init =&gt; 'new',
           get_set       =&gt; [ qw / foo bar baz / ];
         );

         ... OR ...

         package MyObject;
         use Class::MakeMethods::Emulator::MethodMaker '-take_namespace';
         use Class::MethodMaker (
           new_with_init =&gt; 'new',
           get_set       =&gt; [ qw / foo bar baz / ];
         );

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module provides emulation of Class::MethodMaker, using the Class::MakeMethods framework.

       Although originally based on Class::MethodMaker, the calling convention for Class::MakeMethods differs in
       a variety of ways; most notably, the names given to various types of methods have been changed, and the
       format for specifying method attributes has been standardized. This package uses the aliasing capability
       provided by Class::MakeMethods, defining methods that modify the declaration arguments as necessary and
       pass them off to various subclasses of Class::MakeMethods.

</pre><h4><b>COMPATIBILITY</b></h4><pre>
       Full compatibility is maintained with version 1.03; some of the changes in versions 1.04 through 1.10 are
       not yet included.

       The test suite from Class::MethodMaker version 1.10 is included with this package, in the
       t/emulator_class_methodmaker/ directory.  The unsupported tests have names ending in ".todo".

       The tests are unchanged from those in the Class::MethodMaker distribution, except for the substitution of
       "Class::MakeMethods::Emulator::MethodMaker" in the place of "Class::MethodMaker".

       In cases where earlier distributions of Class::MethodMaker contained a different version of a test, it is
       also included. (Note that version 0.92's get_concat returned '' for empty values, but in version 0.96
       this was changed to undef; this emulator follows the later behavior. To avoid "use of undefined value"
       warnings from the 0.92 version of get_concat.t, that test has been modified by appending a new flag after
       the name, 'get_concat --noundef', which restores the earlier behavior.)

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       There are several ways to call this emulation module:

       •   Direct Access

           Replace       occurrences       in       your       code       of      "Class::MethodMaker"      with
           "Class::MakeMethods::Emulator::MethodMaker".

       •   Install Emulation

           If you  "use  Class::MakeMethods::Emulator::MethodMaker  '-take_namespace'",  the  Class::MethodMaker
           namespace  will  be  aliased to this package, and calls to the original package will be transparently
           handled by this emulator.

           To   remove   the   emulation   aliasing,   call    "use    Class::MakeMethods::Emulator::MethodMaker
           '-release_namespace'".

           <b>Note:</b>  This  affects  <b>all</b>  subsequent  uses of Class::MethodMaker in your program, including those in
           other modules, and might cause unexpected effects.

       •   The -sugar Option

           Passing '-sugar' as the first argument in a use or import call will cause the 'methods' package to be
           declared as an alias to this one.

           This allows you to write declarations in the following manner.

             use Class::MakeMethods::Emulator::MethodMaker '-sugar';

             make methods
               get_set =&gt; [ qw / foo bar baz / ],
               list    =&gt; [ qw / a b c / ];

           <b>Note:</b> This feature is deprecated in Class::MethodMaker version 0.96 and later.

</pre><h4><b>METHOD</b> <b>CATALOG</b></h4><pre>
       <b>NOTE:</b>   The   documentation   below   is   derived   from    version    1.02    of    Class::MethodMaker.
       Class::MakeMethods::Emulator::MethodMaker  provides  support  for  all of the features and examples shown
       below, with no changes required.

</pre><h4><b>CONSTRUCTOR</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>new</b>
       Equivalent to Class::MakeMethods 'Template::Hash:new --with_values'.

   <b>new_with_init</b>
       Equivalent to Class::MakeMethods 'Template::Hash:new --with_init'.

   <b>new_hash_init</b>
       Equivalent to Class::MakeMethods 'Template::Hash:new --instance_with_methods'.

   <b>new_with_args</b>
       Equivalent to Class::MakeMethods 'Template::Hash:new --with_values'.

   <b>copy</b>
       Equivalent to Class::MakeMethods 'Template::Hash:new --copy_with_values'.

</pre><h4><b>SCALAR</b> <b>ACCESSORS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>get_set</b>
       Basically equivalent to Class::MakeMethods 'Template::Hash:scalar', except  that  various  arguments  are
       intercepted and converted into the parallel Class::MakeMethods::Template interface declarations.

   <b>get_concat</b>
       Equivalent  to  Class::MakeMethods  'Template::Hash:string'  with  a  special  interface declaration that
       provides the get_concat and clear behaviors.

   <b>counter</b>
       Equivalent to Class::MakeMethods 'Template::Hash:number --counter'.

</pre><h4><b>OBJECT</b> <b>ACCESSORS</b></h4><pre>
       Basically equivalent to Class::MakeMethods 'Template::Hash:object' with an declaration that provides  the
       "delete_x" interface. Due to a difference in expected argument syntax, the incoming arguments are revised
       before being delegated to Template::Hash:object.

   <b>object_list</b>
       Basically equivalent to Class::MakeMethods 'Template::Hash:object_list' with an declaration that provides
       the  relevant helper methods. Due to a difference in expected argument syntax, the incoming arguments are
       revised before being delegated to Template::Hash:object_list.

   <b>forward</b>
       Basically equivalent to Class::MakeMethods 'Template::Universal:forward_methods'. Due to a difference  in
       expected   argument   syntax,   the   incoming   arguments   are   revised   before  being  delegated  to
       Template::Universal:forward_methods.

         forward =&gt; [ comp =&gt; 'method1', comp2 =&gt; 'method2' ]

       Define pass-through methods for certain fields.  The above defines that method "method1" will be  handled
       by component "comp", whilst method "method2" will be handled by component "comp2".

</pre><h4><b>REFERENCE</b> <b>ACCESSORS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>list</b>
       Equivalent to Class::MakeMethods 'Template::Hash:array' with a custom method naming interface.

   <b>hash</b>
       Equivalent to Class::MakeMethods 'Template::Hash:hash' with a custom method naming interface.

   <b>tie_hash</b>
       Equivalent to Class::MakeMethods 'Template::Hash:tiedhash' with a custom method naming interface.

   <b>hash_of_lists</b>
       Equivalent  to  Class::MakeMethods 'Template::Hash:hash_of_arrays', or if the -static flag is present, to
       'Template::Static:hash_of_arrays'.

</pre><h4><b>STATIC</b> <b>ACCESSORS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>static_get_set</b>
       Equivalent to Class::MakeMethods 'Template::Static:scalar' with a custom method naming interface.

   <b>static_list</b>
       Equivalent to Class::MakeMethods 'Template::Static:array' with a custom method naming interface.

   <b>static_hash</b>
       Equivalent to Class::MakeMethods 'Template::Static:hash' with a custom method naming interface.

</pre><h4><b>GROUPED</b> <b>ACCESSORS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>boolean</b>
       Equivalent to Class::MakeMethods 'Template::Static:bits' with a custom method naming interface.

   <b>grouped_fields</b>
       Creates get/set methods like get_set but also defines a method which returns a list of the slots  in  the
       group.

         use Class::MakeMethods::Emulator::MethodMaker
           grouped_fields =&gt; [
             some_group =&gt; [ qw / field1 field2 field3 / ],
           ];

       Its  argument list is parsed as a hash of group-name =&gt; field-list pairs. Get-set methods are defined for
       all the fields and a method with the name of the group is defined which returns the list of fields in the
       group.

   <b>struct</b>
       Equivalent to Class::MakeMethods 'Template::Hash::struct'.

       <b>Note:</b> This feature is included but not documented in Class::MethodMaker version 1.

</pre><h4><b>INDEXED</b> <b>ACCESSORS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>listed_attrib</b>
       Equivalent  to  Class::MakeMethods  'Template::Flyweight:boolean_index'  with  a  custom  method   naming
       interface.

   <b>key_attrib</b>
       Equivalent to Class::MakeMethods 'Template::Hash:string_index'.

   <b>key_with_create</b>
       Equivalent to Class::MakeMethods 'Template::Hash:string_index --find_or_new'.

</pre><h4><b>CODE</b> <b>ACCESSORS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>code</b>
       Equivalent to Class::MakeMethods 'Template::Hash:code'.

   <b>method</b>
       Equivalent to Class::MakeMethods 'Template::Hash:code --method'.

   <b>abstract</b>
       Equivalent to Class::MakeMethods 'Template::Universal:croak --abstract'.

</pre><h4><b>ARRAY</b> <b>CONSTRUCTOR</b> <b>AND</b> <b>ACCESSORS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>builtin_class</b> <b>(EXPERIMENTAL)</b>
       Equivalent to Class::MakeMethods 'Template::StructBuiltin:builtin_isa' with a modified argument order.

</pre><h4><b>CONVERSION</b></h4><pre>
       If  you  wish  to  convert  your  code  from  use  of  the  Class::MethodMaker  emulator to direct use of
       Class::MakeMethods, you will need to adjust the arguments specified in your "use" or "make" calls.

       Often this is simply a matter of replacing the names of aliased method-types listed below  with  the  new
       equivalents.

       For example, suppose that you code contained the following declaration:

         use Class::MethodMaker (
           counter =&gt; [ 'foo' ]
         );

       Consulting the listings below you can find that "counter" is an alias for "Hash:number --counter" and you
       could thus revise your declaration to read:

         use Class::MakeMethods (
           'Hash:number --counter' =&gt; [ 'foo' ]
         );

       However,  note  that those methods marked "(with custom interface)" below have a different default naming
       convention for helper methods in Class::MakeMethods, and  you  will  need  to  either  supply  a  similar
       interface or alter your module's calling interface.

       Also  note  that  the  "forward",  "object",  and  "object_list"  method  types,  marked  "(with modified
       arguments)" below, require their arguments to be specified differently.

       See Class::MakeMethods::Template::Generic for more information about  the  default  interfaces  of  these
       method types.

   <b>Hash</b> <b>methods</b>
       The  following  equivalencies  are  declared  for  old meta-method names that are now handled by the Hash
       implementation:

         new              'Template::Hash:new --with_values'
         new_with_init    'Template::Hash:new --with_init'
         new_hash_init    'Template::Hash:new --instance_with_methods'
         copy             'Template::Hash:copy'
         get_set          'Template::Hash:scalar' (with custom interfaces)
         counter          'Template::Hash:number --counter'
         get_concat       'Template::Hash:string --get_concat' (with custom interface)
         boolean          'Template::Hash:bits' (with custom interface)
         list             'Template::Hash:array' (with custom interface)
         struct           'Template::Hash:struct'
         hash             'Template::Hash:hash' (with custom interface)
         tie_hash         'Template::Hash:tiedhash' (with custom interface)
         hash_of_lists    'Template::Hash:hash_of_arrays'
         code             'Template::Hash:code'
         method           'Template::Hash:code --method'
         object           'Template::Hash:object' (with custom interface and modified arguments)
         object_list      'Template::Hash:array_of_objects' (with custom interface and modified arguments)
         key_attrib       'Template::Hash:string_index'
         key_with_create  'Template::Hash:string_index --find_or_new'

   <b>Static</b> <b>methods</b>
       The following equivalencies are declared for old meta-method names that are now  handled  by  the  Static
       implementation:

         static_get_set   'Template::Static:scalar' (with custom interface)
         static_hash      'Template::Static:hash' (with custom interface)

   <b>Flyweight</b> <b>method</b>
       The  following  equivalency  is  declared  for  the  one  old meta-method name that us now handled by the
       Flyweight implementation:

         listed_attrib   'Template::Flyweight:boolean_index'

   <b>Struct</b> <b>methods</b>
       The following equivalencies are declared for old meta-method names that are now  handled  by  the  Struct
       implementation:

         builtin_class   'Template::Struct:builtin_isa'

   <b>Universal</b> <b>methods</b>
       The  following equivalencies are declared for old meta-method names that are now handled by the Universal
       implementation:

         abstract         'Template::Universal:croak --abstract'
         forward          'Template::Universal:forward_methods' (with modified arguments)

</pre><h4><b>EXTENDING</b></h4><pre>
       In order to enable third-party subclasses of MethodMaker to run under this emulator, several  aliases  or
       stub  replacements  are  provided  for  internal Class::MethodMaker methods which have been eliminated or
       renamed.

       •   install_methods - now simply return the desired methods

       •   find_target_class - now passed in as the target_class attribute

       •   ima_method_maker - no longer supported; use target_class instead

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       This module aims to provide a 100% compatible drop-in replacement for Class::MethodMaker; if you detect a
       difference when using this emulation, please inform the author.
