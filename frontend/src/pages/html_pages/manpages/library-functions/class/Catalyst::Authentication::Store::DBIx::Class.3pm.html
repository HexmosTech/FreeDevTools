</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The Catalyst::Authentication::Store::DBIx::Class class provides access to authentication information
       stored in a database via DBIx::Class.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       The DBIx::Class authentication store is activated by setting the store config's <b>class</b> element to
       DBIx::Class as shown above. See the Catalyst::Plugin::Authentication documentation for more details on
       configuring the store. You can also use Catalyst::Authentication::Realm::SimpleDB for a simplified setup.

       The DBIx::Class storage module has several configuration options

           __PACKAGE__-&gt;config('Plugin::Authentication' =&gt; {
               default_realm =&gt; 'members',
               realms =&gt; {
                   members =&gt; {
                       credential =&gt; {
                           # ...
                       },
                       store =&gt; {
                           class =&gt; 'DBIx::Class',
                           user_model =&gt; 'MyApp::User',
                           role_relation =&gt; 'roles',
                           role_field =&gt; 'rolename',
                           ignore_fields_in_find =&gt; [ 'remote_name' ],
                           use_userdata_from_session =&gt; 1,
                       }
                   }
               }
           });

       class
           Class  is part of the core Catalyst::Plugin::Authentication module; it contains the class name of the
           store to be used.

       user_model
           Contains the model name (as passed to "$ctx-&gt;model()") of the DBIx::Class schema to use as the source
           for user information. This config item is <b>REQUIRED</b>.

           (Note that this option used to be called "user_class". "user_class" is still functional,  but  should
           be  used  only  for  compatibility  with  previous configs.  The setting called "user_class" on other
           authentication stores is present, but named "store_user_class" in this store)

       role_column
           If your role information is stored in the same table as the rest of your user information, this  item
           tells  the  module  which field contains your role information.  The DBIx::Class authentication store
           expects the data in this field to be a series of role names separated by some combination of  spaces,
           commas, or pipe characters.

       role_relation
           If  your  role  information is stored in a separate table, this is the name of the relation that will
           lead to the roles the user is in.  If this is specified, then a role_field is  also  required.   Also
           when using this method it is expected that your role table will return one row for each role the user
           is in.

       role_field
           This is the name of the field in the role table that contains the string identifying the role.

       ignore_fields_in_find
           This item is an array containing fields that may be passed to the "$ctx-&gt;authenticate()" routine (and
           therefore  find_user in the storage class), but which should be ignored when creating the DBIx::Class
           search to retrieve a user. This makes it possible to avoid problems when  a  credential  requires  an
           authinfo  element  whose  name overlaps with a column name in your users table.  If this doesn't make
           sense to you, you probably don't need it.

       use_userdata_from_session
           Under normal circumstances, on each request the user's data is re-retrieved from the  database  using
           the  primary  key  for  the  user  table.   When this flag is set in the configuration, it causes the
           DBIx::Class store to avoid this database hit on session restore.  Instead, the user  object's  column
           data is retrieved from the session and used as-is.

           <b>NOTE</b>:  Since  the  user  object's  column  data  is  only  stored  in  the session during the initial
           authentication of the user, turning this on can potentially lead to a situation  where  the  data  in
           "$ctx-&gt;user"  is different from what is stored the database.  You can force a reload of the data from
           the database at  any  time  by  calling  "$ctx-&gt;user-&gt;<a href="../man1/get_object.1.html">get_object</a>(1);"  Note  that  this  will  update
           "$ctx-&gt;user"  for  the  remainder  of  this request.  It will NOT update the session.  If you need to
           update the session you should call "$ctx-&gt;update_user_in_session()" as well.

       store_user_class
           This allows you to override the authentication user class that the DBIx::Class store module  uses  to
           perform  its  work.   Most  of  the  work  done  in  this  module is actually done by the user class,
           Catalyst::Authentication::Store::DBIx::Class::User, so overriding this doesn't make much sense unless
           you are using your own class to extend the functionality of the existing class.  Chances are  you  do
           not want to set this.

       id_field
           In     most     cases,    this    config    variable    does    not    need    to    be    set,    as
           Catalyst::Authentication::Store::DBIx::Class will determine the primary key of the user table on  its
           own.   If  you  need  to  override  the  default,  or your user table has multiple primary keys, then
           id_field should contain the column name that should be used to restore the user.  A  given  value  in
           this  column  should  correspond  to a single user in the database.  Note that this is used <b>ONLY</b> when
           restoring a user from the session and  has  no  bearing  whatsoever  in  the  initial  authentication
           process.   Note  also that if use_userdata_from_session is enabled, this config parameter is not used
           at all.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       The Catalyst::Authentication::Store::DBIx::Class storage module is not called directly  from  application
       code.  You interface with it through the $ctx-&gt;<b>authenticate()</b> call.

       There  are  three  methods you can use to retrieve information from the DBIx::Class storage module.  They
       are Simple retrieval, and the advanced retrieval methods Searchargs and Resultset.

   <b>Simple</b> <b>Retrieval</b>
       The first, and most common, method is simple retrieval. As its name implies simple retrieval  allows  you
       to  simply  to  provide  the column =&gt; value pairs that should be used to locate the user in question. An
       example of this usage is below:

           if ($ctx-&gt;authenticate({
                                 screen_name =&gt; $ctx-&gt;req-&gt;params-&gt;{'username'},
                                 password =&gt; $ctx-&gt;req-&gt;params-&gt;{'password'},
                                 status =&gt; [ 'registered', 'active', 'loggedin']
                                })) {

               # ... authenticated user code here
           }

       The above example would attempt to retrieve a user whose username column (here, screen_name) matched  the
       username  provided, and whose status column matched one of the values provided. These name =&gt; value pairs
       are used more or less directly in the DBIx::Class <b>search()</b>  routine,  so  in  most  cases,  you  can  use
       DBIx::Class syntax to retrieve the user according to whatever rules you have.

       NOTE:  Because  the  password in most cases is encrypted - it is not used directly but its encryption and
       comparison with the value provided is usually handled by the Password Credential. Part  of  the  Password
       Credential's  behavior is to remove the password argument from the authinfo that is passed to the storage
       module. See Catalyst::Authentication::Credential::Password.

       One thing you need to know about this retrieval method is that the name portion of the  pair  is  checked
       against the user class's column list. Pairs are only used if a matching column is found. Other pairs will
       be  ignored.  This  means  that you can only provide simple name-value pairs, and that some more advanced
       DBIx::Class constructs, such as '-or', '-and', etc. are in most cases not possible using this method. For
       queries that require this level of functionality, see the 'searchargs' method below.

   <b>Advanced</b> <b>Retrieval</b>
       The Searchargs and Resultset retrieval methods are used when more advanced  features  of  the  underlying
       DBIx::Class schema are required. These methods provide a direct interface with the DBIx::Class schema and
       therefore require a better understanding of the DBIx::Class module.

       <u>The</u> <u>dbix_class</u> <u>key</u>

       Since  the  format  of  these  arguments  are often complex, they are not keys in the base authinfo hash.
       Instead, both of these arguments are placed within a hash attached to the store-specific 'dbix_class' key
       in the base $authinfo hash.  When the DBIx::Class authentication store sees the 'dbix_class' key  in  the
       passed  authinfo  hash,  all  the  other  information in the authinfo hash is ignored and only the values
       within the 'dbix_class' hash are used as though they were passed directly within the authinfo  hash.   In
       other words, if 'dbix_class' is present, it replaces the authinfo hash for processing purposes.

       The  'dbix_class'  hash  can  be used to directly pass arguments to the DBIx::Class authentication store.
       Reasons to do this are to avoid credential modification of the authinfo hash, or to avoid overlap between
       credential and store key names. It's a good idea to avoid using it in this way unless you  are  sure  you
       have  an  overlap/modification issue. However, the two advanced retrieval methods, <b>searchargs</b>, <b>result</b> and
       <b>resultset</b>, require its use, as they are only processed as part of the 'dbix_class' hash.

       Searchargs
           The <b>searchargs</b> method of retrieval allows you to specify an arrayref containing the two arguments  to
           the  <b>search()</b>  method  from DBIx::Class::ResultSet.  If provided, all other args are ignored, and the
           search args provided are used directly to locate the user.  An example will probably make more sense:

               if ($ctx-&gt;authenticate(
                   {
                       password =&gt; $password,
                       'dbix_class' =&gt;
                           {
                               searchargs =&gt; [ { -or =&gt; [ username =&gt; $username,
                                                         email =&gt; $email,
                                                         clientid =&gt; $clientid ]
                                              },
                                              { prefetch =&gt; qw/ preferences / }
                                            ]
                           }
                   } ) )
               {
                   # do successful authentication actions here.
               }

           The above would allow authentication based on any of the three items - username, email, or clientid -
           and would prefetch the data related to that user from the preferences table. The searchargs array  is
           passed directly to the <b>search()</b> method associated with the user_model.

       Result
           The <b>result</b> method of retrieval allows you to look up the user yourself and pass on the loaded user to
           the authentication store.

               my $user = $ctx-&gt;model('MyApp::User')-&gt;find({ ... });

               if ($ctx-&gt;authenticate({ dbix_class =&gt; { result =&gt; $user } })) {
                   ...
               }

           Be aware that the result method will not verify that you are passing a result that is attached to the
           same  user_model  as specified in the config or even loaded from the database, as opposed to existing
           only in memory. It's your responsibility to make sure of that.

       Resultset
           The <b>resultset</b> method of retrieval allows you to directly specify a resultset  to  be  used  for  user
           retrieval.  This  allows you to create a resultset within your login action and use it for retrieving
           the user. A simple example:

               my $rs = $ctx-&gt;model('MyApp::User')-&gt;search({ email =&gt; $ctx-&gt;request-&gt;params-&gt;{'email'} });
                  ... # further $rs adjustments

               if ($ctx-&gt;authenticate({
                                      password =&gt; $password,
                                      'dbix_class' =&gt; { resultset =&gt; $rs }
                                    })) {
                  # do successful authentication actions here.
               }

           Be aware that the resultset method will not verify that you are passing a resultset that is  attached
           to the same user_model as specified in the config.

           NOTE:  The  resultset and searchargs methods of user retrieval, consider the first row returned to be
           the matching user. In most cases there will be only one matching row,  but  it  is  easy  to  produce
           multiple  rows, especially when using the advanced retrieval methods. Remember, what you get when you
           use this module is what you would get when calling search(...)-&gt;first;

           NOTE ALSO:  The user info used to save the user to the  session  and  to  retrieve  it  is  the  same
           regardless of what method of retrieval was used.  In short, the value in the id field (see 'id_field'
           config  item)  is  used to retrieve the user from the database upon restoring from the session.  When
           the DBIx::Class storage module does this, it does so by doing a simple search using the id field.  In
           other words, it will not use the same arguments you used to request  the  user  initially.   This  is
           especially  important  to  those  using  the  advanced  methods  of user retrieval.  If you need more
           complicated logic when reviving the user from the session, you will most likely want to subclass  the
           Catalyst::Authentication::Store::DBIx::Class::User   class  and  provide  your  own  for_session  and
           from_session routines.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       There are no publicly exported routines in the  DBIx::Class  authentication  store  (or  indeed  in  most
       authentication   stores).   However,   below   is   a   description   of   the   routines   required   by
       Catalyst::Plugin::Authentication for  all  authentication  stores.   Please  see  the  documentation  for
       Catalyst::Plugin::Authentication::Internals for more information.

   <b>new</b> <b>(</b> <b>$config,</b> <b>$app</b> <b>)</b>
       Constructs a new store object.

   <b>find_user</b> <b>(</b> <b>$authinfo,</b> <b>$c</b> <b>)</b>
       Finds  a  user  using the information provided in the $authinfo hashref and returns the user, or undef on
       failure.  This  is  usually  called  from  the  Credential.  This  translates  directly  to  a  call   to
       Catalyst::Authentication::Store::DBIx::Class::User's <b>load()</b> method.

   <b>for_session</b> <b>(</b> <b>$c,</b> <b>$user</b> <b>)</b>
       Prepares  a  user  to  be  stored  in the session. Currently returns the value of the user's id field (as
       indicated by the 'id_field' config element)

   <b>from_session</b> <b>(</b> <b>$c,</b> <b>$frozenuser)</b>
       Revives a user from the session based on the info provided in $frozenuser.  Currently treats  $frozenuser
       as an id and retrieves a user with a matching id.

   <b>user_supports</b>
       Provides information about what the user object supports.

   <b>auto_update_user(</b> <b>$authinfo,</b> <b>$c,</b> <b>$res</b> <b>)</b>
       This  method  is  called  if  the  realm's auto_update_user setting is true. It will delegate to the user
       object's "auto_update" method.

   <b>auto_create_user(</b> <b>$authinfo,</b> <b>$c</b> <b>)</b>
       This method is called if the realm's auto_create_user setting is true.  It  will  delegate  to  the  user
       class's (resultset) "auto_create" method.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       As  of  the current release, session storage consists of simply storing the user's id in the session, and
       then using that same id to re-retrieve the user's information from the database upon restoration from the
       session.  More dynamic storage of user information in the session is intended for a future release.
