</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       perlcdio - lower-level wrapper to libcdio, the CD Input and Control library

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       This is fairly straight-forward wrapper around the C library libcdio.  Although this is perfectly usable
       on its own, it is expected that the Object-Oriented interface Device::Cdio is what most people will want
       to use.

       There are various constants that are defined here.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Encapsulation is done in two parts. The lower-level Perl interface is called perlcdio (this file) and is
       generated via SWIG.

</pre><h4><b>CONSTANTS</b></h4><pre>

       DRIVER_UNKNOWN

       INVALID_LSN
           Canonical value used for an invalid LSN.

       INVALID_TRACK
           Canonical value used for an invalid track number. (Valid range is 0 to 99.)

       LEADOUT_TRACK
           Canonical value for the "leadout" or track just after the last track. So again this value is  outside
           the  range 0 to 99.  The leadout track is often used to get the last LSN or LBA. The libcdio routines
           also allow the last actual track plus one as a synonym for the leadout track.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>cdio_version</b>
           perlcdio::cdio_version

       Returns the libcdio version string Device::Cdio is currently linked with.

   <b>this</b>
       This seems to be an artifact of SWIG.
