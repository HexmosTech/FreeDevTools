</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       perliso9660 - lower-level wrapper to libiso9660, the ISO 9660 library of the CD Input and Control package

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       This is fairly straight-forward wrapper around the C library libiso9660 Although this is perfectly usable
       on its own, it is expected that the Object-Oriented interface Device::Cdio::ISO9660 is what most people
       will want to use.

       There are various constants that are defined here.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Encapsulation is done in two parts. The lower-level Perl interface is called perliso9660 (this file) and
       is generated via SWIG.

</pre><h4><b>CONSTANTS</b></h4><pre>

</pre><h4><b>SUBROUTINES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Input</b> <b>Output</b>
       <u>open_iso</u>

       Open an ISO 9660 image for reading. Maybe in the future we will have mode. undef is returned on error.

       <u>open_ext</u>

       Open an ISO 9660 image for reading allowing various ISO 9660 extensions.  Maybe in  the  future  we  will
       have a mode. undef is eturned on error.

       <u>open_fuzzy</u>

       Open  an ISO 9660 image for reading with some tolerence for positioning of the ISO9660 image. We scan for
       $perliso9660::ISO_STANDARD_ID and use that to set he eventual offset to adjust by (as long as that is  &lt;=
       i_fuzz).

       Maybe in the future we will have a mode. undef is returned on error.

       See also open_iso

       <u>open_fuzzy_ext</u>

       Open  an ISO 9660 image for reading with some tolerence for positioning of the ISO9660 image. We scan for
       ISO_STANDARD_ID and use that to set the eventual offset to adjust by (as long as that is &lt;= i_fuzz).

       Maybe in the future we will have a mode. undef is returned on error.

       <u>ifs_fuzzy_read_superblock</u>

       Read the Super block of an ISO 9660 image but determine framesize and datastart and a possible additional
       offset. Generally here we are not reading an ISO 9660 image but a CD-Image which  contains  an  ISO  9660
       filesystem.

       <u>close</u>

       Close  previously opened ISO 9660 image.  1 is unconditionally returned. If there was an error 0 would be
       returned.

       <u>seek_read</u>

       Seek to a position and then read n bytes. (buffer, size) are is returned.

       <u>fs_read_pvd</u>

       Read the Primary Volume Descriptor for a CD.  1 is returned if read, and 0 if there was an error.

       <u>ifs_read_pvd</u>

       Read the Primary Volume Descriptor for an ISO 9660 image.  1 is returned if read, and 0 if there  was  an
       error.

       <b>_</b><u>fs_read_superblock</u>

       Read  the  Super  block  of  an ISO 9660 image. This is the Primary Volume Descriptor (PVD) and perhaps a
       Supplemental Volume Descriptor if (Joliet) extensions are acceptable.

       <u>ifs_read_superblock</u>

       Read the Super block of an ISO 9660 image. This is the Primary Volume  Descriptor  (PVD)  and  perhaps  a
       Supplemental Volume Descriptor if (Joliet) extensions are acceptable.

   <b>Time</b> <b>Conversion</b>
       <u>set_dtime</u>

       Set time in format used in ISO 9660 directory index record from a Unix time structure.

       <u>set_ltime</u>

       Set "long" time in format used in ISO 9660 primary volume descriptor from a Unix time structure.

       <u>get_dtime</u>

       Get  Unix  time  structure from format use in an ISO 9660 directory index record. Even though tm_wday and
       tm_yday fields are not explicitly in dtime, they are calculated from the other fields.

       If tm is to reflect the localtime, set "use_localtime" 1, otherwise tm will reported in GMT.

       <u>get_ltime</u>

       Get "long" time in format used in ISO 9660 primary volume descriptor from a Unix time structure.

   <b>Character</b> <b>Classification</b> <b>and</b> <b>String</b> <b>Manipulation</b>
       <u>is_dchar</u>

       Return 1 if c (an int) is a DCHAR - a character that can appear in an an ISO-9600 level 1 directory name.
       These are the ASCII capital letters A-Z, the digits 0-9 and an underscore.

       <u>is_achar</u>

       <u>name_translate</u>

       Convert an ISO-9660 file name that stored in a directory entry into what is usually listed  as  the  file
       name  in  a  listing.   wercase  name, and remove trailing ;1's or .;1's and turn the others into version
       numbers.

       <u>name_translate_ext</u>

       Convert an ISO-9660 file name that stored in a directory entry into what is usually listed  as  the  file
       name  in  a listing.  Lowercase name if no Joliet Extension interpretation. Remove trailing ;1's or .;1's
       and turn the others into version numbers.

       <u>strncpy_pad</u>

       Pad string src with spaces to size len and copy this to dst. If len is less than the length of  src,  dst
       will be truncated to the first len characters of src.

       src  can  also  be  scanned to see if it contains only ACHARs, DCHARs, 7-bit ASCII chars depending on the
       enumeration _check.

       In addition to getting changed, dst  is  the  return  value.   Note:  this  string  might  not  be  undef
       terminated.

   <b>File</b> <b>and</b> <b>Directory</b> <b>Names</b>
       <u>dirname_valid_p</u>

       Check that psz_path is a valid ISO-9660 directory name.

       A  valid  directory name should not start out with a slash (/), dot (.) or null byte, should be less than
       37 characters long, have no more than 8 characters in a directory component which is separated  by  a  /,
       and consist of only DCHARs.

       1 is returned if psz_path is valid.

       <u>pathname_isofy</u>

       Take  psz_path  and  a version number and turn that into a ISO-9660 pathname.  (That is just the pathname
       followed by ";" and the version number. For example, mydir/file.ext -&gt; MYDIR/FILE.EXT;1  for  version  1.
       The resulting ISO-9660 pathname is returned.

       <u>pathname_valid_p</u>

       Check that psz_path is a valid ISO-9660 pathname.

       A  valid  pathname  contains a valid directory name, if one appears and the filename portion should be no
       more than 8 characters for the file prefix and 3 characters in the extension (or portion  after  a  dot).
       There  should be exactly one dot somewhere in the filename portion and the filename should be composed of
       only DCHARs.

       1 is returned if psz_path is valid.

       <u>fs_find_lsn</u>

       Given a directory pointer, find the filesystem entry that contains lsn and return information about it.

       Returns stat_t of entry if we found lsn, or undef otherwise.

       Return file status for psz_path. undef is returned on error.

       <u>fs_stat_translate</u>

       Return file status for path name psz_path. undef is returned on error.  pathname version numbers  in  the

       <u>ifs_stat</u>

       Return file status for pathname. undef is returned on error.

       <u>ifs_stat_translate</u>

       Return  file  status for path name psz_path. undef is returned on error.  pathname version numbers in the
       ISO 9660 name are dropped, i.e. ;1 is removed and if level 1 ISO-9660 names are lowercased.

       <u>fs_readdir</u>

       Read psz_path (a directory) and return a list of  iso9660_stat_t  pointers  for  the  files  inside  that
       directory. The caller must free the returned result.

       <u>ifs_readdir</u>

       Read  psz_path  (a  directory)  and  return  a  list of iso9660_stat_t pointers for the files inside that
