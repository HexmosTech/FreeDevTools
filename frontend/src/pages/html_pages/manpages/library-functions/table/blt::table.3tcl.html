</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>table</b>  command  arranges widgets in a table.  The alignment of widgets is detemined by their row and
       column positions and the number of rows or columns that they span.

</pre><h4><b>INTRODUCTION</b></h4><pre>
       Probably the most painstaking aspect of building a graphical application is  getting  the  placement  and
       size  of  the  widgets  just  right.   It usually takes many iterations to align widgets and adjust their
       spacing.  That's because managing the geometry of widgets is simply  not  a  packing  problem,  but  also
       graphical  design  problem.   Attributes such as alignment, symmetry, and balance are more important than
       minimizing the amount of space used for packing.

       The <b>table</b> geometry manager arranges widgets in a table.  It's easy to  align  widgets  (horizontally  and
       vertically)  or  to create empty space to balance the arrangement of the widgets.  Widgets (called <u>slaves</u>
       in the Tk parlance) are arranged inside a containing widget (called the <u>master</u>).  Widgets are  positioned
       at  row,column  locations  and may span any number of rows or columns.  More than one widget can occupy a
       single location.

       The placement of widget windows determines both the size and arrangement of the table.  The table queries
       the requested size of each widget.  The <u>requested</u> <u>size</u> of a widget is the  natural  size  of  the  widget
       (before  the  widget  is shrunk or expanded).  The height of each row and the width of each column is the
       largest widget spanning that row or column.  The size of the table is in turn the  sum  of  the  row  and
       column sizes.  This is the table's <u>normal</u> <u>size</u>.

       The  total  number  of  rows  and columns in a table is determined from the indices specified.  The table
       grows dynamically as windows are added at larger indices.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       The table geometry manager is created by invoking the <b>table</b> command.

              # Create a table in the root window
              table .

       The window <b>.</b> is now the <u>container</u> of the table.  Widgets are packed into the table and  displayed  within
       the confines of the container.

       You add widgets to the table by row and column location.  Row and column indices start from zero.

              label .title -text "This is a title"

              # Add a label to the table
              table . .title 0,0

       The label <b>.title</b> is added to the table.  We can add more widgets in the same way.

              button .ok -text "Ok"
              button .cancel -text "Cancel"

              # Add two buttons
              table . .ok 1,0
              table . .cancel 1,1

       Two  buttons  <b>.ok</b> and <b>.cancel</b> are now packed into the second row of the table.  They each occupy one cell
       of the table.  By default, widgets span only a single row and column.

       The first column contains two widgets, <b>.title</b> and <b>.ok</b>.  By default, the widest of the  two  widgets  will
       define the width of the column.  However, we want <b>.title</b> to be centered horizontally along the top of the
       table.  We can make <b>.title</b> span two columns using the <b>configure</b> operation.

              # Make the label span both columns
              table configure . .title -cspan 2

       The label <b>.title</b> will now be centered along the top row of the table.

       In  the  above  example,  we've  create  and arranged the layout for the table invoking the <b>table</b> command
       several times.  Alternately, we could have used a single <b>table</b> command.

              label .title -text "This is a title"
              button .ok -text "Ok"
              button .cancel -text "Cancel"

              # Create and pack the table
              table . \
                  .title  0,0 -cspan 2 \
                  .ok     1,0 \
                  .cancel 1,1

       The table will override the requested width and height of the container so that the window fits the table
       exactly.  This also means that any change to the size of table will  be  propagated  up  through  the  Tk
       window hierarchy.  This feature can be turned off using the <b>configure</b> operation again.

              table configure . -propagate no

       You  can  also  set  the width of height of the table to a specific value. This supersedes the calculated
       table size.

              # Make the container 4 inches wide, 3 inches high
              table configure . -reqwidth 4i -reqheight 3i

       If a widget is smaller than the cell(s) it occupies, the widget will float within the  extra  space.   By
       default,  the widget will be centered within the space, but you can anchor the widget to any side of cell
       using the <b>-anchor</b> configuration option.

              table configure . .ok -anchor w

       The <b>-fill</b> option expands the widget to fill the extra space either vertically or horizontally (or both).

              # Make the title label fill the entire top row
              table configure . .title -cspan 2 -fill x

              # Each button will be as height of the 2nd row.
              table configure . .ok .cancel -fill y

       The width of <b>.title</b> will be the combined widths of both columns.  Both <b>.ok</b> and  <b>.cancel</b>  will  become  as
       tall as the second row.

       The <b>-padx</b> and <b>-pady</b> options control the amount of padding around the widget.  Both options take a list of
       one or two values.

              # Pad the title by two pixels above and below.
              table configure . .title -pady 2

              # Pad each button 2 pixels on the left, and 4 on the right.
              table configure . .ok .cancel -padx { 2 4 }

       If the list has only one value, then both exterior sides (top and bottom or left and right) of the widget
       are padded by that amount.  If the list has two elements, the first specifies padding for the top or left
       side and the second for the bottom or right side.

       Like the container, you can also override the requested widths and heights of widgets using the <b>-reqwidth</b>
       and <b>-reqheight</b> options.  This is especially useful with character-based widgets (such as buttons, labels,
       text,  listbox,  etc)  that  let you specify their size only in units of characters and lines, instead of
       pixels.

              # Make all buttons one inch wide
              table configure . .ok .cancel -reqwidth 1i

       Each row and column of the table can be configured, again using the <b>configure</b> operation.   Rows  are  and
       columns are designated by <b>R</b><u>i</u> and <b>C</b><u>i</u> respectively, where <u>i</u> is the index of the row or column.

       For example, you can set the size of a row or column.

              # Make the 1st column 2 inches wide
              table configure . c0 -width 2.0i

              # Make the 2nd row 1/2 inch high.
              table configure . r1 -height 0.5i

       The  new size for the row or column overrides its calculated size.  If no widgets span the row or column,
       its height or width is zero.  So you can use the <b>-width</b> and <b>-height</b> options to create empty spaces in the
       table.

              # Create an empty row and column
              table configure . r2 c2 -width 1i

       The <b>-pady</b> option lets you add padding to the top and bottom sides of rows.  The <b>-padx</b> option adds padding
       to the left and right sides of columns.  Both options take a list of one or two values.

              # Pad above the title by two pixels
              table configure . r0 -pady { 2 0 }

              # Pad each column 4 pixels on the left, and 2 on the right.
              table configure . c* -padx { 2 4 }

       Notice that you can configure all the rows and columns using either <b>R*</b> or <b>C*</b>.

       When the container is resized, the rows and columns of the table are also  resized.   Only  the  rows  or
       columns  that  contain  widgets  (a  widget  spans the row or column) grow or shrink.  The <b>-resize</b> option
       indicates whether the row or column can be shrunk or stretched.  If the  value  is  <b>shrink</b>,  the  row  or
       column  can  only  be  resized  smaller.   If <b>expand</b>, it can only be resized larger.  If <b>none</b>, the row or
       column is frozen at its requested size.

              # Let the 1st column get smaller, but not bigger
              table configure . c0 -resize shrink

              # Let the 2nd column get bigger, not smaller
              table configure . c1 -resize expand

              # Don't resize the first row
              table configure . r0 -resize none

       The following example packs a canvas, two scrollbars, and a title.  The rows and columns  containing  the
       scrollbars  are frozen at their requested size, so that even if the frame is resized, the scrollbars will
       remain the same width.

              table . \
                  .title   0,0 -cspan 3 \
                  .canvas  1,1 -fill both \
                  .vscroll 1,2 -fill y \
                  .hscroll 2,1 -fill x

              # Don't let the scrollbars resize
              table configure . c2 r2 -resize none

              # Create an empty space to balance the scrollbar
              table configure . c0 -width .vscroll

       Note that the value of the <b>-width</b> option is the name of a widget window.  This indicates that  the  width
       of the column should be the same as the requested width of <b>.vscroll</b>.

       Finally, the <b>forget</b> operation removes widgets from the table.

              # Remove the windows from the table
              table forget .quit .frame

       It's  not necessary to specify the container.  The <b>table</b> command determines the container from the widget
       name.

</pre><h4><b>OPERATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following operations are available for the <b>table</b>:

       <b>table</b> <u>container</u> ?<u>widget</u> <u>index</u> <u>option</u> <u>value</u>?...
              Adds the widget <u>widget</u> to the table at <u>index</u>.  <u>Index</u> is a row,column position in  the  table.   It
              must  be  in  the  form <u>row</u>,<u>column</u> where <u>row</u> and <u>column</u> are the respective row and column numbers,
              starting from zero (0,0 is the upper leftmost position).  <u>Row</u>  and  <u>column</u>  may  also  be  numeric
              expressions  that  are  recursively  evaluated.   If  a  table doesn't exist for <u>container</u>, one is
              created.  <u>Widget</u> is the path name of the window, that must already exist, to be arranged inside of
              <u>container</u>. <u>Option</u> and <u>value</u> are described in the <b>WIDGET</b> <b>OPTIONS</b> section.

       <b>table</b> <b>arrange</b> <u>container</u>
              Forces the table to compute its layout immediately.  Normally, the  table  geometry  manager  will
              wait  until  the  next  idle  point, before calculating the size of its rows and columns.  This is
              useful for collecting the <u>normal</u> sizes of rows and columns, that  are  based  upon  the  requested
              widget sizes.

       <b>table</b> <b>cget</b> <u>container</u> ?<u>item</u>? <u>option</u>
              Returns  the  current value of the configuration option specific to <u>item</u> given by <u>option</u>.  <u>Item</u> is
              either a row or column index, or the path name of a widget.  <u>Item</u> can be in any form  describe  in
              the  <b>configure</b>  operation below. If no <u>item</u> argument is provided, then the configuration option is
              for the table itself.  <u>Option</u> may be any one of the options described in  the  appropiate  section
              for <u>item</u>.

       <b>table</b> <b>configure</b> <u>container</u> <u>item</u>... ?<u>option</u> <u>value</u>?...
              Queries  or  modifies the configuration options specific to <u>item</u>.  If no <u>option</u> is specified, this
              command returns a list describing all of the available options for <u>item</u> If the  argument  <u>item</u>  is
              omitted,  then  the specified configuration options are for the table itself.  Otherwise <u>item</u> must
              be either a row or column specification, or the path name of a widget.  The following  <u>item</u>  types
              are available.

              <b>C</b><u>i</u>     Specifies  the  column of <u>container</u> to be configured.  <u>Item</u> must be in the form <b>C</b><u>n</u>, where <u>i</u>
                     is the index of the column.  See the <b>COLUMN</b> <b>OPTIONS</b> section.

              <b>R</b><u>i</u>     Specifies the row of <u>container</u> to be configured. <u>Item</u> must be in the form <b>R</b><u>i</u>,  where  <u>i</u>  is
                     the index of the row.  See the <b>ROW</b> <b>OPTIONS</b> section.

              <u>widget</u> Specifies  a widget of <u>container</u> to be queried.  <u>Widget</u> is the path name of a widget packed
                     in <u>container</u>.  See the <b>WIDGET</b> <b>OPTIONS</b> section.

              No argument
                     Specifies that the table itself is to be queried.  See the  <b>TABLE</b>  <b>OPTIONS</b>  section  for  a
                     description of the option-value pairs for the table.

              The  <u>option</u>  <u>and</u> <u>value</u> pairs are specific to <u>item</u>.  If <u>option</u> is specified with no <u>value</u>, then the
              command returns a list describing the one named  option  (this  list  will  be  identical  to  the
              corresponding  sublist  of  the  value  returned  if  no  <u>option</u>  is  specified).   If one or more
              <u>option-value</u> pairs are specified, then the command modifies the given option(s) to have the  given
              value(s); in this case the command returns the empty string.

       <b>table</b> <b>extents</b> <u>container</u> <u>index</u>
              Queries the location and dimensions of row and columns in the table.  <u>Index</u> can be either a row or
              column  index  or  a  table  index.   Returns a list of the x,y coordinates (upperleft corner) and
              dimensions (width and height) of the cell, row, or column.

       <b>table</b> <b>forget</b> <u>widget</u> ?<u>widget</u>?...
              Requests that <u>widget</u> no longer have its geometry managed.  <u>Widget</u> is the pathname  of  the  window
              currently  managed  by some table. The window will be unmapped so that it no longer appears on the
              screen.  If <u>widget</u> is not currently managed by any table, an error message is returned,  otherwise
              the empty string.

       <b>table</b> <b>info</b> <u>container</u> <u>item</u>
              Returns a list of the current configuration options for <u>item</u>.  The list returned is exactly in the
              form  that  might  be  specified  to  the  <b>table</b>  command.  It can be used to save and reset table
              configurations. <u>Item</u> must be one of the following.

              <b>C</b><u>i</u>     Specifies the column of <u>container</u> to be queried.  <u>Item</u> must be in the form <b>C</b><u>n</u>, where  <u>n</u>  is
                     the index of the column.

              <b>R</b><u>i</u>     Specifies  the  row of <u>container</u> to be queried. <u>Item</u> must be in the form <b>R</b><u>i</u>, where <u>i</u> is the
                     index of the row.

              <u>widget</u> Specifies a widget of <u>container</u> to be queried.  <u>Widget</u> is the path name of a widget  packed
                     in <u>container</u>.

              No argument
                     Specifies that the table itself is to be queried.

       <b>table</b> <b>locate</b> <u>container</u> <u>x</u> <u>y</u>
              Returns  the  table index (row,column) of the cell containing the given screen coordinates.  The <u>x</u>
              and <u>y</u> arguments represent the x and y coordinates of the sample point to be tested.

       <b>table</b> <b>containers</b> ?<u>switch</u> <u>arg</u>?
              Returns a list of all container windows matching a given criteria (using <u>switch</u> and <u>arg</u>).   If  no
              <u>switch</u> and <u>arg</u> arguments are given, the names of all container windows (only those using the <b>table</b>
              command) are returned.  The following are valid switches:

              <b>-pattern</b> <u>pattern</u>
                     Returns a list of pathnames of all container windows matching <u>pattern</u>.

              <b>-slave</b> <u>window</u>
                     Returns the name of the container window of table managing <u>window</u>.  <u>Window</u> must be the path
                     name of widget.  If <u>window</u> is not managed by any table, the empty string is returned.

       <b>table</b> <b>search</b> <u>container</u> ?<u>switch</u> <u>arg</u>?...
              Returns  the  names of all the widgets in <u>container</u> matching the criteria given by <u>switch</u> and <u>arg</u>.
              <u>Container</u> is name of the container window associated with the table to be searched.  The  name  of
              the  widget  is  returned  if  any one <u>switch</u>-<u>arg</u> criteria matches. If no <u>switch</u>-<u>arg</u> arguments are
              given, the names of all widgets managed by <u>container</u> are returned.  The following are switches are
              available:

              <b>-pattern</b> <u>pattern</u>
                     Returns the names of any names of the widgets matching <u>pattern</u>.

              <b>-span</b> <u>index</u>
                     Returns the names of widgets that span <u>index</u>. A widget does not need to start at  <u>index</u>  to
                     be  included.  <u>Index</u> must be in the form <u>row</u>,<u>column</u>, where <u>row</u> and <u>column</u> are valid row and
                     column numbers.

              <b>-start</b> <u>index</u>
                     Returns the names of widgets that start at <u>index</u>.  <u>Index</u> must be in  the  form  <u>row</u>,<u>column</u>,
                     where <u>row</u> and <u>column</u> are valid row and column numbers.

</pre><h4><b>TABLE</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       To configure the table itself, you omit the <u>item</u> argument when invoking the <b>configure</b> operation.

              <b>table</b> <b>configure</b> <u>container</u> ?<u>option</u> <u>value</u>?...

       The following options are available for the table:

              <b>-padx</b> <u>pad</u>
                     Sets  how  much  padding to add to the left and right exteriors of the table.  <u>Pad</u> can be a
                     list of one or two numbers.  If <u>pad</u> has two elements, the left side of the table is  padded
                     by the first value and the right side by the second value.  If <u>pad</u> has just one value, both
                     the left and right sides are padded evenly by the value.  The default is <b>0</b>.

              <b>-pady</b> <u>pad</u>
                     Sets  how  much  padding to add to the top and bottom exteriors of the table.  <u>Pad</u> can be a
                     list of one or two numbers.  If <u>pad</u> has two elements, the area above the table is padded by
                     the first value and the area below by the second value.  If <u>pad</u> is just  one  number,  both
                     the top and bottom areas are padded by the value.  The default is <b>0</b>.

              <b>-propagate</b> <u>boolean</u>
                     Indicates  if  the  table  should  override the requested width and height of the <u>container</u>
                     window.  If <u>boolean</u> is false, <u>container</u>  will  not  be  resized.   <u>Container</u>  will  be  its
                     requested size.  The default is <b>1</b>.

</pre><h4><b>WIDGET</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       widgets are configured by specifying the name of the widget when invoking the <b>configure</b> operation.  <b>table</b>
       <b>configure</b>  <u>container</u> <u>widget</u> ?<u>option</u> <u>value</u>?...  <u>Widget</u> must be the path name of a window already packed in
       the table associated with <u>container</u>.  The following options are available for widgets:

              <b>-anchor</b> <u>anchor</u>
                     Anchors <u>widget</u> to a particular edge of the cell(s) it resides.  This option has effect only
                     if the space of the spans surrounding <u>widget</u> is larger than <u>widget</u>.  <u>Anchor</u>  specifies  how
                     <u>widget</u>  will  be positioned in the space.  For example, if <u>anchor</u> is <b>center</b> then the window
                     is centered in the rows and columns it spans; if <u>anchor</u>  is  <b>w</b>  then  the  window  will  be
                     aligned with the leftmost edge of the span. The default is <b>center</b>.

              <b>-columnspan</b> <u>number</u>
                     Sets the number of columns <u>widget</u> will span.  The default is <b>1</b>.

              <b>-columncontrol</b> <u>control</u>
                     Specifies how the width of <u>widget</u> should control the width of the columns it spans. <u>Control</u>
                     is either <b>normal</b>, <b>none</b>, or <b>full</b>.  The default is <b>normal</b>.

                     <b>none</b>      The width of <u>widget</u> is not considered.

                     <b>full</b>      Only  the  width  of  <u>widget</u>  will be considered when computing the widths of the
                               columns.

                     <b>normal</b>    Indicates that the widest widget spanning the column will determine the width  of
                               the span.

              <b>-fill</b> <u>fill</u>
                     Specifies  if  <u>widget</u>  should  be  stretched to fill any free space in the span surrounding
                     <u>widget</u>. <u>Fill</u> is either <b>none</b>, <b>x</b>, <b>y</b>, <b>both</b>.  The default is <b>none</b>.

                     <b>x</b>         The widget can grow horizontally.

                     <b>y</b>         The widget can grow vertically.

                     <b>both</b>      The widget can grow both vertically and horizontally.

                     <b>none</b>      The widget does not grow along with the span.

              <b>-ipadx</b> <u>pixels</u>
                     Sets how much horizontal padding to add internally on the left and right sides  of  <u>widget</u>.
                     <u>Pixels</u> must be a valid screen distance like <b>2</b> or <b>0.3i</b>.  The default is <b>0</b>.

              <b>-ipady</b> <u>pixels</u>
                     Sets  how  much vertical padding to add internally on the top and bottom of <u>widget</u>.  <u>Pixels</u>
                     must be a valid screen distance like <b>2</b> or <b>0.3i</b>.  The default is <b>0</b>.

              <b>-padx</b> <u>pad</u>
                     Sets how much padding to add to the left and right exteriors of <u>widget</u>.  <u>Pad</u> can be a  list
                     of  one  or two numbers.  If <u>pad</u> has two elements, the left side of <u>widget</u> is padded by the
                     first value and the right side by the second value.  If <u>pad</u> has just one  value,  both  the
                     left and right sides are padded evenly by the value.  The default is <b>0</b>.

              <b>-pady</b> <u>pad</u>
                     Sets  how much padding to add to the top and bottom exteriors of <u>widget</u>.  <u>Pad</u> can be a list
                     of one or two numbers.  If <u>pad</u> has two elements, the area above <u>widget</u>  is  padded  by  the
                     first  value  and  the area below by the second value.  If <u>pad</u> is just one number, both the
                     top and bottom areas are padded by the value.  The default is <b>0</b>.

              <b>-reqheight</b> <u>height</u>
                     Specifies the limits of the requested height for <u>widget</u>.  <u>Height</u>  is  a  list  of  bounding
                     values.   See  the  <b>BOUNDING</b> <b>SIZES</b> section for a description of this list.  By default, the
                     height of <u>widget</u> is its requested height with its internal padding (see the <b>-ipady</b> option).
                     The bounds specified by <u>height</u> either override the height completely, or bound  the  height
                     between two sizes.  The default is <b>""</b>.

              <b>-reqwidth</b> <u>width</u>
                     Specifies  the  limits  of  the  requested  width  for <u>widget</u>.  <u>Width</u> is a list of bounding
                     values.  See the <b>BOUNDING</b> <b>SIZES</b> section for a description of this list.   By  default,  the
                     width  of  <u>widget</u> is its requested width with its internal padding (set the <b>-ipadx</b> option).
                     The bounds specified by <u>width</u> either override the width completely,  or  bound  the  height
                     between two sizes.  The default is <b>""</b>.

              <b>-rowspan</b> <u>number</u>
                     Sets the number of rows <u>widget</u> will span. The default is <b>1</b>.

              <b>-rowcontrol</b> <u>control</u>
                     Specifies  how the height of <u>widget</u> should control the height of the rows it spans. <u>Control</u>
                     is either <b>normal</b>, <b>none</b>, or <b>full</b>.  The default is <b>normal</b>.

                     <b>none</b>      The height of <u>widget</u> is not considered.

                     <b>full</b>      Only the height of <u>widget</u> will be considered when computing the  heights  of  the
                               rows.

                     <b>normal</b>    Indicates  that  the tallest widget spanning the row will determine the height of
                               the span.

</pre><h4><b>COLUMN</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       To configure a column in the table, specify the column index as <b>C</b><u>i</u>, where <u>i</u> is the index of the column to
       be configured.  <b>table</b> <b>configure</b> <u>container</u> <b>C</b><u>i</u> ?<u>option</u> <u>value</u>?...  If the index is specified as <b>C*</b>, then all
       columns of the table will be configured.  The following options are available for table columns.

              <b>-padx</b> <u>pad</u>
                     Sets the padding to the left and right of the column.  <u>Pad</u> can be a  list  of  one  or  two
                     numbers.  If <u>pad</u> has two elements, the left side of the column is padded by the first value
                     and the right side by the second value.  If <u>pad</u> has just one value, both the left and right
                     sides are padded evenly by the value.  The default is <b>0</b>.

              <b>-resize</b> <u>mode</u>
                     Indicates  that  the column can expand or shrink from its requested width when the table is
                     resized.  <u>Mode</u> must be one of the following: <b>none</b>, <b>expand</b>, <b>shrink</b>, or  <b>both</b>.   If  <u>mode</u>  is
                     <b>expand</b> the width of the column is expanded if there is extra space in the container window.
                     If  <u>mode</u>  is  <b>shrink</b>  its  width  may be reduced beyond its requested width if there is not
                     enough space in the container.  The default is <b>none</b>.

              <b>-width</b> <u>width</u>
                     Specifies the limits within that the width of the column may expand or shrink.  <u>Width</u> is  a
                     list  of  bounding  values.  See the section <b>BOUNDING</b> <b>SIZES</b> for a description of this list.
                     By default there are no constraints.

</pre><h4><b>ROW</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       To configure a row in the table, specify the row index as <b>R</b><u>i</u>, where <u>i</u> is the  index  of  the  row  to  be
       configured.   <b>table</b>  <b>configure</b>  <u>container</u> <b>R</b><u>i</u> ?<u>option</u> <u>value</u>?...  If the index is specified as <b>R*</b>, then all
       rows of the table will be configured.  The following options are available for table rows.

              <b>-height</b> <u>height</u>
                     Specifies the limits of the height that the row may expand or shrink to.  <u>Height</u> is a  list
                     of  bounding  values.   See  the section <b>BOUNDING</b> <b>SIZES</b> for a description of this list.  By
                     default there are no constraints.

              <b>-pady</b> <u>pad</u>
                     Sets the padding above and below the row.  <u>Pad</u> can be a list of one or two numbers.  If <u>pad</u>
                     has two elements, the area above the row is padded by the first value and the area below by
                     the second value.  If <u>pad</u> is just one number, both the top and bottom areas are  padded  by
                     the value.  The default is <b>0</b>.

              <b>-resize</b> <u>mode</u>
                     Indicates  that  the  row  can expand or shrink from its requested height when the table is
                     resized.  <u>Mode</u> must be one of the following: <b>none</b>, <b>expand</b>, <b>shrink</b>, or  <b>both</b>.   If  <u>mode</u>  is
                     <b>expand</b>  the height of the row is expanded if there is extra space in the container. If <u>mode</u>
                     is <b>shrink</b> its height may be reduced beyond its requested height  if  there  is  not  enough
                     space in the container. The default is <b>none</b>.

</pre><h4><b>BOUNDING</b> <b>SIZES</b></h4><pre>
       Sometimes  it's more useful to limit resizes to an acceptable range, than to fix the size to a particular
       value or disallow resizing altogether.  Similar to the way the <b>wm</b> command lets you specify a <b>minsize</b>  and
       <b>maxsize</b>  for a toplevel window, you can bound the sizes the container, a widget, row, or column may take.
       The <b>-width</b>, <b>-height</b>, <b>-reqwidth</b>, and <b>-reqheight</b> options, take a list of one, two, or three values.  We can
       take a previous example and instead preventing resizing, bound the size of  the  scrollbars  between  two
       values.

              table . \
                  .title   0,0 -cspan 3 \
                  .canvas  1,1 -fill both \
                  .vscroll 1,2 -fill y \
                  .hscroll 2,1 -fill x

              # Bound the scrollbars between 1/8 and 1/2 inch
              table configure . c2 -width { 0.125 0.5 }
              table configure . r2 -height { 0.125 0.5 }
              table configure . vscroll .hscroll -fill both

       The  scrollbars  will get no smaller than 1/8 of an inch, or bigger than 1/2 inch.  The initial size will
       be their requested size, so long as it is within the specified bounds.

       How the elements of the list are interpreted is dependent upon the number of elements in the list.

              {}        Empty list. No bounds are set. The default sizing is performed.

              { <u>x</u> }     Fixes the size to <u>x</u>.  The window or partition cannot grow or shrink.

              { <u>min</u> <u>max</u> }
                        Sets up minimum and maximum limits for the size of the window or partition.  The  window
                        or partition can be reduced less than <u>min</u>, nor can it be stretched beyond <u>max</u>.

              { <u>min</u> <u>max</u> <u>nom</u> }
                        Specifies  minimum and maximum size limits, but also specifies a nominal size <u>nom</u>.  This
                        overrides the calculated size of the window or partition.

</pre><h4><b>MISCELLANEOUS</b></h4><pre>
       Another feature is that you can put two widgets in the same cell of the table.  This is useful  when  you
       want to add decorations around a widget.

              frame .frame -bd 1 -relief sunken
              button .quit -text "Quit"

              # Put both the frame and the button in the same cell.
              table . \
                  .quit  1,0 -padx 2 -pady 2 \
                  .frame 1,0 -fill both

</pre><h4><b>LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       A long standing bug in Tk (circa 1993), there is no way to detect if a window is already a container of a
       different  geometry  manager.  This  is  usually  done by accident, such as the following where all three
       widgets are arranged in the same container ".", but using different geometry managers.

                  table .f1
                ...
                  pack .f2
                ...
                  grid .f3

       This leads to bizarre window resizing, as each geometry manager applies its own brand of layout policies.
       When the container is a top level window (such as "."), your window  manager  may  become  locked  as  it
       responds to the never-ending stream of resize requests.
