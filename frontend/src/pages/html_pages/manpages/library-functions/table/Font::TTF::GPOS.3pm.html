       Font::TTF::GPOS - Support for Opentype GPOS tables in conjunction with TTOpen

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The GPOS table is one of the most complicated tables in the TTF spec and the corresponding data structure
       abstraction is also not trivial. While much of the structure of a GPOS is shared with a GSUB table via
       the Font::TTF::Ttopen

</pre><h4><b>INSTANCE</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       Here we describe the additions and lookup specific information for GPOS tables.  Unfortunately there is
       no one abstraction which seems to work comfortable for all GPOS tables, so we will also examine how the
       variables are used for different lookup types.

       The following are the values allowed in the ACTION_TYPE and MATCH_TYPE variables:

       ACTION_TYPE
           This can take any of the following values

           a       The ACTION is an array of anchor tables

           o       Offset.  There  is  no  RULE array. The ADJUST variable contains a value record (see later in
                   this description)

           v       The ACTION is a value record.

           p       Pair adjustment. The ACTION contains an array of  two  value  records  for  the  matched  two
                   glyphs.

           e       Exit and Entry records. The ACTION contains an array of two anchors corresponding to the exit
                   and entry anchors for the glyph.

           l       Indicates a lookup based contextual rule as per the GSUB table.

       MATCH_TYPE
           This can take any of the following values

           g       A glyph array

           c       An array of class values

           o       An array of coverage tables

       The following variables are added for Attachment Positioning Subtables:

       MATCH
           This  contains  an  array  of  glyphs to match against for all RULES. It is much like having the same
           MATCH string in all RULES. In the cases it is used so far, it only ever contains one element.

       MARKS
           This contains a Mark array consisting of each element being a subarray of two elements:

           CLASS   The class that this mark uses on its base

           ANCHOR  The anchor with which to attach this mark glyph

           The base table for mark to base, ligature or mark  attachment  positioning  is  structured  with  the
           ACTION containing an array of anchors corresponding to each attachment class. For ligatures, there is
           more than one RULE in the RULE array corresponding to each glyph in the coverage table.

       Other variables which are provided for informational purposes are:

       VFMT
           Value format for the adjustment of the glyph matched by the coverage table.

       VFMT2
           Value format used in pair adjustment for the second glyph in the pair

   <b>Value</b> <b>Records</b>
       There  is  a  subtype  used  in GPOS tables called a value record. It is used to adjust the position of a
       glyph from its default position. The value record is variable length with a bitfield at the beginning  to
       indicate which of the following entries are included. The bitfield is not stored since it is recalculated
       at write time.

       XPlacement
           Horizontal adjustment for placement (not affecting other unattached glyphs)

       YPlacement
           Vertical adjustment for placement (not affecting other unattached glyphs)

       XAdvance
           Adjust the advance width glyph (used only in horizontal writing systems)

       YAdvance
           Adjust the vertical advance (used only in vertical writing systems)

       XPlaDevice
           Device table for device specific adjustment of horizontal placement

       YPlaDevice
           Device table for device specific adjustment of vertical placement

       XAdvDevice
           Device table for device specific adjustment of horizontal advance

       YAdDevice
           Device table for device specific adjustment of vertical advance

       XIdPlacement
           Horizontal placement metric id (for Multiple Master fonts - but that is all I know!)

       YIdPlacement
           Vertical placement metric id

       XIdAdvance
           Horizontal advance metric id

       YIdAdvance
           Vertical advance metric id

</pre><h4><b>CORRESPONDANCE</b> <b>TO</b> <b>LAYOUT</b> <b>TYPES</b></h4><pre>
       Here is what is stored in the ACTION_TYPE and MATCH_TYPE for each of the known GPOS subtable types:

                       1.1 1.2 2.1 2.2 3   4   5   6   7.1 7.2 7.3 8.1 8.2 8.3
         ACTION_TYPE    o   v   p   p  e   a   a   a    l   l   l   l   l   l
         MATCH_TYPE             g   c                   g   c   o   g   c   o

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>read_sub</b>
       Reads the subtable into the data structures

   <b>$t-&gt;extension</b>
       Returns the table type number for the extension table

   <b>$t-&gt;out_sub</b>
       Outputs the subtable to the given filehandle

   <b>$t-&gt;read_value($format,</b> <b>$base,</b> <b>$lookup,</b> <b>$fh)</b>
       Reads a value record from the current location in the file, according to the format given.

   <b>$t-&gt;read_delta($offset,</b> <b>$base,</b> <b>$lookup,</b> <b>$fh)</b>
       Reads  a delta (device table) at the given offset if it hasn not already been read.  Store the offset and
       item in the lookup cache ($lookup-&gt;{' CACHE'})

   <b>$t-&gt;read_anchor($offset,</b> <b>$base,</b> <b>$lookup,</b> <b>$fh)</b>
       Reads an Anchor table at the given offset if it has not already been read.

   <b>$t-&gt;fmt_value</b>
       Returns the value format for a given value record

   <b>$t-&gt;out_value</b>
       Returns the output string for the outputting of the value for a given format.  Also  updates  the  offset
       cache for any device tables referenced.
