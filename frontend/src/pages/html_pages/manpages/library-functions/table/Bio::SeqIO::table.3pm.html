</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Bio::SeqIO::table - sequence input/output stream from a delimited table

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         # Do not to use this object directly, use Bio::SeqIO, for example:

         $in = Bio::SeqIO-&gt;new(-file =&gt; $filename, -format =&gt; 'table');

         while ( my $seq = $in-&gt;next_seq() ) {
               # do something with $seq
         }

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This class transforms records in a table-formatted text file into Bio::Seq objects.

       A table-formatted text file of sequence records for the purposes of this module is defined as a text file
       with each row corresponding to a sequence, and the attributes of the sequence being in different columns.
       Columns are delimited by a common delimiter, for instance tab or comma.

       The module permits specifying which columns hold which type of annotation. The semantics of certain
       attributes, if present, are pre-defined, e.g., accession number and sequence. Additional attributes may
       be added to the annotation bundle.

</pre><h4><b>FEEDBACK</b></h4><pre>

       User feedback is an integral part of the evolution of this and other Bioperl modules. Send your comments
       and suggestions preferably to one of the Bioperl mailing lists.  Your participation is much appreciated.

        Title   : new
        Usage   : $stream = Bio::SeqIO-&gt;new(-file =&gt; $filename, -format =&gt; 'table')
        Function: Returns a new seqstream
        Returns : A Bio::SeqIO stream for a table format
        Args    : Named parameters:

        -file              Name of file to read
        -fh                Filehandle to attach to
        -comment           Leading character(s) introducing a comment line
        -header            the number of header lines to skip; the first
                           non-comment header line will be used to obtain
                           column names; column names will be used as the
                           default tags for attaching annotation.
        -delim             The delimiter for columns as a regular expression;
                           consecutive occurrences of the delimiter will
                           not be collapsed.
        -display_id        The one-based index of the column containing
                           the display ID of the sequence
        -accession_number  The one-based index of the column
                           containing the accession number of the sequence
        -seq               The one-based index of the column containing
                           the sequence string of the sequence
        -desc              The one-based index of the column containing
                           the description of the sequence
        -species           The one-based index of the column containing the
                           species for the sequence record; if not a
                           number, will be used as the static species
                           common to all records
        -annotation        If provided and a scalar (but see below), a
                           flag whether or not all additional columns are
                           to be preserved as annotation, the tags used
                           will either be 'colX' if there is no column
                           header and where X is the one-based column
                           index, and otherwise the column headers will be
                           used as tags;

                           If a reference to an array, or a square
                           bracket-enclosed string of comma-delimited
                           values, only those columns (one-based index)
                           will be preserved as annotation, tags as before;

                           If a reference to a hash, or a curly
                           braces-enclosed string of comma-delimited key
                           and value pairs in alternating order, the keys
                           are one-based column indexes to be preserved,
                           and the values are the tags under which the
                           annotation is to be attached; if not provided or
                           supplied as undef, no additional annotation will
                           be preserved.
        -colnames          A reference to an array of column labels, or a
                           string of comma-delimited labels, denoting the
                           columns to be converted into annotation; this is
                           an alternative to -annotation and will be
                           ignored if -annotation is also supplied with a
                           valid value.
        -trim              Flag determining whether or not all values should
                           be trimmed of leading and trailing white space
                           and double quotes

        Additional arguments may be used to e.g. set factories and
        builders involved in the sequence object creation (see the
        POD of Bio::SeqIO).

   <b>next_seq</b>
        Title   : next_seq
        Usage   : $seq = $stream-&gt;next_seq()
        Function: returns the next sequence in the stream
        Returns : Bio::Seq::RichSeq object
        Args    :

   <b>comment_char</b>
        Title   : comment_char
        Usage   : $obj-&gt;comment_char($newval)
        Function: Get/set the leading character(s) designating a line as
                  a comment-line.
        Example :
        Returns : value of comment_char (a scalar)
        Args    : on set, new value (a scalar or undef, optional)

   <b>header</b>
        Title   : header
        Usage   : $obj-&gt;header($newval)
        Function: Get/set the number of header lines to skip before the
                  rows containing actual sequence records.

                  If set to zero or undef, means that there is no header and
                  therefore also no column headers.

        Example :
        Returns : value of header (a scalar)
        Args    : on set, new value (a scalar or undef, optional)

   <b>delimiter</b>
        Title   : delimiter
        Usage   : $obj-&gt;delimiter($newval)
        Function: Get/set the column delimiter. This will in fact be
                  treated as a regular expression. Consecutive occurrences
                  will not be collapsed to a single one.

        Example :
        Returns : value of delimiter (a scalar)
        Args    : on set, new value (a scalar or undef, optional)

   <b>attribute_map</b>
        Title   : attribute_map
        Usage   : $obj-&gt;attribute_map($newval)
        Function: Get/set the map of sequence object initialization
                  attributes (keys) to one-based column index.

                  Attributes will usually need to be prefixed by a dash, just
                  as if they were passed to the new() method of the sequence
                  class.

        Example :
        Returns : value of attribute_map (a reference to a hash)
        Args    : on set, new value (a reference to a hash or undef, optional)

   <b>annotation_map</b>
        Title   : annotation_map
        Usage   : $obj-&gt;annotation_map($newval)
        Function: Get/set the mapping between one-based column indexes
                  (keys) and annotation tags (values).

                  Note that the map returned by this method may change after
                  the first next_seq() call if the file contains a column
                  header and no annotation keys have been predefined in the
                  map, because upon reading the column header line the tag
                  names will be set automatically.

                  Note also that the map may reference columns that are used
                  as well in the sequence attribute map.

        Example :
        Returns : value of annotation_map (a reference to a hash)
        Args    : on set, new value (a reference to a hash or undef, optional)

   <b>keep_annotation</b>
        Title   : keep_annotation
        Usage   : $obj-&gt;keep_annotation($newval)
        Function: Get/set flag whether or not to keep values from
                  additional columns as annotation.

                  Additional columns are all those columns in the input file
                  that aren't referenced in the attribute map.

        Example :
        Returns : value of keep_annotation (a scalar)
        Args    : on set, new value (a scalar or undef, optional)

   <b>annotation_columns</b>
        Title   : annotation_columns
        Usage   : $obj-&gt;annotation_columns($newval)
        Function: Get/set the names (labels) of the columns to be used for
                  annotation.

                  This is an alternative to using annotation_map. In order to
                  have any effect, it must be set before the first call of
                  next_seq(), and obviously there must be a header line (or
                  row) too giving the column labels.

        Example :
        Returns : value of annotation_columns (a reference to an array)
        Args    : on set, new value (a reference to an array of undef, optional)

   <b>trim_values</b>
        Title   : trim_values
        Usage   : $obj-&gt;trim_values($newval)
        Function: Get/set whether or not to trim leading and trailing
                  whitespace off all column values.
        Example :
        Returns : value of trim_values (a scalar)
        Args    : on set, new value (a scalar or undef, optional)

   <b>write_seq</b>
        Title: write_seq
        Usage: write_seq() is not implemented for table format output.

</pre><h4><b>Internal</b> <b>methods</b></h4><pre>
       All methods with a leading underscore are not meant to be part of the 'official' API. They are for use by
       this module only, consider them private unless you are a developer trying to modify this module.

   <b>_attribute_map</b>
        Title   : _attribute_map
        Usage   : $obj-&gt;_attribute_map($newval)
        Function: Get only. Same as attribute_map, but zero-based indexes.

                  Note that any changes made to the returned map will change
                  the map used by this instance. You should know what you are
                  doing if you modify the returned value (or if you call this
                  method in the first place).

        Example :
        Returns : value of _attribute_map (a reference to a hash)
        Args    : none

   <b>_annotation_map</b>
        Title   : _annotation_map
        Usage   : $obj-&gt;_annotation_map($newval)
        Function: Get only. Same as annotation_map, but with zero-based indexes.

                  Note that any changes made to the returned map will change
                  the map used by this instance. You should know what you are
                  doing if you modify the returned value (or if you call this
                  method in the first place).

        Example :
        Returns : value of _annotation_map (a reference to a hash)
        Args    : none

   <b>_header_skipped</b>
        Title   : _header_skipped
        Usage   : $obj-&gt;_header_skipped($newval)
        Function: Get/set the flag whether the header was already
                  read (and skipped) or not.
        Example :
        Returns : value of _header_skipped (a scalar)
        Args    : on set, new value (a scalar or undef, optional)

   <b>_next_record</b>
        Title   : _next_record
        Usage   :
        Function: Navigates the underlying file to the next record.

                  For row-based records in delimited text files, this will
                  skip all empty lines and lines with a leading comment
                  character.

                  This method is here is to serve as a hook for other formats
                  that conceptually also represent tables but aren't
                  formatted as row-based text files.

        Example :
        Returns : TRUE if the navigation was successful and FALSE
                  otherwise. Unsuccessful navigation will usually be treated
                  as an end-of-file condition.
        Args    :

   <b>_parse_header</b>
        Title   : _parse_header
        Usage   :
        Function: Parse the table header and navigate past it.

                  This method is called if the number of header rows has been
                  specified equal to or greater than one, and positioned at
                  the first header line (row). By default the first header
                  line (row) is used for setting column names, but additional
                  lines (rows) may be skipped too. Empty lines and comment
                  lines do not count as header lines (rows).

                  This method will call _next_record() to navigate to the
                  next header line (row), if there is more than one header
                  line (row). Upon return, the file is presumed to be
                  positioned at the first record after the header.

                  This method is here is to serve as a hook for other formats
                  that conceptually also represent tables but aren't
                  formatted as row-based text files.

                  Note however that the only methods used to access file
                  content or navigate the position are _get_row_values() and
                  _next_record(), so it should usually suffice to override
                  those.

        Example :
        Returns : TRUE if navigation past the header was successful and FALSE
                  otherwise. Unsuccessful navigation will usually be treated
                  as an end-of-file condition.
        Args    :

   <b>_get_row_values</b>
        Title   : _get_row_values
        Usage   :
        Function: Get the values for the current line (or row) as an array in
                  the order of columns.

                  This method is here is to serve as a hook for other formats
                  that conceptually also represent tables but aren't
                  formatted as row-based text files.

        Example :
        Returns : An array of column values for the current row.
