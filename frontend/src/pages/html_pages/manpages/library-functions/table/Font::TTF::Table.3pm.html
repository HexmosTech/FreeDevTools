</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Font::TTF::Table - Superclass for tables and used for tables we don't have a class for

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Looks after the purely table aspects of a TTF table, such as whether the table has been read before,
       locating the file pointer, etc. Also copies tables from input to output.

</pre><h4><b>INSTANCE</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       Instance variables start with a space

       read
           Flag which indicates that the table has already been read from file.

       dat Allows the creation of unspecific tables. Data is simply output to any font file being created.

       nocompress
           If set, overrides the font default for WOFF table compression. Is a scalar integer specifying a table
           size  threshold  below  which  this  table  will not be compressed. Set to -1 to never compress; 0 to
           always compress.

       INFILE
           The read file handle

       OFFSET
           Location of the file in the input file

       LENGTH
           Length in the input directory

       ZLENGTH
           Compressed length of the table if a WOFF font. 0 &lt; ZLENGTH &lt; LENGTH implies table is compressed.

       CSUM
           Checksum read from the input file's directory

       PARENT
           The Font::TTF::Font that table is part of

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Font::TTF::Table-&gt;new(%parms)</b>
       Creates a new table or subclass. Table instance variables are passed in at this point as  an  associative
       array.

   <b>$t-&gt;read</b>
       Reads  the  table  from  the  input file. Acts as a superclass to all true tables.  This method marks the
       table as read and then just sets the input file pointer but does not read any  data.  If  the  table  has
       already been read, then returns "undef" else returns $self

       For  WOFF-compressed tables, the table is first decompressed and a replacement file handle is created for
       reading the decompressed data. In this case ORIGINALOFFSET will preserve the original value of OFFSET for
       applications that care.

   <b>$t-&gt;read_dat</b>
       Reads the table into the "dat" instance variable for those tables which don't know any better

   <b>$t-&gt;out($fh)</b>
       Writes out the table to the font file. If there is anything in the "dat" instance variable then  this  is
       output, otherwise the data is copied from the input file to the output

   <b>$t-&gt;out_xml($context)</b>
       Outputs  this  table in XML format. The table is first read (if not already read) and then if there is no
       subclass, then the data is dumped as hex data

   <b>$t-&gt;XML_element</b>
       Output a particular element based on its contents.

   <b>$t-&gt;XML_end($context,</b> <b>$tag,</b> <b>%attrs)</b>
       Handles the default type of &lt;data&gt; for those tables which aren't subclassed

   <b>$t-&gt;minsize()</b>
       Returns the minimum size this table can be. If it is smaller than this, then the table must  be  bad  and
       should be deleted or whatever.

   <b>$t-&gt;dirty($val)</b>
       This sets the dirty flag to the given value or 1 if no given value. It returns the value of the flag

   <b>$t-&gt;update</b>
       Each  table  knows  how to update itself. This consists of doing whatever work is required to ensure that
       the memory version of the table is consistent and that other parameters in other tables have been updated
       accordingly.  I.e. by the end of sending "update" to all the tables,  the  memory  version  of  the  font
       should be entirely consistent.

       Some  tables  which  do  no  work indicate to themselves the need to update themselves by setting isDirty
       above 1. This method resets that accordingly.

   <b>$t-&gt;empty</b>
       Clears a table of all data to the level of not having been read

   <b>$t-&gt;release</b>
       Releases ALL of the memory used by this table, and all of its component/child objects.   This  method  is
       called automatically by 'Font::TTF::Font-&gt;release' (so you don't have to call it yourself).

       <b>NOTE</b>,  that  it is important that this method get called at some point prior to the actual destruction of
       the object.  Internally, we track things in a structure that  can  result  in  circular  references,  and
       without  calling '"release()"' these will not properly get cleaned up by Perl.  Once this method has been
       called, though, don't expect to be able to do anything with the "Font::TTF::Table" object; it'll have  <b>no</b>
       internal state whatsoever.

       <b>Developer</b>  <b>note:</b>   As part of the brute-force cleanup done here, this method will throw a warning message
       whenever unexpected key values are found within the "Font::TTF::Table" object.   This  is  done  to  help
       ensure  that  any  unexpected  and unfreed values are brought to your attention so that you can bug us to
       keep the module updated properly; otherwise the potential for  memory  leaks  due  to  dangling  circular
       references will exist.
