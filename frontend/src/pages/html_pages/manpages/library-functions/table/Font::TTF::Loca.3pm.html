</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Font::TTF::Loca - the Locations table, which is intimately tied to the glyf table

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The location table holds the directory of locations of each glyph within the glyf table. Due to this
       relationship and the unimportance of the actual locations when it comes to holding glyphs in memory,
       reading the location table results in the creation of glyph objects for each glyph and stores them here.
       So if you are looking for glyphs, do not look in the "glyf" table, look here instead.

       Things get complicated if you try to change the glyph list within the one table.  The recommendation is
       to create another clean location object to replace this table in the font, ensuring that the old table is
       read first and to transfer or copy glyphs across from the read table to the new table.

</pre><h4><b>INSTANCE</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       The instance variables do not start with a space

       glyphs
           An array of glyph objects for each glyph.

       glyphtype
           A  string  containing  the  class  name  to  create  for  each  new  glyph.  If  empty,  defaults  to
           Font::TTF::Glyph.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>$t-&gt;new</b>
       Creates a new location table making sure it has a glyphs array

   <b>$t-&gt;read</b>
       Reads the location table creating glyph objects (Font::TTF::Glyph) for each glyph  allowing  their  later
       reading.

   <b>$t-&gt;out($fh)</b>
       Writes  the  location  table  out to $fh. Notice that not having read the location table implies that the
       glyf table has not been read either, so the numbers in the location table are  still  valid.  Let's  hope
       that "maxp/numGlyphs" and "head/indexToLocFmt" haven't changed otherwise we are in big trouble.

       The  function  uses  the  OUTLOC location in the glyph calculated when the glyf table was attempted to be
       output.

   <b>$t-&gt;out_xml($context,</b> <b>$depth)</b>
       No need to output a loca table, this is dynamically generated

   <b>$t-&gt;glyphs_do(&amp;func)</b>
       Calls func for each glyph in this location table in numerical order:

           &amp;func($glyph, $glyph_num)
