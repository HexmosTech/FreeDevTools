       PDF::Table - A utility class for building table layouts in a PDF::Builder (or PDF::API2) object.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       Rather than cluttering up the following documentation with <b>(or</b> <b>PDF::API2)</b> additions, wherever it refers
       to "PDF::Builder", understand that you can substitute "PDF::API2" to use that product instead <u>EXCEPT</u>
       <u>where</u> <u>noted</u>.

        use PDF::Builder;
        use PDF::Table;

        my $pdftable = new PDF::Table;
        my $pdf = new PDF::Builder(-file =&gt; "table_of_lorem.pdf");
        my $page = $pdf-&gt;page();

        # some data to lay out
        my $some_data =[
           ["1 Lorem ipsum dolor",
           "Donec odio neque, faucibus vel",
           "consequat quis, tincidunt vel, felis."],
           ["Nulla euismod sem eget neque.",
           "Donec odio neque",
           "Sed eu velit."],
           # ... and so on
        ];

        $left_edge_of_table = 50;
        # build the table layout
        # note: ignoring return values array
        $pdftable-&gt;table(
            # required parameters
            $pdf,
            $page,
            $some_data,
            'x' =&gt; $left_edge_of_table,
            'w' =&gt; 495,
            'y' =&gt; 500,
            'h' =&gt; 300,
            # some optional parameters
            'next_y'          =&gt; 750,
            'next_h'          =&gt; 500,
            'padding'         =&gt; 5,

            'bg_color_odd'    =&gt; "gray",
            'bg_color_even'   =&gt; "lightblue", # cell bg color for even rows
            'max_word_length' =&gt; 50, # 50 between forced splits
         );

        # do other stuff with $pdf
        $pdf-&gt;save();
       ...

   <b>EXAMPLE</b>
       For a complete working example or initial script look into distribution's 'examples' folder.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This class is a utility for use with the PDF::Builder (or PDF::API2, see note above) module from CPAN.
       It can be used to display text data in a table layout within a PDF.  The text data must be in a 2D array
       (such as returned by a DBI statement handle fetchall_arrayref() call).  PDF::Table will automatically add
       as many new pages as necessary to display all of the data.  Various layout properties, such as font, font
       size, cell padding, and background color can be specified for each column and/or for even/odd rows.  Also
       a (non)repeated header row with different layout properties can be specified.

       See the "METHODS" section for complete documentation of every parameter.

</pre><h4><b>COMPATIBILITY</b></h4><pre>
       Starting with version 1.000, several behaviors have changed (for the better, I believe). Nevertheless,
       there may be some users who prefer the old behaviors.  To keep everybody happy, it is possible to easily
       revert to the old behaviors.  Near the top of Table.pm, look for a section labeled "COMPATIBILITY WITH
       OLDER VERSIONS". You can change settings here to match old behaviors:

       repeating headers
           The  old  default for the "repeat" setting for a header was '0' (do not repeat after a table has been
           split across a page). I believe that most users will want to automatically repeat a header row at the
           start of each table fragment, but you can change this behavior if you  wish.  Change  $repeat_default
           from  1  to  0  to  get  the old behavior (or, explicitly give "repeat =&gt; 0" in the header properties
           settings).

       which rows are 'odd' (and which are 'even')
           PDF::Table  decided  which  rows  were  odd/even  (background  and  foreground  colors,  etc)  in  an
           inconsistent  manner,  especially if a header was used (whether repeated or not). Now, the first data
           row (excluding headers) is "odd", and all rows after that alternate "even", "odd", etc., even  across
           page  breaks.  If you want the old behavior, it can be requested. Change $oddeven_default from 1 to 0
           to get the old behavior.

       default cell padding
           The old default  for  padding  around  the  contents  of  a  cell  was  0.  It  is  now  2pt.  Change
           $padding_default from 2 to 0 to get the old behavior.

       behavior of borders
           The  old behavior was calling both the frame around the table <u>and</u> the cell-divider rules as "border",
           and using the same settings for both. This has  been  changed  to  separate  the  two  classes,  with
           "border" referring to the outside framework, and "rules" referring to the dividers. Note that "rules"
           still  inherit  from  "border", so an explicit definition of "rules =&gt; 0" (to hide interior rules) or
           another width (line weight) may still be  needed  to  override  the  "border"  setting  for  interior
           dividers.

   <b>Maintaining</b> <b>compatibility</b>
       Near  the  top of file Table.pm, look for "my $compat_mode = 0;".  PDF::Table is shipped with a flag of 0
       to use the new features of the library. If you have a pressing need to maintain compatibility with  older
       versions  of  the  library,  you may change the value to 1.  Note that a flag of 1 will break some of the
       t-tests, because of different padding defaults resulting in different text locations on the page.

   <b>Run-time</b> <b>changes</b>
       If you do not wish to change the PDF::Table code section to permanently change  old-versus-new  behavior,
       you can use the <u>compatibility</u> flag in the settings to temporarily change the variables listed above.

           compatibility =&gt; [ 0, 0, 0 ]

       will restore all behaviors to the old style, while

           compatibility =&gt; [ 1, 0, 2 ]

       will change only the designation of "odd/even" rows (element 1) to the old behavior, while leaving header
       repeat (element 0) and default padding (element 2) in the new behavior.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>new()</b>
           my $pdf_table = new PDF::Table;
              or
           my $pdf_table = PDF::Table-&gt;new();

       Description
           Creates a new instance of the class.

       Parameters
           There  are  no  required parameters. You may pass $pdf, $page, $data, and %options; or can defer this
           until the <b>table()</b> method invocation (the usual technique).

       Returns
           Reference to the new instance

   <b>table()</b>
       Generate output:

           my ($final_page, $number_of_pages, $final_y) = table($pdf, $page, $data, %settings)

       or, just report row sizes:

           my @v_sizes = table($pdf, $page, $data, %settings, 'ink' =&gt; 0)

       Description
           Generates a multi-row, multi-column table into an existing PDF document, based on provided  data  set
           and settings.

       Parameters
               $pdf      - a PDF::Builder instance representing the document being created
               $page     - a PDF::Builder::Page instance representing the current page of
                           the document
               $data     - an ARRAY reference to a 2D data structure that will be used
                           to build the table
               %settings - HASH with geometry and formatting parameters

           <b>$data</b>  is  normally an m x n matrix of strings, each string containing the content text of that cell,
           and arranged with each row being an anonymous array of strings. For example, a table of 3 rows  of  4
           columns would be

               $data = [
                 [ 'c1', 'c2', 'c3', 'c4' ],  # row 1
                 [ 'c1', 'c2', 'c3', 'c4' ],  # row 2
                 [ 'c1', 'c2', 'c3', 'c4' ],  # row 3
                       ];

           <b>For</b> <b>PDF::Builder</b> <b>ONLY:</b>

           If you wish to enable <u>markup</u> (Markdown or HTML) for a cell, $data has the same structure, except that
           a  cell  with  markup  is  itself  an  anonymous array of three items: a string describing the markup
           ('none', 'md1', 'html', or 'pre'), a string or anonymous array of strings representing the  text  and
           markup  for  the  cell,  and  an  anonymous  hash  of  settings  pertaining to the column() call. See
           PDF::Builder's POD for Content::Text for details.

           Instead of plain text cell 'This is plain text', you can do something like:

               [ 'html',
                 '&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="green"&gt;This is green text.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;',
                 { 'font-family'=&gt;'Serif', 'font-size'=&gt;15, 'para'=&gt;[0,0] } ]

           Remember, this works only with PDF::Builder, and <u>not</u> with PDF::API2.  See the "Column.pl" example  on
           PDF::Builder  for  some  examples.  Automatic cell sizing will not work with this, so you need to use
           the "size" table parameter to specify relative cell widths.

           <b>End</b> <b>of</b> <b>PDF::Builder</b> <b>ONLY:</b>

           For full %settings description see section "Table settings" below.

           This method will add more pages to the PDF instance as required, based on the formatting options  and
           the amount of data.

       Returns
           If actually creating PDF output, the return value is a 3 item list where

               $final_page - A PDF::Builder::Page instance that the table ends on
               $number_of_pages - The count of pages that the table spans
               $final_y - The Y coordinate of the table bottom, so that additional
                          content can be added on the same page ($final_page)

           If just requesting the table size ("'ink' =&gt; 0"), the return value is an "N+3" item list where

               item [0] is the overall table length (height) in points
               item [1] is the header height in points (0 if no header used)
               item [2] is the footer height in points (currently 0)
               item [3] is the height of data row 1
               item [4] is the height of data row 2
                ...
               item [N+3] is the height of data row N

           See  "examples/vsizes.pl" for some examples of determining sizes of a table and its rows. This may be
           useful information for you in deciding whether there is space on <u>this</u> page to fit the complete table,
           or if you should go to the top of the next page. It could be used to figure  how  to  set  <u>h</u>  to  fit
           complete  rows  on  a page (not splitting rows), or even how to re-order the rows to most efficiently
           display them (on the fewest number of pages) without splitting any row.

           Two things to note:

           1. The table data must be refreshed before calling the table method a second time (to actually output
           PDF, with ink = 1).

           2. If the table spills over onto a new page when outputting the PDF (ink  =  1),  you  will  need  to
           retrieve  the new $page hash via the return code. Actually, you would need to do this even if you are
           not querying table sizes!

       Example
               my $pdf  = new PDF::Builder;
               my $page = $pdf-&gt;page();
               my $data = [
                   ['foo1','bar1','baz1'],
                   ['foo2','bar2','baz2']
               ];
               my %settings = (
                   'x' =&gt; 10,
                   'w' =&gt; 570,
                   'y' =&gt; 220,
                   'h' =&gt; 180,
               );

               my ($final_page, $number_of_pages, $final_y) =
                   $pdftable-&gt;table( $pdf, $page, $data, %options );

       <u>Table</u> <u>settings</u>

       Unless otherwise specified, all dimensional and geometry units used are measured in <u>points</u>.  Line  counts
       are not used anywhere.

       "Even"  rows  start with the first data (non-header) row. Think of this first row as number zero (an <u>even</u>
       number). Even rows alternate with odd rows.  The odd/even flag is <b>not</b> reset when a table is split  across
       pages.  If  a  table fragment ends on an odd row, the next fragment (on the next page), starting the next
       row, will start with an even row. If a <u>row</u> is split across pages, it will resume with the  same  odd/even
       setting  as  on  the  previous  page.  If  you  desire  to have the old (previous) odd/even behavior, see
       "COMPATIBILITY".

       The name (key) of any table setting hash element may be given with or without a leading dash (hyphen).  A
       leading  dash  is  allowed  for compatibility with older versions of PDF::Table, but is <b>DEPRECATED!</b> It is
       recommended that the dash be omitted in new code, and removed from old code before November 2022.

       <b>Note:</b> if you use a deprecated setting name, or a setting beginning with a  hyphen  '-',  PDF::Table  will
       update  the  settings  list  with  the  preferred  name.   It  does  this by inserting the item using the
       preferred, non-hyphen name, and then deletes the deprecated one. Due to peculiarities  in  the  way  Perl
       copies  arrays,  hashes,  and  references;  it is possible that your input settings hash may end up being
       modified! This normally will not be a cause for concern, but you should be aware of this behavior in case
       you wish to reuse all or part of a PDF::Table settings list (hash) for other purposes (or another  table)
       -- it may have been slightly modified.

       Note  that  any "Color specifier" is not limited to a name (e.g., 'black') or a 6-digit hex specification
       (e.g., '#3366CC'). See the PDF::Builder writeup on specifying colors for  CMYK,  L*a*b,  HSV,  and  other
       methods.

       Mandatory global settings

       There  are  some  mandatory  parameters for setting table geometry and position on the first (initial) or
       only page of the table. It is up to you to tell PDF::Table where to start (upper left corner) the  table,
       and its width and maximum height on this page.

       <b>x</b> - X coordinate of upper left corner of the table.
           The  left  edge  of the sheet (media) is 0.  <b>Note</b> that this "X" will be used for any spillover of the
           table to additional page(s), so you cannot have spillover (continuation) rows starting at a different
           "X".

           <b>Value:</b> can be any number satisfying "0 ≤ X &lt; PageWidth"

           <b>Default:</b> No default value

               'x' =&gt; 10,

       <b>y</b> - Y coordinate of upper left corner of the table on the initial page.
           <b>Value:</b> can be any number satisfying "0 &lt; y  &lt;  PageHeight"  (depending  on  space  availability  when
           embedding a table)

           <b>Default:</b> No default value

               'y' =&gt; 327,

           <b>Deprecated</b> <b>name:</b> <u>start_y</u> (will go away in the future!)

       <b>w</b> - width of the table starting from "x".
           <b>Note</b>  that  this  "width"  will  be used for any spillover of the table to additional page(s), so you
           cannot have spillover (continuation) rows with a different "width".

           <b>Value:</b> can be any number satisfying "0 &lt; w &lt; PageWidth - x"

           <b>Default:</b> No default value

               'w'  =&gt; 570,

           <b>NOTE:</b> If PDF::Table finds that the table width needs to be increased  to  accommodate  the  requested
           text  and  formatting,  it  will  output  a  warning.  This could lead to undesired results. Possible
           solutions to keep the table from being widened include:

               1) Increase table width (w)
               2) Decrease font size (font_size)
               3) Choose a narrower font
               4) Decrease "max_word_length" parameter, so long words are split into
                   shorter chunks
               5) Rotate media to landscape (if it is portrait)
               6) Use a larger (wider) media size

       <b>h</b> - Height of the table on the initial (current) page.
           Think of this as the <u>maximum</u> <u>height</u> (Y dimension) of the start of the table on this page. This  would
           be the current "Y" location less any bottom margin. Normally you would let as much as possible fit on
           the  page,  but it's possible that you might want to split the table at an earlier point, to put more
           on the next (spill) page.

           <b>Value:</b> can be any number satisfying "0 &lt; h &lt; PageHeight - Current Y position"

           <b>Default:</b> No default value

               'h' =&gt; 250,

           <b>Deprecated</b> <b>name:</b> <u>start_h</u> (will go away in the future!)

       Optional settings

       These are settings which are not absolutely necessary, although their use  may  result  in  a  much  more
       pleasing  appearance  for  the  table.  They all have a "reasonable" default (or inheritance from another
       setting).

       Optional Global Settings

       These settings apply only to the entire table, and cannot  be  used  to  specify  cell,  column,  or  row
       properties. A global setting may only occur once.

       <b>next_h</b> - Height of the table on any additional page.
           Think of this as the <u>maximum</u> <u>height</u> (Y dimension) of any overflow (spill) table portions on following
           pages.   <u>It</u> <u>is</u> <u>highly</u> <u>recommended</u> <u>that</u> <u>you</u> <u>explicitly</u> <u>specify</u> <u>this</u> <u>setting</u> <u>as</u> <u>the</u> <u>full</u> <u>(body</u> <u>content)</u>
           <u>height</u> <u>of</u> <u>a</u> <u>page,</u> <u>rather</u> <u>than</u> <u>having</u> <u>PDF::Table</u> <u>try</u> <u>to</u> <u>figure</u> <u>out</u> <u>a</u> <u>good</u> <u>value</u> <u>and</u> <u><b>give</b></u> <u><b>a</b></u> <u><b>warning</b>.</u>

           <b>Value:</b> can be any number satisfying "0 &lt; next_h &lt; PageHeight - y"

           You need to leave a non-negative amount of space at the bottom of the page.

           <b>Default:</b> Media height * 80% (80% of the paper height) You will  receive  a  warning  if  "next_h"  is
           needed for a spill page and you did not provide it!

               'next_h'  =&gt; 700,

       <b>next_y</b> - Y coordinate of upper left corner of the table at any additional page.
           Think  of this as the starting "Y" position of any overflow (spill or continuation) table portions on
           following pages.  <u>It</u> <u>is</u> <u>highly</u> <u>recommended</u> <u>that</u> <u>you</u> <u>explicitly</u> <u>specify</u> <u>this</u> <u>setting</u> <u>to</u> <u>be</u> <u>at</u> <u>the</u>  <u>top</u>
           <u>of</u>  <u>the</u> <u>body</u> <u>content</u> <u>of</u> <u>a</u> <u>page,</u> <u>rather</u> <u>than</u> <u>having</u> <u>PDF::Table</u> <u>try</u> <u>to</u> <u>figure</u> <u>out</u> <u>a</u> <u>good</u> <u>value</u> <u>and</u> <u><b>give</b></u>
           <u><b>a</b></u> <u><b>warning</b>.</u>

           <b>Value:</b> can be any number satisfying "0 &lt; next_y &lt; PageHeight"

           <b>Default:</b> Media height * 90% (10% down from the top of the  paper)  You  will  receive  a  warning  if
           "next_y" is needed for a spill page and you did not provide it!

       <b>ink</b> - Whether to actually write the table, or to measure the table size
           You  may  want  to know how high (tall) the actual table will be, before making a decision whether to
           start the table on <u>this</u> page, or another (typically, the top of the <u>next</u> page).  You  might  want  to
           know  if  there  is  space  for two or more small tables on this page, or where best to split a table
           (give an "h" value to avoid splitting a row). You may also decide to rearrange  data  rows,  if  this
           will make better use of available space.

           The  default  <u>ink</u>  value  is <u>1</u> (to output to the PDF file). If set to <u>0</u>, only the height measurements
           (total, header, footer, each data row), in points, will be returned.

           <b>Notes:</b>

           1. No "footer" can currently be defined. Space is reserved in the output list for a  possible  future
           implementation.

           2.  No  matter  if  the  header  is  repeated on each page, only one instance will be returned in the
           heights list. Think of the table as fitting on a single page, no matter how  long  it  is,  so  don't
           forget to add in the (repeated) header height for each expected page of output!

           3. If you have exceptionally heavy (thick) top and bottom border lines, you might want to add in some
           extra height (half the thickness of each) to the overall height of the table, to account for this.

           <b>Value:</b> 0 (return height only) or 1 (actually write the table)

           <b>Default:</b> 1 (write out the table)

               'ink'  =&gt; 0,

           <b>Caution:</b>  Currently,  "ink"  is  ignored  for  cells  with  <u>markup</u>; their content will be written out
           regardless of "ink". We <u>do</u> plan to support "ink" for markup cells in the not-too-distant future.

       <b>size</b> - Specified column widths.
           The default behavior of PDF::Table is to calculate the width needed for each  column,  based  on  the
           longest  word,  content  size,  and optional minimum and maximum settings. As an alternative, you may
           give a string specifying the widths of all columns, one entry per column. An entry  may  be  a  fixed
           width  (number  and  unit),  or a relative width to be allocated from remaining space after the fixed
           width columns are removed from the table width.

           If no unit is given, 'pt' (big points, 1/72 inch) are assumed. If no number is given, '1' is  assumed
           (not recommended, except for '*'). The following units are supported:

           <b>pt</b> - points (1/72 inch)
           <b>in</b> - inches (72 points)
           <b>cm</b> - centimeters (28.3 points)
           <b>mm</b> - millimeters (2.83 points)
           <b>em</b> - ems (width of 'M', depends on table default font)
           <b>ex</b> - exs (width of 'x', depends on table default font)

           These  are  all  absolute (fixed) sizes. If using font-dependent units (ems and exs), be aware of the
           overall font and font-size in use by PDF::Table (default is normally 12pt Times-Roman).

           There are also relative or allocatable sizes, specified with the  unit  '*'.   After  all  fixed-size
           columns  have  been  processed,  whatever table width that is left over will be distributed among the
           remaining (relative) columns proportional to the number for each column  (e.g.,  <b>2*</b>  gets  twice  the
           width that <b>*</b> gets).

           <b>Value:</b> a string containing one entry per column

           Each  entry  is  separated by one or more whitespaces (e.g., blanks). Numbers are unsigned (positive)
           and may be integers or real numbers (with decimal point). The unit  follows  immediately  (no  spaces
           between number and unit).  Note that any column <u>minimum</u> or <u>maximum</u> width settings will be ignored!

           <b>Default:</b> None. If not given, widths will be calculated for the columns.

       <b>border_w</b> - Width of table border lines.
       <b>h_border_w</b> - Width of horizontal border lines (top and bottom of the table). Overrides 'border_w' value
       for horizontal usage. Note that if the table spills over onto following pages, only the very first top
       and very last bottom table border will be full width. Dividers on row boundaries will be 1pt wide
       ($border_w_default) solid lines, and where a row is divided within its content, a dashed (pattern
       $dashed_rule_default) 1pt wide line is used.
       <b>v_border_w</b> -  Width of vertical border lines. Overrides 'border_w' value for vertical usage.
           <b>Value:</b>  can  be  any  positive  number. When set to 0, it will disable border lines. This is the line
           thickness for drawing a border.

           <b>Default:</b> 1  ($border_w_default)

           The <u>border</u> is the <b>outside</b> frame around the table. It does  not  enter  into  table  height  or  width
           calculations, so be sure to set your "x" and "w" settings to allow for the width of vertical borders,
           and your "y" or "next_y" and "h" or "next_h" settings to allow for the width (thickness or height) of
           the  horizontal  borders,  especially  if  you  make them more than a Point or two in thickness (line
           width).

               'border_w'     =&gt; 3,     # border width is 3

                                        # fall back to 'border_w'

           Note that both borders and rules overlay the exact boundary between two cells (i.e., the centerline).
           That is, one half of a rule or border will overlay the adjoining cells. Rules do not expand the  size
           of  the  table,  although borders will (by a total of their thickness/width). If you set particularly
           thick (wide) rules, pay attention to adding some padding on the appropriate side(s), so that valuable
           content is not overlaid. For cells along the outer border, one  half  the  width  of  a  border  will
           overlay the cell, so account for this in the padding specification.

           <b>Deprecated</b>   <b>names:</b>   <u>border</u>   (now   'border_w'),   <u>horizontal_borders</u>   (now   'h_border_w'),   and
           <u>vertical_borders</u> (now 'v_border_w'); will go away in the future!

       <b>border_c</b> -  Border color for all borders.
           <b>Value:</b> Color specifier as 'name' or '#rrggbb'

           <b>Default:</b> 'black' ($fg_color_default)

               'border_c' =&gt; 'red',

           <b>Deprecated</b> <b>name:</b> <u>border_color</u> (will go away in the future!)

           The same color is used for both the horizontal and vertical borders.

       Optional Cell, Column, Row, or Global Settings

       These settings can be specified to apply to the entire table, or more narrowly applied to the header  row
       (in  header_props  hash),  one  or  more  rows (in row_props array), one or more columns (in column_props
       array), or one or more individual cells (in cell_props hash).

       If a setting is specified in more than one place, the  order  of  precedence  is  as  follows:  a  header
       property (header row only), followed by a cell property, followed by a column property, followed by a row
       property, followed by a global setting, and finally, any hard-coded default value (if required).

       A  global setting may only occur once (although it may be overridden by cell, column, or row usage of the
       same setting).

       <b>default_text</b> - A string to use if no content (text) is defined for a cell.
           It is also used if a cell has exhausted its given text content, and has been split over a page break.
           This can happen if other cells in the row have much more text content than this cell.  Therefore,  it
           might  be  a  good idea to <u>not</u> use a default such as "no cell content", as this could be confusing to
           readers who have seen content for this cell on the previous page.

           Note that "max_word_length" splitting is <u>not</u> applied to the default text, so be careful  about  using
           long words.

           If  you  want  different  effects  for different rows, columns, or cells, you can override the global
           default setting. If you want <b>(No</b> <b>content)</b> for the first printout of a cell (split over  two  or  more
           pages)  and  <b>-</b>  for  second and later printouts, you could leave the global default as '-' and simply
           give the cell the text "(No content)" (no longer really <u>empty</u>, but you get the  idea).  If  you  have
           some  content  for  a  cell,  and  want  <b>no</b> <b>further</b> <b>entry</b> after it runs out of content, you could set
           "default_text" to <b>no</b> <b>further</b> <b>entry</b>, and so on.

           <b>Value:</b> any string (can be a blank ' ' or an empty string '').

           <b>Default:</b> '-'  ($empty_cell_text)

       <b>max_word_length</b> - Breaks long words
           It may be necessary to break up long words (like serial  numbers,  hashes,  etc.)  to  fit  within  a
           column, by adding a space after every Nth symbol, unless a space (x20) is found already in the text.

           <b>Note</b>  that  this  does <u>not</u> add a hyphen (dash)!  It merely ensures that there will be no runs of non-
           space characters longer than <u>N</u> characters, reducing the chance of forcing an overly wide column.

           <b>Value:</b> can be any positive integer number (character count)

           <b>Default:</b> 20

               'max_word_length' =&gt; 25,    # Will add a space after every 25 symbols
                                           # unless there is a natural break (space)

       <b>padding</b> - Padding applied to every cell
       <b>padding_top</b>    - top cell padding, overrides 'padding'
       <b>padding_right</b>  - right cell padding, overrides 'padding'
       <b>padding_left</b>   - left cell padding, overrides 'padding'
       <b>padding_bottom</b> - bottom padding, overrides 'padding'
           <b>Value:</b> can be any non-negative number (≥ 0)

           <b>Default</b> <b>padding:</b> 2.  ($padding_default)

           See "COMPATIBILITY" for returning to the old value of 0.

           <b>Default</b> <b>padding_*</b> 'padding'

                                          # back to 'padding' value

       <b>font</b> - instance of PDF::Builder::Resource::Font defining the font to be used in the table (or a
       subsection of it).
           <b>Value:</b> can be any PDF::Builder::Resource::* type of font

           <b>Default:</b> 'Times' core font with <u>latin1</u> encoding

               'font' =&gt; $pdf-&gt;corefont("Helvetica", -encoding =&gt; "latin1"),

           <b>CAUTION:</b> Only TrueType and OpenType fonts (ttfont call) can make use of multibyte encodings  such  as
           'utf8'. Errors will result if you attempt to use 'utf8', etc. with corefont, psfont, etc. font types!
           For these, you <u>must</u> only specify a single-byte encoding.

       <b>font_size</b> - Size of the font that will be used in the table (or a subsection of it).
           <b>Value:</b> can be any positive number

           <b>Default:</b> 12  ($font_size_default)

               'font_size' =&gt; 16,

       <b>fg_color</b> - Font color for all text.
       <b>bg_color</b> - Background color for all text.
           <b>Value:</b> Color specifier as 'name' or '#rrggbb' (or other suitable color specification format)

           <b>Default:</b>  'black'  text  on  (transparent) background. In other words, there is no default background
           color. The exception is for any <b>header</b> row, where  the  default  colors  are  "#000066"  (dark  blue,
           $h_fg_color_default) on "#FFFFAA" (light yellow, $h_bg_color_default).

               'fg_color'      =&gt; '#333333',

           <b>Deprecated</b> <b>names:</b> <u>font_color,</u> <u>background_color</u> (both will go away in the future!)

       <b>fg_color_odd</b> - Font color for odd rows (override "fg_color").
       <b>fg_color_even</b> - Font color for even rows (override "fg_color").
       <b>bg_color_odd</b> - Background color for odd rows (override "bg_color").
       <b>bg_color_even</b> - Background color for even rows (override "bg_color").
           <b>Value:</b> Color specifier as 'name' or '#rrggbb' (or other suitable color specification format)

               'fg_color_odd'  =&gt; 'purple',
               'fg_color_even' =&gt; '#00FF00',
               'bg_color_odd'  =&gt; 'gray',
               'bg_color_even' =&gt; 'lightblue',

           <b>Deprecated</b>  <b>names:</b>  <u>font_color_odd,</u> <u>font_color_even,</u> <u>background_color_odd,</u> <u>background_color_even</u> (all
           will go away in the future!)

           Note that *_color_odd/even usually make the most sense as global settings, although it <u>is</u> possible to
           use them within columns (see chess.pl example), and even rows and cells, but not header rows.

       <b>underline</b> - Underline specifications for text in the table.
           <b>Value:</b> 'auto', integer of distance (below baseline), or arrayref of distance &amp; thickness  (more  than
           one  pair  will  provide  multiple underlines).  Negative distance gives strike-through. "[]" ('none'
           also works for PDF::Builder) gives no underline.

           Note that it is unwise to underline all content in the  table!  It  should  be  used  selectively  to
           <u>emphasize</u> important text, such as header content, or certain cells. Unfortunately, there is currently
           no way to turn underlining off and on <u>within</u> a cell.

           <b>Default:</b> none

           <b>Deprecated</b> <b>name:</b> <u>font_underline</u> (will go away in the future!)

       <b>min_rh</b> - Desired minimum row height.
           This setting will be honored only if "min_rh &gt; font_size + padding_top + padding_bottom" (i.e., it is
           taller than the calculated minimum value).

           This  setting  doesn't  usually  make  sense  when  used in a column_props or a cell_props, but it <u>is</u>
           possible to do, and may be useful in certain situations.

           <b>Value:</b> can be any positive number

           <b>Default:</b> "font_size + padding_top + padding_bottom"

               'min_rh' =&gt; 24,

           <b>Deprecated</b> <b>name:</b> <u>row_height</u> (will go away in the future!)

       <b>justify</b> - Alignment of text in a cell.
           <b>Value:</b> One of 'left', 'right', 'center'

           <b>Default:</b> 'left'

       <b>min_w</b> - Minimum width of this cell or column.
           PDF::Table will set a cell (and the column it's in) minimum width to  fit  the  longest  word  (after
           splitting  on "max_word_length") found in the text. This amount may be increased to "min_w". A column
           should be no narrower than its widest minimum width, but could be larger in order  to  fill  out  the
           table width.

           <b>Value:</b> can be any number satisfying "0 &lt; min_w &lt; w"

           <b>Default:</b> Auto calculated

           Note  that  "min_w"  is usually used for a column_props to set the column minimum width. If used in a
           row_props, it will act as a <u>global</u> setting; if used in a cell_props,  that  will  force  the  minimum
           width for the cell's column.

       <b>max_w</b> - Maximum width of this column.
           PDF::Table will set a cell (and the column it's in) maximum width to fit the total length of the text
           content.  This  will  seldom  be  actually used, but "max_w" may be used to <u>reduce</u> this maximum. When
           columns are being widened in order to meet the desired table width, it will try to honor the  maximum
           width setting and avoid adding any width to a column already at its maximum width (but this cannot be
           guaranteed).

           <b>Value:</b> can be any number satisfying "0 &lt; min_w ≤ max_w &lt; w"

           <b>Default:</b> Auto calculated

       <b>rule_w</b> - Width of table rule lines (internal table dividers).
       <b>h_rule_w</b> - Width of horizontal rules (bottom of a cell). Overrides 'rule_w' value for horizontal usage.
       <b>v_rule_w</b> -  Width of vertical rules (left side of a cell). Overrides 'rule_w' value for vertical usage.
           <b>Value:</b>  can  be any positive number. When set to 0, it will disable rules. This is the line thickness
           for drawing a rule.

           <b>Default:</b> 1  (corresponding border value)

           A <u>rule</u> is a line bordering a <u>cell</u> in the table. While it does not enter into table  height  or  width
           calculations,  be  sure to set your "padding" settings to allow sufficient clearance of cell content,
           especially if you make the rules more than a Point or two in thickness (line width). Note that a cell
           only defines and draws its left and bottom rules -- the top rule is defined in the cell or row above,
           and the right rule is defined in the cell or column to the right of this one.

               'rule_w'     =&gt; 3,     # rule width is 3
               'h_rule_w'   =&gt; 1,     # horizontal rules will be 1, overriding 3
               'v_rule_w'   =&gt; undef, # vertical rules will be 3, as it will
                                      # fall back to 'rule_w'

           Note that both borders and rules overlay the exact boundary between two cells (i.e., the centerline).
           That is, one half of a rule or border will overlay the adjoining cells. Rules do not expand the  size
           of the table. If you set particularly thick (wide) rules, pay attention to adding some padding on the
           appropriate  side(s),  so  that valuable content is not overlaid. For cells along the outer border, a
           <u>border</u> will be drawn instead of a <u>rule</u>.

           Cell rules inherit thickness and color from the border settings, so if you want  no  internal  rules,
           you need to set

               'rule_w'     =&gt; 0,     # no rules

       <b>rule_c</b> -  Rule color for all rules.
       <b>h_rule_c</b> -  Rule color for horizontal (bottom) rules, overriding "rule_c" for this usage.
       <b>v_rule_c</b> -  Rule color for vertical (left) rules, overriding "rule_c" for this usage.
           <b>Value:</b> Color specifier as 'name' or '#rrggbb'

           <b>Default:</b> 'black' (corresponding border value)

               'rule_c' =&gt; 'red',

       New Page Function Hook

       <b>new_page_func</b> is a CODE reference to a function that returns a PDF::Builder::Page instance.

       If used, the parameter '"new_page_func"' must be a function reference which, when executed, will create a
       new  page  and will return the object to the module.  For example, you can use it to put Page Title, Page
       Frame, Page Numbers and other content that you need.  Also  if  you  need  a  different  paper  size  and
       orientation  than  the  default US-Letter, e.g., B2-Landscape, you can use this function ref to set it up
       for you. For more info about creating pages, refer to PDF::Builder PAGE METHODS  Section.   Don't  forget
       that  your  function must return a page object created with the PDF::Builder <b>page()</b> method. $code_ref can
       be something like "\&amp;new_page".

           'new_page_func'  =&gt; $code_ref,

       The $code_ref may be an inline  sub  definition  (as  show  below),  or  a  regular  named  "sub"  (e.g.,
       '<b>new_page()</b>')  referenced  as  "\&amp;new_page".  The  latter may be cleaner than inlining, if the routine is
       quite long.

       An example of reusing a saved PDF page as a <u>template</u>:

           my $pdf      = PDF::API2-&gt;new();
           my $template = PDF::API2-&gt;open('pdf/template.pdf');
           my $new_page_func = sub { return $pdf-&gt;import_page($template, 1); }

           table(
               ...
               new_page_func =&gt; $new_page_func,
               ...

       This will call a function to grab a copy of a template PDF's page 1 and insert it as the new last page of
       the PDF, as the starting point for the next <u>overflow</u> (continuation) page of the table,  if  needed.  Note
       that  the  "$template-&gt;<a href="../man1/openpage.1.html">openpage</a>(1)"  call  is <b>unsuitable</b> for this purpose, as it does not insert the page
       into the current PDF.

       You can also create a blank page and prefill it with desired content:

           my $pdf      = PDF::API2-&gt;new();
           my $new_page_func = sub {
               my $page = $pdf-&gt;page(); # so far, no difference from default behavior
               $page-&gt;mediaBox(...);  # set page size/orientation, etc.
               my $text = $page-&gt;text();
               # set font, placement, etc.
               $text-&gt;text(...);  # write header, footer, etc.
               ...
               return $page;
           }

           table(
               ...
               new_page_func =&gt; $new_page_func,
               ...

       If "new_page_func" is not defined, PDF::Table will simply call "$pdf-&gt;page()" to generate a  new,  blank,
       "next" page.

       Note  that  this  function  is  <b>not</b> called for the first page of a table. That one uses the current $page
       parameter passed to the table() call. It is only called when needed for overflow ("next_y" and  "next_h")
       pages,  where  it  replaces the $page parameter with a new page framework. You may want to consider using
       the same function to create your other (non-table) pages, assuming you want the same format (PDF content)
       across all pages of the table.

       Cell Render Hook

       <b>cell_render_hook</b> is a CODE reference to a function called with the current cell coordinates. If used, the
       parameter "cell_render_hook" must be a function reference. It is most useful for creating  special  items
       within a text block, such as a URL link inside of a cell.  The following example adds a link in the first
       column of each non-header row:

           'cell_render_hook'  =&gt; sub {
               my ($page, $first_row, $row, $col, $x, $y, $w, $h) = @_;

               # Do nothing except for first column (and not a header row)
               return unless ($col == 0);
               return if ($first_row);

               # Create link
               my $value = $list_of_vals[$row-1];
               my $url = "https://${hostname}<a href="file:/app/">/app/</a>${value}";

               my $annot = $page-&gt;annotation();
               $annot-&gt;url( $url, -rect =&gt; [$x, $y, $x+$w, $y+$h] );
           },

       Header Row Properties

       If  the  'header_props'  parameter  is used, it should be a hashref. Passing an empty HASH will trigger a
       header row initialized with Default values.  There is no 'data' variable for  the  content,  because  the
       module  assumes  that the first table row will become the header row. It will copy this row and put it on
       every new page if the 'repeat' parameter is set.

       <b>repeat</b> - Flag showing if header row should be repeated on every new page.
           <b>Value:</b> 0,1   1-Yes/True, 0-No/False

           <b>Default:</b> 1 ($repeat_default)

           See "COMPATIBILITY" if you wish to change it back to the old behavior of 0.

               my $hdr_props = {
                   'font'       =&gt; $pdf-&gt;corefont("Helvetica", -encoding =&gt; "latin1"),
                   'font_size'  =&gt; 18,
                   'fg_color'   =&gt; '#004444',
                   'bg_color'   =&gt; 'yellow',
                   'repeat'     =&gt; 0,
                   'justify'    =&gt; 'center',
               };

       Row Properties

       If the 'row_props' parameter is used, it should be an arrayref of hashrefs, with one hashref for each row
       of the table. The rows are counted from top to bottom, so the hash reference at $row_props[0]  will  hold
       properties  for the first row (from top to bottom).  If you DO NOT want to give properties for a row, but
       to give for another, just insert an empty hash reference into the array for the  row  that  you  want  to
       skip.  This  will cause the counting to proceed as expected and the properties to be applied at the right
       rows.

       Each hashref can contain any of the keys shown below:

           Example:

               my $row_props = [
                   # This is an empty hash to indicate default properties for first row
                   {},
                   # the next hash will hold the properties for the second row from
                   # top to bottom.
                   {
                       'min_rh'    =&gt; 75,        # Minimum row height of 75
                       'justify'   =&gt; 'right',   # Right text alignment
                       'font'      =&gt; $pdf-&gt;corefont("Helvetica",
                                                     -encoding =&gt; "latin1"),
                       'font_size' =&gt; 10,
                       'fg_color'  =&gt; 'blue',
                       'bg_color'  =&gt; '#FFFF00',
                   },
                   # etc.
               ];

           There are no settings unique to rows. Do be aware of when "row 0" may refer to <u>header</u> row properties!

       Column Properties

       If the 'column_props' parameter is used, it should be an arrayref of hashrefs, with one hashref for  each
       column  of  the table. The columns are counted from left to right, so the hash reference at $col_props[0]
       will hold properties for the first column (from left to right).  If you DO NOT want  to  give  properties
       for  a column, but to give for another, just insert an empty hash reference into the array for the column
       that you want to skip. This will cause the counting to proceed as  expected  and  the  properties  to  be
       applied at the right columns.

       Each hashref can contain any of the keys shown below:

           Example:

               my $col_props = [
                   # This is an empty hash to indicate default properties for first col.
                   {},
                   # the next hash will hold the properties for the second column from
                   # left to right.
                   {
                       'min_w'     =&gt; 100,       # Minimum column width of 100
                       'max_w'     =&gt; 150,       # Maximum column width of 150
                       'justify'   =&gt; 'right',   # Right text alignment
                       'font'      =&gt; $pdf-&gt;corefont("Helvetica",
                                                     -encoding =&gt; "latin1"),
                       'font_size' =&gt; 10,
                       'fg_color'  =&gt; 'blue',
                       'bg_color'  =&gt; '#FFFF00',
                   },
                   # etc.
               ];

           There are no settings unique to columns.

       NOTE:  If 'min_w' and/or 'max_w' parameter is used in 'col_props', keep in mind that it may be overridden
       by the calculated minimum/maximum cell width so that the table can be  created.   When  this  happens,  a
       warning  will be issued with some suggestions on what can be done.  In cases of a conflict between column
       formatting and odd/even row formatting, 'col_props' will override odd/even.

       Cell Properties

       If the 'cell_props' parameter is used, it should be an arrayref with arrays  of  hashrefs  (of  the  same
       dimension as the data array) with one hashref for each cell of the table.

       Each hashref can contain any of the keys shown below:

       <b>colspan</b> - Span this cell over multiple columns to the right.
           <b>Value:</b> can be any positive number less than the number of columns to the right of the current column

           <b>Default:</b> undef

           NOTE:  If  you  want  to  have  regular  columns <b>after</b> a colspan, you have to provide "undef" for the
           columns that should be spanned

           NOTE: If you use "colspan" to span a column, but provide data for it, your table will be mangled: the
           spanned-but-data-provided-column will be rendered!  But, as HTML  works  the  same  way,  we  do  not
           consider this a bug.

           Example:

               # row0 col1 should span 2 cols:
               @data = ( [ 'r1c1', 'r1c2', 'r1c3' ], ['r2c1+',undef,'r2c3'] );
               # note: ignoring return values array
               $tab-&gt;table( $pdf, $page, \@data, %TestData::required,
                 'cell_props' =&gt; [
                     [],
                     [{'colspan' =&gt; 2}]
                 ]
               );

       See the file "examples/colspan.pl" for detailed usage.

       Example:

           my $cell_props = [
               [ # This array is for the first row (0).
                 # If header_props is defined, it will override these settings.
                   {    # Row 0 cell 0
                       'bg_color'  =&gt; '#AAAA00',
                       'fg_color'  =&gt; 'yellow',
                       'underline' =&gt; [ 2, 2 ],
                   },

                   # etc.
               ],
               [ # Row 1 (first data row, if header_props given)
                   {    # Row 1 cell 0
                       'bg_color' =&gt; '#CCCC00',
                       'fg_color' =&gt; 'blue',
                   },
                   {    # Row 1 cell 1
                       'bg_color' =&gt; '#BBBB00',
                       'fg_color' =&gt; 'red',
                   },
                   # etc.
               ],
               [ # Row 2
                   {    # Row 2 cell 0 span cell 1
                       'colspan' =&gt; 2
                   },
                   # etc.
               ],
               # etc.
           ];

           OR

           my $cell_props = [];
           $cell_props-&gt;[1][0] = {
               # Row 2 cell 1
               'bg_color' =&gt; '#CCCC00',
               'fg_color' =&gt; 'blue',
           };

   <b>text_block()</b>
           my ($width_of_last_line, $ypos_of_last_line, $left_over_text) =
               text_block( $txt, $data, %settings)

       Description
           Utility  method  to  create  a  block of text. The block may contain multiple paragraphs (input $data
           separated by implicit or explicit newlines "\n").  It is mainly used internally, but you can  use  it
           from outside for placing formatted text anywhere on the sheet.

           NOTE: This method will NOT add more pages to the PDF instance if the space is not enough to place the
           string  inside the block.  Leftover text will be returned and has to be handled by the caller - i.e.,
           add a new page and a new block with the leftover.

       Parameters
               $txt  - a PDF::Builder::Page::Text instance representing the text tool.
               $data - a string that will be placed inside the block, broken up into
                       lines that fit within the indicated width.
               %settings - HASH with geometry and formatting parameters. Note that
                           several parameters are mandatory.

       Returns
           The return value is a 3 item list where

               $width_of_last_line - Width of last line in the block
               $final_y - The Y coordinate of the block bottom so that additional
                          content can be added after it
               $left_over_text - Text that did not fit in the provided box geometry.

       Example
               # PDF::Builder objects
               my $page = $pdf-&gt;page();
               my $txt  = $page-&gt;text();
