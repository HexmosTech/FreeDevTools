</pre><h4><b>Widget-specific</b> <b>Options</b></h4><pre>
       Switch: <b>-autoclear</b>
       Name: <b>autoClear</b>
       Class: <b>AutoClear</b>
        A  boolean  value  which  specifies  whether  the first keypress in a cell will delete whatever text was
        previously there.  Defaults to 0.

       Switch:  <b>-bordercursor</b>
       Name: <b>borderCursor</b>
       Class: <b>Cursor</b>
        Specifies the name of the cursor to show  when  over  borders,  a  visual  indication  that  interactive
        resizing is allowed (it is thus affect by the value of -resizeborders).  Defaults to <u>crosshair</u>.

       Switch: <b>-borderwidth</b> <b>or</b> <b>-bd</b>
       Name: <b>borderWidth</b>
       Class: <b>BorderWidth</b>
        Specifies a non-negative pixel value or list of values indicating the width of the 3-D border to draw on
        interior  table cells (if such a border is being drawn; the &lt;Brelief&gt; option typically determines this).
        If one value is specified, a rectangle of this width will be drawn.  If two values are  specified,  then
        only  the  left  and  right edges of the cell will have borders.  If four values are specified, then the
        values correspond to the {left right top  bottom}  edges.   This  can  be  overridden  by  the  a  tag's
        borderwidth  option.  It can also be affected by the defined <b>-drawmode</b> for the table.  Each value in the
        list must have one of the forms acceptable to <b>Tk_GetPixels</b>.

       Switch: <b>-browsecommand</b> <b>or</b> <b>-browsecmd</b>
       Name: <b>browseCommand</b>
       Class: <b>BrowseCommand</b>
        Specifies a command (callback) which will be evaluated anytime the active  cell  changes.  The  Previous
        Index and the Current index is passed to this command as arguments.

       Switch: <b>-cache</b>
       Name: <b>cache</b>
       Class: <b>Cache</b>
        A  boolean  value  that  specifies whether an internal cache of the table contents should be kept.  This
        greatly enhances speed performance when used with <b>-command</b> but uses extra memory.   Can  maintain  state
        when  both  <b>-command</b>  and <b>-variable</b> are empty.  The cache is automatically flushed whenever the value of
        <b>-cache</b> or <b>-variable</b> changes, otherwise you have to explicitly call <b>clear</b> on it.  Defaults to off.

       Switch: <b>-colorigin</b>
       Name: <b>colOrigin</b>
       Class: <b>Origin</b>
        Specifies what column index to interpret as the leftmost column in the table. This  value  is  used  for
        user indices in the table.  Defaults to 0.

       Switch: <b>-cols</b>
       Name: <b>cols</b>
       Class: <b>Cols</b>
        Number of cols in the table.  Defaults to 10.

       Switch: <b>-colseparator</b>
       Name: <b>colSeparator</b>
       Class: <b>Separator</b>
        Specifies a separator character that will be interpreted as the column separator when cutting or pasting
        data in a table.  By default, columns are separated as elements of a tcl list.

       Switch: <b>-colstretchmode</b>
       Name: <b>colStretchMode</b>
       Class: <b>StretchMode</b>
        Specifies one of the following stretch modes for columns to fill extra allocated window space:

       <b>none</b>
         Columns  will not stretch to fill the assigned window space.  If the columns are too narrow, there will
         be a blank space at the right of the table.  This is the default.

       <b>unset</b>
         Only columns that do not have a specific width set will be stretched.

       <b>all</b>
         All columns will be stretched by the same number of pixels to fill the window space  allocated  to  the
         table.  This mode can interfere with interactive border resizing which tries to force column width.

       <b>last</b>
         The last column will be stretched to fill the window space allocated to the table.

       <b>fill</b>
         (only valid for <b>-rowstretch</b> currently)

         The  table  will  get  more or less columns according to the window space allocated to the table.  This
         mode has numerous quirks and may disappear in the future.

       Switch: <b>-coltagcommand</b>
       Name: <b>colTagCommand</b>
       Class: <b>TagCommand</b>
        Provides the name of a procedure that will be evaluated by the widget to determine the tag  to  be  used
        for  a given column.  When displaying a cell, the table widget will first check to see if a tag has been
        defined using the <b>tag</b> <b>col</b> widget method.  If no tag is found,  it  will  evaluate  the  named  procedure
        passing  the  column  number  in question as the sole argument.  The procedure is expected to return the
        name of a tag to use, or a null string. Errors occurring during the evaluation of the procedure, or  the
        return of an invalid tag name are silently ignored.

        The Current column number is passed as an argument to the col command.

       Switch: <b>-colwidth</b>
       Name: <b>colWidth</b>
       Class: <b>ColWidth</b>
        Default  column  width,  interpreted  as  characters in the default font when the number is positive, or
        pixels if it is negative.  Defaults to 10.

       Switch: <b>-command</b>
       Name: <b>command</b>
       Class: <b>Command</b>
        Specified a command to use as a procedural interface to  cell  values.  If  <b>-usecommand</b>  is  true,  this
        command  will be used instead of any reference to the <b>-variable</b> array.  When retrieving cell values, the
        return value of the command is used as the value for the cell.

        Args passed to this callback: The Set Flag (=1 if  setting,  else  retrieving),  the  current  row,  the
        current col, the cell value (if setting).

       Switch: <b>-drawmode</b>
       Name: <b>drawMode</b>
       Class: <b>DrawMode</b>
        Sets the table drawing mode to one of the following options:

       <b>slow</b>
         The  table  is  drawn to an offscreen pixmap using the Tk bordering functions (double-buffering).  This
         means there will be no flashing, but this mode is slow for larger tables.

       <b>compatible</b>
         The table is drawn directly to the screen using the Tk border functions. It is faster, but  the  screen
         may flash on update.  This is the default.

       <b>fast</b>
         The  table  is  drawn  directly  to  the screen and the borders are done with fast X calls, so they are
         always one pixel wide only.  As a side effect, it restricts <b>-borderwidth</b> to a range of 0  or  1.   This
         mode  provides best performance for large tables, but can flash on redraw and is not 100% Tk compatible
         on the border mode.

       <b>single</b>
         The table is drawn to the screen as in fast mode, but only single pixel lines  are  drawn  (not  square
         borders).

       Switch: <b>-flashmode</b>
       Name: <b>flashMode</b>
       Class: <b>FlashMode</b>
        A  boolean  value  which  specifies  whether cells should flash when their value changes.  The table tag
        <b>flash</b> will be applied to these cells for the duration specified by <b>-flashtime</b>.  Defaults to 0.

       Switch: <b>-flashtime</b>
       Name: <b>flashTime</b>
       Class: <b>FlashTime</b>
        The amount of time, in 1/4 second increments, for which a cell should flash when its value has  changed.
        <b>-flashmode</b> must be on.  Defaults to 2.

       Switch: <b>-height</b>
       Name: <b>height</b>
       Class: <b>Height</b>
        Specifies  the  desired height for the window, in rows. If zero or less, then the desired height for the
        window is made just large enough to hold all the rows in the table.  The height can be  further  limited
        by <b>-maxheight</b> .

       Switch: <b>-invertselected</b>
       Name: <b>invertSelected</b>
       Class: <b>InvertSelected</b>
        Specifies  whether  the  foreground  and  background  of an item should simply have their values swapped
        instead of merging the <u>sel</u> tag options when the cell is selected.  Defaults to 0 (merge <u>sel</u> tag).

       Switch: <b>-ipadx</b>
       Name: <b>ipadX</b>
       Class: <b>Pad</b>
        A pixel value specifying the internal offset X padding for text in a cell.  This value does not grow the
        size of the cell, it just causes the text to be drawn further from the cell border.  It only affects one
        side (depending on anchor).  Defaults to 0.  See <b>-padx</b> for an alternate padding style.

       Switch: <b>-ipady</b>
       Name: <b>ipadY</b>
       Class: <b>Pad</b>
        A pixel value specifying the internal offset Y padding for text in a cell.  This value does not grow the
        size of the cell, it just causes the text to be drawn further from the cell border.  It only affects one
        side (depending on anchor).  Defaults to 0.  See <b>-pady</b> for an alternate padding style.

       Switch: <b>-justify</b>
       Name: <b>justify</b>
       Class: <b>Justify</b>
        How to justify multi-line text in a cell. It must be one of <b>left</b>, <b>right</b>, or <b>center</b>. Defaults to left.

       Switch: <b>-maxheight</b>
       Name: <b>maxHeight</b>
       Class: <b>MaxHeight</b>
        The max height in pixels that the window will request.  Defaults to 600.

       Switch: <b>-maxwidth</b>
       Name: <b>maxWidth</b>
       Class: <b>MaxWidth</b>
        The max width in pixels that the window will request.  Defaults to 800.

       Switch: <b>-multiline</b>
       Name: <b>multiline</b>
       Class: <b>Multiline</b>
        Specifies the default setting for the multiline tag option.  Defaults to 1.

       Switch: <b>-pady</b>
       Name: <b>padX</b>
       Class: <b>Pad</b>
        A pixel value specifying the offset X padding for a cell.  This value causes the  default  size  of  the
        cell  to increase by two times the value (one for each side), unless a specific pixel size is chosen for
        the cell with the <b>width</b> command.  This will force an empty area on the left and right of each cell edge.
        This padding affects all types of data in the cell.  Defaults to 0.  See <b>-ipadx</b> for an alternate padding
        style.

       Switch: <b>-pady</b>
       Name: <b>padY</b>
       Class: <b>Pad</b>
        A pixel value specifying the offset Y padding for a cell.  This value causes the  default  size  of  the
        cell  to increase by two times the value (one for each side), unless a specific pixel size is chosen for
        the cell with the <b>height</b> command.  This will force an empty area on the top  and  bottom  of  each  cell
        edge.   This padding affects all types of data in the cell.  Defaults to 0.  See <b>-ipadx</b> for an alternate
        padding style.

       Switch: <b>-resizeborders</b>
       Name: <b>resizeBorders</b>
       Class: <b>ResizeBorders</b>
        Specifies what kind of interactive border resizing to allow, must be one of row, col, both (default)  or
        none.

       Switch: <b>-rowheight</b>
       Name: <b>rowHeight</b>
       Class:
        <b>RowHeight</b>   Default row height, interpreted as lines in the default font when the number is positive, or
        pixels if it is negative.  Defaults to 1.

       Switch: <b>-roworigin</b>
       Name: <b>rowOrigin</b>
       Class: <b>Origin</b>
        Specifies what row index to interpret as the topmost row in the table.  This  value  is  used  for  user
        indices in the table.  Defaults to 0.

       Switch: <b>-rows</b>
       Name: <b>rows</b>
       Class: <b>Rows</b>
        Number of rows in the table.  Defaults to 10.

       Switch: <b>-rowseparator</b>
       Name: <b>rowSeparator</b>
       Class: <b>Separator</b>
        Specifies  a  separator  character that will be interpreted as the row separator when cutting or pasting
        data in a table.  By default, rows are separated as tcl lists.

       Switch: <b>-rowstretchmode</b>
       Name: <b>rowStretchMode</b>
       Class: <b>StretchMode</b>
        Specifies the stretch modes for rows to fill extra allocated  window  space.   See  <b>-colstretchmode</b>  for
        valid options.

       Switch: <b>-rowtagcommand</b>
       Name: <b>rowTagCommand</b>
       Class: <b>TagCommand</b>
        Provides  the name of a procedure that can evaluated by the widget to determine the tag to be used for a
        given row.  The procedure must be defined by the user to accept a single argument (the row number),  and
        return  a  tag name or null string.  This operates in a similar manner as <b>-coltagcommand</b>, except that it
        applies to row tags.

        The Current row number is passed as an argument to the row command.

       Switch: <b>-selectioncommand</b> <b>or</b> <b>-selcmd</b>
       Name: <b>selectionCommand</b>
       Class: <b>SelectionCommand</b>
        Specifies a command (callback) to evaluate when  the  selection  is  retrieved  from  a  table  via  the
        selection mechanism (ie: evaluating "<b>selection</b> <b>get</b>"). The return value from this command will become the
        string  passed  on by the selection mechanism.  The following arguments are passed to this callback: The
        number of rows in the selection, number of columns in the selection, the selection string, the number of
        cell in the selection.

       Switch: <b>-selectmode</b>
       Name: <b>selectMode</b>
       Class: <b>SelectMode</b>
        Specifies one of several styles for manipulating  the  selection.   The  value  of  the  option  may  be
        arbitrary,  but  the  default bindings expect it to be either <b>single</b>, <b>browse</b>, <b>multiple</b>, or <b>extended</b>; the
        default value is <b>browse</b>.  These styles are like  those  for  the  Tk  listbox,  except  expanded  for  2
        dimensions.

       Switch: <b>-selecttitle</b>
       Name: <b>selectTitles</b>
       Class: <b>SelectTitles</b>
        Specifies whether title cells should be allowed in the selection. Defaults to 0 (disallowed).

       Switch: <b>-selecttype</b>
       Name: <b>selectType</b>
       Class: <b>SelectType</b>
        Specifies  one  of several types of selection for the table.  The value of the option may be one of <b>row</b>,
        <b>col</b>, <b>cell</b>, or <b>both</b> (meaning <b>row</b> <b>&amp;&amp;</b> <b>col</b>); the default value is  <b>cell</b>.   These  types  define  whether  an
        entire row/col is affected when a cell's selection is changed (set or clear).

       Switch: <b>-sparsearray</b>
       Name: <b>sparseArray</b>
       Class: <b>SparseArray</b>
        A  boolean value that specifies whether an associated Tcl array should be kept as a sparse array (1, the
        default) or as a full array (0).  If true, then cell values that are empty  will  be  deleted  from  the
        array (taking less memory).  If false, then all values in the array will be maintained.

       Switch: <b>-state</b>
       Name: <b>state</b>
       Class: <b>State</b>
        Specifies one of two states for the entry:  <b>normal</b> or <b>disabled</b>.  If the table is disabled then the value
        may  not  be  changed using widget commands and no insertion cursor will be displayed, even if the input
        focus is in the widget.  Also, all insert or delete methods will be ignored.  Defaults to <b>normal</b>.

       Switch: <b>-titlecols</b>
       Name: <b>titleCols</b>
       Class: <b>TitleCols</b>
        Number of columns to use as a title area.  Defaults to 0.

       Switch: <b>-titlerows</b>
       Name: <b>titleRows</b>
       Class: <b>TitleRows</b>
        Number of rows to use as a title area.  Defaults to 0.

       Switch: <b>-usecommand</b>
       Name: <b>useCommand</b>
       Class: <b>UseCommand</b>
        A boolean value which specifies whether to use the <b>command</b> option. This value sets  itself  to  zero  if
        <b>command</b> is used and returns an error. Defaults to 1 (will use <b>command</b> if specified).

       Switch: <b>-validate</b>
       Name: <b>validate</b>
       Class: <b>Validate</b>
        A boolean specifying whether validation should occur for the active buffer. Defaults to 0.

       Switch: <b>-validatecommand</b> <b>or</b> <b>-vcmd</b>
       Name: <b>validateCommand</b>
       Class: <b>ValidateCommand</b>
        Specifies  a  command (callback) to execute when the active cell is edited.  This command is expected to
        return a 1 or 0.  If it returns 1, then it is assumed the new value is OK, otherwise the  new  value  is
        rejected  (the  edition will not take place).  Errors in this command are handled in the background. The
        following arguments are supplied to the callback: row, col, oldContents of cell, potential new  contents
        of cell, Current Index in the cell.

       Switch: <b>-variable</b>
       Name: <b>variable</b>
       Class: <b>Variable</b>
        Global  Tcl  array  variable to attach to the table's C array.  It will be created if it doesn't already
        exist or is a simple variable.  Keys used by the table in the array are of the form  <u>row</u>,<u>col</u>  for  cells
        and the special key <u>active</u> which contains the value of the active cell buffer.  The Tcl array is managed
        as  a  sparse  array  (the table doesn't require all valid indices have values).  No stored value for an
        index is equivalent to the empty string, and clearing a cell will remove that index from the Tcl  array,
        unless the <b>-sparsearray</b> options is set to 0.

       Switch: <b>-width</b>
       Name: <b>width</b>
       Class: <b>Width</b>
        Specifies  the desired width for the window, in columns. If zero or less, then the desired width for the
        window is made just large enough to hold all the columns in the table.  The width can be further limited
        by <b>-maxwidth</b>.

       Switch: <b>-wrap</b>
       Name: <b>wrap</b>
       Class: <b>Wrap</b>
        Specifies the default wrap value for tags.  Defaults to 0.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>TableMatrix</b> command creates a 2-dimensional grid of cells.  The table can use a Tcl array variable or
       Tcl command for data storage and retrieval.  The widget has an active cell, the contents of which can  be
       edited  (when  the state is normal).  The widget supports a default style for the cells and also multiple
       <u>tags</u>, which can be used to change the style of a row, column or cell (see  TAGS  for  details).   A  cell
       <u>flash</u> can be set up so that changed cells will change color for a specified amount of time ("blink").
        Cells can have embedded images or windows, as described in Tags and "Embedded Windows" respectively.

       One or more cells may be selected as described below.
        If  a  table is exporting its selection (see <b>-exportselection</b> option), then it will observe the standard
       X11 protocols for handling the selection.
        See "the Selection" for details. It is not necessary for all the cells to  be  displayed  in  the  table
       window  at  once;  commands  described  below  may be used to change the view in the window. Tables allow
       scrolling in both directions using the standard <b>-xscrollcommand</b> and <b>-yscrollcommand</b> options.
        They also support scanning, as described below.

       In order to obtain good performance, the table widget supports multiple drawing modes, two of  which  are
       fully Tk compatible.

</pre><h4><b>Indices</b></h4><pre>
       Many  of  the  widget  commands  for  tables  take one or more indices as arguments. An index specifies a
       particular cell of the table, in any of the following ways:

       <u>number,number</u>
        Specifies the cell as a numerical index of row,col which corresponds to the index of the associated Perl
        Hash, where <b>-roworigin,-colorigin</b> corresponds to the first cell in  the  table  (0,0  by  default).  The
        values for row and column will be constrained to actual values in the table, which means a valid cell is
        always found.

       <b>active</b>
        Indicates the cell that has the location cursor. It is specified with the <b>activate</b> widget command.

       <b>anchor</b>
        Indicates the anchor point for the selection, which is set with the <b>selection</b> <b>anchor</b> widget command.

       <b>bottomright</b>
        Indicates the bottom-rightmost cell visible in the table.

       <b>end</b>
        Indicates the bottom right cell of the table.

       <b>origin</b>
        Indicates  the top-leftmost editable cell of the table, not necessarily in the display.  This takes into
        account the user specified origin and title area.

       <b>topleft</b>
        Indicates the top-leftmost editable cell visible in the table (this excludes title cells).

       <b>@x,y</b>
        Indicates the cell that covers  the  point  in  the  table  window  specified  by  <u>x</u>  and  <u>y</u>  (in  pixel
        coordinates).   If no cell covers that point, then the closest cell to that point is used. In the widget
        command descriptions below, arguments named <u>index</u>, <u>first</u>, and <u>last</u> always contain text indices in one of
        the above forms.

</pre><h4><b>Tags</b></h4><pre>
       A tag is a textual string that is associated with zero or more rows, columns or cells in a  table.   Tags
       may contain arbitrary characters, but it is probably best to avoid using names which look like indices to
       reduce  coding  confusion.   There may be any number of tags in a table, but each row, column or cell can
       only have one tag associated with it at a time.  There are several permanent tags in each table that  can
       be configured by the user and will determine the attributes for special cells:

       <b>active</b>
        This tag is given to the <u>active</u> cell

       <b>flash</b>
        If flash mode is on, this tag is given to any recently edited cells.

       <b>sel</b>
        This tag is given to any selected cells.

       <b>title</b>
        This tag is given to any cells in the title rows and columns.  This tag has <b>-state</b> <u>disabled</u> by default.

       Tags  control  the  way cells are displayed on the screen.  Where appropriate, the default for displaying
       cells is determined by the options for the table widget.  However, display options may be associated with
       individual tags using the tagConfigure method.  If a cell, row  or  column  has  been  tagged,  then  the
       display  options  associated  with the tag override the default display style.  The following options are
       currently supported for tags:

       <b>-anchor</b> <u>anchor</u>
        Anchor for item in the cell space.

       <b>-background</b> or <b>-bg</b> <u>color</u>
        Background color of the cell.

       <b>-borderwidth</b> or <b>-bd</b> <u>pixel</u>
        Borderwidth of the cell, of the same format for the table, but may also be empty to inherit the  default
        table borderwidth value (the default).

       <b>-font</b> <u>fontName</u>
        Font for text in the cell.

       <b>-foreground</b> or <b>-fg</b> <u>color</u>
        Foreground color of the cell.

       <b>-justify</b> <u>justify</u>
        How to justify multi-line text in a cell. It must be one of <b>left</b>, <b>right</b>, or <b>center</b>.

       <b>-image</b> <u>imageName</u>
        An image to display in the cell instead of text.

       <b>-multiline</b> <u>boolean</u>
        Whether to display text with newlines on multiple lines.

       <b>-relief</b>
        The relief for the cell. May be the empty string to cause this tag to not disturb the value.

       <b>-showtext</b> <u>boolean</u>
        Whether to show the text over an image.

       <b>-state</b> <u>state</u>
        The  state  of  the  cell,  to allow for certain cells to be disabled. This prevents the cell from being
        edited by the <u>insert</u>  or <u>delete</u> methods, but a direct <u>set</u> will not be prevented.

       <b>-wrap</b> <u>boolean</u>
        Whether characters should wrap in a cell that is not wide enough.

       A priority order is defined among tags based on creation order (first created  tag  has  highest  default
       priority),  and  this  order  is  used in implementing some of the tag-related functions described below.
       When a cell is displayed, its properties are determined by the  tags  which  are  assigned  to  it.   The
       priority of a tag can be modified by the <u>tagLower</u> and the <u>tagRaise</u> methods.

       If  a  cell  has  several tags associated with it that define the same display options (eg - a <b>title</b> cell
       with specific <b>row</b> and <b>cell</b> tags), then the options of the highest priority tag are used.  If a particular
       display option hasn't been specified for a particular tag, or if it is specified as an empty string, then
       that option will not be used; the next-highest-priority tag's option will be used  instead.   If  no  tag
       specifies a particular display option, then the default style for the widget will be used.

       Images  are  used for display purposes only.  Editing in that cell will still be enabled and any querying
       of the cell will show the text value of the cell, regardless of the value of <b>-showtext</b>.

       Note: There can be only one tag for a given tag type. ( Tag types = <b>flash</b>, <b>active</b>,  <b>sel</b>,  <b>title</b>,  <b>celltag</b>
       <b>rowtag</b>, <b>coltag</b>.) For example, you can't apply two cell tags to a single cell (or two row tags to a single
       row, etc) and expect the tag's properties to be merged. The last tag-type applied will be the one that is
       used.

</pre><h4><b>Embedded</b> <b>Windows</b></h4><pre>
       There  may be any number of embedded windows in a table widget (one per cell), and any widget may be used
       as an embedded window (subject to the usual rules for geometry management, which require the table window
       to be the parent of the embedded window or a descendant of its parent).  The embedded  window's  position
       on the screen will be updated as the table is modified or scrolled, and it will be mapped and unmapped as
       it  moves into and out of the visible area of the table widget.  Each embedded window occupies one cell's
       worth of space in the table widget, and it is referred to by the index of the cell in the table.  Windows
       associated with the table widget are destroyed when the table widget is destroyed.

       Windows are used for display purposes only.  A value still exists for that cell, but will  not  be  shown
       unless  the  window  is  deleted  in some way.  If the window is destroyed or lost by the table widget to
       another geometry manager, then any data associated with it is lost (the cell it occupied will  no  longer
       appear in <b>window</b> <b>names</b>).

       When  an  embedded  window  is  added to a table widget with the window configure widget command, several
       configuration options may be associated with it.  These options may be modified with later calls  to  the
       window configure widget command.  The following options are currently supported:

       <b>-create</b> <u>callback</u>
        NOT  CURRENTLY  SUPPORTED.   Specifies  a  Tcl script that may be evaluated to create the window for the
        annotation.
         If no -window option has been specified for this cell then this script will be evaluated when the  cell
        is about to be displayed on the screen.
         Script  must  create  a  window  for  the cell and return the name of that window as its result. If the
        cell's window should ever be deleted, the script will be evaluated again  the  next  time  the  cell  is
        displayed.

       <b>-background</b> or <b>-bg</b> <u>color</u>
        Background color of the cell.  If not specified, it uses the table's default background.

       <b>-borderwidth</b> or <b>-bd</b> <u>pixelList</u>
        Borderwidth  of the cell, of the same format for the table, but may also be empty to inherit the default
        table borderwidth value (the default).

       <b>-padx</b> <u>pixels</u>
        As defined in the Tk options man page.

       <b>-pady</b> <u>pixels</u>
        As defined in the Tk options man page.

       <b>-relief</b> <u>relief</u>
        The relief to use for the cell in which the window lies.  If not specified, it uses the table's  default
        relief.

       <b>-sticky</b> <u>sticky</u>
        Stickiness of the window inside the cell, as defined by the <b>grid</b> command.

       <b>-window</b> <u>$widget</u>
        Specifies the a window to display in the  annotation.  It must exist before being specified here.

</pre><h4><b>the</b> <b>Selection</b></h4><pre>
       Table selections are available as type STRING.  By default, the value of the selection will be the values
       of the selected cells in nested Tcl list form where each row is a list and each column is an element of a
       row list. You can change the way this value is interpreted by setting the <b>-rowseparator</b> and <b>-colseparator</b>
       options.
        For  example,  default  Excel  format  would  be to set <b>-rowseparator</b> to "\n" and <b>-colseparator</b> to "\t".
       Changing these values affects both how the table sends out  the  selection  and  reads  in  pasted  data,
       ensuring  that  the table should always be able to cut and paste to itself.  It is possible to change how
       pastes are handled by editing the table library procedure <b>tk_tablePasteHandler</b> .  This might be necessary
       if <b>-selectioncommand</b> is set.

</pre><h4><b>Row/Col</b> <b>Spanning</b></h4><pre>
       Individual cells can span multiple rows and/or columns.  This is done via the <b>spans</b>  command  (see  below
       for exact arguments).  Cells in the title area that span are not permitted to span beyond the title area,
       and  will be constrained accordingly.  If the title area shrinks during a configure, sanity checking will
       occur to ensure the above.  You may set spans on regular cells that extend  beyond  the  defined  row/col
       area.   These spans will not be constrained, so that when the defined row/col area expands, the span will
       expand with it.

       When setting a span, checks are made as to whether the span would overlap an already spanning  or  hidden
       cell.  This is an error and it not allowed. Spans can affect the overall speed of table drawing, although
       not significantly.  If spans are not used, then there is no performance loss.

       Cells  <u>hidden</u> by spanning cells still have valid data.  This will be seen during cut and paste operations
       that involve hidden cells, or through direct access by a command like <b>get</b> or <b>set</b>.

       The drawing properties of spanning cells apply to only the visual area of the cell.  For  example,  if  a
       cell  is  center justified over 5 columns, then when viewing any portion of those columns, it will appear
       centered in the visible area. The non-visible column  area  will  not  be  considered  in  the  centering
       calculations.

</pre><h4><b>Command</b> <b>Substitution</b></h4><pre>
       The  various  option  based  commands  that the table supports all support the familiar Tk %-substitution
       model (see Tk::bind for more details).  The following %-sequences are recognized and substituted  by  the
       table widget:

       <b>%c</b>
        For  <b>SelectionCommand</b>, it is the maximum number of columns in any row in the selection.  Otherwise it is
        the column of the triggered cell.

       <b>%C</b>
        A convenience substitution for <u>%r</u>,<u>%c</u>.

       <b>%i</b>
        For <b>SelectionCommand</b>, it is the total number of cells in the selection. For <b>Command</b>, it is 0 for a  read
        (get) and 1 for a write (set). Otherwise it is the current cursor position in the cell.

       <b>%r</b>
        For  <b>SelectionCommand</b>,  it  is  the  number  of  rows  in  the selection. Otherwise it is the row of the
        triggered cell.

       <b>%s</b>
        For <b>ValidateCommand</b>, it is the current value of the cell being validated.  For <b>SelectionCommand</b>,  it  is
        the  default  value  of  the selection. For <b>BrowseCommand</b> , it is the index of the last active cell. For
        <b>Command</b>, it is empty for reads (get) and the current value of the cell for writes (set).

       <b>%S</b>
        For <b>ValidateCommand</b>, it is the potential new value of the cell being validated.  For  <b>BrowseCommand</b>,  it
        is the index of the new active cell.

       <b>%W</b>
        The pathname to the window for which the command was generated.

</pre><h4><b>Widget</b> <b>Methods</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>$window-</b>&gt;<b>TableMatrix</b>  method  creates  a  widget object. This object supports the <b>configure</b> and <b>cget</b>
       methods described in Tk::options which can be used to enquire and modify  the  options  described  above.
       The widget also inherits all the methods provided by the generic Tk::Widget class.

       The following additional methods are available for scale widgets:

       <u>$table</u>-&gt;<b>activate</b>(<u>index</u>)
        Sets the active cell to the one indicated by <u>index</u>.

       <u>$table</u>-&gt;<b>bbox</b>(<u>first</u>, ?<u>last</u>?)
        It  returns  the  bounding  box for the specified cell (range) as a 4-tuple of x, y, width and height in
        pixels.  It clips the box to the visible portion, if any, otherwise an empty string is returned.

       <u>$table</u>-&gt;<b>border</b>(<u>option,</u> <u>args</u>)
        This command is a voodoo hack to implement border sizing for tables.  This is  normally  called  through
        bindings, with the following as valid options:

       <u>$table</u>-&gt;<b>borderMark</b>(<u>x,</u> <u>y</u>, ?<u>row|col</u>?)
         Records  <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> and the row and/or column border under that point in the table window, if any; used in
         conjunction with later <b>border</b> <b>dragto</b> commands.  Typically this  command  is  associated  with  a  mouse
         button  press in the widget.  If <u>row</u> or <u>col</u> is not specified, it returns a tuple of both border indices
         (an empty item means no border). Otherwise, just the specified item is returned.

       <u>$table</u>-&gt;<b>borderDragto</b>(<u>x,</u> <u>y</u>)
         This command computes the difference between its <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> arguments and the <u>x</u> and  <u>y</u>  arguments  to  the
         last  <b>border</b>  <b>mark</b>  command  for  the  widget.   It  then  adjusts  the previously marked border by the
         difference.  This command is typically associated with mouse motion events in the  widget,  to  produce
         the effect of interactive border resizing.

       <u>$table</u>-&gt;<b>cget</b>(<u>option</u>)
        Returns  the  current  value  of  the  configuration option given by <u>option</u>.  <u>Option</u> may have any of the
        values accepted by the <b>table</b> command.

       <u>$table</u>-&gt;<b>clear</b>(<u>option</u>, ?<u>first</u>?, ?<u>last</u>?)
        This command is a convenience routine to clear certain state information managed by  the  table.   <u>first</u>
        and  <u>last</u>  represent  valid  table  indices.  If neither are specified, then the command operates on the
        whole table.  The following options are recognized:

       <u>$table</u>-&gt;<b>clearCache</b>(?<u>first</u>?, ?<u>last</u>?)
         Clears the specified section of the cache, if the table has been keeping one.

       <u>$table</u>-&gt;<b>clearSizes</b>(?<u>first</u>?, ?<u>last</u>?)
         Clears the specified row and column areas of specific height/width dimensions.  When just one index  is
         specified, for example <b>2,0</b>, that is interpreted as row 2 <b>and</b> column 0.

       <u>$table</u>-&gt;<b>clearTags</b>(?<u>first</u>?, ?<u>last</u>?)
         Clears the specified area of tags (all row, column and cell tags).

       <u>$table</u>-&gt;<b>clearAll</b>(?<u>first</u>?, ?<u>last</u>?)
         Performs all of the above clear functions on the specified area.

       <u>$table</u>-&gt;<b>colWidth</b>(?<u>col</u>?, ?<u>value,</u> <u>col,</u> <u>value,</u> <u>...</u>?)
        If  no  <u>col</u>  is specified, returns a list describing all cols for which a width has been set.  If <b>col</b> is
        specified with no value, it prints out the width of that col in characters (positive number)  or  pixels
        (negative number).  If one or more <u>col-value</u> pairs are specified, then it sets each col to be that width
        in characters (positive number) or pixels (negative number).  If <u>value</u> is <u>default</u>, then the col uses the
        default width, specified by <b>-colwidth</b>.

        <u>$table</u>-&gt;<b>configure</b>(?<u>option</u>?, ?<u>value,</u> <u>option,</u> <u>value,</u> <u>...</u>?)
         Query  or  modify  the  configuration  options of the widget. If no <u>option</u> is specified, returns a list
         describing all of the available options for <u>pathName</u>  (see  <b>Tk_ConfigureInfo</b>  for  information  on  the
         format of this list).  If <u>option</u> is specified with no <u>value</u>, then the command returns a list describing
         the one named option (this list will be identical to the corresponding sublist of the value returned if
         no  <u>option</u>  is  specified).  If one or more <u>option-value</u> pairs are specified, then the command modifies
         the given widget option(s) to have the given value(s);  in this  case  the  command  returns  an  empty
         string. <u>Option</u> may have any of the values accepted by the <b>table</b> command.

        <u>$table</u>-&gt;<b>curselection</b>(?<u>value</u>?)
         With  no  arguments,  it returns the sorted indices of the currently selected cells.  Otherwise it sets
         all the selected cells to the given value.  The set has no effect if there is no associated  Tcl  array
         or the state is disabled.

        <u>$table</u>-&gt;<b>curvalue</b>(?<u>value</u>?)
         If  no  value  is given, the value of the cell being edited (indexed by <b>active</b>) is returned, else it is
         set to the given value.

        <u>$table</u>-&gt;<b>delete</b>(<u>option,</u> <u>arg</u>, ?<u>arg</u>?)
         This command is used to delete various things in a table.  It  has  several  forms,  depending  on  the
         <u>option</u>:

        <u>$table</u>-&gt;<b>deleteActive</b>(<u>index</u>, ?<u>index</u>?)
          Deletes  text  from  the active cell.  If only one index is given, it deletes the character after that
          index, otherwise it deletes from the first index to the second.  <u>index</u> can be a number, <b>insert</b> or <b>end</b>.

        <u>$table</u>-&gt;<b>deleteCols</b>(?<u>switches</u>?, <u>index</u>, ?<u>count</u>?)
          Deletes <u>count</u> cols starting at (and including) col <u>index</u>.  The <u>index</u> will be constrained to the limits
          of the tables.  If <u>count</u> is negative, it deletes cols to the left.  Otherwise it deletes cols  to  the
          right.   <u>count</u>  defaults to 1 (meaning just the column specified).  The selection will be cleared.  At
          the moment, spans are not adjusted with this action.  Optional switches are:

        <b>-holddimensions</b>
           Causes the table cols to be unaffected by the deletion (empty cols may appear).
            By default the dimensions are adjusted by <b>count</b>.

        <b>-holdtags</b>
           Causes the tags specified by the <u>tag</u> method to not move along with the data.  Also prevents  specific
           widths set by the <u>width</u> method from being adjusted.
            By default, these tags are properly adjusted.

        <b>-holdwindows</b>
           Causes  the  embedded  windows  created  with  the <u>window</u> method to not move along with the data.  By
           default, these windows are properly adjusted.

        <b>-keeptitles</b>
           Prevents title area cells from being changed.  Otherwise they are treated just like regular cells and
           will move as specified.

        <u>$table</u>-&gt;<b>deleteRows</b>(?<u>switches</u>?, <u>index</u>, ?<u>count</u>?)
          Deletes <b>count</b> rows starting at (and including) row <b>index</b>.  If <b>count</b> is negative, it deletes rows going
          up.  Otherwise it deletes rows going down.  The selection will be cleared.  The switches are the  same
          as those for column deletion.

        <u>$table</u>-&gt;<b>get</b>(<u>first</u>, ?<u>last</u>?)
         Returns the value of the cells specified by the table indices <u>first</u> and (optionally) <u>last</u> in a list.

        <u>$table</u>-&gt;<b>hidden</b>(?<u>index</u>?, ?<u>index,</u> <u>...</u>?)
         When called without args, it returns all the <u>hidden</u> cells (those cells covered by a spanning cell).  If
         one  index is specified, it returns the spanning cell covering that index, if any.  If multiple indices
         are specified, it returns 1 if all indices are hidden cells, 0 otherwise.

        <u>$table</u>-&gt;<b>icursor</b>(?<u>arg</u>?)
         With no arguments, prints out the location of the insertion  cursor  in  the  active  cell.   With  one
         argument,  sets  the cursor to that point in the string.  0 is before the first character, you can also
         use <b>insert</b> or <b>end</b> for the current insertion point or the end of the text.  If there is no active  cell,
         or the cell or table is disabled, this will return -1.

        <u>$table</u>-&gt;<b>index</b>(<u>index</u>, ?<u>row|col</u>?)
         Returns  the  integer cell coordinate that corresponds to <u>index</u> in the form row,col.  If <b>row</b>  or <b>col</b> is
         specified, then only the row or column index is returned.

        <u>$table</u>-&gt;<b>insert</b>(<u>option,</u> <u>arg,</u> <u>arg</u>)
         This command is used to into various things into a table.  It  has  several  forms,  depending  on  the
         <u>option</u>:

        <u>$table</u>-&gt;<b>insertActive</b>(<u>index,</u> <u>value</u>)
          The  <u>value</u> is a text string which is inserted at the <u>index</u> position of the active cell.  The cursor is
          then positioned after the new text. <u>index</u> can be a number, <b>insert</b> or <b>end</b>.

        <u>$table</u>-&gt;<b>insertCols</b>(?<u>switches</u>?, <u>index</u>, ?<u>count</u>?)
          Inserts <b>count</b> cols starting at col <b>index</b>.  If <b>count</b> is negative, it inserts before the specified  col.
          Otherwise  it  inserts  after the specified col.  The selection will be cleared.  The switches are the
          same as those for column deletion.

        <u>$table</u>-&gt;<b>insertRows</b>(?<u>switches</u>?, <u>index</u>, ?<u>count</u>?)
          Inserts <b>count</b> rows starting at row <b>index</b>.  If <b>count</b> is negative, it inserts before the specified  row.
          Otherwise  it  inserts  after the specified row.  The selection will be cleared.  The switches are the
          same as those for column deletion.

        <u>$table</u>-&gt;<b>reread</b>()
         Rereads the old contents of the cell back into the editing buffer.   Useful  for  a  key  binding  when
         &lt;Escape&gt; is pressed to abort the edit (a default binding).

        <u>$table</u>-&gt;<b>rowHeight</b>(?<u>row</u>?, ?<u>value,</u> <u>row,</u> <u>value,</u> <u>...</u>?)
         If  no <u>row</u> is specified, returns a list describing all rows for which a height has been set.  If <b>row</b> is
         specified with no value, it prints out the height of that row in characters (positive number) or pixels
         (negative number).  If one or more <u>row-value</u> pairs are specified, then it sets  each  row  to  be  that
         height  in lines (positive number) or pixels (negative number).  If <u>value</u> is <u>default</u>, then the row uses
         the default height, specified by <b>-rowheight</b>.

        <u>$table</u>-&gt;<b>scan</b>(<u>option,</u> <u>args</u>)
         This command is used to implement scanning on tables.  It has two forms, depending on <u>option</u>:

        <u>$table</u>-&gt;<b>scanMark</b>(<u>x,</u> <u>y</u>)
          Records <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> and the current view in the table window;
           used in conjunction with later <b>scan</b> <b>dragto</b> commands. Typically this  command  is  associated  with  a
          mouse button press in the widget.  It returns an empty string.

        <u>$table</u>-&gt;<b>scanDragto</b>(<u>x,</u> <u>y</u>.)
          This  command  computes  the difference between its <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> arguments and the <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> arguments to the
          last <b>scan</b> <b>mark</b> command for the widget.  It then  adjusts  the  view  by  5  times  the  difference  in
          coordinates.   This command is typically associated with mouse motion events in the widget, to produce
          the effect of dragging the list at high speed through the  window.   The  return  value  is  an  empty
          string.

        <u>$table</u>-&gt;<b>see</b>(<u>index</u>)
         Adjust the view in the table so that the cell given by <u>index</u> is positioned as the cell one off from top
         left (excluding title rows and columns) if the cell is not currently visible on the screen.  The actual
         cell may be different to keep the screen full.

        <u>$table</u>-&gt;<b>selection</b>(<u>option,</u> <u>arg</u>)
         This command is used to adjust the selection within a table.
          It has several forms, depending on <u>option</u>:

        <u>$table</u>-&gt;<b>selectionAnchor</b>(<u>index</u>)
          Sets  the  selection  anchor  to  the  cell  given  by  <u>index</u>.  The selection anchor is the end of the
          selection that is fixed while dragging out a selection with the mouse.  The index <b>anchor</b> may  be  used
          to refer to the anchor cell.

        <u>$table</u>-&gt;<b>selectionClear</b>(<u>first</u>?<u>last</u>?)
          If any of the cells between <u>first</u> and <u>last</u> (inclusive) are selected, they are deselected.
           The  selection  state  is not changed for cells outside this range.  <u>first</u> may be specified as <b>all</b> to
          remove the selection from all cells.

        <u>$table</u>-&gt;<b>selectionIncludes</b>(<u>index</u>)
          Returns 1 if the cell indicated by <u>index</u> is currently selected, 0 if it isn't.

        <u>$table</u>-&gt;<b>selectionSet</b>(<u>first</u>, ?<u>last</u>?)
          Selects all of the cells in the range  between  <u>first</u>  and  <u>last</u>,  inclusive,  without  affecting  the
          selection state of cells outside that range.

        perltk note this needs to be perlized

        <u>$table</u>-&gt;<b>set</b>(?<u>row|col</u>?, <u>index</u>, ?<u>value</u>?, ?<u>index,</u> <u>value,</u> <u>...</u>?)
         Sets  the  specified  index  to  the associated value.  Table validation will not be triggered via this
         method.  If <b>row</b> or <b>col</b> precedes the list of index/value pairs, then the value is assumed to  be  a  Tcl
         list  whose values will be split and set into the subsequent columns (if <b>row</b> is specified) or rows (for
         <b>col</b>).  For example,  <b>set</b> <b>row</b> <b>2,3</b> <b>{2,3</b> <b>2,4</b> <b>2,5}</b> will set 3 cells, from 2,3 to 2,5.  The setting of cells
         is silently bounded by the known table dimensions.

        <u>$table</u>-&gt;<b>spans</b>(?<u>index</u>?, ?<u>rows,cols,</u> <u>index,</u> <u>rows,cols,</u> <u>...</u>?)
         This command is used to manipulate row/col spans.  When called with no arguments, all known  spans  are
         returned  as  a list of tuples of the form {index span}.  When called with only the <u>index</u>, the span for
         that <u>index</u> only is returned, if any.  Otherwise an even number of <u>index</u> <u>rows,cols</u> pairs are used to set
         spans.  A span starts at the <u>index</u> and continues for the specified number of rows  and  cols.  Negative
         spans are not supported.  A span of 0,0 unsets any span on that cell.  See EXAMPLES for more info.

        <u>$table</u>-&gt;<b>tag</b>(option, ?<u>arg,</u> <u>arg,</u> <u>...</u>?)
         This  command  is  used  to  manipulate  tags.  The exact behavior of the command depends on the <u>option</u>
         argument that follows the <b>tag</b> argument. <u>cget</u>, <u>cell</u>, and <u>row|col</u> complain about unknown tag names.   The
         following forms of the command are currently supported:

        <u>$table</u>-&gt;<b>tagCell</b>(<u>tagName,</u> <u>?index,</u> <u>...?</u>)
          With  no  arguments,  prints  out the list of cells that use the <u>tag</u>.  Otherwise it sets the specified
          cells to use the named tag, replacing any tag that may have been set using  this  method  before.   If
          <u>tagName</u>  is  '', the cells are reset to the default <u>tag</u>.  Tags added during -*tagcommand evaluation do
          not register here.  If <u>tagName</u> does not exist, it will be created with the default options.

        <u>$table</u>-&gt;<b>tagCget</b>(<u>tagName,</u> <u>option</u>)
          This command returns the current value of the option named <u>option</u> associated with  the  tag  given  by
          <u>tagName</u>.  <u>Option</u> may have any of the values accepted by the <b>tag</b> <b>configure</b> widget command.

        <u>$table</u>-&gt;<b>tagCol</b>(<u>tagName,</u> <u>?col,</u> <u>...?</u>)
          With  no  arguments,  prints  out  the list of cols that use the <u>tag</u>.  Otherwise it sets the specified
          columns to use the named tag, replacing any tag that may have been set using this method  before.   If
          &lt;tagName&gt;  is  '', the cols are reset to the default <u>tag</u>.  Tags added during -coltagcommand evaluation
          do not register here.  If <u>tagName</u> does not exist, it will be created with the default options.

        <u>$table</u>-&gt;<b>tagConfigure</b>(<u>tagName</u>, ?<u>option</u>?, ?<u>value</u>?, ?<u>option,</u> <u>value,</u> <u>...</u>?)
          This command is similar to the <b>configure</b> widget command except that  it  modifies  options  associated
          with the tag given by <u>tagName</u> instead of modifying options for the overall table widget.  If no <u>option</u>
          is  specified,  the  command  returns  a list describing all of the available options for <u>tagName</u> (see
          <b>Tk_ConfigureInfo</b> for information on the format of this list).  If <u>option</u> is specified with  no  <u>value</u>,
          then  the  command  returns a list describing the one named option (this list will be identical to the
          corresponding sublist of the value returned if no <u>option</u> is specified).  If one or  more  <u>option-value</u>
          pairs  are  specified,  then  the  command  modifies the given option(s) to have the given value(s) in
          <u>tagName</u>; in this case the command returns an empty string. See TAGS above for details on  the  options
          available for tags.

        <u>$table</u>-&gt;<b>tagDelete</b>(<u>tagName</u>)
          Deletes a tag.  No error if the tag does not exist.

        <u>$table</u>-&gt;<b>tagExists</b>(<u>tagName</u>)
          Returns 1 if the named tag exists, 0 otherwise.

        <u>$table</u>-&gt;<b>tagIncludes</b>(<u>tagName,</u> <u>index</u>)
          Returns 1 if the specified index has the named tag, 0 otherwise.

        <u>$table</u>-&gt;<b>tagLower</b>(<u>tagName,</u> <u>?belowThis?</u>)
          Lower  the  priority  of  the  named  tag.   If <u>belowThis</u> is not specified, then the tag's priority is
          lowered to the bottom, otherwise it is lowered to one below <u>belowThis</u>.

        <u>$table</u>-&gt;<b>tagNames</b>(?<u>pattern</u>?)
          If no pattern is specified, shows the names of all defined tags. Otherwise the <u>pattern</u> is  used  as  a
          glob  pattern  to  show  only  tags  matching  that pattern.  Tag names are returned in priority order
          (highest priority tag first).

        <u>$table</u>-&gt;<b>tagRaise</b>(<u>tagName,</u> <u>?aboveThis?</u>)
          Raise the priority of the named tag.  If <u>aboveThis</u> is not specified, then the tag's priority is raised
          to the top, otherwise it is raised to one above <u>aboveThis</u>.

        <u>$table</u>-&gt;<b>tagRow</b>(<u>tagName,</u> <u>?row,</u> <u>...?</u>)
          With no arguments, prints out the list of rows that use the <u>tag</u>.   Otherwise  it  sets  the  specified
          columns  to  use the named tag, replacing any tag that may have been set using this method before.  If
          <u>tagName</u> is '', the rows are reset to use the default tag.  Tags added during -rowtagcommand evaluation
          do not register here.  If <u>tagName</u> does not exist, it will be created with the default options.

        <u>$table</u>-&gt;<b>validate</b>(<u>index</u>)
         Explicitly validates the specified index based on the current <b>-validatecommand</b> and returns 0 or 1 based
         on whether the cell was validated.

        <u>$table</u>-&gt;<b>window</b>(option, ?<u>arg,</u> <u>arg,</u> <u>...</u>?)
         This command is used to manipulate embedded windows.  The exact behavior of the command depends on  the
         <u>option</u>  argument  that  follows  the <b>window</b> argument.  The following forms of the command are currently
         supported:

        <u>$table</u>-&gt;<b>windowCget</b>(<u>index,</u> <u>option</u>)
          This command returns the current value of the option named <u>option</u> associated with the window given  by
          <u>index</u>.  <u>Option</u> may have any of the values accepted by the <b>window</b> <b>configure</b> widget command.

        <u>$table</u>-&gt;<b>windowConfigure</b>(<u>index</u>, ?<u>option</u>?, ?<u>value</u>?, ?<u>option,</u> <u>value,</u> <u>...</u>?)
          This  command  is  similar  to the <b>configure</b> widget command except that it modifies options associated
          with the embedded window given by <u>index</u> instead of modifying options for the overall table widget.  If
          no <u>option</u> is specified, the command returns a list describing all of the available options for <u>index</u>
          (see  <b>Tk_ConfigureInfo</b>  for  information  on the format of this list).  If <u>option</u> is specified with no
          <u>value</u>, then the command returns a list describing the one named option (this list will be identical to
          the corresponding sublist of the value returned if no <u>option</u> is specified).  If one  or  more  <u>option-</u>
          <u>value</u> pairs are specified, then the command modifies the given option(s) to have the given value(s) in
          <u>index</u>; in this case the command returns an empty string. See EMBEDDED WINDOWS above for details on the
          options available for windows.

        <u>$table</u>-&gt;<b>windowDelete</b>(<u>index</u>, ?<u>index,</u> <u>...</u>?)
          Deletes an embedded window from the table.  The associated window will also be deleted.

        <u>$table</u>-&gt;<b>windowMove</b>(<u>indexFrom,</u> <u>indexTo</u>)
          Moves  an embedded window from one cell to another.  If a window already exists in the target cell, it
          will be deleted.

        <u>$table</u>-&gt;<b>windowNames</b>(?<u>pattern</u>?)
          If no pattern is specified, shows the cells of all embedded windows. Otherwise the <u>pattern</u> is used  as
          a glob pattern to show only cells matching that pattern.

        <u>$table</u>-&gt;<b>xview</b>(<u>args</u>)
         This  command  is  used  to query and change the horizontal position of the information in the widget's
         window.  It can take any of the following forms:

        <u>$table</u>-&gt;<b>xview</b>()
         Returns a list containing two elements. Each element is a real fraction between 0 and 1;  together they
         describe the horizontal span that is visible in the window. For example, if the first element is .2 and
         the second element is .6, 20% of the table's text is off-screen to the left, the middle 40% is  visible
         in  the  window,  and  40%  of the text is off-screen to the right. These are the same values passed to
         scrollbars via the <b>-xscrollcommand</b> option.

        <u>$table</u>-&gt;<b>xview</b>(<u>index</u>)
         Adjusts the view in the window so that the column given by <u>index</u> is displayed at the left edge  of  the
         window.

        <u>$table</u>-&gt;<b>xviewMoveto</b>(<u>fraction</u>)
         Adjusts  the  view in the window so that <u>fraction</u> of the total width of the table text is off-screen to
         the left. <u>fraction</u> must be a fraction between 0 and 1.

        <u>$table</u>-&gt;<b>xviewScroll</b>(<u>number,</u> <u>what</u>)
         This command shifts the view in the window left or right according to <u>number</u> and <u>what</u>. <u>Number</u>  must  be
         an  integer.  <u>What</u>  must be either <b>units</b> or <b>pages</b> or an abbreviation of one of these. If <u>what</u> is <b>units</b>,
         the view adjusts left or right by <u>number</u> cells on the display;  if it is <b>pages</b> then the view adjusts by
         <u>number</u> screenfuls. If <u>number</u> is negative then cells farther to the  left  become  visible;   if  it  is
         positive then cells farther to the right become visible.

        <u>$table</u>-&gt;<b>yview</b>(<u>?args</u>?)
         This  command is used to query and change the vertical position of the text in the widget's window.  It
         can take any of the following forms:

        <u>$table</u>-&gt;<b>yview</b>()
          Returns a list containing two elements, both of which are real fractions between 0 and 1.   The  first
          element  gives  the position of the table element at the top of the window, relative to the table as a
          whole (0.5 means it is halfway through the table, for example).  The second element gives the position
          of the table element just after the last one in the window, relative to the table as a  whole.   These
          are the same values passed to scrollbars via the <b>-yscrollcommand</b> option.

        <u>$table</u>-&gt;<b>yview</b>(<u>index</u>)
          Adjusts the view in the window so that the row given by <u>index</u> is displayed at the top of the window.

        <u>$table</u>-&gt;<b>yviewMoveto</b>(<u>fraction</u>)
          Adjusts the view in the window so that the element given by <u>fraction</u> appears at the top of the window.
          <u>Fraction</u>  is  a  fraction between 0 and 1;  0 indicates the first element in the table, 0.33 indicates
          the element one-third the way through the table, and so on.

        <u>$table</u>-&gt;<b>yviewscroll</b>(<u>number,</u> <u>what</u>)
          This command adjusts the view in the window up or down according to <u>number</u> and <u>what</u>.  <u>Number</u>  must  be
          an  integer.   <u>What</u>  must  be either <b>units</b> or <b>pages</b>.  If <u>what</u> is <b>units</b>, the view adjusts up or down by
          <u>number</u> cells; if it is <b>pages</b> then the view adjusts by <u>number</u> screenfuls.  If <u>number</u> is  negative  then
          earlier elements become visible; if it is positive then later elements become visible.

</pre><h4><b>Default</b> <b>Bindings</b></h4><pre>
       The initialization creates class bindings that give the following default behaviour:

       [1]
        Clicking  Button-1  in  a  cell  activates  that  cell.   Clicking into an already active cell moves the
        insertion cursor to the character nearest the mouse.

       [2]
        Moving the mouse while Button-1 is pressed will stroke out a selection area. Exiting while  Button-1  is
        pressed causing scanning to occur on the table along with selection.

       [3]
        Moving the mouse while Button-2 is pressed causes scanning to occur without any selection.

       [4]
        Home moves the table to have the origin in view.

       [5]
        End moves the table to have the <b>end</b> cell in view.

       [6]
        Control-Home moves the table to the origin and activates that cell.

       [7]
        Control-End moves the table to the end and activates that cell.

       [8]
        Shift-Control-Home extends the selection to the origin.

       [9]
        Shift-Control-End extends the selection to the end.

       [10]
        The left, right, up and down arrows move the active cell.

       [11]
        Shift-&lt;arrow&gt; extends the selection in that direction.

       [12]
        Control-leftarrow and Control-rightarrow move the insertion cursor within the cell.

       [13]
        Control-slash selects all the cells.

       [14]
        Control-backslash clears selection from all the cells.

       [15]
        Backspace deletes the character before the insertion cursor in the active cell.

       [16]
        Delete deletes the character after the insertion cursor in the active cell.

       [17]
        Escape  rereads  the  value of the active cell from the specified data source, discarding any edits that
        have may been performed on the cell.

       [18]
        Control-a moves the insertion cursor to the beginning of the active cell.

       [19]
        Control-e moves the insertion cursor to the end of the active cell.

       [20]
        Control-minus and Control-equals decrease and increase the width of the column with the active  cell  in
        it.

       [21]
        Moving  the  mouse  while  Button-3 (the right button on Windows) is pressed while you are over a border
        will  cause  interactive  resizing  of  that  row  and/or  column  to  occur,  based  on  the  value  of
        <b>-resizeborders</b>.  Some  bindings  may have slightly different behavior dependent on the <b>-selectionmode</b> of
        the widget. If the widget is disabled using the <b>-state</b> option, then its view can still be  adjusted  and
        cells  can  still  be selected, but no insertion cursor will be displayed and no cell modifications will
        take place. The behavior of tables can be changed by defining new bindings for individual widgets or  by
        redefining the class bindings.  The default bindings are either compiled in the TableMatrix.pm file

</pre><h4><b>Performance</b> <b>Issues</b></h4><pre>
       The  number  of  rows  and columns or a table widget should not significantly affect the speed of redraw.
       Recalculation and redraw of table parameters and cells is restricted as much  as  possible.  The  display
       cell  with  the  insert  cursor  is  redrawn each time the cursor blinks, which causes a steady stream of
       graphics traffic.  Set the <b>-insertofftime</b> option to 0 avoid this.  The use of a <b>-command</b> with  the  table
       without a cache can cause significant slow-down, as the command is called once for each request of a cell
       value.

</pre><h4><b>Examples</b></h4><pre>
       Set  the topleft title area to be one spanning cell.  This overestimates both row and column span by one,
       but the command does all the constraining for us.  <b>$table</b>  <b>span</b>  <b>[$table</b>  <b>cget</b>  <b>-roworigin],[$table</b>  <b>cget</b>
       <b>-colorigin]</b>  <b>[$table</b>  <b>cget</b>  <b>-titlerows],[$table</b> <b>cget</b> <b>-titlecols]</b> Force a table window refresh (useful for
       the slight chance that a bug in the table is not causing proper refresh):  <b>$table</b> <b>configure</b> <b>-padx</b> <b>[$table</b>
       <b>cget</b> <b>-padx]</b>

</pre><h4><b>Keywords</b></h4><pre>
