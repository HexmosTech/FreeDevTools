</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       HTML::TableExtract - Perl module for extracting the content contained in tables within an HTML document,
       either as text or encoded element trees.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        # Matched tables are returned as table objects; tables can be matched
        # using column headers, depth, count within a depth, table tag
        # attributes, or some combination of the four.

        # Example: Using column header information.
        # Assume an HTML document with tables that have "Date", "Price", and
        # "Cost" somewhere in a row. The columns beneath those headings are
        # what you want to extract. They will be returned in the same order as
        # you specified the headers since 'automap' is enabled by default.

        use HTML::TableExtract;
        my $te = HTML::TableExtract-&gt;new( headers =&gt; [qw(Date Price Cost)] );
        $te-&gt;parse($html_string);

        # Examine all matching tables
        foreach my $ts ($te-&gt;tables) {
          print "Table (", join(',', $ts-&gt;coords), "):\n";
          foreach my $row ($ts-&gt;rows) {
             print join(',', @$row), "\n";
          }
        }

        # Shorthand...top level rows() method assumes the first table found in
        # the document if no arguments are supplied.
        foreach my $row ($te-&gt;rows) {
           print join(',', @$row), "\n";
        }

        # Example: Using depth and count information.
        # Every table in the document has a unique depth and count tuple, so
        # when both are specified it is a unique table. Depth and count both
        # begin with 0, so in this case we are looking for a table (depth 2)
        # within a table (depth 1) within a table (depth 0, which is the top
        # level HTML document). In addition, it must be the third (count 2)
        # such instance of a table at that depth.

        my $te = HTML::TableExtract-&gt;new( depth =&gt; 2, count =&gt; 2 );
        $te-&gt;parse_file($html_file);
        foreach my $ts ($te-&gt;tables) {
           print "Table found at ", join(',', $ts-&gt;coords), ":\n";
           foreach my $row ($ts-&gt;rows) {
              print "   ", join(',', @$row), "\n";
           }
        }

        # Example: Using table tag attributes.
        # If multiple attributes are specified, all must be present and equal
        # for match to occur.

        my $te = HTML::TableExtract-&gt;new( attribs =&gt; { border =&gt; 1 } );
        $te-&gt;parse($html_string);
        foreach my $ts ($te-&gt;tables) {
          print "Table with border=1 found at ", join(',', $ts-&gt;coords), ":\n";
          foreach my $row ($ts-&gt;rows) {
             print "   ", join(',', @$row), "\n";
          }
        }

        # Example: Extracting as an HTML::Element tree structure
        # Rather than extracting raw text, the html can be converted into a
        # tree of element objects. The HTML document is composed of
        # HTML::Element objects and the tables are HTML::ElementTable
        # structures. Using this, the contents of tables within a document can
        # be edited in-place.

        use HTML::TableExtract qw(tree);
        my $te = HTML::TableExtract-&gt;new( headers =&gt; qw(Fee Fie Foe Fum) );
        $te-&gt;parse_file($html_file);
        my $table = $te-&gt;first_table_found;
        my $table_tree = $table-&gt;tree;
        $table_tree-&gt;cell(4,4)-&gt;replace_content('Golden Goose');
        my $table_html = $table_tree-&gt;as_HTML;
        my $table_text = $table_tree-&gt;as_text;
        my $document_tree = $te-&gt;tree;
        my $document_html = $document_tree-&gt;as_HTML;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       HTML::TableExtract is a subclass of HTML::Parser that serves to extract the information from tables of
       interest contained within an HTML document. The information from each extracted table is stored in table
       objects. Tables can be extracted as text, HTML, or HTML::ElementTable structures (for in-place editing or
       manipulation).

       There are currently four constraints available to specify which tables you would like to extract from a
       document: <u>Headers</u>, <u>Depth</u>, <u>Count</u>, and <u>Attributes</u>.

       <u>Headers</u>, the most flexible and adaptive of the techniques, involves specifying text in an array that you
       expect to appear above the data in the tables of interest. Once all headers have been located in a row of
       that table, all further cells beneath the columns that matched your headers are extracted. All other
       columns are ignored: think of it as vertical slices through a table. In addition, TableExtract
       automatically rearranges each row in the same order as the headers you provided. If you would like to
       disable this, set <u>automap</u> to 0 during object creation, and instead rely on the <b>column_map()</b> method to
       find out the order in which the headers were found. Furthermore, TableExtract will automatically
       compensate for cell span issues so that columns are really the same columns as you would visually see in
       a browser. This behavior can be disabled by setting the <u>gridmap</u> parameter to 0. HTML is stripped from the
       entire textual content of a cell before header matches are attempted -- unless the <u>keep_html</u> parameter
       was enabled.

       <u>Depth</u> and <u>Count</u> are more specific ways to specify tables in relation to one another. <u>Depth</u> represents how
       deeply a table resides in other tables. The depth of a top-level table in the document is 0. A table
       within a top-level table has a depth of 1, and so on. Each depth can be thought of as a layer; tables
       sharing the same depth are on the same layer. Within each of these layers, <u>Count</u> represents the order in
       which a table was seen at that depth, starting with 0. Providing both a <u>depth</u> and a <u>count</u> will uniquely
       specify a table within a document.

       <u>Attributes</u> match based on the attributes of the html &lt;table&gt; tag, for example, border widths or
       background color.

       Each of the <u>Headers</u>, <u>Depth</u>, <u>Count</u>, and <u>Attributes</u> specifications are cumulative in their effect on the
       overall extraction.  For instance, if you specify only a <u>Depth</u>, then you get all tables at that depth
       (note that these could very well reside in separate higher- level tables throughout the document since
       depth extends across tables).  If you specify only a <u>Count</u>, then the tables at that <u>Count</u> from all depths
       are returned (i.e., the <u>n</u>th occurrence of a table at each depth). If you only specify <u>Headers</u>, then you
       get all tables in the document containing those column headers. If you have specified multiple
       constraints of <u>Headers</u>, <u>Depth</u>, <u>Count</u>, and <u>Attributes</u>, then each constraint has veto power over whether a
       particular table is extracted.

       If no <u>Headers</u>, <u>Depth</u>, <u>Count</u>, or <u>Attributes</u> are specified, then all tables match.

       When extracting only text from tables, the text is decoded with HTML::Entities by default; this can be
       disabled by setting the <u>decode</u> parameter to 0.

   <b>Extraction</b> <b>Modes</b>
       The default mode of extraction for HTML::TableExtract is raw text or HTML. In this mode, embedded tables
       are completely decoupled from one another. In this case, HTML::TableExtract is a subclass of
       HTML::Parser:

         use HTML::TableExtract;

       Alternatively, tables can be extracted as HTML::ElementTable structures, which are in turn embedded in an
       HTML::Element tree representing the entire HTML document. Embedded tables are not decoupled from one
       another since this tree structure must be maintained. In this case, HTML::TableExtract is a subclass of
       HTML::TreeBuilder (itself a subclass of HTML:::Parser):

         use HTML::TableExtract qw(tree);

       In either case, the basic interface for HTML::TableExtract and the resulting table objects remains the
       same -- all that changes is what you can do with the resulting data.

       HTML::TableExtract is a subclass of HTML::Parser, and as such inherits all of its basic methods such as
       "parse()" and "parse_file()". During scans, "start()", "end()", and "text()" are utilized. Feel free to
       override them, but if you do not eventually invoke them in the SUPER class with some content, results are
       not guaranteed.

   <b>Advice</b>
       The main point of this module was to provide a flexible method of extracting tabular information from
       HTML documents without relying to heavily on the document layout. For that reason, I suggest using
       <u>Headers</u> whenever possible -- that way, you are anchoring your extraction on what the document is trying
       to communicate rather than some feature of the HTML comprising the document (other than the fact that the
       data is contained in a table).

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       The following are the top-level methods of the HTML::TableExtract object. Tables that have matched a
       query are actually returned as separate objects of type HTML::TableExtract::Table. These table objects
       have their own methods, documented further below.

   <b>CONSTRUCTOR</b>
       <b>new()</b>
           Return a new HTML::TableExtract object. Valid attributes are:

           headers
               Passed  as  an  array reference, headers specify strings of interest at the top of columns within
               targeted tables. They can be either strings or regular expressions (qr//). If they  are  strings,
               they  will  eventually  be passed through a non-anchored, case-insensitive regular expression, so
               regexp special characters are allowed.

               The table row containing the headers is <b>not</b> returned, unless "keep_headers" was specified or  you
               are extracting into an element tree. In either case the header row can be accessed via the <b>hrow()</b>
               method from within the table object.

               Columns  that  are not beneath one of the provided headers will be ignored unless "slice_columns"
               was set to 0. Columns will, by default, be rearranged into the same  order  as  the  headers  you
               provide (see the <u>automap</u> parameter for more information) <u>unless</u> "slice_columns" is 0.

               Additionally,  by  default columns are considered what you would see visually beneath that header
               when the table is rendered in a browser.  See the "gridmap" parameter for more information.

               HTML within a header is stripped before the match is attempted, unless the "keep_html"  parameter
               was specified and "strip_html_on_match" is false.

           depth
               Specify  how embedded in other tables your tables of interest should be.  Top-level tables in the
               HTML document have a depth of 0, tables within top-level tables have a depth of 1, and so on.

           count
               Specify which table within each depth you are interested in, beginning with 0.

           attribs
               Passed as a hash reference, attribs specify attributes of interest within the  HTML  &lt;table&gt;  tag
               itself.

           automap
               Automatically  applies the ordering reported by <b>column_map()</b> to the rows returned by <b>rows()</b>. This
               only makes a difference if you have specified <u>Headers</u> and they turn out  to  be  in  a  different
               order  in the table than what you specified. Automap will rearrange the columns in the same order
               as the headers appear. To get the original ordering, you will need to take another slice of  each
               row using <b>column_map()</b>. <u>automap</u> is enabled by default.

           slice_columns
               Enabled  by default, this option controls whether vertical slices are returned from under headers
               that match. When disabled, all columns of the matching table are retained, regardles  of  whether
               they had a matching header above them. Disabling this also disables "automap".

           keep_headers
               Disabled   by  default,  and  only  applicable  when  header  constraints  have  been  specified,
               "keep_headers" will retain the matching header row as the first row of table data  when  enabled.
               This  option  has no effect if extracting into an element tree structure. In any case, the header
               row is accessible from the table method "hrow()".

           gridmap
               Controls whether the table contents are returned as a grid or a tree.  ROWSPAN and COLSPAN issues
               are compensated for, and columns really are columns. Empty phantom cells are created  where  they
               would  have  been  obscured  by  ROWSPAN  or  COLSPAN settings. This really becomes an issue when
               extracting columns beneath headers. Enabled by default.

           subtables
               Extract all tables embedded within matched tables.

           decode
               Automatically decode retrieved text with <b>HTML::Entities::decode_entities()</b>. Enabled  by  default.
               Has no effect if "keep_html" was specified or if extracting into an element tree structure.

           br_translate
               Translate  &lt;br&gt; tags into newlines. Sometimes the remaining text can be hard to parse if the &lt;br&gt;
               tag is simply dropped. Enabled by default. Has no effect if <u>keep_html</u> is enabled or if extracting
               into an element tree structure.

           keep_html
               Return the raw HTML contained in the cell, rather than just the visible text. Embedded tables are
               <b>not</b> retained in the HTML extracted from a cell.  Patterns  for  header  matches  must  take  into
               account  HTML  in  the  string if this option is enabled. This option has no effect if extracting
               into an elment tree structure.

           strip_html_on_match
               When "keep_html" is enabled, HTML is stripped by  default  during  attempts  at  matching  header
               strings (so if "strip_html_on_match" is not enabled and "keep_html" is, you would have to include
               potential  HTML tags in the regexp for header matches). Stripped header tags are replaced with an
               empty string, e.g. 'hot d&lt;em&gt;og&lt;/em&gt;' would become 'hot dog' before attempting a match.

           error_handle
               Filehandle where error messages are printed. STDERR by default.

           debug
               Prints some debugging information to STDERR, more  for  higher  values.   If  "error_handle"  was
               provided, messages are printed there rather than STDERR.

   <b>REGULAR</b> <b>METHODS</b>
       The following methods are invoked directly from an HTML::TableExtract object.

       <b>depths()</b>
           Returns all depths that contained matched tables in the document.

       counts($depth)
           For a particular depth, returns all counts that contained matched tables.

       table($depth, $count)
           For a particular depth and count, return the table object for the table found, if any.

       <b>tables()</b>
           Return table objects for all tables that matched. Returns an empty list if no tables matched.

       <b>first_table_found()</b>
           Return the table state object for the first table matched in the document. Returns undef if no tables
           were matched.

       <b>current_table()</b>
           Returns  the  current  table object while parsing the HTML. Only useful if you're messing around with
           overriding HTML::Parser methods.

       <b>tree()</b>
           If the module was invoked in tree extraction mode, returns  a  reference  to  the  top  node  of  the
           HTML::Element  tree  structure for the entire document (which includes, ultimately, all tables within
           the document).

       tables_report([$show_content, $col_sep])
           Return a string summarizing extracted tables, along with their depth and count.  Optionally  takes  a
           $show_content  flag  which  will  dump  the  extracted  contents  of  each table as well with columns
           separated by $col_sep. Default $col_sep is ':'.

       tables_dump([$show_content, $col_sep])
           Same as "tables_report()" except dump the information to STDOUT.

       start
       end
       text
           These are the hooks into HTML::Parser. If you want to subclass this module and have things work,  you
           must at some point call these with content.

   <b>DEPRECATED</b> <b>METHODS</b>
       Tables  used  to  be  called  'table states'. Accordingly, the following methods still work but have been
       deprecated:

       <b>table_state()</b>
           Is now <b>table()</b>

       <b>table_states()</b>
           Is now <b>tables()</b>

       <b>first_table_state_found()</b>
           Is now <b>first_table_found()</b>

   <b>TABLE</b> <b>METHODS</b>
       The following methods are invoked from an HTML::TableExtract::Table object, such as those  returned  from
       the "tables()" method.

       <b>rows()</b>
           Return  all  rows within a matched table. Each row returned is a reference to an array containing the
           text, HTML, or reference to the HTML::Element object of each cell depending the mode  of  extraction.
           Tables with rowspan or colspan attributes will have some cells containing undef.  Returns a list or a
           reference to an array depending on context.

       <b>columns()</b>
           Return all columns within a matched table. Each column returned is a reference to an array containing
           the  text,  HTML,  or  reference  to  HTML::Element  object  of  each  cell  depending on the mode of
           extraction.  Tables with rowspan or colspan attributes will have some cells containing undef.

       row($row)
           Return a particular row from within a matched table either as a list or an array reference, depending
           on context.

       column($col)
           Return a particular column from within a matched table as a list or an array reference, depending  on
           context.

       cell($row,$col)
           Return  a  particular item from within a matched table, whether it be the text, HTML, or reference to
           the HTML::Element object of that cell, depending on the mode of extraction. If the cell  was  covered
           due to rowspan or colspan effects, will return undef.

       space($row,$col)
           The  same  as  <b>cell()</b>,  except  in  cases  where the given coordinates were covered due to rowspan or
           colspan issues, in which case the content of the covering cell is returned rather than undef.

       <b>depth()</b>
           Return the depth at which this table was found.

       <b>count()</b>
           Return the count for this table within the depth it was found.

       <b>coords()</b>
           Return depth and count in a list.

       <b>tree()</b>
           If the module was invoked in tree  extraction  mode,  this  accessor  provides  a  reference  to  the
           HTML::ElementTable structure encompassing the table.

       <b>hrow()</b>
           Returns  the  header row as a list when headers were specified as a constraint. If "keep_headers" was
           specified initially, this is equivalent to the first row returned by the "rows()" method.

       <b>column_map()</b>
           Return the order (via indices) in which the provided headers were found.  These indices can  be  used
           as  slices on rows to either order the rows in the same order as headers or restore the rows to their
           natural order, depending on whether the rows have been pre-adjusted using the <u>automap</u> parameter.

       <b>lineage()</b>
           Returns the path of matched tables that led to matching this table. The path is a list of array  refs
           containing  depth,  count,  row,  and  column  values  for  each  ancestor  table involved. Note that
           corresponding table objects will not  exist  for  ancestral  tables  that  did  not  match  specified
           constraints.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b> <b>ON</b> <b>TREE</b> <b>EXTRACTION</b> <b>MODE</b></h4><pre>
       As  mentioned  above,  HTML::TableExtract  can  be  invoked  in  'tree' mode where the resulting HTML and
       extracted tables are encoded in HTML::Element tree structures:

         use HTML::TableExtract 'tree';

       There are a number of things to take note of while using this mode. The entire HTML document  is  encoded
       into  an HTML::Element tree. Each table is part of this structure, but nevertheless is tracked separately
       via an HTML::ElementTable structure, which is a specialized form of HTML::Element tree.

       The HTML::ElementTable objects are accessible by invoking the <b>tree()</b> method from within each table object
       returned by HTML::TableExtract. The HTML::ElementTable objects have their own <b>row()</b>,  <b>col()</b>,  and  <b>cell()</b>
       methods  (among others). These are not to be confused with the <b>row()</b> and <b>column()</b> methods provided by the
       HTML::TableExtract::Table objects.

       For example, the <b>row()</b> method from HTML::ElementTable will provide a reference to a  'glob'  of  all  the
       elements  in  that  row. Actions (such as setting attributes) performed on that row reference will affect
       all elements within that row. On the other hand, the  <b>row()</b>  method  from  the  HTML::TableExtract::Table
       object  will  return an array (either by reference or list, depending on context) of the contents of each
       cell within the row. In tree mode, the content is represented by individual references to  each  cell  --
       these are references to the same HTML::Element objects that reside in the HTML::Element tree.

       The  <b>cell()</b>  methods  provided  in  both  cases  will therefore return references to the same object. The
       exception to this is when a 'cell' in the table grid was originally 'covered' due to rowspan  or  colspan
       issues  --  in  this  case  the  cell content will be undef. Likewise, the <b>row()</b> or <b>column()</b> methods from
       HTML::TableExtract::Table  objects  will  return  arrays  potentially  containing  a  mixture  of  object
       references  and undefs.  If you're going to be doing lots of manipulation of the table elements, it might
       be more efficient to access them via the methods provided by the HTML::ElementTable object  instead.  See
       HTML::ElementTable for more information on how to manipulate those objects.

       An  alternative  to  the  <b>cell()</b> method in HTML::TableExtract::Table is the <b>space()</b> method. It is largely
       similar to <b>cell()</b>, except when given coordinates of a cell that was covered due  to  rowspan  or  colspan
       effects,  it  will return the contents of the cell that was covering that space rather than undef. So if,
       for example, cell (0,0) had a rowspan of 2 and colspan of 2, cell(1,1) would return undef and  space(1,1)
       would return the same content as cell(0,0) or space(0,0).
