</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       VUser::Google::ApiProtocol - Base class for implementation of the Google APIs

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       This class is not meant to be used directly. Instead use VUser::Google::ApiProtocol::V2_0.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
</pre><h4><b>MEMBERS</b></h4><pre>
       These are the members of the ApiProtocol class. You get and set the values by using the method of the
       same name. For example:

        # Get the domain from the ApiProtocol object
        my $domain = $google-&gt;domain;

        # Set the domain
        $google-&gt;domain('myappsdomain.com');

       Most of the member can be set when the object is created with "new()".

        my $google = VUser::ApiProtocol-&gt;new(
            domain =&gt; 'myappsdomain.com'
        );

       <b>Note:</b> VUser::Google::ApiProtocol is not meant to be used directly.  Please see the version specific
       subclasses, such as VUser::Google::ApiProtocol::V2_0, to create a usable object.

   <b>Read-write</b> <b>Members</b>
       admin
           The  administrative  user.  This  user must have be set as an admin in the Google Apps control panel.
           Also, be sure to log into the Google Apps control panel once with this user  to  accept  all  of  the
           legal garbage or you will see intermittent auth errors.

       debug
           Turn on debugging output.

       domain
           The Google Apps domain to work on.

       password
           The plain text password of the admin user.

       refresh_token
           If set to a true value, "Login()" will refresh the authentication token even if it's not necessary.

   <b>Read-only</b> <b>members</b>
       authtime
           The unix timestamp of the last authentication.

       authtoken
           The authentication token retrieved from Google on a successful login.  The token is only valid for 24
           hours.

       reply_headers
           The HTTP headers of the last reply

       reply_content
           The HTTP content of the last reply

       result
           The resulting hash from the last reply data as parsed by XML::Simple

       useragent
           The   user  agent  VUser::Google::ApiProtocol  uses  when  talking  to  Google.  It  is  set  to  the
           <u>classname/version</u>. For example, <u>VUser::Google::ApiProtocol::V2_0/0.25</u>.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>new</b> <b>(%defaults)</b>
       Create a new ApiProtocol object. Any read-write member may be set in the call to "new()".

   <b>Login</b>
       Login to the Google API. "Login()" takes no parameters. Instead, you must set the "domain", "admin",  and
       "password" members, then call "Login()".

       "Login()" will use the existing authentication token if it exists and hasn't yet timed out. You may force
       it to do a full re-authentication by setting "refresh_token" to a true value before calling "Login()".

   <b>IsAuthenticated</b>
       Returns  true if the <b>object</b> thinks that it has already authenticated and the token hasn't timed out and a
       false value otherwise.

       <b>Note:</b> "IsAuthenticated()" only knows if there's an authtoken and if it's still fresh. It may be  possible
       for Google to decide that a token is not valid which "IsAuthenticated()" cannot check.

   <b>Request</b> <b>($method,</b> <b>$url[,</b> <b>$body])</b>
       Sends an API request to Google.

       $method  is  the  HTTP  method  to  use,  e.g.  <u>GET</u>, <u>POST</u>, etc. <b>Note:</b> Many of the API calls use different
       methods. Double check the API docs to make sure you are using the correct method.

       $url is the url to use to make the API call. The URLs are defined in the API docs.

       $body is the XML specific action. Again, see the API docs for the specific  format  for  each  API  call.
       $body is not needed when the method is <u>GET</u> or <u>DELETE</u>.

   <b>dprint</b> <b>($message)</b>
       Prints $message to STDERR if "debug" is set to a true value.
