</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       LWP::Authen::OAuth2::ServiceProvider::Google - Google OAuth2

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 0.20

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       See LWP::Authen::OAuth2 for basic usage.  The one general note is that "scope" is "scope" is optional in
       the specification, but required for Google.  Beyond that Google supports many client types, and their
       behavior varies widely.

       See &lt;https://developers.google.com/accounts/docs/OAuth2&gt; for Google's own documentation.  The
       documentation here is a Cliff Notes version of that, so look there for any necessary clarification.

</pre><h4><b>REGISTERING</b></h4><pre>
       Before you can use OAuth 2 with Google you need to register yourself as a client.  For that, go to
       &lt;https://code.google.com/apis/console&gt;.  Follow their directions to create a project, choose your "flow"
       (which is called your "client_type" in this document - look ahead for advice on available types), and
       then you'll be given a "client_id" and "client_secret".  If you're in the Login, WebServer or Client
       client types you'll also need to register a "redirect_uri" with them, which will need to be an
       "https://..." URL under your control.

       At that point you have all of the facts that you need to use this module.  Be sure to keep your
       "client_secret" secret - if someone else gets it and starts abusing it, Google reserves the right to
       block you.

       This module only handles the authorization step, after which it is up to you to figure out how to use
       whatever API you want to access.

</pre><h4><b>CLIENT</b> <b>TYPES</b></h4><pre>
       Google offers many client types.  Here is the status of each one in this module:

       Login
           This    is    for    applications   that   want   to   let   Google   manage   their   logins.    See
           &lt;https://developers.google.com/accounts/docs/OAuth2Login&gt; for Google's documentation.

           This is not yet supported, and would require the use of JSON Web Tokens to support.

       Web Server Application
           This is intended for applications running on web servers, with the  user  sitting  behind  a  browser
           interacting with you.  See &lt;https://developers.google.com/accounts/docs/OAuth2WebServer&gt; for Google's
           documentation.

           It can be specified in the constructor with:

               client_type =&gt; "web server",

           however that is not necessary since it is also the assumed default if no client_type is specified.

           After registering yourself as a client with Google, you will need to specify the "redirect_uri" as an
           https  URL  under  your  control.   If you just need this for one or two accounts there is no need to
           actually build anything at that URL - just go through the authorization as those  accounts  and  grab
           your "code" from the URL.  If you will support many, making that URL useful is your responsibility.

           With  this  client  type  you are not guaranteed a refresh token, so the constructor does not require
           "client_id" and "client_secret".  (Passing them there is still likely  to  be  convenient  for  you.)
           However  there are several optional arguments available to "$oauth2-&gt;authorization_url(...)" that are
           worth taking note of:

           "access_type"
               Pass "access_type =&gt; "offline"," to "$oauth2-"request_tokens(...)&gt;  to  request  offline  access.
               This  means  that you get a "refresh_token" which can be used to refresh the access token without
               help from the user.  The intent of this option is to support things  like  software  that  delays
               posting a blog entry until a particular time.

               In  light  testing  this did not work for me until I passed the next argument, but then it worked
               perfectly.

           "approval_prompt"
               Pass "approval_prompt =&gt; "force"," to "$oauth2-"request_tokens(...)&gt; to force the user to see the
               approval screen.  The default behavior without this is that the user sees the approval screen the
               first time through, and on subsequent times just gets an immediate redirect.

           "login_hint"
               If you think you know who the user is, you can pass an email in this parameter to let Google know
               which account you are trying to access.  Google thinks this may be helpful if someone  is  logged
               into multiple accounts at the same time.

       Client-side Application
           This       client       type       is      only      for      JavaScript      applications.       See
           &lt;https://developers.google.com/accounts/docs/OAuth2UserAgent&gt; for Google's documentation.

           This is not supported since Perl is not JavaScript.

       Installed Application
           This client type is for applications that run on the user's machine, which  can  control  a  browser.
           See &lt;https://developers.google.com/accounts/docs/OAuth2InstalledApp&gt; for Google's documentation.

           It can be specified in the constructor with:

               client_type =&gt; "installed",

           On  the  first  time  it  is  the  client's  responsibility  to  open  a browser and send the user to
           "$oauth2-"authorization_url(...)&gt;.  If you pass in "redirect_uri =&gt;  "<a href="http://localhost">http://localhost</a>:$port","  then
           your  application  is expected to be listening on that port.  If you instead pass in "redirect_uri =&gt;
           "urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob"," then the code you need will be in the "title" inside of  the  page  the
           browser is redirected to, and you'll need to grab it from there.

           The  returned  tokens  always  give you a refresh token, so you only have to go through this once per
           user.

           The only special authorization argument is "login_hint", which means the same thing that it does  for
           webserver applications.

       Devices
           This  client_type is for applications that run on the user's machine, which do not control a browser.
           See &lt;https://developers.google.com/accounts/docs/OAuth2ForDevices&gt; for Google's documentation.

           This client_type is not supported because I have not yet thought through how to handle  the  required
           polling step of setting up permissions.

       Service Account
           This  client_type  is  for  applications  that login to the developer's account using the developer's
           credentials.   See  &lt;https://developers.google.com/accounts/docs/OAuth2ServiceAccount&gt;  for  Google's
           documentation.

           This is not yet supported, and would require the use of JSON Web Tokens to support.
