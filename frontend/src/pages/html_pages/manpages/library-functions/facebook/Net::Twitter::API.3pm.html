       Net::Twitter::API - Moose sugar for defining Twitter API methods

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 4.01043

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         package My::Twitter::API;
         use Moose::Role;
         use Net::Twitter::API;

         use namespace::autoclean;

         has apiurl =&gt; ( isa =&gt; 'Str', is =&gt; 'rw', default =&gt; '<a href="http://twitter.com">http://twitter.com</a>' );

         twitter_api_method friends_timeline =&gt; (
             description =&gt; &lt;&lt;'',
         Returns the 20 most recent statuses posted by the authenticating user
         and that user's friends. This is the equivalent of <a href="file:/home">/home</a> on the Web.

             aliases   =&gt; [qw/following_timeline/],
             path      =&gt; 'statuses/friends_timeline',
             method    =&gt; 'GET',

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module provides some Moose sugar for defining Twitter API methods.  It is part of the Net-Twitter
       distribution on CPAN and is used by "Net::Twitter::API::RESTv1_1", "Net::Twitter::API::Search", and
       perhaps others.

       It's intent is to make maintaining "Net::Twitter" as easy as possible.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       base_url
           Specifies, by name, the attribute which contains the base URL for the defined API.

       twitter_api_method
           Defines a Twitter API method.  Valid arguments are:

           authenticate
               Specifies whether, by default, API methods calls should authenticate.

           datetime_parser
               Specifies  the  Date::Time::Format  derived parser to use for parsing and formatting date strings
               for the API being defined.

           description
               A string describing the method, suitable for documentation.

           aliases
               An ARRAY ref of strings containing alternate names for the method.

           path
               A string containing the path part of the API URL

           path_suffix
               A string containing an additional suffix to append to the path (for legacy reasons).  If you want
               to suffix appended, pass the empty string.  Defaults to ".json".

           method
               A string containing the HTTP method for the call.  Defaults to "GET".

           add_source
               A boolean, indicating whether or not the "source" parameter should be  added  to  the  API  call.
               (The source value is assigned by Twitter for registered applications.)  Defaults to 0.

           params
               An ARRAY ref of strings naming all of the valid parameters.  Defaults to an empty ARRAY ref.

           required
               An ARRAY ref of strings naming all of the required parameters.  Defaults to an empty ARRAY ref.

           returns
               A string describing the return type of the API method call.

           deprecated
               A  boolean  indicating  whether  or not this API is deprecated.  If set to 1, code for the method
               will be created.  This option is optional, and is used by  the  "Net-Twitter"  distribution  when
               generating documentation.  It defaults to 0.
