       Tree::Simple::Visitor::CreateDirectoryTree - A Visitor for create a set of directories and files from a
       Tree::Simple object

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Tree::Simple::Visitor::CreateDirectoryTree;

         # create a Tree::Simple object which
         # represents a directory hierarchy
         my $tree = Tree::Simple-&gt;new("www/")
                           -&gt;addChildren(
                               Tree::Simple-&gt;new("conf/")
                                   -&gt;addChildren(
                                       Tree::Simple-&gt;new("startup.pl"),
                                       Tree::Simple-&gt;new("httpd.conf")
                                   ),
                               Tree::Simple-&gt;new("cgi-bin/"),
                               Tree::Simple-&gt;new("ht_docs/"),
                               Tree::Simple-&gt;new("logs/")
                                   -&gt;addChildren(
                                       Tree::Simple-&gt;new("error.log"),
                                       Tree::Simple-&gt;new("access.log")
                                   ),
                           );

         # create an instance of our visitor
         my $visitor = Tree::Simple::Visitor::CreateDirectoryTree-&gt;new();

         # pass the visitor to a Tree::Simple object
         $tree-&gt;accept($visitor);

         # the www/ directory now mirrors the structure of the tree

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This visitor can be used to create a set of directories and files from a Tree::Simple object hierarchy.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>new</b> There  are  no  arguments to the constructor the object will be in its default state. You can use the
           "setNodeFilter", "setFileHandler" and "setDirectoryHandler" methods to customize its behavior.

       <b>setNodeFilter</b> <b>($filter_function)</b>
           This method accepts a CODE reference as its $filter_function argument and throws an exception  if  it
           is  not  a  code  reference. This code reference is used to filter the tree nodes as they are used to
           create the directory tree, it can be basically used as a node pre-processor. An example usage of this
           might be to enforce the 8.3 naming rules of DOS, or the 32 character limit of older macintoshes.

       <b>setFileHandler</b> <b>($file_handler)</b>
           This method accepts a CODE reference as its $file_handler argument and throws an exception if  it  is
           not  a  CODE reference. This method can be used to create custom file creation behavior.  The default
           behavior is to just create the file and nothing else, but by using this  method  it  is  possible  to
           implement  some  other custom behavior, such as creating a file based on a template.  The function is
           passed the full path of the file to be created (as built by File::Spec).

       <b>setDirectoryHandler</b> <b>($dir_handler)</b>
           This method accepts a CODE reference as its $dir_handler argument and throws an exception  if  it  is
           not  a  CODE  reference.  This  method can be used to create custom directory creation behavior.  The
           default behavior is to just create the directory and nothing else, but by using  this  method  it  is
           possible  to  implement  some other custom behavior, such as creating a directory on a remote server.
           The function is passed the full path of the directory to be created (as built by File::Spec).

       <b>visit</b> <b>($tree)</b>
           This is the method that is used by the Tree::Simple "accept" method. It can also be used on its  own,
           it  requires  the $tree argument to be a Tree::Simple object (or derived from a Tree::Simple object),
           and will throw and exception otherwise.

           The tree is processed as follows:

           Any node which is not a leaf is considered a directory.
               Obviously since files themselves are leaf  nodes,  this  makes  sense  that  non-leaves  will  be
               directories.

           Any node (including leaf nodes) which ends in either the character "/" or "\" is considered a
           directory.
               I  think  it  is  a pretty standard convention to have directory names ending in a separator. The
               separator itself is stripped off before the directory name is  passed  to  File::Spec  where  the
               platform  specific  directory  path  is created. This means that it does not matter which one you
               use, it will be completely cross platform (at least as cross-platform as File::Spec is).

           All other nodes are considered to be files.
