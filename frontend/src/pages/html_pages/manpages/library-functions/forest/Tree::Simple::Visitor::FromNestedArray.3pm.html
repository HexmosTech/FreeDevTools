</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Tree::Simple::Visitor::FromNestedArray - A Visitor for creating Tree::Simple objects from nested array
       trees.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Tree::Simple::Visitor::FromNestedArray;

         my $visitor = Tree::Simple::Visitor::FromNestedArray-&gt;new();

         # given this nested array tree
         my $array_tree = [
                           'Root', [
                               'Child1', [
                                       'GrandChild1',
                                       'GrandChild2'
                                       ],
                               'Child2'
                               ]
                           ];
         # set the array tree we
         # are going to convert
         $visitor-&gt;setArrayTree($array_tree);

         $tree-&gt;accept($visitor);

         # this then creates the equivalent Tree::Simple object:
         # Tree::Simple-&gt;new("Root")
         #     -&gt;addChildren(
         #         Tree::Simple-&gt;new("Child1")
         #             -&gt;addChildren(
         #                 Tree::Simple-&gt;new("GrandChild1"),
         #                 Tree::Simple-&gt;new("GrandChild2")
         #             ),
         #         Tree::Simple-&gt;new("Child2"),
         #     );

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Given a tree constructed from nested arrays, this Visitor will create the equivalent Tree::Simple
       hierarchy.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>new</b> There  are  no  arguments to the constructor the object will be in its default state. You can use the
           "setNodeFilter", "includTrunk" and "setArrayTree" methods to customize its behavior.

       <b>includTrunk</b> <b>($boolean)</b>
           Setting the $boolean value to true (1) will cause the node value of  the  $tree  object  passed  into
           "visit"  to  be  set  with  the  root value found in the $array_tree. Setting it to false (0), or not
           setting it, will result in the first value in the $array_tree creating a new node level.

       <b>setNodeFilter</b> <b>($filter_function)</b>
           This method accepts a CODE reference as its $filter_function argument and throws an exception  if  it
           is  not  a  code reference. This code reference is used to filter the tree nodes as they are created,
           the $filter_function is passed the node value extracted from the array prior  to  it  being  inserted
           into the tree being built. The $filter_function is expected to return the value desired for inclusion
           into the tree.

       <b>setArrayTree</b> <b>($array_tree)</b>
           This  method is used to set the $array_tree that our Tree::Simple hierarchy will be constructed from.
           It must be in the following form:

             [
               'Root', [
                   'Child1', [
                         'GrandChild1',
                         'GrandChild2'
                         ],
                   'Child2'
                 ]
             ]

           Basically each element in the array is considered a node, unless it is an array reference,  in  which
           case  it  is  interpreted as containing the children of the node created from the previous element in
           the array.

           The tree is validated prior being accepted, if it fails validation an exception will be  thrown.  The
           rules are as follows;

           The array tree must not be empty.
               It  makes  not  sense  to  create  a tree out of nothing, so it is assumed that this is a sign of
               something wrong.

           All nodes of the array tree must not be array references.
               The root node is validated against this in this function, but all subsequent nodes are checked as
               the tree is built. Any nodes found to be array  references  are  rejected  and  an  exception  is
               thrown.  If  you  desire  your node values to be array references, you can use the node filtering
               mechanism to achieve this as the node is filtered <u>after</u> it is validated.

           The array tree must be a single rooted tree.
               If there is a second element in the array tree, it is assumed to be the children of the root, and
               therefore must be in the form of an array reference.

       <b>visit</b> <b>($tree)</b>
           This is the method that is used by the Tree::Simple "accept" method. It can also be used on its  own,
           it  requires  the $tree argument to be a Tree::Simple object (or derived from a Tree::Simple object),
           and will throw and exception otherwise.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       None that I am aware of. Of course, if you find a bug, let me know, and I will be sure to fix it.

</pre><h4><b>CODE</b> <b>COVERAGE</b></h4><pre>
       See the <b>CODE</b> <b>COVERAGE</b> section in Tree::Simple::VisitorFactory for more information.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       These Visitor classes are all subclasses of <b>Tree::Simple::Visitor</b>, which can be found in the <b>Tree::Simple</b>
       module, you should refer to that module for more information.
