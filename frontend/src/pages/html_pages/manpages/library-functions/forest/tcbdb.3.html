       tcbdb - the B+ tree database API

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       B+ tree database is a file containing a B+ tree and is handled with the B+ tree database API.

       To  use  the  B+  tree  database  API,  include `<b>tcutil.h</b>', `<b>tcbdb.h</b>', and related standard header files.
       Usually, write the following description near the front of a source file.

              <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;tcutil.h&gt;</b>
              <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;tcbdb.h&gt;</b>
              <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/stdlib.h">stdlib.h</a>&gt;</b>
              <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/time.h">time.h</a>&gt;</b>
              <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;stdbool.h&gt;</b>
              <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/stdint.h">stdint.h</a>&gt;</b>

       Objects whose type is pointer to `<b>TCBDB</b>' are used to handle B+ tree databases.  A B+ tree database object
       is created with the function `<b>tcbdbnew</b>' and is deleted with the function  `<b>tcbdbdel</b>'.   To  avoid  memory
       leak, it is important to delete every object when it is no longer in use.

       Before  operations  to store or retrieve records, it is necessary to open a database file and connect the
       B+ tree database object to it.  The function `<b>tcbdbopen</b>' is used to open a database file and the function
       `<b>tcbdbclose</b>' is used to close the database file.  To avoid data missing or corruption, it is important to
       close every database file when it is no longer in use.  It is forbidden for multiple database objects  in
       a process to open the same database at the same time.

</pre><h4><b>API</b></h4><pre>
       The function `tcbdberrmsg' is used in order to get the message string corresponding to an error code.

              <b>const</b> <b>char</b> <b>*tcbdberrmsg(int</b> <u>ecode</u><b>);</b>
                     `<u>ecode</u>' specifies the error code.
                     The return value is the message string of the error code.

       The function `tcbdbnew' is used in order to create a B+ tree database object.

              <b>TCBDB</b> <b>*tcbdbnew(void);</b>
                     The return value is the new B+ tree database object.

       The function `tcbdbdel' is used in order to delete a B+ tree database object.

              <b>void</b> <b>tcbdbdel(TCBDB</b> <b>*</b><u>bdb</u><b>);</b>
                     `<u>bdb</u>' specifies the B+ tree database object.
                     If  the  database is not closed, it is closed implicitly.  Note that the deleted object and
                     its derivatives can not be used anymore.

       The function `tcbdbecode' is used in order to get the last happened error code  of  a  B+  tree  database
       object.

              <b>int</b> <b>tcbdbecode(TCBDB</b> <b>*</b><u>bdb</u><b>);</b>
                     `<u>bdb</u>' specifies the B+ tree database object.
                     The return value is the last happened error code.
                     The  following error codes are defined: `TCESUCCESS' for success, `TCETHREAD' for threading
                     error, `TCEINVALID' for invalid operation, `TCENOFILE' for file not found, `TCENOPERM'  for
                     no  permission,  `TCEMETA'  for  invalid  meta  data, `TCERHEAD' for invalid record header,
                     `TCEOPEN' for open error, `TCECLOSE' for close error, `TCETRUNC' for trunc error, `TCESYNC'

                     `TCEUNLINK' for unlink error, `TCERENAME' for rename error,  `TCEMKDIR'  for  mkdir  error,
                     `TCERMDIR'  for rmdir error, `TCEKEEP' for existing record, `TCENOREC' for no record found,
                     and `TCEMISC' for miscellaneous error.

       The function `tcbdbsetmutex' is used in order to set mutual exclusion  control  of  a  B+  tree  database
       object for threading.

              <b>bool</b> <b>tcbdbsetmutex(TCBDB</b> <b>*</b><u>bdb</u><b>);</b>
                     `<u>bdb</u>' specifies the B+ tree database object which is not opened.
                     If successful, the return value is true, else, it is false.
                     Note that the mutual exclusion control of the database should be set before the database is
                     opened.

       The  function  `tcbdbsetcmpfunc'  is  used  in  order  to set the custom comparison function of a B+ tree
       database object.

              <b>bool</b> <b>tcbdbsetcmpfunc(TCBDB</b> <b>*</b><u>bdb</u><b>,</b> <b>TCCMP</b> <u>cmp</u><b>,</b> <b>void</b> <b>*</b><u>cmpop</u><b>);</b>
                     `<u>bdb</u>' specifies the B+ tree database object which is not opened.
                     `<u>cmp</u>'  specifies  the  pointer  to  the  custom  comparison  function.   It  receives  five
                     parameters.   The  first  parameter  is  the  pointer to the region of one key.  The second
                     parameter is the size of the region of one key.  The third parameter is the pointer to  the
                     region  of the other key.  The fourth parameter is the size of the region of the other key.
                     The fifth parameter is the pointer to the optional opaque object.  It returns  positive  if
                     the former is big, negative if the latter is big, 0 if both are equivalent.
                     `<u>cmpop</u>'  specifies  an  arbitrary  pointer  to  be  given  as a parameter of the comparison
                     function.  If it is not needed, `NULL' can be specified.
                     If successful, the return value is true, else, it is false.
                     The default comparison function compares  keys  of  two  records  by  lexical  order.   The
                     functions  `tccmplexical'  (default),  `tccmpdecimal',  `tccmpint32',  and `tccmpint64' are
                     built-in.  Note that the comparison function should be set before the database  is  opened.
                     Moreover,  user-defined comparison functions should be set every time the database is being
                     opened.

       The function `tcbdbtune' is used in order to set the tuning parameters of a B+ tree database object.

                     default  value  is  specified.   The  default value is 16381.  Suggested size of the bucket
                     array is about from 1 to 4 times of the number of all pages to be stored.
                     `<u>apow</u>' specifies the size of record alignment by power  of  2.   If  it  is  negative,  the

                     `<u>fpow</u>'  specifies  the maximum number of elements of the free block pool by power of 2.  If
                     it is negative, the default value is specified.  The  default  value  is  10  standing  for
                     2^10=1024.
                     `<u>opts</u>' specifies options by bitwise-or: `BDBTLARGE' specifies that the size of the database
                     can be larger than 2GB by using 64-bit bucket array, `BDBTDEFLATE' specifies that each page

                     `<u>ncnum</u>'  specifies  the  maximum  number of non-leaf nodes to be cached.  If it is not more
                     than 0, the default value is specified.  The default value is 512.
                     If successful, the return value is true, else, it is false.
                     Note that the caching parameters should be set before the database is opened.

                     be activated with a database object at the same time.   Thus,  the  serializable  isolation
                     level  is assumed if every database operation is performed in the transaction.  Because all
                     pages are cached on memory while the transaction, the amount of referred records is limited
                     by the memory capacity.  If the database is closed during transaction, the  transaction  is

                     `NULL'.  `NULL' is returned when the cursor is at invalid position.
                     Because an additional zero code is appended at the end of the region of the  return  value,
                     the  return  value  can be treated as a character string.  Because the region of the return

                     value is assigned.
                     If successful, the return value is the pointer to the region of  the  value,  else,  it  is
                     `NULL'.  `NULL' is returned when the cursor is at invalid position.
                     Because  an  additional zero code is appended at the end of the region of the return value,
                     the return value can be treated as a character string.  Because the region  of  the  return
                     value  is  volatile  and  it  may be spoiled by another operation of the database, the data
                     should be copied into another involatile buffer immediately.

       The function `tcbdbcurrec' is used in order to get the key and the value of the record where  the  cursor
       object is.

              <b>bool</b> <b>tcbdbcurrec(BDBCUR</b> <b>*</b><u>cur</u><b>,</b> <b>TCXSTR</b> <b>*</b><u>kxstr</u><b>,</b> <b>TCXSTR</b> <b>*</b><u>vxstr</u><b>);</b>
                     `<u>cur</u>' specifies the cursor object.
                     `<u>kxstr</u>' specifies the object into which the key is wrote down.
                     `<u>vxstr</u>' specifies the object into which the value is wrote down.
                     If  successful,  the  return  value is true, else, it is false.  False is returned when the
                     cursor is at invalid position.
