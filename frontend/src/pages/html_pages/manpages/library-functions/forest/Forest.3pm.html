</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Forest - A collection of n-ary tree related modules

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Forest is intended to be a replacement for the Tree::Simple family of modules, and fixes many of the
       issues that have always bothered me about them. It is by no means a complete replacement yet, but should
       eventually grow to become that.

       For more information please refer to the individual module documentation, starting with Forest::Tree.

</pre><h4><b>TODO</b></h4><pre>
       More documentation
           This is 0.10 so it is (still) lacking quite a bit of docs (I am being really lazy sorry).  Although I
           invite people to read the source, it is quite simple really.

       More tests
           The  coverage  is  in  the  low 90s, but there is still a lot of behavioral stuff that could use some
           testing too.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       Tree::Simple
           I wrote this module a few years ago and I had served me well, but  recently  I  find  myself  getting
           frustrated with some of the uglier bits of this module. So Forest is a re-write of this module.

       Tree
           This  is  an  ambitious  project  to  replace  all  the  Tree  related  modules  with  a  single core
           implementation. There is some good code in here, but the project seems to be very much on  the  back-
           burner at this time.

       OCaml port of Forest
           Ask  me about the OCaml port of this module, it is also sitting on my hard drive waiting for release.
           It actually helped quite a bit in terms of helping me settle on the  APIs  for  this  module.  Static
           typing can be very helpful sometimes.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       All  complex  software  has bugs lurking in it, and this module is no exception. If you find a bug please
       either email me, or add the bug to cpan-RT.
