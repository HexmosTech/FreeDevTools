</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Tree::RB - Perl implementation of the Red/Black tree, a type of balanced binary search tree.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Tree::RB;

           my $tree = Tree::RB-&gt;new;
           $tree-&gt;put('France'  =&gt; 'Paris');
           $tree-&gt;put('England' =&gt; 'London');
           $tree-&gt;put('Hungary' =&gt; 'Budapest');
           $tree-&gt;put('Ireland' =&gt; 'Dublin');
           $tree-&gt;put('Egypt'   =&gt; 'Cairo');
           $tree-&gt;put('Germany' =&gt; 'Berlin');

           $tree-&gt;put('Alaska' =&gt; 'Anchorage'); # D'oh! Alaska isn't a Country
           $tree-&gt;delete('Alaska');

           print scalar $tree-&gt;get('Ireland'); # 'Dublin'

           print $tree-&gt;min-&gt;key; # 'Egypt'
           print $tree-&gt;max-&gt;key; # 'Ireland'

           print $tree-&gt;<a href="../man0/nth.0.html">nth</a>(0)-&gt;key;  # 'Egypt'
           print $tree-&gt;nth(-1)-&gt;key; # 'Ireland'

           # print items, ordered by key

               printf "key = %s, value = %s\n", $node-&gt;key, $node-&gt;val;
           }

           # print items in reverse order
           $it = $tree-&gt;rev_iter;

           while(my $node = $it-&gt;next) {
               printf "key = %s, value = %s\n", $node-&gt;key, $node-&gt;val;
           }

           # Hash interface
           tie my %capital, 'Tree::RB';

           # or do this to store items in descending order

           $capital{'France'}  = 'Paris';
           $capital{'England'} = 'London';
           $capital{'Hungary'} = 'Budapest';
           $capital{'Ireland'} = 'Dublin';
           $capital{'Egypt'}   = 'Cairo';
           $capital{'Germany'} = 'Berlin';

           # print items in order
           while(my ($key, $val) = each %capital) {

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This is a Perl implementation of the Red/Black tree, a type of balanced binary search tree.

       A tied hash interface is also provided to allow ordered hashes to be used.

       See the Wikipedia article at &lt;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-black_tree">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-black_tree</a>&gt; for further information about
       Red/Black trees.

</pre><h4><b>INTERFACE</b></h4><pre>
   <b>new([CODEREF])</b>
       Creates and returns a new tree. If a reference to a subroutine is passed to <b>new()</b>, the subroutine will be
       used to override the tree's default lexical ordering and provide a user a defined ordering.

       This subroutine should be just like a comparator subroutine used with sort, except that it doesn't do the
       $a, $b trick.

       For example, to get a case insensitive ordering

           my $tree = Tree::RB-&gt;new(sub { lc $_[0] cmp lc $_[1]});
           $tree-&gt;put('Wall'  =&gt; 'Larry');
           $tree-&gt;put('Smith' =&gt; 'Agent');
           $tree-&gt;put('mouse' =&gt; 'micky');
           $tree-&gt;put('duck'  =&gt; 'donald');

           my $it = $tree-&gt;iter;

           while(my $node = $it-&gt;next) {
               printf "key = %s, value = %s\n", $node-&gt;key, $node-&gt;val;
           }

   <b>resort(CODEREF)</b>
       Changes the ordering of nodes within the tree. The new ordering is specified by a comparator subroutine
       which must be passed to <b>resort()</b>.

       See "new" for further information about the comparator.

   <b>size()</b>
       Returns the number of nodes in the tree.

   <b>root()</b>
       Returns the root node of the tree. This will either be undef if no nodes have been added to the tree, or
       a Tree::RB::Node object.  See the Tree::RB::Node manual page for details on the Node object.

   <b>min()</b>
       Returns the node with the minimal key.

   <b>max()</b>
       Returns the node with the maximal key.

   <b>nth(INDEX)</b>
       Returns the node at the given (zero based) index, or undef if there is no node at that index. Negative
       indexes can be used, with -1 indicating the last node, -2 the penultimate node and so on.

   <b>lookup(KEY,</b> <b>[MODE])</b>
       When called in scalar context, lookup(KEY) returns the value associated with KEY.

       When called in list context, lookup(KEY) returns a list whose first element is the value associated with
       KEY, and whose second element is the node containing the key/value.

       An optional MODE parameter can be passed to <b>lookup()</b> to influence which key is returned.

       The values of MODE are constants that are exported on demand by Tree::RB

           use Tree::RB qw[LUEQUAL LUGTEQ LULTEQ LUGREAT LULESS LUNEXT LUPREV];

       LUEQUAL
           This is the default mode. Returns the node exactly matching the key, or "undef" if not found.

       LUGTEQ
           Returns  the node exactly matching the specified key, if this is not found then the next node that is
           greater than the specified key is returned.

       LULTEQ
           Returns the node exactly matching the specified key, if this is not found then the next node that  is
           less than the specified key is returned.

       LUGREAT
           Returns the node that is just greater than the specified key - not equal to.  This mode is similar to
           LUNEXT except that the specified key need not exist in the tree.

       LULESS
           Returns  the  node  that is just less than the specified key - not equal to.  This mode is similar to
           LUPREV except that the specified key need not exist in the tree.

       LUNEXT
           Looks for the key specified, if not found returns "undef".  If the node is  found  returns  the  next
           node that is greater than the one found (or "undef" if there is no next node).

           This can be used to step through the tree in order.

       LUPREV
           Looks for the key specified, if not found returns "undef".  If the node is found returns the previous
           node that is less than the one found (or "undef" if there is no previous node).

           This can be used to step through the tree in reverse order.

   <b>get(KEY)</b>
       <b>get()</b> is an alias for <b>lookup()</b>.

   <b>iter([KEY])</b>
       Returns an iterator object that can be used to traverse the tree in order.

       The  iterator  object  supports a 'next' method that returns the next node in the tree or undef if all of
       the nodes have been visited.

       See the synopsis for an example.

       If a key is supplied, the iterator returned will traverse the tree in order starting from the  node  with
       key greater than or equal to the specified key.

           $it = $tree-&gt;iter('France');
           my $node = $it-&gt;next;
           print $node-&gt;key; # -&gt; 'France'

   <b>rev_iter([KEY])</b>
       Returns an iterator object that can be used to traverse the tree in reverse order.

       If  a  key is supplied, the iterator returned will traverse the tree in order starting from the node with
       key less than or equal to the specified key.

           $it = $tree-&gt;rev_iter('France');
           my $node = $it-&gt;next;
           print $node-&gt;key; # -&gt; 'France'

           $it = $tree-&gt;rev_iter('Finland');
           my $node = $it-&gt;next;
           print $node-&gt;key; # -&gt; 'England'

   <b>hseek(KEY,</b> <b>[{-reverse</b> <b>=&gt;</b> <b>1|0}])</b>
       For tied hashes, determines the next entry to be returned by each.

           tie my %capital, 'Tree::RB';

           $capital{'France'}  = 'Paris';
           $capital{'England'} = 'London';
           $capital{'Hungary'} = 'Budapest';
           $capital{'Ireland'} = 'Dublin';
           $capital{'Egypt'}   = 'Cairo';
           $capital{'Germany'} = 'Berlin';
           tied(%capital)-&gt;hseek('Germany');

           ($key, $val) = each %capital;
           print "$key, $val"; # -&gt; Germany, Berlin

       The direction of iteration can be reversed by passing a hashref with key '-reverse' and value 1 to  hseek
       after or instead of KEY, e.g. to iterate over the hash in reverse order:

           tied(%capital)-&gt;hseek({-reverse =&gt; 1});
           $key = each %capital;
           print $key; # -&gt; Ireland

       The following calls are equivalent

           tied(%capital)-&gt;hseek('Germany', {-reverse =&gt; 1});
           tied(%capital)-&gt;hseek({-key =&gt; 'Germany', -reverse =&gt; 1});

   <b>put(KEY,</b> <b>VALUE)</b>
       Adds a new node to the tree.

       The first argument is the key of the node, the second is its value.

       If  a  node with that key already exists, its value is replaced with the given value and the old value is
       returned. Otherwise, undef is returned.

   <b>delete(KEY)</b>
       If the tree has a node with the specified key, that node is deleted from the tree and returned, otherwise
       "undef" is returned.
