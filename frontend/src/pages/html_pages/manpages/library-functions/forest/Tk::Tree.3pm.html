</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Tk::Tree - Create and manipulate Tree widgets

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           <b>use</b> <b>Tk::Tree;</b>

           <u>$tree</u> = <u>$parent</u>-&gt;<b>Tree</b>(?<u>options</u>?);

</pre><h4><b>SUPER-CLASS</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>Tree</b> class is derived from the HList class and inherits all the methods, options and subwidgets of
       its super-class.  A <b>Tree</b> widget is not scrolled by default.

</pre><h4><b>STANDARD</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Tree</b> supports all the standard options of an HList widget.  See Tk::options for details on the standard
       options.

</pre><h4><b>WIDGET-SPECIFIC</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Name:          <b>browseCmd</b>
       Class:         <b>BrowseCmd</b>
       Switch:        <b>-browsecmd</b>
           Specifies a callback to call whenever the user browses on an entry (usually by single-clicking on the
           entry). The callback is called with one argument, the pathname of the entry.

       Name:          <b>closeCmd</b>
       Class:         <b>CloseCmd</b>
       Switch:        <b>-closecmd</b>
           Specifies a callback to call whenever an entry needs to be closed (See "BINDINGS" below). This method
           is  called  with  one  argument,  the  pathname  of the entry. This method should perform appropriate
           actions to close the specified entry. If the <b>-closecmd</b> option is not specified, the  default  closing
           action is to hide all child entries of the specified entry.

       Name:          <b>command</b>
       Class:         <b>Command</b>
       Switch:        <b>-command</b>
           Specifies  a callback to call whenever the user activates an entry (usually by double-clicking on the
           entry). The callback is called with one argument, the pathname of the entry.

       Name:          <b>ignoreInvoke</b>
       Class:         <b>IgnoreInvoke</b>
       Switch:        <b>-ignoreinvoke</b>
           A Boolean value that specifies when a branch should be opened or closed.  A  branch  will  always  be
           opened  or  closed when the user presses the (+) and (-) indicators. However, when the user invokes a
           branch (by doublc-clicking or pressing &lt;Return&gt;), the  branch  will  be  opened  or  closed  only  if
           <b>-ignoreinvoke</b> is set to false (the default setting).

       Name:          <b>openCmd</b>
       Class:         <b>OpenCmd</b>
       Switch:        <b>-opencmd</b>
           Specifies a callback to call whenever an entry needs to be opened (See "BINDINGS" below). This method
           is  called  with  one  argument,  the  pathname  of the entry. This method should perform appropriate
           actions to open the specified entry. If the <b>-opencmd</b> option is not  specified,  the  default  opening
           action is to show all the child entries of the specified entry.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>Tree</b>  method  creates  a  new  window  and makes it into a Tree widget and return a reference to it.
       Additional options, described above, may be specified on the command line or in the  option  database  to
       configure aspects of the Tree widget such as its cursor and relief.

       The  Tree widget can be used to display hierarchical data in a tree form. The user can adjust the view of
       the tree by opening or closing parts of the tree.

       To display a static tree structure, you can add the entries into the Tree widget and hide any entries  as
       desired.  Then  you  can call the <b>autosetmode</b> method. This will set up the Tree widget so that it handles
       all the <u>open</u> and <u>close</u> events automatically.  the demonstration program <u>Tixish/examples/perl-tix-tree</u>).

       The above method is not applicable if you want to maintain a dynamic tree structure, i.e, you do not know
       all the entries in the tree and you need to add or delete entries subsequently. To do  this,  you  should
       first  create  the  entries in the Tree widget. Then, use the <b>setmode</b> method to indicate the entries that
       can be opened or closed, and use the <b>-opencmd</b> and <b>-closecmd</b> options to handle  the  opening  and  closing
       events. (Please see the demonstration program <u>Tixish/examples/perl-tix-dyntree</u>).

       Use either

           <u>$parent</u>-&gt;<b>Scrolled</b>(<b>'Tree'</b>, ... );

       or

           <u>$parent</u>-&gt;<b>ScrlTree</b>( ... );

       to create a scrolled <b>Tree</b>. See Tk::Scrolled for details.

</pre><h4><b>WIDGET</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>Tree</b>  method creates a widget object.  This object supports the <b>configure</b> and <b>cget</b> methods described
       in Tk::options which can be used to enquire and modify the options  described  above.   The  widget  also
       inherits all the methods provided by the generic Tk::Widget class.

       The following additional methods are available for Tree widgets:

       <u>$tree-&gt;</u><b>add_pathimage</b>(<u>treeRegExp</u> <u>[,</u> <u>openImg,</u> <u>closeImg]</u>)
           This  method  defines  images  for  a  given  path  (images  must  be in xpm format). The path can be
           determined by a simplified regular expression. There are just three metasymbols:

           ^   at the beginning of the "treeRegExp" same as in Perl regular expressions

           *   anything

           $   at the end of the "TreeRegExp", the same as in Perl regular expressions

           Examples:

             $tree-&gt;add_pathimage('^root','openfolder','folder');

           matches "root", "root.foo", "root.bar", but not "foo.root"

             $tree-&gt;add_pathimage('root.*.class','openfolder','folder');

           matches all paths containing "root.&lt;anything&gt;.class", but not "root.&lt;anything&gt;.&lt;anything&gt;.class"  "*"
           is one part of the path. If you want to use a wildcard for two steps, you have to use "*.*".

             $tree-&gt;add_pathimage('class$','openfolder','folder');

           This matches all path with "class" at the end.

       <u>$tree</u>-&gt;<b>autosetmode</b>
           This  method  calls  the  <b>setmode</b>  method for all the entries in this Tree widget: if an entry has no
           child entries, its mode is set to <b>none</b>. Otherwise, if the entry has any  hidden  child  entries,  its
           mode is set to <b>open</b>; otherwise its mode is set to <b>close</b>.

       <u>$tree-&gt;</u><b>child_entries</b>([$path][,$depth])
           This  method  returns  in  list context an array that contains all pathnames of subentries within the
           given path. In scalar context it returns the number of subentries in the given path.

             Example:
               root
                | foo
                | bar
                |  | bar1
                |  | bar2

             my @childentries = $tree-&gt;child_entries('root.bar');
             # returns (root.bar.bar1, root.bar.bar2)

             my $nr_of_subentries = $tree-&gt;child_entries('root',2);
             # returns 4

           If $path is omitted, all it is assumed, that the entry above 'root'  is  meant.  $depth  defines  the
           numbers of levels.

       <u>$tree</u>-&gt;<b>close</b>(<u>entryPath</u>)
           Close the entry given by <u>entryPath</u> if its <u>mode</u> is <b>close</b>.

       <u>$tree</u>-&gt;<b>getmode</b>(<u>entryPath</u>)
           Returns the current <u>mode</u> of the entry given by <u>entryPath</u>.

       <u>$tree</u>-&gt;<b>open</b>(<u>entryPath</u>)
           Open the entry given by <u>entryPath</u> if its <u>mode</u> is <b>open</b>.

       <u>$tree</u>-&gt;<b>setmode</b>(<u>entryPath,</u> <u>mode</u>)
           This method is used to indicate whether the entry given by <u>entryPath</u> has children entries and whether
           the  children  are  visible.  <u>mode</u>  must be one of <b>open</b>, <b>close</b> or <b>none</b>. If <u>mode</u> is set to <b>open</b>, a (+)
           indicator is drawn next to the entry. If <u>mode</u> is set to <b>close</b>, a (-) indicator is drawn next  to  the
           entry.  If <u>mode</u> is set to <b>none</b>, no indicators will be drawn for this entry. The default <u>mode</u> is none.
           The <b>open</b> mode indicates the entry has hidden children and this entry can be opened by the  user.  The
           <b>close</b>  mode  indicates that all the children of the entry are now visible and the entry can be closed
           by the user.

</pre><h4><b>BINDINGS</b></h4><pre>
       The basic mouse and keyboard bindings of the Tree widget are the  same  as  the  bindings  of  the  HList
       widget.  In addition, the entries can be opened or closed under the following conditions:

       [1] If the <u>mode</u> of the entry is <b>open</b>, it can be opened by clicking on its (+) indicator.

       [2] If the <u>mode</u> of the entry is <b>close</b>, it can be closed by clicking on its (-) indicator.
