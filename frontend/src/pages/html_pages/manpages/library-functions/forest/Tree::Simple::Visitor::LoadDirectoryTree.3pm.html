</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Tree::Simple::Visitor::LoadDirectoryTree - A Visitor for loading the contents of a directory into a
       Tree::Simple object

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Tree::Simple::Visitor::LoadDirectoryTree;

         # create a Tree::Simple object whose
         # node is path to a directory
         my $tree = Tree::Simple-&gt;new("./");

         # create an instance of our visitor
         my $visitor = Tree::Simple::Visitor::LoadDirectoryTree-&gt;new();

         # set the directory sorting style
         $visitor-&gt;setSortStyle($visitor-&gt;SORT_FILES_FIRST);

         # create node filter to filter
         # out certain files and directories
         $visitor-&gt;setNodeFilter(sub {
             my ($item) = @_;
             return 0 if $item =~ /CVS/;
             return 1;
         });

         # pass the visitor to a Tree::Simple object
         $tree-&gt;accept($visitor);

         # the tree now mirrors the structure of the directory

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This visitor can be used to load a directory tree into a Tree::Simple hierarchy.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>new</b> There  are  no  arguments to the constructor the object will be in its default state. You can use the
           "setNodeFilter" and "setSortStyle" methods to customize its behavior.

       <b>setNodeFilter</b> <b>($filter_function)</b>
           This method accepts a CODE reference as its $filter_function argument and throws an exception  if  it
           is  not  a  code reference. This code reference is used to filter the tree nodes as they are created.
           The function is given the current directory or file being added to the tree, and it  is  expected  to
           return  either true (1) of false (0) to determine if that directory should be traversed or file added
           to the tree.

       <b>setSortStyle</b> <b>($sort_function)</b>
           This method accepts a CODE reference as its $sort_function argument and throws an exception if it  is
           not a code reference. This function is used to sort the individual levels of the directory tree right
           before  it is added to the tree being built. The function is passed the current path, followed by the
           two items being sorted. The reason for passing the path in is  so  that  sorting  operations  can  be
           performed on the entire path if desired.

           Two pre-built functions are supplied and described below.

           <b>SORT_FILES_FIRST</b>
               This sorting function will sort files before directories, so that files are sorted alphabetically
               first  in  the  list  followed  by directories sorted alphabetically. Here is example of how that
               would look:

                   Tree/
                       Simple.pm
                       Simple/
                           Visitor.pm
                           VisitorFactory.pm
                           Visitor/
                               PathToRoot.pm

           <b>SORT_DIRS_FIRST</b>
               This sorting function will  sort  directories  before  files,  so  that  directories  are  sorted
               alphabetically  first in the list followed by files sorted alphabetically. Here is example of how
               that would look:

                   Tree/
                       Simple/
                           Visitor/
                               PathToRoot.pm
                           Visitor.pm
                           VisitorFactory.pm
                       Simple.pm

       <b>visit</b> <b>($tree)</b>
           This is the method that is used by the Tree::Simple "accept" method. It can also be used on its  own,
           it  requires  the $tree argument to be a Tree::Simple object (or derived from a Tree::Simple object),
           and will throw and exception otherwise.

           The node value of the $tree argument (gotten  by  calling  "getNodeValue")  is  considered  the  root
           directory  from which we begin our traversal. We use File::Spec to keep our paths cross-platform, but
           it is expected that you will feed in a valid path for your OS. If the path either does not exist,  or
           is not a directory, then an exception is thrown.

           The  $tree argument which is passed to "visit" must be a leaf node. This is because this Visitor will
           create all the sub-nodes for this tree. If the tree is not a leaf, an exception is thrown. We do  not
           require  the  tree  to  be  a root though, and this Visitor will not affect any nodes above the $tree
           argument.
