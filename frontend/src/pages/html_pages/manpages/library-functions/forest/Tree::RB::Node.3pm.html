</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Tree::RB::Node - A node class for implementing Red/Black trees

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This document describes Tree::RB::Node version 0.500006

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Tree::RB;

           my $tree = Tree::RB-&gt;new;
           $tree-&gt;put('France'  =&gt; 'Paris');
           $tree-&gt;put('England' =&gt; 'London');

           my $node = $tree-&gt;delete('France'); # $node is a Tree::RB::Node object
           print $node-&gt;key; # 'France'
           print $node-&gt;val; # 'Paris'

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       A Tree::RB tree is made up of nodes that are objects of type Tree::RB::Node

</pre><h4><b>INTERFACE</b></h4><pre>
       A Tree::RB::Node object supports the following methods:

   <b>new()</b>
       Creates and returns a new node.

   <b>key([KEY])</b>
       Get/set the key of the node. This is what the nodes are sorted by in the tree.

   <b>val([VALUE])</b>
       Get/set the value of the node. This can be any scalar.

   <b>color([COLOR])</b>
       Get/set the color of the node. Valid colors are the constants RED and BLACK which are exported by
       Tree::RB::Node::_Constants

   <b>parent([PARENT])</b>
       Get/set the parent of the node, which must be another Tree::RB::Node object.

   <b>left([NODE])</b>
       Get/set the left child node of the node, which must be another Tree::RB::Node object.

   <b>right([NODE])</b>
       Get/set the right child node of the node, which must be another Tree::RB::Node object.

   <b>min()</b>
       Returns the node with the minimal key starting from this node.

   <b>max()</b>
       Returns the node with the maximal key starting from this node.

   <b>leaf()</b>
       Returns the first leaf node found starting from this node, using a depth first, left to right search.

   <b>successor()</b>
       Returns the node with the smallest key larger than this node's key, or "undef" if it is the node with the
       maximal key.

   <b>predecessor()</b>
       Returns the node with the greatest key smaller than this node's key, or "undef" if it is the node with
       the minimal key.

   <b>as_lol([NODE])</b>
       Returns a list of lists representing the tree whose root is either NODE if NODE is specified, or this
       node otherwise.

       This could be used for printing a tree, as the following snippet shows (this assumes that Tree::DAG_Node
       is also installed)

           use strict;
           use Tree::DAG_Node;
           use Tree::RB;

           my $t = Tree::RB-&gt;new;

           foreach (qw/the rain in spain falls mainly in the plains/) {
               $t-&gt;put($_, "${_} val");
           }

           my $tree = Tree::DAG_Node-&gt;lol_to_tree( $t-&gt;root-&gt;as_lol );
           $, = "\n";
           print @{ $tree-&gt;draw_ascii_tree };

       This will print

                             |
                          &lt;B:rain&gt;
                      /-------------------\
                      |                   |
                    &lt;R:in&gt;             &lt;B:the&gt;
               /-----------\            /------\
               |           |            |      |
           &lt;B:falls&gt;   &lt;B:mainly&gt;   &lt;R:spain&gt; &lt;*&gt;
             /---\    /------\        /---\
             |   |    |      |        |   |
            &lt;*&gt; &lt;*&gt;  &lt;*&gt; &lt;R:plains&gt;  &lt;*&gt; &lt;*&gt;
                           /---\
                           |   |
                          &lt;*&gt; &lt;*&gt;

   <b>strip([$callback])</b>
       Strips off all nodes under this node. If a callback is specified, it will be called once for each node
       that is detached, with the detached node as its sole argument.

</pre><h4><b>DEPENDENCIES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>INCOMPATIBILITIES</b></h4><pre>
       None reported.
