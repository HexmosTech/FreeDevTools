       PDL::AutoLoader - MatLab style AutoLoader for PDL

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        use PDL::AutoLoader;
        $x = func1(...);   # Load file func1.pdl
        $y = func2(...);   # Load file func2.pdl

        $PDL::AutoLoader::Rescan = 1; # Enable re-scanning

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module implements a MatLab style AutoLoader for PDL. If an unknown function func() is called, PDL
       looks for a file called "func.pdl".  If it finds one, it compiles the file and calls the function "func".

       The list of directories to search in is given by the shell environment variable "PDLLIB". This is a
       colon-separated list of directories. On MSWindows systems, is it a <u>semicolon</u> -separated list of
       directories.

       For example, in csh:

         setenv PDLLIB "/home/joe/pdllib:/local/pdllib"

       <b>Note</b>: This variable is unrelated to Perl's "PERL5LIB".

       If you add a leading '+' on a directory name, PDL will search the entire directory tree below that point.
       Internally, PDL stores the directory list in the variable @PDLLIB, which can be modified at run time.

       For example, in csh:

         setenv PDLLIB "+/home/joe/PDL"

       will search /home/joe/PDL and all its subdirectories for .pdl files.

   <b>AUTO-SCANNING</b>
       The variable $PDL::AutoLoader::Rescan controls whether files are automatically re-scanned for changes at
       the "perldl" command line.

       If "$PDL::AutoLoader::Rescan == 1" and the file is changed then the new definition is reloaded auto-
       matically before executing the "perldl" command line. Which means in practice you can edit files, save
       changes and have "perldl" see the changes automatically.

       The default is '0' - i.e. to have this feature disabled.

       As this feature is only pertinent to the PDL shell it imposes no overhead on PDL scripts. Yes Bob you can
       have your cake and eat it too!

       Note: files are only re-evaled if they are determined to have been changed according to their date/time
       stamp.

       No doubt this interface could be improved upon some more. :-)

   <b>Sample</b> <b>file:</b>
        sub foo { # file 'foo.pdl' - define the 'foo' function
          my $x=shift;
          return sqrt($x**2 + $x**3 + 2);
        }
        1; # File returns true (i.e. loaded successfully)

       No doubt this interface could be improved upon some more. :-)

       Will probably be quite slow if "$PDL::AutoLoader::Rescan == 1" and thousands of functions have been
       autoloaded.

       There could be a race condition in which the file changes while the internal autoloader code is being
       executed but it should be harmless.

       Probably has not been tested enough!

   <b>PDL::AutoLoader::expand_path</b>
       Expand a compactified path into a dir list

       You supply a pathlist and leading '+' and '~' characters get expanded into full directories.  Normally
       you don't want to use this -- it's internal to the autoloader -- but some utilities, like the online
       documentation searcher, need to be able to use it.
