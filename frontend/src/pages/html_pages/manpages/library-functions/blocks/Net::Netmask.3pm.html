        Net::Netmask - parse, manipulate and lookup IP network blocks

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        use Net::Netmask;

        $block = Net::Netmask-&gt;safe_new(network block)
        $block = Net::Netmask-&gt;safe_new(network block, netmask)
        $block = Net::Netmask-&gt;new2(network block)

        for $zone ($block-&gt;inaddr()) { }

        my $table = {};
        $block-&gt;storeNetblock([$table])
        $block-&gt;deleteNetblock([$table])
        @missingblocks = $block-&gt;cidrs2inverse(@blocks)

        @listofblocks = cidrs2contiglists(@blocks);

        @blocks = sort @blocks
        @blocks = sort_network_blocks(@blocks)

        @sorted_ip_addrs = sort_by_ip_address(@unsorted_ip_addrs)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Net::Netmask parses and understands IPv4 and IPv6 CIDR blocks (see
       &lt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing&gt; for more information on CIDR blocks).
       It's built with an object-oriented interface, with functions being methods that operate on a Net::Netmask
       object.

       These methods provide nearly all types of information about a network block that you might want.

       There are also functions to insert a network block into a table and then later lookup network blocks by
       IP address using that table.  There are functions to turn a IP address range into a list of CIDR blocks.
       There are functions to turn a list of CIDR blocks into a list of IP addresses.

       There is a function for sorting by text IP address.

       All functions understand both IPv4 and IPv6.  Matches, finds, etc, will always return false when an IPv4
       address is matched against an IPv6 address.

       IPv6 support was added in 1.9104.

</pre><h4><b>CONSTRUCTING</b></h4><pre>
       Net::Netmask objects are created with an IP address and optionally a mask.  There are many forms that are
       recognized:

       '216.240.32.0/24'               The preferred IPv4 form.

       '216.240.32.0:255.255.255.0'
       '216.240.32.0-255.255.255.0'
       '216.240.32.0', '255.255.255.0'
       '216.240.32.0', '0xffffff00'
       '216.240.32.0 - 216.240.32.255'
       '216.240.32.4'                  A /32 block.

       'default' or 'any'              0.0.0.0/0 (the default route)

       '216.240.32.0#0.0.31.255'       A  hostmask (as used by Cisco access-lists - that is, the hostmask is the
                                       bitwise inverse of a netmask).

       '2001:db8:1234:5678::/64'       The preferred IPv6 form.

       '2001:db8:1234:5678::9876'      A /128 block.

       'default6' or 'any6'            ::/0 (the default route)

       There are two constructor methods: "new" and "safe_new" (also known as "new2").

       "safe_new" differs from "new" in that it will return undef for invalid netmasks, while "new" will  return
       a netmask object even if the constructor could not figure out what the network block should be.

       With  "new",  the error string can be found as $block-&gt;{'ERROR'}.  With "safe_new" the error can be found
       as Net::Netmask::errstr or $Net::Netmask::error.

       IMPORTANT: You want to use "safe_new" or "new2" ("new2" is a synonym for "safe_new") in new code!

       As of version 2.000, the following abbreviated IPv4 netblocks are not accepted by  default,  but  can  be
       accepted with options.

       '216.240.32'                    Always a /24 block.

       '216.240'                       Always a /16 block.

       '140'                           Always a /8 block.

       '216.240.32/24'
       '216.240/16'

       To accept these, you can call the constructor with a "shortnet" option set to a true value.  Example:

         my $block = Net::Netmask-&gt;safe_new("216.240/16", shortnet =&gt; 1);

       For compatibility with older codebases, it's also possible to change the default to use the old behavior.
       To  do  this, you can set the $Net::Netmask::SHORTNET_DEFAULT variable to a true value. It is recommended
       that this be done by localizing the variable. Example:

         local $Net::Netmask::SHORTNET_DEFAULT = 1
         my $block = Net::Netmask-&gt;safe_new("216.240/16");

       Please be aware that there are security implications to this as other Perl modules, system libraries,  or
       utilities may not parse these addresses the same way.  This is why the default was changed.

       For instance:

         perl -MNet::Netmask -E "say Net::Netmask-&gt;safe_new("10.20", shortnet =&gt; 1)"

       Will print "10.2.0.0/16".  However:

         perl -MSocket -E "say inet_ntoa(inet_aton('10.20'))"

       Will  often  print "10.0.0.20" which is obviously very different, and if the Net::Netmask module was used
       to check an IP aggainst an ACL, and then  another  program  was  executed  (that  uses  <b>inet_aton()</b>,  for
       instance), the ACL processing might not match the connection.

       Thus, it is advised to use this with caution.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       -&gt;<b>desc</b>()                 Returns   a   description  of  the  network  block.   Eg:  "216.240.32.0/19"  or
                                "2001:db8:1234::/48".  This is also available as overloaded stringification.

       -&gt;<b>base</b>()                 Returns base address of the network block as a string.  Eg: "216.240.32.0".   or
                                "2001:db8:1234::/48".   <b>Base</b>  does  not  give  an  indication of the size of the
                                network block.

       -&gt;<b>mask</b>()                 Returns the netmask as a string. Eg: "255.255.255.0" or "ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff::"

       -&gt;<b>hostmask</b>()             Returns the host mask which is the opposite of the netmask.  Eg: "0.0.0.255"  or
                                "::ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff".

       -&gt;<b>bits</b>()                 Returns  the  netmask  as a number of bits in the network portion of the address
                                for this block.  Eg: 24.

       -&gt;<b>size</b>()                 Returns the number of IP addresses in a block.  Eg: 256.   For  IPv6  addresses,
                                this will be a Math::BigInt object.

       -&gt;<b>broadcast</b>()            The  blocks  broadcast  address.  (The  last  IP  address inside the block.) Eg:
                                192.168.1.0/24      =&gt;       192.168.1.255       or       2001:db8::/64       =&gt;
                                2001:db8::ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff

       -&gt;<b>next</b>()                 The  first  IP  address  following  the  block.  (The  IP  address following the
                                broadcast address.) Eg: 192.168.1.0/24 =&gt; 192.168.2.0  or  2001:db8:0:1::/64  =&gt;
                                2001:db8:0:2::/64

       -&gt;<b>first</b>() &amp; -&gt;<b>last</b>()     Synonyms for -&gt;<b>base</b>() and -&gt;<b>broadcast</b>()

       -&gt;<b>protocol</b>()             Added in version 1.9102.

                                Returns  the address family/protocol represented by the block.  Either 'IPv4' or
                                'IPv6'.

       -&gt;<b>match</b>($ip)             Returns a true if the IP number $ip matches the given network. That is,  a  true
                                value  is returned if $ip is between <b>base()</b> and <b>broadcast()</b>.  For example, if we
                                have the network 192.168.1.0/24, then

                                  192.168.0.255 =&gt; 0
                                  192.168.1.0   =&gt; "0 "
                                  192.168.1.1   =&gt; 1
                                  ...
                                  192.168.1.255 =&gt; 255

                                $ip should be a dotted-quad (eg: "192.168.66.3") or an IPv6 address in  standard
                                notation (eg: "2001:db8::1").

                                It  just  happens that the return value is the position within the block.  Since
                                zero is a legal position, the true string "0 " is returned in it's place.  "0  "
                                is numerically zero though.  When wanting to know the position inside the block,
                                a good idiom is:

                                  $pos = $block-&gt;match($ip) or die;
                                  $pos += 0;

       -&gt;<b>maxblock</b>()             Much  of  the  time, it is not possible to determine the size of a network block
                                just  from  it's  base  address.   For   example,   with   the   network   block
                                '216.240.32.0/27',  if  you  only had the '216.240.32.0' portion you wouldn't be
                                able to tell for certain  the  size  of  the  block.   '216.240.32.0'  could  be
                                anything  from  a '/23' to a '/32'.  The <b>maxblock</b>() method gives the size of the
                                largest block that the current block's address would allow it to be.   The  size
                                is given in bits.  Eg: 23.

       -&gt;<b>enumerate</b>([$bitstep)   Returns a list of all the IP addresses in the block.  Be very careful not to use
                                this  function  of large blocks.  The IP addresses are returned as strings.  Eg:
                                '216.240.32.0', '216.240.32.1', ... '216.240.32.255'.

                                If the optional argument is given, step through the block  in  increments  of  a
                                given network size.  To step by 4, use a bitstep of 30 (as in a /30 network).

                                Note  that  for  IPv6,  this  will  return  failure  if  more than 1,000,000,000
                                addresses would be returned.

       -&gt;<b>nth</b>($index, [$bitstep])
                                Returns the nth element of the array that <b>enumerate</b>  would  return  if  it  were
                                called.  So, to get the first usable address in a block, use <b><a href="../man1/nth.1.html">nth</a></b>(1).  To get the
                                broadcast address, use <b>nth</b>(-1).  To get the last usable address, use <b>nth</b>(-2).

       -&gt;<b>inaddr</b>()               Returns an inline list of tuples.

                                For IPv4:

                                There is a tuple for each DNS zone name (at the /24 level) in the block.  If the
                                block is smaller than a /24, then the zone of the enclosing /24 is returned.

                                Each  tuple  contains:  the  DNS  zone  name, the last component of the first IP
                                address in the block in that zone, the last component of the last IP address  in
                                the block in that zone.

                                Examples:   the   list  returned  for  the  block  '216.240.32.0/23'  would  be:
                                '32.240.216.in-addr.arpa', 0, 255, '33.240.216.in-addr.arpa', 0, 255.  The  list
                                returned  for  the block '216.240.32.64/27' would be: '32.240.216.in-addr.arpa',
                                64, 95.

                                For IPv6:

                                A list is returned with  each  DNS  zone  name  at  the  shortest-prefix  length
                                possible.  This is not returned as a tuple, but just a list of strings.

                                Examples:  the  list  returned  for the block '2002::/16' would be a one element
                                list, containing just 2.0.0.2.ip6.arpa'.  The list for '2002::/17' would  return
                                a two element list containing '0.2.0.0.2.ip6.arpa' and '1.2.0.0.2.ip6.arpa'.

       -&gt;<b>nextblock</b>([$count])    Without  a $count, return the next block of the same size after the current one.
                                With a count, return the Nth block after the current one.  A count of -1 returns
                                the previous block.  Undef will be returned if out of legal address space.

       -&gt;<b>sameblock</b>($block)      Compares two blocks.  The second block will be auto-converted from a  string  if
                                it isn't already a Net::Netmask object.  Returns 1 if they are identical.

       -&gt;<b>cmpblocks</b>($block)      Compares  two  blocks.  The second block will be auto-converted from a string if
                                it isn't already a Net::Netmask object.  Returns -1, 0, or 1 depending on  which
                                one has the lower base address or which one is larger if they have the same base
                                address.

       -&gt;<b>contains</b>($block)       Compares  two  blocks.  The second block will be auto-converted from a string if
                                it isn't already a Net::Netmask object.  Returns 1  if  the  second  block  fits
                                inside the first block.  Returns 0 otherwise.

       -&gt;<b>storeNetblock</b>([$t])    Adds  the current block to an table of network blocks.  The table can be used to
                                query which network block a given IP address is in.

                                The optional argument allows there to be more than one table.   By  default,  an
                                internal  table  is  used.    If  more  than  one table is needed, then supply a
                                reference to a HASH to store the data in.

       -&gt;<b>deleteNetblock</b>([$t])   Deletes the current block from a table of network blocks.

                                The optional argument allows there to be more than one table.   By  default,  an
                                internal  table  is  used.    If  more  than  one table is needed, then supply a
                                reference to a HASH to store the data in.

       -&gt;<b>checkNetblock</b>([$t])    Returns true of the netblock is already in the network table.

       -&gt;<b>tag</b>($name [, $value])  Tag network blocks with your own data.  The first argument is the name  of  your
                                tag  (hash  key) and the second argument (if present) is the new value.  The old
                                value is returned.

       -&gt;<b>split</b>($parts)          Splits a netmask into a number of sub netblocks. This number must be  a  base  2
                                number  (2,4,8,16,etc.)  and the number must not exceed the number of IPs within
                                this netmask.

                                For instance,

                                  Net::Netmask-&gt;safe_new( '10.0.0.0/24' )-&gt;<a href="../man2/split.2.html">split</a>(2)

                                is equivalent to

                                  ( Net::Netmask( '10.0.0.0/25'), Net::Netmask( '10.0.0.128/25' ) )

</pre><h4><b>METHOD/FUNCTION</b> <b>COMBOS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>findOuterNetblock</b>(ip, [$t])
                                Search the table of network blocks (created with <b>storeNetBlock</b>) to find  if  any
                                of  them contain the given IP address.  The IP address can either be a string or
                                a Net::Netmask object (method invocation).  If more than one block in the  table
                                contains  the  IP  address  or  block, the largest network block will be the one
                                returned.

                                The return value is either a Net::Netmask object or undef.

       <b>cidrs2inverse</b>(block, @listOfBlocks)
                                Given a block and a list of blocks, <b>cidrs2inverse</b>() will return a list of blocks
                                representing the IP addresses that are in the block  but  not  in  the  list  of
                                blocks.  It finds the gaps.

                                The  block  will  be  auto-converted  from  a  string  if  it  isn't  already  a
                                Net::Netmask object.  The list of blocks should be Net::Netmask objects.

                                The return value is a list of Net::Netmask objects.

</pre><h4><b>OVERLOADING</b></h4><pre>
       <b>""</b>                       Strinification is overloaded to be the -&gt;<b>desc</b>() method.

       <b>cmp</b>                      Numerical and string comparisons  have  been  overloaded  to  the  -&gt;<b>cmpblocks</b>()
                                method.  This allows blocks to be sorted without specifying a sort function.

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>sort_by_ip_address</b>       This function is included in "Net::Netmask" simply because there doesn't seem to
                                be  a better place to put it on CPAN.  It turns out that there is one method for
                                sorting dotted-quads ("a.b.c.d") that is faster than all the rest.  This is that
                                way.  Use it as "sort_by_ip_address(@list_of_ips)".  That was the theory anyway.
                                Someone sent a faster version ...

                                This method also will sort IPv6 addresses, but is not performance optimized.  It
                                is correct, however.

       <b>sort_network_blocks</b>      This function is a function to sort Net::Netmask objects.  It's faster than  the
                                simpler "sort @blocks" that also works.

       <b>findNetblock</b>(ip, [$t])   Search  the  table of network blocks (created with <b>storeNetBlock</b>) to find if any
                                of them contain the given IP address.  The  IP  address  is  expected  to  be  a
                                string.   If  more  than  one  block  in  the table contains the IP address, the
                                smallest network block will be the one returned.

                                The return value is either a Net::Netmask object or undef.

       <b>findAllNetblock</b>(ip, [$t])
                                Search the table of network blocks (created with <b>storeNetBlock</b>) to find  if  any
                                of  them  contain  the  given  IP  address.   The IP address is expected to be a
                                string.   All network blocks in the table that contain the IP  address  will  be
                                returned.

                                The return value is a list of Net::Netmask objects.

       <b>dumpNetworkTable</b>([$t])   Returns   a   list   of   the  networks  in  a  network  table  (as  created  by
                                -&gt;<b>storeNetblock</b>()).

       <b>range2cidrlist</b>($startip, $endip)
                                Given a range of IP addresses, return a list of blocks that span that range.

                                For example, range2cidrlist('216.240.32.128', '216.240.36.127'), will  return  a
                                list of Net::Netmask objects that correspond to:

                                    216.240.32.128/25
                                    216.240.33.0/24
                                    216.240.34.0/23
                                    216.240.36.0/25

       <b>cidrs2contiglists</b>(@listOfBlocks)
                                "cidrs2contiglists"  will  rearrange  a  list  of Net::Netmask objects such that
                                contiguous sets are in sublists and each sublist is discontiguous with the next.

                                For example, given a list of Net::Netmask objects corresponding to the following
                                blocks:

                                    216.240.32.128/25
                                    216.240.33.0/24
                                    216.240.36.0/25

                                "cidrs2contiglists" will return a list with two sublists:

                                    216.240.32.128/25 216.240.33.0/24

                                    216.240.36.0/25

                                Overlapping blocks will be placed in the same sublist.

       <b>cidrs2cidrs</b>(@listOfBlocks)
                                "cidrs2cidrs" will collapse a list of Net::Netmask objects by combining adjacent
                                blocks into larger blocks.   It returns a list of blocks that covers exactly the
                                same IP space.  Overlapping blocks will be collapsed.
