       Net::SNMP - Object oriented interface to SNMP

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       The Net::SNMP module implements an object oriented interface to the Simple Network Management Protocol.
       Perl applications can use the module to retrieve or update information on a remote host using the SNMP
       protocol.  The module supports SNMP version-1, SNMP version-2c (Community-Based SNMPv2), and SNMP
       version-3. The Net::SNMP module assumes that the user has a basic understanding of the Simple Network
       Management Protocol and related network management concepts.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The Net::SNMP module abstracts the intricate details of the Simple Network Management Protocol by
       providing a high level programming interface to the protocol.  Each Net::SNMP object provides a one-to-
       one mapping between a Perl object and a remote SNMP agent or manager.  Once an object is created, it can
       be used to perform the basic protocol exchange actions defined by SNMP.

       A Net::SNMP object can be created such that it has either "blocking" or "non-blocking" properties.  By
       default, the methods used to send SNMP messages do not return until the protocol exchange has completed
       successfully or a timeout period has expired. This behavior gives the object a "blocking" property
       because the flow of the code is stopped until the method returns.

       The optional named argument <b>-nonblocking</b> can be passed to the object constructor with a true value to
       give the object "non-blocking" behavior.  A method invoked by a non-blocking object queues the SNMP
       message and returns immediately, allowing the flow of the code to continue. The queued SNMP messages are
       not sent until an event loop is entered by calling the snmp_dispatcher() method.  When the SNMP messages
       are sent, any response to the messages invokes the subroutine defined by the user when the message was
       originally queued. The event loop exits when all messages have been removed from the queue by either
       receiving a response, or by exceeding the number of retries at the Transport Layer.

   <b>Blocking</b> <b>Objects</b>
       The default behavior of the methods associated with a Net::SNMP object is to block the code flow until
       the method completes.  For methods that initiate a SNMP protocol exchange requiring a response, a hash
       reference containing the results of the query is returned. The undefined value is returned by all methods
       when a failure has occurred. The error() method can be used to determine the cause of the failure.

       The hash reference returned by a SNMP protocol exchange points to a hash constructed from the VarBindList
       contained in the SNMP response message.  The hash is created using the ObjectName and the ObjectSyntax
       pairs in the VarBindList.  The keys of the hash consist of the OBJECT IDENTIFIERs in dotted notation
       corresponding to each ObjectName in the VarBindList.  The value of each hash entry is set equal to the
       value of the corresponding ObjectSyntax.  This hash reference can also be retrieved using the
       var_bind_list() method.

   <b>Non-blocking</b> <b>Objects</b>
       When a Net::SNMP object is created having non-blocking behavior, the invocation of a method associated
       with the object returns immediately, allowing the flow of the code to continue.  When a method is invoked
       that would initiate a SNMP protocol exchange requiring a response, either a true value (i.e. 0x1) is
       returned immediately or the undefined value is returned if there was a failure.  The error() method can
       be used to determine the cause of the failure.

       The contents of the VarBindList contained in the SNMP response message can be retrieved by calling the
       var_bind_list() method using the object reference passed as the first argument to the callback.  The
       value returned by the var_bind_list() method is a hash reference created using the ObjectName and the
       ObjectSyntax pairs in the VarBindList.  The keys of the hash consist of the OBJECT IDENTIFIERs in dotted
       notation corresponding to each ObjectName in the VarBindList.  The value of each hash entry is set equal
       to the value of the corresponding ObjectSyntax. The undefined value is returned if there has been a
       failure and the error() method may be used to determine the reason.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       When named arguments are expected by the methods, two different styles are supported.  All examples in
       this documentation use the dashed-option style:

              $object-&gt;method(-argument =&gt; $value);

       However, the IO:: style is also allowed:

              $object-&gt;method(Argument =&gt; $value);

       Non-blocking Objects Arguments
           When a Net::SNMP object has been created with a "non-blocking" property, most methods that generate a
           SNMP message take additional arguments to support this property.

           Callback
               Most  methods  associated  with  a  non-blocking  object  have  an optional named argument called
               <b>-callback</b>.  The <b>-callback</b> argument expects a reference to a subroutine or to an array whose first
               element must be a reference to a subroutine.  The subroutine defined by the <b>-callback</b>  option  is
               executed  when  a response to a SNMP message is received, an error condition has occurred, or the
               number of retries for the message has been exceeded.

               When the <b>-callback</b> argument only contains a subroutine reference,  the  subroutine  is  evaluated
               passing  a  reference  to  the original Net::SNMP object as the only parameter.  If the <b>-callback</b>
               argument was defined as an array reference, all elements in the array are  passed  to  subroutine
               after  the  reference  to  the  Net::SNMP  object.   The first element, which is required to be a
               reference to a subroutine,  is  removed  before  the  remaining  arguments  are  passed  to  that
               subroutine.

               Once  one  method is invoked with the <b>-callback</b> argument, this argument stays with the object and
               is used by any further calls to methods using the <b>-callback</b> option if  the  argument  is  absent.
               The undefined value may be passed to the <b>-callback</b> argument to delete the callback.

               <b>NOTE:</b>  The  subroutine  being  passed with the <b>-callback</b> named argument should not cause blocking
               itself.  This will cause all the actions in the event loop to  be  stopped,  defeating  the  non-
               blocking property of the Net::SNMP module.

           Delay
               An  optional  argument  <b>-delay</b>  can  also be passed to non-blocking objects.  The <b>-delay</b> argument
               instructs the object to wait the number of seconds passed to the argument  before  executing  the
               SNMP  protocol  exchange.   The  delay  period starts when the event loop is entered.  The <b>-delay</b>
               parameter is applied to all methods associated with the object once it is specified.   The  delay
               value must be set back to 0 seconds to disable the delay parameter.

       SNMPv3 Arguments
           A  SNMP  context  is  a collection of management information accessible by a SNMP entity.  An item of
           management information may exist in more than one context and a SNMP entity potentially has access to
           many contexts.  The combination of a contextEngineID and a  contextName  unambiguously  identifies  a
           context  within  an  administrative domain.  In a SNMPv3 message, the contextEngineID and contextName
           are included as part of the scopedPDU.  All methods that generate a SNMP message  optionally  take  a
           <b>-contextengineid</b> and <b>-contextname</b> argument to configure these fields.

           Context Engine ID
               The   <b>-contextengineid</b>   argument   expects   a   hexadecimal  string  representing  the  desired
               contextEngineID.  The string must be 10 to 64 characters  (5  to  32  octets)  long  and  can  be
               prefixed  with an optional "0x".  Once the <b>-contextengineid</b> is specified it stays with the object
               until it is changed again or reset to default by passing in the undefined value.  By default, the
               contextEngineID is set to match the authoritativeEngineID of the authoritative SNMP engine.

           Context Name
               The contextName is passed as a string  which  must  be  0  to  32  octets  in  length  using  the
               <b>-contextname</b>  argument.   The  contextName  stays  with  the  object  until  it  is changed.  The
               contextName defaults to an empty string which represents the "default" context.

   <b>session()</b> <b>-</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>Net::SNMP</b> <b>object</b>
          ($session, $error) = Net::SNMP-&gt;session(
                                  [-hostname      =&gt; $hostname,]
                                  [-port          =&gt; $port,]
                                  [-localaddr     =&gt; $localaddr,]
                                  [-localport     =&gt; $localport,]
                                  [-nonblocking   =&gt; $boolean,]
                                  [-version       =&gt; $version,]
                                  [-domain        =&gt; $domain,]
                                  [-timeout       =&gt; $seconds,]
                                  [-retries       =&gt; $count,]
                                  [-maxmsgsize    =&gt; $octets,]
                                  [-translate     =&gt; $translate,]
                                  [-debug         =&gt; $bitmask,]
                                  [-community     =&gt; $community,]   # v1/v2c
                                  [-username      =&gt; $username,]    # v3
                                  [-authkey       =&gt; $authkey,]     # v3
                                  [-authpassword  =&gt; $authpasswd,]  # v3
                                  [-authprotocol  =&gt; $authproto,]   # v3
                                  [-privkey       =&gt; $privkey,]     # v3
                                  [-privpassword  =&gt; $privpasswd,]  # v3
                                  [-privprotocol  =&gt; $privproto,]   # v3
                               );

       This is the constructor for Net::SNMP objects.  In scalar context, a reference to a new Net::SNMP  object
       is returned if the creation of the object is successful.  In list context, a reference to a new Net::SNMP
       object  and  an  empty  error  message  string is returned.  If a failure occurs, the object reference is
       returned as the undefined value.  The error string may be used to determine the cause of the error.

       Most of the named arguments passed to the constructor define basic attributes for the object and are  not
       modifiable  after  the  object  has  been  created.  The <b>-timeout</b>, <b>-retries</b>, <b>-maxmsgsize</b>, <b>-translate</b>, and
       <b>-debug</b> arguments are modifiable using an accessor method.  See their corresponding method definitions for
       a complete description of their usage, default values, and valid ranges.

       Transport Domain Arguments
           The Net::SNMP module uses UDP/IPv4 as the default Transport Domain to exchange SNMP messages  between
           the  local  and  remote  devices.   The  module  also  supports  UDP/IPv6,  TCP/IPv4, and TCP/IPv6 as
           alternative Transport Domains.  The <b>-domain</b> argument can be used to change the  Transport  Domain  by
           setting  the  value  to  one of the following strings: 'udp6', 'udp/ipv6'; 'tcp', 'tcp4', 'tcp/ipv4';
           'tcp6', or 'tcp/ipv6'.  The <b>-domain</b> argument also accepts the strings 'udp',  'udp4',  or  'udp/ipv4'
           which correspond to the default Transport Domain of UDP/IPv4.

           The  transport  address of the destination SNMP device can be specified using the <b>-hostname</b> argument.
           This argument is optional and defaults to "localhost".  The destination port number can be  specified
           as  part  of the transport address or by using the <b>-port</b> argument.  Either a numeric port number or a
           textual service name can be specified.  A numeric port number in parentheses  can  optionally  follow
           the  service  name.   This  port  number will be used if the service name cannot be resolved.  If the
           destination port number is not specified, the well-known SNMP port number 161 is used.

           By default the source transport address and port number are assigned dynamically by the local  device
           on  which the Net::SNMP module is being used.  This dynamic assignment can be overridden by using the
           <b>-localaddr</b> and <b>-localport</b> arguments.  These arguments accept the same values  as  the  <b>-hostname</b>  and
           <b>-port</b>  arguments  respectively.   The  resolved  address  must  correspond  to  a valid address of an
           interface on the local device.

           When using an IPv4 Transport Domain, the transport address can be specified as either an  IP  network
           hostname  or  an  IPv4  address  in standard dotted notation.  The port information can be optionally
           appended to the hostname or address delimited by  a  colon.   The  accepted  IPv4  transport  address
           formats are "address", "address:port", "hostname", and "hostname:port".

           When  using an IPv6 Transport Domain, the transport address can be specified as an IP hostname (which
           will be looked up as a DNS quad-A record) or an  IPv6  address  in  presentation  format.   The  port
           information  can  optionally  be  included  following  a  colon  after the hostname or address.  When
           including this information after an IPv6 address, the address must be enclosed  in  square  brackets.
           The  scope  zone  index (described in RFC 4007) can be specified after the address as a decimal value
           delimited by a percent sign.   The  accepted  transport  address  formats  for  IPv6  are  "address",
           "address%zone", "[address]:port", "[address%zone]:port", "hostname", and "hostname:port".

       Security Model Arguments
           The  <b>-version</b>  argument  controls  which  other  arguments  are expected or required by the session()
           constructor.  The Net::SNMP module supports SNMPv1, SNMPv2c, and  SNMPv3.   The  module  defaults  to
           SNMPv1  if  no  <b>-version</b>  argument  is specified.  The <b>-version</b> argument expects either a digit (i.e.
           '1', '2', or '3') or a string specifying the version  (i.e.  'snmpv1',  'snmpv2c',  or  'snmpv3')  to
           define the SNMP version.

           The  Security  Model  used  by  the Net::SNMP object is based on the SNMP version associated with the
           object.  If the SNMP version is SNMPv1 or SNMPv2c a Community-based  Security  Model  will  be  used,
           while the User-based Security Model (USM) will be used if the version is SNMPv3.

           Community-based Security Model Argument
               If the Security Model is Community-based, the only argument available is the <b>-community</b> argument.
               This  argument  expects  a  string that is to be used as the SNMP community name.  By default the
               community name is set to 'public' if the argument is not present.

           User-based Security Model Arguments
               The User-based Security Model (USM) used by SNMPv3 requires  that  a  securityName  be  specified
               using  the <b>-username</b> argument.  The creation of a Net::SNMP object with the version set to SNMPv3
               will fail if the <b>-username</b> argument is not present.  The <b>-username</b> argument expects a string 1 to
               32 octets in length.

               Different levels of  security  are  allowed  by  the  User-based  Security  Model  which  address
               authentication  and  privacy  concerns.  A SNMPv3 Net::SNMP object will derive the security level
               (securityLevel) based on which of the following arguments are specified.

               By default a securityLevel of 'noAuthNoPriv'  is  assumed.   If  the  <b>-authkey</b>  or  <b>-authpassword</b>
               arguments  are  specified,  the  securityLevel  becomes 'authNoPriv'.  The <b>-authpassword</b> argument
               expects a string which is at least 1 octet in length.  Optionally, the <b>-authkey</b> argument  can  be
               used  so  that  a  plain  text  password does not have to be specified in a script.  The <b>-authkey</b>
               argument  expects  a  hexadecimal  string  produced  by  localizing   the   password   with   the
               authoritativeEngineID  for  the specific destination device.  The "snmpkey" utility included with
               the distribution can be used to create the hexadecimal string (see snmpkey).

               Two different hash algorithms are defined by SNMPv3 which can be used by the Security  Model  for
               authentication.   These algorithms are HMAC-MD5-96 "MD5" (RFC 1321) and HMAC-SHA-96 "SHA-1" (NIST
               FIPS PUB 180-1).   The default algorithm used by the module is HMAC-MD5-96.  This behavior can be
               changed by using the <b>-authprotocol</b> argument.  This argument expects either the  string  'md5'  or
               'sha' to be passed to modify the hash algorithm.

               By  specifying  the  arguments  <b>-privkey</b>  or  <b>-privpassword</b> the securityLevel associated with the
               object becomes 'authPriv'.  According to SNMPv3, privacy  requires  the  use  of  authentication.
               Therefore,  if  either  of  these  two  arguments  are  present and the <b>-authkey</b> or <b>-authpassword</b>
               arguments are missing, the  creation  of  the  object  fails.   The  <b>-privkey</b>  and  <b>-privpassword</b>
               arguments expect the same input as the <b>-authkey</b> and <b>-authpassword</b> arguments respectively.

               The  User-based  Security  Model described in RFC 3414 defines a single encryption protocol to be
               used for privacy.  This protocol, CBC-DES "DES" (NIST FIPS PUB 46-1), is used by  default  or  if
               the  string  'des'  is  passed  to the <b>-privprotocol</b> argument.  The module also supports RFC 3826
               which describes the use of CFB128-AES-128 "AES"  (NIST  FIPS  PUB  197)  in  the  USM.   The  AES
               encryption  protocol  can be selected by passing 'aes' or 'aes128' to the <b>-privprotocol</b> argument.
               By      working       with       the       Extended       Security       Options       Consortium
               &lt;<a href="http://www.snmp.com/protocol/eso.shtml">http://www.snmp.com/protocol/eso.shtml</a>&gt;,  the  module  also  supports  CBC-3DES-EDE "Triple-DES"
               (NIST  FIPS  46-3)  in  the  User-based  Security  Model.   This  is   defined   in   the   draft
               &lt;<a href="http://www.snmp.com/eso/draft-reeder-snmpv3-usm-3desede-00.txt">http://www.snmp.com/eso/draft-reeder-snmpv3-usm-3desede-00.txt</a>&gt;.    The   Triple-DES  encryption
               protocol can be selected using the <b>-privprotocol</b> argument with the string '3des' or '3desede'.

   <b>close()</b> <b>-</b> <b>clear</b> <b>the</b> <b>Transport</b> <b>Domain</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>object</b>
          $session-&gt;close();

       This method clears the Transport Domain and any errors associated with  the  object.   Once  closed,  the
       Net::SNMP object can no longer be used to send or receive SNMP messages.

   <b>snmp_dispatcher()</b> <b>-</b> <b>enter</b> <b>the</b> <b>non-blocking</b> <b>object</b> <b>event</b> <b>loop</b>
          $session-&gt;snmp_dispatcher();

       This  method enters the event loop associated with non-blocking Net::SNMP objects.  The method exits when
       all queued SNMP messages have received a response or have timed out at the Transport Layer.  This  method
       is also exported as the stand alone function snmp_dispatcher() by default (see "EXPORTS").

   <b>get_request()</b> <b>-</b> <b>send</b> <b>a</b> <b>SNMP</b> <b>get-request</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>remote</b> <b>agent</b>
          $result = $session-&gt;get_request(
                                 [-callback        =&gt; sub {},]     # non-blocking

       This method performs a SNMP get-request query to gather data from the remote agent on the host associated
       with  the Net::SNMP object.  The message is built using the list of OBJECT IDENTIFIERs in dotted notation
       passed to the method as an array reference using the <b>-varbindlist</b> argument.  Each  OBJECT  IDENTIFIER  is
       placed into a single SNMP GetRequest-PDU in the same order that it held in the original list.

       A  reference  to  a hash is returned in blocking mode which contains the contents of the VarBindList.  In
       non-blocking mode, a true value is returned when no error has occurred.  In either  mode,  the  undefined
       value  is  returned when an error has occurred.  The error() method may be used to determine the cause of
       the failure.

       This method is used to modify data on the remote agent that is associated with the Net::SNMP object using
       a  SNMP  set-request.   The  message  is  built  using a list of values consisting of groups of an OBJECT
       IDENTIFIER, an object type, and the actual value to be set.  This list is passed  to  the  method  as  an
       array reference using the <b>-varbindlist</b> argument.  The OBJECT IDENTIFIERs in each trio are to be in dotted
       notation.   The object type is an octet corresponding to the ASN.1 type of value that is to be set.  Each
       of the supported ASN.1 types have  been  defined  and  are  exported  by  the  package  by  default  (see
       "EXPORTS").

       A  reference  to  a hash is returned in blocking mode which contains the contents of the VarBindList.  In
       non-blocking mode, a true value is returned when no error has occurred.  In either  mode,  the  undefined

                              );

       This method sends a SNMP trap to the remote manager associated with the Net::SNMP object.  All  arguments
       are optional and will be given the following defaults in the absence of a corresponding named argument:

       •   The   default   value   for   the   trap   <b>-enterprise</b>   is   "1.3.6.1.4.1",   which  corresponds  to
           "iso.org.dod.internet.private.enterprises".  The  enterprise  value  is  expected  to  be  an  OBJECT
           IDENTIFER in dotted notation.

       •   When  the  Transport Domain is UDP/IPv4 or TCP/IPv4, the default value for the trap <b>-agentaddr</b> is the
           IP address associated with the interface on which the trap will be transmitted.  For other  Transport
           Domains  the  <b>-agentaddr</b> is defaulted to "0.0.0.0".  When specified, the agent-addr is expected to be
           an IpAddress in dotted notation.

       •   The default value for the <b>-generictrap</b> type is 6  which  corresponds  to  "enterpriseSpecific".   The
           generic-trap types are defined and can be exported upon request (see "EXPORTS").

       •   The default value for the <b>-specifictrap</b> type is 0.  No pre-defined values are available for specific-
           trap types.

       •   The  default value for the trap <b>-timestamp</b> is the "uptime" of the script.  The "uptime" of the script
           is the number of hundredths of seconds that have elapsed since the script began running.   The  time-
           stamp is expected to be a TimeTicks number in hundredths of seconds.

       •   The  default  value for the trap <b>-varbindlist</b> is an empty array reference.  The variable-bindings are
           expected to be in an array format consisting of groups of an OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an object  type,  and
           the  actual value of the object.  This is identical to the list expected by the set_request() method.
           The OBJECT IDENTIFIERs in each trio are to be in dotted  notation.   The  object  type  is  an  octet
           corresponding  to the ASN.1 type for the value. Each of the supported types have been defined and are
           exported by default (see "EXPORTS").

       A true value is returned when the method is successful. The undefined value is returned  when  a  failure
       has  occurred.   The error() method can be used to determine the cause of the failure. Since there are no
       acknowledgements for Trap-PDUs, there is no way to determine if the remote  host  actually  received  the
       trap.

       <b>NOTE:</b>  When  the object is in non-blocking mode, the trap is not sent until the event loop is entered and
       no callback is ever executed.

       <b>NOTE:</b> This method can only be used when the version of the object is set to SNMPv1.

                              );

       This method performs a SNMP get-bulk-request query to gather data from  the  remote  agent  on  the  host
       associated  with  the Net::SNMP object.  All arguments are optional except <b>-varbindlist</b> and will be given
       the following defaults in the absence of a corresponding named argument:

       •   The default value for the get-bulk-request <b>-nonrepeaters</b> is 0.  The non-repeaters value specifies the
           number of variables in the variable-bindings list for which a single successor is to be returned.

       •   The default value for the get-bulk-request <b>-maxrepetitions</b> is 0. The max-repetitions value  specifies
           the number of successors to be returned for the remaining variables in the variable-bindings list.

       •   The  <b>-varbindlist</b>  argument  expects an array reference consisting of a list of OBJECT IDENTIFIERs in
           dotted notation.  Each OBJECT IDENTIFER is placed into a single SNMP GetBulkRequest-PDU in  the  same
           order that it held in the original list.

       A  reference  to  a hash is returned in blocking mode which contains the contents of the VarBindList.  In
       non-blocking mode, a true value is returned when no error has occurred.  In either  mode,  the  undefined
       value  is  returned when an error has occurred.  The error() method may be used to determine the cause of
       the failure.

       <b>NOTE:</b> This method can only be used when the version of the object is set to SNMPv2c or SNMPv3.

                              );

       This method is used to provide management information to the remote manager associated with the Net::SNMP
       object using an inform-request.  The message is built using a list of values consisting of groups  of  an
       OBJECT  IDENTIFIER,  an  object  type, and the actual value to be identified.  This list is passed to the
       method as an array reference using the <b>-varbindlist</b> argument.  The OBJECT IDENTIFIERs in each trio are to
       be in dotted notation.  The object type is an octet corresponding to the ASN.1 type of value that  is  to
       be  identified.   Each  of the supported ASN.1 types have been defined and are exported by the package by
       default (see "EXPORTS").

       The first two variable-bindings fields in the inform-request are specified by SNMPv2 and should be:

       •   sysUpTime.0 - ('1.3.6.1.2.1.1.3.0', TIMETICKS, $timeticks)

       •   snmpTrapOID.0 - ('1.3.6.1.6.3.1.1.4.1.0', OBJECT_IDENTIFIER, $oid)

       A reference to a hash is returned in blocking mode which contains the contents of  the  VarBindList.   In
       non-blocking  mode,  a  true value is returned when no error has occurred.  In either mode, the undefined
       value is returned when an error has occurred.  The error() method may be used to determine the  cause  of
       the failure.

       <b>NOTE:</b> This method can only be used when the version of the object is set to SNMPv2c or SNMPv3.

   <b>snmpv2_trap()</b> <b>-</b> <b>send</b> <b>a</b> <b>SNMP</b> <b>snmpV2-trap</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>remote</b> <b>manager</b>
          $result = $session-&gt;snmpv2_trap(

                                 -varbindlist      =&gt; \@oid_value,
                              );

       This  method sends a snmpV2-trap to the remote manager associated with the Net::SNMP object.  The message
       is built using a list of values consisting of groups of an OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an  object  type,  and  the
       actual  value  to  be  identified.   This  list  is  passed to the method as an array reference using the
       <b>-varbindlist</b> argument.  The OBJECT IDENTIFIERs in each trio are to be in  dotted  notation.   The  object
       type  is  an  octet  corresponding  to  the  ASN.1  type  of value that is to be identified.  Each of the
       supported ASN.1 types have been defined and are exported by the package by default (see "EXPORTS").

       The first two variable-bindings fields in the snmpV2-trap are specified by SNMPv2 and should be:

       •   sysUpTime.0 - ('1.3.6.1.2.1.1.3.0', TIMETICKS, $timeticks)

       •   snmpTrapOID.0 - ('1.3.6.1.6.3.1.1.4.1.0', OBJECT_IDENTIFIER, $oid)

       A true value is returned when the method is successful. The undefined value is returned  when  a  failure
       has  occurred.   The error() method can be used to determine the cause of the failure. Since there are no
       acknowledgements for SNMPv2-Trap-PDUs, there is no way to determine if the remote host actually  received
       the snmpV2-trap.

       <b>NOTE:</b>  When  the  object  is  in  non-blocking  mode, the snmpV2-trap is not sent until the event loop is
       entered and no callback is ever executed.

       <b>NOTE:</b> This method can only be used when the version of the object is set  to  SNMPv2c.   SNMPv2-Trap-PDUs
       are  supported  by SNMPv3, but require the sender of the message to be an authoritative SNMP engine which
       is not currently supported by the Net::SNMP module.

   <b>get_table()</b> <b>-</b> <b>retrieve</b> <b>a</b> <b>table</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>remote</b> <b>agent</b>
          $result = $session-&gt;get_table(

                              );

       This method performs repeated SNMP get-next-request or get-bulk-request (when using  SNMPv2c  or  SNMPv3)
       queries to gather data from the remote agent on the host associated with the Net::SNMP object.  The first
       message sent is built using the OBJECT IDENTIFIER in dotted notation passed to the method by the <b>-baseoid</b>
       argument.    Repeated SNMP requests are issued until the OBJECT IDENTIFIER in the response is no longer a
       child of the base OBJECT IDENTIFIER.

       The <b>-maxrepetitions</b> argument can be used to specify the max-repetitions value that is passed to the  get-
       bulk-requests when using SNMPv2c or SNMPv3.  If this argument is not present, a value is calculated based
       on  the  maximum  message  size  for  the  Net::SNMP object.  If the value is set to 1 or less, get-next-
       requests will be used for the queries instead of get-bulk-requests.

       A reference to a hash is returned in blocking mode which contains the contents of  the  VarBindList.   In
       non-blocking  mode,  a  true value is returned when no error has occurred.  In either mode, the undefined
       value is returned when an error has occurred.  The error() method may be used to determine the  cause  of
       the failure.

       <b>WARNING:</b>  Results  from  this  method can become very large if the base OBJECT IDENTIFIER is close to the
       root of the SNMP MIB tree.

   <b>get_entries()</b> <b>-</b> <b>retrieve</b> <b>table</b> <b>entries</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>remote</b> <b>agent</b>

                              );

       This method performs repeated SNMP get-next-request or get-bulk-request (when using  SNMPv2c  or  SNMPv3)
       queries  to  gather  data  from  the remote agent on the host associated with the Net::SNMP object.  Each
       message specifically requests data for each OBJECT IDENTIFIER  specified  in  the  <b>-columns</b>  array.   The
       OBJECT  IDENTIFIERs  must correspond to column entries for a conceptual row in a table.  They may however
       be columns in different tables as long as each table is indexed the same way.  The  optional  <b>-startindex</b>
       and <b>-endindex</b> arguments may be specified to limit the query to specific rows in the table(s).

       The  <b>-startindex</b> can be specified as a single decimal value or in dotted notation if the index associated
       with the entry so requires.  If the <b>-startindex</b> is specified, it will be include as  part  of  the  query
       results.   If  no  <b>-startindex</b> is specified, the first request message will be sent without an index.  To
       insure that the <b>-startindex</b> is included, the last sub-identifier in the index is decremented by one.   If
       the last sub-identifier has a value of zero, the sub-identifier is removed from the index.

       The optional <b>-endindex</b> argument can be specified as a single decimal value or in dotted notation.  If the
       <b>-endindex</b>  is specified, it will be included as part of the query results.  If no <b>-endindex</b> is specified,
       repeated SNMP requests are issued until the response no  longer  returns  entries  matching  any  of  the
       columns specified in the <b>-columns</b> array.

       The  <b>-maxrepetitions</b> argument can be used to specify the max-repetitions value that is passed to the get-
       bulk-requests when using SNMPv2c or SNMPv3.  If this argument is not present, a value is calculated based
       on the maximum message size of the object and the number of columns specified in the <b>-columns</b> array.   If
       the  value  is  set  to  1  or  less, get-next-requests will be used for the queries instead of get-bulk-
       requests.

       A reference to a hash is returned in blocking mode which contains the contents of  the  VarBindList.   In
       non-blocking  mode,  a  true value is returned when no error has occurred.  In either mode, the undefined
       value is returned when an error has occurred.  The error() method may be used to determine the  cause  of
       the failure.

   <b>version()</b> <b>-</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>SNMP</b> <b>version</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>object</b>
          $rfc_version = $session-&gt;version();

       This  method  returns  the  current  value for the SNMP version associated with the object.  The returned
       value is the corresponding version number defined by the RFCs for the protocol version field (i.e. SNMPv1
       == 0, SNMPv2c == 1, and SNMPv3 == 3).  The RFC versions are defined as constant by the module and can  be
       exported by request (see "EXPORTS").

   <b>error()</b> <b>-</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>error</b> <b>message</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>object</b>
          $error_message = $session-&gt;error();

       This  method returns a text string explaining the reason for the last error.  An empty string is returned
       if no error has occurred.

   <b>hostname()</b> <b>-</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>hostname</b> <b>associated</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>object</b>
          $hostname = $session-&gt;hostname();

       This method returns the parsed hostname string that is associated with the object.  Any port  information
       and  formatting  that  can  be  included  with  the  corresponding session() constructor argument will be
       stripped and not included as part of the returned string.

   <b>error_status()</b> <b>-</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>SNMP</b> <b>error-status</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>object</b>
          $error_status = $session-&gt;error_status();

       This method returns the numeric value of the error-status contained in the last SNMP message received  by
       the object.

   <b>error_index()</b> <b>-</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>SNMP</b> <b>error-index</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>object</b>
          $error_index = $session-&gt;error_index();

       This  method  returns the numeric value of the error-index contained in the last SNMP message received by
       the object.

   <b>var_bind_list()</b> <b>-</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>hash</b> <b>reference</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>VarBindList</b> <b>values</b>
          $values = $session-&gt;var_bind_list();

       This method returns a hash reference created using the ObjectName  and  the  ObjectSyntax  pairs  in  the
       VarBindList  of the last SNMP message received by the object.  The keys of the hash consist of the OBJECT
       IDENTIFIERs in dotted notation corresponding to each ObjectName in the VarBindList.  If any of the OBJECT
       IDENTIFIERs passed to the request method began with a leading dot, all of the OBJECT IDENTIFIER hash keys
       will be prefixed with a leading dot.  If duplicate OBJECT IDENTIFIERs are present in the VarBindList they
       will be padded with spaces to make them an unique hash key.  The value of each hash entry is set equal to
       the value of the corresponding ObjectSyntax.  The undefined  value  is  returned  if  there  has  been  a
       failure.

   <b>var_bind_names()</b> <b>-</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>array</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ObjectNames</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>VarBindList</b>
          @names = $session-&gt;var_bind_names();

       This  method  returns  an array containing the OBJECT IDENTIFIERs corresponding to the ObjectNames in the
       VarBindList in the order that they were received in the last SNMP message.  The entries in the array will
       map directly to the keys in the hash  reference  returned  by  the  methods  that  perform  SNMP  message
       exchanges  and  by  the  var_bind_list()  and  var_bind_types()  methods.   The  array  returned  for the
       convenience methods get_table() and get_entries() will be in lexicographical order.  An  empty  array  is
       returned if there has been a failure.

   <b>var_bind_types()</b> <b>-</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>hash</b> <b>reference</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>VarBindList</b> <b>ASN.1</b> <b>types</b>
          $types = $session-&gt;var_bind_types();

       This  method returns a hash reference created using the ObjectName and the ASN.1 type of the ObjectSyntax
       in the VarBindList of the last SNMP message received by the object.  The keys of the hash consist of  the
       OBJECT  IDENTIFIERs in dotted notation corresponding to each ObjectName in the VarBindList.  The value of
       each hash entry is set equal to the ASN.1 type of the  corresponding  ObjectSyntax.   Constants  for  the
       supported  ASN.1 types have been defined and are exported by the package by default (see "EXPORTS").  The
       undefined value is returned if there has been a failure.

   <b>timeout()</b> <b>-</b> <b>set</b> <b>or</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>timeout</b> <b>period</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>object</b>
          $seconds = $session-&gt;timeout([$seconds]);

       This method returns the current value for the Transport Layer timeout for  the  Net::SNMP  object.   This
       value  is  the  number  of  seconds that the object will wait for a response from the agent on the remote
       host.  The default timeout is 5.0 seconds.

       If a parameter is specified, the timeout for the object is set to the provided value if it  falls  within
       the  range 1.0 to 60.0 seconds.  The undefined value is returned upon an error and the error() method may
       be used to determine the cause.

   <b>retries()</b> <b>-</b> <b>set</b> <b>or</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>retry</b> <b>count</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>object</b>
          $count = $session-&gt;retries([$count]);

       This method returns the current value for the number of times to retry sending  a  SNMP  message  to  the
       remote host.  The default number of retries is 1.

       If  a  parameter  is  specified,  the number of retries for the object is set to the provided value if it
       falls within the range 0 to 20. The undefined value is returned upon an error and the error() method  may
       be used to determine the cause.

   <b>max_msg_size()</b> <b>-</b> <b>set</b> <b>or</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>maxMsgSize</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>object</b>
          $octets = $session-&gt;max_msg_size([$octets]);

       This method returns the current value for the maximum message size (maxMsgSize) for the Net::SNMP object.
       This  value  is  the largest message size in octets that can be prepared or processed by the object.  The
       default maxMsgSize is 1472 octets for UDP/IPv4, 1452 octets for UDP/IPv6, 1460 octets for  TCP/IPv4,  and
       1440 octets for TCP/IPv6.

       If a parameter is specified, the maxMsgSize is set to the provided value if it falls within the range 484
       to  65535  octets.   The  undefined value is returned upon an error and the error() method may be used to
       determine the cause.

       <b>NOTE:</b> When using SNMPv3, the maxMsgSize is actually contained in the SNMP message  (as  msgMaxSize).   If
       the  value  received  from a remote device is less than the current maxMsgSize, the size is automatically
       adjusted to be the lower value.

   <b>translate()</b> <b>-</b> <b>enable</b> <b>or</b> <b>disable</b> <b>the</b> <b>translation</b> <b>mode</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>object</b>
          $mask = $session-&gt;translate([
                               $mode |
                               [ # Perl anonymous ARRAY reference
                                  ['-all'            =&gt; $mode0,]
                                  ['-octetstring'    =&gt; $mode1,]
                                  ['-null'           =&gt; $mode2,]
                                  ['-timeticks'      =&gt; $mode3,]
                                  ['-opaque'         =&gt; $mode4,]
                                  ['-nosuchobject'   =&gt; $mode5,]
                                  ['-nosuchinstance' =&gt; $mode6,]
                                  ['-endofmibview'   =&gt; $mode7,]
                                  ['-unsigned'       =&gt; $mode8]
                               ]
                            ]);

       When the object decodes the GetResponse-PDU that is returned in  response  to  a  SNMP  message,  certain
       values are translated into a more "human readable" form.  By default the following translations occur:

       •   OCTET  STRINGs  and  Opaques containing any octet which is not part of the character set defined as a
           DisplayString in RFC 2679 are converted into a hexadecimal representation prefixed  with  "0x".   The
           control  codes  <a href="../man0x00/NUL.0x00.html">NUL</a>(0x00),  <a href="../man0x07/BEL.0x07.html">BEL</a>(0x07), <a href="../man0x08/BS.0x08.html">BS</a>(0x08), <a href="../man0x09/HT.0x09.html">HT</a>(0x09), <a href="../man0x0A/LF.0x0A.html">LF</a>(0x0A), <a href="../man0x0b/VT.0x0b.html">VT</a>(0x0b), <a href="../man0x0C/FF.0x0C.html">FF</a>(0x0C), and <a href="../man0x0D/CR.0x0D.html">CR</a>(0x0D)
           are part of the character set and will not trigger translation.  The sequence 'CR x' for any x  other
           than LF or NUL is illegal and will trigger translation.

       •   TimeTicks integer values are converted to a time format.

       •   NULL values return the string "NULL" instead of an empty string.

       •   noSuchObject exception values return the string "noSuchObject" instead of an empty string.

       •   noSuchInstance exception values return the string "noSuchInstance" instead of an empty string.

       •   endOfMibView exception values return the string "endOfMibView" instead of an empty string.

       •   Counter64,  Counter, Gauge, and TimeTick values that have been incorrectly encoded as signed negative
           values are returned as unsigned values.

       The translate() method can be invoked with two different types of arguments.

       If the argument passed is any Perl variable type except an array reference, the translation mode for  all
       ASN.1  types  is  set to either enabled or disabled, depending on the value of the passed parameter.  Any
       value that Perl would treat as a true value will set the mode to be enabled for all types, while a  false
       value will disable translation for all types.

       A  reference  to an array can be passed to the translate() method in order to define the translation mode
       on a per ASN.1 type basis.  The array is expected to contain a list of  named  argument  pairs  for  each
       ASN.1  type  that  is  to  be modified.  The arguments in the list are applied in the order that they are
       passed in via the array.  Arguments at the end of the list supersede those passed earlier  in  the  list.
       The  argument  "-all"  can  be  used  to  specify that the mode is to apply to all ASN.1 types.  Only the
       arguments for the ASN.1 types that are to be modified need to be included in the list.

       The translate() method returns a bit mask indicating which ASN.1 types are to be translated.  Definitions
       of the bit to ASN.1 type mappings can  be  exported  using  the  <u>:translate</u>  tag  (see  "EXPORTS").   The
       undefined value is returned upon an error and the error() method may be used to determine the cause.

   <b>debug()</b> <b>-</b> <b>set</b> <b>or</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>debug</b> <b>mode</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>module</b>
          $mask = $session-&gt;debug([$mask]);

       This method is used to enable or disable debugging for the Net::SNMP module.  Debugging can be enabled on
       a  per  component level as defined by a bit mask passed to the debug() method.  The bit mask is broken up
       as follows:

       •   0x02 - Message or PDU encoding and decoding

       •   0x04 - Transport Layer

       •   0x08 - Dispatcher

       •   0x10 - Message Processing

       •   0x20 - Security

       Symbols representing these bit mask values are defined by the module and can be exported using the <u>:debug</u>
       tag (see "EXPORTS").  If a non-numeric value is passed to the debug() method, it is evaluated in  boolean
       context.   Debugging  for  all of the components is then enabled or disabled based on the resulting truth
       value.

       The current debugging mask is returned by the method.  Debugging can also  be  enabled  using  the  stand
       alone function snmp_debug(). This function can be exported by request (see "EXPORTS").

</pre><h4><b>SUBROUTINES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>oid_base_match()</b> <b>-</b> <b>determine</b> <b>if</b> <b>an</b> <b>OID</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>specified</b> <b>OID</b> <b>base</b>
          $value = oid_base_match($base_oid, $oid);

       This  function takes two OBJECT IDENTIFIERs in dotted notation and returns a true value (i.e. 0x1) if the
       second OBJECT IDENTIFIER is equal to or is a child of the first OBJECT IDENTIFIER in the SNMP  Management
       Information  Base  (MIB).   This  function  can  be  used in conjunction with the "get-next-request()" or
       "get-bulk-request()" methods to determine when a OBJECT IDENTIFIER in the GetResponse-PDU is no longer in
       the desired MIB tree branch.

   <b>oid_lex_cmp()</b> <b>-</b> <b>compare</b> <b>two</b> <b>OBJECT</b> <b>IDENTIFIERs</b> <b>lexicographically</b>
          $cmp = oid_lex_cmp($oid1, $oid2);

       This function takes two OBJECT IDENTIFIERs in dotted notation and returns one of the values 1, 0,  -1  if
       $oid1 is respectively lexicographically greater, equal, or less than $oid2.

   <b>oid_lex_sort()</b> <b>-</b> <b>sort</b> <b>a</b> <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>OBJECT</b> <b>IDENTIFIERs</b> <b>lexicographically</b>
          @sorted_oids = oid_lex_sort(@oids);

       This  function  takes  a  list  of OBJECT IDENTIFIERs in dotted notation and returns the listed sorted in
       lexicographical order.

   <b>snmp_type_ntop()</b> <b>-</b> <b>convert</b> <b>an</b> <b>ASN.1</b> <b>type</b> <b>to</b> <b>presentation</b> <b>format</b>
          $text = snmp_type_ntop($type);

       This function takes an ASN.1 type octet and returns a text string suitable for presentation.  Some  ASN.1
       type  definitions map to the same octet value when encoded.  This method cannot distinguish between these
       multiple mappings and the most basic type name will be returned.

   <b>ticks_to_time()</b> <b>-</b> <b>convert</b> <b>TimeTicks</b> <b>to</b> <b>formatted</b> <b>time</b>
          $time = ticks_to_time($timeticks);

       This function takes an ASN.1 TimeTicks value and returns a string representing the time  defined  by  the
       value.   The  TimeTicks  value  is  expected  to be a non-negative integer value representing the time in
       hundredths of a second since some epoch.  The returned string will display the time in days,  hours,  and
       seconds format according to the value of the TimeTicks argument.

       This  example  gets  the  contents of the ifTable by sending get-bulk-requests until the responses are no
       longer part of the ifTable.  The ifTable can  also  be  retrieved  using  the  get_table()  method.   The
       ifPhysAddress  object  in  the table has a syntax of an OCTET STRING.  By default, translation is enabled
       and non-printable OCTET STRINGs are translated into a hexadecimal format.   Sometimes  the  OCTET  STRING
       contains  all  printable  characters  and this produces unexpected output when it is not translated.  The
       example turns off translation for OCTET STRINGs and specifically formats the output for the ifPhysAddress
       objects.

</pre><h4><b>REQUIREMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       •   The Net::SNMP module uses syntax that is not supported in versions of Perl earlier than v5.6.0.

       •   The non-core modules <u>Crypt::DES</u>, <u>Digest::MD5</u>, and <u>Digest::HMAC</u> are required to support SNMPv3.

       •   In order to support the AES Cipher Algorithm as  a  SNMPv3  privacy  protocol,  the  non-core  module
           <u>Crypt::Rijndael</u> is needed.

       •   To use UDP/IPv6 or TCP/IPv6 as a Transport Domain, the non-core module <u>Socket6</u> is needed.
