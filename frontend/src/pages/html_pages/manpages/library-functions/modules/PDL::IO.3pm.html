</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       PDL::IO - An overview of some modules in the PDL::IO namespace.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        # At your system shell, type:
        perldoc PDL::IO

        # from perldl:
        pdl&gt; ?? PDL::IO

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       PDL contains many modules for displaying, loading, and saving data.  This list may be incomplete, if
       others make new ones.

       •   Perlish or Text-Based

           A   few   IO   modules   provide   Perl-inspired   capabilities.    These   are  PDL::IO::Dumper  and
           PDL::IO::Storable.  PDL::IO::Misc provides simpler routines for dealing with delimited files,  though
           its capabilities are limited to tabular or at most 3-d data sets.

       •   Raw Format

           PDL  has  two  modules  that  store  their data in a raw binary format; they are PDL::IO::FastRaw and
           PDL::IO::FlexRaw.  They are fast but the files they produce will not  be  readable  across  different
           architectures.  These two modules are so similar that they could probably be combined.

           You can also directly access the data from Perl using "get_dataref" in PDL::Core.

       •   Image Handling

           PDL  has  a  handful  of  modules  that  will  load  images  into  ndarrays  for  you.   They include
           PDL::IO::Dicom, PDL::IO::FITS, PDL::IO::GD, PDL::IO::Pic, and PDL::IO::Pnm.   However,  PDL::IO::FITS
           should also be considered something of a general data format.

       •   Disk Caching

           Both  PDL::IO::FastRaw  and PDL::IO::FlexRaw provide for direct ndarray-to-disk mapping, but they use
           PDL's underlying mmap functionality to do it, and that doesn't work for Windows.  However,  users  of
           all  operating  systems  can  still  use  PDL::DiskCache,  which  can  use  any desired IO read/write
           functionality (though you may have to write a small wrapper function).

       •   General Data Storage Formats

           PDL has a number of modules that interface general data storage libraries.  They include PDL::IO::HDF
           and PDL::IO::NDF (the latter is now a separate CPAN module).  There is  PDL::IO::IDL.   PDL::IO::FITS
           is  something of a general data format, since ndarray data can be stored to a FITS file without loss.
           PDL::IO::FlexRaw and PDL::IO::FastRaw read and write data identical C's  low-level  "write"  function
           and  PDL::IO::FlexRaw  can  work  with  FORTRAN  77  UNFORMATTED files.  FlexRaw and Storable provide
           general data storage capabilities.  Finally, PDL can read Grib (weather-data) files  using  the  CPAN
           module PDL::IO::Grib.

       •   Making Movies

           You can make an MPEG animation using PDL::IO::Pic's wmpeg function.

       Here's a brief summary of all of the modules, in alphabetical order.

   <b>PDL::DiskCache</b>
       The  DiskCache module allows you to tie a Perl array to a collection of files on your disk, which will be
       loaded into and out of memory as ndarrays.  Although the module defaults to working with FITS  files,  it
       allows  you to specify your own reading and writing functions.  This allows you to vastly streamline your
       code by hiding the unnecessary details of loading and saving files.

       If you find yourself writing scripts to procss many data files, especially if that data processing is not
       necessarily in sequential order, you should consider using  PDL::DiskCache.   To  read  more,  check  the
       PDL::DiskCache documentation.

   <b>PDL::IO::Dicom</b>
       DICOM  is an image format, and this module allows you to read image files with the DICOM file format.  To
       read more, check the PDL::IO::Dicom documentation.

   <b>PDL::IO::Dumper</b>
       Provides functionality similar to Data::Dumper for ndarrays.  Data::Dumper stringifies a data  structure,
       creating  a  string  that  can  be  "eval"ed to reproduce the original data structure.  It's also usually
       suitable for printing, to visualize the structure.

       To  read  more,  check  the  PDL::IO::Dumper  documentation.   See  also  PDL::IO::Storable  for  a  more
       comprehensive structured data solution.

   <b>PDL::IO::FastRaw</b>
       Very simple module for quickly writing, reading, and memory-mapping ndarrays to/from disk.  It is fast to
       learn  and  fast to use, though you may be frustrated by its lack of options.  To quote from the original
       POD:

       "The binary files are in general NOT interchangeable between different  architectures  since  the  binary
       file is simply dumped from the memory region of the ndarray.  This is what makes the approach efficient."

       This creates two files for every ndarray saved - one that stores the raw data and another that stores the
       header  file,  which  indicates the dimensions of the data stored in the raw file.  Even if you save 1000
       different ndarrays with the exact same dimensions, you will still need to write out  a  header  file  for
       each one.  You cannot store multiple ndarrays in one file.

       Note that at the time of writing, memory-mapping is not possible on Windows.

       For more details, see PDL::IO::FastRaw.  For a more flexible raw IO module, see PDL::IO::FlexRaw.

   <b>PDL::IO::FITS</b>
       Allows  basic  reading  and  writing  of  FITS  files.   You  can read more about FITS formatted files at
       &lt;<a href="http://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov/fits_intro.html">http://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov/fits_intro.html</a>&gt; and  &lt;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FITS">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FITS</a>&gt;.   It  is  an  image
       format commonly used in Astronomy.

       This  module  may  or  may  not  be  installed on your machine.  To get more information, check online at
       &lt;<a href="http://pdl.perl.org/">http://pdl.perl.org/</a>?docs=IO/FITS&amp;title=PDL::IO::FITS&gt;.  To see if the module  is  installed,  look  for
       PDL::IO::FITS on your machine by typing at the system prompt:

        perldoc PDL::IO::FITS

   <b>PDL::IO::FlexRaw</b>
       Somewhat  smarter module (compared to FastRaw) for reading, writing, and memory mapping ndarrays to disk.
       In addition to everything that FastRaw can do, FlexRaw can also store multiple ndarrays in a single file,
       take user-specified headers (so you can use one header  file  for  multiple  files  that  have  identical
       structure),  and  read  compressed data.  However, FlexRaw cannot memory-map compressed data, and just as
       with FastRaw, the format will not work across multiple architectures.

       FlexRaw and FastRaw produce  identical  raw  files  and  have  essentially  identical  performance.   Use
       whichever  module  seems to be more comfortable.  I would generally recommend using FlexRaw over FastRaw,
       but the differences are minor for most uses.

       Note that at the time of writing, memory-mapping is not possible on Windows.

       For more details on FlexRaw, see PDL::IO::FlexRaw.

   <b>PDL::IO::GD</b>
       GD is a library for reading, creating, and writing bitmapped images, written in C.   You  can  read  more
       about the C-library here: &lt;<a href="http://www.libgd.org/">http://www.libgd.org/</a>&gt;.

       In  addition  to  reading and writing .png and .jpeg files, GD allows you to modify the bitmap by drawing
       rectangles, adding text, and probably much more.  The documentation can  be  found  here.   As  such,  it
       should probably be not only considered an IO module, but a Graphics module as well.

       This module provides PDL bindings for the GD library, which ought not be confused with the Perl bindings.
       The  perl  bindings  were  developed independently and can be found at GD, if you have Perl's GD bindings
       installed.

   <b>PDL::IO::Grib</b>
       A CPAN module last updated in 2000 that allows you to read Grib files.  GRIB is a  data  format  commonly
       used  in  meteorology.   In  the  off-chance  that you have it installed, you should read PDL::IO::Grib's
       documentation.

   <b>PDL::IO::HDF,</b> <b>PDL::IO::HDF5</b>
       Provides an interface to HDF4 and HDF5 file formats, which  are  kinda  like  cross-platform  binary  XML
       files.  HDF stands for <b>H</b>ierarchical <b>D</b>ata <b>F</b>ormat.  HDF was originally developed at the NCSA.  To read more
       about  HDF,  see  &lt;<a href="http://www.hdfgroup.org/">http://www.hdfgroup.org/</a>&gt;.   Note that HDF5 is not presently distributed with PDL, and
       neither HDF4 nor HDF5 will be installed unless you have the associated C  libraries  that  these  modules
       interface.   Also  note  that  the HDF5 library on CPAN is rather old and somebody from HDF contacted the
       mailing list in the Fall of 2009 to develop new and better HDF5 bindings for Perl.

       You should look into the PDL::IO::HDF (4) documentation or PDL::IO::HDF5  documentation,  depending  upon
       which module you have installed.

   <b>PDL::IO::IDL</b>
       PDL has a module for reading IDL data files: PDL::IO::IDL.

   <b>PDL::IO::Misc</b>
       Provides mostly text-based IO routines.  Data input and output is restricted mostly to tabular (i.e. two-
       dimensional) data sets, though limited support is provided for 3d data sets.

       Alternative  text-based modules support higher dimensions, such as PDL::IO::Dumper and PDL::IO::Storable.
       Check the PDL::IO::Misc documentation for more details.

   <b>PDL::IO::NDF</b>
       Starlink developed a file format for N-Dimensional data Files, which it cleverly dubbed NDF.  If you work
       with these files, you're in luck!  Check the PDL::IO::NDF documentation for more details.

   <b>PDL::IO::Pic</b>
       Provides reading/writing of images to/from ndarrays, as well as creating  MPEG  animations!   The  module
       uses  the netpbm library, so you will need that on your machine in order for this to work.  To read more,
       see the PDL::IO::Pic documentation.  Also look into the next module, as well as PDL::IO::GD.

   <b>PDL::IO::Pnm</b>
       Provides methods for reading and writing pnm files (of which pbm is but  one).   Check  the  PDL::IO::Pnm
       documentation for more details.  Also check out the previous module and PDL::IO::GD.

   <b>PDL::IO::STL</b>
       Read and write STL (STereo Lithography) files, containing 3D objects. There are many files available from
       the "Thingiverse". You can then view the data in PDL::Graphics::TriD.

   <b>PDL::IO::Storable</b>
       Implements  the  relevant  methods to be able to store and retrieve ndarrays via Storable.  True, you can
       use many methods to save a single ndarray.  In contrast, this module is particularly useful if  you  need
       to  save  a  complex  Perl  structure  that  contain  ndarrays, such as an array of hashes, each of which
       contains ndarrays.

       Check the PDL::IO::Storable documentation for more details.  See also PDL::IO::Dumper for an  alternative
       stringifier.

</pre><h4><b>Out-of-tree</b> <b>Third-party</b> <b>Modules</b></h4><pre>
   <b>PDL::IO::CSV</b>
       Load/save PDL from/to CSV file (optimized for speed and large data).

       See the PDL::IO::CSV documentation.

   <b>PDL::IO::DBI</b>
       Load PDL from a DBI handle. See PDL::IO::CSV.

   <b>PDL::IO::Dcm</b>
       Load PDL from a Dicom file. See PDL::IO::Dcm.

   <b>PDL::IO::Touchstone</b>
       A  simple  interface for reading and writing RF Touchstone files (also known as ".sNp" files). Touchstone
       files contain complex-valued RF sample data for a device or RF component with some number of  ports.  The
       data is (typically) measured by a vector network analyzer under stringent test conditions.

       The  resulting  files  are  usually  provided by manufacturers so RF design engineers can estimate signal
       behavior at various frequencies in their circuit designs. Examples of RF components  include  capacitors,
       inductors, resistors, filters, power splitters, etc.

       See the PDL::IO::Touchstone documentation.

   <b>PDL::IO::MDIF</b>
       A  simple  interface  for reading and writing RF MDIF files (also known as MDF or .mdf files). MDIF files
       contain multiple Touchstone files in a text format for use in optimizing circuits. For example, a  single
       MDIF file could contain the Touchstone RF data for each available value in a line of capacitors (ie, from
       10pF to 1000pF) provided by a particular manufacturer.

       See the PDL::IO::MDIF documentation

   <b>PDL::IO::Image</b>
       Load/save PDL from/to image files. See PDL::IO::Image.

   <b>PDL::IO::XLSX</b>
       Load/save PDL from/to an Excel spreadsheet. See PDL::IO::XLSX.

   <b>PDL::NetCDF</b>
       Load/save PDL from/to NetCDF files. See PDL::NetCDF.

   <b>PDL::IO::Nifti</b>
       Load/save PDL from/to Nifti-1 files. See PDL::IO::Nifti.

   <b>PDL::IO::Matlab</b>
       Load/save PDL from/to MATLAB files. See PDL::IO::Matlab.

   <b>PDL::IO::Sereal</b>
       Load/save PDL from/to Sereal files. See PDL::IO::Sereal.

   <b>PDL::CCS</b>
       Has  IO  modules  to load/save PDL from/to sparse data file formats, including FITS, LDA-C, MatrixMarket,
       PETSc. See PDL::CCS.
