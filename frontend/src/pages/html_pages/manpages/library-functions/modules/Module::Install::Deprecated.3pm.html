</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Module::Install::Deprecated - Warnings and help for deprecated commands

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       One of the nicest features of Module::Install is that as it improves, there is no need to take into
       account user compatibility, because users do not need to install Module::Install itself.

       As a result, the Module::Install API changes at a faster rate than usual, and this results in deprecated
       commands.

       "Module::Install::Deprecated" provides implementations of the deprecated commands, so that when an author
       is upgrading their Module::Install and they are using a deprecated command they will be told that the
       command has been deprecated, and what the author should use instead.

       This extension should NEVER end up bundled into the distribution tarball.

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>c_files</b>
       The "c_files" command has been changed to "cc_files" to reduce confusion and keep all compiler commands
       within a consistent "ff_foo" naming scheme.

   <b>inc_paths</b>
       The "inc_paths" command has been changed to "cc_inc_paths" due to confusion between Perl and C.

   <b>lib_paths</b>
       The "lib_paths" command has been changed to "cc_lib_paths" due to confusion between Perl and C.

   <b>lib_links</b>
       The "lib_links" command has been changed to "cc_lib_links" due to confusion between Perl and C.

   <b>optimize_flags</b>
       The "optimize_flags" command has been changed to "cc_optimize_flags" for consistency reasons.
