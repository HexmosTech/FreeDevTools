       Test::Needs - Skip tests when modules not available

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         # need one module
         use Test::Needs 'Some::Module';

         # need multiple modules
         use Test::Needs 'Some::Module', 'Some::Other::Module';

         # need a given version of a module
         use Test::Needs {
           'Some::Module' =&gt; '1.005',
         };

         # check later
         use Test::Needs;
         test_needs 'Some::Module';

         # skips remainder of subtest
         use Test::More;
         use Test::Needs;
         subtest 'my subtest' =&gt; sub {
           test_needs 'Some::Module';
           ...
         };

         # check perl version
         use Test::Needs { perl =&gt; 5.020 };

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Skip test scripts if modules are not available.  The requested modules will be loaded, and optionally
       have their versions checked.  If the module is missing, the test script will be skipped.  Modules that
       are found but fail to compile will exit with an error rather than skip.

       If used in a subtest, the remainder of the subtest will be skipped.

       Skipping will work even if some tests have already been run, or if a plan has been declared.

       Versions are checked via a "$module-&gt;VERSION($wanted_version)" call.  Versions must be provided in a
       format that will be accepted.  No extra processing is done on them.

       If "perl" is used as a module, the version is checked against the running perl version ($]).  The version
       can be specified as a number, dotted-decimal string, v-string, or version object.

       If the "RELEASE_TESTING" environment variable is set, the tests will fail rather than skip.  Subtests
       will be aborted, but the test script will continue running after that point.

</pre><h4><b>EXPORTS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>test_needs</b>
       Has the same interface as when using Test::Needs in a "use".

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       Test::Requires
           A  similar  module,  with  some  important differences.  Test::Requires will act as a "use" statement
           (despite its name), calling the import sub.  Under "RELEASE_TESTING", it will BAIL_OUT  if  a  module
           fails  to  load  rather  than  using a normal test fail.  It also doesn't distinguish between missing
           modules and broken modules.

       Test2::Require::Module
           Part of the Test2 ecosystem.  Only supports running as a "use" command to skip an entire plan.

       Test2::Require::Perl
           Part of the Test2 ecosystem.  Only supports running as a  "use"  command  to  skip  an  entire  plan.
           Checks perl versions.

       Test::If
           Acts  as  a  "use"  statement.  Only supports running as a "use" command to skip an entire plan.  Can
           skip based on subref results.
