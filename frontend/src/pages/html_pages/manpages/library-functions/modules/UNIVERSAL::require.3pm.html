</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       UNIVERSAL::require - require() modules from a variable [deprecated]

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         # This only needs to be said once in your program.
         require UNIVERSAL::require;

         # Same as "require Some::Module"
         my $module = 'Some::Module';
         $module-&gt;require or die $@;

         # Same as "use Some::Module"
         BEGIN { $module-&gt;use or die $@ }

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Before using this module, you should look at the alternatives, some of which are listed in SEE ALSO
       below.

       This module provides a safe mechanism for loading a module at runtime, when you have the name of the
       module in a variable.

       If you've ever had to do this...

           eval "require $module";

       to get around the bareword caveats on <b>require()</b>, this module is for you.  It creates a universal
       <b>require()</b> class method that will work with every Perl module and its secure.  So instead of doing some
       arcane <b>eval()</b> work, you can do this:

           $module-&gt;require;

       It doesn't save you much typing, but it'll make a lot more sense to someone who's not a ninth level Perl
       acolyte.

</pre><h4><b>Methods</b></h4><pre>
       <u>require</u>

         my $return_val = $module-&gt;require           or die $@;
         my $return_val = $module-&gt;require($version) or die $@;

       This works exactly like Perl's require, except without the bareword restriction, and it doesn't die.
       Since <b>require()</b> is placed in the UNIVERSAL namespace, it will work on <b>any</b> module.  You just have to use
       UNIVERSAL::require somewhere in your code.

       Should the module require fail, or not be a high enough $version, it will simply return false and <b>not</b>
       <b>die</b>.  The error will be in $@ as well as $UNIVERSAL::require::ERROR.

           $module-&gt;require or die $@;

       <u>use</u>

           my $require_return = $module-&gt;use           or die $@;
           my $require_return = $module-&gt;use(@imports) or die $@;

       Like "UNIVERSAL::require", this allows you to "use" a $module without having to eval to work around the
       bareword requirement.  It returns the same as require.

       Should either the require or the import fail it will return false.  The error will be in $@.

       If possible, call this inside a BEGIN block to emulate a normal "use" as closely as possible.

           BEGIN { $module-&gt;use }

</pre><h4><b>SECURITY</b> <b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       UNIVERSAL::require makes use of "eval STRING".  In previous versions of UNIVERSAL::require it was
       discovered that one could craft a class name which would result in code being executed.  This hole has
       been closed.  The only variables now exposed to "eval STRING" are the caller's package, filename and line
       which are not tainted.

       UNIVERSAL::require is taint clean.

       Module::Load provides functions for loading code, and importing functions.  It's actively maintained.

       Module::Runtime provides a number of usesful functions for require'ing and use'ing modules, and
       associated operations.

       Mojo::Loader is a class loader and plugin framework.  Module::Loader is a stand-alone module that was
       inspired by "Mojo::Loader".

       There are many other modules that may be of interest on CPAN.  An old review of some of them can be read
       at &lt;https://neilb.org/reviews/module-loading.html&gt;.
