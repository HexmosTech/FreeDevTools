</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Perl::Critic::Policy::ValuesAndExpressions::ProhibitComplexVersion - Prohibit version values from outside
       the module.

</pre><h4><b>AFFILIATION</b></h4><pre>
       This Policy is part of the core Perl::Critic distribution.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       One tempting way to keep a group of related modules at the same version number is to have all of them
       import the version number from a designated module. For example, module "Foo::Master" could be the
       version master for the "Foo" package, and all other modules could use its $VERSION by

           use Foo::Master; our $VERSION = $Foo::Master::VERSION;

       This turns out not to be a good idea, because all sorts of unintended things can happen - anything from
       unintended version number changes to denial-of-service attacks (since "Foo::Master" is executed by the
       'use').

       This policy examines statements that assign to $VERSION, and declares a violation under two
       circumstances: first, if that statement uses a fully-qualified symbol that did not originate in a package
       declared in the file; second if there is a "use" statement on the same line that makes the assignment.

       By default, an exception is made for "use version;" because of its recommendation by Perl Best Practices.
       See the "forbid_use_version" configuration variable if you do not want an exception made for "use
       version;".

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       The construction

           use version; our $VERSION = qv('1.2.3');

       is exempt from this policy by default, because it is recommended by Perl Best Practices. Should you wish
       to identify "use version;" as a violation, add the following to your perlcriticrc file:

           [ValuesAndExpressions::ProhibitComplexVersion]
           forbid_use_version = 1

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
       This code assumes that the hallmark of a violation is a 'use' on the same line as the $VERSION
       assignment, because that is the way to have it seen by ExtUtils::MakeMaker-&gt;<b>parse_version()</b>. Other ways
       to get a version value from outside the module can be imagined, and this policy is currently oblivious to
       them.
