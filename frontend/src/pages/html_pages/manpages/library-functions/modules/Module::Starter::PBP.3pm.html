       Module::Starter::PBP - Create a module as recommended in "Perl Best Practices"

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This document describes Module::Starter::PBP version 0.0.3

           # In your  <a href="file:~/.module-starter/config">~/.module-starter/config</a> file...

           plugins: Module::Starter::PBP

           # Then on the command-line...

           &gt; module-starter --module=Your::New::Module

           # Or, if you're lazy and happy to go with

           &gt; perl -MModule::Starter::PBP=setup

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module implements a simple approach to creating modules and their support files, based on the
       Module::Starter approach. Module::Starter needs to be installed before this module can be used.

       When used as a Module::Starter plugin, this module allows you to specify a simple directory of templates
       which are filled in with module-specific information, and thereafter form the basis of your new module.

       The default templates that this module initially provides are based on the recommendations in the book
       "Perl Best Practices".

</pre><h4><b>INTERFACE</b></h4><pre>
       Thsi module simply acts as a plugin for Module::Starter. So it uses the same command-line interface as
       that module.

       The template files it is to use are specified in your Module::Starter "config" file, by adding a
       "template_dir" configuration variable that gives the full path name of the directory in which you want to
       put the templates.

       The easiest way to set up this "config" file, the associated directory, and the necessary template files
       is to type:

           &gt; perl -MModule::Starter::PBP=setup

       on the command line. You will then be asked for your name, email address, and the full path name of the
       directory where you want to keep the templates, after which they will be created and installed.

       Then you can create a new module by typing:

           &gt; module-starter --module=Your::New::Module

   <b>Template</b> <b>format</b>
       The templates are plain files named:

               Build.PL
               Makefile.PL
               README
               Changes
               Module.pm
               t/whatever_you_like.t

       The "Module.pm" file is the template for the ".pm" file for your module. Any files in the "t/"
       subdirectory become the templates for the testing files of your module. All the remaining files are
       templates for the ditribution files of the same names.

       In those files, the following placeholders are replaced by the appropriate information specific to the
       file:

       &lt;AUTHOR&gt;
           The nominated author. Taken from the "author" setting in your Module::Starter "config" file.

       &lt;BUILD INSTRUCTIONS&gt;
           Makefile  or Module::Build instructions. Computed automatically according to the "builder" setting in
           your Module::Starter "config" file.

       &lt;DATE&gt;
           The current date (as returned by "localtime"). Computed automagically

       &lt;DISTRO&gt;
           The name of the complete module distribution. Computed automatically from the name of the module.

       &lt;EMAIL&gt;
           Where to send feedback. Taken from the "email" setting in your Module::Starter "config" file.

       &lt;LICENSE&gt;
           The licence  under  which  the  module  is  released.  Taken  from  the  "license"  setting  in  your
           Module::Starter "config" file.

       &lt;MAIN MODULE&gt;
           The name of the main module of the distribution.

       &lt;MAIN PM FILE&gt;
           The name of the ".pm" file for the main module.

       &lt;MODULE NAME&gt;
           The name of the current module being created within the distribution.

       &lt;RT NAME&gt;
           The name to use for bug reports to the RT system.  That is:

               Please report any bugs or feature requests to
               bug-&lt;RT NAME&gt;@rt.cpan.org&gt;

       &lt;YEAR&gt;
           The current year. Computed automatically

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       "Can't find directory that holds Module::Starter::PBP templates"
           You  did  not  tell  Module::Starter::PBP where your templates are stored.  You need a 'template_dir'
           specification. Typically this would go in your <a href="file:~/.module-starter/config">~/.module-starter/config</a> file. Something like:

               template_dir: /users/you/.module-starter/Templates

       "Can't access Module::Starter::PBP template directory"
           You specified a 'template_dir', but the path didn't lead to a readable directory.

       "The template: %s isn't in the template directory (%s)"
           One of the required templates:

           was missing from the template directory you specified.

       "The template: %s isn't readable in the template directory (%s)"
           One of the templates in the template directory you specified was not readable.

       "Unknown placeholder &lt;%s&gt; in %s"
           One of the templates in the template directory contained a replacement item that wasn't a known piece
           of information.
