       ExtUtils::MakeMaker::Tutorial - Writing a module with MakeMaker

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use ExtUtils::MakeMaker;

           WriteMakefile(
               NAME            =&gt; 'Your::Module',
               VERSION_FROM    =&gt; 'lib/Your/Module.pm'
           );

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This is a short tutorial on writing a simple module with MakeMaker.  It's really not that hard.

   <b>The</b> <b>Mantra</b>
       MakeMaker modules are installed using this simple mantra

               perl Makefile.PL
               make
               make test
               make install

       There are lots more commands and options, but the above will do it.

   <b>The</b> <b>Layout</b>
       The basic files in a module look something like this.

               Makefile.PL
               MANIFEST
               lib/Your/Module.pm

       That's all that's strictly necessary.  There's additional files you might want:

               lib/Your/Other/Module.pm
               t/some_test.t
               t/some_other_test.t
               Changes
               README
               INSTALL
               MANIFEST.SKIP
               bin/some_program

       Makefile.PL
           When you run Makefile.PL, it makes a Makefile.  That's the whole point of MakeMaker.  The Makefile.PL
           is a simple program which loads ExtUtils::MakeMaker and runs the <b>WriteMakefile()</b> function to generate
           a Makefile.

           Here's an example of what you need for a simple module:

               use ExtUtils::MakeMaker;

               WriteMakefile(
                   NAME            =&gt; 'Your::Module',
                   VERSION_FROM    =&gt; 'lib/Your/Module.pm'
               );

           NAME is the top-level namespace of your module.  VERSION_FROM is the file which contains the $VERSION
           variable for the entire distribution.  Typically this is the same as your top-level module.

       MANIFEST
           A simple listing of all the files in your distribution.

                   Makefile.PL
                   MANIFEST
                   lib/Your/Module.pm

           File paths in a MANIFEST always use Unix conventions (ie. /) even if you're not on Unix.

           You can write this by hand or generate it with 'make manifest'.

           See ExtUtils::Manifest for more details.

       lib/
           This  is the directory where the .pm and .pod files you wish to have installed go.  They are laid out
           according to namespace.  So Foo::Bar is <u>lib/Foo/Bar.pm</u>.

       t/  Tests for your modules go here.  Each test filename ends with a .t.  So <u>t/foo.t</u>  'make test' will run
           these tests.

           Typically, the <u>t/</u> test directory is flat, with all test files located directly  within  it.  However,
           you can nest tests within subdirectories, for example:

               t/foo/subdir_test.t

           To do this, you need to inform WriteMakefile() in your <u>Makefile.PL</u> file in the following fashion:

               test =&gt; {TESTS =&gt; 't/*.t t/*/*.t'}

           That  will  run all tests in <u>t/</u>, as well as all tests in all subdirectories that reside under <u>t/</u>. You
           can nest as deeply as makes sense for your project.  Simply add another entry in  the  test  location
           string. For example, to test:

               t/foo/bar/subdir_test.t

           You would use the following "test" directive:

               test =&gt; {TESTS =&gt; 't/*.t t/*/*/*.t'}

           Note  that in the above example, tests in the first subdirectory will not be run. To run all tests in
           the intermediary subdirectory preceding the one the test files are in, you need  to  explicitly  note
           it:

               test =&gt; {TESTS =&gt; 't/*.t t/*/*.t t/*/*/*.t'}

           You  don't  need  to  specify  wildcards if you only want to test within specific subdirectories. The
           following example will only run tests in <u>t/foo</u>:

               test =&gt; {TESTS =&gt; 't/foo/*.t'}

           Tests are run from the top level of your distribution.  So inside a test you would refer to .<a href="file:/lib">/lib</a>  to
           enter the lib directory, for example.

       Changes
           A log of changes you've made to this module.  The layout is free-form.  Here's an example:

               1.01 Fri Apr 11 00:21:25 PDT 2003
                   - thing() does some stuff now
                   - fixed the wiggy bug in withit()

               1.00 Mon Apr  7 00:57:15 PDT 2003
                   - "Rain of Frogs" now supported

       README
           A short description of your module, what it does, why someone would use it and its limitations.  CPAN
           automatically  pulls  your README file out of the archive and makes it available to CPAN users, it is
           the first thing they will read to decide if your module is right for them.

       INSTALL
           Instructions on how to install your module along with any  dependencies.   Suggested  information  to
           include here:

               any extra modules required for use
               the minimum version of Perl required
               if only works on certain operating systems

       MANIFEST.SKIP
           A  file  full  of regular expressions to exclude when using 'make manifest' to generate the MANIFEST.
           These regular expressions are checked against each file path found in  the  distribution  (so  you're
           matching against "t/foo.t" not "foo.t").

           Here's a sample:

               ~$          # ignore emacs and vim backup files
               .bak$       # ignore manual backups
               \#          # ignore CVS old revision files and emacs temp files

           Since # can be used for comments, # must be escaped.

           MakeMaker  comes  with  a  default MANIFEST.SKIP to avoid things like version control directories and
           backup files.  Specifying your own will override this default.
