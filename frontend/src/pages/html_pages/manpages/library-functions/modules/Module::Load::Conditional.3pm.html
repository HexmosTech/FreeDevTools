</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Module::Load::Conditional provides simple ways to query and possibly load any of the modules you have
       installed on your system during runtime.

       It is able to load multiple modules at once or none at all if one of them was not able to load. It also
       takes care of any error checking and so forth.

</pre><h4><b>Methods</b></h4><pre>
   <b>$href</b> <b>=</b> <b>check_install(</b> <b>module</b> <b>=&gt;</b> <b>NAME</b> <b>[,</b> <b>version</b> <b>=&gt;</b> <b>VERSION,</b> <b>verbose</b> <b>=&gt;</b> <b>BOOL</b> <b>]</b> <b>);</b>
       "check_install" allows you to verify if a certain module is installed or not. You may call it with the
       following arguments:

       module
           The name of the module you wish to verify -- this is a required key

       version
           The version this module needs to be -- this is optional

       verbose
           Whether   or   not   to   be   verbose   about   what   it   is   doing   --   it   will  default  to
           $Module::Load::Conditional::VERBOSE

       It will return undef if it was not able to find where the module was installed, or a hash reference  with
       the following keys if it was able to find the file:

       file
           Full path to the file that contains the module

       dir Directory, or more exact the @INC entry, where the module was loaded from.

       version
           The  version  number  of  the  installed  module  -  this  will  be  "undef" if the module had no (or
           unparsable) version number, or if the variable $Module::Load::Conditional::FIND_VERSION  was  set  to
           true.  (See the "GLOBAL VARIABLES" section below for details)

       uptodate
           A  boolean  value  indicating  whether  or  not  the  module was found to be at least the version you
           specified. If you did not specify a version, uptodate will always be true if the  module  was  found.
           If no parsable version was found in the module, uptodate will also be true, since "check_install" had
           no way to verify clearly.

           See also $Module::Load::Conditional::DEPRECATED, which affects the outcome of this value.

   <b>$bool</b>  <b>=</b>  <b>can_load(</b>  <b>modules</b>  <b>=&gt;</b>  <b>{</b>  <b>NAME</b> <b>=&gt;</b> <b>VERSION</b> <b>[,NAME</b> <b>=&gt;</b> <b>VERSION]</b> <b>},</b> <b>[verbose</b> <b>=&gt;</b> <b>BOOL,</b> <b>nocache</b> <b>=&gt;</b> <b>BOOL,</b>
       <b>autoload</b> <b>=&gt;</b> <b>BOOL]</b> <b>)</b>
       "can_load" will take a list of modules, optionally with version numbers and determine if it  is  able  to
       load them. If it can load *ALL* of them, it will. If one or more are unloadable, none will be loaded.

       This  is particularly useful if you have More Than One Way (tm) to solve a problem in a program, and only
       wish to continue down a path if all modules could be loaded, and not load them if they couldn't.

       This function uses the "load" function or the "autoload_remote"  function  from  Module::Load  under  the
       hood.

       "can_load" takes the following arguments:

       modules
           This  is  a hashref of module/version pairs. The version indicates the minimum version to load. If no
           version is provided, any version is assumed to be good enough.

       verbose
           This controls whether warnings should be printed if a module failed to load.  The default is  to  use
           the value of $Module::Load::Conditional::VERBOSE.

       nocache
           "can_load"  keeps  its  results  in  a  cache, so it will not load the same module twice, nor will it
           attempt to load a module that has already failed to load before. By default,  "can_load"  will  check
           its cache, but you can override that by setting "nocache" to true.

       autoload
           This controls whether imports the functions of a loaded modules to the caller package. The default is
           no importing any functions.

           See the "autoload" function and the "autoload_remote" function from Module::Load for details.

   <b>@list</b> <b>=</b> <b>requires(</b> <b>MODULE</b> <b>);</b>
       "requires" can tell you what other modules a particular module requires. This is particularly useful when
       you're intending to write a module for public release and are listing its prerequisites.

       "requires"  takes  but  one  argument: the name of a module.  It will then first check if it can actually
       load this module, and return undef if it can't.  Otherwise, it will return a list of modules and  pragmas
       that would have been loaded on the module's behalf.

       Note: The list "require" returns has originated from your current perl and your current install.

</pre><h4><b>Global</b> <b>Variables</b></h4><pre>
       The behaviour of Module::Load::Conditional can be altered by changing the following global variables:

   <b>$Module::Load::Conditional::VERBOSE</b>
       This  controls  whether  Module::Load::Conditional will issue warnings and explanations as to why certain
       things may have failed. If you set it to 0, Module::Load::Conditional will not output any warnings.   The
       default is 0;

   <b>$Module::Load::Conditional::FIND_VERSION</b>
       This  controls whether Module::Load::Conditional will try to parse (and eval) the version from the module
       you're trying to load.

       If you don't wish to do this, set this variable to "false". Understand then that version comparisons  are
       not  possible,  and  Module::Load::Conditional  can  not tell you what module version you have installed.
       This may be desirable from a security or performance point of view.  Note that  $FIND_VERSION  code  runs
       safely under "taint mode".

       The default is 1;

   <b>$Module::Load::Conditional::CHECK_INC_HASH</b>
       This  controls whether "Module::Load::Conditional" checks your %INC hash to see if a module is available.
       By default, only @INC is scanned to see if a module is physically on your filesystem, or available via an
       "@INC-hook". Setting this variable to "true" will trust any entries in %INC and return them for you.

       The default is 0;

   <b>$Module::Load::Conditional::FORCE_SAFE_INC</b>
       This controls whether "Module::Load::Conditional" sanitises @INC by removing ""."". The  current  default
       setting is 0, but this may change in a future release.

   <b>$Module::Load::Conditional::CACHE</b>
       This  holds the cache of the "can_load" function. If you explicitly want to remove the current cache, you
       can set this variable to "undef"

   <b>$Module::Load::Conditional::ERROR</b>
       This holds a string of the last error that happened during a call to "can_load". It is useful to  inspect
       this when "can_load" returns "undef".

   <b>$Module::Load::Conditional::DEPRECATED</b>
       This  controls whether "Module::Load::Conditional" checks if a dual-life core module has been deprecated.
       If this is set to true "check_install" will return false to "uptodate", if a dual-life module is found to
       be loaded from $Config{privlibexp}

       The default is 0;
