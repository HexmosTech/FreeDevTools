</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Perl::Critic::Policy::Modules::RequireBarewordIncludes - Write "require Module" instead of "require
       'Module.pm'".

</pre><h4><b>AFFILIATION</b></h4><pre>
       This Policy is part of the core Perl::Critic distribution.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       When including another module (or library) via the "require" or "use" statements, it is best to identify
       the module (or library) using a bareword rather than an explicit path.  This is because paths are usually
       not portable from one machine to another.  Also, Perl automatically assumes that the filename ends in
       '.pm' when the library is expressed as a bareword.  So as a side-effect, this Policy encourages people to
       write '*.pm' modules instead of the old-school '*.pl' libraries.

           use 'My/Perl/Module.pm';  #not ok
           use My::Perl::Module;     #ok

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       This Policy is not configurable except for the standard options.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       This Policy is a replacement for "ProhibitRequireStatements", which completely banned the use of
       "require" for the sake of eliminating the old '*.pl' libraries from Perl4.  Upon further consideration, I
       realized that "require" is quite useful and necessary to enable run-time loading.  Thus,
       "RequireBarewordIncludes" does allow you to use "require", but still encourages you to write '*.pm'
       modules.

       Sometimes, you may want to load modules at run-time, but you don't know at design-time exactly which
       module you will need to load (Perl::Critic is an example of this).  In that case, just attach the '## no
       critic' annotation like so:

           require $module_name;  ## no critic
