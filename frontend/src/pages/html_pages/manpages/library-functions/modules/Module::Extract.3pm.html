</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Module::Extract - Base class for working with Perl distributions

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       Creating a Module::Extract subclass.

         package My::Readme;

         # Shows the README file for a module

         use strict;
         use base 'Module::Extract';

         sub show {
             my $self   = shift;
             my $readme = $self-&gt;file_path('README');
             if ( -f $readme ) {
                 system( "cat $readme" );
             } else {
                 print "Dist does not have a README file";
             }
         }

         1;

       A script that uses the module to show the readme file for a distribution filename provided by the user.

         #!<a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?perl">/usr/bin/perl</a>

         use My::Readme;

         My::Readme-&gt;new( dist_file =&gt; $ARGV[0] )-&gt;show;

         <a href="../man0/exit.0.html">exit</a>(0);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Module::Extract</b> is a convenience base class for creating module that work with Perl distributions.

       Its purpose is to take care of the mechanisms of locating and extracting a Perl distribution so that your
       module can do something specific to the distribution.

       This module was originally created to provide an abstraction for the extraction logic for both
       Module::Inspector and Module::P4P and to allow additional features to be added in the future without
       having to modify both of them, because the general problem of "locate, download, and expand a
       distribution" is one that is almost ideal for adding additional features down the line.

   <b>new</b>
         my $from_file = My::Class-&gt;new(
             dist_file =&gt; 'tarball.tar.gz',
             );

         my $from_dir = My::Class-&gt;new(
             dist_dir  =&gt; 'some/dir',
             );

       The "new" constructor takes a "dist_file" and/or a "dist_dir" param, locates and (if needed) expands the
       distribution tarball.

       It takes either a "dist_file" param, which should be the local path to the tarball, or a "dist_dir" which
       should be the path to a directory which contains an already-expanded distribution (such as from a
       repository checkout).

       Return a new <b>Module::Extract</b>-subclass object, or dies on error.

   <b>dist_file</b>
       The "dist_file" accessor returns the (absolute) path to the distribution tarball. If the inspector was
       created with "dist_dir" rather than "dist_file", this will return "undef".

   <b>dist_type</b>
       The "dist_type" method returns the archive type of the distribution tarball. This will be either
       'tar.gz', 'tgz', or 'zip'. Other file types are not supported at this time.

       If the inspector was created with "dist_dir" rather than "dist_file", this will return "undef".

   <b>dist_dir</b>
       The "dist_dir" method returns the (absolute) distribution root directory.

       If the inspector was created with "dist_file" rather than "dist_file", this method will return the
       temporary directory created to hold the unwrapped tarball.

   <b>file_path</b>
         my $local_path = $inspector-&gt;file_path('lib/Foo.pm');

       To simplify implementations, most tools that work with distributions identify files in unix-style
       relative paths.

       The "file_path" method takes a unix-style relative path and returns a localised absolute path to the file
       on disk (either in the actual distribution directory, or the temp directory holding the expanded tarball.

   <b>dir_path</b>
         my $local_path = $inspector-&gt;file_path('lib');

       The "dir_path" method is the matching pair of the "file_path" method.

       As for that method, it takes a unix-style relative directory name, and returns a localised absolute path
       to the directory.

</pre><h4><b>SUPPORT</b></h4><pre>
       This module is stored in an Open Repository at the following address.

       &lt;<a href="http://svn.phase-n.com/svn/cpan/trunk/Module-Extract">http://svn.phase-n.com/svn/cpan/trunk/Module-Extract</a>&gt;

       Write access to the repository is made available automatically to any published CPAN author, and to most
       other volunteers on request.

       If you are able to submit your bug report in the form of new (failing) unit tests, or can apply your fix
       directly instead of submitting a patch, you are <b>strongly</b> encouraged to do so as the author currently
       maintains over 100 modules and it can take some time to deal with non-Critcal bug reports or patches.

       This will guarentee that your issue will be addressed in the next release of the module.

       If you cannot provide a direct test or fix, or don't have time to do so, then regular bug reports are
       still accepted and appreciated via the CPAN bug tracker.

       For other issues, for commercial enhancement or support, or to have your write access enabled for the
       repository, contact the author at the email address above.
