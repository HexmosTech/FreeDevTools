</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This document describes version 2 of the CPAN distribution metadata specification, also known as the
       "CPAN Meta Spec".

       Revisions of this specification for typo corrections and prose clarifications may be issued as
       CPAN::Meta::Spec 2.<u>x</u>.  These revisions will never change semantics or add or remove specified behavior.

       Distribution metadata describe important properties of Perl distributions. Distribution building tools
       like Module::Build, Module::Install, ExtUtils::MakeMaker or Dist::Zilla should create a metadata file in
       accordance with this specification and include it with the distribution for use by automated tools that
       index, examine, package or install Perl distributions.

</pre><h4><b>TERMINOLOGY</b></h4><pre>
       distribution
           This  is  the  primary  object  described by the metadata. In the context of this document it usually
           refers to a collection of modules, scripts, and/or documents that are distributed together for  other
           developers to use.  Examples of distributions are "Class-Container", "libwww-perl", or "DBI".

       module
           This refers to a reusable library of code contained in a single file.  Modules usually contain one or
           more  packages  and  are often referred to by the name of a primary package that can be mapped to the
           file name. For example, one might refer to "File::Spec" instead of <u>File/Spec.pm</u>

       package
           This refers to a namespace declared with the Perl "package" statement.  In Perl, packages often  have
           a version number property given by the $VERSION variable in the namespace.

       consumer
           This  refers  to code that reads a metadata file, deserializes it into a data structure in memory, or
           interprets a data structure of metadata elements.

       producer
           This refers to code that constructs a metadata data structure, serializes into  a  bytestream  and/or
           writes it to disk.

       must, should, may, etc.
           These terms are interpreted as described in IETF RFC 2119.

</pre><h4><b>DATA</b> <b>TYPES</b></h4><pre>
       Fields  in  the  "STRUCTURE" section describe data elements, each of which has an associated data type as
       described herein.  There are four primitive types: Boolean,  String,  List  and  Map.   Other  types  are
       subtypes  of primitives and define compound data structures or define constraints on the values of a data
       element.

   <b>Boolean</b>
       A <u>Boolean</u> is used to provide a true or false value.  It <b>must</b> be represented as a defined  value  that  is
       either "1" or "0" or stringifies to those values.

   <b>String</b>
       A <u>String</u> is data element containing a non-zero length sequence of Unicode characters, such as an ordinary
       Perl scalar that is not a reference.

   <b>List</b>
       A <u>List</u> is an ordered collection of zero or more data elements.  Elements of a List may be of mixed types.

       Producers <b>must</b> represent List elements using a data structure which unambiguously indicates that multiple
       values are possible, such as a reference to a Perl array (an "arrayref").

       Consumers expecting a List <b>must</b> consider a String as equivalent to a List of length 1.

   <b>Map</b>
       A  <u>Map</u>  is an unordered collection of zero or more data elements ("values"), indexed by associated String
       elements ("keys").  The Map's value elements may be of mixed types.

   <b>License</b> <b>String</b>
       A <u>License</u> <u>String</u> is a subtype of String with a restricted set of values.  Valid values are  described  in
       detail in the description of the "license" field.

   <b>URL</b>
       <u>URL</u>  is  a  subtype of String containing a Uniform Resource Locator or Identifier.  [ This type is called
       URL and not URI for historical reasons. ]

   <b>Version</b>
       A <u>Version</u> is a subtype of String containing a value that describes the  version  number  of  packages  or
       distributions.  Restrictions on format are described in detail in the "Version Formats" section.

   <b>Version</b> <b>Range</b>
       The  <u>Version</u>  <u>Range</u> type is a subtype of String.  It describes a range of Versions that may be present or
       installed to fulfill prerequisites.  It is specified in detail in the "Version Ranges" section.

</pre><h4><b>STRUCTURE</b></h4><pre>
       The metadata structure is a data element of type Map.  This section describes valid keys within the Map.

       Any keys not described in  this  specification  document  (whether  top-level  or  within  compound  data
       structures described herein) are considered <u>custom</u> <u>keys</u> and <b>must</b> begin with an "x" or "X" and be followed
       by  an  underscore;  i.e. they must match the pattern: "qr{\Ax_}i".  If a custom key refers to a compound
       data structure, subkeys within it do not need an "x_" or "X_" prefix.

       Consumers of metadata may ignore any or all custom keys.  All other keys not described herein are invalid
       and should be ignored by consumers.  Producers must not generate or output invalid keys.

       For each key, an example is provided followed by a description.  The description begins with the  version
       of  spec  in which the key was added or in which the definition was modified, whether the key is <u>required</u>
       or <u>optional</u> and the data type of the  corresponding  data  element.   These  items  are  in  parentheses,
       brackets and braces, respectively.

       If a data type is a Map or Map subtype, valid subkeys will be described as well.

       Some fields are marked <u>Deprecated</u>.  These are shown for historical context and must not be produced in or
       consumed from any metadata structure of version 2 or higher.

   <b>REQUIRED</b> <b>FIELDS</b>
       <u>abstract</u>

       Example:

         abstract =&gt; 'Build and install Perl modules'

       (Spec 1.2) [required] {String}

       This is a short description of the purpose of the distribution.

       <u>author</u>

       Example:

         author =&gt; [ 'Ken Williams &lt;<a href="mailto:kwilliams@cpan.org">kwilliams@cpan.org</a>&gt;' ]

       (Spec 1.2) [required] {List of one or more Strings}

       This  List  indicates  the  person(s)  to  contact concerning the distribution. The preferred form of the
       contact string is:

         contact-name &lt;email-address&gt;

       This field provides a general contact list independent of other structured  fields  provided  within  the
       "resources" field, such as "bugtracker".  The addressee(s) can be contacted for any purpose including but
       not limited to (security) problems with the distribution, questions about the distribution or bugs in the
       distribution.

       A  distribution's  original  author  is  usually  the  contact listed within this field.  Co-maintainers,
       successor maintainers or mailing lists devoted to the distribution may also be listed in addition  to  or
       instead of the original author.

       <u>dynamic_config</u>

       Example:

         dynamic_config =&gt; 1

       (Spec 2) [required] {Boolean}

       A  boolean  flag  indicating whether a <u>Build.PL</u> or <u>Makefile.PL</u> (or similar) must be executed to determine
       prerequisites.

       This field should be set to a true value if the distribution performs some dynamic configuration  (asking
       questions,  sensing  the  environment, etc.) as part of its configuration.  This field should be set to a
       false value to indicate that prerequisites included in metadata may be considered  final  and  valid  for
       static analysis.

       Note:  when  this field is true, post-configuration prerequisites are not guaranteed to bear any relation
       whatsoever to those stated in the metadata,  and  relying  on  them  doing  so  is  an  error.  See  also
       "Prerequisites for dynamically configured distributions" in the implementors' notes.

       This  field  explicitly  <b>does</b>  <b>not</b>  indicate whether installation may be safely performed without using a
       Makefile or Build file, as there may be special files to install or custom installation targets (e.g. for
       dual-life modules that exist on CPAN as well as in the Perl core).  This field only  defines  whether  or
       not prerequisites are exactly as given in the metadata.

       <u>generated_by</u>

       Example:

         generated_by =&gt; 'Module::Build version 0.36'

       (Spec 1.0) [required] {String}

       This  field indicates the tool that was used to create this metadata.  There are no defined semantics for
       this field, but it is traditional to use a string in the form "Generating::Package version 1.23"  or  the
       author's name, if the file was generated by hand.

       <u>license</u>

       Example:

         license =&gt; [ 'perl_5' ]

         license =&gt; [ 'apache_2_0', 'mozilla_1_0' ]

       (Spec 2) [required] {List of one or more License Strings}

       One  or  more  licenses that apply to some or all of the files in the distribution.  If multiple licenses
       are listed, the distribution documentation should be consulted to clarify the interpretation of  multiple
       licenses.

       The following list of license strings are valid:

        string          description
        -------------   -----------------------------------------------
        agpl_3          GNU Affero General Public License, Version 3

        ssleay          Original SSLeay License
        sun             Sun Internet Standards Source License (SISSL)
        zlib            zlib License

       The following license strings are also valid and indicate other licensing not described above:

        string          description
        -------------   -----------------------------------------------
        open_source     Other Open Source Initiative (OSI) approved license
        restricted      Requires special permission from copyright holder
        unrestricted    Not an OSI approved license, but not restricted
        unknown         License not provided in metadata

       All other strings are invalid in the license field.

       <u>meta-spec</u>

       Example:

         'meta-spec' =&gt; {
           version =&gt; '2',
           url     =&gt; '<a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc">http://search.cpan.org/perldoc</a>?CPAN::Meta::Spec',
         }

       (Spec 1.2) [required] {Map}

       This  field  indicates  the  version of the CPAN Meta Spec that should be used to interpret the metadata.
       Consumers must check this key as soon as possible and abort further metadata processing if the  meta-spec
       version is not supported by the consumer.

       The following keys are valid, but only "version" is required.

       version
           This subkey gives the integer <u>Version</u> of the CPAN Meta Spec against which the document was generated.

       url This  is  a  <u>URL</u>  of the metadata specification document corresponding to the given version.  This is
           strictly for human-consumption and should not impact the interpretation of the document.

           For the version 2 spec, either of these are recommended:

           •   "https://metacpan.org/pod/CPAN::Meta::Spec"

           •   "<a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc">http://search.cpan.org/perldoc</a>?CPAN::Meta::Spec"

       <u>name</u>

       Example:

         name =&gt; 'Module-Build'

       (Spec 1.0) [required] {String}

       This field is the name of the distribution.  This is often created by taking the "main  package"  in  the
       distribution  and  changing  "::" to "-", but the name may be completely unrelated to the packages within
       the distribution.  For example, LWP::UserAgent is distributed as part of the distribution  name  "libwww-
       perl".

       <u>release_status</u>

       Example:

         release_status =&gt; 'stable'

       (Spec 2) [required] {String}

       This  field  provides  the   release  status  of  this  distribution.  If the "version" field contains an
       underscore character, then "release_status" <b>must</b> <b>not</b> be "stable."

       The "release_status" field <b>must</b> have one of the following values:

       stable
           This indicates an ordinary, "final" release that should be indexed by PAUSE or other indexers.

       testing
           This indicates a "beta" release that is substantially complete, but has an elevated risk of bugs  and
           requires  additional testing.  The distribution should not be installed over a stable release without
           an explicit request or other confirmation from a user.  This release status  may  also  be  used  for
           "release candidate" versions of a distribution.

       unstable
           This  indicates  an "alpha" release that is under active development, but has been released for early
           feedback or testing and may be missing features or may have serious bugs.   The  distribution  should
           not be installed over a stable release without an explicit request or other confirmation from a user.

       Consumers <b>may</b> use this field to determine how to index the distribution for CPAN or other repositories in
       addition to or in replacement of heuristics based on version number or file name.

       <u>version</u>

       Example:

         version =&gt; '0.36'

       (Spec 1.0) [required] {Version}

       This field gives the version of the distribution to which the metadata structure refers.

   <b>OPTIONAL</b> <b>FIELDS</b>
       <u>description</u>

       Example:

           description =&gt;  "Module::Build is a system for "
             . "building, testing, and installing Perl modules. "
             . "It is meant to ... blah blah blah ...",

       (Spec 2) [optional] {String}

       A  longer,  more  complete  description  of  the purpose or intended use of the distribution than the one
       provided by the "abstract" key.

       <u>keywords</u>

       Example:

         keywords =&gt; [ qw/ toolchain cpan dual-life / ]

       (Spec 1.1) [optional] {List of zero or more Strings}

       A List of keywords that describe this distribution.  Keywords <b>must</b> <b>not</b> include whitespace.

       <u>no_index</u>

       Example:

         no_index =&gt; {
           file      =&gt; [ 'My/Module.pm' ],
           directory =&gt; [ 'My/Private' ],
           package   =&gt; [ 'My::Module::Secret' ],
           namespace =&gt; [ 'My::Module::Sample' ],
         }

       (Spec 1.2) [optional] {Map}

       This Map describes any files, directories, packages, and namespaces that are private to the packaging  or
       implementation of the distribution and should be ignored by indexing or search tools. Note that this is a
       list  of  exclusions,  and  the  spec  does not define what to <u>include</u> - see "Indexing distributions a la
       PAUSE" in the implementors notes for more information.

       Valid subkeys are as follows:

       file
           A <u>List</u> of relative paths to files.  Paths <b>must</b> <b>be</b> specified with unix conventions.

       directory
           A <u>List</u> of relative paths to directories.  Paths <b>must</b> <b>be</b> specified with unix conventions.

           [ Note: previous editions of the spec had "dir" instead of "directory" ]

       package
           A <u>List</u> of package names.

       namespace
           A <u>List</u> of package namespaces, where anything below  the  namespace  must  be  ignored,  but  <u>not</u>  the
           namespace itself.

           In   the   example   above   for   "no_index",   "My::Module::Sample::Foo"   would  be  ignored,  but
           "My::Module::Sample" would not.

       <u>optional_features</u>

       Example:

         optional_features =&gt; {
           sqlite =&gt; {
             description =&gt; 'Provides SQLite support',
             prereqs =&gt; {
               runtime =&gt; {
                 requires =&gt; {
                   'DBD::SQLite' =&gt; '1.25'
                 }
               }
             }
           }
         }

       (Spec 2) [optional] {Map}

       This Map describes optional features with incremental prerequisites.  Each key of the "optional_features"
       Map is a String used to identify the feature and each value is a Map with  additional  information  about
       the feature.  Valid subkeys include:

       description
           This is a String describing the feature.  Every optional feature should provide a description

       prereqs
           This  entry  is required and has the same structure as that of the "prereqs" key.  It provides a list
           of package requirements that must be satisfied for the feature to be supported or enabled.

           There is one crucial restriction:  the prereqs of an optional feature <b>must</b>  <b>not</b>  include  "configure"
           phase prereqs.

       Consumers  <b>must</b>  <b>not</b>  include  optional features as prerequisites without explicit instruction from users
       (whether via interactive prompting, a function parameter or a configuration value, etc. ).

       If an optional feature is used by a consumer to add additional prerequisites, the consumer  should  merge
       the  optional  feature prerequisites into those given by the "prereqs" key using the same semantics.  See
       "Merging and Resolving Prerequisites" for details on merging prerequisites.

       <u>Suggestion</u> <u>for</u> <u>disuse:</u> Because there is currently no way for a distribution to specify a dependency on an
       optional feature of another dependency, the use of "optional_feature" is discouraged.  Instead, create  a
       separate,  installable  distribution  that  ensures  the  desired  feature is available.  For example, if
       "Foo::Bar" has a "Baz" feature, release a separate "Foo-Bar-Baz" distribution that satisfies requirements
       for the feature.

       <u>prereqs</u>

       Example:

         prereqs =&gt; {
           runtime =&gt; {
             requires =&gt; {
               'perl'          =&gt; '5.006',
               'File::Spec'    =&gt; '0.86',
               'JSON'          =&gt; '2.16',
             },
             recommends =&gt; {
               'JSON::XS'      =&gt; '2.26',
             },
             suggests =&gt; {
               'Archive::Tar'  =&gt; '0',
             },
           },
           build =&gt; {
             requires =&gt; {
               'Alien::SDL'    =&gt; '1.00',
             },
           },
           test =&gt; {
             recommends =&gt; {
               'Test::Deep'    =&gt; '0.10',
             },
           }
         }

       (Spec 2) [optional] {Map}

       This is a Map that describes all the prerequisites of the distribution.  The keys are phases of activity,
       such as "configure", "build", "test" or "runtime".  Values are Maps in which the keys name  the  type  of
       prerequisite relationship such as "requires", "recommends", or "suggests" and the value provides a set of
       prerequisite  relations.   The  set  of  relations <b>must</b> be specified as a Map of package names to version
       ranges.

       The full definition for this field is given in the "Prereq Spec" section.

       <u>provides</u>

       Example:

         provides =&gt; {
           'Foo::Bar' =&gt; {
             file    =&gt; 'lib/Foo/Bar.pm',
             version =&gt; '0.27_02',
           },
           'Foo::Bar::Blah' =&gt; {
             file    =&gt; 'lib/Foo/Bar/Blah.pm',
           },
           'Foo::Bar::Baz' =&gt; {
             file    =&gt; 'lib/Foo/Bar/Baz.pm',
             version =&gt; '0.3',
           },
         }

       (Spec 1.2) [optional] {Map}

       This describes all packages provided by this distribution.  This information is used by distribution  and
       automation mechanisms like PAUSE, CPAN, metacpan.org and search.cpan.org to build indexes saying in which
       distribution various packages can be found.

       The  keys  of  "provides" are package names that can be found within the distribution.  If a package name
       key is provided, it must have a Map with the following valid subkeys:

       file
           This field is required.  It must contain a Unix-style  relative  file  path  from  the  root  of  the
           distribution  directory  to  a  file  that  contains  or  generates  the package.  It may be given as
           "META.yml" or "META.json" to claim a package for indexing without needing a "*.pm".

       version
           If it exists, this field must contains a <u>Version</u> String for the package.  If  the  package  does  not
           have a $VERSION, this field must be omitted.

       <u>resources</u>

       Example:

         resources =&gt; {
           license     =&gt; [ '<a href="http://dev.perl.org/licenses/">http://dev.perl.org/licenses/</a>' ],
           homepage    =&gt; '<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/module-build">http://sourceforge.net/projects/module-build</a>',
           bugtracker  =&gt; {
             web    =&gt; '<a href="http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Dist/Display.html">http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Dist/Display.html</a>?Name=CPAN-Meta',
             mailto =&gt; '<a href="mailto:meta-bugs@example.com">meta-bugs@example.com</a>',
           },
           repository  =&gt; {
             url  =&gt; 'git://github.com/dagolden/cpan-meta.git',
             web  =&gt; '<a href="http://github.com/dagolden/cpan-meta">http://github.com/dagolden/cpan-meta</a>',
             type =&gt; 'git',
           },
           x_twitter   =&gt; '<a href="http://twitter.com/cpan_linked/">http://twitter.com/cpan_linked/</a>',
         }

       (Spec 2) [optional] {Map}

       This field describes resources related to this distribution.

       Valid subkeys include:

       homepage
           The official home of this project on the web.

       license
           A  List  of <u>URL</u>'s that relate to this distribution's license.  As with the top-level "license" field,
           distribution documentation should be consulted to clarify the  interpretation  of  multiple  licenses
           provided here.

       bugtracker
           This  entry  describes the bug tracking system for this distribution.  It is a Map with the following
           valid keys:

             web    - a URL pointing to a web front-end for the bug tracker
             mailto - an email address to which bugs can be sent

       repository
           This entry describes the source control repository for this distribution.   It  is  a  Map  with  the
           following valid keys:

             url  - a URL pointing to the repository itself
             web  - a URL pointing to a web front-end for the repository
             type - a lowercase string indicating the VCS used

           Because  a  url like "<a href="http://myrepo.example.com/">http://myrepo.example.com/</a>" is ambiguous as to type, producers should provide a
           "type" whenever a "url" key is given.  The "type" field should be the name of the most common program
           used to work with the repository, e.g. "git", "svn", "cvs", "darcs", "bzr" or "hg".

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b> <b>NUMBERS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Version</b> <b>Formats</b>
       This section defines the Version type, used by several fields in the CPAN Meta Spec.

       Version  numbers  must  be treated as strings, not numbers.  For example, 1.200 <b>must</b> <b>not</b> be serialized as
       1.2.  Version comparison should be delegated to the Perl version module, version 0.80 or newer.

       Unless otherwise specified, version numbers <b>must</b> appear in one of two formats:

       Decimal versions
           Decimal versions are regular "decimal numbers", with some limitations.  They <b>must</b> be non-negative and
           <b>must</b> begin and end with a digit.  A single underscore <b>may</b>  be  included,  but  <b>must</b>  be  between  two
           digits.  They <b>must</b> <b>not</b> use exponential notation ("1.23e-2").

              version =&gt; '1.234'       # OK
              version =&gt; '1.23_04'     # OK

              version =&gt; '1.23_04_05'  # Illegal
              version =&gt; '1.'          # Illegal
              version =&gt; '.1'          # Illegal

       Dotted-integer versions
           Dotted-integer (also known as dotted-decimal) versions consist of positive integers separated by full
           stop  characters (i.e. "dots", "periods" or "decimal points").  This are equivalent in format to Perl
           "v-strings", with some additional restrictions on form.  They must be given in "normal"  form,  which
           has  a  leading  "v" character and at least three integer components.  To retain a one-to-one mapping
           with decimal versions, all components after the first <b>should</b> be restricted to the  range  0  to  999.
           The final component <b>may</b> be separated by an underscore character instead of a period.

              version =&gt; 'v1.2.3'      # OK
              version =&gt; 'v1.2_3'      # OK
              version =&gt; 'v1.2.3.4'    # OK
              version =&gt; 'v1.2.3_4'    # OK
              version =&gt; 'v2009.10.31' # OK

              version =&gt; 'v1.2'          # Illegal
              version =&gt; '1.2.3'         # Illegal
              version =&gt; 'v1.2_3_4'      # Illegal
              version =&gt; 'v1.2009.10.31' # Not recommended

   <b>Version</b> <b>Ranges</b>
       Some  fields (prereq, optional_features) indicate the particular version(s) of some other module that may
       be required as a prerequisite.  This section  details  the  Version  Range  type  used  to  provide  this
       information.

       The  simplest format for a Version Range is just the version number itself, e.g. 2.4.  This means that <b>at</b>
       <b>least</b> version 2.4 must be present.  To indicate that <b>any</b> version of a prerequisite is okay, even  if  the
       prerequisite doesn't define a version at all, use the version 0.

       Alternatively,  a  version range <b>may</b> use the operators &lt; (less than), &lt;= (less than or equal), &gt; (greater
       than), &gt;= (greater than or equal), == (equal), and != (not equal).  For  example,  the  specification  "&lt;
       2.0" means that any version of the prerequisite less than 2.0 is suitable.

       For  more  complicated  situations,  version  specifications  <b>may</b>  be  AND-ed together using commas.  The
       specification &gt;= 1.2, != 1.5, &lt; 2.0 indicates a version that must be <b>at</b> <b>least</b> 1.2, <b>less</b> <b>than</b> 2.0, and <b>not</b>
       <b>equal</b> <b>to</b> 1.5.

</pre><h4><b>PREREQUISITES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Prereq</b> <b>Spec</b>
       The "prereqs" key in the top-level  metadata  and  within  "optional_features"  define  the  relationship
       between  a  distribution  and other packages.  The prereq spec structure is a hierarchical data structure
       which divides prerequisites into <u>Phases</u> of activity in the installation process  and  <u>Relationships</u>  that
       indicate how prerequisites should be resolved.

       For  example,  to  specify  that  "Data::Dumper"  is "required" during the "test" phase, this entry would
       appear in the distribution metadata:

         prereqs =&gt; {
           test =&gt; {
             requires =&gt; {
               'Data::Dumper' =&gt; '2.00'
             }
           }
         }

       <u>Phases</u>

       Requirements for regular use must be listed in the "runtime" phase.  Other requirements should be  listed
       in  the  earliest stage in which they are required and consumers must accumulate and satisfy requirements
       across phases before executing the activity. For example, "build" requirements  must  also  be  available
       during the "test" phase.

         before action       requirements that must be met
         ----------------    --------------------------------
         perl Build.PL       configure
         perl Makefile.PL

         make                configure, runtime, build
         Build

         make test           configure, runtime, build, test
         Build test

       Consumers  that install the distribution must ensure that <u>runtime</u> requirements are also installed and may
       install dependencies from other phases.

         after action        requirements that must be met
         ----------------    --------------------------------
         make install        runtime
         Build install

       configure
           The configure phase occurs before any dynamic configuration has been attempted.   Libraries  required
           by  the  configure  phase  <b>must</b>  be  available for use before the distribution building tool has been
           executed.

       build
           The build phase is when the distribution's source code is compiled (if necessary) and otherwise  made
           ready for installation.

       test
           The  test  phase  is when the distribution's automated test suite is run.  Any library that is needed
           only for testing and not for subsequent use should be listed here.

       runtime
           The runtime phase refers not only to when the distribution's contents are installed, but also to  its
           continued  use.   Any  library  that is a prerequisite for regular use of this distribution should be
           indicated here.

       develop
           The develop phase's prereqs are libraries needed to work on the distribution's  source  code  as  its
           author does.  These tools might be needed to build a release tarball, to run author-only tests, or to
           perform other tasks related to developing new versions of the distribution.

       <u>Relationships</u>

       requires
           These dependencies <b>must</b> be installed for proper completion of the phase.

       recommends
           Recommended  dependencies  are  <u>strongly</u>  encouraged  and  should  be  satisfied  except  in resource
           constrained environments.

       suggests
           These dependencies  are  optional,  but  are  suggested  for  enhanced  operation  of  the  described
           distribution.

       conflicts
           These  libraries  cannot be installed when the phase is in operation.  This is a very rare situation,
           and the "conflicts" relationship should be used with great caution, or not at all.

   <b>Merging</b> <b>and</b> <b>Resolving</b> <b>Prerequisites</b>
       Whenever   metadata   consumers   merge   prerequisites,   either   from   different   phases   or   from
       "optional_features",  they  should  merged  in  a  way  which  preserves  the  intended  semantics of the
       prerequisite structure.  Generally, this means concatenating the version specifications using commas,  as
       described in the "Version Ranges" section.

       Another  subtle  error  that  can  occur  in  resolving  prerequisites comes from the way that modules in
       prerequisites are indexed to distribution files on CPAN.  When a module is deleted from  a  distribution,
       prerequisites  calling  for  that  module  could  indicate  an  older  distribution  should be installed,
       potentially overwriting files from a newer distribution.

       For example, as of Oct 31, 2009, the CPAN index file contained these module-distribution mappings:

         Class::MOP                   0.94  D/DR/DROLSKY/Class-MOP-0.94.tar.gz
         Class::MOP::Class            0.94  D/DR/DROLSKY/Class-MOP-0.94.tar.gz
         Class::MOP::Class::Immutable 0.04  S/ST/STEVAN/Class-MOP-0.36.tar.gz

       Consider  the   case   where   "Class::MOP"   0.94   is   installed.    If   a   distribution   specified
       "Class::MOP::Class::Immutable"  as  a  prerequisite,  it  could  result  in  Class-MOP-0.36.tar.gz  being
       installed, overwriting any files from Class-MOP-0.94.tar.gz.

       Consumers of metadata <b>should</b> test whether prerequisites would result  in  installed  module  files  being
       "downgraded"  to  an  older version and <b>may</b> warn users or ignore the prerequisite that would cause such a
       result.

</pre><h4><b>SERIALIZATION</b></h4><pre>
       Distribution metadata should be serialized  (as  a  hashref)  as  JSON-encoded  data  and  packaged  with
       distributions as the file <u>META.json</u>.

       In  the  past, the distribution metadata structure had been packed with distributions as <u>META.yml</u>, a file
       in the YAML Tiny format (for which, see YAML::Tiny).  Tools that consume distribution metadata from  disk
       should be capable of loading <u>META.yml</u>, but should prefer <u>META.json</u> if both are found.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>IMPLEMENTORS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Extracting</b> <b>Version</b> <b>Numbers</b> <b>from</b> <b>Perl</b> <b>Modules</b>
       To  get the version number from a Perl module, consumers should use the "MM-&gt;parse_version($file)" method
       provided by ExtUtils::MakeMaker or Module::Metadata.  For example, for the  module  given  by  $mod,  the
       version may be retrieved in one of the following ways:

         # via ExtUtils::MakeMaker
         my $file = MM-&gt;_installed_file_for_module($mod);
         my $version = MM-&gt;parse_version($file)

       The  private "_installed_file_for_module" method may be replaced with other methods for locating a module
       in @INC.

         # via Module::Metadata
         my $info = Module::Metadata-&gt;new_from_module($mod);
         my $version = $info-&gt;version;

       If only a filename is available, the following approach may be used:

         # via Module::Build
         my $info = Module::Metadata-&gt;new_from_file($file);
         my $version = $info-&gt;version;

   <b>Comparing</b> <b>Version</b> <b>Numbers</b>
       The version module provides the most reliable way to compare version numbers in all the various ways they
       might be provided or might exist within modules.  Given two strings containing version numbers,  $v1  and
       $v2,  they  should  be  converted  to  "version" objects before using ordinary comparison operators.  For
       example:

         use version;
         if ( version-&gt;new($v1) &lt;=&gt; version-&gt;new($v2) ) {
           print "Versions are not equal\n";
         }

       If the only comparison needed is whether an installed module is of a sufficiently high version, a  direct
       test  may  be  done using the string form of "eval" and the "use" function.  For example, for module $mod
       and version prerequisite $prereq:

         if ( eval "use $mod $prereq (); 1" ) {
           print "Module $mod version is OK.\n";
         }

       If the values of $mod and $prereq have not been scrubbed, however, this presents security implications.

   <b>Prerequisites</b> <b>for</b> <b>dynamically</b> <b>configured</b> <b>distributions</b>
       When "dynamic_config" is true, it is an error to presume that the  prerequisites  given  in  distribution
       metadata will have any relationship whatsoever to the actual prerequisites of the distribution.

       In practice, however, one can generally expect such prerequisites to be one of two things:

       •   The minimum prerequisites for the distribution, to which dynamic configuration will only add items

       •   Whatever the distribution configured with on the releaser's machine at release time

       The second case often turns out to have identical results to the first case, albeit only by accident.

       As  such,  consumers  may  use  this  data  for  informational analysis, but presenting it to the user as
       canonical or relying on it as such is invariably the height of folly.

   <b>Indexing</b> <b>distributions</b> <b>a</b> <b>la</b> <b>PAUSE</b>
       While no_index tells you what must be ignored when indexing, this spec holds no opinion on how you should
       get your initial candidate list of things  to  possibly  index.  For  "normal"  distributions  you  might
       consider  simply  indexing the contents of lib/, but there are many fascinating oddities on CPAN and many
       dists from the days when it was normal to put the main .pm file in the root of the distribution archive -
       so PAUSE currently indexes all .pm and .PL files  that  are  not  either  (a)  specifically  excluded  by
       no_index (b) in "inc", "xt", or "t" directories, or common 'mistake' directories such as "perl5".

       Or:  If you're trying to be PAUSE-like, make sure you skip "inc", "xt" and "t" as well as anything marked
       as no_index.

       Also remember: If the META file contains a provides field, you shouldn't  be  indexing  anything  in  the
       first place - just use that.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       Ken Williams wrote the original CPAN Meta Spec (also known as the "META.yml spec") in 2003 and maintained
       it  through  several  revisions  with  input  from various members of the community.  In 2005, Randy Sims
       redrafted it from HTML to POD for the version 1.2 release.  Ken continued to maintain  the  spec  through
       version 1.4.

       In  late  2009,  David  Golden organized the version 2 proposal review process.  David and Ricardo Signes
       drafted the final version 2 spec in April 2010 based on the version  1.4  spec  and  patches  contributed
       during the proposal process.
