       Mail::SpamAssassin::BayesStore::SQL - SQL Bayesian Storage Module Implementation

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module implements a SQL based bayesian storage module.  It's compatible with SQLite and possibly
       other standard SQL servers.

       Do not use this for MySQL/MariaDB or PgSQL, they have their own specific modules.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>new</b>
       public class (Mail::SpamAssassin::BayesStore::SQL) new (Mail::Spamassassin::Plugin::Bayes $bayes)

       Description: This methods creates a new instance of the Mail::SpamAssassin::BayesStore::SQL object.  It
       expects to be passed an instance of the Mail::SpamAssassin:Bayes object which is passed into the

                                              integer $spam_count,
                                              integer $ham_count,                            string $atime)

       private instance (Integer) _get_oldest_token_age ()

       Description: This method finds the atime of the oldest token in the database.

       The use of min(atime) in the SQL is ugly and but really the most efficient way of getting the
       oldest_token_age after we've done a mass expire.  It should only be called at expire time.

   <b>_get_num_hapaxes</b>
       private instance (Integer) _get_num_hapaxes ()
