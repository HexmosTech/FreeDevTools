</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       App::cpanminus - get, unpack, build and install modules from CPAN

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           cpanm Module

       Run "cpanm -h" or "perldoc cpanm" for more options.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       cpanminus is a script to get, unpack, build and install modules from CPAN and does nothing else.

       It's dependency free (can bootstrap itself), requires zero configuration, and stands alone. When running,
       it requires only 10MB of RAM.

</pre><h4><b>INSTALLATION</b></h4><pre>
       There are several ways to install cpanminus to your system.

   <b>Package</b> <b>management</b> <b>system</b>
       There are Debian packages, RPMs, FreeBSD ports, and packages for other operation systems available. If
       you want to use the package management system, search for cpanminus and use the appropriate command to
       install. This makes it easy to install "cpanm" to your system without thinking about where to install,
       and later upgrade.

   <b>Installing</b> <b>to</b> <b>system</b> <b>perl</b>
       You can also use the latest cpanminus to install cpanminus itself:

           curl -L https://cpanmin.us | perl - --sudo App::cpanminus

       This will install "cpanm" to your bin directory like "<a href="file:/usr/local/bin">/usr/local/bin</a>" and you'll need the "--sudo" option
       to write to the directory, unless you configured "INSTALL_BASE" with local::lib.

   <b>Installing</b> <b>to</b> <b>local</b> <b>perl</b> <b>(perlbrew,</b> <b>plenv</b> <b>etc.)</b>
       If you have perl in your home directory, which is the case if you use tools like perlbrew or plenv, you
       don't need the "--sudo" option, since you're most likely to have a write permission to the perl's library
       path. You can just do:

           curl -L https://cpanmin.us | perl - App::cpanminus

       to install the "cpanm" executable to the perl's bin path, like "<a href="file:~/perl5/perlbrew/bin/cpanm">~/perl5/perlbrew/bin/cpanm</a>".

   <b>Downloading</b> <b>the</b> <b>standalone</b> <b>executable</b>
       You can also copy the standalone executable to whatever location you'd like.

           cd <a href="file:~/bin">~/bin</a>
           curl -L https://cpanmin.us/ -o cpanm
           chmod +x cpanm

       This just works, but be sure to grab the new version manually when you upgrade because "--self-upgrade"
       might not work with this installation setup.

   <b>Troubleshoot:</b> <b>HTTPS</b> <b>warnings</b>
       When you run "curl" commands above, you may encounter SSL handshake errors or certification warnings.
       This is due to your HTTP client (curl) being old, or SSL certificates installed on your system needs to
       be updated.

       You're recommended to update the software or system if you can. If that is impossible or difficult, use
       the "-k" option with curl.

</pre><h4><b>DEPENDENCIES</b></h4><pre>
       perl 5.8.1 or later.

       •   'tar' executable (bsdtar or GNU tar version 1.22 are recommended) or Archive::Tar to unpack files.

       •   C compiler, if you want to build XS modules.

       •   make

       •   Module::Build (core in 5.10)

</pre><h4><b>QUESTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>How</b> <b>does</b> <b>cpanm</b> <b>get/parse/update</b> <b>the</b> <b>CPAN</b> <b>index?</b>
       It  queries  the  CPAN  Meta DB site at &lt;<a href="http://cpanmetadb.plackperl.org/">http://cpanmetadb.plackperl.org/</a>&gt;.  The site is updated at least
       every hour to reflect the latest changes from fast syncing mirrors. The script then also  falls  back  to
       query the module at &lt;<a href="http://metacpan.org/">http://metacpan.org/</a>&gt; using its search API.

       Upon  calling these API hosts, cpanm (1.6004 or later) will send the local perl versions to the server in
       User-Agent string by default. You can turn it off with "--no-report-perl-version" option. Read more about
       the option  with  cpanm,  and  read  more  about  the  privacy  policy  about  this  data  collection  at
       &lt;<a href="http://cpanmetadb.plackperl.org/">http://cpanmetadb.plackperl.org/</a>#privacy&gt;

       Fetched  files  are  unpacked in "<a href="file:~/.cpanm">~/.cpanm</a>" and automatically cleaned up periodically.  You can configure
       the location of this with the "PERL_CPANM_HOME" environment variable.

   <b>Where</b> <b>does</b> <b>this</b> <b>install</b> <b>modules</b> <b>to?</b> <b>Do</b> <b>I</b> <b>need</b> <b>root</b> <b>access?</b>
       It installs to wherever ExtUtils::MakeMaker and Module::Build are configured to  (via  "PERL_MM_OPT"  and
       "PERL_MB_OPT").

       By  default,  it installs to the site_perl directory that belongs to your perl. You can see the locations
       for that by running "perl -V" and it will be likely something under "/opt/local/perl/..." if you're using
       system perl, or under your home directory if you have built perl yourself using perlbrew or plenv.

       If you've already configured local::lib on your shell, cpanm respects that settings and modules  will  be
       installed to your local perl5 directory.

       At  a boot time, cpanminus checks whether you have already configured local::lib, or have a permission to
       install modules to the site_perl directory.  If neither, i.e. you're using system perl  and  do  not  run
       cpanm  as a root, it automatically sets up local::lib compatible installation path in a "perl5" directory
       under your home directory.

       To avoid this, run "cpanm" either as a root user, with "--sudo" option, or with "--local-lib" option.

   <b>cpanminus</b> <b>can't</b> <b>install</b> <b>the</b> <b>module</b> <b>XYZ.</b> <b>Is</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>bug?</b>
       It is more likely a problem with the distribution itself. cpanminus doesn't support or  may  have  issues
       with distributions such as follows:

       •   Tests that require input from STDIN.

       •   Build.PL or Makefile.PL that prompts for input even when "PERL_MM_USE_DEFAULT" is enabled.

       •   Modules that have invalid numeric values as VERSION (such as "1.1a")

       These  failures  can  be  reported  back to the author of the module so that they can fix it accordingly,
       rather than to cpanminus.

   <b>Does</b> <b>cpanm</b> <b>support</b> <b>the</b> <b>feature</b> <b>XYZ</b> <b>of</b> <b>CPAN</b> <b>and</b> <b>CPANPLUS?</b>
       Most likely not. Here are the things that cpanm doesn't do by itself.

       If you need these features, use CPAN, CPANPLUS or the standalone tools that are mentioned.

       •   CPAN testers reporting. See App::cpanminus::reporter

       •   Building RPM packages from CPAN modules

       •   Listing the outdated modules that needs upgrading. See App::cpanoutdated

       •   Showing the changes of the modules you're about to upgrade. See cpan-listchanges

       •   Patching CPAN modules with distroprefs.

       See cpanm or "cpanm -h" to see what cpanminus <u>can</u> do :)
