</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Bot::BasicBot::Pluggable::Module::Auth - authentication for Bot::BasicBot::Pluggable modules

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 1.30

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       This module catches messages at priority 1 and stops anything starting with '!' unless the user is
       authed. Most admin modules, e.g. Loader, can merely sit at priority 2 and assume the user is authed if
       the !command reaches them. If you want to use modules that can change bot state, like Loader or Vars, you
       almost certainly want this module.

</pre><h4><b>IRC</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       The default user is 'admin' with password 'julia'. Change this.

       !auth &lt;username&gt; &lt;password&gt;
           Authenticate as an administrators. Logins timeout after an hour.

       !adduser &lt;username&gt; &lt;password&gt;
           Adds a user with the given password.

       !deluser &lt;username&gt;
           Deletes a user. Don't delete yourself, that's probably not a good idea.

       !password &lt;old password&gt; &lt;new password&gt;
           Change your current password (must be logged in first).

       !users
           List all the users the bot knows about.

</pre><h4><b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       password_admin
           This variable specifies the admin password. Its normally set via the !password directive and defaults
           to 'julia'. Please change this as soon as possible.

       allow_anonymous
           If this variable is true, the implicit authentication handling is disabled. Every module will have to
           check for authentication via the authed method, otherwise access is just granted. This is only useful
           to  allow  modules  to  handle  directives  starting  with  an  exclamation  mark without needing any
           authentication. And to make things even more interesting,  you  won't  be  warned  that  you  haven't
           authenticated,  so modules needing authentication will fail without any warning. It defaults to false
           and should probably never be changed. You've been warned.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       The only useful method is authed():

       authed($username)
           Returns 1 if the given username is logged in, 0 otherwise:

             if ($bot-&gt;module("Auth")-&gt;authed("jerakeen")) { ... }

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       All users are admins. This is fine at the moment, as the only things that need you to be  logged  in  are
       admin  functions.  Passwords  are  stored  in plaintext, and are trivial to extract for any module on the
       system. I don't consider this a bug, because I assume you trust the modules you're loading.  If  Auth  is
       <u>not</u> loaded, all users effectively have admin permissions. This may not be a good idea, but is also not an
       Auth bug, it's an architecture bug.
