       Module::Want - Check @INC once for modules that you want but may not have

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This document describes Module::Want version 0.6

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Module::Want;

           if (have_mod('Encode')) {
               ... use Encode::whatever ...
           }
           else {
               ... use Encode:: alternative ...
           }

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Sometimes you want to lazy load a module for use in, say, a loop or function. First you do the eval-
       require but then realize if the module is not available it will re-search @INC each time. So then you add
       a lexical boolean to your eval and do the same simple logic all over the place. On and on it goes :)

       This module encapsulates that logic so that <b>have_mod()</b> is like eval { require X; 1 } but if the module
       can't be loaded it will remember that fact and not look in @INC again on subsequent calls.

       For example, this searches @INC for X.pm every iteration of the loop:

           while( ... ) {
               if (eval { require X; 1 }) {
                   ... use X code ...
               }
               else {
                   ... do X-alternative code ...
               }
           }

       This searches @INC for X.pm once:

           while( ... ) {
               if (have_mod('X')) {
                   ... use X code ...
               }
               else {
                   ... do X-alternative code ...
               }
           }

       Additionally, it will not trip the sig die handler. That prevents a benign eval from tripping a
       potentially fatal sig handler. (i.e. another step you'd have to do manually with the straight eval form.)

</pre><h4><b>INTERFACE</b></h4><pre>
       <b>import()</b> puts <b>have_mod()</b> into the caller's name space.

   <b>have_mod()</b>
       Takes the name space to <b>require()</b> if we have not tried already.

       Returns true if it could be loaded. False otherwise.

       You can give it a second true argument to skip using the value from the last time it was called and re-
       try <b>require()</b>ing it.

          if (!have_mod('X')) {
              # do some things to try and ger X available
          }

          if (have_mod('X',1)) {
              # sweet we have it now!
          }

   <b>import()</b>
       You can <b>use()</b> it with a list to call <b>have_mod()</b> on:

          use Module::Want qw(X Y Z); # calls have_mod('X'), have_mod('Y'), and have_mod('Z')

   <b>Utility</b> <b>functions</b>
       These aren't the real reasons for this module but they've proven useful when you're doing things that
       would require <b>have_mod()</b> so here they are:

       They can all be exported thusly:

           use Module::Want qw(is_ns);

       For an entire suite if name space utilities see Module::Util and friends.

       <u>is_ns($ns)</u>

       Boolean of if '$ns' is a proper name space or not.

           if(is_ns($ns)) {
               ... use $ns as a module/class name ...
           }
           else {
              ... "invalid input please try again" prompt ...
           }

       <u><b>get_ns_regexp()</b></u>

       Returns a quoted Regexp that matches a name space for use in your regexes.

       <u>get_all_use_require_in_text($text)</u>

       This will return a list of all name spaces being <b>use()</b>d or <b>require()</b>d in perlish looking $text.

       It will also return ones being <b>eval()</b>d in.

       It is very simplistic (e.g. it may or may not return use/require statements that are in comments, it will
       match verbiage in a here doc that start w/ XuseX) so if it does not fit your needs you'll need to try a
       PPI based solution (I have Perl::DependList on my radar that does just that.).

       <u>get_inc_key($ns)</u>

       Returns what $ns's key in %INC would be (if is_ns($ns) of course)

           if (my $inc_key =  get_inc_key($ns)) {
               if (exists $INC{$inc_key}) {
                  ... in %INC ...
               }
               else {
                   ... not in %INC ...
               }
           }

       %INC keys are always unix format so don't panic

       If I've been misinformed of that fact then please let me know, thanks

       get_relative_path_of_ns($ns)

       Alias of "get_inc_key($ns)" whose name indicates a different intent.

       <u>get_clean_ns($ns)</u>

       Takes $ns, trims leading and trailing whitespace and turns ' into ::, and returns the cleaned copy.

       normalize_ns($ns)

       Alias of "get_clean_ns($ns)" whose name indicates a different intent.

       <u>ns2distname($ns)</u>

       Turns the given name space into a distribution name.

       e.g. Foo::Bar::Baz becomes Foo-Bar-Baz

       <u>distname2ns($distname)</u>

       Turns the given distribution name into a name space.

       e.g. Foo-Bar-Baz becomes Foo::Bar::Baz

       <u>get_inc_path_via_have_mod($ns)</u>

       Return the %INC entryXs value if we have_mod($ns);

       <u>search_inc_paths($ns)</u>

       Without loading the module, search for $ns in @INC.

       In scalar context returns the first path it is found in, in list context returns all paths it is found
       in.

           my $first_path_it_is_in = search_inc_paths($ns);
           my @all_paths_it_is_in  = search_inc_paths($ns);

       By default it returns the path it is in without the module-name part of the path. A second true argument
       will return the entire path.

           my $abs_path_of_pm_file = search_inc_paths($ns,1);
