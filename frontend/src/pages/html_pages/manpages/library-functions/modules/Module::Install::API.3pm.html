</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Module::Install::API - Command Reference for Module::Install

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Module::Install has lots of commands scattered in the extensions.  Several common commands are described
       in the main Module::Install's pod, but you usually need to know more to do what you want.

       This API document lists and describes all the public <u>supported</u> commands, grouped by the nature or
       importance of them.

       If you are a module author and want to use Module::Install in your distributions, this is the document
       you should consult.

       If you are a user (or a contributor) of distributions that use Module::Install, you may also want to
       check Module::Install::FAQ where you'll find some common glitches you may encounter.

       Note that commands not listed here should be deemed private utility commands for the Module::Install
       developers, or <u>unsupported</u> commands with various reasons (some are experimental and half-baked, some are
       broken (by design or by implementation), some are simply deprecated, and so on). You may find some of
       them are used rather widely, but their use is discouraged. You have been warned.

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b> <b>TO</b> <b>PROVIDE</b> <b>BASIC</b> <b>META</b> <b>DATA</b></h4><pre>
       Most of these are also described in the main Module::Install's pod. Basically, (almost) all you have to
       know is the <b>all_from</b> command that tries to extract all the necessary basic meta data from a module file,
       but you can also specify one by one what is not written in the module and can't be extracted (you usually
       want to write these specific commands before all_from() not to be warned by the lack of information).

   <b>all_from</b> <b>(Module::Install::Metadata)</b>
         all_from 'lib/Foo/Bar.pm';

       <b>all_from</b> command takes a module file path, and will try to extract meta data from the module including a
       distribution name, a module version, the minimum required perl version for the module, authors
       information, a license, a short description of the module. See the following commands for the extraction
       detail.

   <b>name,</b> <b>name_from,</b> <b>module_name</b> <b>(Module::Install::Metadata)</b>
         name 'Foo-Bar';
         name_from 'lib/Foo/Bar.pm';

       <b>name</b> command takes a distribution name. It usually differs slightly from a module name (a module name is
       separated by double colons; a distribution name is separated by hyphens). Just replacing all the double
       colons of your main module with hyphens would be enough for you.

       <b>name_from</b> takes a module file path, and looks for the topmost "package" declaration to extract a module
       name, and then converts it to a distribution name.

       You may optionally set <b>module_name</b> to specify a main module name (if you choose other naming scheme for
       your distribution). This value is directly passed to ExtUtils::MakeMaker in the backend as a "NAME"
       attribute (Module::Install usually creates this from the distribution name set by <b>name</b> or <b>name_from</b>).

   <b>abstract,</b> <b>abstract_from</b> <b>(Module::Install::Metadata)</b>
         abstract 'a short description of the distribution';
         abstract_from 'lib/Foo/Bar.pm';

       <b>abstract</b> command takes a string to describe what that module/distribution is for. <b>abstract_from</b> takes a
       module file path and looks for a string that follows the module's name and a hyphen to separate in the
       "NAME" section of the pod.

       The value set by <b>abstract</b> or <b>abstract_from</b> is passed to ExtUtils::MakeMaker as an "ABSTRACT" attribute.

   <b>version,</b> <b>version_from</b> <b>(Module::Install::Metadata)</b>
         version '0.01';
         version_from 'lib/Foo/Bar.pm';

       <b>version</b> command takes a version string for the distribution.  <b>version_from</b> takes a module file path, and
       looks for the $VERSION of the module.

       The value set by <b>version</b> or <b>version_from</b> is passed to ExtUtils::MakeMaker as a "VERSION" attribute.
       <b>version_from</b> (and <b>all_from</b>) also sets a "VERSION_FROM" attribute to check version integrity of the
       distribution.

   <b>perl_version,</b> <b>perl_version_from</b> <b>(Module::Install::Metadata)</b>
         perl_version '5.008';
         perl_version_from 'lib/Foo/Bar.pm';

       <b>perl_version</b> command takes a minimum required perl version for the distribution. <b>perl_version_from</b> takes
       a module file path, and looks for a "use &lt;perl_version&gt;" (or "require &lt;perl_version&gt;") statement (note
       that now Module::Install only supports perl 5.005 and newer).

       The value set by <b>perl_version</b> or <b>perl_version_from</b> is passed to ExtUtils::MakeMaker as a
       "MIN_PERL_VERSION" attribute (if applicable).

   <b>author,</b> <b>author_from</b> <b>(Module::Install::Metadata)</b>
         author 'John Doe &lt;john.doe at cpan.org&gt;';
         author_from 'lib/Foo/Bar.pm';

       <b>author</b> command takes a string to describe author(s). You can set multiple authors with one <b>author</b>
       command, or with multiple <b>author</b>s (you can also use <b>authors</b> alias if you prefer).

       <b>author_from</b> takes a module file path, and looks for an "AUTHOR" (or "AUTHORS") section in the pod (and
       also license/copyright sections if it can't find any author(s) section) to extract an author.

       The value set by <b>author</b> or <b>author_from</b> is concatenated and passed to ExtUtils::MakeMaker as an "AUTHOR"
       attribute.

   <b>license,</b> <b>license_from</b> <b>(Module::Install::Metadata)</b>
         license 'perl';
         license_from 'lib/Foo/Bar.pm';

       <b>license</b> command takes an abbreviated license name including "perl", "artistic", "apache", "(l)gpl",
       "bsd", "mit", "mozilla", "open_source", and so on. If you don't (want to) specify a particular license,
       it will be "unknown".

       <b>license_from</b> takes a module file path, and looks for a "LICENSE" (or "LICENCE") section in the pod (and
       also "COPYRIGHT" section if it can't find any) to extract a license.

       The value set by <b>license</b> or <b>license_from</b> is passed to ExtUtils::MakeMaker as an "LICENSE" attribute (if
       applicable).

       You are also reminded that if the distribution is intended to be uploaded to the CPAN, it <b>must</b> be an OSI-
       approved open source license. Commercial software is not permitted on the CPAN.

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b> <b>TO</b> <b>PROVIDE</b> <b>DEPENDENCIES</b></h4><pre>
       Most of these are described in the main pod, too.

   <b>requires</b> <b>(Module::Install::Metadata)</b>
         requires 'Foo::Bar';
         requires 'Foo::Baz' =&gt; '1.00';

       <b>requires</b> command takes a module name on which your distribution depends, and its minimum required version
       if any. You may add arbitrary numbers of "requires". You even can add multiple numbers of dependencies on
       the same module with different required versions (which will be sorted out later, though). Note that this
       dependency is on the basis of a module, not of a distribution. This usually doesn't matter, and you just
       need to call for a module you really need (then you'll get the whole distribution it belongs to), but
       sometimes you may need to call for all the modules that the required module implicitly requires.

       The values set by <b>requires</b> are passed to ExtUtils::MakeMaker as a "PREREQ_PM" attribute.

   <b>build_requires,</b> <b>test_requires</b> <b>(Module::Install::Metadata)</b>
         build_requires 'ExtUtils::Foo::Bar';
         build_requires 'ExtUtils::Foo::Baz' =&gt; '1.00';
         test_requires  'Test::Foo::Bar';
         test_requires  'Test::Foo::Baz' =&gt; '1.00';

       <b>build_requires</b> command also takes a module name and a minimum required version if any. The difference
       from the "requires" command is that <b>build_requires</b> is to call for modules you'll require while building
       the distribution, or in the tests, and that in theory are not required at run-time. This distinction is
       more for other system package managers than for the CPAN, from where you usually want to install
       everything for future reuse (unless you are too lazy to test distributions).

       As of this writing, "test_requires" is just an alias for "build_requires", but this may change in the
       future.

       The values set by <b>build_requires</b> and <b>test_requires</b> are passed to ExtUtils::MakeMaker as a
       "BUILD_REQUIRES" attribute, which may fall back to "PREREQ_PM" if your ExtUtils::MakeMaker is not new
       enough.

   <b>configure_requires</b> <b>(Module::Install::Metadata)</b>
         configure_requires 'ExtUtils::Foo::Bar';
         configure_requires 'ExtUtils::Foo::Baz' =&gt; '1.00';

       <b>configure_requires</b> command also takes a module name and a minimum required version if any. The difference
       from the "requires" command is that <b>configure_requires</b> is to call for modules you'll require to run "perl
       Makefile.PL". This attribute only makes sense for the latest CPAN toolchains that parse "META.yml" before
       running "perl Makefile.PL".

       The values set by <b>configure_requires</b> are passed to ExtUtils::MakeMaker as a "CONFIGURE_REQUIRES"
       attribute, which may fall back to "PREREQ_PM" if your ExtUtils::MakeMaker is not new enough.

   <b>recommends</b> <b>(Module::Install::Metadata)</b>
         recommends 'ExtUtils::Foo::Bar';
         recommends 'ExtUtils::Foo::Baz' =&gt; '1.00';

       <b>recommends</b> command also takes a module name and a minimum required version if any. As of this writing,
       "recommends" is purely advisory, only written in the "META.yml". Recommended modules will <b>not</b> usually be
       installed by the current CPAN toolchains (other system package managers may possibly prompt you to
       install them).

   <b>features,</b> <b>feature</b> <b>(Module::Install::Metadata)</b>
         feature( 'share directory support',
           -default =&gt; 1,
           'File::ShareDir' =&gt; '1.00',
         );

         features(
           'JSON support', [
             -default =&gt; 0,
             'JSON::MaybeXS' =&gt; '1.003003',
           ],
           'YAML support', [
             'YAML' =&gt; '0',
           ],
         );

       <b>feature</b> command takes a string to describe what the feature is for, and an array of (optional) modules
       and their recommended versions if any. <b>features</b> command takes an array of a description and an array of
       modules.

       As of this writing, both "feature" and "features" work only when <b>auto_install</b> (see below) is set. These
       are used to allow distribution users to choose what they install along with the distribution. This may be
       useful if the distribution has lots of optional features that may not work on all the platforms, or that
       require too many modules for average users.

       However, prompting users also hinders automated installation or smoke testing, and is considered a bad
       practice (giving sane default values is much preferred).

       Though "feature"d modules are optional and can be chosen during the installation, the chosen modules are
       treated the same as the ones set by "requires" command. (They are not listed in the "recommends" section
       in the "META.yml"). This may change in the future.

       You can add "-default =&gt; [01]" in an array of required modules in the feature(s), to set a default value
       for the prompt.

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b> <b>TO</b> <b>WRITE</b> <b>METADATA</b></h4><pre>
       These are the commands to write actual meta files.

   <b>WriteAll</b> <b>(Module::Install::WriteAll)</b>
         use inc::Module::Install;

         all_from 'lib/Foo/Bar.pm';

         WriteAll;

       <b>WriteAll</b> command is usually the last command in the "Makefile.PL". It can take several attributes, but
       you usually don't need to care unless you want to write a Makefile for an Inline-based module. This
       writes "Makefile", "META.yml", and "MYMETA.yml" (or "MYMETA.json") if you set an experimental
       environmental variable "X_MYMETA".

   <b>WriteMakefile</b> <b>(Module::Install::MakeMaker)</b>
         use inc::Module::Install;

         requires 'Foo::Baz';  # a la Module::Install

         WriteMakefile(        # a la ExtUtils::MakeMaker
           NAME =&gt; 'Foo::Bar',
           VERSION_FROM =&gt; 'lib/Foo/Bar.pm',
         );

       If you're familiar with ExtUtils::MakeMaker and generally want to stick to its way, you can. Use as much
       Module::Install's magic as you want, and then fall back to the good and old way. It just works.

   <b>write_mymeta_yaml,</b> <b>write_mymeta_json</b> <b>(Module::Install::Metadata)</b>
         write_mymeta_yaml;
         write_mymeta_json;

       <b>write_mymeta_yaml</b> command and <b>write_mymeta_json</b> command are to write "MYMETA.yml" and "MYMETA.json"
       respectively, which are new enhancement for the CPAN toolchains that eventually will allow toolchain
       modules to know what modules are required without parsing Makefile etc. These are mainly for internal use
       (in the "WriteAll" command) but you can explicitly write these commands in your Makefile.PL.

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b> <b>TO</b> <b>TWEAK</b> <b>MAKEFILE</b></h4><pre>
   <b>makemaker_args</b> <b>(Module::Install::Makefile)</b>
         makemaker_args(
           PREREQ_FATAL =&gt; 1,
           dist =&gt; { PREOP =&gt; 'pod2text lib/Foo/Bar.pm &gt; README' },
         );

       <b>makemaker_args</b> command is used in "WriteMakefile" command, and takes any attributes ExtUtils::MakeMaker
       understands. See ExtUtils::MakeMaker for the available attributes.

   <b>preamble,</b> <b>postamble</b> <b>(Module::Install::Makefile)</b>
         preamble "# my preamble\n";
         postamble qq{my_done ::\n\t\$(PERL) -e "print qq/done\\n/"\n};

       <b>preamble</b> and <b>postamble</b> commands take a string to be embedded in the "Makefile". You can add custom
       targets with this. See appropriate manuals to learn how to write Makefile.

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>TESTS</b></h4><pre>
       These are to set test files.

   <b>tests</b> <b>(Module::Install::Metadata)</b>
         tests 't/*.t t/*/*.t';

       <b>tests</b> command takes a string to specify test files. You can use wildcard characters, and if you want to
       run tests under several directories, concatenates the specs with white spaces.

       If you haven't set "tests" by any means (with explicit "tests" command, or extensions like
       Module::Install::AuthorTests or Module::Install::ExtraTests), and if you have an "xt" directory,
       Module::Install silently adds those tests under the "xt" directory when you are in the author mode, or
       you are doing release testing (with "RELEASE_TESTING" environmental variable).

       The value set by <b>tests</b> is passed to ExtUtils::MakeMaker as a "test" attribute.

   <b>tests_recurisve</b> <b>(Module::Install::Makefile)</b>
         tests_recursive;
         tests_recursive('t');

       <b>tests_recursive</b> command may take a directory, and looks for test files under it recursively. As of this
       writing, you can't use this command with other test related commands.

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b> <b>TO</b> <b>TWEAK</b> <b>DIRECTORIES</b> <b>TO</b> <b>INSTALL</b></h4><pre>
   <b>installdirs</b> <b>(Module::Install::Metadata)</b>
         installdirs 'site';

       <b>installdirs</b> command takes a directory type, and changes a directory to install modules and so on, though
       you usually don't need to use this. The value set by <b>installdirs</b> is passed to ExtUtils::MakeMaker as an
       "INSTALLDIRS" attribute.

   <b>install_as_core,</b> <b>install_as_cpan,</b> <b>install_as_site,</b> <b>install_as_vendor</b> <b>(Module::Install::Metadata)</b>
         install_as_core;   # = installdirs 'perl';
         install_as_cpan;   # = installdirs 'site';
         install_as_site;   # = installdirs 'site';
         install_as_vendor; # = installdirs 'vendor';

       <b>install_as_*</b> commands are aliases of the corresponding commands shown in the comments above.

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b> <b>TO</b> <b>INSTALL</b> <b>SUBORDINATE</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       These are to install files other than the ones under the "lib" directory.

   <b>install_script</b> <b>(Module::Install::Scripts)</b>
         install_script('foo');
         install_script('script/foo');

       <b>install_script</b> command takes a script file name, and installs it into a "script" directory for your Perl
       installation. If your script is in a "script" directory, you can omit the "script/" part.

       The value set by <b>install_script</b> is passed to ExtUtils::MakeMaker as an "EXE_FILES" attribute.

   <b>install_share</b> <b>(Module::Install::Share)</b>
         install_share;
         install_share('templates');
         install_share('dist', 'templates');
         install_share('module', 'My::WebApp', 'share');

       <b>install_share</b> command may take a directory type (either "dist" or "module"), a module name if necessary,
       and a directory ("share" by default), and installs files under the directory into a "share" directory for
       the type, which is usually in a directory your perl is installed in (but this may not be true if you're
       using local::lib and the likes).

       You can access these shared files via File::ShareDir's "dist_file" or "module_file" according to the
       type. Note also that a shared directory is usually read-only. You can't use this as a private temporary
       directory.

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>AUTO</b> <b>INSTALLATION</b></h4><pre>
   <b>auto_install</b> <b>(Module::Install::AutoInstall)</b>
         auto_install;

       The <b>auto_install</b> command is used to allow users to install dependencies of a local project when you run
       "make" after "&lt;perl Makefile.PL"&gt;. In the past this was the only sane way to pull extra dependencies
       without installing the actual module, although now there are some alternatives (which however do <b>not</b>
       completely replace "auto_install"). For example you can use "cpan ." (with newer CPAN) or "cpanm
       --installdeps ." (with App::cpanminus).

       "auto_install" also enables feature(s) commands to choose what you install (keep in mind that using
       feature() in CPAN distributions is generally considered a bad practice).

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b> <b>TO</b> <b>SUBDIRECTORY</b> <b>INSTALLATION</b></h4><pre>
       Module::Install 0.96 and above installs distributions in the subdirectories by default as
       ExtUtils::MakeMaker does. You also can specify what to install one by one.

   <b>build_subdirs</b> <b>(Module::Install::Makefile)</b>
         build_subdirs 'win32' if $^O eq 'MSWin32';

       <b>build_subdirs</b> command takes subdirectories where projects you want to install are in. The values set by
       <b>build_subdirs</b> are passed to ExtUtils::MakeMaker as a "DIR" attribute.

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b> <b>TO</b> <b>PROVIDE</b> <b>OTHER</b> <b>OPTIONAL</b> <b>META</b> <b>DATA</b></h4><pre>
       These are to provide optional meta data mainly used by the PAUSE indexer and the CPAN search site. See
       also the META-spec page (&lt;<a href="http://module-build.sourceforge.net/META-spec.html">http://module-build.sourceforge.net/META-spec.html</a>&gt;) for details.

   <b>no_index</b> <b>(Module::Install::Metadata)</b>
         no_index file      =&gt; 'lib/My/Test/Module.pm';
         no_index directory =&gt; 'templates';
         no_index package   =&gt; 'Test::Foo::Bar';
         no_index namespace =&gt; 'Test::Foo::Bar';

       <b>no_index</b> command takes a hash to describe what should be excluded from the PAUSE index etc.
       Module::Install provides several "no_index" directories by default, including "inc", "share", "(x)t",
       "test", example(s), "demo".

   <b>resources</b> <b>(Module::Install::Metadata)</b>
         resources
           license     =&gt; "<a href="http://dev.perl.org/licenses">http://dev.perl.org/licenses</a>",
           homepage    =&gt; "<a href="http://yourproject.host.org">http://yourproject.host.org</a>",
           bugtracker  =&gt; "<a href="http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/Bugs.html">http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/Bugs.html</a>?Dist=Foo-Bar",

           MailingList =&gt; "<a href="http://yourhost.com/listinfo/foo-bar">http://yourhost.com/listinfo/foo-bar</a>";

       <b>resources</b> command takes a hash that contains various URLs for the related resources. Keys in lower-case
       are reserved. These resources are written in the "META.yml".

   <b>homepage,</b> <b>bugtracker,</b> <b>repository</b> <b>(Module::Install::Metadata)</b>
         homepage   '<a href="http://example.com">http://example.com</a>';
         bugtracker '<a href="http://rt.cpan.org">http://rt.cpan.org</a>';
         repository '<a href="http://github.com/foo/bar">http://github.com/foo/bar</a>';

       <b>homepage</b>, <b>bugtracker</b>, and "repository" commands take a URL for the corresponding resource.

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b> <b>TO</b> <b>BUNDLE</b> <b>DISTRIBUTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       There are several commands to bundle modules/distributions in your distribution, but they are still
       broken in general. Don't use them for now.

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>XS</b> <b>SUPPORT</b></h4><pre>
   <b>libs</b> <b>(Module::Install::Makefile),</b> <b>cc_lib_paths,</b> <b>cc_lib_links</b> <b>(Module::Install::Compiler)</b>
         libs '-lz';
         libs [qw/-lz -Llibs/];
         cc_lib_paths 'libs';
         cc_lib_links qw/z iconv/;

       <b>libs</b> command takes a string, or an array reference of strings to be passed to ExtUtils::MakeMaker as a
       "LIBS" attribute.  <b>cc_lib_paths</b> and <b>cc_lib_links</b> are its alternatives, both of which take an array of
       strings. "cc_lib_paths" is for upper-cased "-L" (directories), and "cc_lib_links" is for lower-cased "-l"
       (libraries).

   <b>inc</b> <b>(Module::Install::Makefile),</b> <b>cc_inc_paths</b> <b>(Module::Install::Compiler)</b>
         inc '-I. -Iinclude';
         cc_inc_paths qw/. include/;

       <b>inc</b> command takes a string to be passed to ExtUtils::MakeMaker as an "INC" attribute. <b>cc_inc_paths</b> is its
