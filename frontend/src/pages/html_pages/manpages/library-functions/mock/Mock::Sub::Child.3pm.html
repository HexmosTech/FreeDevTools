</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Mock::Sub::Child - Provides for Mock::Sub

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       Please refer to the "Mock::Sub" parent module for full documentation. The descriptions here are just a
       briefing.

   <b>new</b>
       This method can only be called by the parent "Mock::Sub" module.

   <b>called</b>
       Returns bool whether the mocked sub has been called yet.

   <b>called_count</b>
       Returns an integer representing the number of times the mocked sub has been called.

   <b>called_with</b>
       Returns a list of arguments the mocked sub was called with.

   <b>mock</b>
       This method should only be called by the parent mock object. You shouldn't be calling this.

   <b>remock</b>
       Re-mocks an unmocked sub back to the same subroutine it was originally mocked with.

   <b>mocked_state</b>
       Returns bool whether the sub the object represents is currently mocked or not.

   <b>name</b>
       Returns the name of the sub this object is mocking.

   <b>return_value</b>
       Send in any values (list or scalar) that you want the mocked sub to return when called.

   <b>side_effect</b>
       Send in a code reference with any actions you want the mocked sub to perform after it's been called.

   <b>reset</b>
       Resets all state of the object back to default (does not unmock the sub).

   <b>unmock</b>
       Restores original functionality of the mocked sub, and calls "reset()" on the object.
