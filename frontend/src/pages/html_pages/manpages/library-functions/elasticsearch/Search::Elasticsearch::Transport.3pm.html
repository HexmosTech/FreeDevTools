</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Search::Elasticsearch::Transport - Provides interface between the client class and the Elasticsearch
       cluster

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 8.12

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The Transport class manages the request cycle. It receives parsed requests from the (user-facing) client
       class, and tries to execute the request on a node in the cluster, retrying a request if necessary.

       This class does Search::Elasticsearch::Role::Transport and Search::Elasticsearch::Role::Is_Sync.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
   <b>"send_get_body_as"</b>
           $e = Search::Elasticsearch-&gt;new(
               send_get_body_as =&gt; 'POST'
           );

       Certain endpoints like "<b>search()</b>" in Search::Elasticsearch::Client::6_0::Direct default to using a "GET"
       method, even when they include a request body.  Some proxy servers do not support "GET" requests with a
       body.  To work around this, the "send_get_body_as"  parameter accepts the following:

       •   "GET"

           The default.  Request bodies are sent as "GET" requests.

       •   "POST"

           The method is changed to "POST" when a body is present.

       •   "source"

           The  body  is  encoded as JSON and added to the query string as the "source" parameter.  This has the
           advantage of still being a "GET" request  (for  those  filtering  on  request  method)  but  has  the
           disadvantage  of  being  restricted in size.  The limit depends on the proxies between the client and
           Elasticsearch, but usually is around 4kB.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>perform_request()</b>
       Raw requests can be executed using the transport class as follows:

           $result = $e-&gt;transport-&gt;perform_request(
               method =&gt; 'POST',
               path   =&gt; '/_search',
               qs     =&gt; { from =&gt; 0, size =&gt; 10 },
               body   =&gt; {
                   query =&gt; {
                       match =&gt; {
                           title =&gt; "Elasticsearch clients"
                       }
                   }
               }
           );

       Other than the "method", "path", "qs" and "body" parameters, which should be  self-explanatory,  it  also
       accepts:

       "ignore"
           The HTTP error codes which should be ignored instead of throwing an error, eg "404 NOT FOUND":

               $result = $e-&gt;transport-&gt;perform_request(
                   method =&gt; 'GET',
                   path   =&gt; '/index/type/id'
                   ignore =&gt; [404],
               );

       "serialize"
           Whether the "body" should be serialized in the standard way (as plain JSON) or using the special <u>bulk</u>
           format:  "std" or "bulk".
