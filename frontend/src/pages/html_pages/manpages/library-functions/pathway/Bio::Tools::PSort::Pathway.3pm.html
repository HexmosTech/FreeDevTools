</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Bio::Tools::PSort::Pathway - an object used to define the pathway that is traversed while doing a psort
       analysis.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           $pathway = new Bio::Tools::PSort::Pathway('-path' =&gt; [ ... ]);

           @results = $pathway-&gt;traverse($seq);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The Pathway object is used to describe the pathway that is traversed while performing a psort analysis.
       Traditional psort methods [1] involved traversing a binary tree, where at every node an analysis was
       performed, and based on the result, control was directed down one of the two branches.  This version of
       PSort maintains the ability to define binary tree pathways, but allows them to be defined at runtime
       and/or loaded from a configuration file.

       Since the Pathway modules interface for defining new trees is rather low level, it is recommended that
       end users use either of the Bio::Tools::PSort::Pathway::Perl or Bio::Tools::PSort::Pathway::XML modules
       to create a binary tree.

       [1] As described in the paper 'Expert System for Predicting the Protein Localization Sites in Gram-
       Negative Bacteria' by Kenta Nakai and Minoru Kanehisa.

</pre><h4><b>CONSTRUCTOR</b></h4><pre>
           $pathway = new Bio::Tools::PSort::Pathway('-path' =&gt; [ ... ]);

       The constructor for the Pathway object accepts a single named parameter, '-path', which is an arrayref
       containing a description of the pathway.  Each node in the pathway is represented by an array ref
       containing 1 to 4 elements, which are in order, a reference to a Bio::Tools::PSort::ModuleI subclass, a
       reference to a subroutine, and two other node structures which will be executed if the subroutine returns
       either true or false values.

       Upon arriving at a node in the tree, the module is first run on the sequence being analyzed, and it's
       results is passed to the subroutine.  If the subroutine returns true, then the traversal continues with
       the third parameter, another tree node, otherwise traversal is sent down the fourth parameter, which is
       also another node in the tree.

       For example:

           $mod1 = new Bio::Tools::PSort::Module::Regexp();
           $mod2 = new Bio::Tools::PSort::Module::SCLBLAST();
           $mod3 = new Bio::Tools::PSort::Module::SPaseI();

           $func = sub {
                     my $res = shift;

                     return ($res-&gt;score()-&gt;{cyoplasm} &gt; 0.50);
                   };

           $path = [$mod1, $func, [$mod2], [$mod3]];

           $pathway = new Bio::Tools::PSort::Pathway('-path' =&gt; $path);

       This example describes a simple tree with three nodes.  The first node consists of the Regular Expression
       module.  If the result returned from the Regexp module has score higher that 0.50 for the cytoplasm
       localization, then the subroutine will return true, and control flow will be directed to the SCLBLAST
       module.  If the score is less than or equal to 0.50, the control flow will be sent to the SPaseI module.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
           @results = $pathway-&gt;traverse($seq);

       The traverse method is used to send a sequence down the pathway.  An array of Bio::Tools::PSort::Score
       object is returned (each module returns a single Score object, they are collected as the pathway is
       traversed and returned as a group).
