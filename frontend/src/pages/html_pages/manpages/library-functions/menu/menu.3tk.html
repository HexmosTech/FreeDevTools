</pre><h4><b>WIDGET-SPECIFIC</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Command-Line Name:<b>-postcommand</b>
       Database Name:  <b>postCommand</b>
       Database Class: <b>Command</b>

              If  this  option  is  specified  then  it  provides a Tcl command to execute each time the menu is
              posted.  The command is invoked by the <b>post</b> widget command before posting the menu. Note  that  in
              Tk 8.0 on Macintosh and Windows, all post-commands in a system of menus are executed before any of
              those  menus  are  posted.   This  is  due  to  the  limitations in the individual platforms' menu
              managers.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-selectcolor</b>
       Database Name:  <b>selectColor</b>
       Database Class: <b>Background</b>

              For menu entries that are check buttons or radio buttons,  this  option  specifies  the  color  to
              display in the indicator when the check button or radio button is selected.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-tearoff</b>
       Database Name:  <b>tearOff</b>
       Database Class: <b>TearOff</b>

              This  option  must  have a proper boolean value (default is false), which specifies whether or not
              the menu should include a tear-off entry at the top.  If so, it will exist as entry 0 of the  menu
              and  the  other entries will number starting at 1.  The default menu bindings arrange for the menu
              to be torn off when the tear-off entry is invoked.  This option is ignored under Aqua/macOS, where
              menus cannot be torn off.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-tearoffcommand</b>
       Database Name:  <b>tearOffCommand</b>
       Database Class: <b>TearOffCommand</b>

              If this option has a non-empty value, then it specifies a Tcl command to invoke whenever the  menu
              is  torn  off.   The actual command will consist of the value of this option, followed by a space,
              followed by the name of the menu window, followed by a space, followed by the name of the name  of
              the  torn  off menu window.  For example, if the option's value is “<b>a</b> <b>b</b>” and menu <b>.x.y</b> is torn off
              to create a new menu <b>.x.tearoff1</b>, then the command “<b>a</b> <b>b</b> <b>.x.y</b> <b>.x.tearoff1</b>” will be  invoked.   This
              option is ignored under Aqua/macOS, where menus cannot be torn off.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-title</b>
       Database Name:  <b>title</b>
       Database Class: <b>Title</b>

              The  string  will  be used to title the window created when this menu is torn off. If the title is
              NULL, then the window will have the title of the menubutton or the text of the cascade  item  from
              which this menu was invoked.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-type</b>
       Database Name:  <b>type</b>
       Database Class: <b>Type</b>

              This  option can be one of <b>menubar</b>, <b>tearoff</b>, or <b>normal</b>, and is set when the menu is created. While
              the string returned by the configuration database will change if this option is changed, this does
              not affect the menu widget's behavior. This is used by the cloning mechanism and is  not  normally
              set outside of the Tk library.

</pre><h4><b>INTRODUCTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>menu</b> command creates a new top-level window (given by the <u>pathName</u> argument) and makes it into a menu
       widget.   That menu widget can either be used as a pop-up window or applied to a <b>toplevel</b> (with its <b>-menu</b>
       option) to make it into the menubar for that toplevel.   Additional  options,  described  above,  may  be
       specified  on  the  command  line  or in the option database to configure aspects of the menu such as its
       colors and font.  The <b>menu</b> command returns its <u>pathName</u> argument.  At the time this command  is  invoked,
       there must not exist a window named <u>pathName</u>, but <u>pathName</u>'s parent must exist.

       A menu is a widget that displays a collection of one-line entries arranged in one or more columns.  There
       exist several different types of entries, each with different properties.  Entries of different types may
       be combined in a single menu.  Menu entries are not the same as entry widgets.  In fact, menu entries are
       not even distinct widgets; the entire menu is one widget.

       Menu  entries are displayed with up to three separate fields.  The main field is a label in the form of a
       text string, a bitmap, or an image, controlled by the <b>-label</b>, <b>-bitmap</b>, and <b>-image</b> options for the  entry.
       If  the   <b>-accelerator</b>  option  is specified for an entry then a second textual field is displayed to the
       right of the label.  The accelerator typically describes a keystroke sequence that may  be  used  in  the
       application  to  cause the same result as invoking the menu entry.  This is a display option, it does not
       actually set the corresponding binding (which can be achieved using the <b>bind</b> command).  The  third  field
       is  an  <u>indicator</u>.   The  indicator is present only for checkbutton or radiobutton entries.  It indicates
       whether the entry is selected or not, and is displayed to the left of the entry's string.

       In normal use, an entry becomes active (displays itself differently) whenever the mouse pointer  is  over
       the  entry.   If  a  mouse  button  is  released over the entry then the entry is <u>invoked</u>.  The effect of
       invocation is different for each type of entry; these effects are described  below  in  the  sections  on
       individual entries.

       Entries  may  be <u>disabled</u>, which causes their labels and accelerators to be displayed with dimmer colors.
       The default menu bindings will not allow a disabled entry to be activated or invoked.   Disabled  entries
       may be re-enabled, at which point it becomes possible to activate and invoke them again.

       Whenever a menu's active entry is changed, a &lt;&lt;MenuSelect&gt;&gt; virtual event is send to the menu. The active
       item  can  then  be  queried from the menu, and an action can be taken, such as setting context-sensitive
       help text for the entry.

</pre><h4><b>TYPES</b> <b>OF</b> <b>ENTRIES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>COMMAND</b> <b>ENTRIES</b>
       The most common kind of menu entry is a command entry, which behaves much like a button widget.   When  a
       command  entry  is  invoked,  a  Tcl command is executed.  The Tcl command is specified with the <b>-command</b>
       option.

   <b>SEPARATOR</b> <b>ENTRIES</b>
       A separator is an entry that is displayed as  a  horizontal  dividing  line.   A  separator  may  not  be
       activated or invoked, and it has no behavior other than its display appearance.

   <b>CHECKBUTTON</b> <b>ENTRIES</b>
       A  checkbutton menu entry behaves much like a checkbutton widget.  When it is invoked it toggles back and
       forth between the selected and deselected states.  When the entry is  selected,  a  particular  value  is
       stored  in  a  particular  global  variable  (as determined by the <b>-onvalue</b> and <b>-variable</b> options for the
       entry);  when the entry is deselected another value (determined by the <b>-offvalue</b> option) is stored in the
       global variable.  An indicator box is displayed to the left of the label in a checkbutton entry.  If  the
       entry  is selected then the indicator's center is displayed in the color given by the <b>-selectcolor</b> option
       for the entry; otherwise the indicator's center is displayed in the background color for the menu.  If  a
       <b>-command</b>  option  is specified for a checkbutton entry, then its value is evaluated as a Tcl command each
       time the entry is invoked;  this happens after toggling the entry's selected state.

   <b>RADIOBUTTON</b> <b>ENTRIES</b>
       A radiobutton menu entry behaves much like a radiobutton widget.  Radiobutton entries  are  organized  in
       groups  of  which only one entry may be selected at a time.  Whenever a particular entry becomes selected
       it stores a particular value into a particular global variable (as determined by the <b>-value</b> and <b>-variable</b>
       options for the entry).  This action causes any previously-selected entry in the same group  to  deselect
       itself.   Once an entry has become selected, any change to the entry's associated variable will cause the
       entry to deselect itself.  Grouping of radiobutton entries is determined by their  associated  variables:
       if  two  entries have the same associated variable then they are in the same group.  An indicator diamond
       is displayed to the left of the label in each radiobutton entry.  If  the  entry  is  selected  then  the
       indicator's  center  is  displayed in the color given by the <b>-selectcolor</b> option for the entry; otherwise
       the indicator's center is displayed in the background color for  the  menu.   If  a  <b>-command</b>  option  is
       specified  for  a  radiobutton entry, then its value is evaluated as a Tcl command each time the entry is
       invoked;  this happens after selecting the entry.

   <b>CASCADE</b> <b>ENTRIES</b>
       A cascade entry is one with an associated menu (determined by the <b>-menu</b> option).  Cascade  entries  allow
       the  construction  of cascading menus.  The <b>postcascade</b> widget command can be used to post and unpost the
       associated menu just next to of the cascade entry.  The associated menu must  be  a  child  of  the  menu
       containing the cascade entry (this is needed in order for menu traversal to work correctly).

       A cascade entry posts its associated menu by invoking a Tcl command of the form
              <u>menu</u> <b>post</b> <u>x</u> <u>y</u>
       where  <u>menu</u>  is  the path name of the associated menu, and <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> are the root-window coordinates of the
       upper-right corner of the cascade entry.  On Unix, the lower-level menu is unposted by  executing  a  Tcl
       command with the form
              <u>menu</u> <b>unpost</b>
       where <u>menu</u> is the name of the associated menu.  On other platforms, the platform's native code takes care
       of unposting the menu.

       If  a <b>-command</b> option is specified for a cascade entry then it is evaluated as a Tcl command whenever the
       entry is invoked. This is not supported on Windows.

   <b>TEAR-OFF</b> <b>ENTRIES</b>
       A tear-off entry appears at the top of the menu if enabled with the <b>-tearoff</b>  option.   It  is  not  like
       other  menu  entries  in that it cannot be created with the <b>add</b> widget command and cannot be deleted with
       the <b>delete</b> widget command.  When a tear-off entry is created it appears as a dashed line at  the  top  of
       the  menu.   Under the default bindings, invoking the tear-off entry causes a torn-off copy to be made of
       the menu and all of its submenus.

</pre><h4><b>MENUBARS</b></h4><pre>
       Any menu can be set as a menubar for a  toplevel  window  (see  <b>toplevel</b>  command  for  syntax).  On  the
       Macintosh, whenever the toplevel is in front, this menu's cascade items will appear in the menubar across
       the top of the main monitor. On Windows and Unix, this menu's items will be displayed in a menubar across
       the  top of the window. These menus will behave according to the interface guidelines of their platforms.
       For every menu set as a menubar, a clone menu is made. See the <b>CLONES</b> section for more information.

       As noted, menubars may behave differently on different platforms.   One  example  of  this  concerns  the
       handling  of  checkbuttons  and  radiobuttons  within  the menu.  While it is permitted to put these menu
       elements on menubars,  they  may  not  be  drawn  with  indicators  on  some  platforms,  due  to  system
       restrictions.

   <b>SPECIAL</b> <b>MENUS</b> <b>IN</b> <b>MENUBARS</b>
       Certain  menus  in  a  menubar  will  be  treated  specially.   On  the  Macintosh, access to the special
       Application, Window and Help menus is provided. On Windows, access to the Windows  System  menu  in  each
       window  is  provided.   On  X  Windows, a special right-justified help menu may be provided if Motif menu
       compatibility is enabled. In all cases, these menus must be created with the command name of the  menubar
       menu  concatenated  with the special name. So for a menubar named .menubar, on the Macintosh, the special
       menus would be .menubar.apple, .menubar.window and .menubar.help; on Windows, the special menu  would  be
       .menubar.system; on X Windows, the help menu would be .menubar.help.

       When  Tk sees a .menubar.apple menu as the first menu in a menubar on the Macintosh, that menu's contents
       make up the first items of the Application menu whenever the window containing the menubar is  in  front.
       After  all  of the Tk-defined items, the menu will have a separator, followed by all standard Application
       menu items.  Such a .apple menu must be present in a menu  when  that  menu  is  first  configured  as  a
       toplevel's  menubar,  otherwise  a  default  application  menu (hidden from Tk) will be inserted into the
       menubar at that time and subsequent addition of a .apple menu will no longer result in  it  becoming  the
       Application menu.

       When  Tk sees a .menubar.window menu on the Macintosh, the menu's contents are inserted into the standard
       Window menu of the user's menubar whenever the window's menubar is in front. The first items in the  menu
       are  provided  by  macOS, and the names of the current toplevels are automatically appended after all the
       Tk-defined items and a separator. The Window menu on the Mac also  allows  toggling  the  window  into  a
       fullscreen  state, and managing a tabbed window interface (multiple windows grouped into a single window)
       if supported by that version of the operating system.

       When Tk sees a .menubar.help menu on the Macintosh, the menu's contents are appended to the standard Help
       menu of the user's menubar whenever the window's menubar is in front. The first items  in  the  menu  are
       provided by macOS.

       When  Tk  sees  a  System  menu on Windows, its items are appended to the system menu that the menubar is
       attached to. This menu is tied to the application icon and can be invoked with the  mouse  or  by  typing
       Alt+Spacebar.   Due  to  limitations  in  the  Windows API, any font changes, colors, images, bitmaps, or
       tearoff images will not appear in the system menu.

       When Tk sees a Help menu on X Windows and Motif menu compatibility is enabled the menu  is  moved  to  be
       last  in the menubar and is right justified. Motif menu compatibility is enabled by setting the Tk option
       <b>*Menu.useMotifHelp</b> to true.

</pre><h4><b>CLONES</b></h4><pre>
       When a menu is set as a menubar for a toplevel window, or when a menu is torn off, a clone of the menu is
       made. This clone is a menu widget in its own right, but it is a child of the  original.  Changes  in  the
       configuration  of the original are reflected in the clone. Additionally, any cascades that are pointed to
       are also cloned so that menu traversal will work right. Clones are destroyed when either the  tearoff  or
       menubar goes away, or when the original menu is destroyed.

</pre><h4><b>WIDGET</b> <b>COMMAND</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>menu</b>  command  creates a new Tcl command whose name is <u>pathName</u>.  This command may be used to invoke
       various operations on the widget.  It has the following general form:
              <u>pathName</u> <u>option</u> ?<u>arg</u> <u>...</u>?
       <u>Option</u> and the <u>arg</u>s determine the exact behavior of the command.

       Many of the widget commands for a menu take as one argument an indicator of which entry of  the  menu  to
       operate on. These indicators are called <u>index</u>es and may be specified in any of the following forms:

       <b>active</b>      Indicates  the  entry  that  is  currently  active.   If no entry is active then this form is
                   equivalent to <b>{}</b>.  This form may not be abbreviated.

       <b>end</b>         Indicates the bottommost entry in the menu.  If there are no entries in the  menu  then  this
                   form is equivalent to <b>{}</b>.  This form may not be abbreviated.

       <b>last</b>        Same as <b>end</b>.

       <b>{}</b>          Indicates  “no  entry  at  all”;  this  is  used  most  commonly  with the <b>activate</b> option to
                   deactivate all the entries in the menu.  In most cases the specification of <b>{}</b> causes nothing
                   to happen in the widget command.

       <b>@</b><u>x</u><b>,</b><u>y</u>        Indicates the entry that covers the point in the menu's window specified by <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> (in pixel
                   coordinates).  If no entry covers that point, then this form is equivalent to <b>{}</b>.  If only  a
                   single number is specified, it is treated as the y-coordinate.

       <u>number</u>      Specifies  the entry numerically, where 0 corresponds to the top-most entry of the menu, 1 to
                   the entry below it, and so on.

       <u>id</u>          If the index does not satisfy one of the above forms then the menu is searched for  an  entry
                   with the specified id.

       <u>pattern</u>     If  all  of  the  above  methods  for  finding  an entry fail, this form is used.  <u>Pattern</u> is
                   pattern-matched against the label of each entry in the menu, in  order  from  the  top  down,
                   until a matching entry is found.  The rules of <b>string</b> <b>match</b> are used.

       If  the index could match more than one of the above forms, then the form earlier in the above list takes
       precedence.  Indexes support the same simple interpretation as for the command <b>string</b> <b>index</b>, with  simple
       integer index arithmetic and indexing relative to <b>end</b>.

       The following widget commands are possible for menu widgets:

       <u>pathName</u> <b>activate</b> <u>index</u>
              Change  the  state  of  the  entry  indicated by <u>index</u> to <b>active</b> and redisplay it using its active
              colors.  Any previously-active entry is deactivated.  If <u>index</u> is  specified  as  <b>{}</b>,  or  if  the
              specified entry is disabled, then the menu ends up with no active entry.  Returns an empty string.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>add</b> <u>type</u> ?<u>id</u>? ?<u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>...</u>?
              Add  a new entry to the bottom of the menu.  The new entry's type is given by <u>type</u> and must be one
              of <b>cascade</b>, <b>checkbutton</b>, <b>command</b>, <b>radiobutton</b>, or <b>separator</b>, or a unique abbreviation  of  one  of
              the  above.   If  the  <u>id</u>  argument  is specified, it is used as the entry identifier; <u>id</u> must not
              already exist in the menu. Otherwise,  a  new  unique  identifier  is  generated.   If  additional
              arguments  are  present,  they specify the options listed in the <b>MENU</b> <b>ENTRY</b> <b>OPTIONS</b> section below.
              The <b>add</b> widget command returns the id of the new entry.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>cget</b> <u>option</u>
              Returns the current value of the configuration option given by <u>option</u>.  <u>Option</u> may have any of the
              values accepted by the <b>menu</b> command.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>clone</b> <u>newPathname</u> ?<u>cloneType</u>?
              Makes a clone of the current menu named <u>newPathName</u>. This clone is a menu in its  own  right,  but
              any  changes  to  the  clone  are propagated to the original menu and vice versa. <u>cloneType</u> can be
              <b>normal</b>, <b>menubar</b>, or <b>tearoff</b>. Should not normally be called outside of  the  Tk  library.  See  the
              <b>CLONES</b> section for more information.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>configure</b> ?<u>option</u>? ?<u>value</u> <u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>...</u>?
              Query  or  modify  the  configuration options of the widget.  If no <u>option</u> is specified, returns a
              list describing all of the available options for <u>pathName</u> (see <b>Tk_ConfigureInfo</b> for information on
              the format of this list).  If <u>option</u> is specified with no <u>value</u>, then the command returns  a  list
              describing  the  one named option (this list will be identical to the corresponding sublist of the
              value returned if no <u>option</u> is specified).  If one or more <u>option-value</u> pairs are specified,  then
              the  command  modifies  the  given  widget option(s) to have the given value(s);  in this case the
              command returns an empty string.  <u>Option</u> may have any of the values accepted by the <b>menu</b> command.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>delete</b> <u>index1</u> ?<u>index2</u>?
              Delete all of the menu entries between <u>index1</u> and <u>index2</u> inclusive.  If <u>index2</u> is omitted then  it
              defaults  to  <u>index1</u>.   Attempts  to delete a tear-off menu entry are ignored (instead, you should
              change the <b>-tearoff</b> option to remove the tear-off entry).

       <u>pathName</u> <b>entrycget</b> <u>index</u> <u>option</u>
              Returns the current value of a configuration option for the entry given by <u>index</u>.  <u>Option</u> may have
              any of the names described in the <b>MENU</b> <b>ENTRY</b> <b>OPTIONS</b> section below.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>entryconfigure</b> <u>index</u> ?<u>options...</u>?
              This command is similar to the <b>configure</b> command, except that it applies to  the  options  for  an
              individual  entry,  whereas <b>configure</b> applies to the options for the menu as a whole.  <u>Options</u> may
              have any of the values described in  the  <b>MENU</b>  <b>ENTRY</b>  <b>OPTIONS</b>  section  below.   If  <u>options</u>  are
              specified,  options  are  modified  as  indicated  in the command and the command returns an empty
              string.  If no <u>options</u> are specified, returns a list describing  the  current  options  for  entry
              <u>index</u> (see <b>Tk_ConfigureInfo</b> for information on the format of this list).

       <u>pathName</u> <b>id</b> <u>index</u>
              Returns  the id of the menu entry given by <u>index</u>.  This is the identifier that was assigned to the
              entry when it was created using the <b>add</b> or <b>insert</b> widget command.  Returns an empty string for the
              tear-off entry, or if <u>index</u> is equivalent to <b>{}</b>.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>index</b> <u>index</u>
              Returns the numerical index corresponding to <u>index</u>, or <b>{}</b> if <u>index</u> was specified as <b>{}</b>.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>insert</b> <u>index</u> <u>type</u> ?<u>id</u>? ?<u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>...</u>?
              Same as the <b>add</b> widget command except that it inserts the new entry just before the entry given by
              <u>index</u>, instead of appending to the end of the menu.  The <u>type</u>, <u>id</u>,  <u>option</u>,  and  <u>value</u>  arguments
              have the same interpretation as for the <b>add</b> widget command.  It is not possible to insert new menu
              entries  before the tear-off entry, if the menu has one.  The <b>insert</b> widget command returns the id
              of the new entry.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>invoke</b> <u>index</u>
              Invoke the action of the menu entry.  See the sections on the individual entries above for details
              on what happens.  If the menu entry is disabled then nothing happens.  If the entry has a  command
              associated  with it then the result of that command is returned as the result of the <b>invoke</b> widget
              command.  Otherwise the result is an  empty  string.   Note:   invoking  a  menu  entry  does  not
              automatically  unpost  the  menu;  the default bindings normally take care of this before invoking
              the <b>invoke</b> widget command.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>post</b> <u>x</u> <u>y</u> ?<u>index</u>?
              Arrange for the menu to be displayed on the screen at the root-window coordinates given by  <u>x</u>  and
              <u>y</u>.   If  an  index  is  specified  the  menu  will be located so that the entry with that index is
              displayed at the point.  These coordinates are adjusted if necessary to guarantee that the  entire
              menu  is  visible  on  the  screen.   This  command  normally  returns  an  empty  string.  If the
              <b>-postcommand</b> option has been specified, then its value is executed as a Tcl script before  posting
              the  menu  and the result of that script is returned as the result of the <b>post</b> widget command.  If
              an error returns while executing the command, then the error is returned without posting the menu.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>postcascade</b> <u>index</u>
              Posts the submenu associated with the cascade entry given by <u>index</u>,  and  unposts  any  previously
              posted  submenu.   If  <u>index</u> does not correspond to a cascade entry, or if <u>pathName</u> is not posted,
              the command has no effect except to unpost any currently posted submenu.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>type</b> <u>index</u>
              Returns the type of the menu entry given by <u>index</u>.  This is the <u>type</u> argument passed to the <b>add</b> or
              <b>insert</b> widget command when the entry was created, such as <b>command</b> or <b>separator</b>, or <b>tearoff</b>  for  a
              tear-off entry.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>unpost</b>
              Unmap  the  window  so  that it is no longer displayed.  If a lower-level cascaded menu is posted,
              unpost that menu.  Returns an empty string. This subcommand does  not  work  on  Windows  and  the
              Macintosh, as those platforms have their own way of unposting menus.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>xposition</b> <u>index</u>
              Returns  a  decimal string giving the x-coordinate within the menu window of the leftmost pixel in
              the entry specified by <u>index</u>.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>yposition</b> <u>index</u>
              Returns a decimal string giving the y-coordinate within the menu window of the  topmost  pixel  in
              the entry specified by <u>index</u>.

</pre><h4><b>MENU</b> <b>ENTRY</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following options are allowed on menu entries. Most options are not supported by all entry types.

       <b>-activebackground</b> <u>value</u>
              Specifies  a  background  color to use for displaying this entry when it is active. This option is
              ignored on  Aqua/macOS.   If  it  is  specified  as  an  empty  string  (the  default),  then  the
              <b>-activebackground</b>  option  for  the overall menu is used.  If the <b>tk_strictMotif</b> variable has been
              set to request strict Motif compliance, then this option is ignored and the <b>-background</b> option  is
              used in its place.  This option is not available for separator or tear-off entries.

       <b>-activeforeground</b> <u>value</u>
              Specifies  a foreground color to use for displaying this entry when it is active.   This option is
              ignored on Aqua/macOS.  If this option is specified as an empty string  (the  default),  then  the
              <b>-activeforeground</b> option for the overall menu is used.

       <b>-accelerator</b> <u>value</u>
              Specifies  a  string  to  display  at  the  right  side  of the menu entry.  Normally describes an
              accelerator keystroke sequence that may be used to invoke the same function  as  the  menu  entry.
              This  is  a  display  option,  it  does  not  actually set the corresponding binding (which can be
              achieved using the <b>bind</b> command). This option is not available for separator or tear-off entries.

       <b>-background</b> <u>value</u>
              Specifies a background color to use for displaying this entry when  it  is  in  the  normal  state
              (neither  active  nor  disabled).  This option is ignored on Aqua/macOS.  If it is specified as an
              empty string (the default), then the <b>-background</b> option for the overall menu is used.  This option
              is not available for separator or tear-off entries.

       <b>-bitmap</b> <u>value</u>
              Specifies a bitmap to display in the menu instead of a textual label, in any of the forms accepted
              by <b>Tk_GetBitmap</b>.  This option overrides the <b>-label</b> option (as controlled by the <b>-compound</b>  option)
              but may be reset to an empty string to enable a textual label to be displayed.  If a <b>-image</b> option
              has  been specified, it overrides <b>-bitmap</b>.  This option is not available for separator or tear-off
              entries.

       <b>-columnbreak</b> <u>value</u>
              When this option is zero, the entry appears below the previous entry. When this option is one, the
              entry appears at the top of a new column in the menu.  This option is ignored on Aqua/macOS, where
              menus are always a single column.

       <b>-command</b> <u>value</u>
              Specifies a Tcl command to execute when the menu entry is invoked.  Not available for separator or
              tear-off entries.

       <b>-compound</b> <u>value</u>
              Specifies whether the menu entry should display both an image and text, and if so, where the image
              should be placed relative to the text.  Valid values for this option  are  <b>bottom</b>,  <b>center</b>,  <b>left</b>,
              <b>none</b>,  <b>right</b>  and  <b>top</b>.  The default value is <b>none</b>, meaning that the button will display either an
              image or text, depending on the values of the <b>-image</b> and <b>-bitmap</b> options.

       <b>-font</b> <u>value</u>
              Specifies the font to use when drawing the label or accelerator string in  this  entry.   If  this
              option is specified as an empty string (the default) then the <b>-font</b> option for the overall menu is
              used.  This option is not available for separator or tear-off entries.

       <b>-foreground</b> <u>value</u>
              Specifies  a  foreground  color  to  use  for displaying this entry when it is in the normal state
              (neither active nor disabled).  This option is ignored on Aqua/macOS.  If it is  specified  as  an
              empty string (the default), then the <b>-foreground</b> option for the overall menu is used.  This option
              is not available for separator or tear-off entries.

       <b>-hidemargin</b> <u>value</u>
              Specifies  whether  the  standard margins should be drawn for this menu entry. This is useful when
              creating palette with images in them, i.e., color palettes, pattern  palettes,  etc.  1  indicates
              that the margin for the entry is hidden; 0 means that the margin is used.

       <b>-image</b> <u>value</u>
              Specifies an image to display in the menu instead of a text string or bitmap.  The image must have
              been  created  by  some previous invocation of <b>image</b> <b>create</b>.  This option overrides the <b>-label</b> and
              <b>-bitmap</b> options (as controlled by the <b>-compound</b> option) but may be reset to  an  empty  string  to
              enable  a  textual or bitmap label to be displayed.  This option is not available for separator or
              tear-off entries.

       <b>-indicatoron</b> <u>value</u>
              Available only for checkbutton and radiobutton  entries.   <u>Value</u>  is  a  boolean  that  determines
              whether or not the indicator should be displayed.

       <b>-label</b> <u>value</u>
              Specifies  a  string  to  display  as  an  identifying label in the menu entry.  Not available for
              separator or tear-off entries.

       <b>-menu</b> <u>value</u>
              Available only for cascade entries.  Specifies the path name of the submenu associated  with  this
              entry.  The submenu must be a child of the menu.

       <b>-offvalue</b> <u>value</u>
              Available  only  for  checkbutton entries.  Specifies the value to store in the entry's associated
              variable when the entry is deselected.

       <b>-onvalue</b> <u>value</u>
              Available only for checkbutton entries.  Specifies the value to store in  the  entry's  associated
              variable when the entry is selected.

       <b>-selectcolor</b> <u>value</u>
              Available  only  for  checkbutton  and radiobutton entries.  Specifies the color to display in the
              indicator when the entry is selected.  If the value is an empty  string  (the  default)  then  the
              <b>-selectcolor</b> option for the menu determines the indicator color.

       <b>-selectimage</b> <u>value</u>
              Available  only  for  checkbutton  and  radiobutton entries.  Specifies an image to display in the
              entry (in place of the <b>-image</b> option) when it is selected.  <u>Value</u> is the name of an  image,  which
              must have been created by some previous invocation of <b>image</b> <b>create</b>.  This option is ignored unless
              the <b>-image</b> option has been specified.

       <b>-state</b> <u>value</u>
              Specifies  one  of  three states for the entry:  <b>normal</b>, <b>active</b>, or <b>disabled</b>.  In normal state the
              entry is displayed using the <b>-foreground</b> option for the menu and the <b>-background</b> option  from  the
              entry  or  the  menu.   The active state is typically used when the pointer is over the entry.  In
              active state the entry is displayed using the <b>-activeforeground</b> option for the menu along with the
              <b>-activebackground</b> option  from  the  entry.   Disabled  state  means  that  the  entry  should  be
              insensitive:  the default bindings will refuse to activate or invoke the entry.  In this state the
              entry  is  displayed  according to the <b>-disabledforeground</b> option for the menu and the <b>-background</b>
              option from the entry.  This option is not available for separator entries.

       <b>-underline</b> <u>value</u>
              Specifies the integer index of a character to underline in the entry.  This option is also queried
              by the default bindings and used to implement keyboard traversal.   0  corresponds  to  the  first
              character  of the text displayed in the entry, 1 to the next character, and so on.  If a bitmap or
              image is displayed in the entry then this option is ignored.  This option  is  not  available  for
              separator or tear-off entries.

       <b>-value</b> <u>value</u>
              Available  only  for  radiobutton entries.  Specifies the value to store in the entry's associated
              variable when the entry is selected.  If an empty string is specified, then the <b>-label</b> option  for
              the entry as the value to store in the variable.

       <b>-variable</b> <u>value</u>
              Available  only  for checkbutton and radiobutton entries.  Specifies the name of a global variable
              to set when the entry is selected.  For checkbutton entries the variable  is  also  set  when  the
              entry is deselected.  For radiobutton entries, changing the variable causes the currently-selected
              entry to deselect itself.

              For checkbutton entries, the default value of this option is taken from the <b>-label</b> option, and for
              radiobutton  entries  a  single  fixed  value  is  used. It is recommended that you always set the
              <b>-variable</b> option when creating either a checkbutton or a radiobutton.

</pre><h4><b>MENU</b> <b>CONFIGURATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The default bindings support four different ways of using menus:

       <b>Pulldown</b> <b>Menus</b> <b>in</b> <b>Menubar</b>
              This is the most common case. You create a menu widget that will become the menu bar. You then add
              cascade entries to this menu, specifying the pull down menus you wish to use in your menu bar. You
              then create all of the pulldowns. Once you have done this, specify the menu using the <b>-menu</b> option
              of the toplevel's widget command. See the <b>toplevel</b> manual entry for details.

       <b>Pulldown</b> <b>Menus</b> <b>in</b> <b>Menu</b> <b>Buttons</b>
              This is the compatible way to do menu bars.  You create one menubutton widget for  each  top-level
              menu,  and  typically  you arrange a series of menubuttons in a row in a menubar window.  You also
              create the top-level menus and any cascaded submenus, and tie them together with <b>-menu</b> options  in
              menubuttons  and  cascade menu entries.  The top-level menu must be a child of the menubutton, and
              each submenu must be a child of the menu that refers to it.  Once you have done this, the  default
              bindings  will  allow  users to traverse and invoke the tree of menus via its menubutton;  see the
              <b>menubutton</b> manual entry for details.

       <b>Popup</b> <b>Menus</b>
              Popup menus typically post in response to a mouse button press or keystroke.  You create the popup
              menus and any cascaded submenus, then you call the <b>tk_popup</b> procedure at the appropriate  time  to
              post the top-level menu.

       <b>Option</b> <b>Menus</b>
              An  option  menu consists of a menubutton with an associated menu that allows you to select one of
              several values.  The current value is displayed in the menubutton and is also stored in  a  global
              variable.  Use the <b>tk_optionMenu</b> procedure to create option menubuttons and their menus.

       <b>Torn-off</b> <b>Menus</b>
              You  create  a  torn-off  menu by invoking the tear-off entry at the top of an existing menu.  The
              default bindings will create a new menu that  is  a  copy  of  the  original  menu  and  leave  it
              permanently posted as a top-level window.  The torn-off menu behaves just the same as the original
              menu.

</pre><h4><b>DEFAULT</b> <b>BINDINGS</b></h4><pre>
       Tk automatically creates class bindings for menus that give them the following default behavior:

       [1]    When the mouse enters a menu, the entry underneath the mouse cursor activates;  as the mouse moves
              around the menu, the active entry changes to track the mouse.

       [2]    When the mouse leaves a menu all of the entries in the menu deactivate, except in the special case
              where the mouse moves from a menu to a cascaded submenu.

       [3]    When  a  button  is  released  over  a  menu, the active entry (if any) is invoked.  The menu also
              unposts unless it is a torn-off menu.

       [4]    The Space and Return keys invoke the active entry and unpost the menu.

       [5]    If any of the entries in a menu have letters underlined with the <b>-underline</b> option, then  pressing
              one  of the underlined letters (or its upper-case or lower-case equivalent) invokes that entry and
              unposts the menu.

       [6]    The Escape key aborts a menu selection in progress without invoking any entry.   It  also  unposts
              the menu unless it is a torn-off menu.

       [7]    The  Up  and  Down  keys activate the next higher or lower entry in the menu.  When one end of the
              menu is reached, the active entry wraps around to the other end.

       [8]    The Left key moves to the next menu to the left.  If the current menu is a cascaded submenu,  then
              the  submenu  is  unposted and the current menu entry becomes the cascade entry in the parent.  If
              the current menu is a top-level menu posted from a menubutton,  then  the  current  menubutton  is
              unposted  and  the  next  menubutton to the left is posted.  Otherwise the key has no effect.  The
              left-right order of menubuttons is determined by their stacking order:  Tk assumes that the lowest
              menubutton (which by default is the first one created) is on the left.

       [9]    The Right key moves to the next menu to the right.  If the current entry is a cascade entry,  then
              the  submenu  is  posted  and  the   current  menu  entry  becomes the first entry in the submenu.
              Otherwise, if the current menu was posted from  a  menubutton,  then  the  current  menubutton  is
              unposted and the next menubutton to the right is posted.

       Disabled  menu entries are non-responsive:  they do not activate and they ignore mouse button presses and
       releases.

       Several of the bindings make use of the command <b>tk_menuSetFocus</b>.  It saves the current focus and sets the
       focus to its <u>pathName</u> argument, which is a menu widget.

       The behavior of menus can be changed by defining new bindings for individual widgets or by redefining the
       class bindings.
