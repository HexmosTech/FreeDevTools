       Tk::Menu - Create and manipulate Menu widgets

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           <u>$menu</u> = <u>$parent</u>-&gt;<b>Menu</b>(?<u>options</u>?);

</pre><h4><b>STANDARD</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-activebackground</b>   <b>-background</b>    <b>-disabledforeground</b> <b>-relief</b>
       <b>-activeborderwidth</b>  <b>-borderwidth</b>   <b>-font</b>     <b>-takefocus</b> <b>-activeforeground</b>   <b>-cursor</b>   <b>-foreground</b>

       See Tk::options for details of the standard options.

</pre><h4><b>WIDGET-SPECIFIC</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Name:     <b>postCommand</b>
       Class:    <b>Command</b>
       Switch:   <b>-postcommand</b>
           If this option is specified then it provides a callback to execute each time the menu is posted.  The
           callback  is  invoked  by  the <b>post</b> method before posting the menu. Note that in 8.0 on Macintosh and
           Windows, all commands in a menu systems are executed before any  are  posted.  This  is  due  to  the
           limitations in the individual platforms' menu managers.

       Name:     <b>selectColor</b>
       Class:    <b>Background</b>
       Switch:   <b>-selectcolor</b>
           For  menu entries that are check buttons or radio buttons, this option specifies the color to display
           in the indicator when the check button or radio button is selected.

       Name:     <b>tearOff</b>
       Class:    <b>TearOff</b>
       Switch:   <b>-tearoff</b>
           This option must have a proper boolean value, which specifies whether or not the menu should  include
           a  tear-off entry at the top.  If so, it will exist as entry 0 of the menu and the other entries will
           number starting at 1.  The default menu bindings arrange for the menu to be torn off when  the  tear-
           off entry is invoked.

       Name:     <b>tearOffCommand</b>
       Class:    <b>TearOffCommand</b>
       Switch:   <b>-tearoffcommand</b>
           If  this  option  has  a non-empty value, then it specifies a perl/Tk callback to invoke whenever the
           menu is torn off.  The actual command will consist of the value of this option, followed by a  space,
           followed by the name of the menu window, followed by a space, followed by the name of the name of the
           torn  off menu window.  For example, if the option's is ``<b>a</b> <b>b</b>'' and menu <b>.x.y</b> is torn off to create a
           new menu <b>.x.tearoff1</b>, then the command ``<b>a</b> <b>b</b> <b>.x.y</b> <b>.x.tearoff1</b>'' will be invoked.

       Name:     <b>title</b>
       Class:    <b>Title</b>
       Switch:   <b>-title</b>
           The string will be used to title the window created when this menu is torn off. If the title is NULL,
           then the window will have the title of the menubutton or the text of the cascade item from which this
           menu was invoked.

       Name:     <b>type</b>
       Class:    <b>Type</b>
       Switch:   <b>-type</b>
           This option can be one of <b>menubar</b>, <b>tearoff</b>, or <b>normal</b>, and is set when the menu is created. While the
           string returned by the configuration database will change if this option is changed,  this  does  not
           affect  the  menu  widget's  behavior.  This is used by the cloning mechanism and is not normally set
           outside of the Tk library.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>Menu</b> method creates a new top-level window (given by the $widget argument) and makes it into  a  menu
       widget.   Additional  options,  described  above,  may  be specified on the command line or in the option
       database to configure aspects of the menu such as its colors and font.   The  <b>menu</b>  command  returns  its
       $widget  argument.  At the time this command is invoked, there must not exist a window named $widget, but
       $widget's parent must exist.

       A menu is a widget that displays a collection of one-line entries arranged in one or more columns.  There
       exist several different types of entries, each with different properties.  Entries of different types may
       be combined in a single menu.  Menu entries are not the same as entry widgets.  In fact, menu entries are
       not even distinct widgets; the entire menu is one widget.

       Menu entries are displayed with up to three separate fields.  The main field is a label in the form of  a
       text  string, a bitmap, or an image, controlled by the <b>-label</b>, <b>-bitmap</b>, and <b>-image</b> options for the entry.
       If the  <b>-accelerator</b> option is specified for an entry then a second textual field  is  displayed  to  the
       right  of  the  label.  The accelerator typically describes a keystroke sequence that may be typed in the
       application to cause the same result as invoking the menu entry.  The third field is an  <u>indicator</u>.   The
       indicator  is  present  only  for  checkbutton or radiobutton entries.  It indicates whether the entry is
       selected or not, and is displayed to the left of the entry's string.

       In normal use, an entry becomes active (displays itself differently) whenever the mouse pointer  is  over
       the  entry.   If  a  mouse  button  is  released over the entry then the entry is <u>invoked</u>.  The effect of
       invocation is different for each type of entry; these effects are described  below  in  the  sections  on
       individual entries.

       Entries  may  be <u>disabled</u>, which causes their labels and accelerators to be displayed with dimmer colors.
       The default menu bindings will not allow a disabled entry to be activated or invoked.   Disabled  entries
       may be re-enabled, at which point it becomes possible to activate and invoke them again.

       Whenever a menu's active entry is changed, a &lt;&lt;MenuSelect&gt;&gt; virtual event is sent to the menu. The active
       item  can  then  be  queried from the menu, and an action can be taken, such as setting context-sensitive
       help text for the entry.

   <b>COMMAND</b> <b>ENTRIES</b>
       The most common kind of menu entry is a command entry, which behaves much like a button widget.   When  a
       command entry is invoked, a callback is executed.  The callback is specified with the <b>-command</b> option.

   <b>SEPARATOR</b> <b>ENTRIES</b>
       A  separator  is  an  entry  that  is  displayed  as  a horizontal dividing line.  A separator may not be
       activated or invoked, and it has no behavior other than its display appearance.

   <b>CHECKBUTTON</b> <b>ENTRIES</b>
       A checkbutton menu entry behaves much like a checkbutton widget.  When it is invoked it toggles back  and
       forth  between  the  selected  and  deselected states.  When the entry is selected, a particular value is
       stored in a particular global variable (as determined by the  <b>-onvalue</b>  and  <b>-variable</b>  options  for  the
       entry);  when the entry is deselected another value (determined by the <b>-offvalue</b> option) is stored in the
       global  variable.  An indicator box is displayed to the left of the label in a checkbutton entry.  If the
       entry is selected then the indicator's center is displayed in the color given by the <b>-selectcolor</b>  option
       for  the entry; otherwise the indicator's center is displayed in the background color for the menu.  If a
       <b>-command</b> option is specified for a checkbutton entry, then its value is evaluated each time the entry  is
       invoked;  this happens after toggling the entry's selected state.

   <b>RADIOBUTTON</b> <b>ENTRIES</b>
       A  radiobutton  menu  entry behaves much like a radiobutton widget.  Radiobutton entries are organized in
       groups of which only one entry may be selected at a time.  Whenever a particular entry  becomes  selected
       it stores a particular value into a particular global variable (as determined by the <b>-value</b> and <b>-variable</b>
       options  for  the entry).  This action causes any previously-selected entry in the same group to deselect
       itself.  Once an entry has become selected, any change to the entry's associated variable will cause  the
       entry  to  deselect itself.  Grouping of radiobutton entries is determined by their associated variables:
       if two entries have the same associated variable then they are in the same group.  An  indicator  diamond
       is  displayed  to  the  left  of  the label in each radiobutton entry.  If the entry is selected then the
       indicator's center is displayed in the color given by the <b>-selectcolor</b> option for  the  entry;  otherwise
       the  indicator's  center  is  displayed  in  the  background color for the menu.  If a <b>-command</b> option is
       specified for a radiobutton entry, then its value is evaluated each time  the  entry  is  invoked;   this
       happens after selecting the entry.

   <b>CASCADE</b> <b>ENTRIES</b>
       A  cascade  entry is one with an associated menu (determined by the <b>-menu</b> option).  Cascade entries allow
       the construction of cascading menus.  The  <b>postcascade</b>  method  can  be  used  to  post  and  unpost  the
       associated  menu  just  next  to  of  the cascade entry.  The associated menu must be a child of the menu
       containing the cascade entry (this is needed in order for menu traversal to work correctly).

       A cascade entry posts its associated menu by invoking

           <u>$menu</u>-&gt;<b>post</b>(<u>x,y</u>)

       where <u>menu</u> is the path name of the associated menu, and <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> are the root-window  coordinates  of  the
       upper-right corner of the cascade entry.  On Unix, the lower-level menu is unposted by executing

           <u>$menu</u>-&gt;<b>unpost</b>

       where <u>menu</u> is the name of the associated menu.  On other platforms, the platform's native code takes care
       of unposting the menu.

       If a <b>-command</b> option is specified for a cascade entry then it is evaluated whenever the entry is invoked.
       This is not supported on Windows.

   <b>TEAR-OFF</b> <b>ENTRIES</b>
       A tear-off entry appears at the top of the menu if enabled with the <b>tearOff</b> option.  It is not like other
       menu  entries  in  that  it  cannot  be created with the <b>add</b> method and cannot be deleted with the <b>delete</b>
       method.  When a tear-off entry is created it appears as a dashed line at the top of the menu.  Under  the
       default  bindings,  invoking  the tear-off entry causes a torn-off copy to be made of the menu and all of
       its submenus.

   <b>MENUBARS</b>
       Any menu can be set as a menubar for a toplevel window (see the Toplevel constructor for syntax). On  the
       Macintosh, whenever the toplevel is in front, this menu's cascade items will appear in the menubar across
       the  top  of  the  main  monitor.  On  Windows and Unix, this menu's items will be displayed in a menubar
       accross the top of the window. These menus will behave according to the  interface  guidelines  of  their
       platforms. For every menu set as a menubar, a clone menu is made. See "CLONES" for more information.

       As  noted,  menubars  may  behave differently on different platforms.   One example  of this concerns the
       handling of checkbuttons and radiobuttons within the menu.  While it  is  permitted  to  put  these  menu
       elements   on  menubars,   they  may  not  be  drawn  with  indicators  on  some platforms, due to system
       restrictions.

   <b>SPECIAL</b> <b>MENUS</b> <b>IN</b> <b>MENUBARS</b>
       Certain menus in a menubar will be treated specially.  On the Macintosh, access to the special Apple  and
       Help  menus  is  provided. On Windows, access to the Windows System menu in each window is provided. On X
       Windows, a special right-justified help menu is provided. In all cases, these menus must be created  with
       the command name of the menubar menu concatenated with the special name. So for a menubar named .menubar,
       on  the  Macintosh,  the special menus would be .menubar.apple and .menubar.help; on Windows, the special
       menu would be .menubar.system; on X Windows, the help menu would be .menubar.help.

       When Tk sees an Apple menu on the Macintosh, that menu's contents make up the first items  of  the  Apple
       menu on the screen whenever the window containing the menubar is in front. The menu is the first one that
       the  user  sees and has a title which is an Apple logo.  After all of the Tk-defined items, the menu will
       have a separator, followed by all of the items in the user's Apple Menu Items folder.  Since  the  System
       uses  a different menu definition procedure for the Apple menu than Tk uses for its menus, and the system
       APIs do not fully support everything Tk tries to do, the menu item will only have its text displayed.  No
       font  attributes,  images,  bitmaps, or colors will be displayed. In addition, a menu with a tearoff item
       will have the tearoff item displayed as "(TearOff)".

       When Tk see a Help menu on the Macintosh, the menu's contents are appended to the standard help  menu  on
       the  right of the user's menubar whenever the user's menubar is in front. The first items in the menu are
       provided by Apple. Similar to the Apple Menu, cusomization in this menu is limited  to  what  the  system
       provides.

       When  Tk  sees  a  System  menu on Windows, its items are appended to the system menu that the menubar is
       attached to. This menu has an icon representing a spacebar, and can be  invoked  with  the  mouse  or  by
       typing  Alt+Spacebar.   Due to limitations in the Windows API, any font changes, colors, images, bitmaps,
       or tearoff images will not appear in the system menu.

       When Tk see a Help menu on X Windows, the menu is moved to be last in the menubar and is right justified.

   <b>CLONES</b>
       When a menu is set as a menubar for a toplevel window, or when a menu is torn off, a clone of the menu is
       made. This clone is a menu widget in its own right, but it is a child of the  original.  Changes  in  the
       configuration  of the original are reflected in the clone. Additionally, any cascades that are pointed to
       are also cloned so that menu traversal will work right. Clones are destroyed when either the  tearoff  or
       menubar goes away, or when the original menu is destroyed.

   <b>WIDGET</b> <b>METHODS</b>
       The  <b>Menu</b>  method creates a widget object.  This object supports the <b>configure</b> and <b>cget</b> methods described
       in Tk::options which can be used to enquire and modify the options  described  above.   The  widget  also
       inherits all the methods provided by the generic Tk::Widget class, and the Tk::Wm class.

       Many  of  the  methods for a menu take as one argument an indicator of which entry of the menu to operate
       on.  These indicators are called <u>index</u>es and may be specified in any of the following forms:

       <u>number</u>
           Specifies the entry numerically, where 0 corresponds to the top-most entry of  the  menu,  1  to  the
           entry below it, and so on.

       <b>active</b>
           Indicates  the entry that is currently active.  If no entry is active then this form is equivalent to
           <b>none</b>.  This form may not be abbreviated.

       <b>end</b> Indicates the bottommost entry in the menu.  If there are no entries in the menu then  this  form  is
           equivalent to <b>none</b>.  This form may not be abbreviated.

       <b>last</b>
           Same as <b>end</b>.

       <b>none</b>
           Indicates ``no entry at all'';  this is used most commonly with the <b>activate</b> option to deactivate all
           the  entries  in  the  menu.  In most cases the specification of <b>none</b> causes nothing to happen in the
           method.  This form may not be abbreviated.

       <b>@</b><u>number</u>
           In this form, <u>number</u> is treated as a y-coordinate in the menu's window;  the entry  closest  to  that
           y-coordinate is used.  For example, ``<b>@0</b>'' indicates the top-most entry in the window.

       <u>pattern</u>
           If  the  index  doesn't  satisfy  one of the above forms then this form is used.  <u>Pattern</u> is pattern-
           matched against the label of each entry in the menu, in order from the top  down,  until  a  matching
           entry is found.  (In perl/Tk the matching is under review, but exact match should work.)

       The following methods are possible for menu widgets:

       <u>$menu</u>-&gt;<b>activate</b>(<u>index</u>)
           Change  the state of the entry indicated by <u>index</u> to <b>active</b> and redisplay it using its active colors.
           Any previously-active entry is deactivated.  If <u>index</u> is specified as <b>none</b>, or if the specified entry
           is disabled, then the menu ends up with no active entry.  Returns an empty string.

       <u>$menu</u>-&gt;<b>add</b>(<u>type,</u> ?<u>option,</u> <u>value,</u> <u>option,</u> <u>value,</u> <u>...</u>?)
           Add a new entry to the bottom of the menu.  The new entry's type is given by <u>type</u> and must be one  of
           <b>cascade</b>,  <b>checkbutton</b>,  <b>command</b>,  <b>radiobutton</b>,  or  <b>separator</b>, or a unique abbreviation of one of the
           above.  If additional arguments are present, they specify any of the following options:

           <b>-activebackground</b> =&gt; <u>value</u>
                   Specifies a background color to use for displaying this entry when it  is  active.   If  this
                   option  is  specified  as an empty string (the default), then the <b>activeBackground</b> option for
                   the overall menu is used.  If the <b>$Tk::strictMotif</b> variable has been set  to  request  strict
                   Motif  compliance,  then  this  option  is  ignored and the <b>-background</b> option is used in its
                   place.  This option is not available for separator or tear-off entries.

           <b>-activeforeground</b> =&gt; <u>value</u>
                   Specifies a foreground color to use for displaying this entry when it  is  active.   If  this
                   option  is  specified  as an empty string (the default), then the <b>activeForeground</b> option for
                   the overall menu is used.  This option is not available for separator or tear-off entries.

           <b>-accelerator</b> =&gt; <u>value</u>
                   Specifies a string to display at the right side of the menu  entry.   Normally  describes  an
                   accelerator  keystroke  sequence  that  may  be typed to invoke the same function as the menu
                   entry.  This option is not available for separator or tear-off entries.

           <b>-background</b> =&gt; <u>value</u>
                   Specifies a background color to use for displaying this entry when it is in the normal  state
                   (neither active nor disabled).  If this option is specified as an empty string (the default),
                   then  the  <b>background</b>  option for the overall menu is used.  This option is not available for
                   separator or tear-off entries.

           <b>-bitmap</b> =&gt; <u>value</u>
                   Specifies a bitmap to display in the menu instead of a textual label, in  any  of  the  forms
                   accepted  by  <b>Tk_GetBitmap</b>.   This  option overrides the <b>-label</b> option but may be reset to an
                   empty string to enable a textual label  to  be  displayed.   If  a  <b>-image</b>  option  has  been
                   specified,  it  overrides  <b>-bitmap</b>.   This  option is not available for separator or tear-off
                   entries.

           <b>-columnbreak</b> =&gt; <u>value</u>
                   When this option is zero, the appears below the previous entry. When this option is one,  the
                   menu appears at the top of a new column in the menu.

           <b>-compound</b> =&gt; <u>value</u>
                   Specifies  whether  the  button  should  display both an image and text, and if so, where the
                   image should be placed relative to the text.   Valid  values  for  this  option  are  <b>bottom</b>,
                   <b>center</b>,  <b>left</b>,  <b>none</b>, <b>right</b> and <b>top</b>.  The default value is <b>none</b>, meaning that the button will
                   display either an image or text, depending on the values of the -image and -bitmap options.

           <b>-command</b> =&gt; <u>value</u>
                   For command, checkbutton, and radiobutton entries, specifies a callback to execute  when  the
                   menu  entry  is invoked.  For cascade entries, specifies a callback to execute when the entry
                   is activated (i.e. just before its submenu is posted).  Not available for separator or  tear-
                   off entries.

           <b>-font</b> =&gt; <u>value</u>
                   Specifies  the  font  to  use when drawing the label or accelerator string in this entry.  If
                   this option is specified as an empty string (the  default)  then  the  <b>font</b>  option  for  the
                   overall menu is used.  This option is not available for separator or tear-off entries.

           <b>-foreground</b> =&gt; <u>value</u>
                   Specifies  a foreground color to use for displaying this entry when it is in the normal state
                   (neither active nor disabled).  If this option is specified as an empty string (the default),
                   then the <b>foreground</b> option for the overall menu is used.  This option is  not  available  for
                   separator or tear-off entries.

           <b>-hidemargin</b> =&gt; <u>value</u>
                   Specifies  whether  the  standard margins should be drawn for this menu entry. This is useful
                   when creating palette with images in them, i.e., color palettes,  pattern  palettes,  etc.  1
                   indicates that the margin for the entry is hidden; 0 means that the margin is used.

           <b>-image</b> =&gt; <u>value</u>
                   Specifies  an  image to display in the menu instead of a text string or bitmap The image must
                   have been created by some previous invocation of <b>image</b> <b>create</b>.   This  option  overrides  the
                   <b>-label</b>  and <b>-bitmap</b> options but may be reset to an empty string to enable a textual or bitmap
                   label to be displayed.  This option is not available for separator or tear-off entries.

           <b>-indicatoron</b> =&gt; <u>value</u>
                   Available only for checkbutton and radiobutton entries.  <u>Value</u> is a boolean  that  determines
                   whether or not the indicator should be displayed.

           <b>-label</b> =&gt; <u>value</u>
                   Specifies  a  string to display as an identifying label in the menu entry.  Not available for
                   separator or tear-off entries.

           <b>-menu</b> =&gt; <u>value</u>
                   Available only for cascade entries.  Specifies the path name of the submenu  associated  with
                   this entry.  The submenu must be a child of the menu.

           <b>-offvalue</b> =&gt; <u>value</u>
                   Available  only  for  checkbutton  entries.   Specifies  the  value  to  store in the entry's
                   associated variable when the entry is deselected.

           <b>-onvalue</b> =&gt; <u>value</u>
                   Available only for checkbutton  entries.   Specifies  the  value  to  store  in  the  entry's
                   associated variable when the entry is selected.

           <b>-selectcolor</b> =&gt; <u>value</u>
                   Available  only  for  checkbutton and radiobutton entries.  Specifies the color to display in
                   the indicator when the entry is selected.  If the value is an empty string (the default) then
                   the <b>selectColor</b> option for the menu determines the indicator color.

           <b>-selectimage</b> =&gt; <u>value</u>
                   Available only for checkbutton and radiobutton entries.  Specifies an image to display in the
                   entry (in place of the <b>-image</b> option) when it is selected.  <u>Value</u> is the name  of  an  image,
                   which  must  have  been  created by some previous invocation of <b>image</b> <b>create</b>.  This option is
                   ignored unless the <b>-image</b> option has been specified.

           <b>-state</b> =&gt; <u>value</u>
                   Specifies one of three states for the entry:  <b>normal</b>, <b>active</b>, or <b>disabled</b>.  In  normal  state
                   the  entry  is  displayed  using the <b>foreground</b> option for the menu and the <b>background</b> option
                   from the entry or the menu.  The active state is typically used when the pointer is over  the
                   entry.  In active state the entry is displayed using the <b>activeForeground</b> option for the menu
                   along  with  the <b>activebackground</b> option from the entry.  Disabled state means that the entry
                   should be insensitive:  the default bindings will refuse to activate or invoke the entry.  In
                   this state the entry is displayed according to the <b>disabledForeground</b> option for the menu and
                   the <b>background</b> option from the entry.  This option is not available for separator entries.

           <b>-underline</b> =&gt; <u>value</u>
                   Specifies the integer index of a character to underline in the entry.  This  option  is  also
                   queried  by  the default bindings and used to implement keyboard traversal.  0 corresponds to
                   the first character of the text displayed in the entry, 1 to the next character, and  so  on.
                   If  a  bitmap or image is displayed in the entry then this option is ignored.  This option is
                   not available for separator or tear-off entries.

           <b>-value</b> =&gt; <u>value</u>
                   Available only for radiobutton  entries.   Specifies  the  value  to  store  in  the  entry's
                   associated  variable  when  the entry is selected.  If an empty string is specified, then the
                   <b>-label</b> option for the entry as the value to store in the variable.

           <b>-variable</b> =&gt; <u>value</u>
                   Available only for checkbutton and radiobutton entries.  Specifies the name of a global value
                   to set when the entry is selected.  For checkbutton entries the variable is also set when the
                   entry is deselected.  For radiobutton entries, changing the variable  causes  the  currently-
                   selected entry to deselect itself.

           The <b>add</b> method returns an empty string.

       <u>$menu</u>-&gt;<b>clone</b>(<u>$parent</u> ?, <u>cloneType?</u>)
           Makes  a  clone of the current menu as a child of <u>$parent</u>. This clone is a menu in its own right, but
           any changes to the clone are propogated to the original menu and vice versa. <u>cloneType</u> can be <b>normal</b>,
           <b>menubar</b>, or <b>tearoff</b>. Should not normally be called outside of the Tk library. See "CLONES"  for  more
           information.

       <u>$menu</u>-&gt;<b>delete</b>(<u>index1</u>?, <u>index2</u>?)
           Delete  all  of  the  menu entries between <u>index1</u> and <u>index2</u> inclusive.  If <u>index2</u> is omitted then it
           defaults to <u>index1</u>.  Attempts to delete a tear-off menu entry are ignored (instead, you should change
           the <b>tearOff</b> option to remove the tear-off entry).

       <u>$menu</u>-&gt;<b>entrycget</b>(<u>index,</u> <u>option</u>)
           Returns the current value of a configuration option for the entry given by <u>index</u>.   <u>Option</u>  may  have
           any of the values accepted by the <b>add</b> method.

       <u>$menu</u>-&gt;<b>entryconfigure</b>(<u>index</u> ?,<u>options</u>?)
           This  method  is  similar  to  the  <b>configure</b>  method,  except  that it applies to the options for an
           individual entry, whereas <b>configure</b> applies to the options for the menu as a whole.  <u>Options</u> may have
           any of the values accepted by the <b>add</b> method.  If <u>options</u> are  specified,  options  are  modified  as
           indicated  in  the  method call and the method returns an empty string.  If no <u>options</u> are specified,
           returns a list describing the current options for entry <u>index</u> (see Tk::options for information on the
           format of this list).

       <u>$menu</u>-&gt;<b>index</b>(<u>index</u>)
           Returns the numerical index corresponding to <u>index</u>, or <b>none</b> if <u>index</u> was specified as <b>none</b>.

       <u>$menu</u>-&gt;<b>insert</b>(<u>index,</u> <u>type</u>?, <u>-option</u>=&gt;<u>value</u>, ...?)
           Same as the <b>add</b> method except that it inserts the new entry just before the  entry  given  by  <u>index</u>,
           instead  of  appending  to the end of the menu.  The <u>type</u>, <u>-option</u>, and <u>value</u> arguments have the same
           interpretation as for the <b>add</b> widget method.  It is not possible to insert new  menu  entries  before
           the tear-off entry, if the menu has one.

       <u>$menu</u>-&gt;<b>invoke</b>(<u>index</u>)
           Invoke the action of the menu entry.  See the sections on the individual entries above for details on
           what  happens.   If  the  menu  entry  is disabled then nothing happens.  If the entry has a callback
           associated with it then the result of that callback is returned as the result of  the  <b>invoke</b>  widget
           method.   Otherwise  the  result  is  an  empty  string.   Note:   invoking  a  menu  entry  does not
           automatically unpost the menu;  the default bindings normally take care of this before  invoking  the
           <b>invoke</b> method.

       <u>$menu</u>-&gt;<b>post</b>(<u>x,</u> <u>y</u>)
           Arrange  for  the menu to be displayed on the screen at the root-window coordinates given by <u>x</u> and <u>y</u>.
           These coordinates are adjusted if necessary to guarantee that the  entire  menu  is  visible  on  the
           screen.  This method normally returns an empty string.  If the <b>postCommand</b> option has been specified,
           then its value is executed before posting the menu and the result of that callback is returned as the
           result  of the <b>post</b> widget method.  If an error returns while executing the method, then the error is
           returned without posting the menu.

       <u>$menu</u>-&gt;<b>postcascade</b>(<u>index</u>)
           Posts the submenu associated with the cascade entry given by <u>index</u>, and unposts any previously posted
           submenu.  If <u>index</u> doesn't correspond to a cascade entry, or if <u>$menu</u> isn't posted, the method has no
           effect except to unpost any currently posted submenu.

       <u>$menu</u>-&gt;<b>type</b>(<u>index</u>)
           Returns the type of the menu entry given by <u>index</u>.  This is the  <u>type</u>  argument  passed  to  the  <b>add</b>
           widget  method  when  the  entry was created, such as <b>command</b> or <b>separator</b>, or <b>tearoff</b> for a tear-off
           entry.

       <u>$menu</u>-&gt;<b>unpost</b>
           Unmap the window so that it is no longer displayed.  If a lower-level cascaded menu is posted, unpost
           that menu.  Returns an empty string. This method does not work on Windows and the Macintosh, as those
           platforms have their own way of unposting menus.

       <u>$menu</u>-&gt;<b>yposition</b>(<u>index</u>)
           Returns a decimal string giving the y-coordinate within the menu window of the topmost pixel  in  the
           entry specified by <u>index</u>.

</pre><h4><b>MENU</b> <b>CONFIGURATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The default bindings support four different ways of using menus:

       <b>Pulldown</b> <b>Menus</b> <b>in</b> <b>Menubar</b>
           This  is  the most command case. You create a menu widget that will become the menu bar. You then add
           cascade entries to this menu, specifying the pull down menus you wish to use in your  menu  bar.  You
           then create all of the pulldowns. Once you have done this, specify the menu using the <b>-menu</b> option of
           the toplevel's method. See the <b>toplevel</b> manual entry for details.

       <b>Pulldown</b> <b>Menus</b> <b>in</b> <b>Menu</b> <b>Buttons</b>
           This  is  the  compatible  way  to do menu bars.  You create one menubutton widget for each top-level
           menu, and typically you arrange a series of menubuttons in a row  in  a  menubar  window.   You  also
           create  the  top-level  menus  and any cascaded submenus, and tie them together with <b>-menu</b> options in
           menubuttons and cascade menu entries.  The top-level menu must be a child of the menubutton, and each
           submenu must be a child of the menu that refers to it.  Once you have done this, the default bindings
           will allow users to traverse and invoke the tree of menus via its  menubutton;   see  the  <b>menubutton</b>
           documentation for details.

       <b>Popup</b> <b>Menus</b>
           Popup  menus  typically  post in response to a mouse button press or keystroke.  You create the popup
           menus and any cascaded submenus, then you call the <b>Post</b> method at the appropriate time  to  post  the
           top-level menu.

           <u>$menu</u>-&gt;<b>Post</b>(<u>$x</u>,<u>$y</u>?,<u>$entry</u>?)

           <u>$x</u>  and  <u>$y</u>  are  the  root  window  coordinates  at  which the <u>$menu</u> will be displayed. If <u>$entry</u> is
           specified then that entry is centred on that point, otherwise the top-left corner  of  the  <u>$menu</u>  is
           placed at that point.

           <b>Menu</b>  also inherits methods from Tk::Wm and so the method <b>Popup</b> can be used to position menu relative
           to other windows, the mouse cursor or the screen.

       <b>Option</b> <b>Menus</b>
           An option menu consists of a menubutton with an associated menu that allows  you  to  select  one  of
           several  values.   The  current  value  is displayed in the menubutton and is also stored in a global
           variable.  Use the Tk::Optionmenu class to create option menubuttons and their menus.

       <b>Torn-off</b> <b>Menus</b>
           You create a torn-off menu by invoking the tear-off entry at  the  top  of  an  existing  menu.   The
           default  bindings will create a new menu that is a copy of the original menu and leave it permanently
           posted as a top-level window.  The torn-off menu behaves just the same as the original menu.

</pre><h4><b>DEFAULT</b> <b>BINDINGS</b></h4><pre>
       Tk automatically creates class bindings for menus that give them the following default behavior:

       [1] When the mouse enters a menu, the entry underneath the mouse cursor activates;  as  the  mouse  moves
           around the menu, the active entry changes to track the mouse.

       [2] When  the  mouse  leaves a menu all of the entries in the menu deactivate, except in the special case
           where the mouse moves from a menu to a cascaded submenu.

       [3] When a button is released over a menu, the active entry (if any) is invoked.  The menu  also  unposts
           unless it is a torn-off menu.

       [4] The Space and Return keys invoke the active entry and unpost the menu.

       [5] If  any  of  the entries in a menu have letters underlined with with <b>-underline</b> option, then pressing
           one of the underlined letters (or its upper-case or lower-case equivalent)  invokes  that  entry  and
           unposts the menu.

       [6] The  Escape  key aborts a menu selection in progress without invoking any entry.  It also unposts the
           menu unless it is a torn-off menu.

       [7] The Up and Down keys activate the next higher or lower entry in the menu.  When one end of  the  menu
           is reached, the active entry wraps around to the other end.

       [8] The Left key moves to the next menu to the left.  If the current menu is a cascaded submenu, then the
           submenu  is  unposted  and  the  current  menu entry becomes the cascade entry in the parent.  If the
           current menu is a top-level menu posted from a menubutton, then the current  menubutton  is  unposted
           and  the  next  menubutton  to  the left is posted.  Otherwise the key has no effect.  The left-right
           order of menubuttons is determined by their stacking order:  Tk assumes that  the  lowest  menubutton
           (which by default is the first one created) is on the left.

       [9] The Right key moves to the next menu to the right.  If the current entry is a cascade entry, then the
           submenu  is posted and the  current menu entry becomes the first entry in the submenu.  Otherwise, if
           the current menu was posted from a menubutton, then the current menubutton is unposted and  the  next
           menubutton to the right is posted.

           Disabled  menu  entries are non-responsive:  they don't activate and they ignore mouse button presses
           and releases.

           The behavior of menus can be changed by defining new bindings for individual widgets or by redefining
           the class bindings.

       At present it isn't possible to use the option database to specify values for the options  to  individual
       entries.
