</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module provides the tools you need to add support for U2F in your application.

       It's expected that you know the basics of U2F. More information about this can be found at Yubico
       &lt;https://www.yubico.com/about/background/fido/&gt; and FIDO
       &lt;https://fidoalliance.org/specifications/overview/&gt;.

       This module does not handle the wire encoding of U2F challenges and response, as these are different
       depending on the U2F host you're using and the style of your application. In the "examples" dir there are
       scripts that implement the 1.0 wire format, used by Yubico's libu2f-host
       &lt;https://developers.yubico.com/libu2f-host/&gt;, and a Plack application that works with Google's JavaScript
       module &lt;https://github.com/google/u2f-ref-code/blob/master/u2f-gae-demo/war/js/u2f-api.js&gt;.

       Sadly, the documentation around U2F is rather more confusing than it should be, and this short
       description is probably not making things better. Please improve this or write something about U2F so we
       can improve application security everywhere.

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       There are three functions: One for generating challenges for the host to sign, and one for processing the
       responses from the two types of signing requests U2F supports.

       There's straight function interface and a class method interface. Both do exactly the same thing; which
       you use depends onhow much verbosity you like vs how much namespace clutter you like. Only the functional
       interface is mentioned in this section; see the SYNOPSIS for the details.

   <b>u2f_challenge</b>
           my $challenge = u2f_challenge;

       Creates a challenge. A challenge is 256 cryptographically-secure random bits.

   <b>u2f_registration_verify</b>
       Verify a registration response from the host against the challenge. If the verification is successful,
       returns the key handle and public key of the device that signed the challenge. If it fails, this function
       croaks with an error.

       Takes the following options, all required:

       challenge
           The challenge originally given to the host.

       app_id
           The application ID.

       origin
           The browser location origin. This is typically the same as the application ID.

       registration_data
           The registration data blob from the host.

       client_data
           The client data blob from the host.

   <b>u2f_signature_verify</b>
       Verify  a signature (authentication) response from the host against the challenge. If the verification is
       successful, the user has presented a valid device and is now authenticated. If  the  verification  fails,
       this function croaks with an error.

       Takes the following options, all required.

       challenge
           The challenge originally given to the host.

       app_id
           The application ID.

       origin
           The browser location origin. This is typically the same as the application ID.

       key_handle
           The handle of the key that was used to sign the challenge.

       key The stored public key associated with the handle.

       signature_data
           The signature data blob from the host.

       client_data
           The client data blob from the host.
