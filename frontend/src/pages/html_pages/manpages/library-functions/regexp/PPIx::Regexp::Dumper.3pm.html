       PPIx::Regexp::Dumper - Dump the results of parsing regular expressions

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        use PPIx::Regexp::Dumper;
        PPIx::Regexp::Dumper-&gt;new( 'qr{foo}smx' )
            -&gt;print();

</pre><h4><b>INHERITANCE</b></h4><pre>
       "PPIx::Regexp::Dumper" is a PPIx::Regexp::Support.

       "PPIx::Regexp::Dumper" has no descendants.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This class generates a formatted dump of a PPIx::Regexp::Element object (or any subclass thereof), a
       PPIx::Regexp::Tokenizer object, or a string that can be made into one of these.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       This class provides the following public methods. Methods not documented here are private, and
       unsupported in the sense that the author reserves the right to change or remove them without notice.

   <b>new</b>
        my $dumper = PPIx::Regexp::Dumper-&gt;new(
            '/foo/', ordinal =&gt; 1,
        );

       This static method instantiates the dumper. It takes the string, PPI::Element, PPIx::Regexp::Element, or
       PPIx::Regexp::Tokenizer to be dumped as the first argument.  Optional further arguments may be passed as
       name/value pairs.

       The following options are recognized:

       default_modifiers array_reference
           This  argument  is  a  reference  to a list of default modifiers to be applied to the statement being
           parsed. See PPIx::Regexp <b>new()</b> for the details.

       encoding name
           This argument is the name of the encoding of the regular  expression.  If  specified,  it  is  passed
           through  to  PPIx::Regexp-&gt;<b>new()</b>.  It also causes an "Encode::encode" to be done on any parse content
           dumped.

       explain Boolean
           If true, this option causes the "explain()" output of each object to be dumped.

       indent number
           This argument is the number of additional spaces to indent each level of the parse hierarchy. This is
           ignored if either the "test" or "tokens" argument is true.

           The default is 2.

       margin number
           This is the number of spaces to indent the top level of the parse hierarchy. This is ignored  if  the
           "test" argument is true.

           The default is zero.

       ordinal Boolean
           If  true,  this  option  causes  the  "ordinal"  values of PPIx::Regexp::Token::Literal objects to be
           dumped.

       perl_version Boolean
           If  true,  this  option  causes  the  "perl_version_introduced"  and  "perl_version_removed"   values
           associated with each object dumped to be displayed.

       ppi Boolean
           If true, any Perl code contained in the object will be dumped.

       short Boolean
           If true, leading 'PPIx::Regexp::' will be removed from the class names in the output.

       strict Boolean
           This  option  is  passed on to the parser, where it specifies whether the parse should assume "use re
           'strict'" is in effect.

           The 'strict' pragma was introduced in Perl 5.22, and its documentation says that it is  experimental,
           and  that  there  is  no commitment to backward compatibility. The same applies to the parse produced
           when this option is asserted.

           The default is false.

       significant Boolean
           If true, this option causes only significant elements to be dumped.

           The default is false.

       test Boolean
           If true, this option causes the output to be formatted as a regression test rather than as a straight
           dump. The output produced by asserting this option is explicitly undocumented, in the sense that  the
           author reserves the right to change the generated output without notice of any kind.

           The default is false.

       tokens Boolean
           If  true,  this  option  causes a dump of tokenizer output rather than of a full parse of the regular
           expression. This is forced true if the dump is of a PPIx::Regexp::Tokenizer.

           The default is false.

       trace number
           If greater than zero, this option causes a trace of the parse. This  option  is  unsupported  in  the
           sense that the author reserves the right to change it without notice.

           The default is zero.

       verbose number
           If greater than zero, this option causes additional information to be given about the elements found.
           This  option  is  unsupported  in  the  sense that the author reserves the right to change it without
           notice.

           The default is zero.

       width Boolean
           If true, this option causes a dump of the width of the object.

       If   the   thing   to   be   dumped   was   a   string,   unrecognized   arguments    are    passed    to
       "PPIx::Regexp::Tokenizer-&gt;new()". Otherwise they are ignored.

   <b>list</b>
        print map { "$_\n" } $dumper-&gt;list();

       This  method  produces  an array containing the dump output, one line per element. The output has no left
       margin applied, and no newlines.

   <b>print</b>
        $dumper-&gt;print();

       This method simply prints the result of "string" to standard out.

   <b>string</b>
        print $dumper-&gt;string();

       This method adds left margin and newlines to the output of "list", concatenates the result into a  single
       string, and returns that string.
