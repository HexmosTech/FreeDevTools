</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       JE::Object::RegExp - JavaScript regular expression (RegExp object) class

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use JE;
         use JE::Object::RegExp;

         $j = new JE;

         $js_regexp = new JE::Object::RegExp $j, "(.*)", 'ims';

         $perl_qr = $js_regexp-&gt;value;

         $some_string =~ $js_regexp; # You can use it as a qr//

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This class implements JavaScript regular expressions for JE.

       See JE::Types for a description of most of the interface. Only what is specific to JE::Object::RegExp is
       explained here.

       A RegExp object will stringify the same way as a "qr//", so that you can use "=~" on it. This is
       different from the return value of the "to_string" method (the way it stringifies in JS).

       Since JE's regular expressions use Perl's engine underneath, the features that Perl provides that are not
       part of the ECMAScript spec are supported, except for "(?s)" and "(?m)", which don't do anything, and
       "(?|...)", which is unpredictable.

       In versions prior to 0.042, a hyphen adjacent to "\d", "\s" or "\w" in a character class would be
       unpredictable (sometimes a syntax error). Now it is interpreted literally. This matches what most
       implementations do, which happens to be the same as Perl's behaviour. (It is a syntax error in
       ECMAScript.)

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       value
           Returns a Perl "qr//" regular expression.

           If  the regular expression or the string that is being matched against it contains characters outside
           the Basic Multilingual Plane (whose character codes exceed 0xffff), the  behavior  is  undefined--for
           now at least. I still need to solve the problem caused by JS's unintuitive use of raw surrogates. (In
           JS,  "<a href="file:/../">/../</a>"  will match a surrogate pair, which is considered to be one character in Perl. This means
           that the same regexp matched against the same string will produce different results in Perl and JS.)

       class
           Returns the string 'RegExp'.
