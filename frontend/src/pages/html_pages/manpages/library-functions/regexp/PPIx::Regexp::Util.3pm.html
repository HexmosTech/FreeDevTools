</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       PPIx::Regexp::Util - Utility functions for PPIx::Regexp;

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        use PPIx::Regexp::Util qw{ __instance };
            .
            .
            .
        __instance( $foo, 'Bar' )
            or die '$foo is not a Bar';

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module contains utility functions for PPIx::Regexp which it is convenient to centralize.

       Double-underscore subroutines are <b>private</b> to the "PPIx-Regexp" package. Their documentation is provided
       for the author's convenience only, and they are subject to change without notice. <u>Caveat</u> <u>user.</u>

       This module exports nothing by default.

</pre><h4><b>SUBROUTINES</b></h4><pre>
       This module can export the following subroutines:

   <b>is_ppi_regexp_element</b>
        is_ppi_regexp_element( $elem )
          and print "$elem is a regexp of some sort\n";

       This subroutine is public and supported.

       This subroutine takes as its argument a PPI::Element. It returns a true value if the argument represents
       a regular expression of some sort, and a false value otherwise.

   <b>__instance</b>
        __instance( $foo, 'Bar' )
            and print '$foo isa Bar', "\n";

       This subroutine is <b>private</b> to the "PPIx-Regexp" package.

       This subroutine returns true if its first argument is an instance of the class specified by its second
       argument. Unlike "UNIVERSAL::isa", the result is always false unless the first argument is a reference.

   <b>__is_ppi_regexp_element</b>
        __is_ppi_regexp_element( $elem )
          and print "$elem is a regexp of some sort\n";

       This subroutine is <b>private</b> to the "PPIx-Regexp" package.

       This is a synonym for <b>is_ppi_regexp_element()</b>, and is deprecated in favor of it. If called, it will
       complain via "Carp::cluck()" and then "goto &amp;is_ppi_regexp_element".

   <b>__merge_perl_requirements</b>
       This subroutine is <b>private</b> to the "PPIx-Regexp" package.

       This subroutine merges perl requirements as returned by the various "__perl_requirements()" methods.

   <b>__ns_can</b>
       This subroutine is <b>private</b> to the "PPIx-Regexp" package.

       This method is analogous to "can()", but returns a reference to the code only if it is actually
       implemented by the invoking name space.

   <b>__post_rebless_error</b>
       This method is <b>private</b> to the "PPIx-Regexp" package. The intended use is to alias it to
       "__PPIX_ELEM__post_reblessing()".

       It takes arguments as name/value pairs. Argument "{error}" is the error message; if it is omitted you get
       a warning with stack trace. Argument "{explanation}" defaults to "{error}".

       It returns the number of errors to add to the parse.

   <b>raw_width</b>
       This public method returns the minimum and maximum width matched by the element before taking into
       account such details as what the element actually is and how it is quantified.

       This implementation is appropriate to things that match exactly one character -- i.e. it returns "( 1, 1
       )".

   <b>__to_ordinal_en</b>
       This subroutine is <b>private</b> to the "PPIx-Regexp" package.

       This subroutine takes as its argument an integer and returns a string representing its ordinal in
       English. For example

        say __to_ordinal_en( 17 );
        # 17th

   <b>width</b>
        my ( $min_wid, $max_wid ) = $self-&gt;width();

       This public method (well, mixin) returns the minimum and maximum width of the text matched by the
       element.

       Elements which import this method must also implement a "raw_width()" method which returns the
       unquantified width of the element.

</pre><h4><b>EXPORT</b> <b>TAGS</b></h4><pre>
       The following export tags are defined by this module. All are private to the "PPIx-Regexp" package unless
       otherwise documented.

   <b>all</b>
       This tag exports everything exportable by this module.

   <b>width_one</b>
       This tag is appropriate to an element which, when unquantified, matches exactly one character. It exports
       "raw_width()" and "width()".

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       Params::Util, which I recommend, but in the case of "PPIx::Regexp" I did not want to introduce a
       dependency on an XS module when all I really wanted was the function of that module's "_INSTANCE()"
       subroutine.

</pre><h4><b>SUPPORT</b></h4><pre>
