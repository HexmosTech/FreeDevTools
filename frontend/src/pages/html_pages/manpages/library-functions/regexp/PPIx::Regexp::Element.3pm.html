</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       PPIx::Regexp::Element - Base of the PPIx::Regexp hierarchy.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       No user-serviceable parts inside.

</pre><h4><b>INHERITANCE</b></h4><pre>
       "PPIx::Regexp::Element" is not descended from any other class.

       "PPIx::Regexp::Element" is the parent of PPIx::Regexp::Node and PPIx::Regexp::Token.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This class is the base of the PPIx::Regexp object hierarchy. It provides the same kind of navigational
       functionality that is provided by PPI::Element.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       This class provides the following public methods. Methods not documented here are private, and
       unsupported in the sense that the author reserves the right to change or remove them without notice.

   <b>accepts_perl</b>
        $token-&gt;accepts_perl( '5.020' )
            and say 'This works under Perl 5.20';

       This method returns a true value if the token is acceptable under the specified version of Perl, and a
       false value otherwise. Unless the token (or its contents) have been equivocated on, the result is simply
       what you would expect based on testing the results of <b>perl_version_introduced()</b> and
       <b>perl_version_removed()</b> versus the given Perl version number.

       This method was added in version 0.051_01.

   <b>ancestor_of</b>
       This method returns true if the object is an ancestor of the argument, and false otherwise. By the
       definition of this method, $self is its own ancestor.

   <b>can_be_quantified</b>
        $token-&gt;can_be_quantified()
            and print "This element can be quantified.\n";

       This method returns true if the element can be quantified.

   <b>class</b>
       This method returns the class name of the element. It is the same as "ref $self".

   <b>column_number</b>
       This method returns the column number of the first character in the element, or "undef" if that can not
       be determined.

   <b>comment</b>
       This method returns true if the element is a comment and false otherwise.

   <b>content</b>
       This method returns the content of the element.

   <b>descendant_of</b>
       This method returns true if the object is a descendant of the argument, and false otherwise. By the
       definition of this method, $self is its own descendant.

   <b>explain</b>
       This method returns a brief explanation of what the element does. The return will be either a string or
       "undef" in scalar context, but may be multiple values or an empty array in list context.

       This method should be considered experimental. What it returns may change without notice as my
       understanding of what all the pieces/parts of a Perl regular expression evolves. The worst case is that
       it will prove entirely infeasible to implement satisfactorily, in which case it will be put through a
       deprecation cycle and retracted.

   <b>error</b>
        say $token-&gt;error();

       If an element is one of the classes that represents a parse error, this method <b>may</b> return a brief message
       saying why. Otherwise it will return "undef".

   <b>is_matcher</b>
       This method reports on whether the element potentially matches something. Possible returns are a true
       value if it does, a false (but defined) value if it does not, or "undef" if this can not be determined.

       The idea is to classify elements based on whether they potentially match something in the target string.

       This method is overridden to return "undef" in PPIx::Regexp::Token::Code,
       PPIx::Regexp::Token::Interpolation, and PPIx::Regexp::Token::Unknown.

       This method is overridden to return a true value in PPIx::Regexp::Token::Assertion,
       PPIx::Regexp::Token::CharClass, PPIx::Regexp::Token::Literal, and PPIx::Regexp::Token::Reference.

       For PPIx::Regexp::Node, this method is overridden to return a value computed from the node's children.

       For anything else this method returns a false (but defined) value.

   <b>in_regex_set</b>
       This method returns a true value if the invocant is contained in an extended bracketed character class
       (also known as a regex set), and a false value otherwise. This method returns true if the invocant is a
       PPIx::Regexp::Structure::RegexSet.

   <b>is_quantifier</b>
        $token-&gt;is_quantifier()
            and print "This element is a quantifier.\n";

       This method returns true if the element is a quantifier. You can not tell this from the element's class,
       because a right curly bracket may represent a quantifier for the purposes of figuring out whether a
       greediness token is possible.

   <b>line_number</b>
       This method returns the line number of the first character in the element, or "undef" if that can not be
       determined.

   <b>location</b>
       This method returns a reference to an array describing the position of the element in the regular
       expression, or "undef" if locations were not indexed.

       The array is compatible with the corresponding PPI::Element method.

   <b>logical_filename</b>
       This method returns the logical file name (taking "#line" directives into account) of the file containing
       first character in the element, or "undef" if that can not be determined.

   <b>logical_line_number</b>
       This method returns the logical line number (taking "#line" directives into account) of the first
       character in the element, or "undef" if that can not be determined.

   <b>main_structure</b>
       This method returns the PPIx::Regexp::Structure::Main that contains the element. In practice this will be
       a PPIx::Regexp::Structure::Regexp or a PPIx::Regexp::Structure::Replacement,

       If the element is not contained in any such structure, "undef" is returned. This will happen if the
       element is a PPIx::Regexp or one of its immediate children.

   <b>modifier_asserted</b>
        $token-&gt;modifier_asserted( 'i' )
            and print "Matched without regard to case.\n";

       This method returns true if the given modifier is in effect for the element, and false otherwise.

       What it does is to walk backwards from the element until it finds a modifier object that specifies the
       modifier, whether asserted or negated. and returns the specified value. If nobody specifies the modifier,
       it returns "undef".

       This method will not work reliably if called on tokenizer output.

   <b>next_element</b>
       This method returns the next element, or nothing if there is none.

       Unlike <b>next_sibling()</b>, this will cross from the content of a structure into the elements that define the
       structure, or vice versa.

   <b>next_sibling</b>
       This method returns the element's next sibling, or nothing if there is none.

   <b>next_token</b>
       This method returns the next token, or nothing if there is none.

       Unlike <b>next_element()</b>, this will walk the parse tree.

   <b>parent</b>
       This method returns the parent of the element, or undef if there is none.

   <b>perl_version_introduced</b>
       This method returns the version of Perl in which the element was introduced. This will be at least 5.000.
       Before 5.006 I am relying on the <u>perldelta</u>, <u>perlre</u>, and <u>perlop</u> documentation, since I have been unable to
       build earlier Perls. Since I have found no documentation before 5.003, I assume that anything found in
       5.003 is also in 5.000.

       Since this all depends on my ability to read and understand masses of documentation, the results of this
       method should be viewed with caution, if not downright skepticism.

       There are also cases which are ambiguous in various ways. For those see the PPIx::Regexp documentation,
       particularly Changes in Syntax.

       Very occasionally, a construct will be removed and then added back. If this happens, this method will
       return the <b>lowest</b> version in which the construct appeared. For the known instances of this, see the
       PPIx::Regexp documentation, particularly Equivocation.

   <b>perl_version_removed</b>
       This method returns the version of Perl in which the element was removed. If the element is still valid
       the return is "undef".

       All the <u>caveats</u> to <b>perl_version_introduced()</b> apply here also, though perhaps less severely since although
       many features have been introduced since 5.0, few have been removed.

       Very occasionally, a construct will be removed and then added back. If this happens, this method will
       return the "undef" if the construct is present in the highest-numbered version of Perl (whether
       production or development), or the version after the highest-numbered version in which it appeared
       otherwise. For the known instances of this, see the PPIx::Regexp documentation, particularly
       Equivocation.

   <b>previous_element</b>
       This method returns the previous element, or nothing if there is none.

       Unlike <b>previous_sibling()</b>, this will cross from the content of a structure into the elements that define
       the structure, or vice versa.

   <b>previous_sibling</b>
       This method returns the element's previous sibling, or nothing if there is none.

       This method is analogous to the same-named PPI::Element method, in that it will not cross from the
       content of a structure into the elements that define the structure.

   <b>previous_token</b>
       This method returns the previous token, or nothing if there is none.

       Unlike <b>previous_element()</b>, this will walk the parse tree.

   <b>raw_width</b>
        my ( $raw_min, $raw_max ) = $self-&gt;raw_width();

       This public method returns the minimum and maximum width matched by the element before taking into
       account such details as what the element actually is and how it is quantified. Either or both elements
       can be "undef" if the width can not be determined, and the maximum can be "Inf".

       This method was added in version 0.085_01.

   <b>remove_insignificant</b>
       This method returns a new object manufactured from the invocant, but containing only elements for which
       "$elem-&gt;significant()" returns a true value.

       If you call this method on a PPIx::Regexp::Node you will get back a deep clone, but without the
       insignificant elements.

       If you call this method on any other PPIx::Regexp class you will get back either the invocant or nothing.
       This may change to a clone of the invocant or nothing if unforeseen problems arise with returning the
       invocant, or if objects become mutable (unlikely, but not impossible.)

   <b>requirements_for_perl</b>
        say $token-&gt;requirements_for_perl();

       This method returns a string representing the Perl requirements for a given module. This should only be
       used for informational purposes, as the format of the string may be subject to change.

       At the moment, the returns may be:

        version &lt;= $]
        version &lt;= $] &lt; version
        two or more of the above joined by '||'
        ! $]

       The last means that, although all the components of the regular expression can be compiled by <b>some</b>
       version of Perl, there is no version that will compile all of them.

       I reiterate: the returned string may be subject to change, maybe without warning.

       This method was added in version 0.051_01.

   <b>scontent</b>
       This method returns the significant content of the element. That is, if called on the parse of '/ f u b a
       r /x', it returns '/fubar/x'. If the invocant contains no insignificant elements, it is the same as
       <b>content()</b>. If called on an insignificant element, it returns nothing -- that is, "undef" in scalar
       context, and an empty list in list context.

       This method was inspired by jb's question on Perl Monks about stripping comments and white space from a
       regular expression: &lt;https://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=1207556&gt;

       This method was added in version 0.053_01

   <b>significant</b>
       This method returns true if the element is significant and false otherwise.

   <b>snext_element</b>
       This method returns the next significant element, or nothing if there is none.

       Unlike <b>snext_sibling()</b>, this will cross from the content of a structure into the elements that define the
       structure, or vice versa.

   <b>snext_sibling</b>
       This method returns the element's next significant sibling, or nothing if there is none.

       This method is analogous to the same-named PPI::Element method, in that it will not cross from the
       content of a structure into the elements that define the structure.

   <b>sprevious_element</b>
       This method returns the previous significant element, or nothing if there is none.

       Unlike <b>sprevious_sibling()</b>, this will cross from the content of a structure into the elements that define
       the structure, or vice versa.

   <b>sprevious_sibling</b>
       This method returns the element's previous significant sibling, or nothing if there is none.

       This method is analogous to the same-named PPI::Element method, in that it will not cross from the
       content of a structure into the elements that define the structure.

   <b>statement</b>
       This method returns the PPI::Statement that contains this element, or nothing if the statement can not be
       determined.

       In general this method will return something only under the following conditions:

       •   The element is contained in a PPIx::Regexp object;

       •   That object was initialized from a PPI::Element;

       •   The PPI::Element is contained in a statement.

   <b>tokens</b>
       This method returns all tokens contained in the element.

   <b>top</b>
       This method returns the top of the hierarchy.

   <b>unescaped_content</b>
       This method returns the content of the element, unescaped.

   <b>visual_column_number</b>
       This  method  returns  the  visual column number (taking tabs into account) of the first character in the
       element, or "undef" if that can not be determined.

   <b>whitespace</b>
       This method returns true if the element is whitespace and false otherwise.

   <b>width</b>
        my ( $min, $max ) = $self-&gt;width();

       This method returns the minimum and maximum number of characters this element can match.

       Either element can be "undef" if it cannot be determined. For example, for "/$foo/" both elements will be
       "undef".  Recursions will return "undef" because they can not be analyzed statically -- or at least I  am
       not  smart  enough  to  do  so.  Back  references  <b>may</b> return "undef" if the referred-to group can not be
       uniquely determined.

       It is possible for $max to be "Inf". For example, for "/x*/" $max will be "Inf".

       Elements that do not actually match anything will return zeroes.

       <b>Note:</b> This method was added because I wanted better detection of variable-length  look-behinds.  Both  it
       and <b>raw_width()</b> (above) should be considered somewhat experimental.

       This method was added in version 0.085_01.

   <b>nav</b>
       This  method  returns  navigation information from the top of the hierarchy to this node. The return is a
       list of names of methods and references to their argument lists. The idea is that given  $elem  which  is
       somewhere under $top,

        my @nav = $elem-&gt;nav();
        my $obj = $top;
        while ( @nav ) {
            my $method = shift @nav;
            my $args = shift @nav;
            $obj = $obj-&gt;$method( @{ $args } ) or die;
        }
        # At this point, $obj should contain the same object
        # as $elem.
