</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       PPIx::Regexp::Constant - Constants for the PPIx::Regexp system

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        use PPIx::Regexp::Constant qw{ TOKEN_UNKNOWN }
        print "An unknown token's class is TOKEN_UNKNOWN\n";

</pre><h4><b>INHERITANCE</b></h4><pre>
       "PPIx::Regexp::Constant" is an Exporter.

       "PPIx::Regexp::Constant" has no descendants.

</pre><h4><b>DETAILS</b></h4><pre>
       This module defines manifest constants for use by the various "PPIx::Regexp" modules. These constants are
       to be considered <b>private</b> to the "PPIx::Regexp" system, and the author reserves the right to change them
       without notice.

       This module exports the following manifest constants:

   <b>@CARP_NOT</b>
       This global variable contains the names of all modules in the package.

   <b>ARRAY_REF</b>
       This is the result of "ref []".

   <b>CODE_REF</b>
       This is the result of "ref sub {}".

   <b>COOKIE_CLASS</b>
       The name of the cookie used to control the construction of character classes.

       This cookie is set in PPIx::Regexp::Token::Structure when the left square bracket is encountered, and
       cleared in the same module when a right square bracket is encountered.

   <b>COOKIE_LOOKAROUND_ASSERTION</b>
       The name of the cookie used to control the parsing of zero-width assertions.

       This cookie is set in PPIx::Regexp::Token::GroupType::Assertion, and it persists until the end of the
       assertion.

   <b>COOKIE_QUANT</b>
       The name of the cookie used to control the construction of curly bracketed quantifiers.

       This cookie is set in PPIx::Regexp::Token::Structure when a left curly bracket is encountered. It
       requests itself to be cleared on encountering anything other than a literal comma, a literal digit, or an
       interpolation, or if more than one comma is encountered. If it survives until
       PPIx::Regexp::Token::Structure processes the right curly bracket, it is cleared there.

   <b>COOKIE_QUOTE</b>
       The name of the cookie used to control the parsing of "\Q ... \E" quoted literals.

       This cookie is set in PPIx::Regexp::Token::Control when a "\Q" is encountered, and it persists until the
       next "\E".

   <b>COOKIE_REGEX_SET</b>
       The name of the cookie used to control regular expression sets.

   <b>FALSE</b>
       A false value. The author makes no commitment what the exact value is, only that Boolean operations will
       see it as false.

   <b>HASH_REF</b>
       This is the result of "ref {}".

   <b>INFINITY</b>
       This is the IEEE 754 value of "Inf" if that can be generated, or an opaque overloaded object if not.
       Because the object does not (and I think can not) implement the complete behavior of IEEE 754 "Inf", this
       manifest constant should only be used for stringification and numeric comparison. Be aware that the
       numification of the object has to be the same as its stringification to keep "looks_like_number()" happy.
       <b>Caveat</b> <b>coder</b>.

   <b>LITERAL_LEFT_CURLY_ALLOWED</b>
       The Perl version at which allowed unescaped literal left curly brackets were removed. This may make more
       sense if I mention that its value is "undef".

   <b>LITERAL_LEFT_CURLY_REMOVED_PHASE_1</b>
       The Perl version at which the first phase of unescaped literal left curly bracket removal took place. The
       value of this constant is '5.025001'.

   <b>LITERAL_LEFT_CURLY_REMOVED_PHASE_2</b>
       The Perl version at which the second phase of unescaped literal left curly bracket removal took place.
       The value of this constant is "undef", but it will be assigned a value when the timing of the second
       phase is known.

   <b>LITERAL_LEFT_CURLY_REMOVED_PHASE_3</b>
       The Perl version at which the third phase of unescaped literal left curly bracket removal took place.
       This is the removal of curly brackets after a left parenthesis. The value of this constant is "undef",
       but it will be assigned a value when the timing of the second phase is known.

   <b>MINIMUM_PERL</b>
       The minimum version of Perl understood by this parser, as a float. It is currently set to 5.000, since
       that is the minimum version of Perl accessible to the author.

   <b>MODIFIER_GROUP_MATCH_SEMANTICS</b>
       The name of the PPIx::Regexp::Token::Modifier group used to control match semantics.

   <b>MSG_LOOK_BEHIND_TOO_LONG</b>
       An appropriate error message for an unknown entity created from a quantifier which would make a look-
       behind assertion too long. This is cribbed verbatim from the Perl error message.

   <b>MSG_PROHIBITED_BY_STRICT</b>
       An appropriate error message for an unknown entity created because 'strict' was in effect. This is rank
       ad-hocery, and more than usually subject to being changed, without any notice whatsoever. Caveat user.

   <b>NODE_UNKNOWN</b>
       The name of the class that represents an unknown node. That is, PPIx::Regexp::Node::Unknown.

   <b>RE_CAPTURE_NAME</b>
       A string representation of a regular expression that matches the name of a named capture buffer.

   <b>REGEXP_REF</b>
       This is the result of "ref qr{}".

   <b>SCALAR_REF</b>
       This is the result of "ref \0".

   <b>STRUCTURE_UNKNOWN</b>
       The name of the class that represents an unknown structure. That is, PPIx::Regexp::Structure::Unknown.

   <b>SUFFICIENT_UTF8_SUPPORT_FOR_WEIRD_DELIMITERS</b>
       A Boolean which is true if the running version of Perl has UTF-8 support sufficient for our purposes.

       Currently that means 5.8.3 or greater, with the specific requirements being "use open qw{ :std
       :encoding(utf-8) }", "/\p{Mark}/", and the ability to parse things like "qr \N{U+FFFF}foo\N{U+FFFF}".

   <b>TOKEN_LITERAL</b>
       The name of the class that represents a literal token. That is, PPIx::Regexp::Token::Literal.

   <b>TOKEN_UNKNOWN</b>
       The name of the class that represents the unknown token. That is, PPIx::Regexp::Token::Unknown.

   <b>TRUE</b>
       A true value. The author makes no commitment what the exact value is, only that Boolean operations will
       see it as true.

   <b>VARIABLE_LENGTH_LOOK_BEHIND_INTRODUCED</b>
       The version in which variable-length look-behinds were introduced.  Currently this is '5.029009', and
       implies the limited lookbehind introduced at or about that version.
