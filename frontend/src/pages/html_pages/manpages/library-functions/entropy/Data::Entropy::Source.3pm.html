       Data::Entropy::Source - encapsulated source of entropy

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
               use Data::Entropy::Source;

               $source = Data::Entropy::Source-&gt;new($handle, "sysread");

               $c = $source-&gt;get_octet;
               $str = $source-&gt;<a href="../man17/get_bits.17.html">get_bits</a>(17);
               $i = $source-&gt;<a href="../man12345/get_int.12345.html">get_int</a>(12345);
               $i = $source-&gt;get_int(Math::BigInt-&gt;new("1000000000000"));
               $j = $source-&gt;get_prob(1, 2);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       An object of this class encapsulates a source of entropy (randomness).  Methods allow entropy to be
       dispensed in any quantity required, even fractional bits.  An entropy source object should not normally
       be used directly.  Rather, it should be used to support higher-level entropy-consuming algorithms, such
       as those in Data::Entropy::Algorithms.

       This type of object is constructed as a layer over a raw entropy source which does not supply methods to
       extract arbitrary amounts of entropy.  The raw entropy source is expected to dispense only entire octets
       at a time.  The <b>/dev/random</b> devices on some versions of Unix constitute such a source, for example.  The
       raw entropy source is accessed via the "IO::Handle" interface.  This interface may be supplied by classes
       other than "IO::Handle" itself, as is done for example by "Data::Entropy::RawSource::CryptCounter".

       If two entropy sources of this class are given exactly the same raw entropy data, for example by reading
       from the same file, and exactly the same sequence of "get_" method calls is made to them, then they will
       return exactly the same values from those calls.  (Calls with numerical arguments that have the same
       numerical value but are of different types count as the same for this purpose.)  This means that a run of
       an entropy-using algorithm can be made completely deterministic if desired.

</pre><h4><b>CONSTRUCTOR</b></h4><pre>
       Data::Entropy::Source-&gt;new(RAW_SOURCE, READ_STYLE)
           Constructs and returns an entropy source object based on the given raw source.  RAW_SOURCE must be an
           I/O  handle  referring to a source of entropy that can be read one octet at a time.  Specifically, it
           must support either the "getc" or "sysread" method described in IO::Handle.   READ_STYLE  must  be  a
           string,  either  "getc"  or  "sysread",  indicating  which method should be used to read from the raw
           source.  No methods other than the one specified will ever be called on the raw source handle,  so  a
           full implementation of "IO::Handle" is not required.

           The  "sysread"  method  should  be used with <b>/dev/random</b> and its ilk, because buffering would be very
           wasteful of entropy and might consequently block other processes that require entropy.  "getc" should
           be preferred when reading entropy from a regular file, and it is the  more  convenient  interface  to
           implement when a non-I/O object is being used for the handle.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       $source-&gt;get_octet
           Returns  an  octet  of  entropy,  as  a string of length one.  This provides direct access to the raw
           entropy source.

       $source-&gt;get_bits(NBITS)
           Returns NBITS bits of entropy, as a string of octets.  If NBITS is not a multiple of eight  then  the
           last octet in the string has its most significant bits set to zero.

       $source-&gt;get_int(LIMIT)
           LIMIT  must  be  a  positive  integer.   Returns  a  uniformly-distributed random number between zero
           inclusive and LIMIT exclusive.  LIMIT may be either a native integer, a "Math::BigInt" object, or  an
           integer-valued "Math::BigRat" object; the returned number is of the same type.

           This  method dispenses a non-integer number of bits of entropy.  For example, if LIMIT is 10 then the
           result contains approximately 3.32 bits of entropy.  The minimum non-zero amount of entropy that  can
           be obtained is 1 bit, with LIMIT = 2.

       $source-&gt;get_prob(PROB0, PROB1)
           PROB0  and  PROB1  must  be  non-negative  integers, not both zero.  They may each be either a native
           integer, a "Math::BigInt" object, or an integer-valued "Math::BigRat" objects; types  may  be  mixed.
           Returns  either  0  or  1,  with relative probabilities PROB0 and PROB1.  That is, the probability of
           returning 0 is PROB0/(PROB0+PROB1), and the probability of returning 1 is PROB1/(PROB0+PROB1).

           This method dispenses a fraction of a bit of entropy.  The maximum amount  of  entropy  that  can  be
           obtained  is 1 bit, with PROB0 = PROB1.  The more different the probabilities are the less entropy is
           obtained.  For example, if PROB0 = 1 and PROB1 = 2 then the result contains approximately 0.918  bits
           of entropy.
