</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Boulder</b> <b>IO</b>
       Boulder IO is a simple TAG=VALUE data format designed for sharing data between programs connected via a
       pipe.  It is also simple enough to use as a common data exchange format between databases, Web pages, and
       other data representations.

       The basic data format is very simple.  It consists of a series of TAG=VALUE pairs separated by newlines.
       It is record-oriented.  The end of a record is indicated by an empty delimiter alone on a line.  The
       delimiter is "=" by default, but can be adjusted by the user.

       An example boulder stream looks like this:

               Name=Lincoln Stein
               Home=/u/bush202/lds32
               Organization=Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory
               Login=lds32
               Password_age=20
               Password_expires=60
               Alias=lstein
               Alias=steinl
               =
               Name=Leigh Deacon
               Home=/u/bush202/tanager
               Organization=Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory
               Login=tanager
               Password_age=2
               Password_expires=60
               =

       Notes:

       (1) There  is  no  need  for  all  tags  to  appear  in  all records, or indeed for all the records to be
           homogeneous.

       (2) Multiple values are allowed, as with the Alias tag in the second record.

       (3) Lines can be any length, as in a potential 40 Kbp DNA sequence entry.

       (4) Tags can be any alphanumeric character (upper  or  lower  case)  and  may  contain  embedded  spaces.
           Conventionally we use the characters A-Z0-9_, because they can be used without single quoting as keys
           in  Perl associative arrays, but this is merely stylistic.  Values can be any character at all except
           for the reserved characters {}=% and newline.  You can incorporate binary data into the  data  stream
           by  escaping  these  characters  in  the  URL  manner,  using  a % sign followed by the (capitalized)
           hexadecimal code for the character.  The module makes this automatic.

   <b>Hierarchical</b> <b>Records</b>
       The simple boulder  format  can  be  extended  to  accommodate  nested  relations  and  other  intresting
       structures.  Nested records can be created in this way:

        Name=Lincoln Stein
        Home=/u/bush202/lds32
        Organization=Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory
        Login=lds32
        Password_age=20
        Password_expires=60
        Privileges={
          ChangePasswd=yes
          CronJobs=yes
          Reboot=yes
          Shutdown=no
        }
        =
        Name=Leigh Deacon
        Home=/u/bush202/tanager
        Organization=Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory
        Login=tanager
        Password_age=2
        Password_expires=60
        Privileges={
          ChangePasswd=yes
          CronJobs=no
          Reboot=no
          Shutdown=no
        }
        =

       As in the original format, tags may be multivalued.  For example, there might be several Privilege record
       assigned to a login account.  Each subrecord may contain further subrecords.

       Within  the  program,  a  hierarchical  record is encapsulated within a "Stone", an opaque structure that
       implements methods for fetching and settings its various tags.

   <b>Using</b> <b>Boulder</b> <b>for</b> <b>I/O</b>
       The Boulder API was designed to make reading and writing of complex hierarchical records almost  as  easy
       as reading and writing single lines of text.

       Boulder::Stream
           The  main  component of the Boulder modules is Boulder::Stream, which provides a stream-oriented view
           of the data.  You can read and write to Boulder::Streams via tied filehandles, or via  method  calls.
           Data records are flattened into a simple format called "boulderio" format.

       Boulder::XML
           Boulder::XML  acts  like  Boulder::Stream, but the serialization format is XML.  You need XML::Parser
           installed to use this module.

       Boulder::Store
           This is a simple persistent storage class which allows you to store several (thousand) Stone's into a
           DB_File database.  You must have libdb and the Perl DB_File extensions installed  in  order  to  take
           advantage of this class.

       Boulder::Genbank
       Boulder::Unigene
       Boulder::OMIM
       Boulder::Blast
       Boulder::Medline
       Boulder::SwissProt
           These  are parsers and accessors for various biological data sources.  They act like Boulder::Stream,
           but return a set of Stone objects that have certain  prescribed  tags  and  values.   Many  of  these
           modules were written by Luca I.G. Toldo &lt;<a href="mailto:luca.toldo@merck.de">luca.toldo@merck.de</a>&gt;.

   <b>Stone</b> <b>Objects</b>
       The  Stone object encapsulates a set of tags and values.  Any tag can be single- or multivalued, and tags
       are allowed to contain subtags to any depth.  A  simple  set  of  methods  named  <b>tags()</b>,  <b>get()</b>,  <b>put()</b>,
       <b>insert()</b>,  <b>replace()</b>  and  so forth, allows you to examine the tags that are available, get and set their
       values, and search for particular tags.  In addition, an autoload mechanism  allows  you  to  use  method
       calls to access tags, for example:

          my @friends = $record-&gt;Friends;

       is equivalent to:

          my @friends = $record-&gt;get('Friends');

       A Stone::Cursor class allows you to traverse Stones systematically.

       A full explanation of the Stone class can be found in its manual page.
