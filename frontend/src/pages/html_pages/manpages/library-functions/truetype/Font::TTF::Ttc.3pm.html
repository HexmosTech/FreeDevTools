</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Font::TTF::Ttc - Truetype Collection class

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       A TrueType collection is a collection of TrueType fonts in one file in which tables may be shared between
       different directories. In order to support this, the TTC introduces the concept of a table being shared
       by different TrueType fonts. This begs the question of what should happen to the ' PARENT' property of a
       particular table. It is made to point to the first directory object which refers to it. It is therefore
       up to the application to sort out any confusion.  Confusion only occurs if shared tables require access
       to non-shared tables.  This should not happen since the shared tables are dealing with glyph information
       only and the private tables are dealing with encoding and glyph identification. Thus the general
       direction is from identification to glyph and not the other way around (at least not without knowledge of
       the particular context).

</pre><h4><b>INSTANCE</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following instance variables are preceded by a space

       fname (P)
           Filename for this TrueType Collection

       INFILE (P)
           The filehandle of this collection

       The following instance variable does not start with a space

       directs
           An array of directories (Font::TTF::Font objects) for each sub-font in the directory

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Font::TTF::Ttc-&gt;open($fname)</b>
       Opens  and  reads the given filename as a TrueType Collection. Reading a collection involves reading each
       of the directories which go to make up the collection.

   <b>$c-&gt;read</b>
       Reads a Collection by reading all the directories in the collection

   <b>$c-&gt;find($direct,</b> <b>$name,</b> <b>$check,</b> <b>$off,</b> <b>$len)</b>
       Hunts around to see if a table with the given characteristics of name, checksum, offset  and  length  has
       been  associated with a directory earlier in the list.  Actually on checks the offset since no two tables
       can share the same offset in a TrueType font, collection or otherwise.

   <b>$c-&gt;DESTROY</b>
       Closees any opened files by us

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       No known bugs, but then not ever executed!
