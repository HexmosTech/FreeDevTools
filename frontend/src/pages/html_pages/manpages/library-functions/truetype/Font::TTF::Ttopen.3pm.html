</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Font::TTF::Ttopen - Opentype superclass for standard Opentype lookup based tables (GSUB and GPOS)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Handles all the script, lang, feature, lookup stuff for a Font::TTF::Gsub/Font::TTF::Gpos table leaving
       the class specifics to the subclass

</pre><h4><b>INSTANCE</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       The instance variables of an opentype table form a complex sub-module hierarchy.

       Version
           This contains the version of the table as a floating point number

       SCRIPTS
           The  scripts  list  is a hash of script tags. Each script tag (of the form $t-&gt;{'SCRIPTS'}{$tag}) has
           information below it.

           OFFSET  This variable is preceded by a space and gives the offset from the start of  the  table  (not
                   the table section) to the script table for this script

           REFTAG  This  variable  is  preceded by a space and gives a corresponding script tag to this one such
                   that the offsets in the file are the same. When writing, it is up to  the  caller  to  ensure
                   that  the  REFTAGs are set correctly, since these will be used to assume that the scripts are
                   identical. Note that REFTAG must refer to a script which has no REFTAG of its own.

           DEFAULT This corresponds to the default language for this script, if there is one, and  contains  the
                   same information as an itemised language

           LANG_TAGS
                   This  contains an array of language tag strings (each 4 bytes) corresponding to the languages
                   listed by this script

           $lang   Each language is a hash containing its information:

                   OFFSET      This variable is preceded by a a space and gives the offset from the start of the
                               whole table to the language table for this language

                   REFTAG      This variable is preceded by a space and has the same function as for the  script
                               REFTAG, only for the languages within a script.

                   RE-ORDER    This  indicates  re-ordering  information, and has not been set. The value should
                               always be 0.

                   DEFAULT     This holds the index of the default feature, if there is one, or -1 otherwise.

                   FEATURES    This is an array of feature tags for all the features enabled for this language

       FEATURES
           The features section of instance variables corresponds to the feature table in the opentype table.

           FEAT_TAGS
                   This array gives the ordered list of feature tags for this table. It is used  during  reading
                   and writing for converting between feature index and feature tag.

           The  rest  of  the FEATURES variable is itself a hash based on the feature tag for each feature. Each
           feature has the following structure:

           OFFSET  This attribute is preceded by a space and gives the offset relative to the start of the whole
                   table of this particular feature.

           PARMS   If FeatureParams are defined for this feature, this contains a reference to the corresponding
                   FeatureParams object.  Otherwise set to null.

           LOOKUPS This is an array containing indices to lookups in the LOOKUP instance variable of the table

           INDEX   This gives the feature index for this feature and is used  during  reading  and  writing  for
                   converting between feature tag and feature index.

       LOOKUP
           This  variable  is  an  array  of lookups in order and is indexed via the features of a language of a
           script. Each lookup contains subtables and other information:

           OFFSET  This name is preceded by a space and contains the offset from the start of the table to  this
                   particular lookup

           TYPE    This  is  a  subclass  specific type for a lookup. It stipulates the type of lookup and hence
                   subtables within the lookup

           FLAG    Holds the lookup flag bits

           FILTER  Holds the MarkFilteringSet (that is, the index into GDEF-&gt;MARKSETS) for the lookup.

           SUB     This holds an array of subtables which are subclass specific.  Each  subtable  must  have  an
                   OFFSET.  The other variables described here are an abstraction used in both the GSUB and GPOS
                   tables which are the target subclasses of this class.

                   OFFSET      This is preceded by a space and gives the offset relative to  the  start  of  the
                               table for this subtable

                   FORMAT      Gives  the  sub-table  sub format for this GSUB subtable. It is assumed that this
                               value is correct when it comes time to write the subtable.

                   COVERAGE    Most lookups consist of a coverage table corresponding  to  the  first  glyph  to
                               match.  The  offset  of this coverage table is stored here and the coverage table
                               looked up against the GSUB table proper.  There  are  two  lookups  without  this
                               initial  coverage  table  which  is  used  to  index into the RULES array.  These
                               lookups have one element in the RULES array which is used for the whole match.

                   RULES       The rules are a  complex  array.  In  most  cases,  each  element  of  the  array
                               corresponds to an element in the coverage table (governed by the coverage index).
                               In a few caess, such as when there is no coverage table, then there is considered
                               to be only one element in the rules array. Each element of the array is itself an
                               array  corresponding to the possibly multiple string matches which may follow the
                               initial glyph. Each element of this array is a hash with fixed keys corresponding
                               to information needed to match a glyph string or act  upon  it.  Thus  the  RULES
                               element is an array of arrays of hashes which contain the following keys:

                               MATCH           This  contains  a  sequence  of  elements  held  as an array. The
                                               elements may be glyph ids (gid), class ids (cids), or offsets  to
                                               coverage  tables.  Each  element  corresponds to one glyph in the
                                               glyph string. See MATCH_TYPE for details  of  how  the  different
                                               element types are marked.

                               PRE             This  array  holds  the  sequence of elements preceding the first
                                               match element and has the same form as the MATCH array.

                               POST            This array holds the  sequence  of  elements  to  be  tested  for
                                               following  the  match string and is of the same form as the MATCH
                                               array.

                               ACTION          This array holds information regarding what should be done  if  a
                                               match  is  found.  The array may either hold glyph ids (which are
                                               used to replace or insert or whatever glyphs in the glyph string)
                                               or 2 element arrays consisting of:

                                               OFFSET              Offset from the start of the  matched  string
                                                                   that   the   lookup   should  start  at  when
                                                                   processing the substring.

                                               LOOKUP_INDEX        The index to a lookup to be acted upon on the
                                                                   match string.

                   CLASS       For those lookups which use class categories rather than glyph ids  for  matching
                               this is the offset to the class definition used to categories glyphs in the match
                               string.

                   PRE_CLASS   This is the offset to the class definition for the before match glyphs

                   POST_CLASS  This is the offset to the class definition for the after match glyphs.

                   ACTION_TYPE This  string holds the type of information held in the ACTION variable of a RULE.
                               It is subclass specific.

                   MATCH_TYPE  This holds the type of information in the MATCH array of a RULE. This is subclass
                               specific.

                   ADJUST      This corresponds to a single action for  all  items  in  a  coverage  table.  The
                               meaning is subclass specific.

                   CACHE       This key starts with a space

                               A hash of other tables (such as coverage tables, classes, anchors, device tables)
                               based  on  the offset given in the subtable to that other information.  Note that
                               the documentation is particularly unhelpful here in that such tables are given as
                               offsets relative to the beginning of the subtable not the whole GSUB table.  This
                               includes  those  items  which  are  stored  relative  to  another base within the
                               subtable.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>$t-&gt;read</b>
       Reads the table passing control to the subclass to handle the subtable specifics

   <b>$t-&gt;read_sub($fh,</b> <b>$lookup,</b> <b>$index)</b>
       This stub is to allow subclasses to read subtables of lookups in a table specific manner. A reference  to
       the  lookup  is passed in along with the subtable index. The file is located at the start of the subtable
       to be read

   <b>$t-&gt;extension()</b>
       Returns the lookup number for the extension table that allows access to 32-bit offsets.

   <b>$t-&gt;out($fh)</b>
       Writes this Opentype table to the output calling $t-&gt;out_sub for each sub table at the appropriate  point
       in  the output. The assumption is that on entry the number of scripts, languages, features, lookups, etc.
       are all resolved and the relationships fixed. This includes a LANG_TAGS list for a script, and  that  all
       scripts and languages in their respective dictionaries either have a REFTAG or contain real data.

   <b>$t-&gt;num_sub($lookup)</b>
       Asks the subclass to count the number of subtables for a particular lookup and to return that value. Used
       in <b>out()</b>.

   <b>$t-&gt;out_sub($fh,</b> <b>$lookup,</b> <b>$index)</b>
       This  stub  is to allow subclasses to output subtables of lookups in a table specific manner. A reference
       to the lookup is passed in along with the subtable index. The  file  is  located  at  the  start  of  the
       subtable to be output

   <b>$t-&gt;dirty</b>
       Setting GPOS or GSUB dirty means that OS/2 may need updating, so set it dirty.

   <b>$t-&gt;maxContext</b>
       Returns the length of the longest opentype rule in this table.

   <b>$t-&gt;update</b>
       Perform various housekeeping items:

       For all lookups, set/clear 0x0010 bit of flag words based on 'FILTER' value.

       Sort COVERAGE table and RULES for all lookups.

       Unless  $t-&gt;{'  PARENT'}{' noharmony'} is true, update will make sure that GPOS and GSUB include the same
       scripts and languages. Any added scripts and languages will have empty feature sets.

</pre><h4><b>Internal</b> <b>Functions</b> <b>&amp;</b> <b>Methods</b></h4><pre>
       Most of these methods are used by subclasses for handling such things as coverage tables.

   <b>copy($ref)</b>
       Internal function to copy the top level of a dictionary to create a new dictionary.  Only the  top  level
       is copied.

   <b>$t-&gt;read_cover($cover_offset,</b> <b>$lookup_loc,</b> <b>$lookup,</b> <b>$fh,</b> <b>$is_cover)</b>
       Reads  a  coverage  table and stores the results in $lookup-&gt;{' CACHE'}, that is, if it has not been read
       already.

   <b>ref_cache($obj,</b> <b>$cache,</b> <b>$offset</b> <b>[,</b> <b>$template])</b>
       Internal function to keep track of the local  positioning  of  subobjects  such  as  coverage  and  class
       definition tables, and their offsets.  What happens is that the cache is a hash of sub objects indexed by
       the  reference  (using  a  string  mashing  of  the reference name which is valid for the duration of the
       reference) and holds a list of locations in the output string which should be filled in with  the  offset
       to the sub object when the final string is output in out_final.

       Uses tricks for Tie::Refhash

   <b>out_final($fh,</b> <b>$out,</b> <b>$cache_list,</b> <b>$state)</b>
       Internal  function  to actually output everything to the file handle given that now we know the offset to
       the first sub object to be output and which sub objects are to be output and what locations  need  to  be
       updated, we can now generate everything. $cache_list is an array of two element arrays. The first element
       is  a  cache  object, the second is an offset to be subtracted from each reference to that object made in
       the cache.

       If $state is 1, then the output is not sent to the filehandle and the return value is the  string  to  be
       output.  If  $state is absent or 0 then output is not limited by storing in a string first and the return
       value is "";

   <b>$self-&gt;read_context($lookup,</b> <b>$fh,</b> <b>$type,</b> <b>$fmt,</b> <b>$cover,</b> <b>$count,</b> <b>$loc)</b>
       Internal method to read context (simple and chaining context) lookup subtables  for  the  GSUB  and  GPOS
       table  types. The assumed values for $type correspond to those for GSUB, so GPOS should adjust the values
       upon calling.

   <b>$self-&gt;out_context($lookup,</b> <b>$fh,</b> <b>$type,</b> <b>$fmt,</b> <b>$ctables,</b> <b>$out,</b> <b>$num)</b>
       Provides shared behaviour between GSUB and GPOS tables during output for  context  (chained  and  simple)
       rules.  In  addition,  support  is  provided here for type 4 GSUB tables, which are not used in GPOS. The
       value for $type corresponds to the type in a GSUB table so calling from  GPOS  should  adjust  the  value
       accordingly.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       •   No  way  to  share cachable items (coverage tables, classes, anchors, device tables) across different
           lookups. The items are always output after the  lookup  and  repeated  if  necessary.  Within  lookup
           sharing is possible.
