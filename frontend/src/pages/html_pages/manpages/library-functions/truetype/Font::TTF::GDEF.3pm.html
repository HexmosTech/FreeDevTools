       Font::TTF::GDEF - Opentype GDEF table support

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The GDEF table contains various global lists of information which are apparantly used in other places in
       an OpenType renderer. But precisely where is open to speculation...

</pre><h4><b>INSTANCE</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       There are up to 5 tables in the GDEF table, each with their own structure:

       GLYPH
           This  is  an  Font::TTF::Coverage  Class Definition table containing information as to what type each
           glyph is.

       ATTACH
           The attach table consists of a coverage table and then  attachment  points  for  each  glyph  in  the
           coverage table:

           COVERAGE
                   This is a coverage table

           POINTS  This is an array of point elements. Each element is an array of curve points corresponding to
                   the  attachment  points on that glyph. The order of the curve points in the array corresponds
                   to the attachment point number specified in the MARKS coverage table (see below).

       LIG This contains the ligature caret positioning information for ligature glyphs

           COVERAGE
                   A coverage table to say which glyphs are ligatures

           LIGS    An array of elements for each ligature. Each element is an  array  of  information  for  each
                   caret position in the ligature (there being number of components - 1 of these, generally)

                   FMT         This  is  the format of the information and is important to provide the semantics
                               for the value. This value must be set correctly before output

                   VAL         The value which has meaning according to FMT

                   DEVICE      For FMT = 3, a device table is also referenced which is stored here

       MARKS
           This class definition table defines the classes of mark glyphs that can be  selected  for  processing
           using the MarkAttachmentType field of lookup FLAG words.

       MARKSETS
           Contains an array of coverage tables indexed by the FILTER value of a lookup.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>$t-&gt;read</b>
       Reads the table into the data structure

   <b>$t-&gt;out($fh)</b>
       Writes out this table.

   <b>$t-&gt;minsize()</b>
       Returns  the  minimum  size this table can be. If it is smaller than this, then the table must be bad and
       should be deleted or whatever.

   <b>$t-&gt;update</b>
       Sort COVERAGE tables.
