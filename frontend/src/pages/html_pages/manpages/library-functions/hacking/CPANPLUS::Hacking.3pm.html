</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       CPANPLUS::Hacking - developing CPANPLUS

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This document attempts to describe how to develop with the CPANPLUS environment most easily, how certain
       things work and why.

       This is basically a quick-start guide to people who want to add features or patches to CPANPLUS.

</pre><h4><b>OBTAINING</b> <b>CPANPLUS</b></h4><pre>
       Checkout CPANPLUS from its GIT repository at &lt;https://github.com/jib/cpanplus-devel&gt; .

</pre><h4><b>INSTALLING</b> <b>CPANPLUS</b></h4><pre>
       CPANPLUS follows the standard perl module installation process:

           perl Makefile.PL
           make
           make test
           make install

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURING</b> <b>CPANPLUS</b></h4><pre>
       When running "perl Makefile.PL" you will be prompted to configure.  If you have already done so, and
       merely wish to update the "Makefile", simply run:

           perl Makefile.PL JFDI=1

       This will keep your configuration intact. Note however, if there are changes to the default configuration
       file "Config.pm-orig", you should either delete your current config file and reconfigure, or patch your
       config file from the new entries in "Config.pm-orig".

</pre><h4><b>RUNNING</b> <b>CPANPLUS</b> <b>FROM</b> <b>DEVELOPMENT</b> <b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       If you'd rather not install the development version to your "site_perl" directory, that's no problem. You
       can set your "PERL5LIB" environment variable to CPANPLUS' "lib" directory, and you can run it from there.

</pre><h4><b>RUNNING</b> <b>CPANPLUS</b> <b>TESTS</b></h4><pre>
       Tests are what tells us if CPANPLUS is working. If a test is not working, try to run it explicitly like
       this:

           perl -I/path/to/cpanplus/lib t/XX_name_of_test.t 1

       The extra '1' makes sure that all the messages and errors (they might be errors we're testing for!) are
       being printed rather than kept quiet.  This is a great way to find out the context of any failures that
       may occur.

       If you believe this test failure proves a bug in CPANPLUS, the long output of the test file is something
       we'd like to see alongside your bug report.

</pre><h4><b>FINDING</b> <b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Sometimes you might find bugs in CPANPLUS' behaviour. If you encounter these in a development snapshot,
       we'd appreciate a complete patch (as described below in the "SENDING PATCHES" section.

       If it's way over your head, then of course reporting the bug is always better than not reporting it at
       all. Before you do so though, make sure you have the <b>latest</b> development snapshot, and the bug still
       persists there. If so, report the bug to this address:

           <a href="mailto:bug-cpanplus@rt.cpan.org">bug-cpanplus@rt.cpan.org</a>

       A good "patch" would have the following characteristics:

       Problem description
           Describe clearly what the bug is you found, and what it should have done instead.

       Program demonstrating the bug
           Show us how to reproduce the bug, in a simple of a program as possible

       [OPTIONAL] A patch to the test suite to test for the bug
           Amend  our  test suite by making sure this bug will be found in this, and future versions of CPANPLUS
           (see "SUPPLYING PATCHES")

       [OPTIONAL] A patch to the code + tests + documentation
           Fix the bug, update the docs &amp; tests. That way your bug will be gone forever :)

</pre><h4><b>SUPPLYING</b> <b>PATCHES</b></h4><pre>
       Patches are a good thing, and they are welcome. Especially if they fix bugs you've found along  the  way,
       or that others have reported.

       We prefer patches in the following format:

       •   In "diff -u" or "diff -c" format

       •   From the root of the snapshot

       •   Including patches for code + tests + docs

       •   Sent per mail to <a href="mailto:bug-cpanplus@rt.cpan.org">bug-cpanplus@rt.cpan.org</a>

       •   With subject containing "[PATCH]" + description of the patch

       You  will  always  be  informed  if  a patch is applied or rejected, and in case of rejection why that is
       (perhaps you can tweak the patch to have it accepted after all).
