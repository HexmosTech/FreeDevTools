</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       PDF::API2::Content - Methods for adding graphics and text to a PDF

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           # Start with a PDF page (new or opened)
           my $pdf = PDF::API2-&gt;new();
           my $page = $pdf-&gt;page();

           # Add a new content object
           my $content = $page-&gt;graphics();
           my $content = $page-&gt;text();

           # Then call the methods below to add graphics and text to the page.

</pre><h4><b>COORDINATE</b> <b>TRANSFORMATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The methods in this section change the coordinate system for the current content object relative to the
       rest of the document.

       Changes to the coordinate system only affect subsequent paths or text.

       A call to any of the methods in this section resets the coordinate system before applying its changes,
       unless the "relative" option is set.

   <b>translate</b>
           $content = $content-&gt;translate($x, $y);

       Moves the origin along the x and y axes.

   <b>rotate</b>
           $content = $content-&gt;rotate($degrees);

       Rotates the coordinate system counter-clockwise.

       Use a negative argument to rotate clockwise.

   <b>scale</b>
           $content = $content-&gt;scale($x, $y);

       Scales (stretches) the coordinate systems along the x and y axes.  A value of 1 for either $x or $y
       represents 100% scale (i.e. no change).

   <b>skew</b>
           $content = $content-&gt;skew($a, $b);

       Skews the coordinate system by $a degrees (counter-clockwise) from the x axis and $b degrees (clockwise)
       from the y axis.

   <b>transform</b>
           $content = $content-&gt;transform(
               translate =&gt; [$x, $y],
               rotate    =&gt; $degrees,
               scale     =&gt; [$x, $y],
               skew      =&gt; [$a, $b],
               repeat    =&gt; $boolean,
           );

       Performs multiple coordinate transformations, in the order recommended by the PDF specification
       (translate, rotate, scale, then skew).  Omitted options will be unchanged.

       If "repeat" is true and if this is not the first call to a transformation method, the previous
       transformation will be performed again, modified by any other provided arguments.

   <b>matrix</b>
           $graphics = $graphics-&gt;matrix($a, $b, $c, $d, $e, $f);

           ($a, $b, $c, $d, $e, $f) = $text-&gt;matrix($a, $b, $c, $d, $e, $f);

       Sets the current transformation matrix manually.  Unless you have a particular need to enter
       transformations manually, you should use the "transform" method instead.

       The return value differs based on whether the caller is a graphics content object or a text content
       object.

</pre><h4><b>GRAPHICS</b> <b>STATE</b></h4><pre>
   <b>save</b>
           $content = $content-&gt;save();

       Saves the current graphics state on a stack.

   <b>restore</b>
           $content = $content-&gt;restore();

       Restores the most recently saved graphics state, removing it from the stack.

   <b>line_width</b>
           $content = $content-&gt;line_width($points);

       Sets the width of the stroke in points.

   <b>line_cap</b>
           $content = $content-&gt;line_cap($style);

       Sets the shape that will be used at the ends of open subpaths (and dashes, if any) when they are stroked.

       •   "butt" or 0 = Butt Cap, default

           The stroke ends at the end of the path, with no projection.

       •   "round" or 1 = Round Cap)

           An arc is drawn around the end of the path with a diameter equal to the line width, and is filled in.

       •   "square" or 2 = Projecting Square Cap

           The stroke continues past the end of the path for half the line width.

   <b>line_join</b>
           $content = $content-&gt;line_join($style);

       Sets the style of join to be used at corners of a path.

       •   "miter" or 0 = Miter Join, default

           The  outer edges of the stroke extend until they meet, up to the limit specified below.  If the limit
           would be surpassed, a bevel join is used instead.

       •   "round" or 1 = Round Join

           A circle with a diameter equal to the linewidth is drawn around the corner point, producing a rounded
           corner.

       •   "bevel" or 2 = Bevel Join

           A triangle is drawn to fill in the notch between the two strokes.

   <b>miter_limit</b>
           $content = $content-&gt;miter_limit($ratio);

       Sets the miter limit when the line join style is a miter join.

       The $ratio is the maximum length of the miter (inner to outer corner) divided  by  the  line  width.  Any
       miter  above  this ratio will be converted to a bevel join. The practical effect is that lines meeting at
       shallow angles are chopped off instead of producing long pointed corners.

       There is no documented default miter limit.

   <b>line_dash_pattern</b>
           # Solid line
           $content = $content-&gt;line_dash_pattern();

           # Equal length lines and gaps
           $content = $content-&gt;line_dash_pattern($length);

           # Specified line and gap lengths
           $content = $content-&gt;line_dash_pattern($line1, $gap1, $line2, $gap2, ...);

           # Offset the starting point
           $content = $content-&gt;line_dash_pattern(
               pattern =&gt; [$line1, $gap1, $line2, $gap2, ...],
               offset =&gt; $points,
           );

       Sets the line dash pattern.

       If called without any arguments, a solid line will be drawn.

       If called with one argument, the dashes and gaps will have equal lengths.

       If called with two or more arguments, the arguments represent alternating dash and gap lengths.

       If called with a hash of arguments, a dash phase may be  set,  which  specifies  the  distance  into  the
       pattern at which to start the dash.

   <b>flatness_tolerance</b>
           $content = $content-&gt;flatness_tolerance($tolerance);

       Sets  the  maximum  distance  in device pixels between the mathematically correct path for a curve and an
       approximation constructed from straight line segments.

       $tolerance is an integer between 0 and 100, where 0 represents the device's default flatness tolerance.

   <b>egstate</b>
           $content = $content-&gt;egstate($object);

       Adds a PDF::API2::Resource::ExtGState object containing a set of graphics state parameters.

</pre><h4><b>PATH</b> <b>CONSTRUCTION</b> <b>(DRAWING)</b></h4><pre>
       Note that paths will not appear until a path painting method is called ("stroke", "fill", or "paint").

   <b>move</b>
           $content = $content-&gt;move($x, $y);

       Starts a new path at the specified coordinates.

   <b>line</b>
           $content = $content-&gt;line($x, $y);

       Extends the path in a line from the current coordinates to the specified coordinates.

   <b>hline</b>
           $content = $content-&gt;hline($x);

       Extends the path in a horizontal line from the current position to the specified x coordinate.

   <b>vline</b>
           $content = $content-&gt;vline($x);

       Extends the path in a vertical line from the current position to the specified y coordinate.

   <b>polyline</b>
           $content = $content-&gt;polyline($x1, $y1, $x2, $y2, ...);

       Extends the path from the current position in one or more straight lines.

   <b>curve</b>
           $content = $content-&gt;curve($cx1, $cy1, $cx2, $cy2, $x, $y);

       Extends the path in a curve from the current point to "($x, $y)",  using  the  two  specified  points  to
       create a cubic Bezier curve.

   <b>spline</b>
           $content = $content-&gt;spline($cx1, $cy1, $x, $y);

       Extends  the  path  in  a  curve  from the current point to "($x, $y)", using the two specified points to
       create a spline.

   <b>arc</b>
           $content = $content-&gt;arc($x, $y, $major, $minor, $a, $b);

       Extends the path along an arc of an ellipse centered at "[$x, $y]".  $major and $minor represent the axes
       of the ellipse, and the arc moves from $a degrees to $b degrees.

   <b>close</b>
           $content = $content-&gt;close();

       Closes the current path by extending a line from the current position to the starting position.

</pre><h4><b>SHAPE</b> <b>CONSTRUCTION</b> <b>(DRAWING)</b></h4><pre>
       The following are convenience methods for drawing closed paths.

       Note that shapes will not appear until a path painting method is called ("stroke", "fill", or "paint").

   <b>rectangle</b>
           $content = $content-&gt;rectangle($x1, $y1, $x2, $y2);

       Creates a new rectangle-shaped path, between the two points "[$x1, $y1]" and "[$x2, $y2]".

   <b>circle</b>
           $content = $content-&gt;circle($x, $y, $radius);

       Creates a new circular path centered on "[$x, $y]" with the specified radius.

   <b>ellipse</b>
           $content = $content-&gt;ellipse($x, $y, $major, $minor);

       Creates a new elliptical path centered on "[$x, $y]" with the specified major and minor axes.

   <b>pie</b>
           $content = $content-&gt;pie($x, $y, $major, $minor, $a, $b);

       Creates a new wedge-shaped path from an ellipse centered on "[$x, $y]" with the specified major and minor
       axes, extending from $a degrees to $b degrees.

</pre><h4><b>PATH</b> <b>PAINTING</b> <b>(DRAWING)</b></h4><pre>
   <b>stroke_color</b>
           $content-&gt;stroke_color($color, @arguments);

       Sets the stroke color, which is black by default.

           # Use a named color
           $content-&gt;stroke_color('blue');

           # Use an RGB color (start with '#')
           $content-&gt;stroke_color('#FF0000');

           # Use a CMYK color (start with '%')
           $content-&gt;stroke_color('%FF000000');

           # Use a spot color with 100% coverage.
           my $spot = $pdf-&gt;colorspace('spot', 'PANTONE Red 032 C', '#EF3340');
           $content-&gt;stroke_color($spot, 1.0);

       RGB and CMYK colors can have  one-byte,  two-byte,  three-byte,  or  four-byte  values  for  each  color,
       depending   on   the  level  of  precision  needed.   For  instance,  cyan  can  be  given  as  %F000  or
       %FFFF000000000000.

   <b>fill_color</b>
           $content-&gt;fill_color($color, @arguments);

       Sets the fill color, which is black by default.  Arguments are the same as in "stroke_color".

   <b>stroke</b>
           $content = $content-&gt;stroke();

       Strokes the current path.

   <b>fill</b>
           $content = $content-&gt;fill(rule =&gt; $rule);

       Fills the current path.

       $rule describes which areas are filled in when the path intersects with itself.

       •   nonzero (default)

           Use the nonzero winding number rule.  This tends to mean that the entire area enclosed by the path is
           filled in, with some exceptions depending on the direction of the path.

       •   even-odd

           Use the even-odd rule.  This tends to mean that the presence of fill alternates each time the path is
           intersected.

       See PDF specification 1.7 section 8.5.3.3, Filling, for more details.

   <b>paint</b>
           $content = $content-&gt;paint(rule =&gt; $rule);

       Fills and strokes the current path.  $rule is as described in "fill".

   <b>clip</b>
           $content = $content-&gt;clip(rule =&gt; $rule);

       Modifies the current clipping path (initially the entire page) by intersecting it with the  current  path
       following the next path-painting command.  $rule is as described in "fill".

   <b>end</b>
           $content = $content-&gt;end();

       Ends  the  current  path  without  filling  or  stroking.   This is used primarily for the side effect of
       changing the current clipping path.

</pre><h4><b>EXTERNAL</b> <b>OBJECTS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>object</b>
           $content = $content-&gt;object($object, $x, $y, $scale_x, $scale_y);

       Places an image or other external object (a.k.a. XObject) on the page in the specified location.

       If $x and $y are omitted, the object will be placed at "[0, 0]".

       For images, $scale_x and $scale_y represent the width and height of the image on the page in points.   If
       $scale_x  is  omitted,  it will default to 72 pixels per inch.  If $scale_y is omitted, the image will be
       scaled proportionally based on the image dimensions.

       For other external objects, the scale is a multiplier, where 1 (the default)  represents  100%  (i.e.  no
       change).

       If  coordinate  transformations  have  been made (see Coordinate Transformations above), the position and
       scale will be relative to the updated coordinates.

       If no coordinate transformations are needed, this method can be called directly from the  PDF::API2::Page
       object instead.

</pre><h4><b>TEXT</b> <b>STATE</b></h4><pre>
       All of the following parameters that take a size are applied before any scaling takes place, so you don't
       need to adjust values to counteract scaling.

   <b>font</b>
           $content = $content-&gt;font($font, $size);

       Sets  the  font and font size.  $font is an object created by calling "font" in PDF::API2 to add the font
       to the document.

           my $pdf = PDF::API2-&gt;new();
           my $page = $pdf-&gt;page();
           my $text = $page-&gt;text();

           my $font = $pdf-&gt;font('Helvetica');
           $text-&gt;font($font, 24);
           $text-&gt;position(72, 720);
           $text-&gt;text('Hello, World!');

           $pdf-&gt;save('sample.pdf');

   <b>character_spacing</b>
           $spacing = $content-&gt;character_spacing($spacing);

       Sets the spacing between characters.  This is initially zero.

   <b>word_spacing</b>
           $spacing = $content-&gt;word_spacing($spacing);

       Sets the spacing between words.  This is initially zero (i.e. just the width of the space).

       Word spacing might only affect simple fonts and composite fonts where the space character  is  a  single-
       byte code.  This is a limitation of the PDF specification at least as of version 1.7 (see section 9.3.3).
       It's  possible  that  a  later  version  of the specification will support word spacing in fonts that use
       multi-byte codes.

   <b>hscale</b>
           $scale = $content-&gt;hscale($scale);

       Sets/gets the percentage of horizontal text scaling.  Enter a scale greater than  100  to  stretch  text,
       less than 100 to squeeze text, or 100 to disable any existing scaling.

   <b>leading</b>
           $leading = $content-&gt;leading($leading);

       Sets/gets  the  text  leading, which is the distance between baselines.  This is initially zero (i.e. the
       lines will be printed on top of each other).

   <b>render</b>
           $mode = $content-&gt;render($mode);

       Sets the text rendering mode.

       •   0 = Fill text

       •   1 = Stroke text (outline)

       •   2 = Fill, then stroke text

       •   3 = Neither fill nor stroke text (invisible)

       •   4 = Fill text and add to path for clipping

       •   5 = Stroke text and add to path for clipping

       •   6 = Fill, then stroke text and add to path for clipping

       •   7 = Add text to path for clipping

   <b>rise</b>
           $distance = $content-&gt;rise($distance);

       Adjusts the baseline up or down from its current location.  This is initially zero.

       Use this to create superscripts or subscripts (usually with an adjustment to the font size as well).

</pre><h4><b>TEXT</b> <b>PLACEMENT</b></h4><pre>
   <b>position</b>
           # Set
           $content = $content-&gt;position($x, $y);

           # Get
           ($x, $y) = $content-&gt;position();

       If called with arguments, moves to the start of the current line of text, offset by $x and $y.

       If called without arguments, returns the current position of  the  cursor  (before  the  effects  of  any
       coordinate transformation methods).

   <b>crlf</b>
           $content = $content-&gt;crlf();

       Moves to the start of the next line, based on the "leading" setting.

       If leading isn't set, a default distance of 120% of the font size will be used.

   <b>text</b>
           my $width = $content-&gt;text($text, %options);

       Places text on the page.  Returns the width of the text in points.

       Options:

       •   align

           One  of "left" (default), "center", or "right".  Text will be placed such that it begins, is centered
           on, or ends at the current text position, respectively.

           In each case, the position will then be moved to the end of the text.

       •   indent

           Indents the text by the number of points.

           If "align" is set to anything other than "left", this setting will be ignored.

       •   underline

           Underlines the text.  The value may be one of the following:

           •   auto

               Determines the underline distance from the text based on the font and font size.

           •   $distance

               Manually set the underline distance in points.  A positive distance moves the line downward.

           •   [$distance, $thickness, ...]

               Manually set both the underline distance and line thickness, both in points.

               Repeat these arguments to include multiple underlines.

   <b>text_justified</b>
           my $width = $content-&gt;text_justified($text, $width, %options);

       As "text", filling the specified width by adjusting the space between words.

   <b>paragraph</b>
           # Scalar context
           $overflow_text = $content-&gt;paragraph($text, $width, $height, %options);

           # Array context
           ($overflow, $height) = $content-&gt;paragraph($text, $width, $height, %options);

       Fills the rectangle with as much of the provided text as will fit.

       In array context, returns the remaining text (if any) of the positioned text and the  remaining  (unused)
       height.  In scalar context, returns the remaining text (if any).

       Line spacing follows "leading", if set, or 120% of the font size by default.

       <b>Options</b>

       •   align

           Specifies the alignment for each line of text.  May be set to "left" (default), "center", "right", or
           "justified".

       •   align-last

           Specifies  the  alignment  for  the  last  line  of  justified text.  May be set to "left" (default),
           "center", "right", or "justified".

       •   underline

           As described in "text".

   <b>text_width</b>
           my $width = $content-&gt;text_width($line, %overrides);

       Returns the width of a line of text based on the current text state attributes.  These can optionally  be
       overridden:

           my $width = $content-&gt;text_width($line,
               font =&gt; $font,
               size =&gt; $size,
               character_spacing =&gt; $spacing,
               word_spacing =&gt; $spacing,
               hscale =&gt; $scale,
           );
