</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       doctools2toc_introduction - DocTools - Tables of Contents

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>doctoc</u>  (short for <u>documentation</u> <u>tables</u> <u>of</u> <u>contents</u>) stands for a set of related, yet different, entities
       which are working together  for  the  easy  creation  and  transformation  of  tables  and  contents  for
       documentation.

       These are

       [1]    A tcl based language for the semantic markup of a table of contents.  Markup is represented by Tcl
              commands.  Beginners should start with the <u>doctoc</u> <u>language</u> <u>introduction</u>.  The formal specification
              is  split  over  two  documents,  one  dealing with the <u>doctoc</u> <u>language</u> <u>syntax</u>, the other a <u>doctoc</u>
              <u>language</u> <u>command</u> <u>reference</u>.

       [2]    A set of packages for the programmatic manipulation of tables of contents  in  memory,  and  their
              conversion between various formats, reading and writing. The aforementioned markup language is one
              of the formats which can be both read from and written to.

       [3]    The  system  for  the conversion of tables of contents is based on a plugin mechanism, for this we
              have two APIs describing the interface between the packages above and the import/export plugins.

       Which of the more detailed documents are relevant to the reader of this  introduction  depends  on  their
       role in the documentation process.

       [1]    A  <u>writer</u>  of  documentation  has  to  understand the markup language itself. A beginner to doctoc
              should read the more informally written <u>doctoc</u> <u>language</u> <u>introduction</u> first. Having  digested  this
              the formal <u>doctoc</u> <u>language</u> <u>syntax</u> specification should become understandable. A writer experienced
              with  doctoc  may only need the <u>doctoc</u> <u>language</u> <u>command</u> <u>reference</u> from time to time to refresh her
              memory.

              While a document is written the <b>dtp</b> application can be used to validate it, and  after  completion
              it  also performs the conversion into the chosen system of visual markup, be it *roff, HTML, plain
              text, wiki, etc. The simpler <b>dtplite</b> application  makes  internal  use  of  doctoc  when  handling
              directories of documentation, automatically generating a proper table of contents for them.

       [2]    A  <u>processor</u>  of  documentation  written in the <u>doctoc</u> markup language has to know which tools are
              available for use.

              The main tool is the aforementioned <b>dtp</b> application provided by Tcllib. The simpler  <b>dtplite</b>  does
              not  expose  doctoc to the user. At the bottom level, common to both applications, however we find
              the three packages providing the basic facilities to handle tables of contents, i.e.  import  from
              textual formats, programmatic manipulation in memory, and export to textual formats. These are

              <b>doctoools::toc</b>
                     Programmatic manipulation of tables of contents in memory.

              <b>doctoools::toc::import</b>
                     Import  of tables of contents from various textual formats. The set of supported formats is
                     extensible through plugin packages.

              <b>doctoools::toc::export</b>
                     Export of tables of contents to various textual formats. The set of  supported  formats  is
                     extensible through plugin packages.

              See  also  section  <b>Package</b>  <b>Overview</b> for an overview of the dependencies between these and other,
              supporting packages.

       [3]    At last, but not least, <u>plugin</u> <u>writers</u> have to understand the interaction between the  import  and
              export  packages  and  their  plugins.   These APIs are described in the documentation for the two
              relevant packages, i.e.

              •      <b>doctoools::toc::import</b>

              •      <b>doctoools::toc::export</b>

</pre><h4><b>RELATED</b> <b>FORMATS</b></h4><pre>
       The doctoc format does not stand alone, it has two  companion  formats.   These  are  called  <u>docidx</u>  and
       <u>doctools</u>,  and  they  are  intended  for  the  markup  of  <u>keyword</u> <u>indices</u>, and of general documentation,
       respectively.  They are described in their own sets of documents, starting  at  the  <u>DocTools</u>  <u>-</u>  <u>Keyword</u>
       <u>Indices</u> and the <u>DocTools</u> <u>-</u> <u>General</u>, respectively.
