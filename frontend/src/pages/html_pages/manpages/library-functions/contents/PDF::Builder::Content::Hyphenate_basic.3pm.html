       PDF::Builder::Content::Hyphenate_basic - Simple hyphenation capability

       Inherits from PDF::Builder::Content::Text

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       These are internal routines that are somewhat experimental, and may (or may not) be extended in the
       future. They are called from various Content routines that take long strings of text and split them into
       fixed-length lines.

       Words are split to fill the line most completely, without regard to widows and orphans, long runs of
       hyphens at the right edge, "rivers" of space flowing through a paragraph, and other problems. Also, only
       simple splitting is done (not actually <u>words</u>), on a simple, language-independent basis. No dictionary or
       rules-based splitting is currently done.

       This functionality may well be replaced by "hooks" to call language-specific word-splitting rules, as
       well as worrying about the appearance of the results (such as Knuth-Plass).
