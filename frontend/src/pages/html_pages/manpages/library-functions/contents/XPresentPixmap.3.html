       XPresentPixmap - provide pixmap for presentation as window contents

</pre><h4><b>SYNTAX</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;X11/extensions/Xpresent.h&gt;

       void XPresentPixmap (Display *<u>display</u>,
            Window <u>window</u>,
            Pixmap <u>pixmap</u>,
            uint32_t <u>serial</u>,
            XserverRegion <u>valid</u>,
            XserverRegion <u>update</u>,
            int <u>x_off</u>,
            int <u>y_off</u>,
            RRCrtc <u>target_crtc</u>,
            XSyncFence <u>wait_fence</u>,
            XSyncFence <u>idle_fence</u>,
            uint32_t <u>options</u>,
            uint64_t <u>target_msc</u>,
            uint64_t <u>divisor</u>,
            uint64_t <u>remainder</u>,
            XPresentNotify <u>*notifies</u>,
            int <u>nnotifies</u>);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>XPresentPixmap</b> provides new content for the specified <u>window</u>, on the X server specified by <u>display</u>, to be
       made visible at the specified time (defined by <u>target-msc</u>, <u>divisor</u> and <u>remainder</u>). If the depth of <u>pixmap</u>
       and <u>window</u> do not match, a Match error will be generated.

       <u>serial</u>   is   an   arbitrary   client-specified   value   which   will  be  returned  in  the  associated
       <b>PresentCompleteNotify</b> event so that the client can associate the event and request.

       <u>valid-area</u> defines the portion of <u>pixmap</u> which contains valid window contents,  or  None  if  the  pixmap
       contains valid contents for the whole window.

       <u>update-area</u> defines the subset of the window to be updated, or None if the whole window is to be updated.

       <b>XPresentPixmap</b>  may  use any region of <u>pixmap</u> which contains <u>update-area</u> and which is contained by <u>valid-</u>
       <u>area</u>. In other words, areas inside <u>update-area</u> will be presented from <u>pixmap</u>,  areas  outside  <u>valid-area</u>
       will  not  be presented from <u>pixmap</u> and areas inside <u>valid-area</u> but outside <u>update-area</u> may or may not be
       presented at the discretion of the X server.

       <u>x-off</u> and <u>y-off</u> define the location in the window where the 0,0 location of the pixmap will be presented.
       <u>valid-area</u> and <u>update-area</u> are relative to the pixmap.

       <u>wait-fence</u>  and  <u>idle-fence</u>  are  fences  from  the  XSync  extension,  which   may   be   created   with
       <b>XSyncCreateFence</b>().

       The  X  server  will  block the presentation action until <u>wait-fence</u> is triggered, but the <b>XPresentPixmap</b>
       function returns immediately.

       When the X server has finished using <u>pixmap</u> for this operation, it will send  a  <b>PresentIdleNotify</b>  event
       and  arrange  for  any  <u>idle-fence</u>  to  be triggered. This may be at any time following the <b>PresentPixmap</b>
       request -- the contents may be immediately copied to another buffer, copied just in time for  the  vblank
       interrupt or the pixmap may be used directly for display (in which case it will be busy until some future
       <b>PresentPixmap</b> operation).

       If <u>idle-fence</u> is not None, then the client guarantees to the X server that it will wait for that fence to
       be  signalled  before it uses the pixmap again. If <u>idle-fence</u> is None, then the X server must arrange for
       the pixmap to be re-usable by the client as soon as the <b>PresentIdleNotify</b> event has been  received.  Note
       that  if <b>PresentCapabilityFence</b> is set for the associated CRTC, then clients should use fences to improve
       overall system performance. If <b>PresentCapabilityFence</b> is not set, then using fences  offers  no  benefit,
       but also no cost.

       If  <u>target-msc</u>  is greater than the current msc for <u>window</u>, the presentation will occur at (or after) the
       <u>target-msc</u> field. Otherwise, the presentation will occur after the next field  where  msc  %  <u>divisor</u>  ==
       <u>remainder</u>.

       If <u>target-crtc</u> is None, then the X server will choose a suitable CRTC for synchronization.

       If  <u>options</u>  contains  <b>PresentOptionAsync</b>,  and the <u>target-msc</u> is less than or equal to the current Media
       Stream Counter (msc) for <u>window</u>,  then  the  operation  will  be  performed  as  soon  as  possible,  not
       necessarily waiting for the next vertical blank interval.

       If  <u>options</u> contains <b>PresentOptionCopy</b>, then <u>pixmap</u> will be idle, and <u>idle-fence</u> triggered as soon as the
       operation occurs.  If <u>options</u> contains <b>PresentOptionUST</b>, then <u>target-msc</u>, <u>divisor</u>, and <u>remainder</u> will all
       be interpreted as UST values instead of MSC values and  the  frame  update  will  be  scheduled  for  the
       specified UST time, If the <u>target-crtc</u> supports <b>PresentCapabilityUST</b>, then the swap time will be as close
       to  the  target  time  as  the driver can manage. Otherwise, the server will take the target UST time and
       convert it to a suitable target MSC value.

       If  <u>options</u>  contains  <b>PresentOptionSuboptimal</b>,  then  the  <b>PresentCompleteNotify</b>  event  can  have  mode
       <b>PresentCompleteModeSuboptimalCopy</b> as the client supports it.

       After  the presentation occurs, a <b>PresentCompleteNotify</b> event with kind <b>PresentCompleteKindPixmap</b> will be
       generated, both to <u>window</u> as well as all members of <u>notifies</u>.  <u>notifies</u>  is  specified  as  an  array  of
       <b>XPresentNotify</b> structures with <u>nnotifies</u> members in the array.

       If  <u>window</u>  is  destroyed  before  the  presentation  occurs,  then  the  presentation action will not be
       completed.

       The X server holds a reference to <u>pixmap</u> until the presentation occurs,  so  <u>pixmap</u>  may  be  immediately
       freed after the request executes, even if that is before the presentation occurs.

       If  <u>idle-fence</u>  is destroyed before the presentation occurs, then <u>idle-fence</u> will not be signaled but the
       presentation will occur normally.

       If <u>wait-fence</u> is destroyed before it becomes triggered, then the presentation operation  will  no  longer
       wait for it and will occur when the other conditions are satisfied.
