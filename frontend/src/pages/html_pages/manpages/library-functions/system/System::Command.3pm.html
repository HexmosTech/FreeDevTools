           # invoke an external command, and return an object
           $cmd = System::Command-&gt;new( @cmd );

           }

           # done!
           $cmd-&gt;close();

           # exit information
           $cmd-&gt;exit();      # exit status
           $cmd-&gt;signal();    # signal
           $cmd-&gt;core();      # core dumped? (boolean)

           # cut to the chase
           my ( $pid, $in, $out, $err ) = System::Command-&gt;spawn(@cmd);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       System::Command is a class that launches external system commands and return an object representing them,
       allowing to interact with them through their "STDIN", "STDOUT" and "STDERR" handles.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       System::Command supports the following methods:

   <b>new</b>
           my $cmd = System::Command-&gt;new( @cmd )

       Runs an external command using the list in @cmd.

       If @cmd contains a hash reference, it is taken as an <u>option</u> hash.

       If several option hashes are passed to "new()", they will be merged together with individual values being
       overridden by those (with the same key) from hashes that appear later in the list.

       To allow subclasses to support their own set of options, unrecognized options are silently ignored.

       The recognized keys are:

       "cwd"
           The <u>current</u> <u>working</u> <u>directory</u> in which the command will be run.

       "env"
           A hashref containing key / values to add to the command environment.

           If  several  option  hashes  define  the  "env" key, the hashes they point to will be merged into one
           (instead of the last one taking precedence).

           If a value is "undef", the variable corresponding to the key will be <u>removed</u> from the environment.

       "input"
           A string that is send to the command's standard input, which is then closed.

           Using the empty string as "input" will close the command's standard input without writing to it.

           Using "undef" as "input" will not do anything. This behaviour  provides  a  way  to  modify  previous
           options populated by some other part of the program.

           On  some  systems, some commands may close standard input on startup, which will cause a SIGPIPE when
           trying to write to it. This will raise an exception.

       "interactive"
           If true, the command will actually be run using the "system" in perlfunc builtin. If "STDIN" is not a
           terminal, the constructor will die.

           Not reaper object will be created, and the "stdin", "stdout" and "stderr" filehandles will  point  to
           dummy closed handles. The "exit", "signal" and "core" attributes will be correctly set.

           (Added in version 1.114.)

       "setpgrp"
           By  default,  the spawned process is made the leader of its own process group using "setpgrp( 0, 0 )"
           (if possible). This enables sending a signal to the command and all its child processes at once:

               # negative signal is sent to the process group
               kill -SIGKILL, $cmd-&gt;pid;

           Setting the "setpgrp" option to a false value disables this behaviour.

           (Added in version 1.110.)

       "trace"
           The "trace" option defines  the  trace  settings  for  System::Command.   The  "SYSTEM_COMMAND_TRACE"
           environment  variable  can  be  used  to  specify  a global trace setting at startup. The environment
           variable overrides individual "trace" options.

           If "trace" or "SYSTEM_COMMAND_TRACE" contains an "=" character then what follows it is  used  as  the
           name  of the file to append the trace to.  When using the "trace" option, it is recommended to use an
           absolute path for the trace file, in case the main program "chdir()" before calling System::Command.

           At trace level 1, only the command line is shown:

               System::Command cmd[12834]: <a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?git">/usr/bin/git</a> commit -m "Test option hash in new()"

           Note: Command-line parameters containing whitespace will be properly quoted.

           At trace level 2, the options values are shown:

               System::Command opt[12834]: cwd =&gt; "/tmp/kHkPUBIVWd"
               System::Command opt[12834]: fatal =&gt; {128 =&gt; 1,129 =&gt; 1}
               System::Command opt[12834]: git =&gt; "<a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?git">/usr/bin/git</a>"

           Note: The "fatal" and "git" options in the example above are  actually  used  by  Git::Repository  to
           determine  the  command  to  be  run,  and  ignored  by  System::Command. References are dumped using
           Data::Dumper.

           At trace level 3, the content of the "env" option is also listed:

               System::Command env[12834]: GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL =&gt; "author\@example.com"
               System::Command env[12834]: GIT_AUTHOR_NAME =&gt; "Example author"

           If the command cannot be spawned, the trace will show "!" instead of the pid:

               System::Command cmd[!]: does-not-exist

           (Added in version 1.108.)

       exit
       core
       signal
           The above three options can be set to point to a reference to a scalar, which will  be  automatically
           updated  when  the  command  is  terminated.  See  the "Accessors" section for details about what the
           attributes of the same name mean.

           (Added in version 1.114.)

       The System::Command object returned by "new()" has a number of attributes defined (see below).

   <b>close</b>
           $cmd-&gt;close;

       Close all pipes to the child process, collects exit status, etc.  and defines a number of attributes (see
       below).

       Returns the invocant, so one can do things like:

           my $exit = $cmd-&gt;close-&gt;exit;

   <b>is_terminated</b>
           if ( $cmd-&gt;is_terminated ) {...}

       Returns a true value if the underlying process was terminated.

       If the process was indeed terminated, collects exit status, etc.  and  defines  the  same  attributes  as
       "close()", but does <b>not</b> close all pipes to the child process.

   <b>spawn</b>
           my ( $pid, $in, $out, $err ) = System::Command-&gt;spawn(@cmd);

       This  shortcut  method calls "new()" (and so accepts options in the same manner) and directly returns the
       "pid", "stdin", "stdout" and "stderr" attributes, in that order.

       (Added in version 1.01.)

   <b>loop_on</b>
           $cmd-&gt;loop_on(
               stdout =&gt; sub { ... },
               stderr =&gt; sub { ... },
           );

       This method calls the corresponding code references with each line produced on the  standard  output  and
       errput of the command.

       If the "stdout" or "stderr" argument is not given, the default is to silently drop the data for "stdout",
       and  to  pass through (to STDERR) the data for "stderr". To prevent any processing, pass a false value to
       the parameter.

       For example, the following line will silently run the command to completion:

           $cmd-&gt;loop_on( stderr =&gt; '' );

       The method blocks until the command is completed (or rather, until its output  and  errput  handles  have
       been closed), or until one of the callbacks returns a false value.

       Data  is  read  using  readline,  which depends on $/ for its definition of a "line". To that effect, the
       method takes a third optional argument, "input_record_separator", which sets the value  for  $/  for  the
       duration of the call.

       <u>Caveat</u>  <u>Emptor</u>:  since  "loop_on" is line-based, it may <b>block</b> if either output or errput sends incomplete
       lines (e.g. if the command is some sort of interactive shell with a prompt).

       The return value is true if the command exited  with  status  0,  and  false  otherwise  (i.e.  the  Unix
       traditional definition of success).

       (Added in version 1.117.)

   <b>Accessors</b>
       The attributes of a System::Command object are also accessible through a number of accessors.

       The object returned by "new()" will have the following attributes defined:

       cmdline
           Return the command-line actually executed, as a list of strings.

       options
           The merged list of options used to run the command.

       pid The PID of the underlying command.

       stdin
           A filehandle opened in write mode to the child process' standard input.

       stdout
           A filehandle opened in read mode to the child process' standard output.

       stderr
           A filehandle opened in read mode to the child process' standard error output.

       Regarding the handles to the child process, note that in the following code:

           my $fh = System::Command-&gt;new( @cmd )-&gt;stdout;

       $fh  is  opened and points to the output handle of the child process, while the anonymous System::Command
       object has been destroyed. Once $fh is destroyed, the subprocess will be reaped, thus  avoiding  zombies.
       (System::Command::Reaper undertakes this process.)

       After  the  call  to  "close()" or after "is_terminated()" returns true, the following attributes will be
       defined (note that the accessors always run "is_terminated()", to improve their chance of getting a value
       if the process just finished):

       exit
           The exit status of the underlying command.

       signal
           The signal, if any, that killed the command.

       core
           A boolean value indicating if the command dumped core.

       Even when not having a reference to the System::Command object any more, it's still possible to  get  the
       "exit", "core" or "signal" values, using the options of the same name:

           my $fh = System::Command-&gt;new( @cmd, { exit =&gt; \my $exit } )-&gt;stdout;

       Once  the  command is terminated, the $exit variable will contain the value that would have been returned
       by the "exit()" method.

</pre><h4><b>CAVEAT</b> <b>EMPTOR</b></h4><pre>
       Note that System::Command uses "waitpid()" to catch the status information  of  the  child  processes  it
       starts. This means that if your code (or any module you "use") does something like the following:

           local $SIG{CHLD} = 'IGNORE';    # reap child processes

       System::Command  will  not be able to capture the "exit", "signal" and "core" attributes. It will instead
       set all of them to the impossible value "-1", and display the  warning  "Child  process  already  reaped,
       check for a SIGCHLD handler".

       To silence this warning (and accept the impossible status information), load System::Command with:

           use System::Command -quiet;

       It  is  also  possible to more finely control the warning by setting the $System::Command::QUIET variable
       (the warning is not emitted if the variable is set to a true value).

       If the subprocess started by System::Command has a short life expectancy, and no other child  process  is
       expected to die during that time, you could even disable the handler locally (use at your own risks):

           {
               local $SIG{CHLD};
               my $cmd = System::Command-&gt;new(@cmd);
               ...
           }

       Philippe Bruhat (BooK), "&lt;book at cpan.org&gt;"

</pre><h4><b>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Thanks  to Alexis Sukrieh (SUKRIA) who, when he saw the description of Git::Repository::Command during my
       talk at OSDC.fr 2010, asked why it was not an independent module. This module was started by  taking  out
       of Git::Repository::Command 1.08 the parts that weren't related to Git.

       Thanks to Christian Walde (MITHALDU) for his help in making this module work better under Win32.

       The  System::Command::Reaper  class  was  added after the addition of Git::Repository::Command::Reaper in
       Git::Repository::Command 1.11.  It was later removed from System::Command version 1.03, and brought  back
       from the dead to deal with the zombie apocalypse in version 1.106.  The idea of a reaper class comes from
       Vincent Pit.

       Thanks  to  Tim  Bunce  for using Git::Repository and making many suggestions based on his use and needs.
       Most of them turned into improvement for System::Command instead, once  we  figured  out  that  the  more
       general feature idea really belonged there.
