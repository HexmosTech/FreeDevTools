</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       strictures - Turn on strict and make most warnings fatal

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use strictures 2;

       is equivalent to

         use strict;
         use warnings FATAL =&gt; 'all';
         use warnings NONFATAL =&gt; qw(
           exec
           recursion
           internal
           malloc
           newline
           experimental
           deprecated
           portable
         );
         no warnings 'once';

       except when called from a file which matches:

         (caller)[1] =~ /^(?:t|xt|lib|blib)[\\\/]/

       and when either ".git", ".svn", ".hg", or ".bzr" is present in the current directory (with the intention
       of only forcing extra tests on the author side) -- or when ".git", ".svn", ".hg", or ".bzr" is present
       two directories up along with "dist.ini" (which would indicate we are in a "dzil test" operation, via
       Dist::Zilla) -- or when the "PERL_STRICTURES_EXTRA" environment variable is set, in which case it also
       does the equivalent of

         no indirect 'fatal';
         no multidimensional;
         no bareword::filehandles;

       Note that "PERL_STRICTURES_EXTRA" may at some point add even more tests, with only a minor version
       increase, but any changes to the effect of "use strictures" in normal mode will involve a major version
       bump.

       If any of the extra testing modules are not present, strictures will complain loudly, once, via "warn()",
       and then shut up. But you really should consider installing them, they're all great anti-footgun tools.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       I've been writing the equivalent of this module at the top of my code for about a year now. I figured it
       was time to make it shorter.

       Things like the importer in "use Moose" don't help me because they turn warnings on but don't make them
       fatal -- which from my point of view is useless because I want an exception to tell me my code isn't
       warnings-clean.

       Any time I see a warning from my code, that indicates a mistake.

       Any time my code encounters a mistake, I want a crash -- not spew to STDERR and then unknown (and
       probably undesired) subsequent behaviour.

       I also want to ensure that obvious coding mistakes, like indirect object syntax (and not so obvious
       mistakes that cause things to accidentally compile as such) get caught, but not at the cost of an XS
       dependency and not at the cost of blowing things up on another machine.

       Therefore, strictures turns on additional checking, but only when it thinks it's running in a test file
       in a VCS checkout -- although if this causes undesired behaviour this can be overridden by setting the
       "PERL_STRICTURES_EXTRA" environment variable.

       If additional useful author side checks come to mind, I'll add them to the "PERL_STRICTURES_EXTRA" code
       path only -- this will result in a minor version increase (e.g. 1.000000 to 1.001000 (1.1.0) or similar).
       Any fixes only to the mechanism of this code will result in a sub-version increase (e.g. 1.000000 to
       1.000001 (1.0.1)).

</pre><h4><b>CATEGORY</b> <b>SELECTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       strictures does not enable fatal warnings for all categories.

       exec
           Includes  a warning that can cause your program to continue running unintentionally after an internal
           fork.  Not safe to fatalize.

       recursion
           Infinite recursion will end up overflowing the stack eventually anyway.

       internal
           Triggers deep within perl, in places that are not safe to trap.

       malloc
           Triggers deep within perl, in places that are not safe to trap.

       newline
           Includes a warning for using stat on a valid but suspect filename, ending in a newline.

       experimental
           Experimental features are used intentionally.

       deprecated
           Deprecations will inherently be added to in the future in unexpected ways, so making them fatal won't
           be reliable.

       portable
           Doesn't indicate an actual problem with the program, only that it may not behave properly if run on a
           different machine.

       once
           Can't be fatalized.  Also triggers very inconsistently, so we just disable it.

</pre><h4><b>VERSIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Depending on the version of strictures requested, different warnings will be  enabled.   If  no  specific
       version  is  requested,  the  current  version's  behavior will be used.  Versions can be requested using
       perl's standard mechanism:

         use strictures 2;

       Or, by passing in a "version" option:

         use strictures version =&gt; 2;

   <b>VERSION</b> <b>2</b>
       Equivalent to:

         use strict;
         use warnings FATAL =&gt; 'all';
         use warnings NONFATAL =&gt; qw(
           exec
           recursion
           internal
           malloc
           newline
           experimental
           deprecated
           portable
         );
         no warnings 'once';

         # and if in dev mode:
         no indirect 'fatal';
         no multidimensional;
         no bareword::filehandles;

       Additionally,     any     warnings     created     by     modules     using     warnings::register     or
       "warnings::register_categories()" will not be fatalized.

   <b>VERSION</b> <b>1</b>
       Equivalent to:

         use strict;
         use warnings FATAL =&gt; 'all';
         # and if in dev mode:
         no indirect 'fatal';
         no multidimensional;
         no bareword::filehandles;

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>import</b>
       This  method does the setup work described above in "DESCRIPTION".  Optionally accepts a "version" option
       to request a specific version's behavior.

   <b>VERSION</b>
       This method traps the "strictures-&gt;<a href="../man1/VERSION.1.html">VERSION</a>(1)" call produced by a use line with a version  number  on  it
       and does the version check.

</pre><h4><b>EXTRA</b> <b>TESTING</b> <b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       Every  so  often,  somebody  complains  that  they're  deploying  via "git pull" and that they don't want
       strictures to enable itself in  this  case  --  and  that  setting  "PERL_STRICTURES_EXTRA"  to  0  isn't
       acceptable  (additional  ways to disable extra testing would be welcome but the discussion never seems to
       get that far).

       In order to allow us to skip a couple of stages and get straight to a productive conversation, here's  my
       current rationale for turning the extra testing on via a heuristic:

       The  extra testing is all stuff that only ever blows up at compile time; this is intentional. So the oft-
       raised concern that it's different code being tested is only sort of the case  --  none  of  the  modules
       involved affect the final optree to my knowledge, so the author gets some additional compile time crashes
       which he/she then fixes, and the rest of the testing is completely valid for all environments.

       The  point  of  the  extra  testing -- especially "no indirect" -- is to catch mistakes that newbie users
       won't even realise are mistakes without help. For example,

         foo { ... };

       where foo is an &amp; prototyped sub that you forgot to import -- this is pernicious to track down since  all
       <u>seems</u> fine until it gets called and you get a crash. Worse still, you can fail to have imported it due to
       a  circular  require,  at which point you have a load order dependent bug which I've seen before now <u>only</u>
       show up in production due to tiny differences between the production and the development  environment.  I
       wrote  &lt;<a href="http://shadow.cat/blog/matt-s-trout/indirect-but-still-fatal/">http://shadow.cat/blog/matt-s-trout/indirect-but-still-fatal/</a>&gt; to explain this particular problem
       before strictures itself existed.

       As such, in my experience so far strictures' extra testing  has  <u>avoided</u>  production  versus  development
       differences, not caused them.

       Additionally, strictures' policy is very much "try and provide as much protection as possible for newbies
       --  who  won't think about whether there's an option to turn on or not" -- so having only the environment
       variable is not sufficient to achieve that (I get to explain that you need to add "use strict"  at  least
       once  a  week  on freenode #perl -- newbies sometimes completely skip steps because they don't understand
       that that step is important).

       I make no claims that the heuristic is perfect -- it's already  been  evolved  significantly  over  time,
       especially  for  1.004  where we changed things to ensure it only fires on files in your checkout (rather
       than strictures-using modules you happened to have installed, which was just silly). However, I hope  the
       above  clarifies  why  a  heuristic  approach is not only necessary but desirable from a point of view of
       providing new users with as much safety as possible, and will allow any future discussion on the  subject
       to focus on "how do we minimise annoyance to people deploying from checkouts intentionally".
