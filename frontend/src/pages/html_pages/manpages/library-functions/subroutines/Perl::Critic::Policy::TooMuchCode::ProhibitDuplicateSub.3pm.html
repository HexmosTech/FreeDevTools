       TooMuchCode::ProhibitDuplicateSub - When 2 subroutines are defined with the same name, report the first
       one.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This policy checks if there are subroutine definitions with identical names under the same namespace. If
       they exists, all but the last one are marked as violation.

       perl runtime allows a named subroutine to be redefined in the same source file and the latest definition
       wins. In the event that this is done by developers, preferably unintentionally, perl runtime warns about
       a subroutine is redefined with the position is for the one that wins. This policy does the opposite.

       Although the last one is not marked as a violation, it's position is reported together. Making it easier
       for developer to locate the subroutine.

       Should the developer decide to programmatically remove the duplicates, simply go through all the
       violations and remove those statements.
