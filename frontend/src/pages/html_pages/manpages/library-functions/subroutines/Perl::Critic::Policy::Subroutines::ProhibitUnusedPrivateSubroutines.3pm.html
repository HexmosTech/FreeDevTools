</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Perl::Critic::Policy::Subroutines::ProhibitUnusedPrivateSubroutines - Prevent unused private subroutines.

</pre><h4><b>AFFILIATION</b></h4><pre>
       This Policy is part of the core Perl::Critic distribution.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       By convention Perl authors (like authors in many other languages) indicate private methods and variables
       by inserting a leading underscore before the identifier.  This policy catches such subroutines which are
       not used in the file which declares them.

       This module defines a 'use' of a subroutine as a subroutine or method call to it (other than from inside
       the subroutine itself), a reference to it (i.e.  "my $foo = \&amp;_foo"), a "goto" to it outside the
       subroutine itself (i.e.  "goto &amp;_foo"), or the use of the subroutine's name as an even-numbered argument
       to "use overload".

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       You can define what a private subroutine name looks like by specifying a regular expression for the
       "private_name_regex" option in your <u>.perlcriticrc</u>:

           [Subroutines::ProhibitUnusedPrivateSubroutines]
           private_name_regex = _(?!_)\w+

       The above example is a way of saying that subroutines that start with a double underscore are not
       considered to be private.  (Perl::Critic, in its implementation, uses leading double underscores to
       indicate a distribution-private subroutine -- one that is allowed to be invoked by other Perl::Critic
       modules, but not by anything outside of Perl::Critic.)

       You can configure additional subroutines to accept by specifying them in a space-delimited list to the
       "allow" option:

           [Subroutines::ProhibitUnusedPrivateSubroutines]
           allow = _bar _baz

       These are added to the default list of exemptions from this policy. So the above allows "sub _bar {}" and
       "sub _baz {}", even if they are not referred to in the module that defines them.

       You can allow a whole class or subroutine names by defining a regular expression that matches allowed
       names.

           [Subroutines::ProhibitUnusedPrivateSubroutines]
           allow_name_regex = _build_\w+

       You can configure this policy not to check private subroutines declared in a file that uses one or more
       particular named modules.  This allows you to, for example, exclude unused private subroutine checking in
       classes that are roles.

           [Subroutines::ProhibitUnusedPrivateSubroutines]
           skip_when_using = Moose::Role Moo::Role Role::Tiny

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       This policy is derived from Perl::Critic::Policy::Subroutines::ProtectPrivateSubs, which looks at the
       other side of the problem.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Does not forbid "sub Foo::_foo{}" because it does not know (and can not assume) what is in the "Foo"
       package.

       Does not respect the scope caused by multiple packages in the same file.  For example a file:

           package Foo;
           sub _is_private { print "A private sub!"; }

           package Bar;
           _is_private();

       Will not trigger a violation even though "Foo::_is_private" is not called.  Similarly, "skip_when_using"
       currently works on a <u>file</u> level, not on a <u>package</u> <u>scope</u> level.
