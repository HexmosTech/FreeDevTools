</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Spreadsheet::WriteExcel::Simple - A simple single-sheet Excel document

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         my $ss = Spreadsheet::WriteExcel::Simple-&gt;new;
            $ss-&gt;write_bold_row(\@headings);
            $ss-&gt;write_row(\@data);

         print $ss-&gt;data;
               # or
               $ss-&gt;save("filename.xls");

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This provides an abstraction to the Spreadsheet::WriteExcel module for easier creation of simple single-
       sheet Excel documents.

       In its most basic form it provides two methods for writing data: write_row and write_bold_row which write
       the data supplied to the next row of the spreadsheet.

       However, you can also use $ss-&gt;book and $ss-&gt;sheet to get at the underlying workbook and worksheet from
       Spreadsheet::WriteExcel if you wish to manipulate these directly.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>new</b>
         my $ss = Spreadsheet::WriteExcel::Simple-&gt;new;

       Create a new single-sheet Excel document. You should not supply this a filename or filehandle. The data
       is stored internally, and can be retrieved later through the 'data' method or saved using the 'save'
       method.

   <b>write_row</b> <b>/</b> <b>write_bold_row</b>
         $ss-&gt;write_bold_row(\@headings);
         $ss-&gt;write_row(\@data);

       These write the list of data into the next row of the spreadsheet.

       Caveat: An internal counter is kept as to which row is being written to, so if you mix these functions
       with direct writes of your own, these functions will continue where they left off, not where you have
       written to.

   <b>data</b>
         print $ss-&gt;data;

       This returns the data of the spreadsheet. If you're planning to print this to a web-browser, be sure to
       print an 'application/excel' header first.

   <b>book</b> <b>/</b> <b>sheet</b>
         my $workbook  = $ss-&gt;book;
         my $worksheet = $ss-&gt;sheet;

       These return the underlying Spreadsheet::WriteExcel objects representing the workbook and worksheet
       respectively. If you find yourself making more that a trivial amount of use of these, you probably
       shouldn't be using this module, but using Spreadsheet::WriteExcel directly.

   <b>save</b>
               $ss-&gt;save("filename.xls");

       Save the spreadsheet with the given filename.
