       Connector, ConnectorView - base classes for connector subjects and views

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;Unidraw/Components/connector.h&gt;</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Connector  is an abstract base class for graphical component subjects that enforce different connectivity
       semantics depending on the particular connector subclass.  ConnectorView is the abstract base  class  for
       views  of  connector  subjects.   A  connector  can  be  connected to one or more other connectors.  Once
       connected, two connectors can affect each other's position in specific ways as defined by  the  semantics
       of the connection.

       Connectors  also  participate in the propagation of state variable values during dataflow.  Two connected
       connectors with bound state variables will assign the value of one  state  variable  to  other,  and  the
       direction  of  transfer depends on the connectors' transmission method.  For example, if the transmission
       method of connector C1 with bound state variable S1 is In, and if the transmission method of connector C2
       with bound state variable S2 is Out, and if C1 and C2 are connected, then S1 will be assigned  the  value
       of S2 during dataflow.

</pre><h4><b>CONNECTOR</b> <b>PUBLIC</b> <b>OPERATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>virtual</b> <b>void</b> <b>Interpret(Command*)</b>
       <b>virtual</b> <b>void</b> <b>Uninterpret(Command*)</b>
              In   addition  to  (un)interpreting  the  commands  GraphicComp  (un)interprets,  connectors  also
              (un)interpret DeleteCmd and CutCmd to sever and restore any connections to them.

       <b>virtual</b> <b>void</b> <b>Connect(Connector*,</b> <b>CGlue*</b> <b>=</b> <b>nil);</b>
              Connect this connector to the given one, optionally  with  a  piece  of  CGlue  interposed.   This
              operation allows redundant connections by default.

       <b>virtual</b> <b>void</b> <b>Disconnect(Connector*)</b>
       <b>void</b> <b>DisconnectAll()</b>
              Disconnect  the  given  connector  from  this  one,  if  they  are connected.  DisconnectAll calls
              Disconnect on all connected connectors until no connections remain.

       <b>virtual</b> <b>boolean</b> <b>ConnectedTo(Connector*)</b>
              Return whether this connector is connected to the given one.

       <b>virtual</b> <b>void</b> <b>GetCenter(float&amp;,</b> <b>float&amp;)</b>
              Return the coordinates of the connector's center, which defines its position.

       <b>virtual</b> <b>void</b> <b>SetBinding(StateVar*)</b>
       <b>virtual</b> <b>StateVar*</b> <b>GetBinding()</b>
              Assign and return the state variable bound to the connector, if any.  Only one state variable  can
              be bound to a connector at a time.

       <b>virtual</b> <b>void</b> <b>SetTransMethod(TransMethod)</b>
       <b>virtual</b> <b>TransMethod</b> <b>GetTransMethod()</b>
              Assign and return the connector's transmission method.

       <b>virtual</b> <b>void</b> <b>Transmit(Path*</b> <b>=</b> <b>nil)</b>
              Initiate dataflow originating from this connector, optionally based on information supplied in the
              given  path  object.   Other  Unidraw  or  application  objects  call this operation whenever data
              modifications should be propagated.

</pre><h4><b>CONNECTOR</b> <b>PROTECTED</b> <b>OPERATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Connector(Graphic*</b> <b>=</b> <b>nil)</b>
              Initialize the connector instance, optionally with a graphic whose center defines the  connector's
              position.

       <b>virtual</b> <b>void</b> <b>ConnectMe(Connector*)</b>
       <b>virtual</b> <b>void</b> <b>DisconnectMe(Connector*)</b>
              Connectors  maintain  a  list  of  the  connectors  to  which they are connected.  The Connect and
              Disconnect  operations  update  this  connector's  list,  while  the  ConnectMe  and  DisconnectMe
              operations inform their argument to update their lists.

       <b>void</b> <b>Retransmit(Path*)</b>
       <b>void</b> <b>Retransmit(Connector*</b> <b>peer,</b> <b>Path*)</b>
       <b>boolean</b> <b>Transferable(Connector*</b> <b>peer)</b>
              The  Transmit  operation  uses  these  operations  to  propagate state variable values.  The first
              Retransmit function calls the second one on each of the connector's peers (i.e., the connectors to
              which it is connected) if the path records that  this  connector  has  not  already  been  visited
              (otherwise  propagation  ceases).   The  first  Retransmit  copies  the path if necessary to avoid
              accumulating visit information from multiple branches.  The second Retransmit calls  Transferable,
              which returns whether the value of this connector's state variable can be transferred to the given
              peer's  state  variable  based  on  the  two  connectors' transmission methods.  If the values are
              transferable, then the Transferable operation carries out  the  assignment  to  the  peer's  state
              variable  as  a side-effect.  The second Retransmit also enables further propagation by evaluating
              the transfer function of the peer's parent and by calling the first Retransmit  operation  on  the
              peer.

</pre><h4><b>CONNECTORVIEW</b> <b>PUBLIC</b> <b>OPERATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Connector*</b> <b>GetConnector()</b>
              Return the view's subject, if any.

</pre><h4><b>CONNECTORVIEW</b> <b>PROTECTED</b> <b>OPERATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ConnectorView(Connector*</b> <b>=</b> <b>nil)</b>
              The  constructor  takes  a  subject  as  an optional argument.  The view will attach itself to the
              subject if one is specified.
