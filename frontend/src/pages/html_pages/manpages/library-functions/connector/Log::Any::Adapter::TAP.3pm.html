</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Log::Any::Adapter::TAP - Logging adapter suitable for use in TAP testcases

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 0.003003

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       When running testcases, you probably want to see some of your logging output.  One sensible approach is
       to have all "warn" and more serious messages emitted as "diag" output on STDERR, and less serious
       messages emitted as "note" comments on STDOUT.

       So, thats what this logging adapter does.  Simply say

         use Log::Any::Adapter 'TAP';

       at the start of your testcase, and now you have your logging output as part of your TAP stream.

       By default, "debug" and "trace" are suppressed, but you can enable them with "TAP_LOG_FILTER" or the
       "filter" attribute.  See below.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
   <b>TAP_LOG_FILTER</b>
       Specify the default filter value.  See attribute "filter" for details.

       You may also specify defaults per-category, using this syntax:

         $default_level,$package_1=$level,...,$package_n=$level

       So, for example:

         TAP_LOG_FILTER=trace,MyPackage=none,NoisyPackage=warn prove -lv

   <b>TAP_LOG_ORIGIN</b>
       Set this variable to 1 to show which category the message came from, or 2 to see the file and line number
       it came from, or 3 to see both.

   <b>TAP_LOG_SHOW_USAGE</b>
       Defaults to true, which prints a TAP comment briefing the user about these environment variables when
       Log::Any::Adapter::TAP is first loaded.

       Set TAP_LOG_SHOW_USAGE=0 to suppress this message.

</pre><h4><b>ATTRIBUTES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>filter</b>
         use Log::Any::Adapter 'TAP', filter =&gt; 'info';
         use Log::Any::Adapter 'TAP', filter =&gt; 'debug+3';

       Messages with a log level equal to or less than the filter are suppressed.

       Defaults to "TAP_LOG_FILTER", or "debug" which suppresses "debug" and "trace" messages.

       Filter may be:

       •   Any of the log level names or level aliases defined in Log::Any.

       •   "none" or "undef", to filter nothing (print all log levels).

       •   A value of "all", to filter everything (print nothing).

       The  filter  level  may  end  with a "+N" or "-N" indicating an offset from the named level.  The numeric
       values increase with importance of the message, so "debug-1" is equivalent to "trace"  and  "debug+1"  is
       equivalent  to  "info".  This differs from syslog, where increasing numbers are less important.  (why did
       they choose that??)

   <b>dumper</b> <b>(DEPRECATED,</b> <b>unusable</b> <b>in</b> <b>Log::Any</b> <b>&gt;=</b> <b>0.9)</b>
         use Log::Any::Adapter 'TAP', dumper =&gt; sub { my $val=shift; ... };

       This feature lets you use a custom dumper in the printf-style logging functions.  However, these  are  no
       longer  handled  by  the  adapter in new versions of Log::Any, so you need to use a custom Proxy class in
       your log-producing module.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>new</b>
       See "new" in Log::Any::Adapter::Base.  Accepts the above attributes.

   <b>write_msg</b>
         $self-&gt;write_msg( $level_name, $message_string )

       This is an internal method which all the other logging methods call.  You can override it if you want  to
       create a derived logger that handles line wrapping differently, or write to different file handles.

   <b>default_dumper</b>
         $dumper= $class-&gt;default_dumper;
         $string = $dumper-&gt;( $perl_data );

       Default value for the 'dumper' attribute.

       This  returns  a  coderef  which  can  dump  a  value in "some human readable format".  Currently it uses
       Data::Dumper with a max depth of 4.  Do not depend on this default; it is only for human consumption, and
       might change to a more friendly format in the future.

</pre><h4><b>LOGGING</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       This module has all the standard logging methods from "LOG LEVELS" in Log::Any.

       Note that the regular logging methods are only specified to take a single string.   This  module  in  the
       past  supported  passing  objects  as  additional  parameters,  and having them stringified with a custom
       dumper, caatching exceptions thrown during stringification.  With the new Log::Any design,  these  things
       are decided in the producing module, so these features are no longer possible.

       If  this module does receive multiple arguments or have its printf-formatting methods called, it does the
       following:

       For regular logging functions (i.e. "warn", "info")  the  arguments  are  stringified  and  concatenated.
       Errors during stringify or printing are not caught.

       For   printf-like   logging   functions  (i.e.  "warnf",  "infof")  reference  arguments  are  passed  to
       "$self-&gt;dumper" before passing them to sprintf.  Errors are not caught here either.

       For any log level below "info", errors ARE caught with an "eval" and printed as a warning.   This  is  to
       prevent  sloppy  debugging  code  from ever crashing a production system.  Also, references are passed to
       "$self-&gt;dumper" even for the regular methods.
