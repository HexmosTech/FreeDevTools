         use Ace::Sequence;
         use Ace::Graphics::Panel;

         my $db     = Ace-&gt;connect(-host=&gt;'brie2.cshl.org',-port=&gt;2005) or die;
         my $cosmid = Ace::Sequence-&gt;new(-seq=&gt;'Y16B4A',

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The Ace::Graphics::Track class is used by Ace::Graphics::Panel to lay out a set of sequence features
       using a uniform glyph type. You will ordinarily work with panels rather than directly with tracks.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       This section describes the class and object methods for Ace::Graphics::Panel.

   <b>CONSTRUCTORS</b>
       There is only one constructor, the <b>new()</b> method.  It is ordinarily called by Ace::Graphics::Panel, and
       not in end-developer code.

       $track = Ace::Graphics::Track-&gt;new($glyph_name,$features,@options)
           The  <b>new()</b>  method creates a new track object from the provided glyph name and list of features.  The
           arguments are similar to those in Ace::Graphics::Panel-&gt;<b>new()</b>.

           If successful <b>new()</b> will return a new Ace::Graphics::Track.  Otherwise, it will return undef.

           If the specified glyph name is not a valid one, <b>new()</b> will throw an exception.

   <b>OBJECT</b> <b>METHODS</b>
       Once a track is created, the following methods can be invoked.

       $track-&gt;add_feature($feature)
           This adds a new feature to the track.  The feature can either be a single object that implements  the
           Bio::SeqFeatureI interface (such as an Ace::Sequence::Feature or Das::Segment::Feature), or can be an
           anonymous  array containing a set of related features.  In the latter case, the track will attempt to
           keep the features in the same horizontal band and will not allow any other features to overlap.

       $track-&gt;add_group($group)
           This behaves the same as <b>add_feature()</b>,  but  requires  that  its  argument  be  an  array  reference
           containing a list of grouped features.

       $track-&gt;draw($gd,$left,$top)
           Render the track on a previously-created GD::Image object.  The $left and $top arguments indicate the
           position at which to start rendering.

       $boxes = $track-&gt;boxes($left,$top)
       @boxes = $track-&gt;boxes($left,$top)
           Return  an  array  of  array references indicating glyph coordinates for each of the render features.
           $left and $top indicate the offset for the track on the image  plane.   In  a  scalar  context,  this
           method  returns  an  array  reference  of  glyph coordinates.  In a list context, it returns the list
           itself.

           See Ace::Graphics::Panel-&gt;<b>boxes()</b> for the format of the result.

   <b>ACCESSORS</b>
       The following accessor methods provide access to various attributes of the track object.  Called with  no
       arguments,  they each return the current value of the attribute.  Called with a single argument, they set
       the attribute and return its previous value.

       Note that in most cases you must change attributes before the track's <b>layout()</b> method is called.

          Accessor Name      Description
          -------------      -----------

          scale()            Get/set the track scale, measured in pixels/bp
          lineheight()       Get/set the height of each glyph, pixels
          width()            Get/set the width of the track
          bump()             Get/set the bump direction

   <b>INTERNAL</b> <b>METHODS</b>
       The following methods are used internally, but may be useful for those implementing new glyph types.

       $glyphs = $track-&gt;layout
           Layout the features, and return an anonymous array of Ace::Graphics::Glyph  objects  that  have  been
           created and correctly positioned.

           Because  layout  is  an  expensive  operation,  calling  this  method  several  times will return the
           previously-cached result, ignoring any changes to track attributes.

       $height = $track-&gt;height
           Invokes <b>layout()</b> and returns the height of the track.

       $glyphs = $track-&gt;glyphs
           Returns the glyph cache.  Returns undef before <b>layout()</b> and a reference to an array of  glyphs  after
           <b>layout()</b>.

       $factory = $track-&gt;make_factory(@options)
           Given  a  set  of  options  (argument/value  pairs), returns a Ace::Graphics::GlyphFactory for use in
           creating the glyphs with the desired settings.
