       Calendar::Simple - Perl extension to create simple calendars

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Calendar::Simple;

         my @curr      = calendar;             # get current month
         my @this_sept = <a href="../man9/calendar.9.html">calendar</a>(9);          # get 9th month of current year
         my @sept_2002 = calendar(9, 2002);    # get 9th month of 2002
         my @monday    = calendar(9, 2002, 1); # get 9th month of 2002,
                                               # weeks start on Monday

         my @span      = date_span(mon   =&gt; 10,  # returns span of dates
                                   year  =&gt; 2006,
                                   begin =&gt; 15,
                                   end   =&gt; 28);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       A very simple module that exports one function called "calendar".

   <b>calendar</b>
       This function returns a data structure representing the dates in a month.  The data structure returned is
       an array of array references. The first level array represents the weeks in the month. The second level
       array contains the actual days. By default, each week starts on a Sunday and the value in the array is
       the date of that day. Any days at the beginning of the first week or the end of the last week that are
       from the previous or next month have the value "undef".

       If the month or year parameters are omitted then the current month or year are assumed.

       A third, optional parameter, start_day, allows you to set the day each week starts with, with the same
       values as localtime sets for wday (namely, 0 for Sunday, 1 for Monday and so on).

   <b>date_span</b>
       This function returns a cut-down version of a month data structure which begins and ends on dates other
       than the first and last dates of the month.  Any weeks that fall completely outside of the date range are
       removed from the structure and any days within the remaining weeks that fall outside of the date range
       are set to "undef".

       As there are a number of parameters to this function, they are passed using a named parameter interface.
       The parameters are as follows:

       year
           The required year. Defaults to the current year if omitted.

       mon The required month. Defaults to the current month if omitted.

       begin
           The first day of the required span. Defaults to the first if omitted.

       end The last day of the required span. Defaults to the last day of the month if omitted.

       start_day
           Indicates  the day of the week that each week starts with. This takes the same values as the optional
           third parameter to "calendar". The default is 1 (for Monday).

           <b>NOTE:</b> As of version 2.0.0, the default "start_day" has changed. Previously, it was Sunday; now, it is
           Monday. This is so the default behaviour matches that of the standard Unix "cal" command.

       This function isn't exported by default, so in order to use it in your program you need to use the module
       like this:

         use Calendar::Simple 'date_span';

   <b>EXAMPLE</b>
       A simple "cal" replacement would therefore look like this:

         #!<a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?perl">/usr/bin/perl</a>

         use strict;
         use warnings;
         use Calendar::Simple;

         my @months = qw(January February March April May June July August
                         September October November December);

         my $mon = shift // (localtime)[4] + 1;
         my $yr  = shift // (localtime)[5] + 1900;
         my $sd  = shift // 1;

         my @month = calendar($mon, $yr, $sd);
         print "\n$months[$mon -1] $yr\n\n";

         my @days = qw(Su Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa);
         push @days, splice @days, 0, $sd;
         print "@days\n";

         foreach (@month) {
           print map { $_ ? sprintf "%2d ", $_ : '   ' } @$_;
           print "\n";
         }

       A version of this example, called "pcal", is installed when you install this module.

   <b>Date</b> <b>Range</b>
       This module will make use of DateTime if it is installed. By using DateTime it  can  use  any  date  that
       "DateTime"  can  represent.  If  DateTime  is  not  installed  it  uses Perl's built-in date handling and
       therefore can't deal with dates before 1970 and it will also have problems with dates  after  2038  on  a
       32-bit machine.

   <b>EXPORT</b>
       "calendar"
