</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       RTx::Calendar - Calendar view for RT ticket dates and custom fields

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       "RTx::Calendar" provides a calendar view to display tickets and reminders based on selected dates. Once
       the extension is installed, if you perform a ticket search using the Query Builder, you will see a new
       Calendar entry in the page menu. You can click that menu to see the calendar view of your search. A
       portlet is also available to add to any dashboard, including on the RT home page.

</pre><h4><b>RT</b> <b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       Works with RT 5.

       For older versions of RT, see the CHANGES file for compatible earlier versions.

</pre><h4><b>INSTALLATION</b></h4><pre>
       "perl Makefile.PL"
       "make"
       "make install"
           May need root permissions

       Create or edit a file in <u>/etc/request-tracker5/RT_SiteConfig.d</u>
           Add this line:

               Plugin('RTx::Calendar');

       Clear your mason cache
               rm -rf /var/cache/request-tracker5/mason_data/obj

       Restart your webserver

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       To  view  a  Calendar,  first  perform  a  ticket  search in the ticket Query Builder and load the search
       results. Then click the Calendar item in the page menu to see the calendar view based on the results from
       that search.

       By default, RTx::Calendar will display the Starts and Due date fields of each  ticket  from  your  search
       results as events on the Calendar.

       Other date fields added to the Format of a ticket search are displayed on the Calendar as events. You can
       also  display  events  based  on  Date or DateTime custom fields by adding them to the Format of a ticket
       search as well.

       Hover over events in the calendar to see additional details for that event.  You can click on entries  to
       go to the ticket.

   <b>Displaying</b> <b>Other</b> <b>Date</b> <b>Fields</b>
       You  can  show  other  date  fields as events on the Calendar by adding them to the Format section at the
       Advanced tab of your query. You can add and remove dates from search results using  the  Display  Columns
       section at the bottom of the Query Builder.

       Changes made using the Display Columns settings automatically update the search Format. You can also edit
       the Format directly on the Advanced page.

   <b>Calendar</b> <b>Portlet</b> <b>Saved</b> <b>Searches</b>
       As  described  above,  you can see a calendar for any ticket search using the calendar link in the search
       results.

       You can also create a saved search for the calendar to be used in calendar portlets  on  dashboards.  See
       "CONFIGURATION" for details on adding the calendar portlets.

       By  default,  the calendar looks for a saved search with the name "calendar" and will use that search for
       calendar portlets. Saved searches can be saved with different privacy settings, so your system  can  have
       multiple  saved  "calendar"  searches. For a given user, the calendar first checks for a user-level saved
       search (personal to that user), then for a group-level saved search  for  groups  the  user  is  in,  and
       finally, for a system-level saved search.

   <b>Displaying</b> <b>Reminders</b>
       Reminders are displayed on the Calendar only if you explicitly add the following clause to your query:

           AND ( Type = 'ticket' OR Type = 'reminder' )

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Use</b> <b>the</b> <b>Calendar</b> <b>on</b> <b>Dashboard</b>
       The Calendar comes with 3 different portlets that can be added to your RT dashboards:

       "MyCalendar"
           A summary of the events for the current week.

       "Calendar"
           A full-month view of the Calendar.

       "CalendarWithSidebar"
           A full-month view of the Calendar, with a sidebar that includes an extra status filter and legends of
           the Calendar events.

       To  make  these  portlets available in RT, add them to the $HomepageComponents configuration in a file in
       <u>/etc/request-tracker5/RT_SiteConfig.d</u>:

           Set($HomepageComponents, [qw(QuickCreate Quicksearch
               MyAdminQueues MySupportQueues MyReminders RefreshHomepage
               MyCalendar Calendar CalendarWithSidebar)]);

       Users can then select them when building dashboards.

   <b>Display</b> <b>Configuration</b>
       <u>Display</u> <u>Owner</u>

       You can  show  the  owner  of  the  ticket  in  each  event  box  by  adding  this  line  to  a  file  in
       <u>/etc/request-tracker5/RT_SiteConfig.d</u>:

           Set($CalendarDisplayOwner, 1);

       <u>Choosing</u> <u>the</u> <u>fields</u> <u>to</u> <u>be</u> <u>displayed</u> <u>in</u> <u>the</u> <u>popup</u>

       When  you  mouse  over  events  on  the calendar, a popup window shows additional details from the ticket
       associated with that event. You can configure which fields are displayed with @CalendarPopupFields.  This
       is the default configuration:

           Set(@CalendarPopupFields, (
               "OwnerObj-&gt;Name",
               "CreatedObj-&gt;ISO",
               "StartsObj-&gt;ISO",
               "StartedObj-&gt;ISO",
               "LastUpdatedObj-&gt;ISO",
               "DueObj-&gt;ISO",
               "ResolvedObj-&gt;ISO",
               "Status",
               "Priority",
               "Requestors-&gt;MemberEmailAddressesAsString",
           ));

       To   show   custom   field   values,   add   them   using   the   custom   field  name  in  this  format:
       "CustomField.{Maintenance Start}".

       Valid values are all fields on an RT ticket. See the RT documentation for "RT::Ticket" for a list.

       As shown above, for ticket fields that can have multiple output formats, like dates and  users,  you  can
       also  use  the  "Obj" associated with the field to call a specific method to display the format you want.
       The ticket dates shown above will display dates in "ISO" format. The  documentation  for  "RT::Date"  has
       other  format options. User fields, like Owner, can use the methods shown in the "RT::User" documentation
       to show values like EmailAddress or RealName, for example.

       <u>Event</u> <u>Colors</u>

       The Calendar shows events in different colors based on the ticket status.  Use $CalendarStatusColorMap to
       set alternate colors or add custom statuses.  The following is the default configuration:

           Set(%CalendarStatusColorMap, (
               '_default_'                             =&gt; '#5555f8',
               'new'                                   =&gt; '#87873c',
               'open'                                  =&gt; '#5555f8',
               'rejected'                              =&gt; '#FF0000',
               'resolved'                              =&gt; '#72b872',
               'stalled'                               =&gt; '#FF0000',
           ));

       You can use any color declaration that CSS supports, including hex codes, color names, and RGB values.

       The "_default_" key is used for events that don't have a status in the $CalendarStatusColorMap hash.  The
       default color is a dark tone of blue.

       <u>Filter</u> <u>on</u> <u>Status</u>

       The  Calendar has a Filter on Status section that allows you to filter events by status without having to
       change the original query.  The @CalendarFilterStatuses setting controls which statuses are available for
       filtering. The following is the default:

           Set(@CalendarFilterStatuses, qw(new open stalled rejected resolved));

       You  can  change  the  default  selected  statuses  of  the  Filter  On  Status   section   by   defining
       @CalendarFilterDefaultStatuses. The following is the default:

           Set(@CalendarFilterDefaultStatuses, qw(new open));

       <u>Custom</u> <u>Icons</u>

       The  calendar shows different icons for events based on the date fields used to display the event on that
       day. The %CalendarIcons setting controls which icons are used for each date field. The following  is  the
       default using provided icons:

           Set(%CalendarIcons, (
               'Reminder'     =&gt; 'reminder.png',
               'Resolved'     =&gt; 'resolved.png',
               'Starts, Due'  =&gt; 'starts_due.png',
               'Created, Due' =&gt; 'created_due.png',
               'Created'      =&gt; 'created.png',
               'Due'          =&gt; 'due.png',
               'Starts'       =&gt; 'starts.png',
               'Started'      =&gt; 'started.png',
               'LastUpdated'  =&gt; 'updated.png',
           ));

       You can also define icons for custom fields by using the following format:

               'CF.{Maintenance Start}' =&gt; 'maintstart.png',
               'CF.{Maintenance Stop}'  =&gt; 'maintstop.png',

       To  add custom images, create a directory called <u>/usr/local/share/request-tracker5/static/images</u> and copy
       image files there.

       You can use any image format that your browser supports, but PNGs and GIFs with  transparent  backgrounds
       are  recommended  because they will display better to the background color of the events. The recommended
       size is 10 pixels wide and 7 pixels in high.

       <u>Multiple</u> <u>Days</u> <u>Events</u>

       By default, calendars display individual events on each day based on the dates in the query.

       To display events that span multiple days, such as the  full  expected  duration  of  a  change  blackout
       period,  define the fields using the %CalendarMultipleDaysEvents configuration. This option accepts named
       keys that each define the field to reference for the start (Starts) and end (Ends) of  multi-day  events.
       For example:

           Set( %CalendarMultipleDaysEvents, (
               'Project Task' =&gt; {
                   'Starts' =&gt; 'Starts',
                   'Ends'   =&gt; 'Due',
               },
           ));

       The  keys,  like "Project Task", are arbitrary labels to group each set, so you can use a name that helps
       you identify the entry.

       You can also define multiple day events for custom fields by using the following format:

           Set( %CalendarMultipleDaysEvents, (
               'Maintenance' =&gt; {
                   "Starts" =&gt; "CF.{Maintenance Start}",
                   "Ends"   =&gt; "CF.{Maintenance Stop}",
               },
               'Project Task' =&gt; {
                   'Starts' =&gt; 'Starts',
                   'Ends'   =&gt; 'Due',
               },
           ));

       As with all calendar entries, the date fields referenced in the configuration must  be  included  in  the
       search result Format to display the event on the Calendar.
