       MP3::Tag::File - Module for reading / writing files

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         my $mp3 = MP3::Tag-&gt;new($filename);

         ($title, $artist, $no, $album, $year) = $mp3-&gt;parse_filename();

       see MP3::Tag

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       MP3::Tag::File is designed to be called from the MP3::Tag module.

       It offers possibilities to read/write data from files via <b>read()</b>, <b>write()</b>, <b>truncate()</b>, <b>seek()</b>, <b>tell()</b>,
       <b>open()</b>, <b>close()</b>; one can find the filename via the <b>filename()</b> method.

       <b>parse_filename()</b>
             ($title, $artist, $no, $album, $year) = $mp3-&gt;parse_filename($what, $filename);

           <b>parse_filename()</b>  tries to extract information about artist, title, track number, album and year from
           the filename.  (For backward compatibility it may be also called by deprecated name <b>read_filename()</b>.)

           This is likely to fail for a lot of filenames, especially the album will be often wrongly guessed, as
           the name of the parent directory is taken as album name.

           $what and $filename are optional. $what maybe title, track,  artist,  album  or  year.  If  $what  is
           defined <b>parse_filename()</b> will return only this element.

           If  $filename  is  defined  this  filename  will  be  used and not the real filename which was set by
           MP3::Tag with  "MP3::Tag-&gt;new($filename)".   Otherwise  the  actual  filename  is  used  (subject  to
           configuration variable "decode_encoding_filename").

           Following formats will be hopefully recognized:

           - album name/artist name - song name.mp3

           - album_name/artist_name-song_name.mp3

           - album.name/artist.name_song.name.mp3

           - album name/(artist name) song name.mp3

           - album name/01. artist name - song name.mp3

           - album name/artist name - 01 - song.name.mp3

           If artist or title end in "(NUMBER)" with 4-digit NUMBER, it is considered the year.

       <b>title()</b>
            $title = $mp3-&gt;title($filename);

           Returns   the   title,   guessed  from  the  filename.  See  also  <b>parse_filename()</b>.   (For  backward
           compatibility, can be called by deprecated name <b>song()</b>.)

           $filename is optional and will be used instead of the real filename if defined.

       <b>artist()</b>
            $artist = $mp3-&gt;artist($filename);

           Returns the artist name, guessed from the filename. See also <b>parse_filename()</b>

           $filename is optional and will be used instead of the real filename if defined.

       <b>track()</b>
            $track = $mp3-&gt;track($filename);

           Returns the track number, guessed from the filename. See also <b>parse_filename()</b>

           $filename is optional and will be used instead of the real filename if defined.

       <b>year()</b>
            $year = $mp3-&gt;year($filename);

           Returns the year, guessed from the filename. See also <b>parse_filename()</b>

           $filename is optional and will be used instead of the real filename if defined.

       <b>album()</b>
            $album = $mp3-&gt;album($filename);

           Returns the album name, guessed from the filename.  See  also  <b>parse_filename()</b>  The  album  name  is
           guessed from the parent directory, so it is very likely to fail.

           $filename is optional and will be used instead of the real filename if defined.

       <b>comment()</b>
            $comment = $mp3-&gt;comment($filename);   # Always undef

       <b>genre()</b>
            $genre = $mp3-&gt;genre($filename);       # Always undef
