</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       MP3::Tag::ParseData - Module for parsing arbitrary data associated with music files.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
          # parses the file name according to one of the patterns:
          $mp3-&gt;config('parse_data', ['i', '%f', '%t - %n - %a.%e', '%t - %y.%e']);
          $title = $mp3-&gt;title;

       see MP3::Tag

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       MP3::Tag::ParseData is designed to be called from the MP3::Tag module.

       Each option of configuration item "parse_data" should be of the form "[$flag, $string, $pattern1, ...]".
       For each of the option, patterns of the option are matched agains the $string of the option, until one of
       them succeeds.  The information obtained from later options takes precedence over the information
       obtained from earlier ones.

       The meaning of the patterns is the same as for <b>parse()</b> or <b>parse_rex()</b> methods of "MP3::Tag".  Since the
       default for "parse_data" is empty, by default this handler has no effect.

       $flag is split into 1-character-long flags (unknown flags are ignored):

       "i" the string-to-parse is interpolated first;

       "f" the string-to-parse is interpreted as the name of the file to read;

       "F" added to "f", makes it non-fatal if the file does not exist;

       "B" the file should be read in "binary" mode;

       "n" the string-to-parse is interpreted as collection of lines, one per track;

       "l" the string-to-parse is interpreted as collection of lines, and the first matched is chosen;

       "I" the resulting string is interpolated before parsing.

       "b" Do  not  strip  the  leading  and  trailing blanks.  (With output to file, the output is performed in
           binary mode too.)

       "R" the patterns are considered as regular expressions.

       "m" one of the patterns must match.

       "o", "O", "D"
           With "o" or "O" interpret the pattern as a name of file to output parse-data to.  With "O"  the  name
           of output file is interpolated.  When "D" is present, intermediate directories are created.

       "z" Do not ignore a field even if the result is a 0-length string.

       Unless  "b"  option  is  given,  the  resulting  values  have  starting  and trailing whitespace trimmed.
       (Actually, <b>split()</b>ing into lines is done using the  configuration  item  "parse_split";  it  defaults  to
       "\n".)

       If the configuration item "parse_data" has multiple options, the $strings which are interpolated will use
       information  set  by preceding options; similarly, any interolated option may use information obtained by
       other handlers - even if these handers are later in the pecking order than  "MP3::Tag::ParseData"  (which
       by default is the first handler).  For example, with

         ['i', '%t' =&gt; '%t (%y)'], ['i', '%t' =&gt; '%t - %c']

       and  a  local  CDDB file which identifies title to 'Merry old - another interpretation (1905)', the first
       field will interpolate '%t' into this title, then will split it into the year and the rest.   The  second
       field will split the rest into a title-proper and comment.

       Note that one can use fields of the form

         ['mz', 'This is a forced title' =&gt; '%t']

       to force particular values for parts of the MP3 tag.

       The  usual  methods  "artist", "title", "album", "comment", "year", "track", "year" can be used to access
       the results of the parse.

       It is possible to set individual id3v2 frames; use %{TIT1} or some such.   Setting  to  an  empty  string
       deletes the frame if config parameter "id3v2_frame_empty_ok" is false (the default value).  Setting ID3v2
       frames uses the same translation rules as <b>select_id3v2_frame_by_descr()</b>.

   <b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b>
       The  flags  "i  f  F B l m I b" are identical to flags of the method <b>interpolate_with_flags()</b> of MP3::Tag
       (see "interpolate_with_flags" in MP3::Tag).  Essentially, the other flags ("R m o O D z") are applied  to
       the result of calling the latter method.
