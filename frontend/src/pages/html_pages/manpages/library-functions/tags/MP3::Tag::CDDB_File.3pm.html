</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       MP3::Tag::CDDB_File - Module for parsing CDDB files.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         my $db = MP3::Tag::CDDB_File-&gt;new($filename, $track); # Name of audio file
         my $db = MP3::Tag::CDDB_File-&gt;new_from($record, $track); # Contents of CDDB

         ($title, $artist, $album, $year, $comment, $track) = $db-&gt;parse();

       see MP3::Tag

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       MP3::Tag::CDDB_File is designed to be called from the MP3::Tag module.

       It parses the content of CDDB file.

       The file is found in the same directory as audio file; the list of possible file names is taken from the
       field "cddb_files" if set by MP3::Tag <b>config()</b> method.

       <b>parse()</b>
             ($title, $artist, $album, $year, $comment, $track) =
                $db-&gt;parse($what);

           <b>parse_filename()</b> extracts information about artist, title, track number, album and year from the CDDB
           record.  $what is optional; it maybe title, track, artist, album, year, genre or comment. If $what is
           defined <b>parse()</b> will return only this element.

           Additionally, $what can take values "artist_collection" (returns the value of artist in the disk-info
           field DTITLE, but only if author is specified in the track-info field TTITLE), "title_track" (returns
           the  title  specifically from track-info field - the "track" may fall back to the info from disk-info
           field), "comment_collection" (processed EXTD comment), "comment_track" (processed EXTT comment).

           The returned year and genre is taken from DYEAR, DGENRE, EXTT, EXTD fields;  recognized  prefixes  in
           the  two  last  fields  are  YEAR,  ID3Y,  ID3G.  The declarations of this form are stripped from the
           returned comment.

           An alternative syntax "Recorded"/"Recorded on"/"Recorded in"/ is also supported; the  format  of  the
           date recognized by <b>ID3v2::year()</b>, or just a date field without a prefix.

       <b>title()</b>
            $title = $db-&gt;title();

           Returns the title, obtained from the 'Tracktitle' entry of the file.

       <b>artist()</b>
            $artist = $db-&gt;artist();

           Returns  the  artist name, obtained from the 'Performer' or 'Albumperformer' entries (the first which
           is present) of the file.

       <b>track()</b>
            $track = $db-&gt;track();

           Returns the track number, stored during object creation, or queried from the parent.

       <b>year()</b>
            $year = $db-&gt;year();

           Returns the year, obtained from the 'Year' entry of the file.  (Often not present.)

       <b>album()</b>
            $album = $db-&gt;album();

           Returns the album name, obtained from the 'Albumtitle' entry of the file.

       <b>comment()</b>
            $comment = $db-&gt;comment();

           Returns the 'Trackcomment' entry of the file.  (Often not present.)

       <b>genre()</b>
            $genre = $db-&gt;genre($filename);
