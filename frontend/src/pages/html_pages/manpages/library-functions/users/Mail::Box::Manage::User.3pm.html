</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Mail::Box::Manage::User - manage the folders of a user

</pre><h4><b>INHERITANCE</b></h4><pre>
        Mail::Box::Manage::User
          is a Mail::Box::Manager
          is a Mail::Reporter

        Mail::Box::Manage::User is extended by
          Mail::Server::IMAP4::User

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        use Mail::Box::Manage::User;
        use User::Identity;

        my $id      = User::Identity-&gt;new(...);
        my $user    = Mail::Box::Manage::User-&gt;new
          ( identity  =&gt; $id
          , folderdir =&gt; "$ENV{HOME}/Mail"
          , inbox     =&gt; $ENV{MAIL}
          );

        my $inbox   = $user-&gt;open($user-&gt;inbox);
        my $top     = $user-&gt;topfolder;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Where the Mail::Box::Manager takes care of some set of open folder, this extension will add knowledge
       about some related person.  At the same time, it will try to cache some information about that person's
       folder files.

       Extends "DESCRIPTION" in Mail::Box::Manager.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       Extends "METHODS" in Mail::Box::Manager.

   <b>Constructors</b>
       Extends "Constructors" in Mail::Box::Manager.

       Mail::Box::Manage::User-&gt;<b>new</b>($args)
           Use new(default_folder_type) to explicitly state which kind of folders you use.

             Subfolders grouped together.

           default_folder_type =&gt; NAME|CLASS
           delimiter =&gt; STRING
             The  separator  used in folder names.  This doesn't need to be the same as your directory system is
             using.

           identity =&gt; OBJECT
             The main difference between the Mail::Box::Manager and this class, is the concept  of  some  person
             (or  virtual  person)  who's  files  are  being  administered  by  this  object.   The OBJECT is an
             User::Identity.

             The smallest identity that will do: "my $id = User::Identity-&gt;new('myname')"

           inbox =&gt; NAME
             The name of the user's inbox.

           Inherited, see "Attributes" in Mail::Box::Manager

       $obj-&gt;<b>identity</b>()
           Returns a User::Identity object.

       $obj-&gt;<b>inbox</b>( [$name] )
           (Set and) get the $name of the mailbox which is considered the folder for  incoming  mail.   In  many
           protocols, this folder is handled separately.  For instance in IMAP this is the only case-insensitive
           folder name.

       $obj-&gt;<b>registerType</b>($type, $class, %options)
           Inherited, see "Attributes" in Mail::Box::Manager

   <b>Manage</b> <b>existing</b> <b>folders</b>
       Extends "Manage existing folders" in Mail::Box::Manager.

   <b>Manage</b> <b>folders</b>
       $obj-&gt;<b>create</b>($name, %options)
           Creates   a   new   folder   with   the   specified   name.   An  folder's  administrative  structure
           (Mail::Box::Identity) is returned, but the folder is not opened.

           In the accidental case that the folder already exists,  a  warning  will  be  issued,  and  an  empty
           list/undef returned.

           The  %options  are  passed to <b>Mail::Box::create()</b> of your default folder type, except for the options
           intended for this method itself.

            -Option       --Default
             create_real    &lt;true&gt;
             create_supers  &lt;false&gt;
             deleted        &lt;false&gt;
             id_options     []

           create_real =&gt; BOOLEAN
             When this option is false, the pysical folder will not be created, but only the  administration  is
             updated.

           create_supers =&gt; BOOLEAN
             When you create a folder where upper hierarchy level are missing, they will be created as well.

           deleted =&gt; BOOLEAN
             The folder starts as deleted.

           id_options =&gt; ARRAY
             Values  passed  to  the  instantiated  Mail::Box::Identity.   That  object  is very picky about the
             initiation values it accepts.

       $obj-&gt;<b>delete</b>($name)
           Remove all signs from the folder on the file-system.  Messages still in the folder will  be  removed.
           This  method  returns  a  true  value when the folder has been removed or not found, so "false" means
           failure.

           It is also possible to delete a folder using "$folder-&gt;delete", which will  call  this  method  here.
           OPTIONS,  which are used for some other folder types, will be ignored here: the user's index contains
           the required details.

            -Option   --Defined in        --Default
             recursive  Mail::Box::Manager  &lt;folder's default&gt;

           recursive =&gt; BOOLEAN

           example: how to delete a folder

            print "no xyz (anymore)\n" if $user-&gt;delete('xyz');

       $obj-&gt;<b>folder</b>($name)
           Returns the folder description, a Mail::Box::Identity.

       $obj-&gt;<b>folderCollection</b>($name)
           Returns a pair: the folder collection (Mail::Box::Collection) and the base name of $name.

       $obj-&gt;<b>rename</b>($oldname, $newname, %options)
           Rename the folder with name $oldname to $newname.  Both names are full pathnames.

            -Option       --Default
             create_supers  &lt;false&gt;

           create_supers =&gt; BOOLEAN
             When you rename a folder to a place where upper hierarchy levels are  missing,  they  will  get  be
             defined, but with the deleted flag set.

       $obj-&gt;<b>topfolder</b>()
           Returns the top folder of the user's mailbox storage.

   <b>Move</b> <b>messages</b> <b>to</b> <b>folders</b>
       Extends "Move messages to folders" in Mail::Box::Manager.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       Error: Cannot create $name: higher levels missing
           Unless  you set create(create_supers), all higher level folders must exist before this new one can be
           created.

       Error: Cannot rename $name to $new: higher levels missing
           Unless you set create(create_supers), all higher level folders must exist before this new one can  be
           created.

       Error: Folder $name is already open.
           You cannot ask the manager for a folder which is already open. In some older releases (before MailBox
           2.049),  this  was  permitted,  but then behaviour changed, because many nasty side-effects are to be
           expected.  For instance, an <b>Mail::Box::update()</b> on one folder  handle  would  influence  the  second,
           probably unexpectedly.

       Error: Folder $name is not a Mail::Box; cannot add a message.
           The  folder  where  the  message  should be appended to is an object which is not a folder type which
           extends Mail::Box.  Probably, it is not a folder at all.

       Warning: Folder does not exist, failed opening $type folder $name.
           The folder does not exist and creating is not permitted (see open(create)) or did not succeed.   When
           you  do  not have sufficient access rights to the folder (for instance wrong password for POP3), this
           warning will be produced as well.

           The manager tried to open a folder of the specified type.  It may help to explicitly state  the  type
           of your folder with the "type" option.  There will probably be another warning or error message which
           is  related  to  this  report and provides more details about its cause.  You may also have a look at
           new(autodetect) and new(folder_types).

       Warning: Folder type $type is unknown, using autodetect.
           The specified folder type (see open(type), possibly derived from the folder name  when  specified  as
           url)  is  not known to the manager.  This may mean that you forgot to require the Mail::Box extension
           which implements this folder type, but probably it is a  typo.   Usually,  the  manager  is  able  to
           figure-out which type to use by itself.

       Error: Illegal folder URL '$url'.
           The  folder name was specified as URL, but not according to the syntax.  See <b>decodeFolderURL()</b> for an
           description of the syntax.

       Error: No foldername specified to open.
           open() needs a folder name as first argument (before the list  of  options),  or  with  the  "folder"
           option  within  the list.  If no name was found, the MAIL environment variable is checked.  When even
           that does not result in a usable folder, then this error is produced.  The error may be caused by  an
           accidental odd-length option list.

       Error: Package $package does not implement $method.
           Fatal  error:  the specific package (or one of its superclasses) does not implement this method where
           it should. This message means that some other related classes do implement this  method  however  the
           class  at  hand does not.  Probably you should investigate this and probably inform the author of the
           package.

       Error: Unable to remove folder $dir
       Error: Use <b>appendMessage()</b> to add messages which are not in a folder.
           You do not need to copy this message into the folder, because you do not share  the  message  between
           folders.

       Warning: Use <b>moveMessage()</b> or <b>copyMessage()</b> to move between open folders.
           The  message  is  already part of a folder, and now it should be appended to a different folder.  You
           need to decide between copy or move, which both will clone the message (not the  body,  because  they
           are immutable).

       Warning: Will never create a folder $name without having write access.
           You have set open(create), but only want to read the folder.  Create is only useful for folders which
           have write or append access modes (see Mail::Box::new(access)).
