       File::XDG - Basic implementation of the XDG base directory specification

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 1.03

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        use File::XDG 1.00;

        my $xdg = File::XDG-&gt;new( name =&gt; 'foo', api =&gt; 1 );

        # user config
        my $path = $xdg-&gt;config_home;

        # user data
        my $path = $xdg-&gt;data_home;

        # user cache
        my $path = $xdg-&gt;cache_home;

        # system $config
        my @dirs = $xdg-&gt;config_dirs_list;

        # system data
        my @dirs = $xdg-&gt;data_dirs_list;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module provides a basic implementation of the XDG base directory specification as exists by the Free
       Desktop Organization (FDO). It supports all XDG directories except for the runtime directories, which
       require session management support in order to function.

</pre><h4><b>CONSTRUCTOR</b></h4><pre>
   <b>new</b>
        my $xdg = File::XDG-&gt;new( %args );

       Returns a new instance of a File::XDG object. This must be called with an application name as the "name"
       argument.

       Takes the following named arguments:

       api [version 0.09]

           The API version to use.

           api = 0
               The default and original API version.  For backward compatibility only.

           api = 1
               Recommended stable API version for all new code.

       name
           Name of the application for which File::XDG is being used.

       path_class
           [version 0.09]

           The path class to return

           File::Spec
               All methods that return a file will return a string generated by File::Spec.

           Path::Class
               This  is  the  default  with  api = 0.  All methods that return a file will return an instance of
               Path::Class::File  and  all  methods  that  return  a  directory  will  return  an  instance   of
               Path::Class::Dir.

           Path::Tiny
               This  is  the  default  with  api = 1.  All methods that return a file will return an instance of
               Path::Tiny.

           "CODEREF"
               If a code reference is passed in then this will be called in order to construct the  path  class.
               This allows rolling your own customer path class objects.  Example:

                my $xdg = File::XDG-&gt;new(
                  name =&gt; 'foo',
                  # equivalent to path_class =&gt; 'Path::Tiny'
                  path_class =&gt; sub { Path::Tiny-&gt;new(@_),
                );

           "ARRAY"
               Similar  to passing a code reference, an array reference with two code references means the first
               code reference will be used for file paths and the second will be used for directory paths.  This
               is for path classes that differentiate between files and directories.

                # equivalent to path_class =&gt; 'Path::Class'
                my $xdg = File::XDG-&gt;new(
                  name =&gt; 'foo',
                  path_class =&gt; [
                    sub { Path::Class::File-&gt;new(@_) ),
                    sub { Path::Class::Dir-&gt;new(@_) },
                  ],
                );

       strict
           [version 0.10]

           More strictly follow the XDG base directory specification.  In particular

           •   On Windows a an exception will be thrown when creating the  File::XDG  object  because  the  spec
               cannot correctly be implemented.

               Historically  this  module has made some useful assumptions like using ";" instead of ":" for the
               path separator character.  This breaks the spec.

           •   On some systems, this module will look in system specific locations for the "runtime_home".  This
               is useful, but technically violates the spec, so under strict mode the "runtime_home" method will
               only return a path if one can be found via the spec.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>data_home</b>
        my $path = $xdg-&gt;data_home;

       Returns the user-specific data directory for the application as a path class object.

   <b>config_home</b>
        my $path = $xdg-&gt;config_home;

       Returns the user-specific configuration directory for the application as a path class object.

   <b>cache_home</b>
        my $path = $xdg-&gt;cache_home;

       Returns the user-specific cache directory for the application as a path class object.

   <b>state_home</b>
        my $path = $xdg-&gt;state_home;

       Returns the user-specific state directory for the application as a path class object.

   <b>runtime_home</b>
       [version 0.10]

        my $dir = $xdg-&gt;runtime_home;

       Returns the directory for user-specific non-essential runtime files  and  other  file  objects  (such  as
       sockets, named pipes, etc) for the application.

       This is not always provided, if not available, this method will return "undef".

       Under  strict  mode,  this  method will only rely on the "XDG_RUNTIME_DIR" to find this directory.  Under
       non-strict mode, system specific methods may be used, if the environment variable is not set:

       Linux systemd
           The path "/run/user/UID" will be used, if it exists, and fulfills the requirements of the spec.

   <b>data_dirs</b>
        my $dirs = $xdg-&gt;data_dirs;

       Returns the system data directories, not  modified  for  the  application.  Per  the  specification,  the
       returned string is ":"-delimited, except on Windows where it is ";"-delimited.

       For portability "data_dirs_list" is preferred.

   <b>data_dirs_list</b>
       [version 0.06]

        my @dirs = $xdg-&gt;data_dirs_list;

       Returns the system data directories as a list of path class objects.

   <b>config_dirs</b>
        my $dirs = $xdg-&gt;config_dirs;

       Returns  the  system  config  directories,  not  modified for the application. Per the specification, the
       returned string is :-delimited, except on Windows where it is ";"-delimited.

       For portability "config_dirs_list" is preferred.

   <b>config_dirs_list</b>
       [version 0.06]

        my @dirs = $xdg-&gt;config_dirs_list;

       Returns the system config directories as a list of path class objects.

   <b>exe_dir</b>
       [version 0.10]

        my $exe = $xdg-&gt;exe_dir;

       Returns the user-specific executable files directory "$HOME/.local/bin", if it exists.  If  it  does  not
       exist then "undef" will be returned.  This directory <u>should</u> be added to the "PATH" according to the spec.

   <b>lookup_data_file</b>
        my $xdg = File::XDG-&gt;new( name =&gt; $name, api =&gt; 1 ); # recommended
        my $path = $xdg-&gt;lookup_data_File($filename);

       Looks  up the data file by searching for "./$name/$filename" (where $name is provided by the constructor)
       relative to all base directories indicated  by  $XDG_DATA_HOME  and  $XDG_DATA_DIRS.  If  an  environment
       variable  is  either not set or empty, its default value as defined by the specification is used instead.
       Returns a path class object.

        my $xdg = File::XDG-&gt;new( name =&gt; $name ); # back compat only
        my $path = $xdg-&gt;lookup_data_file($subdir, $filename);

       Looks up the data file by searching for "./$subdir/$filename" relative to all base directories  indicated
       by  $XDG_DATA_HOME and $XDG_DATA_DIRS. If an environment variable is either not set or empty, its default
       value as defined by the specification is used instead. Returns a path class object.

   <b>lookup_config_file</b>
        my $xdg = File::XDG-&gt;new( name =&gt; $name, api =&gt; 1 ); # recommended
        my $path = $xdg-&gt;lookup_config_file($filename);

       Looks up the configuration file by searching for "./$name/$filename" (where  $name  is  provided  by  the
       constructor)  relative  to all base directories indicated by $XDG_CONFIG_HOME and $XDG_CONFIG_DIRS. If an
       environment variable is either not set or empty, its default value as defined  by  the  specification  is
       used instead. Returns a path class object.

        my $xdg = File::XDG-&gt;new( name =&gt; $name ); # back compat only
        my $path = $xdg-&gt;lookup_config_file($subdir, $filename);

       Looks  up  the configuration file by searching for "./$subdir/$filename" relative to all base directories
       indicated by $XDG_CONFIG_HOME and $XDG_CONFIG_DIRS. If an environment  variable  is  either  not  set  or
       empty, its default value as defined by the specification is used instead. Returns a path class object.

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
       This module intentionally and out of necessity does not follow the spec on the following platforms:

       "MSWin32" (Strawberry Perl, Visual C++ Perl, etc)
           The spec requires ":" as the path separator, but use of this character is essential for absolute path
           names in Windows, so the Windows Path separator ";" is used instead.

           There are no global data or config directories in windows so the  data  and  config  directories  are
           empty list instead of the default UNIX locations.

           The base directory instead of being the user's home directory is "%LOCALAPPDATA%".  Arguably the data
           and  config base directory should be "%APPDATA%", but cache should definitely be in "%LOCALAPPDATA%",
           and we chose to use just one base directory for simplicity.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       Path::Class
           Portable native path class used by this module used by default (api = 0) and optionally (api = 1).

       Path::Tiny

       Path::Spec
           Core Perl library for working with file and directory paths.

       File::BaseDir
           Provides similar functionality to this module with a different interface.
