</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       User::Identity - maintain info about a physical person

</pre><h4><b>INHERITANCE</b></h4><pre>
        User::Identity
          is a User::Identity::Item

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        use User::Identity;
        my $me = User::Identity-&gt;new
         ( 'john'
         , firstname =&gt; 'John'
         , surname   =&gt; 'Doe'
         );
        print $me-&gt;fullName  # prints "John Doe"
        print $me;           # same

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The "User-Identity" distribution is created to maintain a set of informational objects which are related
       to one user.  The "User::Identity" module tries to be smart providing defaults, conversions and often
       required combinations.

       The identities are not implementing any kind of storage, and can therefore be created by any simple or
       complex Perl program.  This way, it is more flexible than an XML file to store the data.  For instance,
       you can decide to store the data with Data::Dumper, Storable, DBI, AddressBook or whatever.  Extension to
       simplify this task are still to be developed.

       If you need more kinds of user information, then please contact the module author.

       Extends "DESCRIPTION" in User::Identity::Item.

</pre><h4><b>OVERLOADED</b></h4><pre>
       $obj-&gt;<b>stringification</b>()
           When an "User::Identity" is used as string, it is automatically translated into the <b>fullName()</b> of the
           user involved.

           example:

            my $me = User::Identity-&gt;new(...)
            print $me;          # same as  print $me-&gt;fullName
            print "I am $me\n"; # also stringification

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       Extends "METHODS" in User::Identity::Item.

   <b>Constructors</b>
       Extends "Constructors" in User::Identity::Item.

       User::Identity-&gt;<b>new</b>( [$name], %options )
           Create  a  new  user  identity, which will contain all data related to a single physical human being.
           Most user data can only be specified at object construction, because they  should  never  change.   A
           $name may be specified as first argument, but also as option, one way or the other is required.

   <b>Attributes</b>
       Extends "Attributes" in User::Identity::Item.

       $obj-&gt;<b>age</b>()
           Calcuted  from  the datge of birth to the current moment, as integer.  On the birthday, the number is
           incremented already.

       $obj-&gt;<b>birth</b>()
           Returns the date in standardized format: YYYYMMDD, easy to sort and select.  This may return "undef",
           even if the <b>dateOfBirth()</b> contains a value, simply because the format is not understood. Month or day
           may contain '00' to indicate that those values are not known.

       $obj-&gt;<b>charset</b>()
           The user's preferred character set, which defaults to the value of LC_CTYPE environment variable.

       $obj-&gt;<b>courtesy</b>()
           The courtesy is used to address people in a very formal way.  Values are like "Mr.",  "Mrs.",  "Sir",
           "Frau",  "Heer",  "de  heer",  "mevrouw".   This  often  provides a way to find the gender of someone
           addressed.

       $obj-&gt;<b>dateOfBirth</b>()
           Returns the date of birth, as specified during instantiation.

       $obj-&gt;<b>description</b>()
           Inherited, see "Attributes" in User::Identity::Item

       $obj-&gt;<b>firstname</b>()
           Returns the first name of the user.  If it  is  not  defined  explicitly,  it  is  derived  from  the
           nickname, and than capitalized if needed.

       $obj-&gt;<b>formalName</b>()
           Returns  a  formal  name  for the user.  If not defined as instantiation parameter (see <b>new()</b>), it is
           constructed from other available information, which may result in an incorrect or an incomplete name.
           The result is built from "courtesy initials prefix surname title".

       $obj-&gt;<b>fullName</b>()
           If this is not specified as value during object construction, it is  guessed  based  on  other  known
           values  like "firstname prefix surname".  If a surname is provided without firstname, the nickname is
           taken as firstname.  When a firstname is provided without surname, the nickname is taken as  surname.
           If both are not provided, then the nickname is used as fullname.

       $obj-&gt;<b>gender</b>()
           Returns  the  specified  gender of the person, as specified during instantiation, which could be like
           'Male', 'm', 'homme', 'man'.  There is no smart behavior  on  this:  the  exact  specified  value  is
           returned. Methods <b>isMale()</b>, <b>isFemale()</b>, and <b>courtesy()</b> are smart.

       $obj-&gt;<b>initials</b>()
           The initials, which may be derived from the first letters of the firstname.

       $obj-&gt;<b>isFemale</b>()
           See <b>isMale()</b>: return true if we are sure the user is a woman.

       $obj-&gt;<b>isMale</b>()
           Returns  true if we are sure that the user is male.  This is specified as gender at instantiation, or
           derived from the courtesy value.  Methods isMale and isFemale are not complementatory: they can  both
           return false for the same user, in which case the gender is undertermined.

       $obj-&gt;<b>language</b>()
           Can  contain  a  list  or  a  single language name, as defined by the RFC Examples are 'en', 'en-GB',
           'nl-BE'.  The default language  is 'en' (English).

       $obj-&gt;<b>name</b>( [$newname] )
           Inherited, see "Attributes" in User::Identity::Item

       $obj-&gt;<b>nickname</b>()
           Returns the user's nickname, which could be used  as  username,  e-mail  alias,  or  such.   When  no
           nickname was explicitly specified, the name is used.

       $obj-&gt;<b>prefix</b>()
           The words which are between the firstname (or initials) and the surname.

       $obj-&gt;<b>surname</b>()
           Returns the surname of person, or "undef" if that is not known.

       $obj-&gt;<b>titles</b>()
           The titles, degrees in education or of other kind.  If these are complex, you may need to specify the
           formal name of the users as well, because smart formatting probably failes.

   <b>Collections</b>
       Extends "Collections" in User::Identity::Item.

       $obj-&gt;<b>add</b>($collection, $role)
           Inherited, see "Collections" in User::Identity::Item

       $obj-&gt;<b>addCollection</b>( $object | &lt;[$type], %options&gt; )
           Inherited, see "Collections" in User::Identity::Item

       $obj-&gt;<b>collection</b>($name)
           Inherited, see "Collections" in User::Identity::Item

       $obj-&gt;<b>parent</b>( [$parent] )
           Inherited, see "Collections" in User::Identity::Item

       $obj-&gt;<b>removeCollection</b>($object|$name)
           Inherited, see "Collections" in User::Identity::Item

       $obj-&gt;<b>type</b>()
       User::Identity-&gt;<b>type</b>()
           Inherited, see "Collections" in User::Identity::Item

       $obj-&gt;<b>user</b>()
           Inherited, see "Collections" in User::Identity::Item

   <b>Searching</b>
       Extends "Searching" in User::Identity::Item.

       $obj-&gt;<b>find</b>($collection, $role)
           Inherited, see "Searching" in User::Identity::Item

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       Error: $object is not a collection.
           The first argument is an object, but not of a class which extends User::Identity::Collection.

       Error: Cannot load collection module for $type ($class).
           Either  the  specified  $type does not exist, or that module named $class returns compilation errors.
           If the type as specified in the warning is not the name of a package, you specified a nickname  which
           was not defined.  Maybe you forgot the 'require' the package which defines the nickname.

       Error: Creation of a collection via $class failed.
           The  $class  did compile, but it was not possible to create an object of that class using the options
           you specified.

       Error: Don't know what type of collection you want to add.
           If you add a collection, it must either by a collection object or a list of options which can be used
           to create a collection object.  In the latter case, the type of collection must be specified.

       Warning: No collection $name
           The collection with $name does not exist and can not be created.
