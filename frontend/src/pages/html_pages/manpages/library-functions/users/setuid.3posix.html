</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       setuid — set user ID

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/unistd.h">unistd.h</a>&gt;

       int setuid(uid_t <u>uid</u>);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       If  the  process  has appropriate privileges, <u>setuid</u>() shall set the real user ID, effective user ID, and
       the saved set-user-ID of the calling process to <u>uid</u>.

       If the process does not have appropriate privileges, but <u>uid</u> is equal to the real user ID  or  the  saved
       set-user-ID,  <u>setuid</u>()  shall  set  the  effective user ID to <u>uid</u>; the real user ID and saved set-user-ID
       shall remain unchanged.

       The <u>setuid</u>() function shall not affect the supplementary group list in any way.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       Upon successful completion, 0 shall be returned. Otherwise,  -1  shall  be  returned  and  <u>errno</u>  set  to
       indicate the error.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>setuid</u>()  function shall fail, return -1, and set <u>errno</u> to the corresponding value if one or more of
       the following are true:

       <b>EINVAL</b> The value of the <u>uid</u> argument is invalid and not supported by the implementation.

       <b>EPERM</b>  The process does not have appropriate privileges and <u>uid</u> does not match the real user  ID  or  the
              saved set-user-ID.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       The  various  behaviors  of  the  <u>setuid</u>() and <u>setgid</u>() functions when called by non-privileged processes
       reflect the behavior of different historical implementations. For portability, it is recommended that new
       non-privileged applications use the <u>seteuid</u>() and <u>setegid</u>() functions instead.

       The saved set-user-ID capability allows a program to regain the effective user ID established at the last
       <u>exec</u> call. Similarly, the saved set-group-ID capability allows a program to regain the effective group ID
       established at the last <u>exec</u> call. These capabilities are derived from System V. Without them, a  program
       might have to run as superuser in order to perform the same functions, because superuser can write on the
       user's  files.  This  is  a  problem because such a program can write on any user's files, and so must be
       carefully written to emulate the permissions  of  the  calling  process  properly.  In  System  V,  these
       capabilities  have  traditionally  been implemented only via the <u>setuid</u>() and <u>setgid</u>() functions for non-
       privileged processes. The fact that  the  behavior  of  those  functions  was  different  for  privileged
       processes  made  them difficult to use. The POSIX.1‐1990 standard defined the <u>setuid</u>() function to behave
       differently for privileged and unprivileged users.  When  the  caller  had  appropriate  privileges,  the
       function  set  the  real  user  ID,  effective  user  ID, and saved set-user ID of the calling process on
       implementations that supported it. When the caller did not have appropriate privileges, the function  set
       only  the  effective  user  ID,  subject  to  permission  checks.  The former use is generally needed for
       utilities like <u>login</u> and <u>su</u>, which are  not  conforming  applications  and  thus  outside  the  scope  of
       POSIX.1‐2008. These utilities wish to change the user ID irrevocably to a new value, generally that of an
       unprivileged  user. The latter use is needed for conforming applications that are installed with the set-
       user-ID bit and need to perform operations using the real user ID.

       POSIX.1‐2008 augments the latter functionality with a  mandatory  feature  named  _POSIX_SAVED_IDS.  This
       feature  permits  a  set-user-ID  application  to switch its effective user ID back and forth between the
       values of its <u>exec</u>-time real user ID and effective user ID. Unfortunately, the POSIX.1‐1990 standard  did
       not  permit  a conforming application using this feature to work properly when it happened to be executed
       with (implementation-defined) appropriate privileges. Furthermore, the application did not  even  have  a
       means  to  tell whether it had this privilege. Since the saved set-user-ID feature is quite desirable for
       applications, as evidenced by the fact that NIST required it in FIPS  151‐2,  it  has  been  mandated  by
       POSIX.1‐2008.  However, there are implementors who have been reluctant to support it given the limitation
       described above.

       The 4.3BSD system handles the problem by supporting separate functions: <u>setuid</u>() (which always sets  both
       the  real  and  effective  user  IDs,  like <u>setuid</u>() in POSIX.1‐2008 for privileged users), and <u>seteuid</u>()
       (which always sets just the effective user ID, like <u>setuid</u>() in POSIX.1‐2008 for  non-privileged  users).
       This  separation  of  functionality  into distinct functions seems desirable. 4.3BSD does not support the
       saved set-user-ID feature. It supports similar functionality of switching the effective user ID back  and
       forth  via  <u>setreuid</u>(),  which  permits  reversing the real and effective user IDs. This model seems less
       desirable than the saved set-user-ID because the real user ID  changes  as  a  side-effect.  The  current
       4.4BSD  includes  saved  effective  IDs and uses them for <u>seteuid</u>() and <u>setegid</u>() as described above. The
       <u>setreuid</u>() and <u>setregid</u>() functions will be deprecated or removed.

       The solution here is:

        *  Require that all implementations support the functionality of the saved set-user-ID, which is set  by
           the <u>exec</u> functions and by privileged calls to <u>setuid</u>().

        *  Add  the <u>seteuid</u>() and <u>setegid</u>() functions as portable alternatives to <u>setuid</u>() and <u>setgid</u>() for non-
           privileged and privileged processes.

       Historical systems have provided two mechanisms for a set-user-ID process to change its effective user ID
       to be the same as its real user ID in such a way that it could return to the original effective user  ID:
       the use of the <u>setuid</u>() function in the presence of a saved set-user-ID, or the use of the BSD <u>setreuid</u>()
       function,  which  was  able to swap the real and effective user IDs. The changes included in POSIX.1‐2008
       provide  a  new  mechanism  using  <u>seteuid</u>()  in  conjunction  with  a  saved  set-user-ID.   Thus,   all
       implementations with the new <u>seteuid</u>() mechanism will have a saved set-user-ID for each process, and most
       of  the  behavior controlled by _POSIX_SAVED_IDS has been changed to agree with the case where the option
       was defined. The <u>kill</u>() function is an exception.  Implementors  of  the  new  <u>seteuid</u>()  mechanism  will
       generally  be  required to maintain compatibility with the older mechanisms previously supported by their
       systems. However, compatibility with this use of <u>setreuid</u>() and with  the  _POSIX_SAVED_IDS  behavior  of
       <u>kill</u>()  is  unfortunately  complicated. If an implementation with a saved set-user-ID allows a process to
       use <u>setreuid</u>() to swap its real and  effective  user  IDs,  but  were  to  leave  the  saved  set-user-ID
       unmodified, the process would then have an effective user ID equal to the original real user ID, and both
       real and saved set-user-ID would be equal to the original effective user ID. In that state, the real user
       would be unable to kill the process, even though the effective user ID of the process matches that of the
       real  user,  if  the  <u>kill</u>() behavior of _POSIX_SAVED_IDS was used. This is obviously not acceptable. The
       alternative choice, which is used in at least one implementation, is to change the saved  set-user-ID  to
       the  effective  user  ID  during  most  calls  to  <u>setreuid</u>().   The  standard developers considered that
       alternative to be less correct than the retention of the old behavior of <u>kill</u>() in such systems.  Current
       conforming  applications shall accommodate either behavior from <u>kill</u>(), and there appears to be no strong
       reason for <u>kill</u>() to check the saved set-user-ID rather than the effective user ID.
