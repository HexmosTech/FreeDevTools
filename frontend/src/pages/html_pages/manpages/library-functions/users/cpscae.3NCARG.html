</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       CPSCAE - Called repeatedly by the routine CPCICA as it executes. Updates a particular element of a user's
       cell array.  The default version of CPSCAE may be replaced by the user with a version that does something
       different.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        CALL CPSCAE (ICRA, ICA1, ICAM, ICAN, XCPF, YCPF, XCQF,
       + YCQF, IND1, IND2, ICAF, IAID)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The first eight arguments of CPSCAE describe the user's cell array and are taken directly from the user's
       call to CPCICA:

       ICRA        (INTEGER  array,  dimensioned ICA1 by "n", where "n" is greater than or equal to the value of
                   the argument ICAN, input/output) is the user's cell array. Generally speaking, a user version
                   of CPSCAE should only reset the value of the single element ICRA(IND1,IND2).

       ICA1        (INTEGER, input) is the first dimension of the FORTRAN array ICRA, which contains the  user's
                   cell array.

       ICAM        (INTEGER, input) is the first dimension of the user's cell array.

       ICAN        (INTEGER, input) is the second dimension of the user's cell array.

       XCPF and YCPF
                   (REAL,  input)  are  the coordinates, in the fractional coordinate system, of a point P. P is
                   the point at that corner of the  rectangular  area  into  which  the  cell  array  maps  that
                   corresponds to the cell (1,1).

       XCQF and YCQF
                   (REAL,  input)  are  the coordinates, in the fractional coordinate system, of a point Q. Q is
                   the point at that corner of the  rectangular  area  into  which  the  cell  array  maps  that
                   corresponds to the cell (ICAM,ICAN).

       IND1 and IND2
                   (INTEGER, input) are the indices of an element in the cell array that is to be reset.

       ICAF        (INTEGER,  input)  is  the  value  of  the internal parameter 'CAF', which will be a negative
                   integer (because, when 'CAF' is greater than or equal to zero,  the  routine  CPSCAE  is  not
                   called).  Different  values  of  'CAF'  may  be  used  in  a user version of CPSCAE to select
                   different schemes for picking color indices.

       IAID        (INTEGER, input) is the value of the area identifier associated with the midpoint of the cell
                   (IND1,IND2). The four possibilities are as described for the routine CPCICA.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       CPSCAE is not called by the user. When a user calls the routine CPCICA and the internal  parameter  'CAF'
       is negative, CPSCAE is called by CPCICA exactly once for each cell in the cell array. The default version
       of CPSCAE just sets the cell's color index equal to the area identifier associated with the cell, if that
       area identifier is greater than or equal to zero; otherwise, it does nothing.  A user-supplied version of
       CPSCAE  may  do  something  more complicated; for example, it may take into account both the value of the
       area identifier associated with the cell and the current value  of  the  color  index  for  the  cell  in
       determining the new value of the color index for the cell.

</pre><h4><b>ACCESS</b></h4><pre>
       To use CPSCAE, load the NCAR Graphics libraries ncarg, ncarg_gks, and ncarg_c, preferably in that order.
