</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       User::Identity::System - physical system of a person

</pre><h4><b>INHERITANCE</b></h4><pre>
        User::Identity::System
          is a User::Identity::Item

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        use User::Identity;
        use User::Identity::System;
        my $me   = User::Identity-&gt;new(...);
        my $server = User::Identity::System-&gt;new(...);
        $me-&gt;add(system =&gt; $server);

        # Simpler

        use User::Identity;
        my $me   = User::Identity-&gt;new(...);
        my $addr = $me-&gt;add(system =&gt; ...);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The "User::Identity::System" object contains the description of the user's presence on a system.  The
       systems are collected by an User::Identity::Collection::Systems object.

       Nearly all methods can return undef.

       Extends "DESCRIPTION" in User::Identity::Item.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       Extends "METHODS" in User::Identity::Item.

   <b>Constructors</b>
       Extends "Constructors" in User::Identity::Item.

       User::Identity::System-&gt;<b>new</b>( [$name], %options )
           Create  a  new  system.   You can specify a name as first argument, or in the OPTION list.  Without a
           specific name, the organization is used as name.

            -Option     --Defined in          --Default
             description  User::Identity::Item  undef
             hostname                           'localhost'
             location                           undef
             name         User::Identity::Item  &lt;required&gt;
             os                                 undef
             parent       User::Identity::Item  undef
             password                           undef
             username                           undef

           description =&gt; STRING
           hostname =&gt; DOMAIN
             The hostname of the described system.  It is preferred to use full system names, not abbreviations.
             For instance, you can better use "www.tux.aq" than "www" to avoid confusion.

           location =&gt; NICKNAME|OBJECT
             The NICKNAME of a  location  which  is  defined  for  the  same  user.   You  can  also  specify  a
             User::Identity::Location OBJECT.

           name =&gt; STRING
           os =&gt; STRING
             The  name  of  the  operating system which is run on the server.  It is advised to use the names as
             used by Perl's $^O variable.  See the perlvar man-page for this  variable,  and  perlport  for  the
             possible values.

           parent =&gt; OBJECT
           password =&gt; STRING
             The  password  to  be used to login.  This password must be un-encoded: directly usable.  Be warned
             that storing un-encoded passwords is a high security list.

           username =&gt; STRING
             The username to be used to login to this host.

   <b>Attributes</b>
       Extends "Attributes" in User::Identity::Item.

       $obj-&gt;<b>description</b>()
           Inherited, see "Attributes" in User::Identity::Item

       $obj-&gt;<b>hostname</b>()
       $obj-&gt;<b>location</b>()
           Returns the object which describes to which location this system relates.  The location may  be  used
           to  find  the  name  of  the  organization  involved,  or  to  create a signature.  If no location is
           specified, undef is returned.

       $obj-&gt;<b>name</b>( [$newname] )
           Inherited, see "Attributes" in User::Identity::Item

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       Error: $object is not a collection.
           The first argument is an object, but not of a class which extends User::Identity::Collection.

       Error: Cannot load collection module for $type ($class).
           Either the specified $type does not exist, or that module named $class  returns  compilation  errors.
           If  the type as specified in the warning is not the name of a package, you specified a nickname which
           was not defined.  Maybe you forgot the 'require' the package which defines the nickname.

       Error: Creation of a collection via $class failed.
           The $class did compile, but it was not possible to create an object of that class using  the  options
           you specified.

       Error: Don't know what type of collection you want to add.
           If you add a collection, it must either by a collection object or a list of options which can be used
           to create a collection object.  In the latter case, the type of collection must be specified.

       Warning: No collection $name
           The collection with $name does not exist and can not be created.
