</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       RT::Extension::MergeUsers - Merges two users into the same effective user

</pre><h4><b>RT</b> <b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       Works with RT 4.0, 4.2, 4.4, 5.0.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This RT extension adds a "Merge Users" box to the User Administration page, which allows you to merge the
       user you are currently viewing with another user on your RT instance.

       It also adds "MergeInto" and "UnMerge" functions to the RT::User class, which allow you to
       programmatically accomplish the same thing from your code.

       It also provides a version of CanonicalizeEmailAddress, which means that all e-mail sent from secondary
       users is displayed as coming from the primary user.

</pre><h4><b>INSTALLATION</b></h4><pre>
       Be sure to also read "UPGRADING" if you are upgrading.

       "perl Makefile.PL"
       "make"
       "make install"
           May need root permissions

       Edit your <u>/opt/rt5/etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm</u>
           If you are using RT 4.2 or greater, add this line:

               Plugin('RT::Extension::MergeUsers');

           For RT 4.0, add this line:

               Set(@Plugins, qw(RT::Extension::MergeUsers));

           or add "RT::Extension::MergeUsers" to your existing @Plugins line.

       Clear your mason cache
               rm -rf /opt/rt5/var/mason_data/obj

       Restart your webserver

</pre><h4><b>UPGRADING</b></h4><pre>
       If  you are upgrading from 0.03_01 or earlier, you must run <u>bin/rt-update-merged-users</u>.  This script will
       create MergedUsers Attributes so RT can know when you're looking at a user that  other  users  have  been
       merged  into.  If  you  don't  run  this script, you'll have issues unmerging users. It can be safely run
       multiple times, it will only create Attributes as needed.

</pre><h4><b>UTILITIES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>rt-clean-merged-users</b>
       When a user with another user merged into it is shredded, the attributes on that user are also  shredded,
       but  the  merged  user will remain, along with attributes that may point to the now missing user id. This
       script cleans up attributes if the merged-into user  record  is  now  gone.  These  users  will  then  be
       converted back to regular unmerged users.

   <b>rt-merge-users</b>
       A command-line tool to merge one user into another

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>RT::Shredder</b> <b>and</b> <b>Merged</b> <b>Users</b>
       Merging a user effectively makes it impossible to load the merged user directly. Attempting to access the
       old  user  resolves  to  the  merged-into  user.  Because of this, MergeUsers has some extra code to help
       RT::Shredder clean up these merged records to avoid leaving merged user records in the DB while  removing
       the user they were merged into.

       When running RT::Shredder on a user record with other users merged into it, the merged users are Unmerged
       before the initial user record is shredded.  There are two options to handle these newly unmerged users:

       1.  Re-run  your shredder command with the same or similar options. The unmerged user records will now be
           accessible and, depending on your shredder options, they will likely be shredded on the  second  run.
           If you have multiple layers of merged users, you may need to run shredder multiple times.

       2.  MergeUsers  will log the unmerged users at the "info" level so you can pull the user ids from the log
           and shred them manually. This is most likely to be useful if you are shredding one specific user (and
           all merged accounts).
