</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       User::Identity::Location - physical location of a person

</pre><h4><b>INHERITANCE</b></h4><pre>
        User::Identity::Location
          is a User::Identity::Item

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        use User::Identity;
        use User::Identity::Location;
        my $me   = User::Identity-&gt;new(...);
        my $addr = User::Identity::Location-&gt;new(...);
        $me-&gt;add(location =&gt; $addr);

        # Simpler

        use User::Identity;
        my $me   = User::Identity-&gt;new(...);
        my $addr = $me-&gt;add(location =&gt; ...);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The "User::Identity::Location" object contains the description of a physical location of a person: home,
       work, travel.  The locations are collected by a User::Identity::Collection::Locations object.

       Nearly all methods can return "undef".  Some methods produce language or country specific output.

       Extends "DESCRIPTION" in User::Identity::Item.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       Extends "METHODS" in User::Identity::Item.

   <b>Constructors</b>
       Extends "Constructors" in User::Identity::Item.

       User::Identity::Location-&gt;<b>new</b>( [$name], %options )
           Create  a  new location.  You can specify a name as first argument, or in the OPTION list.  Without a
           specific name, the organization is used as name.

   <b>Attributes</b>
       Extends "Attributes" in User::Identity::Item.

       $obj-&gt;<b>city</b>()
           The city where the address is located.

       $obj-&gt;<b>country</b>()
           The country where the address is located.  If the name of the country is not known but a country code
           is defined, the name will be looked-up using Geography::Countries (if installed).

       $obj-&gt;<b>countryCode</b>()
           Each country has an ISO standard abbreviation.  Specify the country or  the  country  code,  and  the
           other will be filled in automatically.

       $obj-&gt;<b>description</b>()
           Inherited, see "Attributes" in User::Identity::Item

       $obj-&gt;<b>fax</b>()
           One or more fax numbers, like <b>phone()</b>.

       $obj-&gt;<b>fullAddress</b>()
           Create an address to put on a postal mailing, in the format as normal in the country where it must go
           to.   To be able to achieve that, the country code must be known.  If the city is not specified or no
           street or pobox is given, undef will be returned: an incomplete address.

           example:

            print $uil-&gt;fullAddress;
            print $user-&gt;find(location =&gt; 'home')-&gt;fullAddress;

       $obj-&gt;<b>name</b>( [$newname] )
           Inherited, see "Attributes" in User::Identity::Item

       $obj-&gt;<b>organization</b>()
           The organization (for instance company) which is related to this location.

       $obj-&gt;<b>phone</b>()
           One or more phone numbers.  Please use  the  international  notation,  which  starts  with  '+',  for
           instance "+31-26-12131".  In scalar context, only the first number is produced.  In list context, all
           numbers are presented.

       $obj-&gt;<b>pobox</b>()
           Post Office mail box specification.  Use "P.O.Box 314", not simple 314.

       $obj-&gt;<b>poboxPostalCode</b>()
           The postal code related to the Post-Office mail box.  Defined by <b>new()</b> option "pobox_pc".

       $obj-&gt;<b>postalCode</b>()
           The  postal  code  is  very  country  dependent.  Also, the location of the code within the formatted
           string is country dependent.

       $obj-&gt;<b>state</b>()
           The state, which is important for some countries but certainly not for the smaller  ones.   Only  set
           this value when you state has to appear on printed addresses.

       $obj-&gt;<b>street</b>()
           Returns  the  address of this location.  Since Perl 5.7.3, you can use unicode in strings, so why not
           format the address nicely?

   <b>Collections</b>
       Extends "Collections" in User::Identity::Item.

       $obj-&gt;<b>add</b>($collection, $role)
           Inherited, see "Collections" in User::Identity::Item

       $obj-&gt;<b>addCollection</b>( $object | &lt;[$type], %options&gt; )

           Inherited, see "Collections" in User::Identity::Item

       $obj-&gt;<b>removeCollection</b>($object|$name)
           Inherited, see "Collections" in User::Identity::Item

       $obj-&gt;<b>type</b>()
       User::Identity::Location-&gt;<b>type</b>()
           Inherited, see "Collections" in User::Identity::Item

       $obj-&gt;<b>user</b>()
           Inherited, see "Collections" in User::Identity::Item

   <b>Searching</b>
       Extends "Searching" in User::Identity::Item.

       $obj-&gt;<b>find</b>($collection, $role)
           Inherited, see "Searching" in User::Identity::Item

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       Error: $object is not a collection.
           The first argument is an object, but not of a class which extends User::Identity::Collection.

       Error: Cannot load collection module for $type ($class).
           Either the specified $type does not exist, or that module named $class  returns  compilation  errors.
           If  the type as specified in the warning is not the name of a package, you specified a nickname which
           was not defined.  Maybe you forgot the 'require' the package which defines the nickname.

       Error: Creation of a collection via $class failed.
           The $class did compile, but it was not possible to create an object of that class using  the  options
           you specified.

       Error: Don't know what type of collection you want to add.
           If you add a collection, it must either by a collection object or a list of options which can be used
           to create a collection object.  In the latter case, the type of collection must be specified.

       Warning: No collection $name
           The collection with $name does not exist and can not be created.
