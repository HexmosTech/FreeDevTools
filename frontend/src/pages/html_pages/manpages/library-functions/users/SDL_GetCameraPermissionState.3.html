</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       SDL_GetCameraPermissionState - Query if camera access has been approved by the user.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;SDL3/SDL_camera.h&gt;</b>

       <b>int</b> <b>SDL_GetCameraPermissionState(SDL_Camera</b> <b>*camera);</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Cameras  will  not function between when the device is opened by the app and when the user permits access
       to the hardware. On some platforms, this presents as a popup dialog where  the  user  has  to  explicitly
       approve access; on others the approval might be implicit and not alert the user at all.

       This  function  can  be  used to check the status of that approval. It will return 0 if still waiting for
       user response, 1 if the camera is approved for use, and -1 if the user denied access.

       Instead of  polling  with  this  function,  you  can  wait  for  a  <b>SDL_EVENT_CAMERA_DEVICE_APPROVED</b>  (or
       <b>SDL_EVENT_CAMERA_DEVICE_DENIED</b>) event in the standard SDL event loop, which is guaranteed to be sent once
       when permission to use the camera is decided.

       If a camera is declined, there's nothing to be done but call <b>SDL_CloseCamera</b>() to dispose of it.

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTION</b> <b>PARAMETERS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>camera</u> the opened camera device to query.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       Returns -1 if user denied access to the camera, 1 if user approved access, 0 if no decision has been made
       yet.

</pre><h4><b>THREAD</b> <b>SAFETY</b></h4><pre>
       It is safe to call this function from any thread.

</pre><h4><b>AVAILABILITY</b></h4><pre>
       This function is available since SDL 3.2.0.
