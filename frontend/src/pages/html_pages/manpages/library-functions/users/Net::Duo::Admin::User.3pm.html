</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Net::Duo::Admin::User - Representation of a Duo user

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           my $decoded_json = get_json();
           my $user = Net::Duo::Admin::User-&gt;new($decoded_json);
           say $user-&gt;realname;

</pre><h4><b>REQUIREMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Perl 5.14 or later and the modules HTTP::Request and HTTP::Response (part of HTTP::Message), JSON, LWP
       (also known as libwww-perl), Perl6::Slurp, Sub::Install, and URI::Escape (part of URI), all of which are
       available from CPAN.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       A Net::Duo::Admin::User object is a Perl representation of a Duo user as returned by the Duo Admin API,
       usually via the <b>users()</b> method.  It contains various information about the user, including their groups,
       phones, and tokens.

</pre><h4><b>CLASS</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       create(DUO, DATA)
           Creates  a new user in Duo and returns the resulting user as a new Net::Duo::Admin::User object.  DUO
           is the Net::Duo object that should be used to perform the creation.  DATA is a reference  to  a  hash
           with the following keys:

           email
               The email address of this user.  Optional.

           notes
               Notes about this user.  Optional.

           realname
               The real name of this user.  Optional.

           status
               The status of this user.  See the "<b>status()</b>" method below for the possible values.  Optional, and
               will be set to "active" if no value is given.

           username
               The name of the user to create.  This should be unique within this Duo account and can be used to
               retrieve the user object again using the <b>user()</b> method of Net::Duo::Admin.  Required.

       new(DUO, DATA)
           Creates  a  new  Net::Duo::Admin::User  object from a full data set.  DUO is the Net::Duo object that
           should be used for any further actions on this object.  DATA should be the data structure returned by
           the Duo REST API for a single user, after JSON decoding.

</pre><h4><b>INSTANCE</b> <b>ACTION</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       add_phone(PHONE)
           Associate the Net::Duo::Admin::Phone object PHONE with this user.  Other phones associated with  this
           user will be left unchanged.

       add_token(TOKEN)
           Associate  the Net::Duo::Admin::Token object TOKEN with this user.  Other tokens associated with this
           user will be left unchanged.

       bypass_codes(DATA)
           Requests bypass codes for the user, returning them as a reference to an array.  DATA is  a  reference
           to a hash of parameters chosen from the following keys, all of which are optional:

           count
               The  number  of  bypass codes to request.  At most 10 codes (the default if "codes" is not given)
               can be created at a time.  If this parameter is given, "codes" may not be given.

           codes
               A reference to an array of codes to set as bypass codes for this  user.   If  this  parameter  is
               given, "count" may not be given.

           reuse_count
               The  number of times each code in the list may be reused.  Defaults to 1.  If set to 0, the codes
               may be reused indefinitely.

           valid_secs
               The number of seconds for which these codes will be valid.  If set to 0 (the default), the  codes
               will never expire.

       <b>commit()</b>
           Commit  all  changes  made  via the set_*() methods to Duo.  Until this method is called, any changes
           made via set_*() are only internal to the object and not reflected in Duo.

           After <b>commit()</b>, the internal representation of the object will be refreshed to  match  the  new  data
           returned  by  the  Duo  API  for that object.  Therefore, other fields of the object may change after
           <b>commit()</b> if some other user has changed other, unrelated fields in the object.

           It's best to think of this  method  as  a  synchronize  operation:  changed  data  is  written  back,
           overwriting  what's in Duo, and unchanged data may be overwritten by whatever is currently in Duo, if
           it is different.

       <b>delete()</b>
           Delete this user from Duo.  After successful  completion  of  this  call,  the  Net::Duo::Admin::User
           object  should  be  considered  read-only, since no further changes to the object can be meaningfully
           sent to Duo.

       <b>json()</b>
           Convert the data stored in the object to JSON and return the  results.   The  resulting  JSON  should
           match the JSON that one would get back from the Duo web service when retrieving the same object (plus
           any  changes  made  locally  to  the  object  via  set_*()  methods).  This is primarily intended for
           debugging dumps or for passing Duo objects to other systems via further JSON APIs.

       remove_phone(PHONE)
           Disassociate the Net::Duo::Admin::Phone object PHONE from this user.  Other  phones  associated  with
           this user will be left unchanged.

       remove_token(TOKEN)
           Disassociate  the  Net::Duo::Admin::Token  object TOKEN from this user.  Other tokens associated with
           this user will be left unchanged.

</pre><h4><b>INSTANCE</b> <b>DATA</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       Some fields have set_*() methods.  Those methods replace the value of the field in its entirety with  the
       new value passed in.  This change is only made locally in the object until <b>commit()</b> is called.

       <b>email()</b>
       set_email(EMAIL)
           The user's email address.

       <b>groups()</b>
           List of groups to which this user belongs, as Net::Duo::Admin::Group objects.

       <b>last_login()</b>
           The last time this user logged in, as a UNIX timestamp, or undef if the user has not logged in.

       <b>notes()</b>
       set_notes(NOTES)
           Notes about this user.

       <b>phones()</b>
           List of phones this user can use, as Net::Duo::Admin::Phone objects.

       <b>realname()</b>
       set_realname(NAME)
           The user's real name.

       <b>status()</b>
       set_status(STATUS)
           One of the following values:

           "active"
               The user must complete secondary authentication.

           "bypass"
               The user will bypass secondary authentication after completing primary authentication.

           "disabled"
               The user will not be able to log in.

           "locked out"
               The user has been automatically locked out due to excessive authentication attempts.

       <b>tokens()</b>
           List of tokens this user can use, as Net::Duo::Admin::Token objects.

       <b>user_id()</b>
           The unique ID of this user as generated by Duo on user creation.

       <b>username()</b>
       set_username(USERNAME)
           The username of this user.
