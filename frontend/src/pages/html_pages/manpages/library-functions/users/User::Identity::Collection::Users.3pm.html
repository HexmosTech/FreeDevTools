</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       Error: $object is not a collection.
           The first argument is an object, but not of a class which extends User::Identity::Collection.

       Error: Cannot create a $type to add this to my collection.
           Some  options  are  specified to create a $type object, which is native to this collection.  However,
           for some reason this failed.

       Error: Cannot load collection module for $type ($class).
           Either the specified $type does not exist, or that module named $class  returns  compilation  errors.
           If  the type as specified in the warning is not the name of a package, you specified a nickname which
           was not defined.  Maybe you forgot the 'require' the package which defines the nickname.

       Error: Cannot rename $name into $newname: already exists
       Error: Cannot rename $name into $newname: doesn't exist
       Error: Creation of a collection via $class failed.
           The $class did compile, but it was not possible to create an object of that class using  the  options
           you specified.

       Error: Don't know what type of collection you want to add.
           If you add a collection, it must either by a collection object or a list of options which can be used
           to create a collection object.  In the latter case, the type of collection must be specified.

       Warning: No collection $name
           The collection with $name does not exist and can not be created.

       Error: Wrong type of role for $collection: requires a $expect but got a $type
           Each  $collection  groups  sets of roles of one specific type ($expect).  You cannot add objects of a
           different $type.
