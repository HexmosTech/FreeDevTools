</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       User::Identity::Archive::Plain - simple, plain text archiver

</pre><h4><b>INHERITANCE</b></h4><pre>
        User::Identity::Archive::Plain
          is a User::Identity::Archive
          is a User::Identity::Item

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        use User::Identity::Archive::Plain;
        my $friends = User::Identity::Archive::Plain-&gt;new('friends');
        $friends-&gt;from(\*FH);
        $friends-&gt;from('.friends');

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This archiver, which extends User::Identity::Archive, uses a very simple plain text file to store the
       information of users.  The syntax is described in the DETAILS section, below.

       Extends "DESCRIPTION" in User::Identity::Archive.

</pre><h4><b>OVERLOADED</b></h4><pre>
       Extends "OVERLOADED" in User::Identity::Archive.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       Extends "METHODS" in User::Identity::Archive.

   <b>Constructors</b>
       Extends "Constructors" in User::Identity::Archive.

       User::Identity::Archive::Plain-&gt;<b>new</b>( [$name], %options )
            -Option       --Defined in             --Default
             abbreviations                           []
             description    User::Identity::Item     undef
             from           User::Identity::Archive  undef
             name           User::Identity::Item     &lt;required&gt;
             only                                    []
             parent         User::Identity::Item     undef
             tabstop                                 8

           abbreviations =&gt; HASH|ARRAY
             Adds  a set of abbreviations for collections to the syntax of the plain text archiver.  See section
             "Simplified class names" for a list of predefined names.

           description =&gt; STRING
           from =&gt; FILEHANDLE|FILENAME
           name =&gt; STRING
           only =&gt; ARRAY|ABBREV
             Lists the only information (as (list of) abbreviations) which should be read.  Other information is
             removed before even checking whether it is a valid abbreviation or not.

           parent =&gt; OBJECT
           tabstop =&gt; INTEGER
             Sets the default tab-stop width.

   <b>Attributes</b>
       Extends "Attributes" in User::Identity::Archive.

       $obj-&gt;<b>abbreviation</b>( $name, [$class] )
           Returns the class which is capable of storing information which is grouped  as  $name.   With  $class
           argument,  you  add  (or  overrule)  the definitions of an abbreviation.  The $class is automatically
           loaded.

           If $class is "undef", then the abbreviation is deleted.  The class name which is deleted is returned.

       $obj-&gt;<b>abbreviations</b>()
           Returns a sorted list of all names which are known as abbreviations.

       $obj-&gt;<b>defaultTabStop</b>( [$integer] )
           Returns the width of a tab, optionally after setting it.  This must  be  the  same  as  set  in  your
           editor.

           Inherited, see "Attributes" in User::Identity::Item

       $obj-&gt;<b>name</b>( [$newname] )
           Inherited, see "Attributes" in User::Identity::Item

   <b>Collections</b>

</pre><h4><b>DETAILS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>The</b> <b>Plain</b> <b>Archiver</b> <b>Format</b>
       <u>Simplified</u> <u>class</u> <u>names</u>

       It  is  too much work to specify full class named on each spot where you want to create a new object with
       data.  Therefore, abbreviations are introduced.  Use new(abbreviations) or <b>abbreviations()</b> to  add  extra
       abbreviations or to overrule some predefined.

       Predefined names:
         user         User::Identity
         email        Mail::Identity
         location     User::Identity::Location
         system       User::Identity::System
         list         User::Identity::Collection::Emails

       It would have been nicer to refer to a <u>person</u> in stead of a <u>user</u>, however that would add to the confusion
       with the name-space.

       <u>Indentation</u> <u>says</u> <u>all</u>

       The syntax is as simple as possible. An extra indentation on a line means that the variable or class is a
       collection within the class on the line before.

        user markov
          location home
             country NL
          email home
             address  <a href="mailto:mark@overmeer.net">mark@overmeer.net</a>
             location home
          email work
             address  <a href="mailto:solutions@overmeer.bet">solutions@overmeer.bet</a>

        email tux
           address <a href="mailto:tux@fish.net">tux@fish.net</a>

       The  above  defines  two items: one User::Identity named "markov", and an e-mail address "tux".  The user
       has two collections: one contains a single location, and one stores two e-mail addresses.

       To add to the confusion: the "location" is defined as field in "email" and as collection.  The difference
       is easily detected: if there are indented fields following the line it is a collection.  Mistakes will in
       most cases result in an error message.

       <u>Long</u> <u>lines</u>

       If you want to continue on the next line, because your content is too large, then add a backslash to  the
       end, like this:

        email home
           description This is my home address,     \
                       But I sometimes use this for \
                       work as well
           address <a href="mailto:tux@fish.aq">tux@fish.aq</a>

       Continuations do not play the game of indentation, so what you also can do is:

        email home
           description               \
        This is my home address,     \
        But I sometimes use this for \
        work as well
           address <a href="mailto:tux@fish.aq">tux@fish.aq</a>

       The  fields "comment" and "address" must be correctly indented.  The line terminations are lost, which is
       useful for most fields.  However, if you need them, you have to check the description of  the  applicable
       field.

       <u>Comments</u>

       You  may  add  comments  and white spaces.  Comments start with a '#' as first non-blank character on the
       line.  Comments are <b>not</b> <b>allowed</b> on the same line as real data, as some languages (like Perl) permit.

       You can insert comments and blank lines on all places where you need them:

        user markov

           # my home address
           email home

              # useless comment statement
              address <a href="mailto:tux@fish.aq">tux@fish.aq</a>
              location #mind_the_hash

       is equivalent to:

        user markov
           email home
              address <a href="mailto:tux@fish.aq">tux@fish.aq</a>
              location #mind_the_hash

       <u>References</u>

       Often you will have the need to add the same information to two  items,  for  instance,  multiple  people
       share  the  same address.  In this case, you can create a reference.  However, this is only permitted for
       whole items: you can refer to someone's location, but not to the person's street.

       To create a reference to an item of someone else, use

        user markov
           location home = user(cleo).location(home)
           location work
              organization   MARKOV Solutions

       <u>Configuration</u> <u>parameters</u>

       You can add some configuration lines as well.  On the moment, the only one defined is

        tabstop = 4

       which can be used to change the meaning of tabs in the file.  The default setting is 8, but  some  people
       prefer 4 (or other values).

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       Error: $object is not a collection.
           The first argument is an object, but not of a class which extends User::Identity::Collection.

       Error: Cannot load collection module for $type ($class).
           Either  the  specified  $type does not exist, or that module named $class returns compilation errors.
           If the type as specified in the warning is not the name of a package, you specified a nickname  which
           was not defined.  Maybe you forgot the 'require' the package which defines the nickname.

       Warning: Cannot read archive from $source
       Error: Creation of a collection via $class failed.
           The  $class  did compile, but it was not possible to create an object of that class using the options
           you specified.

       Error: Don't know what type of collection you want to add.
           If you add a collection, it must either by a collection object or a list of options which can be used
           to create a collection object.  In the latter case, the type of collection must be specified.

       Warning: No collection $name
           The collection with $name does not exist and can not be created.
