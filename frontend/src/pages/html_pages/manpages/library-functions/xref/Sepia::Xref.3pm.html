</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Sepia::Xref - Generates cross reference database for use by Perl programs.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Sepia::Xref qw(rebuild defs callers);

           rebuild;
           for (defs 'foo') {
               printf "%s:%d: sub %s\::foo() defined\n", @{$_}[0..2];
           }

           for (callers 'foo') {
               printf "%s:%d: sub foo() called by %s\::%s().\n", @{$_}[0..3];
           }

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       "Sepia::Xref" is intended as a programmatic interface to the information supplied by B::Xref.  It is
       intended to be a component for interactive Perl development, with other packages providing a friendly
       interface to the raw information it extracts.  "B::Xref" could be seen as an example of this sort of
       user-level tool, if it weren't for the fact that this module was created later, and stole most of its
       code.

   <b>Variables</b>
       %call
           A map of subs to call locations and callers

       %callby
           A map of subs to subs called.

       %var_use
           A map of global/package variables to uses.

       %var_def
           A  map  of global/package variables to definitions (usually empty, since it only picks up local (...)
           declarations.

   <b>Functions</b>
       "guess_module_file($pack, $ofile)"
           XXX: it turns out that rooting around trying to figure out the file ourselves is more  reliable  than
           what we grab from the op.  Are we doing this wrong?

       "rebuild()"
           Rebuild the Xref database.

       "forget($func [, $mod])"
           Forget that $func was defined.

       "redefined($func [, $pack])"
           Recompute xref info for $func, or "$pack::$func" if $pack given.

       "callers($func)"
           List callers of $func.

       "callees($func)"
           List callees of $func.

       "var_defs($var)"
           Find locations where $var is defined.

       "var_uses($var)"
           Find locations where $var is used.

       "var_assigns($var)"
           Find locations where $var is assigned to.

       "file_modules($file)"
           List the modules defined in file $file.

       "var_apropos($expr)"
           Find variables matching $expr.

</pre><h4><b>EXPORTS</b></h4><pre>
       Nothing by default, but all sub and variable described above can be imported.  "Sepia::Xref" also defines
       the tags ":most" for the above-listed functions, and ":all" for those and the variables as well.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       See B::Xref.
       module names are ignored when looking up a sub.
       file and line number guessing is evil
           Both  should  be  done more cleanly and effectively.  This is a hack because I don't quite understand
           what perl saves.  We should be able to do as well as its warning messages.

       Some packages are not xref'd.
           Some "internal" packages are deliberately not cross-referenced, either because  they  are  hairy  and
           cause us problems, or because they are so commonly included as to be uninteresting.  The current list
           includes  all  pragmatic  modules,  plus:  B,  O,  AutoLoader, DynaLoader, XSLoader, Config, DB, VMS,
           FileHandle, Exporter, Carp, PerlIO::Layer.

       Tree-view is not fully functional
           Ideally, clicking the function names in tree view would take you  to  that  function.   This  doesn't
           work.  Also, more keys (like "q" to quit) should be implemented.
