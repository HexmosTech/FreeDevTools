</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Email::Sender::Transport::Test - deliver mail in memory for testing

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 2.601

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This transport is meant for testing email deliveries in memory.  It will store a record of any delivery
       made so that they can be inspected afterward.

</pre><h4><b>PERL</b> <b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This library should run on perls released even a long time ago.  It should work on any version of perl
       released in the last five years.

       Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made that the minimum required version
       will not be increased.  The version may be increased for any reason, and there is no promise that patches
       will be accepted to lower the minimum required perl.

</pre><h4><b>ATTRIBUTES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>deliveries</b>
       By default, the Test transport will not allow partial success and will always succeed.  It can be made to
       fail predictably, however, if it is extended and its "recipient_failure" or "delivery_failure" methods
       are overridden.  These methods are called as follows:

         $self-&gt;delivery_failure($email, $envelope);

         $self-&gt;recipient_failure($to);

       If they return true, the sending will fail.  If the transport was created with a true
       "allow_partial_success" attribute, recipient failures can cause partial success to be returned.

       For more flexible failure modes, you can override more aggressively or can use
       Email::Sender::Transport::Failable.

       This attribute stores an arrayref of all the deliveries made via the transport.  The "clear_deliveries"
       method returns a list of them.

       Each delivery is a hashref, in the following format:

         {
           email     =&gt; $email,
           envelope  =&gt; $envelope,
           successes =&gt; \@ok_rcpts,
           failures  =&gt; \@failures,
         }

       Both successful and failed deliveries are stored.

       A number of methods related to this attribute are provided:

       •   delivery_count

       •   clear_deliveries

       •   shift_deliveries
