</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       SOAP::WSDL::Factory::Transport - Factory for retrieving transport objects

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        # from SOAP::WSDL::Client:
        $transport = SOAP::WSDL::Factory::Transport-&gt;get_transport( $url, @opt );

        # in transport class:
        package MyWickedTransport;
        use SOAP::WSDL::Factory::Transport;

        # register class as transport module for httpr and https
        # (httpr is "reliable http", a protocol developed by IBM).
        SOAP::WSDL::Factory::Transport-&gt;register( 'httpr' , __PACKAGE__ );
        SOAP::WSDL::Factory::Transport-&gt;register( 'https' , __PACKAGE__ );

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       SOAP::WSDL::Transport serves as factory for retrieving transport objects for SOAP::WSDL.

       The actual work is done by specific transport classes.

       SOAP::WSDL::Transport tries to load one of the following classes:

       •   the class registered for the scheme via <b>register()</b>

       •   the SOAP::Lite class matching the scheme

       •   the SOAP::WSDL class matching the scheme

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>register</b>
        SOAP::WSDL::Transport-&gt;register('https', 'MyWickedTransport');

       Globally registers a class for use as transport class.

   <b>proxy</b>
        $trans-&gt;proxy('<a href="http://soap-wsdl.sourceforge.net">http://soap-wsdl.sourceforge.net</a>');

       Sets the proxy (endpoint).

       Returns the transport for this protocol.

   <b>set_transport</b>
       Sets the current transport object.

   <b>get_transport</b>
       Gets the current transport object.

</pre><h4><b>WRITING</b> <b>YOUR</b> <b>OWN</b> <b>TRANSPORT</b> <b>CLASS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Registering</b> <b>a</b> <b>transport</b> <b>class</b>
       Transport classes must be registered with SOAP::WSDL::Factory::Transport.

       This  is  done  by  executing the following code where $scheme is the URL scheme the class should be used
       for, and $module is the class' module name.

        SOAP::WSDL::Factory::Transport-&gt;register( $scheme, $module);

       To auto-register your transport class on loading, execute <b>register()</b> in your tranport class (see SYNOPSIS
       above).

       Multiple protocols or multiple classes are registered by multiple calls to <b>register()</b>.

   <b>Transport</b> <b>plugin</b> <b>package</b> <b>layout</b>
       You may only use transport classes whose name  is  either  the  module  name  or  the  module  name  with
       '::Client' appended.

   <b>Methods</b> <b>to</b> <b>implement</b>
       Transport   classes  must  implement  the  interface  required  for  SOAP::Lite  transport  classes  (see
       SOAP::Lite::Transport for details, SOAP::WSDL::Transport::HTTP for an example).

       To provide this interface, transport modules must implement the following methods:

       •   new

       •   send_receive

           Dispatches a request and returns the content of the response.

       •   code

           Returns the status code of the last send_receive call (if any).

       •   message

           Returns the status message of the last send_receive call (if any).

       •   status

           Returns the status of the last send_receive call (if any).

       •   is_success

           Returns true after a send_receive was successful, false if it was not.

       SOAP::Lite requires transport modules to pack client and server classes in one file, and to  follow  this
       naming scheme:

        Module name:
          "SOAP::Transport::" . uc($scheme)

        Client class (additional package in module):
          "SOAP::Transport::" . uc($scheme) . "::Client"

        Server class (additional package in module):
          "SOAP::Transport::" . uc($scheme) . "::Client"

       SOAP::WSDL does not require you to follow these restrictions.

       There is only one restriction in SOAP::WSDL:

       You  may  only  use  transport  classes  whose  name  is  either  the module name or the module name with
       '::Client' appended.

       SOAP::WSDL will try to instantiate an object of your transport class with '::Client'  appended  to  allow
       using transport classes written for SOAP::Lite.

       This  may  lead  to  errors  when a different module with the name of your transport module suffixed with
       ::Client is also loaded.
