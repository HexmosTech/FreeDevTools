</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       fltk - the fast light tool kit

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       The  Fast  Light  Tool  Kit  ("FLTK")  is  a cross-platform C++ GUI toolkit for UNIX(r)/Linux(r) (X11 and
       Wayland), Microsoft(r) Windows(r), and macOS(r).  FLTK provides modern GUI  functionality  without  bloat
       and  supports  3D graphics via OpenGL(r) and its built-in GLUT emulation.  It was originally developed by
       Mr. Bill Spitzak and is currently maintained by a small group of  developers  across  the  world  with  a
       central repository on GitHub.

       FLTK  is  provided  under  the  terms  of  the  GNU  Library  General  Public License, with the following
       exceptions:

              1. Modifications to the FLTK configure script, config header file, and makefiles by themselves  to
              support a specific platform do not constitute a modified or derivative work.

              The  authors  do  request  that  such  modifications be contributed to the FLTK project - send all
              contributions through the "Software Trouble Report" on the following page:

                  https://www.fltk.org/bugs.php

              2. Widgets that are subclassed from FLTK widgets do not constitute a derivative work.

              3. Static linking of applications and widgets to the FLTK library does not constitute a derivative
              work and does not require the author to provide source code for the application or widget, use the
              shared FLTK libraries, or link their applications or widgets against a  user-supplied  version  of
              FLTK.

              If you link the application or widget to a modified version of FLTK, then the changes to FLTK must
              be provided under the terms of the LGPL in sections 1, 2, and 4.

              4. You do not have to provide a copy of the FLTK license with programs that are linked to the FLTK
              library, nor do you have to identify the FLTK license in your program or documentation as required
              by section 6 of the LGPL.

              However,  programs  must  still identify their use of FLTK. The following example statement can be
              included in user documentation to satisfy this requirement:

              [program/widget] is based in part on the work of the FLTK project (https://www.fltk.org).
