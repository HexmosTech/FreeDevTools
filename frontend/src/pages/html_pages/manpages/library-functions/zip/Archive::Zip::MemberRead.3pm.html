</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Archive::Zip::MemberRead - A wrapper that lets you read Zip archive members as if they were files.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Archive::Zip;
         use Archive::Zip::MemberRead;
         $zip = Archive::Zip-&gt;new("file.zip");
         $fh  = Archive::Zip::MemberRead-&gt;new($zip, "subdir/abc.txt");
         while (defined($line = $fh-&gt;getline()))
         {
             print $fh-&gt;input_line_number . "#: $line\n";
         }

         $read = $fh-&gt;read($buffer, 32*1024);
         print "Read $read bytes as :$buffer:\n";

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The Archive::Zip::MemberRead module lets you read Zip archive member data just like you read data from
       files.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Archive::Zip::Member::readFileHandle()</b>
           You can get a "Archive::Zip::MemberRead" from an archive member by calling "readFileHandle()":

             my $member = $zip-&gt;memberNamed('abc/def.c');
             my $fh = $member-&gt;readFileHandle();
             while (defined($line = $fh-&gt;getline()))
             {
                 # ...
             }
             $fh-&gt;close();

       Archive::Zip::MemberRead-&gt;new($zip, $fileName)
       Archive::Zip::MemberRead-&gt;new($zip, $member)
       Archive::Zip::MemberRead-&gt;new($member)
           Construct a new Archive::Zip::MemberRead on the specified member.

             my $fh = Archive::Zip::MemberRead-&gt;new($zip, 'fred.c')

       setLineEnd(expr)
           Set the line end character to use. This is set to \n by default except on Windows systems where it is
           set  to  \r\n.  You  will  only  need  to set this on systems which are not Windows or Unix based and
           require   a   line   end   different   from   \n.    This   is   a   class   method   so   call    as
           "Archive::Zip::MemberRead"-&gt;"setLineEnd($nl)"

       <b>rewind()</b>
           Rewinds an "Archive::Zip::MemberRead" so that you can read from it again starting at the beginning.

       input_record_separator(expr)
           If  the argument is given, input_record_separator for this instance is set to it. The current setting
           (which may be the global $/) is always returned.

       <b>input_line_number()</b>
           Returns the current line number, but only if you're  using  "getline()".   Using  "read()"  will  not
           update the line number.

       <b>close()</b>
           Closes the given file handle.

       buffer_size([ $size ])
           Gets or sets the buffer size used for reads.  Default is the chunk size used by Archive::Zip.

       <b>getline()</b>
           Returns the next line from the currently open member.  Makes sense only for text files.  A read error
           is  considered  fatal  enough to die.  Returns undef on eof. All subsequent calls would return undef,
           unless a <b>rewind()</b> is called.  Note:  The  line  returned  has  the  input_record_separator  (default:
           newline) removed.

       getline( { preserve_line_ending =&gt; 1 } )
           Returns the next line including the line ending.

       read($buffer, $num_bytes_to_read)
           Simulates  a normal "read()" system call.  Returns the no. of bytes read. "undef" on error, 0 on eof,
           <u>e.g.</u>:

             $fh = Archive::Zip::MemberRead-&gt;new($zip, "sreeji/secrets.bin");
             while (1)
             {
               $read = $fh-&gt;read($buffer, 1024);
               die "FATAL ERROR reading my secrets !\n" if (!defined($read));
               last if (!$read);
               # Do processing.
               ....
              }
