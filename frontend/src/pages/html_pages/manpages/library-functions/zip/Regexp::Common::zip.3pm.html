</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Regexp::Common::zip -- provide regexes for postal codes.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Regexp::Common qw /zip/;

           while (&lt;&gt;) {
               /^$RE{zip}{Netherlands}$/   and  print "Dutch postal code\n";
           }

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Please consult the manual of Regexp::Common for a general description of the works of this interface.

       Do not use this module directly, but load it via <u>Regexp::Common</u>.

       This module offers patterns for zip or postal codes of many different countries. They all have the form
       "$RE{zip}{Country}[{options}]".

       The following common options are used:

   <b>"{-prefix=[yes|no|allow]}"</b> <b>and</b> <b>"{-country=PAT}".</b>
       Postal codes can be prefixed with a country abbreviation. That is, a Dutch postal code of <b>1234</b> <b>AB</b> can
       also be written as <b>NL-1234</b> <b>AB</b>.  By default, all the patterns will allow the prefixes. But this can be
       changed with the "-prefix" option. With "-prefix=yes", the returned pattern requires a country prefix,
       while "-prefix=no" disallows a prefix. Any argument that doesn't start with a "y" or a "n" allows a
       country prefix, but doesn't require them.

       The prefixes used are, unfortunately, not always the same. Officially, ISO country codes need to be used,
       but the usage of <u>CEPT</u> codes (the same ones as used on cars) is common too. By default, each postal code
       will recognize a country prefix that's either the ISO standard or the CEPT code. That is, German postal
       codes may prefixed with either "DE" or "D". The recognized prefix can be changed with the "-country"
       option, which takes a (sub)pattern as argument. The arguments "iso" and "cept" are special, and indicate
       the language prefix should be the ISO country code, or the CEPT code.

       Examples:
        /$RE{zip}{Netherlands}/;
                  # Matches '1234 AB' and 'NL-1234 AB'.
        /$RE{zip}{Netherlands}{-prefix =&gt; 'no'}/;
                  # Matches '1234 AB' but not 'NL-1234 AB'.
        /$RE{zip}{Netherlands}{-prefix =&gt; 'yes'}/;
                  # Matches 'NL-1234 AB' but not '1234 AB'.

        /$RE{zip}{Germany}/;
                  # Matches 'DE-12345' and 'D-12345'.
        /$RE{zip}{Germany}{-country =&gt; 'iso'}/;
                  # Matches 'DE-12345' but not 'D-12345'.
        /$RE{zip}{Germany}{-country =&gt; 'cept'}/;
                  # Matches 'D-12345' but not 'DE-12345'.
        /$RE{zip}{Germany}{-country =&gt; 'GER'}/;
                  # Matches 'GER-12345'.

   <b>"{-sep=PAT}"</b>
       Some countries have postal codes that consist of two parts. Typically there is an official way of
       separating those parts; but in practise people tend to use different separators. For instance, if the
       official way to separate parts is to use a space, it happens that the space is left off. The "-sep"
       option can be given a pattern as argument which indicates what to use as a separator between the parts.

       Examples:
        /$RE{zip}{Netherlands}/;
                  # Matches '1234 AB' but not '1234AB'.
        /$RE{zip}{Netherlands}{-sep =&gt; '\s*'}/;
                  # Matches '1234 AB' and '1234AB'.

   <b>"$RE{zip}{Australia}{-lax}"</b>
       Returns a pattern that recognizes Australian postal codes. Australian postal codes consist of four
       digits; the first two digits, which range from '10' to '97', indicate the state, although there are
       exceptions.  Territories use '02' or '08' as starting digits. '0909' is the only postal code starting
       with '09' - this is the postal code for the Northern Territory University). The (optional) country
       prefixes are <u>AU</u> (ISO country code) and <u>AUS</u> (CEPT code).

       It the past, it was claimed that for postal codes starting with a 0, the leading 0 may be omitted, and up
       to (and including) version 2016060201, the leading 0 was optional. But there doesn't seem be solid
       evidence the leading 0 is optional. So, we now require there always to be four digit -- unless the
       "{-lax}" option is given, then a possibly leading 0 is optional.

       Regexp::Common 2.107 and before used "$RE{zip}{Australian}". This is still supported.

       If "{-keep}" is used, the following variables will be set:

       $1  The entire postal code.

       $2  The country code prefix.

       $3  The postal code without the country prefix.

       As of version 2016060201, no $4 or $5 will be set.

   <b>"$RE</b> <b>{zip}</b> <b>{Austria}"</b>
       Returns a pattern which recognizes Austrian postal codes. Austrian postal codes consists of 4 digits, but
       not  all  possibilities  are  used.  This pattern matches the postal codes in use. The (optional) country
       prefixes are <u>AT</u> (ISO country code) and <u>AUT</u> (CEPT code).

       If "{-keep}" is used, the following variables will be set:

       $1  The entire postal code.

       $2  The country code prefix.

       $3  The postal code without the country code prefix.

   <b>"$RE{zip}{Belgium}"</b>
       Returns a pattern than recognizes Belgian postal codes. Belgian postal codes  consist  of  4  digits,  of
       which  the first indicates the province.  The (optional) country prefixes are <u>BE</u> (ISO country code) and <u>B</u>
       (CEPT code).

       If "{-keep}" is used, the following variables will be set:

       $1  The entire postal code.

       $2  The country code prefix.

       $3  The postal code without the country prefix.

   <b>"$RE{zip}{Denmark}"</b>
       Returns a pattern that recognizes Danish postal codes. Danish postal codes consist of four  numbers;  the
       first  digit  indicates  the  distribution  region,  the second the distribution district. The (optional)
       country prefix is <u>DK</u>, which is both the ISO country code and the CEPT code.

       If "{-keep}" is used, the following variables will be set:

       $1  The entire postal code.

       $2  The country code prefix.

       $3  The postal code without the country prefix.

       Danish postal codes will not start with 39. Postal codes of the form 39XX are  reserved  from  Greenland;
       the pattern for Danish postal codes will not recognize them.

   <b>"$RE{zip}{France}"</b>
       Returns  a  pattern that recognizes French postal codes. French postal codes consist of five numbers; the
       first two numbers, which range from '01'  to  '98',  indicate  the  department.  The  (optional)  country
       prefixes  are  <u>FR</u>  (ISO  country  code)  and  <u>F</u>  (CEPT  code).   Regexp::Common  2.107  and  before  used
       "$RE{zip}{French}". This is still supported.

       Monaco uses postal codes which are part of the numbering system used by the French  postal  code  system;
       their numbers start with 980. These numbers are "not" recognized by this pattern.

       If "{-keep}" is used, the following variables will be set:

       system. Postal codes starting with 39 are reserved for Greenland, and all Greenlandic postal codes  start
       with 39. Except the postal code for Santa. He uses 2412.

       The (optional) country prefix is <u>GL</u>, which is use both as the ISO country code and the CEPT code. Earlier
       versions used <u>DK</u> as the prefix.

       If "{-keep}" is used, the following variables will be set:

       $1  The entire postal code.

       $2  The country code prefix.

       for small places, alphabetically for the rest).

       Codes  starting  with  4789  are postal codes for San Marino; they are not recognized by the pattern. Use
