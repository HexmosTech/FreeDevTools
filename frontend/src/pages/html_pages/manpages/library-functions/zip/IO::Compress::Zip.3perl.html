</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module provides a Perl interface that allows writing zip compressed data to files or buffer.

       The primary purpose of this module is to provide streaming write access to zip files and buffers.

       At present the following compression methods are supported by IO::Compress::Zip

       Store (0)
       Deflate (8)
       Bzip2 (12)
            To write Bzip2 content, the module "IO::Uncompress::Bunzip2" must be installed.

       Lzma (14)
            To write LZMA content, the module "IO::Uncompress::UnLzma" must be installed.

       Zstandard (93)
            To write Zstandard content, the module "IO::Compress::Zstd" must be installed.

       Xz (95)
            To write Xz content, the module "IO::Uncompress::UnXz" must be installed.

       For reading zip files/buffers, see the companion module IO::Uncompress::Unzip.

</pre><h4><b>Functional</b> <b>Interface</b></h4><pre>
       A  top-level  function,  "zip",  is  provided  to carry out "one-shot" compression between buffers and/or
       files. For finer control over the compression process, see the "OO Interface" section.

           use IO::Compress::Zip qw(zip $ZipError) ;

           zip $input_filename_or_reference =&gt; $output_filename_or_reference [,OPTS]
               or die "zip failed: $ZipError\n";

       The functional interface needs Perl5.005 or better.

   <b>zip</b> <b>$input_filename_or_reference</b> <b>=&gt;</b> <b>$output_filename_or_reference</b> <b>[,</b> <b>OPTS]</b>
       "zip" expects at least two parameters, $input_filename_or_reference and $output_filename_or_reference and
       zero or more optional parameters (see "Optional Parameters")

       <u>The</u> <u>$input_filename_or_reference</u> <u>parameter</u>

       The parameter, $input_filename_or_reference, is used to define the source of the uncompressed data.

       It can take one of the following forms:

       A filename
            If the $input_filename_or_reference parameter is a simple scalar, it is assumed to  be  a  filename.
            This file will be opened for reading and the input data will be read from it.

       A filehandle
            If  the $input_filename_or_reference parameter is a filehandle, the input data will be read from it.
            The string '-' can be used as an alias for standard input.

       A scalar reference
            If  $input_filename_or_reference  is  a  scalar  reference,  the  input  data  will  be  read   from
            $$input_filename_or_reference.

       An array reference
            If $input_filename_or_reference is an array reference, each element in the array must be a filename.

            The input data will be read from each file in turn.

            The complete array will be walked to ensure that it only contains valid filenames before any data is
            compressed.

       An Input FileGlob string
            If  $input_filename_or_reference  is  a string that is delimited by the characters "&lt;" and "&gt;" "zip"
            will assume that it is an <u>input</u> <u>fileglob</u> <u>string</u>. The input is the  list  of  files  that  match  the
            fileglob.

            See File::GlobMapper for more details.

       If the $input_filename_or_reference parameter is any other type, "undef" will be returned.

       In  addition,  if $input_filename_or_reference corresponds to a filename from the filesystem, a number of
       zip file header fields will be populated by default using the following attributes from the input file

       •    the full filename contained in $input_filename_or_reference

       •    the file protection attributes

       •    the UID/GID for the file

       •    the file timestamps

       If you do not want to use these defaults they can be overridden by explicitly setting one,  or  more,  of
       the  "Name",  "Time",  "TextFlag",  "ExtAttr", "exUnixN" and "exTime" options or by setting the "Minimal"
       parameter.

       <u>The</u> <u>$output_filename_or_reference</u> <u>parameter</u>

       The parameter $output_filename_or_reference is used to control the destination of  the  compressed  data.
       This parameter can take one of these forms.

       A filename
            If  the  $output_filename_or_reference parameter is a simple scalar, it is assumed to be a filename.
            This file will be opened for writing and the compressed data will be written to it.

       A filehandle
            If the $output_filename_or_reference parameter is a filehandle, the compressed data will be  written
            to it.  The string '-' can be used as an alias for standard output.

       A scalar reference
            If  $output_filename_or_reference  is  a  scalar  reference,  the  compressed data will be stored in
            $$output_filename_or_reference.

       An Array Reference
            If $output_filename_or_reference is an array reference, the compressed data will be pushed onto  the
            array.

       An Output FileGlob
            If  $output_filename_or_reference  is a string that is delimited by the characters "&lt;" and "&gt;" "zip"
            will assume that it is an <u>output</u> <u>fileglob</u> <u>string</u>. The output is the list of  files  that  match  the
            fileglob.

            When  $output_filename_or_reference is an fileglob string, $input_filename_or_reference must also be
            a fileglob string. Anything else is an error.

            See File::GlobMapper for more details.

       If the $output_filename_or_reference parameter is any other type, "undef" will be returned.

   <b>Notes</b>
       When $input_filename_or_reference maps to multiple files/buffers and $output_filename_or_reference  is  a
       single  file/buffer  the  input  files/buffers  will each be stored in $output_filename_or_reference as a
       distinct entry.

   <b>Optional</b> <b>Parameters</b>
       The optional parameters for the one-shot function "zip" are (for the most part) identical to  those  used
       with the OO interface defined in the "Constructor Options" section. The exceptions are listed below

       "AutoClose =&gt; 0|1"
            This option applies to any input or output data streams to "zip" that are filehandles.

            If  "AutoClose"  is  specified,  and  the  value  is true, it will result in all input and/or output
            filehandles being closed once "zip" has completed.

            This parameter defaults to 0.

       "BinModeIn =&gt; 0|1"
            This option is now a no-op. All files will be read in binmode.

       "Append =&gt; 0|1"
            The behaviour of this option is dependent on the type of output data stream.

            •    A Buffer

                 If "Append" is enabled, all compressed data will be append to the end  of  the  output  buffer.
                 Otherwise the output buffer will be cleared before any compressed data is written to it.

            •    A Filename

                 If  "Append"  is enabled, the file will be opened in append mode. Otherwise the contents of the
                 file, if any, will be truncated before any compressed data is written to it.

            •    A Filehandle

                 If "Append" is enabled, the filehandle will be positioned to the end of the file via a call  to
                 "seek"  before  any  compressed  data is written to it.  Otherwise the file pointer will not be
                 moved.

            When "Append" is specified, and set to true, it will <u>append</u> all compressed data to the  output  data
            stream.

            So when the output is a filehandle it will carry out a seek to the eof before writing any compressed
            data.  If  the output is a filename, it will be opened for appending. If the output is a buffer, all
            compressed data will be appended to the existing buffer.

            Conversely when "Append" is not specified, or it is present and is set to false, it will operate  as
            follows.

            When  the  output  is  a  filename,  it  will  truncate  the contents of the file before writing any
            compressed data. If the output is a filehandle its position will not be changed. If the output is  a
            buffer, it will be wiped before any compressed data is output.

            Defaults to 0.

   <b>Oneshot</b> <b>Examples</b>
       Here are a few example that show the capabilities of the module.

       <u>Streaming</u>

       This  very  simple  command line example demonstrates the streaming capabilities of the module.  The code
       reads data from STDIN, compresses it, and writes the compressed data to STDOUT.

           $ echo hello world | perl -MIO::Compress::Zip=zip -e 'zip \*STDIN =&gt; \*STDOUT' &gt;output.zip

       The special filename "-" can be used as a standin for both "\*STDIN" and "\*STDOUT", so the above can  be
       rewritten as

           $ echo hello world | perl -MIO::Compress::Zip=zip -e 'zip "-" =&gt; "-"' &gt;output.zip

       One  problem  with  creating  a  zip  archive  directly  from STDIN can be demonstrated by looking at the
       contents of the zip file, output.zip, that we have just created.

           $ unzip -l output.zip
           Archive:  output.zip
           Length      Date    Time    Name
           ---------  ---------- -----   ----
               12  2019-08-16 22:21
           ---------                     -------
               12                     1 file

       The archive member (filename) used is the empty string.

       If that doesn't suit your needs, you can  explicitly  set  the  filename  used  in  the  zip  archive  by
       specifying the Name option, like so

           echo hello world | perl -MIO::Compress::Zip=zip -e 'zip "-" =&gt; "-", Name =&gt; "hello.txt"' &gt;output.zip

       Now the contents of the zip file looks like this

           $ unzip -l output.zip
           Archive:  output.zip
           Length      Date    Time    Name
           ---------  ---------- -----   ----
               12  2019-08-16 22:22   hello.txt
           ---------                     -------
               12                     1 file

       <u>Compressing</u> <u>a</u> <u>file</u> <u>from</u> <u>the</u> <u>filesystem</u>

       To read the contents of the file "file1.txt" and write the compressed data to the file "file1.txt.zip".

           use strict ;
           use warnings ;
           use IO::Compress::Zip qw(zip $ZipError) ;

           my $input = "file1.txt";
           zip $input =&gt; "$input.zip"
               or die "zip failed: $ZipError\n";

       <u>Reading</u> <u>from</u> <u>a</u> <u>Filehandle</u> <u>and</u> <u>writing</u> <u>to</u> <u>an</u> <u>in-memory</u> <u>buffer</u>

       To read from an existing Perl filehandle, $input, and write the compressed data to a buffer, $buffer.

           use strict ;
           use warnings ;
           use IO::Compress::Zip qw(zip $ZipError) ;
           use IO::File ;

           my $input = IO::File-&gt;new( "&lt;file1.txt" )
               or die "Cannot open 'file1.txt': $!\n" ;
           my $buffer ;
           zip $input =&gt; \$buffer
               or die "zip failed: $ZipError\n";

       <u>Compressing</u> <u>multiple</u> <u>files</u>

       To  create  a  zip file, "output.zip", that contains the compressed contents of the files "alpha.txt" and
       "beta.txt"

           use strict ;
           use warnings ;
           use IO::Compress::Zip qw(zip $ZipError) ;

           zip [ 'alpha.txt', 'beta.txt' ] =&gt; 'output.zip'
               or die "zip failed: $ZipError\n";

       Alternatively, rather than having to explicitly name each of the files that you  want  to  compress,  you
       could use a fileglob to select all the "txt" files in the current directory, as follows

           use strict ;
           use warnings ;
           use IO::Compress::Zip qw(zip $ZipError) ;

           my @files = &lt;*.txt&gt;;
           zip \@files =&gt; 'output.zip'
               or die "zip failed: $ZipError\n";

       or more succinctly

           zip [ &lt;*.txt&gt; ] =&gt; 'output.zip'
               or die "zip failed: $ZipError\n";

</pre><h4><b>OO</b> <b>Interface</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Constructor</b>
       The format of the constructor for "IO::Compress::Zip" is shown below

           my $z = IO::Compress::Zip-&gt;new( $output [,OPTS] )
               or die "IO::Compress::Zip failed: $ZipError\n";

       The constructor takes one mandatory parameter, $output, defined below and zero or more "OPTS", defined in
       "Constructor Options".

       It  returns an "IO::Compress::Zip" object on success and "undef" on failure.  The variable $ZipError will
       contain an error message on failure.

       If you are running Perl 5.005 or better the object, $z,  returned  from  IO::Compress::Zip  can  be  used
       exactly  like  an  IO::File filehandle.  This means that all normal output file operations can be carried
       out with $z.  For example, to write to a compressed file/buffer you can use either of these forms

           $z-&gt;print("hello world\n");
           print $z "hello world\n";

       Below is a simple exaple of using the OO interface to create an output file "myfile.zip" and  write  some
       data to it.

           my $filename = "myfile.zip";
           my $z = IO::Compress::Zip-&gt;new($filename)
               or die "IO::Compress::Zip failed: $ZipError\n";

           $z-&gt;print("abcde");
           $z-&gt;close();

       See the "Examples" for more.

       The mandatory parameter $output is used to control the destination of the compressed data. This parameter
       can take one of these forms.

       A filename
            If  the  $output  parameter  is  a  simple scalar, it is assumed to be a filename. This file will be
            opened for writing and the compressed data will be written to it.

       A filehandle
            If the $output parameter is a filehandle, the compressed data will be written to it.  The string '-'
            can be used as an alias for standard output.

       A scalar reference
            If $output is a scalar reference, the compressed data will be stored in $$output.

       If the $output parameter is any other type, "IO::Compress::Zip"::new will return undef.

   <b>Constructor</b> <b>Options</b>
       "OPTS" is any combination of zero or more the following options:

       "AutoClose =&gt; 0|1"
            This option is only valid when the $output parameter is a filehandle. If specified, and the value is
            true, it will result in the $output being closed once either the "close" method  is  called  or  the
            "IO::Compress::Zip" object is destroyed.

            This parameter defaults to 0.

       "Append =&gt; 0|1"
            Opens $output in append mode.

            The behaviour of this option is dependent on the type of $output.

            •    A Buffer

                 If  $output  is a buffer and "Append" is enabled, all compressed data will be append to the end
                 of $output. Otherwise $output will be cleared before any data is written to it.

            •    A Filename

                 If $output is a filename and "Append" is enabled, the file  will  be  opened  in  append  mode.
                 Otherwise  the  contents  of  the file, if any, will be truncated before any compressed data is
                 written to it.

            •    A Filehandle

                 If $output is a filehandle, the file pointer will be positioned to the end of the  file  via  a
                 call  to  "seek"  before any compressed data is written to it.  Otherwise the file pointer will
                 not be moved.

            This parameter defaults to 0.

       <u>File</u> <u>Naming</u> <u>Options</u>

       A quick bit of zip file terminology -- A zip archive consists of one or more <u>archive</u> <u>members</u>, where  each
       member has an associated filename, known as the <u>archive</u> <u>member</u> <u>name</u>.

       The  options  listed  in this section control how the <u>archive</u> <u>member</u> <u>name</u> (or filename) is stored the zip
       archive.

       "Name =&gt; $string"
            This option is used to explicitly set the <u>archive</u> <u>member</u> <u>name</u> in the zip archive to  $string.   Most
            of the time you don't need to make use of this option.  By default when adding a filename to the zip
            archive, the <u>archive</u> <u>member</u> <u>name</u> will match the filename.

            You should only need to use this option if you want the <u>archive</u> <u>member</u> <u>name</u> to be different from the
            uncompressed filename or when the input is a filehandle or a buffer.

            The  default  behaviour for what <u>archive</u> <u>member</u> <u>name</u> is used when the "Name" option is <u>not</u> specified
            depends on the form of the $input parameter:

            •    If the $input parameter is a filename, the value of $input will be used for the <u>archive</u>  <u>member</u>
                 <u>name</u> .

            •    If the $input parameter is not a filename, the <u>archive</u> <u>member</u> <u>name</u> will be an empty string.

            Note  that  both  the  "CanonicalName"  and  "FilterName"  options can modify the value used for the
            <u>archive</u> <u>member</u> <u>name</u>.

            Also note that you should set the "Efs" option to true if you are working with UTF8 filenames.

       "CanonicalName =&gt; 0|1"
            This option controls whether the <u>archive</u> <u>member</u> <u>name</u> is <u>normalized</u> into  Unix  format  before  being
            written to the zip file.

            It  is  recommended  that you enable this option unless you really need to create a non-standard Zip
            file.

            This is what APPNOTE.TXT has to say on what should be stored in the zip filename header field.

                The name of the file, with optional relative path.
                The path stored should not contain a drive or
                device letter, or a leading slash.  All slashes
                should be forward slashes '/' as opposed to
                backwards slashes '\' for compatibility with Amiga
                and UNIX file systems etc.

            This option defaults to <b>false</b>.

       "FilterName =&gt; sub { ... }"
            This option allow the <u>archive</u> <u>member</u> name to be modified before it is written to the zip file.

            This option takes a parameter that must be a reference to a  sub.   On  entry  to  the  sub  the  $_
            variable  will contain the name to be filtered. If no filename is available $_ will contain an empty
            string.

            The value of $_ when the sub returns will be  used as the <u>archive</u> <u>member</u> <u>name</u>.

            Note that if "CanonicalName" is enabled, a normalized filename will be passed to the sub.

            If you use "FilterName" to modify the filename, it is your responsibility to keep  the  filename  in
            Unix format.

            Although  this  option  can  be  used  with  the  OO  interface, it is of most use with the one-shot
            interface. For example, the code below shows how  "FilterName"  can  be  used  to  remove  the  path
            component from a series of filenames before they are stored in $zipfile.

                sub compressTxtFiles
                {
                    my $zipfile = shift ;
                    my $dir     = shift ;

                    zip [ &lt;$dir/*.txt&gt; ] =&gt; $zipfile,
                        FilterName =&gt; sub { s[^$dir/][] } ;
                }

       "Efs =&gt; 0|1"
            This option controls setting of the "Language Encoding Flag" (EFS) in the zip archive. When set, the
            filename and comment fields for the zip archive MUST be valid UTF-8.

            If  the string used for the filename and/or comment is not valid UTF-8 when this option is true, the
            script will die with a "wide character" error.

            Note that this option only works with Perl 5.8.4 or better.

            This option defaults to <b>false</b>.

       <u>Overall</u> <u>Zip</u> <u>Archive</u> <u>Structure</u>

       "Minimal =&gt; 1|0"
            If specified, this option will disable the creation of all extra fields in the zip local and central
            headers. So the "exTime", "exUnix2", "exUnixN", "ExtraFieldLocal"  and  "ExtraFieldCentral"  options
            will be ignored.

            This parameter defaults to 0.

       "Stream =&gt; 0|1"
            This option controls whether the zip file/buffer output is created in streaming mode.

            Note  that  when  outputting to a file with streaming mode disabled ("Stream" is 0), the output file
            must be seekable.

            The default is 1.

       "Zip64 =&gt; 0|1"
            Create a Zip64 zip file/buffer. This option is used if you want to store files larger than 4 Gig  or
            store more than 64K files in a single zip archive.

            "Zip64"  will be automatically set, as needed, if working with the one-shot interface when the input
            is either a filename or a scalar reference.

            If you intend to manipulate the  Zip64  zip  files  created  with  this  module  using  an  external
            zip/unzip, make sure that it supports Zip64.

            In  particular,  if  you  are  using Info-Zip you need to have zip version 3.x or better to update a
            Zip64 archive and unzip version 6.x to read a zip64 archive.

            The default is 0.

       <u>Deflate</u> <u>Compression</u> <u>Options</u>

       -Level
            Defines the compression level used by zlib. The value should either be a number between 0 and  9  (0
            means no compression and 9 is maximum compression), or one of the symbolic constants defined below.

               Z_NO_COMPRESSION
               Z_BEST_SPEED
               Z_BEST_COMPRESSION
               Z_DEFAULT_COMPRESSION

            The default is Z_DEFAULT_COMPRESSION.

            Note, these constants are not imported by "IO::Compress::Zip" by default.

                use IO::Compress::Zip qw(:strategy);
                use IO::Compress::Zip qw(:constants);
                use IO::Compress::Zip qw(:all);

       -Strategy
            Defines the strategy used to tune the compression. Use one of the symbolic constants defined below.

               Z_FILTERED
               Z_HUFFMAN_ONLY
               Z_RLE
               Z_FIXED
               Z_DEFAULT_STRATEGY

            The default is Z_DEFAULT_STRATEGY.

       <u>Bzip2</u> <u>Compression</u> <u>Options</u>

       "BlockSize100K =&gt; number"
            Specify the number of 100K blocks bzip2 uses during compression.

            Valid values are from 1 to 9, where 9 is best compression.

            This option is only valid if the "Method" is ZIP_CM_BZIP2. It is ignored otherwise.

            The default is 1.

       "WorkFactor =&gt; number"
            Specifies  how  much  effort  bzip2  should  take  before resorting to a slower fallback compression
            algorithm.

            Valid values range from 0 to 250, where 0 means use the default value 30.

            This option is only valid if the "Method" is ZIP_CM_BZIP2. It is ignored otherwise.

            The default is 0.

       <u>Lzma</u> <u>and</u> <u>Xz</u> <u>Compression</u> <u>Options</u>

       "Preset =&gt; number"
            Used to choose the LZMA compression preset.

            Valid values are 0-9 and "LZMA_PRESET_DEFAULT".

            0 is the fastest compression with the lowest memory usage and the lowest compression.

            9 is the slowest compression with the highest memory usage but with the best compression.

            This option is only valid if the "Method" is ZIP_CM_LZMA. It is ignored otherwise.

            Defaults to "LZMA_PRESET_DEFAULT" (6).

       "Extreme =&gt; 0|1"
            Makes LZMA compression a lot slower, but a small compression gain.

            This option is only valid if the "Method" is ZIP_CM_LZMA. It is ignored otherwise.

            Defaults to 0.

       <u>Other</u> <u>Options</u>

       "Time =&gt; $number"
            Sets the last modified time field in the zip header to $number.

            This field defaults to the time the "IO::Compress::Zip" object was created if  this  option  is  not
            specified and the $input parameter is not a filename.

       "ExtAttr =&gt; $attr"
            This  option  controls  the  "external file attributes" field in the central header of the zip file.
            This is a 4 byte field.

            If you are running a Unix derivative this value defaults to

                0100644 &lt;&lt; 16

            This should allow read/write access to any files that are extracted from the zip file/buffer`.

            For all other systems it defaults to 0.

       "exTime =&gt; [$atime, $mtime, $ctime]"
            This option expects an array reference with exactly three  elements:  $atime,  "mtime"  and  $ctime.
            These correspond to the last access time, last modification time and creation time respectively.

            It  uses these values to set the extended timestamp field (ID is "UT") in the local zip header using
            the three values, $atime, $mtime, $ctime. In addition it sets the extended timestamp  field  in  the
            central zip header using $mtime.

            If  any  of  the  three values is "undef" that time value will not be used.  So, for example, to set
            only the $mtime you would use this

                exTime =&gt; [undef, $mtime, undef]

            If the "Minimal" option is set to true, this option will be ignored.

            By default no extended time field is created.

       "exUnix2 =&gt; [$uid, $gid]"
            This option expects an array reference with exactly  two  elements:  $uid  and  $gid.  These  values
            correspond to the numeric User ID (UID) and Group ID (GID) of the owner of the files respectively.

            When  the  "exUnix2"  option  is  present it will trigger the creation of a Unix2 extra field (ID is
            "Ux") in the local zip header. This will be populated with $uid and $gid. An empty Unix2 extra field
            will also be created in the central zip header.

            Note - The UID &amp; GID are stored as 16-bit integers in the "Ux" field. Use "exUnixN" if your  UID  or
            GID are 32-bit.

            If the "Minimal" option is set to true, this option will be ignored.

            By default no Unix2 extra field is created.

       "exUnixN =&gt; [$uid, $gid]"
            This  option  expects  an  array  reference  with  exactly two elements: $uid and $gid. These values
            correspond to the numeric User ID (UID) and Group ID (GID) of the owner of the files respectively.

            When the "exUnixN" option is present it will trigger the creation of a  UnixN  extra  field  (ID  is
            "ux")  in  both  the local and central zip headers.  This will be populated with $uid and $gid.  The
            UID &amp; GID are stored as 32-bit integers.

            If the "Minimal" option is set to true, this option will be ignored.

            By default no UnixN extra field is created.

       "Comment =&gt; $comment"
            Stores the contents of $comment in the Central File Header of the zip file.

            Set the "Efs" option to true if you want to store a UTF8 comment.

            By default, no comment field is written to the zip file.

       "ZipComment =&gt; $comment"
            Stores the contents of $comment in the End of Central Directory record of the zip file.

            By default, no comment field is written to the zip file.

       "Method =&gt; $method"
            Controls which compression method is used. At present the compression methods supported  are:  Store
            (no compression at all), Deflate, Bzip2, Zstd, Xz and Lzma.

            The  symbols  ZIP_CM_STORE, ZIP_CM_DEFLATE, ZIP_CM_BZIP2, ZIP_CM_ZSTD, ZIP_CM_XZ and ZIP_CM_LZMA are
            used to select the compression method.

            These constants are not imported by "IO::Compress::Zip" by default.

                use IO::Compress::Zip qw(:zip_method);
                use IO::Compress::Zip qw(:constants);
                use IO::Compress::Zip qw(:all);

            Note that to create Bzip2 content, the module "IO::Compress::Bzip2" must be installed. A fatal error
            will be thrown if you attempt to create Bzip2 content when "IO::Compress::Bzip2" is not available.

            Note that to create Lzma content, the module "IO::Compress::Lzma" must be installed. A  fatal  error
            will be thrown if you attempt to create Lzma content when "IO::Compress::Lzma" is not available.

            Note  that to create Xz content, the module "IO::Compress::Xz" must be installed. A fatal error will
            be thrown if you attempt to create Xz content when "IO::Compress::Xz" is not available.

            Note that to create Zstd content, the module "IO::Compress::Zstd" must be installed. A  fatal  error
            will be thrown if you attempt to create Zstd content when "IO::Compress::Zstd" is not available.

            The default method is ZIP_CM_DEFLATE.

       "TextFlag =&gt; 0|1"
            This  parameter  controls  the setting of a bit in the zip central header. It is used to signal that
            the data stored in the zip file/buffer is probably text.

            In one-shot mode this flag will be set to true if the Perl "-T" operator thinks  the  file  contains
            text.

            The default is 0.

       "ExtraFieldLocal =&gt; $data"
       "ExtraFieldCentral =&gt; $data"
            The  "ExtraFieldLocal"  option  is used to store additional metadata in the local header for the zip
            file/buffer. The "ExtraFieldCentral" does the same for the matching central header.

            An extra field consists of zero or more subfields. Each subfield  consists  of  a  two  byte  header
            followed by the subfield data.

            The list of subfields can be supplied in any of the following formats

                ExtraFieldLocal =&gt; [$id1, $data1,
                                    $id2, $data2,
                                     ...
                                   ]

                ExtraFieldLocal =&gt; [ [$id1 =&gt; $data1],
                                     [$id2 =&gt; $data2],
                                     ...
                                   ]

                ExtraFieldLocal =&gt; { $id1 =&gt; $data1,
                                     $id2 =&gt; $data2,
                                     ...
                                   }

            Where $id1, $id2 are two byte subfield ID's.

            If  you  use  the  hash  syntax,  you have no control over the order in which the ExtraSubFields are
            stored, plus you cannot have SubFields with duplicate ID.

            Alternatively the list of subfields can by supplied as a scalar, thus

                ExtraField =&gt; $rawdata

            In this case "IO::Compress::Zip" will check that $rawdata consists of zero or more  conformant  sub-
            fields.

            The  Extended  Time  field  (ID  "UT"), set using the "exTime" option, and the Unix2 extra field (ID
            "Ux), set using the "exUnix2" option, are examples of extra fields.

            If the "Minimal" option is set to true, this option will be ignored.

            The maximum size of an extra field 65535 bytes.

       "Strict =&gt; 0|1"
            This is a placeholder option.

   <b>Examples</b>
       <u>Streaming</u>

       This very simple command line example demonstrates the streaming capabilities of  the  module.  The  code
       reads data from STDIN or all the files given on the commandline, compresses it, and writes the compressed
       data to STDOUT.

           use strict ;
           use warnings ;
           use IO::Compress::Zip qw(zip $ZipError) ;

           my $z = IO::Compress::Zip-&gt;new("-", Stream =&gt; 1)
               or die "IO::Compress::Zip failed: $ZipError\n";

           while (&lt;&gt;) {
               $z-&gt;print("abcde");
           }
           $z-&gt;close();

       Note the use of "-" to means "STDOUT". Alternatively you can use "\*STDOUT".

       One  problem  with  creating  a  zip  archive  directly  from STDIN can be demonstrated by looking at the
       contents of the zip file, output.zip, that we have just created (assumg you have redirected it to a  file
       called "output.zip").

           $ unzip -l output.zip
           Archive:  output.zip
           Length      Date    Time    Name
           ---------  ---------- -----   ----
               12  2019-08-16 22:21
           ---------                     -------
               12                     1 file

       The archive member (filename) used is the empty string.

       If  that  doesn't  suit  your  needs,  you  can  explicitly  set  the filename used in the zip archive by
       specifying the Name option, like so

           my $z = IO::Compress::Zip-&gt;new("-", Name =&gt; "hello.txt", Stream =&gt; 1)

       Now the contents of the zip file looks like this

           $ unzip -l output.zip
           Archive:  output.zip
           Length      Date    Time    Name
           ---------  ---------- -----   ----
               12  2019-08-16 22:22   hello.txt
           ---------                     -------
               12                     1 file

       <u>Compressing</u> <u>a</u> <u>file</u> <u>from</u> <u>the</u> <u>filesystem</u>

       To read the contents of the file "file1.txt" and write the compressed data to  the  file  "file1.txt.zip"
       there are a few options

       Start by creating the compression object and opening the input file

           use strict ;
           use warnings ;
           use IO::Compress::Zip qw(zip $ZipError) ;

           my $input = "file1.txt";
           my $z = IO::Compress::Zip-&gt;new("file1.txt.zip")
               or die "IO::Compress::Zip failed: $ZipError\n";

           # open the input file
           open my $fh, "&lt;", "file1.txt"
               or die "Cannot open file1.txt: $!\n";

           # loop through the input file &amp; write to the compressed file
           while (&lt;$fh&gt;) {
               $z-&gt;print($_);
           }

           # not forgetting to close the compressed file
           $z-&gt;close();

       <u>Compressing</u> <u>multiple</u> <u>files</u>

       To  create  a  zip file, "output.zip", that contains the compressed contents of the files "alpha.txt" and
       "beta.txt"

           use strict ;
           use warnings ;
           use IO::Compress::Zip qw(zip $ZipError) ;

           my $z = IO::Compress::Zip-&gt;new("output.zip", Name =&gt; "alpha.txt")
               or die "IO::Compress::Zip failed: $ZipError\n";

           # open the input file
           open my $fh, "&lt;", "file1.txt"
               or die "Cannot open file1.txt: $!\n";

           # loop through the input file &amp; write to the compressed file
           while (&lt;$fh&gt;) {
               $z-&gt;print($_);
           }

           # move to next file
           $z-&gt;newStream(Name =&gt; "beta.txt")

           while (&lt;$fh&gt;) {
               $z-&gt;print($_);
           }

           $z-&gt;close();

</pre><h4><b>Methods</b></h4><pre>

       built-in.

       Returns true if successful.

   <b>printf</b>
       Usage is

           $z-&gt;printf($format, $data)

       Compresses and outputs the contents of the $data parameter.

       Returns the number of uncompressed bytes written, or "undef" if unsuccessful.

   <b>flush</b>
       Usage is

           $z-&gt;flush;
           $z-&gt;flush($flush_type);

       Flushes any pending compressed data to the output file/buffer.

       This method takes an optional parameter, $flush_type, that controls how the flushing will be carried out.
       By  default  the  $flush_type  used  is  "Z_FINISH". Other valid values for $flush_type are "Z_NO_FLUSH",
       "Z_SYNC_FLUSH", "Z_FULL_FLUSH"  and  "Z_BLOCK".  It  is  strongly  recommended  that  you  only  set  the
       "flush_type"  parameter if you fully understand the implications of what it does - overuse of "flush" can
       seriously degrade the level of compression achieved. See the "zlib" documentation for details.

       Returns true on success.

   <b>tell</b>
       Usage is

           $z-&gt;tell()
           tell $z

       Returns the uncompressed file offset.

   <b>eof</b>
       Usage is

           $z-&gt;eof();
           eof($z);

       Returns true if the "close" method has been called.

   <b>seek</b>
           $z-&gt;seek($position, $whence);
           seek($z, $position, $whence);

       Provides a sub-set of the "seek" functionality, with the restriction  that  it  is  only  legal  to  seek
       forward in the output file/buffer.  It is a fatal error to attempt to seek backward.

       Empty parts of the file/buffer will have NULL (0x00) bytes written to them.

       The $whence parameter takes one the usual values, namely SEEK_SET, SEEK_CUR or SEEK_END.

       Returns 1 on success, 0 on failure.

   <b>binmode</b>
       Usage is

           $z-&gt;binmode
           binmode $z ;

       This is a noop provided for completeness.

   <b>opened</b>
           $z-&gt;opened()

       Returns true if the object currently refers to a opened file/buffer.

   <b>autoflush</b>
           my $prev = $z-&gt;autoflush()
           my $prev = $z-&gt;autoflush(EXPR)

       If  the  $z  object  is associated with a file or a filehandle, this method returns the current autoflush
       setting for the underlying filehandle. If "EXPR" is present, and is non-zero,  it  will  enable  flushing
       after every write/print operation.

       If $z is associated with a buffer, this method has no effect and always returns "undef".

       <b>Note</b> that the special variable $| <b>cannot</b> be used to set or retrieve the autoflush setting.

   <b>input_line_number</b>
           $z-&gt;input_line_number()
           $z-&gt;input_line_number(EXPR)

       This method always returns "undef" when compressing.

   <b>fileno</b>
           $z-&gt;fileno()
           fileno($z)

       If  the  $z  object  is  associated with a file or a filehandle, "fileno" will return the underlying file
       descriptor. Once the "close" method is called "fileno" will return "undef".

       If the $z object is associated with a buffer, this method will return "undef".

   <b>close</b>
           $z-&gt;close() ;
           close $z ;

       Flushes any pending compressed data and then closes the output file/buffer.

       For most versions of Perl this method will be automatically invoked if the  IO::Compress::Zip  object  is
       destroyed (either explicitly or by the variable with the reference to the object going out of scope). The
       exceptions  are Perl versions 5.005 through 5.00504 and 5.8.0. In these cases, the "close" method will be
       called automatically, but not  until  global  destruction  of  all  live  objects  when  the  program  is
       terminating.

       Therefore,  if  you  want your scripts to be able to run on all versions of Perl, you should call "close"
       explicitly and not rely on automatic closing.

       Returns true on success, otherwise 0.

       If the "AutoClose" option has been enabled when the IO::Compress::Zip object was created, and the  object
       is associated with a file, the underlying file will also be closed.

   <b>newStream([OPTS])</b>
       Usage is

           $z-&gt;newStream( [OPTS] )

       Closes the current compressed data stream and starts a new one.

       OPTS consists of any of the options that are available when creating the $z object.

       See the "Constructor Options" section for more details.

   <b>deflateParams</b>
       Usage is

           $z-&gt;deflateParams
