</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Class::ISA - report the search path for a class's ISA tree

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         # Suppose you go: use Food::Fishstick, and that uses and
         # inherits from other things, which in turn use and inherit
         # from other things.  And suppose, for sake of brevity of
         # example, that their ISA tree is the same as:

         @Food::Fishstick::ISA = qw(Food::Fish  Life::Fungus  Chemicals);
         @Food::Fish::ISA = qw(Food);
         @Food::ISA = qw(Matter);
         @Life::Fungus::ISA = qw(Life);
         @Chemicals::ISA = qw(Matter);
         @Life::ISA = qw(Matter);
         @Matter::ISA = qw();

         use Class::ISA;
         print "Food::Fishstick path is:\n ",
               join(", ", Class::ISA::super_path('Food::Fishstick')),
               "\n";

       That prints:

         Food::Fishstick path is:
          Food::Fish, Food, Matter, Life::Fungus, Life, Chemicals

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Suppose you have a class (like Food::Fish::Fishstick) that is derived, via its @ISA, from one or more
       superclasses (as Food::Fish::Fishstick is from Food::Fish, Life::Fungus, and Chemicals), and some of
       those superclasses may themselves each be derived, via its @ISA, from one or more superclasses (as
       above).

       When, then, you call a method in that class ($fishstick-&gt;calories), Perl first searches there for that
       method, but if it's not there, it goes searching in its superclasses, and so on, in a depth-first (or
       maybe "height-first" is the word) search.  In the above example, it'd first look in Food::Fish, then
       Food, then Matter, then Life::Fungus, then Life, then Chemicals.

       This library, Class::ISA, provides functions that return that list -- the list (in order) of names of
       classes Perl would search to find a method, with no duplicates.

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       the function Class::ISA::super_path($CLASS)
           This  returns  the  ordered  list  of names of classes that Perl would search thru in order to find a
           method, with no duplicates in the list.  $CLASS is not  included  in  the  list.   UNIVERSAL  is  not
           included -- if you need to consider it, add it to the end.

       the function Class::ISA::self_and_super_path($CLASS)
           Just like "super_path", except that $CLASS is included as the first element.

       the function Class::ISA::self_and_super_versions($CLASS)
           This  returns  a  hash  whose  keys are $CLASS and its (super-)superclasses, and whose values are the
           contents of each class's $VERSION (or undef, for classes with no $VERSION).

           The code for self_and_super_versions is meant to serve as an example for precisely the kind of  tasks
           I  anticipate  that self_and_super_path and super_path will be used for.  You are strongly advised to
           read the source for self_and_super_versions, and the comments there.

</pre><h4><b>CAUTIONARY</b> <b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       * Class::ISA doesn't export anything.  You have to address the functions with  a  "Class::ISA::"  on  the
       front.

       * Contrary to its name, Class::ISA isn't a class; it's just a package.  Strange, isn't it?

       * Say you have a loop in the ISA tree of the class you're calling one of the Class::ISA functions on: say
       that  Food  inherits  from  Matter, but Matter inherits from Food (for sake of argument).  If Perl, while
       searching for a method, actually discovers this cyclicity, it will throw a fatal error.  The functions in
       Class::ISA effectively ignore this cyclicity; the Class::ISA algorithm is "never go down  the  same  path
       twice", and cyclicities are just a special case of that.

       *  The  Class::ISA  functions  just  look at @ISAs.  But theoretically, I suppose, AUTOLOADs could bypass
       Perl's ISA-based search mechanism and do whatever they please.  That would be bad behavior,  tho;  and  I
       try not to think about that.

       *  If  Perl  can't  find a method anywhere in the ISA tree, it then looks in the magical class UNIVERSAL.
       This is rarely relevant to the tasks that I expect Class::ISA functions to be put to, but if  it  matters
       to you, then instead of this:

         @supers = Class::Tree::super_path($class);

       do this:

         @supers = (Class::Tree::super_path($class), 'UNIVERSAL');

       And don't say no-one ever told ya!

       *  When  you  call them, the Class::ISA functions look at @ISAs anew -- that is, there is no memoization,
       and so if ISAs change during runtime, you get  the  current  ISA  tree's  path,  not  anything  memoized.
       However, changing ISAs at runtime is probably a sign that you're out of your mind!
