</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Locale::Po4a::TeX - convert TeX documents and derivatives from/to PO files

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The po4a (PO for anything) project goal is to ease translations (and more interestingly, the maintenance
       of translations) using gettext tools on areas where they were not expected like documentation.

       Locale::Po4a::TeX is a module to help the translation of TeX documents into other [human] languages. It
       can also be used as a base to build modules for TeX-based documents.

       Users should probably use the LaTeX module, which inherits from the TeX module and contains the
       definitions of common LaTeX commands.

</pre><h4><b>TRANSLATING</b> <b>WITH</b> <b>PO4A::TEX</b></h4><pre>
       This module can be used directly to handle generic TeX documents.  This will split your document in
       smaller blocks (paragraphs, verbatim blocks, or even smaller like titles or indexes).

       There are some options (described in the next section) that can customize this behavior.  If this doesn't
       fit to your document format you're encouraged to write your own derivative module from this, to describe
       your format's details.  See the section <b>WRITING</b> <b>DERIVATIVE</b> <b>MODULES</b> below, for the process description.

       This module can also be customized by lines starting with "% po4a:" in the TeX file. This process is
       described in the <b>INLINE</b> <b>CUSTOMIZATION</b> section.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b> <b>ACCEPTED</b> <b>BY</b> <b>THIS</b> <b>MODULE</b></h4><pre>
       These are this module's particular options:

       <b>debug</b>
           Activate  debugging  for  some internal mechanisms of this module.  Use the source to see which parts
           can be debugged.

       <b>no_wrap</b>
           Comma-separated list of environments which should not be re-wrapped.

           Note that there is a difference between verbatim and no_wrap environments.  There is no  command  and
           comments analysis in verbatim blocks.

           If  this  environment  was  not already registered, po4a will consider that this environment does not
           take any parameters.

       <b>exclude_include</b>
           Colon-separated list of files that should not be included by \input and \include.

       <b>definitions</b>
           The name of a file containing definitions for po4a, as defined in the <b>INLINE</b>  <b>CUSTOMIZATION</b>  section.
           You  can  use  this  option  if  it  is  not  possible  to  put the definitions in the document being
           translated.

       <b>verbatim</b>
           Comma-separated list of environments which should be taken as verbatim.

           If this environment was not already registered, po4a will consider that  this  environment  does  not
           take any parameters.

       Use these options to override the default behavior of the defined commands.

</pre><h4><b>INLINE</b> <b>CUSTOMIZATION</b></h4><pre>
       The TeX module can be customized with lines starting by <b>%</b> <b>po4a:</b>.  These lines are interpreted as commands
       to the parser.  The following commands are recognized:

       <b>%</b> <b>po4a:</b> <b>command</b> <u>command1</u> <b>alias</b> <u>command2</u>
           Indicates  that  the  arguments  of  the  <u>command1</u>  command should be treated as the arguments of the
           <u>command2</u> command.

       <b>%</b> <b>po4a:</b> <b>command</b> <u>command1</u> <u>parameters</u>
           This describes in detail the parameters of the <u>command1</u> command.  This information will  be  used  to
           check the number of arguments and their types.

           You can precede the <u>command1</u> command by

           an asterisk (<b>*</b>)
               po4a will extract this command from paragraphs (if it is located at the beginning or the end of a
               paragraph).   The  translators  will  then  have  to  translate the parameters that are marked as
               translatable.

           a plus (<b>+</b>)
               As for an asterisk, the command will be extracted if it appear at an extremity of  a  block,  but
               the parameters won't be translated separately.  The translator will have to translate the command
               concatenated  to  all  its  parameters.  This keeps more context, and is useful for commands with
               small words in parameter, which can have multiple meanings (and translations).

               Note: In this case you don't have to specify which parameters are  translatable,  but  po4a  must
               know the type and number of parameters.

           a minus (<b>-</b>)
               In this case, the command won't be extracted from any block.  But if it appears alone on a block,
               then  only  the  parameters  marked as translatable will be presented to the translator.  This is
               useful for font commands.  These commands should generally not be separated from their  paragraph
               (to keep the context), but there is no reason to annoy the translator with them if a whole string
               is enclosed in such a command.

           The  <u>parameters</u>  argument  is  a  set  of  [] (to indicate an optional argument) or {} (to indicate a
           mandatory argument).  You can place an underscore (_) between these brackets  to  indicate  that  the
           parameter must be translated. For example:
            % po4a: command *chapter [_]{_}

           This indicates that the chapter command has two parameters: an optional (short title) and a mandatory
           one,  which  must both be translated.  If you want to specify that the href command has two mandatory
           parameters, that you don't want to translate the URL (first parameter), and that you don't want  this
           command  to  be  separated  from  its  paragraph  (which allow the translator to move the link in the
           sentence), you can use:
            % po4a: command -href {}{_}

           In this case, the information indicating which arguments  must  be  translated  is  only  used  if  a
           paragraph is only composed of this href command.

       <b>%</b> <b>po4a:</b> <b>environment</b> <u>env</u> <u>parameters</u>
           This  defines the parameters accepted by the <u>env</u> environment and specifies the ones to be translated.
           This information is later used to check the number of arguments of the \begin command.  The syntax of
           the <u>parameters</u> argument is the same as described for the others commands.  The first parameter of the
           \begin command is the name of the environment.  This parameter must not be specified in the  list  of
           parameters. Here are some examples:
            % po4a: environment multicols {}
            % po4a: environment equation

           As  for  the  commands, <u>env</u> can be preceded by a plus (+) to indicate that the \begin command must be
           translated with all its arguments.

       <b>%</b> <b>po4a:</b> <b>separator</b> <u>env</u> <b>"</b><u>regex</u><b>"</b>
           Indicates that an environment should be split according to the given regular expression.

           The regular expression is delimited by quotes.  It should not create any back-reference.  You  should
           use (?:) if you need a group.  It may also need some escapes.

           For  example,  the LaTeX module uses the "(?:&amp;|\\\\)" regular expression to translate separately each
           cell of a table (lines are separated by '\\' and cells by '&amp;').

           The notion of environment is expanded to the type displayed in the PO file.   This  can  be  used  to
           split  on "\\\\" in the first mandatory argument of the title command.  In this case, the environment
           is title{#1}.

       <b>%</b> <b>po4a:</b> <b>verbatim</b> <b>environment</b> <u>env</u>
           Indicate that <u>env</u> is a  verbatim  environment.   Comments  and  commands  will  be  ignored  in  this
           environment.

           If  this  environment  was  not already registered, po4a will consider that this environment does not
           take any parameters.

</pre><h4><b>WRITING</b> <b>DERIVATE</b> <b>MODULES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pre_trans</b>
       <b>post_trans</b>
       <b>add_comment</b>
           Add a string as a comment to be added around the next translated element.  This is mostly  useful  to
           the texinfo module, as comments are automatically handled in TeX.

       <b>translate</b>
           Wrapper around Transtractor's translate, with pre- and post-processing filters.

           Comments  of  a  paragraph  are  inserted  as  a  PO  comment for the first translated string of this
           paragraph.

       <b>get_leading_command</b>($buffer)
           This function returns:

           A command name
               If no command is found at the beginning of the given buffer, this string  will  be  empty.   Only
               commands  that can be separated are considered.  The %separated_command hash contains the list of
               these commands.

           A variant
               This indicates if a variant is used.  For example, an asterisk (*) can be added  at  the  end  of
               sections  command  to  specify  that  they should not be numbered.  In this case, this field will
               contain "*".  If there is no variant, the field is an empty string.

           An array of tuples (type of argument, argument)
               The type of argument can be either '{' (for mandatory arguments) or '[' (for optional arguments).

           The remaining buffer
               The rest of the buffer after the removal of this  leading  command  and  its  arguments.   If  no
               command is found, the original buffer is not touched and returned in this field.

       <b>get_trailing_command</b>($buffer)
           The same as <b>get_leading_command</b>, but for commands at the end of a buffer.

       <b>translate_buffer</b>
           Recursively  translate  a  buffer  by separating leading and trailing commands (those which should be
           translated separately) from the buffer.

           If a function is defined in %translate_buffer_env for the current environment, this function will  be
           used to translate the buffer instead of <b>translate_buffer()</b>.

       <b>read</b>
           Overloads Transtractor's <b>read()</b>.

       <b>read_file</b>
           Recursively read a file, appending included files which are not listed in the @exclude_include array.
           Included files are searched using the <b>kpsewhich</b> command from the Kpathsea library.

           Except from the file inclusion part, it is a cut and paste from Transtractor's read.

       <b>parse_definition_file</b>
           Subroutine for parsing a file with po4a directives (definitions for new commands).

       <b>parse_definition_line</b>
           Parse a definition line of the form "% po4a: ".

           See the <b>INLINE</b> <b>CUSTOMIZATION</b> section for more details.

</pre><h4><b>INTERNAL</b> <b>FUNCTIONS</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>derivative</b> <b>parsers</b></h4><pre>
       Command and environment functions take the following arguments (in addition to the $self object):

       A command name
       A variant
       An array of (type, argument) tuples
       The current environment

       The first 3 arguments are extracted by get_leading_command or get_trailing_command.

       Command  and  environment  functions  return  the translation of the command with its arguments and a new
       environment.

       Environment functions are called when a \begin command is found. They are called with the \begin  command
       and its arguments.

       The  TeX  module  only  proposes  one  command function and one environment function: generic_command and
       generic_environment.

       generic_command uses the information specified by register_generic_command or by adding definition to the
       TeX file:
        % po4a: command <u>command1</u> <u>parameters</u>

       generic_environment  uses  the  information  specified  by  register_generic_environment  or  by   adding
       definition to the TeX file:
        % po4a: environment <u>env</u> <u>parameters</u>

       Both  functions  will  only  translate  the  parameters that were specified as translatable (with a '_').
       generic_environment will append the name of the environment to the environment stack and  generic_command
       will append the name of the command followed by an identifier of the parameter (like {#7} or [#2]).

</pre><h4><b>STATUS</b> <b>OF</b> <b>THIS</b> <b>MODULE</b></h4><pre>
       This module needs more tests.

       It was tested on a book and with the Python documentation.

</pre><h4><b>TODO</b> <b>LIST</b></h4><pre>
       Automatic detection of new commands
           The  TeX  module could parse the newcommand arguments and try to guess the number of arguments, their
           type and whether or not they should be translated.

       Translation of the environment separator
           When \item is used as an environment separator, the  item  argument  is  attached  to  the  following
           string.

       Some commands should be added to the environment stack
           These  commands  should  be  specified by couples.  This can be used to specify commands beginning or
           ending a verbatim environment.

       Others
           Various other points are tagged TODO in the source.
