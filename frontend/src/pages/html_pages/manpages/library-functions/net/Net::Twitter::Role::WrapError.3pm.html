</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Net::Twitter::Role::WrapError - Wraps Net::Twitter exceptions

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 4.01043

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Net::Twitter;

           my $nt = Net::Twitter-&gt;new(username =&gt; $username, password =&gt; $password);

           my $followers = $nt-&gt;followers;
           if ( !followers ) {
               warn $nt-&gt;http_message;
           }

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module provides an alternate error handling strategy for "Net::Twitter".  Rather than throwing
       exceptions, API methods return "undef" and error information is available through method calls on the
       "Net::Twitter" object.

       This is the error handling strategy used when "trait" "Legacy" is used.  It was the error handling
       strategy employed by "Net::Twitter" prior to version 3.00.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       new This method takes the same parameters as "new" in Net::Twitter.

       get_error
           Returns  undef  if  there  was  no  error  or  a  HASH  ref  containing  the  Twitter error response.
           Occasionally, a Twitter API call results in an error with no error  content  returned  from  Twitter.
           When that occurs, get_error returns a simulated error HASH ref.

           NOTE:  Versions of "Net::Twitter" prior to 3.0 sometimes returned a string rather than a HASH ref, on
           error.  This was a bug.  Always expect undef on success and a HASH ref on error.

       http_code
           Returns the HTTP response code the most recent API method call if it ended in error.

       http_message
           Returns the HTTP message for the most recent API method call if it ended in error.
