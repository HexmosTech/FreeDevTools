</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Net::SSH2 - Support for the SSH 2 protocol via libssh2.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Net::SSH2;

         my $ssh2 = Net::SSH2-&gt;new();

         $ssh2-&gt;connect('example.com')
           or $ssh2-&gt;die_with_error;

         $ssh2-&gt;check_hostkey('ask')
           or $ssh2-&gt;die_with_error;

         $ssh2-&gt;auth_publickey($ENV{USER}, "$ENV{HOME}/.ssh/id_rsa.pub", "$ENV{HOME}/.ssh/id_rsa")
           or $ssh2-&gt;die_with_error;

         my $chan = $ssh2-&gt;channel()
           or $ssh2-&gt;die_with_error;

         $chan-&gt;exec('ls')
           or $ssh2-&gt;die_with_error;

         print while &lt;$chan&gt;;

         print "EXIT CODE: ", $chan-&gt;exit_status, "\n";

         $chan-&gt;close;

         my $sftp = $ssh2-&gt;sftp()
           or $ssh2-&gt;die_with_error;;

         my $fh = $sftp-&gt;open('<a href="file:/etc/passwd">/etc/passwd</a>')
           or $sftp-&gt;die_with_error;

         print while &lt;$fh&gt;;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Net::SSH2 is a Perl interface to the libssh2 (&lt;<a href="http://www.libssh2.org">http://www.libssh2.org</a>&gt;) library.  It supports the SSH2
       protocol (there is no support for SSH1) with all of the key exchanges, ciphers, and compression of
       libssh2.

       Even if the module can be compiled and linked against very old versions of the library, nothing below
       1.5.0 should really be used (older versions were quite buggy and unreliable) and version 1.7.0 or later
       is recommended.

   <b>Error</b> <b>handling</b>
       Unless otherwise indicated, methods return a true value on success and "undef" on failure; use the
       "error" method to get extended error information.

       <b>Important</b>: methods in Net::SSH2 not backed by libssh2 functions (i.e. "check_hostkey" or SCP related
       methods) require libssh2 1.7.0 or later in order to set the error state. That means that after any of
       those methods fails, "error" would not return the real code but just some bogus result when an older
       version of the library is used.

   <b>Typical</b> <b>usage</b>
       The typical usage order is as follows:

       1.  Create the SSH2 object calling "new".

       2.  Configure  the  session  if  required.  For  instance,  enabling compression or picking some specific
           encryption methods.

       3.  Establish the SSH connection calling the method "connect".

       4.  Check the remote host public key calling "check_hostkey".

       5.  Authenticate calling the required authentication methods.

       6.  Call "channel" and related methods to create new bidirectional communication channels  over  the  SSH
           connection.

       7.  Close the connection letting the Net::SSH2 object go out of scope or calling "disconnect" explicitly.

</pre><h4><b>CONSTANTS</b></h4><pre>
       All the constants defined in libssh2 can be imported from Net::SSH2.

       For instance:

          use Net::SSH2 qw(LIBSSH2_CHANNEL_EXTENDED_DATA_MERGE
                           LIBSSH2_CHANNEL_FLUSH_ALL
                           LIBSSH2_HOSTKEY_POLICY_ASK);

       Though note that most methods accept the uncommon part of the constant name as a string. For instance the
       following two method calls are equivalent:

           $channel-&gt;ext_data(LIBSSH2_CHANNEL_EXTENDED_DATA_MERGE);
           $channel-&gt;ext_data('merge');

       Tags can be used to import the following constant subsets:

         callback channel error socket trace hash method
         disconnect policy fx fxf sftp

       The tag "all" can also be used to import all of them.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>new</b> <b>(</b> <b>%options</b> <b>)</b>
       Create new Net::SSH2 object representing a SSH session.

       The accepted options are as follows:

       timeout
           Sets the default timeout in milliseconds. See "timeout".

       trace
           Sets tracing. See "trace".

           Example:

               my $ssh2 = Net::SSH2-&gt;new(trace =&gt; -1);

           Note that tracing requires a version of libssh2 compiled with debugging support.

       debug
           Enable debugging. See "debug".

       compress
           Sets flag "LIBSSH2_FLAG_COMPRESS". See "flag".

       sigpipe
           Sets flag "LIBSSH2_FLAG_SIGPIPE". See "flag".

   <b>banner</b> <b>(</b> <b>text</b> <b>)</b>
       Set the SSH2 banner text sent to the remote host (prepends required "SSH-2.0-").

   <b>version</b>
       In  scalar  context,  returns  libssh2  version/patch  e.g.  0.18 or "0.18.0-20071110".  In list context,
       returns that version plus the numeric version (major, minor, and patch, each  encoded  as  8  bits,  e.g.
       0x001200 for version 0.18) and the default banner text (e.g. "SSH-2.0-libssh2_0.18.0-20071110").

   <b>error</b>
       Returns the last error code. In list context, returns (code, error name, error string).

       Note  that  the  returned  error  value  is only meaningful after some other method indicates an error by
       returning false.

   <b>die_with_error</b> <b>(</b> <b>[message]</b> <b>)</b>
       Calls "die" with the given message and the error information from the object appended.

       For instance:

         $ssh2-&gt;connect("ajhkfhdklfjhklsjhd", 22)
             or $ssh2-&gt;die_with_error;
         # dies as:
         #    Unable to connect to remote host: Invalid argument (-1 LIBSSH2_ERROR_SOCKET_NONE)

   <b>sock</b>
       Returns a reference to the underlying IO::Socket object (usually a derived  class  as  IO::Socket::IP  or
       IO::Socket::INET), or "undef" if not yet connected.

   <b>trace</b>
       Calls "libssh2_trace" with supplied bitmask. In order to enable all tracing pass -1 as follows:

           $ssh2-&gt;trace(-1);

       A version of libssh2 compiled with tracing support is required.

   <b>timeout</b> <b>(</b> <b>timeout_ms</b> <b>)</b>
       Enables  a  global  timeout  (in  milliseconds) which will affect every action (requires libssh2 1.2.9 or
       later).

       By default, or if you set the timeout to zero, Net::SSH2 has no timeout.

       Note that timeout errors may leave the SSH connection in an inconsistent state and further operations may
       fail or behave incorrectly. Actually, some methods are able to recover after a timeout error  and  others
       are not.

       <u>Don't</u>  <u>hesitate</u>  <u>to</u>  <u>report</u>  <u>any</u> <u>issue</u> <u>you</u> <u>encounter</u> <u>related</u> <u>to</u> <u>this</u> <u>so</u> <u>that</u> <u>it</u> <u>can</u> <u>be</u> <u>fixed</u> <u>or</u> <u>at</u> <u>least,</u>
       <u>documented!</u>

   <b>method</b> <b>(</b> <b>type</b> <b>[,</b> <b>values...</b> <b>]</b> <b>)</b>
       Sets or gets a method preference. For get, pass in the type only; to set, pass in either a list of values
       or a comma-separated string. Values can only be queried after the session is connected.

       The following methods can be set or queried:

   <b>connect</b> <b>(</b> <b>handle</b> <b>|</b> <b>host</b> <b>[,</b> <b>port])</b>
       The argument combinations accepted are as follows:

       a glob or "IO::*" object reference
           Note that tied file handles are not acceptable. The underlying libssh2 requires real file handles.

       host [, port]
           In order to handle IPv6 addresses the optional module IO::Socket::IP is required.

           The port number defaults to 22.

       This method used to accept a "Timeout" argument. That  feature  has  been  replaced  by  the  constructor
       "timeout" option but note that it takes milliseconds instead of seconds!

   <b>disconnect</b> <b>(</b> <b>[description</b> <b>[,</b> <b>reason</b> <b>[,</b> <b>language]]]</b> <b>)</b>
       Sends  a  clean disconnect message to the remote server. Default values are empty strings for description
       and language, and "SSH_DISCONNECT_BY_APPLICATION" for the reason.

   <b>hostname</b>
       The name of the remote host given at connect time or retrieved from the TCP layer.

   <b>port</b>
       The port number of the remote SSH server.

   <b>hostkey_hash</b> <b>(</b> <b>hash</b> <b>type</b> <b>)</b>
       Returns a hash of the host key; note that  the  key  is  raw  data  and  may  contain  nulls  or  control
       characters.

       The type may be as follows:

       LIBSSH2_HOSTKEY_HASH_MD5
           MD5 hash, 16 bytes long (requires libssh2 compiled with MD5 support).

       LIBSSH2_HOSTKEY_HASH_SHA1
           SHA1 hash, 20 bytes long.

       Note: in previous versions of the module this method was called "hostkey".

   <b>remote_hostkey</b>
       Returns  the  public  key  from  the remote host and its type which is one of "LIBSSH2_HOSTKEY_TYPE_RSA",
       "LIBSSH2_HOSTKEY_TYPE_DSS", or "LIBSSH2_HOSTKEY_TYPE_UNKNOWN".

   <b>check_hostkey(</b> <b>[policy,</b> <b>[known_hosts_path</b> <b>[,</b> <b>comment]</b> <b>]</b> <b>]</b> <b>)</b>
       Looks for the remote host key inside the given known host file (defaults to "<a href="file:~/.ssh/known_hosts">~/.ssh/known_hosts</a>").

       On   success,   this   method   returns   the   result   of   the   call   done   under   the   hood   to
       "Net::SSH2::KnownHost::check"  (i.e.  "LIBSSH2_KNOWNHOST_CHECK_MATCH", "LIBSSH2_KNOWNHOST_CHECK_FAILURE",
       "LIBSSH2_KNOWNHOST_CHECK_NOTFOUND" or "LIBSSH2_KNOWNHOST_CHECK_MISMATCH").

       On failure it returns "undef".

       The accepted policies are as follows:

       LIBSSH2_HOSTKEY_POLICY_STRICT
           Only host keys already present in the known hosts file are accepted.

           This is the default policy.

       LIBSSH2_HOSTKEY_POLICY_ASK
           If the host key is not present in the known hosts file, the user is asked if it should be accepted or
           not.

           If accepted, the key is added to the known host file with the given comment.

       LIBSSH2_HOSTKEY_POLICY_TOFU
           Trust On First Use: if the host key is not present in the known hosts file, it  is  added  there  and
           accepted.

       LIBSSH2_HOSTKEY_POLICY_ADVISORY
           The key is always accepted, but it is never saved into the known host file.

       callback
           If  a reference to a subroutine is given, it is called when the key is not present in the known hosts
           file or a different key is found. The arguments passed to the callback are the  session  object,  the
           matching     error    ("LIBSSH2_KNOWNHOST_CHECK_FAILURE",    "LIBSSH2_KNOWNHOST_CHECK_NOTFOUND"    or
           "LIBSSH2_KNOWNHOST_CHECK_MISMATCH") and the comment.

   <b>auth_list</b> <b>(</b> <b>[username]</b> <b>)</b>
       Returns the authentication methods accepted by the server. In scalar context the methods are returned  as
       a comma separated string.

       When  the  server accepted an unauthenticated session for the given username, this method returns "undef"
       but "auth_ok" returns true.

   <b>auth_ok</b>
       Returns true when the session is authenticated.

   <b>auth_password</b> <b>(</b> <b>username</b> <b>[,</b> <b>password</b> <b>[,</b> <b>callback</b> <b>]]</b> <b>)</b>
       Authenticates using a password.

       If the password has expired, if a callback code reference was  given,  it's  called  as  "callback($self,
       $username)"  and should return a password.  If no callback is provided, LIBSSH2_ERROR_PASSWORD_EXPIRED is
       returned.

   <b>auth_password_interact</b> <b>(</b> <b>username</b> <b>[,</b> <b>callback])</b>
       Prompts the user for the password interactively (requires Term::ReadKey).

   <b>auth_publickey</b> <b>(</b> <b>username,</b> <b>publickey_path,</b> <b>privatekey_path</b> <b>[,</b> <b>passphrase</b> <b>]</b> <b>)</b>
       Authenticate using the given private key and an optional passphrase.

       When libssh2 is compiled using OpenSSL as the crypto backend, passing this method "undef" as  the  public
       key argument is acceptable (OpenSSL is able to extract the public key from the private one).

       See also "Supported key formats".

   <b>auth_publickey_frommemory</b> <b>(</b> <b>username,</b> <b>publickey_blob,</b> <b>privatekey_blob</b> <b>[,</b> <b>passphrase</b> <b>]</b> <b>)</b>
       Authenticate  using the given public/private key and an optional passphrase. The keys must be PEM encoded
       (requires libssh2 1.6.0 or later with the OpenSSL backend).

   <b>auth_hostbased</b> <b>(</b> <b>username,</b> <b>publickey,</b> <b>privatekey,</b> <b>hostname,</b> <b>[,</b> <b>local</b> <b>username</b> <b>[,</b> <b>passphrase</b> <b>]]</b> <b>)</b>
       Host-based authentication using an optional passphrase. The local username defaults to be the same as the
       remote username.

   <b>auth_keyboard</b> <b>(</b> <b>username,</b> <b>password</b> <b>|</b> <b>callback</b> <b>)</b>
       Authenticate using "keyboard-interactive". Takes either a password, or a callback code reference which is
       invoked as "callback-&gt;(self, username, name, instruction, prompt...)" (where each prompt is a  hash  with
       "text"  and  "echo"  keys,  signifying  the  prompt  text  and  whether  the user input should be echoed,
       respectively) which should return an array of responses.

       If only a username is provided, the default callback will handle standard interactive responses (requires
       Term::ReadKey)

   <b>auth_agent</b> <b>(</b> <b>username</b> <b>)</b>
       Try to authenticate using an SSH agent (requires libssh2 1.2.3).

   <b>auth</b> <b>(</b> <b>...</b> <b>)</b>
       This is a general, prioritizing authentication mechanism that can use any of the  previous  methods.  You
       provide  it  some  parameters  and (optionally) a ranked list of methods you want considered (defaults to
       all). It will remove any unsupported methods or methods for which it doesn't have parameters (e.g. if you
       don't give it a public key, it can't use publickey or hostkey), and try the rest, returning whichever one
       succeeded or "undef" if they all failed. If a parameter is passed with an "undef" value, a default  value
       will be supplied if possible.

       The parameters are:

       rank
           An  optional  ranked  list  of methods to try.  The names should be the names of the Net::SSH2 "auth"
           methods, e.g.  "keyboard"  or  "publickey",  with  the  addition  of  "keyboard-auto"  for  automated
           "keyboard-interactive" and "password-interact" which prompts the user for the password interactively.

       username
       password
       publickey
       privatekey
           "privatekey" and "publickey" are file paths.

       passphrase
       hostname
       local_username
       interact
           If this option is set to a true value, interactive methods will be enabled.

       fallback
           If  a  password is given but authentication using it fails, the module will fall back to ask the user
           for another password if this parameter is set to a true value.

       cb_keyboard
           auth_keyboard callback.

       cb_password
           auth_password callback.

       For historical reasons and in order to maintain backward compatibility with older versions of the module,
       when the "password" argument is given, it is also used as  the  passphrase  (and  a  deprecation  warning
       generated).

       In order to avoid that behaviour the "passphrase" argument must be also passed (it could be "undef"). For
       instance:

         $ssh2-&gt;auth(username =&gt; $user,
                     privatekey =&gt; $privatekey_path,
                     publickey =&gt; $publickey_path,
                     password =&gt; $password,
                     passphrase =&gt; undef);

       This work around will be removed in a not too distant future version of the module.

   <b>flag</b> <b>(key,</b> <b>value)</b>
       Sets the given session flag.

       The currently supported flag values are:

       LIBSSH2_FLAG_COMPRESS
           If  set  before  the  connection  negotiation  is  performed, compression will be negotiated for this
           connection.

           Compression can also be enabled passing option "compress" to the constructor new.

       LIBSSH2_FLAG_SIGPIPE
           if set, Net::SSH2/libssh2 will not attempt to block SIGPIPEs but  will  let  them  trigger  from  the
           underlying socket layer.

   <b>keepalive_config(want_reply,</b> <b>interval)</b>
       Set how often keepalive messages should be sent.

       "want_reply"  indicates  whether  the  keepalive  messages  should  request  a  response from the server.
       "interval" is number of seconds that can pass without any I/O.

   <b>keepalive_send</b>
       Send a keepalive message if needed.

       On failure returns undef. On success returns how many seconds you can sleep after this  call  before  you
       need to call it again.

       Note that the underlying libssh2 function "libssh2_keepalive_send" can not recover from EAGAIN errors. If
       this method fails with such error, the SSH connection may become corrupted.

       The usage of this function is discouraged.

   <b>channel</b> <b>(</b> <b>[type,</b> <b>[window</b> <b>size,</b> <b>[packet</b> <b>size]]]</b> <b>)</b>
       Creates and returns a new channel object. See Net::SSH2::Channel.

       Type, if given, must be "session" (a reminiscence of an old, more generic, but never working wrapping).

   <b>tcpip</b> <b>(</b> <b>host,</b> <b>port</b> <b>[,</b> <b>shost,</b> <b>sport</b> <b>]</b> <b>)</b>
       Creates a TCP connection from the remote host to the given host:port, returning a new channel.

       The  "shost"  and  "sport"  arguments  are  merely informative and passed to the remote SSH server as the
       origin of the connection. They default to 127.0.0.1:22.

       Note that this method does <b>not</b> open a new port on the local machine and forwards incoming connections  to
       the remote side.

   <b>listen</b> <b>(</b> <b>port</b> <b>[,</b> <b>host</b> <b>[,</b> <b>bound</b> <b>port</b> <b>[,</b> <b>queue</b> <b>size</b> <b>]]]</b> <b>)</b>
       Sets up a TCP listening port on the remote host.  Host defaults to 0.0.0.0; if bound port is provided, it
       should be a scalar reference in which the bound port is returned. Queue size specifies the maximum number
       of queued connections allowed before the server refuses new connections.

       Returns a new Net::SSH2::Listener object.

   <b>scp_get</b> <b>(</b> <b>remote_path</b> <b>[,</b> <b>local_path</b> <b>]</b> <b>)</b>
       Retrieve a file with SCP. Local path defaults to basename of remote.

       Alternatively,  "local_path"  may  be an already open file handle or an IO::Handle object (e.g. IO::File,
       IO::Scalar).

   <b>scp_put</b> <b>(</b> <b>local_path</b> <b>[,</b> <b>remote_path</b> <b>]</b> <b>)</b>
       Send a file with SCP. Remote path defaults to same as local.

       Alternatively, "local_path" may be an already open file handle or a reference to a IO::Handle object  (it
       must have a valid stat method).

   <b>sftp</b>
       Return SecureFTP interface object (see Net::SSH2::SFTP).

       Note  that  SFTP  support  in libssh2 is pretty rudimentary. You should consider using Net::SFTP::Foreign
       with the Net::SSH2 backend Net::SFTP::Foreign::Backend::Net_SSH2 instead.

   <b>public_key</b>
       Return public key interface object (see Net::SSH2::PublicKey).

   <b>known_hosts</b>
       Returns known hosts interface object (see Net::SSH2::KnownHosts).

   <b>poll</b> <b>(</b> <b>timeout,</b> <b>arrayref</b> <b>of</b> <b>hashes</b> <b>)</b>
       <b>Deprecated</b>: the poll functionality in libssh2 is deprecated and its usage  disregarded.  Session  methods
       "sock" and "block_directions" can be used instead to integrate Net::SSH2 inside an external event loop.

       Pass in a timeout in milliseconds and an arrayref of hashes with the following keys:

       handle
           May  be  a  Net::SSH2::Channel  or  Net::SSH2::Listener object, integer file descriptor, or perl file
           handle.

       events
           Requested events.  Combination of LIBSSH2_POLLFD_*  constants  (with  the  POLL  prefix  stripped  if
           present), or an arrayref of the names ('in', 'hup' etc.).

       revents
           Returned  events.   Returns  a  hash with the (lowercased) names of the received events ('in', 'hup',
           etc.) as keys with true values, and a "value" key with the integer value.

       Returns undef on error, or the number of active objects.

   <b>block_directions</b>
       Get the blocked direction after some method returns "LIBSSH2_ERROR_EAGAIN".

       Returns "LIBSSH2_SESSION_BLOCK_INBOUND" or/and "LIBSSH2_SESSION_BLOCK_OUTBOUND".

   <b>debug</b> <b>(</b> <b>state</b> <b>)</b>
       Class method (affects all Net::SSH2 objects).

       Pass 1 to enable, 0 to disable. Debug output is sent to "STDERR".

   <b>blocking</b> <b>(</b> <b>flag</b> <b>)</b>
       Enable or disable blocking.

       A good number of the methods in "Net::SSH2"/"libssh2" can not work in non-blocking mode. Some of them may
       just forcibly enable blocking during its execution. A few may even corrupt the SSH session or  crash  the
       program.

       The  ones  that  can  be  safely  called  are  "read"  and,  with  some  caveats, "write". See "write" in
       Net::SSH2::Channel.

</pre><h4><b>INTEROPERABILITY</b> <b>AND</b> <b>OTHER</b> <b>KNOWN</b> <b>ISSUES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Protocol</b> <b>versions</b>
       The underlying "libssh2" library does support version 2  of  the  SSH  protocol  exclusively  (hopefully,
       version 1 usage is almost extinct.)

       The SFTP client implements version 3 of the SFTP protocol.

   <b>Key</b> <b>formats</b>
       Private  and  public keys can be generated and stored using different formats and cyphers. Which ones are
       accepted by "Net::SSH2" depends on the libssh2 version being used and of the underlying crypto backend it
       was configured to use at build time (OpenSSL "libssl" or "libgcrypt").

       An increasingly common problem is that OpenSSH since version 7.8 (released 2018-8-24) generates  keys  by
       default using the format RFC4716 which is not supported by the default crypto backend ("libssl").

       Keys can be converted inplace to the old PEM format using <b><a href="../man1/ssh-keygen.1.html">ssh-keygen</a></b>(1) as follows:

         $ ssh-keygen -p -m PEM -N "" -f <a href="file:~/.ssh/id_rsa">~/.ssh/id_rsa</a>

       On Windows, PuTTYgen (which is part of the PuTTY distribution) can be used to convert keys.

       Another  common issue is that in the last years OpenSSH has incorporated several new cyphers that are not
       supported by any version of "libssh2" yet. Currently the best option from an interoperability  standpoint
       is probably to stick to RSA key usage.

   <b>Security</b>
       Nowadays  "libssh2"  development is not thrilling; new versions (even minor ones) are being released just
       every two or three years. On the other hand security issues are found and reported far  more  frequently.
       That means that "Net::SSH2"/"libssh2" could be an easy attack vector.

       So,  Net::SSH2  should  be  used  only in trusted environments. More specifically, using it to connect to
       untrusted third party computers over the Internet is probably a very bad idea!
