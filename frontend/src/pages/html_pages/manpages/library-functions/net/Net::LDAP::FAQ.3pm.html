       Net::LDAP::FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions about Net::LDAP

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        perldoc Net::LDAP::FAQ

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This document serves to answer the most frequently asked questions on both the perl-ldap Mailing List and
       those sent to Graham Barr.

       The latest version of this FAQ can be found at

        <a href="http://ldap.perl.org/FAQ.html">http://ldap.perl.org/FAQ.html</a>

</pre><h4><b>GENERAL</b></h4><pre>
   <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>perl-ldap?</b>
       perl-ldap is the distribution name. The perl-ldap distribution contains the Net::LDAP modules.

   <b>Why</b> <b>another</b> <b>Perl</b> <b>LDAP</b> <b>implementation?</b>
       perl-ldap's goal is to be as portable as possible. It does this by being implemented completely in Perl.
       So basically anywhere that Perl runs perl-ldap will run. This is not true for other implementations which
       require a C compiler.

   <b>Where</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>it?</b>
       Perl-ldap is available from CPAN.  You can find the released versions at:

        <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/perl-ldap/">http://search.cpan.org/dist/perl-ldap/</a>

   <b>Is</b> <b>there</b> <b>a</b> <b>web</b> <b>page</b> <b>for</b> <b>perl-ldap?</b>
       Yes there is at <a href="http://ldap.perl.org/">http://ldap.perl.org/</a>

   <b>Is</b> <b>there</b> <b>a</b> <b>mailing</b> <b>list?</b>
       Yes there is at <a href="mailto:perl-ldap@perl.org">perl-ldap@perl.org</a>

       You can subscribe to this list by mailing <a href="mailto:perl-ldap-subscribe@perl.org">perl-ldap-subscribe@perl.org</a>

   <b>Is</b> <b>the</b> <b>mailing</b> <b>list</b> <b>archived?</b>
       Yes, at <a href="http://nntp.perl.org/group/perl.ldap">http://nntp.perl.org/group/perl.ldap</a>

       Archives with messages before we switched to using perl.org can be found at

        <a href="http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/">http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/</a>?l=perl-ldap-dev

       There is also an archive of the perl-ldap mailing list at

        <a href="http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl-ldap/">http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl-ldap/</a>

       which also has messages from before the move.

   <b>Is</b> <b>there</b> <b>any</b> <b>online</b> <b>documentation?</b>
       Yes. perl-ldap has online documentation at

        <a href="http://ldap.perl.org/">http://ldap.perl.org/</a>

       which will have the latest documentation available.

   <b>Is</b> <b>there</b> <b>a</b> <b>public</b> <b>repository?</b>
       Yes, there is a public Git repository at

        https://github.com/perl-ldap/perl-ldap

   <b>Can</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>perl-ldap</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>Git</b> <b>repository?</b>
       Yes, anyone can pull perl-ldap from the public Git repository on GitHub.

       There are several ways this can be done - see below.

       CPAN
           You can download it from CPAN by following the "Download" link on:

            <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/perl-ldap/">http://search.cpan.org/dist/perl-ldap/</a>

           Example;

            <a href="http://search.cpan.org/CPAN/authors/id/M/MA/MARSCHAP/perl-ldap-0.54.tar.gz">http://search.cpan.org/CPAN/authors/id/M/MA/MARSCHAP/perl-ldap-0.54.tar.gz</a>

       Git - fork on GitHub
           If  you  have  an  account  on  GitHub  (there's  a  free variant), you can easily fork the perl-ldap
           repository on GitHub.  When logged on to GitHub, navigate to the perl-ldap repository

            https://github.com/perl-ldap/perl-ldap

           and simply click on the "Fork" button near the top-right corner.

       Git - clone repository
           You can download latest development version of perl-ldap from GitHub by cloning the repository  using
           the command:

            git clone https://github.com/perl-ldap/perl-ldap.git

           This  command  will create a directory named 'perl-ldap' in your current directory containing a local
           clone of the repository.

           Keeping your local repository in sync with perl-ldap's GitHub repository is easy:

             cd perl-ldap
             git pull

       Web page
           Most of the time there is a URL link on the perl-ldap home page on ldap.perl.org that points  to  the
           latest  released version of perl-ldap.  Due to the fact that humans must update the web page to point
           to a new release it sometimes does not get updated as quickly as it should.

   <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>Git?</b>
       Git (see <a href="http://git-scm.com">http://git-scm.com</a>) is a distributed version control system designed to  keep  track  of  source
       changes  made  by groups of developers working on the same files, allowing them to stay in sync with each
       other as each individual chooses.

</pre><h4><b>LDAP</b> <b>AND</b> <b>DIRECTORY</b> <b>TERMINOLOGY.</b></h4><pre>
       In order to help the user understand the perl-ldap module better some key  LDAP  terminology  is  defined
       here.

   <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>directory?</b>
       A  directory  is  a special purpose hierarchical database that usually contains typed information such as
       text strings, binary data, or X.509 certificates.

   <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>LDAP?</b>
       LDAP stands for Lightweight Directory Access Protocol.   The  word  <u>Protocol</u>  is  the  key  word  in  the
       definition  given  in  the  preceding  sentence, LDAP is <u>NOT</u> hardware or software.  It is a protocol that
       defines how a client and server will communicate with one another.

       The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol is defined in a series of Requests For Comments,  better  known
       as  RFCs.  The RFCs can be found on the Internet at <a href="http://www.ietf.org/">http://www.ietf.org/</a> (the master repository) and many
       other  places.  There's  a   link   to   all   the   LDAP-related   RFCs   at   perl-ldap's   web   site,
       <a href="http://ldap.perl.org/rfc.html">http://ldap.perl.org/rfc.html</a>.  Some  of  the  more  important  RFC  numbers are RFC 4510 - 4519 for LDAP
       (previously called LDAPv3) and the historic RFC 1777 for LDAPv2.

   <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>LDAP</b> <b>Directory?</b>
       In the strictest terms of the definition there is no such thing as a LDAP  directory.   To  be  practical
       about  this  situation  every day directory professionals refer to their directory as " a LDAP directory"
       because it is easy to say and it does convey  the  type  of  protocol  used  to  communicate  with  their
       directory.   Using  this definition a LDAP directory is a directory whose server software conforms to the
       Lightweight Directory Access Protocol when communicating with a client.

   <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>Entry?</b>
       The traditional directory definition of a directory object is called an Entry. Entries  are  composed  of
       attributes that contain the information to be recorded about the object.

       (An entry in LDAP is somewhat analogous to a record in a table in an SQL database, but don't get too hung
       up about this analogy!)

       Entries are held in an upside-down tree structure. Entries can therefore contain subordinate entries, and
       entries <b>must</b> have one direct superior entry.

       Entries with subordinate entries are called 'non-leaf' entries.

       Entries without subordinate entries are called 'leaf' entries.

       An entry's direct superior entry is called the entry's 'parent'.

       'Non-leaf' entries are also said to have 'child' entries.

   <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>attribute?</b>
       The  entry(s)  in a directory are composed of attributes that contain information about the object.  Each
       attribute has a type and can contain one or more values.

       For example:

         cn=Road Runner

       is an attribute with a type named "cn", and one value.

       Each attribute is described by a 'syntax' which defines what kind of information can  be  stored  in  the
       attributes values.  Trying to store a value that doesn't conform to the attribute's syntax will result in
       an error.

       For example:

         jpegPhoto=unknown

       is not permitted by the directory, because jpegPhotos may only contain JPEG-formatted images.

       Most  syntaxes  used  in  LDAP  however  describe  text strings rather than binary objects (like JPEGs or
       certificates.)

       In LDAPv3 most of these syntaxes support Unicode encoded using UTF-8. Because the  Net::LDAP  modules  do
       not  change  the strings that you pass in as attribute values (they get sent to the LDAP server as-is) to
       use accented characters you simply need to encode your strings in UTF-8. There are modules on  CPAN  that
       will help you here.

       Note  that  LDAPv2  servers  used something called T.61 instead of Unicode and UTF-8. Most servers do not
       implement T.61 correctly, and it is recommended that you use LDAPv3 instead.

       Attributes may also be searched.  The  algorithms  used  to  perform  different  kinds  of  searches  are
       described by the attribute's 'matching rules'.  Some matching rules are case-sensitive and some are case-
       insensitive, for example.  Sometimes matching rules aren't defined for a particular attribute: there's no
       way to search for jpegPhotos that contain a substring!

       You can examine all of a server's attribute definitions by reading the schema from the server.

   <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>object</b> <b>class?</b>
       An  object  class is the name associated with a group of attributes that <b>must</b> be present in an entry, and
       the group of attributes that <b>may</b> also be present in an entry.

       Object classes may be derived (subclassed) from other  object  classes.   For  example  the  widely  used
       'inetOrgPerson'  object  class  is  derived  from  'organizationalPerson',  which  is itself derived from
       'person' which is itself derived from 'top'.

       Every entry has an attribute called 'objectClass' that lists all the names of object classes  (and  their
       superclasses) being used with the entry.

       You can examine all of a server's objectclass definitions by reading the schema from the server.

   <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>Distinguished</b> <b>Name</b> <b>(DN)?</b>
       Every  entry  in a directory has a Distinguished Name, or DN.  It is a unique Entry identifier throughout
       the complete directory.  No two Entries can have the same DN within the same directory.

       Examples of DNs:

        cn=Road Runner, ou=bird, dc=cartoon, dc=com
        ou=bird, dc=cartoon, dc=com
        dc=cartoon, dc=com
        dc=com

   <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>Relative</b> <b>Distinguished</b> <b>Name?</b>
       Every DN is made up of a sequence of Relative Distinguished Names, or RDNs.  The sequences  of  RDNs  are
       separated  by  commas  (,).  In  LDAPv2  semi-colons  (;)  were also allowed.  There can be more than one
       identical RDN in a directory, but they must have different parent entries.

       Technically, an RDN contains attribute-value assertions, or AVAs.  When  an  AVA  is  written  down,  the
       attribute name is separated from the attribute value with an equals (=) sign.

       Example of a DN:

        cn=Road Runner,ou=bird,dc=cartoon,dc=com

        RDNs of the proceeding DN:
        RDN =&gt; cn=Road Runner
        RDN =&gt; ou=bird
        RDN =&gt; dc=cartoon
        RDN =&gt; dc=com

       RDNs  can  contain  multiple attributes, though this is somewhat unusual. They are called multi-AVA RDNs,
       and each AVA is separated in the RDN from the others with a plus sign (+).

       Example of a DN with a multi-AVA RDN:

        cn=Road Runner+l=Arizona,ou=bird,dc=cartoon,dc=com

   <b>Where</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>entry's</b> <b>name</b> <b>held?</b>
       Entries do <b>not</b> contain their DN. When you retrieve an entry from a search, the server will tell  you  the
       DN of each entry.

       On  the  other  hand,  entries  <b>do</b>  contain  their  RDN.  Recall  that the RDN is formed from one or more
       attribute-value assertions (AVAs); each entry must contain all the attributes and values in the RDN.

       For example the entry:

        cn=Road Runner+l=Arizona,ou=bird,dc=cartoon,dc=com

       <b>must</b> contain a 'cn' attribute containing  at  least  the  value  "Road  Runner",  <b>and</b>  an  'l'  attribute
       containing at least the value "Arizona".

       The attributes used in the RDN may contain additional values, but the entry still only has one DN.

   <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>search</b> <b>base?</b>
       A search base is a Distinguished Name that is the starting point of search queries.

       Example of a DN:

        cn=Road Runner,ou=bird,dc=cartoon,dc=com

       Possible search base(s) for the proceeding DN:

        Base =&gt; cn=Road Runner,ou=bird,dc=cartoon,dc=com
        Base =&gt; ou=bird,dc=cartoon,dc=com
        Base =&gt; dc=cartoon,dc=com
        Base =&gt; dc=com

       Setting  the  search  base  to  the  lowest  possible  branch  of  the  directory  will speed up searches
       considerably.

   <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>a</b> <b>LDAP</b> <b>server</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>relational</b> <b>database?</b>
       The most basic difference is that a directory server is a specialized database designed to  provide  fast
       searches.  While  a  relational  database  is optimized for transactions (where a series of operations is
       counted as 1, thus if one of the steps fails, the RDBMS can roll-back to the state it was in  before  you
       started).

       Directories  also  typically are hierarchical in nature (RDBMS is typically flat, but you can implement a
       hierarchy using tables and queries), networkable, distributed and replicated.

       LDAP provides an open-standard to a directory service.

       Typically we use LDAP for email directories (all popular email clients provide an LDAP  client  now)  and
       authorization services (authentication and access control).

       You  could  use a RDBMS for these types of queries but there's no set standard, in particular over TCP/IP
       to connect to databases over the network. There's language specific protocols (like Perl's DBI and Java's
       JDBC) that hide this problem behind an API abstraction, but that's  not  a  replacement  for  a  standard
       access protocol.

       LDAP  is  starting  to be used on roles traditionally played by RDBMS in terms of general data management
       because it's easier to setup a LDAP server (once you understand the basic  nomenclature)  and  you  don't
       need a DBA to write your queries and more importantly all LDAP servers speak the same essential protocol,
       thus you don't have to fuss with a database driver trying to connect it to the Internet. Once you have an
       LDAP  server  up  and running, it's automatically available over the 'net.  It's possible to connect to a
       LDAP server from a variety of mechanisms, including just about every possible programming language.

   <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>a</b> <b>ldap</b> <b>reference</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>ldap</b> <b>referral?</b>
       A referral is returned when the <b>entire</b> operation must be resent to another server.

       A continuation reference is returned when <b>part</b> of the operation must be resent to another server.

       See RFC 4511 section 4.5.3 for more details.

</pre><h4><b>perl-ldap</b> <b>INSTALLATION</b></h4><pre>
   <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>install</b> <b>perl-ldap?</b>
       To install the modules that are in the perl-ldap distribution follow the same steps that  you  would  for
       most other distributions found on CPAN, that is

          # replace 0.62 with the version you have

          gunzip perl-ldap-0.62.tar.gz
          tar xvf perl-ldap-0.62.tar
          cd perl-ldap-0.62

          perl Makefile.PL
          make
          make test
          make install

   <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>make,</b> <b>how</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>install</b> <b>perl-ldap?</b>
       Well  as  luck  would  have  it  the modules in perl-ldap do not do anything complex, so a simple copy is
       enough to install. First run

         perl -V

       This will output information about the version of Perl you have installed. Near the bottom you will  find
       something like

         @INC:
           /usr/local/lib/perl/5.18.2
           /usr/local/share/perl/5.18.2
           /usr/lib/perl5
           <a href="file:/usr/share/perl5">/usr/share/perl5</a>
           /usr/lib/perl/5.18
           /usr/share/perl/5.18
           /usr/local/lib/site_per

       This  is a list of directories that Perl searches when it is looking for a module. The directory you need
       is  the  site_perl  directory,  but  without  the  system  architecture  name,  in  this   case   it   is
       "/usr/local/lib/site_perl". The files required can then be installed with

          # replace 0.62 with the version you have

          gunzip perl-ldap-0.62.tar.gz
          tar xvf perl-ldap-0.62.tar
          cd perl-ldap-0.62/lib

          cp -r * /usr/local/lib/site_perl

   <b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>load</b> <b>perl-ldap</b> <b>into</b> <b>an</b> <b>ActiveState</b> <b>Perl</b> <b>installation?</b>
       There are several ways that perl-ldap can be installed into an ActiveState Perl tree.

       1.  The  ActiveState  ppm  command  can be used to install perl-ldap.  When a new version of perl-ldap is
           released, it takes ActiveState a period of time to get the  new  release  into  the  ActiveState  ppm
           system.

       2.  If  the user has nmake installed, the user can do a normal Perl module install using nmake instead of
           make.

       3.  If the user does not have nmake or make, the user can  install  perl-ldap  using  the  install-nomake
           script by issuing the following command.

            perl install-nomake

           The install-nomake script can be used on any system that does not have make installed.

   <b>What</b> <b>other</b> <b>modules</b> <b>will</b> <b>I</b> <b>need?</b>
       perl-ldap uses other Perl modules. Some are required, but some are optional (i.e. required to use certain
       features only).

       If  you  are using a Linux system, many of the distributions have packages that you can install using the
       distribution's package management tools (e.g. apt, rpm, ...).

       Alternatively, you may use your favorite web search engine to find the package that you need.

       Convert::ASN1
           This module converts between Perl data structures and ASN.1, and is required for perl-ldap to work.

           You can obtain the latest release from
             <a href="http://search.cpan.org/search">http://search.cpan.org/search</a>?module=Convert::ASN1

       OpenSSL and IO::Socket::SSL
           If you want to use encrypted connections, either via start_tls or LDAPS connections,  you  will  need
           this module and the OpenSSL software package.

           You can obtain the latest release of IO::Socket::SSL from
             <a href="http://search.cpan.org/search">http://search.cpan.org/search</a>?module=IO::Socket::SSL

           You can obtain the latest release of OpenSSL from
             <a href="http://www.openssl.org/">http://www.openssl.org/</a>

       IO::Socket::INET6
           For  connecting to LDAP servers via IPv6, IO::Socket::INET6 is required.  Its presence is detected at
           runtime, so that perl-ldap can be installed without it, and automatically gains IPv6 support as  soon
           as IO::Socket::INET6 gets installed.

           You can obtain the latest releases from
             <a href="http://search.cpan.org/search">http://search.cpan.org/search</a>?module=IO::Socket::INET6

       IO::Socket::IP
           This  is  an alternative to using IO::Socket::INET6. Like that module, it gets detected automatically
           at runtime. If version 0.20 or higher is  installed,  is  is  preferred  over  IO::Socket::INET6  and
           IO::Socket::INET for all IP connections.

           You can obtain the latest releases from
             <a href="http://search.cpan.org/search">http://search.cpan.org/search</a>?module=IO::Socket::IP

       Authen::SASL
           This  module  is  optional.   You  only  need  to  install  Authen::SASL  if you want to use the SASL
           authentication methods.

           You can obtain the latest release from
             <a href="http://search.cpan.org/search">http://search.cpan.org/search</a>?module=Authen::SASL

       Digest::MD5
           This module is optional. It also requires a C compiler when installing.  You  only  need  to  install
           Digest::MD5 if you want to use the SASL DIGEST-MD5 authentication mechanism.

           You can obtain the latest release from

</pre><h4><b>USING</b> <b>NET::LDAP</b></h4><pre>
   <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>connect</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>server?</b>
       The connection to the server is created when you create a new Net::LDAP object, e.g.

         $ldap = Net::LDAP-&gt;new($server);

   <b>Net::LDAP-&gt;new</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>returns</b> <b>undef,</b> <b>why?</b>
       The constructor will return undef if there was a problem connecting to the specified  server.  Any  error
       message will be available in $@

   <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>proper</b> <b>format</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bind</b> <b>DN?</b>
       The DN used to bind to a directory is a FULLY QUALIFIED DN.  The exact structure of the DN will depend on
       what data has been stored in the server.

       The following are valid examples.

         uid=clif,ou=People,dc=umich,dc=edu

         cn=directory manager,ou=admins,dc=umich,dc=edu

       In some servers the following would be a valid fully qualified DN of the directory manager.

         cn=directory manager

   <b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>server</b> <b>returns</b> <b>an</b> <b>error,</b> <b>bind()</b> <b>always</b> <b>returns</b> <b>true?</b>
       Most  methods  in  Net::LDAP return a Net::LDAP::Message object, or a sub-class of that. This object will
       hold the results from the server, including the result code.

       So, for example, to determine the result of the bind operation.

         $mesg = $ldap-&gt;bind( $dn, password =&gt; $passwd );

         if ( $mesg-&gt;code ) {
           # Handle error codes here
         }

   <b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>set</b> <b>the</b> <b>LDAP</b> <b>version</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>connection</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>LDAP</b> <b>server?</b>
       This is done by adding the version option when connecting or binding to the LDAP server.

       For example;

         $ldap = Net::LDAP-&gt;new( $server, version =&gt; 3 );

       or

         $mesg = $ldap-&gt;bind( $dn, password =&gt; $passwd, version =&gt; 3 );

       Valid version numbers are 2 and 3.  As of perl-ldap 0.27 the default LDAP version is 3.

   <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>search</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>directory</b> <b>using</b> <b>the</b> <b>'search'</b> <b>method.</b> <b>Where</b> <b>did</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>go?</b>
       Your search results are stored in a 'search object'.  Consider the following:

        use Net::LDAP;

        $ldap = Net::LDAP-&gt;new('ldap.acme.com') or die "$@";
        $mesg = $ldap-&gt;search(
                              base   =&gt; "o=acme.com",
                              filter =&gt; "uid=jsmith",
                             );

       $mesg is a search object. It is a reference  blessed  into  the  Net::LDAP::Search  package.  By  calling
       methods on this object you can obtain information about the result and also the individual entries.

       The  first thing to check is if the search was successful. This is done with the method $mesg-&gt;code. This
       method will return the status code that the server returned. A success will yield a zero value, but there
       are other values, some of which could also be considered a success.  See Net::LDAP::Constant

         use Net::LDAP::Util qw(ldap_error_text);

         die ldap_error_text($mesg-&gt;code)
           if $mesg-&gt;code;

       There are two ways in which you can access the entries. You can access then with  an  index  or  you  can
       treat the container like a stack and shift each entry in turn. For example

         # as an array

         # How many entries were returned from the search
         my $max = $mesg-&gt;count;

         for (my $index = 0 ; $index &lt; $max ; $index++) {
           my $entry = $mesg-&gt;entry($index);
           # ...
         }

         # or as a stack

         while (my $entry = $mesg-&gt;shift_entry) {
           # ...
         }

       In  each  case $entry is an entry object. It is a reference blessed into the Net::LDAP::Entry package. By
       calling methods on this object you can obtain information about the entry.

       For example, to obtain the DN for the entry

         $dn = $entry-&gt;dn;

       To obtain the attributes that a given entry has

         @attrs = $entry-&gt;attributes;

       And to get the list of values for a given attribute

         @values = $entry-&gt;get( 'sn' );

       And to get the first of the values for a given attribute

         $values = $entry-&gt;get( 'cn' );

       One thing to remember is that attribute names are case insensitive, so 'sn', 'Sn', 'sN' and 'SN' are  all
       the same.

       So, if you want to print all the values for the attribute 'ou' then this is as simple as

         foreach ($entry-&gt;get_value( 'ou' )) {
             print $_,"\n";
           }

       Now if you just want to print all the values for all the attributes you can do

         foreach my $attr ($entry-&gt;attributes) {
           foreach my $value ($entry-&gt;get_value($attr)) {
             print $attr, ": ", $value, "\n";
           }
         }

   <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>limit</b> <b>the</b> <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>directory</b> <b>search?</b>
       You limit the scope of a directory search by setting the scope parameter of search request.  Consider the
       following:

        use Net::LDAP;

        $ldap = Net::LDAP-&gt;new('ldap.acme.com') or die "$@";
        $mesg = $ldap-&gt;search(
                              base   =&gt; "o=acme.com",
                              scope  =&gt; 'sub',
                              filter =&gt; "uid=jsmith",
                             );

       Values for the scope parameter are as follows.

       base
           Search only the base object.

       one Search the entries immediately below the base object.

       sub
       subtree
           Search the whole tree below (and including) the base object.  This is the default.

       children
           Search the whole subtree below the base object, excluding the base object itself.

           Note: <u>children</u> scope requires LDAPv3 subordinate feature extension.

</pre><h4><b>GETTING</b> <b>SEARCH</b> <b>RESULTS</b></h4><pre>
       There  are  two ways of retrieving the results of a requested LDAP search; inline and by using a callback
       subroutine.

   <b>USING</b> <b>THE</b> <b>INLINE</b> <b>APPROACH</b>
       Using the inline approach involves requesting the data and then  waiting  for  all  of  the  data  to  be
       returned before the user starts processing the data.

       Example:

        use Net::LDAP;

        $ldap = Net::LDAP-&gt;new('ldap.acme.com') or die "$@";
        $mesg = $ldap-&gt;search(
                              base   =&gt; "o=acme.com",
                              scope  =&gt; 'sub',
                              filter =&gt; "sn=smith",
                             );
        #
        # At this point the user can get the returned data as an array
        # or as a stack.
        # In this example we will use an array

        # How many entries were returned from the search
        my $max = $mesg-&gt;count;

        for (my $index = 0 ; $index &lt; $max ; $index++)
        {
          my $entry = $mesg-&gt;entry($index);
          my $dn = $entry-&gt;dn; # Obtain DN of this entry

          @attrs = $entry-&gt;attributes; # Obtain attributes for this entry.
          foreach my $var (@attrs)
          {
            #get a list of values for a given attribute
            $attr = $entry-&gt;get_value( $var, asref =&gt; 1 );
            if ( defined($attr) )
            {
              foreach my $value ( @$attr )
              {
                print "$var: $value\n";  # Print each value for the attribute.
              }
            }
          }
        }

       As you can see the example is straightforward, but there is one drawback to this approach.  You must wait
       until  all  entries  for  the  request  search  to be returned before you can process the data.  If there
       several thousand entries that match the search filter this could take quite a long time period.

   <b>USING</b> <b>THE</b> <b>CALLBACK</b> <b>SUBROUTINE</b> <b>APPROACH</b>
       Using the callback approach involves requesting the data be sent to a callback subroutine as  each  entry
       arrives at the client.

       A  callback  is  just  a  subroutine  that is passed two parameters when it is called, the mesg and entry
       objects.

       Example:

        use Net::LDAP;

        $ldap = Net::LDAP-&gt;new('ldap.acme.com') or die "$@";
        $mesg = $ldap-&gt;search(
                              base   =&gt; "o=acme.com",
                              scope  =&gt; 'sub',
                              filter =&gt; "sn=smith",
                              callback =&gt; \&amp;callback,
                             );
        #
        # At this point the user needs to check the status of the
        # ldap search.
        #

        if ( $mesg-&gt;code )
        {
           $errstr = $mesg-&gt;code;
           print "Error code:  $errstr\n";
           $errstr = ldap_error_text($errstr);
           print "$errstr\n";
        }

        sub callback
        {
        my ( $mesg, $entry) = @_;

          #
          # First you must check to see if something was returned.
          # Last execution of callback subroutine will have no
          # defined entry and mesg object
          #
          if ( !defined($entry) )
          {
            print "No records found matching filter $match.\n"
            if ($mesg-&gt;count == 0) ; # if mesg is not defined nothing will print.
            return;
          }

          my $dn = $entry-&gt;dn; # Obtain DN of this entry

          @attrs = $entry-&gt;attributes; # Obtain attributes for this entry.
          foreach my $var (@attrs)
          {
           #get a list of values for a given attribute
           $attr = $entry-&gt;get_value( $var, asref =&gt; 1 );
           if ( defined($attr) )
           {
             foreach my $value ( @$attr )
             {
               print "$var: $value\n";  # Print each value for the attribute.
             }
           }
          }
          #
          # For large search requests the following line of code
          # may be very important, it will reduce the amount of memory
          # used by the search results.
          #
          # If the user is not worried about memory usage then the line
          # of code can be omitted.
          #
          $mesg-&gt;pop_entry;

        }  # End of callback subroutine

       As you can see the example is straightforward and it does not waste time waiting for all of  the  entries
       to  be returned.  However if the pop_entry method is not used the callback approach can allocate a lot of
       memory to the search request.

</pre><h4><b>USING</b> <b>NET::LDAPS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Using</b> <b>an</b> <b>SSL</b> <b>network</b> <b>connection,</b> <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>connect</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>server?</b>
       This class is a subclass of Net::LDAP so all the normal Net::LDAP methods can be used with  a  Net::LDAPS
       object;  see  the  documentation for Net::LDAP to find out how to query a directory server using the LDAP
       protocol.

       The connection to the server is created when you create a new Net::LDAPS object, e.g.

         $ldaps = Net::LDAPS-&gt;new($server,
                                  port =&gt; '10000',
                                  verify =&gt; 'require',
                                  capath =&gt; '/usr/local/cacerts/',
                                  );

       Starting with version 0.28 perl-ldap also supports URIs in the new method.  So, the  above  can  also  be
       expressed as:

         $ldaps = Net::LDAP-&gt;new("ldaps://$server",
                                  port =&gt; '10000',
                                  verify =&gt; 'require',
                                  capath =&gt; '/usr/local/cacerts/',
                                  );

       There  are  additional  options  to  the  new method with LDAPS URIs and the LDAPS new method and several
       additional methods are included in the LDAPS object class.

       For further information and code examples read the LDAPS module documentation;  perldoc Net::LDAPS

</pre><h4><b>USING</b> <b>LDAP</b> <b>GROUPS.</b></h4><pre>
   <b>What</b> <b>are</b> <b>LDAP</b> <b>groups?</b>
       LDAP groups are object classes that contain an attribute that can store multiple DN values.  Two standard
       object classes are 'groupOfNames' (which has a 'member' attribute) and 'groupOfUniqueNames' (which has  a
       'uniqueMember' attribute.)

       According  to  the  RFCs  a group can be a member of another group, but some LDAP server vendors restrict
       this flexibility by not allowing nested groups in their servers.

       Two scripts for working with groups are available in the contrib directory.   They  are  isMember.pl  and
       printMembers.pl.

   <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>format</b> <b>a</b> <b>filter</b> <b>to</b> <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>entries</b> <b>whose</b> <b>'member'</b> <b>attribute</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>particular</b> <b>value?</b>
       Asking  for  (member=*)  is  OK  - the directory uses the equality matching rule which is defined for the
       member attribute.

       Asking for (member=c*) is not OK - there is no defined substring matching rule for the member  attribute.
       That's  because  the  member  values  are  *not*  strings, but distinguished names. There is no substring
       matching rule for DNs, see RFC 4519 section 2.7.

       What you have to do is get the results of (member=*) and  then  select  the  required  results  from  the
       returned  values.  You need to do this using knowledge of the string representation of DNs defined in RFC
       4514, which is important because the same DN can have different string representations. So  you  need  to
       perform some canonicalization if you want to be correct.

</pre><h4><b>USING</b> <b>DSML.</b></h4><pre>
   <b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>access</b> <b>DSML</b> <b>features</b> <b>from</b> <b>perl-ldap?</b>
       Directory  Service  Markup  Language  (DSML)  is  the  XML  standard  for  representing directory service
       information in XML.

       Support for DSML is included in perl-ldap starting with version .20.

       At the moment this module only reads and writes  DSML  entry  entities.  It  cannot  process  any  schema
       entities because schema entities are processed differently than elements.

       Eventually  this  module  will be a full level 2 consumer and producer enabling you to give you full DSML
       conformance.

       The specification for DSML is at <a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/specs/">http://www.oasis-open.org/specs/</a>

   <b>Are</b> <b>there</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>code</b> <b>examples.</b>
       Yes,  there  is  an  Examples  pod  file.   To  view  the  pod  do  the   following   command;    perldoc
       Net::LDAP::Examples

       There  is  user  contributed  software  in  the  contrib  directory  that  is supplied with the perl-ldap
       distribution.  This is an excellent source of information on how to use the perl-ldap module.

   <b>Are</b> <b>there</b> <b>any</b> <b>performance</b> <b>issues</b> <b>with</b> <b>perl-ldap?</b>
       In the vast majority of use cases (one user has suggested 9 out of 10) there are  no  performance  issues
       with perl-ldap.

       Where you may wish to use perl-ldap to perform, for example, a very large number of queries (e.g. 10,000)
       in  succession  you  may  find  a  noticeable  performance difference between perl-ldap and non pure-Perl
       modules. This is not because of perl-ldap itself but because of the pure-Perl Convert::ASN1  module  that
       it depends on.

       You should make up your own mind, based upon your own situation (performance requirements, hardware etc.)
       as to whether you should use perl-ldap or not. The figures quoted in this answer are only indicative, and
       will differ for different people.

   <b>Can</b> <b>I</b> <b>contribute</b> <b>Perl</b> <b>scripts</b> <b>that</b> <b>use</b> <b>perl-ldap</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>contrib</b> <b>section?</b>
       Any one can submit a Perl script that uses perl-ldap for inclusion in the contrib section.  The perl-ldap
       maintainers will determiner if the script will be included and will do the initial check in of the script
       to the Git repository at https://github.com/perl-ldap/perl-ldap.

       There are a couple of requirements for consideration.

       You must supply a one line description of your script to be included in the contrib README file.

       Inside  the  script  will  be  the  pod documentation for the script.  No auxiliary documentation will be
       allowed.  For examples of how to do this see the tklkup script currently in the contrib section.

   <b>Is</b> <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>complete</b> <b>entry,</b> <b>DN</b> <b>and</b> <b>attributes</b> <b>without</b> <b>specifying</b> <b>the</b> <b>attributes</b> <b>name?</b>
       Yes, just specify you want a list of no attributes back. The RFC says  that  this  tells  the  server  to
       return all readable attributes back (there may be access controls to prevent some from being returned.)

       So in the search method, just set (for LDAPv2):

                       attrs =&gt; [ ]

       If  you  are  using  LDAPv3,  you  can  specify  an  attribute called "*" instead, which lets you ask for
       additional (i.g. operational) attributes in the same search.

                       attrs =&gt; [ "*" ]

       To get all operational attributes in a search, some servers allow the use of the "+" pseudo attribute. So
       that with these servers

                       attrs =&gt; [ "*", "+" ]

       will return the most information from the server.

       Follow the following code example, replacing the (...) with whatever is relevant to your setup.

         use Net::LDAP;
         use Net::LDAP::Util qw(ldap_error_text);

                 $res = $ldap-&gt;modify(...,

   <b>What</b> <b>happens</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>delete</b> <b>an</b> <b>attribute</b> <b>that</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>exist?</b>
       It is an error to delete an attribute that doesn't exist.  When you get the error back the server ignores
       the entire modify operation you sent it, so you need to make sure the error doesn't happen.

       Another approach, if you are using LDAPv3 (note beginning with  version  .27  Net::LDAP  uses  LDAPv3  by
       default)  is  to  use  a 'replace' with your attribute name and no values.  In LDAPv3, this is defined to
       always work even if that attribute doesn't exist in the entry.

       I.e.:

         my $mesg = $ldap-&gt;modify( $entry, replace =&gt; { %qv_del_arry } );

       But make sure  you  are  using  LDAPv3,  because  that  is  defined  to  <b>not</b>  work  in  LDAPv2.  (A  nice
       incompatibility between LDAPv2 and LDAPv3.)

   <b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>delete</b> <b>a</b> <b>referral</b> <b>from</b> <b>an</b> <b>LDAP</b> <b>tree?</b>
       Since  this  is a proprietary feature, you will have to check your server's documentation. You might find
       that you need to use a control. If there is a control called something like ManageDsaIT, that's  the  one
       you  should  probably  use.   For  proper  operation  you  will  need  the  oid  number  for ManageDsaIT;
       2.16.840.1.113730.3.4.2 and do not specify a value for type.

       The code required will look similar to the following code snippet.

         $mesg =  $ldap-&gt;delete("ref=\"ldap://acme/c=us,o=bricks\",o=clay",
                         control =&gt; {type =&gt; "2.16.840.1.113730.3.4.2"} );

   <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>add</b> <b>an</b> <b>ACI/ACL</b> <b>entry</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>directory</b> <b>server</b> <b>with</b> <b>perl-ldap?</b>
       ACIs and ACLs are proprietary features in  LDAP.  The  following  code  snippet  works  with  a  Netscape
       directory server. You will need the specify the correct DN (-DN-) and correct attribute(s) (-ATTRNAMEs-).

         my $aci = '(target="ldap:///-DN-")(targetattr="-ATTRNAMEs-")(version 3.0;
                     acl "-ACLNAME-"; deny(all) userdn = "ldap:///self";)' ;

         $ldap-&gt;modify($dn_modif, add =&gt; {'aci' =&gt; $aci });

   <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>file</b> <b>type</b> <b>and</b> <b>data</b> <b>type</b> <b>mis-matching</b> <b>when</b> <b>loading</b> <b>data</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>Win32</b> <b>system?</b>
       When  loading a binary attribute with data read from a file on a Win32 system, it has been noted that you
       should set "binmode" on the file before reading the file contents into the data array.

       Another possible solution to this problem is to convert the binary data into a base64 encoded string  and
       then  store the encoded string in the file.  Then when reading the file, decode the base64 encoded string
       back to binary and then use perl-ldap to store the data in the directory.

   <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>create</b> <b>an</b> <b>account</b> <b>in</b> <b>Active</b> <b>Directory?</b>
       Active Directory accounts need some AD-specific attributes (only the method we're interested in, no error
       checking):

         $mesg = $ldap-&gt;add( 'cn=John Doe,cn=Users,dc=your,dc=ads,dc=domain',
                             attrs =&gt; [
                               objectClass =&gt; [ qw/top user/ ],
                               cn =&gt; 'John Doe',
                               sn =&gt; 'Doe',
                               givenName =&gt; 'John',
                               displayName =&gt; 'John "the one" Doe',
                               userAccountControl =&gt; 514,      # disabled regular user
                               sAMAccountName =&gt; 'JohnDoe',
                               userPrincipalName =&gt; '<a href="mailto:JohnDoe@your.ads.domain">JohnDoe@your.ads.domain</a>'
                             ]
                           );

       In order to find out what other attributes can  be  set,  interactively  edit  the  user  in  the  Active
       Directory  Users and Computers MCC plugin, perform an LDAP search operation to find out what changed, and
       update your "add" routine accordingly.

   <b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>in</b> <b>Active</b> <b>Directory?</b>
       Similar to accounts, groups need some AD-specific attributes too:

         $mesg = $ldap-&gt;add( 'cn=NewGroup,cn=Users,dc=your,dc=ads,dc=domain',
                             attrs =&gt; [
                               objectClass =&gt; [ qw/top group/ ],
                               cn =&gt; 'NewGroup',
                               sAMAccountName =&gt; 'NewGroup',
                               groupType =&gt; 0x80000002         # global, security enabled group
                             ]
                           );

   <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>disabled</b> <b>accounts</b> <b>in</b> <b>Active</b> <b>Directory</b>
       The bit values in "userAccountControl" require the LDAP_MATCHING_RULE_BIT_AND matching rule's OID  to  be
       used in an extensible filter term:

         $mesg = $ldap-&gt;search( base   =&gt; 'cn=Users,dc=your,dc=ads,dc=domain',
                                filter =&gt; '(&amp;(objectclass=user)' .
                                             (userAccountControl:1.2.840.113556.1.4.803:=2))',
                                attrs  =&gt; [ '1.1' ]
                              );

   <b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>security</b> <b>groups</b> <b>in</b> <b>Active</b> <b>Directory</b>
       With groups, the same applies to the "groupType" bit-field:

         $mesg = $ldap-&gt;search( base   =&gt; 'cn=Users,dc=your,dc=ads,dc=domain',
                                filter =&gt; '(&amp;(objectclass=group)' .
                                             (groupType:1.2.840.113556.1.4.803:=2147483648))',
                                             # 2147483648 = 0x80000000
                                attrs  =&gt; [ '1.1' ]
                              );

   <b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>in</b> <b>AD</b> <b>(including</b> <b>group</b> <b>nesting)?</b>
       AD  allows you to find all members of a specified group, the direct members plus those that are member of
       the group via group nesting.

       The trick to this is the special "LDAP_MATCHING_RULE_IN_CHAIN" matching rule:

         $mesg = $ldap-&gt;search( base   =&gt; 'cn=Users,dc=your,dc=ads,dc=domain',
                                filter =&gt; '(memberOf:1.2.840.113556.1.4.1941:=cn=Testgroup,dc=your,dc=ads,dc=domain)',
                                attrs  =&gt; [ '1.1' ]
                              );

   <b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>groups</b> <b>one</b> <b>user</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>member</b> <b>of</b> <b>in</b> <b>AD</b> <b>(including</b> <b>group</b> <b>nesting)?</b>
       Similarly you can search for all the groups one user is member of, either directly or via group nesting.

         $mesg = $ldap-&gt;search( base   =&gt; 'dc=your,dc=ads,dc=domain',
                                filter =&gt; '(member:1.2.840.113556.1.4.1941:=cn=TestUser,ou=Users,dc=your,dc=ads,dc=domain)',
                                attrs  =&gt; [ '1.1' ]
                              );

   <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>group</b> <b>in</b> <b>AD?</b>
       AD normally restricts the number of attribute values returned in one query.  The exact number depends  on
       the AD server version: it was ~1000 in Win2000, 1500 in Win2003 and is 5000 in Win2008 &amp; Win2008R2.

       Performing the same standard search again will yield the same values again.

       So, how can you get all members of a really large AD group?

       The  trick to use here is to use Microsoft's <u>range</u> <u>option</u> when searching, i.e instead of doing one search
       for plain "member", perform multiple searches for e.g. "member;range=1000-*"  where  the  range  starting
       index increases accordingly:

         my $mesg;
         my @members;
         my $index = 0;

         while ($index ne '*') {
           $mesg = $ldap-&gt;search( base   =&gt; 'cn=Testgroup,dc=your,dc=ads,dc=domain',
                                  filter =&gt; '(objectclass=group)',
                                  scope  =&gt; 'base',
                                  attrs  =&gt; [ ($index &gt; 0) ? "member;range=$index-*" : 'member' ]
                                );
           if ($mesg-&gt;code == LDAP_SUCCESS) {
             my $entry = $mesg-&gt;<a href="../man0/entry.0.html">entry</a>(0);
             my $attr;

             # large group: let's do the range option dance
             if (($attr) = grep(/^member;range=/, $entry-&gt;attributes)) {
               push(@members, $entry-&gt;get_value($attr));

               if ($attr =~ /^member;range=\d+-(.*)$/) {
                 $index = $1;
                 $index++  if ($index ne '*');
               }
             }
             # small group: no need for the range dance
             else {
               @members = $entry-&gt;get_value('member');
               last;
             }
           }
           # failure
           else {
             last;
           }
         }

         if ($mesg-&gt;code == LDAP_SUCCESS) {
           # success: @members contains the members of the group
         }
         else {
           # failure: deal with the error in $mesg
         }

   <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>reset</b> <b>a</b> <b>user's</b> <b>password</b> <b>...</b>
       <u>...</u> <u>in</u> <u>most</u> <u>LDAP</u> <u>servers?</u>

       Most LDAP servers use the standard userPassword attribute as the attribute to set when you want to change
       a user's password.

       They  usually allow one to set the password either using the regular modify operation on the userPassword
       attribute or using the extended LDAP Password Modify operation defined in RFC3062.

       The recommended method is the extended Password Modify operation, which offers a standardized way to  set
       user passwords but unfortunately is not available on all LDAP servers.

       Whether  the  extended Password Modify operation is available can be found out by searching the attribute
       supportedExtension for the value 1.3.6.1.4.1.4203.1.11.1 in the RootDSE object.

       If the extended Password Modify operation is not available the alternative is the regular modification of
       the userPassword attribute.

       But this method has some drawbacks:

       •   Depending on the type of the server the arguments to the modify operations may vary.  Some  want  the
           modify  done  with  replace, some want it done by explicitly deleting the old password and add of the
           new one.  This may even depend on whether you change the  password  for  the  bound  user  or  as  an
           administrator for another user.

       •   With  the  modify  operation  some servers expect the client to do the hashing of the password on the
           client side. I.e. all clients that set passwords need to agree on the algorithm and the format of the
           hashed password.

       •   Some LDAP servers do not allow setting the password if the connection is  not  sufficiently  secured.
           I.e. require SSL or TLS support to set the password (which is heavily recommended anyway ;-)

       Here is an example of how to change your own password (for brevity's sake error checking is left out):

         use Net::LDAP;

         my $ldap = Net::LDAP-&gt;new('ldaps://server.domain')  or  die "$@";
         my $mesg = $ldap-&gt;bind('cn=Joe User,dc=perl,dc=ldap,dc=org',
                                password =&gt; 'oldPW');

         my $rootdse = $ldap-&gt;root_dse();

         if ($rootdse-&gt;supported_extension('1.3.6.1.4.1.4203.1.11.1')) {

             require Net::LDAP::Extension::SetPassword;

             $mesg = $ldap-&gt;set_password(user =&gt; 'cn=Joe User,dc=perl,dc=ldap,dc=org',
                                         oldpasswd =&gt; 'oldPW',
                                         newpasswd =&gt; 'newPW');
         }
         else {
             $mesg = $ldap-&gt;modify('cn=Joe User,dc=perl,dc=ldap,dc=org',
                                   changes =&gt; [
                                       delete =&gt; [ userPassword =&gt; $oldPW ]
                                       add    =&gt; [ userPassword =&gt; $newPW ] ]);
         }

         $ldap-&gt;unbind();

       <u>...</u> <u>in</u> <u>MS</u> <u>Active</u> <u>Directory?</u>

       With  Active  Directory  a  user's  password  is stored in the unicodePwd attribute and changed using the
       regular modify operation.

       ADS expects this password to be encoded in Unicode - UTF-16 to be exact.  Before the  Unicode  conversion
       is done the password needs to be surrounded by double quotes which do not belong to the user's password.

       For the password modify operation to succeed SSL is required.

       When  changing the password for the user bound to the directory ADS expects it to be done by deleting the
       old password and adding the new one.  When doing it as a user with  administrative  privileges  replacing
       the unicodePwd's value with a new one is allowed too.

       Perl-ldap  contains  convenience  methods  for  Active Directory that allow one to perform this task very
       easily.

       Here's an example that demonstrates setting your own password from $oldPW  to  $newPW  (again  almost  no
       error checking):

         use Net::LDAP;
         use Net::LDAP::Extra qw(AD);

         my $ldap = Net::LDAP-&gt;new('ldaps://ads.domain.controller')  or  die "$@";

         my $mesg = $ldap-&gt;bind('cn=Joe User,dc=your,dc=ads,dc=domain',
                                password =&gt; $oldPW);

         $mesg = $ldap-&gt;change_ADpassword('cn=Joe User,dc=your,dc=ads,dc=domain',
                                          $oldPW, $newPW);

         $ldap-&gt;unbind();

       And the same for perl-ldap versions before 0.49, where everything needs to be done by hand:

         use Net::LDAP;
         use Unicode::Map8;
         use Unicode::String qw(utf16);

         # build the conversion map from your local character set to Unicode
         my $charmap = Unicode::Map8-&gt;new('latin1')  or  die;

         # surround the PW with double quotes and convert it to UTF-16
         # byteswap() was necessary in experiments on i386 Linux, YMMV
         my $oldUniPW = $charmap-&gt;tou('"'.$oldPW.'"')-&gt;byteswap()-&gt;utf16();
         my $newUniPW = $charmap-&gt;tou('"'.$newPW.'"')-&gt;byteswap()-&gt;utf16();

         my $ldap = Net::LDAP-&gt;new('ldaps://ads.domain.controller')  or  die "$@";

         my $mesg = $ldap-&gt;bind('cn=Joe User,dc=your,dc=ads,dc=domain',
                                password =&gt; $oldPW);

         $mesg = $ldap-&gt;modify('cn=Joe User,dc=your,dc=ads,dc=domain',
                               changes =&gt; [
                                   delete =&gt; [ unicodePwd =&gt; $oldUniPW ]
                                   add    =&gt; [ unicodePwd =&gt; $newUniPW ] ]);

         $ldap-&gt;unbind();

   <b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>simulate</b> <b>server</b> <b>failover?</b>
       Perl-ldap  does  not do server failover, however there are several programming options for getting around
       this situation.

       Here is one possible solution:

         $ldaps = Net::LDAPS-&gt;new([ $ldapserverone, $ldapservertwo ],
                                  port=&gt;636, timeout=&gt;5)  or  die "$@";

       For perl-ldap versions before 0.27, the same goal can be achieved using:

         unless ( $ldaps =
                   Net::LDAPS-&gt;new($ldapserverone,
                                   port=&gt;636,timeout=&gt;5) )
                 {
                     $ldaps = Net::LDAPS-&gt;new($ldapservertwo,
                                              port=&gt;636,timeout=&gt;20) ||
                     return
                     "Can't connect to $ldapserverone or $ldapservertwo via LDAPS: $@";
                 }

</pre><h4><b>Using</b> <b>X.509</b> <b>certificates.</b></h4><pre>
   <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>store</b> <b>X.509</b> <b>certificates</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>directory?</b>
       The first problem here is that there are many different formats to hold certificates in, for example PEM,
       DER, PKCS#7 and PKCS#12. The directory <b>only</b> uses the DER format (more correctly, it  only  uses  the  BER
       format) which is a binary format.

       Your first job is to ensure that your certificates are therefore in DER/BER format. You could use OpenSSL
       to convert from PEM like this:

         openssl x509 -inform PEM -in cert.pem -outform DER -out cert.der

       Consult the OpenSSL documentation to find out how to perform other conversions.

       To  add a certificate to the directory, just slurp in the DER/BER certificate into a scalar variable, and
       add it to the entry's userCertificate attribute. How you do that will depend on which version of LDAP you
       are using.

       To slurp in the certificate try something like this:

         my $cert;
         {
             local $/ = undef; # Slurp mode
             open CERT, "cert.der" or die;
             binmode CERT;     # for Windows e.a.
             $cert = &lt;CERT&gt;;
             close CERT;
         }
         # The certificate is now in $cert

       For LDAPv2, because most directory vendors ignore the string representation of  certificates  defined  in
       RFC 1778, you should add this value to the directory like this:

         $res = $ldap-&gt;modify("cn=My User, o=My Company,c=XY",
                              add =&gt; [
                                      'userCertificate' =&gt; [ $cert ]
                                     ]);
         die "Modify failed (" . ldap_error_name($res-&gt;code) . ")\n"
             if $res-&gt;code;

       For LDAPv3, you must do this instead:

         $res = $ldap-&gt;modify("cn=My User, o=My Company, c=XY",
                              add =&gt; [
                                      'userCertificate;binary' =&gt; [ $cert ]
                                     ]);
         die "Modify failed (" . ldap_error_name($res-&gt;code) . ")\n"
             if $res-&gt;code;

       Of  course,  the  entry  you are trying to add the certificate to must use object classes that permit the
       userCertificate attribute, otherwise the modify will fail with  an  object  class  violation  error.  The
       inetOrgPerson  structural  object  class  permits  userCertificates, as does the strongAuthenticationUser
       auxiliary object class. Others might also.

   <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>search</b> <b>objects</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>contents</b> <b>of</b> <b>certificates.</b>
       The directory needs to support one or more of the certificate*Match matching rules.

       Then using the filter (for certificateExactMatch)

         (userCertificate={ serialNumber 1234, issuer "cn=CA,o=TrustCenter" })

       allows searching for the objects containing the attribute userCertificate  with  a  certificate  matching
       these criteria.

       Please  note  that the exact syntax of the values for the serialNumber and the issuer above may depend on
       the LDAP server.  In any case the example above works with OpenLDAP 2.4.33.
