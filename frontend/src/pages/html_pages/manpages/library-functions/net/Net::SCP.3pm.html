</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Net::SCP - Perl extension for secure copy protocol

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         #procedural interface
         use Net::SCP qw(scp iscp);
         scp($source, $destination);
         iscp($source, $destination); #shows command, asks for confirmation, and
                                      #allows user to type a password on tty

         #OO interface
         $scp = Net::SCP-&gt;new( "hostname", "username" );
         #with named params
         $scp = Net::SCP-&gt;new( { "host"=&gt;$hostname, "user"=&gt;$username } );
         $scp-&gt;get("filename") or die $scp-&gt;{errstr};
         $scp-&gt;put("filename") or die $scp-&gt;{errstr};
         #tmtowtdi
         $scp = new Net::SCP;
         $scp-&gt;scp($source, $destination);

         #Net::FTP-style
         $scp = Net::SCP-&gt;new("hostname");
         $scp-&gt;login("user");
         $scp-&gt;cwd("/dir");
         $scp-&gt;size("file");
         $scp-&gt;get("file");

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Simple wrappers around ssh and scp commands.

</pre><h4><b>SUBROUTINES</b></h4><pre>
       scp SOURCE, DESTINATION
           Can be called either as a subroutine or a method; however, the subroutine interface is deprecated.

           Calls  scp  in  batch  mode, with the <b>-B</b> <b>-p</b> <b>-q</b> and <b>-r</b> options.  Returns false upon error, with a text
           error message accessible in $scp-&gt;{errstr}.

           Returns false and sets the <b>errstr</b> attribute if there is an error.

       iscp SOURCE, DESTINATION
           Can be called either as a subroutine or a method; however, the subroutine interface is deprecated.

           Prints the scp command to be execute, waits for the user to confirm, and (optionally)  executes  scp,
           with the <b>-p</b> and <b>-r</b> flags.

           Returns false and sets the <b>errstr</b> attribute if there is an error.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       new HOSTNAME [ USER ] | HASHREF
           This  is  the constructor for a new Net::SCP object.  You must specify a hostname, and may optionally
           provide a user.  Alternatively, you may pass a hashref of named params, with the following keys:

               host - hostname
               user - username
               interactive - bool
               cwd - current working directory on remote server

       login [USER]
           Compatibility method.  Optionally sets the user.

       cwd CWD
           Sets the cwd (used for a subsequent get or put request without a full pathname).

       get REMOTE_FILE [, LOCAL_FILE]
           Uses scp to transfer REMOTE_FILE from the remote host.  If a local  filename  is  omitted,  uses  the
           basename of the remote file.

       mkdir DIRECTORY
           Makes a directory on the remote server.  Returns false and sets the <b>errstr</b> attribute on errors.

           (Implementation  note:  An ssh connection is established to the remote machine and '<a href="file:/bin/mkdir">/bin/mkdir</a> <b>-p</b>' is
           used to create the directory.)

       size FILE
           Returns the size in bytes for the given file as stored on the remote server.  Returns 0 on error, and
           sets the <b>errstr</b> attribute.  In the case of an actual zero-length  file  on  the  remote  server,  the
           special value '0e0' is returned, which evaluates to zero when used as a number, but is true.

           (Implementation  note:  An  ssh  connection  is  established  to the remote machine and wc is used to
           determine the file size.)

       put LOCAL_FILE [, REMOTE_FILE]
           Uses scp to trasnfer LOCAL_FILE to the remote host.  If  a  remote  filename  is  omitted,  uses  the
           basename of the local file.

       binary
           Compatibility method: does nothing; returns true.

       quit
           Compatibility method: does nothing; returns true.

</pre><h4><b>FREQUENTLY</b> <b>ASKED</b> <b>QUESTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Q: How do you supply a password to connect with ssh within a perl script using the Net::SSH module?

       A: You don't (at least not with this module).  Use RSA or DSA keys.  See the
          quick help in the next section and the <u><a href="../man1/ssh-keygen.1.html">ssh-keygen</a></u>(1) manpage.

       A #2: See Net::SCP::Expect instead.

       Q: My script is "leaking" scp processes.

       A:  See  "How  do  I avoid zombies on a Unix system" in perlfaq8, IPC::Open2, IPC::Open3 and "waitpid" in
       perlfunc.

</pre><h4><b>GENERATING</b> <b>AND</b> <b>USING</b> <b>SSH</b> <b>KEYS</b></h4><pre>
       1 Generate keys
           Type:

              ssh-keygen -t rsa

           And do not enter a passphrase unless you wanted to be prompted for one during file copying.

           Here is what you will see:

              $ ssh-keygen -t rsa
              Generating public/private rsa key pair.
              Enter file in which to save the key (/home/User/.ssh/id_rsa):
              Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):

              Enter same passphrase again:

              Your identification has been saved in /home/User/.ssh/id_rsa.
              Your public key has been saved in /home/User/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
              The key fingerprint is:
              5a:cd:2b:0a:cd:d9:15:85:26:79:40:0c:55:2a:f4:23 User@JEFF-CPU

       2 Copy public to machines you want to upload to
           "id_rsa.pub" is your public key. Copy it to "<a href="file:~/.ssh">~/.ssh</a>" on target machine.

           Put a copy of  the  public  key  file  on  each  machine  you  want  to  log  into.   Name  the  copy
           "authorized_keys" (some implementations name this file "authorized_keys2")

           Then type:

                chmod 600 authorized_keys

           Then make sure your home dir on the remote machine is not group or world writeable.

</pre><h4><b>AUTHORS</b></h4><pre>
       Could really use a maintainer with enough time to at least review and apply patches more patches.  Or the
       module  should  just  be  deprecated  in favor of Net::SFTP::Expect or Net::SFTP::Foreign and made into a
       simple compatibility wrapper.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Still has no-OO cruft.

       In  order  to  work around some problems with commercial SSH2, if the source file is on the local system,
       and  is  not  a  directory,  the  <b>-r</b>  flag  is  omitted.   It's  probably  better  just  to  use  OpenSSH
       &lt;<a href="http://www.openssh.com/">http://www.openssh.com/</a>&gt; which is the de-facto standard these days anyway.

       The Net::FTP-style OO stuff is kinda lame.  And incomplete.

       iscp  doesn't  expect  you to be logging into the box that you are copying to for the first time. so it's
       completely clueless about how to handle  the whole 'add this file to known  hosts'  message  so  it  just
       hangs after the user hits y.  (Thanks to John L. Utz III).  To avoid this, SSH to the box once first.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       For a perl implementation that does not require the system <b>scp</b> command, see Net::SFTP instead.

       For a wrapper version that allows you to use passwords, see Net::SCP::Expect instead.

       For a wrapper version of the newer SFTP protocol, see Net::SFTP::Foreign instead.
