</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Net::SIP::Dispatcher - dispatch SIP packets between legs and endpoint

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         my $disp = Net::SIP::Dispatcher-&gt;new( ... );
         $disp-&gt;deliver( $request );

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module dispatches Net::SIP::Packets between Net::SIP::Legs and endpoints like Net::SIP::Endpoint,
       Net::SIP::Registrar and Net::SIP::StatelessProxy.

       It manages retransmission of outgoing packets and redelivery of responses to incoming requests.

       It is asssociated with an event handling like Net::SIP::Dispatcher::Eventloop.

</pre><h4><b>CONSTRUCTOR</b></h4><pre>
       new ( \@LEGS, EVENTLOOP, %ARGS )
           Creates a new dispatcher object.

           @LEGS is a list of legs or specification for legs. See <b>add_leg</b> for possible formats.

           EVENTLOOP  is  a  eventloop  which provides handling of events on file descriptors and timers. If not
           given a new Net::SIP::Dispatcher::Eventloop object will be created and used. See there how to  define
           your own event loop package.

           %ARGS are parameters for the behavior of the dispatcher:

           outgoing_proxy
                   Specifies  "ip:port"  of  outgoing  proxy,  e.g the proxy which will be used for all outgoing
                   packets. A leg to reach this proxy need to exist.

           do_retransmits
                   If TRUE retransmits will be done according to RFC3261. If FALSE no retransmits will be  done,
                   which is used in the case of stateless proxies.  Defaults to TRUE.

                   This is the default for the delivery and can be overwritten in sub <b>deliver</b>.

           domain2proxy
                   Optional  mapping  between  target SIP domain and proxy to use.  This is usually a hash of "(
                   domain, "ip_proxy:port_proxy" )" pairs. Special domain '*' can be used to specify a  fallback
                   and  '*.domain'  to  include not only the domain but the subdomains too.  See sub <b>deliver</b> for
                   more details.

           dnsresolv
                   Optional function to be used for DNS resolving instead of  Net::DNS.  This  is  intended  for
                   testing   or   for  interfacing  with  own  resolver  code.   The  function  is  called  with
                   "(type,name,callback)" and is expected to invoke the callback with the answer. "type" can  be
                   SRV,   A   or   AAAA   and   the   answer   is   expected   to   be   a  list  consisting  of
                   "['SRV',prio,host,port]", "['A',ip,host]" and "['AAAA',ip,host]".

           The constructor will create a timer using the eventloop  which  will  regularly  (each  second)  call
           <b>queue_expire</b>.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       set_receiver ( ENDPOINT )
           This  sets  ENDPOINT as a receiver for incoming packets.  ENDPOINT is an object with a method <b>receive</b>
           or a callback usable by <b>invoke_callback</b> in Net::SIP::Util.

       add_leg ( LEG )
           Adds LEG as a leg to the dispatcher $self. LEG can be either a Net::SIP::Leg object, a IO::Handle  or
           a hash reference which is usable in the constructor of Net::SIP::Leg.

           The leg will be added to the dispatchers eventloop for receiving incoming packets.

       remove_leg ( LEG )
           Removes Net::SIP::Leg object LEG from the dispatcher.

       get_legs ( %ARGS )
           Get  a  list  of  all  Net::SIP::Leg  objects  matching  the  criteria given by %ARGS. %ARGS can be a
           combination of:

           addr    Matches if given address matches the legs source address.

           port    Matches if given port matches the legs source port.

           proto   Matches if given proto ('udp','tcp') matches the legs protocol.

           sub     Call given sub with the Net::SIP::Leg as argument. Matches if the sub returns TRUE.

           The leg matches %ARGS if the all conditions specified in %ARGS match.

       add_timer ( WHEN, CALLBACK, [ REPEAT ] )
           Adds a timer using the eventloop.

           WHEN is either an absolute or a relative time (what it is will be  decided  based  on  the  value  of
           WHEN).  Absolute  times  will be specified in time_t (seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00) and relative
           time will be specified in seconds.  WHEN can be floating point to specify subseconds.  WHEN can be  0
           to trigger the timer immediately.

           CALLBACK is a callback usable by <b>invoke_callback</b> in Net::SIP::Util.

           REPEAT is the optional repeat interval for the timer.

       deliver ( PACKET, %ARGS )
           Delivers <b>Net::SIP::Packet</b> PACKET.  %ARGS can specify hints for delivery:

           id      ID  for  packet,  used in <b>cancel_delivery</b>. If not given the transaction ID of PACKET given by
                   method <b>tid</b> will be used.

           callid  Call-ID for packet, used in <b>cancel_delivery</b> to cancel all deliveries for a specific call.  If
                   not given the Call-Id of PACKET given by method <b>callid</b> will be used.

           callback
                   callback  which  will  be called on definite delivery of packet (only possible for TCP) or on
                   definite failure. Callback will be invoked using <b>invoke_callback</b> from <b>Net::SIP::Util</b> with the
                   additional argument of $!.  See sub <b>deliver</b> in Net::SIP::Leg.

           leg     Specifies outgoing Net::SIP::Leg object. For responses created by the endpoint  the  outgoing
                   leg is usually known, because it's the same as the incoming leg for the request.

           dst_addr
                   Destination,  i.e. where to deliver the packet.  This should be given as a hash with the keys
                   "proto" (udp|tcp|tls), "host", "addr", "port" and "family".  This is necessary for responses,
                   for requests it can be found out based on the requests URI.

           do_retransmits
                   Specifies if retransmits should be done according to  RFC3261.  This  is  usually  the  case,
                   except  for  stateless  proxies.  Overwrites the global parameter with the same name from the
                   constructor for the delivery of the specific packet.

           Delivery of the packet itself will be handled in multiple steps (in  the  code  done  mainly  by  sub
           <b>__deliver</b>:

           •       If  a  leg  is specified it will be used for delivery. <b>dst_addr</b> needs to be specified in this
                   case too.  This is usually the case for locally generated responses.

           •       Otherwise leg and dst_addr will be retrieved using <b>resolve_uri</b>.  See there.

           If the packets could be retransmitted appropriate setups will be done. Retransmission  will  be  done
           until final failure or until <b>cancel_delivery</b> will be called for the packet, which usually means, that
           the packet was successfully delivered because a response to the packet was received.

       resolve_uri ( URI, ADDR, LEGS, CALLBACK, [ ALLOWED_PROTO, ALLOWED_LEGS ] )
           Resolves  URI  to  get the destination address and the outgoing leg.  ADDR and LEGS are references to
           lists which will get filled with the computed values.

           If ALLOWED_PROTO is given it will be interpreted as a \@list of protocols.  Only the protocols  given
           in  the  list  will  be  considered  and  the  it  will  try  them  in  the order from the list, e.g.
           "('tcp','udp')" means that tcp is tried first and only if there is no way to do tcp it will try  udp.
           Default is to first try udp and then tcp.

           If  ALLOWED_LEGS  is given it will be interpreted as a \@list of Net::SIP::Leg objects and only these
           legs are allowed.

           Because the method can be asynchronous (DNS lookups can be involved) it will call CALLBACK once it is
           done. If no errors occurred CALLBACK will be invoked without additional arguments, otherwise with the
           errno as additional argument.

           Resolving will be done as follows:

           •       If <b>domain2proxy</b> is given it will try to get the dst_addr from this, e.g. the address  of  the
                   proxy responsable for the domain (if any). From dst_addr it will then get the leg.

           •       If still no dst_addr is known it will use <b>outgoing_proxy</b> as the dst_addr.

           •       If  still  no  dst_addr  is  known  but  the SIP domain is an IP address this will be used as
                   dst_addr.

           •       The last effort will be made  by  looking  up  the  SIP  domain  using  DNS  with  a  partial
                   implementation of RFC3263, e.g. it looks at the DNS SRV records but not at NAPTR records.

           •       For  each destination address (e.g. proto,addr,port) the outgoing leg will be computed.  This
                   will be done in sub <b>__find_leg4addr</b> by going through all legs and checking, if the leg  could
                   deliver to this address by calling <b>can_deliver_to</b> on the leg (see Net::SIP::Leg).

       cancel_delivery ( TYP?,ID )
           Cancels  retransmission  of  packet  with  id ID. Called from endpoint if response to packet came in,
           which means that the packet was successfully delivered.

           If TYP given packets can be canceled by something else. TYP  can  be  "callid",  in  which  case  all
           deliveries  for a specific call will be canceled. It can be "id" which will cancel the packet with id
           ID.  Or it can be "qentry" in which case ID will be interpreted as  the  Net::SIP::Dispatcher::Packet
           object in the queue and it will cancel this packet.

           Will return true if the item was canceled, false if no such item was found in delivery queue.

       receive ( PACKET, LEG, FROM )
           Called   from   the  eventloop  (e.g  was  setup  as  a  callback)  for  incoming  packets.  The  new
           Net::SIP::Packet is PACKET, LEG is the Net::SIP::Leg where the packet came in and FROM  is  "ip:port"
           of the sender.

       queue_expire ( [ NOW ] )
           Expires retransmission queue, e.g. deletes packet where retransmissions failed permanently (and calls
           appropriate  callbacks)  and  initiates  pending  retransmissions.  Called  from a timer setup in the
           constructor.
