       Net::POP3 - Post Office Protocol 3 Client class (RFC1939)

           use Net::POP3;

           # Constructors
           $pop = Net::POP3-&gt;new('pop3host');
           $pop = Net::POP3-&gt;new('pop3host', Timeout =&gt; 60);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module implements a client interface to the POP3 protocol, enabling a perl5 application to talk to
       POP3 servers. This documentation assumes that you are familiar with the POP3 protocol described in
       RFC1939.  With IO::Socket::SSL installed it also provides support for implicit and explicit TLS
       encryption, i.e. POP3S or POP3+STARTTLS.

       A new Net::POP3 object must be created with the <u>new</u> method. Once this has been done, all POP3 commands
       are accessed via method calls on the object.

       The Net::POP3 class is a subclass of Net::Cmd and (depending on avaibility) of IO::Socket::IP,
       IO::Socket::INET6 or IO::Socket::INET.

   <b>Class</b> <b>Methods</b>
       "new([$host][, %options])"
           This  is the constructor for a new Net::POP3 object. $host is the name of the remote host to which an
           POP3 connection is required.

           $host is optional. If $host is not given then it may instead be passed as the "Host" option described
           below. If neither is given then the "POP3_Hosts" specified in "Net::Config" will be used.

           %options are passed in a hash like fashion, using key and value pairs.  Possible options are:

           <b>Host</b> - POP3 host to connect to. It may be a single scalar, as defined for the  "PeerAddr"  option  in
           IO::Socket::INET, or a reference to an array with hosts to try in turn. The "host" method will return
           the value which was used to connect to the host.

           <b>Port</b> - port to connect to.  Default - 110 for plain POP3 and 995 for POP3s (direct SSL).

           <b>SSL</b>  -  If  the  connection  should  be  done  from  start  with  SSL, contrary to later upgrade with
           "starttls".  You can use SSL arguments as documented in IO::Socket::SSL, but it will usually use  the
           right arguments already.

           <b>LocalAddr</b>  and  <b>LocalPort</b>  -  These parameters are passed directly to IO::Socket to allow binding the
           socket to a specific local address and port.  For compatibility with older versions <b>ResvPort</b>  can  be
           used instead of <b>LocalPort</b>.

           <b>Domain</b>  -  This  parameter  is  passed  directly  to IO::Socket and makes it possible to enforce IPv4
           connections even if IO::Socket::IP is used as super class. Alternatively <b>Family</b> can be used.

           <b>Timeout</b> - Maximum time, in seconds, to wait for a response from the POP3 server (default: 120)

           <b>Debug</b> - Enable debugging information

   <b>Object</b> <b>Methods</b>
       Unless otherwise stated all methods return either a <u>true</u> or <u>false</u>  value,  with  <u>true</u>  meaning  that  the
       operation  was a success. When a method states that it returns a value, failure will be returned as <u>undef</u>
       or an empty list.

       "Net::POP3" inherits from "Net::Cmd" so methods defined in "Net::Cmd" may be used to send commands to the
       remote POP3 server in addition to the methods documented here.

       host()
           Returns the value used by the constructor, and passed to IO::Socket::INET, to connect to the host.

       "auth($username, $password)"
           Attempt SASL authentication.

       user($user)
           Send the USER command.

       pass($pass)
           Send the PASS command. Returns the number of messages in the mailbox.

       "login([$user[, $pass]])"
           Send both the USER and PASS commands. If $pass is not given  the  "Net::POP3"  uses  "Net::Netrc"  to
           lookup  the  password  using the host and username. If the username is not specified then the current
           user name will be used.

           Returns the number of messages in the mailbox. However if there are no messages  on  the  server  the
           string  "0E0"  will  be  returned. This is will give a true value in a boolean context, but zero in a
           numeric context.

           If there was an error authenticating the user then <u>undef</u> will be returned.

       starttls(%sslargs)
           Upgrade  existing  plain  connection  to  SSL.   You  can  use  SSL  arguments   as   documented   in
           IO::Socket::SSL, but it will usually use the right arguments already.

       "apop([$user[, $pass]])"
           Authenticate  with  the server identifying as $user with password $pass.  Similar to "login", but the
           password is not sent in clear text.

           To use this method you must have the Digest::MD5 or the MD5 module installed, otherwise  this  method
           will return <u>undef</u>.

       banner()
           Return the sever's connection banner

       capa()
           Return  a  reference  to  a  hash  of  the  capabilities  of  the  server.  APOP is added as a pseudo
           capability.  Note that I've been unable to find a list of the standard capability  values,  and  some
           appear  to  be multi-word and some are not.  We make an attempt at intelligently parsing them, but it
           may not be correct.

       capabilities()
           Just like capa, but only uses a cache from the last time we asked the server, so as to  avoid  asking
           more than once.

       "top($msgnum[, $numlines])"
           Get the header and the first $numlines of the body for the message $msgnum. Returns a reference to an
           array which contains the lines of text read from the server.

       list([$msgnum])
           If called with an argument the "list" returns the size of the message in octets.

           If  called without arguments a reference to a hash is returned. The keys will be the $msgnum's of all
           undeleted messages and the values will be their size in octets.

       "get($msgnum[, $fh])"
           Get the message $msgnum from the remote mailbox. If $fh is not given then get returns a reference  to
           an  array  which  contains  the  lines  of  text read from the server. If $fh is given then the lines
           returned from the server are printed to the filehandle $fh.

       getfh($msgnum)
           As per <b>get()</b>, but returns a tied filehandle.  Reading from  this  filehandle  returns  the  requested
           message.  The filehandle will return EOF at the end of the message and should not be reused.

       last()
           Returns the highest $msgnum of all the messages accessed.

       popstat()
           Returns  a  list of two elements. These are the number of undeleted elements and the size of the mbox
           in octets.

       ping($user)
           Returns a list of two elements. These are the number of new messages and the total number of messages
           for $user.

       uidl([$msgnum])
           Returns a unique identifier for $msgnum if given. If $msgnum is not given "uidl" returns a  reference
           to a hash where the keys are the message numbers and the values are the unique identifiers.

       delete($msgnum)
           Mark  message  $msgnum  to  be  deleted  from  the remote mailbox. All messages that are marked to be
           deleted will be removed from the remote mailbox when the server connection closed.

       reset()
           Reset the status of the remote POP3 server. This includes resetting the status of all messages to not
           be deleted.

       quit()
           Quit and close the connection to the remote POP3 server. Any  messages  marked  as  deleted  will  be
           deleted from the remote mailbox.

       can_inet6()
           Returns whether we can use IPv6.

       can_ssl()
           Returns whether we can use SSL.

   <b>Notes</b>
       If  a  "Net::POP3"  object  goes out of scope before "quit" method is called then the "reset" method will
       called before the connection is closed. This means that any messages marked to be deleted will not be.
