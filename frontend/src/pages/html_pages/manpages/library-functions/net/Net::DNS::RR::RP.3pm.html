</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Net::DNS::RR::RP - DNS RP resource record

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
               use Net::DNS;
               $rr = Net::DNS::RR-&gt;new('name RP mbox txtdname');

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Class for DNS Responsible Person (RP) resource records.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       The available methods are those inherited from the base class augmented by the type-specific methods
       defined in this package.

       Use of undocumented package features or direct access to internal data structures is discouraged and
       could result in program termination or other unpredictable behaviour.

   <b>mbox</b>
               $mbox = $rr-&gt;mbox;
               $rr-&gt;mbox( $mbox );

       A domain name which specifies the mailbox for the person responsible for this domain. The format in
       master files uses the DNS encoding convention for mailboxes, identical to that used for the RNAME mailbox
       field in the SOA RR. The root domain name (just ".") may be specified to indicate that no mailbox is
       available.

   <b>txtdname</b>
               $txtdname = $rr-&gt;txtdname;
               $rr-&gt;txtdname( $txtdname );

       A domain name identifying TXT RRs. A subsequent query can be performed to retrieve the associated TXT
       records. This provides a level of indirection so that the entity can be referred to from multiple places
       in the DNS. The root domain name (just ".") may be specified to indicate that there is no associated TXT
       RR.
