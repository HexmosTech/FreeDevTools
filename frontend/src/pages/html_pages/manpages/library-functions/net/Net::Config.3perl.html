</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Net::Config - Local configuration data for libnet

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Net::Config qw(%NetConfig);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       "Net::Config" holds configuration data for the modules in the libnet distribution. During installation
       you will be asked for these values.

       The configuration data is held globally in "<a href="file:/etc/perl/Net/libnet.cfg">/etc/perl/Net/libnet.cfg</a>", but a user may override any of
       these values by providing their own. This can be done by having a ".libnetrc" file in their home
       directory. This file should return a reference to a HASH containing the keys described below.  For
       example

           # .libnetrc
           {
               nntp_hosts =&gt; [ "my_preferred_host" ],
               ph_hosts   =&gt; [ "my_ph_server" ],
           }
           __END__

   <b>Class</b> <b>Methods</b>
       "Net::Config" defines the following methods. They are methods as they are invoked as class methods. This
       is because "Net::Config" inherits from "Net::LocalCfg" so you can override these methods if you want.

       requires_firewall($host)
           Attempts to determine if a given host is outside your firewall. Possible return values are.

             -1  Cannot lookup hostname
              0  Host is inside firewall (or there is no ftp_firewall entry)
              1  Host is outside the firewall

           This is done by using hostname lookup and the "local_netmask" entry in the configuration data.

   <b>NetConfig</b> <b>Values</b>
       nntp_hosts
       snpp_hosts
       pop3_hosts
       smtp_hosts
       ph_hosts
       daytime_hosts
       time_hosts
           Each  is  a reference to an array of hostnames (in order of preference), which should be used for the
           given protocol

       inet_domain
           Your internet domain name

       ftp_firewall
           If you have an FTP proxy firewall (<b>NOT</b> an HTTP or SOCKS firewall) then this value should  be  set  to
           the  firewall hostname. If your firewall does not listen to port 21, then this value should be set to
           "hostname:port" (eg "hostname:99")

       ftp_firewall_type
           There are many different ftp firewall products available. But unfortunately there is no standard  for
           how to traverse a firewall.  The list below shows the sequence of commands that Net::FTP will use

             user        Username for remote host
             pass        Password for remote host
             fwuser      Username for firewall
             fwpass      Password for firewall
             remote.host The hostname of the remote ftp server

           0   There is no firewall

           1
                    USER <a href="mailto:user@remote.host">user@remote.host</a>
                    PASS pass

           2
                    USER fwuser
                    PASS fwpass
                    USER <a href="mailto:user@remote.host">user@remote.host</a>
                    PASS pass

           3
                    USER fwuser
                    PASS fwpass
                    SITE remote.site
                    USER user
                    PASS pass

           4
                    USER fwuser
                    PASS fwpass
                    OPEN remote.site
                    USER user
                    PASS pass

           5
                    USER user@<a href="mailto:fwuser@remote.site">fwuser@remote.site</a>
                    PASS pass@fwpass

           6
                    USER <a href="mailto:fwuser@remote.site">fwuser@remote.site</a>
                    PASS fwpass
                    USER user
                    PASS pass

           7
                    USER <a href="mailto:user@remote.host">user@remote.host</a>
                    PASS pass
                    AUTH fwuser
                    RESP fwpass

       ftp_ext_passive
       ftp_int_passive
           FTP  servers  can  work  in passive or active mode. Active mode is when you want to transfer data you
           have to tell the server the address and port to connect to.  Passive mode is when the server  provide
           the address and port and you establish the connection.

           With  some  firewalls active mode does not work as the server cannot connect to your machine (because
           you are behind a firewall) and the firewall does not re-write the command. In this  case  you  should
           set "ftp_ext_passive" to a <u>true</u> value.

           Some  servers  are  configured  to  only work in passive mode. If you have one of these you can force
           "Net::FTP" to  always  transfer  in  passive  mode;  when  not  going  via  a  firewall,  by  setting
           "ftp_int_passive" to a <u>true</u> value.

       local_netmask
           A  reference  to  a  list  of  netmask  strings  in  the form "134.99.4.0/24".  These are used by the
           "requires_firewall" function to determine if a given host is inside or outside your firewall.

       The following entries are used during installation &amp; testing on the libnet package

       test_hosts
           If true then "make test" may attempt to connect to hosts given in the configuration.

       test_exists
           If true then "Configure" will check each hostname given that it exists
