</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Net::SIP::Debug - debugging of Net::SIP

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Net::SIP::Debug '1';
         use Net::SIP::Debug qw( Net::SIP*=0 Registrar=1 );
         Net::SIP::Debug-&gt;<a href="../man1/level.1.html">level</a>(1);

         perl -MNet::SIP::Debug=1 app.pl

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Provides debugging support for Net::SIP.  Debugging can be enabled/disabled globally or per package and
       optional per subpackage.

       It provides support for different debugging levels, e.g.  the higher the level, the more debugging is
       done.  The following levels are used:

       •   1 - Debug messages for users.

       •   2 - Includes short SIP packet dumps of incoming and outgoing data.

       •   5 - Includes detailed SIP packet dumps for incoming and outgoing data.

       •   10 - Includes information about call flow, e.g. why packets get dropped etc.

       •   50 - Detailed debugging for programmers using Net::SIP.

       •   100 - Detailed debugging for core developers of Net::SIP.

</pre><h4><b>CLASS</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       import ( @ARGS )
           Extracts everything from arguments given to "use" which might be usable by <b>level</b> and forwards rest to
           Exporter.

           If  the argument is a reference to a subroutine it will be used for showing the debug message instead
           of printing it to STDERR.  In this case the usual prefixes incl the time will not  be  added  (useful
           for forwarding debug to syslog).

       level ( @ARGS )
           Enables/disables debugging depending on @ARGS. @ARGS might contain the following specifications:

           NUMBER  NUMBER  will  be  interpreted  as  the debugging level.  It's used in <b>debug</b> etc to print only
                   debug message which a level lower or equal to NUMBER.

           PACKAGE Enables debugging for package PACKAGE. PACKAGE might  be  a  fully  qualified  package  (e.g.
                   "Net::SIP::Registrar") or the "Net" or "Net::SIP" might be omitted ("Registrar"). If a "*" is
                   added  the  debugging  will  also  be  enabled for subpackages, e.g.  "Endpoint*" will enable
                   debugging for Net::SIP::Endpoint and Net::SIP::Endpoint::Context too.

           PACKAGE=NUMBER
                   Similar to the previous item, but this sets debugging  level  to  NUMBER  for  the  specified
                   packages and thus can also be used to selectively disable debugging for some packages.

           If  @ARGS  is  empty it will return the debugging level for the package which called this method (the
           first package in the caller stack which is not Net::SIP::Debug itself).

       set_prefix ( PREFIX )
           Sets prefix used for debug messages to PREFIX. Default  prefix  is  'DEBUG:'  but  for  instance  for
           forking applications it might be useful to change this to "DEBUG($$):" or similar.

</pre><h4><b>SUBROUTINES</b></h4><pre>
       DEBUG|debug ( [ LEVEL ],( MESSAGE | FMT,@ARG ))
           If  debugging  is enabled it will print debugging info to STDERR.  If multiple arguments are given to
           the function they will be fed into <b>sprintf</b> to create a single message.

           If the first argument looks like  a  number  (see  <b>looks_like_number</b>  in  Scalar::Util)  it  will  be
           interpreted  as  the debug level for this message, e.g. if it is higher than the user specified debug
           level the message will not be printed.

           The MESSAGE (or the result from "sprintf(FMT,@ARG)") will be prefixed  by  the  caller  package,  the
           caller function and the line from which DEBUG was called. In front of the prefix the current time (as
           float time_t) and the string "DEBUG:" will be added.

           If  the  message  consists of multiple lines each line will be prefixed by the prefix and all but the
           first line will also have a TAB added between prefix and message data.

           The function is by default exported as <b>DEBUG</b> and can by exported as <b>debug</b> too.

       DEBUG_DUMP ( [ LEVEL ], @DATA )
           Will call <b>debug</b> with the output from Data::Dumpers <b>Dumper</b> if debugging is enabled. If @DATA has  more
           than  one item it will be fed as reference into <b>Dumper</b>, otherwise only the single item will be fed to
           <b>Dumper</b>.  For the meaning of LEVEL see <b>debug</b>.

           This function is exported by default.

       stacktrace ( MESSAGE | FMT,@ARG )
           Uses the arguments in <b>debug</b>, but instead of writing a debug message to STDERR  it  will  be  used  in
           Carp::longmess.  Returns string with stacktrace.

       LEAK_TRACK ( REF )
           This  is  used internally for tracking leaks. It will rebless REF into a new class which behaves like
           the old one. Calls of LEAK_TRACK and DESTROY on this class will be tracked and shown. If  Devel::Peek
           can be loaded it will <b>Dump</b> information about the REF on each call to LEAK_TRACK.

           Exported by default.

</pre><h4><b>exported</b> <b>Variables</b></h4><pre>
       $DEBUG
           This  variable  is  set  to false if all kind of debugging is disabled.  This variable is exported by
           default. It should not be changed.  It is intended to be used as a  quick  check  to  save  expensive
           calls of debugging functions if no debugging will be used anyway, i.e.:

               $DEBUG &amp;&amp; DEBUG(...)
