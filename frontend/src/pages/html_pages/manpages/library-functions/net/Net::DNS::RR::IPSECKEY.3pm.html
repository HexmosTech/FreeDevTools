</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Net::DNS::RR::IPSECKEY - DNS IPSECKEY resource record

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
               use Net::DNS;
               $rr = Net::DNS::RR-&gt;new('name IPSECKEY precedence gatetype algorithm gateway key');

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       DNS IPSEC Key Storage (IPSECKEY) resource records.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       The available methods are those inherited from the base class augmented by the type-specific methods
       defined in this package.

       Use of undocumented package features or direct access to internal data structures is discouraged and
       could result in program termination or other unpredictable behaviour.

   <b>precedence</b>
               $precedence = $rr-&gt;precedence;
               $rr-&gt;precedence( $precedence );

       This is an 8-bit precedence for this record.  Gateways listed in IPSECKEY records with lower precedence
       are to be attempted first.

   <b>gatetype</b>
               $gatetype = $rr-&gt;gatetype;

       The gateway type field indicates the format of the information that is stored in the gateway field.

   <b>algorithm</b>
               $algorithm = $rr-&gt;algorithm;
               $rr-&gt;algorithm( $algorithm );

       The algorithm type field identifies the public keys cryptographic algorithm and determines the format of
       the public key field.

   <b>gateway</b>
               $gateway = $rr-&gt;gateway;
               $rr-&gt;gateway( $gateway );

       The gateway field indicates a gateway to which an IPsec tunnel may be created in order to reach the
       entity named by this resource record.

   <b>pubkey</b>
   <b>key</b>
               $key = $rr-&gt;key;
               $rr-&gt;key( $key );

       Base64 representation of the optional public key block for the resource record.

   <b>keybin</b>
               $keybin = $rr-&gt;keybin;
               $rr-&gt;keybin( $keybin );

       Binary representation of the public key block for the resource record.
