</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Net::Cmd - Network Command class (as used by FTP, SMTP etc)

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Net::Cmd;

           @ISA = qw(Net::Cmd);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       "Net::Cmd" is a collection of methods that can be inherited by a sub-class of "IO::Socket::INET". These
       methods implement the functionality required for a command based protocol, for example FTP and SMTP.

       If your sub-class does not also derive from "IO::Socket::INET" or similar (e.g.  "IO::Socket::IP",
       "IO::Socket::INET6" or "IO::Socket::SSL") then you must provide the following methods by other means
       yourself: close() and timeout().

   <b>Public</b> <b>Methods</b>
       These methods provide a user interface to the "Net::Cmd" object.

       debug($level)
           Set  the level of debug information for this object. If $level is not given then the current state is
           returned. Otherwise the state is changed to $level and the previous state returned.

           Different packages may implement different levels of debug but a non-zero value results in copies  of
           all commands and responses also being sent to STDERR.

           If $level is "undef" then the debug level will be set to the default debug level for the class.

           This  method  can  also  be  called as a <u>static</u> method to set/get the default debug level for a given
           class.

       message()
           Returns the text message returned from the last command. In a scalar  context  it  returns  a  single
           string,  in  a  list  context it will return each line as a separate element. (See "PSEUDO RESPONSES"
           below.)

       code()
           Returns the 3-digit code from the last command. If a command is pending then the value 0 is returned.
           (See "PSEUDO RESPONSES" below.)

       ok()
           Returns non-zero if the last code value was greater than zero and less than 400. This holds true  for
           most command servers. Servers where this does not hold may override this method.

       status()
           Returns  the  most  significant  digit  of  the  current  status  code.  If a command is pending then
           "CMD_PENDING" is returned.

       datasend($data)
           Send data to the remote server, converting LF to CRLF. Any line starting with a '.' will be  prefixed
           with  another  '.'.   $data  may be an array or a reference to an array.  The $data passed in must be
           encoded by the caller to octets of whatever encoding is required, e.g. by using the  Encode  module's
           encode() function.

       dataend()
           End  the  sending  of  data to the remote server. This is done by ensuring that the data already sent
           ends with CRLF then sending '.CRLF' to end the transmission. Once this data has been  sent  "dataend"
           calls "response" and returns true if "response" returns CMD_OK.

   <b>Protected</b> <b>Methods</b>
       These  methods  are  not  intended  to  be  called by the user, but used or over-ridden by a sub-class of
       "Net::Cmd"

       "debug_print($dir, $text)"
           Print debugging information. $dir denotes the direction <u>true</u> being data being  sent  to  the  server.
           Calls "debug_text" before printing to STDERR.

       "debug_text($dir, $text)"
           This method is called to print debugging information. $text is the text being sent. The method should
           return the text to be printed.

           This  is  primarily  meant for the use of modules such as FTP where passwords are sent, but we do not
           want to display them in the debugging information.

       "command($cmd[, $args, ... ])"
           Send a command to the command server. All arguments are first joined with a space character and  CRLF
           is appended, this string is then sent to the command server.

           Returns undef upon failure.

       unsupported()
           Sets the status code to 580 and the response text to 'Unsupported command'.  Returns zero.

       response()
           Obtain  a  response  from  the  server. Upon success the most significant digit of the status code is
           returned. Upon failure, timeout etc., <u>CMD_ERROR</u> is returned.

       parse_response($text)
           This method is called by "response" as a method with one argument. It should return  an  array  of  2
           values,  the  3-digit status code and a flag which is true when this is part of a multi-line response
           and this line is not the last.

       getline()
           Retrieve one line, delimited by CRLF, from the remote server. Returns <u>undef</u> upon failure.

           <b>NOTE</b>: If you do use this method for any reason, please remember to add some "debug_print" calls  into
           your method.

       ungetline($text)
           Unget a line of text from the server.

       rawdatasend($data)
           Send  data  to  the  remote  server  without  performing any conversions. $data is a scalar.  As with
           datasend(), the $data passed in must be encoded by the caller  to  octets  of  whatever  encoding  is
           required, e.g. by using the Encode module's encode() function.

       read_until_dot()
           Read  data  from  the remote server until a line consisting of a single '.'.  Any lines starting with
           '..' will have one of the '.'s removed.

           Returns a reference to a list containing the lines, or <u>undef</u> upon failure.

       tied_fh()
           Returns a filehandle tied to the Net::Cmd object.  After issuing a command, you may  read  from  this
           filehandle  using  <b>read()</b>  or  &lt;&gt;.  The filehandle will return EOF when the final dot is encountered.
           Similarly, you may write to the filehandle in order to send  data  to  the  server  after  issuing  a
           command that expects data to be written.

           See the Net::POP3 and Net::SMTP modules for examples of this.

   <b>Pseudo</b> <b>Responses</b>
       Normally  the  values  returned by message() and code() are obtained from the remote server, but in a few
       circumstances, as detailed below, "Net::Cmd" will return values that it sets. You can alter this behavior
       by overriding <b>DEF_REPLY_CODE()</b> to specify a different default  reply  code,  or  overriding  one  of  the
       specific error handling methods below.

       Initial value
           Before  any command has executed or if an unexpected error occurs code() will return "421" (temporary
           connection failure) and message() will return undef.

       Connection closed
           If the underlying "IO::Handle" is closed, or if there are any read or write failures, the file handle
           will be forced closed, and code() will return "421" (temporary connection failure) and message() will
           return "[$pkg] Connection closed" (where $pkg is the name of the class that  subclassed  "Net::Cmd").
           The   <b>_set_status_closed()</b>  method  can  be  overridden  to  set  a  different  message  (by  calling
           <b>set_status()</b>) or otherwise trap this error.

       Timeout
           If there is a read or write timeout code() will  return  "421"  (temporary  connection  failure)  and
           message()  will  return  "[$pkg]  Timeout"  (where  $pkg  is  the  name  of the class that subclassed
           "Net::Cmd"). The <b>_set_status_timeout()</b> method can be  overridden  to  set  a  different  message  (by
           calling <b>set_status()</b>) or otherwise trap this error.
