</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Net::IMAP::Client::MsgSummary - parse message (+ subparts) summary info

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       This object is created internally in Net::IMAP::Client-&gt;get_summaries.  You shouldn't need to instantiate
       it directly.  You can skip the SYNOPSIS, these notes are intended for developers.

           my $imap = Net::IMAP::Client-&gt;new( ... )
           $imap-&gt;select('INBOX');

           # retrieve FETCH lines
           my ($ok, $lines) = $imap-&gt;_tell_imap(FETCH =&gt; "$msg_id FULL");
           die 'FETCH failed: ' . $imap-&gt;last_error
             unless $ok;

           # build parsed tokens
           my @tokens = map { Net::IMAP::Client::_parse_tokens($_) } @$lines;

           # they look like this:
           [ '*', 'MSGID', 'FETCH',
             [ 'FLAGS', [ '\\Seen', '\\Answered' ],
               'INTERNALDATE', '13-Aug-2008 14:43:50 +0300',
               'RFC822.SIZE', '867',
               'ENVELOPE', [
                  ...
               ]
             ...
           ]

       Basically it's the IMAP response parsed into a Perl structure (array of tokens).  FIXME: this stuff
       should be documented in Net::IMAP::Client.

           # make summaries
           my @summaries = map {
               my $tokens = $_-&gt;[3];
               my %hash = @$tokens;
               Net::IMAP::Client::MsgSummary-&gt;new(\%hash);
           } @tokens;

           my $summary = shift @summaries;

           print $summary-&gt;subject;
           print $summary-&gt;from-&gt;[0];

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This object can represent a message or a message part.  For example, for a message containing attachments
       you will be able to call <b>parts()</b> in order to fetch parsed Net::IMAP::Client::MsgSummary objects for each
       part.  Each part in turn may contain other subparts!  For example, if a part is of type "message/rfc822"
       then its "parts" method will return it's subparts, if any.

       There's a distinction between a message and a message part, although we use the same object to represent
       both.  A message will have additional information, fetched from its ENVELOPE (i.e. "subject", "from",
       "to", "date", etc.).  For a part only, this information will be missing.

       If all this sounds confusing, you might want to use Data::Dumper to inspect the structure of a complex
       message.  See also the documentation of Net::IMAP::Client's get_summaries method for an example.

</pre><h4><b>API</b> <b>REFERENCE</b></h4><pre>
       It contains only accessors that return data as retrieved by the FETCH command.  Parts that may be MIME-
       word encoded are automatically undecoded.

   <b>"new"</b>  <b>#</b> <b>constructor</b>
       Parses/creates a new object from the given FETCH data.

       "type"
           Returns the base MIME type (i.e. 'text')

       "subtype"
           Returns the subtype (i.e. 'plain')

       "parameters"
           Returns any parameters passed in BODY(STRUCTURE).  You shouldn't need this.

       "cid"
           Returns the part's unique identifier (CID).

       "description"
           Returns the part's description (usually <u>undef</u>).

       "transfer_encoding"
           Returns the part's content transfer encoding.  You'll need this in order to decode binary parts.

       "encoded_size"
           Returns  the  size  of the encoded part.  This is actually the size in octets that will be downloaded
           from the IMAP server if you fetch this part only.

       "content_type"
           Shortcut for "$self-"type . '/' .$self-&gt;subtype&gt;.

       "charset"
           Returns the charset declaration for this part.

       "name"
           Returns the name of this part, if found in FETCH response.

       "filename"
           Returns the file name of this part, if found in FETCH response.  If there's no filename it  will  try
           "name".

       "multipart"
           Returns the multipart type (i.e. 'mixed', 'alternative')

       "parts"
           Returns the subparts of this part.

       "part_id"
           Returns  the  "id"  (path)  of this part starting from the toplevel message, i.e. "2.1" (meaning that
           this is the first subpart of the second subpart of the toplevel message).

       "md5"
           Returns a MD5 of this part or <u>undef</u> if not present.

       "disposition"
           Returns the disposition of this part (<u>undef</u> if not present).  It's a hash actually  that  looks  like
           this:

             { inline =&gt; { filename =&gt; 'foobar.png' } }

       "language"
           Returns the language of this part or <u>undef</u> if not present.

       "rfc822_size"
           Returns the size of the full message body.

       "internaldate"
           Returns the INTERNALDATE of this message.

       "flags"
           Returns the flags of this message.

       "uid"
           Returns the UID of this message.

       "seq_id"
           Returns the sequence number of this message, if it has been retrieved!

       "date"
           Returns the date of this message (from the Date header).

       "subject"
           Returns the subject of this message.

       "from", "sender", "reply_to", "to", "cc", "bcc"
           Returns  an array of Net::IMAP::Client::MsgAddress objects containing the respective addresses.  Note
           that sometimes this array can be empty!

       "in_reply_to"
           Returns the ID of the "parent" message (to which this one has been replied).  This is NOT  the  "UID"
           of the message!

       "message_id"
           Returns the ID of this message (from the Message-ID header).

       "get_subpart" ($path)
           Returns  the  subpart of this message identified by $path, which is in form '1.2' etc.  Returns undef
           if no such path was found.

           Here's a possible message structure:

            - Container (multipart/mixed) has no path ID; it's the toplevel
              message.  It contains the following subparts:

              1 multipart/related
                1.1 text/html
                1.2 image/png (embedded in HTML)

              2 message/rfc822 (decoded type is actually multipart/related)
                2.1 text/html
                2.2 image/png (also embedded)

           "get_subpart" called on the container will return the respective Net::IMAP::Client::MsgSummary  part,
           i.e. get_subpart('2.1') will return the text/html part of the attached message.

       "has_attachments"
           Tries  to  determine  if  this message has attachments.  For now this checks if the multipart type is
           'mixed', which isn't really accurate.

       "is_message"
           Returns true if this object represents a message (i.e. has content_type eq  'message/rfc822').   Note
           that  it  won't  return true for the toplevel part, but you <b>know</b> that that part represents a message.
           ;-)

       "message"
           Returns the attached rfc822 message

       "headers"
           Returns (unparsed, as plain text) additional message headers if they were fetched  by  get_summaries.
           You can use MIME::Head to parse them.
