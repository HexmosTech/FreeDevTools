</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Net::SIP::NATHelper::Base - rewrite SDP and transport RTP for NAT

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module helps with doing NAT. It is implicitly used in <b>do_nat</b> from Net::SIP::StatelessProxy.

       It cares about the rewriting the SDP bodies, forwarding RTP data for active sessions and expiring
       sessions.

</pre><h4><b>CONSTRUCTOR</b></h4><pre>
       new ( %ARGS )
           Creates a new object.  %ARGS can be of:

           max_sockets N
                   Restricts the maximum number of sockets allocated inside the object to N.

           max_sockets_in_group N
                   Restricts  the  maximum  number of sockets allocated for a single socket group (e.g. a single
                   call to <b>get_rtp_sockets</b>) to N.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       allocate_sockets ( NAT_BASIC,SIDE,ADDR,MEDIA )
           This is called to allocate new local sockets for MEDIA. MEDIA is a \@list of specifications like  you
           get  from  <b>get_media</b>  in  Net::SIP::SDP.  ADDR  is  the  local  address,  where the sockets should be
           allocated.

           NAT_BASIC  consists of "&lt;[ CALLID, CSEQ, IDFROM, IDTO, URI_FROM, URI_TO ]"&gt;.

           IDFROM and IDTO represent the sides of the session, while SIDE helps  to  pick  the  right  side  for
           allocation, e.g. if SIDE is 0 the sockets will be allocated on the IDFROM side, if it is 1 it will be
           on the IDTO side. Thus for Requests SIDE will be 0, while for responses it will be 1.

           CALLID  and  CSEQ  are  used  to  identify the SIP transaction, for which the NAT will be done, while
           IDSIDE is either IDFROM or IDTO (see below) depending on the side, where the packet came in.

           URI_FROM and URI_TO are primarily for information.

           The methode will return  the \@list of new media in the  format  needed  by  <b>replace_media_listen</b>  in
           Net::SIP::SDP, e.g tuples of "[ip,base_port]".

           If the allocation of sockets failed (because of resource constraints) it will return undef. This will
           usually  cause the caller do simply not forward the packet and wait for the reetransmit (at least for
           UDP).

       activate_session ( NAT_BASIC ,[\%PARAM] )
           NAT_BASIC is as described in "allocate_sockets" Activates a session in  the  transaction  defined  by
           CALLID,CSEQ.  This  will  cause  all  sessions for older transactions in the same call (identified by
           CALLID) to shut down.

           IDFROM and IDTO represent the sides of the session, e.g. for the activation to succeed there  had  to
           be an <b>allocate_sockets</b> call for each of these sides.

           PARAM is an optional hash reference. If given it will be added as user information to the new session
           and  given  back  in the information hash returned by close_session etc.  URI_FROM and URI_TO will be
           added to PARAM as "uri_from" and "uri_to".

           The method returns  two  items:  The  first  is  information  about  the  session  like  returned  in
           close_session,  the second is a flag, which is true, if the activation was for an already astablished
           session.

           The method is usually called whenever a SDP body is given and on ACK requests.

       close_session ( NAT_BASIC )
           NAT_BASIC is as described before.

           This will cause the close of the session described by the arguments (which have the same meaning like
           in <b>activate_session</b>). Usually called for BYE or CANCEL requests. For CANCEL it will  be  called  with
           CSEQ  (because it should cancel a specific transaction) while for BYE it will called with CSEQ undef,
           because it should end all sessions in this call.

           It will return a list with infos about all closed sessions. Each of these infos is a reference  to  a
           hash with the following items:

           callid
           cseq
           idfrom
           idto
           bytes_from - number of bytes received on the 'from' side
           bytes_to - number of bytes received on the 'to' side
           from - space delimited list of "ip:port/range" for the media on the 'from' side
           to - same for the 'to' side
           created - "time_t" when the session was created

           Stateless  proxies  should  forward  the packet even if the session did not exist, because the packet
           might be a retransmit referring to an already closed session.

       expire ( [ %ARGS ] )
           This causes the sessions and sockets to expire.  It will return a list with a hash for  each  expired
           session.  See close_session for details on the returned information.

           With %ARGS the behavior can be customized:

           time    Current time, can be given to save system call for getting current time.

           unused  Expire time for unused sockets. Default ist 180, e.g. 3 minutes.

           active  Expire  time  for active sessions. Default to 30 seconds. If no data gets transferred through
                   the session for "active" seconds the session will be closed.

           closed  Expire time for closed sessions, i.e.  the  time  after  which  the  sockets  from  a  closed
                   (replaced)  session  will  be  closed  too.  They  are usually kept open a short time in case
                   packets are still in transit. Default to 1 second.

       callbacks
           This will return a list (not a reference)  of  "[cbid,fd,callback]"  pairs,  where  fd  is  the  file
           descriptor  of the socket and callback is a callback for <b>invoke_callback</b> in Net::SIP::Util. cbid is a
           uniq id for each callback so that one get compare the result from different calls  to  callbacks  and
           see, what changed.

           Each  of  these  callbacks  should be invoked once the file descriptor gets readable and the callback
           will then forward the received packet to the other side of the session.

       sessions ( [ CALLBACK ] )
           This will call CALLBACK on all sessions and return an array containing the results of  the  callbacks
           together. If no CALLBACK is given it will return all session objects.

           To use this function you might need to know the interna of the session objects (see source code), but
           in most cases it is enough to know, that session objects have a method info_as_hash which will return
           infos about the session as hash like described in close_session.

       get_rtp_sockets ( NEW_ADDR, @MEDIA )
           Allocates  sockets  for on address NEW_ADDR for @MEDIA. @MEDIA is in the format given by <b>get_media</b> in
           Net::SIP::SDP.

           Returns   reference   to   array   of   allocated   media,   each   item   in   the   array   is   "[
           ADDR,BASE_PORT,\@SOCKS,\@TARGETS  ]",  where  ADDR  is  NEW_ADDR,  BASE_PORT  the  base  port for the
           allocated sockets, @SOCKS the allocated sockets and @TARGETS the "sockaddr" of the original  targets,
           e.g. where it needs to forward the data received on the sockets.

           If not all necssary sockets could be allocated it will allocate none and return "()".

           This  method  might  be redefined to better control resource allocation or to cache temporally unused
           resources together with unget_rtp_sockets.

       unget_rtp_sockets ( NEW_MEDIA )
           Will take resources back. NEW_MEDIA is the result from <b>get_rtp_sockets</b>.  Returns nothing.

           Together with get_rtp_sockets it could be redefined to not destroy resources but to  cache  them  for
           future use.

       dump
           This  method  is  used  for  debugging only. It will return a string with information about all calls
           within this nathelper and all sessions and allocated sockets within the calls.

       number_of_calls
           Returns the number of calls within the nathelper. This vaalue  has  not  much  association  with  the
           result  of <b>callbacks</b> because there might be inactive sockets (not yet or no longer in active session)
           which don't affect the result of <b>callbacks</b>.

           This value can be used to determine if <b>expire</b> needs to be called at all.
