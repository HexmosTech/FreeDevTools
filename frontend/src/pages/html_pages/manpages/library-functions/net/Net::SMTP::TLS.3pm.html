       Net::SMTP::TLS - An SMTP client supporting TLS and AUTH

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>

               'your.mail.host',
               Hello   =&gt;      'some.host.name',

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Net::SMTP::TLS</b> is a TLS and AUTH capable SMTP client which offers an interface that users will find
       familiar from Net::SMTP. <b>Net::SMTP::TLS</b> implements a subset of the methods provided by that module, but
       certainly not (yet) a complete mirror image of that API.

       The methods supported by <b>Net::SMTP::TLS</b> are used in the above example. Though self explanatory for the
       most part, please see the perldoc for Net::SMTP if you are unclear.

       The differences in the methods provided are as follows:

           The <u>mail</u> method does not take the options list taken by Net::SMTP

           The <u>to</u> method also does not take options, and is the only method available to set the recipient
           (unlike the many synonyms provided by Net::SMTP).

           The constructor takes a limited number of Net::SMTP's parameters. The constructor for <b>Net::SMTP::TLS</b>
           takes the following (in addition to the hostname of the mail server, which must be the first
           parameter and is not explicitly named):

               NoTLS - In the unlikely event that you need to use this class to perform non-TLS SMTP (you ought
               to be using Net::SMTP itself for that...), this will turn off TLS when supplied with a true
               value. This will most often cause an error related to authentication when used on a server that
               requires TLS

               Hello - hostname used in the EHLO command

               Port - port to connect to the SMTP service (defaults to 25)

               Timeout - Timeout for initial socket connection (defaults to 5, passed directly to
               IO::Socket::INET)

               User - username for SMTP AUTH

               Password - password for SMTP AUTH

</pre><h4><b>TLS</b> <b>and</b> <b>AUTHentication</b></h4><pre>
       During construction of an <b>Net::SMTP::TLS</b> instance, the full login process will occur. This involves first
       sending EHLO to the server, then initiating a TLS session through STARTTLS. Once this is complete, the
       module will attempt to login using the credentials supplied by the constructor, if such credentials have
       been supplied.

       The AUTH method will depend on the features returned by the server after the EHLO command. Based on that,
       CRAM-MD5 will be used if available, followed by LOGIN, followed by PLAIN. Please note that LOGIN is the
       only method of authentication that has been tested. CRAM-MD5 and PLAIN login functionality was taken
       directly from the script mentioned in the acknowledgements section, however, I have not tested them
       personally.

</pre><h4><b>ERROR</b> <b>HANDLING</b></h4><pre>
       This module will croak in the event of an SMTP error. Should you wish to handle this gracefully in your
       application, you may wrap your mail transmission in an eval {} block and check $@ afterward.

</pre><h4><b>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       This code was blatantly plagiarized from Michal Ludvig's smtp-client.pl script. See
       &lt;<a href="http://www.logix.cz/michal/devel/smtp">http://www.logix.cz/michal/devel/smtp</a>&gt; for his excellent work.
