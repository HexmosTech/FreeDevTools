</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Net::LDAP::LDIF - LDIF reading and writing

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        use Net::LDAP::LDIF;

        $ldif = Net::LDAP::LDIF-&gt;new( "file.ldif", "r", onerror =&gt; 'undef' );
        while ( not $ldif-&gt;eof ( ) ) {
          $entry = $ldif-&gt;read_entry ( );
          if ( $ldif-&gt;error ( ) ) {
            print "Error msg: ", $ldif-&gt;error ( ), "\n";
            print "Error lines:\n", $ldif-&gt;error_lines ( ), "\n";
          } else {
            # do stuff
          }
        }
        $ldif-&gt;done ( );

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Net::LDAP::LDIF</b> provides a means to convert between Net::LDAP::Entry objects and LDAP entries represented
       in LDIF format files. Reading and writing are supported and may manipulate single entries or lists of
       entries.

       As when reading an entire file into memory with perl normally, take into account the possibility of
       memory use when loading an LDIF file in one go.

</pre><h4><b>SPECIAL</b> <b>FEATURES</b></h4><pre>
       By default, Net::LDAP::LDIF supports reading attribute values from URLs of type "file://".

       When Gisle Aas' LWP module package is installed, Net::LDAP::LDIF uses it to also support reading data
       from the URL types supported by these modules; most prominently "http://", "https://", and "ftp://"
       resources.  This extended feature is dynamically detected at runtime.

</pre><h4><b>CONSTRUCTOR</b></h4><pre>
       new ( FILE [[, MODE ], OPTIONS ] )
           Open the file with the given mode.

           "FILE"  may  be the name of a file or an already open filehandle. If "FILE" begins or ends with a "|"
           then "FILE" will be passed directly to "open".

           "MODE" can be any of the modes allowed for Perl's <b>open()</b> function,  potentially  extended  by  PerlIO
           layers  as  described in perlopentut.  Alternatively, it can be one of the mode indicators "r", "r+",
           "w", "w+", "a", "a+" known from C's <b>fopen()</b> function, which get mapped to  their  Perl  counterparts.
           If "MODE" is omitted, it defaults to "r" for reading.

           "OPTIONS" is a list of name/value pairs, recognizing:

           encode =&gt; 'none' | 'canonical' | 'base64'
               Some DN values in LDIF cannot be written verbatim and have to be encoded in some way:

               'none'
                   The default.

               'canonical'
                   See "canonical_dn" in Net::LDAP::Util.

               'base64'
                   Use base64.

           onerror =&gt; 'die' | 'warn' | 'undef'
               Specify what happens when an error is detected.

               'die'
                   "Net::LDAP::LDIF" will croak with an appropriate message.

               'warn'
                   "Net::LDAP::LDIF" will warn with an appropriate message.

               'undef'
                   "Net::LDAP::LDIF"  will  warn  with  an appropriate message if "-w" is in effect.  The method
                   that was called will return "undef".

                   Note this value is the string 'undef', not the "undef" value.

           change =&gt; 1
               Write entry changes to the LDIF file instead of the entries itself.  I.e. write  LDAP  operations
               acting on the entries to the file instead of the entries contents.

           lowercase =&gt; 1
               Convert attribute names to lowercase when writing.

           sort =&gt; 1
               Sort attribute names when writing entries according to the rule: objectclass first then all other
               attributes alphabetically sorted

           version =&gt; '1'
               Set the LDIF version to write to the resulting LDIF file.

               According to RFC 2849 currently the only legal value for this option is <u>1</u>.

               When  this  option is set Net::LDAP::LDIF tries to adhere more strictly to the LDIF specification
               in RFC2489 in a few places.

               The default is <u>undef</u> meaning no version information is written to the LDIF file.

           wrap =&gt; 78
               Number of columns where output line wrapping shall occur.

               Default is 78. Setting it to 40 or lower inhibits wrapping.

           raw =&gt; REGEX
               Use REGEX to denote the names of attributes that are to be considered binary when reading.

               When this option is given, Net::LDAP converts all values of attributes not  matching  this  REGEX
               into Perl UTF-8 strings so that the regular Perl operators (pattern matching, ...) can operate as
               one expects even on strings with international characters.

               If this option is not given, attribute values are treated as byte strings.

               Example: raw =&gt; qr/(?i:^jpegPhoto|;binary)/

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       read_entry ( )
           Read one entry from the file and return it as a "Net::LDAP::Entry" object.

           In  scalar  mode,  the  "Net::LDAP::Entry"  object  is  returned  alone, while in list mode a list is
           returned  consisting  of  the  "Net::LDAP::Entry"  object  as  first   element   followed   by    all
           "Net::LDAP::Control" objects that were part of the LDIF entry.  See RFC 2849 for details.

       eof ( )
           Returns <u>true</u> when the end of the file is reached.

       write_entry ( ENTRY [, OPTIONS ], ... )
           Write entries to the LDIF file.

           The  arguments  accepted are a list of entries, optionally interspersed with options belonging to the
           preceding entry.

           For each entry, "OPTIONS" is a list of key-value pairs, recognizing:

           control =&gt; CONTROL
           control =&gt; [ CONTROL, ... ]
               See "CONTROLS" in Net::LDAP.

       write_version ( )
           If the object's version is defined, this method allows one to explicitly write the version before  an
           entry is written.

           If  not called explicitly, it gets called automatically when writing the first entry.

       version ( [ VERSION ] )
           If  called  without arguments it returns the version of the LDIF file or undef if no version has been
           set.  If called with an argument it sets the LDIF version to VERSION.

           According to RFC 2849 currently the only legal value for VERSION is <u>1</u>.

       handle ( )
           Returns the file handle the "Net::LDAP::LDIF" object reads from or writes to.

       done ( )
           This method signals that the LDIF object is no longer needed. If a file was opened automatically when
           the object was created it will be closed. This method is called automatically via  DESTROY  when  the
           object goes out of scope.

       error ( )
           Returns error message if error was found.

       error_lines ( )
           Returns lines that resulted in error.

       current_entry ( )
           Returns the current "Net::LDAP::Entry" object.

       current_lines ( )
           Returns the lines that generated the current "Net::LDAP::Entry" object.

       next_lines ( )
           Returns the lines that will generate the next "Net::LDAP::Entry" object.
