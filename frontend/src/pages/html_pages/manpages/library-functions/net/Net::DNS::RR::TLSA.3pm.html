</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Net::DNS::RR::TLSA - DNS TLSA resource record

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
               use Net::DNS;
               $rr = Net::DNS::RR-&gt;new('name TLSA usage selector matchingtype certificate');

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The Transport Layer Security Authentication (TLSA) DNS resource record is used to associate a TLS server
       certificate or public key with the domain name where the record is found, forming a "TLSA certificate
       association".  The semantics of how the TLSA RR is interpreted are described in RFC6698.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       The available methods are those inherited from the base class augmented by the type-specific methods
       defined in this package.

       Use of undocumented package features or direct access to internal data structures is discouraged and
       could result in program termination or other unpredictable behaviour.

   <b>usage</b>
               $usage = $rr-&gt;usage;
               $rr-&gt;usage( $usage );

       8-bit integer value which specifies the provided association that will be used to match the certificate
       presented in the TLS handshake.

   <b>selector</b>
               $selector = $rr-&gt;selector;
               $rr-&gt;selector( $selector );

       8-bit integer value which specifies which part of the TLS certificate presented by the server will be
       matched against the association data.

   <b>matchingtype</b>
               $matchingtype = $rr-&gt;matchingtype;
               $rr-&gt;matchingtype( $matchingtype );

       8-bit integer value which specifies how the certificate association is presented.

   <b>certificate</b>
   <b>cert</b>
               $cert = $rr-&gt;cert;
               $rr-&gt;cert( $cert );

       Hexadecimal representation of the certificate data.

   <b>certbin</b>
               $certbin = $rr-&gt;certbin;
               $rr-&gt;certbin( $certbin );

       Binary representation of the certificate data.

   <b>babble</b>
               print $rr-&gt;babble;

       The <b>babble()</b> method returns the 'BubbleBabble' representation of the digest if the Digest::BubbleBabble
       package is available, otherwise an empty string is returned.

       BubbleBabble represents a message digest as a string of plausible words, to make the digest easier to
       verify.  The "words" are not necessarily real words, but they look more like words than a string of hex
       characters.

       The 'BubbleBabble' string is appended as a comment when the string method is called.
