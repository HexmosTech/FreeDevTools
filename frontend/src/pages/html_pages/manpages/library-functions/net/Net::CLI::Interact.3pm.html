</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Net::CLI::Interact - Toolkit for CLI Automation

</pre><h4><b>PURPOSE</b></h4><pre>
       This module exists to support developers of applications and libraries which must interact with a command
       line interface.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        use Net::CLI::Interact;

        my $s = Net::CLI::Interact-&gt;new({
           personality =&gt; 'cisco',
           transport   =&gt; 'Telnet',
           connect_options =&gt; { host =&gt; '192.0.2.1' },
        });

        # respond to a usename/password prompt
        $s-&gt;macro('to_user_exec', {
            params =&gt; ['my_username', 'my_password'],
        });

        my $interfaces = $s-&gt;cmd('show ip interfaces brief');

        $s-&gt;macro('to_priv_exec', {
            params =&gt; ['my_password'],
        });
        # matched prompt is updated automatically

        # paged output is slurped into one response
        $s-&gt;macro('show_run');
        my $config = $s-&gt;last_response;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Automating command line interface (CLI) interactions is not a new idea, but can be tricky to implement.
       This module aims to provide a simple and manageable interface to CLI interactions, supporting:

       •   SSH, Telnet and Serial-Line connections

       •   Unix and Windows support

       •   Reuseable device command phrasebooks

       If  you're  a new user, please read the Tutorial. There's also a Cookbook and a Phrasebook Listing. For a
       more complete worked example check out the Net::Appliance::Session distribution, for  which  this  module
       was written.

</pre><h4><b>INTERFACE</b></h4><pre>
   <b>new(</b> <b>\%options</b> <b>)</b>
       Prepares  a  new  session  for  you,  but  will not connect to any device. On Windows platforms, you <b>must</b>
       download the "plink.exe" program, and pass its location to the "app" parameter. Other options are:

       "personality =&gt; $name" (required)
           The family of device command phrasebooks to load. There is a built-in library within this module,  or
           you  can  provide  a  search  path to other libraries. See Net::CLI::Interact::Manual::Phrasebook for
           further details.

       "transport =&gt; $backend" (required)
           The name of the transport backend used for the session, which may be one of Telnet, SSH, or Serial.

       "connect_options =&gt; \%options"
           If the transport backend can take any options (for example the  target  hostname),  then  pass  those
           options  in  this value as a hash ref. See the respective manual pages for each transport backend for
           further details.

       "log_at =&gt; $log_level"
           To make using the "logger" somewhat easier, you can pass this argument the name of a log <u>level</u>  (such
           as "debug", "info", etc) and all logging in the library will be enabled at that level. Use "debug" to
           learn  about  how the library is working internally. See Net::CLI::Interact::Logger for a list of the
           valid level names.

       "timeout =&gt; $seconds"
           Configures a default timeout value, in seconds, for interaction with the remote device.  The  default
           is 10 seconds. You can also set timeout on a per-command or per-macro call (see below).

           Note that this does not (currently) apply to the initial connection.

   <b>cmd(</b> <b>$command</b> <b>)</b>
       Execute  a  single  command  statement on the connected device, and consume output until there is a match
       with the current <u>prompt</u>. The statement is executed verbatim on the device, with a newline appended.

       In scalar context the "last_response" is returned (see below). In list context the gathered  response  is
       returned as a list of lines. In both cases your local platform's newline character will end all lines.

   <b>macro(</b> <b>$name,</b> <b>\%options?</b> <b>)</b>
       Execute the commands contained within the named Macro, which must be loaded from a Phrasebook. Options to
       control  the output, including variables for substitution into the Macro, are passed in the %options hash
       reference.

       In scalar context the "last_response" is returned (see below). In list context the gathered  response  is
       returned as a list of lines. In both cases your local platform's newline character will end all lines.

   <b>last_response</b>
       Returns  the  gathered  output  after  the  most  recent  "cmd" or "macro". In scalar context all data is
       returned. In list context the gathered response is returned as a list of lines. In both cases your  local
       platform's newline character will end all lines.

   <b>transport</b>
       Returns  the Transport backend which was loaded based on the "transport" option to "new". See the Telnet,
       SSH, or Serial documentation for further details.

   <b>phrasebook</b>
       Returns the Phrasebook object which was loaded based on the "personality"  option  given  to  "new".  See
       Net::CLI::Interact::Phrasebook for further details.

   <b>set_phrasebook(</b> <b>\%options</b> <b>)</b>
       Allows you to (re-)configure the loaded phrasebook, perhaps changing the personality or library, or other
       properties.  The  %options Hash ref should be any parameters from the Phrasebook module, but at a minimum
       must include a "personality".

   <b>set_default_contination(</b> <b>$macro_name</b> <b>)</b>
       Briefly,  a  Continuation  handles   the   slurping   of   paged   output   from   commands.    See   the
       Net::CLI::Interact::Phrasebook documentation for further details.

       Pass  in  the  name  of a defined Contination (Macro) to enable paging handling as a default for all sent
       commands. This is an alternative to describing the Continuation format in each Macro.

       To unset the default Continuation, call the "clear_default_continuation" method.

   <b>logger</b>
       This is the application's Logger object. A powerful logging subsystem is available to  your  application,
       built  upon  the Log::Dispatch distribution. You can enable logging of this module's processes at various
       levels, or add your own logging statements.

   <b>set_global_log_at(</b> <b>$level</b> <b>)</b>
       To make using the "logger" somewhat easier, you can pass this method the name of a  log  <u>level</u>  (such  as
       "debug",  "info", etc) and all logging in the library will be enabled at that level. Use "debug" to learn
       about how the library is working internally. See Net::CLI::Interact::Logger for a list of the valid level
       names.

</pre><h4><b>FUTHER</b> <b>READING</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Prompt</b> <b>Matching</b>
       Whenever a command statement is issued, output is slurped until a matching prompt is seen in that output.
       Control of the Prompts is shared between the definitions in Net::CLI::Interact::Phrasebook  dictionaries,
       and  methods  of the Net::CLI::Interact::Role::Prompt core component. See that module's documentation for
       further details.

   <b>Actions</b> <b>and</b> <b>ActionSets</b>
       All commands and macros are composed from  their  phrasebook  definitions  into  Actions  and  ActionSets
       (iterable  sequences of Actions).  See those modules' documentation for further details, in case you wish
       to introspect their structures.
