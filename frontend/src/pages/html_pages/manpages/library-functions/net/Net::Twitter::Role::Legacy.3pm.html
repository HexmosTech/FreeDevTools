</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Net::Twitter::Role::Legacy - A Net::Twitter legacy compatibility layer as a Moose role

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 4.01043

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Net::Twitter;

           my $nt = Net::Twitter-&gt;new(
               username =&gt; $username,
               password =&gt; $password,
               traits   =&gt; [qw/Legacy/],
           );

           my $followers = $nt-&gt;followers;
           if ( !followers ) {
               warn $nt-&gt;http_message;
           }

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module provides a <b>Net::Twitter</b> compatibility layer for Net::Twitter.  It pulls in the additional
       traits: "API::REST", "API::Search", "API::Identica", and "WrapError".

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       new This  method  takes  the  same parameters as "new" in Net::Twitter.  In addition, it also support the
           options:

           arrayref_on_error
               When set to 1, on error, rather than returning undef, the API methods will return an empty  ARRAY
               ref.  Defaults to 0.

           twittervision
               When set to 1, enables the "upade_twittervision" call.  Defaults to 0.

       clone
           Creates  a  shallow  copy  of  the  "Net::Twitter"  object.   This  was useful, in legacy versions of
           "Net::Twitter" for handling concurrent  requests  (for  instance  with  LWP::UserAgent::POE).   Since
           errors  are  wrapped in the "Net::Twitter" concurrent requests each needed their own object.  "clone"
           served that purpose.

           The recommended approach for concurrent requests is to use "Net::Twitter"'s ability throw exceptions,
           now.
