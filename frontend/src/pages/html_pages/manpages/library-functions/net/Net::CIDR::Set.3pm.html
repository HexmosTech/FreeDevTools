</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Net::CIDR::Set - Manipulate sets of IP addresses

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This document describes Net::CIDR::Set version 0.15

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Net::CIDR::Set;

         my $priv = Net::CIDR::Set-&gt;new( '10.0.0.0/8', '172.16.0.0/12',
           '192.168.0.0/16' );
         for my $ip ( @addr ) {
           if ( $priv-&gt;contains( $ip ) ) {
             print "$ip is private\n";
           }
         }

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       "Net::CIDR::Set" represents sets of IP addresses and allows standard set operations (union, intersection,
       membership test etc) to be performed on them.

       In spite of the name it can work with sets consisting of arbitrary ranges of IP addresses - not just CIDR
       blocks.

       Both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are handled - but they may not be mixed in the same set. You may explicitly
       set the personality of a set:

         my $ip4set = Net::CIDR::Set-&gt;new({ type =&gt; 'ipv4 }, '10.0.0.0/8');

       Normally this isn't necessary - the set will guess its personality from the first data that is added to
       it.

</pre><h4><b>INTERFACE</b></h4><pre>
   <b>"new"</b>
       Create a new Net::CIDR::Set. All arguments are optional. May be passed a list of list of IP addresses or
       ranges which, if present, will be passed to "add".

       The first argument may be a hash reference which will be inspected for named options. Currently the only
       option that may be passed is "type" which should be 'ipv4', 'ipv6' or the name of a coder class. See
       Net::CIDR::Set::IPv4 and Net::CIDR::Set::IPv6 for examples of coder classes.

   <b>"invert"</b>
       Invert (negate, complement) a set in-place.

         my $set = Net::CIDR::Set-&gt;new;
         $set-&gt;invert;

   <b>"copy"</b>
       Make a deep copy of a set.

         my $set2 = $set-&gt;copy;

   <b>"add"</b>
       Add a number of addresses or ranges to a set.

         $set-&gt;add(
           '10.0.0.0/8',
           '192.168.0.32-192.168.0.63',
           '127.0.0.1'
         );

       It is legal to add ranges that overlap with each other and/or with the ranges already in the set.
       Overlapping ranges are merged.

   <b>"remove"</b>
       Remove a number of addresses or ranges from a set.

         $set-&gt;remove(
           '8.8.0.0/16',
           '158.152.1.58'
         );

       There is no requirement that the addresses being removed be members of the set.

   <b>"merge"</b>
       Merge the contents of other sets into this set.

         $set = Net::CIDR::Set-&gt;new;
         $set-&gt;merge($s1, $s2);

   <b>"contains"</b>
       A synonmym for "contains_all".

   <b>"contains_all"</b>
       Return true if the set contains all of the supplied addresses.  Given this set:

         my $set = Net::CIDR::Set-&gt;new('244.188.12.0/8');

       this condition is true:

         if ( $set-&gt;contains_all('244.188.12.128/3') ) {
           # ...
         }

       while this condition is false:

         if ( $set-&gt;contains_all('244.188.12.0/12') ) {
           # ...
         }

   <b>"contains_any"</b>
       Return true if there is any overlap between the supplied addresses/ranges and the contents of the set.

   <b>"complement"</b>
       Return a new set that is the complement of this set.

         my $inv = $set-&gt;complement;

   <b>"union"</b>
       Return a new set that is the union of a number of sets. This is equivalent to a logical OR between sets.

         my $everything = $east-&gt;union($west);

   <b>"intersection"</b>
       Return a new set that is the intersection of a number of sets. This is equivalent to a logical AND
       between sets.

         my $overlap = $north-&gt;intersection($south);

   <b>"xor"</b>
       Return a new set that is the exclusive-or of existing sets.

         my $xset = $this-&gt;xor($that);

       The resulting set will contain all addresses that are members of one set but not the other.

   <b>"diff"</b>
       Return a new set containing all the addresses that are present in this set but not another.

         my $diff = $this-&gt;diff($that);

   <b>"is_empty"</b>
       Return a true value if the set is empty.

         if ( $set-&gt;is_empty ) {
           print "Nothing there!\n";
         }

   <b>"superset"</b>
       Return true if this set is a superset of the supplied set.

   <b>"subset"</b>
       Return true if this set is a subset of the supplied set.

   <b>"equals"</b>
       Return true if this set is identical to another set.

         if ( $set-&gt;equals($foo) ) {
           print "We have the same addresses.\n";
         }

</pre><h4><b>Retrieving</b> <b>Set</b> <b>Contents</b></h4><pre>
       The following methods allow the contents of a set to be retrieved in various representations. Each of the
       following methods accepts an optional numeric argument that controls the formatting of the returned
       addresses. It may take one of the following values:

       0   Format  each range of addresses as compactly as possible. If the range contains only a single address
           format it as such. If it  can  be  represented  as  a  single  CIDR  block  use  CIDR  representation
           (&lt;ip&gt;/&lt;mask&gt;) otherwise format it as an arbitrary range (&lt;start&gt;-&lt;end&gt;).

       1   Always  format  as  either  a  CIDR  block  or  an arbitrary range even if the range is just a single
           address.

       2   Always use arbitrary range format (&lt;start&gt;-&lt;end&gt;) even if the range is a single address  or  a  legal
           CIDR block.

       Here's an example of the different formatting options:

         my $set = Net::CIDR::Set-&gt;new( '127.0.0.1', '192.168.37.0/24',
           '10.0.0.11-10.0.0.17' );

         for my $fmt ( 0 .. 2 ) {
           print "Using format $fmt:\n";
           print "  $_\n" for $set-&gt;as_range_array( $fmt );
         }

       And here's the output from that code:

         Using format 0:
           10.0.0.11-10.0.0.17
           127.0.0.1
           192.168.37.0/24
         Using format 1:
           10.0.0.11-10.0.0.17
           127.0.0.1/32
           192.168.37.0/24
         Using format 2:
           10.0.0.11-10.0.0.17
           127.0.0.1-127.0.0.1
           192.168.37.0-192.168.37.255

       Note that this option never affects the addresses that are returned; only how they are formatted.

       For most purposes the formatting argument can be omitted; it's default value is 0 which provides the most
       general formatting.

   <b>"iterate_addresses"</b>
       Return an iterator (a closure) that will return each of the addresses in the set in ascending order. This
       code

         my $set = Net::CIDR::Set-&gt;new('192.168.37.0/24');
         my $iter = $set-&gt;iterate_addresses;
         while ( my $ip = $iter-&gt;() ) {
           print "Got $ip\n";
         }

       outputs 256 distinct addresses from 192.168.37.0 to 192.168.27.255.

   <b>"iterate_cidr"</b>
       Return  an  iterator  (a closure) that will return each of the CIDR blocks in the set in ascending order.
       This code

         my $set = Net::CIDR::Set-&gt;new('192.168.37.9-192.168.37.134');
         my $iter = $set-&gt;iterate_cidr;
         while ( my $cidr = $iter-&gt;() ) {
           print "Got $cidr\n";
         }

       outputs

         Got 192.168.37.9
         Got 192.168.37.10/31
         Got 192.168.37.12/30
         Got 192.168.37.16/28
         Got 192.168.37.32/27
         Got 192.168.37.64/26
         Got 192.168.37.128/30
         Got 192.168.37.132/31
         Got 192.168.37.134

       This is the most compact CIDR representation of the set because its limits don't fall on convenient  CIDR
       boundaries.

   <b>"iterate_ranges"</b>
       Return  an  iterator  (a closure) that will return each of the ranges in the set in ascending order. This
       code

         my $set = Net::CIDR::Set-&gt;new(
           '192.168.37.9-192.168.37.134',
           '127.0.0.1',
           '10.0.0.0/8'
         );
         my $iter = $set-&gt;iterate_ranges;
         while ( my $range = $iter-&gt;() ) {
           print "Got $range\n";
         }

       outputs

         Got 10.0.0.0/8
         Got 127.0.0.1
         Got 192.168.37.9-192.168.37.134

   <b>"as_array"</b>
       Convenience method that gathers all of the output from one of the iterators above into an array.

         my @ranges = $set-&gt;as_array( $set-&gt;iterate_ranges );

       Normally you will use one of "as_address_array", "as_cidr_array" or "as_range_array" instead.

   <b>"as_address_array"</b>
       Return an array containing all of the distinct addresses in a set. Note that this may very easily  create
       a  very  large array. At the time of writing it is, for example, unlikely that you have enough memory for
       an array containing all of the possible IPv6 addresses...

   <b>"as_cidr_array"</b>
       Return an array containing all of the distinct CIDR blocks in a set.

   <b>"as_range_array"</b>
       Return an array containing all of the ranges in a set.

   <b>"as_string"</b>
       Return a compact string representation of a set.
