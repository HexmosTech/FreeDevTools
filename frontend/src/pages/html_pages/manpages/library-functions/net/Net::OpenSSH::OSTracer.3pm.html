       Net::OpenSSH::OSTracer - trace ssh master process at the OS level

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Net::OpenSSH;
           $Net::OpenSSH::debug |= 512;

           Net::OpenSSH-&gt;new($host)-&gt;system("echo hello world");

           system "less /tmp/net_openssh_master.*.strace";

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This is a Net::OpenSSH helper module that allows you to trace the master "ssh" process at the operating
       system level using the proper utility available in your system (e.g., "strace", "truss", "ktruss",
       "tusc", etc.).

       This feature can be used when debugging your programs or to report bugs on the module.

       It is enabled setting the flag 512 on the $Net::OpenSSH::debug variable:

         $Net::OpenSSH::debug |= 512;

       By default the output files of the tracer are saved as "/tmp/net_openssh_master.$pid.$tracer_type".

       Also, the output send by the tracer to stdout/stderr is saved as "/tmp/net_openssh_master.$pid.txt".

       The module can be configured through the following global variables:

       $Net::OpenSSH::OSTracer::type
           By  default,  the  module  decides  which  tracer  to  use in base to the operating system name. This
           variable allows one to select a different tracer.

           Currently accepted types are: "strace" (Linux), "ktrace" (*BSD), "tusc" (HP-UX) and "truss"  (Solaris
           and AIX).

       $Net::OpenSSH::OSTracer::cmd
           Command to execute for tracing the "ssh" process.

           By default, it infers it from the tracer type selected.

       $Net::OpenSSH::OSTracer::output
           Basename for the destination file. The PID of the "ssh" process and the tracer type will be appended.

       $Net::OpenSSH::OSTracer::sudo
           This  variable can be used to request the tracer to be run with "sudo" (some operating systems as for
           example Ubuntu, do not allow one to attach tracers, even to your own processes, unless you do  it  as
           root).

           The variable has to be set with the path of the "sudo" binary. For instance:

             $Net::OpenSSH::OSTracer::sudo = '<a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?sudo">/usr/bin/sudo</a>';

           If you need to pass a password to "sudo", set the environment variable "SUDO_ASKPASS". For instance:

             SUDO_ASKPASS=/usr/bin/ssh-askpass

       $Net::OpenSSH::OSTracer::delay
           This  variable  can  be  used  to delay the "ssh" execution so that the tracer can attach the process
           first. This is specially handy when using "sudo" with a password.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       This module has not been tested under all the operating systems is says to support.

       If you find any problem, just report it, please!
