</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Net::DNS::RR::NSEC3 - DNS NSEC3 resource record

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
               use Net::DNS;
               $rr = Net::DNS::RR-&gt;new('name NSEC3 algorithm flags iterations salt hnxtname');

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Class for DNSSEC NSEC3 resource records.

       The NSEC3 Resource Record (RR) provides authenticated denial of existence for DNS Resource Record Sets.

       The NSEC3 RR lists RR types present at the original owner name of the NSEC3 RR.  It includes the next
       hashed owner name in the hash order of the zone.  The complete set of NSEC3 RRs in a zone indicates which
       RRSets exist for the original owner name of the RR and form a chain of hashed owner names in the zone.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       The available methods are those inherited from the base class augmented by the type-specific methods
       defined in this package.

       Use of undocumented package features or direct access to internal data structures is discouraged and
       could result in program termination or other unpredictable behaviour.

   <b>algorithm</b>
               $algorithm = $rr-&gt;algorithm;
               $rr-&gt;algorithm( $algorithm );

       The 8-bit algorithm field is represented as an unsigned decimal integer, but may be specified using the
       algorithm mnemonic.

       <b>algorithm()</b> may also be invoked as a class method or simple function to perform mnemonic and numeric code
       translation.

   <b>flags</b>
               $flags = $rr-&gt;flags;
               $rr-&gt;flags( $flags );

       The Flags field is an unsigned decimal integer interpreted as eight concatenated Boolean values.

       optout
                   $rr-&gt;<a href="../man1/optout.1.html">optout</a>(1);

                   if ( $rr-&gt;optout ) {
                           ...
                   }

           Boolean Opt Out flag.

   <b>iterations</b>
               $iterations = $rr-&gt;iterations;
               $rr-&gt;iterations( $iterations );

       The  Iterations  field  is represented as an unsigned decimal integer.  The value is between 0 and 65535,
       inclusive.

   <b>salt</b>
               $salt = $rr-&gt;salt;
               $rr-&gt;salt( $salt );

       The Salt field is represented as a contiguous sequence of hexadecimal digits. A "-" (unquoted) is used in
       string format to indicate that the salt field is absent.

   <b>saltbin</b>
               $saltbin = $rr-&gt;saltbin;
               $rr-&gt;saltbin( $saltbin );

       The Salt field as a sequence of octets.

   <b>hnxtname</b>
               $hnxtname = $rr-&gt;hnxtname;
               $rr-&gt;hnxtname( $hnxtname );

       The Next Hashed Owner Name field points to the next node  that  has  authoritative  data  or  contains  a
       delegation point NS RRset.

   <b>typelist</b>
               @typelist = $rr-&gt;typelist;
               $typelist = $rr-&gt;typelist;
               $rr-&gt;typelist( @typelist );

       <b>typelist()</b> identifies the RRset types that exist at the domain name matched by the NSEC3 RR.  When called
       in scalar context, the list is interpolated into a string.

   <b>typemap</b>
               $exists = $rr-&gt;typemap($rrtype);

       <b>typemap()</b>  returns  a  Boolean  true value if the specified RRtype occurs in the type bitmap of the NSEC3
       record.

   <b>match</b>
               $matched = $rr-&gt;match( 'example.foo' );

       <b>match()</b> returns a Boolean true value if the hash of the domain name argument  matches  the  hashed  owner
       name of the NSEC3 RR.

   <b>covers</b>
               $covered = $rr-&gt;covers( 'example.foo' );

       <b>covers()</b>  returns a Boolean true value if the hash of the domain name argument, or ancestor of that name,
       falls between the owner name and the next hashed owner name of the NSEC3 RR.

   <b>encloser,</b> <b>nextcloser,</b> <b>wildcard</b>
               $encloser = $rr-&gt;encloser( 'example.foo' );
               print "encloser: $encloser\n" if $encloser;

       <b>encloser()</b> returns the name of a provable encloser of the query name argument obtained from the NSEC3 RR.

       <b>nextcloser()</b> returns the next closer name, which is one label longer than the closest encloser.  This  is
       only valid after <b>encloser()</b> has returned a valid domain name.

       <b>wildcard()</b> returns the unexpanded wildcard name from which the next closer name was possibly synthesised.
       This is only valid after <b>encloser()</b> has returned a valid domain name.
