</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Net::XMPP - XMPP Perl Library

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       Net::XMPP provides a Perl user with access to the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP).

       For more information about XMPP visit:

       &lt;<a href="http://www.xmpp.org">http://www.xmpp.org</a>&gt;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Net::XMPP is a convenient tool to use for any perl script that would like to utilize the XMPP Instant
       Messaging protocol.  While not a client in and of itself, it provides all of the necessary back-end
       functions to make a CGI client or command-line perl client feasible and easy to use.  Net::XMPP is a
       wrapper around the rest of the official Net::XMPP::xxxxxx packages.

       There is are example scripts in the example directory that provide you with examples of very simple XMPP
       programs.

       NOTE: The parser that XML::Stream::Parser provides, as are most Perl parsers, is synchronous.  If you are
       in the middle of parsing a packet and call a user defined callback, the Parser is blocked until your
       callback finishes.  This means you cannot be operating on a packet, send out another packet and wait for
       a response to that packet.  It will never get to you.  Threading might solve this, but as of this writing
       threading in Perl is not quite up to par yet.  This issue will be revisted in the future.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
         use Net::XMPP;
         my $client = Net::XMPP::Client-&gt;new();

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       The Net::XMPP module does not define any methods that you will call directly in your code.  Instead you
       will instantiate objects that call functions from this module to do work.  The three main objects that
       you will work with are the Message, Presence, and IQ modules. Each one corresponds to the Jabber
       equivalent and allows you get and set all parts of those packets.

       There are a few functions that are the same across all of the objects:

   <b>Retrieval</b> <b>functions</b>
       GetXML
           Returns the XML string that represents the data contained in the object.

             $xml  = $obj-&gt;GetXML();

       GetChild
           Returns  an  array  of Net::XMPP::Stanza objects that represent all of the stanzas in the object that
           are namespaced.  If you specify a namespace then only stanza objects with that XMLNS are returned.

             @xObj = $obj-&gt;GetChild();
             @xObj = $obj-&gt;GetChild("my:namespace");

       GetTag
           Return the root tag name of the packet.

       GetTree
           Return the XML::Stream::Node object that contains the data.  See XML::Stream::Node  for  methods  you
           can call on this object.

   <b>Creation</b> <b>functions</b>
       NewChild
             NewChild(namespace)
             NewChild(namespace,tag)

           Creates  a  new  Net::XMPP::Stanza  object  with the specified namespace and root tag of whatever the
           namespace says its root tag should be.  Optionally you may specify another root tag if the default is
           not desired, or the namespace requres you to set one.

             $xObj = $obj-&gt;NewChild("my:namespace");
             $xObj = $obj-&gt;NewChild("my:namespace","foo");

           ie. &lt;foo xmlns='my:namespace'...&gt;&lt;/foo&gt;

       InsertRawXML
             InsertRawXML(string)

           puts the specified string raw into the XML packet that you call this on.

             $message-&gt;InsertRawXML("&lt;foo&gt;&lt;/foo&gt;")
               &lt;message...&gt;...&lt;foo&gt;&lt;/foo&gt;&lt;/message&gt;

             $x = $message-&gt;NewChild(..);
             $x-&gt;InsertRawXML("test");

             $query = $iq-&gt;GetChild(..);
             $query-&gt;InsertRawXML("test");

       ClearRawXML
             ClearRawXML()

           Removes the raw XML from the packet.

   <b>Removal</b> <b>functions</b>
       RemoveChild
             RemoveChild()
             RemoveChild(namespace)

           Removes all of the namespaces child elements from the object.  If a namespace is provided, then  only
           the children with that namespace are removed.

   <b>Test</b> <b>functions</b>
       DefinedChild
             DefinedChild()
             DefinedChild(namespace)

           Returns  1  if there are any known namespaced stanzas in the packet, 0 otherwise.  Optionally you can
           specify a namespace and determine if there are any stanzas with that namespace.

             $test = $obj-&gt;DefinedChild();
             $test = $obj-&gt;DefinedChild("my:namespace");

</pre><h4><b>PACKAGES</b></h4><pre>
       For more information on each of these packages, please see the man page for each one.

   <b>Net::XMPP::Client</b>
       This package contains the code needed to communicate with an XMPP server: login, wait for messages,  send
       messages,  and  logout.  It uses XML::Stream to read the stream from the server and based on what kind of
       tag it encounters it calls a function to handle the tag.

   <b>Net::XMPP::Protocol</b>
       A collection of high-level functions that Client uses to make their  lives  easier.   These  methods  are
       inherited by the Client.

   <b>Net::XMPP::JID</b>
       The  XMPP  IDs  consist  of  three parts: user id, server, and resource.  This module gives you access to
       those components without having to parse the string yourself.

   <b>Net::XMPP::Message</b>
       Everything needed to create and read a &lt;message/&gt; received from the server.

   <b>Net::XMPP::Presence</b>
       Everything needed to create and read a &lt;presence/&gt; received from the server.

   <b>Net::XMPP::IQ</b>
       IQ is a wrapper around a number of modules that provide support for  the  various  Info/Query  namespaces
       that XMPP recognizes.

   <b>Net::XMPP::Stanza</b>
       This module represents a namespaced stanza that is used to extend a &lt;message/&gt;, &lt;presence/&gt;, and &lt;iq/&gt;.

       The  man  page for Net::XMPP::Stanza contains a listing of all supported namespaces, and the methods that
       are supported by the objects that represent those namespaces.

   <b>Net::XMPP::Namespaces</b>
       XMPP allows for any stanza to be extended by any bit of XML.  This module contains all of  the  internals
       for  defining  the XMPP based extensions defined by the IETF.  The documentation for this module explains
       more about how to add your own custom namespace and have it be supported.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       See unpatched issues at &lt;https://rt.cpan.org/Dist/Display.html?Queue=Net-XMPP&gt;.

       There is at least one issue with XML::Stream providing different node structures  depending  on  how  the
       node is created. Net::XMPP should now be able to handle this, but who knows what else lurks.
