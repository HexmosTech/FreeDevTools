</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Regexp::Common::net -- provide regexes for IPv4, IPv6, and MAC addresses.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Regexp::Common qw /net/;

           while (&lt;&gt;) {
               /$RE{net}{IPv4}/       and print "Dotted decimal IP address";
               /$RE{net}{IPv4}{hex}/  and print "Dotted hexadecimal IP address";
               /$RE{net}{IPv4}{oct}{-sep =&gt; ':'}/ and
                                      print "Colon separated octal IP address";
               /$RE{net}{IPv4}{bin}/  and print "Dotted binary IP address";
               /$RE{net}{MAC}/        and print "MAC address";
               /$RE{net}{MAC}{oct}{-sep =&gt; " "}/ and
                                      print "Space separated octal MAC address";
           }

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Please consult the manual of Regexp::Common for a general description of the works of this interface.

       Do not use this module directly, but load it via <u>Regexp::Common</u>.

       This modules gives you regular expressions for various style IPv4, IPv6, and MAC (or ethernet) addresses.

   <b>"$RE{net}{IPv4}"</b>
       Returns a pattern that matches a valid IP address in "dotted decimal".  Note that while 318.99.183.11 is
       not a valid IP address, it does match "/$RE{net}{IPv4}/", but this is because 318.99.183.11 contains a
       valid IP address, namely 18.99.183.11. To prevent the unwanted matching, one needs to anchor the regexp:
       "/^$RE{net}{IPv4}$/".

       For this pattern and the next four, under "-keep" (See Regexp::Common):

       $1  captures the entire match

       $2  captures the first component of the address

       $3  captures the second component of the address

       $4  captures the third component of the address

       $5  captures the final component of the address

   <b>"$RE{net}{IPv4}{dec}{-sep}"</b>
       Returns  a  pattern that matches a valid IP address in "dotted decimal".  Leading 0s are allowed, as long
       as each component does not exceed 3 digits.

       If "-sep=<u>P</u>" is specified the pattern <u>P</u> is used as the separator.  By default <u>P</u> is "qr/[.]/".

   <b>"$RE{net}{IPv4}{strict}{-sep}"</b>
       Returns a pattern that matches a valid IP address in "dotted decimal", but disallow any leading 0s.

       If "-sep=<u>P</u>" is specified the pattern <u>P</u> is used as the separator.  By default <u>P</u> is "qr/[.]/".

   <b>"$RE{net}{IPv4}{hex}{-sep}"</b>
       Returns a pattern that matches a valid IP address in "dotted hexadecimal", with the letters  "A"  to  "F"
       capitalized.

       If  "-sep=<u>P</u>"  is  specified the pattern <u>P</u> is used as the separator.  By default <u>P</u> is "qr/[.]/". "-sep="""
       and "-sep=" "" are useful alternatives.

   <b>"$RE{net}{IPv4}{oct}{-sep}"</b>
       Returns a pattern that matches a valid IP address in "dotted octal"

       If "-sep=<u>P</u>" is specified the pattern <u>P</u> is used as the separator.  By default <u>P</u> is "qr/[.]/".

   <b>"$RE{net}{IPv4}{bin}{-sep}"</b>
       Returns a pattern that matches a valid IP address in "dotted binary"

       If "-sep=<u>P</u>" is specified the pattern <u>P</u> is used as the separator.  By default <u>P</u> is "qr/[.]/".

   <b>"$RE{net}{MAC}"</b>
       Returns a pattern that matches a valid MAC or ethernet address as colon separated hexadecimals.

       For this pattern, and the next four, under "-keep" (See Regexp::Common):

       $1  captures the entire match

       $2  captures the first component of the address

       $3  captures the second component of the address

       $4  captures the third component of the address

       $5  captures the fourth component of the address

       $6  captures the fifth component of the address

       $7  captures the sixth and final component of the address

       This pattern, and the next four, have a "subs" method as  well,  which  will  transform  a  matching  MAC
       address into so called canonical format.  Canonical format means that every component of the address will
       be exactly two hexadecimals (with a leading zero if necessary), and the components will be separated by a
       colon.

   <b>"$RE{net}{MAC}{dec}{-sep}"</b>
       Returns a pattern that matches a valid MAC address as colon separated decimals.

       If "-sep=<u>P</u>" is specified the pattern <u>P</u> is used as the separator.  By default <u>P</u> is "qr/:/".

   <b>"$RE{net}{MAC}{hex}{-sep}"</b>
       Returns  a pattern that matches a valid MAC address as colon separated hexadecimals, with the letters "a"
       to "f" in lower case.

       If "-sep=<u>P</u>" is specified the pattern <u>P</u> is used as the separator.  By default <u>P</u> is "qr/:/".

   <b>"$RE{net}{MAC}{oct}{-sep}"</b>
       Returns a pattern that matches a valid MAC address as colon separated octals.

       If "-sep=<u>P</u>" is specified the pattern <u>P</u> is used as the separator.  By default <u>P</u> is "qr/:/".

   <b>"$RE{net}{MAC}{bin}{-sep}"</b>
       Returns a pattern that matches a valid MAC address as colon separated binary numbers.

       If "-sep=<u>P</u>" is specified the pattern <u>P</u> is used as the separator.  By default <u>P</u> is "qr/:/".

   <b>"$RE{net}{IPv6}{-sep</b> <b>=&gt;</b> <b>':'}{-style</b> <b>=&gt;</b> <b>'HeX'}"</b>
       Returns a pattern matching IPv6 numbers. An IPv6 address consists of eight  groups  of  four  hexadecimal
       digits,  separated by colons. In each group, leading zeros may be omitted. Two or more consecutive groups
       consisting of only zeros may be omitted (including any colons separating them), resulting into  two  sets
       of groups, separated by a double colon.  (Each of the groups may be empty; "::" is a valid address, equal
       to "0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000"). The hex numbers may be in either case.

       If the "-sep" option is used, its argument is a pattern that matches the separator that separates groups.
       This  defaults  to  ":".  The  "-style"  option is used to denote which case the hex numbers may be.  The
       default style, 'HeX' indicates both lower case letters 'a' to 'f' and upper case letters 'A' to 'F'  will
       be  matched.  The style 'HEX' restricts matching to upper case letters, and 'hex' only matches lower case
       letters.

       If "{-keep}" is used, $1 to $9 will be set. $1 will be set to the matched address, while $2 to $9 will be
       set to each matched group. If a group is omitted because it contains all  zeros,  its  matching  variable
       will be the empty string.

       Example:

         "2001:db8:85a3::8a2e:370:7334" =~ /$RE{net}{IPv6}{-keep}/;
         print $2;    # '2001'
         print $4;    # '85a3'
         print $6;    # Empty string
         print $8;    # '370'

       Perl 5.10 (or later) is required for this pattern.

   <b>"$RE{net}{domain}"</b>
       Returns  a  pattern  to match domains (and hosts) as defined in RFC 1035.  Under I{-keep} only the entire
       domain name is returned.

       RFC 1035 says that a single space can be a domainname too. So, the pattern returned by "$RE{net}{domain}"
       recognizes a single space as well. This is not  always  what  people  want.  If  you  want  to  recognize
       domainnames, but not a space, you can do one of two things, either use

           /(?! )$RE{net}{domain}/

       or use the "{-nospace}" option (without an argument).

       RFC 1035 does <b>not</b> allow host or domain names to start with a digits; however, this restriction is relaxed
       in  RFC 1101; this RFC allows host and domain names to start with a digit, as long as the first part of a
       domain does not look like an IP address. If the "{-rfc1101}" option is given (as in "$RE  {net}  {domain}
       {-rfc1101}"), we will match using the relaxed rules.
