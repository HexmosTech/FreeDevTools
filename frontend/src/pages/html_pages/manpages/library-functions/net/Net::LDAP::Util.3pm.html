       Net::LDAP::Util - Utility functions

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Net::LDAP::Util qw(ldap_error_text
                                ldap_error_name
                                ldap_error_desc

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Net::LDAP::Util</b> is a collection of utility functions for use with the Net::LDAP modules.

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       ldap_error_name ( ERR )
           Returns   the  name  corresponding  with  ERR.  ERR  can  either  be  an  LDAP  error  number,  or  a
           "Net::LDAP::Message" object containing an error code. If the error is not known the a string  in  the
           form "LDAP error code %d(0x%02X)" is returned.

       ldap_error_text ( ERR )
           Returns  the text from the POD description for the given error. ERR can either be an LDAP error code,
           or a "Net::LDAP::Message" object containing an LDAP error code. If the error code  given  is  unknown
           then "undef" is returned.

       ldap_error_desc ( ERR )
           Returns  a  short  text  description  of  the  error.  ERR  can  either  be  an  LDAP error code or a
           "Net::LDAP::Message" object containing an LDAP error code.

       canonical_dn ( DN [ , OPTIONS ] )
           Returns the given <b>DN</b> in a canonical form. Returns undef if <b>DN</b> is  not  a  valid  Distinguished  Name.
           (Note:  The  empty  string  "" is a valid DN.)  <b>DN</b> can either be a string or reference to an array of
           hashes as returned by ldap_explode_dn, which is useful when constructing a DN.

           It performs the following operations on the given <b>DN</b>:

           •   Removes the leading 'OID.' characters if the type is an OID instead of a name.

           •   Escapes all RFC 4514 special characters (",", "+", """, "\", "&lt;",  "&gt;",  ";",  "#",  "=",  "  "),
               slashes ("/"), and any other character where the ASCII code is &lt; 32 as \hexpair.

           •   Converts all leading and trailing spaces in values to be \20.

           •   If  an RDN contains multiple parts, the parts are re-ordered so that the attribute type names are
               in alphabetical order.

           <b>OPTIONS</b> is a list of name/value pairs, valid options are:

           casefold
               Controls case folding of attribute type names. Attribute values are not affected by this  option.
               The default is to uppercase. Valid values are:

               lower
                   Lowercase attribute type names.

               upper
                   Uppercase attribute type names. This is the default.

               none
                   Do not change attribute type names.

           mbcescape
               If  TRUE,  characters  that  are  encoded  as  a  multi-octet  UTF-8  sequence will be escaped as
               \(hexpair){2,*}.

           reverse
               If TRUE, the RDN sequence is reversed.

           separator
               Separator to use between RDNs. Defaults to comma (',').

       ldap_explode_dn ( DN [ , OPTIONS ] )
           Explodes the given <b>DN</b> into an array of hashes and returns a reference to this array. Returns undef if
           <b>DN</b> is not a valid Distinguished Name.

           A Distinguished Name is a sequence of Relative Distinguished Names (RDNs), which themselves are  sets
           of  Attributes.  For  each  RDN  a  hash is constructed with the attribute type names as keys and the
           attribute values as corresponding values.  These hashes are then stored in an array in the  order  in
           which they appear in the DN.

           For example, the DN 'OU=Sales+CN=J. Smith,DC=example,DC=net' is exploded to:
            [
              {
                'OU' =&gt; 'Sales',
                'CN' =&gt; 'J. Smith'
              },
              {
                'DC' =&gt; 'example'
              },
              {
                'DC' =&gt; 'net'
              }
            ]

           (RFC4514  string) DNs might also contain values, which are the bytes of the BER encoding of the X.500
           AttributeValue rather than some LDAP string syntax.  These values are hex-encoded and prefixed with a
           #. To distinguish such BER values,  ldap_explode_dn  uses  references  to  the  actual  values,  e.g.
           '1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.0=#04024869,DC=example,DC=com' is exploded to:
            [
              {
                '1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.0' =&gt; "\004\002Hi"
              },
              {
                'DC' =&gt; 'example'
              },
              {
                'DC' =&gt; 'com'
              }
            ];

           It also performs the following operations on the given DN:

           •   Unescape  "\"  followed  by  ",",  "+",  """, "\", "&lt;", "&gt;", ";", "#", "=", " ", or a hexpair and
               strings beginning with "#".

           •   Removes the leading 'OID.' characters if the type is an OID instead of a name.

           <b>OPTIONS</b> is a list of name/value pairs, valid options are:

           casefold
               Controls case folding of attribute types names. Attribute values are not affected by this option.
               The default is to uppercase. Valid values are:

               lower
                   Lowercase attribute types names.

               upper
                   Uppercase attribute type names. This is the default.

               none
                   Do not change attribute type names.

           reverse
               If TRUE, the RDN sequence is reversed.

       escape_filter_value ( VALUES )
           Escapes the given <b>VALUES</b> according to RFC 4515 so that they can be safely used in LDAP filters.

           Any control characters with an ASCII code &lt; 32 as well as the characters with special meaning in LDAP
           filters "*", "(", ")", and "\" the backslash are converted into the  representation  of  a  backslash
           followed by two hex digits representing the hexadecimal value of the character.

           Returns the converted list in list mode and the first element in scalar mode.

       unescape_filter_value ( VALUES )
           Undoes the conversion done by <b>escape_filter_value()</b>.

           Converts any sequences of a backslash followed by two hex digits into the corresponding character.

           Returns the converted list in list mode and the first element in scalar mode.

       escape_dn_value ( VALUES )
           Escapes the given <b>VALUES</b> according to RFC 4514 so that they can be safely used in LDAP DNs.

           The  characters  ",", "+", """, "\", "&lt;", "&gt;", ";", "#", "=" with a special meaning in section 2.4 of
           RFC 4514 are preceded by a backslash.  Control characters with an ASCII code &lt; 32 are represented  as
           \hexpair.  Finally all leading and trailing spaces are converted to sequences of \20.

           Returns the converted list in list mode and the first element in scalar mode.

       unescape_dn_value ( VALUES )
           Undoes the conversion done by <b>escape_dn_value()</b>.

           Any  escape  sequence  starting with a backslash - hexpair or special character - will be transformed
           back to the corresponding character.

           Returns the converted list in list mode and the first element in scalar mode.

       ldap_url_parse ( LDAP-URL [, OPTIONS ] )
           Parse an <b>LDAP-URL</b> conforming to RFC 4516 into a hash containing its elements.

           For easy cooperation with LDAP queries, the hash keys for the elements used in LDAP search operations
           are named after the parameters to "search" in Net::LDAP.

           In extension to RFC 4516, the socket path for URLs with the scheme "ldapi" will be stored in the hash
           key named "path".

           If any element is omitted, the result depends on the setting of the option "defaults".

           <b>OPTIONS</b> is a list of key/value pairs with the following keys recognized:

           defaults
               A Boolean option that determines whether default values according to RFC 4516 shall  be  returned
               for missing URL elements.

               If  set  to TRUE, default values are returned, with "ldap_url_parse" using the following defaults
               in extension to RFC 4516.

               •   The default port for "ldaps" URLs is 636.

               •   The default path for "ldapi" URLs is the contents of the environment  variable  "LDAPI_SOCK".
                   If that is not defined or empty, then "/var/run/ldapi" is used.

                   This is consistent with the behaviour of "new" in Net::LDAP.

               •   The default "host" name for "ldap" and "ldaps" URLs is "localhost".

               When set to FALSE, no default values are used.

               This  leaves  all  keys  in  the  resulting hash undefined where the corresponding URL element is
               empty.

               To distinguish between an empty base DN and an undefined base DN, "ldap_url_parse" uses the slash
               between the host:port resp. path part of the URL and the base DN part of the URL.  With the slash
               present, the hash key "base" is set to the empty string, without it, it is left undefined.

               Leaving away the "defaults" option entirely is equivalent to setting it to TRUE.

           Returns the hash in list mode, or the reference to the hash in scalar mode.

       generalizedTime_to_time ( GENERALIZEDTIME )
           Convert the  generalizedTime  string  <b>GENERALIZEDTIME</b>,  which  is  expected  to  match  the  template
           "YYYYmmddHH[MM[SS]][(./,)d...](Z|(+/-)HH[MM])"  to  a floating point number compatible with UNIX time
           (i.e. the integral part of the number is a UNIX time).

           Returns an extended UNIX time or "undef" on error.

           Times in years smaller than 1000 will lead to "undef" being returned.  This restriction is  a  direct
           effect of the year value interpretation rules in Time::Local.

           <b>Note:</b> this function depends on Perl's implementation of time and Time::Local.  See "Limits of time_t"
           in  Time::Local, "Negative Epoch Values" in Time::Local, and "gmtime" in perlport for restrictions in
           older versions of Perl.

       time_to_generalizedTime ( TIME [, OPTIONS ] )
           Convert the UNIX time <b>TIME</b> to a generalizedTime string.

           In extension to UNIX times, <b>TIME</b> may be a floating point number, the decimal part will  be  used  for
           the resulting generalizedTime.

           <b>OPTIONS</b> is a list of key/value pairs. The following keys are recognized:

           AD  Take care of an ActiveDirectory peculiarity to always require decimals.

           Returns the generalizedTime string, or "undef" on error.

           Times  before  BC  or  after  year  9999  result  in  "undef"  as  they  cannot be represented in the
           generalizedTime format.

           <b>Note:</b> this function  depends  on  Perl's  implementation  of  gmtime.   See  "Limits  of  time_t"  in
           Time::Local,  "Negative  Epoch  Values"  in Time::Local, and "gmtime" in perlport for restrictions in
           older versions of Perl.
