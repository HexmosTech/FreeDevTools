</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The "Net::HTTP" class is a low-level HTTP client.  An instance of the "Net::HTTP" class represents a
       connection to an HTTP server.  The HTTP protocol is described in RFC 2616.  The "Net::HTTP" class
       supports "HTTP/1.0" and "HTTP/1.1".

       "Net::HTTP" is a sub-class of one of "IO::Socket::IP" (IPv6+IPv4), "IO::Socket::INET6" (IPv6+IPv4), or
       "IO::Socket::INET" (IPv4 only).  You can mix the methods described below with reading and writing from
       the socket directly.  This is not necessary a good idea, unless you know what you are doing.

       The following methods are provided (in addition to those of "IO::Socket::INET"):

       "$s = Net::HTTP-&gt;new( %options )"
           The "Net::HTTP" constructor method takes the same options as "IO::Socket::INET"'s as well as these:

             Host:            Initial host attribute value
             KeepAlive:       Initial keep_alive attribute value
             SendTE:          Initial send_te attribute_value
             HTTPVersion:     Initial http_version attribute value
             PeerHTTPVersion: Initial peer_http_version attribute value
             MaxLineLength:   Initial max_line_length attribute value
             MaxHeaderLines:  Initial max_header_lines attribute value

           The  "Host"  option is also the default for "IO::Socket::INET"'s "PeerAddr".  The "PeerPort" defaults
           to 80 if not provided.  The "PeerPort" specification can  also  be  embedded  in  the  "PeerAddr"  by
           preceding   it   with   a  ":",  and  closing  the  IPv6  address  on  brackets  "[]"  if  necessary:
           "192.0.2.1:80","[2001:db8::1]:80","any.example.com:80".

           The "Listen" option provided by "IO::Socket::INET"'s constructor method is not allowed.

           If unable to connect to the given HTTP server then the constructor returns "undef"  and  $@  contains
           the reason.  After a successful connect, a "Net:HTTP" object is returned.

       "$s-&gt;host"
           Get/set the default value of the "Host" header to send.  The $host must not be set to an empty string
           (or "undef") for HTTP/1.1.

       "$s-&gt;keep_alive"
           Get/set  the  <u>keep-alive</u>  value.   If  this  value is TRUE then the request will be sent with headers
           indicating that the server should try to keep the connection open so that multiple  requests  can  be
           sent.

           The  actual  headers  set  will  depend  on  the  value of the "http_version" and "peer_http_version"
           attributes.

       "$s-&gt;send_te"
           Get/set the a value indicating if the request will be  sent  with  a  "TE"  header  to  indicate  the
           transfer encodings that the server can choose to use.  The list of encodings announced as accepted by
           this  client depends on availability of the following modules: "Compress::Raw::Zlib" for <u>deflate</u>, and
           "IO::Compress::Gunzip" for <u>gzip</u>.

       "$s-&gt;http_version"
           Get/set the HTTP version number that this client should announce.  This value  can  only  be  set  to
           "1.0" or "1.1".  The default is "1.1".

       "$s-&gt;peer_http_version"
           Get/set  the  protocol  version  number of our peer.  This value will initially be "1.0", but will be
           updated by a successful <b>read_response_headers()</b> method call.

       "$s-&gt;max_line_length"
           Get/set a limit on the length of response line and response header lines.  The default  is  8192.   A
           value of 0 means no limit.

       "$s-&gt;max_header_length"
           Get/set a limit on the number of header lines that a response can have.  The default is 128.  A value
           of 0 means no limit.

       "$s-&gt;format_request($method, $uri, %headers, [$content])"
           Format  a  request message and return it as a string.  If the headers do not include a "Host" header,
           then a header is inserted with the value of the "host"  attribute.   Headers  like  "Connection"  and
           "Keep-Alive" might also be added depending on the status of the "keep_alive" attribute.

           If  $content  is  given  (and it is non-empty), then a "Content-Length" header is automatically added
           unless it was already present.

       "$s-&gt;write_request($method, $uri, %headers, [$content])"
           Format and send a request message.  Arguments are the same as for <b>format_request()</b>.  Returns true  if
           successful.

       "$s-&gt;format_chunk( $data )"
           Returns the string to be written for the given chunk of data.

       "$s-&gt;write_chunk($data)"
           Will  write  a  new  chunk  of  request  entity  body  data.   This method should only be used if the
           "Transfer-Encoding" header with a value of "chunked" was sent in the request.   Note,  writing  zero-
           length data is a no-op.  Use the <b>write_chunk_eof()</b> method to signal end of entity body data.

           Returns true if successful.

       "$s-&gt;format_chunk_eof( %trailers )"
           Returns the string to be written for signaling EOF when a "Transfer-Encoding" of "chunked" is used.

       "$s-&gt;write_chunk_eof( %trailers )"
           Will  write  eof marker for chunked data and optional trailers.  Note that trailers should not really
           be used unless is was signaled with a "Trailer" header.

           Returns true if successful.

       "($code, $mess, %headers) = $s-&gt;read_response_headers( %opts )"
           Read response headers from server and return it.  The $code is the 3  digit  HTTP  status  code  (see
           HTTP::Status)  and  $mess  is  the  textual  message that came with it.  Headers are then returned as
           key/value pairs.  Since key letter casing is not normalized and the same key can even occur  multiple
           times,  assigning  these  values  directly to a hash is not wise.  Only the $code is returned if this
           method is called in scalar context.

           As a side effect this method updates the 'peer_http_version' attribute.

           Options might be passed in as key/value pairs.  There  are  currently  only  two  options  supported;
           "laxed" and "junk_out".

           The  "laxed"  option  will  make <b>read_response_headers()</b> more forgiving towards servers that have not
           learned how to speak HTTP properly.  The "laxed" option is a boolean flag, and is enabled by  passing
           in  a  TRUE  value.   The  "junk_out"  option can be used to capture bad header lines when "laxed" is
           enabled.  The value should be an array reference.  Bad header lines will be pushed onto the array.

           The "laxed" option must be specified in order to communicate with  pre-HTTP/1.0  servers  that  don't
           describe  the  response  outcome  or  the data they send back with a header block.  For these servers
           peer_http_version is set to "0.9" and this method returns (200, "Assumed OK").

           The method will raise an exception (die) if  the  server  does  not  speak  proper  HTTP  or  if  the
           "max_line_length"  or "max_header_length" limits are reached.  If the "laxed" option is turned on and
           "max_line_length" and "max_header_length" checks are turned off, then no exception will be raised and
           this method will always return a response code.

       "$n = $s-&gt;read_entity_body($buf, $size);"
           Reads chunks of the entity body content.  Basically the same interface as for <b>read()</b>  and  <b>sysread()</b>,
           but  the  buffer  offset  argument  is  not supported yet.  This method should only be called after a
           successful <b>read_response_headers()</b> call.

           The return value will be "undef" on read errors, 0 on EOF, -1 if no data could be returned this time,
           otherwise the number of bytes assigned to $buf.  The $buf is set to "" when the return value is -1.

           You normally want to retry this call if this function returns either -1 or "undef" with $!  as  EINTR
           or  EAGAIN (see Errno).  EINTR can happen if the application catches signals and EAGAIN can happen if
           you made the socket non-blocking.

           This method will raise exceptions (die) if the server does not speak  proper  HTTP.   This  can  only
           happen when reading chunked data.

       "%headers = $s-&gt;get_trailers"
           After  <b>read_entity_body()</b>  has  returned  0  to  indicate end of the entity body, you might call this
           method to pick up any trailers.

       "$s-&gt;_rbuf"
           Get/set the read buffer content.  The <b>read_response_headers()</b> and <b>read_entity_body()</b> methods  use  an
           internal  buffer  which  they  will  look  for data before they actually sysread more from the socket
           itself.  If they read too much, the remaining data will be left in this buffer.

       "$s-&gt;_rbuf_length"
           Returns the number of bytes in the read buffer.  This should always be the same as:

               length($s-&gt;_rbuf)

           but might be more efficient.

</pre><h4><b>SUBCLASSING</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>read_response_headers()</b> and <b>read_entity_body()</b> will invoke the <b>sysread()</b> method when they  need  more
       data.  Subclasses might want to override this method to control how reading takes place.

       The  object  itself  is  a  glob.  Subclasses should avoid using hash key names prefixed with "http_" and
       "io_".
