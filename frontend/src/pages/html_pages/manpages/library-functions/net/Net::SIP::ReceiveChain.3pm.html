       Net::SIP::ReceiveChain - handle incoming packet by multiple receivers

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         # create proxy which works as a registrar too, but
         # all register requests should be authorized

         my $registrar = Net::SIP::Registrar-&gt;new...
         my $auth = Net::SIP::Authorize-&gt;new ....
         my $reg_chain = Net::SIP::ReceiveChain-&gt;new(
               [ $auth,$registrar ],
               methods =&gt; [ 'REGISTER' ],
         );

         my $proxy = Net::SIP::StatelessProxy-&gt;new...
         my $chain = Net::SIP::ReceiveChain-&gt;new(
               [ $registrar,$proxy ]
         );

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This package is used to handle incoming packets by multiple receivers, e.g. make sure that requests for
       Net::SIP::Registrar will be authorized by Net::SIP::Authorize.

       Objects in the chain might be Net::SIP::Registrar, Net::SIP::StatelessProxy, Net::SIP::Authorize,
       Net::SIP::ReceiveChain itself and every other object which handles "receive" like described below.

</pre><h4><b>CONSTRUCTOR</b></h4><pre>
       new ( OBJECTS, %ARGS )
           This  creates  a  new registar object, OBJECTS is a reference to an array of objects implementing the
           "receive" method.

           %ARGS can have the following keys:

           filter  A callback which gets called during "receive" with all arguments of the method. If it returns
                   TRUE the packet will be handled by the chain, otherwise not.

           methods If <b>filter</b> is not given but <b>methods</b> is it will set <b>filter</b> to a callback which accepts only the
                   methods specified in the array reference given to <b>methods</b>.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       receive ( PACKET,LEG,FROM )
           PACKET is the incoming packet, LEG is the Net::SIP::Leg where the packet  arrived  and  FROM  is  the
           "ip:port" of the sender. Responses will be send back to the sender through the same leg.

           Called from the managing Net::SIP::Dispatcher object if a new packet arrives.

           Returns TRUE if the packet was fully handled by one of the objects in the chain, else FALSE:

           •       If  a  filter  was given checks the packet against the filter and returns FALSE if the filter
                   does return FALSE.

           •       Otherwise it will call "receive" on all objects in the chain until one of these returns TRUE.
                   In this case it will return TRUE.

           •       If no object in the chain handled the packet it will return FALSE.
