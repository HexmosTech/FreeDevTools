</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Net::Twitter::Role::RateLimit - Rate limit features for Net::Twitter

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 4.01043

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Net::Twitter;
           my $nt = Net::Twitter-&gt;new(
               traits =&gt; [qw/API::REST RateLimit/],
               %other_options,
           );

           #...later

           sleep $nt-&gt;until_rate(1.0) || $minimum_wait;

</pre><h4><b>NOTE!</b></h4><pre>
       RateLimit only works with Twitter API v1. The rate limiting strategy of Twitter API v1.1 is very
       different. A v1.1 compatible RateLimit role may be coming, but isn't available, yet. It's interface will
       necessarily be different.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This provides utility methods that return information about the current rate limit status.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       If current rate limit data is not resident, these methods will force a call to "rate_limit_status".
       Therefore, any of these methods can throw an error.

       rate_remaining
           Returns the number of API calls available before the next reset.

       rate_reset
           Returns the Unix epoch time of the next reset.

       rate_limit
           Returns the current hourly rate limit.

       rate_ratio
           Returns  remaining API call limit, divided by the time remaining before the next reset, as a ratio of
           the total rate limit per hour.

           For example, if "rate_limit" is 150, the total rate is 150 API calls per hour.   If  "rate_remaining"
           is  75,  and there 1800 seconds (1/2 hour) remaining before the next reset, "rate_ratio" returns 1.0,
           because there are exactly enough API calls remaining to maintain he full rate of 150 calls per hour.

           If "rate_remaining" is 30 and there are 360 seconds remaining before reset, "rate_ratio" returns 2.0,
           because there are enough API calls remaining to maintain twice the full rate of 150 calls per hour.

           As a final example, if "rate_remaining" is 15, and there are 7200  seconds  remaining  before  reset,
           "rate_ratio" returns 0.5, because there are only enough API calls remaining to maintain half the full
           rate of 150 calls per hour.

       until_rate($target_ratio)
           Returns  the  number  of  seconds  to  wait  before  making  another  rate limited API call such that
           $target_ratio of the full rate would be available.  It always returns a number greater than, or equal
           to zero.

           Use a target rate of 1.0 in a timeline polling loop to get a  steady  polling  rate,  using  all  the
           allocated calls, and adjusted for other API calls as they occur.

           Use  a  target rate &lt; 1.0 to allow a process to make calls as fast as possible but not consume all of
           the calls available, too soon.  For example, if you have a process building a large social graph, you
           may want to allow it make as many calls as possible, with no wait, until 20% of  the  available  rate
           remains.  Use a value of 0.2 for that purpose.

           A  target rate &gt; than 1.0 can be used for a process that should only use "extra" available API calls.
           This is useful for an application that requires most of it's rate limit for normal operation.
