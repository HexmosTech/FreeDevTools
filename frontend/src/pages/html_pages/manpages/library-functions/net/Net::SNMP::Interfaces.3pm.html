       Net::SNMP::Interfaces - provide simple methods to gain interface data via

       SNMP

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Net::SNMP::Interfaces;

           my $interfaces = Net::SNMP::Interfaces-&gt;new(Hostname =&gt; 'localhost',
                                                       Community =&gt; 'public' );

           my @ifnames = $interfaces-&gt;all_interfaces();

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Net::SNMP::Interfaces aims to provide simple object methods to obtain information about a host's network
       interfaces ( be it a server a router or whatever ).  The motivation was largely to allow a programmer to
       use SNMP to obtain this information without needing to know a great deal about the gory details.

       The module uses Net::SNMP under the hood to do the dirty work although the user shouldn't have to worry
       about that ( the Net::SNMP object is available though for those who might feel the need ).

       The actual details for a particular interface are obtained from the methods of
       Net::SNMP::Interfaces::Details - objects of which type can be obtained for the methods <b>all_interfaces()</b>
       and <b>interface()</b>.

       Of course the simpler interface has its limitations and there may well be things that you would like to
       do which you cant do with this module - in which case I would recommend that you get a good book on SNMP
       and use Net::SNMP :)

       The module uses blocking SNMP requests at the current time so if some of the methods are taking too long
       you may want to time them out yourself using <b>alarm()</b>.

   <b>METHODS</b>
       new(  HASH %args )
           The constructor of the class. It takes several arguments that are passed to Net::SNMP :

           Hostname
               The name of the host which you want to connect to. Defaults to 'localhost'.

           Community
               The SNMP community string which you want to use for this session.  The default is 'public'.

           Port
               The UDP port that the SNMP service is listening on.  The default is 161.

           Version
               The  SNMP  version  (as  described  in  the  Net::SNMP documentation) to be used.  The default is
               'snmpv1'.  Support for SNMPv3 is currently somewhat limited.

           There is a also an optional argument 'RaiseError' which determines the behaviour of the module in the
           event there is an error while creating the SNMP.  Normally <b>new()</b> will return undef if  there  was  an
           error but if RaiseError is set to a true value it will <b>die()</b> printing the error string to STDERR.  If
           this   is   not   set   and   an   error   occurs   undef   will   be   return   and   the   variable
           $Net::SNMP::Interfaces::error will contain the test of the error.

           Because the interfaces are discovered in the constructor, if the module is  to  be  used  in  a  long
           running  program  to monitor a host where interfaces might be added or removed it is recommended that
           the object returned by <b>new()</b> is periodically destroyed and a new one constructed.

       <b>if_names()</b>
           Returns a list of the interface names.

       <b>if_indices()</b>
           Returns a list of the indices of the interfaces - this probably shouldn't be necessary  but  is  here
           for completeness anyway.  If you don't know what the index is for you are safe to ignore this.

       <b>error()</b>
           Returns  the  text  of the last Net::SNMP error.  This method only makes sense if the previous method
           call indicated an error by a false return.

       <b>session()</b>
           Returns the Net::SNMP session object for this instance. Or a false value if there is no open session.
           This might be used to call methods on the Net::SNMP object if some  facility  is  needed  that  isn't
           supplied by this module.

       <b>all_interfaces()</b>
           Returns a list of Net::SNMP::Interface::Details objects corresponding to the interfaces discovered on
           this host.  In scalar context it will return a reference to an array.

       interface( SCALAR $name )
           Returns  a  Net::SNMP::Interfaces::Details  object  for  the  named  interface.  Returns undef if the
           supplied name is not a known interface.

       In addition to the methods above, you can also use the methods  from  Net::SNMP::Interfaces::Details  but
       with the addition of the interface name as an argument. e.g:

             $in_octs = $self-&gt;ifInOctets('eth0');

       Please see the documentation for Net::SNMP::Interfaces::Details for more on these methods.
