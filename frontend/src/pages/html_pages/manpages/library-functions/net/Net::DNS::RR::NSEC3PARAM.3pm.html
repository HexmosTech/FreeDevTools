</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Net::DNS::RR::NSEC3PARAM - DNS NSEC3PARAM resource record

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
               use Net::DNS;
               $rr = Net::DNS::RR-&gt;new('name NSEC3PARAM algorithm flags iterations salt');

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Class for DNSSEC NSEC3PARAM resource records.

       The NSEC3PARAM RR contains the NSEC3 parameters (hash algorithm, flags, iterations and salt) needed to
       calculate hashed ownernames.

       The presence of an NSEC3PARAM RR at a zone apex indicates that the specified parameters may be used by
       authoritative servers to choose an appropriate set of NSEC3 records for negative responses.

       The NSEC3PARAM RR is not used by validators or resolvers.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       The available methods are those inherited from the base class augmented by the type-specific methods
       defined in this package.

       Use of undocumented package features or direct access to internal data structures is discouraged and
       could result in program termination or other unpredictable behaviour.

   <b>algorithm</b>
               $algorithm = $rr-&gt;algorithm;
               $rr-&gt;algorithm( $algorithm );

       The 8-bit algorithm field is represented as an unsigned decimal integer.

   <b>flags</b>
               $flags = $rr-&gt;flags;
               $rr-&gt;flags( $flags );

       The Flags field is an unsigned decimal integer interpreted as eight concatenated Boolean values.

   <b>iterations</b>
               $iterations = $rr-&gt;iterations;
               $rr-&gt;iterations( $iterations );

       The Iterations field is represented as an unsigned decimal integer.  The value is between 0 and 65535,
       inclusive.

   <b>salt</b>
               $salt = $rr-&gt;salt;
               $rr-&gt;salt( $salt );

       The Salt field is represented as a contiguous sequence of hexadecimal digits. A "-" (unquoted) is used in
       string format to indicate that the salt field is absent.

   <b>saltbin</b>
               $saltbin = $rr-&gt;saltbin;
               $rr-&gt;saltbin( $saltbin );

       The Salt field as a sequence of octets.
