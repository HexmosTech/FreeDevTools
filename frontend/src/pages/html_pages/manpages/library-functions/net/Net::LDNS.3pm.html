</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
           Net::LDNS - DNS-talking module based on the ldns C library

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           my $resolver = Net::LDNS-&gt;new('8.8.8.8');
           my $packet   = $resolver-&gt;query('www.iis.se');
           say $packet-&gt;string;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       "Net::LDNS" represents a resolver, which is the part of the system responsible for sending queries and
       receiving answers to them.

</pre><h4><b>EXPORTABLE</b> <b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>lib_version()</b>
           Returns the ldns version string. Can be exported, but is not by default.

       to_idn($name, ...)
           Takes  a  number  of  strings  and returns a list of them converted to IDNA format.  Assumes that the
           strings have been converted to Perl's internal encoding before it's called. Can be exported,  but  is
           not by default.

           This  function  requires  that  GNU  libidn  was present when Net::LDNS was compiled. If not, calling
           "to_idn" will result in an exception getting thrown.

       <b>has_idn()</b>
           Takes no arguments. Returns true if libidn was present at compilation, false if not.

       <b>has_gost()</b>
           Takes no arguments. Returns true if GOST support was present at compilation, false if not.

       load_zonefile($filename)
           Load all resource records in a zone file, returning them as a list.

</pre><h4><b>CLASS</b> <b>METHOD</b></h4><pre>
       new($addr,...)
           Creates a new resolver object. If given no arguments, if will pick up nameserver addresses  from  the
           system configuration (<u><a href="file:/etc/resolv.conf">/etc/resolv.conf</a></u> or equivalent). If given a single argument that is "undef", it
           will not know of any nameservers and all attempts to send queries will throw exceptions. If given one
           or  more  arguments  that  are not "undef", attempts to parse them as IPv4 and IPv6 addresses will be
           made, and if successful make up a list of servers to send queries to. If an argument cannot be parsed
           as an IP address, an exception will be thrown.

</pre><h4><b>INSTANCE</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       query($name, $type, $class)
           Send a query for the given triple. If type or class are not  provided  they  default  to  A  and  IN,
           respectively. Returns a Net::LDNS::Packet or undef.

       name2addr($name)
           Asks  this  resolver  to  look  up A and AAAA records for the given name, and return a list of the IP
           addresses (as strings). In scalar context, returns the number of addresses found.

       addr2name($addr)
           Takes an IP address, asks the resolver to do PTR lookups and  returns  the  names  found.  In  scalar
           context, returns the number of names found.

       recurse($flag)
           Returns  the setting of the recursion flag. If given an argument, it will be treated as a boolean and
           the flag set accordingly.

       debug($flag)
           Gets and optionally sets the debug flag.

       dnssec($flag)
           Get and optionally sets the DNSSEC flag.

       cd($flag)
           Get and optionally sets the CD flag.

       igntc($flag)
           Get and optionally sets the igntc flag.

       usevc($flag)
           Get and optionally sets the usevc flag.

       retry($count)
           Get and optionally set the number of retries.

       retrans($seconds)
           Get and optionally set the number of seconds between retries.

       port($port)
           Get and optionally set the destination port for requests.

       edns_size($size)
           Get and optionally set the EDNS0 UDP maximum size.

       axfr( $domain, $callback, $class )
           Perform an AXFR operation. $callback must be a code reference, which will be called  once  for  every
           received  resource record with the RR object as its one and only argument. After every such call, the
           return value of the callback will be examined, and if the value is false the  AXFR  process  will  be
           aborted.  The  return  value  of  the  axfr()  method  itself  will be true if the transfer completed
           normally, and false if it was aborted because the callback returned a false value.

           If anything goes wrong during the process, an exception will be thrown.

           As an example, saving all the RRs received from an AXFR can be done like this:

               my @rrs;
               $resolver-&gt;axfr( $domain, sub { my ($rr) = @_; push @rrs, $rr; return 1;} );

       axfr_start($domain,$class)
           Deprecated. Use <b>axfr()</b> instead.

           Set this resolver object up for a zone transfer of the specified domain. If $class is not  given,  it
           defaults to IN.

       <b>axfr_next()</b>
           Deprecated. Use <b>axfr()</b> instead.

           Get  the  next  RR  in the zone transfer. <b>axfr_start()</b> must have been done before this is called, and
           after this is called <b>axfr_complete()</b> should be used to check if there are more  records  to  get.  If
           there's any problem, an exception will be thrown. Basically, the sequence should be something like:

               $res-&gt;axfr_start('example.org');
               do {
                   push @rrlist, $res-&gt;axfr_next;
               } until $res-&gt;axfr_complete;

       <b>axfr_complete()</b>
           Deprecated. Use <b>axfr()</b> instead.

           Returns  false  if there is a started zone transfer with more records to get, and true if the started
           transfer has completed.

       <b>axfr_last_packet()</b>
           Deprecated. Use <b>axfr()</b> instead.

           If <b>axfr_next()</b> threw an exception, this method returns the Net::LDNS::Packet that made it do so.  The
           packet's RCODE is likely to say what the problem was (for example, NOTAUTH or NXDOMAIN).

       timeout($time)
           Get and/or set the socket timeout for the resolver.

       source($addr)
           Get and/or set the IP address the resolver should try to send its queries from.
