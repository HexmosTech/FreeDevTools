</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       tcgetattr — get the parameters associated with the terminal

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/termios.h">termios.h</a>&gt;

       int tcgetattr(int <u>fildes</u>, struct termios *<u>termios_p</u>);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>tcgetattr</u>() function shall get the parameters associated with the terminal referred to by <u>fildes</u> and
       store them in the <b>termios</b> structure referenced by  <u>termios_p</u>.   The  <u>fildes</u>  argument  is  an  open  file
       descriptor associated with a terminal.

       The <u>termios_p</u> argument is a pointer to a <b>termios</b> structure.

       The <u>tcgetattr</u>() operation is allowed from any process.

       If  the  terminal  device  supports  different  input and output baud rates, the baud rates stored in the
       <b>termios</b> structure returned by <u>tcgetattr</u>() shall reflect the actual baud rates, even if they are equal. If
       differing baud rates are not supported, the rate returned as the output baud rate  shall  be  the  actual
       baud  rate.  If  the terminal device does not support split baud rates, the input baud rate stored in the
       <b>termios</b> structure shall be the output rate (as one of the symbolic values).

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       Upon successful completion, 0 shall be returned. Otherwise,  -1  shall  be  returned  and  <u>errno</u>  set  to
       indicate the error.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>tcgetattr</u>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EBADF</b>  The <u>fildes</u> argument is not a valid file descriptor.

       <b>ENOTTY</b> The file associated with <u>fildes</u> is not a terminal.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       Care  must  be  taken when changing the terminal attributes. Applications should always do a <u>tcgetattr</u>(),
       save the <b>termios</b> structure values returned, and then  do  a  <u>tcsetattr</u>(),  changing  only  the  necessary
       fields.  The  application  should  use  the values saved from the <u>tcgetattr</u>() to reset the terminal state
       whenever it is done with the terminal.  This is  necessary  because  terminal  attributes  apply  to  the
       underlying  port  and  not  to  each  individual open instance; that is, all processes that have used the
       terminal see the latest attribute changes.

       A program that uses these functions should be written to catch all signals  and  take  other  appropriate
       actions  to  ensure that when the program terminates, whether planned or not, the terminal device's state
       is restored to its original state.

       Existing practice dealing with error returns when only part of a request can be honored is based on calls
       to the <u>ioctl</u>() function. In historical BSD  and  System  V  implementations,  the  corresponding  <u>ioctl</u>()
       returns  zero  if  the requested actions were semantically correct, even if some of the requested changes
       could not be made. Many existing applications assume this behavior and would no longer work correctly  if
       the return value were changed from zero to -1 in this case.

       Note that either specification has a problem. When zero is returned, it implies everything succeeded even
       if  some of the changes were not made. When -1 is returned, it implies everything failed even though some
       of the changes were made.

       Applications that need all of the requested changes made to work properly should follow <u>tcsetattr</u>()  with
       a call to <u>tcgetattr</u>() and compare the appropriate field values.
