   <b>subroutine</b> <b>cpotf2</b> <b>(character</b> <b>uplo,</b> <b>integer</b> <b>n,</b> <b>complex,</b> <b>dimension(</b> <b>lda,</b> <b>*</b> <b>)</b> <b>a,</b> <b>integer</b> <b>lda,</b> <b>integer</b> <b>info)</b>
       <b>CPOTF2</b> computes the Cholesky factorization of a symmetric/Hermitian positive definite matrix (unblocked
       algorithm).

       <b>Purpose:</b>

            CPOTF2 computes the Cholesky factorization of a complex Hermitian
            positive definite matrix A.

            The factorization has the form
               A = U**H * U ,  if UPLO = 'U', or
               A = L  * L**H,  if UPLO = 'L',
            where U is an upper triangular matrix and L is lower triangular.

            This is the unblocked version of the algorithm, calling Level 2 BLAS.

                     UPLO is CHARACTER*1

                     n by n upper triangular part of A contains the upper
                     triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly lower
                     triangular part of A is not referenced.  If UPLO = 'L', the
                     leading n by n lower triangular part of A contains the lower
                     triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly upper
                     triangular part of A is not referenced.

                     factorization A = U**H *U  or A = L*L**H.

           <u>LDA</u>

                     LDA is INTEGER

                     &gt; 0: if INFO = k, the leading principal minor of order k
                          is not positive, and the factorization could not be
                          completed.
