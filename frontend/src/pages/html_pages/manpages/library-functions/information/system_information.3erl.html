       <b>sanity_check()</b> <b>-&gt;</b> <b>ok</b> <b>|</b> <b>{failed,</b> <b>Failures}</b>

              Types:

                 Application = atom()
                 ApplicationVersion = string()
                 MissingRuntimeDependencies =
                     {missing_runtime_dependencies, ApplicationVersion,
                      [ApplicationVersion]}
                 InvalidApplicationVersion =
                     {invalid_application_version, ApplicationVersion}
                 InvalidAppFile = {invalid_app_file, Application}
                 Failure =
                     MissingRuntimeDependencies | InvalidApplicationVersion |
                     InvalidAppFile
                 Failures = [Failure]

              Performs  a  sanity  check  on the system. If no issues were found, <u>ok</u> is returned. If issues were
              found, <u>{failed,</u> <u>Failures}</u> is returned. All failures found will  be  part  of  the  <u>Failures</u>  list.
              Currently defined <u>Failure</u> elements in the <u>Failures</u> list:

                <u>InvalidAppFile</u>:
                  An  application  has an invalid <u>.app</u> file. The second element identifies the application which
                  has the invalid <u>.app</u> file.

                <u>InvalidApplicationVersion</u>:
                  An application  has  an  invalid  application  version.  The  second  element  identifies  the
                  application version that is invalid.

                <u>MissingRuntimeDependencies</u>:
                  An  application is missing runtime dependencies. The second element identifies the application
                  (with version)  that  has  missing  dependencies.  The  third  element  contains  the  missing
                  dependencies.

                  Note  that  this  check use application versions that are loaded, or will be loaded when used.
                  You might have application versions that satisfies all dependencies installed in  the  system,
                  but  if  those  are  not loaded this check will fail. The system will of course also fail when
                  used like this. This may  happen  when  you  have  multiple  branched  versions  of  the  same
                  application  installed  in the system, but you do not use a boot script identifing the correct
                  application version.

              Currently the sanity check is limited to verifying runtime dependencies found in the <u>.app</u> files of
              all applications. More checks will be introduced in the future. This implies that the return  type
              <u>will</u> change in the future.

          <b>Note:</b>
              An  <u>ok</u>  return  value  only  means that <u>sanity_check/0</u> did not find any issues, <u>not</u> that no issues
              exist.

       <b>to_file(FileName)</b> <b>-&gt;</b> <b>ok</b> <b>|</b> <b>{error,</b> <b>Reason}</b>

              Types:

                 FileName = file:name_all()
                 Reason = file:posix() | badarg | terminated | system_limit

              Writes miscellaneous system information to file. This information will typically be  requested  by
              the Erlang/OTP team at Ericsson AB when reporting an issue.
