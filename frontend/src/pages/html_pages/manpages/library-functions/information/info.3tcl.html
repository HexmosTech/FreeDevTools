                     <u>commandName</u> was created by <b>interp</b> <b>alias</b>.  In a safe interpreter an alias is only visible if 2
                     both the alias and the target are visible.                                                  2

                     <u>commandName</u>  was  created  by  the  <b>Tcl_CreateObjCommand</b> interface directly without further 2
                     registration of the type of command.                                                        2

              <b>object</b>                                                                                             2
                     <u>commandName</u> is the public command that represents an instance of <b>oo::object</b> or one  of  its 2
                     subclasses.                                                                                 2

                     <u>commandName</u>  is  the  private  command,  <b>my</b>  by  default,  that  represents  an instance of 2
                     <b>oo::object</b> or one of its subclasses.                                                        2

              <b>proc</b>                                                                                               2
                     <u>commandName</u> was created by <b>proc</b>.                                                            2

                     <u>commandName</u> was created by <b>interp</b> <b>create</b>.                                                   2

              <b>zlibStream</b>                                                                                         2
                     <u>commandName</u> was created by <b>zlib</b> <b>stream</b>.                                                     2

       <b>info</b> <b>commands</b> ?<u>pattern</u>?
              Returns the names of all commands visible in the current namespace.  If <u>pattern</u> is given,  returns
              only  those  names  that match according to <b>string</b> <b>match</b>.  Only the last component of <u>pattern</u> is a
              pattern.  Other components identify a namespace.  See <b>NAMESPACE</b> <b>RESOLUTION</b> in the  <b><a href="../man3tcl/namespace.3tcl.html">namespace</a></b>(3tcl)
              documentation.

       <b>info</b> <b>complete</b> <u>command</u>
              Returns  1  if  <u>command</u>  is  a complete command, and <b>0</b> otherwise.  Typically used in line-oriented
              input environments to allow users to type in commands that span multiple lines.

       <b>info</b> <b>constant</b> <u>varName</u>
              Returns 1 if <u>varName</u> is a constant variable (see <b>const</b>) and 0 otherwise.                           2

       <b>info</b> <b>consts</b> ?<u>pattern</u>?
              Returns the list of constant variables (see <b>const</b>) in the current scope, or the list  of  constant 2
              variables matching <u>pattern</u> (if that is provided) in a manner similar to <b>info</b> <b>vars</b>.

       <b>info</b> <b>coroutine</b>
              Returns the name of the current <b>coroutine</b>, or the empty string if there is no current coroutine or
              the current coroutine has been deleted.

       <b>info</b> <b>default</b> <u>procname</u> <u>parameter</u> <u>varname</u>
              If the parameter <u>parameter</u> for the procedure named <u>procname</u> has a default value, stores that value
              in <u>varname</u> and returns <b>1</b>.  Otherwise, returns <b>0</b>.

       <b>info</b> <b>errorstack</b> ?<u>interp</u>?
              Returns  a  description  of  the  active  command  at each level for the last error in the current
              interpreter, or in the interpreter named <u>interp</u> if given.

              The description is a dictionary of tokens and parameters. Tokens are currently either <b>CALL</b>, <b>UP</b>, or
              <b>INNER</b>, but other values may be introduced in the future. <b>CALL</b> indicates a command  call,  and  its
              parameter  is the corresponding <b>info</b> <b>level</b> <b>0</b>. <b>UP</b> indicates a shift in variable frames generated by
              <b>uplevel</b> or similar, and applies to the previous <b>CALL</b> item. Its  parameter  is  the  level  offset.
              <b>INNER</b>  identifies  the  “inner  context”,  which  is  the  innermost  atomic  command  or bytecode
              instruction that raised the error, along with its arguments when  available.  While  <b>CALL</b>  and  <b>UP</b>
              provide  a  trail  of  the  call  path,  <b>INNER</b>  provides details of the offending operation in the
              innermost procedure call, even to sub-expression granularity.

              This information is also present in the <b>-errorstack</b> entry of the options  dictionary  returned  by
              3-argument <b>catch</b>; <b>info</b> <b>errorstack</b> is a convenient way of retrieving it for uncaught errors at top-
              level in an interactive <b>interpreter</b>.

       <b>info</b> <b>exists</b> <u>varName</u>
              Returns <b>1</b> if a variable named <u>varName</u> is visible and has been defined, and <b>0</b> otherwise.

       <b>info</b> <b>frame</b> ?<u>depth</u>?
              Returns  the  depth  of the call to <b>info</b> <b>frame</b> itself.  Otherwise, returns a dictionary describing
              the active command at the <u>depth</u>, which counts all commands visible to <b>info</b>  <b>level</b>,  plus  commands
              that don't create a new level, such as <b>eval</b>, <b>source</b>, or <u>uplevel</u>. The frame depth is always greater
              than the current level.

              If <u>depth</u> is greater than <b>0</b> it is the frame at that depth.  Otherwise it is the number of frames up
              from the current frame.

              As with <b>info</b> <b>level</b> and error traces, for nested commands like “foo [bar [x]]”, only “x” is seen by
              <b>info</b> <b>frame</b> invoked within “x”.

              The dictionary may contain the following keys:

              <b>type</b>   Always present.  Possible values are <b>source</b>, <b>proc</b>, <b>eval</b>, and <b>precompiled</b>.

                     <b>source</b> A script loaded via the <b>source</b> command.

                     <b>proc</b>   The  body  of  a  procedure  that could not be traced back to a line in a particular
                            script.

                     <b>eval</b>   The body of a script provided to <b>eval</b> or <b>uplevel</b>.

                     <b>precompiled</b>
                            A precompiled script (loadable by the package <b>tbcload</b>), and no  further  information
                            is available.

              <b>line</b>   The  line  number  of  of  the  command  inside  its script.  Not available for <b>precompiled</b>
                     commands.  When the type is <b>source</b>, the line number is relative to  the  beginning  of  the
                     file, whereas for the last two types it is relative to the start of the script.

              <b>file</b>   For type <b>source</b>, provides the normalized path of the file that contains the command.

              <b>cmd</b>    The command before substitutions were performed.

              <b>proc</b>   For type <b>proc</b>, the name of the procedure containing the command.

              <b>lambda</b> For  a  command  in  a  script  evaluated  as  the body of an unnamed routine via the <b>apply</b>
                     command, the definition of that routine.

              <b>level</b>  For a frame that corresponds to a level, (to be determined).

              When a command can be traced to its literal definition in some script, e.g.  procedures nested  in
              statically defined procedures, and literal eval scripts in files or statically defined procedures,
              its  type  is  <b>source</b>  and its location is the absolute line number in the script.  Otherwise, its
              type is <b>proc</b> and its location is its line number within the body of the procedure.

              In contrast, procedure definitions and <b>eval</b> within a dynamically <b>eval</b>uated environment count  line
              numbers relative to the start of their script, even if they would be able to count relative to the
              start of the outer dynamic script. That type of number usually makes more sense.

              A different way of describing this behaviour is that file-based locations are tracked as deeply as
              possible, and where this is not possible the lines are counted based on the smallest possible <b>eval</b>
              or procedure body, as that scope is usually easier to find than any dynamic outer scope.

              The  syntactic  form  <b>{*}</b>  is  handled  like <b>eval</b>. I.e. if it is given a literal list argument the
              system tracks the line number within the list words as well, and otherwise all  line  numbers  are
              counted relative to the start of each word (smallest scope)

       <b>info</b> <b>functions</b> ?<u>pattern</u>?
              If  <u>pattern</u>  is not given, returns a list of all the math functions currently defined.  If <u>pattern</u>
              is given, returns only those names that match <u>pattern</u> according to <b>string</b> <b>match</b>.

       <b>info</b> <b>globals</b> ?<u>pattern</u>?
              If <u>pattern</u> is not given, returns a list of all the names of  currently-defined  global  variables.
              Global  variables  are  variables  in the global namespace.  If <u>pattern</u> is given, only those names
              matching <u>pattern</u> are returned.  Matching is determined using the same rules as for <b>string</b> <b>match</b>.

       <b>info</b> <b>hostname</b>
              Returns the name of the current host.

              This name is not guaranteed to be the fully-qualified domain name of  the  host.   Where  machines
              have  several  different  names,  as is common on systems with both TCP/IP (DNS) and NetBIOS-based
              networking installed, it is the name that is suitable for TCP/IP networking that is returned.

       <b>info</b> <b>level</b> ?<u>level</u>?
              If <u>number</u> is not given, the level this routine was called from.  Otherwise  returns  the  complete
              command  active  at  the  given  level.   If  <u>number</u>  is  greater than <b>0</b>, it is the desired level.
              Otherwise, it is <u>number</u> levels up from the current level.  A complete command is the words in  the
              command,  with  all  substitutions  performed,  meaning  that  it is a list.  See <b>uplevel</b> for more
              information on levels.

       <b>info</b> <b>library</b>
              Returns the value of <b>tcl_library</b>, which is the name of the library directory in which the  scripts
              distributed with Tcl scripts are stored.

       <b>info</b> <b>loaded</b> ?<u>interp</u>? ?<u>prefix</u>?
              Returns the name of each file loaded in <u>interp</u> by the <b>load</b> command with prefix <u>prefix</u> .  If <u>prefix</u>
              is  not  given,  returns  a list where each item is the name of the loaded file and the prefix for
              which the file was loaded.  For a statically-loaded package the name of  the  file  is  the  empty
              string.  For <u>interp</u>, the empty string is the current interpreter.

       <b>info</b> <b>locals</b> ?<u>pattern</u>?
              If  <u>pattern</u> is given, returns the name of each local variable matching <u>pattern</u> according to <b>string</b>
              <b>match</b>.  Otherwise, returns the name of each local variable.  A variables defined with the  <b>global</b>,
              <b>upvar</b> or <b>variable</b> is not local.

       <b>info</b> <b>nameofexecutable</b>
              Returns  the absolute pathname of the program for the current interpreter.  If such a file can not
              be identified an empty string is returned.

       <b>info</b> <b>object</b> <u>subcommand</u> <u>object</u> ?<u>arg</u> <u>...</u>
              Returns information about the object named <u>object</u>. <u>subcommand</u> is  described  <b>OBJECT</b>  <b>INTROSPECTION</b>
              below.

       <b>info</b> <b>patchlevel</b>
              Returns  the  value  of  the global variable <b>tcl_patchLevel</b>, in which the exact version of the Tcl
              library initially stored.

       <b>info</b> <b>procs</b> ?<u>pattern</u>?
              Returns the names of all visible procedures. If <u>pattern</u> is given, returns only  those  names  that
              match  according  to  <b>string</b>  <b>match</b>.  Only the final component in <u>pattern</u> is actually considered a
              pattern.  Any qualifying components simply select a namespace.  See <b>NAMESPACE</b>  <b>RESOLUTION</b>  in  the
              <b><a href="../man3tcl/namespace.3tcl.html">namespace</a></b>(3tcl) documentation.

       <b>info</b> <b>script</b> ?<u>filename</u>?
              Returns  the pathname of the innermost script currently being evaluated, or the empty string if no
              pathname can be determined.  If <u>filename</u> is given, sets the return value of any  future  calls  to
              <b>info</b>  <b>script</b>  for  the  duration  of  the innermost active script.  This is useful in virtual file
              system applications.

       <b>info</b> <b>sharedlibextension</b>
              Returns the extension used on this platform  for  names  of  shared  libraries,  e.g.   <b>.so</b>  under
              Solaris.  Returns the empty string if shared libraries are not supported on this platform.

       <b>info</b> <b>tclversion</b>
              Returns  the value of the global variable <b>tcl_version</b>, in which the major and minor version of the
              Tcl library are stored.

       <b>info</b> <b>vars</b> ?<u>pattern</u>?
              If <u>pattern</u> is not given, returns the names of all visible variables.  If <u>pattern</u> is given, returns
              only those names that match according to <b>string</b> <b>match</b>.  Only the last component of  <u>pattern</u>  is  a
              pattern.   Other components identify a namespace.  See <b>NAMESPACE</b> <b>RESOLUTION</b> in the <b><a href="../man3tcl/namespace.3tcl.html">namespace</a></b>(3tcl)
              documentation.  When <u>pattern</u> is a qualified name, results are fully qualified.

              A variable that has been declared but not yet given a value will be included in the results.

   <b>CLASS</b> <b>INTROSPECTION</b>
       The following <u>subcommand</u> values are supported by <b>info</b> <b>class</b>:

       <b>info</b> <b>class</b> <b>call</b> <u>class</u> <u>method</u>
              Returns a description of the method implementations that  are  used  to  provide  a  stereotypical
              instance  of  <u>class</u>'s implementation of <u>method</u> (stereotypical instances being objects instantiated
              by a class without having any object-specific definitions added). This consists of a list of lists
              of four elements, where each sublist consists of a word that describes the general type of  method
              implementation  (being one of <b>method</b> for an ordinary method, <b>filter</b> for an applied filter, <b>private</b> 2
              for a private method, and <b>unknown</b> for  a  method  that  is  invoked  as  part  of  unknown  method
              handling),  a  word  giving the name of the particular method invoked (which is always the same as
              <u>method</u> for the <b>method</b> type, and “<b>unknown</b>” for the <b>unknown</b> type), a word giving the fully qualified
              name of the class that defined the method, and a word describing the type of method implementation
              (see <b>info</b> <b>class</b> <b>methodtype</b>).

              Note that there is no inspection of whether  the  method  implementations  actually  use  <b>next</b>  to
              transfer control along the call chain, and the call chains that this command files do not actually 2
              contain private methods.

       <b>info</b> <b>class</b> <b>constructor</b> <u>class</u>
              This  subcommand  returns  a  description of the definition of the constructor of class <u>class</u>. The
              definition is described as a two element list; the first element is the list of arguments  to  the
              constructor in a form suitable for passing to another call to <b>proc</b> or a method definition, and the
              second  element  is  the  body  of the constructor. If no constructor is present, this returns the
              empty list.

       <b>info</b> <b>class</b> <b>definition</b> <u>class</u> <u>method</u>
              This subcommand returns a description of the definition of the method named <u>method</u> of class <u>class</u>.
              The definition is described as a two element list; the first element is the list of  arguments  to
              the  method in a form suitable for passing to another call to <b>proc</b> or a method definition, and the
              second element is the body of the method.

       <b>info</b> <b>class</b> <b>definitionnamespace</b> <u>class</u> ?<u>kind</u>?
              This subcommand returns the definition namespace for <u>kind</u> definitions  of  the  class  <u>class</u>;  the 2
              definition namespace only affects the instances of <u>class</u>, not <u>class</u> itself. The <u>kind</u> can be either 2
              <b>-class</b>  to  return  the  definition  namespace  used  for  <b>oo::define</b>,  or <b>-instance</b> to return the 2
              definition namespace used for <b>oo::objdefine</b>; the <b>-class</b> kind  is  default  (though  this  is  only 2
              actually useful on classes that are subclasses of <b>oo::class</b>).                                      2

              If <u>class</u> does not provide a definition namespace of the given kind, this command returns the empty 2
              string. In those circumstances, the <b>oo::define</b> and <b>oo::objdefine</b> commands look up which definition 2
              namespace to use using the class inheritance hierarchy.                                            2

       <b>info</b> <b>class</b> <b>destructor</b> <u>class</u>
              This  subcommand  returns  the body of the destructor of class <u>class</u>. If no destructor is present,
              this returns the empty string.

       <b>info</b> <b>class</b> <b>filters</b> <u>class</u>
              This subcommand returns the list of filter methods set on the class.

       <b>info</b> <b>class</b> <b>forward</b> <u>class</u> <u>method</u>
              This subcommand returns the argument list for the method forwarding called <u>method</u> that is  set  on
              the class called <u>class</u>.

       <b>info</b> <b>class</b> <b>instances</b> <u>class</u> ?<u>pattern</u>?
              This  subcommand  returns  a list of instances of class <u>class</u>. If the optional <u>pattern</u> argument is
              present, it constrains the list of returned instances to those that  match  it  according  to  the
              rules of <b>string</b> <b>match</b>.

       <b>info</b> <b>class</b> <b>methods</b> <u>class</u> ?<u>options...</u>?
              This  subcommand  returns  a list of all public (i.e. exported) methods of the class called <u>class</u>.
              Any of the following <u>option</u>s may be given, controlling exactly which method names are returned:

              <b>-all</b>   If the <b>-all</b> flag is given, and the <b>-scope</b> flag is not  given,  the  list  of  methods  will 2
                     include  those  methods defined not just by the class, but also by the class's superclasses
                     and mixins.

              <b>-private</b>
                     If the <b>-private</b> flag is given, and the <b>-scope</b> flag is not given, the list of  methods  will 2
                     also include the non-exported methods of the class (and superclasses and mixins, if <b>-all</b> is
                     also given).  Note that this naming is an unfortunate clash with true private methods; this 2
                     option name is retained for backward compatibility.

              <b>-scope</b> <u>scope</u>
                     Returns  a  list  of  all methods on <u>class</u> that have the given visibility <u>scope</u>.  When this 2
                     option is supplied, both the <b>-all</b> and <b>-private</b> options are ignored. The  valid  values  for 2
                     <u>scope</u> are:                                                                                  2

                        Only  methods  with  <u>public</u>  scope (i.e., callable from anywhere by any instance of this 2
                        class) are to be returned.                                                               2

                     <b>unexported</b>                                                                                  2
                        Only methods with <u>unexported</u> scope (i.e., only callable via <b>my</b>) are to be returned.      2

                     <b>private</b>                                                                                     2
                        Only methods with <u>private</u> scope (i.e., only callable from within this  class's  methods) 2
                        are to be returned.                                                                      2

       <b>info</b> <b>class</b> <b>methodtype</b> <u>class</u> <u>method</u>
              This  subcommand  returns  a  description  of the type of implementation used for the method named
              <u>method</u> of class <u>class</u>. When the result is <b>method</b>, further information can be discovered with  <b>info</b>
              <b>class</b>  <b>definition</b>, and when the result is <b>forward</b>, further information can be discovered with <b>info</b>
              <b>class</b> <b>forward</b>.

       <b>info</b> <b>class</b> <b>mixins</b> <u>class</u>
              This subcommand returns a list of all classes that have been mixed into the class named <u>class</u>.

       <b>info</b> <b>class</b> <b>properties</b> <u>class</u> ?<u>options...</u>
              This subcommand returns a sorted list of properties defined on the class named <u>class</u>. The  <u>options</u> 2
              define exactly which properties are returned:                                                      2

              <b>-all</b>                                                                                               2
                     With  this  option,  the  properties from the superclasses and mixins of the class are also 2
                     returned.                                                                                   2

                     This option (the default behavior) asks for the readable properties to  be  returned.  Only 2
                     readable or writable properties are returned, not both.                                     2

              <b>-writable</b>                                                                                          2
                     This  option  asks  for  the writable properties to be returned.  Only readable or writable 2
                     properties are returned, not both.                                                          2

       <b>info</b> <b>class</b> <b>subclasses</b> <u>class</u> ?<u>pattern</u>?
              This subcommand returns a list of direct subclasses  of  class  <u>class</u>.  If  the  optional  <u>pattern</u>
              argument  is  present, it constrains the list of returned classes to those that match it according
              to the rules of <b>string</b> <b>match</b>.

       <b>info</b> <b>class</b> <b>superclasses</b> <u>class</u>
              This subcommand returns a list of direct superclasses of class  <u>class</u>  in  inheritance  precedence
              order.

       <b>info</b> <b>class</b> <b>variables</b> <u>class</u> ?<b>-private</b>?
              This  subcommand returns a list of all variables that have been declared for the class named <u>class</u>
              (i.e. that are automatically present in the class's methods, constructor and destructor).  If  the 2
              <b>-private</b> option is given, this lists the private variables declared instead.

   <b>OBJECT</b> <b>INTROSPECTION</b>
       The following <u>subcommand</u> values are supported by <b>info</b> <b>object</b>:

       <b>info</b> <b>object</b> <b>call</b> <u>object</u> <u>method</u>
              Returns   a  description  of  the  method  implementations  that  are  used  to  provide  <u>object</u>'s
              implementation of <u>method</u>.  This consists of a list of lists of four elements, where  each  sublist
              consists  of  a word that describes the general type of method implementation (being one of <b>method</b>
              for an ordinary method, <b>filter</b> for an applied filter, <b>private</b> for a private  method,  and  <b>unknown</b> 2
              for  a  method  that is invoked as part of unknown method handling), a word giving the name of the
              particular method invoked (which is always the same as <u>method</u> for the <b>method</b> type,  and  “<b>unknown</b>”
              for  the  <b>unknown</b>  type),  a  word giving what defined the method (the fully qualified name of the
              class, or the literal string <b>object</b> if the method implementation is on an instance),  and  a  word
              describing the type of method implementation (see <b>info</b> <b>object</b> <b>methodtype</b>).

              Note  that  there  is  no  inspection  of  whether the method implementations actually use <b>next</b> to
              transfer control along the call chain, and the call chains that this command files do not actually 2
              contain private methods.

       <b>info</b> <b>object</b> <b>class</b> <u>object</u> ?<u>className</u>?
              If <u>className</u> is not given, this subcommand returns class of the <u>object</u>  object.  If  <u>className</u>  is
              present, this subcommand returns a boolean value indicating whether the <u>object</u> is of that class.

       <b>info</b> <b>object</b> <b>creationid</b> <u>object</u>
              Returns  the  unique creation identifier for the <u>object</u> object. This creation identifier is unique 2
              to the object (within a Tcl interpreter) and cannot be  controlled  at  object  creation  time  or 2
              altered afterwards.                                                                                2

              <u>Implementation</u>  <u>note:</u>  the  creation  identifier is used to generate unique identifiers associated 2
              with the object, especially for private variables.                                                 2

       <b>info</b> <b>object</b> <b>definition</b> <u>object</u> <u>method</u>
              This subcommand returns a description of the definition of  the  method  named  <u>method</u>  of  object
              <u>object</u>.  The  definition  is  described  as  a  two element list; the first element is the list of
              arguments to the method in a form suitable for passing  to  another  call  to  <b>proc</b>  or  a  method
              definition, and the second element is the body of the method.

       <b>info</b> <b>object</b> <b>filters</b> <u>object</u>
              This subcommand returns the list of filter methods set on the object.

       <b>info</b> <b>object</b> <b>forward</b> <u>object</u> <u>method</u>
              This  subcommand  returns the argument list for the method forwarding called <u>method</u> that is set on
              the object called <u>object</u>.

       <b>info</b> <b>object</b> <b>isa</b> <u>category</u> <u>object</u> ?<u>arg</u>?
              This subcommand tests whether an object belongs to a  particular  category,  returning  a  boolean
              value  that  indicates  whether  the  <u>object</u>  argument  meets  the  criteria for the category. The
              supported categories are:

              <b>info</b> <b>object</b> <b>isa</b> <b>class</b> <u>object</u>
                     This returns whether <u>object</u> is a class (i.e.  an  instance  of  <b>oo::class</b>  or  one  of  its
                     subclasses).

              <b>info</b> <b>object</b> <b>isa</b> <b>metaclass</b> <u>object</u>
                     This returns whether <u>object</u> is a class that can manufacture classes (i.e. is <b>oo::class</b> or a
                     subclass of it).

              <b>info</b> <b>object</b> <b>isa</b> <b>mixin</b> <u>object</u> <u>class</u>
                     This returns whether <u>class</u> is directly mixed into <u>object</u>.

              <b>info</b> <b>object</b> <b>isa</b> <b>object</b> <u>object</u>
                     This returns whether <u>object</u> really is an object.

              <b>info</b> <b>object</b> <b>isa</b> <b>typeof</b> <u>object</u> <u>class</u>
                     This  returns  whether  <u>class</u>  is the type of <u>object</u> (i.e. whether <u>object</u> is an instance of
                     <u>class</u> or one of its subclasses, whether direct or indirect).

       <b>info</b> <b>object</b> <b>methods</b> <u>object</u> ?<u>option...</u>?
              This subcommand returns a list of all public (i.e. exported) methods of the object called  <u>object</u>.
              Any of the following <u>option</u>s may be given, controlling exactly which method names are returned:

              <b>-all</b>   If  the  <b>-all</b>  flag  is  given,  and the <b>-scope</b> flag is not given, the list of methods will 2
                     include those methods defined not just by the object, but also by the  object's  class  and
                     mixins, plus the superclasses of those classes.

              <b>-private</b>
                     If  the  <b>-private</b> flag is given, and the <b>-scope</b> flag is not given, the list of methods will 2
                     also include the non-exported methods of the object (and classes, if <b>-all</b> is  also  given). 2
                     Note  that  this naming is an unfortunate clash with true private methods; this option name 2
                     is retained for backward compatibility.

              <b>-scope</b> <u>scope</u>
                     Returns a list of all methods on <u>object</u> that have the given visibility  <u>scope</u>.   When  this 2
                     option  is  supplied,  both the <b>-all</b> and <b>-private</b> options are ignored. The valid values for 2
                     <u>scope</u> are:                                                                                  2

                        Only methods with <u>public</u> scope (i.e., callable from anywhere) are to be returned.        2

                     <b>unexported</b>                                                                                  2
                        Only methods with <u>unexported</u> scope (i.e., only callable via <b>my</b>) are to be returned.      2

                     <b>private</b>                                                                                     2
                        Only methods with <u>private</u> scope (i.e., only callable from within this object's  instance 2
                        methods) are to be returned.                                                             2

       <b>info</b> <b>object</b> <b>methodtype</b> <u>object</u> <u>method</u>
              This  subcommand  returns  a  description  of the type of implementation used for the method named

       <b>info</b> <b>object</b> <b>namespace</b> <u>object</u>
              This subcommand returns the name of the internal namespace of the object named <u>object</u>.

       <b>info</b> <b>object</b> <b>properties</b> <u>object</u> ?<u>options...</u>
              This  subcommand  returns  a  sorted  list  of  properties defined on the object named <u>object</u>. The 2
              <u>options</u> define exactly which properties are returned:                                              2

              <b>-all</b>                                                                                               2
                     With this option, the properties from the class, superclasses and mixins of the object  are 2
                     also returned.                                                                              2

                     This  option  (the  default behavior) asks for the readable properties to be returned. Only 2
                     readable or writable properties are returned, not both.                                     2

              <b>-writable</b>                                                                                          2

       <b>info</b> <b>object</b> <b>variables</b> <u>object</u> ?<b>-private</b>?
              This  subcommand  returns  a  list  of  all variables that have been declared for the object named
              <u>object</u> (i.e. that are automatically present in the object's methods).  If the <b>-private</b>  option  is 2
              given, this lists the private variables declared instead.

       <b>info</b> <b>object</b> <b>vars</b> <u>object</u> ?<u>pattern</u>?
              This  subcommand  returns  a  list  of  all variables in the private namespace of the object named
              <u>object</u>. If the optional <u>pattern</u> argument is given, it is a filter (in the syntax of a <b>string</b> <b>match</b>
              glob pattern) that constrains the list of variables returned. Note that this is different from the
              list returned by <b>info</b> <b>object</b> <b>variables</b>; that can  include  variables  that  are  currently  unset,
              whereas  this can include variables that are not automatically included by any of <u>object</u>'s methods
              (or those of its class, superclasses or mixins).

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       This command prints out a procedure suitable for saving in a Tcl script:

              proc printProc {procName} {
                  set result [list proc $procName]
                  set formals {}
                  foreach var [<b>info</b> <b>args</b> $procName] {
                      if {[<b>info</b> <b>default</b> $procName $var def]} {
                          lappend formals [list $var $def]
                      } else {
                          # Still need the list-quoting because variable
                          # names may properly contain spaces.
                          lappend formals [list $var]
                      }
                  }
                  puts [lappend result $formals [<b>info</b> <b>body</b> $procName]]
              }

   <b>EXAMPLES</b> <b>WITH</b> <b>OBJECTS</b>
       Every object necessarily knows what its class is;  this  information  is  trivially  extractable  through
       introspection:

              oo::class create c
              c create o
              puts [<b>info</b> <b>object</b> <b>class</b> o]
                                   <u>→</u> <u>prints</u> <u>"::c"</u>
              puts [<b>info</b> <b>object</b> <b>class</b> c]
                                   <u>→</u> <u>prints</u> <u>"::oo::class"</u>

       The  introspection  capabilities can be used to discover what class implements a method and get how it is
       defined. This procedure illustrates how:

              proc getDef {obj method} {
                  foreach inf [<b>info</b> <b>object</b> <b>call</b> $obj $method] {
                      lassign $inf calltype name locus methodtype

                      # Assume no forwards or filters, and hence no $calltype
                      # or $methodtype checks...

                      if {$locus eq "object"} {
                          return [<b>info</b> <b>object</b> <b>definition</b> $obj $name]
                      } else {
                          return [<b>info</b> <b>class</b> <b>definition</b> $locus $name]
                      }
                  }
                  error "no definition for $method"
              }

       This is an alternate way of looking up the definition; it is implemented by manually scanning the list of
       methods up the inheritance tree. This code assumes that only single inheritance is in use, and that there
       is no complex use of mixed-in classes (in such cases, using <b>info</b> <b>object</b> <b>call</b> as above is the simplest way
       of doing this by far):

              proc getDef {obj method} {
                  if {$method in [<b>info</b> <b>object</b> <b>methods</b> $obj]} {
                      # Assume no forwards
                      return [<b>info</b> <b>object</b> <b>definition</b> $obj $method]
                  }

                  set cls [<b>info</b> <b>object</b> <b>class</b> $obj]

                  while {$method ni [<b>info</b> <b>class</b> <b>methods</b> $cls]} {
                      # Assume the simple case
                      set cls [lindex [<b>info</b> <b>class</b> <b>superclass</b> $cls] 0]
                      if {$cls eq ""} {
                          error "no definition for $method"
                      }
                  }

                  # Assume no forwards
                  return [<b>info</b> <b>class</b> <b>definition</b> $cls $method]
              }
