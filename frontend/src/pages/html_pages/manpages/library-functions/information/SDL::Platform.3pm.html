</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       SDL-Platform - Platform Specific Information about SDL Perl

</pre><h4><b>CATEGORY</b></h4><pre>
       Documentation

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This document describes OS specific information regarding the installation and use of SDL.

   <b>General</b> <b>(all</b> <b>OS)</b>
       You need to install Alien::SDL to acquire all prerequisites of SDL.

       On Windows, Alien::SDL will get you zip-files containing prebuilt libs.

       On Unixes you can choose between compiling libs or use libs provided by the dist.  The different options
       on Unixes are available when requirements are met. Like having specific libs installed.

       There is some additional documentation in the Github-Wiki
       &lt;https://github.com/PerlGameDev/SDL/wiki/Testing&gt;.  You definitively want to look there, if you want to
       know how to install SDL from the latest sources (e.g. in an unfinished, unreleased state).

</pre><h4><b>Windows</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Installation</b>
       We recommend Strawberry Perl. You can get it here &lt;<a href="http://strawberryperl.com/">http://strawberryperl.com/</a>&gt;.

       Once you installed Strawberry Perl, you can access the cpan shell via the start menu.

       Open up the cpan shell and type "install Alien::SDL SDL". Please follow the dialog and answer the
       questions to the best of your knowledge.

</pre><h4><b>Mac</b> <b>OS</b> <b>X</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Installation</b>
       You will need a newer version of Perl that you can install with App::perlbrew.

       Once you have a newer Perl installed please use "cpan" to install Alien::SDL (and of course SDL).

   <b>Using</b> <b>SDL</b> <b>on</b> <b>Mac</b> <b>OS</b> <b>X</b>
       You can't use the "perl" executable to run SDL scripts on Mac OS X, you need to use "SDLPerl".  When you
       install SDL, a program named "SDLPerl" is installed. It should be in your path.

       Using Mac OS X, your SDL Perl script have to look like this:

         #!SDLPerl

         use strict;
         use warnings;
         use SDL;
         # your code here ...

       Using the wrong Perl executable, you might encounter a lot of error messages resulting in "terminate
       called after throwing an instance of 'NSException'".  cf. the corresponding github issue
       &lt;https://github.com/PerlGameDev/SDL/issues/208&gt;.
