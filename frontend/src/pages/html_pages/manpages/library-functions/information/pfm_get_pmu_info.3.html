       pfm_get_pmu_info - get PMU information

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;perfmon/pfmlib.h&gt;</b>

       <b>int</b> <b>pfm_get_pmu_info(pfm_pmu_t</b> <u>pmu</u><b>,</b> <b>pfm_pmu_info_t</b> <b>*</b><u>info</u><b>);</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This function returns in <b>info</b> information about a PMU model designated by its identifier in <b>pmu</b>.

       The <b>pfm_pmu_info</b> structure is defined as follows:
       typedef struct {
               const char              *name;
               const char              *desc;
               pfm_pmu_t               pmu;
               pfm_pmu_type_t          type;
               int                     size;
               int                     nevents;
               int                     first_event;
               int                     max_encoding;
               int                     num_cntrs;
               int                     num_fixed_cntrs;
               struct {
                       int             is_present:1;
                       int             is_arch_default:1;
                       int             is_core:1;
                       int             is_uncore:1;
                       int             reserved:28;
               };
       } pfm_pmu_info_t;

       The fields of this structure are defined as follows:

       <b>name</b>   This  is  the symbolic name of the PMU. This name can be used as a prefix in an event string. This
              is a read-only string.

       <b>desc</b>   This is the description of PMU. This is a read-only string.

       <b>pmu</b>    This is the unique PMU identification code. It is identical to the value  passed  in  <b>pmu</b>  and  it
              provided only for completeness.

       <b>type</b>   This field contains the type of the PMU. The following types are defined:

              <b>PFM_PMU_TYPE_UNKNOWN</b>
                     The type of the PMU could not be determined.

              <b>PFM_PMU_TYPE_CORE</b>
                     This field is set to one when the PMU is implemented by the processor core.

              <b>PFM_PMU_TYPE_UNCORE</b>
                     This field is set to one when the PMU is implemented on the processor die but at the socket
                     level, i.e., capturing events for all cores.

       <b>nevents</b>
              This  is the number of available events for this PMU model based on the host processor. It is <b>only</b>
              valid if the <b>is_present</b> field is set to 1. Event identifiers are  not  guaranteed  contiguous.  In
              other  words,  it  is not because <b>nevents</b> is equal to 100, that event identifiers go from 0 to 99.
              The iterator function <b>pfm_get_event_next()</b> must be used to go from one identifier to the next.

       <b>first_event</b>
              This field returns the opaque index of the first event for this PMU model. The index can  be  used
              with  <b>pfm_get_event_info()</b> or <b>pfm_get_event_next()</b> functions.  In case no event is available, this
              field contains <b>-1</b>.

       <b>num_cntrs</b>
              This field contains the number of generic counters supported by the PMU.  A counter is generic  if
              it  can  count  more  than  one  event. When it is not possible to determine the number of generic
              counters, this field contains -1.

       <b>num_fixed_cntrs</b>
              This field contains the number of fixed counters supported by the PMU.  A counter is fixed  if  it
              hardwired  to  count  only  one  event. When it is not possible to determine the number of generic
              counters, this field contains -1.

       <b>size</b>   This field contains the size of the struct passed. This field is used to provide for extensibility
              of  the  struct  without  compromising  backward  compatibility.   The  value  should  be  set  to
              <b>sizeof(pfm_pmu_info_t)</b>.  If  instead,  a  value  of <b>0</b> is specified, the library assumes the struct
              passed is identical to the first ABI version which size is <b>PFM_PMU_INFO_ABI0</b>. Thus, if fields were
              added after the first ABI, they will not be set by the library. The library does check that  bytes
              beyond what is implemented are zeroes.

       <b>max_encoding</b>
              This field returns the number of event codes returned by <b>pfm_get_event_encoding()</b>.

       <b>is_present</b>
              This field is set to one is the PMU model has been detected on the host system.

       <b>is_dfl</b> This  field  is  set  to  one if the PMU is the default PMU for this architecture.  Otherwise this
              field is zero.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b></h4><pre>
       If successful, the function returns <b>PFM_SUCCESS</b> and PMU information in  <b>info</b>,  otherwise  it  returns  an
       error code.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>PFMLIB_ERR_NOINIT</b>
              Library has not been initialized properly.

       <b>PFMLIB_ERR_NOTSUPP</b>
              PMU model is not supported by the library.

       <b>PFMLIB_ERR_INVAL</b>
              The <b>pmu</b> argument is invalid or <b>info</b> is <b>NULL</b> or <b>size</b> is not zero.
