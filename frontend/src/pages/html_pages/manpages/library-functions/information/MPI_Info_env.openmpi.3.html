</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  MPI-3  standard  established  a static MPI_Info object named <u>MPI_Info_env</u> that can be used to access
       information about how the application was executed from the run-time.

</pre><h4><b>SUPPORTED</b> <b>FIELDS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>command</b>
              If available, the value will be set to argv[0]. Note that the value may not always be available  -
              e.g.,  it is valid for a program to call <u>MPI_Init</u> with NULL parameters, in which case argv[0] will
              not be set if run as a singleton. This value will never be set in a Fortran program  as  the  argv
              are not available.

       <b>argv</b>   The argv given for the application. If no arguments are passed to the application, then this value
              will  not be set. It will also not be set in the case of a singleton that calls <u>MPI_Init</u> with NULL
              parameters, or a Fortran program.

       <b>maxprocs</b>
              The number of processes in the job.

       <b>soft</b>   Open MPI does not support the <u>soft</u> option for specifying the number of processes to  be  executed,
              so this value is set to the same as <u>maxprocs</u>.

       <b>host</b>   The name of the host this process is executing upon - the value returned from <u>gethostname()</u>.

       <b>arch</b>   The  architecture  of the host this process is executing upon. This value indicates the underlying
              chip architecture (e.g., x86_64), if it can be determined.

       <b>wdir</b>   The working directory at the time of process launch by mpiexec. Note that this value will  not  be
              set  for  processes  launched  as  singletons  as  there is no reliable way for the MPI library to
              determine the location.

       <b>file</b>   Although specified by the MPI-3 standard, no value is currently set for this field.

       <b>thread_level</b>
              The requested MPI thread level - note that this may differ from the <u>actual</u> MPI thread level of the
              application.

       <b>ompi_num_apps</b>
              The number of application contexts in an MPMD job. This is an Open MPI-specific field and value.

       <b>ompi_np</b>
              The number of processes in each  application  context,  provided  as  a  space-delimited  list  of
              integers. This is an Open MPI-specific field and value.

       <b>ompi_first_rank</b>
              The  MPI rank of the first process in each application context, provided as a space-delimited list
              of integers This is an Open MPI-specific field and value.

       <b>ompi_positioned_file_dir</b>
              If Open MPI was asked to pre-position files, this field provides  the  top-level  directory  where
              those files were place. This is an Open MPI-specific field and value.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       When calling <u>MPI_Info_get</u>, the <u>flag</u> parameter will be set to zero
       (false) if a value for the field has not been set.
