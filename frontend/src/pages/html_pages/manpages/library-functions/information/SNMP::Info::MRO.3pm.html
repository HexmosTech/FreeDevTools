</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       SNMP::Info::MRO - Method resolution introspection for SNMP::Info

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        use SNMP::Info::MRO;
        use Data::Printer;

        # SNMP::Info::MRO::print_* functions
        SNMP::Info::MRO::print_superclasses ('SNMP::Info::Layer3::Juniper');

        # print output using Data::Printer for other functions
        my $buff = SNMP::Info::MRO::all_methods('SNMP::Info::Layer3::Juniper');
        p $buff;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This is a set of helpers to show where a given method in SNMP::Info has been implemented, and which
       implementation is being used at runtime.

       The following distributions are <u>required</u> to run this code:

       •   PPI

       •   Class::ISA

       •   Module::Info

       •   Module::Load

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       None  of  the  functions  are  exported. For all helper functions, you can pass either the name of a Perl
       module, or an object instance of SNMP::Info.

       all_methods( $module )
           Returns the location of methods defined in $module  and  all  its  ancestor  classes  (superclasses),
           either as Perl subroutines or via %GLOBALS or %FUNCS configuration. The data structure looks like:

            {
              method_name =&gt; {
                globals =&gt; [
                  [ Package::Name        =&gt; 'mib_leaf.0' ],
                  [ Other::Package::Name =&gt; '1.3.6.1.4.1.9.2.1.58.0' ],
                ],
              },
              other_method_name =&gt; [
                subs =&gt; [
                  'Package::Name',
                ],
                funcs =&gt; [
                  [ Package::Name =&gt; 'mib_leaf_name' ],
                ],
              ],
            }

           It  should  be noted that the order of method resolution in SNMP::Info is to first look for a defined
           subroutine (this is done by Perl), then the  AUTOLOAD  sequence  will  search  for  a  definition  in
           %GLOBALS followed by %FUNCS.

           The defining class or module at runtime is always the first entry in the list, if it exists:

            $data-&gt;{method_name}-&gt;{subs}-&gt;[0]
              if exists $data-&gt;{method_name}-&gt;{subs};

       subroutines( $module )
           Returns  the  set  of subroutines defined in $module and all its ancestor classes (superclasses). The
           data structure looks like:

            {
              method_name =&gt; [
                'Package::Name',
                'Other::Package::Name',
              ],
              other_method_name =&gt; [
                'Package::Name',
              ],
            }

           Should a subroutine have been defined more than once, the defining  classes  are  listed  in  reverse
           order, such that the definition used at runtime is always:

            $data-&gt;{method_name}-&gt;[0];

       globals( $module || $object )
           Returns  a  data  structure showing how SNMP::Info will resolve MIB Leaf Nodes configured through the
           %GLOBALS hashes in $module.

           The data structure looks like:

            {
              method_name =&gt; [
                [ Package::Name        =&gt; 'mib_leaf_name' ],
                [ Other::Package::Name =&gt; '1.3.6.1.4.1.9.2.1.58.0' ],
              ],
              other_method_name =&gt; [
                [ Package::Name =&gt; 'mib_leaf.0' ],
              ],
            }

           Where a method has been defined in different packages, then they are listed in  reverse  order,  such
           that the mapping used by SNMP::Info is always:

            $data-&gt;{method_name}-&gt;[0];

       funcs( $module || $object )
           Returns a data structure showing how SNMP::Info will resolve MIB Tables configured through the %FUNCS
           hashes in $module.

           See "GLOBALS" in SNMP::Info::Layer3 for further detail.

       munge( $module || $object )
           Returns  a  data  structure  showing  the subroutines used for munging returned values for any method
           defined in %FUNCS or %GLOBALS.

           The data structure looks like:

            {
              method_name =&gt; [
                [ Package::Name        =&gt; '&amp;subroutine' ],
                [ Other::Package::Name =&gt; '&amp;Other::Package::subroutine' ],
              ],
              other_method_name =&gt; [
                [ Package::Name =&gt; '&amp;subroutine' ],
              ],
            }

           Where a mapping has been defined in different packages, then they are listed in reverse  order,  such
           that the munge subroutine used by SNMP::Info is always:

            $data-&gt;{method_name}-&gt;[0];

       file( $module )
           Returns the filename from which Perl will load the given module.

       superclasses( $class || $object )
           Returns  the  list  (in  order)  of  the  names  of classes Perl will search to find methods for this
           SNMP::Info class or object instance.

           Note this <b>requires</b> the Class::ISA distribution to be installed.

       print_globals( $module || $object )
           Pretty print the output of globals().

       print_funcs( $module || $object )
           Pretty print the output of funcs().

       print_munge( $module || $object )
           Pretty print the output of munge().

       print_superclasses( $class || $object )
           Pretty print the output of superclasses().
