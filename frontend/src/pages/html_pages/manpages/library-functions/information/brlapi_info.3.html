        - How to get information about the connected Terminal.

   <b>Functions</b>
       int <b>BRLAPI_STDCALL</b> <b>brlapi_getDriverName</b> (char *buffer, size_t size)
       int <b>BRLAPI_STDCALL</b> <b>brlapi__getDriverName</b> (<b>brlapi_handle_t</b> *handle, char *buffer, size_t size)

       int <b>BRLAPI_STDCALL</b> <b>brlapi__getDisplaySize</b> (<b>brlapi_handle_t</b> *handle, unsigned int *x, unsigned int *y)

</pre><h4><b>Detailed</b> <b>Description</b></h4><pre>
       Before using Raw mode or key codes, the application should always check the type of the connected
       terminal, to be sure it is really the one it expects.

       One should also check for display size, so as to adjust further displaying on it.

</pre><h4><b>Macro</b> <b>Definition</b> <b>Documentation</b></h4><pre>
   <b>#define</b> <b>BRLAPI_MAXNAMELENGTH</b>   <b>31</b>
       Maximum name length for driver names embeded in BrlAPI packets, not counting any termination \0 character

</pre><h4><b>Function</b> <b>Documentation</b></h4><pre>
   <b>int</b> <b>BRLAPI_STDCALL</b> <b>brlapi__getDisplaySize</b> <b>(brlapi_handle_t</b> <b>*</b> <b>handle,</b> <b>unsigned</b> <b>int</b> <b>*</b> <b>x,</b> <b>unsigned</b> <b>int</b> <b>*</b> <b>y)</b>
   <b>int</b> <b>BRLAPI_STDCALL</b> <b>brlapi__getDriverName</b> <b>(brlapi_handle_t</b> <b>*</b> <b>handle,</b> <b>char</b> <b>*</b> <b>buffer,</b> <b>size_t</b> <b>size)</b>
   <b>int</b> <b>BRLAPI_STDCALL</b> <b>brlapi__getModelIdentifier</b> <b>(brlapi_handle_t</b> <b>*</b> <b>handle,</b> <b>char</b> <b>*</b> <b>buffer,</b> <b>size_t</b> <b>size)</b>
   <b>int</b> <b>BRLAPI_STDCALL</b> <b>brlapi_getDisplaySize</b> <b>(unsigned</b> <b>int</b> <b>*</b> <b>x,</b> <b>unsigned</b> <b>int</b> <b>*</b> <b>y)</b>
       Return the size of the braille display

   <b>int</b> <b>BRLAPI_STDCALL</b> <b>brlapi_getDriverName</b> <b>(char</b> <b>*</b> <b>buffer,</b> <b>size_t</b> <b>size)</b>
       Return the complete name of the driver used by <u>brltty</u>

       This function fills its argument with the whole name of the braille driver if available, terminated with
       a '\0'.

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>buffer</u> is the buffer provided by the application;
           <u>size</u> is the maximum size for the name buffer.

       <b>Returns</b>
           -1 on error, otherwise a positive value giving the size of the needed buffer (including '\0'). If
           that value is bigger than size, the value was truncated and the caller should retry with a bigger
           buffer accordingly.

   <b>int</b> <b>BRLAPI_STDCALL</b> <b>brlapi_getModelIdentifier</b> <b>(char</b> <b>*</b> <b>buffer,</b> <b>size_t</b> <b>size)</b>
       Return an identifier for the device model used by <u>brltty</u>

       This function fills its argument with the whole identifier of the braille device model if available,
       terminated with a '\0'.

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>buffer</u> is the buffer given by the application;
           <u>size</u> is the maximum size for the identifier buffer.

       <b>Returns</b>
           -1 on error, otherwise a positive value giving the size of the needed buffer (including '\0'). If
           that value is bigger than size, the value was truncated and the caller should retry with a bigger
           buffer accordingly.
