       pfm_get_event_attr_info - get event attribute information

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;perfmon/pfmlib.h&gt;</b>

       <b>int</b> <b>pfm_get_event_attr_info(int</b> <u>idx</u><b>,</b> <b>int</b> <u>attr</u><b>,</b> <b>pfm_os_t</b> <u>os</u><b>,</b> <b>pfm_event_attr_info_t</b> <b>*</b><u>info</u><b>);</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  function returns in <b>info</b> information about the attribute designated by <b>attr</b> for the event specified
       in <b>idx</b> and the os layer in <b>os</b>.

       The <b>pfm_os_t</b> enumeration provides the following choices:

       <b>PFM_OS_NONE</b>
              The returned information pertains only to what the PMU  hardware  exports.   No  operating  system
              attributes is taken into account.

       <b>PFM_OS_PERF_EVENT</b>
              The  returned  information includes the actual PMU hardware and the additional attributes exported
              by the perf_events kernel interface.  The perf_event attributes pertain only the PMU hardware.  In
              case perf_events is not detected, an error is returned.

       <b>PFM_OS_PERF_EVENT_EXT</b>
              The returned information includes all of what is already provided by  <b>PFM_OS_PERF_EVENT</b>  plus  all
              the software attributes controlled by perf_events, such as sampling period, precise sampling.

       The <b>pfm_event_attr_info_t</b> structure is defined as follows:
       typedef struct {
               const char              *name;
               const char              *desc;
               const char              *equiv;
               size_t              size;
               uint64_t                code;
               pfm_attr_t              type;
               int                     idx;
               pfm_attr_ctrl_t         ctrl;
               int                     reserved1;
               struct {
                       int             is_dfl:1;
                       int             is_precise:1;
                       int             is_speculative:2;
                 int       support_hw_smpl:1;
                 int       support_no_mods:1;
                       int             reserved:26;
               };
               union {
                       uint64_t        dfl_val64;
                       const char      *dfl_str;
                       int             dfl_bool;
                       int             dfl_int;
               };
       } pfm_event_attr_info_t;

       The fields of this structure are defined as follows:

       <b>name</b>   This is the name of the attribute. This is a read-only string.

       <b>desc</b>   This  is  the  description  of the attribute. This is a read-only string.  It may contain multiple
              sentences.

       <b>equiv</b>  Certain attributes may be just variations of other attributes for the same  event.   They  may  be
              provided  as  handy shortcuts to avoid supplying a long list of attributes.  For those attributes,
              this field is not NULL and contains the complete equivalent attribute string.  This  string,  once
              appended to the event name, may be used library calls requiring an event string.

       <b>code</b>   This  is  the  raw  attribute  code. For PFM_ATTR_UMASK, this is the unit mask code. For all other
              attributes, this is an opaque index.

       <b>type</b>   This is the type of the attribute. Attributes represent either sub-events or  extra  filters  that
              can  be applied to the event. Filters (also called modifiers)  may be tied to the event or the PMU
              register the event is programmed into. The  type  of  an  attribute  determines  how  it  must  be
              specified. The following types are defined:

              <b>PFM_ATTR_UMASK</b>
                     This  is  a unit mask, i.e., a sub-event. It is specified using its name.  Depending on the
                     event, it may be possible to specify multiple unit masks.

              <b>PFM_ATTR_MOD_BOOL</b>
                     This is a boolean attribute. It has a value of 0, 1, y or n. The value is  specified  after
                     the  equal sign, e.g., foo=1. As a convenience, the equal sign and value may be omitted, in
                     which case this is equivalent to =1.

              <b>PFM_ATTR_MOD_INTEGER</b>
                     This is an integer attribute. It has a value which must be passed after the equal sign. The
                     range of valid values depends on the attribute and is usually specified in its description.

       <b>idx</b>    This is the attribute index. It is identical to the value of  <b>attr</b>  passed  to  the  call  and  is
              provided for completeness.

       <b>size</b>   This field contains the size of the struct passed. This field is used to provide for extensibility
              of  the  struct  without  compromising  backward  compatibility.   The  value  should  be  set  to
              <b>sizeof(pfm_event_attr_info_t)</b>. If instead, a value of <b>0</b> is  specified,  the  library  assumes  the
              struct  passed  is  identical  to the first ABI version which size is <b>PFM_ATTR_INFO_ABI0</b>. Thus, if
              fields were added after the first ABI, they will not be set by the library. The library does check
              that bytes beyond what is implemented are zeroes.

       <b>is_dfl</b> This field indicates whether or not this attribute is set by  default.  This  applies  mostly  for
              PFM_ATTR_UMASK.  If  a  unit mask is marked as default, and no unit mask is specified in the event
              string, then the library uses it by default. Note that there may be multiple  defaults  per  event
              depending on how unit masks are grouped.

       <b>is_precise</b>
              This  field  indicates whether or not this umask supports precise sampling.  Precise sampling is a
              hardware mechanism that avoids instruction address skid when using  interrupt-based  sampling.  On
              Intel  X86  processors,  this field indicates that the umask supports Precise Event-Based Sampling
              (PEBS).

       <b>is_speculative</b>
              This bitfield indicates whether  or  not  the  attribute  includes  occurrences  happening  during
              speculative  execution for both wrong and correct paths. Given that this kind of event information
              is  not  always  available  from  vendors,  this  field   uses   multiple   bits.   A   value   of
              <b>PFM_EVENT_INFO_SPEC_NA</b>  indicates  that  speculation  information  is  not  available.  A value of
              <b>PFM_EVENT_INFO_SPEC_TRUE</b> indicates that the attribute counts during speculative execution. A value
              of <b>PFM_EVENT_INFO_SPEC_FALSE</b> indicates that  the  attribute  does  not  count  during  speculative
              execution.

       <b>support_hw_smpl</b>
              This boolean field indicates that the attribute (in this case a umask) supports hardware sampling.
              That means the hardware can sample this event+umasks without involving the kernel at each sample.

       <b>support_no_mods</b>
              This  boolean  field  indicates  that  the  attribute  (in this case a umask) does not support any
              hardware or software modifiers, such as privilege level filters, sampling, precise  sampling,  and
              such.  This  is necessary when select umasks of an event have more restrictions than others, e.g.,
              the event and most umasks support modifiers except a few umasks.

       <b>dfl_val64,</b> <b>dfl_str,</b> <b>dfl_bool,</b> <b>dfl_int</b>
              This union contains the value of an attribute. For PFM_ATTR_UMASK, the is the unit mask code,  for
              all other types this is the actual value of the attribute.

       <b>ctrl</b>   This  field  indicates  which  layer  or source controls the attribute.  The following sources are
              defined:

              <b>PFM_ATTR_CTRL_UNKNOWN</b>
                     The source controlling the attribute is not known.

              <b>PFM_ATTR_CTRL_PMU</b>
                     The attribute is controlled by the PMU hardware.

              <b>PFM_ATTR_CTRL_PERF_EVENT</b>
                     The attribute is controlled by the perf_events kernel interface.

       <b>reserved</b>
              These fields must be set to zero.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b></h4><pre>
       If successful, the function returns <b>PFM_SUCCESS</b> and attribute information in <b>info</b>, otherwise  it  returns
       an error code.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>PFMLIB_ERR_NOINIT</b>
              Library has not been initialized properly.

       <b>PFMLIB_ERR_INVAL</b>
              The <b>idx</b> or <b>attr</b> arguments are invalid or <b>info</b> is <b>NULL</b> or <b>size</b> is not zero.

       <b>PFM_ERR_NOTSUPP</b>
              The requested os layer has not been detected on the host system.
