</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       App::Info::Request - App::Info event handler request object

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         # In an App::Info::Handler subclass:
         sub handler {
             my ($self, $req) = @_;
             print "Event Type:  ", $req-&gt;type;
             print "Message:     ", $req-&gt;message;
             print "Error:       ", $req-&gt;error;
             print "Value:       ", $req-&gt;value;
         }

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Objects of this class are passed to the "handler()" method of App::Info event handlers. Generally, this
       class will be of most interest to App::Info::Handler subclass implementers.

       The event triggering methods in App::Info each construct a new App::Info::Request object and initialize
       it with their arguments. The App::Info::Request object is then the sole argument passed to the
       "handler()" method of any and all App::Info::Handler objects in the event handling chain.  Thus, if you'd
       like to create your own App::Info event handler, this is the object you need to be familiar with. Consult
       the App::Info::Handler documentation for details on creating custom event handlers.

       Each of the App::Info event triggering methods constructs an App::Info::Request object with different
       attribute values. Be sure to consult the documentation for the event triggering methods in App::Info,
       where the values assigned to the App::Info::Request object are documented. Then, in your event handler
       subclass, check the value returned by the "type()" method to determine what type of event request you're
       handling to handle the request appropriately.

</pre><h4><b>INTERFACE</b></h4><pre>
       The following sections document the App::Info::Request interface.

   <b>Constructor</b>
       <u>new</u>

         my $req = App::Info::Request-&gt;new(%params);

       This method is used internally by App::Info to construct new App::Info::Request objects to pass to event
       handler objects. Generally, you won't need to use it, other than perhaps for testing custom
       App::Info::Handler classes.

       The parameters to "new()" are passed as a hash of named parameters that correspond to their like-named
       methods. The supported parameters are:

       type
       message
       error
       value
       callback

       See the object methods documentation below for details on these object attributes.

   <b>Object</b> <b>Methods</b>
       <u>key</u>

         my $key = $req-&gt;key;

       Returns  the  key  stored  in the App::Info::Request object. The key is used by the App::Info subclass to
       uniquely identify the information it is harvesting, such as the path to an executable. It might  be  used
       by request handlers, for example, to see if an option was passed on the command-line.

       <u>message</u>

         my $message = $req-&gt;message;

       Returns  the  message stored in the App::Info::Request object. The message is typically informational, or
       an error message, or a prompt message.

       <u>error</u>

         my $error = $req-&gt;error;

       Returns any error message associated with the App::Info::Request object. The error message  is  typically
       there to display for users when "callback()" returns false.

       <u>type</u>

         my $type = $req-&gt;type;

       Returns  a  string representing the type of event that triggered this request.  The types are the same as
       the event triggering methods defined in App::Info.  As of this writing, the supported types are:

       info
       error
       unknown
       confirm

       Be sure to consult the App::Info documentation for more details on the event types.

       <u>callback</u>

         if ($req-&gt;callback($value)) {
             print "Value '$value' is valid.\n";
         } else {
             print "Value '$value' is not valid.\n";
         }

       Executes the callback anonymous subroutine supplied by the App::Info concrete base class  that  triggered
       the  event.  If  the  callback  returns false, then $value is invalid. If the callback returns true, then
       $value is valid and can be assigned via the "value()" method.

       Note that the "value()" method itself calls "callback()" if it was passed a  value  to  assign.  See  its
       documentation below for more information.

       <u>value</u>

         my $value = $req-&gt;value;
         if ($req-&gt;value($value)) {
             print "Value '$value' successfully assigned.\n";
         } else {
             print "Value '$value' not successfully assigned.\n";
         }

       When   called  without  an  argument,  "value()"  simply  returns  the  value  currently  stored  by  the
       App::Info::Request object. Typically, the value is the default value for a  confirm  event,  or  a  value
       assigned to an unknown event.

       When  passed an argument, "value()" attempts to store the the argument as a new value. However, "value()"
       calls "callback()" on the new value, and if "callback()" returns false, then "value()" returns false  and
       does  not store the new value. If "callback()" returns true, on the other hand, then "value()" goes ahead
       and stores the new value and returns true.

       App::Info documents the event triggering methods and how they  construct  App::Info::Request  objects  to
       pass to event handlers.

       App::Info::Handler:  documents  how  to  create  custom  event  handlers,  which  must  make  use  of the
       App::Info::Request object passed to their "handler()" object methods.

       The  following  classes  subclass  App::Info::Handler,  and  thus  offer   good   exemplars   for   using
       App::Info::Request objects when handling events.

       App::Info::Handler::Carp
       App::Info::Handler::Print
       App::Info::Handler::Prompt
