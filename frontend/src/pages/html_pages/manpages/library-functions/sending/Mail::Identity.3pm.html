</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Mail::Identity - an e-mail role

</pre><h4><b>INHERITANCE</b></h4><pre>
        Mail::Identity
          is a User::Identity::Item

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        use User::Identity;
        use Mail::Identity;
        my $me   = User::Identity-&gt;new(...);
        my $addr = Mail::Identity-&gt;new(address =&gt; 'x@y');
        $me-&gt;add(email =&gt; $addr);

        # Simpler

        use User::Identity;
        my $me   = User::Identity-&gt;new(...);
        my $addr = $me-&gt;add(email =&gt; 'x@y');
        my $addr = $me-&gt;add( email =&gt; 'home'
                           , address =&gt; 'x@y');

        # Conversion
        my $ma   = Mail::Address-&gt;new(...);
        my $mi   = Mail::Identity-&gt;coerce($ma);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The "Mail::Identity" object contains the description of role played by a human when sending e-mail.  Most
       people have more than one role these days: for instance, a private and a company role with different
       e-mail addresses.

       An "Mail::Identity" object combines an e-mail address, user description ("phrase"), a signature, pgp-key,
       and so on.  All fields are optional, and some fields are smart.  One such set of data represents one
       role.  "Mail::Identity" is therefore the smart cousine of the Mail::Address object.

       Extends "DESCRIPTION" in User::Identity::Item.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       Extends "METHODS" in User::Identity::Item.

   <b>Constructors</b>
       Extends "Constructors" in User::Identity::Item.

             pgp_key                             undef
             phrase                              &lt;user's fullName&gt;
             signature                           undef
             username                            &lt;from address or user's nickname&gt;

           address =&gt; STRING
             The e-mail address is constructed from the username/domain, but when both do not exist, the name is
             taken.

           charset =&gt; STRING
           comment =&gt; STRING
           description =&gt; STRING
           domain =&gt; STRING
           language =&gt; STRING
           location =&gt; NAME|OBJECT
             The  user's  location  which relates to this mail identity.  This can be specified as location name
             (which will be looked-up when needed), or as User::Identity::Location object.

           name =&gt; STRING
           organization =&gt; STRING
             Usually defined for e-mail addresses which are used by a company or other  organization,  but  less
             common  for personal addresses.  This value will be used to fill the "Organization" header field of
             messages.

           parent =&gt; OBJECT
           pgp_key =&gt; STRING|FILENAME
           phrase =&gt; STRING
           signature =&gt; STRING
           username =&gt; STRING

   <b>Attributes</b>
       Extends "Attributes" in User::Identity::Item.

       $obj-&gt;<b>address</b>()
           Returns the e-mail address for this role.  If none was specified, it will  be  constructed  from  the
           username  and  domain.   If those are not present as well, then the <b>name()</b> is used when it contains a
           "@", else the user's nickname is taken.

       $obj-&gt;<b>charset</b>()
           Returns the character set used in comment and phrase.  When set to "undef", the strings (are  already
           encoded  to)  contain  only ASCII characters.  This defaults to the value of the user's charset, if a
           user is defined.

       $obj-&gt;<b>comment</b>( [STRING] )
           E-mail address -when included in message MIME headers- can contain a comment.  The RFCs advice not to
           store useful information in these comments, but it you really want to, you can do  it.   The  comment
           defaults to the user's fullname if the phrase is not the fullname and there is a user defined.

           Comments will be enclosed in parenthesis when used. Parenthesis (matching) or non-matching) which are
           already in the string will carefully escaped when needed.  You do not need to worry.

       $obj-&gt;<b>description</b>()
           Inherited, see "Attributes" in User::Identity::Item

       $obj-&gt;<b>domain</b>()
           The domain is the part of the e-mail address after the "@"-sign.  When this is not defined, it can be
           deducted from the email address (see <b>address()</b>).  If nothing is known, "localhost" is returned.

       $obj-&gt;<b>language</b>()
           Returns  the language which is used for the description fields of this e-mail address, which defaults
           to the user's language.

       $obj-&gt;<b>location</b>()
           Returns the object which describes to which location this mail address relates.  The location may  be
           used  to  find  the  name  of the organization involved, or to create a signature.  If no location is
           specified, but a user is defined which has locations, one of those is randomly chosen.

       $obj-&gt;<b>name</b>( [$newname] )
           Inherited, see "Attributes" in User::Identity::Item

       $obj-&gt;<b>organization</b>()
           Returns the organization which relates to this e-mail identity.  If not explicitly specified,  it  is
           tried to be found via the location.

       $obj-&gt;<b>phrase</b>()
           The  phrase  is used in an e-mail address to explain who is sending the message.  This usually is the
           fullname (the user's fullname is used by default), description of your function (Webmaster),  or  any
           other text.

           When  an  email  string is produced, the phase will be quoted if needed.  Quotes which are within the
           string will automatically be escaped, so you do no need to worry: input cannot break the outcome!

       $obj-&gt;<b>username</b>()
           Returns the username of this e-mail address.  If none is specified, first it is tried to  extract  it
           from  the  specified  e-mail  address.   If there is also no username in the e-mail address, the user
           identity's nickname is taken.

   <b>Collections</b>
       Extends "Collections" in User::Identity::Item.

       $obj-&gt;<b>add</b>($collection, $role)
           Inherited, see "Collections" in User::Identity::Item

       $obj-&gt;<b>addCollection</b>( $object | &lt;[$type], %options&gt; )
           Inherited, see "Collections" in User::Identity::Item

       $obj-&gt;<b>collection</b>($name)
           Inherited, see "Collections" in User::Identity::Item

       $obj-&gt;<b>parent</b>( [$parent] )
           Inherited, see "Collections" in User::Identity::Item

       $obj-&gt;<b>removeCollection</b>($object|$name)
           Inherited, see "Collections" in User::Identity::Item

       $obj-&gt;<b>type</b>()
       Mail::Identity-&gt;<b>type</b>()
           Inherited, see "Collections" in User::Identity::Item

       $obj-&gt;<b>user</b>()
           Inherited, see "Collections" in User::Identity::Item

   <b>Searching</b>
       Extends "Searching" in User::Identity::Item.

       $obj-&gt;<b>find</b>($collection, $role)
           Inherited, see "Searching" in User::Identity::Item

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       Error: $object is not a collection.
           The first argument is an object, but not of a class which extends User::Identity::Collection.

       Error: Cannot load collection module for $type ($class).
           Either the specified $type does not exist, or that module named $class  returns  compilation  errors.
           If  the type as specified in the warning is not the name of a package, you specified a nickname which
           was not defined.  Maybe you forgot the 'require' the package which defines the nickname.

       Error: Creation of a collection via $class failed.
           The $class did compile, but it was not possible to create an object of that class using  the  options
           you specified.

       Error: Don't know what type of collection you want to add.
           If you add a collection, it must either by a collection object or a list of options which can be used
           to create a collection object.  In the latter case, the type of collection must be specified.

       Warning: No collection $name
           The collection with $name does not exist and can not be created.
