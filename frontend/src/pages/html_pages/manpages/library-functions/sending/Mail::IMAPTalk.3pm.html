</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module communicates with an IMAP server. Each IMAP server command is mapped to a method of this
       object.

       Although other IMAP modules exist on CPAN, this has several advantages over other modules.

       •   It  parses  the  more  complex IMAP structures like envelopes and body structures into nice Perl data
           structures.

       •   It correctly supports atoms, quoted strings and literals at any point. Some parsers in other  modules
           aren't fully IMAP compatiable and may break at odd times with certain messages on some servers.

       •   It  allows large return values (eg. attachments on a message) to be read directly into a file, rather
           than into memory.

       •   It includes some helper functions to find the actual text/plain or text/html part of a message out of
           a complex MIME structure.  It also can find a list of attachements, and CID links for  HTML  messages
           with attached images.

       •   It  supports  decoding of MIME headers to Perl utf-8 strings automatically, so you don't have to deal
           with MIME encoded headers (enabled optionally).

       While the IMAP protocol does allow for asynchronous running of commands, this module is  designed  to  be
       used  in  a  synchronous  manner.  That is, you issue a command by calling a method, and the command will
       block until the appropriate response is returned. The method will then return the parsed results from the
       given command.

</pre><h4><b>CLASS</b> <b>OVERVIEW</b></h4><pre>
       The object methods have been broken in several sections.

   <b>Sections</b>
       CONSTANTS
           Lists the available constants the class uses.

       CONSTRUCTOR
           Explains all the options available when constructing a new instance of the "Mail::IMAPTalk" class.

       CONNECTION CONTROL METHODS
           These are methods which control the overall IMAP connection object, such as logging  in  and  logging
           out, how results are parsed, how folder names and message id's are treated, etc.

       IMAP FOLDER COMMAND METHODS
           These are methods to inspect, add, delete and rename IMAP folders on the server.

       IMAP MESSAGE COMMAND METHODS
           These are methods to retrieve, delete, move and add messages to/from IMAP folders.

       HELPER METHODS
           These  are  extra methods that users of this class might find useful. They generally do extra parsing
           on returned structures to provide higher level functionality.

       INTERNAL METHODS
           These are methods used internally by the "Mail::IMAPTalk" object to get work done. They may be useful
           if you need to extend the class yourself. Note that  internal  methods  will  always  'die'  if  they
           encounter any errors.

       INTERNAL SOCKET FUNCTIONS
           These  are  functions  used  internally by the "Mail::IMAPTalk" object to read/write data to/from the
           IMAP connection socket. The class does its own buffering so if you want to  read/write  to  the  IMAP
           socket, you should use these functions.

       INTERNAL PARSING FUNCTIONS
           These  are  functions  used  to  parse the results returned from the IMAP server into Perl style data
           structures.

   <b>Method</b> <b>results</b>
       All methods return undef on failure. There are four main modes of failure:

       1. An error occurred reading/writing to a socket. Maybe the server closed it, or you're not connected to
       any server.
       2. An error occurred parsing the response of an IMAP command. This is usually only a problem if your IMAP
       server returns invalid data.
       3. An IMAP command didn't return an 'OK' response.
       4. The socket read operation timed out waiting for a response from the server.

       In each case, some readable form of error text is placed in $@, or you can  call  the  "get_last_error()"
       method.  For  commands which return responses (e.g. fetch, getacl, etc), the result is returned. See each
       command for details of the response result. For commands with no response but which succeed (e.g. setacl,
       rename, etc) the result 'ok' is generally returned.

   <b>Method</b> <b>parameters</b>
       All methods which send data to the IMAP server (e.g. "fetch()", "search()",  etc)  have  their  arguments
       processed before they are sent. Arguments may be specified in several ways:

       <b>scalar</b>
           The  value  is first checked and quoted if required. Values containing [\000\012\015] are turned into
           literals, values containing [\000-\040\{\} \%\*\"] are quoted by surrounding with a "..." pair (any "
           themselves are turned into \"). undef is turned into NIL

       <b>file</b> <b>ref</b>
           The contents of the file is sent as an IMAP literal. Note that  because  IMAPTalk  has  to  know  the
           length  of  the  file  being sent, this must be a true file reference that can be seeked and not just
           some stream. The entire file will be sent regardless of the current seek point.

       <b>scalar</b> <b>ref</b>
           The string/data in the referenced item should be sent as is, no quoting  will  occur,  and  the  data
           won't be sent as quoted or as a literal regardless of the contents of the string/data.

       <b>array</b> <b>ref</b>
           Emits an opening bracket, and then each item in the array separated by a space, and finally a closing
           bracket.  Each  item  in  the  array  is processed by the same methods, so can be a scalar, file ref,
           scalar ref, another array ref, etc.

       <b>hash</b> <b>ref</b>
           The hash reference should contain only 1 item. The key is a text string which specifies  what  to  do
           with the value item of the hash.

           •   'Literal'

               The  string/data  in  the  value  is sent as an IMAP literal regardless of the actual data in the
               string/data.

           •   'Quote'

               The string/data in the value is sent as an IMAP quoted string regardless of the  actual  data  in
               the string/data.

           Examples:

               # Password is automatically quoted to "nasty%*\"passwd"
               $IMAP-&gt;login("joe", 'nasty%*"passwd');
               # Append $MsgTxt as string
               $IMAP-&gt;append("inbox", { Literal =&gt; $MsgTxt })
               # Append MSGFILE contents as new message
               $IMAP-&gt;append("inbox", \*MSGFILE ])

</pre><h4><b>CONSTANTS</b></h4><pre>
       These  constants  relate  to the standard 4 states that an IMAP connection can be in. They are passed and
       returned from the "state()" method. See RFC 3501 for more details about IMAP connection states.

       <u>Unconnected</u>
           Current not connected to any server.

       <u>Connected</u>
           Connected to a server, but not logged in.

       <u>Authenticated</u>
           Connected and logged into a server, but not current folder.

       <u>Selected</u>
           Connected, logged in and have 'select'ed a current folder.

</pre><h4><b>CONSTRUCTOR</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Mail::IMAPTalk-&gt;new(%Options)</u>
           Creates new Mail::IMAPTalk object. The following options are supported.

       <b>Connection</b> <b>Options</b>
           <b>Server</b>
               The hostname or IP address to connect to. This must be  supplied  unless  the  <b>Socket</b>  option  is
               supplied.

           <b>Port</b>
               The port number on the host to connect to. Defaults to 143 if not supplied or 993 if not supplied
               and UseSSL is true.

           <b>UseSSL</b>
               If  true,  use  an  IO::Socket::SSL  connection.  All  other  SSL_*  arguments  are passed to the
               IO::Socket::SSL constructor.

           <b>Socket</b>
               An existing socket to use as the connection to the IMAP server. If you supply the <b>Socket</b>  option,
               you should not supply a <b>Server</b> or <b>Port</b> option.

               This is useful if you want to create an SSL socket connection using IO::Socket::SSL and then pass
               in the connected socket to the <b>new()</b> call.

               It's  also  useful  in conjunction with the "release_socket()" method described below for reusing
               the same socket beyond the lifetime of the IMAPTalk object. See  a  description  in  the  section
               "release_socket()" method for more information.

               You  must  have  write  flushing  enabled  for  any socket you pass in here so that commands will
               actually be sent, and responses received, rather than just waiting and eventually timing out. you
               can do this using the Perl "select()" call and $| ($AUTOFLUSH) variable as shown below.

                 my $ofh = select($Socket); $| = 1; select ($ofh);

           <b>UseBlocking</b>
               For historical reasons, when reading from a socket, the module sets the  socket  to  non-blocking
               and  does  a  <b>select()</b>.  If  you're  using  an  SSL  socket that doesn't work, so you have to set
               UseBlocking to true to use blocking reads instead.

           <b>State</b>
               If you supply a "Socket" option, you can specify the IMAP  state  the  socket  is  currently  in,
               namely  one  of  'Unconnected',  'Connected',  'Authenticated'  or  'Selected'.  This defaults to
               'Connected' if not supplied and the "Socket" option is supplied.

           <b>ExpectGreeting</b>
               If supplied and true, and a socket is supplied via the "Socket" option, checks  that  a  greeting
               line is supplied by the server and reads the greeting line.

           <b>PreserveINBOX</b>
               For  historical reasons, the special name "INBOX" is rewritten as Inbox because it looks nicer on
               the way out, and back on the way in.  If you want to preserve the name INBOX on the outside,  set
               this flag to true.

           <b>UseCompress</b>
               If  you have the Compress::Zlib package installed, and the server supports compress, then setting
               this flag to true will cause compression to be enabled immediately after login.

       <b>Login</b> <b>Options</b>
           <b>Username</b>
               The username to connect to the IMAP server as. If not supplied, no login  is  attempted  and  the
               IMAP  object  is  left  in  the  <b>CONNECTED</b> state.  If supplied, you must also supply the <b>Password</b>
               option and a login is attempted. If the login fails,  the  connection  is  closed  and  <b>undef</b>  is
               returned.  If  you  want  to do something with a connection even if the login fails, don't pass a
               <b>Username</b> option, but instead use the <b>login</b> method described below.

           <b>Password</b>
               The password to use to login to the account.

           <b>AsUser</b>
               If the server supports it, access the server as this user rather than the authenticate user.

           See the "login" method for more information.

       <b>IMAP</b> <b>message/folder</b> <b>options</b>
           <b>Uid</b> Control whether message ids are message uids or not. This is 1 (on) by default because  generally
               that's how most people want to use it. This affects most commands that require/use/return message
               ids (e.g. <b>fetch</b>, <b>search</b>, <b>sort</b>, etc)

           <b>RootFolder</b>
               If  supplied,  sets  the root folder prefix. This is the same as calling "set_root_folder()" with
               the value passed. If no value is supplied, "set_root_folder()" is called with no value.  See  the
               "set_root_folder()" method for more details.

           <b>Separator</b>
               If  supplied,  sets  the  folder  name  text  string  separator  character.  Passed as the second
               parameter to the "set_root_folder()" method.

           <b>AltRootRegexp</b>
               If supplied, passed along with RootFolder to the "set_root_folder()" method.

           Examples:

             $imap = Mail::IMAPTalk-&gt;new(
               Server          =&gt; 'foo.com',
               Port            =&gt; 143,
               Username        =&gt; 'joebloggs',
               Password        =&gt; 'mypassword',
               Separator       =&gt; '.',
               RootFolder      =&gt; 'INBOX',
             ) || die "Connection to foo.com failed. Reason: $@";

             $imap = Mail::IMAPTalk-&gt;new(
               Socket =&gt; $SSLSocket,
               State  =&gt; Mail::IMAPTalk::Authenticated,
               Uid    =&gt; 0
             ) || die "Could not query on existing socket. Reason: $@";

</pre><h4><b>CONNECTION</b> <b>CONTROL</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>login($User,</u> <u>$Password,</u> <u>[$AsUser])</u>
           Attempt to login user specified username and password.

           The actual authentication may be done using the "LOGIN" or "AUTHENTICATE" commands, depending on what
           the server advertises support for.

           If $AsUser is supplied, an attempt will be made to login on behalf of that user.

       <u><b>logout()</b></u>
           Log out of IMAP server. This usually closes the servers connection as well.

       <u>state(optional</u> <u>$State)</u>
           Set/get the current IMAP connection state. Returned or passed value should be one  of  the  constants
           (Unconnected, Connected, Authenticated, Selected).

       <u>uid(optional</u> <u>$UidMode)</u>
           Get/set  the UID status of all UID possible IMAP commands.  If set to 1, all commands that can take a
           UID are set to 'UID Mode', where any ID sent to IMAPTalk is assumed to be a UID.

       <u><b>capability()</b></u>
           This method returns the IMAP servers capability command results.  The result is a hash  reference  of
           (lc(Capability) =&gt; 1) key value pairs.  This means you can do things like:

             if ($IMAP-&gt;capability()-&gt;{quota}) { ... }

           to test if the server has the QUOTA capability. If you just want a list of capabilities, use the Perl
           'keys' function to get a list of keys from the returned hash reference.

       <u><b>namespace()</b></u>
           Returns the result of the IMAP servers namespace command.

       <u><b>noop()</b></u>
           Perform the standard IMAP 'noop' command which does nothing.

       <u>enable($option)</u>
           Enabled the given imap extension

       <u><b>is_open()</b></u>
           Returns  true if the current socket connection is still open (e.g. the socket hasn't been closed this
           end or the other end due to a timeout).

       <u>set_root_folder($RootFolder,</u> <u>$Separator,</u> <u>$AltRootRegexp)</u>
           Change the root folder prefix. Some IMAP servers require that all user folders/mailboxes live under a
           root folder prefix (current versions of <b>cyrus</b> for example use 'INBOX' for personal folders and 'user'
           for other users folders). If no value is specified, it sets it to ''.  You  might  want  to  use  the
           <b>namespace()</b> method to find out what roots are available.

           Setting  this  affects  all  commands that take a folder argument. Basically if the foldername begins
           with root folder prefix, it's left as is, otherwise the root folder prefix  and  separator  char  are
           prefixed to the folder name.

           The AltRootRegexp is a regexp that if the start of the folder name matches, does not have $RootFolder
           preprended. You can use this to protect other namespaces in your IMAP server.

           Examples:

             # This is what cyrus uses
             $IMAP-&gt;set_root_folder('INBOX', '.', qr/^user/);

             # Selects 'Inbox' (because 'Inbox' eq 'inbox' case insensitive)
             $IMAP-&gt;select('Inbox');
             # Selects 'INBOX.blah'
             $IMAP-&gt;select('blah');
             # Selects 'INBOX.Inbox.fred'
             #IMAP-&gt;select('Inbox.fred');
             # Selects 'user.john' (because 'user' is alt root)
             #IMAP-&gt;select('user.john'); # Selects 'user.john'

       <b>_</b><u>set_separator($Separator)</u>
           Checks  if  the  given  separator  is  the  same  as  the  one  we  used  before.   If  not, it calls
           set_root_folder to recreate the settings with the new Separator.

       <u>literal_handle_control(optional</u> <u>$FileHandle)</u>
           Sets the mode whether to read literals as file handles or scalars.

           You should pass a filehandle here that any literal will be read into. To turn off literal reads  into
           a file handle, pass a 0.

           Examples:

             # Read rfc822 text of message 3 into file
             # (note that the file will have /r/n line terminators)
             open(F, "&gt;messagebody.txt");
             $IMAP-&gt;literal_handle_control(\*F);
             $IMAP-&gt;fetch(3, 'rfc822');
             $IMAP-&gt;<a href="../man0/literal_handle_control.0.html">literal_handle_control</a>(0);

       <u>release_socket($Close)</u>
           Release  IMAPTalk's  ownership  of the current socket it's using so it's not disconnected on DESTROY.
           This returns the socket, and makes sure that the IMAPTalk object doesn't hold a reference to  it  any
           more and the connection state is set to "Unconnected".

           This means you can't call any methods on the IMAPTalk object any more.

           If the socket is being released and being closed, then $Close is set to true.

       <u><b>get_last_error()</b></u>
           Returns a text string which describes the last error that occurred.

       <u><b>get_last_completion_response()</b></u>
           Returns the last completion response to the tagged command.

           This is either the string "ok", "no" or "bad" (always lower case)

       <u>get_response_code($Response)</u>
           Returns  the  extra response data generated by a previous call. This is most often used after calling
           <b>select</b> which usually generates some set of the following sub-results.

           •   <b>permanentflags</b>

               Array reference of flags which are stored permanently.

           •   <b>uidvalidity</b>

               Whether the current UID set is valid. See the IMAP RFC for more  information  on  this.  If  this
               value changes, then all UIDs in the folder have been changed.

           •   <b>uidnext</b>

               The next UID number that will be assigned.

           •   <b>exists</b>

               Number of messages that exist in the folder.

           •   <b>recent</b>

               Number of messages that are recent in the folder.

           Other possible responses are <b>alert</b>, <b>newname</b>, <b>parse</b>, <b>trycreate</b>, <b>appenduid</b>, etc.

           The  values  are stored in a hash keyed on the $Response item.  They're kept until either overwritten
           by a future response, or explicitly cleared via <b>clear_response_code()</b>.

           Examples:

             # Select inbox and get list of permanent flags, uidnext and number
             #  of message in the folder
             $IMAP-&gt;select('inbox');
             my $NMessages = $IMAP-&gt;get_response_code('exists');
             my $PermanentFlags = $IMAP-&gt;get_response_code('permanentflags');
             my $UidNext = $IMAP-&gt;get_response_code('uidnext');

       <u>clear_response_code($Response)</u>
           Clears any response code information. Response code  information  is  not  normally  cleared  between
           calls.

       <u>parse_mode(ParseOption</u> <u>=&gt;</u> <u>$ParseMode)</u>
           Changes how results of fetch commands are parsed. Available options are:

           <u>BodyStructure</u>
               Parse bodystructure into more Perl-friendly structure See the <b>FETCH</b> <b>RESULTS</b> section.

           <u>Envelope</u>
               Parse envelopes into more Perl-friendly structure See the <b>FETCH</b> <b>RESULTS</b> section.

           <u>Annotation</u>
               Parse annotation (from RFC 5257) into more Perl-friendly structure See the <b>FETCH</b> <b>RESULTS</b> section.

           <u>EnvelopeRaw</u>
               If  parsing envelopes, create To/Cc/Bcc and Raw-To/Raw-Cc/Raw-Bcc entries which are array refs of
               4 entries each as returned by the IMAP server.

           <u>DecodeUTF8</u>
               If parsing envelopes, decode any MIME encoded headers into Perl UTF-8 strings.

               For this to work, you must have 'used' Mail::IMAPTalk with:

               use Mail::IMAPTalk qw(:utf8support ...)

       <u>set_tracing($Tracer)</u>
           Allows you to trace both IMAP input and output sent to the server and returned from the server.  This
           is  useful  for  debugging.  Returns  the previous value of the tracer and then sets it to the passed
           value. Possible values for $Tracer are:

           <u>0</u>   Disable all tracing.

           <u>1</u>   Print to STDERR.

           <u>Code</u> <u>ref</u>
               Call code ref for each line input and output. Pass line as parameter.

           <u>Glob</u> <u>ref</u>
               Print to glob.

           <u>Scalar</u> <u>ref</u>
               Appends to the referenced scalar.

           Note: literals are never passed to the tracer.

       <u>set_unicode_folders($Unicode)</u>
           $Unicode should be 1 or 0

           Sets whether folder names are expected and returned as perl unicode strings.

           The default is currently 0, BUT YOU SHOULD NOT ASSUME THIS, because it will probably  change  in  the
           future.

           If you want to work with perl unicode strings for folder names, you should call
             $ImapTalk-&gt;<b><a href="../man1/set_unicode_folders.1.html">set_unicode_folders</a></b>(1)  and  IMAPTalk will automatically encode the unicode strings into
           IMAP-UTF7 when sending to the IMAP server, and will also decode  IMAP-UTF7  back  into  perl  unicode
           strings when returning results from the IMAP server.

           If you want to work with folder names in IMAP-UTF7 bytes, then call
             $ImapTalk-&gt;<b><a href="../man0/set_unicode_folders.0.html">set_unicode_folders</a></b>(0) and IMAPTalk will leave folder names as bytes when sending to and
           returning results from the IMAP server.

</pre><h4><b>IMAP</b> <b>FOLDER</b> <b>COMMAND</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Note:</b>  In  all  cases  where a folder name is used, the folder name is first manipulated according to the
       current root folder prefix as described in "set_root_folder()".

       <u>select($FolderName,</u> <u>@Opts)</u>
           Perform the standard IMAP 'select' command to select a folder for retrieving/moving/adding  messages.
           If $Opts{ReadOnly} is true, the IMAP EXAMINE verb is used instead of SELECT.

           Mail::IMAPTalk will cache the currently selected folder, and if you issue another -&gt;select("XYZ") for
           the  folder  that  is  already  selected, it will just return immediately. This can confuse code that
           expects to get side effects  of  a  select  call.  For  that  case,  call  -&gt;<b>unselect()</b>  first,  then
           -&gt;<b>select()</b>.

       <u><b>unselect()</b></u>
           Performs the standard IMAP unselect command.

       <u>examine($FolderName)</u>
           Perform  the  standard  IMAP  'examine'  command  to select a folder in read only mode for retrieving
           messages. This is the same as "select($FolderName, 1)".  See "select()" for more details.

       <u>create($FolderName)</u>
           Perform the standard IMAP 'create' command to create a new folder.

       <u>delete($FolderName)</u>
           Perform the standard IMAP 'delete' command to delete a folder.

       <u>localdelete($FolderName)</u>
           Perform the IMAP 'localdelete' command to delete a folder (doesn't delete subfolders even  of  INBOX,
           is always immediate.

       <u>rename($OldFolderName,</u> <u>$NewFolderName)</u>
           Perform the standard IMAP 'rename' command to rename a folder.

       <u>list($Reference,</u> <u>$Name)</u>
           Perform the standard IMAP 'list' command to return a list of available folders.

       <u>xlist($Reference,</u> <u>$Name)</u>
           Perform  the  IMAP  'xlist' extension command to return a list of available folders and their special
           use attributes.

       <u>id($key</u> <u>=</u> $value, ...)&gt;
           Perform the IMAP extension command 'id'

       <u>lsub($Reference,</u> <u>$Name)</u>
           Perform the standard IMAP 'lsub' command to return a list of subscribed folders

       <u>subscribe($FolderName)</u>
           Perform the standard IMAP 'subscribe' command to subscribe to a folder.

       <u>unsubscribe($FolderName)</u>
           Perform the standard IMAP 'unsubscribe' command to unsubscribe from a folder.

       <u><b>check()</b></u>
           Perform the standard IMAP 'check' command to checkpoint the current folder.

       <u>setacl($FolderName,</u> <u>$User,</u> <u>$Rights)</u>
           Perform the IMAP 'setacl' command to set the access control list details of a folder/mailbox. See RFC
           4314 for more details on the IMAP ACL extension. $User is the user name to set the access rights for.
           $Rights is either a list of absolute rights to set, or a list prefixed by a - to remove those rights,
           or a + to add those rights.

           l - lookup (mailbox is visible to LIST/LSUB commands)
           r - read (SELECT the mailbox, perform CHECK, FETCH, PARTIAL, SEARCH, COPY from mailbox)
           s - keep seen/unseen information across sessions (STORE SEEN flag)
           w - write (STORE flags other than SEEN and DELETED)
           i - insert (perform APPEND, COPY into mailbox)
           p - post (send mail to submission address for mailbox, not enforced by IMAP4 itself)
           k - create mailboxes (CREATE new sub-mailboxes in any implementation-defined hierarchy, parent
           mailbox for the new mailbox name in RENAME)
           x - delete mailbox (DELETE mailbox, old mailbox name in RENAME)
           t - delete messages (set or clear \DELETED flag via STORE, set \DELETED flag during APPEND/COPY)
           e - perform EXPUNGE and expunge as a part of CLOSE
           a - administer (perform SETACL)

           Due to ambiguity in RFC 2086, some existing RFC 2086 server implementations  use  the  "c"  right  to
           control the DELETE command.  Others chose to use the "d" right to control the DELETE command. See the
           2.1.1. Obsolete Rights in RFC 4314 for more details.

           c - create (CREATE new sub-mailboxes in any implementation-defined hierarchy)
           d - delete (STORE DELETED flag, perform EXPUNGE)

           The standard access control configurations for cyrus are

           read   = "lrs"
           post   = "lrsp"
           append = "lrsip"
           write  = "lrswipcd"
           all    = "lrswipcda"

           Examples:

             # Get full access for user 'joe' on his own folder
             $IMAP-&gt;setacl('user.joe', 'joe', 'lrswipcda') || die "IMAP error: $@";
             # Remove write, insert, post, create, delete access for user 'andrew'
             $IMAP-&gt;setacl('user.joe', 'andrew', '-wipcd') || die "IMAP error: $@";
             # Add lookup, read, keep unseen information for user 'paul'
             $IMAP-&gt;setacl('user.joe', 'paul', '+lrs') || die "IMAP error: $@";

       <u>getacl($FolderName)</u>
           Perform the IMAP 'getacl' command to get the access control list details of a folder/mailbox. See RFC
           4314  for  more details on the IMAP ACL extension. Returns an array of pairs. Each pair is a username
           followed by the access rights for that user. See <b>setacl</b> for more information on access rights.

           Examples:

             my $Rights = $IMAP-&gt;getacl('user.joe') || die "IMAP error : $@";
             $Rights = [
               'joe', 'lrs',
               'andrew', 'lrswipcda'
             ];

             $IMAP-&gt;setacl('user.joe', 'joe', 'lrswipcda') || die "IMAP error : $@";
             $IMAP-&gt;setacl('user.joe', 'andrew', '-wipcd') || die "IMAP error : $@";
             $IMAP-&gt;setacl('user.joe', 'paul', '+lrs') || die "IMAP error : $@";

             $Rights = $IMAP-&gt;getacl('user.joe') || die "IMAP error : $@";
             $Rights = [
               'joe', 'lrswipcd',
               'andrew', 'lrs',
               'paul', 'lrs'
             ];

       <u>deleteacl($FolderName,</u> <u>$Username)</u>
           Perform the IMAP 'deleteacl' command to delete all access control information for the given  user  on
           the given folder. See <b>setacl</b> for more information on access rights.

           Examples:

             my $Rights = $IMAP-&gt;getacl('user.joe') || die "IMAP error : $@";
             $Rights = [
               'joe', 'lrswipcd',
               'andrew', 'lrs',
               'paul', 'lrs'
             ];

             # Delete access information for user 'andrew'
             $IMAP-&gt;deleteacl('user.joe', 'andrew') || die "IMAP error : $@";

             $Rights = $IMAP-&gt;getacl('user.joe') || die "IMAP error : $@";
             $Rights = [
               'joe', 'lrswipcd',
               'paul', 'lrs'
             ];

       <u>setquota($FolderName,</u> <u>$QuotaDetails)</u>
           Perform  the IMAP 'setquota' command to set the usage quota details of a folder/mailbox. See RFC 2087
           for details of the IMAP quota extension. $QuotaDetails is a bracketed list of limit item/value  pairs
           which represent a particular type of limit and the value to set it to. Current limits are:

           STORAGE - Sum of messages' RFC822.SIZE, in units of 1024 octets
           MESSAGE - Number of messages

           Examples:

             # Set maximum size of folder to 50M and 1000 messages
             $IMAP-&gt;setquota('user.joe', '(storage 50000)') || die "IMAP error: $@";
             $IMAP-&gt;setquota('user.john', '(messages 1000)') || die "IMAP error: $@";
             # Remove quotas
             $IMAP-&gt;setquota('user.joe', '()') || die "IMAP error: $@";

       <u>getquota($FolderName)</u>
           Perform  the  standard  IMAP 'getquota' command to get the quota details of a folder/mailbox. See RFC
           2087 for details of the IMAP quota extension. Returns an array reference  to  quota  limit  triplets.
           Each triplet is made of: limit item, current value, maximum value.

           Note  that  this  only  returns the quota for a folder if it actually has had a quota set on it. It's
           possible that a parent folder might  have  a  quota  as  well  which  affects  sub-folders.  Use  the
           getquotaroot to find out if this is true.

           Examples:

             my $Result = $IMAP-&gt;getquota('user.joe') || die "IMAP error: $@";
             $Result = [
               'STORAGE', 31, 50000,
               'MESSAGE', 5, 1000
             ];

       <u>getquotaroot($FolderName)</u>
           Perform  the  IMAP  'getquotaroot'  command to get the quota details of a folder/mailbox and possible
           root quota as well.  See RFC 2087 for details of the IMAP quota extension. The result of this command
           is a little complex.  Unfortunately it doesn't map really easily into any structure since  there  are
           several different responses.

           Basically  it's  a  hash  reference. The 'quotaroot' item is the response which lists the root quotas
           that apply to the given folder. The first item is the folder name, and the remaining  items  are  the
           quota  root  items. There is then a hash item for each quota root item. It's probably easiest to look
           at the example below.

           Examples:

             my $Result = $IMAP-&gt;getquotaroot('user.joe.blah') || die "IMAP error: $@";
             $Result = {
               'quotaroot' =&gt; [
                 'user.joe.blah', 'user.joe', ''
               ],
               'user.joe' =&gt; [
                 'STORAGE', 31, 50000,
                 'MESSAGES', 5, 1000
               ],
               '' =&gt; [
                 'MESSAGES', 3498, 100000
               ]
             };

       <u>message_count($FolderName)</u>
           Return the number of messages in a folder. See also "status()" for  getting  more  information  about
           messages in a folder.

       <u>status($FolderName,</u> <u>$StatusList)</u>
           Perform the standard IMAP 'status' command to retrieve status information about a folder/mailbox.

           The  $StatusList is a bracketed list of folder items to obtain the status of.  Can contain: messages,
           recent, uidnext, uidvalidity, unseen.

           The return value is a hash reference of lc(status-item) =&gt; value.

           Examples:

             my $Res = $IMAP-&gt;status('inbox', '(MESSAGES UNSEEN)');

             $Res = {
               'messages' =&gt; 8,
               'unseen' =&gt; 2
             };

       <u>multistatus($StatusList,</u> <u>@FolderNames)</u>
           Performs many IMAP 'status' commands on a list of folders. Sends all the commands at  once  and  wait
           for responses. This speeds up latency issues.

           Returns a hash ref of folder name =&gt; status results.

           If  an  error  occurs,  the  annotation  result is a scalar ref to the completion response string (eg
           'bad', 'no', etc)

       <u>getannotation($FolderName,</u> <u>$Entry,</u> <u>$Attribute)</u>
           Perform the IMAP 'getannotation'  command  to  get  the  annotation(s)  for  a  mailbox.   See  imap-
           annotatemore extension for details.

           Examples:

             my $Result = $IMAP-&gt;getannotation('user.joe.blah', '/*' '*') || die "IMAP error: $@";
             $Result = {
               'user.joe.blah' =&gt; {
                 '/vendor/cmu/cyrus-imapd/size' =&gt; {
                   'size.shared' =&gt; '5',
                   'content-type.shared' =&gt; 'text/plain',
                   'value.shared' =&gt; '19261'
                 },
                 '/vendor/cmu/cyrus-imapd/lastupdate' =&gt; {
                   'size.shared' =&gt; '26',
                   'content-type.shared' =&gt; 'text/plain',
                   'value.shared' =&gt; '26-Mar-2004 13:31:56 -0800'
                 },
                 '/vendor/cmu/cyrus-imapd/partition' =&gt; {
                   'size.shared' =&gt; '7',
                   'content-type.shared' =&gt; 'text/plain',
                   'value.shared' =&gt; 'default'
                 }
               }
             };

       <u>getmetadata($FolderName,</u> <u>[</u> <u>\%Options</u> <u>],</u> <u>@Entries)</u>
           Perform  the  IMAP  'getmetadata'  command to get the metadata items for a mailbox.  See RFC 5464 for
           details.

           If $Options is passed, it is a hashref of options to set.

           If foldername is the empty string, gets server annotations

           Examples:

             my $Result = $IMAP-&gt;getmetadata('user.joe.blah', {depth =&gt; 'infinity'}, '/shared') || die "IMAP error: $@";
             $Result = {
               'user.joe.blah' =&gt; {
                 '/shared/vendor/cmu/cyrus-imapd/size' =&gt; '19261',
                 '/shared/vendor/cmu/cyrus-imapd/lastupdate' =&gt; '26-Mar-2004 13:31:56 -0800',
                 '/shared/vendor/cmu/cyrus-imapd/partition' =&gt; 'default',
               }
             };

             my $Result = $IMAP-&gt;getmetadata('', "/shared/comment");
             $Result =&gt; {
               '' =&gt; {
                 '/shared/comment' =&gt; "Shared comment",
               }
             };

       <u>multigetmetadata(\@Entries,</u> <u>@FolderNames)</u>
           Performs many IMAP 'getmetadata' commands on a list of folders. Sends all the commands  at  once  and
           wait for responses. This speeds up latency issues.

           Returns a hash ref of folder name =&gt; metadata results.

           If  an  error  occurs,  the  annotation  result is a scalar ref to the completion response string (eg
           'bad', 'no', etc)

       <u>setannotation($FolderName,</u> <u>$Entry,</u> <u>[</u> <u>$Attribute,</u> <u>$Value</u> <u>])</u>
           Perform the IMAP 'setannotation'  command  to  get  the  annotation(s)  for  a  mailbox.   See  imap-
           annotatemore extension for details.

           Examples:

             my $Result = $IMAP-&gt;setannotation('user.joe.blah', '/comment', [ 'value.priv' 'A comment' ])

       <u>setmetadata($FolderName,</u> <u>$Name,</u> <u>$Value,</u> <u>$Name2,</u> <u>$Value2)</u>
           Perform the IMAP 'setmetadata' command.  See RFC 5464 for details.

           Examples:

             my $Result = $IMAP-&gt;setmetadata('user.joe.blah', '/comment', 'A comment')
               || die "IMAP error: $@";

       <u><b>close()</b></u>
           Perform  the  standard  IMAP  'close' command to expunge deleted messages from the current folder and
           return to the Authenticated state.

       <u>idle(\&amp;Callback,</u> <u>[</u> <u>$Timeout</u> <u>])</u>
           Perform an IMAP idle call. Call given callback for each IDLE event received.

           If the callback returns 0, the idle continues. If the callback returns 1, the idle  is  finished  and
           this call returns.

           If  no  timeout  is  passed,  will  continue  to  idle  until  the  callback  returns 1 or the server
           disconnects.

           If a timeout is passed (including a 0 timeout), the call will return if no events are received within
           the   given   time.   It   will   return   the   result   of    the    DONE    command,    and    set
           $Self-&gt;get_response_code('timeout') to true.

           If  the server closes the connection with a "bye" response, it will return undef and $@ =~ /bye/ will
           be true with the remainder of the bye line following.

</pre><h4><b>IMAP</b> <b>MESSAGE</b> <b>COMMAND</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>fetch([</u> <u>\%ParseMode</u> <u>],</u> <u>$MessageIds,</u> <u>$MessageItems)</u>
           Perform the standard IMAP 'fetch' command to retrieve the specified message items from the  specified
           message IDs.

           The first parameter can be an optional hash reference that overrides particular parse mode parameters
           just for this fetch. See "parse_mode" for possible keys.

           $MessageIds can be one of two forms:

           1.  A  text string with a comma separated list of message ID's or message ranges separated by colons.
               A '*' represents the highest message number.

               Examples:

               •   '1' - first message

               •   '1,2,5'

               •   '1:*' - all messages

               •   '1,3:*' - all but message 2

               Note that , separated lists and : separated ranges can be mixed, but to make sure a certain  hack
               works, if a '*' is used, it must be the last character in the string.

           2.  An  array  reference  with  a  list  of message ID's or ranges. The array contents are "join(',',
               ...)"ed together.

           Note: If the "uid()" state has been set to true, then all message ID's must be message UIDs.

           $MessageItems can be one of, or a bracketed list of:

           •   uid

           •   flags

           •   internaldate

           •   envelope

           •   bodystructure

           •   body

           •   body[section]&lt;partial&gt;

           •   body.peek[section]&lt;partial&gt;

           •   rfc822

           •   rfc822.header

           •   rfc822.size

           •   rfc822.text

           •   fast

           •   all

           •   full

           It would be a good idea to see RFC 3501 for what all these means.

           Examples:

             my $Res = $IMAP-&gt;fetch('1:*', 'rfc822.size');
             my $Res = $IMAP-&gt;fetch([1,2,3], '(bodystructure envelope)');

           Return results:

           The results returned by the IMAP server are parsed into a Perl  structure.   See  the  section  <b>FETCH</b>
           <b>RESULTS</b> for all the interesting details.

           Note  that  message  can  disappear on you, so you may not get back all the entries you expect in the
           hash

           There is one piece of magic. If your request is for a single uid, (eg "123"), and no data is  return,
           we return undef, because it's easier to handle as an error condition.

       <u>copy($MsgIds,</u> <u>$ToFolder)</u>
           Perform standard IMAP copy command to copy a set of messages from one folder to another.

       <u>append($FolderName,</u> <u>optional</u> <u>$MsgFlags,</u> <u>optional</u> <u>$MsgDate,</u> <u>$MessageData)</u>
           Perform standard IMAP append command to append a new message into a folder.

           The  $MessageData to append can either be a Perl scalar containing the data, or a file handle to read
           the data from. In each case, the data must be in proper RFC 822 format with \r\n line terminators.

           Any optional fields not needed should be removed, not left blank.

           Examples:

             # msg.txt should have \r\n line terminators
             open(F, "msg.txt");
             $IMAP-&gt;append('inbox', \*F);

             my $MsgTxt =&lt;&lt;MSG;
             From: blah\@xyz.com
             To: whoever\@whereever.com
             ...
             MSG

             $MsgTxt =~ s/\n/\015\012/g;
             $IMAP-&gt;append('inbox', { Literal =&gt; $MsgTxt });

       <u>search($MsgIdSet,</u> <u>@SearchCriteria)</u>
           Perform standard IMAP search command. The result is an array reference to a list of message  IDs  (or
           UIDs if in Uid mode) of messages that are in the $MsgIdSet and also meet the search criteria.

           @SearchCriteria  is  a  list  of search specifications, for example to look for ASCII messages bigger
           than 2000 bytes you would set the list to be:

             my @SearchCriteria = ('CHARSET', 'US-ASCII', 'LARGER', '2000');

           Examples:

             my $Res = $IMAP-&gt;search('1:*', 'NOT', 'DELETED');
             $Res = [ 1, 2, 5 ];

       <u>store($MsgIdSet,</u> <u>$FlagOperation,</u> <u>$Flags)</u>
           Perform standard IMAP store command. Changes the flags associated with a set of messages.

           Examples:

             $IMAP-&gt;store('1:*', '+flags', '(\\deleted)');
             $IMAP-&gt;store('1:*', '-flags.silent', '(\\read)');

       <u><b>expunge()</b></u>
           Perform standard IMAP expunge command. This actually deletes any messages marked as deleted.

       <u>uidexpunge($MsgIdSet)</u>
           Perform IMAP uid expunge command as per RFC 2359.

       <u>sort($SortField,</u> <u>$CharSet,</u> <u>@SearchCriteria)</u>
           Perform extension IMAP sort command. The result is an array reference to a list of  message  IDs  (or
           UIDs if in Uid mode) in sorted order.

           It  would  probably  be  a  good  idea  to  look  at  the  sort  RFC 5256 details at somewhere like :
           <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5256.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5256.txt</a>

           Examples:

             my $Res = $IMAP-&gt;sort('(subject)', 'US-ASCII', 'NOT', 'DELETED');
             $Res = [ 5, 2, 3, 1, 4 ];

       <u>thread($ThreadType,</u> <u>$CharSet,</u> <u>@SearchCriteria)</u>
           Perform  extension  IMAP  thread  command.  The  $ThreadType  should  be  one  of   'REFERENCES'   or
           'ORDEREDSUBJECT'. You should check the "capability()" of the server to see if it supports one or both
           of these.

           Examples

             my $Res = $IMAP-&gt;thread('REFERENCES', 'US-ASCII', 'NOT', 'DELETED');
             $Res = [ [10, 15, 20], [11], [ [ 12, 16 ], [13, 17] ];

       <u>fetch_flags($MessageIds)</u>
           Perform an IMAP 'fetch flags' command to retrieve the specified flags for the specified messages.

           This is just a special fast path version of "fetch".

       <u>fetch_meta($MessageIds,</u> <u>@MetaItems)</u>
           Perform an IMAP 'fetch' command to retrieve the specified meta items. These must be simple items that
           return only atoms (eg no flags, bodystructure, body, envelope, etc)

           This is just a special fast path version of "fetch".

</pre><h4><b>IMAP</b> <b>HELPER</b> <b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>get_body_part($BodyStruct,</u> <u>$PartNum)</u>
           This is a helper function that can be used to further parse the results of a  fetched  bodystructure.
           Given  a  top  level body structure, and a part number, it returns the reference to the bodystructure
           sub part which that part number refers to.

           Examples:

             # Fetch body structure
             my $FR = $IMAP-&gt;fetch(1, 'bodystructure');
             my $BS = $FR-&gt;{1}-&gt;{bodystructure};

             # Parse further to find particular sub part
             my $P12 = $IMAP-&gt;get_body_part($BS, '1.2');
             $P12-&gt;{'IMAP-&gt;Partnum'} eq '1.2' || die "Unexpected IMAP part number";

       <u>find_message($BodyStruct)</u>
           This is a helper function that can be used to further parse the results of a  fetched  bodystructure.
           It returns a hash reference with the following items.

             text =&gt; $best_text_part
             html =&gt; $best_html_part (optional)
             textlist =&gt; [ ... text/html (if no alt text bits)/image (if inline) parts ... ]
             htmllist =&gt; [ ... text (if no alt html bits)/html/image (if inline) parts ... ]
             att =&gt; [ {
                bs =&gt; $part, text =&gt; 0/1, html =&gt; 0/1, msg =&gt; 1/0,
              }, { ... }, ... ]

           For  instance,  consider  a message with text and html pages that's then gone through a list software
           manager that attaches a header/footer

             multipart/mixed
               text/plain, cd=inline - A
               multipart/mixed
                 multipart/alternative
                   multipart/mixed
                     text/plain, cd=inline - B
                     image/jpeg, cd=inline - C
                     text/plain, cd=inline - D
                   multipart/related
                     text/html - E
                     image/jpeg - F
                 image/jpeg, cd=attachment - G
                 application/x-excel - H
                 message/rfc822 - J
               text/plain, cd=inline - K

           In this case, we'd have the following list items

             text =&gt; B
             html =&gt; E
             textlist =&gt; [ A, B, C, D, K ]
             htmllist =&gt; [ A, E, K ]
             att =&gt; [
               { bs =&gt; C, text =&gt; 1, html =&gt; 1 },
               { bs =&gt; F, text =&gt; 1, html =&gt; 0 },
               { bs =&gt; G, text =&gt; 1, html =&gt; 1 },
               { bs =&gt; H, text =&gt; 1, html =&gt; 1 },
               { bs =&gt; J, text =&gt; 0, html =&gt; 0, msg =&gt; 1 },
             ]

           Examples:

             # Fetch body structure
             my $FR = $IMAP-&gt;fetch(1, 'bodystructure');
             my $BS = $FR-&gt;{1}-&gt;{bodystructure};

             # Parse further to find message components
             my $MC = $IMAP-&gt;find_message($BS);
             $MC = { 'plain' =&gt; ... text body struct ref part ...,
                     'html' =&gt; ... html body struct ref part (if present) ...
                     'htmllist' =&gt; [ ... html body struct ref parts (if present) ... ] };

             # Now get the text part of the message
             my $MT = $IMAP-&gt;fetch(1, 'body[' . $MC-&gt;{text}-&gt;{'IMAP-Part'} . ']');

       <u>generate_cid(</u> <u>$Token,</u> <u>$PartBS</u> <u>)</u>
           This method generates a ContentID based on $Token and $PartBS.

           The same value should always be returned for a given $Token and $PartBS

       <u>build_cid_map($BodyStruct,</u> <u>[</u> <u>$IMAP,</u> <u>$Uid,</u> <u>$GenCidToken</u> <u>])</u>
           This is a helper function that can be used to further parse the results of a  fetched  bodystructure.
           It  recursively  parses  the  bodystructure  and  returns  a  hash  of  Content-ID to bodystruct part
           references. This is useful when trying to determine CID links from an HTML message.

           If you pass a Mail::IMAPTalk object as the second parameter, the CID  map  built  may  be  even  more
           detailed. It seems some stupid versions of exchange put details in the Content-Location header rather
           than the Content-Type header. If that's the case, this will try and fetch the header from the message

           Examples:

             # Fetch body structure
             my $FR = $IMAP-&gt;fetch(1, 'bodystructure');
             my $BS = $FR-&gt;{1}-&gt;{bodystructure};

             # Parse further to get CID links
             my $CL = build_cid_map($BS);
             $CL = { '2958293123' =&gt; ... ref to body part ..., ... };

       <u>obliterate($CyrusName)</u>
           Given  a  username  (optionally  username\@domain)  immediately delete all messages belonging to this
           user.  Uses LOCALDELETE.  Quite FastMail Patchd Cyrus specific.

</pre><h4><b>IMAP</b> <b>CALLBACKS</b></h4><pre>
       By default, these methods do nothing, but you can dervice from Mail::IMAPTalk and override these  methods
       to trap any things you want to catch

       <u>cb_switch_folder($CurrentFolder,</u> <u>$NewFolder)</u>
           Called  when  the  currently  selected  folder  is being changed (eg 'select' called and definitely a
           different folder is being selected, or 'unselect' methods called)

       <u>cb_folder_changed($Folder)</u>
           Called when a command changes the contents of a folder (eg copy, append, etc). $Folder is the name of
           the folder that's changing.

</pre><h4><b>FETCH</b> <b>RESULTS</b></h4><pre>
       The 'fetch' operation is probably the most common thing you'll do with an IMAP connection. This operation
       allows you to retrieve information about a message or set of messages, including header fields, flags  or
       parts of the message body.

       "Mail::IMAPTalk"  will  always  parse  the  results  of  a  fetch call into a Perl like structure, though
       'bodystructure', 'envelope' and 'uid' responses may have additional parsing depending on the "parse_mode"
       state and the "uid" state (see below).

       For an example case, consider the following IMAP commands and responses (C is what the client sends, S is
       the server response).

         C: a100 fetch 5,6 (flags rfc822.size uid)
         S: * 1 fetch (UID 1952 FLAGS (\recent \seen) RFC822.SIZE 1150)
         S: * 2 fetch (UID 1958 FLAGS (\recent) RFC822.SIZE 110)
         S: a100 OK Completed

       The fetch command can be sent by calling:

         my $Res = $IMAP-&gt;fetch('1:*', '(flags rfc822.size uid)');

       The result in response will look like this:

         $Res = {
           1 =&gt; {
             'uid' =&gt; 1952,
             'flags' =&gt; [ '\\recent', '\\seen' ],
             'rfc822.size' =&gt; 1150
           },
           2 =&gt; {
             'uid' =&gt; 1958,
             'flags' =&gt; [ '\\recent' ],
             'rfc822.size' =&gt; 110
           }
         };

       A couple of points to note:

       1.  The message IDs have been turned into a hash from message ID to fetch response result.

       2.  The response items (e.g. uid, flags, etc) have been turned into a hash for  each  message,  and  also
           changed to lower case values.

       3.  Other bracketed (...) lists have become array references.

       In  general,  this is how all fetch responses are parsed.  There is one major difference however when the
       IMAP connection is in 'uid' mode. In this case, the message IDs in the main hash are changed  to  message
       UIDs, and the 'uid' entry in the inner hash is removed. So the above example would become:

         my $Res = $IMAP-&gt;fetch('1:*', '(flags rfc822.size)');

         $Res = {
           1952 =&gt; {
             'flags' =&gt; [ '\\recent', '\\seen' ],
             'rfc822.size' =&gt; 1150
           },
           1958 =&gt; {
             'flags' =&gt; [ '\\recent' ],
             'rfc822.size' =&gt; 110
           }
         };

   <b>Bodystructure</b>
       When  dealing  with messages, we need to understand the MIME structure of the message, so we can work out
       what is the text body, what is attachments, etc. This is where the  'bodystructure'  item  from  an  IMAP
       server comes in.

         C: a101 fetch 1 (bodystructure)
         S: * 1 fetch (BODYSTRUCTURE ("TEXT" "PLAIN" NIL NIL NIL "QUOTED-PRINTABLE" 255 11 NIL ("INLINE" NIL) NIL))
         S: a101 OK Completed

       The fetch command can be sent by calling:

         my $Res = $IMAP-&gt;fetch(1, 'bodystructure');

       As expected, the resultant response would look like this:

         $Res = {
           1 =&gt; {
             'bodystructure' =&gt; [
               'TEXT', 'PLAIN', undef, undef, undef, 'QUOTED-PRINTABLE',
                 255, 11, UNDEF, [ 'INLINE', undef ], undef
             ]
           }
         };

       However, if you set the "parse_mode(BodyStructure =" 1)&gt;, then the result would be:

         $Res = {
           '1' =&gt; {
             'bodystructure' =&gt; {
               'MIME-Type' =&gt; 'text',
               'MIME-Subtype' =&gt; 'plain',
               'MIME-TxtType' =&gt; 'text/plain',
               'Content-Type' =&gt; {},
               'Content-ID' =&gt; undef,
               'Content-Description' =&gt; undef,
               'Content-Transfer-Encoding' =&gt; 'QUOTED-PRINTABLE',
               'Size' =&gt; '3569',
               'Lines' =&gt; '94',
               'Content-MD5' =&gt; undef,
               'Disposition-Type' =&gt; 'inline',
               'Content-Disposition' =&gt; {},
               'Content-Language' =&gt; undef,
               'Remainder' =&gt; [],
               'IMAP-Partnum' =&gt; ''
             }
           }
         };

       A couple of points to note here:

       1.  All  the  positional  fields  from the bodystructure list response have been turned into nicely named
           key/value hash items.

       2.  The MIME-Type and MIME-Subtype fields have been made lower case.

       3.  An IMAP-Partnum item has been added. The value in this field can be passed as the 'section' number of
           an IMAP body fetch call to retrieve the text of that IMAP section.

       In general, the following items are defined for all body structures:

       •   MIME-Type

       •   MIME-Subtype

       •   Content-Type

       •   Disposition-Type

       •   Content-Disposition

       •   Content-Language

       For all bodystructures EXCEPT those that have a MIME-Type of 'multipart', the following are defined:

       •   Content-ID

       •   Content-Description

       •   Content-Transfer-Encoding

       •   Size

       •   Content-MD5

       •   Remainder

       •   IMAP-Partnum

       For bodystructures where MIME-Type is 'text', an extra item 'Lines' is defined.

       For  bodystructures  where  MIME-Type  is  'message'  and  MIME-Subtype  is  'rfc822',  the  extra  items
       'Message-Envelope',  'Message-Bodystructure' and 'Message-Lines' are defined. The 'Message-Bodystructure'
       item is itself a reference to an entire bodystructure  hash  with  all  the  format  information  of  the
       contained  message.  The 'Message-Envelope' item is a hash structure with the message header information.
       See the <b>Envelope</b> entry below.

       For bodystructures where MIME-Type  is  'multipart',  an  extra  item  'MIME-Subparts'  is  defined.  The
       'MIME-Subparts'  item  is an array reference, with each item being a reference to an entire bodystructure
       hash with all the format information of each MIME sub-part.

       For further processing, you can use the <b>find_message()</b> function.  This will analyse  the  body  structure
       and  find  which  part  corresponds  to the main text/html message parts to display. You can also use the
       <b>find_cid_parts()</b> function to find CID links in an html message.

   <b>Envelope</b>
       The envelope structure contains most of the addressing header fields from an email message. The following
       shows an example envelope fetch (the response from the IMAP server has been neatened up here)

         C: a102 fetch 1 (envelope)
         S: * 1 FETCH (ENVELOPE
             ("Tue, 7 Nov 2000 08:31:21 UT"      # Date
              "FW: another question"             # Subject
              (("John B" NIL "jb" "abc.com"))    # From
              (("John B" NIL "jb" "abc.com"))    # Sender
              (("John B" NIL "jb" "abc.com"))    # Reply-To
              (("Bob H" NIL "bh" "xyz.com")      # To
               ("K Jones" NIL "kj" "lmn.com"))
              NIL                                # Cc
              NIL                                # Bcc
              NIL                                # In-Reply-To
              NIL)                               # Message-ID
            )
         S: a102 OK Completed

       The fetch command can be sent by calling:

         my $Res = $IMAP-&gt;fetch(1, 'envelope');

       And you get the idea of what the resultant response would be. Again if you change "parse_mode(Envelope ="
       1)&gt;, you get a neat structure as follows:

         $Res = {
           '1' =&gt; {
             'envelope' =&gt; {
               'Date' =&gt; 'Tue, 7 Nov 2000 08:31:21 UT',
               'Subject' =&gt; 'FW: another question',
               'From' =&gt; '"John B" &lt;<a href="mailto:jb@abc.com">jb@abc.com</a>&gt;',
               'Sender' =&gt; '"John B" &lt;<a href="mailto:jb@abc.com">jb@abc.com</a>&gt;',
               'Reply-To' =&gt; '"John B" &lt;<a href="mailto:jb@abc.com">jb@abc.com</a>&gt;',
               'To' =&gt; '"Bob H" &lt;<a href="mailto:bh@xyz.com">bh@xyz.com</a>&gt;, "K Jones" &lt;<a href="mailto:kj@lmn.com">kj@lmn.com</a>&gt;',
               'Cc' =&gt; '',
               'Bcc' =&gt; '',
               'In-Reply-To' =&gt; undef,
               'Message-ID' =&gt; undef,

               'From-Raw' =&gt; [ [ 'John B', undef, 'jb', 'abc.com' ] ],
               'Sender-Raw' =&gt; [ [ 'John B', undef, 'jb', 'abc.com' ] ],
               'Reply-To-Raw' =&gt; [ [ 'John B', undef, 'jb', 'abc.com' ] ],
               'To-Raw' =&gt; [
                 [ 'Bob H', undef, 'bh', 'xyz.com' ],
                 [ 'K Jones', undef, 'kj', 'lmn.com' ],
               ],
               'Cc-Raw' =&gt; [],
               'Bcc-Raw' =&gt; [],
             }
           }
         };

       All the fields here are from straight from the email headers.  See RFC 822 for more details.

   <b>Annotation</b>
       If the server supports RFC 5257 (ANNOTATE Extension), then you can fetch per-message annotations.

       Annotation responses would normally be returned as a a nested set of arrays. However it's much easier  to
       access  the  results  as  a nested set of hashes, so the results are so converted if the Annotation parse
       mode is enabled, which is on by default.

       Part of an example from the RFC

          S: * 12 FETCH (UID 1123 ANNOTATION
             (/comment (value.priv "My comment"
                size.priv "10")
             /altsubject (value.priv "Rhinoceroses!"
                size.priv "13")

       So the fetch command:

         my $Res = $IMAP-&gt;fetch(1123, 'annotation', [ '/*', [ 'value.priv', 'size.priv' ] ]);

       Would have the result:

         $Res = {
           '1123' =&gt; {
             'annotation' =&gt; {
               '/comment' =&gt; {
                 'value.priv' =&gt; 'My comment',
                 'size.priv =&gt; 10
               },
               '/altsubject' =&gt; {
                 'value.priv' =&gt; '"Rhinoceroses',
                 'size.priv =&gt; 13
               }
             }
           }
         }

</pre><h4><b>INTERNAL</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>_</b><u>imap_cmd($Command,</u> <u>$IsUidCmd,</u> <u>$RespItems,</u> <u>@Args)</u>
           Executes a standard IMAP command.

       <u>Method</u> <u>arguments</u>
           <b>$Command</b>
               Text string of command to call IMAP server with (e.g. 'select', 'search', etc).

           <b>$IsUidCmd</b>
               1 if command involved message ids and can be prefixed with UID, 0 otherwise.

           <b>$RespItems</b>
               Responses to look for from command (eg 'list',  'fetch',  etc).  Commands  which  return  results
               usually  return  them  untagged.  The  following is an example of fetching flags from a number of
               messages.

                 C123 uid fetch 1:* (flags)
                 * 1 FETCH (FLAGS (\Seen) UID 1)
                 * 2 FETCH (FLAGS (\Seen) UID 2)
                 C123 OK Completed

               Between the sending of the command and the 'OK Completed' response, we have to pick  up  all  the
               untagged  'FETCH'  response  items  so  we  would  pass  'fetch'  (always  use lower case) as the
               $RespItems to extract.

               This can also be a hash ref of callback functions. See _parse_response for more examples

           <b>@Args</b>
               Any extra arguments to pass to command.

       <b>_</b><u>send_cmd($Self,</u> <u>$Cmd,</u> <u>@InArgs)</u>
           Helper method used by the <b>_imap_cmd</b> method to actually build (and quote where necessary) the  command
           arguments and then send the actual command.

       <b>_</b><u>send_data($Self,</u> <u>$Opts,</u> <u>$Buffer,</u> <u>@Args)</u>
           Helper  method used by the <b>_send_cmd</b> method to actually build (and quote where necessary) the command
           arguments and then send the actual command.

       <b>_</b><u>parse_response($Self,</u> <u>$RespItems,</u> <u>[</u> <u>\%ParseMode</u> <u>])</u>
           Helper method called by <b>_imap_cmd</b> after sending the command. This methods  retrieves  data  from  the
           IMAP socket and parses it into Perl structures and returns the results.

           $RespItems  is  either  a string, which is the untagged response(s) to find and return, or for custom
           processing, it can be a hash ref.

           If a hash ref, then each key will be an untagged response to look for,  and  each  value  a  callback
           function to call for the corresponding untagged response.

           Each  callback  will  be called with 2 or 3 arguments; the untagged response string, the remainder of
           the line parsed into an array ref, and for fetch type responses, the id will be passed as  the  third
           argument.

           One  other  piece  of magic, if you pass a 'responseitem' key, then the value should be a string, and
           will be the untagged response returned from the function

       <b>_</b><u>require_capability($Self,</u> <u>$Capability)</u>
           Helper method which checks that the server has a certain capability.  If not, it  sets  the  internal
           last error, $@ and returns undef.

       <b>_</b><u>trace($Self,</u> <u>$Line)</u>
           Helper method which outputs any tracing data.

       <b>_</b><u>is_current_folder($Self,</u> <u>$FolderName)</u>
           Return true if a folder is currently selected and that folder is $FolderName

</pre><h4><b>INTERNAL</b> <b>SOCKET</b> <b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>_</b><u>next_atom($Self)</u>
           Returns the next atom from the current line. Uses $Self-&gt;{ReadLine} for line data, or if undef, fills
           it with a new line of data from the IMAP connection socket and then begins processing.

           If the next atom is:

           •   An unquoted string, simply returns the string.

           •   A quoted string, unquotes the string, changes any occurrences of \" to " and returns the string.

           •   A  literal (e.g. {NBytes}\r\n), reads the number of bytes of data in the literal into a scalar or
               file (depending on "literal_handle_control").

           •   A bracketed structure, reads all  the  sub-atoms  within  the  structure  and  returns  an  array
               reference with all the sub-atoms.

           In  each  case, after parsing the atom, it removes any trailing space separator, and then returns the
           remainder of the line to $Self-&gt;{ReadLine} ready for the next call to "_next_atom()".

       <b>_</b><u>next_simple_atom($Self)</u>
           Faster version of <b>_next_atom()</b> for known simple cases

       <b>_</b><u>remaining_atoms($Self)</u>
           Returns all the remaining atoms for the current line in the read line buffer as an  array  reference.
           Leaves $Self-&gt;{ReadLine} eq ''.  See "_next_atom()"

       <b>_</b><u>remaining_line($Self)</u>
           Returns the remaining data in the read line buffer ($Self-&gt;{ReadLine}) as a scalar string/data value.

       <b>_</b><u>fill_imap_read_buffer($Self)</u>
           Wait  until data is available on the IMAP connection socket (or a timeout occurs). Read the data into
           the   internal   buffer   $Self-&gt;{ReadBuf}.   You   can    then    use    "_imap_socket_read_line()",
           "_imap_socket_read_bytes()"  or "_copy_imap_socket_to_handle()" to read data from the buffer in lines
           or bytes at a time.

       <b>_</b><u>imap_socket_read_line($Self)</u>
           Read a \r\n terminated list from the buffered IMAP connection socket.

       <b>_</b><u>imap_socket_read_bytes($Self,</u> <u>$NBytes)</u>
           Read a certain number of bytes from the buffered IMAP connection socket.

       <b>_</b><u>imap_socket_out($Self,</u> <u>$Data)</u>
           Write the data in $Data to the IMAP connection socket.

       <b>_</b><u>copy_handle_to_imapsocket($Self,</u> <u>$InHandle)</u>
           Copy a given number of bytes from a file handle to the IMAP connection

       <b>_</b><u>copy_imap_socket_to_handle($Self,</u> <u>$OutHandle,</u> <u>$NBytes)</u>
           Copies data from the IMAP socket to a file handle. This is different to <b>_copy_handle_to_imap_socket()</b>
           because we internally buffer the IMAP socket so we can't just use it to copy from the socket  handle,
           we have to copy the contents of our buffer first.

           The  number of bytes specified must be available on the IMAP socket, if the function runs out of data
           it will 'die' with an error.

       <b>_</b><u>quote($String)</u>
           Returns an IMAP quoted version of a string. This place "..." around  the  string,  and  replaces  any
           internal " with \".

</pre><h4><b>INTERNAL</b> <b>PARSING</b> <b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>_</b><u>parse_list_to_hash($ListRef,</u> <u>$Recursive)</u>
           Parses an array reference list of ($Key, $Value) pairs into a hash.  Makes sure that all the keys are
           lower cased (lc) first.

       <b>_</b><u>fix_folder_name($FolderName,</u> <u>%Opts)</u>
           Changes  a  folder  name  based on the current root folder prefix as set with the "set_root_prefix()"
           call.

             Wildcard =&gt; 1 = a folder name with % or * is left alone
             NoEncoding =&gt; 1 = don't do modified utf-7 encoding, leave as unicode

       <b>_</b><u>fix_folder_encoding($FolderName)</u>
           Encode folder name using IMAP-UTF-7

       <b>_</b><u>unfix_folder_name($FolderName)</u>
           Unchanges a folder name based on the current root folder prefix as set with  the  "set_root_prefix()"
           call.

       <b>_</b><u>fix_message_ids($MessageIds)</u>
           Used by IMAP commands to handle a number of different ways that message IDs can be specified.

       <u>Method</u> <u>arguments</u>
           <b>$MessageIds</b>
               String or array ref which specified the message IDs or UIDs.

           The $MessageIds parameter may take the following forms:

           <b>array</b> <b>ref</b>
               Array is turned into a string of comma separated ID numbers.

           <b>1:*</b> Normally  a  * would result in the message ID string being quoted.  This ensure that such a range
               string is not quoted because some servers (e.g. cyrus) don't like.

       <b>_</b><u>parse_email_address($EmailAddressList)</u>
           Converts a list of IMAP email address structures as parsed and returned from an IMAP fetch (envelope)
           call into a single RFC 822 email string (e.g. "Person 1  Name"  &lt;<a href="mailto:ename@ecorp.com">ename@ecorp.com</a>&gt;,  "Person  2  Name"
           &lt;...&gt;, etc) to finally return to the user.

           This is used to parse an envelope structure returned from a fetch call.

           See the documentation section 'FETCH RESULTS' for more information.

       <b>_</b><u>parse_envelope($Envelope,</u> <u>$IncludeRaw,</u> <u>$DecodeUTF8)</u>
           Converts  an IMAP envelope structure as parsed and returned from an IMAP fetch (envelope) call into a
           convenient hash structure.

           If $IncludeRaw is true, includes the XXX-Raw fields, otherwise these are left out.

           If $DecodeUTF8 is true, then checks if the fields contain any  quoted-printable  chars,  and  decodes
           them to a Perl UTF8 string if they do.

           See the documentation section 'FETCH RESULTS' from more information.

       <b>_</b><u>parse_bodystructure($BodyStructure,</u> <u>$IncludeRaw,</u> <u>$DecodeUTF8,</u> <u>$PartNum)</u>
           Parses  a  standard IMAP body structure and turns it into a Perl friendly nested hash structure. This
           routine is recursive and you should not pass a value for $PartNum  when  called  for  the  top  level
           bodystructure  item.   Note  that  this  routine  destroys the array reference structure passed in as
           $BodyStructure.

           See the documentation section 'FETCH RESULTS' from more information

       <b>_</b><u>parse_fetch_annotation($AnnotateItem)</u>
           Takes the result from a single IMAP annotation item into a Perl friendly structure.

           See the documentation section 'FETCH RESULTS' from more information.

       <b>_</b><u>parse_fetch_result($FetchResult)</u>
           Takes the result from a single IMAP fetch response line and parses it into a Perl friendly structure.

           See the documentation section 'FETCH RESULTS' from more information.

       <b>_</b><u>parse_header_result($HeaderResults,</u> <u>$Value,</u> <u>$FetchResult)</u>
           Take a body[header.fields (xyz)] fetch response and parse out the header fields and values

       <b>_</b><u>decode_utf8($Value)</u>
           Decodes the passed quoted printable value to a Perl Unicode string.

       <b>_</b><u>expand_sequence(@Sequences)</u>
           Expand a list of IMAP id sequences into a full list of ids
