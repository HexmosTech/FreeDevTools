</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Mail::DeliveryStatus::BounceParser - Perl extension to analyze bounce messages

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Mail::DeliveryStatus::BounceParser;

         # $message is \*io or $fh or "entire\nmessage" or \@lines
         my $bounce = eval { Mail::DeliveryStatus::BounceParser-&gt;new($message); };

         if ($@) {
           # couldn't parse.
         }

         my @addresses       = $bounce-&gt;addresses;       # email address strings
         my @reports         = $bounce-&gt;reports;         # Mail::Header objects
         my $orig_message_id = $bounce-&gt;orig_message_id; # &lt;<a href="mailto:ABCD.1234@mx.example.com">ABCD.1234@mx.example.com</a>&gt;
         my $orig_message    = $bounce-&gt;orig_message;    # Mail::Internet object

</pre><h4><b>ABSTRACT</b></h4><pre>
       Mail::DeliveryStatus::BounceParser analyzes RFC822 bounce messages and returns a structured description
       of the addresses that bounced and the reason they bounced; it also returns information about the original
       returned message including the Message-ID.  It works best with RFC1892 delivery reports, but will gamely
       attempt to understand any bounce message no matter what MTA generated it.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Meng Wong wrote this for the Listbox v2 project; good mailing list managers handle bounce messages so
       listowners don't have to.  The best mailing list managers figure out exactly what is going on with each
       subscriber so the appropriate action can be taken.

   <b>parse</b>
         my $bounce = Mail::DeliveryStatus::BounceParser-&gt;parse($message, \%arg);

       OPTIONS.  If you pass BounceParser-&gt;new(..., {log=&gt;sub { ... }}) That will be used as a logging callback.
       If $message is undefined, will parse STDIN.

       NON-BOUNCES.  If the message is recognizably a vacation autoresponse, or is a report of a transient
       nonfatal error, or a spam or virus autoresponse, you'll still get back a $bounce, but its
       "$bounce-&gt;is_bounce()" will return false.

       It is possible that some bounces are not really bounces; such as anything that appears to have a 2XX
       status code.  To include such non-bounces in the reports, pass the option {report_non_bounces=&gt;1}.

       For historical reasons, "new" is an alias for the "parse" method.

   <b>log</b>
         $bounce-&gt;log($messages);

       If a logging callback has been given, the message will be passed to it.

   <b>is_bounce</b>
         if ($bounce-&gt;is_bounce) { ... }

       This method returns true if the bounce parser thought the message was a bounce, and false otherwise.

   <b>reports</b>
       Each $report returned by $bounce-&gt;<b>reports()</b> is basically a Mail::Header object with a few modifications.
       It includes the email address bouncing, and the reason for the bounce.

       Consider an RFC1892 error report of the form

        Reporting-MTA: dns; hydrant.pobox.com
        Arrival-Date: Fri,  4 Oct 2002 16:49:32 -0400 (EDT)

        Final-Recipient: rfc822; <a href="mailto:bogus3@dumbo.pobox.com">bogus3@dumbo.pobox.com</a>
        Action: failed
        Status: 5.0.0
        Diagnostic-Code: X-Postfix; host dumbo.pobox.com[208.210.125.24] said: 550
         &lt;<a href="mailto:bogus3@dumbo.pobox.com">bogus3@dumbo.pobox.com</a>&gt;: Nonexistent Mailbox

       Each "header" above is available through the usual <b>get()</b> mechanism.

         print $report-&gt;get('reporting_mta');   # 'some.host.com'
         print $report-&gt;get('arrival-date');    # 'Fri,  4 Oct 2002 16:49:32 -0400 (EDT)'
         print $report-&gt;get('final-recipient'); # 'rfc822; <a href="mailto:bogus3@dumbo.pobox.com">bogus3@dumbo.pobox.com</a>'
         print $report-&gt;get('action');          # "failed"
         print $report-&gt;get('status');          # "5.0.0"
         print $report-&gt;get('diagnostic-code'); # X-Postfix; ...

         # BounceParser also inserts a few interpretations of its own:
         print $report-&gt;get('email');           # '<a href="mailto:bogus3@dumbo.pobox.com">bogus3@dumbo.pobox.com</a>'
         print $report-&gt;get('std_reason');      # 'user_unknown'
         print $report-&gt;get('reason');          # host [199.248.185.2] said: 550 5.1.1 unknown or illegal user: <a href="mailto:somebody@uss.com">somebody@uss.com</a>
         print $report-&gt;get('host');            # dumbo.pobox.com
         print $report-&gt;get('smtp_code');       # 550

         print $report-&gt;get('raw') ||           # the original unstructured text
               $report-&gt;as_string;              # the original   structured text

       Probably the two most useful fields are "email" and "std_reason", the standardized reason.  At this time
       BounceParser returns the following standardized reasons:

         user_unknown
         over_quota
         user_disabled
         domain_error
         spam
         message_too_large
         unknown
         no_problemo

       The "spam" standard reason indicates that the message bounced because the recipient considered it spam.

       (no_problemo will only appear if you set {report_non_bounces=&gt;1})

       If the bounce message is not structured according to RFC1892, BounceParser will still try to return as
       much information as it can; in particular, you can count on "email" and "std_reason" to be present.

   <b>addresses</b>
       Returns a list of the addresses which appear to be bouncing.  Each member of the list is an email address
       string of the form '<a href="mailto:foo@bar.com">foo@bar.com</a>'.

   <b>orig_message_id</b>
       If possible, returns the message-id of the original message as a string.

   <b>orig_message</b>
       If the original message was included in the bounce, it'll be available here as a message/rfc822 MIME
       entity.

         my $orig_message    = $bounce-&gt;orig_message;

   <b>orig_header</b>
       If only the original headers were returned in the text/rfc822-headers chunk, they'll be available here as
       a Mail::Header entity.

   <b>orig_text</b>
       If the bounce message was poorly structured, the above two methods won't return anything --- instead, you
       get back a block of text that may or may not approximate the original message.  No guarantees.  Good
       luck.

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
       Bounce messages are generally meant to be read by humans, not computers.  A poorly formatted bounce
       message may fool BounceParser into spreading its net too widely and returning email addresses that didn't
       actually bounce.  Before you do anything with the email addresses you get back, confirm that it makes
       sense that they might be bouncing --- for example, it doesn't make sense for the sender of the original
       message to show up in the addresses list, but it could if the bounce message is sufficiently
       misformatted.

       Still, please report all bugs!

</pre><h4><b>FREE-FLOATING</b> <b>ANXIETY</b></h4><pre>
       Some bizarre MTAs construct bounce messages using the original headers of the original message.  If your
       application relies on the assumption that all Message-IDs are unique, you need to watch out for these
       MTAs and program defensively; before doing anything with the Message-ID of a bounce message, first
       confirm that you haven't already seen it; if you have, change it to something else that you make up on
       the spot, such as "&lt;antibogus-TIMESTAMP-PID-COUNT@LOCALHOST&gt;".

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       BounceParser assumes a sanely constructed bounce message.  Input from the real world may cause
       BounceParser to barf and die horribly when we violate one of MIME::Entity's assumptions; this is why you
       should always call it inside an eval { }.

   <b>TODO</b>
       Provide some translation of the SMTP and DSN error codes into English.  Review RFC1891 and RFC1893.

</pre><h4><b>KNOWN</b> <b>TO</b> <b>WORK</b> <b>WITH</b></h4><pre>
       We understand bounce messages generated by the following MTAs / organizations:

        Postfix
        Sendmail
        Exim
        AOL
        Yahoo
        Hotmail
        AOL's AirMail sender-blocking
        Microsoft Exchange*
        Qmail*
        Novell Groupwise*

        * Items marked with an asterisk currently may return incomplete information.
