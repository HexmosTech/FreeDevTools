       Email::MIME::Kit - build messages from templates

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 3.000008

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Email::MIME::Kit;

         my $kit = Email::MIME::Kit-&gt;new({ source =&gt; 'mkits/sample.mkit' });

         my $email = $kit-&gt;assemble({
           account           =&gt; $new_signup,
           verification_code =&gt; $token,
           ... and any other template vars ...
         });

         $transport-&gt;send($email, { ... });

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Email::MIME::Kit is a templating system for email messages.  Instead of trying to be yet another
       templating system for chunks of text, it makes it easy to build complete email messages.

       It handles the construction of multipart messages, text and HTML alternatives, attachments, interpart
       linking, string encoding, and parameter validation.

       Although nearly every part of Email::MIME::Kit is a replaceable component, the stock configuration is
       probably enough for most use.  A message kit will be stored as a directory that might look like this:

         sample.mkit/
           manifest.json
           body.txt
           body.html
           logo.jpg

       The manifest file tells Email::MIME::Kit how to put it all together, and might look something like this:

         {
           "renderer": "TT",
           "header": [
             { "From": "WY Corp &lt;<a href="mailto:noreplies@wy.example.com">noreplies@wy.example.com</a>&gt;" },
             { "Subject": "Welcome aboard, [% recruit.name %]!" }
           ],
           "alternatives": [
             { "type": "text/plain", "path": "body.txt" },
             {
               "type": "text/html",
               "path": "body.html",
               "container_type": "multipart/related",
               "attachments": [ { "type": "image/jpeg", "path": "logo.jpg" } ]
             }
           ]
         }

       <b>Inline</b> <b>images</b> may be accessed with the function "cid_for", for example to include the above logo.jpg:

           &lt;img style="margin: 0 auto" src="cid:[% cid_for("logo.jpg") %]"&gt;

       <b>Please</b> <b>note:</b> the assembly of HTML documents as multipart/related bodies may be simplified with an
       alternate assembler in the future.

       The above manifest would build a multipart alternative message.  GUI mail clients would see a rendered
       HTML document with the logo graphic visible from the attachment.  Text mail clients would see the
       plaintext.

       Both the HTML and text parts would be rendered using the named renderer, which here is Template-Toolkit.

       The message would be assembled and returned as an Email::MIME object, just as easily as suggested in the
       "SYNOPSIS" above.

</pre><h4><b>PERL</b> <b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This library should run on perls released even a long time ago.  It should work on any version of perl
       released in the last five years.

       Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made that the minimum required version
       will not be increased.  The version may be increased for any reason, and there is no promise that patches
       will be accepted to lower the minimum required perl.

</pre><h4><b>ENCODING</b> <b>ISSUES</b></h4><pre>
       In general, "it should all just work" ... starting in version v3.

       Email::MIME::Kit assumes that any file read for the purpose of becoming a "text/*"-type part is encoded
       in UTF-8.  It will decode them and work with their contents as text strings.  Renderers will be passed
       text strings to render, and so on.  This, further, means that strings passed to the "assemble" method for
       use in rendering should also be text strings.

       In older versions of Email::MIME::Kit, files read from disk were read in raw mode and then handled as
       octet strings.  Meanwhile, the manifest's contents (and, thus, any templates stored as strings in the
       manifest) were decoded into text strings.  This could lead to serious problems.  For example: the
       <u>manifest.json</u> file might contain:

         "header": [
           { "Subject": "Message for [% customer_name %]" },
           ...
         ]

       ...while a template on disk might contain:

         Dear [% customer_name %],
         ...

       If the customer's name isn't ASCII, there was no right way to pass it in.  The template on disk would
       expect UTF-8, but the template in the manifest would expect Unicode text.  Users prior to v3 may have
       taken strange steps to get around this problem, understanding that some templates were treated
       differently than others.  This means that some review of kits is in order when upgrading from earlier
       versions of Email::MIME::Kit.
