       Mail::Box-Overview - objects used by Mail::Box

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Introduction</b>
       The MailBox package is a suite of classes for accessing and managing email folders in a folder-
       independent manner. This package is an alternative to the "Mail::Folder" and "MIME::*" packages. It
       abstracts the details of messages, message storage, and message threads, while providing better
       performance than older mail packages. It is meant to provide an object-oriented toolset for all kinds of
       e-mail applications, under which Mail User-Agents (MUA) and mail filtering programs.

       This package is modular --parts of it can be used independently of the rest. For example, the
       Mail::Box::Manager can automatically determine that a folder is in Mbox format and return an object of
       the Mail::Box::Mbox class, or the user program can bypass the manager and create Mail::Box::Mbox objects
       directly. Similarly, if the user program is only manipulating a single message, a Mail::Message.

       The Mail::Box package has special features to help MUA's access folder data quickly in random order.  You
       will not really benefit (neither slower) if you need the full folder sequentially.

       You may want to have a look at the sample scripts in the "scripts" directory.

   <b>Distributions</b>
       Up to MailBox v2, all "Mail::*" modules were released as a single distribution.  From v3, there are a few
       separate distributions in an attempt to reduce the dependencies:

       •   Mail::Message

       •   Mail::Transfer

       •   Mail::Box

       •   Mail::Box::IMAP4

       •   Mail::Box::POP3

       •   Mail::Box::Parser::C

       The names of the classes are not always ideal: the 'Mail' namespace on CPAN is quite full.

   <b>The</b> <b>class</b> <b>relations</b>
       Mail::Box::Manager  objects play a central role in any program which is built with MailBox.  Each program
       will create one manager, and then open folders via that manager.  Besides folders, the manager  can  also
       be used to discover message threads: sequences of messages with their follow-ups.

                              &lt;has-a&gt;      Mail::Box::Mbox
         Mail::Box::Manager &lt;---------*    (Mail::Box::MH)
                ^                :         (Mail::Box::Maildir)
                |           (maintains)    (Mail::Box::POP3)
                |                :
                |                :
                `---------------------*  Mail::Box::Thread::Manager
                             (&lt;has-a&gt;)

       Each  folder  maintains a list of messages.  Much effort is made to hide differences between folder types
       and kinds of messages.  Your program can be used for MBOX, MH, Maildir, and POP3 folders with  no  change
       at all (as long as you stick to the rules).

        Mail::Box::Mbox  &lt;-----------* Mail::Box::Mbox::Message
               ^             &lt;has-a&gt;            ^
               | &lt;isa&gt;                          | &lt;isa&gt;
               |                                |
           Mail::Box     ............. Mail::Box::Message
                                                ^
                                                | &lt;isa&gt;
                                                |
                                          Mail::Message
                                               / \
                                              &lt;has-a&gt;
                                             /     \
                                  Mail::Message   Mail::Message
                                    ::Body            ::Head

       The  situation  for  MH  and  Maildir  folders  is  a little more complicated, because they have an extra
       intermediate level of abstraction: Mail::Box::Dir.  The POP3 folder has an intermediate Mail::Box::Net.

       In the future, when more Mbox-like folder types get implemented, there may  be  a  Mail::Box::File  level
       too.  The following is also true for the mail boxes

        MB::MH::Message                 MB::POP3::Message
              \  MB::Maildir::Message            /
               \         /                      /
                \       /   MB::Mbox::Message  /
                 \     /         |            /
               MB::Dir::Message  |   MB::Net::Message
                            \    |    /
                             \   |   /
                             MB::Message
                                 |
                                 |
                            Mail::Message

   <b>The</b> <b>Manager</b>
       The  mailbox manager Mail::Box::Manager encapsulates folder management issues. It maintains a set of open
       mail folders (mailboxes), and provides methods for opening and closing them, efficiently moving  messages
       between  folders, and efficiently appending messages to folders.  It contains Mail::Box objects which may
       be of different types.  Most folder types can be detected automatically.

       The main manager also manages message-thread detector objects, and informs them when the  contents  of  a
       folder  have  changed.  This manager class is the only one you instantiate yourself: objects of all other
       classes will be provided by your folder manager.

       You are strongly advised to use this object, but you can often do without it and open a specific  folder-
       type directly.

   <b>The</b> <b>Messages</b>
       Mail::Message
           A  base  class  that defines an interface for manipulating the head and body of a message.  There are
           various  header  object  types  (Mail::Message::Head's)  and   a   bunch   of   body   object   types
           (Mail::Message::Body's).

           The  Mail::Message::Construct  package  is  loaded  when  more  complex tasks have to be performed on
           messages, like creating replies, bounces, or a forward message.  These functionalities are  described
           and  implemented  in the ::Construct file, but are automatically added to the Mail::Message namespace
           when used.

           Message types which are foreign to MailBox can be used in the MailBox  environment:  there  are  some
           converters  implemented  via  Mail::Message::Convert.   Particularly  the  popular Mail::Internet and
           MIME::Entity are supported.

       Mail::Box::Message
           An abstract base class which defines an interface for mail messages which are stored in  any  folder.
           It inherits from Mail::Message, and adds the basic idea of <u>location</u> to a message.

       Mail::Message::Body
           This  is  the base class for all message bodies.  It describes what you can do with any kind of body.
           The body types differ on the way how the keep the body content during the run of your program.

           One special case of the body types is the Mail::Message::Body::Multipart, which  contains  a  set  of
           Mail::Message::Part  objects.  These are just like normal messages, except that they are contained in
           an other message.  The Mail::Message::Body::Nested body type is comparible,  but  contains  only  one
           message: they are used for "message/rfc822" message encodings.

           When  needed,  the  functionality of the body objects is extended with Mail::Message::Body::Construct
           and Mail::Message::Body::Encode.  The former package implements things like concatenation, the  later
           controls  message  encoding  and decoding.  In the current implementation this is limited to transfer
           encodings (implemented in the Mail::Message::TransferEnc packages).   Automatic  character  and  mime
           recodings are on the wish-list.

       Mail::Message::Head
           The header for a single message. Maintains a set of Mail::Message::Field objects, each containing one
           header  line.   Fields  are the only objects which have no logging and tracing facilities, purely for
           reasons of performance.

           The header object has three sub-classes: the Mail::Message::Head::Complete version  knows  all  lines
           for   sure,   Mail::Message::Head::Subset   maintains   an   unknown   subset   of   lines,  and  the
           Mail::Message::Head::Delayed has no lines yet but knows where to get them.

           The latter two will automatically get the missing header lines from the mailbox  files  when  needed,
           and so transform into a "::Complete" header.  It is fully transparent to the user of MailBox in which
           shape the header really is on the moment.

   <b>The</b> <b>Folder</b> <b>types</b>
       Mail::Box
           A  base  class that defines a standard interface for mail boxes which is independent of mailbox type.
           Objects of this class contain a Mail::Box::Locker and a list of Mail::Box::Message objects.

       Mail::Box::Dir
           The base class for all folders which use a directory organization: each message is a separate  entity
           (file) grouped in a directory.  Each Mail::Box::Dir::Message represents one message, one such entity.

       Mail::Box::Net
           The  base  class for all folders which have the messages outside direct reach of the MailBox library,
           for instance on a remote system, or in a database.

       Mail::Box::Mbox
           This class derives from Mail::Box, and implements its interface for mbox-style folders. It  maintains
           a set of Mail::Box::Mbox::Message objects, which are derived from a Mail::Box::Message.

           Mbox-style  folders  have  one file containing multiple messages per folder.  When folders get large,
           access tends to get slow.

       Mail::Box::MH
           This class derives from Mail::Box::Dir,  and  implements  its  interface  for  MH-style  folders.  It
           maintains a set of Mail::Box::MH::Message objects, which are derived from a Mail::Box::Dir::Message.

           MH-style  folders  are  represented  by a directory, where each message is stored in a separate file.
           The message files are sequentially numbered.  It is fast to open one single message, but hard to  get
           an overview.

       Mail::Box::MH::Index
           The  base  class  for  MH  mailbox  indexes which provides methods for reading, writing, and managing
           message indexes.  These indexes are used to speed-up access to directory based folders.

       Mail::Box::MH::Labels
           Also for efficiency reasons, a separate file is maintained which contains flags about  the  messages.
           This  file  for instance lists new files.  This way, the MH message files do not have to be opened to
           find that out.

       Mail::Box::Maildir
           Like the MH folder type, this class derives from Mail::Box::Dir.  It  implements  its  interface  for
           Maildir-style  folders.  It maintains a set of Mail::Box::Maildir::Message objects, which are derived
           from a Mail::Box::Dir::Message.

       Mail::Box::POP3
           Implements the POP3 protocol  based  on  Mail::Box::Net.   The  Mail::Transport::POP3  implementation
           handles the protocol details.  In this kind of folders, you can only read and delete messages.

   <b>Various</b> <b>Other</b> <b>Classes</b>
       Mail::Box::Thread::Manager
           Maintains  a  set  of  message-threads over one or more folders.  A message-thread is a start message
           with all the replies on it.  And the replies on replies, and so on.  This object is used to construct
           the thread for a set of open folders.

           This object maintains linked lists of Mail::Box::Thread::Node objects.  Mail::Message::Dummy's  fill-
           up some holes.

       Mail::Box::Locker
           Provides a folder locking interface which is inherited by the Mail::Box class.  Currently it supports
           dot-file  locking  ("filename.lock"),  flock  filehandle  locking,  and  locking  over  NFS.  Each is
           implemented in a separate class.  A multi-locker, using a set of lock-methods at  the  same  time  is
           also available.

       Mail::Box::Search
           The  set  of  search  packages  implement  various  search  techniques in an uniformal way.  Although
           implementing your own search algorithm is simple in general, in practice multiparts,  encodings,  and
           mime-types complicate things.

       Mail::Box::Parser
           The  parser  reads messages, and transforms them into data-structures such that the content of header
           and body can be used within the program.  The first parser is implemented in  pure  Perl.   A  second
           parser is under development, and will written in C, to gain speed.

       Mail::Box::Tie
           Provides  hash (Mail::Box::Tie::HASH) or array tied (Mail::Box::Tie::ARRAY) access to any mail folder
           derived from Mail::Box.  This beautifies your code in some applications.

       Mail::Transport
           Various ways of sending and receiving messages are implemented.  Sending  is  possible  via  external
           programs, like "mail", "Mailx", "sendmail", or autonomously with direct SMTP.  Receiving is currently
           only implemented via POP3.

       Mail::Reporter
           A debugging and logging class which is inherited by most of the Mail:: modules.  For each object, you
           can  say what log and error reports must be kept or directly presented to the user.  This way you can
           decide to have Mail::Box report about problems, or do it all yourself.

       All classes are written to be extensible.
