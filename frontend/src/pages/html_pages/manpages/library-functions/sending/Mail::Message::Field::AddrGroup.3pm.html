</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Mail::Message::Field::AddrGroup - A group of Mail::Message::Field::Address objects

</pre><h4><b>INHERITANCE</b></h4><pre>
        Mail::Message::Field::AddrGroup
          is a User::Identity::Collection::Emails
          is a User::Identity::Collection
          is a User::Identity::Item

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        my $g = Mail::Message::Field::AddrGroup-&gt;new(name =&gt; 'name');

        my $a = Mail::Message::Field::Address-&gt;new(...);
        $g-&gt;addAddress($a);

        my $f = Mail::Message::Field::Addresses-&gt;new;
        $f-&gt;addGroup($g);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       An address group collects a set of e-mail addresses (in this case they are Mail::Message::Field::Address
       objects).

       Extends "DESCRIPTION" in User::Identity::Collection::Emails.

</pre><h4><b>OVERLOADED</b></h4><pre>
       Extends "OVERLOADED" in User::Identity::Collection::Emails.

       overload: <b>@{}</b>
           Inherited, see "OVERLOADED" in User::Identity::Collection

       overload: <b>stringification</b>
           Returns the <b>string()</b> value.

           Inherited, see "OVERLOADED" in User::Identity::Collection

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       Extends "METHODS" in User::Identity::Collection::Emails.

       $obj-&gt;<b>string</b>()
           Returns  the  address  group as string.  When no name is specified, it will only be a comma separated
           list of addresses.  With a name, the groups name will be prepended and a semi-colon  appended.   When
           no addresses where included and there is no name, then "undef" is returned.

       $obj-&gt;<b>coerce</b>($object)
           Coerce   an   $object  into  a  Mail::Message::Field::AddrGroup.   Currently,  you  can  only  coerce
           User::Identity::Collection::Emails (which is the base class for this one) into this one.

           Inherited, see "Attributes" in User::Identity::Collection

       $obj-&gt;<b>name</b>( [$newname] )
           Inherited, see "Attributes" in User::Identity::Item

       $obj-&gt;<b>roles</b>()
           Inherited, see "Attributes" in User::Identity::Collection

   <b>Collections</b>
       Extends "Collections" in User::Identity::Collection::Emails.

       $obj-&gt;<b>add</b>($collection, $role)
           Inherited, see "Collections" in User::Identity::Item

       $obj-&gt;<b>addCollection</b>( $object | &lt;[$type], %options&gt; )
           Inherited, see "Collections" in User::Identity::Item

       $obj-&gt;<b>collection</b>($name)
           Inherited, see "Collections" in User::Identity::Item

       $obj-&gt;<b>parent</b>( [$parent] )
           Inherited, see "Collections" in User::Identity::Item

       $obj-&gt;<b>removeCollection</b>($object|$name)
           Inherited, see "Collections" in User::Identity::Item

       $obj-&gt;<b>type</b>()
       Mail::Message::Field::AddrGroup-&gt;<b>type</b>()
           Inherited, see "Collections" in User::Identity::Item

       $obj-&gt;<b>user</b>()
           Inherited, see "Collections" in User::Identity::Item

   <b>Maintaining</b> <b>roles</b>
       Extends "Maintaining roles" in User::Identity::Collection::Emails.

       $obj-&gt;<b>addRole</b>($role| &lt;[$name],%options&gt; | ARRAY)
           Inherited, see "Maintaining roles" in User::Identity::Collection

       $obj-&gt;<b>removeRole</b>($role|$name)
           Inherited, see "Maintaining roles" in User::Identity::Collection

       $obj-&gt;<b>renameRole</b>( &lt;$role|$oldname&gt;, $newname )
           Inherited, see "Maintaining roles" in User::Identity::Collection

       $obj-&gt;<b>sorted</b>()
           Inherited, see "Maintaining roles" in User::Identity::Collection

   <b>Searching</b>
       Extends "Searching" in User::Identity::Collection::Emails.

       $obj-&gt;<b>find</b>($name|CODE|undef)
           Inherited, see "Searching" in User::Identity::Collection

   <b>Addresses</b>
       $obj-&gt;<b>addAddress</b>(STRING|$address|%options)
           Add one e-mail address to the list which is maintained  in  the  group.  This  is  a  wrapper  around
           <b>addRole()</b>  adding  flexibility  on how addresses are specified.  An $address can be anything which is
           acceptable for <b>Mail::Message::Field::Address::coerce()</b> or a list of options which will create such an
           object.

           example: of adding an address to an address group

            my @data = (full_name =&gt; "Myself", address =&gt; '<a href="mailto:me@tux.org">me@tux.org</a>');
            $group-&gt;addAddress(@data);

            my $addr = Mail::Message::Field::Address-&gt;new(@data);
            $group-&gt;addAddress(@data);

            my $ma = Mail::Address-&gt;new(...);
            $group-&gt;addAddress($ma);

       $obj-&gt;<b>addresses</b>()
           Returns all addresses defined in this group.  The addresses will be ordered  alphabetically  to  make
           automated testing possible: roles are stored in a hash, so have an unpredictable order by default.

           example: getting all addresses from a group

            my @addrs = $group-&gt;addresses;
            my @addrs = map { $_-&gt;address } $self-&gt;roles; #same

   <b>Error</b> <b>handling</b>
</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       Error: $object is not a collection.
           The first argument is an object, but not of a class which extends User::Identity::Collection.

       Error: Cannot coerce a $type into a Mail::Message::Field::AddrGroup
       Error: Cannot create a $type to add this to my collection.
           Some  options  are  specified to create a $type object, which is native to this collection.  However,
           for some reason this failed.

       Error: Cannot load collection module for $type ($class).
           Either the specified $type does not exist, or that module named $class  returns  compilation  errors.
           If  the type as specified in the warning is not the name of a package, you specified a nickname which
           was not defined.  Maybe you forgot the 'require' the package which defines the nickname.

       Error: Cannot rename $name into $newname: already exists
       Error: Cannot rename $name into $newname: doesn't exist
       Error: Creation of a collection via $class failed.
           The $class did compile, but it was not possible to create an object of that class using  the  options
           you specified.

       Error: Don't know what type of collection you want to add.
           If you add a collection, it must either by a collection object or a list of options which can be used
           to create a collection object.  In the latter case, the type of collection must be specified.

       Warning: No collection $name
           The collection with $name does not exist and can not be created.

       Error: Wrong type of role for $collection: requires a $expect but got a $type
           Each  $collection  groups  sets of roles of one specific type ($expect).  You cannot add objects of a
           different $type.
