       Lexical::Accessor - true private attributes for Moose/Moo/Mouse

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
          my $accessor = lexical_has identifier =&gt; (
             is       =&gt; 'rw',
             isa      =&gt; Int,
             default  =&gt; sub { 0 },
          );

          # or...
          lexical_has identifier =&gt; (
             is       =&gt; 'rw',
             isa      =&gt; Int,
             default  =&gt; sub { 0 },
             accessor =&gt; \$accessor,
          );

          # later...
          say $self-&gt;$accessor;     # says 0
          $self-&gt;$accessor( 1 );    # setter
          say $self-&gt;$accessor;     # says 1

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Lexical::Accessor generates coderefs which can be used as methods to access private attributes for
       objects.

       The private attributes are stored inside-out, and do not add any accessors to the class' namespace, so
       are completely invisible to any outside code, including any subclasses. This gives your attribute
       complete privacy: subclasses can define a private (or even public) attribute with the same name as your
       private one and they will not interfere with each other.

       Private attributes cannot be initialized by Moose/Moo/Mouse constructors, but you can safely initialize
       them inside a "BUILD" sub.

   <b>Functions</b>
       "lexical_has $name?, %options"
           This module exports a function lexical_has which acts much like Moose's "has" function, but sets up a
           private (lexical) attribute instead of a public one.

           Because lexical attributes are stored inside-out, the $name is completely optional; however a name is
           recommended because it allows better error messages to be generated.

           The lexical_has function supports the following options:

           "is"
               Moose/Mouse/Moo-style  "ro", "rw", "rwp" and "lazy" values are supported. These control what sort
               of coderef is returned by the "lexical_has" function itself.

                  my $reader            = lexical_has "foo" =&gt; (is =&gt; "ro");
                  my $accessor          = lexical_has "foo" =&gt; (is =&gt; "rw");
                  my ($reader, $writer) = lexical_has "foo" =&gt; (is =&gt; "rwp");

               If generating more than one method it is probably clearer to pass in  scalar  references  to  the
               "reader",  "writer",  etc  methods,  rather than relying on the return value of the "lexical_has"
               function.

           "reader", "writer", "accessor", "predicate", "clearer"
               These accept scalar references. The relevant coderefs will be plonked into them:

                  my ($get_foo, $set_foo);

                  lexical_has foo =&gt; (
                     reader      =&gt; \$get_foo,
                     writer      =&gt; \$set_foo,
                  );

               They can also be method names as strings:

                  my ($set_foo);

                  lexical_has foo =&gt; (
                     reader      =&gt; 'get_foo',
                     writer      =&gt; \$set_foo,
                  );

               This allows you to provide a partly public API for an attribute.

           "default", "builder", "lazy"
               Lazy defaults and builders are allowed. Eager (non-lazy)  defaults  and  builders  are  currently
               disallowed. (Use a "BUILD" sub to set private attribute values at object construction time.)

               The default may be either a non-reference value, or a coderef which will be called as a method to
               return the value.

               Builders  probably  make  less  sense  than  defaults because they require a method in the class'
               namespace. The builder may be a method name, or the special value '1' which will  be  interpreted
               as  meaning  the  attribute  name  prefixed  by  "_build_".  If  a  coderef  is provided, this is
               automatically installed into the class' namespace with the "_build_" prefix. (This  last  feature
               requires Sub::Name.)

           "isa"
               A  type  constraint for the attribute. Moo-style coderefs are accepted (including those generated
               by  MooX::Types::MooseLike),  as  are  Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint/MooseX::Types   objects,   and
               Mouse::Meta::TypeConstraint/MouseX::Types objects, and of course Type::Tiny type constraints.

               String  type constraints may also be accepted, but only if Type::Utils is installed. (String type
               constraints are reified using "dwim_type".)

           "does"
               As an alternative to "isa", you can provide a role name in the "does" option.

           "coerce"
               A coderef or Type::Coercion object is accepted.

               If the special value '1' is provided, the  type  constraint  object  is  consulted  to  find  the
               coercion. (This doesn't work for coderef type constraints.)

           "trigger"
               A method name or coderef to trigger when a new value is set.

           "auto_deref"
               Boolean  indicating  whether to automatically dereference array and hash values if called in list
               context.

           "init_arg"
               Must be "undef" if provided at all.

           "required"
               Must be false if provided at all.

           "weak_ref"
               Boolean. Makes the setter weaken any references it is called with.

           "handles"
               Delegates methods. Has slightly different syntax to Moose's option of the same name - is required
               to be an arrayref of pairs such that in each pair, the first is a scalar ref or a  string  method
               name  that  will  be  handled, and the second is a coderef or string method name that will do the
               handling. (The second can be an arrayref in the case of currying.)

                  my ($get, $post);

                  lexical_has ua =&gt; (
                     isa      =&gt; 'HTTP::Tiny',
                     default  =&gt; sub { 'HTTP::Tiny'-&gt;new },
                     handles  =&gt; [
                        \$get   =&gt; 'get',
                        \$post  =&gt; 'post',
                     ],
                  );

                  # later...
                  my $response = $self-&gt;$get('<a href="http://example.net/">http://example.net/</a>');

               Supports Sub::HandlesVia:

                  my $remove_task;
                  lexical_has tasks =&gt; (
                     isa          =&gt; ArrayRef,
                     handles_via  =&gt; 'Array',
                     handles      =&gt; [
                        task_count     =&gt; 'count',
                        add_task       =&gt; 'push',
                        next_task      =&gt; [ 'get', 0 ],
                        \$remove_task  =&gt; 'unshift',
                     ],
                  );

                  # later...
                  while ($self-&gt;task_count) {
                     my $task    = $self-&gt;next_task;
                     my $success = $self-&gt;handle_task($task);
                     if ($success) {
                        $self-&gt;$remove_task;
                     }
                  }

           "initializer", "traits", "lazy_build"
               Not currently implemented. Providing any of these options throws an error.

           "documentation", "definition_context"
               Don't do anything, but are allowed; effectively inline comments.

   <b>Class</b> <b>Methods</b>
       "lexical_has"
           This function may also be called as a class method.

   <b>Comparison</b> <b>(benchmarking,</b> <b>etc)</b>
       Lexical::Accessor is almost three times faster  than  MooX::PrivateAttributes,  and  almost  twenty  time
       faster  than  MooseX::Privacy.  I'd  also  argue  that  it's  a  more "correct" implementation of private
       accessors as (short of performing impressive PadWalker manipulations), the accessors  generated  by  this
       module are completely invisible to subclasses, method dispatch, etc.

       Compared  to the usual Moose convention of using a leading underscore to indicate a private method (which
       is  a  very  loose  convention;  it  is  quite  common  for  subclasses  to  override   such   methods!),
       Lexical::Accessor  clearly offers much better method privacy. There should be little performance hit from
       using lexical accessors compared to normal Moose accessors. (However they are nowhere near the  speed  of
       the XS-powered accessors that Moo <u>sometimes</u> uses and Mouse <u>usually</u> uses.)
