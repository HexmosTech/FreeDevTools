</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Class::Accessor::Named - Better profiling output for Class::Accessor

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           perl -MClass::Accessor::Named your_script.pl

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Class::Accessor is a great way to automate the tedious task of generating accessors and mutators. One
       small drawback is that due to the details of the implemenetation, you only get one "__ANON__" entry in
       profiling output.  That entry contains all your accessors, which can be a real pain if you're attempting
       to figure out <u>which</u> of your accessors is being called six billion times.  This module is a development
       aid which uses Hook::LexWrap and Sub::Name to talk your accessors into identifying themselves. While it
       shouldn't add much additional runtime overhead (as it acts only Class::Accessor's generator functions),
       it has not been designed for production deployment,

</pre><h4><b>DEPENDENCIES</b></h4><pre>
       This module depends on Class::Accessor, UNIVERSAL::require, Hook::LexWrap and Sub::Name

</pre><h4><b>INCOMPATIBILITIES</b></h4><pre>
       None reported.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       This module uses Hook::Lexwrap to alter the behaviour of Class::Accessor and Class::Accessor::Fast. Due
       to the nature of Hook::LexWrap, this <b>will</b> skew your profiling a tiny bit. We could probably do a little
       more internals diving and eliminate the dependency and the deficiency. Patches welcome.
