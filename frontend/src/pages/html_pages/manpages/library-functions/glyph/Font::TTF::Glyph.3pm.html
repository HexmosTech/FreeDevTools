</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Font::TTF::Glyph - Holds a information for a single glyph

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This is a single glyph description as held in a TT font. On creation only its header is read. Thus you
       can get the bounding box of each glyph without having to read all the other information.

</pre><h4><b>INSTANCE</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       In addition to the named variables in a glyph header ("xMin" etc.), there are also all capital instance
       variables for holding working information, mostly from the location table.

   <b>Variables</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>glyphs:</b>
       The standard attributes each glyph has are:

       numberOfContours
           For simple glyphs this will be the count of contours. For compound glyphs this will be -1.

       xMin
       yMin
       xMax
       yMax
           These identify the bounding box of the glyph.

       There  are  also other, derived, instance variables for each glyph which are read when the whole glyph is
       read (via "read_dat"):

       instLen
           Number  of  bytes  in  the  hinting  instructions  (Warning  this   variable   is   deprecated,   use
           "length($g-"{'hints'})&gt; instead).

       hints
           The string containing the hinting code for the glyph

   <b>Variables</b> <b>for</b> <b>simple</b> <b>glyphs</b> <b>(numberOfContours</b> <b>&gt;=</b> <b>0):</b>
       endPoints
           An  array  of  endpoints  for  each  contour in the glyph. There are "numberOfContours" contours in a
           glyph. The number of points in a glyph is equal to the highest endpoint of a contour.

       numPoints
           This is a generated value which contains the total number of points for this simple glyph.

       There are also a number of arrays indexed by point number:

       flags
           The flags associated with reading this point. The flags for a point are recalculated for a point when
           it is "update"d. Thus the flags are not very useful. The only important bit is bit 0 which  indicates
           whether the point is an 'on' curve point, or an 'off' curve point.

       x   The absolute x co-ordinate of the point.

       y   The absolute y co-ordinate of the point

   <b>Variables</b> <b>for</b> <b>compound</b> <b>glyphs</b> <b>(numberOfContours</b> <b>==</b> <b>-1):</b>
       metric
           This  holds  the  component number (not its glyph number) of the component from which the metrics for
           this glyph should be taken.

       comps
           This is an array of hashes for each component. Each hash has a number of elements:

           glyph
               The glyph number of the glyph which comprises this component of the  composite.   NOTE:  In  some
               badly  generated  fonts,  "glyph" may contain a numerical value but that glyph might not actually
               exist in the font file.  This could occur in any glyph, but is  particularly  likely  for  glyphs
               that have no strokes, such as SPACE, U+00A0 NO-BREAK SPACE, or U+200B ZERO WIDTH SPACE.

           args
               An  array  of two arguments which may be an x, y co-ordinate or two attachment points (one on the
               base glyph the other on the component). See flags for details.

           flag
               The flag for this component

           scale
               A 4 number array for component scaling. This allows stretching, rotating, etc.  Note that scaling
               applies to placement co-ordinates (rather than attachment points)  before  locating  rather  than
               after.

       numPoints
           This is a generated value which contains the number of components read in for this compound glyph.

   <b>Private</b> <b>instance</b> <b>variables:</b>
       INFILE (P)
           The input file form which to read any information

       LOC (P)
           Location relative to the start of the glyf table in the read file

       BASE (P)
           The location of the glyf table in the read file

       LEN (P)
           This  is  the  number  of  bytes  required  by the glyph. It should be kept up to date by calling the
           "update" method whenever any of the glyph content changes.

       OUTLOC (P)
           Location relative to the start of the glyf table. This variable is  only  active  whilst  the  output
           process  is  going  on. It is used to inform the location table where the glyph is located, since the
           glyf table is output before the loca table due to alphabetical ordering.

       OUTLEN (P)
           This indicates the length of the glyph data when it is output.  This  more  accurately  reflects  the
           internal  memory  form than the "LEN" variable which only reflects the read file length. The "OUTLEN"
           variable is only set after calling "out" or "out_dat".

   <b>Editing</b>
       If you want to edit a glyph in some way, then you should read_dat the glyph, then make your  changes  and
       then  update  the  glyph  or  set  the  $g-&gt;{'  isDirty'} variable.  The application must ensure that the
       following instance variables are correct, from which  update  will  calculate  the  rest,  including  the
       bounding box information.

           numPoints
           numberOfContours
           endPoints
           x, y, flags         (only flags bit 0)
           instLen
           hints

       For  components, the numPoints, x, y, endPoints &amp; flags are not required but the following information is
       required for each component.

           flag                (bits 2, 10, 11, 12)
           glyph
           args
           scale
           metric              (glyph instance variable)

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
</pre><h4><b>Font::TTF::Glyph-&gt;new(%parms)</b></h4><pre>
       Creates a new glyph setting various instance variables

   <b>$g-&gt;read</b>
       Reads the header component of the glyph (numberOfContours and bounding box) and also the  glyph  content,
       but  into  a  data  field  rather than breaking it down into its constituent structures. Use read_dat for
       this.

   <b>$g-&gt;read_dat</b>
       Reads the contents of the glyph (components and curves, etc.) from the memory store "DAT" into structures
       within the object.

   <b>$g-&gt;out($fh)</b>
       Writes the glyph data to outfile

   <b>$g-&gt;out_xml($context,</b> <b>$depth)</b>
       Outputs an XML description of the glyph

   <b>$g-&gt;dirty($val)</b>
       This sets the dirty flag to the given value or 1 if no given value. It returns the value of the flag

   <b>$g-&gt;update</b>
       Generates a "$self-"{'DAT'}&gt; from the internal structures, if the data has been read into  structures  in
       the  first  place.  If you are building a glyph from scratch you will need to set the instance variable '
       isDirty'.

   <b>$g-&gt;update_bbox</b>
       Updates the bounding box for this glyph according to the points in the glyph

   <b>$g-&gt;maxInfo</b>
       Returns lots of information about a glyph so that the "maxp"  table  can  update  itself.  Returns  array
       containing    contributions    of    this    glyph   to   maxPoints,   maxContours,   maxCompositePoints,
       maxCompositeContours, maxSizeOfInstructions, maxComponentElements, and maxComponentDepth.

   <b>$g-&gt;empty</b>
       Empties the glyph of all information to the level of not having been read.  Useful for saving  memory  in
       apps with many glyphs being read

   <b>$g-&gt;get_points</b>
       This  method  creates point information for a compound glyph. The information is stored in the same place
       as if the glyph was not a compound, but since numberOfContours is negative, the glyph is still marked  as
       being a compound

   <b>$g-&gt;get_refs</b>
       Returns  an array of all the glyph ids that are used to make up this glyph. That is all the compounds and
       their references and so on. If this glyph is not a compound, then returns an empty array.

       Please note the warning about bad fonts that reference nonexistent glyphs under INSTANCE VARIABLES above.
       This function will not attempt to filter out nonexistent glyph numbers.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       •   The instance variables used here are somewhat clunky and inconsistent with the other tables.

       •   "update" doesn't re-calculate the bounding box or "numberOfContours".
