</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Bio::Graphics::Glyph::ruler_arrow - glyph for drawing an arrow as ruler (5' and 3' are marked as label)

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         See L&lt;Bio::Graphics::Panel&gt; and L&lt;Bio::Graphics::Glyph&gt;.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This glyph draws arrows.  Label, if requested, will be 5' and 3' at both ends and tick scale is printed
       if no_tick_label option is set and tick option set.  Depending on options, the arrows can be labeled, be
       oriented vertically or horizontally, or can contain major and minor ticks suitable for use as a scale.

   <b>OPTIONS</b>
       In addition to the common options, the following glyph-specific options are recognized:

         Option      Description               Default
         ------      -----------               -------

         -tick       Whether to draw major         0
                     and minor ticks.
                     0 = no ticks
                     1 = major ticks
                     2 = minor ticks
         -label      5' at start, 3' at end        0
                     above arrow
         -both       5', 3' above,                 0
                     and 3', 5' below arrow
         -direction  0 = ruler is plus strand      0
                     -1 = ruler is minus strand

         -parallel   Whether to draw the arrow     true
                     parallel to the sequence
                     or perpendicular to it.

         -northeast  Force a north or east         true
                     arrowhead(depending
                     on orientation)

         -east       synonym of above

         -southwest  Force a south or west         true
                     arrowhead(depending
                     on orientation)

         -west       synonym of above

         -double     force-doubleheaded arrow

         -base       Draw a vertical base at the   false
                     non-arrowhead side

         -scale      Reset the labels on the arrow false
                     to reflect an externally
                     established scale.

       Set -parallel to false to display a point-like feature such as a polymorphism, or to indicate an
       important location.  If the feature start == end, then the glyph will draw a single arrow at the
       designated location:

              ^
              |

       Otherwise, there will be two arrows at the start and end:

              ^              ^
              |              |

       Scale: Pass in a externally established scale to reset the labels on the arrow.  This is particularly
       useful for manually constructed images where the founding parameters of the panel are not 1-based.  For
       example, a genetic map interval ranging from 0.1 - 0.3 can be constructed by first multiplying every
       value by 100. Passing

         arrow(-scale=&gt;100);

       will draw tick marks labelled appropriately to your external scale.
