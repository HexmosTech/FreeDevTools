</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       SWISS::BaseClass

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This class is designed to impliment many of the properties that you expect in inheritance.  All the
       housekeeping functions are defined in this module.  See the notes on use for a description of how to make
       use of it.

</pre><h4><b>Functions</b></h4><pre>
       new Returns a new SWISS::BaseClass object.

       rebless
           Converts  a  base  class into your class!  Call as $self-&gt;rebless($class) where $self is a base class
           object.  It returns $self, reblessed, with the correct member variables.

       initialize
           Override this in  each  derived  class  to  provide  class  specific  initialization.   For  example,
           initialize  may  put  arrays  into  member  variables that need them.  You must provide an initialize
           function.

       reformat
           Some line objects are implementing "lazy writing". This means that on writing an entry, they are only
           reformatted if they have been modified. The method reformat forces an object to be  reformatted  even
           if  its  content  has  not been modified. This may be useful e.g. to make sure the current formatting
           rules are applied.

       setEvidenceTags @array
           Sets the evidence tags of the object to the list passed in @array.

       addEvidenceTag string
           Adds the evidence tag to the object.

       deleteEvidenceTag string
           Deletes the evidence tag from the object.

       hasEvidenceTag string
           returns true if the object has the evidence tag.

       getEvidenceTags
           returns the array of evidence tags of the object

       Check4Clashes
           This function checks your classes member variable list for clashes with any class  that  it  inherits
           from  (any  class  that can(_containsFields) returns true on!).  If it detects that in any base class
           that any data members have been already defined, it dies with a  listing  of  the  variables  already
           used.

           It  stops  searching  a  root of an inheritance hierachy when it can find no baseclasses that support
           _containsFields.  It will find all clashes in an entire inheritance tree.

           So in the inheritance hierachy of

            SWISS::BaseClass -&gt; A -&gt; B -\
                                        &gt; E
            SWISS::BaseClass -&gt; C -&gt; D -/

           where E is the most derived class, if E contains names that clash with A members and names that clash
           with B members, both the A and B member clashes will be reported.

           If there were clashes with B and C, say, then again, all of the clashes would be reported.

       _containsFields
           This function is responsible for comparing a classes fields with the  set  in  the  calling  package.
           This  implimentation  will work for cases where all of the classes that contribute fields are derived
           from SWISS::BaseClass.  You may wish to make your own class fit this interface, so what follows is an
           interface API.

           _containsFields assumes that the first argument is the package that  it  is  being  called  in.   The
           following  arguments  are taken to be a list of fields which to check are not found in members of the
           current package.

           It should return either  "undef"  or  a  reference  to  an  array  of  name  clashes  in  the  format
           "package::variable".  It should call it's self for each parental class that supports this function.

           So it would look something like
             _containsFields {
               my $class = shift;
               my @toCheck = @_;

               foreach @toCheck {
                 check that they are not in me.  If they are, add them to the list of clashes to return.
               }

               add all base class clashes to your list of clashes

               if there were name clashes return a reference to them

               otherwise return undef
             }

       equal
           If two objects are equal, it returns true.

           Warning:  This  funktion  compares  two  objects using a simple dump in Perl format, see Data::Dumper
           module. The comparison also takes private variables into account. Therefore: If  the  method  'equal'
           returns  true,  the  objects  are  guaranteed to be equal, but it might return false although the two
           objects are equal in they public attributes.

       copy
           Returns a "deep copy" of the object.

</pre><h4><b>A</b> <b>skeletal</b> <b>derived</b> <b>class</b></h4><pre>
        package myDerived;

        use vars qw ( @ISA %fields );

        BEGIN {
           @ISA = ('SWISS::BaseClass');

           %fields = (
                      'i' =&gt; 1,
                      'hash' =&gt; undef
                      );

           myDerived-&gt;check4Clashes();
        }

        sub new {
           print "myDerived::new(@_)\n";
           my $class = shift;
           my $self = new SWISS::BaseClass;

           $self-&gt;rebless ($class);

           return $self;
        }

        sub initialize {
           my $self = shift;
           $self-&gt;{'hash'} = {};
        }

       A class derived from myDerived would just substitute the name myDerived for SWISS::BaseClass.  Hey presto
       - all sorted!
