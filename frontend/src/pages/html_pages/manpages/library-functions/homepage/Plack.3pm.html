</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Plack - Perl Superglue for Web frameworks and Web Servers (PSGI toolkit)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Plack is a set of tools for using the PSGI stack. It contains middleware components, a reference server
       and utilities for Web application frameworks. Plack is like Ruby's Rack or Python's Paste for WSGI.

       See PSGI for the PSGI specification and PSGI::FAQ to know what PSGI and Plack are and why we need them.

</pre><h4><b>MODULES</b> <b>AND</b> <b>UTILITIES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Plack::Handler</b>
       Plack::Handler and its subclasses contains adapters for web servers. We have adapters for the built-in
       standalone web server HTTP::Server::PSGI, CGI, FCGI, Apache1, Apache2 and HTTP::Server::Simple included
       in the core Plack distribution.

       There are also many HTTP server implementations on CPAN that have Plack handlers.

       See Plack::Handler when writing your own adapters.

   <b>Plack::Loader</b>
       Plack::Loader is a loader to load one Plack::Handler adapter and run a PSGI application code reference
       with it.

   <b>Plack::Util</b>
       Plack::Util contains a lot of utility functions for server implementors as well as middleware authors.

   <b>.psgi</b> <b>files</b>
       A PSGI application is a code reference but it's not easy to pass code reference via the command line or
       configuration files, so Plack uses a convention that you need a file named "app.psgi" or similar, which
       would be loaded (via perl's core function "do") to return the PSGI application code reference.

         # Hello.psgi
         my $app = sub {
             my $env = shift;
             # ...
             return [ $status, $headers, $body ];
         };

       If you use a web framework, chances are that they provide a helper utility to automatically generate
       these ".psgi" files for you, such as:

         # MyApp.psgi
         use MyApp;
         my $app = sub { MyApp-&gt;run_psgi(@_) };

       It's important that the return value of ".psgi" file is the code reference. See "eg/dot-psgi" directory
       for more examples of ".psgi" files.

   <b>plackup,</b> <b>Plack::Runner</b>
       plackup is a command line launcher to run PSGI applications from command line using Plack::Loader to load
       PSGI backends. It can be used to run standalone servers and FastCGI daemon processes. Other server
       backends like Apache2 needs a separate configuration but ".psgi" application file can still be the same.

       If you want to write your own frontend that replaces, or adds functionalities to plackup, take a look at
       the Plack::Runner module.

   <b>Plack::Middleware</b>
       PSGI middleware is a PSGI application that wraps an existing PSGI application and plays both side of
       application and servers. From the servers the wrapped code reference still looks like and behaves exactly
       the same as PSGI applications.

       Plack::Middleware gives you an easy way to wrap PSGI applications with a clean API, and compatibility
       with Plack::Builder DSL.

   <b>Plack::Builder</b>
       Plack::Builder gives you a DSL that you can enable Middleware in ".psgi" files to wrap existent PSGI
       applications.

   <b>Plack::Request,</b> <b>Plack::Response</b>
       Plack::Request gives you a nice wrapper API around PSGI $env hash to get headers, cookies and query
       parameters much like Apache::Request in mod_perl.

       Plack::Response does the same to construct the response array reference.

   <b>Plack::Test</b>
       Plack::Test is a unified interface to test your PSGI application using standard HTTP::Request and
       HTTP::Response pair with simple callbacks.

   <b>Plack::Test::Suite</b>
       Plack::Test::Suite is a test suite to test a new PSGI server backend.

</pre><h4><b>CONTRIBUTING</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Patches</b> <b>and</b> <b>Bug</b> <b>Fixes</b>
       Small patches and bug fixes can be either submitted via nopaste on IRC &lt;irc://irc.perl.org/#plack&gt; or the
       github issue tracker &lt;<a href="http://github.com/plack/Plack/issues">http://github.com/plack/Plack/issues</a>&gt;.  Forking on github
       &lt;<a href="http://github.com/plack/Plack">http://github.com/plack/Plack</a>&gt; is another good way if you intend to make larger fixes.

       See also &lt;<a href="http://contributing.appspot.com/plack">http://contributing.appspot.com/plack</a>&gt; when you think this document is terribly outdated.

   <b>Module</b> <b>Namespaces</b>
       Modules added to the Plack:: sub-namespaces should be reasonably generic components which are useful as
       building blocks and not just simply using Plack.

       Middleware authors are free to use the Plack::Middleware:: namespace for their middleware components.
       Middleware must be written in the pipeline style such that they can chained together with other
       middleware components.  The Plack::Middleware:: modules in the core distribution are good examples of
       such modules. It is recommended that you inherit from Plack::Middleware for these types of modules.

       Not all middleware components are wrappers, but instead are more like endpoints in a middleware chain.
       These types of components should use the Plack::App:: namespace. Again, look in the core modules to see
       excellent examples of these (Plack::App::File, Plack::App::Directory, etc.).  It is recommended that you
       inherit from Plack::Component for these types of modules.

       <b>DO</b> <b>NOT</b> <b>USE</b> Plack:: namespace to build a new web application or a framework. It's like naming your
       application under CGI:: namespace if it's supposed to run on CGI and that is a really bad choice and
       would confuse people badly.
