       CONTRIBUTING

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       Information on contributing to SVN::Web

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       If you interested in contributing to SVN::Web there are several areas that could definitely benefit from
       third party improvement.

   <b>Localising</b>
       All the English text in the templates <b>should</b> be localised.  This makes creating a new localisation as
       simple as adding the appropriate message catalog file to <u>lib/SVN/Web/I18N/</u>.  If you have taken the time
       to localise SVN::Web to your own language please send the message catalog to the maintainers for
       inclusion in future releases.

   <b>Templates</b>
       It is very easy to change SVN::Web's look by creating a new set of templates and adjusting the
       "templatedir" configuration directive.  If you've created a new template set (perhaps to have SVN::Web's
       output mimic that of another web based repository browser) then please contribute it back to the
       maintainers for inclusion in future releases.

   <b>New</b> <b>actions</b>
       SVN::Web's design makes it simple to add new actions.  See SVN::Web::action for details.

       If you've created a new action then please contribute it back to the maintainers for inclusion in future
       releases.

       Some ideas for new actions include:

       help
           Would display help to the user.

       atom
           Similar to the "rss" action, but generating ATOM format output instead.

       Or  look  on  CPAN for SVN related modules that could be usefully integrated.  Perhaps SVN::Log::Index or
       SVN::Churn could form the basis of useful actions.

   <b>Bug</b> <b>reports</b> <b>and</b> <b>fixes</b>
       Of course, if you discover any bugs in SVN::Web please report them back to the  maintainers.   It's  even
       more useful if you're able to include a test case that reliably reproduces the bug.

       Naturally,  fixes  for  these  bugs  are  even more useful.  Please see the "BUGS" in SVN::Web section in
       SVN::Web for information about reporting bugs.
