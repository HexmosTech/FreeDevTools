</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       SVN::Web - Subversion repository web frontend

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       If you are upgrading an existing SVN::Web installation then please see UPDATING.pod.  Installing new
       SVN::Web versions without making sure the configuration file, templates, and localisations are properly
       updated and merged will likely break your current installation.

       To get started with SVN::Web.

       1.  Create a directory for SVN::Web's configuration files, templates, stylesheets, and other data.

             mkdir svnweb

       2.  Run "svnweb-install" in this directory to configure the environment.

             cd svnweb
             svnweb-install

       3.  Edit the file <u>config.yaml</u> that's been created, and add the following two lines:

             repos:
               test: 'file:///path/to/repo'

           "file:///path/to/repo" should be the URL for an existing Subversion repository.

       4.  Either  configure your web server (see "WEB SERVERS") to use SVN::Web, or run with "plackup" to start
           a simple web server for testing.

             plackup -Ilib/ ./SVN-Web.psgi

       5.  Point your web browser at the correct URL to browse your repository.  If you've  run  "plackup"  then
           this is &lt;<a href="http://localhost">http://localhost</a>:5000/&gt;.

       See &lt;https://github.com/djzort/SVN-Web&gt; for the SVN::Web source code.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       SVN::Web provides a web interface to subversion repositories. It's features include:

       •   Viewing  multiple  Subversion  repositories.  SVN::Web is a full Subversion client, so you can access
           repositories on the local disk (with the "file:///" scheme) or that are remotely accessible using the
           "http://" and "svn://" schemes.

       •   Browsing every revision of the repository.

       •   Viewing the contents of files in the repository at any revision.

       •   Viewing diffs of arbitrary revisions of any file.  Diffs can be viewed as  plain  unified  diffs,  or
           HTML diffs that use colour to more easily show what's changed.

       •   Viewing the revision log of files and directories, see what was changed when, by who.

       •   Viewing the blame/annotation details of any file.

       •   Generating  RSS  feeds  of  commits,  down to the granularity of individual files.  The RSS feeds are
           auto-discoverable in modern web browsers.

       •   Viewing everything that was changed in a revision, and step through revisions one at a time,  viewing
           the history of the repository.

       •   Viewing  the  interface  in a number of different languages.  SVN::Web's interface is fully templated
           and localised, allowing you to change the look-and-feel without writing any code; all strings in  the
           interface are stored in a separate file, to make localising to different languages easier.

       •   Rich  log message linking.  You can configure SVN::Web to recognise patterns in your log messages and
           automatically generate links to other web based systems.  For example, if  your  log  messages  often
           refer to tickets in your request tracking system:

             Reported in: t#1234

           then  SVN::Web  can  turn  "t#1234"  in to a link to that ticket.  SVN::Web can also be configured to
           recognise e-mail addresses, URLs, and anything else you wish to make clickable.

       •   Caching.  Internally, SVN::Web caches most of the data it gets from the repository, helping to  speed
           up repeated visits to the same page, and reducing the impact on your repository server.

       •   As SVK repositories are also Subversion repositories, you can do all of the above with those too.

       Additional actions can easily be added to the base set supported by the core of SVN::Web.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       Various  aspects  of  SVN::Web's  behaviour can be controlled through the configuration file <u>config.yaml</u>.
       See the "YAML" documentation for information about writing YAML format files.

   <b>Version</b> <b>number</b>
       SVN::Web's configuration file must contain a version number.  If this number  is  missing,  or  does  not
       match the version number of the version of SVN::Web that is being used then a fatal error will occur.

         version: 0.53

   <b>Repositories</b>
       <u>Local</u> <u>and</u> <u>remote</u> <u>repositories</u>

       SVN::Web  can  show information from one or more Subversion repositories.  These repositories do not have
       to be located on the same server.

       Repositories are specified as a hash items under the "repos"  key.   Each  key  is  the  repository  name
       (defined by you), the value is the repository's URL.

       The three types of repository are specified like so.

         repos:
           my_local_repo: 'file:///path/to/local/repo'
           my_http_repo: '<a href="http://hostname/path">http://hostname/path</a>'
           my_svn_repo: 'svn://hostname/path'

       You may list as many repositories as you need.

       For  backwards  compatibility,  if  a repository URL is specified without a scheme, and starts with a "/"
       then the "file:///" scheme is assumed.  So

         repos:
           my_local_repo: /path/to/local/repo

       is also valid.

       <u>Local</u> <u>repositories</u> <u>under</u> <u>a</u> <u>single</u> <u>root</u>

       If you have multiple repositories that are all under a single parent directory then use "reposparent".

         reposparent: '/path/to/parent/directory'

       If you set "reposparent" then you can selectively block certain repositories  from  being  browseable  by
       specifying the "block" setting.

         block:
           - 'first_subdir_to_block'
           - 'second_subdir_to_block'

       "repos" and "reposparent" are mutually exclusive.

   <b>Templates</b>
       SVN::Web's  output  is  entirely  template  driven.   SVN::Web  ships with a number of different template
       styles, installed in to the <u>templates/</u> subdirectory of wherever you ran "svnweb-install".

       The default templates are installed in <u>templates/trac</u>.  These implement a look and feel  similar  to  the
       Trac (&lt;<a href="http://www.edgewall.com/trac/">http://www.edgewall.com/trac/</a>&gt;) output.

       To change to another set, use the "templatedirs" configuration directive.

       For example, to use a set of templates that implement a much plainer look and feel:

         templatedirs:
           - 'template/plain'

       Alternatively, if you have your own templates elsewhere you can specify a full path to the templates.

         templatedirs:
           - '/full/path/to/template/directory'

       You  can  specify  more  than  one  directory  in  this  list, and templates will be searched for in each
       directory in turn.  This makes it possible for actions that are not part of the  core  SVN::Web  to  ship
       their own templates, and for you to override specific templates of your choice.

       For example, if an action is using a template called "view", and "templatedirs" is configured like so:

         templatedirs:
           - '/my/local/templates'
           - '/templates/that/ship/with/svn-web'

       then  <u>/my/local/templates/view</u>  will first by checked.  If it exists the search terminates and it's used.
       If it does not exist then the search continues in <u>/templates/that/ship/with/svn-web</u>.

       For more information about writing your own templates see "ACTIONS, SUBCLASSES, AND URLS".

   <b>Languages</b>
       SVN::Web's interface is fully localised and ships  with  a  number  of  translations.   The  default  web
       interface  allows  the  user to choose from the available localisations at will, and the user's choice is
       saved in a cookie.

       <u>Localisation</u> <u>directories</u>

       SVN::Web's localisation information is stored in files with  names  that  take  the  form  <u>"language".po</u>.
       SVN::Web ships with a number of localisations that are automatically installed with SVN::Web.

       You  can  configure  SVN::Web  to  search  in  additional  directories for localisation files.  There are
       typically three reasons for this.

       1.  You wish to add support for a new language, and have placed your localisation files  in  a  different
           directory.

       2.  You  wish to change the localisation for a language that SVN::Web already supports, and don't wish to
           overwrite the localisation file that SVN::Web ships with.

       3.  You have installed a third party SVN::Web::action, and this  action  includes  its  own  localisation
           files stored in a different directory.

       Use  the  "language_dirs"  configuration  to  specify all the <u>additional</u> directories that SVN::Web should
       search.  For example:

         language_dirs:
           - /path/to/my/local/translation
           - /path/to/third/party/action/localisation

       If files in more than one directory contain the same localisation key for the same language then the file
       in the directory that is listed <u>last</u> in this directive will be used.

       <u>Available</u> <u>languages</u>

       "languages" specifies the localisations that are considered <u>available</u>.  This is a hash.  The keys are the
       basenames of available localisation files, the values are the language name as it should  appear  in  the
       interface.  "svnweb-install" will have set this to a default value.

       To  find  the available localisation files look in the <u>po/</u> directory that was created in the directory in
       which you ran "svnweb-install", and in the directories listed in the "language_dirs" directive (if any).

       For example, the default (as of SVN::Web 0.48) is:

         languages:
           en: English
           fr: Fran&amp;ccedil;ais
           zh_cn: Chinese (Simplified)
           zh_tw: Chinese (Traditional)

       <u>Default</u> <u>language</u>

       "default_language", specifies the language to use if the user has not selected one.  The value  for  this
       option should be one of the keys defined in "languages".  For example;

         default_language: fr

   <b>Data</b> <b>cache</b>
       SVN::Web  can  use any module implementing the Cache::Cache interface to cache the data it retrieves from
       the repository.  Since this data does not normally change this reduces the  time  it  takes  SVN::Web  to
       generate results.

       This cache is <b>not</b> enabled by default.

       To   enable   the   cache   you   must   specify  a  class  that  implements  a  Cache::Cache  interface.
       Cache::SizeAwareFileCache is a good choice.

         cache:
           class: Cache::SizeAwareFileCache

       The class' constructor may take various options.  Specify those under the "opts" key.

       For example, Cache::SizeAwareFileCache supports (among others) options called  "max_size",  "cache_root",
       and "directory_umask".  These could be configured like so:

         # Use the SizeAwareFileCache.  Place it under <a href="file:/var/tmp">/var/tmp</a> instead of
         # the default (<a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a>), use a custom umask, and limit the cache size to
         # 1MB
         cache:
           class: Cache::SizeAwareFileCache
           opts:
             max_size: 1000000
             cache_root: /var/tmp/svn-web-cache
             directory_umask: 077

       <b>Note:</b>  The  "namespace" option, if specified, is ignored, and is always set to the name of the repository
       being accessed.

   <b>Template</b> <b>cache</b>
       Template Toolkit can cache the results of template processing to make future processing faster.

       By default the cache is not enabled.  Use "tt_compile_dir" to enable it.  Set this directive to the  name
       of a directory where the UID that SVN::Web is being run as can create files.

       For example:

          tt_compile_dir: /var/tmp/tt-cache

       A literal "." and the UID of the process running SVN::Web will be appended to this string to generate the
       final  directory  name.  For example, if SVN::Web is being run under UID 80 then the final directory name
       is <u>/var/tmp/tt-cache.80</u>.  Since the cached templates are always created with mode 0600 this ensures  that
       different users running SVN::Web can not overwrite one another's cached templates.

       This directive has no default value.  If it is not defined then no caching will take place.

   <b>Log</b> <b>message</b> <b>filters</b>
       Many  of  the templates shipped with SVN::Web include log messages from the repository.  It's likely that
       these log messages contain e-mail addresses, links to other web sites, and other rich information.

       The Template::Toolkit makes it possible to filter these messages  through  one  or  more  plugins  and/or
       filters that can recognise these and insert additional markup to make them active.

       In  SVN::Web  this  is accomplished using a Template::Toolkit MACRO called "log_msg".  The <u>trac</u> templates
       define this in a template called <b>_</b><u>log_msg</u>, which is included in the relevant templates by this line:

         [% PROCESS _log_msg %]

       You may redefine this macro yourself to filter log messages through additional plugins depending on  your
       requirements.   As  a  MACRO  this  also  has  access to the template's variables, allowing you to easily
       specify different filters depending on the values of different variables (perhaps per-repository, or per-
       author filtering).  See the <b>_</b><u>log_msg</u> template included with this distribution for more details.

   <b>Time</b> <b>and</b> <b>date</b> <b>formatting</b>
       There are a number of places  in  the  web  interface  where  SVN::Web  will  display  a  timestamp  from
       Subversion.

       Internally,  Subversion  stores  times in UTC.  You may wish to show them in your local timezone (or some
       other timezone).  You may also wish to change the formatting of the timestamp.

       To do this use the "timezone" and "timedate_format" configuration options.

       "timezone" takes one of three settings.

       1.  If not set, or set to the empty string, SVN::Web will show all times in UTC.   This  is  the  default
           behaviour.

       2.  If  set  to  the  string  "local"  then SVN::Web will adjust all timestamps to the web server's local
           timezone (which may not be the same timezone as the server that hosts the repository).

       3.  If set to a timezone name, such as "BST" or "EST", then SVN::Web will adjust all timestamps  to  that
           timezone.

       When displaying timestamps SVN::Web uses the POSIX strftime() function.  You can change the format string
       that  is  provided,  thereby  changing  how  the  timestamp  is  formatted.   Use  the  "timedate_format"
       configuration directive for this.

       The default value is:

         timedate_format: '%Y/%m/%d %H:%M:%S'

       Using this format, a quarter past one in the afternoon on the 15th of May 2006 would appear as:

         2006/05/15 13:15:00

       If instead that was:

         timedate_format: '%a. %b %d, %l:%M%p'

       then the same timestamp would appear as:

         Mon. May 15, 1:15pm

       Note that <b><a href="../man3/strftime.3.html">strftime</a></b>(3) on different operating systems supports different  format  specifiers,  so  consult
       your system's <b><a href="../man3/strftime.3.html">strftime</a></b>(3) manual page to see which specifiers are available.

   <b>Actions,</b> <b>action</b> <b>classes,</b> <b>and</b> <b>action</b> <b>options</b>
       Each  action  that  SVN::Web can carry out is implemented as a class (see "ACTIONS, SUBCLASSES, AND URLS"
       for more).  You can specify your own class for a particular action.  This lets  you  implement  your  own
       actions, or override the behaviour of existing actions.

       The complete list of actions is listed in the "actions" configuration directive.

       If  you  delete  items from this list then the corresponding action becomes unavailable.  For example, if
       you would like to prevent people from retrieving an RSS feed of changes, just delete the  "-  rss"  entry
       from the list.

       To  provide  your  own behaviour for standard actions just specify a different value for the "class" key.
       For example, to specify your own class that implements the "view" action;

         actions:
           ...
           view:
             class: My::View::Class
           ...

       If you wish to implement your own action, give the action a name, add it to the "actions" list, and  then
       specify the class that carries out the action.

       For example, SVN::Web currently provides no action that generates ATOM feeds.  If you implement this, you
       would write:

         actions:
           ...
           atom:
             class: My::Class::That::Implements::Atom
           ...

       Please  feel  free to submit any classes that implement additional functionality back to the maintainers,
       so that they can be included in the distribution.

       Actions may have configurable options specified in <u>config.yaml</u> under  the  "opts"  key.   Continuing  the
       "annotate" example, the action may be written to provide basic output by default, but feature a "verbose"
       flag that you can enable globally.  That would be configured like so:

         actions:
           ...
           annotate:
             class: My::Class::That::Implements::Annotate
             opts:
               verbose: 1
           ...

       The  documentation  for  each  action  should  explain  in  more detail how it should be configured.  See
       SVN::Web::action for more information about writing actions.

       If an action is listed in "actions" and there is no corresponding "class" directive then  SVN::Web  takes
       the  action  name,  converts the first character to uppercase, and then looks for an "SVN::Web::&lt;Action&gt;"
       package.

   <b>Action</b> <b>menu</b> <b>configuration</b>
       In the user interface the "action menu" is a list of actions that are valid in the current context.  This
       menu is built up programmatically from additional metadata about each action included in the config file.

       The metadata is written as a hash, with each key corresponding to a particular piece  of  metadata.   The
       hash is rooted at the "action_menu" key.

       A worked example may prove instructive.  Here is the default entry for SVN::Web::RSS.  This shows all the
       valid keys under "action_menu".

         rss:
           class: SVN::Web::RSS
           action_menu:
             show:
               - file
               - directory
             link_text: (rss)
             head_only: 1
             icon: /css/trac/feed-icon-16x16.png

       The keys, and their meanings, are:

       show
           The  contexts in which this action should appear in the action menu.  Each SVN::Web action produces a
           result in a particular context.  The valid contexts are:

           file
               The action is acting on a single file.  E.g., SVN::Web::View or SVN::Web::Blame.

           directory
               The action is acting on a single directory.  E.g., SVN::Web::Browse.

           revision
               The action is acting on a single revision.  E.g., SVN::Web::Revision.

           Valid values are any of the three items above, plus the special value "global", indicating  that  the
           action should always appear in the action menu.

           In this example, the "rss" action is available when browsing directories and viewing files.  It makes
           no sense to make the RSS action available when browsing an individual revision, so that is not listed
           as a valid context.

       link_text
           The  text  that  should  appear  in  the  action menu for this item.  This text is passed through the
           localisation system.

       head_only
           A boolean that indicates whether the action is always available in the listed contexts, or whether it
           should only appear when viewing the HEAD revision in a particular context.

           In this example it makes no sense to clamp the RSS feed to a particular revision, so it is flagged as
           only being available when looking at the HEAD of a file or directory.

       icon
           The (relative) path to the icon to use for this menu item (if any).

       For comparison, this is the recommended setting for SVN::Web::Checkout.

         checkout:
           class: SVN::Web::Checkout
           action_menu:
             show:
               - file
             link_text: (checkout)

       This action is only valid when viewing files -- checking out a directory does not make sense.  A file can
       be checked out at any revision, so "head_only" can  be  omitted  ("head_only:  0"  would  have  the  same
       effect).  And there is no icon for this action.

       For details of how this information is used see the <u>template/trac/_action_menu</u> template.

       The  "action_menu"  metadata  is  optional.   Some actions might not merit a menu option (e.g., "diff" or
       "revision"), so those actions should not have "action_menu" metadata.

   <b>CGI</b> <b>class</b>
       SVN::Web can use a custom CGI class.  By default SVN::Web will use CGI::Fast  if  it  is  installed,  and
       fallback to using CGI otherwise.

       Of course, if you have your own class that implements the CGI interface you may specify it here too.

         cgi_class: 'My::CGI::Subclass'

</pre><h4><b>ACTIONS,</b> <b>SUBCLASSES,</b> <b>AND</b> <b>URLS</b></h4><pre>
       SVN::Web URLs are broken down in to four components.

         .../index.cgi/&lt;repo&gt;/&lt;action&gt;/&lt;path&gt;?&lt;arguments&gt;

       or

         .../apache-handler/&lt;repo&gt;/&lt;action&gt;/&lt;path&gt;?&lt;arguments&gt;

       <u>repo</u>
           The  repository  the  action will be performed on.  SVN::Web can be configured to operate on multiple
           Subversion repositories.

       <u>action</u>
           The action that will be run.

       <u>path</u>
           The path within the &lt;repository&gt; that the action is performed on.

       <u>arguments</u>
           Any arguments that control the behaviour of the <u>action</u>.

       Each action is implemented as a Perl module.  By convention, each module carries out whatever  processing
       is  required  by  the  action,  and  returns  a  reference  to  a hash of data that is used to fill out a
       "Template::Toolkit" template that displays the action's results.

       The standard actions, and the Perl modules that implement them, are:

       <u>blame</u>, <u>SVN::Web::Blame</u>
           Shows the blame (also called annotation) information for a file.  On a per line basis  it  shows  the
           revision in which that line was last changed and the user that committed the change.

       <u>browse</u>, <u>SVN::Web::Browse</u>
           Shows  the  files and directories in a given repository path.  This is the default command if no path
           is specified in the URL.

       <u>checkout</u>, <u>SVN::Web::Checkout</u>
           Returns the raw data for the file at a given repository path and revision.

       <u>diff</u>, <u>SVN::Web::Diff</u>
           Shows the difference between two revisions of the same file.

       <u>list</u>, <u>SVN::Web::List</u>
           Lists the available Subversion repositories.  This  is  the  default  command  if  no  repository  is
           specified in the URL.

       <u>log</u>, <u>SVN::Web::Log</u>
           Shows log information (commit messages) for a given repository path.

       <u>revision</u>, <u>SVN::Web::Revision</u>
           Shows information about a specific repository revision.

       <u>rss</u>, <u>SVN::Web::RSS</u>
           Generates an RSS feed of changes to the repository path.

       <u>view</u>, <u>SVN::Web::View</u>
           Shows the commit message and file contents for a specific repository path and revision.

       See  the documentation for each of these modules for more information about the data that they provide to
       each template, and for information about customising the templates used for each module.

</pre><h4><b>WEB</b> <b>SERVERS</b></h4><pre>
       This section explains  how  to  configure  some  common  webservers  to  run  SVN::Web.   In  all  cases,
       "/path/to/svnweb" in the examples is the directory you ran "svnweb-install" in, and contains <u>config.yaml</u>.

       SVN::Web  now  uses  Plack  to  provide  connectivity  to the web server.  Previously a cgi, stand alone,
       fastcgi, mod_perl1 and a mod_perl2 interface was provided as part of this software.  All  of  which  have
       been  removed  and  replaced  by Plack. In doing so, Plack now will connect SVN::Web to all of the above,
       plus PSGI, nginx_perl and anything else cooked up in the future.

       If you've configured a web server that isn't listed here for SVN::Web, please send in the instructions so
       they can be included in a future release.

   <b>plackup</b>
       "plackups" is a simple web server that can run SVN::Web stand alone, and is  included  and  installed  by
       Plack.   It  may be all you need to productively use SVN::Web without needing to install a larger server.
       To use it, run:

         plackup SVN-Web.psgi

       See "perldoc plackup" for details about additional options you can use.

   <b>Apache</b> <b>as</b> <b>CGI</b> <b>(not</b> <b>recommended)</b>
       See Plack::Handler::CGI

   <b>Apache</b> <b>with</b> <b>mod_perl</b> <b>or</b> <b>mod_perl2</b>
       See Plack::Handler::Apache1 or Plack::Handler::Apache2 respectively.

   <b>Apache</b> <b>with</b> <b>FastCGI</b>
       See Plack::Handler::FCGI

   <b>IIS</b>
       For now this is probably broken.
