</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Web::ID::Certificate::Generator - role for Web::ID::Certificate

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        use Web::ID::Certificate::Generator;

        my %options = (
          cert_output       =&gt; '/home/alice/webid.p12',
          passphrase        =&gt; 's3cr3t s0urc3',
          rdf_output        =&gt; '/home/alice/public_html/foaf.rdf',
          subject_alt_names =&gt; [
            Web::ID::SAN::URI-&gt;new(
              value =&gt; '<a href="http://example.com/~alice/foaf.rdf">http://example.com/~alice/foaf.rdf</a>#me',
            ),
            Web::ID::SAN::Email-&gt;new(
              value =&gt; '<a href="mailto:alice@example.com">alice@example.com</a>',
            ),
          ],
          subject_name      =&gt; 'Alice Jones',
          subject_locality  =&gt; 'Lewes',
          subject_region    =&gt; 'East Sussex',
          subject_country   =&gt; 'GB',   # ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code
        );

        my $cert = Web::ID::Certificate-&gt;generate(%options);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This is a role that may be applied to Web::ID::Certificate. It is not consumed by Web::ID::Certificate by
       default as I was trying to avoid tainting the class with the horror that's found in this role.

       The "import" routine of this package applies the role to Web::ID::Certificate, so it is sufficient to do:

        use Web::ID::Certificate::Generator;

       You don't need to muck around with "apply_all_roles" yourself.

   <b>Constructor</b>
       "generate(%options)"
           Generates a brand new WebID-enabled certificate.

   <b>Options</b>
       The following options can be passed to "generator"

       •   "cert_output"

           A  passphrase-protected  PKCS12  certificate  file is generated as part of the certificate generation
           process. The PKCS12 file is what you'd typically import into a browser.

           You can pass a scalar reference, in which case the PKCS12 data will be written to that scalar;  or  a
           file handle or string file name.

           This is a required option.

       •   "passphrase"

           The password for the PKCS12 file.

           This is a required option.

       •   "rdf_output"

           RDF data is also generated as part of the certificate generation process.

           Again a file handle or string file name can be passed, or an RDF::Trine::Model.

           This is a required option.

       •   "subject_alt_names"

           List  of  Web::ID::SAN objects to generate the certificate's subjectAltNames field. You want at least
           one Web::ID::SAN::URI in there.

           This is a required option.

       •   "subject_name"

           The name of the person who will hold the certificate. (e.g. "Alice Smith".)

           This is a required option.

       •   "subject_org"

           The certificate holder's organisation.

           Not required.

       •   "subject_locality"

           The locality (e.g. city) of the certificate holder's address.

           Not required.

       •   "subject_region"

           The region (e.g. state or county) of the certificate holder's address.

           Not required.

       •   "subject_country"

           Two letter ISO code for the country of the certificate holder's address.

           Not required.

       •   "openssl_path"

           The path to the OpenSSL binary. Yes that's right, this role calls the  OpenSSL  binary  via  "system"
           calls. Defaults to automatic discovery via Web::ID::Util::FindOpenSSL.

       •   "key_size"

           Key size in bits. Defaults to 1024. Bigger keys are more secure. Keys bigger than 2048 bits will take
           a ridiculously long time to generate.  Keys less than 512 bits are pretty poor.

       •   "not_after"

           Date when the certificate should expire, as a DateTime object.  Defaults to 365 days.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Generating the private key results in shedloads of nasty crud being spewed out on STDERR.
