</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Math::Polygon - Class for maintaining polygon data

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        my $poly = Math::Polygon-&gt;new( [1,2], [2,4], [5,7], [1,2] );
        print $poly-&gt;nrPoints;
        my @p    = $poly-&gt;points;

        my ($xmin, $ymin, $xmax, $ymax) = $poly-&gt;bbox;

        my $area   = $poly-&gt;area;
        my $l      = $poly-&gt;perimeter;
        if($poly-&gt;isClockwise) { ... };

        my $rot    = $poly-&gt;startMinXY;
        my $center = $poly-&gt;centroid;
        if($poly-&gt;contains($point)) { ... };

        my $boxed  = $poly-&gt;lineClip($xmin, $xmax, $ymin, $ymax);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This class provides an Object Oriented interface around Math::Polygon::Calc, Math::Polygon::Clip, and
       other.  Together, these modules provide basic transformations on 2D polygons in pure perl.

       <b>WARNING:</b> these computations may show platform dependent rounding differences.  These may also originate
       from compilation options of the Perl version you installed.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Constructors</b>
       $obj-&gt;<b>new</b>(%options, [@points], %options)
       Math::Polygon-&gt;<b>new</b>(%options, [@points], %options)
           You  may  add  %options before and/or after the @points.  You may also use the "points" option to set
           the points.  Each point in @points is (a references) to an ARRAY with two elements:  an  X  and  a  Y
           coordinate.

           When  new()  is  called  as  instance method, it is believed that the new polygon is derived from the
           callee, and therefore some facts (like clockwise or anti-clockwise direction) will get copied  unless
           overruled.

            -Option   --Default
             bbox       undef
             clockwise  undef
             points     undef

           bbox =&gt; [$xmin,$ymin, $xmax,$ymax]
             Usually computed from the shape automatically, but can also be overruled. See <b>bbox()</b>.

           clockwise =&gt; BOOLEAN
             Is not specified, it will be computed by the <b>isClockwise()</b> method on demand.

           points =&gt; \@points
             See <b>points()</b> and <b>nrPoints()</b>.

           example: creation of new polygon

            my $p = Math::Polygon-&gt;new([1,0],[1,1],[0,1],[0,0],[1,0]);

            my @p = ([1,0],[1,1],[0,1],[0,0],[1,0]);
            my $p = Math::Polygon-&gt;new(points =&gt; \@p);

   <b>Attributes</b>
       $obj-&gt;<b>nrPoints</b>()
           Returns the number of points,

       $obj-&gt;<b>order</b>()
           Returns the number of (unique?) points: one less than <b>nrPoints()</b>.

       $obj-&gt;<b>point</b>( $index, [$index,...] )
           Returns  the point with the specified $index or INDEXES.  In SCALAR context, only the first $index is
           used.

           example:

             my $point = $poly-&gt;<a href="../man2/point.2.html">point</a>(2);
             my ($first, $last) = $poly-&gt;point(0, -1);

       $obj-&gt;<b>points</b>( [FORMAT] )
           In LIST context, the points are returned as list, otherwise as reference to an ARRAY of points.

           [1.09] When a FORMAT is given, each coordinate will get  processed.   This  may  be  useful  to  hide
           platform  specific  rounding errors.  FORMAT may be a CODE reference or a printf() alike string.  See
           <b>Math::Polygon::Calc::polygon_format()</b>.

           example:

             my @points = $poly-&gt;points;
             my $first  = $points[0];
             my $x0 = $points[0][0];    # == $first-&gt;[0]  --&gt; X
             my $y0 = $points[0][1];    # == $first-&gt;[1]  --&gt; Y

             my @points = $poly-&gt;points("%.2f");

   <b>Geometry</b>
       $obj-&gt;<b>area</b>()
           Returns the area enclosed by the polygon.  The last point of the list must be the same as  the  first
           to     produce    a    correct    result.     The    computed    result    is    cached.     Function
           <b>Math::Polygon::Calc::polygon_area()</b>.

           example:

             my $area = $poly-&gt;area;
             print "$area $poly_units ^2\n";

       $obj-&gt;<b>bbox</b>()
           Returns a list with four elements: (xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax), which describe the bounding box  of  the
           polygon  (all  points  of  the  polygon  are  inside  that  area).  The computation is expensive, and
           therefore, the results are cached.  Function <b>Math::Polygon::Calc::polygon_bbox()</b>.

           example:

             my ($xmin, $ymin, $xmax, $ymax) = $poly-&gt;bbox;

       $obj-&gt;<b>beautify</b>(%options)
           Returns a new, beautified version of this polygon.  Function <b>Math::Polygon::Calc::polygon_beautify()</b>.

           Polygons, certainly after some computations, can have a lot of horrible artifacts: points  which  are
           double,  spikes,  etc.   This  functions  provided  by  this  module beautify them.  A new polygon is
           returned.

            -Option       --Default
             remove_spikes  &lt;false&gt;

           remove_spikes =&gt; BOOLEAN
       $obj-&gt;<b>centroid</b>()
           Returns the centroid location of the polygon.  The last point of the list must be  the  same  as  the
           first    to    produce    a   correct   result.    The   computed   result   is   cached.    Function
           <b>Math::Polygon::Calc::polygon_centroid()</b>.

           example:

             my $center = $poly-&gt;centroid;
             my ($cx, $cy) = @$center;

       $obj-&gt;<b>clockwise</b>()
           Make sure the points are in clockwise order.

           example:

             $poly-&gt;clockwise;

       $obj-&gt;<b>contains</b>($point)
           Returns a truth value indicating whether the point is inside the polygon or  not.   On  the  edge  is
           inside.

       $obj-&gt;<b>counterClockwise</b>()
           Make sure the points are in counter-clockwise order.

           example:

             $poly-&gt;counterClockwise

       $obj-&gt;<b>distance</b>($point)
           [1.05]  Returns  the distance of the point to the closest point on the border of the polygon, zero if
           the point is on an edge.

       $obj-&gt;<b>equal</b>( &lt;$other | \@points,[$tolerance]&gt; | $points )
           Compare two polygons, on the level of points. When the polygons are the same but rotated,  this  will
           return false. See <b>same()</b>.  Function <b>Math::Polygon::Calc::polygon_equal()</b>.

           example:

             if($poly-&gt;equal($other_poly, 0.1)) ...
             if($poly-&gt;equal(\@points, 0.1)) ...
             if($poly-&gt;equal(@points)) ...

       $obj-&gt;<b>isClockwise</b>()
           The  points  are (in majority) orded in the direction of the hands of the clock.  This calculation is
           quite expensive (same effort as calculating the area of the polygon), and  the  result  is  therefore
           cached.

           example:

             if($poly-&gt;isClockwise) ...

       $obj-&gt;<b>isClosed</b>()
           Returns true if the first point of the poly definition is the same as the last point.

       $obj-&gt;<b>perimeter</b>()
           The  length  of the line of the polygon.  This can also be used to compute the length of any line: of
           the last point is not equal to the first, then a line is presumed; for a  polygon  they  must  match.
           Function <b>Math::Polygon::Calc::polygon_perimeter()</b>.

           example:

            my $fence = $poly-&gt;perimeter;
            print "fence length: $fence $poly_units\n"

       $obj-&gt;<b>same</b>( &lt;$other_polygon | \@points, [$tolerance]&gt; | @points )
           Compare  two  polygons,  where the polygons may be rotated wrt each other. This is (much) slower than
           <b>equal()</b>, but  some  algorithms  will  cause  un  unpredictable  rotation  in  the  result.   Function
           <b>Math::Polygon::Calc::polygon_same()</b>.

           example:

             if($poly-&gt;same($other_poly, 0.1)) ...
             if($poly-&gt;same(\@points, 0.1)) ...
             if($poly-&gt;same(@points)) ...

       $obj-&gt;<b>startMinXY</b>()
           Returns  a  new  polygon  object,  where the points are rotated in such a way that the point which is
           losest to the left-bottom point of the bounding box has become the first.

           Function <b>Math::Polygon::Calc::polygon_start_minxy()</b>.

   <b>Transformations</b>
       Implemented in Math::Polygon::Transform: changes on the structure of the polygon  except  clipping.   All
       functions return a new polygon object or undef.

       $obj-&gt;<b>grid</b>(%options)
           Returns    a    polygon    object    with    the    points    snapped    to    grid    points.    See
           <b>Math::Polygon::Transform::polygon_grid()</b>.

            -Option--Default
             raster  1.0

           raster =&gt; FLOAT
             The raster size, which determines the points to round to.  The origin "[0,0]" is always on a  grid-
             point.  When the raster value is zero, no transformation will take place.

       $obj-&gt;<b>mirror</b>(%options)
           Mirror  the  polygon  in  a  line.  Only one of the options can be provided.  Some programs call this
           "flip" or "flop".

            -Option--Default
             b       0
             line    &lt;undef&gt;
             rc      undef
             x       undef
             y       undef

           b =&gt; FLOAT
             Only used in combination with option "rc" to describe a line.

           line =&gt; [POINT, POINT]
             Alternative way to specify the mirror line.  The "rc" and "b" are computed from the two  points  of
             the line.

           rc =&gt; FLOAT
             Description  of  the  line  which  is  used to mirror in. The line is "y= rc*x+b".  The "rc" equals
             "-dy/dx", the firing angle.  If "undef" is explicitly specified then "b" is  used  as  constant  x:
             it's a vertical mirror.

           x =&gt; FLOAT
             Mirror in the line "x=value", which means that "y" stays unchanged.

           y =&gt; FLOAT
             Mirror in the line "y=value", which means that "x" stays unchanged.

       $obj-&gt;<b>move</b>(%options)
           Returns   a   moved   polygon  object:  all  point  are  moved  over  the  indicated  distance.   See
           <b>Math::Polygon::Transform::polygon_move()</b>.

            -Option--Default
             dx      0
             dy      0

           dx =&gt; FLOAT
             Displacement in the horizontal direction.

           dy =&gt; FLOAT
             Displacement in the vertical direction.

       $obj-&gt;<b>resize</b>(%options)
           Returns a resized polygon object.  See <b>Math::Polygon::Transform::polygon_resize()</b>.

            -Option--Default
             center  [0,0]
             scale   1.0
             xscale  &lt;scale&gt;
             yscale  &lt;scale&gt;

           center =&gt; $point
           scale =&gt; FLOAT
             Resize the polygon with the indicated factor.  When the factor is  larger  than  1,  the  resulting
             polygon  with  grow,  when small it will be reduced in size.  The scale will be respective from the
             center.

           xscale =&gt; FLOAT
             Specific scaling factor in the horizontal direction.

           yscale =&gt; FLOAT
             Specific scaling factor in the vertical direction.

       $obj-&gt;<b>rotate</b>(%options)
           Returns  a  rotated  polygon  object:  all  point  are  moved  over  the  indicated  distance.    See
           <b>Math::Polygon::Transform::polygon_rotate()</b>.

            -Option --Default
             center   [0,0]
             degrees  0
             radians  0

           center =&gt; POINT
           degrees =&gt; FLOAT
             specify rotation angle in degrees (between -180 and 360).

           radians =&gt; FLOAT
             specify rotation angle in rads (between -pi and 2*pi)

       $obj-&gt;<b>simplify</b>(%options)
           Returns a polygon object where points are removed.  See <b>Math::Polygon::Transform::polygon_simplify()</b>.

            -Option    --Default
             max_points  undef
             same        0.0001
             slope       undef

           max_points =&gt; INTEGER
             First,  "same"  and  "slope"  reduce  the number of points.  Then, if there are still more than the
             specified number of points left, the points with the  widest  angles  will  be  removed  until  the
             specified maximum number is reached.

           same =&gt; FLOAT
             The  distance between two points to be considered "the same" point.  The value is used as radius of
             the circle.

           slope =&gt; FLOAT
             With three points X(n),X(n+1),X(n+2), the point X(n+1) will be removed if the length  of  the  path
             over all three points is less than "slope" longer than the direct path between X(n) and X(n+2).

             The  slope  will  not  be  removed  around the starting point of the polygon.  Removing points will
             change the area of the polygon.

   <b>Clipping</b>
       $obj-&gt;<b>fillClip1</b>($box)
           Clipping a polygon into rectangles can be done in various ways.  With this algorithm,  the  parts  of
           the  polygon  which  are outside the $box are mapped on the borders.  The polygon stays in one piece,
           but may have vertices which are followed in two directions.

           Returned is one polygon, which is cleaned from double points,  spikes  and  superfluous  intermediate
           points,     or     "undef"     when     no     polygon     is    outside    the    $box.     Function
           <b>Math::Polygon::Clip::polygon_fill_clip1()</b>.

       $obj-&gt;<b>lineClip</b>($box)
           Returned is a list of ARRAYS-OF-POINTS containing line  pieces  from  the  input  polygon.   Function
           <b>Math::Polygon::Clip::polygon_line_clip()</b>.

   <b>Display</b>
       $obj-&gt;<b>string</b>( [FORMAT] )
           Print the polygon.

           [1.09]  When a FORMAT is specified, all coordinates will get formatted first.  This may hide platform
           dependent rounding differences.
