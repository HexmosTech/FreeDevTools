</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       PPUNTR - generates and returns a set of trapezoids representing the interior of the "union" polygon,
       which consists of all points that are inside either or both of the clip polygon and the subject polygon.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       CALL PPUNTR (XCCP,YCCP,NCCP,XCSP,YCSP,NCSP,RWRK,IWRK,NWRK,URPT,IERR)

</pre><h4><b>C-BINDING</b> <b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;ncarg/ncargC.h&gt;

       void c_ppuntr(
            float *xccp,
            float *yccp,
            int nccp,
            float *xcsp,

            int *iwrk,
            int nwrk,
            int (*urpt_)(float *xcbl,
                         float *xcbr,
                         float *ycob,
                         float *dxle,
                         float *dxre,
                         float *ycot),
            int *ierr)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       XCCP        (an input array of type REAL) is the X coordinate array for the clip polygon.

       YCCP        (an input array of type REAL) is the Y coordinate array for the clip polygon.

       NCCP        (an input expression of type INTEGER) is the number of points defining the clip polygon.

       XCSP        (an input array of type REAL) is the X coordinate array for the subject polygon.

       YCSP        (an input array of type REAL) is the Y coordinate array for the subject polygon.

       NCSP        (an input expression of type INTEGER) is the number of points defining the subject polygon.

       RWRK        (a  scratch array, dimensioned NWRK, of type REAL) is a real workspace array.  Because of the
                   way in which they are used, RWRK and IWRK may be  EQUIVALENCEd  (and,  to  save  space,  they
                   should be).

       IWRK        (a  scratch array, dimensioned NWRK, of type INTEGER) is an integer workspace array.  Because
                   of the way in which they are used, RWRK and IWRK may be EQUIVALENCEd  (and,  to  save  space,
                   they should be).

       NWRK        (an  input expression of type INTEGER) is the length of the workspace array(s).  The routines
                   that produce trapezoids use a lot less workspace than the ones that  produce  polygons.   The
                   amount  of  space  used at a particular time during the execution of one of these routines is
                   roughly ten or eleven times the number of intersections of a horizontal "scan line" with  the
                   edge segments making up the input polygons, plus about three times the number of points above
                   the  current  scan line that are "local minima".  (A "local minimum" is a point on one of the
                   polygons that is connected to two other points on the polygon  having  larger  Y  coordinates
                   than  its  own).   I  have  not  yet developed a rule of thumb for setting the value of NWRK.
                   Ultimately, I would like to at least put in an internal parameter that will tell one how much
                   space was actually used on a given call, but I have not yet done so.

       URPT        is the name of a user-provided routine to process the trapezoids.  This name must  appear  in
                   an  EXTERNAL  statement in the routine that calls PPUNTR and the routine itself must have the
                   following form:

                        SUBROUTINE URPP (XCBL,XCBR,YCOB,DXLE,DXRE,YCOT)
                          ...(code to process a trapezoid)...
                          RETURN
                        END

                   The bottom and top of the trapezoid are horizontal (parallel to the X  axis);  the  arguments
                   XCBL  and  XCBR define the X coordinates of its bottom left and bottom right corners, YCOB is
                   the Y coordinate of its bottom edge, DXLE and DXRE are the inverses (dx/dy) of the slopes  of
                   its  left  and  right edges, and YCOT is the Y coordinate of its top edge. The corners of the
                   trapezoid are therefore as follows: (XCBL,YCOB),  (XCBR,YCOB),  (XCBL+DXLE*(YCOT-YCOB),YCOT),
                   and (XCBR+DXRE*(YCOT-YCOB),YCOT).

       IERR        (an output variable of type INTEGER) is returned with the value zero if no errors occurred in
                   the  execution  of  PPUNTR or with a small positive value if an error did occur.  The value 1
                   indicates that a degenerate clip polygon was detected, the value 2 that a degenerate  subject
                   polygon  was  detected,  and  the  value  3 that the workspace provided was too small; values
                   greater than 3 should be reported to the author, as they probably indicate some problem  with
                   the  algorithm.   If IERR is returned non-zero, one can be sure that there have been no calls
                   to URPT only if IERR = 1 or 2; otherwise, some trapezoids probably have  been  generated  and
                   delivered to URPT.

</pre><h4><b>C-BINDING</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The C-binding argument descriptions are the same as the FORTRAN argument descriptions.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       The FORTRAN statement

       CALL PPUNTR (XCCP,YCCP,NCCP,XCSP,YCSP,NCSP,RWRK,IWRK,NWRK,URPT,IERR)

       causes the formation of a union polygon (of the subject and clip polygons) and the delivery of trapezoids
       representing  the  interior  of  that  polygon, one at a time, to the user-specified trapezoid-processing
       routine URPT.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Use the ncargex command to see the following relevant examples: ppex01, tppack, c_ppex01.

</pre><h4><b>ACCESS</b></h4><pre>
       To use PPUNTR or c_ppuntr, load the NCAR Graphics libraries ncarg, ncarg_gks, and ncarg_c, preferably  in
       that order.
