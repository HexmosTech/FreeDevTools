</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Polypack - a set of routines allowing polygons to be manipulated in various ways. Each of the six
       principal routines is given a "clip" polygon, a "subject" polygon, and a workspace; it operates on the
       two polygons in some way to create either a derivative polygon or a set of trapezoids representing the
       interior of that derivative polygon and then passes these on to a user-specified processing routine.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       PPDIPO - generates and returns the boundary of the "difference" polygon, which consists of all points
       that are inside the subject polygon but not inside the clip polygon.

       PPINPO - generates and returns the boundary of the "intersection" polygon, which consists of all points
       that are inside both the clip polygon and the subject polygon.

       PPUNPO - generates and returns the boundary of the "union" polygon, which consists of all points that are
       inside either or both of the clip polygon and the subject polygon.

       PPDITR - generates and returns a set of trapezoids representing the interior of the "difference" polygon,
       which consists of all points that are inside the subject polygon but not inside the clip polygon.

       PPINTR - generates and returns a set of trapezoids representing the interior of the "intersection"
       polygon, which consists of all points that are inside both the clip polygon and the subject polygon.

       PPUNTR - generates and returns a set of trapezoids representing the interior of the "union" polygon,
       which consists of all points that are inside either or both of the clip polygon and the subject polygon.

       PPPPAP - can be called to preprocess a polygon in such a way as to remove certain peculiarities that can
       cause minor cosmetic errors in the output from the routines that return trapezoids.

       PPPLCL - clips a polyline against a clipping rectangle. It is intended that, eventually, there should be
       a better routine that will clip a polyline against an arbitrary polygon, but that routine has not yet
       been written.

</pre><h4><b>ACCESS</b></h4><pre>
       To use Polypack routines, load the NCAR Graphics libraries ncarg, ncarg_gks, and ncarg_c, preferably in
       that order.

</pre><h4><b>MESSAGES</b></h4><pre>
       None.  All error conditions in Polypack routines are reported by means of an error-flag argument.
