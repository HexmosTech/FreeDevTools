       HTTP::Throwable::Factory - a factory that throws HTTP::Throwables for you

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 0.028

</pre><h4><b>OVERVIEW</b></h4><pre>
       HTTP::Throwable is a role that makes it easy to build exceptions that, once thrown, can be turned into
       PSGI-style HTTP responses.  Because HTTP::Throwable and all its related roles are, well, roles, they
       can't be instantiated or thrown directly.  Instead, they must be built into classes first.
       HTTP::Throwable::Factory takes care of this job, building classes out of the roles you need for the
       exception you want to throw.

       You can use the factory to either <u>build</u> or <u>throw</u> an exception of either a <u>generic</u> or <u>specific</u> type.
       Building and throwing are very similar -- the only difference is whether or not the newly built object is
       thrown or returned.  To throw an exception, use the "throw" method on the factory.  To return it, use the
       "new_exception" method.  In the examples below, we'll just use "throw".

       To throw a generic exception -- one where you must specify the status code and reason, and any other
       headers -- you pass "throw" a hashref of arguments that will be passed to the exception class's
       constructor.

         HTTP::Throwable::Factory-&gt;throw({
             status_code =&gt; 301,
             reason      =&gt; 'Moved Permanently',
             additional_headers =&gt; [
               Location =&gt; '/new',
             ],
         });

       To throw a specific type of exception, include an exception type identifier, like this:

         HTTP::Throwable::Factory-&gt;throw(MovedPermanently =&gt; { location =&gt; '/new' });

       The type identifier is (by default) the end of a role name in the form
       "HTTP::Throwable::Role::Status::IDENTIFIER".  The full list of such included roles is given in the
       HTTP::Throwable docs.

   <b>Exports</b>
       You can import routines called "http_throw" and "http_exception" that work like the "throw" and
       "new_exception" methods, respectively, but are not called as methods.  For example:

         use HTTP::Throwable::Factory 'http_exception';

         builder {
             mount '/old' =&gt; http_exception('Gone'),
         };

</pre><h4><b>PERL</b> <b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This library should run on perls released even a long time ago.  It should work on any version of perl
       released in the last five years.

       Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made that the minimum required version
       will not be increased.  The version may be increased for any reason, and there is no promise that patches
       will be accepted to lower the minimum required perl.

</pre><h4><b>SUBCLASSING</b></h4><pre>
       One of the big benefits of using HTTP::Throwable::Factory is that you can subclass it to change the kind
       of exceptions it provides.

       If you subclass it, you can change its behavior by overriding the following methods -- provided in the
       order of likelihood that you'd want to override them, most likely first.

   <b>extra_roles</b>
       This method returns a list of role names that will be included in any class built by the factory.  By
       default, it includes only HTTP::Throwable::Role::TextBody to satisfy HTTP::Throwable's requirements for
       methods needed to build a body.

       This is the method you're most likely to override in a subclass.

   <b>roles_for_ident</b>
   <b>roles_for_status_code</b>
   <b>roles_for_no_ident</b>
       This methods convert the exception type identifier to a role to apply.  For example, if you call:

         Factory-&gt;throw(NotFound =&gt; { ... })

       ...then "roles_for_ident" is called with "NotFound" as its argument.  "roles_for_status_code" is used if
       the string is three ASCII digits.

       If "throw" is called <u>without</u> a type identifier, "roles_for_no_ident" is called.

       By default, "roles_for_ident" returns "HTTP::Throwable::Role::Status::$ident" and "roles_for_no_ident"
       returns HTTP::Throwable::Role::Generic and HTTP::Throwable::Role::BoringText.

   <b>base_class</b>
       This is the base class that will be subclassed and into which all the roles will be composed.  By
       default, it is Moo::Object, the universal base Moo class.

   <b>core_roles</b>
       This method returns the roles that are expected to be applied to every HTTP::Throwable exception.  This
       method's results might change over time, and you are encouraged <u><b>not</b></u> to alter it.
