</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       HTTP::Throwable::Role::Status::SeeOther - 303 See Other

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 0.028

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The response to the request can be found under a different URI and SHOULD be retrieved using a GET method
       on that resource.  This method exists primarily to allow the output of a POST-activated script to
       redirect the user agent to a selected resource. The new URI is not a substitute reference for the
       originally requested resource. The 303 response MUST NOT be cached, but the response to the second
       (redirected) request might be cacheable.

       The different URI SHOULD be given by the Location field in the response. Unless the request method was
       HEAD, the entity of the response SHOULD contain a short hypertext note with a hyperlink to the new
       URI(s).

</pre><h4><b>PERL</b> <b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This library should run on perls released even a long time ago.  It should work on any version of perl
       released in the last five years.

       Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made that the minimum required version
       will not be increased.  The version may be increased for any reason, and there is no promise that patches
       will be accepted to lower the minimum required perl.
