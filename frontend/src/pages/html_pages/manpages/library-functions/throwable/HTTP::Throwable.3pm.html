</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       HTTP::Throwable - a set of strongly-typed, PSGI-friendly HTTP 1.1 exception libraries

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 0.028

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ACHTUNG</b>:  The interface for HTTP::Throwable has changed significantly between 0.005 and 0.010.  Further
       backward incompatibilities may appear in the next few weeks, as the interface is refined.  This notice
       will be removed when it has stabilized.

       <u>Actually</u>, you probably want to use HTTP::Throwable::Factory, so here's a sample of how that works:

         use HTTP::Throwable::Factory qw(http_throw http_exception);

         # you can just throw a generic exception...
         HTTP::Throwable::Factory-&gt;throw({
             status_code =&gt; 500,
             reason      =&gt; 'Internal Server Error',
             message     =&gt; 'Something has gone very wrong!'
         });

         # or with a little sugar...
         http_throw({
             status_code =&gt; 500,
             reason      =&gt; 'Internal Server Error',
             message     =&gt; 'Something has gone very wrong!'
         });

         # ...but it's much more convenient to throw well-defined exceptions, like
         # this:

         http_throw(InternalServerError =&gt; {
           message =&gt; 'Something has gone very wrong!',
         });

         # or you can use the exception objects as PSGI apps:
         builder {
             mount '/old' =&gt; http_exception(MovedPermanently =&gt; { location =&gt; '/new' }),
             # ...
         };

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       HTTP-Throwable provides a set of strongly-typed, PSGI-friendly exception implementations corresponding to
       the HTTP error status code (4xx-5xx) as well as the redirection codes (3xx).

       This particular package (HTTP::Throwable) is the shared role for all the exceptions involved.  It's not
       intended that you use HTTP::Throwable directly, although you can, and instructions for using it correctly
       are given below.  Instead, you probably want to use HTTP::Throwable::Factory, which will assemble
       exception classes from roles needed to build an exception for your use case.

       For example, you can throw a redirect:

         use HTTP::Throwable::Factory qw(http_throw);

         http_throw(MovedPermanently =&gt; { location =&gt; '/foo-bar' });

       ...or a generic fully user-specified exception...

         http_throw({
           status_code =&gt; 512,
           reason      =&gt; 'Server on fire',
           message     =&gt; "Please try again after heavy rain",
         });

       For a list of pre-defined, known errors, see "WELL-KNOWN TYPES" below.  These types will have the correct
       status code and reason, and will understand extra status-related arguments like redirect location or
       authentication realms.

       For information on using HTTP::Throwable directly, see "COMPOSING WITH HTTP::THROWABLE", below.

   <b>HTTP::Exception</b>
       This module is similar to HTTP::Exception with a few, well uhm, exceptions. First, we are not
       implementing the 1xx and 2xx status codes, it is this authors opinion that those not being errors or an
       exception control flow (redirection) should not be handled with exceptions. And secondly, this module is
       very PSGI friendly in that it can turn your exception into a PSGI response with just a method call.

       All that said HTTP::Exception is a wonderful module and if that better suits your needs, then by all
       means, use it.

   <b>Note</b> <b>about</b> <b>Stack</b> <b>Traces</b>
       It should be noted that even though these are all exception objects, only the 500 Internal Server Error
       error actually includes the stack trace (albeit optionally). This is because more often then not you will
       not actually care about the stack trace and therefore do not the extra overhead. If you do find you want
       a stack trace though, it is as simple as adding the StackTrace::Auto role to your exceptions.

</pre><h4><b>PERL</b> <b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This library should run on perls released even a long time ago.  It should work on any version of perl
       released in the last five years.

       Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made that the minimum required version
       will not be increased.  The version may be increased for any reason, and there is no promise that patches
       will be accepted to lower the minimum required perl.

</pre><h4><b>ATTRIBUTES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>status_code</b>
       This is the status code integer as specified in the HTTP spec.

   <b>reason</b>
       This is the reason phrase as specified in the HTTP spec.

   <b>message</b>
       This is an additional message string that can be supplied, which <u>may</u> be used when stringifying or
       building an HTTP response.

   <b>additional_headers</b>
       This is an arrayref of pairs that will be added to the headers of the exception when converted to a HTTP
       message.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>status_line</b>
       This returns a string that would be used as a status line in a response, like "404 Not Found".

   <b>as_string</b>
       This returns a string representation of the exception.  This method <b>must</b> be implemented by any class
       consuming this role.

   <b>as_psgi</b>
       This returns a representation of the exception object as PSGI response.

       In theory, it accepts a PSGI environment as its only argument, but currently the environment is ignored.

   <b>to_app</b>
       This is the standard Plack convention for Plack::Components.  It will return a CODE ref which expects the
       $env parameter and returns the results of "as_psgi".

   <b>&amp;{}</b>
       We overload "&amp;{}" to call "to_app", again in keeping with the Plack::Component convention.

</pre><h4><b>WELL-KNOWN</b> <b>TYPES</b></h4><pre>
       Below is a list of the well-known types recognized by the factory and shipped with this distribution. The
       obvious 4xx and 5xx errors are included but we also include the 3xx redirection status codes. This is
       because, while not really an error, the 3xx status codes do represent an exceptional control flow.

       The implementation for each of these is in a role with a name in the form
       "HTTP::Throwable::Role::Status::STATUS-NAME".  For example, "Gone" is
       "HTTP::Throwable::Role::Status::Gone".  When throwing the exception with the factory, just pass "Gone"

   <b>Redirection</b> <b>3xx</b>
       This class of status code indicates that further action needs to be taken by the user agent in order to
       fulfill the request. The action required MAY be carried out by the user agent without interaction with
       the user if and only if the method used in the second request is GET or HEAD.

       300 HTTP::Throwable::Role::Status::MultipleChoices
       301 HTTP::Throwable::Role::Status::MovedPermanently
       302 HTTP::Throwable::Role::Status::Found
       303 HTTP::Throwable::Role::Status::SeeOther
       304 HTTP::Throwable::Role::Status::NotModified
       305 HTTP::Throwable::Role::Status::UseProxy
       307 HTTP::Throwable::Role::Status::TemporaryRedirect

   <b>Client</b> <b>Error</b> <b>4xx</b>
       The  4xx  class of status code is intended for cases in which the client seems to have erred. Except when
       responding to a HEAD request, the server SHOULD include an entity containing an explanation of the  error
       situation, and whether it is a temporary or permanent condition. These status codes are applicable to any
       request method. User agents SHOULD display any included entity to the user.

       400 HTTP::Throwable::Role::Status::BadRequest
       401 HTTP::Throwable::Role::Status::Unauthorized
       403 HTTP::Throwable::Role::Status::Forbidden
       404 HTTP::Throwable::Role::Status::NotFound
       405 HTTP::Throwable::Role::Status::MethodNotAllowed
       406 HTTP::Throwable::Role::Status::NotAcceptable
       407 HTTP::Throwable::Role::Status::ProxyAuthenticationRequired
       408 HTTP::Throwable::Role::Status::RequestTimeout
       409 HTTP::Throwable::Role::Status::Conflict
       410 HTTP::Throwable::Role::Status::Gone
       411 HTTP::Throwable::Role::Status::LengthRequired
       412 HTTP::Throwable::Role::Status::PreconditionFailed
       413 HTTP::Throwable::Role::Status::RequestEntityTooLarge
       414 HTTP::Throwable::Role::Status::RequestURITooLong
       415 HTTP::Throwable::Role::Status::UnsupportedMediaType
       416 HTTP::Throwable::Role::Status::RequestedRangeNotSatisfiable
       417 HTTP::Throwable::Role::Status::ExpectationFailed

   <b>Server</b> <b>Error</b> <b>5xx</b>
       Response  status  codes  beginning with the digit "5" indicate cases in which the server is aware that it
       has erred or is incapable of performing the request. Except when responding to a HEAD request, the server
       SHOULD include an entity containing an explanation of the error situation, and whether it is a  temporary
       or  permanent condition. User agents SHOULD display any included entity to the user. These response codes
       are applicable to any request method.

       500 HTTP::Throwable::Role::Status::InternalServerError
       501 HTTP::Throwable::Role::Status::NotImplemented
       502 HTTP::Throwable::Role::Status::BadGateway
       503 HTTP::Throwable::Role::Status::ServiceUnavailable
       504 HTTP::Throwable::Role::Status::GatewayTimeout
       505 HTTP::Throwable::Role::Status::HTTPVersionNotSupported

</pre><h4><b>COMPOSING</b> <b>WITH</b> <b>HTTP::THROWABLE</b></h4><pre>
       In general, we expect that you'll use HTTP::Throwable::Factory or a subclass to  throw  exceptions.   You
       can still use HTTP::Throwable directly, though, if you keep these things in mind:

       HTTP::Throwable  is mostly concerned about providing basic headers and a PSGI representation.  It doesn't
       worry about the body or a stringification.  You <b>must</b> provide the methods "body"  and  "body_headers"  and
       "as_string".

       The  "body"  method returns the string (of octets) to be sent as the HTTP entity.  That body is passed to
       the "body_headers" method, which must return an arrayref of headers to add to the response.   These  will
       generally include the Content-Type and Content-Length headers.

       The "as_string" method should return a printable string, even if the body is going to be empty.

       For  convenience,  these  three  methods are implemented by the roles HTTP::Throwable::Role::TextBody and
       HTTP::Throwable::Role::NoBody.
