</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       DANDR - Draws an isosurface when used in conjunction with entry INIT3D.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       CALL DANDR (NV,NW,ST1,LX,NX,NY,IS2,IU,S,IOBJS,MV)

</pre><h4><b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       This routine is part of the obsolete Isosrfhr utility.  Isosrfhr has been replaced by the Isosurface
       utility.  To see the Isosurface utility overview man page, type "man isosurface".

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       NV          (an input expression of type INTEGER) defines the range to be used for the V dimension of the
                   3-D UVW grid.

       NW          (an input expression of type INTEGER) defines the range to be used for the W dimension of the
                   3-D UVW grid.

       ST1         (an input array of type REAL) used as scratch work space.  It must be dimensioned at least of
                   size NV*NW*2 words.

       LX          (an  input array of type INTEGER) which is the first dimension of array IS2.  It must be of a
                   length to hold NX bits.  On a 64 bit machine it would be LX=(NX-1)/64+1.

       NX          (an input expression of type INTEGER) defines the range of cells in the X-direction of the XY
                   pixel model of the image plane.  A silhouette of the parts of the picture processed so far is
                   stored in this model.  Lines  to  be  drawn  are  tested  for  visibility  by  examining  the
                   silhouette.   Lines  in  the silhouette are hidden.  Lines out of the silhouette are visible.
                   The solution is approximate because the silhouette is not formed exactly.  See IS2.

       NY          (an input expression of type INTEGER) defines the range of cells in the Y-direction of the XY
                   pixel model of the image plane.  NY is also the second dimension of array IS2.

       IS2         (an input array of type INTEGER) which holds the XY pixel model of the image  plane.   It  is
                   dimensioned  LX  by  NY.  The pixel model contains NX by NY elements.  The sizes of NX and NY
                   vary with the choice of options.  For example, if hidden lines are drawn, NX and NY (and  LX)
                   can be smaller than when hidden lines are not drawn.  If some visible lines are not drawn, NX
                   and NY (and LX) must be made larger.  As a guide, some examples which have been adequate are:

                       NU  NV  NW            NX  NY
                   --------------------------------
                      100 100  60           200 200
                       60  60  60           110 110
                       40  40  40            75  75

       IU          (an  input  expression  of  type  INTEGER)  defines the unit number of a scratch file for the
                   package.  ST1 will be written NU times on this file.

       S           (an input array of type REAL, dimensioned 4) contains the world coordinates of the area where
                   the picture is to be drawn.  That is, all plotting coordinates generated will be  bounded  as
                   follows:  X coordinates will be between <a href="../man1/S.1.html">S</a>(1) and <a href="../man2/S.2.html">S</a>(2), Y coordinates will be between <a href="../man3/S.3.html">S</a>(3) and
                   <a href="../man4/S.4.html">S</a>(4).  To prevent distortion, have <a href="../man2/S.2.html">S</a>(2)-<a href="../man1/S.1.html">S</a>(1) = <a href="../man4/S.4.html">S</a>(4)-<a href="../man3/S.3.html">S</a>(3).

                   All coordinates should be in a range between 10.  and 1010.

       IOBJS       (an  input array of type INTEGER) which describes the objects to be drawn in VW space.  It is
                   of size NV by NW.  The actual first dimension of IOBJS in the calling program is MV.

                   Entry DANDR is called NU times to process any  object  contours  in  the  VW  cross  sections
                   defined  by  IOBJS.   Slabs  are  processed  from back to front such that on the I-th call to
                   DANDR, the slab at U = NU+1-I is processed.  IOBJS(J,K) = 1 if any object contains the  point
                   (NU+1-I,J,K) and IOBJS(J,K) = 0 otherwise.

       MV          (an  input  expression of type INTEGER) defines the actual first dimension of the array IOBJS
                   in the calling program.  When plotting all of IOBJS, NV = MV.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       Entries DANDR and DANDR must be used in tandem to create a plot.  First call entry DANDR to create a  set
       of 2-D perspective planes which are output to a scratch file.  Then, in the calling program you must loop
       over the U dimension of UVW space starting at the last slab, NU, and moving forward to slab 1.  Initially
       set  all  elements  of IOBJS to zeros.  Then, at all locations (J,K) where the surface of an object would
       appear, set IOBJS(J,K) = 1.  When IOBJS(J,K) has been defined for that VW slab (U = NU - I + 1), call the
       entry DANDR, which draws any object contours based on the 2-D perspective defined for that slab.

       An Isosrfhr example of the logical structure of a program follows:

        C  Entry DANDR writes NU 2-D perspective planes, ST1(NV,NW,2),
        C   of the UVW grid, viewed from the position EYE, to a scratch file.
        C
             CALL DANDR(EYE,NU,NV,NW,ST1,LX,NY,IS2,IU,S)
        C
        C NU is the extent of the U dimension.
        C
             DO 1 IBKWDS = 1,NU
             I = NU+1-IBKWDS
        C
        C You must define the presence of the objects at each VW grid point for
        C all slabs in the U direction. Ones are used to indicate the presence
        C of an object.  Zeros indicate no object.
        C
        C      IF (OBJ.EQ.YES) IOBJS(J,K) = 1
        C      IF (OBJ.EQ.NO)  IOBJS(J,K) = 0
        C
        C  DANDR reads ST1(NV,NW,2) for slab I.
        C
           1 CALL DANDR(NV,NW,ST1,LX,NX,NY,IS2,IU,S,IOBJS,MV)
