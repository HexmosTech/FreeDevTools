</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       STINIT - Performs initialization tasks required before STREAM may be called to create a streamline field
       flow plot.  Information about the input data arrays is copied into internal common block variables and
       the coordinate system mappings and boundaries are established.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       CALL STINIT (U,LU,V,LV,P,LP,M,N,WRK,LW)

</pre><h4><b>C-BINDING</b> <b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;ncarg/ncargC.h&gt;

       void c_stinit(float *u, int lu, float *v, int lv,
                     float *p, int lp, int m, int n,
                     float *wrk, int lw)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       U           (REAL 2-dimensional array, dimensioned LU x n: n &gt;= N, input): By default, assumed to contain
                   the first dimensional Cartesian components of the vector field.  However, if PLR is non-zero,
                   it is treated as containing the vector magnitudes.

       LU          (INTEGER, input): Actual value of the first dimension of array U.

       V           (REAL 2-dimensional array, dimensioned LV x n: n &gt;= N, input): By default, assumed to contain
                   the  second  dimensional  Cartesian  components of the vector field.  However, if PLR is non-
                   zero, it is treated as containing the vector angles.

       LV          (INTEGER, input): Actual value of the first dimension of array V.

       P           (REAL, input, DUMMY): This argument is currently ignored and may be assigned a dummy value.

       LP          (INTEGER, input, DUMMY): The first dimension of array P. Not currently  used,  this  argument
                   should be assigned the integer value 0.

       M           (INTEGER,  input):  Number of contiguous elements along the first dimensional axis containing
                   data to be processed in each of the arrays, U and V.

       N           (INTEGER, input): Number of contiguous elements along the second dimensional axis  containing
                   data to be processed in each of the arrays, U and V.

       WRK         (REAL,  array  dimensioned  n:  n  &gt;=  LW, input/output): Work array used to store normalized
                   values of the U and V vector components while the streamlines are calculated. It  also  holds
                   bit flags indicating whether a grid location is eligible for starting a streamline or placing
                   a directional arrowhead.

       LW          (INTEGER,  input):  Assumed  size  of  the  array WRK.  Currently it must greater or equal to
                   2*M*N.

</pre><h4><b>C-BINDING</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The C-binding argument descriptions are the same as the FORTRAN argument descriptions, with the following
       exceptions:

       lu          The second dimension of u in the calling program.

       lv          The second dimension of v in the calling program.

       lp          The second dimension of p in the calling program.

       m           Number of contiguous elements along the second dimension containing data to be  processed  in
                   each of the arrays, u and v.

       n           Number  of  contiguous  elements along the first dimension containing data to be processed in
                   each of the arrays, u and v.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       Call STINIT before the first invocation of STREAM, and again anytime you modify the contents of the input
       data arrays. You may precede an STINIT call with any number of calls to the parameter  setting  routines,
       STSETR  and  STSETI. Although it is possible to call STSETI or STSETR between calls to STINIT and STREAM,
       changing the setting of many of Streamline's parameters at this point will result in incorrect  behavior.
       When  in  doubt,  set  parameters  before  the  STINIT call; see the streamlines_params man page for more
       information.

       Set up the two vector component arrays prior to calling STINIT.  To permit multiple purpose  use  of  the
       array  space,  the  STINIT  argument list includes both the actual size and an assumed size for the first
       dimension of each input array. Due to FORTRAN array ordering conventions, only the assumed size needs  to
       be  specified  for  the  second  dimension.   (Note:  when  using  the  C bindings, mentally exchange all
       references to first and second dimensions in this discussion.) The arguments LU and LV contain the actual
       size of the first dimensions of U and V, respectively. Since the grid locations  for  each  of  the  data
       arrays  are assumed to coincide, a single argument, M, represents the assumed size of the first dimension
       for both arrays. Similarly, the argument, N, is the assumed  size  of  the  second  dimension.  The  only
       requirement for the actual second dimension size is that it be greater than or equal to N for each array.

       The  P  and  LP  arguments  are  intended for future enhancement of the Streamlines utility. They are not
       currently used or examined in any way. For maximum assurance of compatibility with future changes to  the
       code, give the LP argument the INTEGER value 0.

       WRK  is  an  array used to store normalized values of the U and V vector components while the streamlines
       are calculated. It also holds bit flags indicating whether a grid location is  eligible  for  starting  a
       streamline  or placing a directional arrowhead. Its assumed size is specified by the argument LW. LW must
       have a value greater or equal to 2*M*N.

</pre><h4><b>ACCESS</b></h4><pre>
       To  use STINIT or c_stinit, load the NCAR Graphics libraries ncarg, ncarg_gks, and ncarg_c, preferably in
       that order.

       messages.
