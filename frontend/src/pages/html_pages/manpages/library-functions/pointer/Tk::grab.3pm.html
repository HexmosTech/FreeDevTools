       Tk::grab - Confine pointer and keyboard events to a window sub-tree

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>grab</b>

       <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>grab</b><u>Option</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This set of methods implement simple pointer and keyboard grabs for Tk.  Tk's grabs are different than
       the grabs described in the Xlib documentation.  When a grab is set for a particular window, Tk restricts
       all pointer events to the grab window and its descendants in Tk's window hierarchy.  Whenever the pointer
       is within the grab window's subtree, the pointer will behave exactly the same as if there had been no
       grab at all and all events will be reported in the normal fashion.  When the pointer is outside <u>$widget</u>'s
       tree, button presses and releases and mouse motion events are reported to <u>$widget</u>, and window entry and
       window exit events are ignored.  The grab subtree ``owns'' the pointer: windows outside the grab subtree
       will be visible on the screen but they will be insensitive until the grab is released.  The tree of
       windows underneath the grab window can include top-level windows, in which case all of those top-level
       windows and their descendants will continue to receive mouse events during the grab.

       Two forms of grabs are possible:  local and global.  A local grab affects only the grabbing application:
       events will be reported to other applications as if the grab had never occurred.  Grabs are local by
       default.  A global grab locks out all applications on the screen, so that only the given subtree of the
       grabbing application will be sensitive to pointer events (mouse button presses, mouse button releases,
       pointer motions, window entries, and window exits).  During global grabs the window manager will not
       receive pointer events either.

       During local grabs, keyboard events (key presses and key releases) are delivered as usual:  the window
       manager controls which application receives keyboard events, and if they are sent to any window in the
       grabbing application then they are redirected to the focus window.  During a global grab Tk grabs the
       keyboard so that all keyboard events are always sent to the grabbing application.  The <b>focus</b> method is
       still used to determine which window in the application receives the keyboard events.  The keyboard grab
       is released when the grab is released.

       Grabs apply to particular displays.  If an application has windows on multiple displays then it can
       establish a separate grab on each display.  The grab on a particular display affects only the windows on
       that display.  It is possible for different applications on a single display to have simultaneous local
       grabs, but only one application can have a global grab on a given display at once.

       The <b>grab</b> methods take any of the following forms:

       <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>grabCurrent</b>
           Returns  the  current  grab  window  in this application for <u>$widget</u>'s display, or an empty string if
           there is no such window.

       <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>grabs</b>
           Returns a list whose elements are all of the windows grabbed by this application for all displays, or
           an empty string if the application has no grabs.

           <u>Not</u> <u>implemented</u> <u>yet!</u>

       <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>grabRelease</b>
           Releases the grab on <u>$widget</u> if there is one, otherwise does nothing.  Returns an empty string.

       <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>grab</b>
           Sets a local grab on <u>$widget</u>.  If a grab was already in effect  for  this  application  on  <u>$widget</u>'s
           display  then  it  is  automatically released.  If there is already a local grab on <u>$widget</u>, then the
           command does nothing.  Returns an empty string.

       <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>grabGlobal</b>
           Sets a global grab on <u>$widget</u>.  If a grab was already in effect for  this  application  on  <u>$widget</u>'s
           display  then  it  is automatically released.  If there is already a global grab on <u>$widget</u>, then the
           command does nothing.  Returns an empty string.

       <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>grabStatus</b>
           Returns <b>none</b> if no grab is currently set on <u>$widget</u>, <b>local</b> if a local grab is  set  on  <u>$widget</u>,  and
           <b>global</b> if a global grab is set.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       It took an incredibly complex and gross implementation to produce the simple grab effect described above.
       Given  the  current implementation, it isn't safe for applications to use the Xlib grab facilities at all
       except through the Tk grab procedures.  If applications try to manipulate X's grab  mechanisms  directly,
       things will probably break.

       If  a  single  process  is managing several different Tk applications, only one of those applications can
       have a local grab for a given display at any given time.  If the applications are in different processes,
       this restriction doesn't exist.
