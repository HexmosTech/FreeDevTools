       XGrabButton, XUngrabButton - grab pointer buttons

</pre><h4><b>SYNTAX</b></h4><pre>

       int  XGrabButton(Display  *<u>display</u>, unsigned int <u>button</u>, unsigned int <u>modifiers</u>, Window <u>grab_window</u>, Bool
              <u>owner_events</u>, unsigned int <u>event_mask</u>, int <u>pointer_mode</u>, <u>keyboard_mode</u>, Window <u>confine_to</u>,  Cursor
              <u>cursor</u>);

       int XUngrabButton(Display *<u>display</u>, unsigned int <u>button</u>, unsigned int <u>modifiers</u>, Window <u>grab_window</u>);

</pre><h4><b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>button</u>    Specifies the pointer button that is to be grabbed or released or <b>AnyButton</b>.

       <u>confine_to</u>
                 Specifies the window to confine the pointer in or <b>None</b>.

       <u>cursor</u>    Specifies the cursor that is to be displayed or <b>None</b>.

       <u>display</u>   Specifies the connection to the X server.

       <u>event_mask</u>
                 Specifies  which  pointer events are reported to the client.  The mask is the bitwise inclusive
                 OR of the valid pointer event mask bits.

       <u>grab_window</u>
                 Specifies the grab window.

       <u>keyboard_mode</u>
                 Specifies further processing of keyboard events.  You can pass <b>GrabModeSync</b> or <b>GrabModeAsync</b>.

       <u>modifiers</u> Specifies the set of keymasks or <b>AnyModifier</b>.  The mask is the  bitwise  inclusive  OR  of  the
                 valid keymask bits.

       <u>owner_events</u>
                 Specifies a Boolean value that indicates whether the pointer events are to be reported as usual
                 or reported with respect to the grab window if selected by the event mask.

       <u>pointer_mode</u>
                 Specifies further processing of pointer events.  You can pass <b>GrabModeSync</b> or <b>GrabModeAsync</b>.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>XGrabButton</b> function establishes a passive grab.  In the future, the pointer is actively grabbed (as
       for <b>XGrabPointer</b>), the last-pointer-grab time is set to the time at which  the  button  was  pressed  (as
       transmitted  in  the  <b>ButtonPress</b>  event),  and the <b>ButtonPress</b> event is reported if all of the following
       conditions are true:

       •    The pointer is not grabbed, and the  specified  button  is  logically  pressed  when  the  specified
            modifier keys are logically down, and no other buttons or modifier keys are logically down.

       •    The grab_window contains the pointer.

       •    The confine_to window (if any) is viewable.

       •    A passive grab on the same button/key combination does not exist on any ancestor of grab_window.

       The  interpretation  of  the  remaining  arguments is as for <b>XGrabPointer</b>.  The active grab is terminated
       automatically when the logical state of the pointer has all buttons released (independent of the state of
       the logical modifier keys), at which point a <b>ButtonRelease</b> event is reported to the grabbing window.

       Note that the logical state of a device (as seen by client applications) may lag the  physical  state  if
       device event processing is frozen.

       This  request  overrides all previous grabs by the same client on the same button/key combinations on the
       same window.  A modifiers of <b>AnyModifier</b> is equivalent to issuing  the  grab  request  for  all  possible
       modifier combinations (including the combination of no modifiers).  It is not required that all modifiers
       specified  have  currently assigned KeyCodes.  A button of <b>AnyButton</b> is equivalent to issuing the request
       for all possible buttons.  Otherwise, it is not required that the specified button currently be  assigned
       to a physical button.

       If  some  other  client has already issued a <b>XGrabButton</b> with the same button/key combination on the same
       window, a <b>BadAccess</b> error results.  When using <b>AnyModifier</b> or <b>AnyButton</b>, the  request  fails  completely,
       and  a  <b>BadAccess</b>  error  results  (no  grabs  are  established)  if  there is a conflicting grab for any
       combination.  <b>XGrabButton</b> has no effect on an active grab.

       <b>XGrabButton</b> can generate <b>BadCursor</b>, <b>BadValue</b>, and <b>BadWindow</b> errors.

       The <b>XUngrabButton</b> function releases the passive button/key combination on the specified window if it  was
       grabbed  by  this client.  A modifiers of <b>AnyModifier</b> is equivalent to issuing the ungrab request for all
       possible modifier combinations, including the combination of no modifiers.   A  button  of  <b>AnyButton</b>  is
       equivalent  to  issuing  the  request for all possible buttons.  <b>XUngrabButton</b> has no effect on an active
       grab.

       <b>XUngrabButton</b> can generate <b>BadValue</b> and <b>BadWindow</b> errors.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>BadCursor</b> A value for a Cursor argument does not name a defined Cursor.

       <b>BadValue</b>  Some numeric value falls outside the range  of  values  accepted  by  the  request.   Unless  a
                 specific  range  is specified for an argument, the full range defined by the argument's type is
                 accepted.  Any argument defined as a set of alternatives can generate this error.

       <b>BadWindow</b> A value for a Window argument does not name a defined Window.
