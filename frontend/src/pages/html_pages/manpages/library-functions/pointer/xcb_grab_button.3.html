</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;xcb/xproto.h&gt;</b>

   <b>Request</b> <b>function</b>

       xcb_void_cookie_t <b>xcb_grab_button</b>(xcb_connection_t *<u>conn</u>, uint8_t <u>owner_events</u>, xcb_window_t <u>grab_window</u>,
              uint16_t <u>event_mask</u>, uint8_t <u>pointer_mode</u>, uint8_t <u>keyboard_mode</u>, xcb_window_t <u>confine_to</u>,
              xcb_cursor_t <u>cursor</u>, uint8_t <u>button</u>, uint16_t <u>modifiers</u>);

</pre><h4><b>REQUEST</b> <b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>conn</u>      The XCB connection to X11.

       <u>owner_events</u>
                 If  1,  the <u>grab_window</u> will still get the pointer events. If 0, events are not reported to the
                 <u>grab_window</u>.

       <u>grab_window</u>
                 Specifies the window on which the pointer should be grabbed.

       <u>event_mask</u>
                 Specifies which pointer events are reported to the client.

                 TODO: which values?

       <u>pointer_mode</u>
                 One of the following values:

                 <u>XCB_GRAB_MODE_SYNC</u>
                           The state of the keyboard appears to freeze: No further keyboard events are generated
                           by the server until the grabbing client issues a releasing <u>AllowEvents</u> request or un‐
                           til the keyboard grab is released.

                 <u>XCB_GRAB_MODE_ASYNC</u>
                           Keyboard event processing continues normally.

       <u>keyboard_mode</u>
                 One of the following values:

                 <u>XCB_GRAB_MODE_SYNC</u>
                           The state of the keyboard appears to freeze: No further keyboard events are generated
                           by the server until the grabbing client issues a releasing <u>AllowEvents</u> request or un‐
                           til the keyboard grab is released.

                 <u>XCB_GRAB_MODE_ASYNC</u>
                           Keyboard event processing continues normally.

       <u>confine_to</u>
                 Specifies the window to confine the pointer in (the user will not be able to move  the  pointer
                 out of that window).

                 The special value <u>XCB_NONE</u> means don't confine the pointer.

       <u>cursor</u>    Specifies the cursor that should be displayed or <u>XCB_NONE</u> to not change the cursor.

       <u>button</u>    One of the following values:

                 <u>XCB_BUTTON_INDEX_ANY</u>
                           Any of the following (or none):

                 <u>XCB_BUTTON_INDEX_1</u>
                           The left mouse button.

                 <u>XCB_BUTTON_INDEX_2</u>
                           The right mouse button.

                 <u>XCB_BUTTON_INDEX_3</u>
                           The middle mouse button.

                 <u>XCB_BUTTON_INDEX_4</u>
                           Scroll wheel. TODO: direction?

                 <u>XCB_BUTTON_INDEX_5</u>
                           Scroll wheel. TODO: direction?

       <u>modifiers</u> The modifiers to grab.

                 Using the special value <u>XCB_MOD_MASK_ANY</u> means grab the pointer with all possible modifier com‐
                 binations.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This request establishes a passive grab. The pointer is actively grabbed as described in GrabPointer, the
       last-pointer-grab  time is set to the time at which the button was pressed (as transmitted in the Button‐
       Press event), and the ButtonPress event is reported if all of the following conditions are true:

       The pointer is not grabbed and the specified button is logically pressed when the specified modifier keys
       are logically down, and no other buttons or modifier keys are logically down.

       The grab-window contains the pointer.

       The confine-to window (if any) is viewable.

       A passive grab on the same button/key combination does not exist on any ancestor of grab-window.

       The interpretation of the remaining arguments is the same as for GrabPointer.  The active grab is  termi‐
       nated  automatically  when  the logical state of the pointer has all buttons released, independent of the
       logical state of modifier keys. Note that the logical state of a device (as seen by means of  the  proto‐
       col) may lag the physical state if device event processing is frozen. This request overrides all previous
       passive  grabs  by  the same client on the same button/key combinations on the same window. A modifier of
       AnyModifier is equivalent to issuing the request for all possible modifier  combinations  (including  the
       combination  of  no  modifiers).  It is not required that all specified modifiers have currently assigned
       keycodes. A button of AnyButton is equivalent to issuing the request for all possible buttons. Otherwise,
       it is not required that the button specified currently be assigned to a physical button.

       An Access error is generated if some other client has already issued a GrabButton request with  the  same
       button/key  combination  on the same window.  When using AnyModifier or AnyButton, the request fails com‐
       pletely (no grabs are established), and an Access error is generated if there is a conflicting  grab  for
       any combination. The request has no effect on an active grab.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       Returns an <u>xcb_void_cookie_t</u>. Errors (if any) have to be handled in the event loop.

       If  you  want  to handle errors directly with <u>xcb_request_check</u> instead, use <u>xcb_grab_button_checked</u>. See
       <b><a href="../man3/xcb-requests.3.html">xcb-requests</a>(3)</b> for details.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>xcb_access_error_t</u>
                 Another client has already issued a GrabButton with the same button/key combination on the same
                 window.

       <u>xcb_cursor_error_t</u>
                 The specified <u>cursor</u> does not exist.

       <u>xcb_value_error_t</u>
                 TODO: reasons?

       <u>xcb_window_error_t</u>
                 The specified <u>window</u> does not exist.
