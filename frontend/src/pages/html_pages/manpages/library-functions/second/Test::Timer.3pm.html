</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Test::Timer - test module to test/assert response times

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       The documentation describes version 2.12 of Test::Timer

</pre><h4><b>FEATURES</b></h4><pre>
       •   Test subroutines to implement unit-tests to time that your code executes before a specified threshold

       •   Test  subroutines  to  implement  unit-tests  to  time  that  your code execution exceeds a specified
           threshold

       •   Test subroutine to implement unit-tests to time that your code executes within a specified time frame

       •   Supports measurements in seconds

       •   Implements configurable alarm signal handler to make sure that your tests do not execute forever

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Test::Timer;

           time_ok( sub { doYourStuffButBeQuickAboutIt(); }, 1, 'threshold of one second');

           time_atmost( sub { doYourStuffYouHave10Seconds(); }, 10, 'threshold of 10 seconds');

           time_between( sub { doYourStuffYouHave5-10Seconds(); }, 5, 10,
               'lower threshold of 5 seconds and upper threshold of 10 seconds');

           # Will succeed
           time_nok( sub { <a href="../man2/sleep.2.html">sleep</a>(2); }, 1, 'threshold of one second');

           time_atleast( sub { <a href="../man2/sleep.2.html">sleep</a>(2); }, 2, 'threshold of one second');

           # Will fail after 5 (threshold) + 2 seconds (default alarm)
           time_ok( sub { <a href="../man1/while.1.html">while</a>(1) { <a href="../man1/sleep.1.html">sleep</a>(1); } }, 5, 'threshold of one second');

           $test::Timer::alarm = 6 #default 2 seconds

           # Will fail after 5 (threshold) + 6 seconds (specified alarm)
           time_ok( sub { <a href="../man1/while.1.html">while</a>(1) { <a href="../man1/sleep.1.html">sleep</a>(1); } }, 5, 'threshold of one second');

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Test::Timer implements a set of test primitives to test and assert test times from bodies of code.

       The key features are subroutines to assert or test the following:

       •   that a given piece of code does not exceed a specified time limit

       •   that a given piece of code takes longer than a specified time limit and does not exceed another

</pre><h4><b>EXPORT</b></h4><pre>
       Test::Timer exports:

       •   time_ok

       •   time_nok

       •   time_atleast

       •   time_atmost

       •   time_between

</pre><h4><b>SUBROUTINES/METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>time_ok</b>
       Takes the following parameters:

       •   a reference to a block of code (anonymous sub)

       •   a threshold specified as a integer indicating a number of seconds

       •   a string specifying a test name

           time_nok( sub { <a href="../man2/sleep.2.html">sleep</a>(2); }, 1, 'threshold of one second');

       If the execution of the code exceeds the threshold specified the test fail with the following  diagnostic
       message

           Test ran 2 seconds and exceeded specified threshold of 1 seconds

   <b>time_nok</b>
       The is the inverted variant of time_ok, it passes if the threshold is exceeded and fails if the benchmark
       of the code is within the specified timing threshold.

       The API is the same as for time_ok.

           time_nok( sub { <a href="../man1/sleep.1.html">sleep</a>(1); }, 2, 'threshold of two seconds');

       If  the  execution  of  the  code executes below the threshold specified the test fail with the following
       diagnostic message

           Test ran 1 seconds and did not exceed specified threshold of 2 seconds

   <b>time_atmost</b>
       This is <u>syntactic</u> <u>sugar</u> for time_ok

           time_atmost( sub { doYourStuffButBeQuickAboutIt(); }, 1, 'threshold of one second');

       If the execution of the code exceeds the threshold specified the test fail with the following  diagnostic
       message

           Test ran N seconds and exceeded specified threshold of 1 seconds

       N will be the actual measured execution time of the specified code

   <b>time_atleast</b>
           time_atleast( sub { doYourStuffAndTakeYourTimeAboutIt(); }, 1, 'threshold of 1 second');

       The test succeeds if the code takes at least the number of seconds specified by the timing threshold.

       If the code executes faster, the test fails with the following diagnostic message

           Test ran 1 seconds and did not exceed specified threshold of 2 seconds

       Please  be  aware  that  Test::Timer,  breaks  the execution with an alarm specified to trigger after the
       specified threshold + 2 seconds (default), so if you expect your execution to run longer, set  the  alarm
       accordingly.

           $Test::Timer::alarm = $my_alarm_in_seconds;

       See also diagnostics.

   <b>time_between</b>
       This  method  is  a  more extensive variant of time_atmost and time_ok, you can specify a lower and upper
       threshold, the code has to execute within this interval in order for the test to succeed

           time_between( sub { <a href="../man2/sleep.2.html">sleep</a>(2); }, 5, 10,
               'lower threshold of 5 seconds and upper threshold of 10 seconds');

       If the code executes faster than the lower threshold or exceeds the upper threshold, the test fails  with
       the following diagnostic message

           Test ran 2 seconds and did not execute within specified interval 5 - 10 seconds

       Or

           Test ran 12 seconds and did not execute within specified interval 5 - 10 seconds

</pre><h4><b>PRIVATE</b> <b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>_runtest</b>
       This  is  a  method to handle the result from _benchmark is initiates the benchmark calling benchmark and
       based on whether it is within the provided interval true (1) is returned and if not false (0).

   <b>_benchmark</b>
       This is the method doing the actual benchmark, if a better method is located this is the place to do  the
       handy work.

       Currently  Benchmark  is  used.  An alternative could be Devel::Timer, but I do not know this module very
       well and Benchmark is core, so this is used for now.

       The method takes two parameters:

       •   a code block via a code reference

       •   a threshold (the upper threshold, since this is added to the default alarm

   <b>import</b>
       Test::Builder required import  to  do  some  import  <u>hokus-pokus</u>  for  the  test  methods  exported  from
       Test::Timer. Please refer to the documentation in Test::Builder

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       All tests either fail or succeed, but a few exceptions are implemented, these are listed below.

       •   Test  did  not  exceed  specified  threshold, this message is diagnosis for time_atleast and time_nok
           tests, which do not exceed their specified threshold

       •   Test exceeded specified threshold, this message is a diagnostic for time_atmost and time_ok,  if  the
           specified threshold is surpassed.

           This is the key point of the module, either your code is too slow and you should address this or your
           threshold is too low, in which case you can set it a bit higher and run the test again.

       •   Test  did  not execute within specified interval, this is the diagnostic from time_between, it is the
           diagnosis if the execution of the code is not between the specified lower and upper thresholds

       •   Insufficient parameters, this is the message if a specified test is not provided with the  sufficient
           number of parameters, consult this documentation and correct accordingly

       •   Execution  exceeded  threshold and timed out, the exception is thrown if the execution of tested code
           exceeds even the alarm, which is default 2 seconds, but can be set by the user or  is  equal  to  the
           upper threshold + 2 seconds

           The  exception  results  in a diagnostic for the failing test. This is a fail-safe to avoid that code
           runs forever. If you get this diagnose either your code is too slow and you should address this or it
           might be error prone. If this is not the case adjust the alarm setting to suit your situation.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>AND</b> <b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       This module requires no special configuration or environment.

       Tests are sensitive and be configured using environment and configuration files, please see  the  section
       on test and quality.

</pre><h4><b>DEPENDENCIES</b></h4><pre>
       •   Carp

       •   Benchmark

       •   Error

       •   Test::Builder

       •   Test::Builder::Module

</pre><h4><b>INCOMPATIBILITIES</b></h4><pre>
       This module holds no known incompatibilities.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       This module holds no known bugs.

       The  current  implementations  only  use  seconds  and  resolutions  should  be  higher,  so  the current
       implementation is limited to seconds as the highest resolution.

       On occasion failing tests with CPAN-testers have been observed. This seem to be related to the test-suite
       being not taking into account that some smoke-testers do not prioritize resources for the  test  run  and
       that  additional  processes/jobs  are  running. The test-suite have been adjusted to accommodate this but
       these issues might reoccur.
