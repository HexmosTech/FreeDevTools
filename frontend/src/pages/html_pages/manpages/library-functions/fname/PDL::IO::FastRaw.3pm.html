       PDL::IO::FastRaw -- A simple, fast and convenient io format for PerlDL.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        use PDL;
        use PDL::IO::FastRaw;

        writefraw($pdl,"fname");         # write a raw file

        $pdl2 = readfraw("fname");       # read a raw file
        $pdl2 = PDL-&gt;readfraw("fname");

        gluefraw($pdlx, "fname");        # append to existing file
        $pdlx-&gt;gluefraw("fname");

        $pdl3 = mapfraw("fname2",{ReadOnly =&gt; 1}); # mmap a file, don't read yet

        $pdl4 = maptextfraw("fname3",{...}); # map a text file into a 1-D pdl.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This is a very simple and fast io format for PerlDL.  The disk data consists of two files, a header
       metadata file in ASCII and a binary file consisting simply of consecutive bytes, shorts or whatever.

       It is hoped that this will not only make for a simple PerlDL module for saving and retrieving these files
       but also make it easy for other programs to use these files.

       The format of the ASCII header is simply

               &lt;typeid&gt;
               &lt;ndims&gt;
               &lt;dim0&gt; &lt;dim1&gt; ...

       You should probably stick with the default header name.  You may want to specify your own header,
       however, such as when you have a large collection of data files with identical dimensions and data types.
       Under these circumstances, simply specify the "Header" option in the options hash.

       The binary files are in general NOT interchangeable between different architectures since the binary file
       is simply dumped from the memory region of the ndarray.  This is what makes the approach efficient.

       It is also possible to mmap the file which can give a large speedup in certain situations as well as save
       a lot of memory by using a disk file as virtual memory. When a file is mapped, parts of it are read only
       as they are accessed in the memory (or as the kernel decides: if you are reading the pages in order, it
       may well preread some for you).

       Note that memory savings and copy-on-write are operating-system dependent - see Core.xs and your
       operating system documentation for exact semantics of whatever. Basically, if you write to a mmapped file
       without "ReadOnly", the change will be reflected in the file immediately. "ReadOnly" doesn't really make
       it impossible to write to the ndarray but maps the memory privately so the file will not be changed when
       you change the ndarray. Be aware though that mmapping a 40Mb file without "ReadOnly" spends no virtual
       memory but with "ReadOnly" it does reserve 40Mb.

   <b>Example:</b> <b>Converting</b> <b>ASCII</b> <b>to</b> <b>raw</b>
       You have a whole slew of data files in ASCII from an experiment that you ran in your lab.  You're still
       tweaking the analysis and plots, so you'd like if your data could load as fast as possible.  Eventually
       you'll read the data into your scripts using "readfraw", but the first thing you might do is create a
       script that converts all the data files to raw files:

        #!<a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?perl">/usr/bin/perl</a>
        # Assumes that the data files end with a .asc or .dat extension
        # and saves the raw file output with a .bdat extension.
        # call with
        #  &gt;./convert_to_raw.pl file1.dat file2.dat ...
        # or
        #  &gt;./convert_to_raw.pl *.dat

        use PDL;
        use PDL::IO::FastRaw;  # for saving raw files
        use PDL::IO::Misc;             # for reading ASCII files with rcols
        while(shift) {                 # run through the entire supplied list of file names
                ($newName = $_) =~ s/\.(asc|dat)/.bdat/;
                print "Saving contents of $_ to $newName\n";
                $data = rcols($_);
                writefraw($data, $newName);
        }

   <b>Example:</b> <b>readfraw</b>
       Now that you've gotten your data into a raw file format, you can start working on your analysis scripts.
       If you scripts used "rcols" in the past, the reading portion of the script should go much, much faster
       now:

        #!<a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?perl">/usr/bin/perl</a>
        # My plotting script.
        # Assume I've specified the files to plot on the command line like
        #  &gt;./plot_script.pl file1.bdat file2.bdat ...
        # or
        #  &gt;./plot_script.pl *.bdat

        use PDL;
        use PDL::IO::FastRaw;
        while(shift) {                 # run through the entire supplied list of file names
                $data = readfraw($_);
                my_plot_func($data);
        }

   <b>Example:</b> <b>Custom</b> <b>headers</b>
       In the first example, I allow "writefraw" to use the standard header file name, which would be
       "file.bdat.hdr".  However, I often measure time series that have identical length, so all of those header
       files are redundant.  To fix that, I simply pass the Header option to the "writefraw" command.  A
       modified script would look like this:

        #!<a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?perl">/usr/bin/perl</a>
        # Assumes that the data files end with a .asc or .dat extension
        # and saves the raw file output with a .bdat extension.
        # call with
        #  &gt;./convert_to_raw.pl [-hHeaderFile] &lt;fileglob&gt; [-hHeaderFile] &lt;fileglob&gt; ...

        use PDL;
        use PDL::IO::FastRaw;  # for saving raw files
        use PDL::IO::Misc;             # for reading ASCII files with rcols
        my $header_file = undef;
        CL_OPTION: while($_ = shift @ARGV) {   # run through the entire list of command-line options
                if(/-h(.*)/) {
                        $header_file = $1;
                        next CL_OPTION;
                }
                ($newName = $_) =~ s/\.(asc|dat)/.bdat/;
                print "Saving contents of $_ to $newName\n";
                $data = rcols($_);
                writefraw($data, $newName, {Header =&gt; $header_file});
        }

       Modifying the read script is left as an exercise for the reader.  :]

   <b>Example:</b> <b>Using</b> <b>mapfraw</b>
       Sometimes you'll want to use "mapfraw" rather than the read/write functions.  In fact, the original
       author of the module doesn't use the read/write functions anymore, prefering to always use "mapfraw".
       How would you go about doing this?

       Assuming you've already saved your data into the raw format, the only change you would have to make to
       the script in example 2 would be to change the call to "readfraw" to "mapfraw".  That's it.  You will
       probably see differences in performance, though I (David Mertens) couldn't tell you about them because I
       haven't played around with "mapfraw" much myself.

       What if you eschew the use of "writefraw" and prefer to only use "mapfraw"?  How would you save your data
       to a raw format?  In that case, you would have to create a "mapfraw" ndarray with the correct dimensions
       first using

        $ndarray_on_hd = mapfraw('fname', {Creat =&gt; 1, Dims =&gt; [dim1, dim2, ...]});

       Note that you must specify the dimensions and you must tell "mapfraw" to create the new ndarray for you
       by setting the "Creat" option to a true value, not "Create" (note the missing final 'e').

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>writefraw</b>
       Write a raw format binary file

        writefraw($pdl,"fname");
        writefraw($pdl,"fname", {Header =&gt; 'headerfname'});

       The "writefraw" command supports the following option:

       Header  Specify the header file name.

   <b>readfraw</b>
       Read a raw format binary file

        $pdl2 = readfraw("fname");
        $pdl2 = PDL-&gt;readfraw("fname");
        $pdl2 = readfraw("fname", {Header =&gt; 'headerfname'});

       The "readfraw" command supports the following option:

       Header  Specify the header file name.

   <b>gluefraw</b>
       Append a single data item to an existing binary file written by "writefraw". Error if dims not compatible
       with existing data.

         gluefraw($file, $pdl[, $opts]);

   <b>mapfraw</b>
       Memory map a raw format binary file (see the module docs also)

        $pdl3 = mapfraw("fname2",{ReadOnly =&gt; 1});

       The "mapfraw" command supports the following options (not all combinations make sense):

       Dims, Datatype
               If  creating a new file or if you want to specify your own header data for the file, you can give
               an array reference and a scalar, respectively.

       Creat   Create the file. Also writes out a header for the file.

       Trunc   Set the file size. Automatically enabled with "Creat". NOTE: This also clears  the  file  to  all
               zeroes.

       ReadOnly
               Disallow writing to the file.

       Header  Specify the header file name.

   <b>maptextfraw</b>
       Memory map a text file (see the module docs also).

       Note  that  this  function maps the raw format so if you are using an operating system which does strange
       things to e.g.  line delimiters upon reading a text file, you get the raw (binary) representation.

       The file doesn't really need to be text but it is just mapped as one large binary chunk.

       This function is just a convenience wrapper which firsts "stat"s the file and  sets  the  dimensions  and
       datatype.

        $pdl4 = maptextfraw("fname", {options}

       The options other than Dims, Datatype of "mapfraw" are supported.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Should  be  documented  better.  "writefraw" and "readfraw" should also have options (the author nowadays
       only uses "mapfraw" ;)
