</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Net::OpenID::VerifiedIdentity - Object representing a verified OpenID identity

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 1.18

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Net::OpenID::Consumer;
         my $csr = Net::OpenID::Consumer-&gt;new;
         ....
         my $vident = $csr-&gt;verified_identity
           or die $csr-&gt;err;

         my $url = $vident-&gt;url;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       After Net::OpenID::Consumer verifies a user's identity and does the signature checks, it gives you this
       Net::OpenID::VerifiedIdentity object, from which you can learn more about the user.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       $vident-&gt;<b>url</b>
           Returns the URL (as a scalar) that was verified.  (Remember, an OpenID is just a URL.)

       $vident-&gt;<b>display</b>
           Returns  the  a  short  "display  form"  of the verified URL using a couple brain-dead patterns.  For
           instance, the identity "<a href="http://www.foo.com/~bob/">http://www.foo.com/~bob/</a>" will map to "bob  [foo.com]"  The  www.  prefix  is
           removed,   as  well  as  http,  and  a  username  is  looked  for,  in  either  the  tilde  form,  or
           "/users/USERNAME" or "/members/USERNAME".  If the path component is  empty  or  just  "/",  then  the
           display form is just the hostname, so "<a href="http://myblog.com/">http://myblog.com/</a>" is just "myblog.com".

           Suggestions  for improving this function are welcome, but you'll probably get more satisfying results
           if you make use of the data returned by the Simple Registration (SREG) extension,  which  allows  the
           user to choose a preferred nickname to use on your site.

       $vident-&gt;<b>extension_fields</b>($ns_uri)
           Return  the  fields  from  the given extension namespace, if any, that were included in the assertion
           request. The fields are returned in a hashref.

           In most cases you'll probably want to use <b>signed_extension_fields</b> instead, to avoid attacks  where  a
           man-in-the-middle alters the extension fields in transit.

           Note that for OpenID 1.1 transactions only Simple Registration (SREG) 1.1 is supported.

       $vident-&gt;<b>signed_extension_fields</b>($ns_uri)
           The  same  as  <b>extension_fields</b> except that only fields that were signed as part of the assertion are
           included in the returned hashref. For example, if you included a Simple Registration request in  your
           initial message, you might fetch the results (if any) like this:

               $sreg = $vident-&gt;signed_extension_fields(
                   '<a href="http://openid.net/extensions/sreg/1.1">http://openid.net/extensions/sreg/1.1</a>',
               );

           An  important  gotcha  to  bear  in  mind is that for OpenID 2.0 responses no extension fields can be
           considered signed unless the corresponding extension namespace declaration is also signed. If that is
           not the case, this method will behave as if no extension fields for that URI were signed.

       $vident-&gt;<b>rss</b>
       $vident-&gt;<b>atom</b>
       $vident-&gt;<b>foaf</b>
       $vident-&gt;<b>declared_rss</b>
       $vident-&gt;<b>declared_atom</b>
       $vident-&gt;<b>declared_foaf</b>
           Returns the absolute URLs (as scalars) of the user's RSS, Atom, and FOAF XML documents that were also
           found in their HTML's &lt;head&gt; section.  The short versions will only return a URL if they're below the
           root URL that was verified.  If you want to get at the user's declared rss/atom/foaf, even if it's on
           a different host or parent directory, use the declared_* versions, which don't  have  the  additional
           checks.

           2005-05-24:   A  future  module will take a Net::OpenID::VerifiedIdentity object and create an OpenID
           profile object so you don't have to manually parse all those documents to get profile information.

       $vident-&gt;<b>foafmaker</b>
           Returns the value of the "foaf:maker" meta tag, if declared.
