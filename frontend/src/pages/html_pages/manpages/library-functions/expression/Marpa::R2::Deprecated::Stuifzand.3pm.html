</pre><h4><b>Overview</b></h4><pre>
       This page is the reference for the Marpa's "Stuifzand interface", also called its "BNF interface".  Use
       of the Stuifzand interface is now deprecated, in favor of the SLIF interface.  Almost all of the
       functionality of the Stuifzand interface can be duplicated in the SLIF interface by switching immediately
       to external scanning, and never switching back to internal scanning.  To switch immediately to external
       scanning in the SLIF, specify a length of zero for its initial read().  For more details, see the
       document for the SLIF itself.

</pre><h4><b>The</b> <b>source</b> <b>string</b></h4><pre>
       Stuifzand interface  source strings are specified using the the "source" named argument of Marpa::R2's
       grammars.  BNF source strings perform the functions of the "rules" and the "start" named arguments of
       Marpa grammars.  When the "source" named argument is used to specify a grammar, the "rules" and "start"
       named arguments should not be used, and vice versa.  The syntax for the Stuifzand interface's source
       string is the same as the syntax for the SLIF DSL, except that features and syntax not relevant to the
       Stuifzand interface are not supported.

       Everything related to L0 grammars is unsupported.  L0 grammars do not exist in the Stuifzand interface.
       Lexemes, character classes and quoted strings all implicitly require a L0 grammar to exist and therefore,
       they also are not supported.

       Since the Stuifzand interface does not implement internal scanning, everything to do with internal
       scanning is unsupported.  SLIF parse events are the most visible of these features.

       In most cases, when features have introduced after the SLIF replaced the Stuifzand interface as Marpa's
       primary interface, those features have been retro-ported if they make sense in the Stuifzand context.
       However, this will necessarily always be the case in the future.

       Here is a list of some of the unsupported SLIF DSL features,

       •   Character classes

           These implicitly use the L0 grammar.

       •   Quoted strings

           These implicitly use the L0 grammar.

       •   Discard rules

           ":discard" rules control the behavior of the L0 grammar.

       •   The lexeme and lexeme default statements

           The  ":lexeme"  pseudo-rule and the lexeme default statement define the behavior of lexemes.  Lexemes
           in the SLIF sense do not exist in the Stuifzand interface.

       •   L0 rules

           Rules with the tilde declarator (""~"") defined L0 rules.

       •   Event declarations

           Parse events exist to trigger returns from the SLIF internal scanning methods.

       •   The pause adverb

           The pause adverb exists to trigger returns from the SLIF internal scanning methods.

       •   The priority adverb

           The priority adverb defines lexeme priorities.  Lexemes in  the  SLIF  sense  do  not  exist  in  the
           Stuifzand interface.

       •   Actions specified as array descriptors

           Actions specified as array descriptors, for example,

               action =&gt; [start,length,value]

           exist  primarily  to  support  lexeme  semantics.   They  can  also specify rule semantics, but their
           functionality has not been retro-ported to the Stuifzand interface, and probably never will be.
