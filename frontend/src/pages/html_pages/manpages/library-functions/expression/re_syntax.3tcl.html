</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       re_syntax - Syntax of Tcl regular expressions
_________________________________________________________________

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       A  <u>regular</u>  <u>expression</u>  describes strings of characters.  It's a pattern that matches certain strings and
       does not match others.

</pre><h4><b>DIFFERENT</b> <b>FLAVORS</b> <b>OF</b> <b>REs</b></h4><pre>
       Regular expressions (“RE”s), as defined by POSIX, come in two flavors: <u>extended</u> REs  (“ERE”s)  and  <u>basic</u>
       REs  (“BRE”s).   EREs  are  roughly  those  of the traditional <u>egrep</u>, while BREs are roughly those of the
       traditional <u>ed</u>. This implementation adds a third flavor, <u>advanced</u> REs (“ARE”s), basically EREs with  some
       significant extensions.

       This  manual  page  primarily  describes  AREs.  BREs mostly exist for backward compatibility in some old
       programs; they will be discussed at the end. POSIX EREs are almost an exact subset of AREs.  Features  of
       AREs that are not present in EREs will be indicated.

</pre><h4><b>REGULAR</b> <b>EXPRESSION</b> <b>SYNTAX</b></h4><pre>
       Tcl  regular  expressions are implemented using the package written by Henry Spencer, based on the 1003.2
       spec and some (not quite all) of the Perl5 extensions  (thanks,  Henry!).  Much  of  the  description  of
       regular expressions below is copied verbatim from his manual entry.

       An ARE is one or more <u>branches</u>, separated by “<b>|</b>”, matching anything that matches any of the branches.

       A  branch  is  zero  or  more  <u>constraints</u> or <u>quantified</u> <u>atoms</u>, concatenated.  It matches a match for the
       first, followed by a match for the second, etc; an empty branch matches the empty string.

   <b>QUANTIFIERS</b>
       A quantified atom is an <u>atom</u> possibly followed by a single <u>quantifier</u>.  Without a quantifier, it  matches
       a single match for the atom.  The quantifiers, and what a so-quantified atom matches, are:

         <b>*</b>     a sequence of 0 or more matches of the atom

         <b>+</b>     a sequence of 1 or more matches of the atom

         <b>?</b>     a sequence of 0 or 1 matches of the atom

         <b>{</b><u>m</u><b>}</b>   a sequence of exactly <u>m</u> matches of the atom

         <b>{</b><u>m</u><b>,}</b>  a sequence of <u>m</u> or more matches of the atom

         <b>{</b><u>m</u><b>,</b><u>n</u><b>}</b> a sequence of <u>m</u> through <u>n</u> (inclusive) matches of the atom; <u>m</u> may not exceed <u>n</u>

         <b>*?</b>  <b>+?</b>  <b>??</b>  <b>{</b><u>m</u><b>}?</b>  <b>{</b><u>m</u><b>,}?</b>  <b>{</b><u>m</u><b>,</b><u>n</u><b>}?</b>
               <u>non-greedy</u> quantifiers, which match the same possibilities, but prefer the smallest number rather
               than the largest number of matches (see <b>MATCHING</b>)

       The  forms  using  <b>{</b>  and  <b>}</b>  are known as <u>bound</u>s. The numbers <u>m</u> and <u>n</u> are unsigned decimal integers with
       permissible values from 0 to 255 inclusive.

   <b>ATOMS</b>
       An atom is one of:

         <b>(</b><u>re</u><b>)</b>  matches a match for <u>re</u> (<u>re</u> is any regular expression) with the match noted for possible reporting

         <b>(?:</b><u>re</u><b>)</b>
               as previous, but does no reporting (a “non-capturing” set of parentheses)

         <b>()</b>    matches an empty string, noted for possible reporting

         <b>(?:)</b>  matches an empty string, without reporting

         <b>[</b><u>chars</u><b>]</b>
               a <u>bracket</u> <u>expression</u>, matching any one of the <u>chars</u> (see <b>BRACKET</b> <b>EXPRESSIONS</b> for more detail)

         <b>.</b>     matches any single character

         <b>\</b><u>k</u>    matches the non-alphanumeric character <u>k</u> taken as  an  ordinary  character,  e.g.  <b>\\</b>  matches  a
               backslash character

         <b>\</b><u>c</u>    where  <u>c</u>  is  alphanumeric  (possibly  followed  by other characters), an <u>escape</u> (AREs only), see
               <b>ESCAPES</b> below

         <b>{</b>     when followed by a character other than a digit,  matches  the  left-brace  character  “<b>{</b>”;  when
               followed by a digit, it is the beginning of a <u>bound</u> (see above)

         <u>x</u>     where <u>x</u> is a single character with no other significance, matches that character.

   <b>CONSTRAINTS</b>
       A  <u>constraint</u>  matches an empty string when specific conditions are met. A constraint may not be followed
       by a quantifier. The simple constraints are as follows; some more constraints are described later,  under
       <b>ESCAPES</b>.

         <b>^</b>       matches  at  the  beginning  of the string or a line (according to whether matching is newline-
                 sensitive or not, as described in <b>MATCHING</b>, below).

         <b>$</b>       matches at the end of the string or a line (according to whether matching is  newline-sensitive
                 or not, as described in <b>MATCHING</b>, below).

                 The  difference  between  string and line matching modes is immaterial when the string does not
                 contain a newline character.  The <b>\A</b> and <b>\Z</b> constraint escapes have a similar purpose  but  are
                 always constraints for the overall string.

                 The  default  newline-sensitivity  depends on the command that uses the regular expression, and
                 can be overridden as described in <b>METASYNTAX</b>, below.

         <b>(?=</b><u>re</u><b>)</b>  <u>positive</u> <u>lookahead</u> (AREs only), matches at any point where a substring matching <u>re</u> begins

         <b>(?!</b><u>re</u><b>)</b>  <u>negative</u> <u>lookahead</u> (AREs only), matches at any point where no substring matching <u>re</u> begins

       The lookahead constraints may not contain back references (see later), and all  parentheses  within  them
       are considered non-capturing.

       An RE may not end with “<b>\</b>”.

</pre><h4><b>BRACKET</b> <b>EXPRESSIONS</b></h4><pre>
       A  <u>bracket</u> <u>expression</u> is a list of characters enclosed in “<b>[]</b>”.  It normally matches any single character
       from the list (but see below). If the list begins with “<b>^</b>”, it matches  any  single  character  (but  see
       below) <u>not</u> from the rest of the list.

       If  two  characters  in the list are separated by “<b>-</b>”, this is shorthand for the full <u>range</u> of characters
       between those  two  (inclusive)  in  the  collating  sequence,  e.g.   “<b>[0-9]</b>”  in  Unicode  matches  any
       conventional  decimal digit. Two ranges may not share an endpoint, so e.g.  “<b>a-c-e</b>” is illegal. Ranges in
       Tcl always use the Unicode collating sequence, but other programs may use other collating  sequences  and
       this can be a source of incompatibility between programs.

       To  include  a literal <b>]</b> or <b>-</b> in the list, the simplest method is to enclose it in <b>[.</b> and <b>.]</b> to make it a
       collating element (see below). Alternatively, make it the first character (following a possible “<b>^</b>”),  or
       (AREs  only)  precede  it  with  “<b>\</b>”.   Alternatively, for “<b>-</b>”, make it the last character, or the second
       endpoint of a range. To use a literal <b>-</b> as the first endpoint of a range, make it a collating element  or
       (AREs  only)  precede  it  with  “<b>\</b>”.   With  the exception of these, some combinations using <b>[</b> (see next
       paragraphs), and escapes, all other special characters lose their special significance within  a  bracket
       expression.

   <b>CHARACTER</b> <b>CLASSES</b>
       Within  a  bracket expression, the name of a <u>character</u> <u>class</u> enclosed in <b>[:</b> and <b>:]</b> stands for the list of
       all characters (not all collating elements!) belonging to that class.  Standard character classes are:

       <b>alpha</b>   A letter.

       <b>upper</b>   An upper-case letter.

       <b>lower</b>   A lower-case letter.

       <b>digit</b>   A decimal digit.

       <b>xdigit</b>  A hexadecimal digit.

       <b>alnum</b>   An alphanumeric (letter or digit).

       <b>print</b>   A "printable" (same as graph, except also including space).

       <b>blank</b>   A space or tab character.

       <b>space</b>   A character producing white space in displayed text.

       <b>punct</b>   A punctuation character.

       <b>graph</b>   A character with a visible representation (includes both <b>alnum</b> and <b>punct</b>).

       <b>cntrl</b>   A control character.

       A locale may provide others. A character class may not be used as an endpoint of a range.

              (<u>Note:</u> the current Tcl implementation has only one locale,  the  Unicode  locale,  which  supports
              exactly the above classes.)

   <b>BRACKETED</b> <b>CONSTRAINTS</b>
       There  are  two special cases of bracket expressions: the bracket expressions “<b>[[:&lt;:]]</b>” and “<b>[[:&gt;:]]</b>” are
       constraints, matching empty strings at the beginning and end of a word respectively.  A word  is  defined
       as  a  sequence  of  word  characters  that  is  neither preceded nor followed by word characters. A word
       character is an  <u>alnum</u>  character  or  an  underscore  (“<b>_</b>”).   These  special  bracket  expressions  are
       deprecated; users of AREs should use constraint escapes instead (see below).

   <b>COLLATING</b> <b>ELEMENTS</b>
       Within  a  bracket expression, a collating element (a character, a multi-character sequence that collates
       as if it were a single character, or a collating-sequence name for either) enclosed in <b>[.</b> and  <b>.]</b>  stands
       for the sequence of characters of that collating element. The sequence is a single element of the bracket
       expression's  list. A bracket expression in a locale that has multi-character collating elements can thus
       match more than one character. So (insidiously), a bracket expression that starts with <b>^</b> can match multi-
       character collating elements even if none of them appear in the bracket expression!

              (<u>Note:</u> Tcl has no multi-character collating elements. This information is only for illustration.)

       For example, assume the collating sequence includes a <b>ch</b> multi-character collating element. Then  the  RE
       “<b>[[.ch.]]*c</b>”  (zero  or more “<b>ch</b>s” followed by “<b>c</b>”) matches the first five characters of “<b>chchcc</b>”.  Also,
       the RE “<b>[^c]b</b>” matches all of “<b>chb</b>” (because “<b>[^c]</b>” matches the multi-character “<b>ch</b>”).

   <b>EQUIVALENCE</b> <b>CLASSES</b>
       Within a bracket expression, a collating element enclosed in <b>[=</b> and <b>=]</b> is an equivalence class,  standing
       for  the  sequences of characters of all collating elements equivalent to that one, including itself. (If
       there are no other equivalent collating elements, the treatment is as if the  enclosing  delimiters  were
       “<b>[.</b>”  and  “<b>.]</b>”.)   For  example,  if  <b>o</b>  and  <b>ô</b> are the members of an equivalence class, then “<b>[[=o=]]</b>”,
       “<b>[[=ô=]]</b>”, and “<b>[oô]</b>” are all synonymous. An equivalence class may not be an endpoint of a range.

              (<u>Note:</u> Tcl implements only the Unicode locale. It does not define  any  equivalence  classes.  The
              examples above are just illustrations.)

</pre><h4><b>ESCAPES</b></h4><pre>
       Escapes  (AREs  only),  which  begin  with  a  <b>\</b>  followed  by an alphanumeric character, come in several
       varieties: character entry, class shorthands, constraint escapes, and back references. A <b>\</b> followed by an
       alphanumeric character but not constituting a valid escape is illegal in AREs.  In  EREs,  there  are  no
       escapes:  outside  a bracket expression, a <b>\</b> followed by an alphanumeric character merely stands for that
       character as an ordinary character, and inside a bracket expression, <b>\</b> is  an  ordinary  character.  (The
       latter is the one actual incompatibility between EREs and AREs.)

   <b>CHARACTER-ENTRY</b> <b>ESCAPES</b>
       Character-entry  escapes  (AREs  only)  exist  to  make  it  easier to specify non-printing and otherwise
       inconvenient characters in REs:

         <b>\a</b>   alert (bell) character, as in C

         <b>\b</b>   backspace, as in C

         <b>\B</b>   synonym for <b>\</b> to help reduce backslash doubling in some  applications  where  there  are  multiple
              levels of backslash processing

         <b>\c</b><u>X</u>  (where  <u>X</u>  is  any character) the character whose low-order 5 bits are the same as those of <u>X</u>, and
              whose other bits are all zero

         <b>\e</b>   the character whose collating-sequence name is “<b>ESC</b>”, or failing that, the  character  with  octal
              value 033

         <b>\f</b>   formfeed, as in C

         <b>\n</b>   newline, as in C

         <b>\r</b>   carriage return, as in C

         <b>\t</b>   horizontal tab, as in C

         <b>\u</b><u>wxyz</u>
              (where  <u>wxyz</u>  is one up to four hexadecimal digits) the Unicode character <b>U+</b><u>wxyz</u> in the local byte
              ordering

         <b>\U</b><u>stuvwxyz</u>
              (where <u>stuvwxyz</u> is one up to eight hexadecimal digits) reserved for a Unicode extension up  to  21
              bits.  The digits are parsed until the first non-hexadecimal character is encountered, the maximum
              of eight hexadecimal digits are reached, or an overflow  would  occur  in  the  maximum  value  of
              <b>U+</b><u>10ffff</u>.

         <b>\v</b>   vertical tab, as in C

         <b>\x</b><u>hh</u> (where <u>hh</u> is one or two hexadecimal digits) the character whose hexadecimal value is <b>0x</b><u>hh</u>.

         <b>\0</b>   the character whose value is <b>0</b>

         <b>\</b><u>xyz</u> (where  <u>xyz</u>  is exactly three octal digits, and is not a <u>back</u> <u>reference</u> (see below)) the character
              whose octal value is <b>0</b><u>xyz</u>. The first digit must be in the range 0-3, otherwise the two-digit  form
              is assumed.

         <b>\</b><u>xy</u>  (where  <u>xy</u>  is  exactly  two  octal digits, and is not a <u>back</u> <u>reference</u> (see below)) the character
              whose octal value is <b>0</b><u>xy</u>

       Hexadecimal digits are “<b>0</b>”-“<b>9</b>”, “<b>a</b>”-“<b>f</b>”, and “<b>A</b>”-“<b>F</b>”.  Octal digits are “<b>0</b>”-“<b>7</b>”.

       The character-entry escapes are always taken as ordinary characters.  For example, <b>\135</b> is <b>]</b> in  Unicode,
       but  <b>\135</b>  does  not  terminate  a  bracket  expression. Beware, however, that some applications (e.g., C
       compilers and the Tcl interpreter if the regular expression is not quoted  with  braces)  interpret  such
       sequences  themselves  before the regular-expression package gets to see them, which may require doubling
       (quadrupling, etc.) the “<b>\</b>”.

   <b>CLASS-SHORTHAND</b> <b>ESCAPES</b>
       Class-shorthand escapes (AREs only) provide shorthands for certain commonly-used character classes:

         <b>\d</b>        <b>[[:digit:]]</b>

         <b>\s</b>        <b>[[:space:]]</b>

         <b>\w</b>        <b>[[:alnum:]_\u203F\u2040\u2054\uFE33\uFE34\uFE4D\uFE4E\uFE4F\uFF3F]</b>   (including   punctuation
                   connector characters)

         <b>\D</b>        <b>[^[:digit:]]</b>

         <b>\S</b>        <b>[^[:space:]]</b>

         <b>\W</b>        <b>[^[:alnum:]_\u203F\u2040\u2054\uFE33\uFE34\uFE4D\uFE4E\uFE4F\uFF3F]</b>   (including  punctuation
                   connector characters)

       Within bracket expressions, “<b>\d</b>”, “<b>\s</b>”, and “<b>\w</b>” lose their outer brackets, and “<b>\D</b>”, “<b>\S</b>”, and “<b>\W</b>”  are
       illegal.  (So,  for  example,  “<b>[a-c\d]</b>”  is  equivalent  to “<b>[a-c[:digit:]]</b>”.  Also, “<b>[a-c\D]</b>”, which is
       equivalent to “<b>[a-c^[:digit:]]</b>”, is illegal.)

   <b>CONSTRAINT</b> <b>ESCAPES</b>
       A constraint escape (AREs only) is a constraint, matching the empty string  if  specific  conditions  are
       met, written as an escape:

         <b>\A</b>    matches only at the beginning of the string (see <b>MATCHING</b>, below, for how this differs from “<b>^</b>”)

         <b>\m</b>    matches only at the beginning of a word

         <b>\M</b>    matches only at the end of a word

         <b>\y</b>    matches only at the beginning or end of a word

         <b>\Y</b>    matches only at a point that is not the beginning or end of a word

         <b>\Z</b>    matches only at the end of the string (see <b>MATCHING</b>, below, for how this differs from “<b>$</b>”)

         <b>\</b><u>m</u>    (where <u>m</u> is a nonzero digit) a <u>back</u> <u>reference</u>, see below

         <b>\</b><u>mnn</u>  (where <u>m</u> is a nonzero digit, and <u>nn</u> is some more digits, and the decimal value <u>mnn</u> is not greater
               than the number of closing capturing parentheses seen so far) a <u>back</u> <u>reference</u>, see below

       A  word  is  defined  as  in  the  specification of “<b>[[:&lt;:]]</b>” and “<b>[[:&gt;:]]</b>” above. Constraint escapes are
       illegal within bracket expressions.

   <b>BACK</b> <b>REFERENCES</b>
       A back reference (AREs only) matches the same string matched by the parenthesized subexpression specified
       by the number, so that (e.g.)  “<b>([bc])\1</b>” matches “<b>bb</b>” or “<b>cc</b>” but  not  “<b>bc</b>”.   The  subexpression  must
       entirely precede the back reference in the RE.  Subexpressions are numbered in the order of their leading
       parentheses.  Non-capturing parentheses do not define subexpressions.

       There  is  an  inherent  historical  ambiguity between octal character-entry escapes and back references,
       which is resolved by heuristics, as hinted at above. A leading zero always indicates an octal  escape.  A
       single  non-zero digit, not followed by another digit, is always taken as a back reference. A multi-digit
       sequence not starting with a zero is taken as a back reference if it comes after a suitable subexpression
       (i.e. the number is in the legal range for a back reference), and otherwise is taken as octal.

</pre><h4><b>METASYNTAX</b></h4><pre>
       In addition to the main syntax described above, there are some special forms and miscellaneous  syntactic
       facilities available.

       Normally  the  flavor  of RE being used is specified by application-dependent means. However, this can be
       overridden by a <u>director</u>. If an RE of any flavor begins with “<b>***:</b>”, the rest of the RE is an ARE. If  an
       RE  of  any  flavor  begins  with  “<b>***=</b>”,  the  rest of the RE is taken to be a literal string, with all
       characters considered ordinary characters.

       An ARE may begin with <u>embedded</u>  <u>options</u>:  a  sequence  <b>(?</b><u>xyz</u><b>)</b>  (where  <u>xyz</u>  is  one  or  more  alphabetic
       characters)  specifies  options  affecting  the  rest  of the RE. These supplement, and can override, any
       options specified by the application. The available option letters are:

         <b>b</b>  rest of RE is a BRE

         <b>c</b>  case-sensitive matching (usual default)

         <b>e</b>  rest of RE is an ERE

         <b>i</b>  case-insensitive matching (see <b>MATCHING</b>, below)

         <b>m</b>  historical synonym for <b>n</b>

         <b>n</b>  newline-sensitive matching (see <b>MATCHING</b>, below)

         <b>p</b>  partial newline-sensitive matching (see <b>MATCHING</b>, below)

         <b>q</b>  rest of RE is a literal (“quoted”) string, all ordinary characters

         <b>s</b>  non-newline-sensitive matching (usual default)

         <b>t</b>  tight syntax (usual default; see below)

         <b>w</b>  inverse partial newline-sensitive (“weird”) matching (see <b>MATCHING</b>, below)

         <b>x</b>  expanded syntax (see below)

       Embedded options take effect at the <b>)</b> terminating the sequence.  They are available only at the start  of
       an ARE, and may not be used later within it.

       In addition to the usual (<u>tight</u>) RE syntax, in which all characters are significant, there is an <u>expanded</u>
       syntax,  available in all flavors of RE with the <b>-expanded</b> switch, or in AREs with the embedded x option.
       In the expanded syntax, white-space characters are ignored  and  all  characters  between  a  <b>#</b>  and  the
       following  newline  (or  the end of the RE) are ignored, permitting paragraphing and commenting a complex
       RE. There are three exceptions to that basic rule:

       •  a white-space character or “<b>#</b>” preceded by “<b>\</b>” is retained

       •  white space or “<b>#</b>” within a bracket expression is retained

       •  white space and comments are illegal within multi-character symbols like the ARE “<b>(?:</b>” or the BRE “<b>\(</b>”

       Expanded-syntax white-space characters are blank, tab, newline, and any character  that  belongs  to  the
       <u>space</u> character class.

       Finally,  in  an  ARE,  outside  bracket  expressions,  the sequence “<b>(?#</b><u>ttt</u><b>)</b>” (where <u>ttt</u> is any text not
       containing a “<b>)</b>”) is a comment, completely ignored. Again, this is not allowed between the characters  of
       multi-character symbols like “<b>(?:</b>”.  Such comments are more a historical artifact than a useful facility,
       and their use is deprecated; use the expanded syntax instead.

       <u>None</u>  of  these metasyntax extensions is available if the application (or an initial “<b>***=</b>” director) has
       specified that the user's input be treated as a literal string rather than as an RE.

       In the event that an RE could match more than one substring of a given string, the  RE  matches  the  one
       starting  earliest  in  the string. If the RE could match more than one substring starting at that point,
       its choice is determined by its <u>preference</u>: either the longest substring, or the shortest.

       Most atoms, and all constraints, have no preference. A parenthesized RE has the same preference (possibly
       none) as the RE. A quantified atom with quantifier <b>{</b><u>m</u><b>}</b> or <b>{</b><u>m</u><b>}?</b> has the same preference (possibly none) as
       the atom itself. A quantified atom with other normal quantifiers (including <b>{</b><u>m</u><b>,</b><u>n</u><b>}</b>  with  <u>m</u>  equal  to  <u>n</u>)
       prefers  longest  match.  A  quantified  atom with other non-greedy quantifiers (including <b>{</b><u>m</u><b>,</b><u>n</u><b>}?</b>  with <u>m</u>
       equal to <u>n</u>) prefers shortest match. A branch has the same preference as the first quantified atom  in  it
       which  has  a  preference.  An  RE consisting of two or more branches connected by the <b>|</b> operator prefers
       longest match.

       Subject to the constraints imposed by the rules for matching the whole RE, subexpressions also match  the
       longest or shortest possible substrings, based on their preferences, with subexpressions starting earlier
       in  the  RE  taking  priority over ones starting later. Note that outer subexpressions thus take priority
       over their component subexpressions.

       The quantifiers <b>{1,1}</b> and <b>{1,1}?</b> can be used to force longest and shortest preference, respectively, on a
       subexpression or a whole RE.

              <b>NOTE:</b> This means that you can usually make a RE be non-greedy overall by putting <b>{1,1}?</b> after  one
              of  the  first  non-constraint atoms or parenthesized sub-expressions in it. <u>It</u> <u>pays</u> <u>to</u> <u>experiment</u>
              with the placing of this non-greediness override on a suitable range of input texts when  you  are
              writing a RE if you are using this level of complexity.

              For example, this regular expression is non-greedy, and will match the shortest substring possible
              given that “<b>abc</b>” will be matched as early as possible (the quantifier does not change that):

                     ab{1,1}?c.*x.*cba

              The  atom  “<b>a</b>”  has  no  greediness  preference, we explicitly give one for “<b>b</b>”, and the remaining
              quantifiers are overridden to be non-greedy by the preceding non-greedy quantifier.

       Match lengths are measured in characters, not collating elements. An empty string  is  considered  longer
       than   no   match   at  all.  For  example,  “<b>bb*</b>”  matches  the  three  middle  characters  of  “<b>abbbc</b>”,
       “<b>(week|wee)(night|knights)</b>” matches all ten characters of “<b>weeknights</b>”, when “<b>(.*).*</b>”  is matched against
       “<b>abc</b>” the parenthesized subexpression matches all three characters, and when “<b>(a*)*</b>” is  matched  against
       “<b>bc</b>” both the whole RE and the parenthesized subexpression match an empty string.

       If  case-independent  matching  is specified, the effect is much as if all case distinctions had vanished
       from the alphabet. When an alphabetic that exists in multiple cases  appears  as  an  ordinary  character
       outside  a  bracket  expression,  it is effectively transformed into a bracket expression containing both
       cases, so that <b>x</b> becomes “<b>[xX]</b>”.  When it appears inside a bracket expression, all case  counterparts  of
       it are added to the bracket expression, so that “<b>[x]</b>” becomes “<b>[xX]</b>” and “<b>[^x]</b>” becomes “<b>[^xX]</b>”.

       If  newline-sensitive  matching  is  specified,  <b>.</b>  and  bracket expressions using <b>^</b> will never match the
       newline character (so that matches will never cross newlines unless the RE explicitly arranges it) and  <b>^</b>
       and  <b>$</b>  will  match  the empty string after and before a newline respectively, in addition to matching at
       beginning and end of string respectively. ARE <b>\A</b> and <b>\Z</b> continue to match  beginning  or  end  of  string
       <u>only</u>.

       If  partial  newline-sensitive  matching  is  specified,  this  affects <b>.</b> and bracket expressions as with
       newline-sensitive matching, but not <b>^</b> and <b>$</b>.

       If inverse partial newline-sensitive matching is specified,  this  affects  <b>^</b>  and  <b>$</b>  as  with  newline-
       sensitive  matching,  but  not  <b>.</b>  and  bracket  expressions. This is not very useful but is provided for
       symmetry.

</pre><h4><b>LIMITS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>COMPATIBILITY</b></h4><pre>
       No particular limit is imposed on the length of REs. Programs intended to be highly portable  should  not
       employ REs longer than 256 bytes, as a POSIX-compliant implementation can refuse to accept such REs.

       The  only  feature  of  AREs  that  is  actually incompatible with POSIX EREs is that <b>\</b> does not lose its
       special significance inside bracket expressions. All other ARE features use syntax which  is  illegal  or
       has  undefined  or unspecified effects in POSIX EREs; the <b>***</b> syntax of directors likewise is outside the
       POSIX syntax for both BREs and EREs.

       Many of the ARE extensions are borrowed from Perl, but some have been changed to clean them up, and a few
       Perl extensions are not present.  Incompatibilities of note include  “<b>\b</b>”,  “<b>\B</b>”,  the  lack  of  special
       treatment for a trailing newline, the addition of complemented bracket expressions to the things affected
       by  newline-sensitive  matching,  the  restrictions  on  parentheses  and  back  references  in lookahead
       constraints, and the longest/shortest-match (rather than first-match) matching semantics.

       The matching rules for REs containing both normal and non-greedy quantifiers  have  changed  since  early
       beta-test  versions of this package. (The new rules are much simpler and cleaner, but do not work as hard
       at guessing the user's real intentions.)

       Henry Spencer's original 1986 <u>regexp</u> package, still in widespread use (e.g., in pre-8.1 releases of Tcl),
       implemented an early version of today's EREs. There are four incompatibilities between <u>regexp</u>'s near-EREs
       (“RREs” for short) and AREs. In roughly increasing order of significance:

       •  In AREs, <b>\</b> followed by an alphanumeric character is either an escape or an error, while  in  RREs,  it
          was  just  another  way of writing the alphanumeric. This should not be a problem because there was no
          reason to write such a sequence in RREs.

       •  <b>{</b> followed by a digit in an ARE is the beginning of a bound, while in RREs, <b>{</b> was always  an  ordinary
          character.  Such  sequences  should  be  rare,  and  will  often  result in an error because following
          characters will not look like a valid bound.

       •  In AREs, <b>\</b> remains a special character within “<b>[]</b>”, so a literal <b>\</b> within <b>[]</b> must be written “<b>\\</b>”.  <b>\\</b>
          also gives a literal <b>\</b> within <b>[]</b> in RREs, but only truly paranoid programmers  routinely  doubled  the
          backslash.

       •  AREs  report  the longest/shortest match for the RE, rather than the first found in a specified search
          order. This may affect some RREs which were written in the expectation that the first match  would  be
          reported.  (The  careful  crafting  of RREs to optimize the search order for fast matching is obsolete
          (AREs examine all possible matches in parallel, and their performance is largely insensitive to  their
          complexity)  but cases where the search order was exploited to deliberately find a match which was <u>not</u>
          the longest/shortest will need rewriting.)

</pre><h4><b>BASIC</b> <b>REGULAR</b> <b>EXPRESSIONS</b></h4><pre>
       BREs differ from EREs in several respects.  “<b>|</b>”, “<b>+</b>”, and <b>?</b> are  ordinary  characters  and  there  is  no
       equivalent for their functionality. The delimiters for bounds are <b>\{</b> and “<b>\}</b>”, with <b>{</b> and <b>}</b> by themselves
       ordinary  characters.  The  parentheses  for  nested  subexpressions  are  <b>\(</b>  and  “<b>\)</b>”, with <b>(</b> and <b>)</b> by
       themselves ordinary characters. <b>^</b> is an ordinary character except at the  beginning  of  the  RE  or  the
       beginning of a parenthesized subexpression, <b>$</b> is an ordinary character except at the end of the RE or the
       end  of  a  parenthesized subexpression, and <b>*</b> is an ordinary character if it appears at the beginning of
       the RE or the beginning of a parenthesized  subexpression  (after  a  possible  leading  “<b>^</b>”).   Finally,
       single-digit  back  references  are  available,  and  <b>\&lt;</b>  and <b>\&gt;</b> are synonyms for “<b>[[:&lt;:]]</b>” and “<b>[[:&gt;:]]</b>”
       respectively; no other escapes are available.
