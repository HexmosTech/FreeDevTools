</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Math::Calculus::Expression - Algebraic Calculus Tools Expression Class

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Math::Calculus::Expression;

         # Create an expression object.
         my $exp = Math::Calculus::Expression-&gt;new;

         # Set a variable and expression.
         $exp-&gt;addVariable('x');
         $exp-&gt;setExpression('x^(2+1) + 6*5*x') or die $exp-&gt;getError;

         # Simplify
         $exp-&gt;simplify or die $exp-&gt;getError;;

         # Print the result.
         print $exp-&gt;getExpression; # Prints x^3 + 30*x

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module can take an algebraic expression, parse it into a tree structure, simplify the tree,
       substitute variables and named constants for other variables or constants (which may be numeric),
       numerically evaluate the tree and turn the tree back into an output of the same form as the input.

       It supports a wide range of expressions including the +, -, *, / and ^ (raise to power) operators,
       bracketed expressions to enable correct precedence and the functions ln, exp, sin, cos, tan, sec, cosec,
       cot, sinh, cosh, tanh, sech, cosech, coth, asin, acos, atan, asinh, acosh and atanh.

</pre><h4><b>EXPORT</b></h4><pre>
       None by default.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       new
             $exp = Math::Calculus::Expression-&gt;new;

           Creates  a new instance of the expression object, which can hold an individual expression and perform
           basic operations on it.

       addVariable
             $exp-&gt;addVariable('x');

           Sets a certain named value in the expression as being a variable. A named value must be an alphabetic
           chracter.

       setExpression
             $exp-&gt;setExpression('x^2 + 5*x);

           Takes an expression in human-readable form and stores it internally as a tree structure, checking  it
           is  a  valid expression that the module can understand in the process. Note that the module is strict
           about syntax. For example, note above that you must write 5*x and not just 5x. Whitespace is  allowed
           in the expression, but does not have any effect on precedence.  If you require control of precedence,
           use brackets; bracketed expressions will always be evaluated first, as you would normally expect. The
           module  follows  the  BODMAS  precedence  convention.  Returns  undef  on failure and a true value on
           success.

       getExpression
             $expr = $exp-&gt;getExpression;

           Returns a textaul, human readable representation of the expression that is being stored.

       simplify
             $exp-&gt;simplify;

           Attempts to simplify the expression that is stored internally.

       evaluate
             $exp-&gt;evaluate(x =&gt; 0.5, a =&gt; 4);

           This method takes a hash mapping any variables and named constants (represented by  letters)  in  the
           expression to numerical values, and attempts to evaluate the expression and return a numerical value.
           It  fails  and returns undef if it finds letters that have no mapping or an error such as division by
           zero occurs during the evaluation.

       sameRepresentation
             $same = $exp-&gt;sameRepresentation($exp2);

           The sameRepresentation method takes another expression object as its parameter and  returns  true  if
           that  expression  has the same internal representation as the expression the method is invoked on. Be
           careful - while it can be said that if two expressions have the same representation they  are  equal,
           it  would be wrong to say that if they have different representations they are not equal. It is clear
           to see that "x + 2" and "2 + x" are equal, but their internal representation may well differ.

       clone
             $expCopy = $exp-&gt;clone;

           The clone method returns a deep copy of the expression object (deep copy meaning that if the original
           is modified the copy will not be affected and vice versa).

       getTraceback
             $exp-&gt;getTraceback;

           When setExpression and differentiate are called, a traceback is  generated  to  describe  what  these
           functions  did.  If an error occurs, this traceback can be extremely useful in helping track down the
           source of the error.

       getError
             $exp-&gt;getError;

           When any method other than getTraceback is called, the error message stored is cleared, and then  any
           errors  that occur during the execution of the method are stored. If failure occurs, call this method
           to get a textual representation of the error.

       Other Methods
           Any other method call is taken to refer to a subclass of Expression. The first letter of the name  of
           the method invoked is capitalized, then a module by that name is loaded (if it exists) and the method
           is  called  on  it.  This works for, for example, the Differentiate module; calling the differentiate
           method on an Expression will load the Differentiate module and call the differentiate  method.  If  a
           module cannot be loaded or the method cannot be called, then this module will die.
