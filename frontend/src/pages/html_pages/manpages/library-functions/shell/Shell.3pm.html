       Shell - run shell commands transparently within perl

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
          use Shell qw(cat ps cp);
          $passwd = cat('&lt;<a href="file:/etc/passwd">/etc/passwd</a>');
          @pslines = ps('-ww'),
          cp("<a href="file:/etc/passwd">/etc/passwd</a>", "/tmp/passwd");

          # object oriented
          my $sh = Shell-&gt;new;
          print $sh-&gt;ls('-l');

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Caveats</b>
       This package is included as a show case, illustrating a few Perl features.  It shouldn't be used for
       production programs. Although it does provide a simple interface for obtaining the standard output of
       arbitrary commands, there may be better ways of achieving what you need.

       Running shell commands while obtaining standard output can be done with the "qx/STRING/" operator, or by
       calling "open" with a filename expression that ends with "|", giving you the option to process one line
       at a time.  If you don't need to process standard output at all, you might use "system" (in preference of
       doing a print with the collected standard output).

       Since Shell.pm and all of the aforementioned techniques use your system's shell to call some local
       command, none of them is portable across different systems. Note, however, that there are several built
       in functions and library packages providing portable implementations of functions operating on files,
       such as: "glob", "link" and "unlink", "mkdir" and "rmdir", "rename", "File::Compare", "File::Copy",
       "File::Find" etc.

       Using Shell.pm while importing "foo" creates a subroutine "foo" in the namespace of the importing
       package. Calling "foo" with arguments "arg1", "arg2",... results in a shell command "foo arg1 arg2...",
       where the function name and the arguments are joined with a blank. (See the subsection on Escaping magic
       characters.) Since the result is essentially a command line to be passed to the shell, your notion of
       arguments to the Perl function is not necessarily identical to what the shell treats as a command line
       token, to be passed as an individual argument to the program.  Furthermore, note that this implies that
       "foo" is callable by file name only, which frequently depends on the setting of the program's
       environment.

       Creating a Shell object gives you the opportunity to call any command in the usual OO notation without
       requiring you to announce it in the "use Shell" statement. Don't assume any additional semantics being
       associated with a Shell object: in no way is it similar to a shell process with its environment or
       current working directory or any other setting.

   <b>Escaping</b> <b>Magic</b> <b>Characters</b>
       It is, in general, impossible to take care of quoting the shell's magic characters. For some obscure
       reason, however, Shell.pm quotes apostrophes ("'") and backslashes ("\") on UNIX, and spaces and quotes
       (""") on Windows.

   <b>Configuration</b>
       If you set $Shell::capture_stderr to 1, the module will attempt to capture the standard error output of
       the process as well. This is done by adding "2&gt;&amp;1" to the command line, so don't try this on a system not
       supporting this redirection.

       Setting $Shell::capture_stderr to -1 will send standard error to the bit bucket (i.e., the equivalent of
       adding "2&gt;/dev/null" to the command line).  The same caveat regarding redirection applies.

       If you set $Shell::raw to true no quoting whatsoever is done.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Quoting should be off by default.

       It isn't possible to call shell built in commands, but it can be done by using a workaround, e.g. shell(
       '-c', 'set' ).

       Capturing standard error does not work on some systems (e.g. VMS).

         Subject: a new module I just wrote

       Here's one that'll whack your mind a little out.

           #!<a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?perl">/usr/bin/perl</a>

           use Shell;

           $foo = echo("howdy", "&lt;funny&gt;", "world");
           print $foo;

           $passwd = cat("&lt;<a href="file:/etc/passwd">/etc/passwd</a>");
           print $passwd;

           sub ps;
           print ps -ww;

           cp("<a href="file:/etc/passwd">/etc/passwd</a>", "/etc/passwd.orig");

       That's maybe too gonzo.  It actually exports an AUTOLOAD to the current package (and uncovered a bug in
       Beta 3, by the way).  Maybe the usual usage should be

           use Shell qw(echo cat ps cp);
