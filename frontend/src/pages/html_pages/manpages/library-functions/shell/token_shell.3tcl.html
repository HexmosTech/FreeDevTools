</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This package provides a command which parses a line of text using basic <b>sh</b>-syntax into a list of words.

       The complete set of procedures is described below.

       <b>::string</b> <b>token</b> <b>shell</b> ?<b>-indices</b>? ?<b>-partial</b>? ?--? <u>string</u>
              This  command  parses  the input <u>string</u> under the assumption of it following basic <b>sh</b>-syntax.  The
              result of the command is a list of words in the <u>string</u>.  An error is thrown if the input does  not
              follow  the  allowed  syntax.   The behaviour can be modified by specifying any of the two options
              <b>-indices</b> and <b>-partial</b>.

              <b>--</b>     When specified option parsing stops at this point. This  option  is  needed  if  the  input
                     <u>string</u>  may start with dash. In other words, this is pretty much required if <u>string</u> is user
                     input.

              <b>-indices</b>
                     When specified the output is not a list of words, but a list  of  4-tuples  describing  the
                     words.  Each  tuple contains the type of the word, its start- and end-indices in the input,
                     and the actual text of the word.

                     Note that the length of the word as given by the indices can differ from the length of  the
                     word  found  in the last element of the tuple. The indices describe the words extent in the
                     input, including delimiters, intra-word quoting, etc. whereas for the actual  text  of  the
                     word delimiters are stripped, intra-word quoting decoded, etc.

                     The possible token types are

                     <b>PLAIN</b>  Plain word, not quoted.

                     <b>D:QUOTED</b>
                            Word is delimited by double-quotes.

                     <b>S:QUOTED</b>
                            Word is delimited by single-quotes.

                     <b>D:QUOTED:PART</b>

                     <b>S:QUOTED:PART</b>
                            Like  the  previous  types,  but  the word has no closing quote, i.e. is incomplete.
                            These token types can occur if and only if the option <b>-partial</b>  was  specified,  and
                            only  for the last word of the result. If the option <b>-partial</b> was not specified such
                            incomplete words cause the command to thrown an error instead.

              <b>-partial</b>
                     When specified the parser will accept an  incomplete  quoted  word  (i.e.  without  closing
                     quote) at the end of the line as valid instead of throwing an error.

       The  basic  shell  syntax  accepted  here  are  unquoted,  single-  and double-quoted words, separated by
       whitespace. Leading and trailing whitespace are possible too, and stripped.   Shell  variables  in  their
       various  forms  are  <u>not</u> recognized, nor are sub-shells.  As for the recognized forms of words, see below
       for the detailed specification.

              <b>single-quoted</b> <b>word</b>
                     A single-quoted word begins with a single-quote character, i.e.  <b>'</b> (ASCII 39)  followed  by
                     zero or more unicode characters not a single-quote, and then closed by a single-quote.

                     The  word  must  be  followed by either the end of the string, or whitespace. A word cannot
                     directly follow the word.

              <b>double-quoted</b> <b>word</b>
                     A double-quoted word begins with a double-quote character, i.e.  <b>"</b> (ASCII 34)  followed  by
                     zero or more unicode characters not a double-quote, and then closed by a double-quote.

                     Contrary to single-quoted words a double-quote can be embedded into the word, by prefacing,
                     i.e.  escaping,  i.e.  quoting  it  with  a  backslash  character <b>\</b> (ASCII 92). Similarly a
                     backslash character must be quoted with itself to be inserted literally.

              <b>unquoted</b> <b>word</b>
                     Unquoted words are not delimited by quotes and thus cannot contain  whitespace  or  single-
                     quote  characters. Double-quote and backslash characters can be put into unquoted words, by
                     quting them like for double-quoted words.

              <b>whitespace</b>
                     Whitespace is any unicode space character.  This is equivalent to <b>string</b> <b>is</b> <b>space</b>,  or  the
                     regular expression \\s.

                     Whitespace  may  occur before the first word, or after the last word. Whitespace must occur
                     between adjacent words.
