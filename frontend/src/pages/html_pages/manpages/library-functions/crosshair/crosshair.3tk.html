</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>crosshair</b> package provides commands to (de)activate and track crosshairs on canvas widgets.

</pre><h4><b>API</b></h4><pre>
       The following commands are exported to the public:

       <b>crosshair::crosshair</b> <u>w</u> ?<u>arg</u>...?
              This  command  activates  the display of a pair of cross-hairs for the canvas widget <u>w</u>. The cross-
              hairs track the pointing device. The result of the command is the empty string.

              All arguments after the widget <u>w</u> are treated as options as  for  a  canvas  line  item  in  <u>w</u>.  Of
              particular interest are <b>-fill</b> and <b>-dash</b>.

       <b>crosshair::off</b> <u>w</u>
              This  command removes the cross-hairs from the canvas widget <u>w</u>.  Nothing is done if the widget had
              no cross-hairs. The result of the command is the empty string.

       <b>crosshair::configure</b> <u>w</u> ?<u>arg</u>...?
              This command changes the appearance of the cross-hairs in the canvas widget <u>w</u>. It is an  error  to
              call it for a canvas which has no cross-hairs.

              All  arguments  after  the  widget  <u>w</u>  are  treated  as options as for a canvas line item in <u>w</u>. Of
              particular interest are <b>-fill</b> and <b>-dash</b>.

              The result of the command are the current configuration settings.

       <b>crosshair::track</b> <b>on</b> <u>w</u> <u>cmdprefix</u>
              This command activates reporting of the location of the cross-hairs in the canvas widget <u>w</u>. It  is
              an  error  to use this command for a canvas which has no cross-hairs. The result of the command is
              the empty string.

              After the invokation of this command  the  specified  command  prefix  <u>cmdprefix</u>  will  be  called
              whenever the mouse moves within the canvas, with 7 arguments. These are, in order:

              [1]    The widget <u>w</u>

              [2]    The x-location of the cross-hairs, in pixels.

              [3]    The y-location of the cross-hairs, in pixels.

              [4]    The x-location of the top-left corner of the viewport, in pixels.

              [5]    The y-location of the top-left corner of the viewport, in pixels.

              [6]    The x-location of the bottom-right corner of the viewport, in pixels.

              [7]    The y-location of the bottom-right corner of the viewport, in pixels.

              A  previously  existing  callback  for <u>w</u> will be disabled. I.e. per canvas widget with cross-hairs
              only one callback reporting their location is possible.

       <b>crosshair::track</b> <b>off</b> <u>w</u>
              This command disables the reporting of the location of the cross-hairs in the canvas widget <u>w</u>.  It
              is  an  error to use this command for a canvas which has no cross-hairs. The result of the command
              is the empty string.

       <b>crosshair::bbox_add</b> <u>w</u> <u>bbox</u>
              This command adds a bounding box to the crosshairs for canvas <u>w</u>.   The  crosshairs  will  only  be
              active within that area.

              The  result  of  the  command  is  a  token  with which the bounding box can be removed again, see
              <b>crosshair::bbox_remove</b> below.

              The bounding box <u>bbox</u> is specified thorugh a list of 4 values, the  lower  left  and  upper  right
              corners of the box. The order of values in the list is:

              llx lly urx ury

       Note that this command can be used multiple times, each call adding one more bounding box. In such a case
       the visible area is the <u>union</u> of all the specified bounding boxes.

       <b>crosshair::bbox_remove</b> <u>token</u>
              This  command  removes  the  bounding box specified by the <u>token</u> (a result of <b>crosshair::bbox_add</b>)
              from the crosshairs for its canvas widget.
