</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Data::UUID::MT - Fast random UUID generator using the Mersenne Twister algorithm

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 1.001

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Data::UUID::MT;
         my $ug1 = Data::UUID::MT-&gt;new( version =&gt; 4 ); # "1", "4" or "4s"
         my $ug2 = Data::UUID::MT-&gt;new();               # default is "4"

         # method interface
         my $uuid1 = $ug-&gt;create();        # 16 byte binary string
         my $uuid2 = $ug-&gt;create_hex();
         my $uuid3 = $ug-&gt;create_string();

         # iterator -- avoids some method call overhead
         my $next = $ug-&gt;iterator;
         my $uuid4 = $next-&gt;();

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This UUID generator uses the excellent Math::Random::MT::Auto module as a source of fast, high-quality
       (pseudo) random numbers.

       Three different types of UUIDs are supported.  Two are consistent with RFC 4122 and one is a custom
       variant that provides a 'sequential UUID' that can be advantageous when used as a primary database key.

       <b>Note</b>: The Mersenne Twister pseudo-random number generator has excellent statistical properties, but it is
       not considered cryptographically secure.  Pseudo-random UUIDs are not recommended for use as security
       authentication tokens in cookies or other user-visible session identifiers.

   <b>Version</b> <b>1</b> <b>UUIDs</b>
       The UUID generally follows the "version 1" spec from the RFC, however the clock sequence and MAC address
       are randomly generated each time.  (This is permissible within the spec of the RFC.)  The generated MAC
       address has the the multicast bit set as mandated by the RFC to ensure it does not conflict with real MAC
       addresses.  This UUID has 60 bits of timestamp data, 61 bits of pseudo-random data and 7 mandated bits
       (multicast bit, "variant" field and "version" field).

   <b>Version</b> <b>4</b> <b>UUIDs</b>
       The UUID follows the "version 4" spec, with 122 pseudo-random bits and 6 mandated bits ("variant" field
       and "version" field).

   <b>Version</b> <b>4s</b> <b>UUIDs</b>
       This is a custom UUID form that resembles "version 4" form, but that overlays the first 60 bits with a
       timestamp akin to "version 1",  Unlike "version 1", this custom version preserves the ordering of bits
       from high to low, whereas "version 1" puts the low 32 bits of the timestamp first, then the middle 16
       bits, then multiplexes the high bits with version field.  This "4s" variant provides a "sequential UUID"
       with the timestamp providing order and the remaining random bits making collision with other UUIDs
       created at the exact same microsecond highly unlikely.  This UUID has 60 timestamp bits, 62 pseudo-random
       bits and 6 mandated bits ("variant" field and "version" field).

   <b>Unsupported:</b> <b>Versions</b> <b>2,</b> <b>3</b> <b>and</b> <b>5</b>
       This module focuses on generation of UUIDs with random elements and does not support UUID versions 2, 3
       and 5.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>new</b>
         my $ug = Data::UUID::MT-&gt;new( version =&gt; 4 );

       Creates a UUID generator object.  The only allowed versions are "1", "4" and "4s".  If no version is
       specified, it defaults to "4".

   <b>create</b>
         my $uuid = $ug-&gt;create;

       Returns a UUID packed into a 16 byte string.

   <b>create_hex</b>
         my $uuid = $ug-&gt;create_hex();

       Returns a UUID as a lowercase hex string, prefixed with "0x", e.g.  0xb0470602a64b11da863293ebf1c0e05a

   <b>create_string</b>
         my $uuid = $ug-&gt;create_string(); #

       Returns UUID as a lowercase string in "standard" format, e.g.  "b0470602-a64b-11da-8632-93ebf1c0e05a"

   <b>iterator</b>
         my $next = $ug-&gt;iterator;
         my $uuid = $next-&gt;();

       Returns a reference to the internal UUID generator function.  Because this avoids method call overhead,
       it is slightly faster than calling "create".

   <b>reseed</b>
         $ug-&gt;reseed;

       Reseeds the internal pseudo-random number generator.  This happens automatically after a fork or thread
       creation (assuming Scalar::Util::weaken), but may be called manually if desired for some reason.

       Any arguments provided are passed to <b>Math::Random::MT::Auto::srand()</b> for custom seeding.

         $ug-&gt;reseed('hotbits' =&gt; 250, '/dev/random');

</pre><h4><b>UUID</b> <b>STRING</b> <b>REPRESENTATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       A UUID contains 16 bytes.  A hex string representation looks like 0xb0470602a64b11da863293ebf1c0e05a. A
       "standard" representation looks like "b0470602-a64b-11da-8632-93ebf1c0e05a".  Sometimes these are seen in
       upper case and on Windows the standard format is often seen wrapped in parentheses.

       Converting back and forth is easy with "pack" and "unpack".

         # string to 16 bytes
         $string =~ s/^0x//i;            # remove leading "0x"
         $string =~ tr/()-//d;           # strip '-' and parentheses
         $binary = pack("H*", $string);

         # 16 bytes to uppercase string formats
         $hex = "0x" . uc unpack("H*", $binary);
         $std = uc join "-", unpack("H8H4H4H4H12", $binary);

       If you need a module that provides these conversions for you, consider UUID::Tiny.

</pre><h4><b>COMPARISON</b> <b>TO</b> <b>OTHER</b> <b>UUID</b> <b>MODULES</b></h4><pre>
       At the time of writing, there are five other general purpose UUID generators on CPAN that I consider
       potential alternatives.  Data::UUID::MT is included in the discussion below for comparison.

       •   Data::GUID - version 1 UUIDs (wrapper around Data::UUID)

       •   Data::UUID - version 1 or 3 UUIDs (derived from RFC 4122 code)

       •   Data::UUID::LibUUID - version 1 or 4 UUIDs (libuuid)

       •   UUID - version 1 or 4 UUIDs (libuuid)

       •   UUID::Tiny - versions 1, 3, 4, or 5 (pure perl)

       •   Data::UUID::MT - version 1 or 4 (or custom sequential "4s")

       "libuuid" based UUIDs may generally be either version 4 (preferred) or version 1 (fallback), depending on
       the  availability  of a good random bit source (e.g.  /dev/random).  "libuuid" version 1 UUIDs could also
       be provided by the "uuidd" daemon if available.

       UUID.pm leaves the choice of version up to "libuuid".  Data::UUID::LibUUID does so by default,  but  also
       allows  specifying  a  specific  version.   Note that Data::UUID::LibUUID incorrectly refers to version 1
       UUIDs as version 2 UUIDs.  For example, to get a  version  1  binary  UUID  explicitly,  you  would  call
       Data::UUID::LibUUID::<a href="../man2/new_uuid_binary.2.html">new_uuid_binary</a>(2).

       In addition to differences mentioned below, there are additional slight difference in how the modules (or
       "libuuid")  treat  the "clock sequence" field and otherwise attempt to keep state between calls, but this
       is generally immaterial.

   <b>Use</b> <b>of</b> <b>Ethernet</b> <b>MAC</b> <b>addresses</b>
       Version 1 UUID generators differ in whether they include the Ethernet MAC address as a "node  identifier"
       as  specified  in  RFC  4122.  Including the MAC has security implications as Version 1 UUIDs can then be
       traced to a particular machine at a particular time.

       For "libuuid" based modules, Version 1 UUIDs will include the actual MAC address, if available,  or  will
       substitute a random MAC (with multicast bit set).

       Data::UUID  version  1  UUIDs  do  not  contain  the MAC address, but replace it with an MD5 hash of data
       including the hostname and host id (possibly just the IP address), modified with the multicast bit.

       Both UUID::Tiny and Data::UUID::MT version 1 UUIDs do not contain the actual MAC address, but replace  it
       with a random multicast MAC address.

   <b>Source</b> <b>of</b> <b>random</b> <b>bits</b>
       All the modules differ in the source of random bits.

       "libuuid"  based  modules  get random bits from "/dev/random" or "/dev/urandom" or fall back to a pseudo-
       random number generator.

       Data::UUID only uses random data to see the clock sequence and gets bits from the C "rand()" function.

       UUID::Tiny uses Perl's "rand()" function.

       Data::UUID::MT gets random bits from Math::Random::MT::Auto, which uses the Mersenne  Twister  algorithm.
       Math::Random::MT::Auto  seeds  from  system  sources  (including Win32 specific ones on that platform) if
       available and falls back to other less ideal sources if not.

   <b>Fork</b> <b>and</b> <b>thread</b> <b>safety</b>
       Pseudo-random number generators used in generating UUIDs should be reseeded if the process  forks  or  if
       threads are created.

       Data::UUID::MT  checks  if  the process ID has changed before generating a UUID and reseeds if necessary.
       If Scalar::Util is installed and provides "weaken()", Data::UUID::MT will  also  reseed  its  objects  on
       thread creation.

       Data::UUID::LibUUID will reseed on fork on Mac OSX.

       I have not explored further whether other UUID generators are fork/thread safe.

   <b>Benchmarks</b>
       The  <u>examples/bench.pl</u> program included with this module does some simple benchmarking of UUID generation
       speeds.  Here is the output from my desktop system (AMD Phenom II X6 1045T CPU).  Note that "v?" is  used
       where the choice is left to "libuuid" -- which will result in version 4 UUIDs on my system.

        Benchmark on Perl v5.14.0 for x86_64-linux with 8 byte integers.

        Key:
          U     =&gt; UUID 0.02
          UT    =&gt; UUID::Tiny 1.03
          DG    =&gt; Data::GUID 0.046
          DU    =&gt; Data::UUID 1.217
          DULU  =&gt; Data::UUID::LibUUID 0.05
          DUMT  =&gt; Data::UUID::MT 0.001

        Benchmarks are marked as to which UUID version is generated.
        Some modules offer method ('meth') and function ('func') interfaces.
