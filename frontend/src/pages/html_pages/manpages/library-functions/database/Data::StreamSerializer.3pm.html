</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Data::StreamSerializer - non-blocking serializer.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Data::StreamSerializer;

         my $sr = new Data::StreamSerializer('You data');

         while(defined(my $part = $sr-&gt;next)) {
             print $socket $part;
         }

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Sometimes You need to serialize a lot of data. If You use 'Dumper' it can take You for much time. If Your
       code is executed in event machine it can be inadmissible. So using the module You can serialize Your data
       progressively and do something between serialization itearions.

       This module works slower than Data::Dumper, but it can serialize object progressively and You can do
       something else between serialization iterations.

   <b>Recognized</b> <b>types.</b>
       <u>HASH</u>

       <u>ARRAY</u>

       <u>REF</u>

       <u>Regexp</u>

       <u>SCALAR</u>

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>new</b>
       Constructor. All arguments will be serialized.

   <b>next</b>
       Returns next part of serialized string or <b>undef</b> if all data were serialized.

   <b>block_size</b>
       Block size for one iteration. Too small value allows You to spend less time for each iteration, but in
       this case total serialization time will grow.  Nod bad choice to set the value between 200 - 2000 bytes
       (default value is 512). See BENCHMARKS to make a decision.

   <b>recursion_depth</b>
       If serialized object has recursive references, they will be replaced by empty objects. But if this value
       is higher than 1 recursion will be reserialized until the value is reached.

       Example:

           my $t = { a =&gt; 'b' };
           $t-&gt;{c} = $t;

       This example will be serialized into string:

           {"c",{"c",{},"a","b"},"a","b"}

       and if You increment recursion_depth, this example will be serialized into string:
           {"c",{"c",{"c",{},"a","b"},"a","b"},"a","b"}

       etc.

   <b>recursion_detected</b>
       Returns <b>TRUE</b> if a recursion was detected.

   <b>is_eof</b>
       Returns <b>TRUE</b> if eof is reached. If it is <b>TRUE</b> the following next will return <b>undef</b>.

</pre><h4><b>BENCHMARKS</b></h4><pre>
       You can try a few scripts in <b>benchmark/</b> directory. There are a few test arrays in this directory.

       Here are a few test results of my system.

   <b>Array</b> <b>which</b> <b>contains</b> <b>1000</b> <b>hashes:</b>

           Dumper statistic:

                   maximum serialization time: 0.4564 seconds
                   minimum serialization time: 0.4018 seconds
                   average serialization time: 0.4053 seconds

           Data::StreamSerializer statistic:
                   1000 iterations were done
                   520000 SUBiterations were done
                   maximum serialization time: 2.0050 seconds
                   minimum serialization time: 1.3862 seconds
                   average serialization time: 1.4079 seconds
                   average subiteration  time: 0.00271 seconds

       You can see that in any cases one iteration gets the same time.
