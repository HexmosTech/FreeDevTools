</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Data::DownSample::LargestTriangleThreeBuckets  - downsample a data set while retaining its visual
       characteristics

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       Version 1.00

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Implements a downsample technique known as Largest Triangle Three Buckets as defined in Sveinn
       Steinarsson MS thesis.

       <a href="http://skemman.is/stream/get/1946/15343/37285/3/SS_MSthesis.pdf">http://skemman.is/stream/get/1946/15343/37285/3/SS_MSthesis.pdf</a>

       The idea is to downsample a data set without losing the visual character of the plotted data.  The
       technique draws on ideas in cartographic generalization or polyline simplification.  This technique is
       often useful in client-server applications such as webserver-browser where the length of the data far
       exceeds the pixels available to plot. Reducing the data size significantly speeds up data transfer and
       rendering time.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       use Data::DownSample::LargestTriangleThreeBuckets;

       my $lttb = new Data::DownSample::LargestTriangleThreeBuckets( {threshold=&gt;1000} );

       my $data_src = [ [1,2], [2,3], [3,4], [4,5], ... ]; # &lt;-- load your data source here as reference to a
       list of a list

       my $data_sampled = $lttb-&gt;lttb($data_src);

</pre><h4><b>SUBROUTINES/METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>lttb()</b>
       my $data_sampled = $lttb-&gt;lttb($data_src);

       Also can overwrite the class threashold variable such as

       my $data_sampled = $lttb-&gt;lttb($data_src,20000);

       This function is an optimized version of the algorithm given in Sveinn Steinarsson paper.  Several of the
       math operation are factored out of the loops and it executes better than 33% faster.

   <b>lttb_ref()</b>
       my $data_sampled = $lttb-&gt;lttb_ref($data_src);

       The reference function implimentation of the algorithm given in Sveinn Steinarsson paper and used to
       verify that the optimized version is giving correct results.
