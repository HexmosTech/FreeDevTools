</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Search::Xapian::WritableDatabase - writable database object

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This class represents a Xapian database for indexing. It's a subclass of Search::Xapian::Database, which
       is used for searching.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       new &lt;database&gt; or new &lt;path&gt; &lt;mode&gt;
           Class  constructor.  Takes  either  a  database  object,  or  a  path  and one of DB_OPEN, DB_CREATE,
           DB_CREATE_OR_OPEN or DB_CREATE_OR_OVERWRITE.  These are exported  by  Search::Xapian  with  the  'db'
           option.

       clone
           Return a clone of this class.

       flush
           Flush to disk any modifications made to the database.

           For  efficiency  reasons,  when  performing multiple updates to a database it is best (indeed, almost
           essential) to make as many modifications as memory will permit in a single pass through the database.
           To ensure this, Xapian batches up modifications.

           Flush may be called at any time to ensure that the modifications which have been made are written  to
           disk: if the flush succeeds, all the preceding modifications will have been written to disk.

           If  any  of  the  modifications  fail, an exception will be thrown and the database will be left in a
           state in which each separate addition, replacement  or  deletion  operation  has  either  been  fully
           performed or not performed at all: it is then up to the application to work out which operations need
           to be repeated.

           Beware of calling flush too frequently: this will have a severe performance cost.

           Note  that  flush need not be called explicitly: it will be called automatically when the database is
           closed, or when a sufficient number of modifications have been made.

       add_document &lt;document&gt;
           Add a new document to the database.

           This method adds the specified document to the database, returning a newly allocated document ID.

           Note that this does not mean the document will immediately appear in the database;  see  <b>flush()</b>  for
           more details.

           As with all database modification operations, the effect is atomic: the document will either be fully
           added,  or  the  document fails to be added and an exception is thrown (possibly at a later time when
           flush is called or the database is closed).

       delete_document &lt;doc_id&gt;
           Delete a document from the database. This method removes the document with the specified document  ID
           from the database.

           Note  that  this does not mean the document will immediately disappear from the database; see <b>flush()</b>
           for more details.

           As with all database modification operations, the effect is atomic: the document will either be fully
           removed, or the document fails to be removed and an exception is thrown (possibly  at  a  later  time
           when flush is called or the database is closed).

       delete_document_by_term &lt;term&gt;
           Delete  any  documents indexed by a term from the database. This method removes any documents indexed
           by the specified term from the database.

           The intended use is to allow UIDs from another system  to  easily  be  mapped  to  terms  in  Xapian,
           although this method probably has other uses.

       replace_document &lt;doc_id&gt; &lt;document&gt;
           eplace a given document in the database.

           This  method  replaces  the document with the specified document ID. Note that this does not mean the
           document will immediately change in the database; see <b>flush()</b> for more details.

           As with all database modification operations, the effect is atomic: the document will either be fully
           replaced, or the document fails to be replaced and an exception is thrown (possibly at a  later  time
           when flush is called or the database is closed).

       replace_document_by_term &lt;unique_term&gt; &lt;document&gt;
           Replace any documents matching an unique term.

           This  method replaces any documents indexed by the specified term with the specified document. If any
           documents are indexed by the term, the lowest document ID will be used for the document, otherwise  a
           new document ID will be generated as for add_document.

           The  intended  use  is  to  allow  UIDs  from  another system to easily be mapped to terms in Xapian,
           although this method probably has other uses.

           Note that this does not mean the document(s) will immediately change in the database; see <b>flush()</b> for
           more details.

           As with all database modification operations, the effect is atomic: the document(s)  will  either  be
           fully  replaced,  or  the  document(s)  fail to be replaced and an exception is thrown (possibly at a
           later time when flush is called or the database is closed).

       add_spelling &lt;word&gt; &lt;freqinc&gt;
           Add a word to the spelling dictionary.

           If the word is already present, its frequency is increased.

           Parameters:
               word     The word to add.
               freqinc  How much to increase its frequency by (default 1).

       remove_spelling &lt;word&gt; &lt;freqdec&gt;
           Remove a word from the spelling dictionary.

           The word's frequency is decreased, and if would  become  zero  or  less  then  the  word  is  removed
           completely.

           Parameters:
               word     The word to remove.
               freqdec  How much to decrease its frequency by (default 1).

       reopen
           Re-open the database to ensure you are using the latest revision.

       close
           Close the database. This also implies a <b>commit()</b> unless a transaction is in progress.
