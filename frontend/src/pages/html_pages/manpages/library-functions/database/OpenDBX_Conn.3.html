   <b>OpenDBX::Conn::Conn</b> <b>()</b>
       The default constructor for newly created connection objects without parameters. This is method is
       provided to enable programmers to use connection objects as member variables of other classes. They are
       initialized at construction time of the encapsulating object when no values for backend, host and port
       are available yet.

       It's necessary to replace the created object later on by a connection instance where the necessary
       parameters have been given via one of the other constructors. Calling one of the member functions of an
       instance created by the default constructor isn't possible and will throw an exception.

       <b>Returns</b>
           Empty connection instance

           <b>Conn(</b> <b>const</b> <b>string&amp;,</b> <b>const</b> <b>string&amp;,</b> <b>const</b> <b>string&amp;</b> <b>)</b>

   <b>OpenDBX::Conn::Conn</b> <b>(const</b> <b>char</b> <b>*</b> <b>backend,</b> <b>const</b> <b>char</b> <b>*</b> <b>host</b> <b>=</b> <b>'',</b> <b>const</b> <b>char</b> <b>*</b> <b>port</b> <b>=</b> <b>'')std::exception</b>
       Creates a connection object using C style string parameters. Initializes a new connection using the
       parameters <u>backend</u>, <u>host</u> and <u>port</u>, but doesn't open the connection to the database yet. This method
       allows C style strings as values for all parameters. Another constructor for C++ style strings is also
       available. It returns a new connection instance, which can be used to query options implemented by the
       driver or to create a statement. In case of an error, it throws an <b>OpenDBX</b> exception with error message,
       code and severity.

       The parameter <u>backend</u> is the name of the driver the <b>OpenDBX</b> library should use to connect to a database.
       The name must be one of the implemented and available drivers on the system and is case sensitive. All
       driver names are in lower case, e.g. 'mysql'.

       Depending on the database driver, <u>host</u> can have different meanings. Normally, it's the name or IP address
       of the server hosting the database server application. In case of serverless database implementations
       like SQLite it's the directory path where the database file is located. The path must contain the
       platform specific path separators like slash ('/') on Unix-like systems and backslash ('\') on Windows
       systems. Also the path must end with the path separator like '/path/to/file/".

       Furthermore <u>port</u> can be the number or name the database server application is listening to. If a name
       instead of the number is allowed depends on the database client library but the number as string does
       always work. If an empty string is given, the default port of the database server application is used by
       the database client library.

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>backend</u> Name of the backend module to use
           <u>host</u> Name or IP address of the database server
           <u>port</u> Name or number of the port used by the database server

       <b>Returns</b>
           Connection instance

       <b>Exceptions</b>
           <u>std::invalid_argument</u> If the object was only initialized by the default constructor

   <b>OpenDBX::Conn::~Conn</b> <b>()</b>
       Destroys the connection instance if no other references exist. Each connection object uses a reference
       counter to remember if the connection is shared with other objects. If this isn't the case or if this
       object is the last one referencing the connection, the connection is closed and the allocated memory is
       freed.

   <b>OpenDBX::Conn::Conn</b> <b>(const</b> <b>Conn</b> <b>&amp;</b> <b>ref)</b>
       Copy constructor. Enables the transfer of the internal state of an object <u>ref</u> of the same type to this
       object. Both objects share the same database connection and the reference counter afterwards. The
       reference counter is incremented each time an object is copied and will be decremented if it is
       destroyed.

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>ref</u> Original connection object instance

       <b>method</b> <b>=</b> <b>ODBX_BIND_SIMPLE)std::exception</b>
       Authenticates the user and selects the database using C style string parameters. After initializing the
       object instance with one of the constructors taking a backend, host and port string as parameter, it's
       necessary to authenticate the user and select a database. Depending on the database client library, it
       also establishes the connection to the database server. This method accepts C style strings for the
       database name, the user name and the password.

       The first parameter, the name of the database will be used to select the database all further commands
       are operating on. The database is the container for the tables, views, etc., which store the records and
       provide access to them.

       Authentication is done in most cases by a combination of a user name and a password. If the user name is
       known by the database server and the supplied password matches with the stored one, the database server
       will allow the user to operate on the selected database and its tables provided the user has permissions
       to read and/or modify the content.

       The <u>method</u> parameter can be used to select different methods of authentication. At the moment, only
       simple authentication (ODBX_BIND_SIMPLE) with user name and password is available.

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>database</u> Name of the database managed by the database server
           <u>who</u> Name of the user account known by the database server
           <u>cred</u> Necessary credential which belongs to the user account
           <u>method</u> Method used for authentication

       <b>Stmt::Simple)std::exception</b>
       Creates a statement object from a SQL text string using a C style buffer. This method returns an instance
       of the <b>Stmt</b> class that contains the statement sent to the database server later on. Currently, only
       simple statements are supported, which are sent to the database server for parsing and returning the
       result after calling <b>Stmt::execute()</b>. Later on also prepared statements will be possible which are parsed
       by the database server when creating the object and only the parameters will be sent to the database
       server on execution. This can speed up processing especially if the statement is executed multiple times
       with different content for the parameters.

       The parameter named <u>sql</u> must contain the SQL text string that should be sent to the database server for
       execution. It have to be a C style buffer in this case. For a reference of valid SQL statements, please
       have a look at the documentation of your database server.

       The length of the statement excluding the trailing '0' byte should be given via the second parameter
       <u>size</u>. If the length of the statement is unknown, you can also supply zero (0) as size value which is also
       the default value if you hand over only one parameter. In this case, the length of the string is
       calculated internally by this function before the statement is given to the native database library.

       Via the last parameter it can be selected how the statement should be treated internally by the <b>OpenDBX</b>
       and the native database library. Currently, only simple processing is available which sends complete SQL
       statements including its parameters as string to the database server for parsing and execution. Later on,
       also prepared statement handling will be available which parses the statements first and sends only the
       parameters to the server before execution. This parameter is also optional.

       The returned object is representing the given statement, which can be executed later on. The statement is
       only valid for the current connection and as soon as the connection gets invalid or is closed, working
       with this object will throw an error.

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>sql</u> SQL text string containing a valid statement understood by the database server
           <u>size</u> Size of the SQL text string in bytes
           <u>type</u> Type of statement object that should be created

       <b>Returns</b>
           Statement instance bound to this connection

       Escapes potentially dangerous characters in user input using a C style buffer. For preventing SQL
       injection attacks which can have desasterous effects, all text input that will be part of an SQL
       statement must be escaped. This does also apply to user content that is already stored in the database
       and should be copied to another record or stored again as the escaping is removed before the database
       server writes the content to disk.

       The first parameter must contain the character sequence that should be escaped as C style string. This
       string itself won't be modified by this method.

       The escaped string will be written to the third parameter named <u>to</u>, which have to be also an C++ style
       string. After transforming the input to an escaped string, the result may be more then twice the size of
       the original input. The additional escape sequences aren't stored in the database column so only the
       original string will be written to the disk.

       A C++ reference of the third parameter containing the escaped string afterwards is also returned by this
       method to providing the possibility to write more elegant code.

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>from</u> Input string with which may contain dangerous characters

   <b>bool</b> <b>OpenDBX::Conn::getCapability</b> <b>(odbxcap</b> <b>cap)std::exception</b>
       Tests if the database driver module does understand certain extensions. The <b>OpenDBX</b> library consists of a
       basic set of functions that must be implemented by all drivers and optional sets for additional
       functionality. This method allows an application to ask the driver selected by the first parameter of the
       constructor of this object if it supports one or more optional sets. The available sets and its constants
       are:

       • ODBX_CAP_BASIC
          The  core  function  set  which  have  to be implemented by all backends. It consists of all functions
         necessary to connect to, send textual queries to and process simple results returned from the  database
         server as well as error handling functions.

       • ODBX_CAP_LO
          The  function  set  for  handling  large objects whose content isn't accessible by the basic function.
         Currently, Firebird/Interbase and Oracle requires using the LOB functions.

       The basic set makes sure that all drivers can handle connections to the databases,  send  statements  and
       retrieve results. It's supported by all drivers and usually don't have to be checked.

       Some  databases  client  libraries  provide  the  content  of  large objects not via the basic functions.
       Instead, the <b>Result::fieldValue()</b> method returns only a  handle  to  the  large  object  and  reading  or
       modifying the content of this data object requires calling additional methods.

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>cap</u> Constant of the capability

       <b>Returns</b>
           True if supported, false if not

       <b>Exceptions</b>
           <u>std::invalid_argument</u> If the object was only initialized by the default constructor
           <b>OpenDBX::Exception</b> <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>underlying</b> <b>database</b> <b>library</b> <b>returns</b> <b>an</b> <b>error</b>

   <b>void</b> <b>OpenDBX::Conn::getOption</b> <b>(odbxopt</b> <b>option,</b> <b>void</b> <b>*</b> <b>value)std::exception</b>
       Gets the value of a certain option provided by the database driver module. It asks the backend module for
       implemented  options  and  their current values. This function can be used at every stage and its primary
       use is to find out supported features of the backend module. This features can be enable with <b>setOption()</b>
       before the connection to the database server is established by calling <b>bind()</b>.

       There are several option values defined as named constants in the opendbx/api.h header  file.  A  few  of
       them  are for informational purpose only while most of the options can also be set to different values by
       <b>setOption()</b> to change the behavior of the backend module. These options are:

       • ODBX_OPT_API_VERSION
          The API version implemented by the backend. It returns  a  five  digit  number  representing  the  API
         version of the backend module in the form XYYZZ where X is the major number, YY the revision and ZZ the
         minor number of the API.

       • ODBX_OPT_THREAD_SAFE
          If  it is safe to use this backend and especially the native database client library in an application
         which uses threads where more than one thread opens database connections via the <b>OpenDBX</b> library.

       • ODBX_OPT_TLS
          The database client library may support transmitting all  data  securely  by  encrypting  the  network
         traffic via SSL or TLS.

       • ODBX_OPT_MULTI_STATEMENTS
          The database server may be able to support multiple SQL statements in one string sent to the database.

       • ODBX_OPT_PAGED_RESULTS
          All  database  servers  and client libraries are able to transfer the records row by row. Some of them
         can also transfer multiple rows or even all at once  to  minimize  server  load,  network  traffic  and
         latency. The downside of this is an increased memory consumption.

       • ODBX_OPT_COMPRESS
          Support  of  compressed  network  traffic  between database client and server. This can lead to higher
         throughput if the network is the bottleneck.

       • ODBX_OPT_MODE
          Some database servers support different modes of operation, e.g. modes for  compliance  to  other  SQL
         implementations or completely different query languages.

       The  parameter  <u>value</u>  must  be  a pointer to an integer variable where the backend module will store the
       result for the supplied option. If it's not stated otherwise, the value assigned to  the  this  parameter
       will  be  of  boolean  nature  and therefore is ODBX_ENABLE for a supported option or ODBX_DISABLE for an
       option which isn't supported.

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>option</u> Constant of the option
           <u>value</u> Pointer to memory where the result is stored

       <b>Exceptions</b>
           <u>std::invalid_argument</u> If the object was only initialized by the default constructor
           <b>OpenDBX::Exception</b> <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>underlying</b> <b>database</b> <b>library</b> <b>returns</b> <b>an</b> <b>error</b>

   <b>Conn</b> <b>&amp;</b> <b>OpenDBX::Conn::operator=</b> <b>(const</b> <b>Conn</b> <b>&amp;</b> <b>ref)</b>
       Assigns a connection instance to another one. Assigns the internal state of an object  <u>ref</u>  of  the  same
       type  to  this  object.  Both  objects  share  the  same  database  connection  and the reference counter
       afterwards. The reference counter is incremented each time an object is copied and will be decremented if
       it is destroyed.

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>ref</u> Connection instance

       <b>Returns</b>
           Connection reference of this instance

   <b>void</b> <b>OpenDBX::Conn::setOption</b> <b>(odbxopt</b> <b>option,</b> <b>void</b> <b>*</b> <b>value)std::exception</b>
       Sets a certain option provided by the database driver module. Changes the value of the  specified  option
       in the backend module or the native database library. Before trying to set an option, it should be tested
       with  <b>getOption()</b>  first to ensure that it is supported by the backend. Almost all options need to be set
       before connecting to the database server using <b>bind()</b> to take any effect.

       There are several option values defined as named constants in the opendbx/api.h header file. The possible
       options are:

       • ODBX_OPT_TLS
          Use encryption to transmit all data securely over the network via SSL or TLS. This option can  be  set
         to  ODBX_TLS_NEVER (the default value) to prevent encrpytion, ODBX_TLS_ALWAYS to enforce encryption and
         to fail if it can't be used between the client library and the server or ODBX_TLS_TRY to use encryption
         if possible with the option to fall back to a connection which isn't encrypted.

       • ODBX_OPT_MULTI_STATEMENTS
          Enables the database server to accept multiple statements in one string to the database if  the  value
         of  value  is  set  to  ODBX_ENABLE.  Although,  it  might  be  possible to disable it by setting it to
         ODBX_DISABLE.

       • ODBX_OPT_PAGED_RESULTS
          All database servers and client libraries are able to transfer the records row by row.  Some  of  them
         can  also  transfer  multiple  rows  or  even  all at once to minimize server load, network traffic and
         latency. The downside of this is an increased memory consumption. If paged results are supported by the
         backend, passing positive values will fetch the specified number of records at once from  the  database
         server.  The value of zero ('0') is special in this case because it asks the backend module to retrieve
         all records at once.

       • ODBX_OPT_COMPRESS
          Enable compressed network traffic between database client and server. This can maximize the throughput
         if the network is the bottleneck. Pass an integer variable with ODBX_ENABLE to  enable  compression  or
         with ODBX_DISABLE to disable it for this connection.

       • ODBX_OPT_MODE
          Some  database  servers  support  different modes of operation, e.g. modes for compliance to other SQL
         implementations or completely different query languages. The value for this option must point to a zero
         terminated string.

       If not stated otherwise, the type of the variable passed to the second parameter named <u>value</u> must  be  an
       integer pointer. Its values must be in the range specified by the option being changed.

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>option</u> Constant of the option
           <u>value</u> Pointer to memory which contains the new value

       <b>Exceptions</b>
           <u>std::invalid_argument</u> If the object was only initialized by the default constructor
           <b>OpenDBX::Exception</b> <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>underlying</b> <b>database</b> <b>library</b> <b>returns</b> <b>an</b> <b>error</b>

   <b>void</b> <b>OpenDBX::Conn::unbind</b> <b>()std::exception</b>
       Releases the connection to the database and resets the authentication status.

       <b>Exceptions</b>
           <u>std::invalid_argument</u> If the object was only initialized by the default constructor
           <b>OpenDBX::Exception</b> <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>underlying</b> <b>database</b> <b>library</b> <b>returns</b> <b>an</b> <b>error</b>
