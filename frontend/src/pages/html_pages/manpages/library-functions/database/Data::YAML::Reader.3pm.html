</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Data::YAML::Reader - Parse YAML created by Data::YAML::Writer

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This document describes Data::YAML::Reader version 0.0.7

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Data::YAML::Reader;

           my $yr = Data::YAML::Reader-&gt;new;

           # Read from an array...
           my $from_array = $yr-&gt;read( \@some_array );

           # ...an open file handle...
           my $from_handle = $yr-&gt;read( $some_file );

           # ...a string containing YAML...
           my $from_string = $yr-&gt;read( $some_string );

           # ...or a closure
           my $from_code = $yr-&gt;read( sub { return get_next_line() } );

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       In the spirit of YAML::Tiny this is a lightweight, dependency-free YAML reader. While "YAML::Tiny" is
       designed principally for working with configuration files "Data::YAML" concentrates on the transparent
       round-tripping of YAML serialized Perl data structures.

       The syntax accepted by "Data::YAML::Reader" is a subset of YAML.  Specifically it is the same subset of
       YAML that Data::YAML::Writer produces. See Data::YAML for more information.

</pre><h4><b>INTERFACE</b></h4><pre>
       "new"
           Creates and returns an empty "Data::YAML::Reader" object. No options may be passed.

       "read( $source )"
           Read YAML and return the data structure it represents. The YAML data may be supplied by a

           •   scalar string containing YAML source

           •   the handle of an open file

           •   a reference to an array of lines

           •   a code reference

           In the case of a code reference a subroutine (most likely a closure) that returns successive lines of
           YAML  must  be  supplied.  Lines  should  have  no  trailing  newline. When the YAML is exhausted the
           subroutine must return undef.

           Returns the data structure (specifically either a scalar, hash ref or array ref)  that  results  from
           decoding the YAML.

       "get_raw"
           Return the raw YAML source from the most recent "read".
