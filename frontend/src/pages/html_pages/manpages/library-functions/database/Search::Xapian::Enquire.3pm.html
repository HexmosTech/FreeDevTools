       Search::Xapian::Enquire - Make queries against a database

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This class provides an interface to the information retrieval system for the purpose of searching.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       new
       set_query
           takes  either  a  ready made Search::Xapian::Query or a scalar containing a query, which in that case
           will be passed to Search::Xapian::Query's constructor, together with any other passed arguments.

       set_query_object &lt;query&gt;
       get_query
       matches &lt;start&gt; &lt;size&gt; [&lt;check_at_least&gt;]
           Takes the start element, and maximum number of elements (and optionally the minimum number of matches
           to check), and returns an array tied to Search::Xapian::MSet::Tied.

       get_matching_terms_begin
           Returns a Search::Xapian::TermIterator, pointing to the start of the stream.

       get_matching_terms_end
           Returns a Search::Xapian::TermIterator, pointing to the end of the stream.

       set_collapse_key &lt;collapse_key&gt;
       set_docid_order &lt;order&gt;
           Set the direction in which documents are ordered by document id in the returned MSet.

           This order only has an effect on documents which would otherwise have equal  rank.   For  a  weighted
           probabilistic match with no sort value, this means documents with equal weight.  For a boolean match,
           with no sort value, this means all documents.  And if a sort value is used, this means documents with
           equal sort value (and also equal weight if ordering on relevance after the sort).

           order  can be ENQ_ASCENDING (the default, docids sort in ascending order), ENQ_DESCENDING (docds sort
           in descending order), or ENQ_DONT_CARE (docids sort in whatever  order  is  most  efficient  for  the
           backend.)

           Note:   If   you   add   documents   in   strict   date   order,   then   a  boolean  search  -  i.e.
           set_weighting_scheme(Search::Xapian::BoolWeight-&gt;<b>new()</b>) - with set_docid_order(ENQ_DESCENDING)  is  a
           very efficient way to perform "sort by date, newest first".

       set_cutoff &lt;percent_cutoff&gt; [&lt;weight_cutoff&gt;]
       set_sort_by_relevance
           Set the sorting to be by relevance only.  This is the default.

       set_sort_by_value &lt;sort_key&gt; [&lt;ascending&gt;]
           Set the sorting to be by value only.

           sort_key  - value number to reorder on.  Sorting is with a string compare.  If ascending is true (the
           default) higher is better; if ascending is false, lower is better.

           ascending - If true, document values which sort higher by string compare are better.  If  false,  the
           sort order is reversed.  (default true)

       set_sort_by_value_then_relevance &lt;sort_key&gt; [&lt;ascending&gt;]
           Set the sorting to be by value, then by relevance for documents with the same value.

           sort_key  - value number to reorder on.  Sorting is with a string compare.  If ascending is true (the
           default) higher is better; if ascending is false, lower is better.

           ascending - If true, document values which sort higher by string compare are better.  If  false,  the
           sort order is reversed.  (default true)

       set_sort_by_relevance_then_value &lt;sort_key&gt; [&lt;ascending&gt;]
           Set the sorting to be by relevance then value.

           Note that with the default BM25 weighting scheme parameters, non-identical documents will rarely have
           the  same  weight,  so  this  setting  will give very similar results to <b>set_sort_by_relevance()</b>.  It
           becomes more useful with particular BM25 parameter settings (e.g.  BM25Weight(1,0,1,0,0))  or  custom
           weighting schemes.

           sort_key  - value number to reorder on.  Sorting is with a string compare.  If ascending is true (the
           default) higher is better; if ascending is false, lower is better.

           ascending - If true, document values which sort higher by string compare are better.  If  false,  the
           sort order is reversed.  (default true)

       set_sort_by_key &lt;sorter&gt; [&lt;ascending&gt;]
           Set the sorting to be by key only.

           sorter - the functor to use to build the key.

           ascending  -  If true, keys which sort higher by string compare are better.  If false, the sort order
           is reversed.  (default true)

       set_sort_by_key_then_relevance &lt;sorter&gt; [&lt;ascending&gt;]
           Set the sorting to be by key, then by relevance for documents with the same key.

           sorter - the functor to use to build the key.

           ascending - If true, keys which sort higher by string compare are better.  If false, the  sort  order
           is reversed.  (default true)

       set_sort_by_relevance_then_key &lt;sorter&gt; [&lt;ascending&gt;]
           Set the sorting to be by relevance then key.

           sorter - the functor to use to build the key.

           ascending  -  If true, keys which sort higher by string compare are better.  If false, the sort order
           is reversed.  (default true)

       get_mset
           Get match set.

       get_eset &lt;maxitems&gt; &lt;rset&gt; [&lt;decider&gt;]
           Get set of query expansion terms.

       get_description
           Return a description of this object.

       add_matchspy &lt;spy&gt;
           Add a matchspy.

           This matchspy will be called with some of the documents which  match  the  query,  during  the  match
           process.

       clear_matchspies
           Remove all the matchspies.
