       Data::YAML - Easy YAML serialisation of Perl data structures

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This document describes Data::YAML version 0.0.7

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       In the spirit of YAML::Tiny, Data::YAML::Reader and Data::YAML::Writer provide lightweight, dependency-
       free YAML handling. While "YAML::Tiny" is designed principally for working with configuration files
       "Data::YAML" concentrates on the transparent round- tripping of YAML serialized Perl data structures.

       As an example of why this distinction matters consider that "YAML::Tiny" doesn't handle hashes with keys
       containing non-printable characters. This is fine for configuration files but likely to cause problems
       when handling arbitrary Perl data structures. "Data::YAML" handles exotic hash keys correctly.

       The syntax accepted by "Data::YAML" is a subset of YAML. Specifically it is the same subset of YAML that
       Data::YAML::Writer produces. See Data::YAML for more information.

   <b>YAML</b> <b>syntax</b>
       Although YAML appears to be a simple language the entire YAML specification is huge. "Data::YAML"
       implements a small subset of the complete syntax trading completeness for compactness and simplicity.
       This restricted syntax is known (to me at least) as 'YAMLish'.

       These examples demonstrates the full range of supported syntax.

       All YAML documents must begin with '---' and end with a line containing '...'.

           --- Simple scalar
           ...

       Unprintable characters are represented using standard escapes in double quoted strings.

           --- "\t\x01\x02\n"
           ...

       Array and hashes are represented thusly

           ---
             - "This"
             - "is"
             - "an"
             - "array"
           ...

           ---
             This: is
             a: hash
           ...

       Structures may nest arbitrarily

           ---
             -
               name: 'Hash one'
               value: 1
             -
               name: 'Hash two'
               value: 2
           ...

       Undef is a tilde

           --- ~
           ...

   <b>Uses</b>
       Use "Data::YAML" may be used any time you need to freeze and thaw Perl data structures into a human
       readable format. The output from "Data::YAML::Writer" should be readable by any YAML parser.

       "Data::YAML" was originally written to allow machine-readable diagnostic information to be passed from
       test scripts to TAP::Harness. That means that if you're writing a testing system that needs to output TAP
       version 13 or later syntax you might find "Data::YAML" useful.
