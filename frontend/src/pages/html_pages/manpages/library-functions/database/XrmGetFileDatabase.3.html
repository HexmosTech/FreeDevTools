       #include &lt;X11/Xresource.h&gt;

       XrmDatabase XrmGetFileDatabase(char *<u>filename</u>);

       void XrmPutFileDatabase(XrmDatabase <u>database</u>, _Xconst char *<u>stored_db</u>);

       XrmDatabase XrmGetStringDatabase(_Xconst char *<u>data</u>);

       const char *XrmLocaleOfDatabase(XrmDatabase <u>database</u>);

       XrmDatabase XrmGetDatabase(Display *<u>display</u>);

       void XrmSetDatabase(Display *<u>display</u>, XrmDatabase <u>database</u>);

       void XrmDestroyDatabase(XrmDatabase <u>database</u>);

</pre><h4><b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>filename</u>  Specifies the resource database file name.

       <u>database</u>  Specifies the database that is to be used.

       <u>stored_db</u> Specifies the file name for the stored database.

       <u>data</u>      Specifies the database contents using a string.

       <u>database</u>  Specifies the resource database.

       <u>display</u>   Specifies the connection to the X server.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>XrmGetFileDatabase</b> function opens the specified file, creates a new resource database, and  loads  it
       with the specifications read in from the specified file.  The specified file should contain a sequence of
       entries  in  valid  ResourceLine format (see section 15.1); the database that results from reading a file
       with incorrect syntax is implementation-dependent.  The file is parsed in the  current  locale,  and  the
       database  is  created  in  the  current locale.  If it cannot open the specified file, <b>XrmGetFileDatabase</b>
       returns NULL.

       The <b>XrmPutFileDatabase</b> function stores a copy of the specified database in the specified file.   Text  is
       written  to  the file as a sequence of entries in valid ResourceLine format (see section 15.1).  The file
       is written in the locale of the database.  Entries containing resource names that are  not  in  the  Host
       Portable Character Encoding or containing values that are not in the encoding of the database locale, are
       written in an implementation-dependent manner.  The order in which entries are written is implementation-
       dependent.  Entries with representation types other than “String” are ignored.

       The  <b>XrmGetStringDatabase</b>  function  creates  a  new  database  and stores the resources specified in the
       specified null-terminated string.  <b>XrmGetStringDatabase</b> is similar to <b>XrmGetFileDatabase</b> except  that  it
       reads  the information out of a string instead of out of a file.  The string should contain a sequence of
       entries in valid ResourceLine format (see section 15.1) terminated by a null character; the database that
       results from using a string with incorrect syntax is implementation-dependent.  The string is  parsed  in
       the current locale, and the database is created in the current locale.

       If database is NULL, <b>XrmDestroyDatabase</b> returns immediately.

       The  <b>XrmLocaleOfDatabase</b>  function  returns  the name of the locale bound to the specified database, as a
       null-terminated string.  The returned locale name string is owned by Xlib and should not be  modified  or
       freed  by  the  client.  Xlib is not permitted to free the string until the database is destroyed.  Until
       the string is freed, it will not be modified by Xlib.

       The <b>XrmGetDatabase</b> function returns the database associated with the specified display.  It returns  NULL
       if a database has not yet been set.

       The  <b>XrmSetDatabase</b>  function  associates  the  specified  resource database (or NULL) with the specified
       display.  The database previously associated with the display (if any) is not  destroyed.   A  client  or
       toolkit may find this function convenient for retaining a database once it is constructed.

</pre><h4><b>FILE</b> <b>SYNTAX</b></h4><pre>
       The syntax of a resource file is a sequence of resource lines terminated by newline characters or the end
       of the file.  The syntax of an individual resource line is:

       ResourceLine   =    Comment | IncludeFile | ResourceSpec | &lt;empty line&gt;
       Comment   =    "!" {&lt;any character except null or newline&gt;}
       IncludeFile    =    "#" WhiteSpace "include" WhiteSpace FileName WhiteSpace
       FileName  =    &lt;valid filename for operating system&gt;
       ResourceSpec   =    WhiteSpace ResourceName WhiteSpace ":" WhiteSpace Value
       ResourceName   =    [Binding] {Component Binding} ComponentName
       Binding   =    "." | "*"
       WhiteSpace     =    {&lt;space&gt; | &lt;horizontal tab&gt;}
       Component =    "?" | ComponentName
       ComponentName  =    NameChar {NameChar}
       NameChar  =    "a"-"z" | "A"-"Z" | "0"-"9" | "_" | "-"
       Value     =    {&lt;any character except null or unescaped newline&gt;}

       Elements  separated  by  vertical  bar  (|) are alternatives.  Curly braces ({...}) indicate zero or more
       repetitions of the enclosed elements.  Square brackets ([...]) indicate  that  the  enclosed  element  is
       optional.  Quotes ("...") are used around literal characters.

       IncludeFile  lines  are  interpreted  by replacing the line with the contents of the specified file.  The
       word “include” must be in lowercase.  The file name is interpreted relative to the directory of the  file
       in  which  the  line  occurs  (for example, if the file name contains no directory or contains a relative
       directory specification).

       If a ResourceName contains a contiguous sequence of two or more Binding characters, the sequence will  be
       replaced  with single “.” character if the sequence contains only “.” characters; otherwise, the sequence
       will be replaced with a single “*” character.

       A resource database never contains more than one entry for a given  ResourceName.   If  a  resource  file
       contains multiple lines with the same ResourceName, the last line in the file is used.

       Any  white  space characters before or after the name or colon in a ResourceSpec are ignored.  To allow a
       Value to begin with white space, the two-character sequence “\<u>space</u>” (backslash  followed  by  space)  is
       recognized  and  replaced by a space character, and the two-character sequence “\<u>tab</u>” (backslash followed
       by horizontal tab) is recognized and replaced by a horizontal tab character.  To allow a Value to contain
       embedded newline characters, the two-character sequence “\n” is recognized  and  replaced  by  a  newline
       character.   To  allow  a  Value  to  be  broken  across multiple lines in a text file, the two-character
       sequence “\<u>newline</u>” (backslash followed by newline) is recognized and removed from the value.  To allow a
       Value to contain arbitrary character codes, the four-character sequence “\<u>nnn</u>”, where each <u>n</u> is  a  digit
       character  in the range of “0”-“7”, is recognized and replaced with a single byte that contains the octal
       value specified by the sequence.  Finally, the two-character sequence “\\”  is  recognized  and  replaced
       with a single backslash.
