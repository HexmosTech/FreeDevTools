</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>option</b>  command  allows you to add entries to the Tk option database or to retrieve options from the
       database.  The <b>add</b> form of the command adds a new option to the database.  <u>Pattern</u>  contains  the  option
       being  specified,  and  consists  of  names and/or classes separated by asterisks or dots, in the usual X
       format (see <b>PATTERN</b> <b>FORMAT</b>).  <u>Value</u> contains a text string to associate with <u>pattern</u>;  this is the  value
       that  will be returned in calls to <b>Tk_GetOption</b> or by invocations of the <b>option</b> <b>get</b> command.  If <u>priority</u>
       is specified, it indicates the priority level for this option (see below for legal values);  it  defaults
       to <b>interactive</b>.  This command always returns an empty string.

       The <b>option</b> <b>clear</b> command clears the option database.  Default options (from the <b>RESOURCE_MANAGER</b> property
       or  the  <b>.Xdefaults</b> file) will be reloaded automatically the next time an option is added to the database
       or removed from it.  This command always returns an empty string.

       The <b>option</b> <b>get</b> command returns the value of the option specified for <u>window</u> under  <u>name</u>  and  <u>class</u>.   If
       several  entries in the option database match <u>window</u>, <u>name</u>, and <u>class</u>, then the command returns whichever
       was created with highest <u>priority</u> level.  If there are several matching  entries  at  the  same  priority
       level,  then it returns whichever entry was most recently entered into the option database.  If there are
       no matching entries, then the empty string is returned.

       The <b>readfile</b> form of the command reads <u>fileName</u>, which should have the standard format for an X  resource
       database  such as <b>.Xdefaults</b>, and adds all the options specified in that file to the option database.  If
       <u>priority</u> is specified, it indicates the priority level at which to enter the options;  <u>priority</u>  defaults
       to <b>interactive</b>.

       The file is read through a channel which is in "utf-8" encoding, invalid byte sequences are automatically
       converted  to valid ones.  This means that encodings like ISO 8859-1 or cp1252 with high probability will
       work as well, but this cannot be guaranteed.  This cannot be changed, setting the [encoding  system]  has
       no effect.

       The  <u>priority</u>  arguments  to  the  <b>option</b>  command  are  normally specified symbolically using one of the
       following values:

       <b>widgetDefault</b>3
              Level 20.  Used for default values hard-coded into widgets.

       <b>startupFile</b>
              Level 40.  Used for options specified in application-specific startup files.

       <b>userDefault</b>
              Level 60.  Used for options  specified  in  user-specific  defaults  files,  such  as  <b>.Xdefaults</b>,
              resource databases loaded into the X server, or user-specific startup files.

       <b>interactive</b>
              Level  80.   Used  for  options  specified interactively after the application starts running.  If
              <u>priority</u> is not specified, it defaults to this level.

       Any of the above keywords may be abbreviated.  In addition, priorities may be specified numerically using
       integers between 0 and 100, inclusive.  The numeric form is probably a bad idea except for  new  priority
       levels other than the ones given above.

</pre><h4><b>PATTERN</b> <b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
       Patterns  consist of a sequence of words separated by either periods, “.”, or asterisks “*”.  The overall
       pattern may also be optionally preceded by an asterisk.

       Each word in the pattern conventionally starts with either an upper-case letter (in which case it denotes
       the class of either a widget or an option) or any other character, when it denotes the name of  a  widget
       or  option.  The last word in the pattern always indicates the option; the preceding ones constrain which
       widgets that option will be looked for in.

       When two words are separated by a period, the latter widget must be a direct child of the former (or  the
       option must apply to only the indicated widgets).  When two words are separated by an asterisk, any depth
       of  widgets may lie between the former and latter widgets (and the option applies to all widgets that are
       children of the former widget).

       If the overall pattern is preceded by an asterisk, then the  overall  pattern  applies  anywhere  it  can
       throughout  the  whole  widget  hierarchy. Otherwise the first word of the pattern is matched against the
       name and class of the “<b>.</b>”  <b>toplevel</b>, which are usually set by options to <b>wish</b>.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Instruct every button in the application to have red text on it unless explicitly overridden, by  setting
       the <b>foreground</b> for the <b>Button</b> class (note that on some platforms the option is ignored):
              <b>option</b> <b>add</b> *Button.foreground red startupFile

       Allow  users  to  control  what happens in an entry widget when the Return key is pressed by specifying a
       script in the option database and add a default option for that which rings the bell:
              entry .e
              bind .e &lt;Return&gt; [<b>option</b> <b>get</b> .e returnCommand Command]
              <b>option</b> <b>add</b> *.e.returnCommand bell widgetDefault
