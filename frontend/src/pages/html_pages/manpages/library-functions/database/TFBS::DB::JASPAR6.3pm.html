</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       TFBS::DB::JASPAR6 - interface to MySQL relational database of pattern matrices. Currently status:
       experimental.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       •   creating a database object by connecting to the existing JASPAR6-type database

               my $db = TFBS::DB::JASPAR6-&gt;connect("dbi:mysql:JASPAR6:myhost",
                                                   "myusername",
                                                   "mypassword");

       •   retrieving a TFBS::Matrix::* object from the database

               # retrieving a PFM by ID
               my $pfm = $db-&gt;get_Matrix_by_ID('M0079','PFM');

               #retrieving a PWM by name
               my $pwm = $db-&gt;get_Matrix_by_name('NF-kappaB', 'PWM');

       •   retrieving a set of matrices as a TFBS::MatrixSet object according to various criteria

               # retrieving a set of PWMs from a list of IDs:
               my @IDlist = ('M0019', 'M0045', 'M0073', 'M0101');
               my $matrixset = $db-&gt;get_MatrixSet(-IDs =&gt; \@IDlist,
                                                  -matrixtype =&gt; "PWM");

               # retrieving a set of ICMs from a list of names:
                @namelist = ('p50', 'p53', 'HNF-1'. 'GATA-1', 'GATA-2', 'GATA-3');
               my $matrixset = $db-&gt;get_MatrixSet(-names =&gt; \@namelist,
                                                  -matrixtype =&gt; "ICM");

       •   creating a new JASPAR6-type database named MYJASPAR6:

               my $db = TFBS::DB::JASPAR4-&gt;create("dbi:mysql:MYJASPAR6:myhost",
                                                  "myusername",
                                                  "mypassword");

       •   storing a matrix in the database (currently only PFMs):

               #let $pfm is a TFBS::Matrix::PFM object
               $db-&gt;store_Matrix($pfm);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       TFBS::DB::JASPAR6 is a read/write database interface module that retrieves and stores TFBS::Matrix::* and
       TFBS::MatrixSet  objects  in  a relational database. The interface is nearly identical to the JASPAR2 and
       JASPAR4 interface, while the underlying data model is different

</pre><h4><b>JASPAR6</b> <b>DATA</b> <b>MODEL</b></h4><pre>
       JASPAR6 is working name for a relational database model used for storing transcriptional  factor  pattern
       matrices  in  a  MySQL  database.   It  was initially designed (JASPAR2) to store matrices for the JASPAR
       database of high quality eukaryotic transcription factor specificity profiles by Albin Sandelin and Wyeth
       W. Wasserman. Besides the profile matrix itself, this  data  model  stores  profile  ID  (unique),  name,
       structural  class,  basic taxonomic and bibliographic information as well as some additional, and custom,
       tags.

       Here goes a moore thorough description on tables and IDs

       -----------------------  ADVANCED  ---------------------------------

       For the developers and the curious, here is the JASPAR6 data model:

       MISSING TEXT HEER ON HOW IT WORKS

       It is our best intention to hide the details of this data model, which we are using on a daily  basis  in
       our work, from most TFBS users.  Most users should only know the methods to store the data and which tags
       are supported.

       The  rest  of the documentation details each of the object methods. Internal methods are preceded with an
       underscore.

   <b>new</b>
        Title   : new
        Usage   : DEPRECATED - for backward compatibility only
                  Use connect() or create() instead

   <b>connect</b>
        Title   : connect
        Usage   : my $db =
                   TFBS::DB::JASPAR6-&gt;connect("dbi:mysql:DATABASENAME:HOSTNAME",
                                               "USERNAME",
                                               "PASSWORD");
        Function: connects to the existing JASPAR6-type database and
                  returns a database object that interfaces the database
        Returns : a TFBS::DB::JASPAR6 object
        Args    : a standard database connection triplet
                  ("dbi:mysql:DATABASENAME:HOSTNAME",  "USERNAME", "PASSWORD")
                  In place of DATABASENAME, HOSTNAME, USERNAME and PASSWORD,
                  use the actual values. PASSWORD and USERNAME might be
                  optional, depending on the user's access permissions for
                  the database server.

   <b>dbh</b>
        Title   : dbh
        Usage   : my $dbh = $db-&gt;dbh();
                  $dbh-&gt;do("UPDATE matrix_data SET name='ADD1' WHERE NAME='SREBP2'");
        Function: returns the DBI database handle of the MySQL database
                  interfaced by $db; THIS IS USED FOR WRITING NEW METHODS
                  FOR DIRECT RELATIONAL DATABASE MANIPULATION - if you
                  have write access AND do not know what you are doing,
                  you can severely  corrupt the data
                  For documentation about database handle methods, see L&lt;DBI&gt;
        Returns : the database (DBI) handle of the MySQL JASPAR2-type
                  relational database associated with the TFBS::DB::JASPAR2
                  object
        Args    : none

   <b>store_Matrix</b>
        Title   : store_Matrix
        Usage   : $db-&gt;store_Matrix($matrixobject);
        Function: Stores the contents of a TFBS::Matrix::DB object in the database
        Returns : 0 on success; $@ contents on failure
                  (this is too C-like and may change in future versions)
        Args    : (PFM_object)
                  A TFBS::Matrix::PFM, FBS::Matrix::PWM or FBS::Matrix::ICM object.
                  PFM object are recommended to use, as they are eaily converted to
                  other formats
           # might have to give version and collection here
        Comment : this is an experimental method that is not 100% bulletproof;
                  use at your own risk

   <b>get_Matrix_by_ID</b>
        Title   : get_Matrix_by_ID
        Usage   : my $pfm = $db-&gt;get_Matrix_by_ID('M00034', 'PFM');
        Function: fetches matrix data under the given ID from the
                  database and returns a TFBS::Matrix::* object
        Returns : a TFBS::Matrix::* object; the exact type of the
                  object depending on what form the matrix is stored
                  in the database (PFM is default)
        Args    : (Matrix_ID)
                  Matrix_ID id is a string which refers to the stable
                  JASPAR ID (usually something like "MA0001") with
                  or without version numbers. "MA0001" will give the
                  latest version on MA0001, while "MA0001.2" will give
                  the second version, if existing. Warnings will be
                  given for non-existing matrices.

   <b>get_Matrix_by_name</b>
        Title   : get_Matrix_by_name
        Usage   : my $pfm = $db-&gt;get_Matrix_by_name('HNF-1');
        Function: fetches matrix data under the given name from the
                  database and returns a TFBS::Matrix::* object
        Returns : a TFBS::Matrix::* object; the exact type of the object
                  depending on what form the matrix object was stored in
                  the database (default PFM))
        Args    : (Matrix_name)

        Warning : According to the current JASPAR6 data model, name is
                  not necessarily a unique identifier. Also, names change
                  over time.
                  In the case where
                  there are several matrices with the same name in the
                  database, the function fetches the first one and prints
                  a warning on STDERR. You've been warned.
                  Some matrices have multiple versions. The function will
                  return the latest version. For specific versions, use
                  get_Matrix_by_ID($ID.$version)

   <b>get_MatrixSet</b>
        Title   : get_MatrixSet
        Usage   : my $matrixset = $db-&gt;get_MatrixSet(%args);
        Function: fetches matrix data under for all matrices in the database
                  matching criteria defined by the named arguments
                  and returns a TFBS::MatrixSet object
        Returns : a TFBS::MatrixSet object
        Args    : This method accepts named arguments, corresponding to arbitrary tags, and also some utility functions
                  Note that this is different from JASPAR2 and to some extent JASPAR4. As any tag is supported for
                  database storage, any tag can be used for information retrieval.
                  Additionally, arguments as 'name','class','collection' can be used (even though
                  they are not tags.
                  Per default, only the last version of the matrix is given. The only way to get older matrices out of this
                  to use an array of IDs with actual versions like MA0001.1, or set the argyment -all_versions=&gt;1, in which  case you get all versions for each stable ID

                 Examples include:
        Fundamental matrix features
               -all # gives absolutely all matrix entry, regardless of versin and collection. Only useful for backup situations and sanity checks. Takes precedence over everything else

               -ID        # a reference to an array of stable IDs (strings), with or without version, as above. tyically something like "MA0001.2" . Takes precedence over everything salve -all
        -name      # a reference to an array of
                              #  transcription factor names (string). Will only take latest version. NOT a preferred way to access since names change over time
                  -collection # a string corresponding to a JASPAR collection. Per default CORE
                  -all_versions # gives all matrix versions that fit with rest of criteria, including obsolete ones.Is off per default.
                                # Typical usage is in combiation with a stable IDs withou versions to get all versinos of a particular matrix
                 Typical tag queries:
               These can be either a string or a reference to an array of strings. If it is an arrau it will be interpreted as as an "or"s statement
                  -class    # a reference to an array of
                              #  structural class names (strings)
                  -species    # a reference to an array of
                              #   NCBI Taxonomy IDs (integers)
                  -taxgroup  # a reference to an array of
                              #  higher taxonomic categories (string)

       Computed features of the matrices            -min_ic      #  float,  minimum  total  information  content
                         #    of the matrix.       -matrixtype    #string describing type of matrix to retrieve.
       If left out, the format
                               will revert to the database format, which is PFM.

       The arguments that expect list references are used in database query formulation: elements  within  lists
       are combined with 'OR' operators, and the lists of different types with 'AND'. For example,

           my $matrixset = $db-&gt;(-class =&gt; ['TRP_CLUSTER', 'FORKHEAD'],
                                 -species =&gt; ['Homo sapiens', 'Mus musculus'],
                                 );

       gives a set of TFBS::Matrix::PFM objects (given that the matrix models are stored as such)
        whose (structural clas is 'TRP_CLUSTER' OR'FORKHEAD') AND (the species they are derived
        from is 'Homo sapiens'OR 'Mus musculus').

       As  above,  unless  IDs with version numbers are used, only one matrix per stable ID wil be returned: the
       matrix with the highest version number

       The -min_ic filter is applied after the query  in  the  sense  that  the  matrices  profiles  with  total
       information content less than specified are not included in the set.

   <b>delete_Matrix_having_ID</b>
        Title   : delete_Matrix_having_ID
        Usage   : $db-&gt;delete_Matrix_with_ID('M00045.1');
        Function: Deletes the matrix having the given ID from the database
        Returns : 0 on success; $@ contents on failure
                  (this is too C-ike and may change in future versions)
        Args    : (ID)
                  A string. Has to be a matrix ID with version suffix in JASPAR6.
        Comment : Yeah, yeah, 'delete_Matrix_having_ID' is a stupid name
                  for a method, but at least it should be obviuos what it does.
