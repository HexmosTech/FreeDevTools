</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       MPLNDM - Reads a specified EZMAP database and draws boundary lines from it, masked by a specified area
       map.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       CALL MPLNDM (FLNM,ILVL,IAMA,XCRA,YCRA,MCRA,IAAI,IAGI,NOGI,ULPR)

</pre><h4><b>C-BINDING</b> <b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;ncarg/ncargC.h&gt;

       void c_mplndm (char *flnm, int ilvl, int *iama, float *xcra, float *ycra, int mcra, int *iaai, int *iagi,
       int nogi, int (*ulpr_)(float *xcra, float *ycra, int *ncra, int *iaai, int *iagi, int *ngps))

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       FLNM        (an  input  expression  of  type  CHARACTER)  specifies  the name of the database to be used.
                   MPLNDM will first look for the files  of  the  specified  database  in  the  current  working
                   directory;  if  the files are not found there, MPLNDM will look for them in the NCAR Graphics
                   database directory.  The database created in 1998 and provided as part of Version 4.1 of NCAR
                   Graphics is named "Earth..1".

       ILVL        (an input expression of type INTEGER) specifies the level at which  the  database  is  to  be
                   used.   The  value  1  says  to  use  only  land/water  boundaries,  the  value 2 says to add
                   continental boundaries (like the boundary which separates Africa from Eurasia), the  value  3
                   says  to  add  the boundaries of countries, and the value 4 says to add states.  (The value 5
                   will eventually be used to add counties.)

       IAMA        (an input/output array of type INTEGER, dimensioned as specified  in  a  call  to  the  AREAS
                   routine  ARINAM)  is the array containing the area map against which boundary lines are to be
                   masked.  The area map must have been initialized by a call to ARINAM; it should  contain  the
                   edges  required  to  create a desired effect.  For example, an area map might be created that
                   defines a region of interest, within which user data is available and within  which  boundary
                   lines are to be drawn.

       XCRA and YCRA
                   (scratch  arrays,  dimensioned at least MCRA, of type REAL) are to be used by MPLNDM in calls
                   to the AREAS routine ARDRLN; they will eventually be used in calls to the user-provided line-
                   processing routine ULPR.

       MCRA        (an input expression of type INTEGER) is the dimension of the arrays XCRA and YCRA.

       IAAI and IAGI
                   (scratch arrays, dimensioned at least NOGI, of type INTEGER) are to  be  used  by  MPLNDM  in
                   calls to the AREAS routine ARDRLN; they will eventually be used in calls to the user-provided
                   line-processing routine ULPR. The mnemonics stand for "Integer Array of Area Identifiers" and
                   "Integer Array of Group Identifiers", respectively.

       NOGI        (an  input  expression  of  type  INTEGER)  is the dimension of the arrays IAAI and IAGI. The
                   mnemonic stands for "Number  Of  Group  Identifiers  (of  edges  in  the  area  map)",  which
                   determines the required dimension of IAAI and IAGI.

       ULPR        is the name of the user-supplied line-processing routine. It must be declared EXTERNAL in the
                   routine that calls MPLNDM, so that the compiler and loader will know that it is the name of a
                   routine  to  be  called  instead of a variable. The user routine ULPR will be called once for
                   each piece of a boundary line resulting from the masking process; it may decide to  draw  (or
                   to not draw) each such piece. ULPR will be called using a FORTRAN statement like

                        CALL ULPR (XCRA,YCRA,NCRA,IAAI,IAGI,NGPS)

                   where  XCRA and YCRA are real arrays holding the normalized device coordinates of NCRA points
                   defining a polyline which is part of some boundary line and IAAI and IAGI are integer  arrays
                   holding  NGPS  area-identifier/group-identifier pairs for the area within which that piece of
                   the line lies. In writing ULPR, the user may rely upon a SET call's having  been  done  which
                   makes  it  possible  to  use  normalized  device coordinates in calls to routines like CURVE,
                   CURVED, GPL, etc.  For more details, see the reference document for the package  named  AREAS
                   and, in particular, the description of the subroutine ARDRLN.

</pre><h4><b>C-BINDING</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The C-binding argument description is the same as the FORTRAN argument description.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       MPLNDM  is  called  to  draw the lines defined by the map database whose name is FLNM, masked against the
       area map in the array IAMA.

       MPLNDM is much like MPLNDR, except that the boundary lines are drawn using calls to  MAPITM  and  MAPIQM,
       which  does the masking of the lines against an area map and passes the pieces resulting from the masking
       process along to a user-provided line-drawing routine.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Use the ncargex command to see the following relevant example: mpex11.

</pre><h4><b>ACCESS</b></h4><pre>
       To use MPLNDM or c_mplndm, load the NCAR Graphics libraries ncarg, ncarg_gks, and ncarg_c, preferably  in
       that order.
