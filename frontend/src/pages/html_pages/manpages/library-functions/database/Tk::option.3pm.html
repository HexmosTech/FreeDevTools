       Tk::option - Using the option database in Perl/Tk

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>widgetClass</b>(<b>Name</b>=&gt;<u>name</u>, <b>-class</b>=&gt;<u>class</u>);

           <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>PathName</b>;

           <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>optionAdd</b>(<u>pattern</u>=&gt;<u>value</u>  ?,<u>priority</u>?);

           <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>optionClear</b>;

           <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>optionGet</b>(<u>name,</u> <u>class</u>);

           <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>optionReadfile</b>(<u>fileName</u> ?,<u>priority</u>?);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The option database (also known as the <u>resource</u> <u>database</u> or the <u>application</u> <u>defaults</u> <u>database</u>) is a set
       of rules for applying default options to widgets.  Users and system administrators can set up these rules
       to customize the appearance of applications without changing any application code; for example, a user
       might set up personal foreground and background colors, or a site might use fonts associated with visual
       or language preferences.  Different window managers (and implementations of them) have implemented the
       database differently, but most Xt-based window managers use the <u>.Xdefaults</u> file or the <u>xrdb</u> utility to
       manage user preferences; some use both, and/or implement a more complex set of site, user and application
       databases.  Check your site documentation for these topics or your window manager's <b>RESOURCE_MANAGER</b>
       property.

   <b>Being</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>citizen</b>
       For most applications, the option database "just works."  The <b>option...</b>  methods are for applications
       that need to do something unusual, such as add new rules or test an option's default.  Even in such
       cases, the application should provide for user preferences.  Do not hardcode widget options without a
       <b>very</b> good reason.  All users have their own tastes and they are all different.  They choose a special
       font in a special size and have often spend a lot of time working out a color scheme that they will love
       until death.  When you respect their choices they will enjoy working with your applications much more.
       Don't destroy the common look and feel of a personal desktop.

   <b>Option</b> <b>rules</b> <b>and</b> <b>widget</b> <b>identification</b>
       All widgets in an application are identified hierarchically by <u>pathname</u>, starting from the <b>MainWindow</b> and
       passing through each widget used to create the endpoint.  The path elements are <u>widget</u> <u>names</u>, much like
       the elements of a file path from the root directory to a file.  The rules in the option database are
       patterns that are matched against a widget's <u>pathname</u> to determine which defaults apply.  When a widget
       is created, the <b>Name</b> option can be used to assign the widget's name and thus create a distinctive path
       for widgets in an application.  If the <b>Name</b> option isn't given, Perl/Tk assigns a default name based on
       the type of widget; a <b>MainWindow</b>'s default name is the <b>appname</b>.  These defaults are fine for most
       widgets, so don't feel you need to find a meaningful name for every widget you create.  A widget must
       have a distinctive name to allow users to tailor its options independently of other widgets in an
       application.  For instance, to create a <b>Text</b> widget that will have special options assigned to it, give
       it a name such as:

         $text = $mw-&gt;Text(Name =&gt; 'importantText');

       You can then tailor the widget's attributes with a rule in the option database such as:

         *importantText*foreground: red

       The <u>class</u> attribute identifies groups of widgets, usually within an application but also to group similar
       widgets among different applications.  One typically assigns a class to a <b>TopLevel</b> or <b>Frame</b> so that the
       class will apply to all of that widget's children.  To extend the example, we could be more specific
       about the importantText widget by giving its frame a class:

         $frame = $mw-&gt;Frame(-class =&gt; 'Urgent');
         $text = $frame-&gt;Text(Name =&gt; 'importantText');

       Then the resource pattern can be specified as so:

         *Urgent*importantText*foreground: red

       Similarly, the pattern "*Urgent*background: cyan" would apply to all widgets in the frame.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>widgetClass</b>(<b>Name</b>=&gt;<u>name</u>, <b>-class</b>=&gt;<u>class</u>);
           Identify  a new widget with <u>name</u> and/or <u>class</u>.  <b>Name</b> specifies the path element for the widget; names
           generally begin with a lowercase letter.  <b>-class</b> specifies the class for the widget and its children;
           classes generally begin with an uppercase letter.  If not specified, Perl/Tk  will  assign  a  unique
           default  name  to each widget.  Only <b>MainWindow</b> widgets have a default class, made by uppercasing the
           first letter of the application name.

       <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>PathName</b>;
           The <b>PathName</b> method returns the widget's <u>pathname</u>, which uniquely identifies the  widget  within  the
           application.

       <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>optionAdd</b>(<u>pattern</u>=&gt;<u>value</u> ?, <u>priority</u>?);
           The <b>optionAdd</b> method adds a new option to the database.  <u>Pattern</u> contains the option being specified,
           and  consists  of  names and/or classes separated by asterisks or dots, in the usual X format.  <u>Value</u>
           contains a text string to associate with <u>pattern</u>; this is the value that will be returned in calls to
           the <b>optionGet</b> method.  If <u>priority</u> is specified, it indicates the priority level for this option (see
           below for legal values); it defaults to <b>interactive</b>. This method always returns an empty string.

       <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>optionClear</b>;
           The <b>optionClear</b> method clears the  option  database.   Default  options  (from  the  <b>RESOURCE_MANAGER</b>
           property  or  the <b>.Xdefaults</b> file) will be reloaded automatically the next time an option is added to
           the database or removed from it.  This method always returns an empty string.

       <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>optionGet</b>(<u>name,class</u>);
           The <b>optionGet</b> method returns the value of the option specified for <u>$widget</u> under <u>name</u> and <u>class</u>.   To
           look  up  the  option,  <b>optionGet</b>  matches  the  patterns  in the resource database against <u>$widget</u>'s
           <u>pathname</u> along with the class of <u>$widget</u> (or its parent if <u>$widget</u>  has  no  class  specified).   The
           widget's class and name are options set when the widget is created (not related to class in the sense
           of  bless);  the <b>MainWindow</b>'s name is the <b>appname</b> and its class is (by default) derived from the name
           of the script.

           If several entries in the option database match <u>$widget</u>'s <u>pathname</u>, <u>name</u>, and <u>class</u>, then the  method
           returns  whichever was created with highest <u>priority</u> level.  If there are several matching entries at
           the same priority level, then it returns whichever entry was <u>most</u> <u>recently</u> <u>entered</u>  into  the  option
           database.  If there are no matching entries, then the empty string is returned.

       <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>optionReadfile</b>(<u>fileName</u>?,<u>priority</u>?);
           The  <b>optionReadfile</b>  method  reads  <u>fileName</u>, which should have the standard format for an X resource
           database such as <b>.Xdefaults</b>, and adds all the options specified in that file to the option  database.
           If  <u>priority</u>  is  specified, it indicates the priority level at which to enter the options;  <u>priority</u>
           defaults to <b>interactive</b>.

           The <u>priority</u> arguments to the <b>option</b> methods are normally specified symbolically  using  one  of  the
           following values:

           <b>widgetDefault</b>
                   Level 20.  Used for default values hard-coded into widgets.

           <b>startupFile</b>
                   Level 40.  Used for options specified in application-specific startup files.

           <b>userDefault</b>
                   Level  60.   Used  for options specified in user-specific defaults files, such as <b>.Xdefaults</b>,
                   resource databases loaded into the X server, or user-specific startup files.

           <b>interactive</b>
                   Level 80.  Used for options specified interactively after the application starts running.  If
                   <u>priority</u> isn't specified, it defaults to this level.

           Any of the above keywords may be abbreviated.  In addition, priorities may be  specified  numerically
           using  integers between 0 and 100, inclusive.  The numeric form is probably a bad idea except for new
           priority levels other than the ones given above.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       The priority scheme used by core Tk is not the same as used by normal Xlib  routines.  In  particular  is
       assumes  that  the  order  of  the  entries is defined, but user commands like <b>xrdb</b> <b>-merge</b> can change the
       order.
