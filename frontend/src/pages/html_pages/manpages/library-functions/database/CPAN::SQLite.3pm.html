</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       CPAN::SQLite - maintain and search a minimal CPAN database

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 0.220

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         my $obj = CPAN::SQLite-&gt;new(CPAN =&gt; '/path/to/CPAN');
         $obj-&gt;index(setup =&gt; 1);

         $obj-&gt;query(mode =&gt; 'dist', name =&gt; 'CPAN');
         my $results = $obj-&gt;{results};

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This package is used for setting up, maintaining, and searching a CPAN database consisting of the
       information stored in the two main CPAN indices: <u>$CPAN/modules/02packages.details.txt.gz</u> and
       <u>$CPAN/authors/01mailrc.txt.gz</u>. It should be considered at an alpha stage of development.

       One begins by creating the object as

         my $obj = CPAN::SQLite-&gt;new(%args);

       which accepts the following arguments:

       •  "CPAN =&gt; '/path/to/CPAN'"

          This  specifies the path to where the index files are to be stored. This could be a local CPAN mirror,
          defined here by the presence of a <u>MIRRORED.BY</u> file beneath this directory, or  a  local  directory  in
          which  to store these files from a remote CPAN mirror. In the latter case, the index files are fetched
          from a remote CPAN mirror, using the same list that "CPAN.pm" uses, if this  is  configured,  and  are
          updated if they are more than one day old.

          If the "CPAN" option is not given, it will default to "cpan_home" of CPAN, if this is configured, with
          the  index  files  found  under  "keep_source_where".  A fatal error results if such a directory isn't
          found.  Updates to these index files are assumed here to be handled by "CPAN.pm".

       •  "db_dir =&gt; '/path/to/db/dir'"

          This specifies the path to where the database file  is  found.  If  not  given,  it  defaults  to  the
          "cpan_home"  directory  of "CPAN.pm", if present, or to the directory in which the script was invoked.
          The name of the database file is "cpandb.sql".

       There are two main methods available.

   <b>"$obj-&gt;index(%args);"</b>
       This is used to set up and maintain the database. The following arguments are accepted:

       •  setup =&gt; 1

          This specifies that the database is to be created and populated from the CPAN  indices;  any  existing
          database  will  be overwritten. Not specifying this option will assume that an existing database is to
          be updated.

       •  reindex =&gt; 'dist_name'

          This specifies that the CPAN distribution "dist_name" is to be reindexed.

   <b>"$obj-&gt;query(%args);"</b>
       This is used for querying the database by distribution name, module name, or CPAN author name. There  are
       two arguments needed to specify such queries.

       •  "mode =&gt; some_value"

          This  specifies what type of query to perform, with "mode" being one of "dist", "module", or "author",
          for searching through, respectively, CPAN distribution names, module names, or author names  and  CPAN
          ids.

       •  "type =&gt; query_term"

          This  specifies the query term for the search, with "type" being one of "name", to search for an exact
          match, or "search", for searching for partial matches. Perl regular expressions are supported  in  the
          "query_term" for the "search" option.

       As  well,  an  option  of  "max_results =&gt; some_number" will limit the number of results returned; if not
       specified, the limit doesn't apply.

</pre><h4><b>CPAN.pm</b> <b>support</b></h4><pre>
       As of CPAN.pm version 1.88_65, there is experimental support within CPAN.pm  for  using  CPAN::SQLite  to
       obtain  information on packages, modules, and authors. One goal of this is to reduce the memory footprint
       of the CPAN.pm shell, as this information is no longer all preloaded into memory.  This  can  be  enabled
       through

          perl -MCPAN -e shell
          cpan&gt; o conf use_sqlite 1

       Use

         cpan&gt; o conf commit

       to save this setting for future sessions.

       Using CPAN::SQLite, what happens is that a request for information through CPAN.pm, such as

         cpan&gt; a ANDK

       will  cause  a query to the SQLite database to be made.  If successful, this will place the relevant data
       for this request into the data structure CPAN.pm uses to store and retrieve such  information.  Thus,  at
       any  given time, the only information CPAN.pm stores in memory is that for packages, modules, and authors
       for which previous queries have been made. There are certain requests, such as

         cpan&gt; r

       to make a list of recommended packages for which upgrades on CPAN are available,  which  will  result  in
       loading information on all available packages into memory; if such a query is made, the subsequent memory
       footprint of CPAN.pm with and without CPAN::SQLite will be essentially the same.

       The   database   itself,   called   <u>cpandb.sql</u>,   will   be   stored   in   the   location  specified  by
       "$CPAN::Config-&gt;{cpan_home}".  When first started, this database will be created, and afterwards, it will
       be updated if the database is older than one day since the last update. A log file  of  the  creation  or
       update  process, called <u>cpan_search_log.dddddddddd</u>, will be created in the same directory as the database
       file.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       CPAN::SQLite::Index, for setting up  and  maintaining  the  database,  and  CPAN::SQLite::Search  for  an
       interface  to  querying  the  database.  Some  details  of  the  interaction  with CPAN is available from
       CPAN::SQLite::META. See also the cpandb script for a command-line interface to the indexing and  querying
       of the database.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       At this time, CPAN::SQLite keeps information contained only in the latest version of a CPAN distribution.
       This  means  that  modules  that  are  provided only in older versions of a CPAN distribution will not be
       present in the database; for example, at this time, the latest version of the <u>libwww-perl</u> distribution on
       CPAN is 5.805, but there are modules such as <u>URI::URL::finger</u> contained in version  5.10  of  libwww-perl
       that  are not present in 5.805.  This behaviour differs from that of CPAN without CPAN::SQLite.  This may
       change in the future.

       Please report bugs and feature requests via &lt;<a href="http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/Bugs.html">http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/Bugs.html</a>?Dist=CPAN-SQLite&gt;.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       Information messages from the indexing procedures are printed out to STDOUT if the  environment  variable
       CPAN_SQLITE_DEBUG    is    set.    This    is   automatically   set   within   CPAN::SQLite::Index.    If
       CPAN_SQLITE_NO_LOG_FILES is set, no log files will be created during the indexing procedures.  Log  files
       are  deleted  automatically  in  30  days.  To override this, set CPAN_SQLITE_LOG_FILES_CLEANUP.  To stop
       automatic cleanup, set this variable to 0.

       If CPAN_SQLITE_DOWNLOAD variable are set, an already existing and  up-to-date  cpandb.sql  file  will  be
       downloaded  from  <a href="http://cpansqlite.trouchelle.com/">http://cpansqlite.trouchelle.com/</a> where it's updated every hour. This greatly increases
       performance and decreases CPU and memory consumption during the indexing process.

       See CPAN::SQLite::Index for more details, potential problems, and more configuration options.
