       Tangram::Relational - Orthogonal Object Persistence in Relational Databases

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
          use Tangram;

          $schema = Tangram::Relational-&gt;schema( $hashref );

          Tangram::Relational-&gt;deploy($schema, $dbh);

          $storage = Tangram::Relational-&gt;connect( $schema,
             $data_source, $username, $password );

          $storage-&gt;disconnect();

          Tangram::Relational-&gt;retreat($schema, $dbh);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This is the entry point in the vanilla object-relational persistence backend. Vendor-specific backends
       should be used when they exist. Currently Mysql, Sybase and Oracle have such backends; see
       Tangram::mysql, Tangram::Sybase and Tangram::Oracle.

       More backends could be added in the future; they might implement persistence in XML documents, pure
       object databases, using C database libraries to bypass the need for an RDBMS, etc.

</pre><h4><b>CLASS</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>schema</b>
          $schema = Tangram::Relational-&gt;schema( $hashref );

       Returns a new Schema object. See Tangram::Schema.

   <b>deploy</b>
          Tangram::Relational-&gt;deploy($schema);
          Tangram::Relational-&gt;deploy($schema, HANDLE);
          Tangram::Relational-&gt;deploy($schema, @dbi_args);

       Writes SQL statements for preparing a database for use with the given $schema.

       Called with a single argument, writes SQL statements to STDOUT.

       Called with two arguments, writes SQL statements to HANDLE. HANDLE may be a DBI connection handle or a
       file handle.

       Called with more than two arguments, passes all but the first to <b>DBI::connect()</b> and writes statements to
       the resulting DBI handle, which is automatically closed.

       The SQL code is only guaranteed to work on newly created databases.

   <b>connect</b>
          $storage = Tangram::Relational-&gt;connect( $schema,
             $data_source, $user, $password, \%options )

       Connects to a storage and return a handle object. Dies in case of failure.

       $schema is a Schema object describing the system of classes stored in the database.

       $data_source, $user and $password are passed directly to <b>DBI::connect()</b>.

       \%options is a reference to a hash containing connection options. See Tangram::Storage for a description
       of available options.

   <b>retreat</b>
          Tangram::Relational-&gt;retreat($schema);
          Tangram::Relational-&gt;retreat($schema, HANDLE);
          Tangram::Relational-&gt;retreat($schema, @dbi_args);

       Remove the tables created by <b>deploy()</b>. Only guaranteed to work against a database that was deployed using
       exactly the same schema.

       For an explanation of the possible argument lists, see deploy.

</pre><h4><b>WRITING</b> <b>A</b> <b>VENDOR</b> <b>DRIVER</b></h4><pre>
       Like Charles Moore (inventor of Forth) used to say, "standards are great, everybody should have one!".

       Tangram can take advantage of extensions available in some SQL dialects.

       To create a vendor-specific driver, call it "Tangram::Foo" (where "Foo" is the name of the DBI driver, as
       would be selected with the DBI connection string "dbi:Foo:"), and derive "Tangram::Relational".

       For now, the existing back-ends should be used as examples of how to extend Tangram to support different
       databases or utilise some of their more exotic features.
