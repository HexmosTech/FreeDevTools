</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Tangram - Store pure objects in standard relational databases

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       See Tangram::Tour

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Tangram is an <u>object-relational</u> <u>mapper</u>.  It is <u>orthogonal</u>, meaning that it does not require anything of
       the objects stored in it (other than the common convention that base objects be based upon HASHes;
       individual columns can be anything).

       It consists of a <u>schema</u> <u>language</u> that can describe or be built around an object structure, or so as to
       closely match an existing SQL schema (with some limitations).  This schema language is rich enough to
       express such common RDBMS features as links, foreign keys, and link tables.

       It also consists of a <u>relational</u> <u>database</u> <u>storage</u> engine, which based on the schema structure, will make
       Perl structures persist in a relational (SQL compliant) database.  References to other objects (or
       collections, as represented with foreign keys and link tables) may be loaded using <u>on</u> <u>demand</u> <u>references</u>
       that `lazily' load data when it is needed.

       As of Tangram 2.08, the schema need not describe every single object property, so that you can map only
       the columns you intend to query.  The rest of the object is then stored in a column via a serialiser,
       like Data::Dumper, YAML or Storable.  These structures themselves may contain arbitrary references to
       other objects in storage.

       Tangram has soundly engineered transaction support, without sacrificing excellent data caching abilities.
       The general optimisation strategy of the code makes it most suited for OLTP (aka application servers) and
       other situations where it is better to select and update whole rows than to worry about which columns to
       retrieve/update or not retrieve/update.

       Once your object are persistent, you can build query expressions to find them in terms of the schema
       language that you used to put them in.  Therefore, the schema data structure does not describe a data
       structure, it describes a <u>data</u> <u>access</u> <u>pattern</u>.

       If you are not picky about which accessor module to use, preferring to specify the schema once only, then
       you can use the separately distributed Class::Tangram::Generator to make a set of classes from a Tangram
       schema structure.

       If you are looking for a tool that implements <u>SQL</u> <u>abstraction</u> only, you have probably missed the point
       (of this module, anyway), and a well-supported module like Class::DBI, or an interactive SQL modeller
       like Alzabo will likely suit your needs better.

       Tangram is beginning to include preliminary support for aggregation functions, and currently supports
       grouping, summing and counting.  Joins must currently be in terms of integer primary key columns, to
       extend past this would require extra mapping types to be developed.  Basic support for alternative join
       types is present, but in its infancy.

       Tangram currently contains no support for database-side updates (ie, "UPDATE foo SET bar = 'baz' where
       frop = 'blarg'"), but support is planned.

       There is no support for creating views based on existing classes to make new derived classes; you have to
       use your database SQL and create corresponding Tangram classes manually to do that.

       Tangram has a web site at &lt;<a href="http://tangram.utsl.gen.nz/">http://tangram.utsl.gen.nz/</a>&gt;, currently sponsored by MarketView (New Zealand)
       Ltd.

</pre><h4><b>CONTENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Tangram::Tour
           The original "Guided Tour" of the features of Tangram, by Jean-Louis Leroy.

       Tangram::Intro
           The  humble  beginnings  of a new guided tour, based on the next-generation features found in Tangram
           2.08.

       Tangram::Springfield
           The classes and schema used in the Guided Tour(s).

       Tangram::Storage
           The main database handle class.  Includes details on query syntax.

       Tangram::Cursor
           Return an iterator that retrieves persistent objects in a result set one by one.

       Tangram::Schema
           The Tangram schema structure - representing your data model so that Tangram can map it.

       Tangram::Relational::Mappings
           An  informative  text  on  exactly  how  Object   Relational   Mapping   is   accomplished   by   the
           Tangram::Relational back-end, what the different styles of mapping are, and how each is selected.

       Tangram::Type
           What  Tangram types are available.  This page is an index of other manual pages that express the data
           and relationship types available in Tangram.

       Tangram::Type::Extending
           How to write your own custom types for Tangram.

       Tangram::Dialect
           Database-specific  extensions  to  Tangram,  such  as  Tangram::mysql  and  Tangram::Sybase.    These
           extensions only add functionality, and are not required for core operation of Tangram.

</pre><h4><b>COMPATIBILITY</b></h4><pre>
       Tangram  has  been  known  to  run  in the following environments, however, Tangram uses standard SQL and
       should be usable with any SQL-83 compliant database.  Most of the requirements are  simply  avoiding  the
       worst bugs.

       Note  that  some  functions (e.g. transactions and subselects) may not be available in some environments.
       This is reported during the test suite.

       •   Perl 5.005_03+, 5.6.1+, 5.8.1+ (5.8.0 had a nasty bug and doesn't work with Tangram)

       •   Set::Object 1.04 (though the latest version is highly recommended)

       •   DBI 1.14

       •   DBD::mysql 2.0402

       •   DBD::Oracle 1.06

       •   DBD::Sybase 0.21

       •   DBD::SQLite 1.07

       •   DBD::Pg 0.93
