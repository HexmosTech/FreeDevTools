       MDOM::Token::Whitespace - Tokens representing ordinary white space

</pre><h4><b>INHERITANCE</b></h4><pre>
         MDOM::Token::Whitespace
         isa MDOM::Token
             isa MDOM::Element

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       As a full "round-trip" parser, MDOM records every last byte in a file and ensure that it is included in
       the MDOM::Document object.

       This even includes whitespace. In fact, Perl documents are seen as "floating in a sea of whitespace", and
       thus any document will contain vast quantities of "MDOM::Token::Whitespace" objects.

       For the most part, you shouldn't notice them. Or at least, you shouldn't <b>have</b> to notice them.

       This means doing things like consistently using the "S for significant" series of MDOM::Node and
       MDOM::Element methods to do things.

       If you want the nth child element, you should be using "schild" rather than "child", and likewise
       "snext_sibling", "sprevious_sibling", and so on and so forth.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       Again, for the most part you should really <b>not</b> need to do anything very significant with whitespace.

       But there are a couple of convenience methods provided, beyond those provided by the parent MDOM::Token
       and MDOM::Element classes.

   <b>null</b>
       Because MDOM sees documents as sitting on a sort of substrate made of whitespace, there are a couple of
       corner cases that get particularly nasty if they don't find whitespace in certain places.

       Imagine walking down the beach to go into the ocean, and then quite unexpectedly falling off the side of
       the planet. Well it's somewhat equivalent to that, including the whole screaming death bit.

       The "null" method is a convenience provided to get some internals out of some of these corner cases.

       Specifically it create a whitespace token that represents nothing, or at least the null string ''. It's a
       handy way to have some "whitespace" right where you need it, without having to have any actual
       characters.

   <b>tidy</b>
       "tidy" is a convenience method for removing unneeded whitespace.

       Specifically, it removes any whitespace from the end of a line.

       Note that this <b>doesn't</b> include POD, where you may well need to keep certain types of whitespace. The
       entire POD chunk lives in its own MDOM::Token::Pod object.
