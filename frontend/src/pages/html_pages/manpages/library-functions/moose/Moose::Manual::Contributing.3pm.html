</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Moose::Manual::Contributing - How to get involved in Moose

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 2.2207

</pre><h4><b>GETTING</b> <b>INVOLVED</b></h4><pre>
       Moose is an open project, and we are always willing to accept bug fixes, more tests, and documentation
       patches. Commit bits are given out freely and it's easy to get started!

   <b>Get</b> <b>the</b> <b>Code</b>
       If you just want to get your feet wet and check out the code, you can do so from the comfort of your web
       browser by going to the official repository on GitHub: &lt;https://github.com/moose/Moose&gt;.

       However, if you know how to use git and would rather have a local copy (because, why wouldn't you?!),
       then you can clone it:

           git clone <a href="mailto:git@github.com">git@github.com</a>:moose/Moose.git

       If, at some point, you think you'd like to contribute a patch, please see "Getting Started".

       <u><b>NOTE:</b></u> <u>Your</u> <u>contribution</u> <u>is</u> <u>very</u> <u>important</u> <u>to</u> <u>us.</u> <u>If,</u> <u>for</u> <u>some</u> <u>reason,</u> <u>you</u> <u>would</u> <u>prefer</u> <u>not</u> <u>to</u> <u>use</u>
       <u>Git/GitHub,</u> <u>come</u> <u>talk</u> <u>to</u> <u>us</u> <u>at</u> <u>#moose</u> <u>on</u> <u>irc.perl.org</u> <u>and</u> <u>we</u> <u>can</u> <u>work</u> <u>something</u> <u>out.</u>

   <b>People</b>
       As Moose has matured, some structure has emerged in the process.

       Cabal - people who can release moose
           These  people are the ones who have co-maint on Moose itself and can create a release. They're listed
           under "CABAL" in Moose in the Moose documentation. They are responsible for reviewing  branches,  and
           are the only people who are allowed to push to stable branches.

           Cabal    members    are    listed   in   Moose   and   can   often   be   found   on   irc   in   the
           &lt;irc://irc.perl.org/#moose-dev&gt; channel.

       Contributors - people creating a topic or branch
           You!

   <b>New</b> <b>Features</b>
       Moose already has a fairly large feature set, and we are currently <b>not</b>  looking  to  add  any  major  new
       features  to  it.  If  you have an idea for a new feature in Moose, you are encouraged to create a MooseX
       module first.

       At this stage, no new features will even be considered for addition into the  core  without  first  being
       vetted  as  a MooseX module, unless it is absolutely 100% impossible to implement the feature outside the
       core.

       If you think it is 100% impossible, please come discuss it with us on IRC or via e-mail. Your feature may
       need a small hook in the core, or a refactoring of some core modules, and we are definitely open to that.

       Moose was built from the ground up with the idea of being highly extensible, and quite often the  feature
       requests  we  see  can  be  implemented through small extensions. Try it, it's much easier than you might
       think.

   <b>Branch</b> <b>Layout</b>
       The repository is divided into several branches to make maintenance easier  for  everyone  involved.  The
       branches below are ordered by level of stability.

       stable/*
           The  branch from which releases are cut. When making a new major release, the release manager makes a
           new "stable/X.YY" branch at the current position of "master". The version used in the  stable  branch
           should not include the last two digits of the version number.

           For  minor  releases,  patches  will  be committed to "master", and backported (cherry-picked) to the
           appropriate stable branch as needed. A stable branch is only updated by someone from the Cabal during
           a release.

       master
           The main development branch. All new code should be written against this branch. This branch contains
           code that has been reviewed, and will be included in the next major release. Commits which are judged
           to not break backwards compatibility may be backported into "stable" to be included in the next minor
           release.

       topic/*
           Small personal branches that are still in  progress.  They  can  be  freely  rebased.   They  contain
           targeted  features  that  may  span a handful of commits. Any change or bugfix should be created in a
           topic branch.

       rfc/*
           Topic branches that are completed and waiting on review. A Cabal member will look  over  branches  in
           this  namespace,  and  either  merge  them to "master" if they are acceptable, or move them back to a
           different namespace otherwise.  This namespace is being phased out now that  we  are  using  GitHub's
           pull requests in our "Development Workflow".

       attic/*
           Branches  which  have  been  reviewed,  and  rejected. They remain in the repository in case we later
           change our mind, or in case parts of them are still useful.

       abandoned/*
           Topic branches which have had no activity for a long period of time will be moved here, to  keep  the
           main areas clean.

       Larger, longer term branches can also be created in the root namespace (i.e.  at the same level as master
       and  stable).  This  may  be  appropriate  if  multiple people are intending to work on the branch. These
       branches should not be rebased without checking with other developers first.

</pre><h4><b>WORKFLOWS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Getting</b> <b>Started</b>
       So, you've cloned the main Moose repository to your local machine (see "Get the Code") and  you're  ready
       to do some hacking. We couldn't be happier to welcome you to our community!

       Of  course,  to ensure that your first experience is as productive and satisfying as possible, you should
       probably take some time to  read  over  this  entire  POD  document.  Doing  so  will  give  you  a  full
       understanding  of  how  Moose  developers  and  maintainers  work  together and what they expect from one
       another. Done?  Great!

       Next, assuming you have a GitHub account, go to &lt;<a href="http://github.com/moose/Moose">http://github.com/moose/Moose</a>&gt; and <b>fork</b>  <b>the</b>  <b>repository</b>
       (see  &lt;https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo&gt;).  This  will  put  an  exact  replica  of the Moose
       repository into your GitHub account, which will serve as a place to publish your patches  for  the  Moose
       maintainers to review and incorporate.

       Once  your  fork  has  been  created,  switch  to your local working repository directory and update your
       "origin" remote's push URL. This allows you to use a single remote ("origin") to both pull in the  latest
       code from GitHub and also push your work to your own fork:

           # Replace YOUR_USERNAME below with your GitHub username
           git remote set-url --push origin <a href="mailto:git@github.com">git@github.com</a>:YOUR_USERNAME/moose.git

       You can verify your work:

           $ git remote -v
           origin  <a href="mailto:git@github.com">git@github.com</a>:moose/Moose.git (fetch)
           origin  <a href="mailto:git@github.com">git@github.com</a>:YOUR_USERNAME/moose.git (push)

       Now,  you're  ready  for action!  From now on, you just follow the "Development Workflow" to publish your
       work and <b>submit</b> <b>pull</b> <b>requests</b> to the Moose Cabal.

   <b>Development</b> <b>Workflow</b>
       The general gist of the <b>STANDARD</b> <b>WORKFLOW</b> is:

       1. Update your local repository with the latest commits from the official repository
       2. Create a new topic branch, based on the master branch
       3. Hack away
       4. Commit and push the topic branch to your forked repository
       5. Submit a pull request through GitHub for that branch

       What follows is a more detailed rundown of that workflow. Please make sure to review and follow the steps
       in the previous section, "Getting Started", if you have not done so already.

       <u>Update</u> <u>Your</u> <u>Repository</u>

       Update your local copy of the master branch from the remote:

           git checkout master
           git pull --rebase

       <u>Create</u> <u>Your</u> <u>Topic</u> <u>Branch</u>

       Now, create a new topic branch based on your master branch.  It's  useful  to  use  concise,  descriptive
       branch  names  such  as: pod-syntax-contrib, feat-autodelegation, patch-23-role-comp, etc. However, we'll
       just call ours "my-feature" for demonstration purposes:

           git checkout -b topic/my-feature

       <u>Hack.</u> <u>Commit.</u> <u>Repeat.</u>

       While you're hacking, the most important thing to remember is that your topic branch is yours to do  with
       as  you like. Nothing you do there will affect anyone else at this point. Commit as often as little or as
       often as you need to and don't let perfection get in the way of progress. However, don't try  to  do  too
       much as the easiest changes to integrate are small and focused.

       If  it's  been a while since you created your topic branch, it's often a good idea to periodically rebase
       your branch off of the upstream master to reduce your work later on:

           git fetch                   # or, git remote update
           git rebase origin/master    # or, git pull --rebase origin master

       You should also feel free to publish (using "push --force" if necessary) your branch to your GitHub  fork
       if  you  simply need feedback from others. (Note: actual collaboration takes a bit more finesse and a lot
       less "--force" however).

       <u>Clean</u> <u>Up</u> <u>Your</u> <u>Branch</u>

       Finally, when your development is done, it's time to prepare your branch for review.  Even  the  smallest
       branches  can  often  use  a  little  bit  of  tidying  up  before  they  are  unleashed  on  a reviewer.
       Clarifying/cleaning up commit messages, reordering  commits,  splitting  large  commits  or  those  which
       contain  different  types  of  changes,  squashing related or straggler commits are all <b>highly</b> worthwhile
       activities to undertake on your topic branch.

       <b>Remember:</b> Your topic branch is yours. Don't worry about rewriting its history or  breaking  fast-forward.
       Some  useful  commands are listed below but please make sure that you understand what they do as they can
       rewrite history:

           - git commit --amend
           - git rebase --interactive
           - git cherry-pick

       Ultimately, your goal in cleaning up your branch is to craft a set of commits whose content and  messages
       are  as  focused  and understandable as possible.  Doing so will greatly increase the chances of a speedy
       review and acceptance into the mainline development.

       <u>Rebase</u> <u>on</u> <u>the</u> <u>Latest</u>

       Before your final push and issuing a pull request, you need to ensure that your  changes  can  be  easily
       merged into the master branch of the upstream repository. This is done by once again rebasing your branch
       on the latest "origin/master".

           git fetch                   # or, git remote update
           git rebase origin/master    # or, git pull --rebase origin master

       <u>Publish</u> <u>and</u> <u>Pull</u> <u>Request</u>

       Now it's time to make your final push of the branch to your fork. The "--force" flag is only necessary if
       you've pushed before and subsequently rewriting your history:

           git push --force

       After   your   branch   is   published,   you   can  issue  a  pull  request  to  the  Moose  Cabal.  See
       &lt;https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests&gt; for details.

       Congratulations! You're now a contributor!

   <b>Approval</b> <b>Workflow</b>
       Moose is an open project but it is also an increasingly important one. Many modules depend on Moose being
       stable. Therefore, we have a basic set of criteria for reviewing and merging branches. What follows is  a
       set  of  rough  guidelines that ensures all new code is properly vetted before it is merged to the master
       branch.

       It should be noted that if you want your specific branch to be approved, it  is  <b>your</b>  responsibility  to
       follow this process and advocate for your branch.

       Small bug fixes, doc patches and additional passing tests.
           These  items  don't  really  require approval beyond one of the core contributors just doing a simple
           review. For especially simple patches (doc patches especially),  committing  directly  to  master  is
           fine.

       Larger bug fixes, doc additions and TODO or failing tests.
           Larger  bug  fixes  should  be  reviewed  by at least one cabal member and should be tested using the
           <u>xt/author/test-my-dependents.t</u> test.

           New documentation is always welcome, but should also be reviewed by a cabal member for accuracy.

           TODO tests are basically feature requests, see our "New Features" section  for  more  information  on
           that.  If  your feature needs core support, create a "topic/" branch using the "Development Workflow"
           and start hacking away.

           Failing tests are basically bug reports. You should find a core contributor and/or  cabal  member  to
           see  if  it is a real bug, then submit the bug and your test to the RT queue. Source control is not a
           bug reporting tool.

       New user-facing features.
           Anything that creates a new user-visible feature needs to be approved by <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> cabal member.

           Make sure you have reviewed "New Features" to be sure that you are following the guidelines.  Do  not
           be surprised if a new feature is rejected for the core.

       New internals features.
           New  features  for  Moose internals are less restrictive than user facing features, but still require
           approval by <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>one</b> cabal member.

           Ideally you will have run the <u>xt/author/test-my-dependents.t</u> script to be sure you are  not  breaking
           any  MooseX module or causing any other unforeseen havoc. If you do this (rather than make us do it),
           it will only help to hasten your branch's approval.

       Backwards incompatible changes.
           Anything that breaks backwards compatibility must be discussed by the cabal.  Backwards  incompatible
           changes should not be merged to master if there are strong objections from any cabal members.

           We  have  a policy for what we see as sane "BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY" for Moose. If your changes break
           back-compat, you must be ready to discuss and defend your change.

   <b>Release</b> <b>Workflow</b>
           # major releases (including trial releases)
           git checkout master

           # minor releases
           git checkout stable/X.YY

           # do final changelogging, etc
           git commit
           dzil release # or dzil release --trial for trial releases

       <u>Release</u> <u>How-To</u>

       Moose uses Dist::Zilla to manage releases. Although the git repository comes with a "Makefile.PL", it  is
       a  very  basic  one  just  to  allow  the basic "perl Makefile.PL &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make test" cycle to work. In
       particular, it doesn't include any release metadata, such as dependencies. In order to get  started  with
       Dist::Zilla,  first  install  it: "cpanm Dist::Zilla", and then install the plugins necessary for reading
       the "dist.ini": "dzil authordeps | cpanm".

       Moose releases fall into two categories, each with their  own  level  of  release  preparation.  A  minor
       release  is  one  which  does  not  include any API changes, deprecations, and so on. In that case, it is
       sufficient to simply test the release candidate against a few different Perls.  Testing  should  be  done
       against  at  least  two  recent  major versions of Perl (5.8.8 and 5.10.1, for example). If you have more
       versions available, you are encouraged to test them all. However, we do not put  a  lot  of  effort  into
       supporting older 5.8.x releases.

       For   major   releases   which   include   an   API   change   or   deprecation,   you   should  run  the
       <u>xt/author/test-my-dependents.t</u> test. This tests a long list of MooseX and other Moose-using modules  from
       CPAN.  In  order  to run this script, you must arrange to have the new version of Moose in Perl's include
       path. You can use "prove -b"  and  "prove  -I",  install  the  module,  or  fiddle  with  the  "PERL5LIB"
       environment variable, whatever makes you happy.

       This  test  downloads  each  module from CPAN, runs its tests, and logs failures and warnings to a set of
       files named <u>test-mydeps-$$-*.log</u>. If there are failures or warnings, please work with the authors of  the
       modules  in question to fix them. If the module author simply isn't available or does not want to fix the
       bug, it is okay to make a release.

       Regardless of whether or not a new module is available, any breakages should be noted  in  the  conflicts
       list in the distribution's <u>dist.ini</u>.

   <b>Emergency</b> <b>Bug</b> <b>Workflow</b> <b>(for</b> <b>immediate</b> <b>release)</b>
       The stable branch exists for easily making bug fix releases.

           git remote update
           git checkout -b topic/my-emergency-fix origin/master
           # hack
           git commit

       Then a cabal member merges into "master", and backports the change into "stable/X.YY":

           git checkout master
           git merge topic/my-emergency-fix
           git push
           git checkout stable/X.YY
           git cherry-pick -x master
           git push
           # release

   <b>Project</b> <b>Workflow</b>
       For  longer  lasting  branches, we use a subversion style branch layout, where master is routinely merged
       into the branch. Rebasing is allowed as long as all the branch contributors are using "git pull --rebase"
       properly.

       "commit --amend", "rebase --interactive", etc. are  not  allowed,  and  should  only  be  done  in  topic
       branches.  Committing  to  master  is  still done with the same review process as a topic branch, and the
       branch must merge as a fast forward.

       This is pretty much the way we're doing branches for large-ish things right now.

       Obviously there is no technical limitation on the  number  of  branches.  You  can  freely  create  topic
       branches  off  of  project  branches, or sub projects inside larger projects freely. Such branches should
       incorporate the name of the branch they were made off so  that  people  don't  accidentally  assume  they
       should be merged into master:

           git checkout -b my-project--topic/foo my-project

       (unfortunately Git will not allow "my-project/foo" as a branch name if "my-project" is a valid ref).

</pre><h4><b>BRANCH</b> <b>ARCHIVAL</b></h4><pre>
       Merged branches should be deleted.

       Failed branches may be kept, but should be moved to "attic/" to differentiate them from in-progress topic
       branches.

       Branches  that  have  not  been worked on for a long time will be moved to "abandoned/" periodically, but
       feel free to move the branch back to "topic/" if you want to start working on it again.

</pre><h4><b>TESTS,</b> <b>TESTS,</b> <b>TESTS</b></h4><pre>
       If you write <u>any</u> code for Moose, you <b>must</b> add tests for that code. If you do  not  write  tests  then  we
       cannot  guarantee  your  change  will  not  be removed or altered at a later date, as there is nothing to
       confirm this is desired behavior.

       If your code change/addition is deep within the bowels of Moose and your test exercises this feature in a
       non-obvious way, please add some comments either near the code in question or in the test so that  others
       know.

       We  also greatly appreciate documentation to go with your changes, and an entry in the Changes file. Make
       sure to give yourself credit! Major changes or new user-facing features  should  also  be  documented  in
       Moose::Manual::Delta.

</pre><h4><b>DOCS,</b> <b>DOCS,</b> <b>DOCS</b></h4><pre>
       Any  user-facing  changes  must  be  accompanied by documentation. If you're not comfortable writing docs
       yourself, you might be able to convince another Moose dev to help you.

       Our goal is to make sure that all features are documented. Undocumented features are not considered  part
       of the API when it comes to determining whether a change is backwards compatible.

</pre><h4><b>BACKWARDS</b> <b>COMPATIBILITY</b></h4><pre>
       Change  is  inevitable,  and  Moose  is  not  immune  to  this.  We  do  our  best  to maintain backwards
       compatibility, but we do not want the code base to become overburdened by this. This is not to  say  that
       we will be frivolous with our changes, quite the opposite, just that we are not afraid of change and will
       do our best to keep it as painless as possible for the end user.

       Our policy for handling backwards compatibility is documented in more detail in Moose::Manual::Support.

       All  backwards incompatible changes <b>must</b> be documented in Moose::Manual::Delta. Make sure to document any
       useful tips or workarounds for the change in that document.
