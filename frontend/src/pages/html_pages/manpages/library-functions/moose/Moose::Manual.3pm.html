</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Moose::Manual - What is Moose, and how do I use it?

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 2.2207

</pre><h4><b>WHAT</b> <b>IS</b> <b>MOOSE?</b></h4><pre>
       Moose is a <u>complete</u> object system for Perl 5. Consider any modern object-oriented language (which Perl 5
       definitely isn't). It provides keywords for attribute declaration, object construction, inheritance, and
       maybe more. These keywords are part of the language, and you don't care how they are implemented.

       Moose aims to do the same thing for Perl 5 OO. We can't actually create new keywords, but we do offer
       "sugar" that looks a lot like them. More importantly, with Moose, you <u>define</u> <u>your</u> <u>class</u> <u>declaratively</u>,
       without needing to know about blessed hashrefs, accessor methods, and so on.

       With Moose, you can concentrate on the <u>logical</u> structure of your classes, focusing on "what" rather than
       "how". A class definition with Moose reads like a list of very concise English sentences.

       Moose is built on top of "Class::MOP", a meta-object protocol (aka MOP). Using the MOP, Moose provides
       complete introspection for all Moose-using classes. This means you can ask classes about their
       attributes, parents, children, methods, etc., all using a well-defined API. The MOP abstracts away the
       symbol table, looking at @ISA vars, and all the other crufty Perl tricks we know and love(?).

       Moose is based in large part on the Perl 6 object system, as well as drawing on the best ideas from CLOS,
       Smalltalk, and many other languages.

</pre><h4><b>WHY</b> <b>MOOSE?</b></h4><pre>
       Moose makes Perl 5 OO both simpler and more powerful. It encapsulates Perl 5 power tools in high-level
       declarative APIs which are easy to use. Best of all, you don't need to be a wizard to use it.

       But if you want to dig about in the guts, Moose lets you do that too, by using and extending its powerful
       introspection API.

</pre><h4><b>AN</b> <b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
         package Person;

         use Moose;

         has 'first_name' =&gt; (
             is  =&gt; 'rw',
             isa =&gt; 'Str',
         );

         has 'last_name' =&gt; (
             is  =&gt; 'rw',
             isa =&gt; 'Str',
         );

         no Moose;
         __PACKAGE__-&gt;meta-&gt;make_immutable;

       This is a <u>complete</u> <u>and</u> <u>usable</u> class definition!

         package User;

         use DateTime;
         use Moose;

         extends 'Person';

         has 'password' =&gt; (
             is  =&gt; 'rw',
             isa =&gt; 'Str',
         );

         has 'last_login' =&gt; (
             is      =&gt; 'rw',
             isa     =&gt; 'DateTime',
             handles =&gt; { 'date_of_last_login' =&gt; 'date' },
         );

         sub login {
             my $self = shift;
             my $pw   = shift;

             return 0 if $pw ne $self-&gt;password;

             $self-&gt;last_login( DateTime-&gt;now() );

             return 1;
         }

         no Moose;
         __PACKAGE__-&gt;meta-&gt;make_immutable;

       When ready to instantiate your class in an application, use it in the "traditional" Perl manner:

         use User;

         my $user = User-&gt;new(
           first_name =&gt; 'Example',
           last_name  =&gt; 'User',
           password   =&gt; 'letmein',
         );

         $user-&gt;login('letmein');

         say $user-&gt;date_of_last_login;

       We'll leave the line-by-line explanation of this code to other documentation, but you can see how Moose
       reduces common OO idioms to simple declarative constructs.

</pre><h4><b>TABLE</b> <b>OF</b> <b>CONTENTS</b></h4><pre>
       This manual consists of a number of documents.

       Moose::Manual::Concepts
           Introduces Moose concepts, and contrasts them against "old school" Perl 5 OO.

       Moose::Manual::Unsweetened
           Shows two example classes, each written first with Moose and then with "plain old Perl 5".

       Moose::Manual::Classes
           How do you make use of Moose in your classes? Now that I'm a Moose, how do I subclass something?

       Moose::Manual::Attributes
           Attributes  are  a  core  part of the Moose OO system. An attribute is a piece of data that an object
           has. Moose has a lot of attribute-related features!

       Moose::Manual::Delegation
           Delegation is a powerful way to make use of attributes which are themselves objects.

       Moose::Manual::Construction
           Learn how objects are built in Moose, and in particular about the "BUILD"  and  "BUILDARGS"  methods.
           Also covers object destruction with "DEMOLISH".

       Moose::Manual::MethodModifiers
           A  method  modifier  lets you say "before calling method X, do this first", or "wrap method X in this
           code". Method modifiers are particularly handy in roles and with attribute accessors.

       Moose::Manual::Roles
           A role is something a class does (like "Debuggable" or "Printable"). Roles provide a  way  of  adding
           behavior to classes that is orthogonal to inheritance.

       Moose::Manual::Types
           Moose's type system lets you strictly define what values an attribute can contain.

       Moose::Manual::MOP
           Moose's meta API system lets you ask classes about their parents, children, methods, attributes, etc.

       Moose::Manual::MooseX
           This document describes a few of the most useful Moose extensions on CPAN.

       Moose::Manual::BestPractices
           Moose  has  a  lot  of features, and there's definitely more than one way to do it. However, we think
           that picking a subset of these features and using them consistently makes everyone's life easier.

       Moose::Manual::FAQ
           Frequently asked questions about Moose.

       Moose::Manual::Resources
           Links to various tutorials, videos, blogs, presentations, interviews, etc...

       Moose::Manual::Contributing
           Interested in hacking on Moose? Read this.

       Moose::Manual::Delta
           This document details backwards-incompatibilities and other major changes to Moose.

</pre><h4><b>JUSTIFICATION</b></h4><pre>
       If you're still asking yourself "Why do I need this?", then this section is for you.

       Another object system!?!?
           Yes, we know there are many, many ways to build objects in Perl 5, many of them based  on  inside-out
           objects  and  other such things. Moose is different because it is not a new object system for Perl 5,
           but instead an extension of the existing object system.

           Moose is built on top of Class::MOP, which is a metaclass system for Perl 5. This  means  that  Moose
           not  only  makes  building  normal Perl 5 objects better, but it also provides the power of metaclass
           programming.

       Is this for real? Or is this just an experiment?
           Moose is <u>based</u> on the prototypes and experiments Stevan did for the Perl 6 meta-model. However, Moose
           is <b>NOT</b> an experiment or prototype; it is for <b>real</b>.

       Is this ready for use in production?
           Yes.

           Moose has been used successfully in production environments by many people and companies.  There  are
           Moose  applications  which have been in production with little or no issue now for years. We consider
           it highly stable and we are committed to keeping it stable.

           Of course, in the end, you need to make this call yourself. If you have any  questions  or  concerns,
           please  feel  free to email Stevan or the <a href="mailto:moose@perl.org">moose@perl.org</a> list, or just stop by irc.perl.org#moose and
           ask away.

       Is Moose just Perl 6 in Perl 5?
           No. While Moose is very much inspired by Perl 6, it is not itself Perl 6. Instead, it is an OO system
           for Perl 5. Stevan built Moose because he was tired of writing the same old boring Perl  5  OO  code,
           and drooling over Perl 6 OO. So instead of switching to Ruby, he wrote Moose :)

       Wait, <u>post</u> modern, I thought it was just <u>modern</u>?
           Stevan read Larry Wall's talk from the 1999 Linux World entitled "Perl, the first postmodern computer
           language"  in  which  he talks about how he picked the features for Perl because he thought they were
           cool and he threw out the ones that he thought sucked. This got him thinking about how we  have  done
           the  same thing in Moose. For Moose, we have "borrowed" features from Perl 6, CLOS (LISP), Smalltalk,
           Java, BETA, OCaml, Ruby and more, and the bits we didn't like (cause they sucked) we tossed aside. So
           for this reason (and a few others) Stevan has re-dubbed Moose a <u>postmodern</u> object system.

           Nuff Said.
