       Moose::Cookbook - How to cook a Moose

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 2.2207

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The Moose cookbook is a series of recipes showing various Moose features. Most recipes present some code
       demonstrating some feature, and then explain the details of the code.

       You should probably read the Moose::Manual first. The manual explains Moose concepts without being too
       code-heavy.

</pre><h4><b>RECIPES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Basic</b> <b>Moose</b>
       These recipes will give you a good overview of Moose's capabilities, starting with simple attribute
       declaration, and moving on to more powerful features like laziness, types, type coercion, method
       modifiers, and more.

       Moose::Cookbook::Basics::Point_AttributesAndSubclassing
           A simple Moose-based class. Demonstrates basic Moose attributes and subclassing.

       Moose::Cookbook::Basics::BankAccount_MethodModifiersAndSubclassing
           A slightly more complex Moose class. Demonstrates using a method modifier in a subclass.

       Moose::Cookbook::Basics::BinaryTree_AttributeFeatures
           Demonstrates  several  attribute  features,  including types, weak references, predicates ("does this
           object have a foo?"), defaults, laziness, and triggers.

       Moose::Cookbook::Basics::Company_Subtypes
           Introduces the creation and use of custom types, a "BUILD" method, and the use  of  "override"  in  a
           subclass. This recipe also shows how to model a set of classes that could be used to model companies,
           people, employees, etc.

       Moose::Cookbook::Basics::HTTP_SubtypesAndCoercion
           This recipe covers more subtype creation, including the use of type coercions.

       Moose::Cookbook::Basics::Immutable
           Making a class immutable greatly increases the speed of accessors and object construction.

       Moose::Cookbook::Basics::BinaryTree_BuilderAndLazyBuild - Builder methods and lazy_build
           The  builder  feature  provides an inheritable and role-composable way to provide a default attribute
           value.

       Moose::Cookbook::Basics::Genome_OverloadingSubtypesAndCoercion
           Demonstrates using operator overloading, coercion, and subtypes to model how eye color is  determined
           during reproduction.

       Moose::Cookbook::Basics::Person_BUILDARGSAndBUILD
           This recipe demonstrates the use of "BUILDARGS" and "BUILD" to hook into object construction.

       Moose::Cookbook::Basics::DateTime_ExtendingNonMooseParent
           In this recipe, we make a Moose-based subclass of DateTime, a module which does not use Moose itself.

       Moose::Cookbook::Basics::Document_AugmentAndInner
           Demonstrates  the  use  of  "augment"  method modifiers, a way of turning the usual method overriding
           style "inside-out".

   <b>Moose</b> <b>Roles</b>
       These recipes will show you how to use Moose roles.

       Moose::Cookbook::Roles::Comparable_CodeReuse
           Demonstrates roles, which are also sometimes known as traits or mix-ins. Roles provide  a  method  of
           code re-use which is orthogonal to subclassing.

       Moose::Cookbook::Roles::Restartable_AdvancedComposition
           Sometimes  you  just  want to include part of a role in your class. Sometimes you want the whole role
           but one of its methods conflicts with one in your class. With method exclusion and aliasing, you  can
           work around these problems.

       Moose::Cookbook::Roles::ApplicationToInstance
           In this recipe, we apply a role to an existing object instance.

   <b>Meta</b> <b>Moose</b>
       These  recipes  show  you  how  to  write  your own meta classes, which lets you extend the object system
       provided by Moose.

       Moose::Cookbook::Meta::WhyMeta
           If you're wondering what all this "meta" stuff is, and why  you  should  care  about  it,  read  this
           "recipe".

       Moose::Cookbook::Meta::Labeled_AttributeTrait
           Extending  Moose's  attribute  metaclass is a great way to add functionality. However, attributes can
           only have one metaclass.  Applying roles to the  attribute  metaclass  lets  you  provide  composable
           attribute functionality.

       Moose::Cookbook::Meta::Table_MetaclassTrait
           This  recipe  takes  the  class  metaclass  we  saw  in  the previous recipe and reimplements it as a
           metaclass trait.

       Moose::Cookbook::Meta::PrivateOrPublic_MethodMetaclass
           This recipe shows a custom method metaclass that implements making a method private.

       Moose::Cookbook::Meta::GlobRef_InstanceMetaclass
           This recipe shows an example of how you  create  your  own  meta-instance  class.  The  meta-instance
           determines the internal structure of object instances and provide access to attribute slots.

           In  this  particular  instance,  we use a blessed glob reference as the instance instead of a blessed
           hash reference.

       Hooking into immutabilization (TODO)
           Moose has a feature known as "immutabilization". By  calling  "__PACKAGE__-&gt;meta()-&gt;make_immutable()"
           after  defining  your  class  (attributes, roles, etc), you tell Moose to optimize things like object
           creation, attribute access, and so on.

           If you are creating your own metaclasses, you may need to hook into the immutabilization system. This
           cuts across a number of spots, including the metaclass class, meta method classes, and  possibly  the
           meta-instance class as well.

           This recipe shows you how to write extensions which immutabilize properly.

   <b>Extending</b> <b>Moose</b>
       These  recipes  cover  some  more  ways to extend Moose, and will be useful if you plan to write your own
       "MooseX" module.

       Moose::Cookbook::Extending::ExtensionOverview
           There are quite a few ways to extend Moose. This recipe provides an  overview  of  each  method,  and
           provides recommendations for when each is appropriate.

       Moose::Cookbook::Extending::Debugging_BaseClassRole
           Many  base  object  class extensions can be implemented as roles. This example shows how to provide a
           base  object  class  debugging  role  that  is  applied  to  any   class   that   uses   a   notional
           "MooseX::Debugging" module.

       Moose::Cookbook::Extending::Mooseish_MooseSugar
           This recipe shows how to provide a replacement for "Moose.pm". You may want to do this as part of the
           API  for a "MooseX" module, especially if you want to default to a new metaclass class or base object
           class.
