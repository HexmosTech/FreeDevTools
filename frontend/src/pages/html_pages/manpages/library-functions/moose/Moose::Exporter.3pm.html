</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module encapsulates the exporting of sugar functions in a "Moose.pm"-like manner. It does this by
       building custom "import" and "unimport" methods for your module, based on a spec you provide.

       It also lets you "stack" Moose-alike modules so you can export Moose's sugar as well as your own, along
       with sugar from any random "MooseX" module, as long as they all use "Moose::Exporter". This feature
       exists to let you bundle a set of MooseX modules into a policy module that developers can use directly
       instead of using Moose itself.

       To simplify writing exporter modules, "Moose::Exporter" also imports "strict" and "warnings" into your
       exporter module, as well as into modules that use it.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       This module provides two public methods:

   <b>Moose::Exporter-&gt;setup_import_methods(...)</b>
       When you call this method, "Moose::Exporter" builds custom "import" and "unimport" methods for your
       module. The "import" method will export the functions you specify, and can also re-export functions
       exported by some other module (like "Moose.pm"). If you pass any parameters for Moose::Util::MetaRole,
       the "import" method will also call Moose::Util::MetaRole::apply_metaroles and
       Moose::Util::MetaRole::apply_base_class_roles as needed, after making sure the metaclass is initialized.

       The "unimport" method cleans the caller's namespace of all the exported functions. This includes any
       functions you re-export from other packages. However, if the consumer of your package also imports those
       functions from the original package, they will <u>not</u> be cleaned.

       Note that if any of these methods already exist, they will not be overridden, you will have to use
       "build_import_methods" to get the coderef that would be installed.

       This method accepts the following parameters:

       •   with_meta =&gt; [ ... ]

           This  list  of  function  <u>names</u>  <u>only</u>  will  be  wrapped and then exported. The wrapper will pass the
           metaclass object for the caller as its first argument.

           Many sugar functions will need to use this metaclass object to do something to the calling package.

       •   as_is =&gt; [ ... ]

           This list of function names or sub references will be exported as-is. You can identify  a  subroutine
           by  reference,  which  is  handy  to  re-export  some  other module's functions directly by reference
           ("\&amp;Some::Package::function").

           If you do export some other package's function, this function will never be removed by the "unimport"
           method. The reason for this is we cannot  know  if  the  caller  <u>also</u>  explicitly  imported  the  sub
           themselves, and therefore wants to keep it.

       •   trait_aliases =&gt; [ ... ]

           This  is  a  list  of  package  names  which  should  have shortened aliases exported, similar to the
           functionality of aliased. Each element in the list can be either a package name, in  which  case  the
           export  will  be  named  as  the last namespace component of the package, or an arrayref, whose first
           element is the package to alias to, and second element is the alias to export.

       •   also =&gt; $name or \@names

           This is a list of modules which contain functions that the caller wants to export. These modules must
           also use "Moose::Exporter". The most common use case will be to export the functions from "Moose.pm".
           Functions specified by "with_meta" or "as_is" take precedence  over  functions  exported  by  modules
           specified by "also", so that a module can selectively override functions exported by another module.

           "Moose::Exporter" also makes sure all these functions get removed when "unimport" is called.

       •   meta_lookup =&gt; sub { ... }

           This is a function which will be called to provide the metaclass to be operated upon by the exporter.
           This  is  an  advanced  feature  intended  for  use  by  package  generator  modules  in  the vein of
           MooseX::Role::Parameterized  in  order  to  simplify  reusing  sugar  from  other  modules  that  use
           "Moose::Exporter".  This  function is used, for example, to select the metaclass to bind to functions
           that are exported using the "with_meta" option.

           This function will receive one parameter: the class name into which the sugar is being exported.  The
           default implementation is:

               sub { Class::MOP::class_of(shift) }

           Accordingly, this function is expected to return a metaclass.

       You     can     also     provide     parameters     for     Moose::Util::MetaRole::apply_metaroles    and
       Moose::Util::MetaRole::apply_base_class_roles.  Specifically,  valid  parameters  are  "class_metaroles",
       "role_metaroles", and "base_class_roles".

   <b>Moose::Exporter-&gt;build_import_methods(...)</b>
       Returns three code refs, one for "import", one for "unimport" and one for "init_meta".

       Accepts  the  additional "install" option, which accepts an arrayref of method names to install into your
       exporting package. The valid options are  "import"  and  "unimport".  Calling  "setup_import_methods"  is
       equivalent  to  calling  "build_import_methods"  with  "install  =&gt; [qw(import unimport)]" except that it
       doesn't also return the methods.

       The "import" method is built using Sub::Exporter. This means that it can take a hashref of  the  form  "{
       into =&gt; $package }" to specify the package it operates on.

       Used by "setup_import_methods".

</pre><h4><b>IMPORTING</b> <b>AND</b> <b>init_meta</b></h4><pre>
       If you want to set an alternative base object class or metaclass class, see above for details on how this
       module can call Moose::Util::MetaRole for you.

       If  you want to do something that is not supported by this module, simply define an "init_meta" method in
       your class. The "import" method that "Moose::Exporter" generates for you will call  this  method  (if  it
       exists). It will always pass the caller to this method via the "for_class" parameter.

       Most of the time, your "init_meta" method will probably just call "Moose-&gt;init_meta" to do the real work:

         sub init_meta {
             shift; # our class name
             return Moose-&gt;init_meta( @_, metaclass =&gt; 'My::Metaclass' );
         }

</pre><h4><b>METACLASS</b> <b>TRAITS</b></h4><pre>
       The  "import"  method  generated  by  "Moose::Exporter"  will  allow  the  user of your module to specify
       metaclass traits in a "-traits" parameter passed as part of the import:

         use Moose -traits =&gt; 'My::Meta::Trait';

         use Moose -traits =&gt; [ 'My::Meta::Trait', 'My::Other::Trait' ];

       These traits will be applied to the caller's metaclass instance. Providing traits for an exporting  class
       that does not create a metaclass for the caller is an error.
