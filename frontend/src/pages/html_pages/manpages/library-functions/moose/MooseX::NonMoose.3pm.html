</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       "MooseX::NonMoose" allows for easily subclassing non-Moose classes with Moose, taking care of the
       annoying details connected with doing this, such as setting up proper inheritance from Moose::Object and
       installing (and inlining, at "make_immutable" time) a constructor that makes sure things like "BUILD"
       methods are called. It tries to be as non-intrusive as possible - when this module is used, inheriting
       from non-Moose classes and inheriting from Moose classes should work identically, aside from the few
       caveats mentioned below.  One of the goals of this module is that including it in a Moose::Exporter-based
       package used across an entire application should be possible, without interfering with classes that only
       inherit from Moose modules, or even classes that don't inherit from anything at all.

       There are several ways to use this module. The most straightforward is to just "use MooseX::NonMoose;" in
       your class; this should set up everything necessary for extending non-Moose modules.
       MooseX::NonMoose::Meta::Role::Class and MooseX::NonMoose::Meta::Role::Constructor can also be applied to
       your metaclasses manually, either by passing a "-traits" option to your "use Moose;" line, or by applying
       them using Moose::Util::MetaRole in a Moose::Exporter-based package. MooseX::NonMoose::Meta::Role::Class
       is the part that provides the main functionality of this module; if you don't care about inlining, this
       is all you need to worry about. Applying MooseX::NonMoose::Meta::Role::Constructor as well will provide
       an inlined constructor when you immutabilize your class.

       "MooseX::NonMoose" allows you to manipulate the argument list that gets passed to the superclass
       constructor by defining a "FOREIGNBUILDARGS" method. This is called with the same argument list as the
       "BUILDARGS" method, but should return a list of arguments to pass to the superclass constructor. This
       allows "MooseX::NonMoose" to support superclasses whose constructors would get confused by the extra
       arguments that Moose requires (for attributes, etc.)

       Not all non-Moose classes use "new" as the name of their constructor. This module allows you to extend
       these classes by explicitly stating which method is the constructor, during the call to "extends". The
       syntax looks like this:

         extends 'Foo' =&gt; { -constructor_name =&gt; 'create' };

       similar to how you can already pass "-version" in the "extends" call in a similar way.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS/CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
       •   The  reference  that  the non-Moose class uses as its instance type <b>must</b> match the instance type that
           Moose is using. Moose's default instance type is a hashref, but other modules exist to make Moose use
           other instance types. MooseX::InsideOut is the most general solution - it should work with any class.
           For globref-based classes in particular, MooseX::GlobRef will also allow  Moose  to  work.  For  more
           information, see the "032-moosex-insideout" and "033-moosex-globref" tests bundled with this dist.

       •   Modifying  your class' @ISA after an initial "extends" call will potentially cause problems if any of
           those new entries in the @ISA override the constructor.  "MooseX::NonMoose" wraps the  nearest  new()
           method  at  the  time  "extends"  is  called  and  will  not  see any other new() methods in the @ISA
           hierarchy.

       •   Completely overriding the constructor in a class using "MooseX::NonMoose" (i.e. using "sub new {  ...
           }")  currently  doesn't  work,  although  using  method  modifiers  on  the  constructor  should work
           identically to normal Moose classes.
