       • <b>ierror</b> : Fortran only: Error status (integer).

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>MPI_Cancel</u>  operation  allows  pending communications to be canceled.  This is required for cleanup.
       Posting a send or a receive ties up user resources (send or receive buffers), and a cancel may be  needed
       to free these resources gracefully.

       A  call  to  <u>MPI_Cancel</u>  marks  for  cancellation a pending, nonblocking communication operation (send or
       receive). The cancel call is local. It returns immediately, possibly before the communication is actually
       canceled. It is still necessary to complete a communication that has been marked for cancellation,  using
       a call to <u>MPI_Request_free</u>, <u>MPI_Wait</u>, or <u>MPI_Test</u> (or any of the derived operations).

       If a communication is marked for cancellation, then an <u>MPI_Wait</u> call for that communication is guaranteed
       to  return,  irrespective  of  the  activities  of  other  processes  (i.e.,  <u>MPI_Wait</u> behaves as a local
       function); similarly if <u>MPI_Test</u> is repeatedly called in a busy wait loop for a  canceled  communication,
       then <u>MPI_Test</u> will eventually be successful.

       <u>MPI_Cancel</u> can be used to cancel a communication that uses a persistent request (see Section 3.9 in the ‐
       <u>MPI</u> <u>Standard</u>, “Persistent Communication Requests”) in the same way it is used for nonpersistent requests.
       A successful cancellation cancels the active communication, but not the request itself. After the call to
       <u>MPI_Cancel</u>  and  the  subsequent  call  to  <u>MPI_Wait</u> or <u>MPI_Test</u>, the request becomes inactive and can be
       activated for a new communication.

       The successful cancellation of a buffered send frees the buffer space occupied by the pending message.

       Either the cancellation succeeds or the communication succeeds, but not both. If a  send  is  marked  for
       cancellation, then it must be the case that either the send completes normally, in which case the message
       sent  is received at the destination process, or that the send is successfully canceled, in which case no
       part of the message is received at the destination. Then, any matching receive has  to  be  satisfied  by
       another  send.  If a receive is marked for cancellation, then it must be the case that either the receive
       completes normally, or that the receive is successfully canceled, in which case no part  of  the  receive
       buffer is altered. Then, any matching send has to be satisfied by another receive.

       If  the  operation  has  been  canceled,  then  information to that effect will be returned in the status
       argument of the operation that completes the communication.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       The primary expected use of <u>MPI_Cancel</u> is in multi-buffering schemes, where  speculative  MPI_Irecvs  are
       made. When the computation completes, some of these requests may remain; using <u>MPI_Cancel</u> allows the user
       to cancel these unsatisfied requests.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       Almost  all  MPI  routines  return  an  error  value; C routines as the return result of the function and
       Fortran routines in the last argument.

       Before the error value is returned, the current MPI  error  handler  associated  with  the  communication
       object  (e.g.,  communicator, window, file) is called.  If no communication object is associated with the
       MPI call, then the call is considered attached to MPI_COMM_SELF and will call the  associated  MPI  error
       handler.   When   MPI_COMM_SELF   is   not  initialized  (i.e.,  before  <u>MPI_Init</u>/<u>MPI_Init_thread</u>,  after
       <u>MPI_Finalize</u>, or when using the Sessions Model exclusively) the error raises the initial  error  handler.
       The  initial  error handler can be changed by calling <u>MPI_Comm_set_errhandler</u> on MPI_COMM_SELF when using
       the World model, or the mpi_initial_errhandler CLI argument to mpiexec or info  key  to  <u>MPI_Comm_spawn</u>/‐
       <u>MPI_Comm_spawn_multiple</u>.   If no other appropriate error handler has been set, then the MPI_ERRORS_RETURN
       error handler is called for MPI I/O functions and the MPI_ERRORS_ABORT error handler is  called  for  all
       other MPI functions.

       Open MPI includes three predefined error handlers that can be used:

       • <b>MPI_ERRORS_ARE_FATAL</b> Causes the program to abort all connected MPI processes.

       • <b>MPI_ERRORS_ABORT</b> An error handler that can be invoked on a communicator, window, file, or session. When
         called  on  a  communicator,  it  acts  as if <u>MPI_Abort</u> was called on that communicator. If called on a
         window or file, acts as if <u>MPI_Abort</u> was called on a communicator containing the group of processes  in
         the corresponding window or file. If called on a session, aborts only the local process.

       • <b>MPI_ERRORS_RETURN</b> Returns an error code to the application.

       MPI applications can also implement their own error handlers by calling:

       • <u>MPI_Comm_create_errhandler</u> then <u>MPI_Comm_set_errhandler</u>

       • <u>MPI_File_create_errhandler</u> then <u>MPI_File_set_errhandler</u>

       • <u>MPI_Session_create_errhandler</u> then <u>MPI_Session_set_errhandler</u> or at <u>MPI_Session_init</u>

       • <u>MPI_Win_create_errhandler</u> then <u>MPI_Win_set_errhandler</u>

       Note that MPI does not guarantee that an MPI program can continue past an error.

       See the <u>MPI</u> <u>man</u> <u>page</u> for a full list of <u>MPI</u> <u>error</u> <u>codes</u>.

       See the Error Handling section of the MPI-3.1 standard for more information.
