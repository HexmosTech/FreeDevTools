</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       AGPWRT - Provides a way for the user to change the style of all text strings drawn by Autograph.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       SUBROUTINE AGPWRT (XPOS,YPOS,CHRS,NCHS,ISIZ,IORI,ICEN)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       XPOS        (an  input expression of type REAL) is the X coordinate of a point relative to which the text
                   string is to be positioned.

       YPOS        (an input expression of type REAL) is the Y coordinate of a point relative to which the  text
                   string is to be positioned.

       CHRS        (an input expression of type CHARACTER) is the text string to be drawn.

       NCHS        (an input expression of type INTEGER) is the length of CHRS - the number of characters in the
                   text string.

       ISIZ        (an  input  expression  of type INTEGER) specifies the size of the characters to be used. The
                   values 0, 1, 2,  and  3  imply  character  widths  of  8,  12,  16,  and  24  plotter  units,
                   respectively. Larger values specify the character width directly.

       IORI        (an  input  expression of type INTEGER) is the orientation angle of the text string, measured
                   in degrees counter-clockwise from a vector which is horizontal and pointing to the right.

       ICEN        (an input expression of type INTEGER) is the centering option. The value  "-1"  implies  that
                   the  text  is  to  be written with (XPOS,YPOS) in the center of the left edge of the leftmost
                   character, the value "0" that (XPOS,YPOS) is to be in the center of the  entire  string,  and
                   the  value  "+1"  that  (XPOS,YPOS) is to be in the center of the right edge of the rightmost
                   character.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       This routine is not called by the user program, but by Autograph itself, to draw a numeric  label  or  an
       informational label on the graph. The default version just calls the plot-package routine PWRIT. The user
       may supply a replacement version.

       Note:  A user version of AGPWRT should not call any other Autograph routine.

</pre><h4><b>ACCESS</b></h4><pre>
       To use AGPWRT, load the NCAR Graphics libraries ncarg, ncarg_gks, and ncarg_c, preferably in that order.
