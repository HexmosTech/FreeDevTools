</pre><h4><b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Tk_Font <u>tkfont</u> (in)                Token  for  font  in which text is to be drawn or measured.  Must have
                                          been returned by a previous call to <b>Tk_GetFont</b>.

       const char <u>*string</u> (in)            Text to be measured or displayed.  Need not be null  terminated.   Any
                                          non-printing  meta-characters  in  the string (such as tabs, newlines,
                                          and other control characters) will  be  measured  or  displayed  in  a
                                          platform-dependent manner.

       Tcl_Size <u>numBytes</u> (in)             The  maximum  number  of  bytes  to consider when measuring or drawing
                                          <u>string</u>.  Must be greater than or equal to 0.

       int <u>maxPixels</u> (in)                 If <u>maxPixels</u> is &gt;= 0, it specifies the longest permissible line length
                                          in pixels.  Characters from <u>string</u> are processed only until this  many
                                          pixels  have  been covered.  If <u>maxPixels</u> is &lt; 0, then the line length
                                          is unbounded and the <u>flags</u> argument is ignored.

       int <u>flags</u> (in)                     Various flag  bits  OR-ed  together:  <b>TK_PARTIAL_OK</b>  means  include  a
                                          character  as  long  as  any  part  of  it fits in the length given by
                                          <u>maxPixels</u>;  otherwise,  a  character  must  fit   completely   to   be
                                          considered.    <b>TK_WHOLE_WORDS</b>  means  stop  on  a  word  boundary,  if
                                          possible.  If <b>TK_AT_LEAST_ONE</b> is set, it means  return  at  least  one
                                          character  even  if  no  characters  could  fit in the length given by
                                          <u>maxPixels</u>.  If <b>TK_AT_LEAST_ONE</b> is set and <b>TK_WHOLE_WORDS</b> is also  set,
                                          it  means that if not even one word fits on the line, return the first
                                          few letters of the word that did fit; if not even one  letter  of  the
                                          word   fit,   then   the   first   letter   will  still  be  returned.
                                          <b>TK_ISOLATE_END</b> means that the last character should not be  considered
                                          in  context with the rest of the string (used for breaking lines, with
                                          the Tk_*InContext variants of the functions only).

       int <u>*lengthPtr</u> (out)               Filled with the number of pixels occupied by the number of  characters
                                          returned as the result of <b>Tk_MeasureChars</b>.

       Display <u>*display</u> (in)              Display on which to draw.

       Drawable <u>drawable</u> (in)             Window or pixmap in which to draw.

       GC <u>gc</u> (in)                         Graphics  context for drawing characters.  The font selected into this
                                          GC must be the same as the <u>tkfont</u>.

       int <u>x,</u> <u>y</u> (in)                      Coordinates at which to place the  left  edge  of  the  baseline  when
                                          displaying <u>string</u>.

       int <u>firstByte</u> (in)                 The index of the first byte of the first character to underline in the
                                          <u>string</u>.  Underlining begins at the left edge of this character.

       int <u>lastByte</u> (in)                  The  index  of  the  first  byte of the last character up to which the
                                          underline will be drawn.  The character specified by <u>lastByte</u> will not
                                          itself be underlined.

       Tcl_Size <u>rangeStart</u> (in)           Index of first byte to draw or to measure.

       Tcl_Size <u>rangeLength</u> (in)          Length of range to draw or to measure, in bytes.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       These routines are for measuring and displaying simple single-font, single-line strings.  To measure  and
       display  single-font,  multi-line,  justified  text, refer to the documentation for <b>Tk_ComputeTextLayout</b>.
       There is no programming interface in the core of Tk that supports multi-font,  multi-line  text;  support
       for  that  behavior  must be built on top of simpler layers.  Note that the interfaces described here are
       byte-oriented not character-oriented, so index values coming from Tcl scripts need  to  be  converted  to
       byte offsets using the <b>Tcl_UtfAtIndex</b> and related routines.

       A glyph is the displayable picture of a letter, number, or some other symbol.  Not all character codes in
       a  given  font have a glyph.  Characters such as tabs, newlines/returns, and control characters that have
       no glyph are measured and displayed by these procedures in a platform-dependent manner; under X, they are
       replaced with backslashed escape sequences, while under Windows and Macintosh hollow or solid  boxes  may
       be  substituted.   Refer  to  the documentation for <b>Tk_ComputeTextLayout</b> for a programming interface that
       supports the platform-independent expansion of tab characters  into  columns  and  newlines/returns  into
       multi-line text.

       <b>Tk_MeasureChars</b>  is  used both to compute the length of a given string and to compute how many characters
       from a string fit in a given amount of space.  The return value is the number of bytes from  <u>string</u>  that
       fit  in the space specified by <u>maxPixels</u> subject to the conditions described by <u>flags</u>.  If all characters
       fit, the return value will be <u>numBytes</u>.  <u>*lengthPtr</u> is filled with the computed width, in pixels, of  the
       portion  of  the  string  that  was  measured.  For example, if the return value is 5, then <u>*lengthPtr</u> is
       filled with the distance between the left edge of <u>string</u>[0] and the right edge of <u>string</u>[4].

       <b>Tk_TextWidth</b> is a wrapper function that provides a simpler interface  to  the  <b>Tk_MeasureChars</b>  function.
       The return value is how much space in pixels the given <u>string</u> needs.

       <b>Tk_DrawChars</b> draws the <u>string</u> at the given location in the given <u>drawable</u>.

       <b>Tk_UnderlineChars</b>  underlines  the  given  range of characters in the given <u>string</u>.  It does not draw the
       characters (which are assumed to have been displayed previously  by  <b>Tk_DrawChars</b>);  it  just  draws  the
       underline.   This  procedure  is  used  to  underline  a  few  characters  without having to construct an
       underlined font.  To produce  natively  underlined  text,  the  appropriate  underlined  font  should  be
       constructed and used.

       <b>Tk_MeasureCharsInContext</b>,  <b>Tk_DrawCharsInContext</b>, <b>Tk_UnderlineCharsInContext</b> are variants of respectively
       <b>Tk_MeasureChars</b>, <b>Tk_DrawChars</b> and <b>Tk_UnderlineChars</b>, but with access to all the characters  on  the  line
       for  context. Except on macOS, this context isn't actually consulted (meaning the out of context variants
       are called).
