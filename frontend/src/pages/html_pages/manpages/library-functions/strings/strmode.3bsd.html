       strmode — convert inode status information into a symbolic string

</pre><h4><b>LIBRARY</b></h4><pre>
       Utility functions from BSD systems (libbsd, -lbsd)

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/string.h">string.h</a>&gt;</b>
       (See <u><a href="../man7/libbsd.7.html">libbsd</a></u>(7) for include usage.)

       <u>void</u>
       <b>strmode</b>(<u>mode_t</u> <u>mode</u>, <u>char</u> <u>*bp</u>);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>strmode</b>()  function  converts  a  file  <u>mode</u> (the type and permission information associated with an
       inode, see <u><a href="../man2/stat.2.html">stat</a></u>(2)) into a symbolic string which is stored in the location referenced by <u>bp</u>.  This stored
       string is eleven characters in length plus a trailing NUL.

       The first character is the inode type, and will be one of the following:

             -     regular file
             b     block special
             c     character special
             d     directory
             l     symbolic link
             p     fifo
             s     socket
             w     whiteout
             ?     unknown inode type

       The next nine characters encode three sets of permissions, in three characters  each.   The  first  three
       characters are the permissions for the owner of the file, the second three for the group the file belongs
       to, and the third for the ``other'', or default, set of users.

       Permission  checking is done as specifically as possible.  If read permission is denied to the owner of a
       file in the first set of permissions, the owner of the file will not be able to read the file.   This  is
       true  even  if  the owner is in the file's group and the group permissions allow reading or the ``other''
       permissions allow reading.

       If the first character of the three character set is an ``r'', the file  is  readable  for  that  set  of
       users; if a dash ``-'', it is not readable.

       If  the  second  character  of  the  three character set is a ``w'', the file is writable for that set of
       users; if a dash ``-'', it is not writable.

       The third character is the first of the following characters that apply:

       S     If the character is part of the owner permissions and the file is not executable or  the  directory
             is not searchable by the owner, and the set-user-id bit is set.

       S     If  the  character is part of the group permissions and the file is not executable or the directory
             is not searchable by the group, and the set-group-id bit is set.

       T     If the character is part of the other permissions and the file is not executable or  the  directory
             is not searchable by others, and the ``sticky'' (S_ISVTX) bit is set.

       s     If  the  character  is  part  of  the owner permissions and the file is executable or the directory
             searchable by the owner, and the set-user-id bit is set.

       s     If the character is part of the group permissions and the  file  is  executable  or  the  directory
             searchable by the group, and the set-group-id bit is set.

       t     If  the  character  is  part  of  the other permissions and the file is executable or the directory
             searchable by others, and the ``sticky'' (S_ISVTX) bit is set.

       x     The file is executable or the directory is searchable.

       -     None of the above apply.

       The last character is a plus sign ``+'' if any there are  any  alternate  or  additional  access  control
       methods associated with the inode, otherwise it will be a space.
