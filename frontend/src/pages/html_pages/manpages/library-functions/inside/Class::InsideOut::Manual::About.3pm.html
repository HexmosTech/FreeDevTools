       Class::InsideOut::Manual::About - guide to this and other implementations of the inside-out technique

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 1.14

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This manual provides an overview of the inside-out technique and its application within
       "Class::InsideOut" and other modules.  It also provides a list of references for further study.

   <b>Inside-out</b> <b>object</b> <b>basics</b>
       Inside-out objects use the blessed reference as an index into lexical data structures holding object
       properties, rather than using the blessed reference itself as a data structure.

         $self-&gt;{ name }        = "Larry"; # classic, hash-based object
         $name{ refaddr $self } = "Larry"; # inside-out

       The inside-out approach offers three major benefits:

       •   Enforced  encapsulation: object properties cannot be accessed directly from outside the lexical scope
           that declared them

       •   Making the property name part of a lexical variable rather than a hash-key means that  typos  in  the
           name will be caught as compile-time errors (if using strict)

       •   If the memory address of the blessed reference is used as the index, the reference can be of any type

       In  exchange  for  these  benefits,  robust  implementation  of  inside-out objects can be quite complex.
       "Class::InsideOut" manages that complexity.

   <b>Philosophy</b> <b>of</b> <b>"Class::InsideOut"</b>
       "Class::InsideOut" provides a set of tools for building safe inside-out classes with maximum flexibility.

       It aims to offer minimal restrictions beyond those necessary for robustness of the inside-out  technique.
       All  capabilities necessary for robustness should be automatic.  Anything that can be optional should be.
       The design should not introduce new restrictions unrelated to inside-out objects, such as attributes  and
       "CHECK" blocks that cause problems for "mod_perl" or the use of source filters for syntactic sugar.

       As a result, only a few things are mandatory:

       •   Properties must be based on hashes and declared via "property"

       •   Property hashes must be keyed on the "Scalar::Util::refaddr"

       •   "register" must be called on all new objects

       All  other  implementation details, including constructors, initializers and class inheritance management
       are left to the user (though a very simple  constructor  is  available  as  a  convenience).   This  does
       requires  some additional work, but maximizes freedom.  "Class::InsideOut" is intended to be a base class
       providing only fundamental features.  Subclasses of "Class::InsideOut" could be written that  build  upon
       it to provide particular styles of constructor, destructor and inheritance support.

   <b>Other</b> <b>modules</b> <b>on</b> <b>CPAN</b>
       •   Object::InsideOut  --  This  is  perhaps  the most full-featured, robust implementation of inside-out
           objects currently on CPAN.  It is highly  recommended  if  a  more  full-featured  inside-out  object
           builder  is  needed.   Its  array-based mode is faster than hash-based implementations, but black-box
           inheritance is handled via delegation, which imposes certain limitations.

       •   Class::Std -- Despite the name, this does not reflect currently known best practices  for  inside-out
           objects.  Does not provide thread-safety with CLONE and doesn't support black-box inheritance.  Has a
           robust inheritance/initialization system.

       •   Class::BuildMethods  --  Generates  accessors  with encapsulated storage using a flyweight inside-out
           variant. Lexicals properties are hidden; accessors must be used everywhere. Not thread-safe.

       •   Lexical::Attributes -- The original inside-out implementation, but missing  some  key  features  like
           thread-safety.  Also, uses source filters to provide Perl-6-like object syntax. Not thread-safe.

       •   Class::MakeMethods::Templates::InsideOut  --  Not a very robust implementation. Not thread-safe.  Not
           overloading-safe.  Has a steep learning curve for the Class::MakeMethods system.

       •   Object::LocalVars -- My own original thought experiment with 'outside-in' objects and local  variable
           aliasing. Not safe for any production use and offers very weak encapsulation.

       Much   of   the   Perl   community  discussion  of  inside-out  objects  has  taken  place  on  Perlmonks
       (&lt;<a href="http://perlmonks.org">http://perlmonks.org</a>&gt;).   My  scratchpad  there  has  a   fairly   comprehensive   list   of   articles
