</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Net::Citadel - Citadel.org protocol coverage

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       Version 0.25

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Net::Citadel;
         my $c = new Net::Citadel (host =&gt; 'citadel.example.org');
         $c-&gt;login ('Administrator', 'goodpassword');
         my @floors = $c-&gt;floors;

         eval {
            $c-&gt;assert_floor ('Level 6 (Management)');
         }; warn $@ if $@;

         $c-&gt;retract_floor ('Level 6 (Management)');

         $c-&gt;logout;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Citadel is a "turnkey open-source solution for email and collaboration" (this is as far as marketing can
       go :-). The main component is the <u>citadel</u> <u>server</u>. To communicate with it you can use either a web
       interface, or - if you have to automate things - with a protocol

          L&lt;<a href="http://www.citadel.org/doku.php">http://www.citadel.org/doku.php</a>?id=documentation:appproto:start&gt;

       This package tries to do a bit of abstraction (more could be done) and handles some of the protocol
       handling.  The basic idea is that the application using the package deals with Citadel's objects: rooms,
       floors, users.

</pre><h4><b>CONSTANTS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Configuration</b>
       CITADEL_PORT
           The constant $CITADEL_PORT is equal to 504, which is the IANA standard Citadel port.

   <b>Result</b> <b>Codes</b>
       LISTING_FOLLOWS
           The  result  code $LISTING_FOLLOWS is equal to 100 and is used by the Citadel server to indicate that
           after the server response, the server will output a listing of some sort.

       CIT_OK
           The result code $CIT_OK is equal to 200 and is used by  the  Citadel  server  to  indicate  that  the
           requested operation succeeded.

       MORE_DATA
           The  result  code  $MORE_DATA  is equal to 300 and is used by the Citadel server to indicate that the
           requested operation succeeded but that another command is required to complete it.

       SEND_LISTING
           The result code $SEND_LISTING is equal to 400 and is used by the Citadel server to indicate that  the
           requested operation is progressing and it is now expecting zero or more lines of text.

       ERROR
           The  result  code  $ERROR  is  equal  to  500  and is used by the Citadel server to indicate that the
           requested operation failed. The second and third digits of the error code and/or  the  error  message
           following it describes why.

       BINARY_FOLLOWS
           The  result  code  $BINARY_FOLLOWS is equal to 600 and is used by the Citadel server to indicate that

       SEND_BINARY
           The result code $SEND_BINARY is equal to 700 and is used by the Citadel server to indicate  that  "n"
           bytes of binary data can now be sent. ("n" follows after a blank.

</pre><h4><b>INTERFACE</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Constructor</b>
       "$c = new Net::Citadel (host =" $ctdl_host)&gt;

       The constructor creates a handle to the citadel server (and creates the  TCP  connection).  It  uses  the
       following named parameters:

       <u>host</u> (default: "localhost")
           The hostname (or IP address) where the citadel server is running. Defaults to "localhost".

       <u>port</u> (default: $CITADEL_PORT)
           The port where the citadel server is running. Defaults to the standard Citadel port number 504.

       The constructor will croak if no connection can be established.

   <b>Methods</b>
       <u>Authentication</u>

       <u>login</u>
           <u>$c</u>-&gt;login (<u>$user</u>, <u>$pwd</u>)

           Logs in this user, or will croak if that fails.

       <u>logout</u>
           <u>$c</u>-&gt;logout

           Well, logs out the current user.

       <u>Floors</u>

       <u>floors</u>
           <u>@floors</u> = <u>$c</u>-&gt;floors

           Retrieves a list (ARRAY) of known floors. Each entry is a hash reference with the name, the number of
           rooms in that floor and the index as ID. The index within the array is also the ID of the floor.

       <u>assert_floor</u>
           <u>$c</u>-&gt;assert_floor (<u>$floor_name</u>)

           Creates the floor with the name provided, or if it already exists simply returns. This only croaks if
           there are insufficient privileges.

       <u>retract_floor</u>
           <u>$c</u>-&gt;retract_floor (<u>$floor_name</u>)

           Retracts  a  floor  with this name. croaks if that fails because of insufficient privileges. Does not
           croak if the floor did not exist.

           <b>NOTE</b>: Citadel server (v7.20) seems to have the bug that you cannot  delete  an  empty  floor  without
           restarting the server. Not much I can do here about that.

       <u>rooms</u>
           <u>@rooms</u> = <u>$c</u>-&gt;rooms (<u>$floor_name</u>)

           Retrieves the rooms on that given floor.

       <u>Rooms</u>

       <u>assert_room</u>
           <u>$c</u>-&gt;assert_room (<u>$floor_name</u>, <u>$room_name</u>, [ <u>$room_attributes</u> ])

           Creates  the  room on the given floor. If the room already exists there, nothing else happens. If the
           floor does not exist, it will complain.

           The optional room attributes are provided as hash with the following fields

           "access" (default: "PUBLIC")
               One of the constants "PUBLIC", "PRIVATE", "PRIVATE_PASSWORD", "PRIVATE_INVITATION" or "PERSONAL".

           "password" (default: empty)
           "default_view" (default: empty)
       <u>retract_room</u>
           <u>$c</u>-&gt;retract_room (<u>$floor_name</u>, <u>$room_name</u>)

           <b>NOTE</b>: Not implemented yet.

       <u>Users</u>

       <u>create_user</u>
           <u>$c</u>-&gt;create_user (<u>$username</u>, <u>$password</u>)

           Tries to create a user with name and password. Fails if this  user  already  exists  (or  some  other
           reason).

       <u>change_user</u>
           <u>$c</u>-&gt;change_user (<u>$user_name</u>, <u>$aspect</u> =&gt; <u>$value</u>)

           Changes certain aspects of a user. Currently understood aspects are

           "password" (string)
           "access_level" (0..6, constants available)
       <u>remove_user</u>
           <u>$c</u>-&gt;remove_user (<u>$name</u>)

           Removes the user (actually sets level to "DELETED_USER").

       <u>Miscellaneous</u>

       <u>citadel_echo</u>
           <u>$c</u>-&gt;citadel_echo (<u>$string</u>)

           Tests  a  connection to the Citadel server by sending a message string to it and then checking to see
           if that same string is echoed back.

       <u>citadel_info</u>
           $info_aref = <u>$c</u>-&gt;<u>citadel_info()</u>

           Sends the "INFO" command to the Citadel server and returns the lines  it  receives  from  that  as  a
           reference  to  an  array.  An example of getting and then displaying the server information lines the
           following:

            my $c = new Net::Citadel (host =&gt; $host_name);
            my $info_aref = $c-&gt;citadel_info;
            foreach $line (@{$info_aref}) {
               print $line;
            }

           For more details about the server information lines that  are  returned,  see  the  "INFO"  entry  at
           &lt;<a href="http://www.citadel.org/doku.php/documentation">http://www.citadel.org/doku.php/documentation</a>:appproto:connection&gt;.

       <u>citadel_mrtg</u>
           %mrtg_hash = <u>$c</u>-&gt;citadel_mrtg($type)

           Sends  the "MRTG" command to the Citadel server. It expects a type of either "users" or "messages" to
           be passed to it and returns a hash containing the information from the server.

           ActiveUsers Number of active users on the system.  Only returned for type "users".
           ConnectedUsers
               Number of connected users on the system.  Only returned for type "users".

           HighMsg
               Highest message number on the system.  Only returned for type "messages".

           SystemUptime
               The uptime for the system formatted as days, hours, minutes.

           SystemName
               Human readable name of the Citadel system.

       <u>citadel_time</u>
           <u>$t</u> = <u>$c</u>-&gt;citadel_time

           Gets the current system time and time zone offset from UTC in UNIX timestamp format from the  Citadel
           server.

           "TODO": Rewrite function to return the unpacked parameters as a hash upon success.
