       Env::Dot - Read environment variables from .env file

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 0.018

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Env::Dot;

           print $ENV{'VAR_DEFINED_IN_DOTENV_FILE'};

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       More flexibility in how you manage and use your <u>.env</u> file.

       <b>Attn.</b> <b>Existing</b> <b>environment</b> <b>variables</b> <b>always</b> <b>take</b> <b>precedence</b> <b>to</b> <b>dotenv</b> <b>variables!</b>  A dotenv variable
       (variable from a file) does not overwrite an existing environment variable. This is by design because a
       dotenv file is to augment the environment, not to replace it.

       This means that you can override a variable in `.env` file by creating its counterpart in the
       environment. For instance:

           unset VAR
           echo "VAR='Good value'" &gt;&gt; .env
           perl -e 'use Env::Dot; print "VAR:$ENV{VAR}\n";'
           # VAR:Good value
           VAR='Better value'; export VAR
           perl -e 'use Env::Dot; print "VAR:$ENV{VAR}\n";'
           # VAR:Better value

   <b>Features</b>
       If no <b>.env</b> file is present, then do nothing
               By  default,  Env::Dot will do nothing if there is no <b>.env</b> file.  You can also configure Env::Dot
               to emit an alarm or break execution, if you want.

       Specify other dotenv files with path
               If your <b>.env</b> file is located in another path, not the current working directory, you can use  the
               environment variable <b>ENVDOT_FILEPATHS</b> to tell where your dotenv file is located.  You can specify
               several  file  paths; just separate them by <b>:</b>. Env::Dot will load the files in the <b>reverse</b> <b>order</b>,
               starting from the last. This is the same ordering as used in <b>PATH</b> variable: the  first  overrules
               the  following ones, that is, when reading from the last path to the first path, if same variable
               is present in more than one file, the later one replaces the one already read.

               Attn. If you are using Windows, separate the paths by &lt;;&gt;!

               For example, if you have the following directory structure:

                   project-root
                   | .env
                   + - sub-project
                     | .env

               and  you  specify  <b>ENVDOT_FILEPATHS=project-root/sub-project/.env:project-root/.env</b>,   then   the
               variables  in  file  <b>project-root/.env</b>  will  get  replaced  by  the  more  specific variables in
               <b>project-root/sub-project/.env</b>.

               In Windows, this would be <b>ENVDOT_FILEPATHS=project-root\sub-project\.env;project-root\.env</b>

               N.B. The ordering has changed in version 0.0.9.

       Support different types of .env files
               Unix Shell <u>source</u> command compatible dotenv files use double or single quotation marks (<b>"</b>  or  <b>'</b>)
               to define a variable which has spaces. But, for instance, Docker compatible <u>.env</u> files do not use
               quotation marks. The variable's value begins with <b>=</b> sign and ends with linefeed.

               You can specify in the dotenv file itself - by using meta commands - which type of file it is.

       Use executable <b>envdot</b> to bring the variables into your shell
               The executable is distributed together with Env::Dot package.  It is in the directory <u>script</u>.

               The executable <u>script/envdot</u> is not Windows compatible!

               A  Windows  (MS  Command  and Powershell compatible) version, <u>script\envdot.bat</u>, is possible in a
               future release. Please contact the author if you are interested in it.

                   eval "$(envdot)"

               N.B. If your <b>.env</b> file(s) contain variables which need interpolating,  for  example,  to  combine
               their value from other variables or execute a command to produce their value, you have to use the
               <b>envdot</b>  program.   <b>Env::Dot</b>  does  not do any interpolating. It cannot because that would involve
               running the variable in the shell context.

   <b>DotEnv</b> <b>File</b> <b>Meta</b> <b>Commands</b>
       The <b>var:</b> commands affect only the subsequent variable definition.  If there is  another  <b>envdot</b>  command,
       the second overwrites the first and default values are applied again.

       read:from_parent
               By setting this option to <b>true</b>, <b>Env::Dot</b> or <b>envdot</b> command will search for <u>.env</u> files in the file
               system  tree  upwards.   It  will  load  the  first <u>.env</u> file it finds from the current directory
               upwards to root.

               Using <b>read:from_parent</b> will only find and read one <b>.env</b> file in a parent directory.  If you  want
               to chain the <b>.env</b> files, they all must set <b>read:from_parent</b> - except the top one.

               This  functionality  can  be  useful  in  situations where you have parallel projects which share
               common environment variables in one <u>.env</u> file in a parent directory.

               If there is no parent <u>.env</u> file, Env::Dot will break execution and give an error.

               By default this setting is off.

       read:allow_missing_parent
               When using option <b>read:from_parent</b>, if the parent <u>.env</u> file does not exist, by  default  Env::Dot
               will  emit  an  error  and break execution.  In some situations, it might be normal that a parent
               <u>.env</u> file could be missing. Turn on option <b>read:allow_missing_parent</b> if you do not want an  error
               in that case.

               By default this setting is off.

       file:type
               Changes how <b>Env::Dot</b> reads lines below from this commands. Default is:

                   # envdot (file:type=shell)
                   VAR="value"

               Other possible value of <b>file:type</b> is:

                   # envdot (file:type=plain)
                   VAR=My var value

       var:allow_interpolate
               By  default, when writing variable definitions for the shell, every variable is treated as static
               and surrounded with single quotation marks <b>'</b> in Unix  shell  which  means  shell  will  read  the
               variable content as is.  By setting this to <b>1</b> or <b>true</b>, you allow shell to interpolate.  This meta
               command  is  only  useful  when  running  <b>envdot</b>  command to create variable definitions for <b>eval</b>
               command to read.

                   # envdot (var:allow_interpolate)
                   DYNAMIC_VAR="$(pwd)/${ANOTHER_VAR}"

</pre><h4><b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       This module is currently being developed so changes in the API are possible, though not likely.

</pre><h4><b>DEPENDENCIES</b></h4><pre>
       No external dependencies outside Perl's standard distribution.

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       No functions exported to the calling namespace.

   <b>load_vars</b>
       Load variables from <u>.env</u> file or files in environment variable <b>ENVDOT_FILEPATHS</b>.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       Env::Assert will verify that you certainly have those environmental variables you need. It  also  has  an
       executable which can perform the check in the beginning of a <b>docker</b> container run.

       Dotenv and ENV::Util &lt;https://metacpan.org/pod/ENV::Util&gt; are packages which also implement functionality
       to use <u>.env</u> files in Perl.

       Config::ENV  and  Config::Layered::Source::ENV provide other means to configure application with the help
       of environment variables.
