</pre><h4><b>Detailed</b> <b>Description</b></h4><pre>
       These functions perform horizontal and vertical canvas flipping.

</pre><h4><b>Function</b> <b>Documentation</b></h4><pre>
   <b>__extern</b> <b>int</b> <b>caca_invert</b> <b>(caca_canvas_t</b> <b>*</b> <b>cv)</b>
       Invert a canvas' colours (black becomes white, red becomes cyan, etc.) without changing the characters in
       it.

       This function never fails.

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>cv</u> The canvas to invert.

       <b>Returns</b>
           This function always returns 0.

       References <b>caca_add_dirty_rect()</b>.

   <b>__extern</b> <b>int</b> <b>caca_flip</b> <b>(caca_canvas_t</b> <b>*</b> <b>cv)</b>
       Flip a canvas horizontally, choosing characters that look like the mirrored version wherever possible.
       Some characters will stay unchanged by the process, but the operation is guaranteed to be involutive:
       performing it again gives back the original canvas.

       This function never fails.

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>cv</u> The canvas to flip.

       <b>Returns</b>
           This function always returns 0.

       References <b>caca_add_dirty_rect()</b>, and <b>CACA_MAGIC_FULLWIDTH</b>.

   <b>__extern</b> <b>int</b> <b>caca_flop</b> <b>(caca_canvas_t</b> <b>*</b> <b>cv)</b>
       Flip a canvas vertically, choosing characters that look like the mirrored version wherever possible. Some
       characters will stay unchanged by the process, but the operation is guaranteed to be involutive:
       performing it again gives back the original canvas.

       This function never fails.

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>cv</u> The canvas to flop.

       <b>Returns</b>
           This function always returns 0.

       References <b>caca_add_dirty_rect()</b>.

   <b>__extern</b> <b>int</b> <b>caca_rotate_180</b> <b>(caca_canvas_t</b> <b>*</b> <b>cv)</b>
       Apply a 180-degree transformation to a canvas, choosing characters that look like the upside-down version
       wherever possible. Some characters will stay unchanged by the process, but the operation is guaranteed to
       be involutive: performing it again gives back the original canvas.

       This function never fails.

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>cv</u> The canvas to rotate.

       <b>Returns</b>
           This function always returns 0.

   <b>__extern</b> <b>int</b> <b>caca_rotate_left</b> <b>(caca_canvas_t</b> <b>*</b> <b>cv)</b>
       Apply a 90-degree transformation to a canvas, choosing characters that look like the rotated version
       wherever possible. Characters cells are rotated two-by-two. Some characters will stay unchanged by the
       process, some others will be replaced by close equivalents. Fullwidth characters at odd horizontal
       coordinates will be lost. The operation is not guaranteed to be reversible at all.

       Note that the width of the canvas is divided by two and becomes the new height. Height is multiplied by
       two and becomes the new width. If the original width is an odd number, the division is rounded up.

       If an error occurs, -1 is returned and <b>errno</b> is set accordingly:

       • EBUSY The canvas is in use by a display driver and cannot be rotated.

       • ENOMEM  Not  enough memory to allocate the new canvas size. If this happens, the previous canvas handle
         is still valid.

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>cv</u> The canvas to rotate left.

       <b>Returns</b>
           0 in case of success, -1 if an error occurred.

   <b>__extern</b> <b>int</b> <b>caca_rotate_right</b> <b>(caca_canvas_t</b> <b>*</b> <b>cv)</b>
       Apply a 90-degree transformation to a canvas, choosing characters that  look  like  the  rotated  version
       wherever  possible.  Characters  cells are rotated two-by-two. Some characters will stay unchanged by the
       process, some others will be replaced by  close  equivalents.  Fullwidth  characters  at  odd  horizontal
       coordinates will be lost. The operation is not guaranteed to be reversible at all.

       Note  that  the width of the canvas is divided by two and becomes the new height. Height is multiplied by
       two and becomes the new width. If the original width is an odd number, the division is rounded up.

         is still valid.

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>cv</u> The canvas to rotate right.

       <b>Returns</b>
           0 in case of success, -1 if an error occurred.

       References <b>caca_add_dirty_rect()</b>.

   <b>__extern</b> <b>int</b> <b>caca_stretch_left</b> <b>(caca_canvas_t</b> <b>*</b> <b>cv)</b>
       Apply  a  90-degree  transformation  to  a canvas, choosing characters that look like the rotated version
       wherever possible. Some characters will stay unchanged by the process, some others will  be  replaced  by
       close equivalents. Fullwidth characters will be lost. The operation is not guaranteed to be reversible at
       all.

       Note that the width and height of the canvas are swapped, causing its aspect ratio to look stretched.

       If an error occurs, -1 is returned and <b>errno</b> is set accordingly:

       • EBUSY The canvas is in use by a display driver and cannot be rotated.

       • ENOMEM  Not  enough memory to allocate the new canvas size. If this happens, the previous canvas handle
         is still valid.

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>cv</u> The canvas to rotate left.

       <b>Returns</b>
           0 in case of success, -1 if an error occurred.

       References <b>caca_add_dirty_rect()</b>.

   <b>__extern</b> <b>int</b> <b>caca_stretch_right</b> <b>(caca_canvas_t</b> <b>*</b> <b>cv)</b>
       Apply a 270-degree transformation to a canvas, choosing characters that look  like  the  rotated  version
       wherever  possible.  Some  characters will stay unchanged by the process, some others will be replaced by
       close equivalents. Fullwidth characters will be lost. The operation is not guaranteed to be reversible at
       all.

       Note that the width and height of the canvas are swapped, causing its aspect ratio to look stretched.

       If an error occurs, -1 is returned and <b>errno</b> is set accordingly:

       • EBUSY The canvas is in use by a display driver and cannot be rotated.

       • ENOMEM Not enough memory to allocate the new canvas size. If this happens, the previous  canvas  handle
         is still valid.

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>cv</u> The canvas to rotate right.

       <b>Returns</b>
           0 in case of success, -1 if an error occurred.
