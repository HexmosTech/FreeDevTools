</pre><h4><b>WIDGET-SPECIFIC</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Command-Line Name:<b>-closeenough</b>
       Database Name:  <b>closeEnough</b>
       Database Class: <b>CloseEnough</b>

              Specifies  a  floating-point value indicating how close the mouse cursor must be to an item before
              it is considered to be “inside” the item. Defaults to 1.0.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-confine</b>
       Database Name:  <b>confine</b>
       Database Class: <b>Confine</b>

              Specifies a boolean value that indicates whether or not it should be allowable to set the canvas's
              view outside the region defined by the <b>scrollRegion</b> argument.  Defaults to true, which means  that
              the view will be constrained within the scroll region.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-height</b>
       Database Name:  <b>height</b>
       Database Class: <b>Height</b>

              Specifies a desired window height that the canvas widget should request from its geometry manager.
              The value may be specified in any of the forms described in the <b>COORDINATES</b> section below.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-scrollregion</b>
       Database Name:  <b>scrollRegion</b>
       Database Class: <b>ScrollRegion</b>

              Specifies  a list with four coordinates describing the left, top, right, and bottom coordinates of
              a rectangular region.  This region is used for scrolling purposes and  is  considered  to  be  the
              boundary of the information in the canvas.  Each of the coordinates may be specified in any of the
              forms given in the <b>COORDINATES</b> section below.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-state</b>
       Database Name:  <b>state</b>
       Database Class: <b>State</b>

              Modifies  the  default  state of the canvas where <u>state</u> may be set to one of: <b>normal</b>, <b>disabled</b>, or
              <b>hidden</b>. Individual canvas objects all have their own state option which may override  the  default
              state.  Many  options can take separate specifications such that the appearance of the item can be
              different in different situations. The options that start with <b>active</b> control the appearance  when
              the mouse pointer is over it, while the option starting with <b>disabled</b> controls the appearance when
              the state is disabled. Canvas items which are <b>disabled</b> will not react to canvas bindings.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-width</b>
       Database Name:  <b>width</b>
       Database Class: <b>width</b>

              Specifies  a desired window width that the canvas widget should request from its geometry manager.
              The value may be specified in any of the forms described in the <b>COORDINATES</b> section below.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-xscrollincrement</b>
       Database Name:  <b>xScrollIncrement</b>
       Database Class: <b>ScrollIncrement</b>

              Specifies an increment for horizontal scrolling, in any of the usual forms  permitted  for  screen
              distances.  If  the  value  of this option is greater than zero, the horizontal view in the window
              will be constrained so that the canvas x coordinate at the left edge of the window  is  always  an
              even  multiple of <b>xScrollIncrement</b>; furthermore, the units for scrolling (e.g., the change in view
              when the left and right arrows of a scrollbar are selected) will also be <b>xScrollIncrement</b>. If  the
              value of this option is negative or zero, then horizontal scrolling is unconstrained.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-yscrollincrement</b>
       Database Name:  <b>yScrollIncrement</b>
       Database Class: <b>ScrollIncrement</b>

              Specifies  an  increment  for  vertical  scrolling, in any of the usual forms permitted for screen
              distances. If the value of this option is greater than zero, the vertical view in the window  will
              be  constrained  so  that  the canvas y coordinate at the top edge of the window is always an even
              multiple of <b>yScrollIncrement</b>; furthermore, the units for scrolling (e.g., the change in view  when
              the top and bottom arrows of a scrollbar are selected) will also be <b>yScrollIncrement</b>. If the value
              of this option is negative or zero, then vertical scrolling is unconstrained.

</pre><h4><b>INTRODUCTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>canvas</b>  command  creates  a  new  window (given by the <u>pathName</u> argument) and makes it into a canvas
       widget.  Additional options, described above, may be specified on the  command  line  or  in  the  option
       database  to  configure  aspects  of  the  canvas  such as its colors and 3-D relief.  The <b>canvas</b> command
       returns its <u>pathName</u> argument. At the time this command is invoked, there must not exist a  window  named
       <u>pathName</u>, but <u>pathName</u>'s parent must exist.

       Canvas widgets implement structured graphics.  A canvas displays any number of <u>items</u>, which may be things
       like  rectangles,  circles,  lines,  and  text.   Items may be manipulated (e.g. moved or re-colored) and
       commands may be associated with items in much the same way that the <b>bind</b> command allows  commands  to  be
       bound  to  widgets. For example, a particular command may be associated with the &lt;Button-1&gt; event so that
       the command is invoked whenever button 1 is pressed with the mouse cursor over an item.  This means  that
       items in a canvas can have behaviors defined by the Tcl scripts bound to them.

</pre><h4><b>DISPLAY</b> <b>LIST</b></h4><pre>
       The  items in a canvas are ordered for purposes of display, with the first item in the display list being
       displayed first, followed by the next item in the list, and so on.   Items  later  in  the  display  list
       obscure  those  that  are  earlier in the display list and are sometimes referred to as being “on top” of
       earlier items.  When a new item is created it is placed at the  end  of  the  display  list,  on  top  of
       everything else.  Widget commands may be used to re-arrange the order of the display list.

       Window items are an exception to the above rules. The underlying window systems require them always to be
       drawn  on  top of other items.  In addition, the stacking order of window items is not affected by any of
       the canvas widget commands; you must use the Tk <b>raise</b> command and <b>lower</b> command instead.

</pre><h4><b>ITEM</b> <b>IDS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>TAGS</b></h4><pre>
       Items in a canvas widget may be named in either of two ways: by id or by tag.  Each  item  has  a  unique
       identifying  number,  which  is assigned to that item when it is created. The id of an item never changes
       and id numbers are never re-used within the lifetime of a canvas widget.

       Each item may also have any number of <u>tags</u> associated with it. A tag is just a string of characters,  and
       it  may  take  any form except that of an integer.  For example, “x123” is OK but “123” is not.  The same
       tag may be associated with many different items.  This  is  commonly  done  to  group  items  in  various
       interesting ways; for example, all selected items might be given the tag “selected”.

       The  tag  <b>all</b> is implicitly associated with every item in the canvas; it may be used to invoke operations
       on all the items in the canvas.

       The tag <b>current</b> is managed automatically by Tk; it applies to the <u>current</u> <u>item</u>, which is the topmost item
       whose drawn area covers the position of the mouse cursor (different item types interpret this in  varying
       ways;  see the individual item type documentation for details).  If the mouse is not in the canvas widget
       or is not over an item, then no item has the <b>current</b> tag.

       When specifying items in canvas widget commands, if the specifier is an integer then  it  is  assumed  to
       refer  to  the single item with that id.  If the specifier is not an integer, then it is assumed to refer
       to all of the items in the canvas that have a tag matching the specifier.  The  symbol  <u>tagOrId</u>  is  used
       below  to  indicate  that  an  argument  specifies  either an id that selects a single item or a tag that
       selects zero or more items.

       <u>tagOrId</u> may contain a logical expressions  of  tags  by  using  operators:  “<b>&amp;&amp;</b>”,  “<b>||</b>”,  “<b>^</b>”,  “<b>!</b>”,  and
       parenthesized subexpressions. For example:
                    .c find withtag {(a&amp;&amp;!b)||(!a&amp;&amp;b)}
       or equivalently:
                    .c find withtag {a^b}
       will find only those items with either “a” or “b” tags, but not both.

       Some widget commands only operate on a single item at a time; if <u>tagOrId</u> is specified in a way that names
       multiple  items,  then the normal behavior is for the command to use the first (lowest) of these items in
       the display list that is  suitable  for  the  command.   Exceptions  are  noted  in  the  widget  command
       descriptions below.

</pre><h4><b>COORDINATES</b></h4><pre>
       All  coordinates related to canvases are stored as floating-point numbers.  Coordinates and distances are
       specified in screen units, which are  floating-point  numbers  optionally  followed  by  one  of  several
       letters.   If no letter is supplied then the distance is in pixels.  If the letter is <b>m</b> then the distance
       is in millimeters on the screen; if it is <b>c</b> then the distance is in centimeters; <b>i</b> means  inches,  and  <b>p</b>
       means  printers  points (1/72 inch).  Larger y-coordinates refer to points lower on the screen; larger x-
       coordinates refer to points farther to the right.  Coordinates can be specified either as an even  number
       of parameters, or as a single list parameter containing an even number of x and y coordinate values.

   <b>TRANSFORMATIONS</b>
       Normally  the origin of the canvas coordinate system is at the upper-left corner of the window containing
       the canvas.  It is possible to adjust the origin of the canvas coordinate system relative to  the  origin
       of  the window using the <b>xview</b> and <b>yview</b> widget commands; this is typically used for scrolling.  Canvases
       do not support scaling or rotation of the canvas coordinate system  relative  to  the  window  coordinate
       system.

       Individual items may be moved, scaled or rotated using widget commands described below.                   2

       Note  that  the  default  origin of the canvas's visible area is coincident with the origin for the whole
       window as that makes bindings using the mouse position easier to work with; you  only  need  to  use  the
       <b>canvasx</b>  and  <b>canvasy</b>  widget  commands  if you adjust the origin of the visible area. However, this also
       means that any focus ring (as controlled  by  the  <b>-highlightthickness</b>  option)  and  window  border  (as
       controlled  by  the <b>-borderwidth</b> option) must be taken into account before you get to the visible area of
       the canvas.

</pre><h4><b>INDICES</b></h4><pre>
       Text items support the notion of an <u>index</u> for identifying particular positions within  the  item.   In  a
       similar  fashion, line and polygon items support <u>index</u> for identifying, inserting and deleting subsets of
       their coordinates.  Indices are used for commands such as inserting or deleting a range of characters  or
       coordinates,  and  setting the insertion cursor position. An index may be specified in any of a number of
       ways, and different types of items may support  different  forms  for  specifying  indices.   Text  items
       support  the  following  forms  for  an  index;  if  you define new types of text-like items, it would be
       advisable to support as many of these forms as practical.  Note that it  is  possible  to  refer  to  the
       character  just  after  the  last one in the text item; this is necessary for such tasks as inserting new
       text at the end of the item.  Lines and Polygons do not support the insertion cursor and  the  selection.
       Their indices are supposed to be even always, because coordinates always appear in pairs.

       <u>number</u>    A  decimal  number giving the position of the desired character within the text item.  0 refers
                 to the first character, 1 to the next character, and so on. If indexes are odd  for  lines  and
                 polygons,  they  will be automatically decremented by one.  A negative number  is treated as if
                 it were zero, and a number greater than the length of the text item is treated as  if  it  were
                 equal  to  the  length of the text item. For polygons, negative numbers or numbers greater than
                 the length of the coordinate list will be adjusted by adding or subtracting  the  length  until
                 the result is between zero and the length, inclusive.

       <b>end</b>       Refers  to  the character or coordinate just after the last one in the item (same as the number
                 of characters or coordinates in the item).

       <b>insert</b>    Refers to the character just before which the insertion cursor is drawn in this item. Not valid
                 for lines and polygons.

       <b>sel.first</b> Refers to the first selected character in the item.  If the selection is not in this item  then
                 this form is illegal.

       <b>sel.last</b>  Refers  to  the last selected character in the item.  If the selection is not in this item then
                 this form is illegal.

       <b>@</b><u>x,y</u>      Refers to the character or coordinate at the point given  by  <u>x</u>  and  <u>y</u>,  where  <u>x</u>  and  <u>y</u>  are
                 specified  in  the  coordinate  system  of  the canvas.  If <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> lie outside the coordinates
                 covered by the text item, then they refer to the first or last character in the  line  that  is
                 closest to the given point.

</pre><h4><b>DASH</b> <b>PATTERNS</b></h4><pre>
       Many items support the notion of a dash pattern for outlines.

       The  first  possible syntax is a list of integers. Each element represents the number of pixels of a line
       segment. Only the odd segments are drawn  using  the  “outline”  color.  The  other  segments  are  drawn
       transparent.

       The  second possible syntax is a character list containing only 5 possible characters “<b>.,-_</b> ”.  The space
       can be used to enlarge the space between other line elements, and cannot occur as the first  position  in
       the string. Some examples:

              -dash .     → -dash {2 4}
              -dash -     → -dash {6 4}
              -dash -.    → -dash {6 4 2 4}
              -dash -..   → -dash {6 4 2 4 2 4}
              -dash {. }  → -dash {2 8}
              -dash ,     → -dash {4 4}

       The  main difference of this syntax with the previous is that it is shape-conserving. This means that all
       values in the dash list will be multiplied by the line width before display. This assures that “.”   will
       always be displayed as a dot and “-” always as a dash regardless of the line width.

       On  systems  which support only a limited set of dash patterns, the dash pattern will be displayed as the
       closest dash pattern that is available.  For example, on Windows only the first 4 of the  above  examples
       are available. The last 2 examples will be displayed identically to the first one.

</pre><h4><b>WIDGET</b> <b>COMMAND</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>canvas</b>  command creates a new Tcl command whose name is <u>pathName</u>. This command may be used to invoke
       various operations on the widget. It has the following general form:
              <u>pathName</u> <u>option</u> ?<u>arg</u> <u>...</u>?
       <u>Option</u> and the <u>arg</u>s determine the exact behavior of the  command.   The  following  widget  commands  are
       possible for canvas widgets:

       <u>pathName</u> <b>addtag</b> <u>tag</u> <u>searchSpec</u> ?<u>arg</u> <u>...</u>?
              For each item that meets the constraints specified by <u>searchSpec</u> and the <u>arg</u>s, add <u>tag</u> to the list
              of  tags  associated with the item if it is not already present on that list.  It is possible that
              no items will satisfy the constraints given by <u>searchSpec</u> and <u>arg</u>s, in which case the command  has
              no  effect.  This command returns an empty string as result.  <u>SearchSpec</u> and <u>arg</u>'s may take any of
              the following forms:

              <b>above</b> <u>tagOrId</u>
                     Selects the item just after (above) the one given by  <u>tagOrId</u>  in  the  display  list.   If
                     <u>tagOrId</u>  denotes  more than one item, then the last (topmost) of these items in the display
                     list is used.

              <b>all</b>    Selects all the items in the canvas.

              <b>below</b> <u>tagOrId</u>
                     Selects the item just before (below) the one given by <u>tagOrId</u>  in  the  display  list.   If
                     <u>tagOrId</u>  denotes  more than one item, then the first (lowest) of these items in the display
                     list is used.

              <b>closest</b> <u>x</u> <u>y</u> ?<u>halo</u>? ?<u>start</u>?
                     Selects the item closest to the point given by <u>x</u> and <u>y</u>.  If more than one item  is  at  the
                     same  closest distance (e.g. two items overlap the point), then the top-most of these items
                     (the last one in the display list) is used.  If <u>halo</u> is specified, then it must be  a  non-
                     negative  value.   Any item closer than <u>halo</u> to the point is considered to overlap it.  The
                     <u>start</u> argument may be used to step circularly through all the closest items.  If  <u>start</u>  is
                     specified,  it names an item using a tag or id (if by tag, it selects the first item in the
                     display list with the given tag).  Instead of selecting the topmost closest item, this form
                     will select the topmost closest item that is below <u>start</u> in the display list;  if  no  such
                     item exists, then the selection behaves as if the <u>start</u> argument had not been specified.

              <b>enclosed</b> <u>x1</u> <u>y1</u> <u>x2</u> <u>y2</u>
                     Selects  all  the  items completely enclosed within the rectangular region given by <u>x1</u>, <u>y1</u>,
                     <u>x2</u>, and <u>y2</u>.  <u>X1</u> must be no greater than <u>x2</u> and <u>y1</u> must be no greater than <u>y2</u>.

              <b>overlapping</b> <u>x1</u> <u>y1</u> <u>x2</u> <u>y2</u>
                     Selects all the items that overlap or are enclosed within the rectangular region  given  by
                     <u>x1</u>, <u>y1</u>, <u>x2</u>, and <u>y2</u>.  <u>X1</u> must be no greater than <u>x2</u> and <u>y1</u> must be no greater than <u>y2</u>.

              <b>withtag</b> <u>tagOrId</u>
                     Selects all the items given by <u>tagOrId</u>.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>bbox</b> <u>tagOrId</u> ?<u>tagOrId</u> <u>tagOrId</u> <u>...</u>?
              Returns  a  list  with four elements giving an approximate bounding box for all the items named by
              the <u>tagOrId</u> arguments.  The list has the form “<u>x1</u> <u>y1</u> <u>x2</u> <u>y2</u>” such that the drawn areas of  all  the
              named  elements  are  within the region bounded by <u>x1</u> on the left, <u>x2</u> on the right, <u>y1</u> on the top,
              and <u>y2</u> on the bottom.  The return value may overestimate the actual bounding box by a few  pixels.
              If  no items match any of the <u>tagOrId</u> arguments or if the matching items have empty bounding boxes
              (i.e. they have nothing to display) then an empty string is returned.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>bind</b> <u>tagOrId</u> ?<u>sequence</u>? ?<u>command</u>?
              This command associates <u>command</u> with all the items given by <u>tagOrId</u> such that whenever  the  event
              sequence  given  by <u>sequence</u> occurs for one of the items the command will be invoked.  This widget
              command is similar to the <b>bind</b> command except that it operates on items in a  canvas  rather  than
              entire  widgets.  See the <b>bind</b> manual entry for complete details on the syntax of <u>sequence</u> and the
              substitutions performed on <u>command</u> before invoking it.  If all arguments are specified then a  new
              binding is created, replacing any existing binding for the same <u>sequence</u> and <u>tagOrId</u> (if the first
              character  of  <u>command</u> is “+” then <u>command</u> augments an existing binding rather than replacing it).
              In this case the return value is an empty string.  If <u>command</u> is omitted then the command  returns
              the  <u>command</u>  associated  with <u>tagOrId</u> and <u>sequence</u> (an error occurs if there is no such binding).
              If both <u>command</u> and <u>sequence</u> are omitted then the command returns a list of all the sequences  for
              which bindings have been defined for <u>tagOrId</u>.

              The  only  events  for which bindings may be specified are those related to the mouse and keyboard
              (such as <b>Enter</b>, <b>Leave</b>, <b>Button</b>, <b>Motion</b>, and <b>Key</b>) or virtual events.   The  handling  of  events  in
              canvases  uses the current item defined in <b>ITEM</b> <b>IDS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>TAGS</b> above. <b>Enter</b> and <b>Leave</b> events trigger
              for an item when it becomes the current item or ceases to be the current  item;  note  that  these
              events are different than <b>Enter</b> and <b>Leave</b> events for windows. Mouse-related events are directed to
              the  current item, if any. Keyboard-related events are directed to the focus item, if any (see the
              <b>focus</b> widget command below for more on this). If a virtual  event  is  used  in  a  binding,  that
              binding  can  trigger  only  if  the  virtual  event  is defined by an underlying mouse-related or
              keyboard-related event.

              It is possible for multiple bindings to match a particular event.  This could occur, for  example,
              if  one  binding is associated with the item's id and another is associated with one of the item's
              tags.  When this occurs, all of the matching bindings are invoked.  A binding associated with  the
              <b>all</b> tag is invoked first, followed by one binding for each of the item's tags (in order), followed
              by  a binding associated with the item's id.  If there are multiple matching bindings for a single
              tag, then only the most specific binding is invoked.  A  <b>continue</b>  command  in  a  binding  script
              terminates that script, and a <b>break</b> command terminates that script and skips any remaining scripts
              for the event, just as for the <b>bind</b> command.

              If bindings have been created for a canvas window using the <b>bind</b> command, then they are invoked in
              addition  to  bindings created for the canvas's items using the <b>bind</b> widget command.  The bindings
              for items will be invoked before any of the bindings for the window as a whole.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>canvasx</b> <u>screenx</u> ?<u>gridspacing</u>?
              Given a window x-coordinate in the canvas <u>screenx</u>, this command returns  the  canvas  x-coordinate
              that  is  displayed  at that location.  If <u>gridspacing</u> is specified, then the canvas coordinate is
              rounded to the nearest multiple of <u>gridspacing</u> units.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>canvasy</b> <u>screeny</u> ?<u>gridspacing</u>?
              Given a window y-coordinate in the canvas <u>screeny</u> this command  returns  the  canvas  y-coordinate
              that  is  displayed  at that location.  If <u>gridspacing</u> is specified, then the canvas coordinate is
              rounded to the nearest multiple of <u>gridspacing</u> units.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>cget</b> <u>option</u>
              Returns the current value of the configuration option given by <u>option</u>.  <u>Option</u> may have any of the
              values accepted by the <b>canvas</b> command.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>configure</b> <b>?</b><u>option</u>? ?<u>value</u>? ?<u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>...</u>?
              Query or modify the configuration options of the widget.  If no <u>option</u>  is  specified,  returns  a
              list describing all of the available options for <u>pathName</u> (see <b>Tk_ConfigureInfo</b> for information on
              the  format  of  this list). If <u>option</u> is specified with no <u>value</u>, then the command returns a list
              describing the one named option (this list will be identical to the corresponding sublist  of  the
              value  returned  if no <u>option</u> is specified). If one or more <u>option-value</u> pairs are specified, then
              the command modifies the given widget option(s) to have the  given  value(s);  in  this  case  the
              command  returns  an  empty  string.   <u>Option</u>  may  have  any of the values accepted by the <b>canvas</b>
              command.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>coords</b> <u>tagOrId</u> ?<u>x0</u> <u>y0</u> <u>...</u>?

       <u>pathName</u> <b>coords</b> <u>tagOrId</u> ?<u>coordList</u>?
              Query or modify the coordinates that define an  item.   If  no  coordinates  are  specified,  this
              command  returns  a  list  whose  elements  are  the coordinates of the item named by <u>tagOrId</u>.  If
              coordinates are specified, then they replace the current  coordinates  for  the  named  item.   If
              <u>tagOrId</u> refers to multiple items, then the first one in the display list is used.

              Note  that  for  rectangles,  ovals  and  arcs the returned list of coordinates has a fixed order,
              namely the left, top, right and bottom coordinates, which may not be the order  originally  given.
              Also the coordinates are always returned in screen units with no units (that is, in pixels). So if
              the original coordinates were specified for instance in centimeters or inches, the returned values
              will nevertheless be in pixels.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>create</b> <u>type</u> <u>x</u> <u>y</u> ?<u>x</u> <u>y</u> <u>...</u>? ?<u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>...</u>?

       <u>pathName</u> <b>create</b> <u>type</u> <u>coordList</u> ?<u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>...</u>?
              Create  a new item in <u>pathName</u> of type <u>type</u>.  The exact format of the arguments after <u>type</u> depends
              on <u>type</u>, but usually they consist  of  the  coordinates  for  one  or  more  points,  followed  by
              specifications  for zero or more item options.  See the subsections on individual item types below
              for more on the syntax of this command.  This command returns the id for the new item.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>dchars</b> <u>tagOrId</u> <u>first</u> ?<u>last</u>?
              For each item given by <u>tagOrId</u>, delete the characters, or coordinates, in the range given by <u>first</u>
              and <u>last</u>, inclusive.  If some of the items given by <u>tagOrId</u> do  not  support  indexing  operations
              then  they  ignore this operation.  Text items interpret <u>first</u> and <u>last</u> as indices to a character,
              line and polygon items interpret them as indices to a  coordinate  (an  x,y  pair).   Indices  are
              described  in  <b>INDICES</b>  above.  If <u>last</u> is omitted, it defaults to <u>first</u>.  This command returns an
              empty string.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>delete</b> ?<u>tagOrId</u> <u>tagOrId</u> <u>...</u>?
              Delete each of the items given by each <u>tagOrId</u>, and return an empty string.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>dtag</b> <u>tagOrId</u> ?<u>tagToDelete</u>?
              For each of the items given by <u>tagOrId</u>, delete the tag given by <u>tagToDelete</u> from the list of those
              associated with the item.  If an item  does  not  have  the  tag  <u>tagToDelete</u>  then  the  item  is
              unaffected  by  the command.  If <u>tagToDelete</u> is omitted then it defaults to <u>tagOrId</u>.  This command
              returns an empty string.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>find</b> <u>searchCommand</u> ?<u>arg</u> <u>...</u>?
              This command returns a list consisting of all the items that meet  the  constraints  specified  by
              <u>searchCommand</u>  and  <u>arg</u>'s.   <u>SearchCommand</u>  and  <u>args</u> have any of the forms accepted by the <b>addtag</b>
              command.  The items are returned in stacking order, with the lowest item first.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>focus</b> ?<u>tagOrId</u>?
              Set the keyboard focus for the canvas widget to the item given by <u>tagOrId</u>.  If <u>tagOrId</u>  refers  to
              several  items, then the focus is set to the first such item in the display list that supports the
              insertion cursor.  If <u>tagOrId</u> does not refer to  any  items,  or  if  none  of  them  support  the
              insertion  cursor,  then  the focus is not changed.  If <u>tagOrId</u> is an empty string, then the focus
              item is reset so that no item has the focus.  If <u>tagOrId</u> is not specified then the command returns
              the id for the item that currently has the focus, or an empty string if no item has the focus.

              Once the focus has been set to an item, the  item  will  display  the  insertion  cursor  and  all
              keyboard  events  will  be  directed  to  that item.  The focus item within a canvas and the focus
              window on the screen (set with the <b>focus</b> command) are totally independent: a given item  does  not
              actually  have  the  input focus unless (a) its canvas is the focus window and (b) the item is the
              focus item within the canvas.  In most cases it is advisable to follow the  <b>focus</b>  widget  command
              with the <b>focus</b> command to set the focus window to the canvas (if it was not there already).

       <u>pathName</u> <b>gettags</b> <u>tagOrId</u>
              Return  a  list whose elements are the tags associated with the item given by <u>tagOrId</u>.  If <u>tagOrId</u>
              refers to more than one item, then the tags are returned from the first such item in  the  display
              list.   If  <u>tagOrId</u>  does  not  refer to any items, or if the item contains no tags, then an empty
              string is returned.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>icursor</b> <u>tagOrId</u> <u>index</u>
              Set the position of the insertion cursor for the item(s) given  by  <u>tagOrId</u>  to  just  before  the
              character  whose  position is given by <u>index</u>.  If some or all of the items given by <u>tagOrId</u> do not
              support an insertion cursor then this command has no effect on them.   See  <b>INDICES</b>  above  for  a
              description of the legal forms for <u>index</u>.

              Note  that  the  insertion  cursor  is  only  displayed  in an item if that item currently has the
              keyboard focus (see the <b>focus</b> widget command, above), but the cursor position may be set even when
              the item does not have the focus.

              This command returns an empty string.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>image</b> <u>imagename</u> ?<u>subsample</u>? ?<u>zoom</u>?
              Draw the canvas into the Tk photo image named <u>imagename</u>.  If a <b>-scrollregion</b> has been defined then
              this will be the boundaries of the canvas region drawn and the final  size  of  the  photo  image.
              Otherwise  the widget width and height with an origin of 0,0 will be the size of the canvas region
              drawn and the final size of the photo image. Optionally an integer <u>subsample</u> factor may  be  given
              and the photo image will be reduced in size.

              In  addition to the <u>subsample</u> an integer <u>zoom</u> factor can also be given and the photo image will be
              enlarged. The image background will be filled with the canvas background colour. The canvas widget
              does not need to be mapped for this widget command to work, but at least  one  of  it's  ancestors
              must be mapped.

              This command returns an empty string.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>imove</b> <u>tagOrId</u> <u>index</u> <u>x</u> <u>y</u>
              This  command  causes  the  <u>index</u>'th  coordinate  of  each of the items indicated by <u>tagOrId</u> to be
              relocated to the location (<u>x</u>,<u>y</u>).  Each item interprets <u>index</u> independently according to the  rules
              described in <b>INDICES</b> above. Out of the standard set of items, only line and polygon items may have
              their coordinates relocated this way.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>index</b> <u>tagOrId</u> <u>index</u>
              This  command  returns a decimal string giving the numerical index within <u>tagOrId</u> corresponding to
              <u>index</u>.  <u>Index</u> gives a textual description of the desired position as described in  <b>INDICES</b>  above.
              Text  items  interpret <u>index</u> as an index to a character, line and polygon items interpret it as an
              index to a coordinate (an x,y pair).  The return value is guaranteed to  lie  between  0  and  the
              number  of  characters, or coordinates, within the item, inclusive.  If <u>tagOrId</u> refers to multiple
              items, then the index is processed in the first of these items that supports  indexing  operations
              (in display list order).

       <u>pathName</u> <b>insert</b> <u>tagOrId</u> <u>beforeThis</u> <u>string</u>
              For  each  of  the items given by <u>tagOrId</u>, if the item supports text or coordinate, insertion then
              <u>string</u> is inserted into the item's text just before the character, or coordinate, whose  index  is
              <u>beforeThis</u>.   Text  items  interpret <u>beforeThis</u> as an index to a character, line and polygon items
              interpret it as an index to a coordinate (an x,y pair).  For lines and polygons the <u>string</u> must be
              a valid coordinate sequence.

              See <b>INDICES</b> above for information about the forms allowed for <u>beforeThis</u>.

              This command returns an empty string.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>itemcget</b> <u>tagOrId</u> <u>option</u>
              Returns the current value of the configuration option for the item given by <u>tagOrId</u> whose name  is
              <u>option</u>.  This command is similar to the <b>cget</b> widget command except that it applies to a particular
              item  rather than the widget as a whole.  <u>Option</u> may have any of the values accepted by the <b>create</b>
              widget command when the item was created.  If <u>tagOrId</u> is a tag that refers to more than one  item,
              the first (lowest) such item is used.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>itemconfigure</b> <u>tagOrId</u> ?<u>option</u>? ?<u>value</u>? ?<u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>...</u>?
              This  command  is  similar  to  the <b>configure</b> widget command except that it modifies item-specific
              options for the items given by <u>tagOrId</u> instead of modifying options for the overall canvas widget.
              If no <u>option</u> is specified, returns a list describing all of the available options  for  the  first
              item given by <u>tagOrId</u> (see <b>Tk_ConfigureInfo</b> for information on the format of this list). If <u>option</u>
              is  specified with no <u>value</u>, then the command returns a list describing the one named option (this
              list will be identical to the corresponding  sublist  of  the  value  returned  if  no  <u>option</u>  is
              specified).  If  one or more <u>option-value</u> pairs are specified, then the command modifies the given
              widget option(s) to have the given value(s) in each of the items given by <u>tagOrId</u>;  in  this  case
              the  command returns an empty string.  The <u>option</u>s and <u>value</u>s are the same as those permissible in
              the <b>create</b> widget command when the item(s) were created; see the  sections  describing  individual
              item types below for details on the legal options.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>lower</b> <u>tagOrId</u> ?<u>belowThis</u>?
              Move  all of the items given by <u>tagOrId</u> to a new position in the display list just before the item
              given by <u>belowThis</u>.  If <u>tagOrId</u> refers to more than one item then all are moved but  the  relative
              order of the moved items will not be changed.  <u>BelowThis</u> is a tag or id; if it refers to more than
              one  item  then  the  first (lowest) of these items in the display list is used as the destination
              location for the moved items.  Note that this command has no effect on window items. Window  items
              always obscure other item types, and the stacking order of window items is determined by the <b>raise</b>
              command  and  <b>lower</b>  command,  not the <b>raise</b> widget command and <b>lower</b> widget command for canvases.
              This command returns an empty string.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>move</b> <u>tagOrId</u> <u>xAmount</u> <u>yAmount</u>
              Move each of the items given by <u>tagOrId</u> in the canvas coordinate space by adding <u>xAmount</u> to the x-
              coordinate of each point associated with the item and <u>yAmount</u> to the y-coordinate  of  each  point
              associated with the item.  This command returns an empty string.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>moveto</b> <u>tagOrId</u> <u>xPos</u> <u>yPos</u>
              Move  the  items given by <u>tagOrId</u> in the canvas coordinate space so that the first coordinate pair
              (the upper-left corner of the bounding box) of the first item (the lowest  in  the  display  list)
              with  tag  <u>tagOrId</u>  is  located at position (<u>xPos</u>,<u>yPos</u>). <u>xPos</u> and <u>yPos</u> may be the empty string, in
              which case the corresponding coordinate will be unchanged. All items matching  <u>tagOrId</u>  remain  in
              the same positions relative to each other.  This command returns an empty string.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>postscript</b> ?<u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>...</u>?
              Generate  a  Postscript  representation  for  part  or  all of the canvas.  If the <b>-file</b> option is
              specified then the Postscript is written to a file and an empty string is returned; otherwise  the
              Postscript  is  returned as the result of the command.  If the interpreter that owns the canvas is
              marked as safe, the operation will fail because safe interpreters are not allowed to write  files.
              If the <b>-channel</b> option is specified, the argument denotes the name of a channel already opened for
              writing.  The  Postscript  is  written  to  that channel, and the channel is left open for further
              writing at the end of the operation.  The Postscript is created in  Encapsulated  Postscript  form
              using  version  3.0  of the Document Structuring Conventions.  Note: by default Postscript is only
              generated for information that appears in the canvas's window on the  screen.  If  the  canvas  is
              freshly  created  it  may  still  have its initial size of 1x1 pixel so nothing will appear in the
              Postscript. To get around this problem either invoke the <b>update</b> command to  wait  for  the  canvas
              window  to reach its final size, or else use the <b>-width</b> and <b>-height</b> options to specify the area of
              the canvas to print.  The <u>option</u>-<u>value</u> argument pairs provide additional  information  to  control
              the generation of Postscript. The following options are supported:

              <b>-channel</b> <u>channelName</u>
                     Specifies the name of the channel to which to write the Postscript.  If this option and the
                     <b>-file</b>  option  are  not  specified  then  the  Postscript  is returned as the result of the
                     command.

              <b>-colormap</b> <u>varName</u>
                     <u>VarName</u> must be the name of an array variable that specifies a color mapping to use in  the
                     Postscript.   Each  element  of <u>varName</u> must consist of Postscript code to set a particular
                     color value (e.g.  “<b>1.0</b> <b>1.0</b> <b>0.0</b> <b>setrgbcolor</b>”).  When outputting color  information  in  the
                     Postscript,  Tk  checks  to see if there is an element of <u>varName</u> with the same name as the
                     color.  If so, Tk uses the value of the element as the Postscript command to set the color.

                     If this option has not been specified, or if there is no  entry  in  <u>varName</u>  for  a  given
                     color, then Tk uses the red, green, and blue intensities from the X color.

              <b>-colormode</b> <u>mode</u>
                     Specifies  how  to  output  color  information.  <u>Mode</u>  must be either <b>color</b> (for full color
                     output), <b>gray</b> (convert all colors to their gray-scale equivalents)  or  <b>mono</b>  (convert  all
                     colors to black or white).

              <b>-file</b> <u>fileName</u>
                     Specifies  the  name  of the file in which to write the Postscript.  If this option and the
                     <b>-channel</b> option are not specified then the Postscript is returned  as  the  result  of  the
                     command.

              <b>-fontmap</b> <u>varName</u>
                     <u>VarName</u>  must  be the name of an array variable that specifies a font mapping to use in the
                     Postscript.  Each element of <u>varName</u> must consist of a Tcl list with  two  elements,  which
                     are  the name and point size of a Postscript font.  When outputting Postscript commands for
                     a particular font, Tk checks to see if <u>varName</u> contains an element with the  same  name  as
                     the font.  If there is such an element, then the font information contained in that element
                     is  used  in  the  Postscript.  Otherwise Tk attempts to guess what Postscript font to use.
                     Tk's guesses generally only work for well-known fonts  such  as  Times  and  Helvetica  and
                     Courier, and only if the X font name does not omit any dashes up through the point size.

                     For  example,  <b>-*-Courier-Bold-R-Normal--*-120-*</b>  will work but <b>*Courier-Bold-R-Normal*120*</b>
                     will not; Tk needs the dashes to parse the font name).

              <b>-height</b> <u>size</u>
                     Specifies the height of the area of the canvas to print.  Defaults to  the  height  of  the
                     canvas window.

              <b>-pageanchor</b> <u>anchor</u>
                     Specifies  which point of the printed area of the canvas should appear over the positioning
                     point on the page (which is given by the <b>-pagex</b> and <b>-pagey</b> options).

                     For example, <b>-pageanchor</b> <b>n</b> means that the top center  of  the  area  of  the  canvas  being
                     printed (as it appears in the canvas window) should be over the positioning point. Defaults
                     to <b>center</b>.

              <b>-pageheight</b> <u>size</u>
                     Specifies  that the Postscript should be scaled in both x and y so that the printed area is
                     <u>size</u> high on the Postscript page.  <u>Size</u> consists of a floating-point number followed  by  <b>c</b>
                     for  centimeters,  <b>i</b>  for  inches,  <b>m</b> for millimeters, or <b>p</b> or nothing for printer's points
                     (1/72 inch).  Defaults to  the  height  of  the  printed  area  on  the  screen.   If  both
                     <b>-pageheight</b>  and  <b>-pagewidth</b>  are  specified  then the scale factor from <b>-pagewidth</b> is used
                     (non-uniform scaling is not implemented).

              <b>-pagewidth</b> <u>size</u>
                     Specifies that the Postscript should be scaled in both x and y so that the printed area  is
                     <u>size</u>  wide on the Postscript page.  <u>Size</u> has the same form as for <b>-pageheight</b>.  Defaults to
                     the width of the printed area on the  screen.   If  both  <b>-pageheight</b>  and  <b>-pagewidth</b>  are
                     specified  then  the  scale  factor  from  <b>-pagewidth</b>  is  used (non-uniform scaling is not
                     implemented).

              <b>-pagex</b> <u>position</u>
                     <u>Position</u> gives the x-coordinate of the positioning point on the Postscript page, using  any
                     of  the forms allowed for <b>-pageheight</b>.  Used in conjunction with the <b>-pagey</b> and <b>-pageanchor</b>
                     options to determine where the printed area appears on the Postscript  page.   Defaults  to
                     the center of the page.

              <b>-pagey</b> <u>position</u>
                     <u>Position</u>  gives the y-coordinate of the positioning point on the Postscript page, using any
                     of the forms allowed for <b>-pageheight</b>.  Used in conjunction with the <b>-pagex</b> and  <b>-pageanchor</b>
                     options  to  determine  where the printed area appears on the Postscript page.  Defaults to
                     the center of the page.

              <b>-rotate</b> <u>boolean</u>
                     <u>Boolean</u> specifies whether the printed area is to be rotated  90  degrees.   In  non-rotated
                     output  the  x-axis  of  the  printed  area  runs  along  the  short  dimension of the page
                     (“portrait” orientation); in rotated output the x-axis runs along the long dimension of the
                     page (“landscape” orientation).  Defaults to non-rotated.

              <b>-width</b> <u>size</u>
                     Specifies the width of the area of the canvas to print.   Defaults  to  the  width  of  the
                     canvas window.

              <b>-x</b> <u>position</u>
                     Specifies  the  x-coordinate  of  the  left  edge  of  the area of the canvas that is to be
                     printed, in canvas coordinates, not window coordinates.  Defaults to the coordinate of  the
                     left edge of the window.

              <b>-y</b> <u>position</u>
                     Specifies the y-coordinate of the top edge of the area of the canvas that is to be printed,
                     in  canvas coordinates, not window coordinates.  Defaults to the coordinate of the top edge
                     of the window.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>raise</b> <u>tagOrId</u> ?<u>aboveThis</u>?
              Move all of the items given by <u>tagOrId</u> to a new position in the display list just after  the  item
              given  by  <u>aboveThis</u>.  If <u>tagOrId</u> refers to more than one item then all are moved but the relative
              order of the moved items will not be changed.  <u>AboveThis</u> is a tag or id; if it refers to more than
              one item then the last (topmost) of these items in the display list is  used  as  the  destination
              location for the moved items.  This command returns an empty string.

              Note  this  this  command  has  no  effect on window items. Window items always obscure other item
              types, and the stacking order of window items  is  determined  by  the  <b>raise</b>  command  and  <b>lower</b>
              command, not the <b>raise</b> widget command and <b>lower</b> widget command for canvases.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>rchars</b> <u>tagOrId</u> <u>first</u> <u>last</u> <u>string</u>
              This command causes the text or coordinates between <u>first</u> and <u>last</u> for each of the items indicated
              by  <u>tagOrId</u>  to be replaced by <u>string</u>. Each item interprets <u>first</u> and <u>last</u> independently according
              to the rules described in <b>INDICES</b> above. Out of the standard set of items, text items support this
              operation by altering their text as directed, and line and polygon items support this operation by
              altering their coordinate list (in which case <u>string</u> should be a list of coordinates to use  as  a
              replacement). The other items ignore this operation.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>rotate</b> <u>tagOrId</u> <u>xOrigin</u> <u>yOrigin</u> <u>angle</u>
              Rotate  the  coordinates of all of the items given by <u>tagOrId</u> in canvas coordinate space.  <u>XOrigin</u> 2
              and <u>yOrigin</u> identify the origin for the rotation operation and  <u>angle</u>  identifies  the  amount  to 2
              rotate  the  coordinates  anticlockwise,  in  degrees.  (Negative  values rotate clockwise.)  This 2
              command returns an empty string.                                                                   2

              Implementation note: not all item types work the  same  with  rotations.  In  particular,  <b>bitmap</b>, 2
              <b>image</b>,  <b>text</b>  and  <b>window</b>  items  only  rotate  their  anchor  points  and do not rotate the items 2
              themselves about those points, and the <b>arc</b>, <b>oval</b> and  <b>rectangle</b>  types  rotate  about  a  computed 2
              center point instead of moving the bounding box coordinates directly.                              2

              Some  items  (currently  <b>arc</b>  and <b>text</b>) have angles in their options; this command <u>does</u> <u>not</u> affect 2
              those options.                                                                                     2

       <u>pathName</u> <b>scale</b> <u>tagOrId</u> <u>xOrigin</u> <u>yOrigin</u> <u>xScale</u> <u>yScale</u>
              Rescale the coordinates of all of the items given by <u>tagOrId</u> in canvas coordinate space.   <u>XOrigin</u>
              and <u>yOrigin</u> identify the origin for the scaling operation and <u>xScale</u> and <u>yScale</u> identify the scale
              factors  for  x-  and y-coordinates, respectively (a scale factor of 1.0 implies no change to that
              coordinate).  For each of the points defining each item, the x-coordinate is  adjusted  to  change
              the  distance  from  <u>xOrigin</u>  by  a factor of <u>xScale</u>.  Similarly, each y-coordinate is adjusted to
              change the distance from <u>yOrigin</u> by a factor of <u>yScale</u>.  This command returns an empty string.

              Note that some items have only a single pair of coordinates (e.g., text, images and  windows)  and
              so scaling of them by this command can only move them around.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>scan</b> <u>option</u> <u>args</u>
              This command is used to implement scanning on canvases. It has two forms, depending on <u>option</u>:

              <u>pathName</u> <b>scan</b> <b>mark</b> <u>x</u> <u>y</u>
                     Records  <u>x</u>  and <u>y</u> and the canvas's current view; used in conjunction with later <b>scan</b> <b>dragto</b>
                     commands.  Typically this command is associated with a mouse button press in the widget and
                     <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> are the coordinates of the mouse. It returns an empty string.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>scan</b> <b>dragto</b> <u>x</u> <u>y</u> <u>?gain?</u>
                     This command computes the difference between its <u>x</u> and <u>y</u>  arguments  (which  are  typically
                     mouse  coordinates) and the <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> arguments to the last <b>scan</b> <b>mark</b> command for the widget.
                     It then adjusts the view by <u>gain</u> times the difference in coordinates, where  <u>gain</u>  defaults
                     to  10.   This  command  is typically associated with mouse motion events in the widget, to
                     produce the effect of dragging the canvas at high speed  through  its  window.  The  return
                     value is an empty string.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>select</b> <u>option</u> ?<u>tagOrId</u> <u>arg</u>?
              Manipulates  the  selection in one of several ways, depending on <u>option</u>.  The command may take any
              of the forms described below.  In all of the descriptions below, <u>tagOrId</u> must  refer  to  an  item
              that  supports indexing and selection; if it refers to multiple items then the first of these that
              supports indexing and the selection is used.  <u>Index</u> gives a  textual  description  of  a  position
              within <u>tagOrId</u>, as described in <b>INDICES</b> above.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>select</b> <b>adjust</b> <u>tagOrId</u> <u>index</u>
                     Locate  the  end  of  the selection in <u>tagOrId</u> nearest to the character given by <u>index</u>, and
                     adjust that end of the selection to be at  <u>index</u>  (i.e.  including  but  not  going  beyond
                     <u>index</u>).   The  other  end  of  the  selection is made the anchor point for future <b>select</b> <b>to</b>
                     commands.  If the selection is not currently in <u>tagOrId</u> then this command behaves the  same
                     as the <b>select</b> <b>to</b> widget command.  Returns an empty string.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>select</b> <b>clear</b>
                     Clear  the  selection if it is in this widget.  If the selection is not in this widget then
                     the command has no effect.  Returns an empty string.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>select</b> <b>from</b> <u>tagOrId</u> <u>index</u>
                     Set the selection anchor point for the widget to be just  before  the  character  given  by
                     <u>index</u>  in  the  item given by <u>tagOrId</u>.  This command does not change the selection; it just
                     sets the fixed end of the selection for  future  <b>select</b>  <b>to</b>  commands.   Returns  an  empty
                     string.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>select</b> <b>item</b>
                     Returns the id of the selected item, if the selection is in an item in this canvas.  If the
                     selection is not in this canvas then an empty string is returned.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>select</b> <b>to</b> <u>tagOrId</u> <u>index</u>
                     Set  the  selection  to consist of those characters of <u>tagOrId</u> between the selection anchor
                     point and <u>index</u>.  The new selection will include the character  given  by  <u>index</u>;  it  will
                     include  the  character given by the anchor point only if <u>index</u> is greater than or equal to
                     the anchor point.  The anchor point is determined by  the  most  recent  <b>select</b>  <b>adjust</b>  or
                     <b>select</b>  <b>from</b>  command for this widget.  If the selection anchor point for the widget is not
                     currently in <u>tagOrId</u>, then it is set to the same character  given  by  <u>index</u>.   Returns  an
                     empty string.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>type</b> <u>tagOrId</u>
              Returns  the  type  of the item given by <u>tagOrId</u>, such as <b>rectangle</b> or <b>text</b>.  If <u>tagOrId</u> refers to
              more than one item, then the type of the first item in the display list is returned.   If  <u>tagOrId</u>
              does not refer to any items at all then an empty string is returned.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>xview</b> ?<u>args</u>?
              This  command  is used to query and change the horizontal position of the information displayed in
              the canvas's window.  It can take any of the following forms:

              <u>pathName</u> <b>xview</b>
                     Returns a list containing two elements.  Each element is a real fraction between 0  and  1;
                     together  they describe the horizontal span that is visible in the window.  For example, if
                     the first element is .2 and the second element is .6, 20% of the canvas's area (as  defined
                     by  the  <b>-scrollregion</b>  option) is off-screen to the left, the middle 40% is visible in the
                     window, and 40% of the canvas is off-screen to the right.  These are the same values passed
                     to scrollbars via the <b>-xscrollcommand</b> option.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>xview</b> <b>moveto</b> <u>fraction</u>
                     Adjusts the view in the window so that <u>fraction</u> of the total width of the  canvas  is  off-
                     screen to the left.  <u>Fraction</u> must be a fraction between 0 and 1.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>xview</b> <b>scroll</b> <u>number</u> <u>what</u>
                     This  command  shifts  the  view  in the window left or right according to <u>number</u> and <u>what</u>.
                     <u>Number</u> must be an integer or a float, but if it is a float  then  it  is  converted  to  an
                     integer, rounded away from 0.  <u>What</u> must be either <b>pages</b> or <b>units</b> or an abbreviation of one
                     of  these.   If  <u>what</u>  <u>is</u>  <b>pages</b> then the view adjusts in units of nine-tenths the window's
                     width.  If <u>number</u> is negative then information farther to the left becomes visible;  if  it
                     is  positive  then information farther to the right becomes visible.  If <u>what</u> is <b>units</b>, the
                     view adjusts left or right in units of the <b>xScrollIncrement</b> option, if it is  greater  than
                     zero, or in units of one-tenth the window's width otherwise.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>yview</b> <b>?</b><u>args</u>?
              This command is used to query and change the vertical position of the information displayed in the
              canvas's window.  It can take any of the following forms:

              <u>pathName</u> <b>yview</b>
                     Returns  a  list containing two elements.  Each element is a real fraction between 0 and 1;
                     together they describe the vertical span that is visible in the window.   For  example,  if
                     the  first element is .6 and the second element is 1.0, the lowest 40% of the canvas's area
                     (as defined by the <b>-scrollregion</b> option) is visible in the  window.   These  are  the  same
                     values passed to scrollbars via the <b>-yscrollcommand</b> option.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>yview</b> <b>moveto</b> <u>fraction</u>
                     Adjusts  the  view in the window so that <u>fraction</u> of the canvas's area is off-screen to the
                     top.  <u>Fraction</u> is a fraction between 0 and 1.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>yview</b> <b>scroll</b> <u>number</u> <u>what</u>
                     This command adjusts the view in the window up  or  down  according  to  <u>number</u>  and  <u>what</u>.
                     <u>Number</u>  must  be  an  integer  or  a float, but if it is a float then it is converted to an
                     integer, rounded away from 0.  <u>What</u> must be either <b>pages</b> or <b>units</b>.  If <u>what</u> is  <b>pages</b>  then
                     the  view  adjusts in units of nine-tenths the window's height.  If <u>number</u> is negative then
                     higher information becomes visible; if  it  is  positive  then  lower  information  becomes
                     visible.   If  <u>what</u>  is <b>units</b>, the view adjusts up or down in units of the <b>yScrollIncrement</b>
                     option, if it is greater than zero, or in units of one-tenth the window's height otherwise.

</pre><h4><b>OVERVIEW</b> <b>OF</b> <b>ITEM</b> <b>TYPES</b></h4><pre>
       The sections below describe the various types of items supported by canvas widgets.  Each  item  type  is
       characterized  by two things: first, the form of the <b>create</b> command used to create instances of the type;
       and second, a set of configuration options for items of that type, which may be used in  the  <b>create</b>  and
       <b>itemconfigure</b>  widget  commands.  Most items do not support indexing or selection or the commands related
       to them, such as <b>index</b> and <b>insert</b>.  Where items do support these facilities, it is  noted  explicitly  in
       the  descriptions  below.   At present, text, line and polygon items provide this support.  For lines and
       polygons the indexing facility is used to manipulate the coordinates of the item.

   <b>COMMON</b> <b>ITEM</b> <b>OPTIONS</b>
       Many items share a common set of options. These options are explained here, and then referred to be  each
       widget type for brevity.

       <b>-anchor</b> <u>anchorPos</u>
              <u>AnchorPos</u>  tells  how  to position the item relative to the positioning point for the item; it may
              have any of the forms accepted by <b>Tk_GetAnchor</b>. For example, if <u>anchorPos</u> is <b>center</b> then the  item
              is  centered  on  the  point; if <u>anchorPos</u> is <b>n</b> then the item will be drawn so that its top center
              point is at the positioning point.  This option defaults to <b>center</b>.

       <b>-dash</b> <u>pattern</u>

       <b>-activedash</b> <u>pattern</u>

       <b>-disableddash</b> <u>pattern</u>
              These options specify dash patterns for the normal, active state, and disabled state of  an  item.
              <u>pattern</u>  may  have  any of the forms accepted by <b>Tk_GetDash</b>.  If the dash options are omitted then
              the default is a solid outline.  See <b>DASH</b> <b>PATTERNS</b> for more information.

       <b>-dashoffset</b> <u>offset</u>
              The starting <u>offset</u> in pixels into the pattern  provided  by  the  <b>-dash</b>  option.  <b>-dashoffset</b>  is
              ignored  if  there  is  no  <b>-dash</b>  pattern.  The <u>offset</u> may have any of the forms described in the
              <b>COORDINATES</b> section above.

       <b>-fill</b> <u>color</u>

       <b>-activefill</b> <u>color</u>

       <b>-disabledfill</b> <u>color</u>
              These options specify the color to be used to fill  item's  area.   in  its  normal,  active,  and
              disabled  states.   The  even-odd  fill rule is used.  <u>Color</u> may have any of the forms accepted by
              <b>Tk_GetColor</b>.  For the line item, it specifies the color of the line drawn.  For the text item,  it
              specifies  the  foreground  color  of  the text.  If <u>color</u> is an empty string (the default for all
              canvas items except line and text), then the item will not be filled.

       <b>-outline</b> <u>color</u>

       <b>-activeoutline</b> <u>color</u>

       <b>-disabledoutline</b> <u>color</u>
              These options specify the color that should be used to draw the outline of the item in its normal,
              active and disabled states.  <u>Color</u> may have any of the forms accepted by <b>Tk_GetColor</b>.  If <u>color</u> is
              specified as an empty string then no outline is drawn for the item.

       <b>-offset</b> <u>offset</u>
              Specifies the offset of stipples. The offset value can be of the form <b>x,y</b> or <u>side</u>, where side  can
              be  <b>n</b>,  <b>ne</b>,  <b>e</b>,  <b>se</b>,  <b>s</b>,  <b>sw</b>,  <b>w</b>, <b>nw</b>, or <b>center</b>. In the first case the origin is the origin of the
              toplevel of the current window.  For the canvas itself and canvas objects the origin is the canvas
              origin, but putting <b>#</b> in front of the coordinate pair indicates using the toplevel origin instead.
              For canvas objects, the <b>-offset</b> option is used for stippling as well. For  the  line  and  polygon
              canvas  items  you can also specify an index as argument, which connects the stipple origin to one
              of the coordinate points of the line/polygon. Note that stipple offsets are <u>only</u> <u>supported</u> <u>on</u> <u>X11</u>;
              they are silently ignored on other platforms.

       <b>-outlinestipple</b> <u>bitmap</u>

       <b>-activeoutlinestipple</b> <u>bitmap</u>

       <b>-disabledoutlinestipple</b> <u>bitmap</u>
              These options specify stipple patterns that should be used to draw the outline of the item in  its
              normal,  active and disabled states.  Indicates that the outline for the item should be drawn with
              a stipple pattern; <u>bitmap</u> specifies the stipple pattern to use, in any of the  forms  accepted  by
              <b>Tk_GetBitmap</b>.   If  the <b>-outline</b> option has not been specified then this option has no effect.  If
              <u>bitmap</u> is an empty string (the default), then the outline is drawn in a solid fashion.  <u>Note</u>  <u>that</u>
              <u>stipples</u> <u>are</u> <u>not</u> <u>well</u> <u>supported</u> <u>on</u> <u>platforms</u> <u>that</u> <u>do</u> <u>not</u> <u>use</u> <u>X11</u> <u>as</u> <u>their</u> <u>drawing</u> <u>API.</u>

       <b>-outlineoffset</b> <u>offset</u>
              Specifies  the  offset of the stipple pattern used for outlines, in the same way that the <b>-outline</b>
              option controls fill stipples. (See the <b>-outline</b>  option  for  a  description  of  the  syntax  of
              <u>offset</u>.)

       <b>-stipple</b> <u>bitmap</u>

       <b>-activestipple</b> <u>bitmap</u>

       <b>-disabledstipple</b> <u>bitmap</u>
              These  options specify stipple patterns that should be used to fill the item in its normal, active
              and disabled states.  <u>bitmap</u> specifies the stipple pattern to use, in any of the forms accepted by
              <b>Tk_GetBitmap</b>.  If the <b>-fill</b> option has not been specified then this  option  has  no  effect.   If
              <u>bitmap</u>  is  an  empty string (the default), then filling is done in a solid fashion.  For the text
              item, it affects the actual text.  <u>Note</u> <u>that</u> <u>stipples</u> <u>are</u> <u>not</u> <u>well</u> <u>supported</u> <u>on</u> <u>platforms</u> <u>that</u>  <u>do</u>
              <u>not</u> <u>use</u> <u>X11</u> <u>as</u> <u>their</u> <u>drawing</u> <u>API.</u>

       <b>-state</b> <u>state</u>
              This allows an item to override the canvas widget's global <u>state</u> option. It takes the same values:
              <u>normal</u>, <u>disabled</u> or <u>hidden</u>.

       <b>-tags</b> <u>tagList</u>
              Specifies  a  set  of  tags  to apply to the item.  <u>TagList</u> consists of a list of tag names, which
              replace any existing tags for the item. <u>TagList</u> may be an empty list.

       <b>-width</b> <u>outlineWidth</u>

       <b>-activewidth</b> <u>outlineWidth</u>

       <b>-disabledwidth</b> <u>outlineWidth</u>
              These options specify the width of the outline to be  drawn  around  the  item's  region,  in  its
              normal,  active  and  disabled  states.   <u>outlineWidth</u> may be in any of the forms described in the
              <b>COORDINATES</b> section above.  If the <b>-outline</b> option has been specified as an empty string then this
              option has no effect. This option defaults to 1.0.  For arcs, wide outlines will be drawn centered
              on the edges of the arc's region.

</pre><h4><b>STANDARD</b> <b>ITEM</b> <b>TYPES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>ARC</b> <b>ITEMS</b>
       Items of type <b>arc</b> appear on the display as arc-shaped regions.  An arc is a section of an oval  delimited
       by two angles (specified by either the <b>-start</b> and <b>-extent</b> options or the <b>-height</b> option) and displayed in
       one  of  several  ways  (specified  by  the <b>-style</b> option).  Arcs are created with widget commands of the
       following form:
              <u>pathName</u> <b>create</b> <b>arc</b> <u>x1</u> <u>y1</u> <u>x2</u> <u>y2</u> ?<u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>...</u>?
              <u>pathName</u> <b>create</b> <b>arc</b> <u>coordList</u> ?<u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>...</u>?
       The arguments <u>x1</u>, <u>y1</u>, <u>x2</u>, and <u>y2</u> or <u>coordList</u> give the coordinates of two diagonally opposite corners  of
       a  rectangular  region  enclosing  the  oval that defines the arc (except when <b>-height</b> is specified - see
       below).  After the coordinates there may be any number of <u>option</u>-<u>value</u> pairs, each of which sets  one  of
       the configuration options for the item. These same <u>option</u>-<u>value</u> pairs may be used in <b>itemconfigure</b> widget
       commands  to change the item's configuration. An arc item becomes the current item when the mouse pointer
       is over any part that is painted or (when fully transparent) that would be painted if both the <b>-fill</b>  and
       <b>-outline</b> options were non-empty.

       The following standard options are supported by arcs:

              <b>-dash</b>                         <b>-activedash</b>
              <b>-disableddash</b>                 <b>-dashoffset</b>
              <b>-fill</b>                         <b>-activefill</b>
              <b>-disabledfill</b>                 <b>-offset</b>
              <b>-outline</b>                      <b>-activeoutline</b>
              <b>-disabledoutline</b>              <b>-outlineoffset</b>
              <b>-outlinestipple</b>               <b>-activeoutlinestipple</b>
              <b>-disabledoutlinestipple</b>       <b>-stipple</b>
              <b>-activestipple</b>                <b>-disabledstipple</b>
              <b>-state</b>                        <b>-tags</b>
              <b>-width</b>                        <b>-activewidth</b>
              <b>-disabledwidth</b>

       The following extra options are supported for arcs:

       <b>-extent</b> <u>degrees</u>
              Specifies  the size of the angular range occupied by the arc.  The arc's range extends for <u>degrees</u>
              degrees counter-clockwise from the starting angle given by the  <b>-start</b>  option.   <u>Degrees</u>  may  be
              negative.   If  it  is  greater than 360 or less than -360, then <u>degrees</u> modulo 360 is used as the
              extent.

       <b>-start</b> <u>degrees</u>
              Specifies the beginning of the angular range occupied by the arc.  <u>Degrees</u> is given  in  units  of
              degrees  measured  counter-clockwise  from  the  3-o'clock  position; it may be either positive or
              negative.

       <b>-height</b> <u>distance</u>
              Provides a shortcut for creating a circular arc segment by defining the distance of the  mid-point
              of  the  arc from its chord. When this option is used the coordinates are interpreted as the start
              and end coordinates of the chord, and the options <b>-start</b> and <b>-extent</b> are ignored.   The  value  of
              <u>distance</u> has the following meaning:

                     <u>distance</u> &gt; 0 creates a clockwise arc
                     <u>distance</u> &lt; 0 creates an counter-clockwise arc
                     <u>distance</u> = 0 creates an arc as if this option had not been specified

              If you want the arc to have a specific radius, <u>r</u>, use the formula:

                     <u>distance</u> = <u>r</u> ± sqrt(<u>r</u>**2 - (chordLength / 2)**2)

              choosing the minus sign for the minor arc and the plus sign for the major arc.

              Note that <b>itemcget</b> <b>-height</b> always returns 0 so that introspection code can be kept simple.

       <b>-style</b> <u>type</u>
              Specifies  how to draw the arc. If <u>type</u> is <b>pieslice</b> (the default) then the arc's region is defined
              by a section of the oval's perimeter plus two line segments, one between the center  of  the  oval
              and  each  end  of  the perimeter section.  If <u>type</u> is <b>chord</b> then the arc's region is defined by a
              section of the oval's perimeter plus a single line segment connecting the two end  points  of  the
              perimeter  section.   If  <u>type</u> is <b>arc</b> then the arc's region consists of a section of the perimeter
              alone.  In this last case the <b>-fill</b> option is ignored.

   <b>BITMAP</b> <b>ITEMS</b>
       Items of type <b>bitmap</b> appear on the display as images with two colors, foreground and background.  Bitmaps
       are created with widget commands of the following form:
              <u>pathName</u> <b>create</b> <b>bitmap</b> <u>x</u> <u>y</u> ?<u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>...</u>?
              <u>pathName</u> <b>create</b> <b>bitmap</b> <u>coordList</u> ?<u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>...</u>?
       The arguments <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> or <u>coordList</u> (which must have two elements) specify the coordinates of a point used
       to position the bitmap on the display, as controlled by the <b>-anchor</b> option.  After the coordinates  there
       may  be  any  number  of  <u>option</u>-<u>value</u> pairs, each of which sets one of the configuration options for the
       item. These same <u>option</u>-<u>value</u> pairs may be used in <b>itemconfigure</b> widget commands  to  change  the  item's
       configuration.  A  bitmap  item  becomes  the current item when the mouse pointer is over any part of its
       bounding box.

       The following standard options are supported by bitmaps:

              <b>-anchor</b>                       <b>-state</b>
              <b>-tags</b>

       The following extra options are supported for bitmaps:

       <b>-background</b> <u>color</u>

       <b>-activebackground</b> <u>color</u>

       <b>-disabledbackground</b> <u>color</u>
              Specifies the color to use for each of the bitmap's “0” valued pixels in its  normal,  active  and
              disabled  states.  <u>Color</u> may have any of the forms accepted by <b>Tk_GetColor</b>.  If this option is not
              specified, or if it is specified as an empty string, then nothing is displayed  where  the  bitmap
              pixels are 0; this produces a transparent effect.

       <b>-bitmap</b> <u>bitmap</u>

       <b>-activebitmap</b> <u>bitmap</u>

       <b>-disabledbitmap</b> <u>bitmap</u>
              These  options  specify  the  bitmaps  to  display  in the item in its normal, active and disabled
              states.  <u>Bitmap</u> may have any of the forms accepted by <b>Tk_GetBitmap</b>.

       <b>-foreground</b> <u>color</u>

       <b>-activeforeground</b> <u>color</u>

       <b>-disabledforeground</b> <u>color</u>
              These options specify the color to use for each of the bitmap's “1” valued pixels in  its  normal,
              active and disabled states.  <u>Color</u> may have any of the forms accepted by <b>Tk_GetColor</b>.

   <b>IMAGE</b> <b>ITEMS</b>
       Items  of  type <b>image</b> are used to display images on a canvas.  Images are created with widget commands of
       the following form:
              <u>pathName</u> <b>create</b> <b>image</b> <u>x</u> <u>y</u> ?<u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>...</u>?
              <u>pathName</u> <b>create</b> <b>image</b> <u>coordList</u> ?<u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>...</u>?
       The arguments <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> or <u>coordList</u> specify the coordinates of a point used to position the image  on  the
       display,  as  controlled  by  the  <b>-anchor</b>  option.   After  the  coordinates  there may be any number of
       <u>option</u>-<u>value</u> pairs, each of which sets one  of  the  configuration  options  for  the  item.  These  same
       <u>option</u>-<u>value</u>  pairs  may  be used in <b>itemconfigure</b> widget commands to change the item's configuration. An
       image item becomes the current item when the mouse pointer is over any part of its bounding box.

       The following standard options are supported by images:

              <b>-anchor</b>                       <b>-state</b>
              <b>-tags</b>

       The following extra options are supported for images:

       <b>-image</b> <u>name</u>

       <b>-activeimage</b> <u>name</u>

       <b>-disabledimage</b> <u>name</u>
              Specifies the name of the images to display in the item in is normal, active and disabled  states.
              This image must have been created previously with the <b>image</b> <b>create</b> command.

   <b>LINE</b> <b>ITEMS</b>
       Items  of  type  <b>line</b> appear on the display as one or more connected line segments or curves.  Line items
       support coordinate indexing operations using the <b>dchars</b>, <b>index</b> and <b>insert</b>  widget  commands.   Lines  are
       created with widget commands of the following form:
              <u>pathName</u> <b>create</b> <b>line</b> <u>x1</u> <u>y1...</u> <u>xn</u> <u>yn</u> ?<u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>...</u>?
              <u>pathName</u> <b>create</b> <b>line</b> <u>coordList</u> ?<u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>...</u>?
       The  arguments  <u>x1</u>  through  <u>yn</u> or <u>coordList</u> give the coordinates for a series of two or more points that
       describe a series of connected line  segments.   After  the  coordinates  there  may  be  any  number  of
       <u>option</u>-<u>value</u>  pairs,  each  of  which  sets  one  of  the  configuration options for the item. These same
       <u>option</u>-<u>value</u> pairs may be used in <b>itemconfigure</b> widget commands to change  the  item's  configuration.  A
       line  item  is the current item whenever the mouse pointer is over any segment of the line, whether drawn
       or not and whether or not the line is smoothed.

       The following standard options are supported by lines:

              <b>-dash</b>                         <b>-activedash</b>
              <b>-disableddash</b>                 <b>-dashoffset</b>
              <b>-fill</b>                         <b>-activefill</b>
              <b>-disabledfill</b>                 <b>-stipple</b>
              <b>-activestipple</b>                <b>-disabledstipple</b>
              <b>-state</b>                        <b>-tags</b>
              <b>-width</b>                        <b>-activewidth</b>
              <b>-disabledwidth</b>

       The following extra options are supported for lines:

       <b>-arrow</b> <u>where</u>
              Indicates whether or not arrowheads are to be drawn at one or both ends of the line.   <u>Where</u>  must
              have one of the values <b>none</b> (for no arrowheads), <b>first</b> (for an arrowhead at the first point of the
              line),  <b>last</b>  (for  an  arrowhead  at the last point of the line), or <b>both</b> (for arrowheads at both
              ends).  This option defaults to <b>none</b>.  When requested to draw an arrowhead, Tk internally  adjusts
              the  corresponding  line  end  point  so  that the rendered line ends at the neck of the arrowhead
              rather than at its tip so that the line doesn't extend past the edge of the  arrowhead.  This  may
              trigger  a  <b>Leave</b>  event  if  the  mouse  is  hovering this line end. Conversely, when removing an
              arrowhead Tk adjusts the corresponding line point the other way round, which may trigger an  <b>Enter</b>
              event.

       <b>-arrowshape</b> <u>shape</u>
              This  option  indicates  how  to  draw  arrowheads.   The <u>shape</u> argument must be a list with three
              elements, each specifying a distance in any of the forms  described  in  the  <b>COORDINATES</b>  section
              above.   The  first  element  of  the  list gives the distance along the line from the neck of the
              arrowhead to its tip.  The second element gives the distance along  the  line  from  the  trailing
              points of the arrowhead to the tip, and the third element gives the distance from the outside edge
              of  the line to the trailing points.  If this option is not specified then Tk picks a “reasonable”
              shape.

       <b>-capstyle</b> <u>style</u>
              Specifies the ways in which caps are to be drawn at the endpoints of the line.  <u>Style</u> may have any
              of the forms accepted by <b>Tk_GetCapStyle</b> (<b>butt</b>, <b>projecting</b>, or  <b>round</b>).   If  this  option  is  not
              specified then it defaults to <b>butt</b>.  Where arrowheads are drawn the cap style is ignored.

       <b>-joinstyle</b> <u>style</u>
              Specifies  the  ways  in which joints are to be drawn at the vertices of the line.  <u>Style</u> may have
              any of the forms accepted by <b>Tk_GetJoinStyle</b> (<b>bevel</b>, <b>miter</b>, or <b>round</b>).   If  this  option  is  not
              specified  then  it  defaults  to <b>round</b>.  If the line only contains two points then this option is
              irrelevant.

       <b>-smooth</b> <u>smoothMethod</u>
              <u>smoothMethod</u> must have one of the forms accepted by <b>Tcl_GetBoolean</b> or  a  line  smoothing  method.
              Only <b>true</b> and <b>raw</b> are supported in the core (with <b>bezier</b> being an alias for <b>true</b>), but more can be
              added  at  runtime.  If a boolean false value or empty string is given, no smoothing is applied. A
              boolean truth value assumes <b>true</b> smoothing.  If the smoothing method is <b>true</b>, this indicates  that
              the  line  should be drawn as a curve, rendered as a set of quadratic splines: one spline is drawn
              for the first and second line segments, one for the second and third,  and  so  on.  Straight-line
              segments  can  be  generated  within  a  curve  by  duplicating the end-points of the desired line
              segment.  If the smoothing method is <b>raw</b>, this indicates that the line should also be drawn  as  a
              curve  but  where  the list of coordinates is such that the first coordinate pair (and every third
              coordinate pair thereafter) is a knot point on a cubic Bezier curve, and the other coordinates are
              control points on the cubic Bezier curve. Straight line segments can be generated within  a  curve
              by  making  control points equal to their neighbouring knot points. If the last point is a control
              point and not a knot point, the point is repeated (one or two times) so that  it  also  becomes  a
              knot point.

       <b>-splinesteps</b> <u>number</u>
              Specifies  the  degree  of  smoothness  desired  for curves: each spline will be approximated with
              <u>number</u> line segments. This option is ignored unless the <b>-smooth</b> option is true or <b>raw</b>.

   <b>OVAL</b> <b>ITEMS</b>
       Items of type <b>oval</b> appear as circular or oval regions on the display. Each oval may have  an  outline,  a
       fill, or both. Ovals are created with widget commands of the following form:
              <u>pathName</u> <b>create</b> <b>oval</b> <u>x1</u> <u>y1</u> <u>x2</u> <u>y2</u> ?<u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>...</u>?
              <u>pathName</u> <b>create</b> <b>oval</b> <u>coordList</u> ?<u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>...</u>?
       The  arguments <u>x1</u>, <u>y1</u>, <u>x2</u>, and <u>y2</u> or <u>coordList</u> give the coordinates of two diagonally opposite corners of
       a rectangular region enclosing the oval.  The oval will include the top and left edges of  the  rectangle
       not  the lower or right edges.  If the region is square then the resulting oval is circular; otherwise it
       is elongated in shape.  After the coordinates there may be any number  of  <u>option</u>-<u>value</u>  pairs,  each  of
       which  sets  one  of the configuration options for the item. These same <u>option</u>-<u>value</u> pairs may be used in
       <b>itemconfigure</b> widget commands to change the item's configuration. An oval item becomes the  current  item
       when the mouse pointer is over any part that is painted or (when fully transparent) that would be painted
       if both the <b>-fill</b> and <b>-outline</b> options were non-empty.

       The following standard options are supported by ovals:

              <b>-dash</b>                         <b>-activedash</b>
              <b>-disableddash</b>                 <b>-dashoffset</b>
              <b>-fill</b>                         <b>-activefill</b>
              <b>-disabledfill</b>                 <b>-offset</b>
              <b>-outline</b>                      <b>-activeoutline</b>
              <b>-disabledoutline</b>              <b>-outlineoffset</b>
              <b>-outlinestipple</b>               <b>-activeoutlinestipple</b>
              <b>-disabledoutlinestipple</b>       <b>-stipple</b>
              <b>-activestipple</b>                <b>-disabledstipple</b>
              <b>-state</b>                        <b>-tags</b>
              <b>-width</b>                        <b>-activewidth</b>
              <b>-disabledwidth</b>

       There are no oval-specific options.

   <b>POLYGON</b> <b>ITEMS</b>
       Items of type <b>polygon</b> appear as polygonal or curved filled regions on the display.  Polygon items support
       coordinate  indexing operations using the <b>dchars</b>, <b>index</b> and <b>insert</b> widget commands.  Polygons are created
       with widget commands of the following form:
              <u>pathName</u> <b>create</b> <b>polygon</b> <u>x1</u> <u>y1</u> <u>...</u> <u>xn</u> <u>yn</u> ?<u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>...</u>?
              <u>pathName</u> <b>create</b> <b>polygon</b> <u>coordList</u> ?<u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>...</u>?
       The arguments <u>x1</u> through <u>yn</u> or <u>coordList</u> specify the coordinates for three or more points that  define  a
       polygon.   The  first  point should not be repeated as the last to close the shape; Tk will automatically
       close the periphery between the first and last points.  After the coordinates there may be any number  of
       <u>option</u>-<u>value</u>  pairs,  each  of  which  sets  one  of  the  configuration options for the item. These same
       <u>option</u>-<u>value</u> pairs may be used in <b>itemconfigure</b> widget commands to change  the  item's  configuration.  A
       polygon  item  is  the  current  item whenever the mouse pointer is over any part of the polygon, whether
       drawn or not and whether or not the outline is smoothed.

       The following standard options are supported by polygons:

              <b>-dash</b>                         <b>-activedash</b>
              <b>-disableddash</b>                 <b>-dashoffset</b>
              <b>-fill</b>                         <b>-activefill</b>
              <b>-disabledfill</b>                 <b>-offset</b>
              <b>-outline</b>                      <b>-activeoutline</b>
              <b>-disabledoutline</b>              <b>-outlineoffset</b>
              <b>-outlinestipple</b>               <b>-activeoutlinestipple</b>
              <b>-disabledoutlinestipple</b>       <b>-stipple</b>
              <b>-activestipple</b>                <b>-disabledstipple</b>
              <b>-state</b>                        <b>-tags</b>
              <b>-width</b>                        <b>-activewidth</b>
              <b>-disabledwidth</b>

       The following extra options are supported for polygons:

       <b>-joinstyle</b> <u>style</u>
              Specifies the ways in which joints are to be drawn at the vertices of the outline.  <u>Style</u> may have
              any of the forms accepted by <b>Tk_GetJoinStyle</b> (<b>bevel</b>, <b>miter</b>, or <b>round</b>).   If  this  option  is  not
              specified then it defaults to <b>round</b>.

       <b>-smooth</b> <u>boolean</u>
              <u>Boolean</u>  must  have  one  of the forms accepted by <b>Tcl_GetBoolean</b> or a line smoothing method. Only
              <b>true</b> and <b>raw</b> are supported in the core (with <b>bezier</b> being an alias for  <b>true</b>),  but  more  can  be
              added  at  runtime.  If a boolean false value or empty string is given, no smoothing is applied. A
              boolean truth value assumes <b>true</b> smoothing.  If the smoothing method is <b>true</b>, this indicates  that
              the  polygon  should  be  drawn  as a curve, rendered as a set of quadratic splines: one spline is
              drawn for the first and second line segments, one for the second and third, and so  on.  Straight-
              line  segments  can  be generated within a curve by duplicating the end-points of the desired line
              segment.  If the smoothing method is <b>raw</b>, this indicates that the polygon should also be drawn  as
              a  curve but where the list of coordinates is such that the first coordinate pair (and every third
              coordinate pair thereafter) is a knot point on a cubic Bezier curve, and the other coordinates are
              control points on the cubic Bezier curve. Straight line segments can be generated within  a  curve
              by  making  control  points  equal to their neighbouring knot points. If the last point is not the
              second point of a pair of control points, the point is repeated (one or two times) so that it also
              becomes the second point of a pair of control points (the associated knot point will be the  first
              control point).

       <b>-splinesteps</b> <u>number</u>
              Specifies  the  degree  of  smoothness  desired  for curves: each spline will be approximated with
              <u>number</u> line segments. This option is ignored unless the <b>-smooth</b> option is true or <b>raw</b>.

       Polygon items are different from other items such as rectangles, ovals and arcs in that  interior  points
       are  considered  to  be  “inside”  a  polygon (e.g. for purposes of the <b>find</b> <b>closest</b> and <b>find</b> <b>overlapping</b>
       widget commands) even if it is not filled.  For most other item types, an interior point is considered to
       be inside the item only if the item is filled or if it has neither a fill nor an outline.  If  you  would
       like  an  unfilled  polygon whose interior points are not considered to be inside the polygon, use a line
       item instead.

   <b>RECTANGLE</b> <b>ITEMS</b>
       Items of type <b>rectangle</b> appear as rectangular regions on the display. Each rectangle may have an outline,
       a fill, or both. Rectangles are created with widget commands of the following form:
              <u>pathName</u> <b>create</b> <b>rectangle</b> <u>x1</u> <u>y1</u> <u>x2</u> <u>y2</u> ?<u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>...</u>?
              <u>pathName</u> <b>create</b> <b>rectangle</b> <u>coordList</u> ?<u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>...</u>?
       The arguments <u>x1</u>, <u>y1</u>, <u>x2</u>, and <u>y2</u> or <u>coordList</u> (which must have four elements) give the coordinates of two
       diagonally opposite corners of the rectangle (the rectangle will include its upper and left edges but not
       its lower or right edges).  After the coordinates there may be any number of <u>option</u>-<u>value</u> pairs, each  of
       which  sets  one  of the configuration options for the item. These same <u>option</u>-<u>value</u> pairs may be used in
       <b>itemconfigure</b> widget commands to change the item's configuration. A rectangle item  becomes  the  current
       item  when  the  mouse pointer is over any part that is painted or (when fully transparent) that would be
       painted if both the <b>-fill</b> and <b>-outline</b> options were non-empty.

       The following standard options are supported by rectangles:

              <b>-dash</b>                         <b>-activedash</b>
              <b>-disableddash</b>                 <b>-dashoffset</b>
              <b>-fill</b>                         <b>-activefill</b>
              <b>-disabledfill</b>                 <b>-offset</b>
              <b>-outline</b>                      <b>-activeoutline</b>
              <b>-disabledoutline</b>              <b>-outlineoffset</b>
              <b>-outlinestipple</b>               <b>-activeoutlinestipple</b>
              <b>-disabledoutlinestipple</b>       <b>-stipple</b>
              <b>-activestipple</b>                <b>-disabledstipple</b>
              <b>-state</b>                        <b>-tags</b>
              <b>-width</b>                        <b>-activewidth</b>
              <b>-disabledwidth</b>

       There are no rectangle-specific options.

   <b>TEXT</b> <b>ITEMS</b>
       A text item displays a string of characters on the screen in one  or  more  lines.   Text  items  support
       indexing,  editing and selection through the <b>dchars</b> widget command, the <b>focus</b> widget command, the <b>icursor</b>
       widget command, the <b>index</b> widget command, the <b>insert</b> widget command, and the <b>select</b> widget command.  Text
       items are created with widget commands of the following form:
              <u>pathName</u> <b>create</b> <b>text</b> <u>x</u> <u>y</u> ?<u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>...</u>?
              <u>pathName</u> <b>create</b> <b>text</b> <u>coordList</u> ?<u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>...</u>?
       The arguments <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> or <u>coordList</u> (which must have two elements) specify the coordinates of a point used
       to position the text on the display  (see  the  options  below  for  more  information  on  how  text  is
       displayed).   After the coordinates there may be any number of <u>option</u>-<u>value</u> pairs, each of which sets one
       of the configuration options for the item. These same <u>option</u>-<u>value</u> pairs may  be  used  in  <b>itemconfigure</b>
       widget  commands  to change the item's configuration. A text item becomes the current item when the mouse
       pointer is over any part of its bounding box.

       The following standard options are supported by text items:

              <b>-anchor</b>                       <b>-fill</b>
              <b>-activefill</b>                   <b>-disabledfill</b>
              <b>-stipple</b>                      <b>-activestipple</b>
              <b>-disabledstipple</b>              <b>-state</b>
              <b>-tags</b>

       The following extra options are supported for text items:

       <b>-angle</b> <u>rotationDegrees</u>
              <u>RotationDegrees</u> tells how many degrees to rotate the  text  anticlockwise  about  the  positioning
              point  for  the  text;  it  may  have  any floating-point value from 0.0 to 360.0. For example, if
              <u>rotationDegrees</u> is <b>90</b>, then the text will be drawn vertically from bottom  to  top.   This  option
              defaults to <b>0.0</b>.

       <b>-font</b> <u>fontName</u>
              Specifies the font to use for the text item.  <u>FontName</u> may be any string acceptable to <b>Tk_GetFont</b>.
              If this option is not specified, it defaults to a system-dependent font.

       <b>-justify</b> <u>how</u>
              Specifies how to justify the text within its bounding region.  <u>How</u> must be one of the values <b>left</b>,
              <b>right</b>,  or  <b>center</b>.   This option will only matter if the text is displayed as multiple lines.  If
              the option is omitted, it defaults to <b>left</b>.

       <b>-text</b> <u>string</u>
              <u>String</u> specifies the characters to be displayed in the text item.  Newline characters  cause  line
              breaks.   The  characters  in  the  item  may  also  be  changed with the <b>insert</b> and <b>delete</b> widget
              commands.  This option defaults to an empty string.

       <b>-underline</b> <u>number</u>
              Specifies the integer index of a character within the text to be underlined. 0 corresponds to  the
              first  character  of  the  text  displayed,  1  to the next character, and so on. -1 means that no
              underline should be drawn (if the whole text item is to be underlined, the appropriate font should
              be used instead).

       <b>-width</b> <u>lineLength</u>
              Specifies a maximum line length for the text, in any of the forms  described  in  the  <b>COORDINATES</b>
              section above.  If this option is zero (the default) the text is broken into lines only at newline
              characters.   However,  if  this  option  is  non-zero  then  any  line  that would be longer than
              <u>lineLength</u> is broken just before a space character to make the line shorter than  <u>lineLength</u>;  the
              space character is treated as if it were a newline character.

   <b>WINDOW</b> <b>ITEMS</b>
       Items of type <b>window</b> cause a particular window to be displayed at a given position on the canvas.  Window
       items are created with widget commands of the following form:
              <u>pathName</u> <b>create</b> <b>window</b> <u>x</u> <u>y</u> ?<u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>...</u>?
              <u>pathName</u> <b>create</b> <b>window</b> <u>coordList</u> ?<u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>...</u>?
       The arguments <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> or <u>coordList</u> (which must have two elements) specify the coordinates of a point used
       to  position the window on the display, as controlled by the <b>-anchor</b> option.  After the coordinates there
       may be any number of <u>option</u>-<u>value</u> pairs, each of which sets one of  the  configuration  options  for  the
       item.  These  same  <u>option</u>-<u>value</u>  pairs may be used in <b>itemconfigure</b> widget commands to change the item's
       configuration. Theoretically, a window item becomes the current item when the mouse pointer is  over  any
       part of its bounding box, but in practice this typically does not happen because the mouse pointer ceases
       to be over the canvas at that point.

       The following standard options are supported by window items:

              <b>-anchor</b>                       <b>-state</b>
              <b>-tags</b>

       The following extra options are supported for window items:

       <b>-height</b> <u>pixels</u>
              Specifies  the  height to assign to the item's window.  <u>Pixels</u> may have any of the forms described
              in the <b>COORDINATES</b> section above.  If this option is not specified, or if it is specified as zero,
              then the window is given whatever height it requests internally.

       <b>-width</b> <u>pixels</u>
              Specifies the width to assign to the item's window.  <u>Pixels</u> may have any of the forms described in
              the <b>COORDINATES</b> section above.  If this option is not specified, or if it is  specified  as  zero,
              then the window is given whatever width it requests internally.

       <b>-window</b> <u>pathName</u>
              Specifies the window to associate with this item.  The window specified by <u>pathName</u> must either be
              a  child  of the canvas widget or a child of some ancestor of the canvas widget.  <u>PathName</u> may not
              refer to a top-level window.

       Note that, due to restrictions in the ways that windows are managed, it is not  possible  to  draw  other
       graphical  items  (such  as  lines  and images) on top of window items. A window item always obscures any
       graphics that overlap it, regardless of their order in the display list. Also  note  that  window  items,
       unlike  other  canvas  items,  are  not  clipped for display by their containing canvas's border, and are
       instead clipped by the parent widget of the window specified by  the  <b>-window</b>  option;  when  the  parent
       widget is the canvas, this means that the window item can overlap the canvas's border.

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION-DEFINED</b> <b>ITEM</b> <b>TYPES</b></h4><pre>
       It is possible for individual applications to define new item types for canvas widgets using C code.  See
       the documentation for <b>Tk_CreateItemType</b>.

</pre><h4><b>BINDINGS</b></h4><pre>
       In  the current implementation, new canvases are not given any default behavior: you will have to execute
       explicit Tcl commands to give the canvas its behavior.

</pre><h4><b>CREDITS</b></h4><pre>
       Tk's canvas widget is a blatant ripoff of ideas from Joel Bartlett's <u>ezd</u> program. <u>Ezd</u> provides structured
       graphics in a Scheme environment and preceded canvases by a  year  or  two.  Its  simple  mechanisms  for
       placing and animating graphical objects inspired the functions of canvases.
