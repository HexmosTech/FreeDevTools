</pre><h4><b>WIDGET-SPECIFIC</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Name:     <b>closeEnough</b>
       Class:    <b>CloseEnough</b>
       Switch:   <b>-closeenough</b>
           Specifies  a  floating-point value indicating how close the mouse cursor must be to an item before it
           is considered to be ``inside'' the item.  Defaults to 1.0.

       Name:     <b>confine</b>
       Class:    <b>Confine</b>
       Switch:   <b>-confine</b>
           Specifies a boolean value that indicates whether or not it should be allowable to  set  the  canvas's
           view outside the region defined by the <b>scrollRegion</b> argument.  Defaults to true, which means that the
           view will be constrained within the scroll region.

       Name:     <b>height</b>
       Class:    <b>Height</b>
       Switch:   <b>-height</b>
           Specifies  a  desired  window height that the canvas widget should request from its geometry manager.
           The value may be specified in any of the forms described in the "COORDINATES" section below.

       Name:     <b>scrollRegion</b>
       Class:    <b>ScrollRegion</b>
       Switch:   <b>-scrollregion</b>
           Specifies a list with four coordinates describing the left, top, right, and bottom coordinates  of  a
           rectangular  region.  This region is used for scrolling purposes and is considered to be the boundary
           of the information in the canvas.  Each of the coordinates may be specified in any of the forms given
           in the "COORDINATES" section below.

       Name:     <b>state</b>
       Class:    <b>State</b>
       Switch:   <b>-state</b>
           Modifies the default state of the canvas where <u>state</u> may be set  to  one  of:  normal,  disabled,  or
           hidden. Individual canvas objects all have their own state option, which overrides the default state.
           Many  options  can take separate specifications such that the appearance of the item can be different
           in different situations. The options that start with "active" control the appearance when  the  mouse
           pointer  is over it, while the option starting with "disabled" controls the appearance when the state
           is disabled.

       Name:     <b>width</b>
       Class:    <b>width</b>
       Switch:   <b>-width</b>
           Specifies a desired window width that the canvas widget should request  from  its  geometry  manager.
           The value may be specified in any of the forms described in the "COORDINATES" section below.

       Name:     <b>xScrollIncrement</b>
       Class:    <b>ScrollIncrement</b>
       Switch:   <b>-xscrollincrement</b>
           Specifies  an  increment  for  horizontal  scrolling,  in any of the usual forms permitted for screen
           distances.  If the value of this option is greater than zero, the horizontal view in the window  will
           be  constrained  so  that  the  canvas  x coordinate at the left edge of the window is always an even
           multiple of <b>xScrollIncrement</b>;  furthermore, the units for scrolling (e.g., the change  in  view  when
           the  left  and right arrows of a scrollbar are selected) will also be <b>xScrollIncrement</b>.  If the value
           of this option is less than or equal to zero, then horizontal scrolling is unconstrained.

       Name:     <b>yScrollIncrement</b>
       Class:    <b>ScrollIncrement</b>
       Switch:   <b>-yscrollincrement</b>
           Specifies an increment for vertical scrolling, in  any  of  the  usual  forms  permitted  for  screen
           distances.  If the value of this option is greater than zero, the vertical view in the window will be
           constrained  so that the canvas y coordinate at the top edge of the window is always an even multiple
           of <b>yScrollIncrement</b>;  furthermore, the units for scrolling (e.g., the change in view when the top and
           bottom arrows of a scrollbar are selected) will also be  <b>yScrollIncrement</b>.   If  the  value  of  this
           option is less than or equal to zero, then vertical scrolling is unconstrained.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>Canvas</b> method creates a new window (given by the $canvas argument) and makes it into a canvas widget.
       Additional  options,  described  above, may be specified on the command line or in the option database to
       configure aspects of the canvas such as its colors and  3-D  relief.   The  <b>canvas</b>  command  returns  its
       $canvas  argument.  At the time this command is invoked, there must not exist a window named $canvas, but
       $canvas's parent must exist.

       Canvas widgets implement structured graphics.  A canvas displays any number of <u>items</u>, which may be things
       like rectangles, circles, lines, and text.  Items may be  manipulated  (e.g.  moved  or  re-colored)  and
       callbacks  may  be associated with items in much the same way that the bind method allows callbacks to be
       bound to widgets.  For example, a particular callback may be associated with the <b>&lt;Button-1&gt;</b> event so that
       the callback is invoked whenever button 1 is pressed with the mouse cursor over an item.  This means that
       items in a canvas can have behaviors defined by the Callbacks bound to them.

</pre><h4><b>DISPLAY</b> <b>LIST</b></h4><pre>
       The items in a canvas are ordered for purposes of display, with the first item in the display list  being
       displayed  first,  followed  by  the  next  item in the list, and so on.  Items later in the display list
       obscure those that are earlier in the display list and are sometimes referred to as being <u>``on</u>  <u>top''</u>  of
       earlier  items.   When  a  new  item  is  created  it is placed at the end of the display list, on top of
       everything else.  Widget methods may be used to re-arrange the order of the display list.

       Window items are an exception to the above rules.  The underlying window systems require them  always  to
       be  drawn  on top of other items.  In addition, the stacking order of window items is not affected by any
       of the canvas methods; you must use the raise and lower Tk widget methods instead.

</pre><h4><b>ITEM</b> <b>IDS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>TAGS</b></h4><pre>
       Items in a canvas widget may be named in either of two ways: by id or by tag.  Each  item  has  a  unique
       identifying  number  which  is assigned to that item when it is created.  The id of an item never changes
       and id numbers are never re-used within the lifetime of a canvas widget.

       Each item may also have any number of <u>tags</u> associated with it.  A tag is just a string of characters, and
       it may take any form except that of an integer.  For example, ``x123'' is OK but ``123'' isn't.  The same
       tag may be associated with many different items.  This  is  commonly  done  to  group  items  in  various
       interesting ways;  for example, all selected items might be given the tag ``selected''.

       The  tag <b>all</b> is implicitly associated with every item in the canvas;  it may be used to invoke operations
       on all the items in the canvas.

       The tag <b>current</b> is managed automatically by Tk; it applies to the <u>current</u> <u>item</u>, which is the topmost item
       whose drawn area covers the position of the mouse cursor.  If the mouse is not in the canvas widget or is
       not over an item, then no item has the <b>current</b> tag.

       When specifying items in canvas methods, if the specifier is an integer then it is assumed  to  refer  to
       the  single item with that id.  If the specifier is not an integer, then it is assumed to refer to all of
       the items in the canvas that have a tag matching the specifier.  The symbol  <u>tagOrId</u>  is  used  below  to
       indicate that an argument specifies either an id that selects a single item or a tag that selects zero or
       more items.

       <u>tagOrId</u>  may  contain  a  logical  expressions  of  tags  by  using  operators:  '&amp;&amp;', '||', '^' '!', and
       parenthezised subexpressions.  For example:

       $c-&gt;find('withtag',  '(a&amp;&amp;!b)|(!a&amp;&amp;b)');

       or equivalently:

       $c-&gt;find('withtag', 'a^b');

       will find only those items with either "a" or "b" tags, but not both.

       Some methods only operate on a single item at a time;  if <u>tagOrId</u>  is  specified  in  a  way  that  names
       multiple  items,  then the normal behavior is for the methods is to use the first (lowest) of these items
       in the display list that is suitable for the method.  Exceptions are noted  in  the  method  descriptions
       below.

</pre><h4><b>COORDINATES</b></h4><pre>
       All  coordinates related to canvases are stored as floating-point numbers.  Coordinates and distances are
       specified in screen units, which are  floating-point  numbers  optionally  followed  by  one  of  several
       letters.   If no letter is supplied then the distance is in pixels.  If the letter is <b>m</b> then the distance
       is in millimeters on the screen;  if it is <b>c</b> then the distance is in centimeters; <b>i</b> means inches,  and  <b>p</b>
       means  printers  points  (1/72  inch).  Larger y-coordinates refer to points lower on the screen;  larger
       x-coordinates refer to points farther to the right.

</pre><h4><b>TRANSFORMATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Normally the origin of the canvas coordinate system is at the upper-left corner of the window  containing
       the  canvas.   It is possible to adjust the origin of the canvas coordinate system relative to the origin
       of the window using the <b>xview</b> and <b>yview</b> methods;  this is typically used for scrolling.  Canvases do  not
       support scaling or rotation of the canvas coordinate system relative to the window coordinate system.

       Individual items may be moved or scaled using methods described below, but they may not be rotated.

</pre><h4><b>INDICES</b></h4><pre>
       Text items support the notion of an <u>index</u> for identifying particular positions within the item.

       Indices  are  used  for  methods  such as inserting text, deleting a range of characters, and setting the
       insertion cursor position.  An index may be specified in any of a number of ways, and different types  of
       items may support different forms for specifying indices.

       In  a  similar  fashion,  line  and  polygon  items support <u>index</u> for identifying, inserting and deleting
       subsets of their coordinates.  Indices are used for commands such as inserting or  deleting  a  range  of
       characters or coordinates, and setting the insertion cursor position. An index may be specified in any of
       a number of ways, and different types of items may support different forms for specifying indices.

       Text  items  support  the  following  forms for an index;  if you define new types of text-like items, it
       would be advisable to support as many of these forms as practical.  Note that it is possible to refer  to
       the  character  just  after the last one in the text item;  this is necessary for such tasks as inserting
       new text at the end of the item.   Lines  and  Polygons  don't  support  the  insertion  cursor  and  the
       selection. Their indices are supposed to be even always, because coordinates always appear in pairs.

       <u>number</u>
           A  decimal number giving the position of the desired character within the text item.  0 refers to the
           first character, 1 to the next character, and so on. If indexes are odd for lines and polygons,  they
           will  be automatically decremented by one.  A number less than 0 is treated as if it were zero, and a
           number greater than the length of the text item is treated as if it were equal to the length  of  the
           text  item.  For polygons, numbers less than 0 or greater then the length of the coordinate list will
           be adjusted by adding or substracting the length until the result is between  zero  and  the  length,
           inclusive.

       <b>end</b> Refers  to  the  character  or  coordinate just after the last one in the item (same as the number of
           characters or coordinates in the item).

       <b>insert</b>
           Refers to the character just before which the insertion cursor is drawn in this item. Not  valid  for
           lines and polygons.

       <b>sel.first</b>
           Refers  to  the  first selected character in the item.  If the selection isn't in this item then this
           form is illegal.

       <b>sel.last</b>
           Refers to the last selected character in the item.  If the selection isn't in  this  item  then  this
           form is illegal.

       <b>[</b><u>x,y</u><b>]</b>
           Refers  to  the character or coordinate at the point given by <u>x</u> and <u>y</u>, where <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> are specified in
           the coordinate system of the canvas.  If <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> lie outside the  coordinates  covered  by  the  text
           item,  then they refer to the first or last character in the line that is closest to the given point.
           The Tcl string form "@x,y" is also allowed.

</pre><h4><b>DASH</b> <b>PATTERNS</b></h4><pre>
       Many items support the notion of an dash pattern for outlines.

       The first possible syntax is a list of integers. Each element represents the number of pixels of  a  line
       segment.  Only  the  odd  segments  are  drawn  using  the  "outline" color. The other segments are drawn
       transparent.

       The second possible syntax is a character list containing only 5 possible characters <b>[.,-_</b> <b>]</b>,   with  the
       first  4 characters producing a segment of length 1 to 4, respectively, followed by a transparent segment
       of length 2. The space can be used repeatedly to enlarge the space between other line elements by 1,  and
       can  not occur as the first position in the string.  The main difference of this syntax with the previous
       one is that it it shape-conserving. This means that all values in the dash list will be multiplied by the
       line width before display. This assures that "." will always be displayed as a dot and "-"  always  as  a
       dash regardless of the line width.

       Some examples, for a line width of 2:

        -dash .     = -dash [2,4]
        -dash -     = -dash [6,4]
        -dash -.    = -dash [6,4,2,4]
        -dash -..   = -dash [6,4,2,4,2,4]
        -dash '.  ' = -dash [2,8]
        -dash ','   = -dash [4,4]

       On  systems where only a limited set of dash patterns is available, the dash pattern will be displayed as
       the closest available dash pattern. For example, on Windows only the first 4 of the  above  examples  are
       available. The last 2 examples will be displayed identically as the first one.

</pre><h4><b>WIDGET</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>Canvas</b> method creates a widget object.  This object supports the <b>configure</b> and <b>cget</b> methods described
       in  Tk::options  which  can  be  used to enquire and modify the options described above.  The widget also
       inherits all the methods provided by the generic Tk::Widget class.

       The following additional methods are available for canvas widgets:

       <u>$canvas</u>-&gt;<b>addtag</b>(<u>tag,</u> <u>searchSpec,</u> ?<u>arg,</u> <u>arg,</u> <u>...</u>?)
           For each item that meets the constraints specified by <u>searchSpec</u> and the <u>arg</u>s, add <u>tag</u> to the list of
           tags associated with the item if it isn't already present on that list.  It is possible that no items
           will satisfy the constraints given by <u>searchSpec</u> and <u>arg</u>s, in which case the method  has  no  effect.
           This  command  returns an empty string as result.  <u>SearchSpec</u> and <u>arg</u>'s may take any of the following
           forms:

           <b>above</b> <u>tagOrId</u>
                   Selects the item just after (above) the one given by <u>tagOrId</u> in the display list.  If <u>tagOrId</u>
                   denotes more than one item, then the last (topmost) of these items in  the  display  list  is
                   used.

           <b>all</b>     Selects all the items in the canvas.

           <b>below</b> <u>tagOrId</u>
                   Selects  the  item  just  before  (below)  the  one given by <u>tagOrId</u> in the display list.  If
                   <u>tagOrId</u> denotes more than one item, then the first (lowest) of these  items  in  the  display
                   list is used.

           <b>closest</b> <u>x</u> <u>y</u> ?<u>halo</u>? ?<u>start</u>?
                   Selects the item closest to the point given by <u>x</u> and <u>y</u>.  If more than one item is at the same
                   closest  distance  (e.g.  two items overlap the point), then the top-most of these items (the
                   last one in the display list) is used.  If <u>halo</u> is specified, then it must be a  non-negative
                   value.   Any  item  closer  than  <u>halo</u>  to  the point is considered to overlap it.  The <u>start</u>
                   argument may be used to  step  circularly  through  all  the  closest  items.   If  <u>start</u>  is
                   specified,  it  names  an item using a tag or id (if by tag, it selects the first item in the
                   display list with the given tag).  Instead of selecting the topmost closest item,  this  form
                   will  select  the  topmost  closest item that is below <u>start</u> in the display list;  if no such
                   item exists, then the selection behaves as if the <u>start</u> argument had not been specified.

           <b>enclosed</b> <u>x1</u> <u>y1</u> <u>x2</u> <u>y2</u>
                   Selects all the items completely enclosed within the rectangular region given by <u>x1</u>, <u>y1</u>,  <u>x2</u>,
                   and <u>y2</u>.  <u>X1</u> must be no greater then <u>x2</u> and <u>y1</u> must be no greater than <u>y2</u>.

           <b>overlapping</b> <u>x1</u> <u>y1</u> <u>x2</u> <u>y2</u>
                   Selects all the items that overlap or are enclosed within the rectangular region given by <u>x1</u>,
                   <u>y1</u>, <u>x2</u>, and <u>y2</u>.  <u>X1</u> must be no greater then <u>x2</u> and <u>y1</u> must be no greater than <u>y2</u>.

           <b>withtag</b> <u>tagOrId</u>
                   Selects all the items given by <u>tagOrId</u>.

       <u>$canvas</u>-&gt;<b>bbox</b>(<u>tagOrId,</u> ?<u>tagOrId,</u> <u>tagOrId,</u> <u>...</u>?)
           Returns  a  list with four elements giving an approximate bounding box for all the items named by the
           <u>tagOrId</u> arguments.  The list has the form ``<u>x1</u> <u>y1</u> <u>x2</u> <u>y2</u>'' such that the drawn areas of all the  named
           elements  are  within the region bounded by <u>x1</u> on the left, <u>x2</u> on the right, <u>y1</u> on the top, and <u>y2</u> on
           the bottom.  The return value may overestimate the actual bounding box by a few pixels.  If no  items
           match any of the <u>tagOrId</u> arguments or if the matching items have empty bounding boxes (i.e. they have
           nothing to display) then an empty string is returned.

       <u>$canvas</u>-&gt;<b>bind</b>(<u>tagOrId</u>?, <u>sequence</u>? ?,<u>callback</u>?)
           This  method  associates  <u>callback</u>  with  all the items given by <u>tagOrId</u> such that whenever the event
           sequence given by <u>sequence</u> occurs for one of the items the callback will be invoked.  This method  is
           similar  to  the <b>bind</b> method except that it operates on items in a canvas rather than entire widgets.
           See Tk::bind for complete details on the syntax  of  <u>sequence</u>  and  the  substitutions  performed  on
           <u>callback</u> before invoking it.  If all arguments are specified then a new binding is created, replacing
           any  existing  binding  for the same <u>sequence</u> and <u>tagOrId</u> (if the first character of <u>command</u> is ``+''
           then <u>command</u> augments an existing binding rather than replacing it).  In this case the  return  value
           is  an  empty  string.   If  <u>callback</u> is omitted then the method returns the <u>callback</u> associated with
           <u>tagOrId</u> and <u>sequence</u> (an error occurs if there is no such binding).  If both  <u>callback</u>  and  <u>sequence</u>
           are  omitted then the method returns a list of all the sequences for which bindings have been defined
           for <u>tagOrId</u>.

                   The only events for which bindings may be specified  are  those  related  to  the  mouse  and
                   keyboard  (such  as  <b>Enter</b>, <b>Leave</b>, <b>ButtonPress</b>, <b>Motion</b>, and <b>KeyPress</b>) or virtual events.  The
                   handling of events in canvases uses the current item defined in "ITEM IDS  AND  TAGS"  above.
                   <b>Enter</b>  and  <b>Leave</b> events trigger for an item when it becomes the current item or ceases to be
                   the current item; note that these events are  different  than  <b>Enter</b>  and  <b>Leave</b>  events  for
                   windows.   Mouse-related  events  are directed to the current item, if any.  Keyboard-related
                   events are directed to the focus item, if any (see the focus method below for more on  this).
                   If  a  virtual event is used in a binding, that binding can trigger only if the virtual event
                   is defined by an underlying mouse-related or keyboard-related event.

                   It is possible for multiple bindings to match a particular  event.   This  could  occur,  for
                   example,  if  one binding is associated with the item's id and another is associated with one
                   of the item's tags.  When this occurs, all of the matching bindings are invoked.   A  binding
                   associated  with the <b>all</b> tag is invoked first, followed by one binding for each of the item's
                   tags (in order), followed by a binding associated with the item's id.  If there are  multiple
                   matching  bindings  for  a  single  tag,  then  only the most specific binding is invoked.  A
                   <b>continue</b> in a callback terminates  that  subroutine,  and  a  <b>break</b>  method  terminates  that
                   subroutine and skips any remaining callbacks for the event, just as for the <b>bind</b> method.

                   If  bindings have been created for a canvas window using the <b>CanvasBind</b> method, then they are
                   invoked in addition to bindings created for the canvas's items using the  <b>bind</b>  method.   The
                   bindings for items will be invoked before any of the bindings for the window as a whole.

       <u>$canvas</u>-&gt;<b>canvasx</b>(<u>screenx</u>?, <u>gridspacing</u>?)
           Given  a  window x-coordinate in the canvas <u>screenx</u>, this method returns the canvas x-coordinate that
           is displayed at that location.  If <u>gridspacing</u> is specified, then the canvas coordinate is rounded to
           the nearest multiple of <u>gridspacing</u> units.

       <u>$canvas</u>-&gt;<b>canvasy</b>(<u>screeny,</u> ?<u>gridspacing</u>?)
           Given a window y-coordinate in the canvas <u>screeny</u> this method returns the canvas y-coordinate that is
           displayed at that location.  If <u>gridspacing</u> is specified, then the canvas coordinate  is  rounded  to
           the nearest multiple of <u>gridspacing</u> units.

       <u>$canvas</u>-&gt;<b>coords</b>(<u>tagOrId</u> ?<u>x0,y0</u> <u>...</u>?)
           Query  or  modify  the coordinates that define an item.  If no coordinates are specified, this method
           returns a list whose elements are the coordinates of the item named by <u>tagOrId</u>.  If  coordinates  are
           specified,  then  they  replace  the  current  coordinates  for the named item.  If <u>tagOrId</u> refers to
           multiple items, then the first one in the display list is used.

       <u>$canvas</u>-&gt;<b>create</b>(<u>type,</u> <u>x,</u> <u>y,</u> ?<u>x,</u> <u>y,</u> <u>...</u>?, ?<u>option,</u> <u>value,</u> <u>...</u>?)
           Create a new item in <u>$canvas</u> of type <u>type</u>.  The exact format of the arguments after <b>type</b>  depends  on
           <b>type</b>,  but usually they consist of the coordinates for one or more points, followed by specifications
           for zero or more item options.  See the subsections on individual item types below for  more  on  the
           syntax of this method.  This method returns the id for the new item.

       <u>$canvas</u>-&gt;<b>dchars</b>(<u>tagOrId,</u> <u>first,</u> ?<u>last</u>?)
           For  each  item  given by <u>tagOrId</u>, delete the characters, or coordinates, in the range given by <u>first</u>
           and <u>last</u>, inclusive.  If some of the items given by <u>tagOrId</u> don't support Text items interpret  <u>first</u>
           and <u>last</u> as indices to a character, line and polygon items interpret them indices to a coordinate (an
           x,y  pair).   within the item(s) as described in "INDICES" above.  If <u>last</u> is omitted, it defaults to
           <u>first</u>.  This method returns an empty string.

       <u>$canvas</u>-&gt;<b>delete</b>(?<u>tagOrId,</u> <u>tagOrId,</u> <u>...</u>?)
           Delete each of the items given by each <u>tagOrId</u>, and return an empty string.

       <u>$canvas</u>-&gt;<b>dtag</b>(<u>tagOrId,</u> ?<u>tagToDelete</u>?)
           For each of the items given by <u>tagOrId</u>, delete the tag given by <u>tagToDelete</u> from the  list  of  those
           associated with the item.  If an item doesn't have the tag <u>tagToDelete</u> then the item is unaffected by
           the  method.   If  <u>tagToDelete</u>  is omitted then it defaults to <u>tagOrId</u>.  This method returns an empty
           string.

       <u>$canvas</u>-&gt;<b>find</b>(<u>searchCommand,</u> ?<u>arg,</u> <u>arg,</u> <u>...</u>?)
           This method returns a list consisting of all  the  items  that  meet  the  constraints  specified  by
           <u>searchCommand</u> and <u>arg</u>'s.  <u>SearchCommand</u> and <u>args</u> have any of the forms accepted by the <b>addtag</b> method.
           The items are returned in stacking order, with the lowest item first.

       focus
       <u>$canvas</u>-&gt;<b>focus</b>(?<u>tagOrId</u>?)
           Set  the  keyboard  focus  for  the canvas widget to the item given by <u>tagOrId</u>.  If <u>tagOrId</u> refers to
           several items, then the focus is set to the first such item in the display  list  that  supports  the
           insertion  cursor.   If  <u>tagOrId</u> doesn't refer to any items, or if none of them support the insertion
           cursor, then the focus isn't changed.  If <u>tagOrId</u> is an empty string, then the focus item is reset so
           that no item has the focus.  If <u>tagOrId</u> is not specified then the method returns the id for the  item
           that currently has the focus, or an empty string if no item has the focus.

                   Once  the  focus  has been set to an item, the item will display the insertion cursor and all
                   keyboard events will be directed to that item.  The focus item within a canvas and the  focus
                   window  on  the  screen  (set  with  the  <b>focus</b> method) are totally independent: a given item
                   doesn't actually have the input focus unless (a) its canvas is the focus window and  (b)  the
                   item  is the focus item within the canvas.  In most cases it is advisable to follow the <b>focus</b>
                   widget method with the <b>CanvasFocus</b> method to set the focus window to the canvas (if it wasn't
                   there already).

       <u>$canvas</u>-&gt;<b>gettags</b>(<u>tagOrId</u>)
           Return a list whose elements are the tags associated with the item  given  by  <u>tagOrId</u>.   If  <u>tagOrId</u>
           refers  to  more  than  one  item, then the tags are returned from the first such item in the display
           list.  If <u>tagOrId</u> doesn't refer to any items, or if the item contains no tags, then an  empty  string
           is returned.

       <u>$canvas</u>-&gt;<b>icursor</b>(<u>tagOrId,</u> <u>index</u>)
           Set  the  position  of  the  insertion  cursor  for  the  item(s) given by <u>tagOrId</u> to just before the
           character whose position is given by <u>index</u>.  If some or all of  the  items  given  by  <u>tagOrId</u>  don't
           support  an  insertion  cursor  then  this  method  has no effect on them.  See "INDICES" above for a
           description of the legal forms for <u>index</u>.  Note:  the insertion cursor is only displayed in  an  item
           if  that  item  currently has the keyboard focus (see the widget method <b>focus</b>, below), but the cursor
           position may be set even when the item doesn't have the focus.  This method returns an empty string.

       <u>$canvas</u>-&gt;<b>index</b>(<u>tagOrId,</u> <u>index</u>)
           This method returns a decimal string giving the  numerical  index  within  <u>tagOrId</u>  corresponding  to
           <u>index</u>.   <u>Index</u>  gives  a textual description of the desired position as described in "INDICES" above.
           Text items interpret <u>index</u> as an index to a  character, line and polygon items  interpret  it  as  an
           index  to a coordinate (an x,y pair).  The return value is guaranteed to lie between 0 and the number
           of characters, or coordinates, within the item, inclusive.  If <u>tagOrId</u> refers to multiple items, then
           the index is processed in the first of these items that supports indexing operations (in display list
           order).

       <u>$canvas</u>-&gt;<b>insert</b>(<u>tagOrId,</u> <u>beforeThis,</u> <u>string</u>)
           For each of the items given by <u>tagOrId</u>, if the item  supports  text  or  coordinate,  insertion  then
           <u>string</u>  is  inserted  into  the  item's text just before the character, or coordinate, whose index is
           <u>beforeThis</u>.  Text items interpret <u>beforethis</u> as an index to a   character,  line  and  polygon  items
           interpret  it as an index to a coordinate (an x,y pair).  For lines and polygons the <u>string</u> must be a
           valid coordinate sequence.   See  "INDICES"  above  for  information  about  the  forms  allowed  for
           <u>beforeThis</u>.  This method returns an empty string.

       <u>$canvas</u>-&gt;<b>itemcget</b>(<u>tagOrId,</u> <u>option</u>)
           Returns  the  current  value  of the configuration option for the item given by <u>tagOrId</u> whose name is
           <u>option</u>.  This method is similar to the cget method except that it applies to a particular item rather
           than the widget as a whole.  <u>Option</u> may have any of the values accepted by the <b>create</b> method when the
           item was created.  If <u>tagOrId</u> is a tag that refers to more than one item,  the  first  (lowest)  such
           item is used.

       <u>$canvas</u>-&gt;<b>itemconfigure</b>(<u>tagOrId,</u> ?<u>option</u>?, ?<u>value</u>?, ?<u>option,</u> <u>value,</u> <u>...</u>?)
           This  method is similar to the configure method except that it modifies item-specific options for the
           items given by <u>tagOrId</u> instead of modifying options for the overall canvas widget.  If no  <u>option</u>  is
           specified, returns a list describing all of the available options for the first item given by <u>tagOrId</u>
           (see  Tk::options for information on the format of this list).  If <u>option</u> is specified with no <u>value</u>,
           then the method returns a list describing the one named option (this list will be  identical  to  the
           corresponding  sublist of the value returned if no <u>option</u> is specified).  If one or more <u>option-value</u>
           pairs are specified, then the method modifies the given widget option(s) to have the  given  value(s)
           in each of the items given by <u>tagOrId</u>;  in this case the method returns an empty string.  The <u>option</u>s
           and  <u>value</u>s are the same as those permissible in the <b>create</b> method when the item(s) were created; see
           the sections describing individual item types below for details on the legal options.

       <u>$canvas</u>-&gt;<b>lower</b>(<u>tagOrId,</u> ?<u>belowThis</u>?)
           Move all of the items given by <u>tagOrId</u> to a new position in the display list  just  before  the  item
           given  by  <u>belowThis</u>.   If  <u>tagOrId</u>  refers to more than one item then all are moved but the relative
           order of the moved items will not be changed.  <u>BelowThis</u> is a tag or id;  if it refers to  more  than
           one  item  then  the  first  (lowest)  of  these items in the display list is used as the destination
           location for the moved items.  Note: this method has no effect on window items.  Window items  always
           obscure other item types, and the stacking order of window items is determined by the <b>raise</b> and <b>lower</b>
           methods  of  the  widget, not the <b>raise</b> and <b>lower</b> methods for canvases.  This method returns an empty
           string.

       <u>$canvas</u>-&gt;<b>move</b>(<u>tagOrId,</u> <u>xAmount,</u> <u>yAmount</u>)
           Move each of the items given by <u>tagOrId</u> in the canvas coordinate  space  by  adding  <u>xAmount</u>  to  the
           x-coordinate  of  each  point  associated with the item and <u>yAmount</u> to the y-coordinate of each point
           associated with the item.  This method returns an empty string.

       <u>$canvas</u>-&gt;<b>postscript</b>(?<u>option,</u> <u>value,</u> <u>option,</u> <u>value,</u> <u>...</u>?)
           Generate a Postscript representation for part or all of the canvas.  If the <b>-file</b> option is specified
           then the Postscript is written to a file and an empty string is returned;  otherwise  the  Postscript
           is  returned as the result of the method.  If the interpreter that owns the canvas is marked as safe,
           the operation will fail because safe interpreters are not allowed to write files.   If  the  <b>-channel</b>
           option  is  specified,  the  argument  denotes  the name of a channel already opened for writing. The
           Postscript is written to that channel, and the channel is left open for further writing at the end of
           the operation.  The Postscript is created in Encapsulated Postscript form using version  3.0  of  the
           Document Structuring Conventions.  Note: by default Postscript is only generated for information that
           appears in the canvas's window on the screen.  If the canvas is freshly created it may still have its
           initial  size  of  1x1  pixel  so  nothing will appear in the Postscript.  To get around this problem
           either invoke the <b>update</b> method to wait for the canvas window to reach its final size,  or  else  use
           the <b>-width</b> and <b>-height</b> options to specify the area of the canvas to print.  The <u>option</u>-<u>value</u> argument
           pairs  provide additional information to control the generation of Postscript.  The following options
           are supported:

           <b>-colormap</b> =&gt; <u>hashRef</u>
                   <u>HashRef</u> must be a reference to a hash variable or an anonymous hash that  specifies  a  color
                   mapping  to use in the Postscript.  Each value of the hash must consist of Postscript code to
                   set a particular color value (e.g. ``<b>1.0</b>  <b>1.0</b>  <b>0.0</b>  <b>setrgbcolor</b>'').   When  outputting  color
                   information  in  the Postscript, Tk checks to see if there is a key in the hash with the same
                   name as the color.  If so, Tk uses the value of the element as the Postscript method  to  set
                   the  color.   If  this option hasn't been specified, or if there isn't a key in <u>hashRef</u> for a
                   given color, then Tk uses the red, green, and blue intensities from the X color.

           <b>-colormode</b> =&gt; <u>mode</u>
                   Specifies how to output color information.   <u>Mode</u>  must  be  either  <b>color</b>  (for  full  color
                   output),  <b>gray</b>  (convert  all  colors  to  their gray-scale equivalents) or <b>mono</b> (convert all
                   colors to black or white).

           <b>-file</b> =&gt; <u>fileName</u>
                   Specifies the name of the file in which to  write  the  Postscript.   If  this  option  isn't
                   specified  then  the  Postscript  is  returned  as  the result of the method instead of being
                   written to a file.

           <b>-fontmap</b> =&gt; <u>hashRef</u>
                   <u>HashRef</u> must be a reference to a hash variable or an anonymous hash  that  specifies  a  font
                   mapping  to use in the Postscript.  Each value of the hash must consist of an array reference
                   with two elements, which are the name and point size of a Postscript font.   When  outputting
                   Postscript  commands for a particular font, Tk checks to see if <u>hashRef</u> contains a value with
                   the same name as the font.  If there is such an element, then the font information  contained
                   in  that  element  is used in the Postscript.  Otherwise Tk attempts to guess what Postscript
                   font to use.  Tk's guesses generally only  work  for  well-known  fonts  such  as  Times  and
                   Helvetica  and  Courier,  and only if the X font name does not omit any dashes up through the
                   point   size.     For    example,    <b>-*-Courier-Bold-R-Normal--*-120-*</b>    will    work    but
                   <b>*Courier-Bold-R-Normal*120*</b> will not;  Tk needs the dashes to parse the font name).

           <b>-height</b> =&gt; <u>size</u>
                   Specifies  the  height  of  the  area  of the canvas to print.  Defaults to the height of the
                   canvas window.

           <b>-pageanchor</b> =&gt; <u>anchor</u>
                   Specifies which point of the printed area of the canvas should appear  over  the  positioning
                   point  on  the  page  (which  is  given  by  the  <b>-pagex</b>  and  <b>-pagey</b> options).  For example,
                   <b>-pageanchor</b>=&gt;<b>n</b> means that the top center of the area of  the  canvas  being  printed  (as  it
                   appears in the canvas window) should be over the positioning point. Defaults to <b>center</b>.

           <b>-pageheight</b> =&gt; <u>size</u>
                   Specifies  that  the  Postscript should be scaled in both x and y so that the printed area is
                   <u>size</u> high on the Postscript page.  <u>Size</u> consists of a floating-point number followed by <b>c</b> for
                   centimeters, <b>i</b> for inches, <b>m</b> for millimeters, or <b>p</b> or  nothing  for  printer's  points  (1/72
                   inch).   Defaults  to  the height of the printed area on the screen.  If both <b>-pageheight</b> and
                   <b>-pagewidth</b> are specified then the scale factor from <b>-pagewidth</b> is used  (non-uniform  scaling
                   is not implemented).

           <b>-pagewidth</b> =&gt; <u>size</u>
                   Specifies  that  the  Postscript should be scaled in both x and y so that the printed area is
                   <u>size</u> wide on the Postscript page.  <u>Size</u> has the same form as for  <b>-pageheight</b>.   Defaults  to
                   the  width  of  the  printed  area  on  the  screen.   If both <b>-pageheight</b> and <b>-pagewidth</b> are
                   specified then the scale  factor  from  <b>-pagewidth</b>   is  used  (non-uniform  scaling  is  not
                   implemented).

           <b>-pagex</b> =&gt; <u>position</u>
                   <u>Position</u> gives the x-coordinate of the positioning point on the Postscript page, using any of
                   the  forms  allowed  for  <b>-pageheight</b>.   Used  in conjunction with the <b>-pagey</b> and <b>-pageanchor</b>
                   options to determine where the printed area appears on the Postscript page.  Defaults to  the
                   center of the page.

           <b>-pagey</b> =&gt; <u>position</u>
                   <u>Position</u> gives the y-coordinate of the positioning point on the Postscript page, using any of
                   the  forms  allowed  for  <b>-pageheight</b>.   Used  in conjunction with the <b>-pagex</b> and <b>-pageanchor</b>
                   options to determine where the printed area appears on the Postscript page.  Defaults to  the
                   center of the page.

           <b>-rotate</b> =&gt; <u>boolean</u>
                   <u>Boolean</u>  specifies  whether  the  printed  area  is to be rotated 90 degrees.  In non-rotated
                   output the  x-axis  of  the  printed  area  runs  along  the  short  dimension  of  the  page
                   (``portrait'' orientation); in rotated output the x-axis runs along the long dimension of the
                   page (``landscape'' orientation).  Defaults to non-rotated.

           <b>-width</b> =&gt; <u>size</u>
                   Specifies  the width of the area of the canvas to print.  Defaults to the width of the canvas
                   window.

           <b>-x</b> =&gt; <u>position</u>
                   Specifies the x-coordinate of the left edge of the area of the canvas that is to be  printed,
                   in  canvas  coordinates, not window coordinates.  Defaults to the coordinate of the left edge
                   of the window.

           <b>-y</b> =&gt; <u>position</u>
                   Specifies the y-coordinate of the top edge of the area of the canvas that is to  be  printed,
                   in canvas coordinates, not window coordinates.  Defaults to the coordinate of the top edge of
                   the window.

       <u>$canvas</u>-&gt;<b>raise</b>(<u>tagOrId,</u> ?<u>aboveThis</u>?)
           Move  all  of  the  items  given by <u>tagOrId</u> to a new position in the display list just after the item
           given by <u>aboveThis</u>.  If <u>tagOrId</u> refers to more than one item then all  are  moved  but  the  relative
           order  of  the moved items will not be changed.  <u>AboveThis</u> is a tag or id;  if it refers to more than
           one item then the last (topmost) of these items in the  display  list  is  used  as  the  destination
           location  for the moved items.  Note: this method has no effect on window items.  Window items always
           obscure other item types, and the stacking order of window items is determined by the <b>raise</b> and <b>lower</b>
           widget commands, not the <b>raise</b> and <b>lower</b> methods for canvases.  This method returns an empty string.

       <u>$canvas</u>-&gt;<b>scale</b>(<u>tagOrId,</u> <u>xOrigin,</u> <u>yOrigin,</u> <u>xScale,</u> <u>yScale</u>)
           Rescale all of the items given by <u>tagOrId</u> in canvas coordinate space.  <u>XOrigin</u> and  <u>yOrigin</u>  identify
           the  origin  for  the  scaling  operation and <u>xScale</u> and <u>yScale</u> identify the scale factors for x- and
           y-coordinates, respectively (a scale factor of 1.0 implies no change to that coordinate).   For  each
           of the points defining each item, the x-coordinate is adjusted to change the distance from <u>xOrigin</u> by
           a  factor of <u>xScale</u>.  Similarly, each y-coordinate is adjusted to change the distance from <u>yOrigin</u> by
           a factor of <u>yScale</u>.  This method returns an empty string.

       <u>$canvas</u>-&gt;<b>scan</b>(<u>option,</u> <u>args</u>)
           This method is used to implement scanning on canvases.  It has two forms, depending on <u>option</u>:

           <u>$canvas</u>-&gt;<b>scanMark</b>(<u>x,</u> <u>y</u>)
                   Records <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> and the canvas's current view;  used in  conjunction  with  later  <b>scanDragto</b>
                   method.   Typically  this  method is associated with a mouse button press in the widget and <u>x</u>
                   and <u>y</u> are the coordinates of the mouse.  It returns an empty string.

           <u>$canvas</u>-&gt;<b>scanDragto</b>(<u>x,</u> <u>y,</u> <u>?gain?</u>.)
                   This method computes the difference between its <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> arguments (which are typically  mouse
                   coordinates)  and  the <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> arguments to the last <b>scanMark</b> method for the widget.  It then
                   adjusts the view by 10 times  the  difference  in  coordinates.   This  method  is  typically
                   associated  It  then adjusts the view by <u>gain</u> times the difference in coordinates, where <u>gain</u>
                   defaults to 10.  This command is typically associated with mouse motion events in the widget,
                   to produce the effect of dragging the canvas at high speed through its  window.   The  return
                   value is an empty string.

       <u>$canvas</u>-&gt;<b>select</b>(<u>option,</u> ?<u>tagOrId,</u> <u>arg</u>?)
           Manipulates  the  selection  in one of several ways, depending on <u>option</u>.  The method may take any of
           the forms described below.  In all of the descriptions below, <u>tagOrId</u> must  refer  to  an  item  that
           supports  indexing  and  selection;   if  it  refers  to  multiple items then the first of these that
           supports indexing and the selection is used.  <u>Index</u> gives a textual description of a position  within
           <u>tagOrId</u>, as described in "INDICES" above.

           <u>$canvas</u>-&gt;<b>selectAdjust</b>(<u>tagOrId,</u> <u>index</u>)
                   Locate  the  end  of  the  selection  in <u>tagOrId</u> nearest to the character given by <u>index</u>, and
                   adjust that end of the selection to be at <u>index</u> (i.e. including but not going beyond  <u>index</u>).
                   The other end of the selection is made the anchor point for future <b>selectTo</b> method calls.  If
                   the  selection  isn't  currently in <u>tagOrId</u> then this method behaves the same as the <b>selectTo</b>
                   widget method.  Returns an empty string.

           <u>$canvas</u>-&gt;<b>selectClear</b>
                   Clear the selection if it is in this widget.  If the selection isn't in this widget then  the
                   method has no effect.  Returns an empty string.

           <u>$canvas</u>-&gt;<b>selectFrom</b>(<u>tagOrId,</u> <u>index</u>)
                   Set  the selection anchor point for the widget to be just before the character given by <u>index</u>
                   in the item given by <u>tagOrId</u>.  This method doesn't change the selection;  it  just  sets  the
                   fixed end of the selection for future <b>selectTo</b> method calls.  Returns an empty string.

           <u>$canvas</u>-&gt;<b>selectItem</b>
                   Returns  the  id of the selected item, if the selection is in an item in this canvas.  If the
                   selection is not in this canvas then an empty string is returned.

           <u>$canvas</u>-&gt;<b>selectTo</b>(<u>tagOrId,</u> <u>index</u>)
                   Set the selection to consist of those characters of  <u>tagOrId</u>  between  the  selection  anchor
                   point  and  <u>index</u>.   The  new  selection  will  include the character given by <u>index</u>; it will
                   include the character given by the anchor point only if <u>index</u> is greater than or equal to the
                   anchor point.  The anchor point is determined by the most recent <b>selectAdjust</b>  or  <b>selectFrom</b>
                   method  calls  for this widget.  If the selection anchor point for the widget isn't currently
                   in <u>tagOrId</u>, then it is set to the same character given by <u>index</u>.  Returns an empty string.

       <u>$canvas</u>-&gt;<b>type</b>(<u>tagOrId</u>)
           Returns the type of the item given by <u>tagOrId</u>, such as <b>rectangle</b> or <b>text</b>.  If <u>tagOrId</u> refers to  more
           than  one  item, then the type of the first item in the display list is returned.  If <u>tagOrId</u> doesn't
           refer to any items at all then an empty string is returned.

       <u>$canvas</u>-&gt;<b>xview</b>(?<u>args</u>?)
           This method is used to query and change the horizontal position of the information displayed  in  the
           canvas's window.  It can take any of the following forms:

           <u>$canvas</u>-&gt;<b>xview</b>
                   Returns  a  list  containing  two elements.  Each element is a real fraction between 0 and 1;
                   together they describe the horizontal span that is visible in the window.   For  example,  if
                   the first element is .2 and the second element is .6, 20% of the canvas's area (as defined by
                   the <b>-scrollregion</b> option) is off-screen to the left, the middle 40% is visible in the window,
                   and  40%  of  the  canvas  is  off-screen  to the right.  These are the same values passed to
                   scrollbars via the <b>-xscrollcommand</b> option.

           <u>$canvas</u>-&gt;<b>xviewMoveto</b>(<u>fraction</u>)
                   Adjusts the view in the window so that <u>fraction</u> of the total width  of  the  canvas  is  off-
                   screen to the left.  <u>Fraction</u> must be a fraction between 0 and 1.

           <u>$canvas</u>-&gt;<b>xviewScroll</b>(<u>number,</u> <u>what</u>)
                   This method shifts the view in the window left or right according to <u>number</u> and <u>what</u>.  <u>Number</u>
                   must  be  an integer.  <u>What</u> must be either <b>units</b> or <b>pages</b> or an abbreviation of one of these.
                   If <u>what</u> is <b>units</b>, the view adjusts left or right in units of the <b>xScrollIncrement</b> option,  if
                   it  is  greater than zero, or in units of one-tenth the window's width otherwise.  If <u>what</u> <u>is</u>
                   <b>pages</b> then the view adjusts in units  of  nine-tenths  the  window's  width.   If  <u>number</u>  is
                   negative  then  information  farther  to  the  left  becomes visible;  if it is positive then
                   information farther to the right becomes visible.

       <u>$canvas</u>-&gt;<b>yview</b>(<u>?args</u>?)
           This method is used to query and change the vertical position of the  information  displayed  in  the
           canvas's window.  It can take any of the following forms:

           <u>$canvas</u>-&gt;<b>yview</b>
                   Returns  a  list  containing  two elements.  Each element is a real fraction between 0 and 1;
                   together they describe the vertical span that is visible in the window.  For example, if  the
                   first  element  is  .6 and the second element is 1.0, the lowest 40% of the canvas's area (as
                   defined by the <b>-scrollregion</b> option) is visible in the window.  These  are  the  same  values
                   passed to scrollbars via the <b>-yscrollcommand</b> option.

           <u>$canvas</u>-&gt;<b>yviewMoveto</b>(<u>fraction</u>)
                   Adjusts  the  view  in  the window so that <u>fraction</u> of the canvas's area is off-screen to the
                   top.  <u>Fraction</u> is a fraction between 0 and 1.

           <u>$canvas</u>-&gt;<b>yviewScroll</b>(<u>number,</u> <u>what</u>)
                   This method adjusts the view in the window up or down according to <u>number</u> and  <u>what</u>.   <u>Number</u>
                   must  be an integer.  <u>What</u> must be either <b>units</b> or <b>pages</b>.  If <u>what</u> is <b>units</b>, the view adjusts
                   up or down in units of the <b>yScrollIncrement</b> option, if it is greater than zero, or  in  units
                   of  one-tenth the window's height otherwise.  If <u>what</u> is <b>pages</b> then the view adjusts in units
                   of nine-tenths the window's height.  If <u>number</u> is negative then  higher  information  becomes
                   visible;  if it is positive then lower information becomes visible.

</pre><h4><b>OVERVIEW</b> <b>OF</b> <b>ITEM</b> <b>TYPES</b></h4><pre>
       The  sections  below  describe the various types of items supported by canvas widgets.  Each item type is
       characterized by two things: first, the form of the <b>create</b> method used to create instances of  the  type;
       and  second,  a  set of configuration options for items of that type, which may be used in the <b>create</b> and
       <b>itemconfigure</b> methods.  Most items don't support indexing or selection or the methods  related  to  them,
       such  as  <b>index</b>  and  <b>insert</b>.   Where  items  do  support these facilities, it is noted explicitly in the
       descriptions below.  At present, text, line and polygon  items  provide  this  support.   For  lines  and
       polygons the indexing facility is used to manipulate the coordinates of the item.

</pre><h4><b>ARC</b> <b>ITEMS</b></h4><pre>
       Items  of type <b>arc</b> appear on the display as arc-shaped regions.  An arc is a section of an oval delimited
       by two angles (specified by the <b>-start</b> and  <b>-extent</b>  options)  and  displayed  in  one  of  several  ways
       (specified by the <b>-style</b> option).  Arcs are created with methods of the following form:

        $canvas-&gt;createArc(x1, y1, x2, y2, ?option, value, option, value, ...?)

       The arguments <u>x1</u>, <u>y1</u>, <u>x2</u>, and <u>y2</u> give the coordinates of two diagonally opposite corners of a rectangular
       region  enclosing  the  oval  that  defines  the  arc.   After the coordinates there may be any number of
       <u>option</u>-<u>value</u> pairs, each of which sets one of  the  configuration  options  for  the  item.   These  same
       <u>option</u>-<u>value</u>  pairs  may  be  used  in  <b>itemconfigure</b>  methods  to  change the item's configuration.  The
       following options are supported for arcs:

       <b>-dash</b> =&gt; <u>pattern</u>
       <b>-activedash</b> =&gt; <u>pattern</u>
       <b>-disableddash</b> =&gt; <u>pattern</u>
           This option specifies dash patterns for the normal state, the active state, and the disabled state of
           an arc item.  <u>pattern</u> may have any of the forms accepted by <b>Tk_GetDash</b>.   If  the  dash  options  are
           omitted then the default is a solid outline.

       <b>-dashoffset</b> =&gt; <u>offset</u>
           The  starting  <u>offset</u> into the pattern provided by the <b>-dash</b> option.  <b>-dashoffset</b> is ignored if there
           is no <b>-dash</b> pattern.

       <b>-extent</b> =&gt; <u>degrees</u>
           Specifies the size of the angular range occupied by the arc.  The arc's  range  extends  for  <u>degrees</u>
           degrees  counter-clockwise  from  the  starting  angle  given  by  the <b>-start</b> option.  <u>Degrees</u> may be
           negative.  If it is greater than 360 or less than -360, then  <u>degrees</u>  modulo  360  is  used  as  the
           extent.

       <b>-fill</b> =&gt; <u>color</u>
       <b>-activefill</b> =&gt; <u>color</u>
       <b>-disabledfill</b> =&gt; <u>color</u>
           Specifies  the  color  to  be used to fill the arc region in its normal, active, and disabled states,
           <u>Color</u> may have any of the forms accepted by <b>Tk_GetColor</b>.  If <u>color</u> is an empty string (the  default),
           then then the arc will not be filled.

       <b>-outline</b> =&gt; <u>color</u>
       <b>-activeoutline</b> =&gt; <u>color</u>
       <b>-disabledoutline</b> =&gt; <u>color</u>
           This  option  specifies  the  color that should be used to draw the outline of the arc in its normal,
           active and disabled states.  <u>Color</u> may have any of the forms accepted by  <b>Tk_GetColor</b>.   This  option
           defaults to <b>black</b>.  If <u>color</u> is specified as undef then no outline is drawn for the arc.

       <b>-outlinestipple</b> =&gt; <u>bitmap</u>
       <b>-activeoutlinestipple</b> =&gt; <u>bitmap</u>
       <b>-disabledoutlinestipple</b> =&gt; <u>bitmap</u>
           This  option  specifies  stipple  patterns  that should be used to draw the outline of the arc in its
           normal, active and disabled states.  Indicates that the outline for the arc should be  drawn  with  a
           stipple  pattern;  <u>bitmap</u>  specifies  the  stipple  pattern  to  use, in any of the forms accepted by
           <b>Tk_GetBitmap</b>.  If the <b>-outline</b> option hasn't been specified then  this  option  has  no  effect.   If
           <u>bitmap</u> is an empty string (the default), then the outline is drawn in a solid fashion.

       <b>-start</b> =&gt; <u>degrees</u>
           Specifies  the  beginning  of  the  angular  range occupied by the arc.  <u>Degrees</u> is given in units of
           degrees measured counter-clockwise from the  3-o'clock  position;   it  may  be  either  positive  or
           negative.

       <b>-state</b> =&gt; <u>state</u>
           Modifies  the state of the arc item where <u>state</u> may be set to one of: normal, disabled, hidden or "".
           If set to empty, the state of the canvas itself is used. An arc item may  also  be  in  the  "active"
           state  if  the  mouse is currently over it.  Many options can take separate specifications in normal,
           active and disabled states such that the appearance of the item can be different in each state.

       <b>-stipple</b> =&gt; <u>bitmap</u>
       <b>-activestipple</b> =&gt; <u>bitmap</u>
       <b>-disabledstipple</b> =&gt; <u>bitmap</u>
           This option specifies stipple patterns that should be used to fill the the arc in its normal,  active
           and  disabled  states.   <u>bitmap</u> specifies the stipple pattern to use, in any of the forms accepted by
           <b>Tk_GetBitmap</b>.  If the <b>-fill</b> option hasn't been specified then this option has no effect.   If  <u>bitmap</u>
           is an empty string (the default), then filling is done in a solid fashion.

       <b>-style</b> =&gt; <u>type</u>
           Specifies how to draw the arc.  If <u>type</u> is <b>pieslice</b> (the default) then the arc's region is defined by
           a section of the oval's perimeter plus two line segments, one between the center of the oval and each
           end  of the perimeter section.  If <u>type</u> is <b>chord</b> then the arc's region is defined by a section of the
           oval's perimeter plus a single line segment connecting the two end points of the  perimeter  section.
           If <u>type</u> is <b>arc</b> then the arc's region consists of a section of the perimeter alone.  In this last case
           the <b>-fill</b> option is ignored.

       <b>-tags</b> =&gt; <u>tagList</u>
           Specifies a set of tags to apply to the item.  <u>TagList</u> consists of a list of tag names, which replace
           any existing tags for the item.  <u>TagList</u> may be an empty list.

       <b>-updatecommand</b> =&gt; <u>command</u>
           Specifies a callback that is to be executed every time the arc item is updated on the screen.

       <b>-width</b> =&gt; <u>outlineWidth</u>
       <b>-activewidth</b> =&gt; <u>outlineWidth</u>
       <b>-disabledwidth</b> =&gt; <u>outlineWidth</u>
           Specifies  the  width  of  the outline to be drawn around the arc's region, in its normal, active and
           disabled states.  <u>outlineWidth</u> may be in any of the forms  described  in  the  "COORDINATES"  section
           above.   If  the  <b>-outline</b>  option  has been specified as undef then this option has no effect.  Wide
           outlines will be drawn centered on the edges of the arc's region.  This option defaults to 1.0.

</pre><h4><b>BITMAP</b> <b>ITEMS</b></h4><pre>
       Items of type <b>bitmap</b> appear on the display as images with two colors, foreground and background.  Bitmaps
       are created with methods of the following form:

        $canvas-&gt;createBitmap(x, y, ?option, value, option, value, ...?)

       The arguments <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> specify the coordinates of a point used to position the bitmap on the display  (see
       the <b>-anchor</b> option below for more information on how bitmaps are displayed).  After the coordinates there
       may  be  any  number  of  <u>option</u>-<u>value</u> pairs, each of which sets one of the configuration options for the
       item.  These same <u>option</u>-<u>value</u>  pairs  may  be  used  in  <b>itemconfigure</b>  methods  to  change  the  item's
       configuration.  The following options are supported for bitmaps:

       <b>-anchor</b> =&gt; <u>anchorPos</u>
           <u>AnchorPos</u>  tells  how  to position the bitmap relative to the positioning point for the item;  it may
           have any of the forms accepted by <b>Tk_GetAnchor</b>.  For example, if <u>anchorPos</u> is <b>center</b> then the  bitmap
           is  centered  on  the  point;  if <u>anchorPos</u> is <b>n</b> then the bitmap will be drawn so that its top center
           point is at the positioning point.  This option defaults to <b>center</b>.

       <b>-background</b> =&gt; <u>color</u>
       <b>-activebackground</b> =&gt; <u>color</u>
       <b>-disabledbackground</b> =&gt; <u>color</u>
           Specifies the color to use for each of the bitmap's '0' valued  pixels  in  its  normal,  active  and
           disabled  states.   <u>Color</u>  may  have  any of the forms accepted by <b>Tk_GetColor</b>.  If this option isn't
           specified, or if it is specified as undef, then nothing is displayed where the bitmap pixels  are  0;
           this produces a transparent effect.

       <b>-bitmap</b> =&gt; <u>bitmap</u>
       <b>-activebitmap</b> =&gt; <u>bitmap</u>
       <b>-disabledbitmap</b> =&gt; <u>bitmap</u>
           Specifies  the  bitmaps to display in the item in its normal, active and disabled states. All bitmaps
           must have the same width and height.  <u>Bitmap</u> may have any of the forms accepted by <b>Tk_GetBitmap</b>.

       <b>-foreground</b> =&gt; <u>color</u>
       <b>-activeforeground</b> =&gt; <u>color</u>
       <b>-disabledforeground</b> =&gt; <u>color</u>
           Specifies the color to use for each of the bitmap's '1' valued  pixels  in  its  normal,  active  and
           disabled states.  <u>Color</u> may have any of the forms accepted by <b>Tk_GetColor</b> and defaults to <b>black</b>.

       <b>-state</b> =&gt; <u>state</u>
           Modifies  the state of the bitmap item where <u>state</u> may be set to one of: normal, disabled, or hidden.
           An bitmap item may also be in the "active" state if the mouse is currently over it.  Many options can
           take separate specifications in normal, active and disabled states such that the  appearance  of  the
           item can be different in each state.

       <b>-tags</b> =&gt; <u>tagList</u>
           Specifies a set of tags to apply to the item.  <u>TagList</u> consists of a list of tag names, which replace
           any existing tags for the item.  <u>TagList</u> may be an empty list.

       <b>-updatecommand</b> =&gt; <u>command</u>
           Specifies a callback that is to be executed every time the bitmap item is updated on the screen.

</pre><h4><b>GRID</b> <b>ITEMS</b></h4><pre>
       Items  of  type <b>grid</b> are intended for producing a visual reference for interpreting other items. They can
       be drawn as either lines (with dash style) or as rectangular "dots" at each grid point.

       Items of type <b>grid</b> are unlike other items they always cover the  whole  of  the  canvas,  but  are  never
       enclosed  by  nor  overlap  any  area  and are not near any point. That is they are intended to be always
       visible but not "pickable", as such they do support the "active" state.  They are  like  other  items  in
       that:  multiple  grids are permitted, they can be raised and lowered relative to other items, they can be
       moved and scaled. As yet grids do not appear in PostScript output.

       Grids have outline like configure options. Grids are created with methods of the following form:

        $canvas-&gt;createGrid(x1, y1, x2, y2, ?option, value, option, value, ...?)

       The arguments <u>x1</u>, <u>y1</u> give the origin of the grid. <u>x2</u>, and <u>y2</u> give the coordinates of the next grid  point
       in  their  respective  directions.   After the coordinates there may be any number of <u>option</u>-<u>value</u> pairs,
       each of which sets one of the configuration options for the item.  These same <u>option</u>-<u>value</u> pairs  may  be
       used in <b>itemconfigure</b> methods to change the item's configuration.

       The following options are supported for grids:

       <b>-lines</b> =&gt; <u>boolean</u>
           If  <b>-lines</b> is set to a true value then lines are drawn for both X and Y grids in the style determined
           by <b>-dash</b>. Otherwise retangular "dots" are drawn at each grid point.

       <b>-dash</b> =&gt; <u>pattern</u>
       <b>-disableddash</b> =&gt; <u>pattern</u>
           This option specifies dash patterns for the normal state, and the disabled  state  of  a  grid  item.
           <u>pattern</u>  may  have any of the forms accepted by <b>Tk_GetDash</b>.  If the dash options are omitted then the
           default is a solid outline.

       <b>-dashoffset</b> =&gt; <u>offset</u>
           The starting <u>offset</u> into the pattern provided by the <b>-dash</b> option.  <b>-dashoffset</b> is ignored  if  there
           is no <b>-dash</b> pattern.

       <b>-color</b> =&gt; <u>color</u>
       <b>-disabledcolor</b> =&gt; <u>color</u>
           This option specifies the color that should be used to draw the outline of the grid in its normal and
           disabled  states.   <u>Color</u> may have any of the forms accepted by <b>Tk_GetColor</b>.  This option defaults to
           <b>black</b>.  If <u>color</u> is undef then no grid will be drawn.

       <b>-stipple</b> =&gt; <u>bitmap</u>
       <b>-disabledstipple</b> =&gt; <u>bitmap</u>
           This option specifies stipple patterns that should be used to draw the outline of  the  rectangle  in
           its  normal  and  disabled  states.  <u>bitmap</u> specifies the stipple pattern to use, in any of the forms
           accepted by <b>Tk_GetBitmap</b>.  If <u>bitmap</u> is an empty string (the default), then the outline is drawn in a
           solid fashion.

       <b>-state</b> =&gt; <u>state</u>
           Modifies the state of the rectangle item where <u>state</u> may be set  to  one  of:  normal,  disabled,  or
           hidden.  Many  options  can  take separate specifications in normal and disabled states such that the
           appearance of the item can be different in each state.

       <b>-tags</b> =&gt; <u>tagList</u>
           Specifies a set of tags to apply to the item.  <u>TagList</u> consists of a list of tag names, which replace
           any existing tags for the item.  <u>TagList</u> may be an empty list.

       <b>-updatecommand</b> =&gt; <u>command</u>

           Specifies the width of the lines drawn by the grid or the size (in both X and Y) of the dots, in  its
           normal and disabled states.  This option defaults to 1.0.

</pre><h4><b>IMAGE</b> <b>ITEMS</b></h4><pre>
       Items  of  type  <b>image</b>  are  used  to display images on a canvas.  Images are created with methods of the
       following form:

        $canvas-&gt;createImage(x, y, ?option, value, option, value, ...?)

       The arguments <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> specify the coordinates of a point used to position the image on the  display  (see
       the  <b>-anchor</b>  option  below  for  more  information).   After  the coordinates there may be any number of
       <u>option</u>-<u>value</u> pairs, each of which sets one of  the  configuration  options  for  the  item.   These  same
       <u>option</u>-<u>value</u>  pairs  may  be  used  in  <b>itemconfigure</b>  methods  to  change the item's configuration.  The
       following options are supported for images:

       <b>-anchor</b> =&gt; <u>anchorPos</u>
           <u>AnchorPos</u> tells how to position the image relative to the positioning point for  the  item;   it  may
           have  any  of the forms accepted by <b>Tk_GetAnchor</b>.  For example, if <u>anchorPos</u> is <b>center</b> then the image
           is centered on the point;  if <u>anchorPos</u> is <b>n</b> then the image will be drawn  so  that  its  top  center
           point is at the positioning point.  This option defaults to <b>center</b>.

       <b>-image</b> =&gt; <u>name</u>
       <b>-activeimage</b> =&gt; <u>name</u>
       <b>-disabledimage</b> =&gt; <u>name</u>
           Specifies  the  name  of  the images to display in the item in is normal, active and disabled states.
           This image must have been created previously, see Tk::Image.

       <b>-state</b> =&gt; <u>state</u>
           Modifies the state of the image item where <u>state</u> may be set to one of: normal, disabled,  or  hidden.
           An  image item may also be in the "active" state if the mouse is currently over it.  Many options can
           take separate specifications in normal, active and disabled states such that the  appearance  of  the
           item can be different in each state.

       <b>-tags</b> =&gt; <u>tagList</u>
           Specifies a set of tags to apply to the item.  <u>TagList</u> consists of a list of tag names, which replace
           any existing tags for the item;  it may be an empty list.

       <b>-updatecommand</b> =&gt; <u>command</u>
           Specifies a callback that is to be executed every time the image item is updated on the screen.

</pre><h4><b>LINE</b> <b>ITEMS</b></h4><pre>
       Items  of  type  <b>line</b> appear on the display as one or more connected line segments or curves.  Line items
       support coordinate indexing operations using the  canvas  methods:  <b>dchars,</b>  <b>index,</b>  <b>insert.</b>   Lines  are
       created with methods of the following form:

        $canvas-&gt;createLine(x1, y1..., xn, yn, ?option, value, option, value, ...?)

       The  arguments  <u>x1</u>  through  <u>yn</u>  give  the coordinates for a series of two or more points that describe a
       series of connected line segments.  After the coordinates there may be any number of <u>option</u>-<u>value</u>  pairs,
       each  of  which sets one of the configuration options for the item.  These same <u>option</u>-<u>value</u> pairs may be
       used in <b>itemconfigure</b> methods to change the item's configuration.  The following  options  are  supported
       for lines:

       <b>-arrow</b> =&gt; <u>where</u>
           Indicates whether or not arrowheads are to be drawn at one or both ends of the line.  <u>Where</u> must have
           one  of the values <b>none</b> (for no arrowheads), <b>first</b> (for an arrowhead at the first point of the line),
           <b>last</b> (for an arrowhead at the last point of the line), or <b>both</b> (for arrowheads at both  ends).   This
           option defaults to <b>none</b>.

       <b>-arrowshape</b> =&gt; <u>shape</u>
           This option indicates how to draw arrowheads.  The <u>shape</u> argument must be a list with three elements,
           each  specifying  a  distance  in any of the forms described in the "COORDINATES" section above.  The
           first element of the list gives the distance along the line from the neck of  the  arrowhead  to  its
           tip.   The second element gives the distance along the line from the trailing points of the arrowhead
           to the tip, and the third element gives the distance from  the  outside  edge  of  the  line  to  the
           trailing points.  If this option isn't specified then Tk picks a ``reasonable'' shape.

       <b>-capstyle</b> =&gt; <u>style</u>
           Specifies the ways in which caps are to be drawn at the endpoints of the line.  <u>Style</u> may have any of
           the  forms  accepted  by <b>Tk_GetCapStyle</b> (<b>butt</b>, <b>projecting</b>, or <b>round</b>).  If this option isn't specified
           then it defaults to <b>butt</b>.  Where arrowheads are drawn the cap style is ignored.

       <b>-dash</b> =&gt; <u>pattern</u>
       <b>-activedash</b> =&gt; <u>pattern</u>
       <b>-disableddash</b> =&gt; <u>pattern</u>
           This option specifies dash patterns for the normal state, the active state, and the disabled state of
           a line item.  <u>pattern</u> may have any of the forms accepted by <b>Tk_GetDash</b>.   If  the  dash  options  are
           omitted then the default is a solid outline.

       <b>-dashoffset</b> =&gt; <u>offset</u>
           The  starting  <u>offset</u> into the pattern provided by the <b>-dash</b> option.  <b>-dashoffset</b> is ignored if there
           is no <b>-dash</b> pattern.

       <b>-fill</b> =&gt; <u>color</u>
       <b>-activefill</b> =&gt; <u>color</u>
       <b>-disabledfill</b> =&gt; <u>color</u>
           Specifies the color to be used to fill the line in its normal, active, and  disabled  states.   <u>Color</u>
           may  have  any  of the forms acceptable to <b>Tk_GetColor</b>.  It may also be undef, in which case the line
           will be transparent.  This option defaults to <b>black</b>.

       <b>-joinstyle</b> =&gt; <u>style</u>
           Specifies the ways in which joints are to be drawn at the vertices of the line.  <u>Style</u> may  have  any
           of  the  forms  accepted  by <b>Tk_GetCapStyle</b> (<b>bevel</b>, <b>miter</b>, or <b>round</b>).  If this option isn't specified
           then it defaults to <b>miter</b>.  If the line only contains two points then this option is irrelevant.

       <b>-smooth</b> =&gt; <u>boolean</u>
           <u>Boolean</u> must have one of the forms accepted by <b>Tk_GetBoolean</b>.  It indicates whether or not  the  line
           should be drawn as a curve.  If so, the line is rendered as a set of parabolic splines: one spline is
           drawn for the first and second line segments, one for the second and third, and so on.  Straight-line
           segments can be generated within a curve by duplicating the end-points of the desired line segment.

       <b>-splinesteps</b> =&gt; <u>number</u>
           Specifies  the degree of smoothness desired for curves:  each spline will be approximated with <u>number</u>
           line segments.  This option is ignored unless the <b>-smooth</b> option is true.

       <b>-state</b> =&gt; <u>state</u>
           Modifies the state of the line item where <u>state</u> may be set to one of: normal, disabled, or hidden.  A
           line item may also be in the "active" state if the mouse is currently over it.  Many options can take
           separate specifications in normal, active and disabled states such that the appearance  of  the  item
           can be different in each state.

       <b>-stipple</b> =&gt; <u>bitmap</u>
       <b>-activestipple</b> =&gt; <u>bitmap</u>
       <b>-disabledstipple</b> =&gt; <u>bitmap</u>
           This option specifies stipple patterns that should be used to fill the the line in its normal, active
           and  disabled  states.   <u>bitmap</u> specifies the stipple pattern to use, in any of the forms accepted by
           <b>Tk_GetBitmap</b>.  If <u>bitmap</u> is an empty string (the default), then filling is done in a solid fashion.

       <b>-tags</b> =&gt; <u>tagList</u>
           Specifies a set of tags to apply to the item.  <u>TagList</u> consists of a list of tag names, which replace
           any existing tags for the item.  <u>TagList</u> may be an empty list.

       <b>-updatecommand</b> =&gt; <u>command</u>
           Specifies a callback that is to be executed every time the line item is updated on the screen.

       <b>-width</b> =&gt; <u>lineWidth</u>
       <b>-activewidth</b> =&gt; <u>lineWidth</u>
       <b>-disabledwidth</b> =&gt; <u>lineWidth</u>
           Specifies the width of the line in its normal, active and disabled states.  <u>lineWidth</u> may be  in  any
           of the forms described in the "COORDINATES" section above.

           Wide  lines  will  be  drawn  centered  on  the  path  specified by the points.  If this option isn't
           specified then it defaults to 1.0.

</pre><h4><b>OVAL</b> <b>ITEMS</b></h4><pre>
       Items of type <b>oval</b> appear as circular or oval regions on the display.  Each oval may have an  outline,  a
       fill, or both.  Ovals are created with methods of the following form:

        $canvas-&gt;createOval(x1, y1, x2, y2, ?option, value, option, value, ...?)

       The arguments <u>x1</u>, <u>y1</u>, <u>x2</u>, and <u>y2</u> give the coordinates of two diagonally opposite corners of a rectangular
       region  enclosing  the oval.  The oval will include the top and left edges of the rectangle not the lower
       or right edges.  If the region is square then the resulting oval is circular; otherwise it  is  elongated
       in shape.  After the coordinates there may be any number of <u>option</u>-<u>value</u> pairs, each of which sets one of
       the  configuration  options  for  the  item.   These same <u>option</u>-<u>value</u> pairs may be used in <b>itemconfigure</b>
       methods to change the item's configuration.  The following options are supported for ovals:

       <b>-dash</b> =&gt; <u>pattern</u>
       <b>-activedash</b> =&gt; <u>pattern</u>
       <b>-disableddash</b> =&gt; <u>pattern</u>
           This option specifies dash patterns for the normal state, the active state, and the disabled state of
           an oval item.  <u>pattern</u> may have any of the forms accepted by <b>Tk_GetDash</b>.  If  the  dash  options  are
           omitted then the default is a solid outline.

       <b>-dashoffset</b> =&gt; <u>offset</u>
           The  starting  <u>offset</u> into the pattern provided by the <b>-dash</b> option.  <b>-dashoffset</b> is ignored if there

           This option specifies stipple patterns that should be used to draw the outline of  the  oval  in  its
           normal, active and disabled states.  <u>bitmap</u> specifies the stipple pattern to use, in any of the forms
           accepted  by  <b>Tk_GetBitmap</b>.   If  the  <b>-outline</b>  option hasn't been specified then this option has no
           effect.  If <u>bitmap</u> is an empty string (the default), then the outline is drawn in a solid fashion.

       <b>-state</b> =&gt; <u>state</u>
           Modifies the state of the oval item where <u>state</u> may be set to one of: normal,  disabled,  or  hidden.
           An  oval  item may also be in the "active" state if the mouse is currently over it.  Many options can
           take separate specifications in normal, active and disabled states such that the  appearance  of  the
           item can be different in each state.

       <b>-stipple</b> =&gt; <u>bitmap</u>

           Specifies  the  width  of the outline to be drawn around the oval, in its normal, active and disabled
           states.  <u>outlineWidth</u> specifies the width of the outline to be drawn around the oval, in any  of  the
           forms described in the "COORDINATES" section above.

           If the <b>-outline</b> option hasn't been specified then this option has no effect.  Wide outlines are drawn
           centered on the oval path defined by <u>x1</u>, <u>y1</u>, <u>x2</u>, and <u>y2</u>.  This option defaults to 1.0.

</pre><h4><b>POLYGON</b> <b>ITEMS</b></h4><pre>
       Items of type <b>polygon</b> appear as polygonal or curved filled regions on the display.  Polygon items support
       coordinate  indexing  operations  using  the canvas methods: <b>dchars,</b> <b>index,</b> <b>insert.</b>  Polygons are created
       with methods of the following form:

        $canvas-&gt;createPolygon(x1, y1, ..., xn, yn, ?option, value, option, value, ...?)

       The arguments <u>x1</u> through <u>yn</u> specify the coordinates for  three  or  more  points  that  define  a  closed
       polygon.   The  first and last points may be the same;  whether they are or not, Tk will draw the polygon
       as a closed polygon.  After the coordinates there may be any number of <u>option</u>-<u>value</u> pairs, each of  which
       sets  one  of  the  configuration  options  for  the  item.  These same <u>option</u>-<u>value</u> pairs may be used in
       <b>itemconfigure</b> methods to change the item's  configuration.   The  following  options  are  supported  for
       polygons:

       <b>-dash</b> =&gt; <u>pattern</u>
       <b>-activedash</b> =&gt; <u>pattern</u>
       <b>-disableddash</b> =&gt; <u>pattern</u>
           This option specifies dash patterns for the normal state, the active state, and the disabled state of

       <b>-disabledfill</b> =&gt; <u>color</u>
           Specifies the color to be used to fill the polygon in its normal, active, and disabled states.  <u>Color</u>
           may  have  any  of  the  forms acceptable to <b>Tk_GetColor</b>.  If <u>color</u> is undef then the polygon will be
           transparent.  This option defaults to <b>black</b>.

       <b>-joinstyle</b> =&gt; <u>style</u>
           Specifies the ways in which joints are to be drawn at the vertices of the outline.   <u>Style</u>  may  have
           any of the forms accepted by <b>Tk_GetCapStyle</b> (<b>bevel</b>, <b>miter</b>, or <b>round</b>).  If this option isn't specified

       <b>-activeoutlinestipple</b> =&gt; <u>bitmap</u>
       <b>-disabledoutlinestipple</b> =&gt; <u>bitmap</u>
           This option specifies stipple patterns that should be used to draw the outline of the polygon in  its
           normal, active and disabled states.  <u>bitmap</u> specifies the stipple pattern to use, in any of the forms
           accepted  by  <b>Tk_GetBitmap</b>.   If  the  <b>-outline</b>  option hasn't been specified then this option has no
           effect.  If <u>bitmap</u> is an empty string (the default), then the outline is drawn in a solid fashion.

       <b>-smooth</b> =&gt; <u>boolean</u>
           <u>Boolean</u> must have one of the forms accepted by <b>Tk_GetBoolean</b> It indicates whether or not the  polygon
           should  be  drawn  with  a  curved  perimeter.   If  so,  the outline of the polygon becomes a set of
           parabolic splines, one spline for the first and second line segments, one for the second  and  third,
           and  so  on.   Straight-line  segments can be generated in a smoothed polygon by duplicating the end-
           points of the desired line segment.

       <b>-splinesteps</b> =&gt; <u>number</u>
           Specifies the degree of smoothness desired for curves:  each spline will be approximated with  <u>number</u>
           line segments.  This option is ignored unless the <b>-smooth</b> option is true.

       <b>-state</b> =&gt; <u>state</u>
           Modifies the state of the polygon item where <u>state</u> may be set to one of: normal, disabled, or hidden.
           A polygon item may also be in the "active" state if the mouse is currently over it.  Many options can
           take  separate  specifications  in normal, active and disabled states such that the appearance of the
           item can be different in each state.

       <b>-stipple</b> =&gt; <u>bitmap</u>
       <b>-activestipple</b> =&gt; <u>bitmap</u>
       <b>-disabledstipple</b> =&gt; <u>bitmap</u>
           This option specifies stipple patterns that should be used to fill the the  polygon  in  its  normal,
           active  and  disabled  states.   <u>bitmap</u>  specifies  the  stipple  pattern to use, in any of the forms
           accepted by <b>Tk_GetBitmap</b>.  If <u>bitmap</u> is an empty string (the default), then  filling  is  done  in  a
           solid fashion.

       <b>-tags</b> =&gt; <u>tagList</u>
           Specifies a set of tags to apply to the item.  <u>TagList</u> consists of a list of tag names, which replace
           any existing tags for the item.  <u>TagList</u> may be an empty list.

       <b>-updatecommand</b> =&gt; <u>command</u>
           Specifies a callback that is to be executed every time the polygon item is updated on the screen.

       <b>-width</b> =&gt; <u>outlineWidth</u>
       <b>-activewidth</b> =&gt; <u>outlineWidth</u>
       <b>-disabledwidth</b> =&gt; <u>outlineWidth</u>
       Specifies the width of the outline to be drawn around
           the  polygon,  in  its  normal,  active and disabled states.  <u>outlineWidth</u> may be in any of the forms
           described in the COORDINATES section above.  <u>OutlineWidth</u> specifies the width of the  outline  to  be
           drawn  around  the polygon, in any of the forms described in the "COORDINATES" section above.  If the
           <b>-outline</b> option hasn't been specified then this option has no effect.  This option defaults to 1.0.

           Polygon items are different from other items such as rectangles, ovals  and  arcs  in  that  interior
           points  are  considered  to  be  ``inside'' a polygon (e.g. for purposes of the <b>find</b> <b>closest</b> and <b>find</b>
           <b>overlapping</b> methods) even if it is not filled.  For most other  item  types,  an  interior  point  is
           considered  to  be  inside  the  item  only  if the item is filled or if it has neither a fill nor an
           outline.  If you would like an unfilled polygon whose interior points are not considered to be inside
           the polygon, use a line item instead.

</pre><h4><b>RECTANGLE</b> <b>ITEMS</b></h4><pre>
       Items of type <b>rectangle</b> appear as rectangular regions  on  the  display.   Each  rectangle  may  have  an
       outline, a fill, or both.  Rectangles are created with methods of the following form:

        $canvas-&gt;createRectangle(x1, y1, x2, y2, ?option, value, option, value, ...?)

       The arguments <u>x1</u>, <u>y1</u>, <u>x2</u>, and <u>y2</u> give the coordinates of two diagonally opposite corners of the rectangle
       (the  rectangle  will  include  its  upper  and  left edges but not its lower or right edges).  After the
       coordinates there may be any number of <u>option</u>-<u>value</u> pairs, each of which sets one  of  the  configuration
       options  for  the item.  These same <u>option</u>-<u>value</u> pairs may be used in <b>itemconfigure</b> methods to change the
       item's configuration.  The following options are supported for rectangles:

       <b>-dash</b> =&gt; <u>pattern</u>
       <b>-activedash</b> =&gt; <u>pattern</u>
       <b>-disableddash</b> =&gt; <u>pattern</u>
           This option specifies dash patterns for the normal state, the active state, and the disabled state of
           a rectangle item.  <u>pattern</u> may have any of the forms accepted by <b>Tk_GetDash</b>.  If the dash options are
           omitted then the default is a solid outline.

       <b>-dashoffset</b> =&gt; <u>offset</u>
           The starting <u>offset</u> into the pattern provided by the <b>-dash</b> option.  <b>-dashoffset</b> is ignored  if  there
           is no <b>-dash</b> pattern.

       <b>-fill</b> =&gt; <u>color</u>
       <b>-activefill</b> =&gt; <u>color</u>
       <b>-disabledfill</b> =&gt; <u>color</u>
           Specifies  the  color  to  be  used to fill the rectangle in its normal, active, and disabled states.
           <u>Color</u> may be specified in any of the forms accepted by <b>Tk_GetColor</b>.  If <u>color</u> is undef (the default),
           then the rectangle will not be filled.

       <b>-outline</b> =&gt; <u>color</u>
       <b>-activeoutline</b> =&gt; <u>color</u>
       <b>-disabledoutline</b> =&gt; <u>color</u>
           This option specifies the color that should be used to draw the  outline  of  the  rectangle  in  its
           normal,  active  and disabled states.  <u>Color</u> may have any of the forms accepted by <b>Tk_GetColor</b>.  This
           option defaults to <b>black</b>.  If <u>color</u> is undef then no outline will be drawn for the rectangle.

       <b>-outlinestipple</b> =&gt; <u>bitmap</u>
       <b>-activeoutlinestipple</b> =&gt; <u>bitmap</u>
       <b>-disabledoutlinestipple</b> =&gt; <u>bitmap</u>
           This option specifies stipple patterns that should be used to draw the outline of  the  rectangle  in
           its  normal,  active and disabled states.  <u>bitmap</u> specifies the stipple pattern to use, in any of the
           forms accepted by <b>Tk_GetBitmap</b>.  If the <b>-outline</b> option hasn't been specified then this option has no
           effect.  If <u>bitmap</u> is an empty string (the default), then the outline is drawn in a solid fashion.

       <b>-state</b> =&gt; <u>state</u>
           Modifies the state of the rectangle item where <u>state</u> may be set  to  one  of:  normal,  disabled,  or
           hidden.   A rectangle item may also be in the "active" state if the mouse is currently over it.  Many
           options can take separate specifications  in  normal,  active  and  disabled  states  such  that  the
           appearance of the item can be different in each state.

       <b>-stipple</b> =&gt; <u>bitmap</u>
       <b>-activestipple</b> =&gt; <u>bitmap</u>
       <b>-disabledstipple</b> =&gt; <u>bitmap</u>
           This  option  specifies stipple patterns that should be used to fill the the rectangle in its normal,
           active and disabled states.  <u>bitmap</u> specifies the stipple  pattern  to  use,  in  any  of  the  forms
           accepted  by <b>Tk_GetBitmap</b>.  If the <b>-fill</b> option hasn't been specified then this option has no effect.
           If <u>bitmap</u> is an empty string (the default), then filling is done in a solid fashion.

       <b>-tags</b> =&gt; <u>tagList</u>
           Specifies a set of tags to apply to the item.  <u>TagList</u> consists of a list of tag names, which replace
           any existing tags for the item.  <u>TagList</u> may be an empty list.

       <b>-updatecommand</b> =&gt; <u>command</u>
           Specifies a callback that is to be executed every time the rectangle item is updated on the screen.

       <b>-width</b> =&gt; <u>outlineWidth</u>
       <b>-activewidth</b> =&gt; <u>outlineWidth</u>
       <b>-disabledwidth</b> =&gt; <u>outlineWidth</u>
           Specifies the width of the outline to be drawn around  the  rectangle,  in  its  normal,  active  and
           disabled  states.   <u>OutlineWidth</u> specifies the width of the outline to be drawn around the rectangle,
           in any of the forms described in the "COORDINATES" section above.

           If the <b>-outline</b> option hasn't been specified then this option has no effect.  Wide outlines are drawn
           centered on the rectangular path defined by <u>x1</u>, <u>y1</u>, <u>x2</u>, and <u>y2</u>.  This option defaults to 1.0.

</pre><h4><b>TEXT</b> <b>ITEMS</b></h4><pre>
       A text item displays a string of characters on the screen in one  or  more  lines.   Text  items  support
       indexing  and  selection,  along with the following text-related canvas methods:  <b>dchars</b>, <b>focus</b>, <b>icursor</b>,
       <b>index</b>, <b>insert</b>, <b>select</b>.  Text items are created with methods of the following form:

        $canvas-&gt;createText(x, y, ?option, value, option, value, ...?)

       The arguments <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> specify the coordinates of a point used to position the text on  the  display  (see
       the options below for more information on how text is displayed).  After the coordinates there may be any
       number  of  <u>option</u>-<u>value</u>  pairs, each of which sets one of the configuration options for the item.  These
       same <u>option</u>-<u>value</u> pairs may be used in <b>itemconfigure</b> methods to change  the  item's  configuration.   The
       following options are supported for text items:

       <b>-anchor</b> =&gt; <u>anchorPos</u>
           <u>AnchorPos</u> tells how to position the text relative to the positioning point for the text;  it may have
           any  of  the  forms  accepted  by <b>Tk_GetAnchor</b>.  For example, if <u>anchorPos</u> is <b>center</b> then the text is
           centered on the point;  if <u>anchorPos</u> is <b>n</b> then the text will be drawn such that the top center  point
           of  the  rectangular  region  occupied  by  the  text  will be at the positioning point.  This option
           defaults to <b>center</b>.

       <b>-fill</b> =&gt; <u>color</u>
       <b>-activefill</b> =&gt; <u>color</u>
       <b>-disabledfill</b> =&gt; <u>color</u>
           Specifies the color to be used to fill the text in its normal, active, and  disabled  states.   <u>Color</u>
           may  have  any  of  the  forms  accepted  by  <b>Tk_GetColor</b>.   If  <u>color</u> is undef then the text will be
           transparent.  If this option isn't specified then it defaults to <b>black</b>.

       <b>-font</b> =&gt; <u>fontName</u>
           Specifies  the  font  to  use  for  the  text  item.   <u>FontName</u>  may  be  any  string  acceptable  to
           <b>Tk_GetFontStruct</b>.  If this option isn't specified, it defaults to a system-dependent font.

       <b>-justify</b> =&gt; <u>how</u>
           Specifies  how  to  justify the text within its bounding region.  <u>How</u> must be one of the values <b>left</b>,
           <b>right</b>, or <b>center</b>.  This option will only matter if the text is displayed as multiple lines.   If  the
           option is omitted, it defaults to <b>left</b>.

       <b>-state</b> =&gt; <u>state</u>
           Modifies the state of the text item where <u>state</u> may be set to one of: normal, disabled, or hidden.  A
           text item may also be in the "active" state if the mouse is currently over it.  Many options can take
           separate  specifications  in  normal, active and disabled states such that the appearance of the item
           can be different in each state.

       <b>-stipple</b> =&gt; <u>bitmap</u>
       <b>-activestipple</b> =&gt; <u>bitmap</u>
       <b>-disabledstipple</b> =&gt; <u>bitmap</u>
           This option specifies stipple patterns that should be used to fill the the text in its normal, active
           and disabled states.  <u>bitmap</u> specifies the stipple pattern to use, in any of the  forms  accepted  by
           <b>Tk_GetBitmap</b>.  If <u>bitmap</u> is an empty string (the default) then the text is drawn in a solid fashion.

       <b>-tags</b> =&gt; <u>tagList</u>
           Specifies a set of tags to apply to the item.  <u>TagList</u> consists of a list of tag names, which replace
           any existing tags for the item.  <u>TagList</u> may be an empty list.

       <b>-text</b> =&gt; <u>string</u>
           <u>String</u>  specifies  the  characters  to  be displayed in the text item.  Newline characters cause line
           breaks.  The characters in the item may also be changed with the <b>insert</b>  and  <b>delete</b>  methods.   This
           option defaults to an empty string.

       <b>-updatecommand</b> =&gt; <u>command</u>
           Specifies a callback that is to be executed every time the text item is updated on the screen.

       <b>-width</b> =&gt; <u>lineLength</u>
           Specifies  a  maximum  line  length  for the text, in any of the forms described in the "COORDINATES"
           section above.  If this option is zero (the default) the text is broken into lines  only  at  newline
           characters.   However,  if this option is non-zero then any line that would be longer than <u>lineLength</u>
           is broken just before a space character  to  make  the  line  shorter  than  <u>lineLength</u>;   the  space
           character is treated as if it were a newline character.

</pre><h4><b>WINDOW</b> <b>ITEMS</b></h4><pre>
       Items of type <b>window</b> cause a particular window to be displayed at a given position on the canvas.  Window
       items are created with methods of the following form:

           <u>$canvas</u>-&gt;<b>createWindow</b>(<u>x,</u> <u>y</u>?, <u>-option</u>=&gt;<u>value</u>, <u>-option</u>=&gt;<u>value</u>, ...?)

       The  arguments <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> specify the coordinates of a point used to position the window on the display (see
       the <b>-anchor</b> option below for more information on how bitmaps are displayed).  After the coordinates there
       may be any number of <u>option-value</u> pairs, each of which sets one of  the  configuration  options  for  the
       item.   These  same  <u>option</u>-<u>value</u>  pairs  may  be  used  in  <b>itemconfigure</b>  method  to  change the item's
       configuration.  The following options are supported for window items:

       <b>-anchor</b> =&gt; <u>anchorPos</u>
           <u>AnchorPos</u> tells how to position the window relative to the positioning point for the  item;   it  may
           have  any of the forms accepted by <b>Tk_GetAnchor</b>.  For example, if <u>anchorPos</u> is <b>center</b> then the window
           is centered on the point;  if <u>anchorPos</u> is <b>n</b> then the window will be drawn so  that  its  top  center
           point is at the positioning point.  This option defaults to <b>center</b>.

       <b>-height</b> =&gt; <u>pixels</u>
           Specifies  the  height to assign to the item's window.  <u>Pixels</u> may have any of the forms described in
           the "COORDINATES" section above.  If this option isn't specified, or if it is specified as  an  empty
           string, then the window is given whatever height it requests internally.

       <b>-state</b> =&gt; <u>state</u>
           Modifies the state of the window item where <u>state</u> may be set to one of: normal, disabled, or hidden.

       <b>-tags</b> =&gt; <u>tagList</u>
           Specifies a set of tags to apply to the item.  <u>TagList</u> consists of a list of tag names, which replace
           any existing tags for the item.  <u>TagList</u> may be an empty list.

       <b>-updatecommand</b> =&gt; <u>command</u>
           Specifies a callback that is to be executed every time the window item is updated on the screen.

       <b>-width</b> =&gt; <u>pixels</u>
           Specifies  the  width  to assign to the item's window.  <u>Pixels</u> may have any of the forms described in
           the "COORDINATES" section above.  If this option isn't specified, or if it is specified as  an  empty
           string, then the window is given whatever width it requests internally.

       <b>-window</b> =&gt; <u>$widget</u>
           Specifies  the  window to associate with this item.  The window specified by $widget must either be a
           child of the canvas widget or a child of some ancestor of the canvas widget.  <u>PathName</u> may not  refer
           to a top-level window.

           Note:   due  to  restrictions  in the ways that windows are managed, it is not possible to draw other
           graphical items (such as lines and images) on top of window items.  A window item always obscures any
           graphics that overlap it, regardless of their order in the display list.

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION-DEFINED</b> <b>ITEM</b> <b>TYPES</b></h4><pre>
       It is possible for individual applications to define new item types for canvas widgets using C code.  See
       the documentation for <b>Tk_CreateItemType</b>.

</pre><h4><b>BINDINGS</b></h4><pre>
       Canvas has default bindings to allow scrolling if necessary: &lt;Up&gt;, &lt;Down&gt;, &lt;Left&gt; and &lt;Right&gt; (and  their
       &lt;Control-*&gt;  counter  parts).   Further  &lt;Proir&gt;,  &lt;Next&gt;, &lt;Home&gt; and &lt;End&gt;.  These bindings allow you to
       navigate the same way as in other widgets that can scroll.

</pre><h4><b>Perl/Tk</b> <b>Methods</b></h4><pre>
       The following methods are added as perl code:

       $canvas-&gt;get_corners
           Returns the bounding box in Canvas coordinates of the visible portion  of  the  Canvas.  (Written  by
           Slaven Rezic.)

</pre><h4><b>CREDITS</b></h4><pre>
       Tk's  canvas  widget  is  a  blatant  ripoff  of  ideas  from  Joel Bartlett's <u>ezd</u> program.  <u>Ezd</u> provides
       structured graphics in a Scheme environment  and  preceded  canvases  by  a  year  or  two.   Its  simple
       mechanisms for placing and animating graphical objects inspired the functions of canvases.

</pre><h4><b>KEYWORDS</b></h4><pre>
