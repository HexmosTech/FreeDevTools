</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       FFI::Platypus::Type - Defining types for FFI::Platypus

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 2.10

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       OO Interface:

        use FFI::Platypus 2.00;
        my $ffi = FFI::Platypus-&gt;new( api =&gt; 2 );
        $ffi-&gt;type('int' =&gt; 'my_int');

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Note</b>: This document assumes that you are using "api =&gt; 2", which you should be using for all new code.

       This document describes how to define types using FFI::Platypus.  Types may be "defined" ahead of time,
       or simply used when defining or attaching functions.

        # Example of defining types
        use FFI::Platypus 2.00;
        my $ffi = FFI::Platypus-&gt;new( api =&gt; 2 );
        $ffi-&gt;type('int');
        $ffi-&gt;type('string');

        # Example of simply using types in function declaration or attachment
        my $f = $ffi-&gt;function(puts =&gt; ['string'] =&gt; 'int');
        $ffi-&gt;attach(puts =&gt; ['string'] =&gt; 'int');

       Unless you are using aliases the FFI::Platypus#type method is not necessary, but they will throw an
       exception if the type is incorrectly specified or not supported, which may be helpful for determining if
       the types are available or not.

       Note: This document sometimes uses the term "C Function" as short hand for function implemented in a
       compiled language.  Unless the term is referring literally to a C function example code, you can assume
       that it should also work with another compiled language.

   <b>meta</b> <b>information</b> <b>about</b> <b>types</b>
       You can get the size of a type using the FFI::Platypus#sizeof method.

        my $intsize = $ffi-&gt;sizeof('int');           # usually 4
        my $intarraysize = $ffi-&gt;sizeof('int[64]');  # usually 256

   <b>converting</b> <b>types</b>
       Sometimes it is necessary to convert types.  In particular various pointer types often need to be
       converted for consumption in Perl.  For this purpose the FFI::Platypus#cast method is provided.  It needs
       to be used with care though, because not all type combinations are supported.  Here are some useful ones:

        my $address = $ffi-&gt;cast('string' =&gt; 'opaque', $string);

       This converts a Perl string to a pointer address that can be used by functions that take an "opaque"
       type.  Be carefully though that the Perl string is not resized or free'd while in use from C code.

        my $string  = $ffi-&gt;cast('opaque' =&gt; 'string', $pointer);

       This does the opposite, converting a null terminated string (the type of strings used by C) into a Perl
       string.  In this case the string is copied, so the other language is free to deallocate or otherwise
       manipulate the string after the conversion without adversely affecting the Perl.

   <b>aliases</b>
       Some times using alternate names is useful for documenting the purpose of an argument or return type.
       For this "aliases" can be helpful.  The second argument to the FFI::Platypus#type method can be used to
       define a type alias that can later be used by function declaration and attachment.

        use FFI::Platypus 2.00;
        my $ffi = FFI::Platypus-&gt;new( api =&gt; 2 );
        $ffi-&gt;type('int'    =&gt; 'myint');
        $ffi-&gt;type('string' =&gt; 'mystring');
        my $f = $ffi-&gt;function( puts =&gt; ['mystring'] =&gt; 'myint' );
        $ffi-&gt;attach( puts =&gt; ['mystring'] =&gt; 'myint' );

       Aliases are contained without the FFI::Platypus object, so feel free to define your own crazy types
       without stepping on the toes of other CPAN developers using Platypus.

       One useful application of an alias is when you know types are different on two different platforms:

        if($^O eq 'MSWin32')
        {
          $type-&gt;type('sint16' =&gt; 'foo_t');
        } elsif($^O eq 'linux')
        {
          $type-&gt;type('sint32' =&gt; 'foo_t');
        }

        # function foo takes 16 bit signed integer on Windows
        # and a 32 bit signed integer on Linux.
        $ffi-&gt;attach( foo =&gt; [ 'foo_t' ] =&gt; 'void' );

</pre><h4><b>TYPE</b> <b>CATEGORIES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Native</b> <b>types</b>
       So called native types are the types that the CPU understands that can be passed on the argument stack or
       returned by a function.  It does not include more complicated types like arrays or structs, which can be
       passed via pointers (see the opaque type below).  Generally native types include void, integers, floats
       and pointers.

       <u>the</u> <u>void</u> <u>type</u>

       This can be used as a return value to indicate a function does not return a value (or if you want the
       return value to be ignored).

        $ffi-&gt;type( foo =&gt; [] =&gt; 'void' );

       Newer versions of Platypus also allow you to omit the return type and "void" is assumed.

        $ffi-&gt;type( foo =&gt; [] );

       It doesn't really make sense to use "void" in any other context.  However, because of historical reasons
       involving older versions of Perl.

       It doesn't really make sense for "void" to be passed in as an argument.  However, because C functions
       that take no arguments frequently are specified as taking "void" as this was required by older C
       compilers, as a special case you can specify a function's arguments as taking a single "void" to mean it
       takes no arguments.

        # C: void foo(void);
        $ffi-&gt;type( foo =&gt; ['void'] );
        # same (but probably better)
        $ffi-&gt;type( foo =&gt; [] );

       <u>integer</u> <u>types</u>

       The following native integer types are always available (parentheticals indicates the usual corresponding
       C type):

       sint8
           Signed 8 bit byte ("signed char", "int8_t").

       uint8
           Unsigned 8 bit byte ("unsigned char", "uint8_t").

       sint16
           Signed 16 bit integer ("short", "int16_t")

       uint16
           Unsigned 16 bit integer ("unsigned short", "uint16_t")

       sint32
           Signed 32 bit integer ("int", "int32_t")

       uint32
           Unsigned 32 bit integer ("unsigned int", "uint32_t")

       sint64
           Signed 64 bit integer ("long long", "int64_t")

       uint64
           Unsigned 64 bit integer ("unsigned long long", "uint64_t")

       You  may  also  use  "uchar",  "ushort", "uint" and "ulong" as short names for "unsigned char", "unsigned
       short", "unsigned int" and "unsigned long".

       These integer types are also available, but there actual size and sign may depend on the platform.

       char
           Somewhat confusingly, "char" is an integer type!  This is really an alias  for  either  "sint8_t"  or
           "uint8_t"  depending  on  your  platform.   If  you  want to pass a character (not integer) in to a C
           function that takes a character you want to use the perl ord function.  Here is an example that  uses
           the standard libc "isalpha", "isdigit" type functions:

            use FFI::Platypus 2.00;

            my $ffi = FFI::Platypus-&gt;new( api =&gt; 2 );
            $ffi-&gt;lib(undef);
            $ffi-&gt;type('int' =&gt; 'character');

            my @list = qw(
              alnum alpha ascii blank cntrl digit lower print punct
              space upper xdigit
            );

            $ffi-&gt;attach("is$_" =&gt; ['character'] =&gt; 'int') for @list;

            my $char = shift(@ARGV) || 'a';

            no strict 'refs';
            printf "'%s' is %s %s\n", $char, $_, &amp;{'is'.$_}(ord $char) for @list;

       size_t
           This is usually an "unsigned long", but it is up to the compiler to decide.  The "malloc" function is
           defined in terms of "size_t":

            $ffi-&gt;attach( malloc =&gt; ['size_t'] =&gt; 'opaque';

           (Note that you can get "malloc" from FFI::Platypus::Memory).

       long, unsigned long
           On  64  bit systems, this is usually a 64 bit integer.  On 32 bit systems this is frequently a 32 bit
           integer (and "long long" or "unsigned long long" are for 64 bit).

       There are a number of other  types  that  may  or  may  not  be  available  if  they  are  detected  when
       FFI::Platypus  is  installed.   This  includes things like "wchar_t", "off_t", "wint_t". You can use this
       script to list all the integer types that FFI::Platypus knows about, plus how they are implemented.

        use FFI::Platypus 2.00;

        my $ffi = FFI::Platypus-&gt;new( api =&gt; 2 );

        foreach my $type_name (sort $ffi-&gt;types)
        {
          my $meta = $ffi-&gt;type_meta($type_name);
          next unless defined $meta-&gt;{element_type} &amp;&amp; $meta-&gt;{element_type} eq 'int';
          printf "%20s %s\n", $type_name, $meta-&gt;{ffi_type};
        }

       If you need a common system type that is not provided, please open a ticket  in  the  Platypus  project's
       GitHub issue tracker.  Be sure to include the usual header file the type can be found in.

       <u>Enum</u> <u>types</u>

       C provides enumerated types, which are typically implemented as integer types.

        enum {
          BAR = 1,
          BAZ = 2
        } foo_t;

        void f(enum foo_t foo);

       Platypus  provides  "enum" and "senum" types for the integer types used to represent enum and signed enum
       types respectively.

        use constant BAR =&gt; 1;
        use constant BAZ =&gt; 2;
        $ffi-&gt;attach( f =&gt; [ 'enum' ] =&gt; 'void' );
        f(BAR);
        f(BAZ);

       When do you use "senum"?  Anytime the enum has negative values:

        enum {
          BAR = -1;
          BAZ = 2;
        } foo_t;

        void f(enum foo_t foo);

       Perl:

        use constant BAR =&gt; -1;
        use constant BAZ =&gt; 2;
        $ffi-&gt;attach( f =&gt; [ 'senum' ] =&gt; 'void' );
        f(BAR);
        f(BAZ);

       Dealing with enumerated values with FFI can be tricky because these are usually defined in C header files
       and cannot be found in dynamic libraries.  For trivial usage you can  do  as  illustrated  above,  simply
       define your own Perl constants.  For more complicated usage, or where the values might vary from platform
       to  platform  you  may  want  to  consider  the  new  Platypus  bundle interface to define Perl constants
       (essentially the same as an enumerated value) from C space.  This is more reliable, but  does  require  a
       compiler at install time.  See FFI::Platypus::Constant for details.

       The  main  FAQ  ("FAQ"  in  FFI::Platypus) also has a discussion on dealing with constants and enumerated
       types.

       There is also a type plugin (FFI::Platypus::Type::Enum) that can be helpful in  writing  interfaces  that
       use enums.

       <u>Boolean</u> <u>types</u>

       At  install  time  Platypus attempts to detect the correct type for "bool" for your platform, and you can
       use that.  "bool" is really an integer type, but the type used varies from platform to platform.

       C header:

        #include &lt;stdbool.h&gt;
        bool foo();

       Platypus

        $ffi-&gt;attach( foo =&gt; [] =&gt; 'bool' );

       If you get an exception when trying to use this type it means you either  have  a  very  old  version  of
       Platypus,  or  for  some  reason it was unable to detect the correct type at install time.  Please open a
       ticket if that is the case.

       <u>floating</u> <u>point</u> <u>types</u>

       The following native floating point types  are  always  available  (parentheticals  indicates  the  usual
       corresponding C type):

       float
           Single precision floating point (<u>float</u>)

       double
           Double precision floating point (<u>double</u>)

       longdouble
           Floating  point  that  may  be  larger  than  "double"  (<u>longdouble</u>).  This type is only available if
           supported by the C compiler used to build FFI::Platypus.  There may  be  a  performance  penalty  for
           using  this  type,  even  if  your  Perl uses long doubles internally for its number value (NV) type,
           because of the way FFI::Platypus interacts with "libffi".

           As an argument type either regular number values (NV) or instances of Math::LongDouble are  accepted.
           When  used  as  a  return  type,  Math::LongDouble  will  be used, if you have that module installed.
           Otherwise the return type will be downgraded to whatever your Perl's number value (NV) is.

       complex_float
           Complex single precision floating point (<u>float</u> <u>complex</u>)

       complex_double
           Complex double precision floating point (<u>double</u> <u>complex</u>)

           "complex_float" and "complex_double" are only available if  supported  by  your  C  compiler  and  by
           libffi.  Complex numbers are only supported in very recent versions of libffi, and as of this writing
           the  latest  production  version  doesn't  work  on  x86_64.   It  does  seem to work with the latest
           production version of libffi on 32 bit Intel (x86), and with the latest  libffi  version  in  git  on
           x86_64.

       <u>opaque</u> <u>pointers</u>

       Opaque  pointers  are  simply  a pointer to a region of memory that you do not manage, and do not know or
       care about its structure. It is like a "void *" in C.  These types  are  represented  in  Perl  space  as
       integers  and get converted to and from pointers by FFI::Platypus.  You may use "pointer" as an alias for
       "opaque", although this is discouraged.   (The  Platypus  documentation  uses  the  convention  of  using
       "pointer" to refer to pointers to known types (see below) and "opaque" as short hand for opaque pointer).

       As  an  example,  libarchive  defines  "struct archive" type in its header files, but does not define its
       content.  Internally it is defined as a "struct" type, but the caller does not see this.  It is therefore
       opaque to its caller.  There are "archive_read_new" and "archive_write_new" functions  to  create  a  new
       instance  of  this opaque object and "archive_read_free" and "archive_write_free" to destroy this objects
       when you are done.

       C header:

        struct archive;
        struct archive *archive_read_new(void);
        struct archive *archive_write_new(void);
        int archive_free(struct archive *);
        int archive_write_free(struct archive *);

       Perl code:

        $lib-&gt;find_lib( lib =&gt; 'archive' );
        $ffi-&gt;attach(archive_read_new   =&gt; []         =&gt; 'opaque');
        $ffi-&gt;attach(archive_write_new  =&gt; []         =&gt; 'opaque');
        $ffi-&gt;attach(archive_read_free  =&gt; ['opaque'] =&gt; 'int');
        $ffi-&gt;attach(archive_write_free =&gt; ['opaque'] =&gt; 'int');

       It is often useful to alias an "opaque" type like this so that you know what the object represents:

        $lib-&gt;find_lib( lib =&gt; 'archive' );
        $ffi-&gt;type('opaque' =&gt; 'archive');
        $ffi-&gt;attach(archive_read_new   =&gt; [] =&gt; 'archive');
        $ffi-&gt;attach(archive_read_free  =&gt; ['archive'] =&gt; 'int');
        ...

       As a special case, when you pass "undef" into a function that takes an opaque type it will be  translated
       into "NULL" for C.  When a C function returns a NULL pointer, it will be translated back to "undef".

       For  functions  that  take a pointer to a void pointer (that is a "void **"), you can use a pointer to an
       opaque type.  Consider the C code:

        struct archive_entry;
        int archive_read_next_header(struct archive *, struvct archive_entry **);

       Once again the internals of "archive_entry" are not provided.  Perl code:

        $ffi-&gt;type('opaque' =&gt; 'archive_entry');
        $ffi-&gt;attach(archive_read_next_header =&gt; [ 'archive', 'archive_entry*' ] =&gt; 'int');

       Now we can call this function

        my $archive = archive_read_new();
        ...  # additional prep for $active is required
        <a href="../man1/while.1.html">while</a>(1) {
          my $entry;
          archive_read_next_header($archive, \$entry);
          last unless defined $entry;
          # can now use $entry for other archive_entry_ methods.
        }

       The way "archive_read_next_header" works, it will return a pointer to  the  next  "archive_entry"  object
       until  it gets to the end, when it will return a pointer to "NULL" which will be represented in Perl by a
       "undef".

       There are a number of useful utility functions for dealing with opaque types in the FFI::Platypus::Memory
       module.

   <b>Objects</b>
       Object types are thin wrappers around two native types:  integer  and  "opaque"  types.   They  are  just
       blessed references around either of those two types so that methods can be defined on them, but when they
       get passed to a Platypus xsub they are converted into the native integer or "opaque" types.  This type is
       most  useful  when  a  API  provides an OO style interface with an integer or "opaque" value acting as an
       instance of a class.  There are two detailed examples in the main Platypus documentation using libarchive
       and unix open:

       "libarchive" in FFI::Platypus
       "unix open" in FFI::Platypus

   <b>Strings</b>
        # used when you need a char * or const char *
        $ffi-&gt;attach( puts =&gt; [ 'string' ] =&gt; 'int' );

       The "string" type is a series of bytes that usually represent a series of characters.  They will be  NULL
       terminated  for C and passed in as a pointer.  This will typically work for APIs that take ASCII or UTF-8
       strings which are common in Unix environments.

       (Note if you need to handle the native "wide" string for example if you need to talk  UTF-16  on  Windows
       see FFI::Platypus::Type::WideString).

       (Note  if  you need to pass in a fixed length string by value (not as a pointer) then you can do so using
       FFI::Platypus::Record).

       (Note that languages like Go and Rust do not use NULL terminated strings and need their own string types;
       see the appropriate language plugins for details)

        # can also be used when you need a void * or const void *
        $ffi-&gt;attach( write =&gt; ['int', 'string', 'size_t' ] =&gt; 'ssizet' );

       The "string" type can also be used to pass in the start of a buffer of arbitrary bytes stored in  a  Perl
       scalar.   Because  a "string" is passed just as a pointer you will typically need to also pass the length
       of the buffer as a separate argument.  This is necessary because buffers could potentially have a NULL in
       them.

       The pointer passed into C (or other language) is to the content of the actual scalar, which means it  can
       modify the content of a scalar.

       <b>NOTE</b>:  When  used as a return type, the string is <u>copied</u> into a new scalar rather than using the original
       address.  This is due to the ownership model of scalars in Perl, but it is also most of the time what you
       want.

       This can be problematic when a function returns a string that the callee is expected to  free.   Consider
       the functions:

        char *
        get_string()
        {
          char *buffer;
          buffer = <a href="../man20/malloc.20.html">malloc</a>(20);
          strcpy(buffer, "Perl");
        }

        void
        free_string(char *buffer)
        {
          free(buffer);
        }

       This  API  returns a string that you are expected to free when you are done with it.  (At least they have
       provided an API for freeing the string instead of expecting you to call libc free)!  A simple binding  to
       get the string would be:

        $ffi-&gt;attach( get_string =&gt; [] =&gt; 'string' );  # memory leak
        my $str = get_string();

       Which  will  work  to a point, but the memory allocated by get_string will leak.  Instead you need to get
       the opaque pointer, cast it to a string and then free it.

        $ffi-&gt;attach( get_string =&gt; [] =&gt; 'opaque' );
        $ffi-&gt;attach( free_string =&gt; ['opaque'] =&gt; 'void' );
        my $ptr = get_string();
        my $str = $ffi-&gt;cast( 'opaque' =&gt; 'string', $ptr );  # copies the string
        free_string($ptr);

       If you are doing this sort of thing a lot, it can be worth adding a custom type:

        $ffi-&gt;attach( free_string =&gt; ['opaque'] =&gt; 'void' );
        $ffi-&gt;custom_type( 'my_string' =&gt; {
          native_type =&gt; 'opaque',
          native_to_perl =&gt; sub {
            my($ptr) = @_;
            my $str = $ffi-&gt;cast( 'opaque' =&gt; 'string', $ptr ); # copies the string
            free_string($ptr);
            $str;
          }
        });

        $ffi-&gt;attach( get_string =&gt; [] =&gt; 'my_string' );
        my $str = get_string();

       Since version 0.62, pointers and arrays to strings are supported as a first class type.   Prior  to  that
       FFI::Platypus::Type::StringArray  and  FFI::Platypus::Type::StringPointer could be used, though their use
       in new code is discouraged.

        $ffi-&gt;attach( foo =&gt; ['string[]'] =&gt; 'void' );
        foo( [ 'array', 'of', 'strings' ] );

        $ffi-&gt;attach( bar =&gt; ['string*'] =&gt; 'void' );
        my $string = 'baz';
        bar( \$string );  # $string may be modified.

       Strings are not allowed as return types from closure.  This, again is  due  to  the  ownership  model  of
       scalars  in  Perl.   (There  is  no  way  for  Perl to know when calling language is done with the memory
       allocated to the string).  Consider the API:

        typedef const char *(*get_message_t)(void);

        void
        print_message(get_message_t get_message)
        {
          const char *str;
          str = get_message();
          printf("message = %s\n", str);
        }

       It feels like this should be able to work:

        $ffi-&gt;type('()-&gt;string' =&gt; 'get_message_t'); # not ok
        $ffi-&gt;attach( print_message =&gt; ['get_message_t'] =&gt; 'void' );
        my $get_message = $ffi-&gt;closure(sub {
          return "my message";
        });
        print_message($get_message);

       If the type declaration for "get_message_t" were legal, then this script would likely segfault or in  the
       very  least  corrupt  memory.   The  problem  is that once "my message" is returned from the closure Perl
       doesn't have a reference to it anymore and will free it.  To do this safely, you have to keep a reference
       to the scalar around and return an opaque pointer to the string using a cast.

        $ffi-&gt;type('()-&gt;opaque' =&gt; 'get_message_t');
        $ffi-&gt;attach( print_message =&gt; ['get_message_t'] =&gt; 'void' );
        my $get_message =&gt; $ffi-&gt;closure(sub {
          our $message = "my message";  # needs to be our so that it doesn't
                                        # get free'd
          my $ptr = $ffi-&gt;cast('string' =&gt; 'opaque', $message);
          return $ptr;
        });
        print_message($get_message);

       Another type of string that you may run into with some APIs is the so called "wide" string.   In  your  C
       code  if  you  see  "wchar_t*" or "const wchar_t*" or if in Win32 API code you see "LPWSTR" or "LPCWSTR".
       Most commonly you will see these types when working with the Win32 API, but you may see them in  Unix  as
       well.   These types are intended for dealing with Unicode, but they do not use the same UTF-8 format used
       by Perl internally, so they need to be converted.  You can do this manually by allocating the memory  and
       using  the  Encode  module,  but  the  easier  way  is  to  use either FFI::Platypus::Type::WideString or
       FFI::Platypus::Lang::Win32, which handle the memory allocation and conversion for you.

       String types can be defined to have a fixed length using a trailing  parenthetical  like  so  <a href="../man10/string.10.html">string</a>(10).
       For  arguments this has little practical effect since the strings are passed as pointers anyway, but does
       impact return values.  If a function that returns a <a href="../man10/string.10.html">string</a>(10) type returns a string  that  is  not  NULL
       terminated, only the first ten bytes will be returned in the result.

       Internally  fixed  length  strings  are  implemented  the  same as classless record types (that is to say
       <a href="../man10/string.10.html">string</a>(10) is identically internally to "<a href="../man10/record.10.html">record</a>(10)*").

       For the 1.00 Platypus API, the <a href="../man10/string.10.html">string</a>(10) type was specified as a pointer (that is "<a href="../man10/string.10.html">string</a>(10)*").   This
       was a mistake, but you can still use the latter as an alias for the correct form in the 2.00 API.

   <b>Pointers</b> <b>and</b> <b>Arrays</b> <b>of</b> <b>Strings</b>
       As  of  the  1.00  Platypus  API,  you  can specify pointers to strings ("string*") and arrays of strings
       ("string[10]").  Since strings themselves are passed as pointers, this means these types are passed in as
       pointers to pointers.  If the pointer to the string is changed then when the function returns the  scalar
       or array will be updated as well.

   <b>Pointer</b> <b>/</b> <b>References</b>
       In  C  you  can  pass  a  pointer  to  a  variable  to a function in order accomplish the task of pass by
       reference.  In Perl the same task is accomplished by passing a reference (although you  can  also  modify
       the argument stack thus Perl supports proper pass by reference as well).

       With  FFI::Platypus  you can define a pointer to any native, string or record type.  You cannot (at least
       not yet) define a pointer to a pointer or a  pointer  to  an  array  or  any  other  type  not  otherwise
       supported.  When passing in a pointer to something you must make sure to pass in a reference to a scalar,
       or "undef" ("undef" will be translated int "NULL").

       If  the  C  code makes a change to the value pointed to by the pointer, the scalar will be updated before
       returning to Perl space.  Example, with C code.

        /* foo.c */
        void increment_int(int *value)
        {
          if(value != NULL)
            (*value)++;
          else
            fprintf(stderr, "NULL pointer!\n");
        }

        # foo.pl
        use FFI::Platypus 2.00;
        my $ffi = FFI::Platypus-&gt;new( api =&gt; 2 );
        $ffi-&gt;lib('libfoo.so'); # change to reflect the dynamic lib
                                # that contains foo.c
        $ffi-&gt;type('int*' =&gt; 'int_p');
        $ffi-&gt;attach(increment_int =&gt; ['int_p'] =&gt; 'void');
        my $i = 0;
        increment_int(\$i);   # $i == 1
        increment_int(\$i);   # $i == 2
        increment_int(\$i);   # $i == 3
        increment_int(undef); # prints "NULL pointer!\n"

       Older versions of Platypus did not support pointers to strings or records.

   <b>Records</b>
       Records are structured data of a fixed length.  In C they are called "struct"s.

       For most C structured data, as long as you do not need to a record by value, FFI::C is the better choice.
       Briefly, FFI::C supports "struct", "union", and arrays of "struct" and "unions".  FFI::C does not support
       passing by value.  The reminder of this section will discuss only the "record" type.

       To declare a record type, use "record":

        $ffi-&gt;type( 'record (42)' =&gt; 'my_record_of_size_42_bytes' );

       The easiest way to mange records with Platypus is by  using  FFI::Platypus::Record  to  define  a  record
       layout for a record class.  Here is a brief example:

        package Unix::TimeStruct;

        use FFI::Platypus 2.00;
        use FFI::Platypus::Record;

        record_layout_1(qw(
            int    tm_sec
            int    tm_min
            int    tm_hour
            int    tm_mday
            int    tm_mon
            int    tm_year
            int    tm_wday
            int    tm_yday
            int    tm_isdst
            long   tm_gmtoff
            string tm_zone
        ));

        my $ffi = FFI::Platypus-&gt;new( api =&gt; 2 );
        $ffi-&gt;lib(undef);
        # define a record class Unix::TimeStruct and alias it to "tm"
        $ffi-&gt;type("record(Unix::TimeStruct)*" =&gt; 'tm');

        # attach the C localtime function as a constructor
        $ffi-&gt;attach( localtime =&gt; ['time_t*'] =&gt; 'tm', sub {
          my($inner, $class, $time) = @_;
          $time = time unless defined $time;
          $inner-&gt;(\$time);
        });

        package main;

        # now we can actually use our Unix::TimeStruct class
        my $time = Unix::TimeStruct-&gt;localtime;
        printf "time is %d:%d:%d %s\n",
          $time-&gt;tm_hour,
          $time-&gt;tm_min,
          $time-&gt;tm_sec,
          $time-&gt;tm_zone;

       For more detailed usage, see FFI::Platypus::Record.

       Platypus does not manage the structure of a record (that is up to you), it just keeps track of their size
       and  makes  sure  that  they are copied correctly when used as a return type.  A record in Perl is just a
       string of bytes stored as a scalar.  In addition to defining a record layout for a  record  class,  there
       are  a  number  of tools you can use manipulate records in Perl, two notable examples are pack and unpack
       and Convert::Binary::C.

       Here is an example with commentary that uses Convert::Binary::C to extract the component time values from
       the C "localtime" function, and then smushes  them  back  together  to  get  the  original  "time_t"  (an
       integer).

        use Convert::Binary::C;
        use FFI::Platypus 2.00;
        use Data::Dumper qw( Dumper );

        my $c = Convert::Binary::C-&gt;new;

        # Alignment of zero (0) means use
        # the alignment of your CPU
        $c-&gt;configure( Alignment =&gt; 0 );

        # parse the tm record structure so
        # that Convert::Binary::C knows
        # what to spit out and suck in
        $c-&gt;parse(&lt;&lt;ENDC);
        struct tm {
          int tm_sec;
          int tm_min;
          int tm_hour;
          int tm_mday;
          int tm_mon;
          int tm_year;
          int tm_wday;
          int tm_yday;
          int tm_isdst;
          long int tm_gmtoff;
          const char *tm_zone;
        };
        ENDC

        # get the size of tm so that we can give it
        # to Platypus
        my $tm_size = $c-&gt;sizeof("tm");

        # create the Platypus instance and create the appropriate
        # types and functions
        my $ffi = FFI::Platypus-&gt;new( api =&gt; 2 );
        $ffi-&gt;lib(undef);
        $ffi-&gt;type("record($tm_size)*" =&gt; 'tm');
        $ffi-&gt;attach( [ localtime =&gt; 'my_localtime' ] =&gt; ['time_t*'] =&gt; 'tm'     );
        $ffi-&gt;attach( [ time      =&gt; 'my_time'      ] =&gt; ['tm']      =&gt; 'time_t' );

        # ===============================================
        # get the tm struct from the C localtime function
        # note that we pass in a reference to the value that time
        # returns because localtime takes a pointer to time_t
        # for some reason.
        my $time_hashref = $c-&gt;unpack( tm =&gt; my_localtime(\time) );

        # tm_zone comes back from Convert::Binary::C as an opaque,
        # cast it into a string.  We localize it to just this do
        # block so that it will be a pointer when we pass it back
        # to C land below.
        do {
          local $time_hashref-&gt;{tm_zone} = $ffi-&gt;cast(opaque =&gt; string =&gt; $time_hashref-&gt;{tm_zone});
          print Dumper($time_hashref);
        };

        # ===============================================
        # convert the tm struct back into an epoch value
        my $time = my_time( $c-&gt;pack( tm =&gt; $time_hashref ) );

        print "time      = $time\n";
        print "perl time = ", time, "\n";

       You  can also link a record type to a class.  It will then be accepted when blessed into that class as an
       argument passed into a C function, and when it is returned from a C function it will be blessed into that
       class.  Basically:

        $ffi-&gt;type( 'record(My::Class)*' =&gt; 'my_class' );
        $ffi-&gt;attach( my_function1 =&gt; [ 'my_class' ] =&gt; 'void' );
        $ffi-&gt;attach( my_function2 =&gt; [ ] =&gt; 'my_class' );

       The only thing that your class MUST provide is either a  "ffi_record_size"  or  "_ffi_record_size"  class
       method that returns the size of the record in bytes.

       Contrast  a record type which is stored as a scalar string of bytes in Perl to an opaque pointer which is
       stored as an integer in Perl.  Both are treated as pointers in C  functions.   The  situations  when  you
       usually  want  to  use  a record are when you know ahead of time what the size of the object that you are
       working with and probably something about its structure.  Because a function  that  returns  a  structure
       copies the structure into a Perl data structure, you want to make sure that it is okay to copy the record
       objects that you are dealing with if any of your functions will be returning one of them.

       Opaque  pointers should be used when you do not know the size of the object that you are using, or if the
       objects are created and free'd through an API interface other than "malloc" and "free".

       The examples in this section actually use pointers  to  records  (note  the  trailing  star  "*"  in  the
       declarations).   Most  programming languages allow you to pass or return a record as either pass-by-value
       or as a pointer (pass-by-reference).

       C code:

        struct { int a; } foo_t;
        void pass_by_value_example( struct foo_t foo );
        void pass_by_reference_example( struct foo_t *foo );

       Perl code:

        {
          package Foo;
          use FFI::Platypus::Record;
          record_layout_1( int =&gt; 'a' );
        }
        $ffi-&gt;type( 'Record(Foo)' =&gt; 'foo_t' );
        $ffi-&gt;attach( pass_by_value_example =&gt; [ 'foo_t' ] =&gt; 'void' );
        $ffi-&gt;attach( pass_by_reference_example =&gt; [ 'foo_t*' ] =&gt; 'void' );

       As with strings, functions that return a pointer to a record are actually copied.

       C code:

        struct foo_t *return_struct_pointer_example();

       Perl code:

        $ffi-&gt;attach( return_struct_pointer_example =&gt; [] =&gt; 'foo_t*' );
        my $foo = return_struct_pointer_example();
        # $foo is a copy of the record returned by the function.

       As with strings, if the API expects you to free the record it returns (it is misbehaving  a  little,  but
       lets set that aside), then you can work around this by returning an "opaque" type, casting to the record,
       and finally freeing the original pointer.

        use FFI::Platypus::Memory qw( free );
        $ffi-&gt;attach( return_struct_pointer_example =&gt; [] =&gt; 'opaque' );
        my $foo_ptr = return_struct_pointer_example();
        my $foo = $ffi-&gt;cast( 'opaque' =&gt; 'foo_t*', $foo_ptr );
        free $foo_ptr;

       You can pass records into a closure, but care needs to be taken.  Records passed into a closure are read-
       only  inside  the  closure, including "string rw" members.  Although you can pass a "pointer" to a record
       into a closure, because of limitations of the implementation you actually have a  copy,  so  all  records
       passed into closures are passed by-value.

       Note  that  a  record  that  does  not  have a class (classless) and is defined instead using a length is
       internally identical to fixed strings.  That is to say <a href="../man10/string.10.html">string</a>(10) and "<a href="../man10/record.10.html">record</a>(10)*" are identical.

   <b>Fixed</b> <b>length</b> <b>arrays</b>
       Fixed length arrays of native types and strings are supported by FFI::Platypus.  Like  pointers,  if  the
       values  contained  in  the  array  are  updated by the C function these changes will be reflected when it
       returns to Perl space.  An example of using this is the Unix "pipe" command which returns a list  of  two
       file descriptors as an array.

        use FFI::Platypus 2.00;

        my $ffi = FFI::Platypus-&gt;new( api =&gt; 2 );
        $ffi-&gt;lib(undef);
        $ffi-&gt;attach([pipe=&gt;'mypipe'] =&gt; ['int[2]'] =&gt; 'int');

        my @fd = (0,0);
        mypipe(\@fd);
        my($fd1,$fd2) = @fd;

        print "$fd1 $fd2\n";

       Because  of the way records are implemented, an array of records does not make sense and is not currently
       supported.

   <b>Variable</b> <b>length</b> <b>arrays</b>
       [version 0.22]

       Variable length arrays are supported for argument types can also be specified by using the "[]"  notation
       but by leaving the size empty:

        $ffi-&gt;type('int[]' =&gt; 'var_int_array');

       When used as an argument type it will probe the array reference that you pass in to determine the correct
       size.   Usually  you will need to communicate the size of the array to the C code.  One way to do this is
       to pass the length of the array in as an additional argument.  For example the C code:

        int
        sum(int *array, int size)
        {
          int total, i;
          for (i = 0, total = 0; i &lt; size; i++)
          {
            total += array[i];
          }
          return total;
        }

       Can be called from Perl like this:

        use FFI::Platypus 2.00;

        my $ffi = FFI::Platypus-&gt;new( api =&gt; 2 );
        $ffi-&gt;lib('./var_array.so');

        $ffi-&gt;attach( sum =&gt; [ 'int[]', 'int' ] =&gt; 'int' );

        my @list = (1..100);

        print sum(\@list, scalar @list), "\n";

       Another method might be to have a special value, such as 0 or NULL indicate the termination of the array.

       Because of the way records are implemented, an array of records does not make sense and is not  currently
       supported.

   <b>Closures</b>
       A  closure (sometimes called a "callback", we use the "libffi" terminology) is a Perl subroutine that can
       be called from C.  In order to be called from C it needs to be passed to a C  function.   To  define  the
       closure type you need to provide a list of argument types and a return type.  Currently only native types
       (integers,  floating  point  values,  opaque), strings and records (by-value; you can pass a pointer to a
       record, but due to limitations of the record implementation this is actually a  copy)  are  supported  as
       closure  argument  types,  and  only native types and records (by-value; pointer records and records with
       string pointers cannot be returned from a closure) are supported as closure  return  types.   Inside  the
       closure any records passed in are read-only.

       We  plan  to  add  other  types,  though they can be converted using the Platypus "cast" or "attach_cast"
       methods.

       Here is an example, with C code:

        /*
         * closure.c - on Linux compile with: gcc closure.c -shared -o closure.so -fPIC
         */

        #include &lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/stdio.h">stdio.h</a>&gt;

        typedef int (*closure_t)(int);
        closure_t my_closure = NULL;

        void set_closure(closure_t value)
        {
          my_closure = value;
        }

        int call_closure(int value)
        {
          if(my_closure != NULL)
            return my_closure(value);
          else
            fprintf(stderr, "closure is NULL\n");
        }

       And the Perl code:

        use FFI::Platypus 2.00;

        my $ffi = FFI::Platypus-&gt;new( api =&gt; 2 );
        $ffi-&gt;lib('./closure.so');
        $ffi-&gt;type('(int)-&gt;int' =&gt; 'closure_t');

        $ffi-&gt;attach(set_closure =&gt; ['closure_t'] =&gt; 'void');
        $ffi-&gt;attach(call_closure =&gt; ['int'] =&gt; 'int');

        my $closure1 = $ffi-&gt;closure(sub { $_[0] * 2 });
        set_closure($closure1);
        print  <a href="../man2/call_closure.2.html">call_closure</a>(2), "\n"; # prints "4"

        my $closure2 = $ffi-&gt;closure(sub { $_[0] * 4 });
        set_closure($closure2);
        print <a href="../man2/call_closure.2.html">call_closure</a>(2), "\n"; # prints "8"

       If you have a pointer to a function in the form of an "opaque" type, you can pass  this  in  place  of  a
       closure type:

        use FFI::Platypus 2.00;

        my $ffi = FFI::Platypus-&gt;new( api =&gt; 2 );
        $ffi-&gt;lib('./closure.so');
        $ffi-&gt;type('(int)-&gt;int' =&gt; 'closure_t');

        $ffi-&gt;attach(set_closure =&gt; ['closure_t'] =&gt; 'void');
        $ffi-&gt;attach(call_closure =&gt; ['int'] =&gt; 'int');

        my $closure = $ffi-&gt;closure(sub { $_[0] * 6 });
        my $opaque = $ffi-&gt;cast(closure_t =&gt; 'opaque', $closure);
        set_closure($opaque);
        print <a href="../man2/call_closure.2.html">call_closure</a>(2), "\n"; # prints "12"

       The syntax for specifying a closure type is a list of comma separated types in parentheticals followed by
       a  narrow  arrow  "-&gt;",  followed by the return type for the closure.  For example a closure that takes a
       pointer, an integer and a string and returns an integer would look like this:

        $ffi-&gt;type('(opaque, int, string) -&gt; int' =&gt; 'my_closure_type');

       Care needs to be taken with scoping and closures, because of the way Perl and C handle responsibility for
       allocating memory differently.  Perl keeps reference counts and frees objects when nothing is referencing
       them.  In C the code that allocates the memory is considered  responsible  for  explicitly  free'ing  the
       memory  for  objects  it  has  created  when they are no longer needed.  When you pass a closure into a C
       function, the C code has a pointer or reference to that object, but it has no way up  letting  Perl  know
       when it is no longer using it. As a result, if you do not keep a reference to your closure around it will
       be  free'd  by  Perl  and  if  the  C code ever tries to call the closure it will probably SIGSEGV.  Thus
       supposing you have a C function "set_closure" that takes a Perl closure, this is almost always wrong:

        set_closure($ffi-&gt;closure({ $_[0] * 2 }));  # BAD

       In some cases, you may want to create a closure shouldn't ever be free'd.  For example you are passing  a
       closure  into  a  C  function  that will retain it for the lifetime of your application.  You can use the
       sticky method to keep the closure, without the need to keep a reference of the closure:

        {
          my $closure = $ffi-&gt;closure(sub { $_[0] * 2 });
          $closure-&gt;sticky;
          set_closure($closure); # OKAY
        }
        # closure still exists and is accesible from C, but
        # not from Perl land.

   <b>Custom</b> <b>Types</b>
       <u>Custom</u> <u>Types</u> <u>in</u> <u>Perl</u>

       Platypus custom types are the rough analogue to typemaps in the  XS  world.   They  offer  a  method  for
       converting Perl types into native types that the "libffi" can understand and pass on to the C code.

       Example 1: Integer constants

       Say you have a C header file like this:

        /* possible foo types: */
        #define FOO_STATIC  1
        #define FOO_DYNAMIC 2
        #define FOO_OTHER   3

        typedef int foo_t;

        void foo(foo_t foo);
        foo_t get_foo();

       The  challenge  is  here that once the source is processed by the C pre-processor the name/value mappings
       for these "FOO_" constants are lost.  There is no way to fetch them from the library once it is  compiled
       and linked.

       One  common  way  of  implementing this would be to create and export constants in your Perl module, like
       this:

        package Foo;

        use FFI::Platypus 2.00;
        use Exporter qw( import );

        our @EXPORT_OK = qw( FOO_STATIC FOO_DYNAMIC FOO_OTHER foo get_foo );

        use constant FOO_STATIC  =&gt; 1;
        use constant FOO_DYNAMIC =&gt; 2;
        use constant FOO_OTHER   =&gt; 3;

        my $ffi = FFI::Platypus-&gt;new( api =&gt; 2 );
        $ffi-&gt;attach(foo     =&gt; ['int'] =&gt; 'void');
        $ffi-&gt;attach(get_foo =&gt; []      =&gt; 'int');

       Then you could use the module thus:

        use Foo qw( foo FOO_STATIC );
        foo(FOO_STATIC);

       If you didn't want to rely on integer constants or exports, you could also  define  a  custom  type,  and
       allow strings to be passed into your function, like this:

        package Foo;

        use FFI::Platypus 2.00;

        our @EXPORT_OK = qw( foo get_foo );

        my %foo_types = (
          static  =&gt; 1,
          dynamic =&gt; 2,
          other   =&gt; 3,
        );
        my %foo_types_reverse = reverse %foo_types;

        my $ffi = FFI::Platypus-&gt;new( api =&gt; 2 );
        $ffi-&gt;custom_type(foo_t =&gt; {
          native_type    =&gt; 'int',
          native_to_perl =&gt; sub {
            $foo_types{$_[0]};
          },
          perl_to_native =&gt; sub {
            $foo_types_reverse{$_[0]};
          },
        });

        $ffi-&gt;attach(foo     =&gt; ['foo_t'] =&gt; 'void');
        $ffi-&gt;attach(get_foo =&gt; []        =&gt; 'foo_t');

       Now  when  an  argument  of  type  "foo_t"  is called for it will be converted from an appropriate string
       representation, and any function that returns a "foo_t" type will return a string instead of the  integer
       representation:

        use Foo;
        foo('static');

       If  the  library  that you are using has a lot of these constants you can try using Convert::Binary::C or
       another C header parser to obtain the appropriate name/value pairings for the constants that you need.

       Example 2: Blessed references

       Supposing you have a C library that uses an opaque pointer with a pseudo OO interface, like this:

        typedef struct foo_t;

        foo_t *foo_new();
        void foo_method(foo_t *, int argument);
        void foo_free(foo_t *);

       One approach to adapting this to Perl would be to create a OO Perl interface like this:

        package Foo;

        use FFI::Platypus 2.00;
        use FFI::Platypus::API qw( arguments_get_string );

        my $ffi = FFI::Platypus-&gt;new( api =&gt; 2 );
        $ffi-&gt;custom_type(foo_t =&gt; {
          native_type    =&gt; 'opaque',
          native_to_perl =&gt; sub {
            my $class = <a href="../man0/arguments_get_string.0.html">arguments_get_string</a>(0);
            bless \$_[0], $class;
          }
          perl_to_native =&gt; sub { ${$_[0]} },
        });

        $ffi-&gt;attach([ foo_new =&gt; 'new' ] =&gt; [ 'string' ] =&gt; 'foo_t' );
        $ffi-&gt;attach([ foo_method =&gt; 'method' ] =&gt; [ 'foo_t', 'int' ] =&gt; 'void');
        $ffi-&gt;attach([ foo_free =&gt; 'DESTROY' ] =&gt; [ 'foo_t' ] =&gt; 'void');

        my $foo = Foo-&gt;new;

       Here we are blessing a reference to the opaque pointer when we return the custom type  for  "foo_t",  and
       dereferencing  that reference before we pass it back in.  The function "arguments_get_string" queries the
       C arguments to get the class name to make sure the object is blessed into the  correct  class  (for  more
       details  on  the custom type API see FFI::Platypus::API), so you can inherit and extend this class like a
       normal Perl class.  This works because the C "constructor" ignores the class name that we pass in as  the
       first  argument.   If  you  have  a  C "constructor" like this that takes arguments you'd have to write a
       wrapper for new.

       A good example of a C library that uses this pattern, including  inheritance  is  "libarchive".  Platypus
       comes with a more extensive example in "examples/archive.pl" that demonstrates this.

       Example 3: Pointers with pack / unpack

       TODO

       See example FFI::Platypus::Type::StringPointer.

       Example 4: Custom Type modules and the Custom Type API

       TODO

       See example FFI::Platypus::Type::PointerSizeBuffer.

       Example 5: Custom Type on CPAN

       You can distribute your own Platypus custom types on CPAN, if you think they may be applicable to others.
       The  default  namespace  is  prefix with "FFI::Platypus::Type::", though you can stick it anywhere (under
       your own namespace may make more sense if the custom type is specific to your application).

       A good example and pattern to follow is FFI::Platypus::Type::StringArray.
