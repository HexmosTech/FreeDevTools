</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       JE::LValue - JavaScript lvalue class

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use JE::LValue;

         $lv = new JE::LValue $some_obj, 'property_name';

         $lv-&gt;get;         # get property
         $lv-&gt;set($value)  # set property

         $lv-&gt;some_other_method  # same as $lv-&gt;get-&gt;some_other_method

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This class implements JavaScript lvalues (called "Reference Types" by the ECMAScript specification).

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>OVERLOADING</b></h4><pre>
       If a method is called that is not listed here, it will be passed to the property referenced by the
       lvalue. (See the last item in the SYNOPSIS, above.) For this reason, you should never call
       "UNIVERSAL::can" on a JE::LValue, but, rather, call it as a method ("$lv-&gt;can(...)"), unless you really
       know what you are doing.

       Similarly, if you try to use an overloaded operator, it will be passed on to the object that the lvalue
       references, such that "!$lvalue" is the same as calling "!$lvalue-&gt;get".

       $lv = new JE::LValue $obj, $property
           Creates  an lvalue/reference with $obj as the base object and $property as the property name. If $obj
           is undefined or null, a TypeError is thrown.  To create a lvalue that has no base object,  and  which
           will  throw  a  ReferenceError when "-&gt;get" is called and create a global property upon invocation of
           "-&gt;set", pass an unblessed reference to a global object as the first argument. (This is used by  bare
           identifiers in JS expressions.)

       $lv-&gt;get
           Gets the value of the property.

       $lv-&gt;set($value)
           Sets  the  property to $value and returns $value. If the lvalue has no base object, the global object
           will become its base object automatically.  &lt;Note:&gt; Whether the lvalue object itself is  modified  in
           the latter case is not set in stone yet. (Currently it is modified, but that may change.)

       $lv-&gt;call(@args)
           If the property is a function, this calls the function with the base object as the 'this' value.

       $lv-&gt;base
           Returns the base object. If there isn't any, it returns undef or an empty list, depending on context.

       $lv-&gt;property
           Returns the property name.
