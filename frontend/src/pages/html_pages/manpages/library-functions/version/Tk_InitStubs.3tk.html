       Tk_InitStubs - initialize the Tk stubs mechanism

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;tk.h&gt;</b>

       const char *
       <b>Tk_InitStubs</b>(<u>interp,</u> <u>version,</u> <u>exact</u>)

</pre><h4><b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Tcl_Interp <u>*interp</u> (in)          Tcl interpreter handle.

       char <u>*version</u> (in)               A  version string consisting of one or more decimal numbers separated by
                                        dots.

       int <u>exact</u> (in)                   Non-zero means that only the particular Tk version specified by  <u>version</u>
                                        is  acceptable.   Zero  means  that versions newer than <u>version</u> are also
                                        acceptable as long as  they  have  the  same  major  version  number  as
                                        <u>version</u>.

</pre><h4><b>INTRODUCTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  Tcl  stubs mechanism defines a way to dynamically bind extensions to a particular Tcl implementation
       at run time.  the stubs mechanism requires no changes to applications incorporating Tcl/Tk  interpreters.
       Only  developers  creating  C-based  Tcl/Tk extensions need to take steps to use the stubs mechanism with
       their extensions.  See the <b>Tcl_InitStubs</b> page for more information.

       Enabling the stubs mechanism for a Tcl/Tk extension requires the following steps:

       1)   Call <b>Tcl_InitStubs</b> in the extension before calling any other Tcl functions.

       2)   Call <b>Tk_InitStubs</b> if the extension before calling any other Tk functions.

       2)   Define  the  <b>USE_TCL_STUBS</b>  and  the  <b>USE_TK_STUBS</b>  symbols.  Typically,  you  would   include   the
            <b>-DUSE_TCL_STUBS</b> and the <b>-DUSE_TK_STUBS</b> flags when compiling the extension.

       3)   Link the extension with the Tcl and Tk stubs libraries instead of the standard Tcl and Tk libraries.
            On  Unix  platforms, the library names are <u>libtclstub8.4.a</u> and <u>libtkstub8.4.a</u>; on Windows platforms,
            the library names are <u>tclstub84.lib</u> and <u>tkstub84.lib</u>. Adjust  the  library  names  with  appropriate
            version  number  but note that the extension may only be used with versions of Tcl/Tk that have that
            version number or higher.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Tk_InitStubs</b> attempts to initialize the Tk stub table pointers and ensure that the correct version of  Tk
       is  loaded.  In addition to an interpreter handle, it accepts as arguments a version number and a Boolean
       flag indicating whether the extension requires an exact version match or not.  If <u>exact</u> is  0,  then  the
       extension  is  indicating  that  newer  versions of Tk are acceptable as long as they have the same major
       version number as <u>version</u>; non-zero means that only the specified <u>version</u> is  acceptable.   <b>Tcl_InitStubs</b>
       returns a string containing the actual version of Tk satisfying the request, or NULL if the Tk version is
       not acceptable, does not support the stubs mechanism, or any other error condition occurred.
