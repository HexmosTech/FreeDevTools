       SemVer - Use semantic version numbers

</pre><h4><b>Synopsis</b></h4><pre>
         use SemVer; our $VERSION = SemVer-&gt;new('1.2.0-b1');

</pre><h4><b>Description</b></h4><pre>
       This module subclasses version to create semantic versions, as defined by the Semantic Versioning 2.0.0
       Specification &lt;https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html&gt;.  The three salient points of the specification, for
       the purposes of version formatting, are:

       1.  A  normal  version  number  MUST take the form X.Y.Z where X, Y, and Z are non-negative integers, and
           MUST NOT contain leading zeroes. X is the major version, Y is the minor version, and Z is  the  patch
           version. Each element MUST increase numerically.  For instance: "1.9.0 -&gt; 1.10.0 -&gt; 1.11.0".

       2.  A  pre-release version MAY be denoted by appending a hyphen and a series of dot separated identifiers
           immediately following the patch version. Identifiers  MUST  comprise  only  ASCII  alphanumerics  and
           hyphen  "[0-9A-Za-z-]".  Identifiers  MUST NOT be empty. Numeric identifiers MUST NOT include leading
           zeroes. Pre-release versions have a lower precedence than  the  associated  normal  version.  A  pre-
           release  version  indicates  that  the  version  is  unstable  and  might  not  satisfy  the intended
           compatibility requirements as denoted by its associated normal version: "1.0.0-alpha,  1.0.0-alpha.1,
           1.0.0-0.3.7, 1.0.0-x.7.z.92"

       3.  Build  metadata  MAY  be  denoted  by appending a plus sign and a series of dot separated identifiers
           immediately following the  patch  or  pre-release  version.  Identifiers  MUST  comprise  only  ASCII
           alphanumerics  and  hyphen  "[0-9A-Za-z-]".  Identifiers  MUST NOT be empty. Build metadata SHOULD be
           ignored when determining version precedence.  Thus  two  versions  that  differ  only  in  the  build
           metadata,    have   the   same   precedence.    Examples:   "1.0.0-alpha+001,   1.0.0+20130313144700,
           1.0.0-beta+exp.sha.5114f85".

   <b>Usage</b>
       For strict parsing of semantic version numbers, use the "new()" constructor.  If you need something  more
       flexible,  use  "declare()".  And  if  you  need something more comparable with what version expects, try
       "parse()".  Compare how these constructors deal with  various  version  strings  (with  values  shown  as
       returned by "normal()":

           Argument  | new      | declare     | parse
        -------------+----------+---------------------------
         '1.0.0'     | 1.0.0    | 1.0.0       | 1.0.0
         '5.5.2-b1'  | 5.5.2-b1 | 5.5.2-b1    | 5.5.2-b1
         '1.05.0'    | &lt;error&gt;  | 1.5.0       | 1.5.0
         '1.0'       | &lt;error&gt;  | 1.0.0       | 1.0.0
         '  012.2.2' | &lt;error&gt;  | 12.2.2      | 12.2.2
         '1.1'       | &lt;error&gt;  | 1.1.0       | 1.100.0
          1.1        | &lt;error&gt;  | 1.1.0       | 1.100.0
         '1.1.0+b1'  | 1.1.0+b1 | 1.1.0+b1    | 1.1.0+b1
         '1.1-b1'    | &lt;error&gt;  | 1.1.0-b1    | 1.100.0-b1
         '1.2.b1'    | &lt;error&gt;  | 1.2.0-b1    | 1.2.0-b1
         '9.0-beta4' | &lt;error&gt;  | 9.0.0-beta4 | 9.0.0-beta4
         '9'         | &lt;error&gt;  | 9.0.0       | 9.0.0
         '1-b'       | &lt;error&gt;  | 1.0.0-b     | 1.0.0-b
          0          | &lt;error&gt;  | 0.0.0       | 0.0.0
         '0-rc1'     | &lt;error&gt;  | 0.0.0-rc1   | 0.0.0-rc1
         '1.02_30'   | &lt;error&gt;  | 1.23.0      | 1.23.0
          1.02_30    | &lt;error&gt;  | 1.23.0      | 1.23.0

       Note  that,  unlike  in  version,  the "declare" and "parse" methods ignore underscores. That is, version
       strings with underscores are treated as decimal numbers. Hence, the last two examples yield  exactly  the
       same semantic versions.

       As with version objects, the comparison and stringification operators are all overloaded, so that you can
       compare semantic versions. You can also compare semantic versions with version objects (but not the other
       way  around,  alas). Boolean operators are also overloaded, such that all semantic version objects except
       for those consisting only of zeros (ignoring prerelease and metadata) are considered true.

</pre><h4><b>Interface</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Constructors</b>
       <u>"new"</u>

         my $semver = SemVer-&gt;new('1.2.2');

       Performs a validating parse of the version string and returns a  new  semantic  version  object.  If  the
       version  string  does  not  adhere to the semantic version specification an exception will be thrown. See
       "declare" and "parse" for more forgiving constructors.

       <u>"declare"</u>

         my $semver = SemVer-&gt;declare('1.2'); # 1.2.0

       This parser strips out any underscores from the version string and passes it to to "version"'s  "declare"
       constructor,  which  always  creates  dotted-integer  version  objects.  This is the most flexible way to
       declare versions. Consider using it to normalize version strings.

       <u>"parse"</u>

         my $semver = SemVer-&gt;parse('1.2'); # 1.200.0

       This parser dispatches to "version"'s "parse" constructor, which tries to be  more  flexible  in  how  it
       converts  simple decimal strings and numbers. Not really recommended, since it's treatment of decimals is
       quite different from the dotted-integer format  of  semantic  version  strings,  and  thus  can  lead  to
       inconsistencies. Included only for proper compatibility with version.

   <b>Instance</b> <b>Methods</b>
       <u>"normal"</u>

         SemVer-&gt;declare('v1.2')-&gt;normal;       # 1.2.0
         SemVer-&gt;parse('1.2')-&gt;normal;          # 1.200.0
         SemVer-&gt;declare('1.02.0-b1')-&gt;normal;  # 1.2.0-b1
         SemVer-&gt;parse('1.02_30')-&gt;normal       # 1.230.0
         SemVer-&gt;parse(1.02_30)-&gt;normal         # 1.23.0

       Returns  a  normalized  representation of the version string. This string will always be a strictly-valid
       dotted-integer semantic version string suitable for passing to "new()". Unlike version's "normal" method,
       there will be no leading "v".

       <u>"stringify"</u>

         SemVer-&gt;declare('v1.2')-&gt;stringify;    # v1.2
         SemVer-&gt;parse('1.200')-&gt;stringify;     # v1.200
         SemVer-&gt;declare('1.2-r1')-&gt;stringify;  # v1.2-r1
         SemVer-&gt;parse(1.02_30)-&gt;stringify;     # v1.0230
         SemVer-&gt;parse(1.02_30)-&gt;stringify;     # v1.023

       Returns a string that is  as  close  to  the  original  representation  as  possible.   If  the  original
       representation  was  a numeric literal, it will be returned the way perl would normally represent it in a
       string. This method is used whenever a version object is interpolated into a string.

       <u>"numify"</u>

       Throws an exception. Semantic versions cannot be numified. Just don't go there.

       <u>"is_alpha"</u>

         my $is_alpha = $semver-&gt;is_alpha;

       Returns true if a prerelease and/or metadata string is appended to the end of the  version  string.  This
       also  means  that  the  version  number  is a "special version", in the semantic versioning specification
       meaning of the phrase.

       <u>"vbool"</u>

         say "Version $semver" if $semver;
         say "Not a $semver" if !$semver;

       Returns true for a non-zero semantic semantic version object, without regard to the prerelease  or  build
       metadata parts. Overloads boolean operations.

       <u>"vcmp"</u>

       Compares  the  semantic  version  object to another version object or string and returns 0 if they're the
       same, -1 if the invocant is smaller than the argument,  and  1  if  the  invocant  is  greater  than  the
       argument.

       Mostly you don't need to worry about this: Just use the comparison operators instead:

         if ($semver &lt; $another_semver) {
             die "Need $another_semver or higher";
         }

       Note  that  in addition to comparing other semantic version objects, you can also compare regular version
       objects:

         if ($semver &lt; $version) {
             die "Need $version or higher";
         }

       You can also pass in a version string. It will be turned into a semantic version object using  "declare".
       So if you're using numeric versions, you may or may not get what you want:

         my $semver  = version::Semver-&gt;new('1.2.0');
         my $version = '1.2';
         my $bool    = $semver == $version; # true

       If that's not what you want, pass the string to "parse" first:

         my $semver  = Semver-&gt;new('1.2.0');
         my $version = Semver-&gt;parse('1.2'); # 1.200.0
         my $bool    = $semver == $version; # false
