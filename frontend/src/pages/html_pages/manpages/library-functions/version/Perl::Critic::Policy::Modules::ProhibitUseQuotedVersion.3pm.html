       Perl::Critic::Policy::Modules::ProhibitUseQuotedVersion - avoid quoted version number string in a "use"
       statement

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This policy is part of the "Perl::Critic::Pulp" add-on.  It asks you not to quote a version number string
       as the sole argument to a "use" or "no" statement.

           use Foo::Bar '1.50';      # bad
           use Foo::Bar 1.50;        # ok

           no Abc::Def '2.000_010';  # bad
           no Abc::Def 2.000_010;    # ok

       The unquoted form uses Perl's builtin module version check (Perl 5.004 up) and is always enforced.  The
       quoted form is passed to the module's "import()" and relies on it to do the check.  If there's no
       "import()" then the quoted form is silently ignored.

       "Exporter" as used by many modules provides an "import()" which checks a version number arg, so those
       modules are fine.  But the idea of this policy is to do what works always and on that basis is under the
       "bugs" theme (see "POLICY THEMES" in Perl::Critic).

       The builtin module version check is new in Perl 5.004.  For earlier versions both forms behave the same,
       with the string or number going through to the module "import" and so may or may not be checked.  But
       even in code supporting older Perl it's good to write the unquoted number so later Perl will be certain
       to enforce it.

       The policy only applies to a single number string argument, anything else is taken to be a module
       parameters.

           no Abc::Def '123', 'ABC';   # ok
           use lib '..';               # ok

       If you're a bit nervous about unquoting because floating point version numbers are often not exactly
       representable in binary, well, yes, that's true, but in practice it works, either by converting the same
       way everywhere in the program or by treated as a string to the "version.pm" module anyway.

   <b>Disabling</b>
       If you're confident about the "import()" in modules you use and prefer the string form you can always
       disable "ProhibitUseQuotedVersion" from your <u>.perlcriticrc</u> in the usual way (see "CONFIGURATION" in
       Perl::Critic),
