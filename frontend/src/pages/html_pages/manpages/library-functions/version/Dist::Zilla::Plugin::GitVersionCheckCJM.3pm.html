       Dist::Zilla::Plugin::GitVersionCheckCJM - Ensure version numbers are up-to-date

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This document describes version 4.27 of Dist::Zilla::Plugin::GitVersionCheckCJM, released December 17,
       2017 as part of Dist-Zilla-Plugins-CJM version 6.000.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       In your <u>dist.ini</u>:

         [GitVersionCheckCJM]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This plugin makes sure that module version numbers are updated as necessary.  In a distribution with
       multiple module, I like to update a module's version only when a change is made to that module.  In other
       words, a module's version is the version of the last distribution release in which it was modified.

       This plugin checks each module in the distribution, and makes sure that it matches one of two conditions:

       1.  There is a tag matching the version, and the last commit on that module is included in that tag.

       2.  The  version  matches the distribution's version, and that version has not been tagged yet (i.e., the
           distribution has not been released).

       If neither condition holds, it prints an error message.  After checking all modules, it aborts the  build
       if any module had an error.

</pre><h4><b>ATTRIBUTES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>finder</b>
       This  FileFinder  provides  the  list of modules that will be checked.  The default is ":InstallModules".
       The "finder" attribute may be listed any number of times.

   <b>single_version</b>
       If set to a true value, all modules in the  distribution  must  have  the  distribution's  version.   The
       default  is false, which allows unchanged modules to retain the version of the distribution in which they
       were last changed.

</pre><h4><b>DEPENDENCIES</b></h4><pre>
       GitVersionCheckCJM requires Dist::Zilla (6 or later).  It also requires Git::Wrapper, although it is only
       listed as a recommended dependency for the distribution (to allow people who don't use  Git  to  use  the
       other plugins.)

</pre><h4><b>INCOMPATIBILITIES</b></h4><pre>
       None reported.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       No bugs have been reported.
