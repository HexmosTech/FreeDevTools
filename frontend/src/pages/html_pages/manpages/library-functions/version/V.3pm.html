</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       V - Print version of the specified module(s).

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           $ perl -MV=V

       or if you want more than one

           $ perl -MV=CPAN,V

       Can now also be used as a light-weight module for getting versions of modules without loading them:

           require V;
           printf "%s has version '%s'\n", "V", V::get_version ("V");

       Starting with version <b>0.17</b>, V will show all "package"s or "class"es in a file that have a version. If one
       wants to see all packages/classes from that file, set the environment variable "PERL_V_SHOW_ALL" to a
       <u>true</u> value.

       If you want all available files/versions from @INC:

           require V;
           my @all_V = V::Module::Info-&gt;all_installed ("V");
           printf "%s:\n", $all_V[0]-&gt;name;
           for my $file (@all_V) {
               my ($versions) = $file-&gt;version; # Must be list context
               if (@$versions &gt; 1) {
                   say "\t", $file-&gt;name;
                   print "\t    %-30s: %s\n", $_-&gt;{pkg}, $_-&gt;{version} for @versions;
                   }
               else {
                   printf "\t%-50s - %s\n", $file-&gt;file, $versions-&gt;[0]{version};
                   }
               }

       Each element in that array isa "V::Module::Info" object with 3 attributes and a method:

       <u>attribute</u> <b>name</b>
           The package name.

       <u>attribute</u> <b>file</b>
           Full filename with directory.

       <u>attribute</u> <b>dir</b>
           The base directory (from @INC) where the package-file was found.

       <u>method</u> <b>version</b>
           This  method  will  look  through the file to see if it can find a version assignment in the file and
           uses that to determine the version. As of version <b>0.13_01</b>, all versions found are passed through  the
           version module.

           As of version <b>0.16_03</b> we look for all types of version declaration:

               package Foo;
               our $VERSION = 0.42;

           and

               package Foo 0.42;

           and

               package Foo 0.42 { ... }

           Not  only  do  we  look for the "package" keyword, but also for "class".  In list context this method
           will return an arrayref to a list of structures:

           <u>pkg</u>     The name of the "package"/"class".

           <u>version</u> The version for that "package"/"class". (Can be absent if $PERL_V_SHOW_ALL is true.)

           <u>ord</u>     The ordinal number of occurrence in the file.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module uses stolen code from Module::Info  to  find  the  location  and  version  of  the  specified
       module(s). It prints them and <b>exit()</b>s.

       It  defines  "import  ()" and is based on an idea from Michael Schwern on the perl5-porters list. See the
       discussion:

         https://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2002/01/msg51007.html

   <b>V::get_version($pkg)</b>
       Returns the version of the first available file for this package as found by following @INC.

       <u>Arguments</u>

       1. $pkg
           The name of the package for which one wants to know the version.

       <u>Response</u>

       This "V::get_version ()" returns the version of the file  that  was  first  found  for  this  package  by
       following @INC or "undef" if no file was found.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       There  are  numerous  module  on CPAN that (try to) extract the VERSION from modules. ExtUtils::MakeMaker
       maybe being th most important inspiration. Module::Info was used to copy code from.
