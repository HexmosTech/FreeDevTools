</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       nbd_get_version - return the version of the library

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        #include &lt;libnbd.h&gt;

        const char * nbd_get_version (
                       struct nbd_handle *h
                     );

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Return the version of libnbd.  This is returned as a string in the form "major.minor.release" where each
       of major, minor and release is a small positive integer.  For example:

            minor
              ↓
           "1.0.3"
            ↑   ↑
        major   release

       major = 0
           The  major  number was 0 for the early experimental versions of libnbd where we still had an unstable
           API.

       major = 1
           The major number is 1 for the versions of libnbd with a long-term stable API  and  ABI.   It  is  not
           anticipated that major will be any number other than 1.

       minor = 0, 2, ... (even)
           The minor number is even for stable releases.

       minor = 1, 3, ... (odd)
           The  minor number is odd for development versions.  Note that new APIs added in a development version
           remain experimental and subject to change in that branch until they appear in a stable release.

       release
           The release number is incremented for each release along a particular branch.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       This call returns a statically allocated string, valid for the lifetime of the process or until libnbd is
       unloaded by <b><a href="../man3/dlclose.3.html">dlclose</a></b>(3).  You <b>must</b> <b>not</b> try to free the string.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       This function does not fail.

       The following parameters must not be NULL: "h".   For  more  information  see  "Non-NULL  parameters"  in
       <b><a href="../man3/libnbd.3.html">libnbd</a></b>(3).

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This function first appeared in libnbd 1.0.

       If  you  need  to  test  if  this  function  is available at compile time check if the following macro is
       defined:

        #define LIBNBD_HAVE_NBD_GET_VERSION 1
