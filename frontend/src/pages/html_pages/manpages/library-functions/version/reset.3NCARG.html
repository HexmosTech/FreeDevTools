</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       RESET - The "super" version of RESET zeroes the internal integer array used to detect crowded lines;
       other versions do nothing.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       CALL RESET

</pre><h4><b>C-BINDING</b> <b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;ncarg/ncargC.h&gt;

       void c_reset()

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       The "super" version of the Dashline utility attempts to cull crowded lines from the output picture.  It
       does this using an internal integer array, ISCREN, in which each bit used represents a single pixel in a
       square array of 1024x1024 pixels of the picture.  Initially, all the bits must be set to zero by calling
       the routine RESET.  When a line segment is about to be drawn, an appropriate set of bits in ISCREN
       (representing the pixels through which the line segment passes) is examined; if any bit in that set is a
       1, the line segment is not drawn. Then, the bits representing the pixels in the immediate vicinity of the
       line segment are set to 1, so as to prevent any subsequent line segment from being drawn through the
       area.

       As each label is drawn, the bits in ISCREN representing the area occupied by the label are set to 1, as
       well, which prevents subsequent line segments from being drawn through the label.

       This culling process has the following implications for the user of the "super" version of Dashline:

       •  The routine RESET should be called at the beginning of each new picture.  If this is not done, each of
          a  consecutive  series  of  pictures  will  have progressively more gaps where line segments have been
          culled.

       •  More important lines should be drawn first, followed  by  less  important  lines.   For  example,  the
          "super" version of the routine CONREC draws labeled contour lines first, followed by the contour lines
          halfway in between the labeled lines, followed by the rest of the lines.

       •  Because  each  line segment is either drawn in its entirety or not at all, long straight line segments
          are broken into shorter pieces.  The internal parameter MLLINE  determines  how  small  the  resulting
          pieces will be; you may wish to reduce its value so that smaller pieces will be used.

</pre><h4><b>ACCESS</b></h4><pre>
       To  use  RESET  or c_reset, load the NCAR Graphics libraries ncarg, ncarg_gks, and ncarg_c, preferably in
       that order.
