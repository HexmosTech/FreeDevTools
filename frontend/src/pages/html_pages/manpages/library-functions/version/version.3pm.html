</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Version objects were added to Perl in 5.10.  This module implements version objects for older version of
       Perl and provides the version object API for all versions of Perl.  All previous releases before 0.74 are
       deprecated and should not be used due to incompatible API changes.  Version 0.77 introduces the new
       'parse' and 'declare' methods to standardize usage.  You are strongly urged to set 0.77 as a minimum in
       your code, e.g.

         use version 0.77; # even for Perl v.5.10.0

</pre><h4><b>TYPES</b> <b>OF</b> <b>VERSION</b> <b>OBJECTS</b></h4><pre>
       There are two different types of version objects, corresponding to the two different styles of versions
       in use:

       Decimal Versions
         The  classic  floating-point number $VERSION.  The advantage to this style is that you don't need to do
         anything special, just type a number into your source file.  Quoting is recommended, as it ensures that
         trailing zeroes ("1.50") are preserved in any warnings or other output.

       Dotted Decimal Versions
         The more modern form of version assignment, with 3 (or potentially more) integers separated by  decimal
         points  (e.g.  v1.2.3).   This  is  the  form  that Perl itself has used since 5.6.0 was released.  The
         leading 'v' is now strongly recommended for clarity, and will throw a warning in a  future  release  if
         omitted.  A leading 'v' character is required to pass the "<b>is_strict()</b>" test.

</pre><h4><b>DECLARING</b> <b>VERSIONS</b></h4><pre>
       If  you have a module that uses a decimal $VERSION (floating point), and you do not intend to ever change
       that, this module is not for you.  There is nothing that version.pm gains  you  over  a  simple  $VERSION
       assignment:

         our $VERSION = "1.02";

       Since  Perl  v5.10.0  includes  the version.pm comparison logic anyways, you don't need to do anything at
       all.

   <b>How</b> <b>to</b> <b>convert</b> <b>a</b> <b>module</b> <b>from</b> <b>decimal</b> <b>to</b> <b>dotted-decimal</b>
       If you have used a decimal $VERSION in the past and wish to switch to a dotted-decimal $VERSION, then you
       need to make a one-time conversion to the new format.

       <b>Important</b> <b>Note</b>: you must ensure that your new $VERSION is numerically greater than your  current  decimal
       $VERSION; this is not always obvious. First, convert your old decimal version (e.g. 1.02) to a normalized
       dotted-decimal form:

         $ perl -Mversion -e 'print version-&gt;parse("1.02")-&gt;normal'
         v1.20.0

       Then increment any of the dotted-decimal components (v1.20.1 or v1.21.0).

   <b>How</b> <b>to</b> <b>declare()</b> <b>a</b> <b>dotted-decimal</b> <b>version</b>
         use version; our $VERSION = version-&gt;declare("v1.2.3");

       The  declare() method always creates dotted-decimal version objects.  When used in a module, you <b>must</b> put
       it on the same line as "use version" to ensure that $VERSION is read correctly  by  PAUSE  and  installer
       tools.   You  should also add 'version' to the 'configure_requires' section of your module metadata file.
       See instructions in ExtUtils::MakeMaker or Module::Build for details.

       <b>Important</b> <b>Note</b>: Even if you pass in what looks like a decimal number ("1.2"), a  dotted-decimal  will  be
       created ("v1.200.0"). To avoid confusion or unintentional errors on older Perls, follow these guidelines:

       • Always use a dotted-decimal with (at least) three components

       • Always use a leading-v

       • Always quote the version

       If  you  really  insist  on  using  version.pm  with  an ordinary decimal version, use parse() instead of
       declare.  See the "PARSING AND COMPARING VERSIONS" for details.

       See also version::Internals for more on version number conversion, quoting,  calculated  version  numbers
       and declaring developer or "alpha" version numbers.

</pre><h4><b>PARSING</b> <b>AND</b> <b>COMPARING</b> <b>VERSIONS</b></h4><pre>
       If you need to compare version numbers, but can't be sure whether they are expressed as numbers, strings,
       v-strings  or  version  objects,   then  you  should  use  version.pm  to parse them all into objects for
       comparison.

   <b>How</b> <b>to</b> <b>parse()</b> <b>a</b> <b>version</b>
       The parse() method takes in anything that might be a version and returns a corresponding version  object,
       doing any necessary conversion along the way.

       • Dotted-decimal:  bare v-strings (v1.2.3) and strings with more than one decimal point and a leading 'v'
         ("v1.2.3"); NOTE you can technically use a v-string or strings with a leading-v and  only  one  decimal
         point (v1.2 or "v1.2"), but you will confuse both yourself and others.

       • Decimal: regular decimal numbers (literal or in a string)

       Some examples:

         $variable   version-&gt;parse($variable)
         ---------   -------------------------
         1.23        v1.230.0
         "1.23"      v1.230.0
         v1.23       v1.23.0
         "v1.23"     v1.23.0
         "1.2.3"     v1.2.3
         "v1.2.3"    v1.2.3

       See version::Internals for more on version number conversion.

   <b>How</b> <b>to</b> <b>check</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>legal</b> <b>version</b> <b>string</b>
       If  you do not want to actually create a full blown version object, but would still like to verify that a
       given string meets the criteria to be parsed as a version, there are two helper  functions  that  can  be
       employed directly:

       is_lax()
           The  lax  criteria  corresponds  to  what  is  currently  allowed  by the version parser.  All of the
           following formats are acceptable for dotted-decimal formats strings:

               v1.2
               1.2345.6
               v1.23_4
               1.2345
               1.2345_01

       is_strict()
           If you want to limit yourself to a much more narrow definition of what a version string  constitutes,
           is_strict() is limited to version strings like the following list:

               v1.234.5
               2.3456

       See version::Internals for details of the regular expressions that define the legal version string forms,
       as  well  as  how  to  use those regular expressions in your own code if is_lax() and is_strict() are not
       sufficient for your needs.

   <b>How</b> <b>to</b> <b>compare</b> <b>version</b> <b>objects</b>
       Version objects overload the "cmp" and "&lt;=&gt;" operators.  Perl automatically generates all  of  the  other
       comparison operators based on those two so all the normal logical comparisons will work.

         if ( version-&gt;parse($v1) == version-&gt;parse($v2) ) {
           # do stuff
         }

       If  a version object is compared against a non-version object, the non-object term will be converted to a
       version object using parse().  This may give surprising results:

         $v1 = version-&gt;parse("v0.95.0");
         $bool = $v1 &lt; 0.94; # TRUE since 0.94 is v0.940.0

       Always comparing to a version object will help avoid surprises:

         $bool = $v1 &lt; version-&gt;parse("v0.94.0"); # FALSE

       Note that "alpha" version objects (where the version  string  contains  a  trailing  underscore  segment)
       compare as less than the equivalent version without an underscore:

         $bool = version-&gt;parse("1.23_45") &lt; version-&gt;parse("1.2345"); # TRUE

       See version::Internals for more details on "alpha" versions.

</pre><h4><b>OBJECT</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>is_alpha()</b>
       True if and only if the version object was created with a underscore, e.g.

         version-&gt;parse('1.002_03')-&gt;is_alpha;  # TRUE
         version-&gt;declare('1.2.3_4')-&gt;is_alpha; # TRUE

   <b>is_qv()</b>
       True only if the version object is a dotted-decimal version, e.g.

         version-&gt;parse('v1.2.0')-&gt;is_qv;       # TRUE
         version-&gt;declare('v1.2')-&gt;is_qv;       # TRUE
         qv('1.2')-&gt;is_qv;                      # TRUE
         version-&gt;parse('1.2')-&gt;is_qv;          # FALSE

   <b>normal()</b>
       Returns  a  string  with  a  standard  'normalized'  dotted-decimal  form with a leading-v and at least 3
       components.

        version-&gt;declare('v1.2')-&gt;normal;  # v1.2.0
        version-&gt;parse('1.2')-&gt;normal;     # v1.200.0

   <b>numify()</b>
       Returns a value representing the object in a pure decimal.

        version-&gt;declare('v1.2')-&gt;numify;  # 1.002000
        version-&gt;parse('1.2')-&gt;numify;     # 1.200

   <b>stringify()</b>
       Returns a string that is  as  close  to  the  original  representation  as  possible.   If  the  original
       representation  was  a numeric literal, it will be returned the way perl would normally represent it in a
       string.  This method is used whenever a version object is interpolated into a string.

        version-&gt;declare('v1.2')-&gt;stringify;    # v1.2
        version-&gt;parse('1.200')-&gt;stringify;     # 1.2
        version-&gt;parse(1.02_30)-&gt;stringify;     # 1.023

</pre><h4><b>EXPORTED</b> <b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>qv()</b>
       This function is no longer recommended for use, but is maintained for compatibility with  existing  code.
       If you do not want to have it exported to your namespace, use this form:

         use version 0.77 ();

   <b>is_lax()</b>
       (Not exported by default)

       This  function  takes a scalar argument and returns a boolean value indicating whether the argument meets
       the "lax" rules for a version number.  Leading and trailing spaces are not allowed.

   <b>is_strict()</b>
       (Not exported by default)

       This function takes a scalar argument and returns a boolean value indicating whether the  argument  meets
       the "strict" rules for a version number.  Leading and trailing spaces are not allowed.
