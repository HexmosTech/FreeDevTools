</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       CPAN::Meta::History::Meta_1_1 - Version 1.1 metadata specification for META.yml

</pre><h4><b>PREFACE</b></h4><pre>
       This is a historical copy of the version 1.1 specification for <u>META.yml</u> files, copyright by Ken Williams
       and licensed under the same terms as Perl itself.

       Modifications from the original:

       •   Conversion from the original HTML to POD format

       •   Include  list of valid licenses from Module::Build 0.18 rather than linking to the module, with minor
           updates to text and links to reflect versions at the time of publication.

       •   Fixed some dead links to point to active resources.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This document describes version 1.1 of the <u>META.yml</u> specification.

       The <u>META.yml</u> file describes important properties of contributed Perl distributions such as the ones found
       on  CPAN  &lt;<a href="http://www.cpan.org">http://www.cpan.org</a>&gt;.   It  is   typically   created   by   tools   like   Module::Build   and
       ExtUtils::MakeMaker.

       The  fields  in  the <u>META.yml</u> file are meant to be helpful to people maintaining module collections (like
       CPAN), for people writing installation tools (like CPAN or CPANPLUS), or just people  who  want  to  know
       some stuff about a distribution before downloading it and starting to install it.

</pre><h4><b>Format</b></h4><pre>
       <u>META.yml</u>  files are written in the YAML &lt;<a href="http://www.yaml.org/">http://www.yaml.org/</a>&gt; format.  The reasons we chose YAML instead
       of,      say,      XML      or      Data::Dumper      are      discussed       in       this       thread
       &lt;<a href="http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.makemaker/2002/04/msg406.html">http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.makemaker/2002/04/msg406.html</a>&gt; on the MakeMaker mailing list.

       The    first    line    of    a    <u>META.yml</u>    file    should   be   a   valid   YAML   document   header
       &lt;<a href="http://yaml.org/spec/history/2002-10-31.html">http://yaml.org/spec/history/2002-10-31.html</a>#syntax-document&gt; like "--- #YAML:1.0"

</pre><h4><b>Fields</b></h4><pre>
       The      rest      of      the      META.yml      file      is      one      big       YAML       mapping
       &lt;<a href="http://yaml.org/spec/history/2002-10-31.html">http://yaml.org/spec/history/2002-10-31.html</a>#syntax-mapping&gt;, whose keys are described here.

       name
           Example: "Module-Build"

           The  name  of  the  distribution.   Often created by taking the "main module" in the distribution and
           changing "::" to "-".  Sometimes it's completely different, however, as in the case  of  the  libwww-
           perl &lt;<a href="http://search.cpan.org/author/GAAS/libwww-perl/">http://search.cpan.org/author/GAAS/libwww-perl/</a>&gt; distribution.

       version
           Example: 0.16

           The version of the distribution to which the META.yml file refers.  This is a mandatory field.

           The  version  is  essentially  an  arbitrary  string, but <u>must</u> be only ASCII characters, and <u>strongly</u>
           <u>should</u> be of the format integer-dot-digit-digit, i.e. 25.57, optionally followed by underscore-digit-
           digit, i.e. "25.57_04".

           The standard tools that deal with module distribution (PAUSE, CPAN, etc.) form an identifier for each
           distribution by joining the 'name' and 'version' attributes with a dash ("-") character.   Tools  who
           are prepared to deal with distributions that have no version numbers generally omit the dash as well.

       license
           Example: "perl"

           a  descriptive  term  for  the  licenses ... not authoritative, but must be consistent with licensure
           statements in the READMEs, documentation, etc.

           The license under which this distribution may be used and redistributed.

           Must be one of the following licenses:

           perl
               The distribution may be copied and redistributed under the same terms as perl itself (this is  by
               far  the most common licensing option for modules on CPAN).  This is a dual license, in which the
               user may choose between either the GPL version 1 or the Artistic version 1 license.

           gpl The distribution is distributed under the terms of the  GNU  General  Public  License  version  2
               (&lt;<a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/GPL-2.0">http://opensource.org/licenses/GPL-2.0</a>&gt;).

           lgpl
               The  distribution is distributed under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License version
               2 (&lt;<a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/LGPL-2.1">http://opensource.org/licenses/LGPL-2.1</a>&gt;).

           artistic
               The distribution is licensed under the Artistic License version 1, as specified by  the  Artistic
               file in the standard perl distribution (&lt;<a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/Artistic-Perl-1.0">http://opensource.org/licenses/Artistic-Perl-1.0</a>&gt;).

           bsd The      distribution      is      licensed      under      the      BSD     3-Clause     License
               (&lt;<a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause">http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause</a>&gt;).

           open_source
               The distribution is licensed under some other Open Source Initiative-approved license  listed  at
               &lt;<a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/">http://www.opensource.org/licenses/</a>&gt;.

           unrestricted
               The  distribution  is  licensed  under  a  license  that  is  <b>not</b>  approved by www.opensource.org
               &lt;<a href="http://www.opensource.org/">http://www.opensource.org/</a>&gt; but that allows distribution without restrictions.

           restrictive
               The distribution may not be redistributed without  special  permission  from  the  author  and/or
               copyright holder.

       license_uri
           This should contain a URI where the exact terms of the license may be found.

           (change "unrestricted" to "redistributable"?)

       distribution_type
           Example: "module"

           What  kind  of stuff is contained in this distribution.  Most things on CPAN are "module"s (which can
           also mean a collection of modules), but some things are "script"s.

           This field is basically meaningless, and tools (like Module::Build or  MakeMaker)  will  likely  stop
           generating it in the future.

       private
           WTF is going on here?

           index_ignore:  any  application  that  indexes the contents of distributions (PAUSE, search.cpan.org)
           ought to ignore the items (packages, files, directories, namespace hierarchies).

       requires
           Example:

             Data::Dumper: 0
             File::Find: 1.03

           A YAML  mapping  &lt;<a href="http://yaml.org/spec/history/2002-10-31.html">http://yaml.org/spec/history/2002-10-31.html</a>#syntax-mapping&gt;  indicating  the  Perl
           modules  this  distribution  requires  for  proper operation.  The keys are the module names, and the
           values are version specifications as described in the documentation  for  Module::Build's  "requires"
           parameter.

           <u>Note:</u> <u>the</u> <u>exact</u> <u>nature</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>fancy</u> <u>specifications</u> <u>like</u> <u>"&gt;=</u> <u>1.2,</u> <u>!=</u> <u>1.5,</u> <u>&lt;</u> <u>2.0"</u> <u>is</u> <u>subject</u> <u>to</u> <u>change.</u>
           <u>Advance</u> <u>notice</u> <u>will</u> <u>be</u> <u>given</u> <u>here.</u>  <u>The</u> <u>simple</u> <u>specifications</u> <u>like</u> <u>"1.2"</u> <u>will</u> <u>not</u> <u>change</u> <u>in</u> <u>format.</u>

       recommends
           Example:

             Data::Dumper: 0
             File::Find: 1.03

           A  YAML  mapping  &lt;<a href="http://yaml.org/spec/history/2002-10-31.html">http://yaml.org/spec/history/2002-10-31.html</a>#syntax-mapping&gt;  indicating  the Perl
           modules this distribution recommends for enhanced operation.

       build_requires
           Example:

             Data::Dumper: 0
             File::Find: 1.03

           A YAML  mapping  &lt;<a href="http://yaml.org/spec/history/2002-10-31.html">http://yaml.org/spec/history/2002-10-31.html</a>#syntax-mapping&gt;  indicating  the  Perl
           modules  required  for  building  and/or  testing  of  this distribution.  These dependencies are not
           required after the module is installed.

       conflicts
           Example:

             Data::Dumper: 0
             File::Find: 1.03

           A YAML  mapping  &lt;<a href="http://yaml.org/spec/history/2002-10-31.html">http://yaml.org/spec/history/2002-10-31.html</a>#syntax-mapping&gt;  indicating  the  Perl
           modules  that  cannot  be  installed while this distribution is installed.  This is a pretty uncommon
           situation.

           - possibly separate out test-time prereqs, complications include: can tests be meaningfully preserved
           for later running?  are test-time prereqs in addition to build-time, or exclusive?

           - make official location for installed *distributions*, which can contain tests, etc.

       dynamic_config
           Example: 0

           A boolean flag indicating whether a <u>Build.PL</u> or <u>Makefile.PL</u> (or similar) must be executed, or whether
           this module can be built, tested and installed solely from consulting its metadata  file.   The  main
           reason  to  set  this to a true value if that your module performs some dynamic configuration (asking
           questions, sensing the environment, etc.) as part of its build/install process.

           Currently Module::Build doesn't actually do anything with this flag - it's probably going to be up to
           higher-level tools like CPAN.pm to do something useful with it.  It can  potentially  bring  lots  of
           security, packaging, and convenience improvements.

       generated_by
           Example: "Module::Build version 0.16"

           Indicates  the  tool  that was used to create this <u>META.yml</u> file.  It's good form to include both the
           name of the tool and its version, but this field is essentially opaque, at least for the moment.

   <b>Ingy's</b> <b>suggestions</b>
       short_description
           add as field, containing abstract, maximum 80 characters, suggested minimum 40 characters

       description
           long version of abstract, should add?

       maturity
           alpha, beta, gamma, mature, stable

       author_id, owner_id
       categorization, keyword, chapter_id
       URL for further information
           could default to search.cpan.org on PAUSE

       namespaces
           can    be    specified    for     single     elements     by     prepending     dotted-form,     i.e.
           "com.example.my_application.my_property".     Default    namespace    for    META.yml   is   probably
           "org.cpan.meta_author" or something.  Precedent for this is Apple's Carbon namespaces, I think.
