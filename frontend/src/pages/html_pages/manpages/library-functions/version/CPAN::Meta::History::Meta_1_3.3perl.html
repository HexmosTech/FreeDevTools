       CPAN::Meta::History::Meta_1_3 - Version 1.3 metadata specification for META.yml

</pre><h4><b>PREFACE</b></h4><pre>
       This is a historical copy of the version 1.3 specification for <u>META.yml</u> files, copyright by Ken Williams
       and licensed under the same terms as Perl itself.

       Modifications from the original:

       •   Various spelling corrections

       •   Include  list  of  valid  licenses  from Module::Build 0.2805 rather than linking to the module, with
           minor updates to text and links to reflect versions at the time of publication.

       •   Fixed some dead links to point to active resources.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This document describes version 1.3 of the <u>META.yml</u> specification.

       The <u>META.yml</u> file describes important properties of contributed Perl distributions such as the ones found
       on CPAN.  It is typically created by tools like Module::Build, Module::Install, and ExtUtils::MakeMaker.

       The fields in the <u>META.yml</u> file are meant to be helpful for people maintaining module  collections  (like
       CPAN),  for  people writing installation tools (like CPAN.pm or CPANPLUS), or just for people who want to
       know some stuff about a distribution before downloading it and starting to install it.

       <u>Note:</u>   <u>The</u>   <u>latest</u>   <u>stable</u>   <u>version</u>   <u>of</u>   <u>this</u>   <u>specification</u>    <u>can</u>    <u>always</u>    <u>be</u>    <u>found</u>    <u>at</u>
       <u>&lt;<a href="http://module-build.sourceforge.net/META-spec-current.html">http://module-build.sourceforge.net/META-spec-current.html</a>&gt;,</u>  <u>and</u>  <u>the</u> <u>latest</u> <u>development</u> <u>version</u> <u>(which</u>
       <u>may</u>  <u>include</u>  <u>things</u>  <u>that</u>  <u>won't</u>  <u>make</u>  <u>it</u>  <u>into</u>  <u>the</u>  <u>stable</u>  <u>version)</u>   <u>can</u>   <u>always</u>   <u>be</u>   <u>found</u>   <u>at</u>
       <u>&lt;<a href="http://module-build.sourceforge.net/META-spec-blead.html">http://module-build.sourceforge.net/META-spec-blead.html</a>&gt;.</u>

</pre><h4><b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
       <u>META.yml</u> files are written in the YAML format (see &lt;<a href="http://www.yaml.org/">http://www.yaml.org/</a>&gt;).

       See the following links to learn why we chose YAML instead of, say, XML or Data::Dumper:

       •   Module::Build design plans &lt;<a href="http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.makemaker/2002/04/msg407.html">http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.makemaker/2002/04/msg407.html</a>&gt;

       •   Not keen on YAML &lt;<a href="http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.module-authors/2003/11/msg1353.html">http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.module-authors/2003/11/msg1353.html</a>&gt;

       •   META Concerns &lt;<a href="http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.module-authors/2003/11/msg1385.html">http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.module-authors/2003/11/msg1385.html</a>&gt;

</pre><h4><b>TERMINOLOGY</b></h4><pre>
       distribution
           This  is  the primary object described by the <u>META.yml</u> specification. In the context of this document
           it usually refers to a collection of modules, scripts, and/or documents that are distributed together
           for other developers to use.  Examples of  distributions  are  "Class-Container",  "libwww-perl",  or
           "DBI".

       module
           This  refers  to  a  reusable  library  of  code  typically contained in a single file. Currently, we
           primarily talk of perl modules, but this specification should  be  open  enough  to  apply  to  other
           languages  as well (ex. python, ruby).  Examples of modules are "Class::Container", "LWP::Simple", or
           "DBD::File".

</pre><h4><b>HEADER</b></h4><pre>
       The first line of a <u>META.yml</u> file should be a valid YAML document header like "--- #YAML:1.0".

</pre><h4><b>FIELDS</b></h4><pre>
       The rest of the <u>META.yml</u> file is one big YAML mapping whose keys are described here.

   <b>meta-spec</b>
       Example:

        meta-spec:
          version: 1.3
          url: <a href="http://module-build.sourceforge.net/META-spec-v1.3.html">http://module-build.sourceforge.net/META-spec-v1.3.html</a>

       (Spec 1.1)  [required]  {URL}  This  field  indicates  the  location  of  the  version  of  the  META.yml
       specification used.

   <b>name</b>
       Example:

         name: Module-Build

       (Spec  1.0)  [required]  {string} The name of the distribution which is often created by taking the "main
       module" in the distribution and changing "::" to "-".  Sometimes it's completely different,  however,  as
       in the case of the libwww-perl distribution (see &lt;<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/libwww-perl/">http://search.cpan.org/dist/libwww-perl/</a>&gt;).

   <b>version</b>
       Example:

         version: 0.20

       (Spec 1.0) [required] {version} The version of the distribution to which the <u>META.yml</u> file refers.

   <b>abstract</b>
       Example:

         abstract: Build and install Perl modules.

       (Spec 1.1) [required] {string} A short description of the purpose of the distribution.

   <b>author</b>
       Example:

         author:
           - Ken Williams &lt;<a href="mailto:kwilliams@cpan.org">kwilliams@cpan.org</a>&gt;

       (Spec 1.1) [required] {list of strings} A YAML sequence indicating the author(s) of the distribution. The
       preferred form is author-name &lt;email-address&gt;.

   <b>license</b>
       Example:

         license: perl

       (Spec 1.0) [required] {string} The license under which this distribution may be used and redistributed.

       Must be one of the following licenses:

       apache
           The    distribution    is    licensed    under    the    Apache    Software   License   version   1.1
           (&lt;<a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-1.1">http://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-1.1</a>&gt;).

       artistic
           The distribution is licensed under the Artistic License version 1, as specified by the Artistic  file
           in the standard perl distribution (&lt;<a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/Artistic-Perl-1.0">http://opensource.org/licenses/Artistic-Perl-1.0</a>&gt;).

       bsd The       distribution       is      licensed      under      the      BSD      3-Clause      License
           (&lt;<a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause">http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause</a>&gt;).

       gpl The distribution is distributed under  the  terms  of  the  GNU  General  Public  License  version  2
           (&lt;<a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/GPL-2.0">http://opensource.org/licenses/GPL-2.0</a>&gt;).

       lgpl
           The  distribution  is  distributed under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License version 2
           (&lt;<a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/LGPL-2.1">http://opensource.org/licenses/LGPL-2.1</a>&gt;).

       mit The distribution is licensed under the MIT License (&lt;<a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT">http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT</a>&gt;).

       mozilla
           The     distribution      is      licensed      under      the      Mozilla      Public      License.
           (&lt;<a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/MPL-1.0">http://opensource.org/licenses/MPL-1.0</a>&gt; or &lt;<a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/MPL-1.1">http://opensource.org/licenses/MPL-1.1</a>&gt;)

       open_source
           The  distribution  is  licensed  under  some  other Open Source Initiative-approved license listed at
           &lt;<a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/">http://www.opensource.org/licenses/</a>&gt;.

       perl
           The distribution may be copied and redistributed under the same terms as perl itself (this is by  far
           the most common licensing option for modules on CPAN).  This is a dual license, in which the user may
           choose between either the GPL version 1 or the Artistic version 1 license.

       restrictive
           The distribution may not be redistributed without special permission from the author and/or copyright
           holder.

       unrestricted
           The   distribution   is  licensed  under  a  license  that  is  not  approved  by  www.opensource.org
           &lt;<a href="http://www.opensource.org/">http://www.opensource.org/</a>&gt; but that allows distribution without restrictions.

   <b>distribution_type</b>
       Example:

         distribution_type: module

       (Spec 1.0) [optional] {string} What kind of stuff is contained in this distribution.  Most things on CPAN
       are "module"s (which can also mean a collection of modules), but some things are "script"s.

       Unfortunately this field is basically meaningless, since many distributions are hybrids of several  kinds
       of  things,  or  some new thing, or subjectively different in focus depending on who's using them.  Tools
       like Module::Build and MakeMaker will likely stop generating this field.

   <b>requires</b>
       Example:

         requires:
           Data::Dumper: 0
           File::Find: 1.03

       (Spec 1.0) [optional] {map} A YAML mapping indicating the Perl modules  this  distribution  requires  for
       proper  operation.  The keys are the module names, and the values are version specifications as described
       in "VERSION SPECIFICATIONS".

   <b>recommends</b>
       Example:

         recommends:
           Data::Dumper: 0
           File::Find: 1.03

       (Spec 1.0) [optional] {map} A YAML mapping indicating the Perl modules this distribution  recommends  for
       enhanced  operation.   The  keys  are  the  module  names,  and  the values are version specifications as
       described in "VERSION SPECIFICATIONS".

       <u>ALTERNATIVE:</u> <u>It</u> <u>may</u> <u>be</u> <u>desirable</u> <u>to</u> <u>present</u> <u>to</u> <u>the</u> <u>user</u> <u>which</u> <u>features</u> <u>depend</u> <u>on</u> <u>which</u>  <u>modules</u>  <u>so</u>  <u>they</u>
       <u>can</u> <u>make</u> <u>an</u> <u>informed</u> <u>decision</u> <u>about</u> <u>which</u> <u>recommended</u> <u>modules</u> <u>to</u> <u>install.</u>

       Example:

         optional_features:
         - foo:
             description: Provides the ability to blah.
             requires:
               Data::Dumper: 0
               File::Find: 1.03
         - bar:
             description: This feature is not available on this platform.
             excludes_os: MSWin32

       <u>(Spec</u>  <u>1.1)</u> <u>[optional]</u> <u>{map}</u> <u>A</u> <u>YAML</u> <u>sequence</u> <u>of</u> <u>names</u> <u>for</u> <u>optional</u> <u>features</u> <u>which</u> <u>are</u> <u>made</u> <u>available</u> <u>when</u>
       <u>its</u> <u>requirements</u> <u>are</u> <u>met.</u> <u>For</u> <u>each</u> <u>feature</u> <u>a</u> <u>description</u>  <u>is</u>  <u>provided</u>  <u>along</u>  <u>with</u>  <u>any</u>  <u>of</u>  <u>"requires",</u>
       <u>"build_requires",</u>  <u>"conflicts",</u> <u>"requires_packages",</u> <u>"requires_os",</u> <u>and</u> <u>"excludes_os"</u> <u>which</u> <u>have</u> <u>the</u> <u>same</u>
       <u>meaning</u> <u>in</u> <u>this</u> <u>subcontext</u> <u>as</u> <u>described</u> <u>elsewhere</u> <u>in</u> <u>this</u> <u>document.</u>

   <b>build_requires</b>
       Example:

         build_requires:
           Data::Dumper: 0
           File::Find: 1.03

       (Spec 1.0) [optional] {map} A YAML mapping indicating the  Perl  modules  required  for  building  and/or
       testing  of  this distribution.  The keys are the module names, and the values are version specifications
       as described in "VERSION SPECIFICATIONS".  These dependencies  are  not  required  after  the  module  is
       installed.

   <b>conflicts</b>
       Example:

         conflicts:
           Data::Dumper: 0
           File::Find: 1.03

       (Spec  1.0)  [optional]  {map}  A YAML mapping indicating the Perl modules that cannot be installed while
       this distribution is installed.  This is a pretty uncommon situation.  The keys for "conflicts"  are  the
       module names, and the values are version specifications as described in "VERSION SPECIFICATIONS".

   <b>dynamic_config</b>
       Example:

         dynamic_config: 0

       (Spec  1.0) [optional] {boolean} A boolean flag indicating whether a <u>Build.PL</u> or <u>Makefile.PL</u> (or similar)
       must be executed when building this distribution, or whether it can be built, tested and installed solely
       from consulting its metadata file.  The main reason to set this to a  true  value  is  that  your  module
       performs  some  dynamic  configuration  (asking  questions, sensing the environment, etc.) as part of its
       build/install process.

       Currently Module::Build doesn't actually do anything with this flag - it's probably going  to  be  up  to
       higher-level  tools like CPAN to do something useful with it.  It can potentially bring lots of security,
       packaging, and convenience improvements.

       If this field is omitted, it defaults to 1 (true).

   <b>private</b>
       <u>(Deprecated)</u> (Spec 1.0) [optional] {map} This field has been renamed to "no_index".  See below.

   <b>provides</b>
       Example:

         provides:
           Foo::Bar:
             file: lib/Foo/Bar.pm
             version: 0.27_02
           Foo::Bar::Blah:
             file: lib/Foo/Bar/Blah.pm
           Foo::Bar::Baz:
             file: lib/Foo/Bar/Baz.pm
             version: 0.3

       (Spec 1.1) [optional] {map} A YAML mapping that describes all packages  provided  by  this  distribution.
       This  information  can  be  (and,  in some cases, is) used by distribution and automation mechanisms like
       PAUSE, CPAN, and search.cpan.org to build indexes saying in which distribution various  packages  can  be
       found.

       When  using  tools  like  Module::Build  that  can  generate the "provides" mapping for your distribution
       automatically, make sure you examine what it generates to make  sure  it  makes  sense  -  indexers  will
       usually  trust  the "provides" field if it's present, rather than scanning through the distribution files
       themselves to figure out packages and versions.  This is a good thing, because it means you can  use  the
       "provides"  field  to  tell  the indexers precisely what you want indexed about your distribution, rather
       than relying on them to essentially guess what you want indexed.

   <b>no_index</b>
       Example:

         no_index:
           file:
           - My/Module.pm
           directory:
           - My/Private
           package:
           - My::Module::Stuff
           namespace:
           - My::Module::Stuff

       (Spec 1.1) [optional] {map}  A  YAML  mapping  that  describes  any  files,  directories,  packages,  and
       namespaces  that  are  private  (i.e. implementation artifacts) that are not of interest to searching and
       indexing tools.  This is useful when no "provides" field is present.

       For example, &lt;<a href="http://search.cpan.org/">http://search.cpan.org/</a>&gt; excludes items  listed  in  "no_index"  when  searching  for  POD,
       meaning  files  in  these directories will not converted to HTML and made public - which is useful if you
       have example or test PODs that you don't want the search engine to go through.

       <u>file</u>

       (Spec 1.1) [optional] Exclude any listed file(s).

       <u>directory</u>

       (Spec 1.1) [optional] Exclude anything below the listed directory(ies).

       [Note: previous editions of the spec had "dir" instead of "directory", but I think MakeMaker and  various
       users started using "directory", so in deference we switched to that.]

       <u>package</u>

       (Spec 1.1) [optional] Exclude the listed package(s).

       <u>namespace</u>

       (Spec  1.1)  [optional]  Excludes anything below the listed namespace(s), but <u>not</u> the listed namespace(s)
       its self.

   <b>keywords</b>
       Example:

         keywords:
           - make
           - build
           - install

       (Spec 1.1) [optional] {list} A sequence of keywords/phrases that describe this distribution.

   <b>resources</b>
       Example:

         resources:
           license: <a href="http://dev.perl.org/licenses/">http://dev.perl.org/licenses/</a>
           homepage: <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/module-build">http://sourceforge.net/projects/module-build</a>
           bugtracker: <a href="http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/Bugs.html">http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/Bugs.html</a>?Dist=Module-Build
           repository: <a href="http://sourceforge.net/cvs/">http://sourceforge.net/cvs/</a>?group_id=45731
           MailingList: <a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/module-build-general">http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/module-build-general</a>

       (Spec 1.1) [optional] {map} A mapping of any URL resources related to this distribution.   All-lower-case
       keys,  such  as "homepage", "license", and "bugtracker", are reserved by this specification, as they have
       "official" meanings defined here in this specification.  If you'd like to add your own "special"  entries
       (like the "MailingList" entry above), use at least one upper-case letter.

       The current set of official keys is:

       homepage
         The official home of this project on the web.

       license
         An URL for an official statement of this distribution's license.

       bugtracker
         An URL for a bug tracker (e.g. Bugzilla or RT queue) for this project.

   <b>generated_by</b>
       Example:

         generated_by: Module::Build version 0.20

       (Spec  1.0) [required] {string} Indicates the tool that was used to create this <u>META.yml</u> file.  It's good
       form to include both the name of the tool and its version, but this field is essentially opaque, at least
       for the moment. If <u>META.yml</u> was generated by hand, it is suggested that the author be specified here.

       [Note: My <u>meta_stats.pl</u> script which I use to gather statistics regarding <u>META.yml</u> usage prefers the form
       listed above, i.e. it splits on /\s+version\s+/ taking the first field as  the  name  of  the  tool  that
       generated the file and the second field as version of that tool. RWS]

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b> <b>SPECIFICATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Some  fields  require  a  version specification (ex. "requires", "recommends", "build_requires", etc.) to
       indicate the particular version(s) of some other module that may be required  as  a  prerequisite.   This
       section details the version specification formats that are currently supported.

       The  simplest format for a version specification is just the version number itself, e.g. 2.4.  This means
       that <b>at</b> <b>least</b> version 2.4 must be present.  To indicate that <b>any</b> version of a prerequisite is okay,  even
       if the prerequisite doesn't define a version at all, use the version 0.

       You may also use the operators &lt; (less than), &lt;= (less than or equal), &gt; (greater than), &gt;= (greater than
       or  equal),  == (equal), and != (not equal).  For example, the specification &lt; 2.0 means that any version
       of the prerequisite less than 2.0 is suitable.

       For more complicated situations, version  specifications  may  be  AND-ed  together  using  commas.   The
       specification &gt;= 1.2, != 1.5, &lt; 2.0 indicates a version that must be <b>at</b> <b>least</b> 1.2, <b>less</b> <b>than</b> 2.0, and <b>not</b>
       <b>equal</b> <b>to</b> 1.5.

       March 14, 2003 (Pi day)
           • Created version 1.0 of this document.

       May 8, 2003
           • Added the "dynamic_config" field, which was missing from the initial version.

       November 13, 2003
           • Added more YAML rationale articles.

           • Fixed existing link to YAML discussion thread to point to new &lt;<a href="http://nntp.x.perl.org/group/">http://nntp.x.perl.org/group/</a>&gt; site.

           • Added and deprecated the "private" field.

           • Added  "abstract",  "configure",  "requires_packages", "requires_os", "excludes_os", and "no_index"
             fields.

           • Bumped version.

       November 16, 2003
           • Added "generation", "authored_by" fields.

           • Add alternative proposal to the "recommends" field.

           • Add proposal for a "requires_build_tools" field.

       December 9, 2003
           • Added link to latest version of this specification on CPAN.

           • Added section "VERSION SPECIFICATIONS".

           • Chang name from Module::Build::META-spec to CPAN::META::Specification.

           • Add proposal for "auto_regenerate" field.

       December 15, 2003
           • Add "index" field as a compliment to "no_index"

           • Add "keywords" field as a means to aid searching distributions.

           • Add "TERMINOLOGY" section to explain certain terms that may be ambiguous.

       July 26, 2005
           • Removed  a  bunch  of  items  (generation,  requires_build_tools,   requires_packages,   configure,
             requires_os,  excludes_os,  auto_regenerate) that have never actually been supported, but were more
             like records of brainstorming.

           • Changed "authored_by" to "author", since that's always been what it's  actually  called  in  actual
             <u>META.yml</u> files.

           • Added the "==" operator to the list of supported version-checking operators.

           • Noted that the "distribution_type" field is basically meaningless, and shouldn't really be used.

           • Clarified "dynamic_config" a bit.

       August 23, 2005
           • Removed  the  name  "CPAN::META::Specification",  since that implies a module that doesn't actually
             exist.
