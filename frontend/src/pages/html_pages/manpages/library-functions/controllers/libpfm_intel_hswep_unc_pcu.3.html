       <b>PMU</b> <b>desc:</b> <b>Intel</b> <b>Haswell-EP</b> <b>PCU</b> <b>uncore</b> <b>PMU</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  library  supports the Intel Haswell Power Controller Unit uncore PMU.  This PMU model only exists on
       Haswell model 63.

</pre><h4><b>MODIFIERS</b></h4><pre>
       The following modifiers are supported on Intel Haswell PCU uncore PMU:

       <b>e</b>      Enable edge detection, i.e., count only when there is a state transition from no occurrence of the
              event to at least one occurrence. This modifier must be combined with  a  threshold  modifier  (t)
              with a value greater or equal to one.  This is a boolean modifier.

       <b>t</b>      Set  the threshold value. When set to a non-zero value, the counter counts the number of HA cycles
              in which the number of occurrences of the event is greater or equal to the threshold.  This is  an
              integer modifier with values in the range [0:15].

       <b>i</b>      Invert  the  meaning  of the threshold or edge filter. If set, the event counts when strictly less
              than N occurrences occur per cycle if threshold is set to N. When invert is  set,  then  threshold
              must  be set to non-zero value. If set, the event counts when the event transitions from occurring
              to not occurring (falling edge) when edge detection is set. This is a boolean modifier

       <b>ff</b>     Enable frequency band filtering. This modifier applies only to the UNC_P_FREQ_BANDx_CYCLES events,
              where x is [0-3].  The modifiers expects an integer in the range [0-255]. The value is interpreted
              as a frequency value to be multiplied by 100Mhz. Thus if the value is 32, then  all  cycles  where
              the processor is running at 3.2GHz and more are counted.

</pre><h4><b>Frequency</b> <b>band</b> <b>filtering</b></h4><pre>
       There   are   3   events   which  support  frequency  band  filtering,  namely,  UNC_P_FREQ_BAND0_CYCLES,
       UNC_P_FREQ_BAND1_CYCLES,   UNC_P_FREQ_BAND2_CYCLES,   UNC_P_FREQ_BAND3_CYCLES.   The   frequency   filter
       (available  via the ff modifier) is stored into a PMU shared register which hold all 4 possible frequency
       bands, one per event. However, the library generate the encoding for each event individually  because  it
       processes  events one at a time. The caller or the underlying kernel interface may have to merge the band
       filter settings to program the filter register properly.
