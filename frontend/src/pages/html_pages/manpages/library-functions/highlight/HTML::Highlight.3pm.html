       HTML::Highlight - A module to highlight words or patterns in HTML documents

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
               use HTML::Highlight;

               # create the highlighter object

               my $hl = new HTML::Highlight (
                       words =&gt; [
                               'word',
                               'any',
                               'car',
                               'some phrase'
                       ],
                       wildcards =&gt; [
                               undef,
                               '%',
                               '*',
                               undef
                       ],
                       colors =&gt; [
                               '#FF0000',
                               'red',
                               'green',
                               'rgb(255, 0, 0)'
                       ],
                       czech_language =&gt; 0,
                       debug =&gt; 0
               );

               # Remember that you don't need to specify your own colors.
               # The default colors should be optimal.

               # Now you can use the object to highlight patterns in a document
               # by passing content of the document to its highlight() method.
               # The highlighter object "remembers" its configuration.

               my $highlighted_document = $hl-&gt;highlight($document);

</pre><h4><b>MOTIVATION</b></h4><pre>
       This module was originaly created to work together with fulltext indexing module DBIx::TextIndex to
       highlight search results.

       A need for a highlighter that takes wildcard matches and HTML tags into account and supports czech
       language (or other Slavic languages) was the motivation to create this module.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module provides Google-like highlighting of words or patterns in HTML documents. This feature is
       typically used to highlight search results.

       The construcutor:
                   my $hl = new HTML::Highlight (
                           words =&gt; [],
                           wildcards =&gt; [],
                           colors =&gt; [],
                           czech_language =&gt; 0,
                           debug =&gt; 0
                   );

           This is a constructor of the highlighter object. It takes an array of even number of parameters.

           The <b>words</b> parameter is a reference to an array of words to highlight.

           The  <b>wildcards</b>  parameter  is a reference to an array of wildcards, that are applied to corresponding
           words in the <b>words</b> array.

           A wildcard can be either undef or one of '%' or '*'.

           <b>The</b> <b>"%"</b> <b>character</b> means "match any characters":

                   "%" applied to 'car' ==&gt; matches "car", "cars", "careful", ...

           <b>The</b> <b>"*"</b> <b>character</b> means "match also plural form of the word":

                   "*" applied to 'car' ==&gt; matches only "car" or "cars"

           <b>An</b> <b>undefined</b> <b>wildcard</b> means "match exactly the corresponding word":

                   undefined wildcard applied to 'car' ==&gt; matches only "car"

           The <b>colors</b> parameter is a reference to an array  of  CSS  color  identificators,  that  are  used  to
           highlight the corresponding words in the <b>words</b> array.

           Default  Google-like  colors  are  used if you don't specify your own colors. Number of colors can be
           lower than number of words - in this case the colors are rotated and some of the words are  therefore
           highlighted using the same color.

           The  highlighter  takes HTML tags into account and therefore does not "highlight" a word or a pattern
           inside a tag.

           A support for diacritics insenstive matching for ISO-8859-2 languages  (for  for  example  the  czech
           language)  can  be  activated  using the <b>czech_language</b> option. This feature requires a module <b>CzFast</b>
           that is available on CPAN in a directory of author TRIPIE or at <a href="http://geocities.com/tripiecz/">http://geocities.com/tripiecz/</a>.

           <b>Your</b> <b>system's</b> <b>locales</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>set</b> <b>correctly</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>czech_language</b> <b>feature.</b>

       highlight
                   my $hl_document = $hl-&gt;highlight($document);

           The only parameter is a document in that you want to highlight the words  that  were  passed  to  the
           constructor  of  the  highlighter  object.  The method returns a version of the document in which the
           words are highlighted.

       preview_context
                   my $sections = $hl-&gt;preview_context($document, $num);

           This method takes two parameters. The first one is the document you want to scan for the  words  that
           were passed to the constructor of the highlighter object. The second parameter is an optional integer
           that  specifies  maximum  number  of  characters  in  each  of the context sections (see below). This
           parameter defaults to 80 characters if it's not specified. Minimum allowed value of this parameter is
           60.

           The method returns a reference to an array of sections of the document in which the words  that  were
           passed  to  the  constructor appear.  HTML tags are removed before the document is proccessed and are
           not present in the output.  This feature is typically used in search engines to preview a context  in
           which  words  from  a  search  query  appear in the resulting documents.  The words are always in the
           middle of each of the sections. The number of sections this method returns is equal to the number  of
           words  passed  to the constructor of the highlighter object.  That means only the first occurrence of
           each of the words is taken into account.
