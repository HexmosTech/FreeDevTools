</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       File::stat - by-name interface to Perl's built-in stat() functions

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        use File::stat;
        my $st = stat($file) or die "No $file: $!";
        if ( ($st-&gt;mode &amp; 0111) &amp;&amp; ($st-&gt;nlink &gt; 1) ) {
            print "$file is executable with lotsa links\n";
        }

        if ( -x $st ) {
            print "$file is executable\n";
        }

        use Fcntl "S_IRUSR";
        if ( $st-&gt;cando(S_IRUSR, 1) ) {
            print "My effective uid can read $file\n";
        }

        use File::stat qw(:FIELDS);
        stat($file) or die "No $file: $!";
        if ( ($st_mode &amp; 0111) &amp;&amp; ($st_nlink &gt; 1) ) {
            print "$file is executable with lotsa links\n";
        }

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module's default exports override the core <b>stat()</b> and <b>lstat()</b> functions, replacing them with
       versions that return "File::stat" objects.  This object has methods that return the similarly named
       structure field name from the <b><a href="../man2/stat.2.html">stat</a></b>(2) function; namely, dev, ino, mode, nlink, uid, gid, rdev, size,
       atime, mtime, ctime, blksize, and blocks.

       As of version 1.02 (provided with perl 5.12) the object provides "-X" overloading, so you can call
       filetest operators ("-f", "-x", and so on) on it. It also provides a "-&gt;cando" method, called like

        $st-&gt;cando( ACCESS, EFFECTIVE )

       where <u>ACCESS</u> is one of "S_IRUSR", "S_IWUSR" or "S_IXUSR" from the Fcntl module, and <u>EFFECTIVE</u> indicates
       whether to use effective (true) or real (false) ids. The method interprets the "mode", "uid" and "gid"
       fields, and returns whether or not the current process would be allowed the specified access.

       If you don't want to use the objects, you may import the "-&gt;cando" method into your namespace as a
       regular function called "stat_cando".  This takes an arrayref containing the return values of "stat" or
       "lstat" as its first argument, and interprets it for you.

       You may also import all the structure fields directly into your namespace as regular variables using the
       :FIELDS import tag.  (Note that this still overrides your <b>stat()</b> and <b>lstat()</b> functions.)  Access these
       fields as variables named with a preceding "st_" in front their method names.  Thus, "$stat_obj-&gt;dev()"
       corresponds to $st_dev if you import the fields.

       To access this functionality without the core overrides, pass the "use" an empty import list, and then
       access function functions with their full qualified names.  On the other hand, the built-ins are still
       available via the "CORE::" pseudo-package.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       As of Perl 5.8.0 after using this module you cannot use the implicit $_ or the special filehandle "_"
       with <b>stat()</b> or <b>lstat()</b>, trying to do so leads into strange errors.  The workaround is for $_ to be
       explicit

           my $stat_obj = stat $_;

       and for "_" to explicitly populate the object using the unexported and undocumented <b>populate()</b> function
       with <b>CORE::stat()</b>:

           my $stat_obj = File::stat::populate(CORE::stat(_));

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       -%s is not implemented on a File::stat object
           The filetest operators "-t", "-T" and "-B" are not implemented, as they require more information than
           just a stat buffer.

</pre><h4><b>WARNINGS</b></h4><pre>
       These can all be disabled with

           no warnings "File::stat";

       File::stat ignores use filetest 'access'
           You  have  tried  to  use  one  of  the  "-rwxRWX"  filetests with "use filetest 'access'" in effect.
           "File::stat" will ignore the pragma, and just use the information in the "mode" member as usual.

       File::stat ignores VMS ACLs
           VMS systems have a permissions structure that cannot be completely represented in a stat buffer,  and
           unlike  on  other  systems  the  builtin filetest operators respect this. The "File::stat" overloads,
           however, do not, since the information required is not available.

</pre><h4><b>NOTE</b></h4><pre>
       While this class is currently implemented using the Class::Struct module to build  a  struct-like  class,
       you shouldn't rely upon this.
