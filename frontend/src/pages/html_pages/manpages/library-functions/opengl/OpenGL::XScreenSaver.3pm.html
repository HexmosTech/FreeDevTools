       OpenGL::XScreenSaver - prepare environment for writing OpenGL-based XScreenSaver hacks

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        use OpenGL qw(:all);
        use OpenGL::XScreenSaver;

        OpenGL::XScreenSaver::init();
        # GetOptions(...); # parse your own options, if any

        OpenGL::XScreenSaver::start();

        while (1) {
            glClear(...);
            # draw your scene here
            OpenGL::XScreenSaver::update();
        }

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module allows you to write OpenGL XScreenSaver hacks in Perl. It prepares the GL to be used with
       XScreenSaver.

       Read the synopsis for how your program might look.

   <b>Description</b> <b>of</b> <b>functions</b>
       The <b>init()</b> function will return a true value if a window to draw on has been found, and a false value if
       a window will have to be created. This value can be ignored unless you want to make sure that your
       screenhack cannot be executed outside XScreenSaver (e.g. if your standalone version comes as an extra
       binary with keyboard control, which would be useless in a screensaver).

       The <b>start()</b> function will open the connection to the X server and bind to the window ID or create a new
       window to draw on (depends on if it was called standalone or from XScreenSaver).

       The <b>update()</b> function should be called when you finished rendering the frame. It will flush output and
       swap the buffers. In the future it might also handle a minimal set of X events when run in standalone
       mode (like window deletion requests by the window manager).

       The <b>dimensions()</b> function returns a list with the width and the height of the currently used window.

   <b>About</b> <b>screenhacks</b>
       What follows is a short description of how it works and what XScreenSaver expects a screenhack to do.

       XScreenSaver tells the hack on startup what window ID the hack shall draw to.  This is either a small
       window mapping to the screen in the preview dialog, or a fullscreen window. The window ID is passed
       either via the <b>-window-id</b> option or via the <b>XSCREENSAVER_WINDOW</b> environment variable. <b>init()</b> of this
       module checks both of these.

       XScreenSaver handles all user input including exiting and pausing the screensaver. The process is sent a
       SIGSTOP when the unlock screen is displayed, obviously a SIGCONT when it is dismissed, and when the
       pointing device is moved or the screen gets unlocked XScreenSaver sends a SIGTERM. This means that no
       event handling is required by your screenhack whatsoever. This again keeps the design of a screenhack
       dead simple.
