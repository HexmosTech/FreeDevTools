</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       XML::DOM::Element - An XML element node in XML::DOM

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       XML::DOM::Element extends XML::DOM::Node.

       By far the vast majority of objects (apart from text) that authors encounter when traversing a document
       are Element nodes. Assume the following XML document:

            &lt;elementExample id="demo"&gt;
              &lt;subelement1/&gt;
              &lt;subelement2&gt;&lt;subsubelement/&gt;&lt;/subelement2&gt;
            &lt;/elementExample&gt;

       When represented using DOM, the top node is an Element node for "elementExample", which contains two
       child Element nodes, one for "subelement1" and one for "subelement2". "subelement1" contains no child
       nodes.

       Elements may have attributes associated with them; since the Element interface inherits from Node, the
       generic Node interface method getAttributes may be used to retrieve the set of all attributes for an
       element. There are methods on the Element interface to retrieve either an Attr object by name or an
       attribute value by name. In XML, where an attribute value may contain entity references, an Attr object
       should be retrieved to examine the possibly fairly complex sub-tree representing the attribute value. On
       the other hand, in HTML, where all attributes have simple string values, methods to directly access an
       attribute value can safely be used as a convenience.

   <b>METHODS</b>
       getTagName
           The name of the element. For example, in:

                          &lt;elementExample id="demo"&gt;
                                  ...
                          &lt;/elementExample&gt;

           tagName  has  the value "elementExample". Note that this is case-preserving in XML, as are all of the
           operations of the DOM.

       getAttribute (name)
           Retrieves an attribute value by name.

           Return Value: The Attr value as a string, or the empty string if  that  attribute  does  not  have  a
           specified or default value.

       setAttribute (name, value)
           Adds  a new attribute. If an attribute with that name is already present in the element, its value is
           changed to be that of the value parameter. This value is a simple string, it is not parsed as  it  is
           being  set.  So  any  markup  (such  as syntax to be recognized as an entity reference) is treated as
           literal text, and needs to be appropriately escaped by the implementation when it is written out.  In
           order to assign an attribute value that contains entity references, the user must create an Attr node
           plus  any  Text and EntityReference nodes, build the appropriate subtree, and use setAttributeNode to
           assign it as the value of an attribute.

           DOMExceptions:

           •   INVALID_CHARACTER_ERR

               Raised if the specified name contains an invalid character.

           •   NO_MODIFICATION_ALLOWED_ERR

               Raised if this node is readonly.

       removeAttribute (name)
           Removes an attribute by name. If the  removed  attribute  has  a  default  value  it  is  immediately
           replaced.

           DOMExceptions:

           •   NO_MODIFICATION_ALLOWED_ERR

               Raised if this node is readonly.

       getAttributeNode
           Retrieves an Attr node by name.

           Return Value: The Attr node with the specified attribute name or undef if there is no such attribute.

       setAttributeNode (attr)
           Adds  a  new  attribute.  If  an  attribute  with  that name is already present in the element, it is
           replaced by the new one.

           Return Value: If the newAttr attribute replaces  an  existing  attribute  with  the  same  name,  the
           previously existing Attr node is returned, otherwise undef is returned.

           DOMExceptions:

           •   WRONG_DOCUMENT_ERR

               Raised if newAttr was created from a different document than the one that created the element.

           •   NO_MODIFICATION_ALLOWED_ERR

               Raised if this node is readonly.

           •   INUSE_ATTRIBUTE_ERR

               Raised if newAttr is already an attribute of another Element object. The DOM user must explicitly
               clone Attr nodes to re-use them in other elements.

       removeAttributeNode (oldAttr)
           Removes  the specified attribute. If the removed Attr has a default value it is immediately replaced.
           If the Attr already is the default value, nothing happens and nothing is returned.

           Parameters:
            <u>oldAttr</u>  The Attr node to remove from the attribute list.

           Return Value: The Attr node that was removed.

           DOMExceptions:

           •   NO_MODIFICATION_ALLOWED_ERR

               Raised if this node is readonly.

           •   NOT_FOUND_ERR

               Raised if oldAttr is not an attribute of the element.

   <b>Additional</b> <b>methods</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>DOM</b> <b>Spec</b>
       setTagName (newTagName)
           Sets the tag name of the Element. Note that this method is not portable between DOM implementations.

           DOMExceptions:

           •   INVALID_CHARACTER_ERR

               Raised if the specified name contains an invalid character.

       check ($checker)
           Uses the specified XML::Checker to validate the document.  NOTE: an XML::Checker  must  be  supplied.
           The  checker can be created in different ways, e.g. when parsing a document with XML::DOM::ValParser,
           or with <b>XML::DOM::Document::createChecker()</b>.  See XML::Checker for more info.
