</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       XML::Easy::Element - abstract form of XML element

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use XML::Easy::Element;

           $element = XML::Easy::Element-&gt;new("a", { href =&gt; "#there" },
                       $content);

           $type_name = $element-&gt;type_name;
           $attributes = $element-&gt;attributes;
           $href = $element-&gt;attribute("href");
           $content = $element-&gt;content_object;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       An object of this class represents an XML element, a node in the tree making up an XML document.  This is
       in an abstract form, intended for general manipulation.  It is completely isolated from the textual
       representation of XML, and holds only the meaningful content of the element.  The data in an element
       object cannot be modified: different data requires the creation of a new object.

       The properties of an XML element are of three kinds.  Firstly, the element has exactly one type, which is
       referred to by a name.  Secondly, the element has a set of zero or more attributes.  Each attribute
       consists of a name, which is unique among the attributes of the element, and a value, which is a string
       of characters.  Finally, the element has content, which is a sequence of zero or more characters and
       (recursively) elements, interspersed in any fashion.

       The element type name and attribute names all follow the XML syntax for names.  This allows the use of a
       wide set of Unicode characters, with some restrictions.  Attribute values and character content can use
       almost all Unicode characters, with only a few characters (such as most of the ASCII control characters)
       prohibited by the specification from being directly represented in XML.

       This class is not meant to be subclassed.  XML elements are unextendable, dumb data.  Element objects are
       better processed using the functions in XML::Easy::NodeBasics than using the methods of this class.

</pre><h4><b>CONSTRUCTOR</b></h4><pre>
       XML::Easy::Element-&gt;new(TYPE_NAME, ATTRIBUTES, CONTENT)
           Constructs  and  returns  a  new  element  object with the specified properties.  <u>TYPE_NAME</u> must be a
           string.  <u>ATTRIBUTES</u> must be a reference to a hash in the same form that is returned by  the  accessor
           method "attributes" (below).  <u>CONTENT</u> must be a reference to either an XML::Easy::Content object or a
           twine  array  (see  "Twine" in XML::Easy::NodeBasics).  All are checked for validity, against the XML
           1.0 specification, and the function "die"s if any are invalid.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       $element-&gt;type_name
           Returns the element type name, as a string.

       $element-&gt;attributes
           Returns a reference to a hash encapsulating the element's attributes.  In the hash, each  key  is  an
           attribute name, and the corresponding value is the attribute's value as a string.

           The  returned hash must not be subsequently modified.  If possible, it will be marked as read-only in
           order to prevent modification.  As a side effect, the read-only-ness may  make  lookup  of  any  non-
           existent attribute generate an exception rather than returning "undef".

       $element-&gt;attribute(NAME)
           Looks  up a specific attribute of the element.  The supplied <u>NAME</u> must be a string containing a valid
           attribute name.  If there is an attribute by that name then its value is returned, as a  string.   If
           there is no such attribute then "undef" is returned.

       $element-&gt;content_object
           Returns a reference to an XML::Easy::Content object encapsulating the element's content.

       $element-&gt;content_twine
           Returns  a  reference  to  a twine array (see "Twine" in XML::Easy::NodeBasics) listing the element's
           content.

           The returned array must not be subsequently modified.  If possible, it will be marked as read-only in
           order to prevent modification.

       $element-&gt;content
           Deprecated alias for the "content_twine" method.
