</pre><h4><b>Name</b></h4><pre>
       App::Sqitch::ItemFormatter - Format events and changes for command output

</pre><h4><b>Synopsis</b></h4><pre>
         my $formatter = App::Sqitch::ItemFormatter-&gt;new(%params);
         say $formatter-&gt;format($format, $item);

</pre><h4><b>Description</b></h4><pre>
       This class is used by commands to format items for output. For example, "log" uses it to format the
       events it finds. It uses String::Formatter to do the actual formatting, but configures it for all the
       various times of things typically displayed, such as change names, IDs, event types, etc. This keeps
       things relatively simple, as all one needs to pass to format() is a format and then a hash reference of
       values to be used in the format.

</pre><h4><b>Interface</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Constructor</b>
       <u>"new"</u>

         my $formatter = App::Sqitch::ItemFormatter-&gt;new(%params);

       Constructs and returns a formatter object. The supported parameters are:

       "abbrev"
           Instead  of  showing the full 40-byte hexadecimal change ID, format as a partial prefix the specified
           number of characters long.

       "date_format"
           Format to use for timestamps. Defaults to "iso". Allowed values:

           "iso"
           "iso8601"
               ISO-8601 format.

           "rfc"
           "rfc2822"
               RFC-2822 format.

           "full"
           "long"
           "medium"
           "short"
               A format length to pass to the system locale's "LC_TIME" category.

           "raw"
               Raw format, which is strict ISO-8601 in the UTC time zone.

           "strftime:$string"
               An  arbitrary  "strftime"  pattern.  See  "strftime  Paterns"  in  DateTime   for   comprehensive
               documentation of supported patterns.

           "cldr:$pattern"
               An  arbitrary  "cldr"  pattern. See "CLDR Paterns" in DateTime for comprehensive documentation of
               supported patterns.

       "color"
           Controls the use of ANSI color formatting. The value may be one of:

           "auto" (the default)
           "always"
           "never"
       "formatter"
           A String::Formatter object. You probably don't want  to  pass  one  of  these,  as  the  default  one
           understands all the values to that Sqitch is likely to want to format.

   <b>Instance</b> <b>Methods</b>
       <u>"format"</u>

         $formatter-&gt;format( $format, $item );

       Formats  an  item  as  a  string and returns it. The item will be formatted using the first argument. See
       "Formats" for the gory details.

       The second argument is a hash reference defining the item to be formatted.  These  are  simple  key/value
       pairs, generally identifying attribute names and values. The supported keys are:

       "event"
           The type of event, which is one of:

           "deploy"
           "revert"
           "fail"
       "project"
           The name of the project with which the change is associated.

       "change_id"
           The change ID.

       "change"
           The name of the change.

       "note"
           A brief description of the change.

       "tags"
           An array reference of the names of associated tags.

       "requires"
           An array reference of the names of any changes required by the change.

       "conflicts"
           An array reference of the names of any changes that conflict with the change.

       "committed_at"
           An App::Sqitch::DateTime object representing the date and time at which the event was logged.

       "committer_name"
           Name of the user who deployed the change.

       "committer_email"
           Email address of the user who deployed the change.

       "planned_at"
           An  App::Sqitch::DateTime  object representing the date and time at which the change was added to the
           plan.

       "planner_name"
           Name of the user who added the change to the plan.

       "planner_email"
           Email address of the user who added the change to the plan.

</pre><h4><b>Formats</b></h4><pre>
       The format argument to format() specifies the item information to be included in the resulting string. It
       works a little bit like "printf" format and a little like Git log format. For example, this format:

         format:The committer of %h was %{name}c%vThe title was &gt;&gt;%s&lt;&lt;%v

       Would show something like this:

         The committer of f26a3s was Tom Lane
         The title was &gt;&gt;We really need to get this right.&lt;&lt;

       The placeholders are:
