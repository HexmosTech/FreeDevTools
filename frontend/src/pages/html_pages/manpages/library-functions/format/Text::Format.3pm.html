</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>format</b> routine will format under all circumstances even if the width isn't enough to contain the
       longest words.  <u>Text::Wrap</u> will die under these circumstances, although I am told this is fixed.  If
       columns is set to a small number and words are longer than that and the leading 'whitespace' than there
       will be a single word on each line.  This will let you make a simple word list which could be indented or
       right aligned.  There is a chance for croaking if you try to subvert the module.  If you don't pass in
       text then the internal text is worked on, though not modified.

       <u>Text::Format</u> is meant for more powerful text formatting than what <u>Text::Wrap</u> allows.  I also have a
       module called <u>Text::NWrap</u> that is meant as a direct replacement for <u>Text::Wrap</u>.  <u>Text::NWrap</u> requires
       <u>Text::Format</u> since it uses <u>Text::Format-&gt;format</u> to do the actual wrapping but gives you the interface of
       <u>Text::Wrap</u>.

       General setup should be explained with the below graph.

                                  columns
       &lt;------------------------------------------------------------&gt;
       &lt;----------&gt;&lt;------&gt;&lt;---------------------------&gt;&lt;-----------&gt;
        leftMargin  indent  text is formatted into here  rightMargin

       indent is firstIndent or bodyIndent depending on where we are in the paragraph.

       <b>format</b> @ARRAY || \@ARRAY || [&lt;FILEHANDLE&gt;] || NOTHING
           Allows  one  to  do some advanced formatting of text into a paragraph, with indent for first line and
           body set separately.  Can specify total width of text, right fill  with  spaces  or  right  align  or
           justify  (align to both margins), right margin and left margin, non-breaking space, two spaces at end
           of sentence, hanging indents (tagged paragraphs).  Strips all leading and trailing whitespace  before
           proceeding.   Text  is first split into words and then reassembled.  If no text is passed in then the
           internal text in the object is formatted.

       <b>paragraphs</b> @ARRAY || \@ARRAY || [&lt;FILEHANDLE&gt;] || NOTHING
           Considers each element of text as a paragraph and if the indents are the same for first line and  the
           body  then  the  paragraphs  are separated by a single empty line otherwise they follow one under the
           other.  If hanging indent is set then a single empty line  will  separate  each  paragraph  as  well.
           Calls  <u>format</u>  to  do  the  actual formatting.  If no text is passed in then the internal text in the
           object is formatted, though not changed.

       <b>center</b> @ARRAY || NOTHING
           Centers a list of strings in @ARRAY or internal text.  Empty lines appear as, you guessed  it,  empty
           lines.   Center  strips all leading and trailing whitespace before proceeding.  Left margin and right
           margin can be set.  If no text is passed in then the internal text in the object is formatted.

       <b>expand</b> @ARRAY || NOTHING
           Expand tabs in the list of text to tabstop number of spaces in  @ARRAY  or  internal  text.   Doesn't
           modify  the  internal  text  just  passes  back  the modified text.  If no text is passed in then the
           internal text in the object is formatted.

       <b>unexpand</b> @ARRAY || NOTHING
           Tabstop number of spaces are turned into tabs  in  @ARRAY  or  internal  text.   Doesn't  modify  the
           internal  text just passes back the modified text.  If no text is passed in then the internal text in
           the object is formatted.

       <b>new</b> \%HASH || NOTHING
           Instantiates the object.  If you pass a reference to a hash, or an anonymous hash then it is used  in
           setting attributes.

       <b>config</b> \%HASH
           Allows   the  configuration  of  all  object  attributes  at  once.   Returns  the  object  prior  to
           configuration.  You can use it to make a clone of your object before you change attributes.

       <b>columns</b> NUMBER || NOTHING
           Set width of text or retrieve width.  This is total width and includes indentation and the right  and
           left margins.

       <b>tabstop</b> NUMBER || NOTHING
           Set tabstop size or retrieve tabstop size, only used by expand, unexpand and center.

       <b>firstIndent</b> NUMBER || NOTHING
           Set or get indent for the first line of paragraph.  This is the number of spaces to indent.

       <b>bodyIndent</b> NUMBER || NOTHING
           Set or get indent for the body of paragraph.  This is the number of spaces to indent.

       <b>leftMargin</b> NUMBER || NOTHING
           Set or get width of left margin.  This is the number of spaces used for the margin.

       <b>rightMargin</b> NUMBER || NOTHING
           Set or get width of right margin.  This is the number of spaces used for the margin.

       <b>rightFill</b> 0 || 1 || NOTHING
           Set  right  fill  or  retrieve  its  value.   The  filling is done with spaces.  Keep in mind that if
           <u>rightAlign</u> is also set then both <u>rightFill</u> and <u>rightAlign</u> are ignored.

       <b>rightAlign</b> 0 || 1 || NOTHING
           Set right align or retrieve its value.  Text is aligned with the right side of the margin.   Keep  in
           mind that if <u>rightFill</u> is also set then both <u>rightFill</u> and <u>rightAlign</u> are ignored.

       <b>justify</b> 0 || 1 || NOTHING
           Set  justify  or  retrieve  its  value.   Text  is  aligned with both margins, adding extra spaces as
           necessary to align text with left and right margins.  Keep in mind that if either  of  <u>rightAlign</u>  or
           <u>rightFill</u> are set then <u>justify</u> is ignored, even if both are set in which case they are all ignored.

       <b>text</b> \@ARRAY || NOTHING
           Pass  in  a  reference  to  your  text,  or  an anonymous array of text that you want the routines to
           manipulate.  Returns the text held in the object.

       <b>hangingIndent</b> 0 || 1 || NOTHING
           Use hanging indents in front of a paragraph, returns current value of attribute.  This is also called
           a tagged paragraph.

       <b>hangingText</b> \@ARRAY || NOTHING
           The text that will be displayed in front of each paragraph, if you call <u>format</u> then  only  the  first
           element is used, if you call <u>paragraphs</u> then <u>paragraphs</u> cycles through all of them.  If you have more
           paragraphs  than  elements in your array than the remainder of the paragraphs will not have a hanging
           indented text.  Pass a reference to your array.  This is also called a tagged paragraph.

       <b>noBreak</b> 0 || 1 || NOTHING
           Set whether you want to use the non-breaking space feature (see <b>noBreakRegex</b> below).

       <b>noBreakRegex</b> \%HASH || NOTHING
           Pass in a reference to a hash that would hold the regexes on which not to break. In order for this to
           happen, it requires <b>noBreak</b> to be set to <b>true</b> - see above.  Without any  arguments,  it  returns  the
           hash. E.g:

               {'^Mrs?\.$' =&gt; '^\S+$','^\S+$' =&gt; '^(?:S|J)r\.$'}

           don't break names such as Mr. Jones, Mrs. Jones, Jones Jr.

           The  breaking  algorithm  is  simple.  If there should not be a break at the current end of sentence,
           then a backtrack is done till there are two words on which breaking is allowed.  If no two such words
           are found then the end of sentence is broken anyhow.  If there is a single word on current line  then
           no  backtrack  is done and the word is stuck on the end.  This is so you can make a list of names for
           example.

           <b>Note</b>: this feature requires <b>noBreak</b> to be set to true.

       <b>extraSpace</b> 0 || 1 || NOTHING
           Add extra space after end of sentence, normally <u>format</u> would add 1 space after end  of  sentence,  if
           this  is set to 1 then 2 spaces are used.  Abbreviations are not followed by two spaces.  There are a
           few internal abbreviations and you can add your own to the object with <u>abbrevs</u>

       <b>abbrevs</b> \%HASH || @ARRAY || NOTHING
           Add to the current abbreviations, takes a reference to your hash or an  array  of  abbreviations,  if
           called  a  second  time  the  original reference is removed and replaced by the new one.  Returns the
           current INTERNAL abbreviations.

           print $text-&gt;format("a line to format to an indented regular
                   paragraph using 65 character wide display");
           print $text-&gt;paragraphs("paragraph one","paragraph two");

           print $text-&gt;format([&lt;FILEHANDLE&gt;]);
           print $text-&gt;format([$fh-&gt;getlines()]);
           print $text-&gt;paragraphs([&lt;FILEHANDLE&gt;]);
           print $text-&gt;expand(@text);
           print $text-&gt;unexpand(@text);

           $text = Text::Format-&gt;new
               ({tabstop =&gt; 4,bodyIndent =&gt; 4,text =&gt; \@text});

           print $text-&gt;format();
           print $text-&gt;paragraphs();
           print $text-&gt;center();
           print $text-&gt;expand();
           print $text-&gt;unexpand();

           print Text::Format-&gt;new({columns =&gt; 95})-&gt;format(@text);

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Line length can exceed the number of specified columns if columns is set to a small number and long words
       plus leading whitespace exceed the specified column length.  Actually I see this as a  feature  since  it
       can be used to make up a nice word list.
