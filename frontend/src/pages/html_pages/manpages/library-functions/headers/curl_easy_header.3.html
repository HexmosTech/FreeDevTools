       curl_easy_header - get an HTTP header

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;curl/curl.h&gt;

       CURLHcode curl_easy_header(CURL *easy,
                                  const char *name,
                                  size_t index,
                                  unsigned int origin,
                                  int request,
                                  struct curl_header **hout);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u><a href="../man3/curl_easy_header.3.html">curl_easy_header</a>(3)</u>  returns  a pointer to a "curl_header" struct in <b>hout</b> with data for the HTTP response
       header <u>name</u>. The case insensitive null-terminated header name should be specified without colon.

       <u>index</u> 0 means asking for the first instance of the header. If the returned header struct has  <b>amount</b>  set
       larger  than  1, it means there are more instances of the same header name available to get. Asking for a
       too big index makes <b>CURLHE_BADINDEX</b> get returned.

       The <u>origin</u> argument is for specifying which headers to receive, as a single HTTP transfer  might  provide
       headers from several different places and they may then have different importance to the user and headers
       using  the  same  name  might  be used. The <u>origin</u> is a bitmask for what header sources you want. See the
       descriptions below.

       The <u>request</u> argument tells libcurl from which request you want headers  from.  A  single  transfer  might
       consist  of  a  series  of  HTTP  requests and this argument lets you specify which particular individual
       request you want the headers from. 0 being the first request and then the number  increases  for  further
       redirects  or  when multi-state authentication is used. Passing in -1 is a shortcut to "the last" request
       in the series, independently of the actual amount of requests used.

       libcurl stores and provides the actually used "correct" headers. If for example two headers with the same
       name arrive and the latter overrides the former, then only the latter is provided. If  the  first  header
       survives  the second, then only the first one is provided. An application using this API does not have to
       bother about multiple headers used wrongly.

       The memory for the  returned  struct  is  associated  with  the  easy  handle  and  subsequent  calls  to
       <u><a href="../man3/curl_easy_header.3.html">curl_easy_header</a>(3)</u>  clobber  the  struct  used  in  the  previous  calls  for  the same easy handle. The
       application needs to copy the data if it wants to keep it around. The memory used  for  the  struct  gets
       freed with calling <u><a href="../man3/curl_easy_cleanup.3.html">curl_easy_cleanup</a>(3)</u> of the easy handle.

       The  first  line  in  an  HTTP  response is called the status line. It is not considered a header by this
       function. Headers are the "name: value" lines following the status.

       This function can be used before (all) headers have been received and is fine to call from within libcurl
       callbacks. It returns the state of the headers at the time it is called.

</pre><h4><b>The</b> <b>header</b> <b>struct</b></h4><pre>
       struct curl_header {
          char *name;
          char *value;
          size_t amount;
          size_t index;
          unsigned int origin;
          void *anchor;
       };

       The data <b>name</b> field points to, is the same as the requested name, but might have a different case.

       The data <b>value</b> field points to, comes exactly as delivered over the network but with leading and trailing
       whitespace and newlines stripped off. The <u>value</u>  data  is  null-terminated.  For  legacy  HTTP/1  "folded
       headers",  this API provides the full single value in an unfolded manner with a single whitespace between
       the lines.

       <b>amount</b> is how many headers using this name that exist, within the origin and request scope asked for.

       <b>index</b> is the zero based entry number of this particular header, which in case this header was  used  more
       than once in the requested scope can be larger than 0 but is always less than <b>amount</b>.

       The  <b>origin</b>  field  in the "curl_header" struct has one of the origin bits set, indicating where from the
       header originates. At the time of this writing, there are 5 bits with defined use.  The  undocumented  27
       remaining bits are reserved for future use and must not be assumed to have any particular value.

       <b>anchor</b> is a private handle used by libcurl internals. Do not modify.

</pre><h4><b>ORIGINS</b></h4><pre>
       CURLH_HEADER
              The header arrived as a header from the server.

       CURLH_TRAILER
              The header arrived as a trailer. A header that arrives after the body.

       CURLH_CONNECT
              The  header  arrived  in  a  CONNECT response. A CONNECT request is being done to setup a transfer
              "through" an HTTP(S) proxy.

       CURLH_1XX
              The header arrived in an HTTP 1xx response. A 1xx response  is  an  "intermediate"  response  that
              might happen before the "real" response.

       CURLH_PSEUDO
              The header is an HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 pseudo header

</pre><h4><b>PROTOCOLS</b></h4><pre>
       This functionality affects http only

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       int main(void)
       {
         struct curl_header *type;
         CURL *curl = curl_easy_init();
         if(curl) {
           CURLHcode h;
           curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "https://example.com");
           curl_easy_perform(curl);
           h = curl_easy_header(curl, "Content-Type", 0, CURLH_HEADER, -1, &amp;type);
           curl_easy_cleanup(curl);
         }
       }

</pre><h4><b>AVAILABILITY</b></h4><pre>
       Added in curl 7.83.0

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       This  function  returns  a  CURLHcode indicating success or error. CURLHE_OK (0) means everything was OK,
       non-zero means an error occurred, see <u><a href="../man3/libcurl-errors.3.html">libcurl-errors</a>(3)</u>.
