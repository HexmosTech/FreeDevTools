</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The Lingua::EN::Inflect is an interface to Damian Conway's Linua::EN::Inflect Perl module, which provides
       plural inflections, "a"/"an" selection for English words, and manipulation of numbers as words.

       The plugin provides an 'inflect' filter, which can be used to interpolate inflections in a string.  The
       <b>NUM()</b> function sets a persistent default value to be used whenever an optional number argument is
       omitted.  The number to be used for a particular invocation of 'inflect' can also be specified with a
       'number' option.

       For the full gory details of the inflection functionality refer to the Lingua::EN::Inflect manual.

</pre><h4><b>OBJECT</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       "infl.A($string, $opt_number)"
           prepends the appropriate indefinite article to a word, depending on its pronunciation.  If the second
           argument is provided and its value is numeric and not 1 then the value of the second argument is used
           instead.

           e.g. "infl.A("idea")" returns "an idea"

       "AN($string, $opt_number)"
           synonym for "A()"

       "NO($string, $opt_arg)"
           given a word and an optional count, returns the count followed by the correctly inflected word

       "NUM($string, $opt_arg)"
           sets a persistent <u>default</u> <u>number</u> value, which is subsequently used whenever an optional second <u>number</u>
           argument  is omitted.  The default value thus set can subsequently be removed by calling "NUM()" with
           no arguments.  "NUM()" normally returns its first argument, however  if  "NUM()"  is  called  with  a
           second argument that is defined and evaluates to false then "NUM()" returns an empty string.

       "NUMWORDS($string, $opt_arg)"
           takes  a  number  (cardinal  or ordinal) and returns an English represen- tation of that number. In a
           scalar context a string is returned. In a list context each comma-separated chunk is  returned  as  a
           separate element.

       "ORD($number)"
           takes a single argument and forms its ordinal equivalent.  If the argument isn't a numerical integer,
           it just adds "-th".

       "PART_PRES($string, $opt_arg)"
           returns the present participle for a third person singluar verb

               PART_PRES("runs");          # returns "running"

       "PL($string, $opt_arg)"
           returns the plural of a <u>singular</u> English noun, pronoun, verb or adjective.

       "PL_N($string, $opt_arg)"
           returns the plural of a <u>singular</u> English noun or pronoun.

       "PL_V($string, $opt_arg)"
           returns the plural conjugation of the <u>singular</u> form of a conjugated verb.

       "PL_ADJ($string, $opt_arg)"
           returns the plural form of a <u>singular</u> form of certain types of adjectives.

       "PL_eq($string, $opt_arg)"
       "PL_N_eq($string, $opt_arg)"
       "PL_V_eq($string, $opt_arg)"
       "PL_ADJ_eq($string, $opt_arg)"
       "classical($string, $opt_arg)"
       "def_noun($string, $opt_arg)"
       "def_verb($string, $opt_arg)"
       "def_adj($string, $opt_arg)"
       "def_a($string, $opt_arg)"
       "def_an($string, $opt_arg)"

</pre><h4><b>INTERNAL</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       "tt_inflect($string, $opt_arg)"
           The underlying inflect filter.

</pre><h4><b>TODO</b></h4><pre>
       Finish off documenting the object methods.

       Provide tests for all methods in the test suite.

       It  would  also  be nice to have methods that spelled out numbers that were less than a certain threshold
       and that formatted large numbers with commas, for example:

            inflect("There PL_V(was) NO(error).", number =&gt; 0);
            # outputs: "There were no errors."

            inflect("There PL_V(was) NO(error).", number =&gt; 1);
            # outputs: "There was one errors."

            inflect("There PL_V(was) NO(error).", number =&gt; 3);
            # outputs: "There were three errors."

            inflect("There PL_V(was) NO(error).", number =&gt; 1042);
            # outputs: "There were 1,042 errors."

       This would require changes to the Lingua::EN::Inflect module.

</pre><h4><b>DEDICATION</b></h4><pre>
       This distribution was originally created by Andrew Ford. Sadly in early 2014, Andrew was  diagnosed  with
       Pancreatic Cancer and passed away peacfully at home on 25th April 2014.

       One  of  his  wishes  was for his OpenSource work to continue. At his funeral, many of his colleagues and
       friends, spoke of how he felt like a person of the world, and how he embrace the idea of OpenSource being
       for the benefit of the world.

       Anyone wishing to donate in memory of Andrew, please consider the following charities:
