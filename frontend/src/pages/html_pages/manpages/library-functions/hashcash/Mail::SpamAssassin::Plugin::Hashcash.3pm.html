       Mail::SpamAssassin::Plugin::Hashcash - perform hashcash verification tests

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         loadplugin     Mail::SpamAssassin::Plugin::Hashcash

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Hashcash is a payment system for email where CPU cycles used as the basis for an e-cash system.  This
       plugin makes it possible to use valid hashcash tokens added by mail programs as a bonus for messages.

</pre><h4><b>USER</b> <b>SETTINGS</b></h4><pre>
       use_hashcash { 1 | 0 }   (default: 1)
           Whether to use hashcash, if it is available.

       hashcash_accept <a href="mailto:user@example.com">user@example.com</a> ...
           Used  to  specify  addresses  that we accept HashCash tokens for.  You should set it to match all the
           addresses that you may receive mail at.

           Like  whitelist  and  blacklist   entries,   the   addresses   are   file-glob-style   patterns,   so
           "<a href="mailto:friend@somewhere.com">friend@somewhere.com</a>",  "*@isp.com", or "*.domain.net" will all work.  Specifically, "*" and "?" are
           allowed, but all other metacharacters are  not.   Regular  expressions  are  not  used  for  security
           reasons.

           The  sequence %u is replaced with the current user's username, which is useful for ISPs or multi-user
           domains.

           Multiple addresses per line, separated by spaces, is OK.  Multiple "hashcash_accept"  lines  is  also
           OK.

       hashcash_doublespend_path /path/to/file   (default: <a href="file:~/.spamassassin/hashcash_seen">~/.spamassassin/hashcash_seen</a>)
           Path  for  HashCash  double-spend  database.   HashCash  tokens are only usable once, so their use is
           tracked in this database to avoid providing a loophole.

           By default, each user has their own, in their "<a href="file:~/.spamassassin">~/.spamassassin</a>" directory with mode 0700/0600.   Note
           that  once  a  token  is  'spent' it is written to this file, and double-spending of a hashcash token
           makes it invalid, so this is not suitable for sharing between multiple users.

       hashcash_doublespend_file_mode            (default: 0700)
           The file mode bits used for the HashCash double-spend database file.

           Make sure you specify this using the 'x' mode bits set, as it may also be used to create directories.
           However, if a file is created, the resulting file will not have any execute bits set  (the  umask  is
           set to 111).
