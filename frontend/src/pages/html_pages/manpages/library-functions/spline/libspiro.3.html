</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       libspiro - A clothoid to bezier spline converter

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;spiroentrypoints.h&gt;</b> and then compile and link with <b>-lspiro</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Spiro</b> library for curve design which simplifies drawing of beautiful curves.

       <b>libspiro</b>  takes  an array of spiro control points which can be easier for an artist to create and modify,
       and then converts these into a series of bezier splines which can then be used in the myriad of ways  the
       world has come to use beziers.

       <u>spiroentrypoints.h</u>  has technical information on how to connect with <u>libspiro</u> and further information and
       example code can be found at <u><a href="http://github.com/fontforge/libspiro">http://github.com/fontforge/libspiro</a></u>

</pre><h4><b>REPORTING</b> <b>PROBLEMS</b></h4><pre>
       Before reporting a problem, please check the libspiro web site to verify that you have the latest version
       of <u>libspiro</u>

       Great care was taken to maintain  backwards  compatibility  so  it  is  recommended  to  upgrade  if  you
       experience problems with earlier <u>libspiro</u> versions.

</pre><h4><b>LIBSPIRO</b> <b>LICENSE</b></h4><pre>
       <b>libspiro</b>  originated  from spiro code (in 2007) found in <b>ppedit</b> which is a pattern plate editor for Spiro
       splines.  <b>ppedit</b> was/is Copyright (C) 2007 Raph Levien. GNU GPL version 2 or higher.   <b>ppedit</b>  was  later
       relicensed  also  as  Apache-2  MIT  code  in May of 2019.  This relicensing is fine since all <b>ppedit</b> was
       written by Raph Levien in 2007. Copyright allows for this.  Unfortunately, this  re-licensing  of  <b>ppedit</b>
       has  caused  some confusion in assuming that this relicensing also applies to <b>libspiro</b> which is not valid
       and does not apply.

       <b>libspiro</b> was based on <b>ppedit</b> spiro code from 2007 (which was GNU GPL2 version 2 or higher) and built into
       a usable library at <u><a href="http://libspiro.sourceforge.net/">http://libspiro.sourceforge.net/</a></u> Copyright (C) 2007 George Williams. GNU GPL  version
       2 or higher.  This license also applies to the included Java files which have been forked into javascript
       and typeset files seen elsewhere.

       <b>libspiro</b>  was  later  picked  up  in  2013  and  continued  with  further development and improvements at
       <u><a href="http://github.com/fontforge/libspiro">http://github.com/fontforge/libspiro</a></u>

       <b>libspiro</b> is now Copyright (C) 2013... as GNU GPL version 3 or higher.
