</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       MySQL::Sandbox - Quickly installs one or more MySQL servers in the same host, either standalone or in
       groups

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        make_sandbox /path/to/MySQL-VERSION.tar.gz

        export SANDBOX_BINARY=$HOME/opt/mysql
        make_sandbox --export_binaries /path/to/MySQL-VERSION.tar.gz

        make_sandbox $SANDBOX_BINARY/VERSION

        make_sandbox VERSION

</pre><h4><b>PURPOSE</b></h4><pre>
       This package is a sandbox for testing features under any version of MySQL from 3.23 to 5.x (and MariaDB
       10).

       It will install one node under your home directory, and it will provide some useful commands to start,
       use and stop this sandbox.

       With this package you can play with new MySQL releases without need of using other computers. The server
       installed in the sandbox use non-standard data directory, ports and sockets, so they won't interfere with
       existing MYSQL installations.

</pre><h4><b>INSTALLATION</b></h4><pre>
       MySQL Sandbox installs as a normal Perl Module. Since its purpose is to install side servers in user
       space, you can install it as root (default) or as an unprivileged user. In this case, you need to set the
       PERL5LIB and PATH variables.

          # as root
          perl Makefile.PL
          make
          make test
          make install

          # as normal user
          export PATH=$HOME/usr/local/bin:$PATH
          export PERL5LIB=$HOME/usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl/x.x.x
          perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=$HOME/usr/local
          make
          make test
          make install

       Notice that PERL5LIB could be different in various operating systems. If you opt for this installation
       method, you must adapt it to your operating system path and Perl version.

       See also under "TESTING" for more options before running 'make test'

</pre><h4><b>MAKING</b> <b>SANDBOXES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Single</b> <b>server</b> <b>sandbox</b>
       The easiest way to make a sandbox is

       1. download the sandbox package and install it as instructed above

       2. download a MySQL binary tarball

       3. run this command

             $ make_sandbox  /path/to/mysql-X.X.XX-osinfo.tar.gz

       That's  all it takes to get started. The Sandbox will ask you for confirmation, and then it will tell you
       where it has installed your server.

       By default, the sandbox creates a new instance for you under

          $SANDBOX_HOME/msb_X_X_XX

   <b>Making</b> <b>a</b> <b>replication</b> <b>sandbox</b>
       It's as easy as making a single sandbox

          $ make_replication_sandbox /path/to/mysql-X.X.XX-osinfo.tar.gz

       This will create a new instance of one master  and two slaves

          under $SANDBOX_HOME/rsandbox_X_X_XX

   <b>Circular</b> <b>replication</b>
       It requires an appropriate option when you start a replication sandbox

          $ make_replication_sandbox --circular=4 /path/to/mysql-X.X.XX-osinfo.tar.gz

       This will create a replication system with three servers connected  by  circular  replication.   A  handy
       shortcut is "--master_master", which will create a circular replication system of exactly two members.

   <b>Multiple</b> <b>sandboxes</b>
       You can create a group of sandboxes without any replication among its members.  If you need three servers
       of the same version, you can use

        $ make_multiple_sandbox /path/to/tarball

       If you need servers of different versions in the same group, you may like

        $ make_multiple_custom_sandbox /path/to/tarball1 path/to/tarball2 /path/to/tb3

       Assuming that each tarball is from a different version, you will group three servers under one directory,
       with the handy sandbox scripts to manipulate them.

   <b>Creating</b> <b>a</b> <b>sandbox</b> <b>from</b> <b>source</b>
       If you want to create a sandbox from the code that you have just compiled, but you don't want to install,
       there is a script that makesa binary tarball for you and installs a sandbox in one go.

        $ make_sandbox_from_source {SOURCE_DIRECTORY} {sandbox_type} [options]

       The  first parameters is the directory where you have successfully run "./configure &amp;&amp; make".  The second
       parameter is what kind of sandbox you want to create: One of the following:

         * single
         * multiple
         * replication
         * circular

       You can then add all the options you need at the end.  For example:

        $ make_sandbox_from_source $HOME/build/5.0 single --export_binaries --check_port

       or

        $ make_sandbox_from_source $HOME/build/5.0 replication --how_many_slaves=5

       If you call this program several times from the same directory, it will check if  the  compiled  binaries
       are newer than the extracted ones, and if they aren't, it will reuse the ones created during the previous
       run, thus saving time and CPU.

   <b>Creating</b> <b>a</b> <b>sandbox</b> <b>from</b> <b>already</b> <b>installed</b> <b>binaries</b>
       The  script  "make_sandbox_from_installed"  tries  to  create a sandbox using already installed binaries.
       Since these binaries can be in several different places, the script creates  a  container  with  symbolic
       links, where the binaries (their links, actually) are arranged as MySQL Sandbox expects them to be.

       To  use  this version, change directory to a place where you want to store this symbolic links container,
       and invoke

         make_sandbox_from_installed X.X.XX [options]

       where X.X.XX is the version number. You can then pass any options accepted by make_sandbox.

   <b>Defaults</b> <b>and</b> <b>shortcuts</b>
       If you use sandboxes often, instead of pointing to a tarball you can set a directory containing  expanded
       tarballs.  By default, the sandbox looks under $HOME/opt/mysql and /opt/mysql

       The expanded tarballs must be named with the full version.  e.g.

         $HOME/opt/mysql/5.0.64
         /opt/mysql/5.1.24

       If you have such an organization, then you can invoke every sandbox script with this abridged syntax:

         make_sandbox 5.0.64
         make_replication_sandbox 5.1.25
         make_multiple_custom_sandbox 5.0.64 5.1.25

       If  you use some options frequently, it would make sense to add them to the default option file, which is
       $HOME/.msandboxrc

   <b>Fine</b> <b>tuning</b>
       Every sandbox script will give you additional information if you invoke it with the "--help" option.

       When creating a single sandbox, you can pass to the new server most any option that  can  be  used  in  a
       my.cnf file, in addition to specific sandbox options.

       Multiple  and  replication  sandboxes,  for  example,  accept a --how_many_slaves=X or --how_many_nodes=X
       option, allowing you to create very large groups.

   <b>SANDBOX</b> <b>HOME</b>
       Unless you override the defaults, sandboxes are created inside a directory that servers two purposes:

       •  further isolates the sandboxes, and keep them under easy control if you are in the habit  of  creating
          many of them;

       •  provides  a  set  of  handy  super-commands,  which  can  be  passed  to  all  the  sandboxes. Running
          "$SANDBOX_HOME/stop_all" you will stop all servers of all sandboxes,  single  or  groups,  below  that
          directory.

</pre><h4><b>USING</b> <b>A</b> <b>SANDBOX</b></h4><pre>
       Change directory to the newly created one (default: $SANDBOX_HOME/msb_VERSION for single sandboxes)

       The  sandbox directory of the instance you just created contains some handy scripts to manage your server
       easily and in isolation.

       start
       restart
       stop
          "./start", "./restart", and "./stop" do what  their  name  suggests.   "start"  and  "restart"  accept
          parameters that are eventually passed to the server. e.g.:

            ./start --skip-innodb

            ./restart --event-scheduler=disabled

       use
          "./use" calls the command line client with the appropriate parameters,

       clear
          "./clear"  stops the server and removes everything from the data directory, letting you ready to start
          from scratch.

       multiple server sandbox
          On a replication sandbox, you have the same commands, with a "_all" suffix, meaning that you propagate
          the command to all the members.  Then you have "./m" as a shortcut  to  use  the  master,  "./s1"  and
          "./s2" to access the slaves (and "s3", "s4" ... if you define more).

          In  group  sandboxes without a master slave relationship (circular replication and multiple sandboxes)
          the nodes can be accessed by ./n1, ./n2, ./n3, and so on.

          start_all
          restart_all
          stop_all
          use_all
          clear_all
          m
          s1,s2

   <b>Database</b> <b>users</b>
       There are 2 database users installed by default:

        +-----------------+-------------+-------------------------------+
        |  user name      | password    | privileges                    |
        +-----------------+-------------+-------------------------------+
        |  root@localhost | msandbox    | all on *.* with grant option  |
        |  msandbox@%     | msandbox    | all on *.*                    |
        |  rsandbox@127.% | rsandbox    | REPLICATION SLAVE             |
        |                 |             | (only replication sandboxes)  |
        +-----------------+-------------+-------------------------------+

   <b>Ports</b> <b>and</b> <b>sockets</b>
       Ports are created from the server version.  a 5.1.25 server will use port 5125, unless you  override  the
       default.  Replicated and group sandboxes add a delta number to the version figure, to avoid clashing with
       single installations.

       (note: ports can be overridden using -P option during install)

        +--------+-----------------------------+
        | port   | socket                      |
        +--------+-----------------------------+
        |  3310  | /tmp/mysql_sandbox3310.sock |
        +--------+-----------------------------+

   <b>Searching</b> <b>for</b> <b>free</b> <b>ports</b>
       MySQL  Sandbox uses a fairly reasonable system of default ports that guarantees the usage of unused ports
       most of the times.  If you are creating many sandbozes, however, especially if you want several sandboxes
       using the same versions, collisions may happen.  In these cases, you may ask  for  a  port  check  before
       installing, thus making sure that your sandbox is really not conflicting with anything.

       <u>Single</u> <u>sandbox</u> <u>port</u> <u>checking</u>

       The  default  behavior  when asking to install a sandbox over an existing one is to abort. If you specify
       the "--force" option, the old sandbox will be saved as 'old_data' and a new one created.  Instead,  using
       the  "--check_port"  option,  MySQL Sandbox searches for the first available unused port, and uses it. It
       will also create a non conflicting data directory. For example

        make_sandbox 5.0.79
        # creates a sandbox with port 5079 under $SANDBOX_HOME/msb_5_0_79

       A further call to the same command will be aborted unless you specify either "--force" or "--check_port".

        make_sandbox 5.0.79 -- --force
        # Creates a sandbox with port 5079 under $SANDBOX_HOME/msb_5_0_79
        # The contents of the previous data directory are saved as 'old_data'.

        make_sandbox 5.0.79 -- --check_port
        # Creates a sandbox with port 5080 under $SANDBOX_HOME/msb_5_0_79_a

        make_sandbox 5.0.79 -- --check_port
        # Creates a sandbox with port 5081 under $SANDBOX_HOME/msb_5_0_79_b

       Notice that this option is disabled when you use a group sandbox (replication or multiple). Even  if  you
       set  NODE_OPTIONS=--check_port,  it  won't be used, because every group sandbox invokes make_sandbox with
       the --no_check_port option.

       <u>Multiple</u> <u>sandbox</u> <u>port</u> <u>checking</u>

       When    you    create    a    multiple    sandbox    (make_replication_sandbox,    make_multiple_sandbox,
       make_multiple_custom_sandbox)  the  default  behavior is to overwrite the existing sandbox without asking
       for confirmation.  The rationale is that a multiple sandbox is definitely more likely  to  be  a  created
       only for testing purposes, and overwriting it should not be a problem.  If you want to avoid overwriting,
       you can specify a different group name ("--replication_directory" "--group_directory"), but this will use
       the same base port number, unless you specify "--check_base_port".

        make_replication_sandbox 5.0.79
        # Creates a replication directory under $SANDBOX_HOME/rsandbox_5_0_79
        # The default base_port is 7000

        make_replication_sandbox 5.0.79
        # Creates a replication directory under $SANDBOX_HOME/rsandbox_5_0_79
        # overwriting the previous one. The default base port is still 7000

        # WRONG
        make_replication_sandbox --check_base_port 5.0.79
        # Creates a replication directory under $SANDBOX_HOME/rsandbox_5_0_79
        # overwriting the previous one.

        # WRONG
        make_replication_sandbox --replication_directory=newdir 5.0.79
        # Created a replication directory under $SANDBOX_HOME/newdir.
        # The previous one is preserved, but the new sandbox does not start
        # because of port conflict.

        # RIGHT
        make_replication_sandbox --replication_directory=newwdir \
           --check_base_port 5.0.79
        # Creates a replication directory under $SANDBOX_HOME/newdir
        # The previous one is preserved. No conflicts happen

   <b>Environment</b> <b>variables</b>
       All programs in the Sandbox suite recognize and use the following variables:

        * HOME the user's home directory; ($HOME)
        * SANDBOX_HOME the place where the sandboxes are going to be built.
          ($HOME/sandboxes by default)
        * USER the operating system user;
        * PATH the execution path;
        * if SBDEBUG if set, the programs will print debugging messages

       In addition to the above, make_sandbox will use
        * SANDBOX_BINARY or BINARY_BASE
          the directory containing the installation server binaries
          (default: $HOME/opt/mysql)

       make_replication_sandbox will recognize the following
          * MASTER_OPTIONS additional options to be passed to the master
          * SLAVE_OPTIONS additional options to be passed to each slave
          * NODE_OPTIONS additional options to be passed to each node

       The latter is also recognized by make_multiple_custom_sandbox and make_multiple_sandbox

       The test suite, "test_sandbox", recognizes two environment variables

        * TEST_SANDBOX_HOME, which sets the path where the sandboxes are
          installed, if the default $HOME/test_sb is not suitable. It is used
          when you test the package with 'make test'
        * PRESERVE_TESTS. If set, this variable prevents the removal of test
          sandboxes created by test_sandbox. It is useful to inspect sandboxes
          if a test fails.

   <b>msb</b> <b>-</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sandbox</b> <b>shortcut</b>
       When you have many sandboxes, even the simple exercise of typing the path to the appropriate 'use' script
       can be tedious and seemingly slow.

       If  saving a few keystrokes is important, you may consider using "msb", the sandbox shortcut.  You invoke
       'msb' with a version number, without dots or underscores. The  shortcut  script  will  try  its  best  at
       finding the right directory.

         $ msb 5135
         # same as calling
         # $SANDBOX_HOME/msb_5_1_35/use

       Every option that you use after the version is passed to the 'use' script.

         $ msb 5135 -e "SELECT VERSION()"
         # same as calling
         # $SANDBOX_HOME/msb_5_1_35/use -e "SELECT VERSION()"

       Prepending  a  "r"  to the version number indicates a replication sandbox. If the directory is found, the
       script will call the master.

         $ msb r5135
         # same as calling
         # $SANDBOX_HOME/rsandbox_5_1_35/m

       To use a slave, use the corresponding number immediately after the version.

         $ msb r5135 2
         # same as calling
         # $SANDBOX_HOME/rsandbox_5_1_35/s2

       Options for the destination script are added after the node indication.

         $ msb r5135 2 -e "SELECT 1"
         # same as calling
         # $SANDBOX_HOME/rsandbox_5_1_35/s2 -e "SELECT 1"

       Similar to replication, you can call multiple sandboxes, using an 'm' before the version number.

         $ msb m5135
         # same as calling
         # $SANDBOX_HOME/multi_msb_5_1_35/n1

         $ msb m5135 2
         # same as calling
         # $SANDBOX_HOME/multi_msb_5_1_35/n2

       If your sandbox has a non-standard name and you pass such name instead of  a  version,  the  script  will
       attempt to open a single sandbox with that name.

         $ msb testSB
         # same as calling
         # $SANDBOX_HOME/testSB/use

       If the identified sandbox is not active, the script will attempt to start it.

       This  shortcut  script  doesn't  deal  with  any  sandbox  script other than the ones listed in the above
       examples.

       But the msb can do even more. If you invoke it with a dotted version number,  the  script  will  run  the
       appropriate make*sandbox script and then use the sandbox itself.

         $ msb 5.1.35
         # same as calling
         # make_sandbox 5.1.35 -- --no_confirm
         # and then
         # $SANDBOX_HOME/msb_5_1_35/use

       It works for group sandboxes as well.

         $ msb r5.1.35
         # same as calling
         # make_replication_sandbox 5.1.35
         # and then
         # $SANDBOX_HOME/rsandbox_5_1_35/m

       And finally, it also does What You Expect when using a tarball instead of a version.

         $ msb mysql-5.1.35-YOUR_OS.tar.gz
         # creates and uses a single sandbox from this tarball

         $ msb r mysql-5.1.35-YOUR_OS.tar.gz
         # creates and uses a replication sandbox from this tarball

         $ msb m mysql-5.1.35-YOUR_OS.tar.gz
         # creates and uses a multiple sandbox from this tarball

       Using a MySQL server has never been easier.

</pre><h4><b>Custom</b> <b>commands</b> <b>during</b> <b>installation</b></h4><pre>
       Starting  with  version  3.1.07  the installation of each sandbox supports the execution of shell and SQL
       commands during the installation.  You can use the following commands:

           ## SQL statements
           * --pre_grants_sql=query : runs 'query' before loading the grants.
           * --pre_grants_file=filename : runs SQL file 'filename' before loading the grants.
           * --post_grants_sql=query : runs 'query' after the loading the grants.
           * --post_grants_file=filename : runs SQL file 'filename' before loading the grants.
           * --load_plugin=plugin[:plugin_file_name] : loads the given plugin

       The output of the SQL commands is sent to standard output.  If the option --no_show  was  selected,  then
       the  the  client  is  called without options. If --no_show was not selected (default), then the client is
       called with -t -v, so that the output is shown in table format.

           ## Shell commands
           * --pre_start_exec=command  : runs 'command' after the installation, before the server starts
           * --pre_grants_exec=command : runs 'command' after the server starts, before loading the grants.
           * --post_grants_exec=command : runs 'command' after the loading the grants.

       For each shell call, the following variables are filled:

               SANDBOX_DIR   =  sandbox directory;
               BASEDIR       =  base directory for the sandbox binaries
               DB_DATADIR    =  data directory
               MY_CNF        =  configuration file
               DB_PORT       =  database port
               DB_USER       =  database user
               DB_PASSWORD   =  database password
               DB_SOCKET     =  database socket
               MYSQL_VERSION =  MySQL version (e.g. 5.7.12)
               MYSQL_MAJOR   =  Major part of the version (e.g 5)
               MYSQL_MINOR   =  Minor part of the version (e.g 7)
               MYSQL_REV     =  Revision part of the version (e.g 12)
               EXEC_STAGE    =  Stage of the execution (pre_start_exec, pre_grants_exec, post_grants_exec)

       The order of execution during the installation is the following:

           * server installation (mysql_install_db or mysqld --initialize)
               * pre_start_exec
           * server start
               * pre_grants_exec
               * pre_grants_sql (includes load_plugin calls)
               * pre_grants_file
           * load grants
               * post_grants_exec
               * post_grants_sql
               * post_grants_file

</pre><h4><b>SBTool</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sandbox</b> <b>helper</b></h4><pre>
       The Sandbox Helper, "sbtool", is a  tool  that  allows  administrative  operations  on  already  existing
       sandboxes.  It  does  a  number  of important tasks that are not available at creation time or that would
       require too much manual labor.

   <b>sbtool</b> <b>-</b> <b>Informational</b> <b>options</b>
       <u>sbtool</u> <u>-o</u> <u>info</u>

       Returns configuration options from a Sandbox (if specified) or from  all  sandboxes  under  $SANDBOX_HOME
       (default).   You  can  use  "--search_path"  to  tell  sbtool  where to start.  The return information is
       formatted as a Perl structure.

       <u>sbtool</u> <u>-o</u> <u>ports</u>

       Lists ports used by the Sandbox. Use "--search_path" to tell sbtool where to start  looking  (default  is
       $SANDBOX_HOME).  You can also use the "--format" option to influence the outcome. Currently supported are
       only 'text' and 'perl'.  If you add the "--only_used" option, sbtool will return only the ports that  are
       currently open.

       <u>sbtool</u> <u>-o</u> <u>range</u>

       Finds  N  consecutive  ports not yet used by the Sandbox.  It uses the same options used with 'ports' and
       'info'. Additionally, you can  define  the  low  and  high  boundaries  by  means  of  "--min_range"  and
       "--max_range".   The  size  of  range  to  search  is  10  ports  by  default.  It  can  be  changed with
       "--range_size".

   <b>sbtool</b> <b>-</b> <b>modification</b> <b>options</b>
       <u>sbtool</u> <u>-o</u> <u>port</u>

       Changes port to an existing Sandbox.  This  requires  the  options  "--source_dir"  and  "--new_port"  to
       complete the task.  If the sandbox is running, it will be stopped.

       <u>sbtool</u> <u>-o</u> <u>copy</u>

       Copies  data  from  one  Sandbox  to  another.   It  only  works  on  <b>single</b>  sandboxes.  It requires the
       "--source_dir" and "--dest_dir" options to complete the task.  Both Source and destination directory must
       be already installed sandboxes. If any of them is still running, it will be stopped. If both  source  and
       destination  directory  point  to  the  same  directory, the command is not performed.  At the end of the
       operation, all the data in the source sandbox is copied to the destination sandbox. Existing  files  will
       be  overwritten.  It  is  advisable,  but  not  required,  to  run a "./clear" command on the destination
       directory before performing this task.

       <u>sbtool</u> <u>-o</u> <u>move</u>

       Moves a Sandbox to a different location.  Unlike 'copy', this operation acts on the  whole  sandbox,  and
       can  move both single and multiple sandboxes.  It requires the "--source_dir" and "--dest_dir" options to
       complete the task.  If the destination directory already exists, the task is not performed. If the source
       sandbox is running, it will be stopped before performing the operation.  After the move, all  paths  used
       in the sandbox scripts will be changed.

       <u>sbtool</u> <u>-o</u> <u>tree</u>

       Creates  a replication tree, with one master, one or more intermediate level slaves, and one or more leaf
       node slaves for each intermediate level.  To create the tree, you need to create a multiple nodes sandbox
       (using "make_multiple_sandbox") and then use "sbtool" with the following options:

        * --tree_dir , containing the sandbox to convert to a tree
        * --master_node, containing the node that will be master
        * --mid_nodes, with a list of nodes for the intermediate level
        * --leaf_nodes, with as many lists as how many mid_nodes
          Each list is separated from the next by a pipe sign (|).

       Alternatively, you can use the "--tree_nodes" option to describe all the tree at once.

       For example, in a sandbox with 8 nodes, to define 1 as master node, nodes 2 and 3 as  middle nodes, nodes
       4, 5, and 6 as slaves of node 2 and nodes 7 and 8 as slaves  of  node  3,  you  can  use  either  of  the
       following:

        sbtool --tree_dir=/path/to/source \
           --master_node=1 \
           --mid_nodes='2 3'
           --leaf_nodes='4 5 6|7 8'

        sbtool --tree_dir=/path/to/source \
           --tree_nodes='1 - 2 3 - 4 5 6|7 8'

       <u>sbtool</u> <u>-o</u> <u>preserve</u>

       Makes  a  sandbox  permanent.   It requires the "--source_dir" option to complete the task.  This command
       changes the 'clear' command within the requested sandbox, disabling its effects.  The  sandbox  can't  be
       erased  using 'clear' or 'clear_all'.  The 'delete' operation of sbtool will skip a sandbox that has been
       made permanent.

       <u>sbtool</u> <u>-o</u> <u>unpreserve</u>

       Makes a sandbox NOT permanent.  It requires the "--source_dir" option to complete the task.  This command
       cancels the changes made by a 'preserve' operation, making a sandbox erasable with the  'clear'  command.
       The 'delete' operation can be performed successfully on an unpreserved sandbox.

       <u>sbtool</u> <u>-o</u> <u>delete</u>

       Removes a sandbox completely.  It requires the "--source_dir" option to complete the task.  The requested
       sandbox will be stopped and then deleted completely.  WARNING! No confirmation is asked!

       <u>sbtool</u> <u>-o</u> <u>plugin</u>

       Installs  a  given  plugin  into  a  sandbox.   It  requires the "--source_dir" and "--plugin" options to
       complete the task.  The plugin indicated must be defined in the plugin template file, which is by default
       installed in  $SANDBOX_HOME.   Optionally,  you  can  indicate  a  different  plugin  template  with  the
       "--plugin_file"  option.   By default, sbtool looks for the plugin template file in the sandbox directory
       that is the target of the installation. If it is not found there, it will look  at  $SANDBOX_HOME  before
       giving up with an error.

       Plugin template

       The  Plugin  template  is  a  Perl script containing the definition of the templates you want to install.
       Each plugin must have at least one target <b>Server</b> <b>type</b>, which could be  one  of  <u>all_servers</u>,  <u>master</u>,  or
       <u>slave</u>. It is allowed to have more than one target types in the same plugin.

       Each  server  type,  in turn, must have at least one section named <b>operation_sequence</b>, an array reference
       containing the list of the actions to perform. Such actions  can  be  regular  scripts  in  each  sandbox
       (start, stop, restart, clear) or one of the following template sections:

       options_file
          It is the list of lines to add to an options file, under the "[mysqld]" label.

       sql_commands
          It  is  a  list of queries to execute. Every query must have appropriate semicolons as required. If no
          semicolon are found in the list, no queries are executed.

       startup_file
          It is a file, named <u>startup.sql</u>, to be created under the data directory. It  will  contain  the  lines
          indicated  in  this  section.   You  must  remember  to  add  a  line  'init-file=startup.sql'  to the
          options_file section.

</pre><h4><b>TESTING</b></h4><pre>
   <b>test_sandbox</b>
       The MySQL Sandbox comes with a test suite, called test_sandbox, which by default tests single,replicated,
       multiple, and custom installations of MySQL version 5.0.77 and 5.1.32.You can override the version  being
       tested by means of command line options:

        test_sandbox --versions=5.0.67,5.1.30

       or you can specify a tarball

        test_sandbox --versions=/path/to/mysql-tarball-5.1.31.tar.gz
        test_sandbox --tarball=/path/to/mysql-tarball-5.1.31.tar.gz

       You can also define which tests you want to run:

         test_sandbox --tests=single,replication

   <b>Test</b> <b>isolation</b>
       The  tests are not performed in the common $SANDBOX_HOME directory, but on a separate directory, which by
       default is "$HOME/test_sb". To avoid interferences, before the tests  start,  the  application  runs  the
       "$SANDBOX_HOME/stop_all" command.  The test directory is considered to exist purely for testing purposes,
       and  it  is  erased several times while running the suite. Using this directory to store valuable data is
       higly risky.

   <b>Tests</b> <b>during</b> <b>installation</b>
       When you build the package and run

         make test

       test_sandbox is called, in addition to many other tests in the ./t directory, and the tests are performed
       on a temporary directory under "$INSTALLATION_DIRECTORY/t/test_sb". By default, version 5.6.26  is  used.
       If this version is not found in "$HOME/opt/mysql/", the test is skipped.  You can override this option by
       setting the TEST_VERSION environment variable.

         TEST_VERSION=5.7.9 make test
         TEST_VERSION=$HOME/opt/mysql/5.7.9 make test
         TEST_VERSION=/path/to/myswl-tarball-5.7.9.tar.gz make test

   <b>User</b> <b>defined</b> <b>tests</b>
       Starting with version 2.0.99, you can define your own tests, and run them by

         $ test_sandbox --user_test=file_name

       <u>simplified</u> <u>test</u> <u>script</u>

       Inside  your test file, you can define test actions.  There are two kind of tests: shell and sql the test
       type is defined by a keyword followed by a colon.

       The 'shell' test requires a 'command', which is passed to a shell.  The 'expected' label is a string that
       you expect to find within the shell output.  If you don't expect anything, you can just say  "expected  =
       OK",  meaning  that  you  will  be satisfied with a ZERO exit code reported by the operating system.  The
       'msg' is the description of the test that is shown to you when the test runs.

         shell:
         command  = make_sandbox 5.1.30 -- --no_confirm
         expected = sandbox server started
         msg      = sandbox creation

       The 'sql' test requires a 'path', which is the place where the  test  engine  expects  to  find  a  'use'
       script.   The  'query'  is  passed  to  the above mentioned script and the output is captured for further
       processing.  The 'expected' parameter is a string that you want to find in the query output.   The  'msg'
       parameter is like the one used with the 'shell' test.

         sql:
         path    = $SANDBOX_HOME/msb_5_1_30
         query   = select version()
         expected = 5.1.30
         msg      = checking version

       All strings starting with a $ are expanded to their corresponding environment variables.  For example, if
       $SANDBOX_HOME is /home/sb/tests, the line

         command  = $SANDBOX_HOME/msb_5_1_30/stop

       will expand to:

         command = /home/sb/tests/msb_5_1_30/stop

       <u>Perl</u> <u>based</u> <u>test</u> <u>scripts</u>

       In  addition to the internal script language, you can also define perl scripts, which will be able to use
       the $sandbox_home global variable and to call routines defined inside test_sandbox. (see list  below)  To
       be identified as a Perl script, the user defined test must have the extension ".sb.pl"

       <b>ok_shell()</b>
          The  "ok_shell" function requires a hash reference containing the following labels: A 'command', which
          is passed to a shell.  The 'expected' label is a string that you  expect  to  find  within  the  shell
          output.   If  you  don't  expect  anything, you can just say "expected = OK", meaning that you will be
          satisfied with a ZERO exit code reported by the operating system.  The 'msg' is the description of the
          test that is shown to you when the test runs.

            ok_shell($hashref)
            ok_shell({
                  command  =&gt; 'make_sandbox 5.1.30 --no_confirm',
                  expected =&gt; 'sandbox server started',
                  msg      =&gt; 'sandbox creation',
                  })

       <b>ok_sql()</b>
          The "ok_sql" function requires a hashref containing the following labels: A 'path', which is the place
          where the test engine expects to find a 'use' script.  The 'query' is passed to  the  above  mentioned
          script  and  the output is captured for further processing.  The 'expected' parameter is a string that
          you want to find in the query output.  The 'msg' parameter is like  the  one  used  with  the  ok_exec
          function.

       <b>get_bare_version()</b>
          This  function  accepts  one  parameter,  which  can  be either a MySQL tarball name or a version, and
          returns the bare version found in the input string.  If  called  in  list  mode,  it  returns  also  a
          normalized version string with dots replaced by underscores.

              my $version = get_bare_version('5.1.30');
              # returns '5.1.30'

              my $version = get_bare_version('mysql-5.1.30-OS.tar.gz');
              # returns '5.1.30'

              my ($version,$dir_name) = get_bare_version('mysql-5.1.30-OS.tar.gz');
              # returns ('5.1.30', '5_1_30')

       ok This  is  a low level function, similar to the one provided by Test::More. You should not need to call
          this one directly, unless you want to fine tuning a test.

          See the test script t/start_restart_arguments.sb.pl as an example
