</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       PCLAPV2  -  applie  either  P  (permutation matrix indicated by IPIV) or inv( P ) to a M-by-N distributed
       matrix sub( A ) denoting A(IA:IA+M-1,JA:JA+N-1), resulting in row or column pivoting

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       SUBROUTINE PCLAPV2( DIREC, ROWCOL, M, N, A, IA, JA, DESCA, IPIV, IP, JP, DESCIP )

           CHARACTER       DIREC, ROWCOL

           INTEGER         IA, IP, JA, JP, M, N

           INTEGER         DESCA( * ), DESCIP( * ), IPIV( * )

           COMPLEX         A( * )

</pre><h4><b>PURPOSE</b></h4><pre>
       PCLAPV2 applies either P (permutation matrix indicated by IPIV) or inv(  P  )  to  a  M-by-N  distributed
       matrix  sub(  A ) denoting A(IA:IA+M-1,JA:JA+N-1), resulting in row or column pivoting.  The pivot vector
       should be aligned with the distributed matrix A.  For pivoting the rows of  sub(  A  ),  IPIV  should  be
       distributed  along  a  process  column  and  replicated over all process rows.  Similarly, IPIV should be
       distributed along a process row and replicated over all process columns for column pivoting.

       Notes
       =====

       Each global data object is described by  an  associated  description  vector.   This  vector  stores  the
       information required to establish the mapping between an object element and its corresponding process and
       memory location.

       Let  A  be  a  generic  term  for  any  2D  block cyclicly distributed array.  Such a global array has an
       associated description vector DESCA.  In the following comments, the character _ should be  read  as  "of
       the global array".

       NOTATION        STORED IN      EXPLANATION
       ---------------  -------------- -------------------------------------- DTYPE_A(global) DESCA( DTYPE_ )The
       descriptor type.  In this case,
                                      DTYPE_A = 1.
       CTXT_A (global) DESCA( CTXT_ ) The BLACS context handle, indicating
                                      the BLACS process grid A is distribu-
                                      ted over. The context itself is glo-
                                      bal, but the handle (the integer
                                      value) may vary.
       M_A    (global) DESCA( M_ )    The number of rows in the global
                                      array A.
       N_A    (global) DESCA( N_ )    The number of columns in the global
                                      array A.
       MB_A   (global) DESCA( MB_ )   The blocking factor used to distribute
                                      the rows of the array.
       NB_A   (global) DESCA( NB_ )   The blocking factor used to distribute
                                      the columns of the array.
       RSRC_A (global) DESCA( RSRC_ ) The process row over which the first
                                      row of the array A is distributed.  CSRC_A (global)  DESCA(  CSRC_  )  The
       process column over which the
                                      first column of the array A is
                                      distributed.
       LLD_A  (local)  DESCA( LLD_ )  The leading dimension of the local
                                      array.  LLD_A &gt;= MAX(1,LOCr(M_A)).

       Let  K  be  the  number  of rows or columns of a distributed matrix, and assume that its process grid has
       dimension p x q.
       LOCr( K ) denotes the number of elements of K that a process would receive if K were distributed over the
       p processes of its process column.
       Similarly, LOCc( K ) denotes the number of elements  of  K  that  a  process  would  receive  if  K  were
       distributed over the q processes of its process row.
       The values of LOCr() and LOCc() may be determined via a call to the ScaLAPACK tool function, NUMROC:
               LOCr( M ) = NUMROC( M, MB_A, MYROW, RSRC_A, NPROW ),
               LOCc(  N ) = NUMROC( N, NB_A, MYCOL, CSRC_A, NPCOL ).  An upper bound for these quantities may be
       computed by:
               LOCr( M ) &lt;= ceil( ceil(M/MB_A)/NPROW )*MB_A
               LOCc( N ) &lt;= ceil( ceil(N/NB_A)/NPCOL )*NB_A

</pre><h4><b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       DIREC   (global input) CHARACTER
               Specifies in which order the permutation is applied: = 'F' (Forward) Applies pivots Forward  from
               top  of  matrix.   Computes P * sub( A ); = 'B' (Backward) Applies pivots Backward from bottom of
               matrix. Computes inv( P ) * sub( A ).

       ROWCOL  (global input) CHARACTER
               Specifies if the rows or columns are to be permuted: = 'R' Rows will be permuted, =  'C'  Columns
               will be permuted.

       M       (global input) INTEGER
               The number of rows to be operated on, i.e. the number of rows of the distributed submatrix sub( A
               ). M &gt;= 0.

       N       (global input) INTEGER
               The  number of columns to be operated on, i.e. the number of columns of the distributed submatrix
               sub( A ). N &gt;= 0.

       A       (local input/local output) COMPLEX pointer into the
               local memory to an array of dimension (LLD_A, LOCc(JA+N-1)).  On entry, this local array contains
               the local pieces of the distributed matrix sub( A ) to which the row or columns interchanges will
               be applied. On exit, this array contains the local pieces of the permuted distributed matrix.

       IA      (global input) INTEGER
               The row index in the global array A indicating the first row of sub( A ).

       JA      (global input) INTEGER
               The column index in the global array A indicating the first column of sub( A ).

       DESCA   (global and local input) INTEGER array of dimension DLEN_.

               MB_A (resp. NB_A) is used as workspace. IPIV is tied to the distributed matrix A.

       IP      (global input) INTEGER
               IPIV's global row index, which points to the beginning of the submatrix which is to  be  operated
               on.

       JP      (global input) INTEGER
               IPIV's  global  column  index,  which  points  to  the  beginning of the submatrix which is to be
               operated on.

       DESCIP  (global and local input) INTEGER array of dimension 8
               The array descriptor for the distributed matrix IPIV.
