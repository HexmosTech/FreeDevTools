       <b>Internal</b> <b>Parameters:</b>

             THRESH is a threshold value used to decide if scaling should be done
             based on the ratio of the scaling factors.  If SCOND &lt; THRESH,
             scaling is done.

             LARGE and SMALL are threshold values used to decide if scaling should
             be done based on the absolute size of the largest matrix element.
             If AMAX &gt; LARGE or AMAX &lt; SMALL, scaling is done.

       <b>ZLAQSY</b> scales a symmetric/Hermitian matrix, using scaling factors computed by spoequ.

       <b>Purpose:</b>

            ZLAQSY equilibrates a symmetric matrix A using the scaling factors
            in the vector S.

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>UPLO</u>

                     UPLO is CHARACTER*1
                     Specifies whether the upper or lower triangular part of the
                     symmetric matrix A is stored.
                     = 'U':  Upper triangular
                     = 'L':  Lower triangular

           <u>N</u>

                     N is INTEGER
                     The order of the matrix A.  N &gt;= 0.

           <u>A</u>

                     A is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDA,N)
                     On entry, the symmetric matrix A.  If UPLO = 'U', the leading
                     n by n upper triangular part of A contains the upper
                     triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly lower
                     triangular part of A is not referenced.  If UPLO = 'L', the
                     leading n by n lower triangular part of A contains the lower
                     triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly upper
                     triangular part of A is not referenced.

                     On exit, if EQUED = 'Y', the equilibrated matrix:
                     diag(S) * A * diag(S).

           <u>LDA</u>

                     LDA is INTEGER
                     The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA &gt;= max(N,1).

           <u>S</u>

           <u>AMAX</u>

                     AMAX is DOUBLE PRECISION
                     Absolute value of largest matrix entry.

           <u>EQUED</u>

                     EQUED is CHARACTER*1
                     Specifies whether or not equilibration was done.
                     = 'N':  No equilibration.
                     = 'Y':  Equilibration was done, i.e., A has been replaced by
                             diag(S) * A * diag(S).

       <b>Internal</b> <b>Parameters:</b>

             THRESH is a threshold value used to decide if scaling should be done
             based on the ratio of the scaling factors.  If SCOND &lt; THRESH,
             scaling is done.

             LARGE and SMALL are threshold values used to decide if scaling should
             be done based on the absolute size of the largest matrix element.
             If AMAX &gt; LARGE or AMAX &lt; SMALL, scaling is done.
