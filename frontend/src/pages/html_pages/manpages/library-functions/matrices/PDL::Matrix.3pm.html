</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       PDL::Matrix -- a convenience matrix class for column-major access

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This document refers to version PDL::Matrix 0.5 of PDL::Matrix

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use PDL::Matrix;

         $m = mpdl [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]];
         $m = PDL::Matrix-&gt;pdl([[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]);
         $m = msequence(4,3);
         @dimsa = $x-&gt;mdims; # 'dims' is not overloaded

         $v = vpdl [0,1,2,3]
         $v = <a href="../man4/vzeroes.4.html">vzeroes</a>(4);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Overview</b>
       This package tries to help people who want to use PDL for 2D matrix computation with lots of indexing
       involved. It provides a PDL subclass so one- and two-dimensional ndarrays that are used as vectors resp
       and matrices can be typed in using traditional matrix convention.

       If you want to know more about matrix operation support in PDL, you want to read PDL::MatrixOps or
       PDL::LinearAlgebra.

       The original pdl class refers to the first index as the first row, the second index as the first column
       of a matrix. Consider

         print $B = sequence(3,2)
         [
          [0 1 2]
          [3 4 5]
         ]

       which gives a 2x3 matrix in terms of the matrix convention, but the constructor used (3,2). This might
       get more confusing when using slices like sequence(3,2)-&gt;slice("1:2,(0)") : with traditional matrix
       convention one would expect [2 4] instead of [1 2].

       This subclass PDL::Matrix overloads the constructors and indexing functions of pdls so that they are
       compatible with the usual matrix convention, where the first dimension refers to the row of a matrix. So
       now, the above example would be written as

         print $B = PDL::Matrix-&gt;sequence(3,2) # or $B = msequence(3,2)
         [
          [0 1]
          [2 3]
          [4 5]
         ]

       Routines like eigens or inv can be used without any changes.

       Furthermore one can construct and use vectors as n x 1 matrices without mentioning the second index '1'.

   <b>Implementation</b>
       "PDL::Matrix" works by overloading a number of PDL constructors and methods such that first and second
       args (corresponding to first and second dims of corresponding matrices) are effectively swapped.  It is
       not yet clear if PDL::Matrix achieves a consistent column-major look-and-feel in this way.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       As of version 0.5 (rewrite by CED) the matrices are stored in the usual way, just constructed and
       stringified differently.  That way indexing and everything else works the way you think it should.

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>mpdl,</b> <b>PDL::Matrix::pdl</b>
       constructs an object of class PDL::Matrix which is an ndarray child class.

           $m = mpdl [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]];
           $m = PDL::Matrix-&gt;pdl([[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]);

   <b>mzeroes,</b> <b>mones,</b> <b>msequence</b>
       constructs a PDL::Matrix object similar to the ndarray constructors zeroes, ones, sequence.

   <b>vpdl</b>
       constructs an object of class PDL::Matrix which is of matrix dimensions (n x 1)

           print $v = vpdl [0,1];
           [
            [0]
            [1]
           ]

   <b>vzeroes,</b> <b>vones,</b> <b>vsequence</b>
       constructs a PDL::Matrix object with matrix dimensions (n x 1), therefore only the first scalar argument
       is used.

           print $v = <a href="../man2/vsequence.2.html">vsequence</a>(2);
           [
            [0]
            [1]
           ]

   <b>kroneckerproduct</b>
       returns kroneckerproduct of two matrices. This is not efficiently implemented.

   <b>det_general</b>
       returns a generalized determinant of a matrix. If the matrix is not regular, one can specify the rank of
       the matrix and the corresponding subdeterminant is returned. This is implemented using the "eigens"
       function.

   <b>trace</b>
       returns the trace of a matrix (sum of diagonals)

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>PROBLEMS</b></h4><pre>
       Because we change the way ndarrays are constructed, not all pdl operators may be applied to ndarray-
       matrices. The inner product is not redefined. We might have missed some functions/methods. Internal
       consistency of our approach needs yet to be established.

       Because PDL::Matrix changes the way slicing behaves, it breaks many operators, notably those in
       MatrixOps.

</pre><h4><b>TODO</b></h4><pre>
       check all PDL functions, benchmarks, optimization, lots of other things ...
