       <b>CLA_HEAMV</b> computes a matrix-vector product using a Hermitian indefinite matrix to calculate error bounds.

       <b>Purpose:</b>

            CLA_SYAMV  performs the matrix-vector operation

                    y := alpha*abs(A)*abs(x) + beta*abs(y),

            where alpha and beta are scalars, x and y are vectors and A is an
            n by n symmetric matrix.

            This function is primarily used in calculating error bounds.
            To protect against underflow during evaluation, components in
            the resulting vector are perturbed away from zero by (N+1)
            times the underflow threshold.  To prevent unnecessarily large
            errors for block-structure embedded in general matrices,
            'symbolically' zero components are not perturbed.  A zero
            entry is considered 'symbolic' if all multiplications involved
            in computing that entry have at least one zero multiplicand.

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>UPLO</u>

                     UPLO is INTEGER
                      On entry, UPLO specifies whether the upper or lower
                      triangular part of the array A is to be referenced as
                      follows:

                         UPLO = BLAS_UPPER   Only the upper triangular part of A

                         UPLO = BLAS_LOWER   Only the lower triangular part of A
                                             is to be referenced.

       <b>SLA_SYAMV</b> computes a matrix-vector product using a symmetric indefinite matrix to calculate error bounds.

       <b>Purpose:</b>

            SLA_SYAMV  performs the matrix-vector operation

                    y := alpha*abs(A)*abs(x) + beta*abs(y),

            where alpha and beta are scalars, x and y are vectors and A is an
            n by n symmetric matrix.

            This function is primarily used in calculating error bounds.
            To protect against underflow during evaluation, components in
            the resulting vector are perturbed away from zero by (N+1)
            times the underflow threshold.  To prevent unnecessarily large
            errors for block-structure embedded in general matrices,
            'symbolically' zero components are not perturbed.  A zero
            entry is considered 'symbolic' if all multiplications involved
            in computing that entry have at least one zero multiplicand.
