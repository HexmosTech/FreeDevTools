       <b>DLAED1</b> used by DSTEDC. Computes the updated eigensystem of a diagonal matrix after modification by a
       rank-one symmetric matrix. Used when the original matrix is tridiagonal.

       <b>Purpose:</b>

            DLAED1 computes the updated eigensystem of a diagonal
            matrix after modification by a rank-one symmetric matrix.  This
            routine is used only for the eigenproblem which requires all
            eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a tridiagonal matrix.  DLAED7 handles
            the case in which eigenvalues only or eigenvalues and eigenvectors
            of a full symmetric matrix (which was reduced to tridiagonal form)
            are desired.

              T = Q(in) ( D(in) + RHO * Z*Z**T ) Q**T(in) = Q(out) * D(out) * Q**T(out)

               where Z = Q**T*u, u is a vector of length N with ones in the
               CUTPNT and CUTPNT + 1 th elements and zeros elsewhere.

               The eigenvectors of the original matrix are stored in Q, and the
               eigenvalues are in D.  The algorithm consists of three stages:

                  The first stage consists of deflating the size of the problem
                  when there are multiple eigenvalues or if there is a zero in
                  the Z vector.  For each such occurrence the dimension of the
                  secular equation problem is reduced by one.  This stage is
                  performed by the routine DLAED2.

                  The second stage consists of calculating the updated
                  eigenvalues. This is done by finding the roots of the secular
                  equation via the routine DLAED4 (as called by DLAED3).
                  This routine also calculates the eigenvectors of the current
                  problem.

                  The final stage consists of computing the updated eigenvectors
                  directly using the updated eigenvalues.  The eigenvectors for
                  the current problem are multiplied with the eigenvectors from
                  the overall problem.

              T = Q(in) ( D(in) + RHO * Z*Z**T ) Q**T(in) = Q(out) * D(out) * Q**T(out)
