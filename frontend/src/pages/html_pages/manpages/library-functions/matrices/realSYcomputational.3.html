   <b>subroutine</b> <b>sla_syamv</b> <b>(integer</b> <b>UPLO,</b> <b>integer</b> <b>N,</b> <b>real</b> <b>ALPHA,</b> <b>real,</b> <b>dimension(</b> <b>lda,</b> <b>*</b> <b>)</b> <b>A,</b> <b>integer</b> <b>LDA,</b> <b>real,</b>

       <b>SLA_SYAMV</b> computes a matrix-vector product using a symmetric indefinite matrix to calculate error bounds.

       <b>Purpose:</b>

            SLA_SYAMV  performs the matrix-vector operation

                    y := alpha*abs(A)*abs(x) + beta*abs(y),

            where alpha and beta are scalars, x and y are vectors and A is an
            n by n symmetric matrix.

            This function is primarily used in calculating error bounds.
            To protect against underflow during evaluation, components in
            the resulting vector are perturbed away from zero by (N+1)
            times the underflow threshold.  To prevent unnecessarily large
            errors for block-structure embedded in general matrices,
            "symbolically" zero components are not perturbed.  A zero
            entry is considered "symbolic" if all multiplications involved
            in computing that entry have at least one zero multiplicand.

       <b>Parameters</b>

            and provides error bounds and backward error estimates for the solution.
            This subroutine is called by SSYRFSX to perform iterative refinement.
            In addition to normwise error bound, the code provides maximum
            componentwise error bound if possible. See comments for ERR_BNDS_NORM
            and ERR_BNDS_COMP for details of the error bounds. Note that this
            subroutine is only resonsible for setting the second fields of
            ERR_BNDS_NORM and ERR_BNDS_COMP.

                The number of linear equations, i.e., the order of the
                matrix A.  N &gt;= 0.

                matrix B.

           <u>A</u>

                     A is REAL array, dimension (LDA,N)
                On entry, the N-by-N matrix A.

           <u>LDA</u>

                     LDA is INTEGER
                The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA &gt;= max(1,N).

           <u>AF</u>

                     AF is REAL array, dimension (LDAF,N)
                The block diagonal matrix D and the multipliers used to

                     COLEQU is LOGICAL
                If .TRUE. then column equilibration was done to A before calling

                bounds correctly.

                     C is REAL array, dimension (N)
                The column scale factors for A. If COLEQU = .FALSE., C
                is not accessed. If C is input, each element of C should be a power
                of the radix to ensure a reliable solution and error estimates.
                Scaling by powers of the radix does not cause rounding errors unless
                the result underflows or overflows. Rounding errors during scaling
                lead to refining with a matrix that is not equivalent to the
                input matrix, producing error estimates that may not be
                reliable.

                     BERR_OUT is REAL array, dimension (NRHS)
                On exit, BERR_OUT(j) contains the componentwise relative backward
                error for right-hand-side j from the formula
                    max(i) ( abs(RES(i)) / ( abs(op(A_s))*abs(Y) + abs(B_s) )(i) )
                where abs(Z) is the componentwise absolute value of the matrix
                or vector Z. This is computed by SLA_LIN_BERR.

           <u>N_NORMS</u>

                     N_NORMS is INTEGER
                Determines which error bounds to return (see ERR_BNDS_NORM
                and ERR_BNDS_COMP).
                If N_NORMS &gt;= 1 return normwise error bounds.
                If N_NORMS &gt;= 2 return componentwise error bounds.

           <u>ERR_BNDS_NORM</u>

                     ERR_BNDS_NORM is REAL array, dimension (NRHS, N_ERR_BNDS)
                For each right-hand side, this array contains information about
                various error bounds and condition numbers corresponding to the
                normwise relative error, which is defined as follows:

                Normwise relative error in the ith solution vector:
                        max_j (abs(XTRUE(j,i) - X(j,i)))
                       ------------------------------
                             max_j abs(X(j,i))

                The array is indexed by the type of error information as described
                below. There currently are up to three pieces of information
                returned.

                The first index in ERR_BNDS_NORM(i,:) corresponds to the ith
                right-hand side.

                The second index in ERR_BNDS_NORM(:,err) contains the following
                three fields:
                err = 1 "Trust/don't trust" boolean. Trust the answer if the
                         reciprocal condition number is less than the threshold
                         sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon').

                err = 2 "Guaranteed" error bound: The estimated forward error,
                         almost certainly within a factor of 10 of the true error
                         so long as the next entry is greater than the threshold
                         sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon'). This error bound should only
                         be trusted if the previous boolean is true.

                err = 3  Reciprocal condition number: Estimated normwise
                         reciprocal condition number.  Compared with the threshold
                         sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon') to determine if the error
                         estimate is "guaranteed". These reciprocal condition
                         numbers are 1 / (norm(Z^{-1},inf) * norm(Z,inf)) for some
                         appropriately scaled matrix Z.
                         Let Z = S*A, where S scales each row by a power of the
                         radix so all absolute row sums of Z are approximately 1.

                This subroutine is only responsible for setting the second field
                above.
                See Lapack Working Note 165 for further details and extra
                cautions.

           <u>ERR_BNDS_COMP</u>

                     ERR_BNDS_COMP is REAL array, dimension (NRHS, N_ERR_BNDS)
                For each right-hand side, this array contains information about
                various error bounds and condition numbers corresponding to the
                componentwise relative error, which is defined as follows:

                Componentwise relative error in the ith solution vector:
                               abs(XTRUE(j,i) - X(j,i))
                        max_j ----------------------
                                    abs(X(j,i))

                The array is indexed by the right-hand side i (on which the
                componentwise relative error depends), and the type of error
                information as described below. There currently are up to three
                pieces of information returned for each right-hand side. If
                componentwise accuracy is not requested (<a href="../man3/PARAMS.3.html">PARAMS</a>(3) = 0.0), then
                ERR_BNDS_COMP is not accessed.  If N_ERR_BNDS &lt; 3, then at most
                the first (:,N_ERR_BNDS) entries are returned.

                The first index in ERR_BNDS_COMP(i,:) corresponds to the ith
                right-hand side.

                The second index in ERR_BNDS_COMP(:,err) contains the following
                three fields:
                err = 1 "Trust/don't trust" boolean. Trust the answer if the
                         reciprocal condition number is less than the threshold
                         sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon').

                err = 2 "Guaranteed" error bound: The estimated forward error,
                         almost certainly within a factor of 10 of the true error
                         so long as the next entry is greater than the threshold
                         sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon'). This error bound should only
                         be trusted if the previous boolean is true.

                err = 3  Reciprocal condition number: Estimated componentwise
                         reciprocal condition number.  Compared with the threshold
                         sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon') to determine if the error
                         estimate is "guaranteed". These reciprocal condition
                         numbers are 1 / (norm(Z^{-1},inf) * norm(Z,inf)) for some
                         appropriately scaled matrix Z.
                         Let Z = S*(A*diag(x)), where x is the solution for the
                         current right-hand side and S scales each row of
                         A*diag(x) by a power of the radix so all absolute row
                         sums of Z are approximately 1.

           <u>RES</u>

                     RES is REAL array, dimension (N)
                Workspace to hold the intermediate residual.

           <u>AYB</u>

                     AYB is REAL array, dimension (N)
                Workspace. This can be the same workspace passed for Y_TAIL.

           <u>DY</u>

                     DY is REAL array, dimension (N)
                Workspace to hold the intermediate solution.

           <u>Y_TAIL</u>

                     Y_TAIL is REAL array, dimension (N)
                Workspace to hold the trailing bits of the intermediate solution.

           <u>RCOND</u>

                     RCOND is REAL
                Reciprocal scaled condition number.  This is an estimate of the
                reciprocal Skeel condition number of the matrix A after
                equilibration (if done).  If this is less than the machine
                precision (in particular, if it is zero), the matrix is singular
                to working precision.  Note that the error may still be small even
                if this number is very small and the matrix appears ill-
                conditioned.

           <u>ITHRESH</u>

                     ITHRESH is INTEGER
                The maximum number of residual computations allowed for
                refinement. The default is 10. For 'aggressive' set to 100 to
                permit convergence using approximate factorizations or
                factorizations other than LU. If the factorization uses a
                technique other than Gaussian elimination, the guarantees in
                ERR_BNDS_NORM and ERR_BNDS_COMP may no longer be trustworthy.

           <u>RTHRESH</u>

                     RTHRESH is REAL
                Determines when to stop refinement if the error estimate stops
                decreasing. Refinement will stop when the next solution no longer
                satisfies norm(dx_{i+1}) &lt; RTHRESH * norm(dx_i) where norm(Z) is
                the infinity norm of Z. RTHRESH satisfies 0 &lt; RTHRESH &lt;= 1. The
                default value is 0.5. For 'aggressive' set to 0.9 to permit
                convergence on extremely ill-conditioned matrices. See LAWN 165
                for more details.

           <u>DZ_UB</u>

                     DZ_UB is REAL
                Determines when to start considering componentwise convergence.
                Componentwise convergence is only considered after each component
                of the solution Y is stable, which we define as the relative
                change in each component being less than DZ_UB. The default value
                is 0.25, requiring the first bit to be stable. See LAWN 165 for
                more details.

           <u>IGNORE_CWISE</u>

                     IGNORE_CWISE is LOGICAL
                If .TRUE. then ignore componentwise convergence. Default value
                is .FALSE..

           <u>INFO</u>

                     INFO is INTEGER
                  = 0:  Successful exit.
                  &lt; 0:  if INFO = -i, the ith argument to SLA_SYRFSX_EXTENDED had an illegal
                        value

       <b>SLA_SYRPVGRW</b> computes the reciprocal pivot growth factor norm(A)/norm(U) for a symmetric indefinite
       matrix.

       <b>Purpose:</b>

            SLA_SYRPVGRW computes the reciprocal pivot growth factor
            norm(A)/norm(U). The "max absolute element" norm is used. If this is
            much less than 1, the stability of the LU factorization of the
            (equilibrated) matrix A could be poor. This also means that the
            solution X, estimated condition numbers, and error bounds could be
            unreliable.

            A  =  ( I  U12 ) ( A11  0  ) (  I       0    )  if UPLO = 'U', or:
                  ( 0  U22 ) (  0   D  ) ( U12**T U22**T )

            A  =  ( L11  0 ) (  D   0  ) ( L11**T L21**T )  if UPLO = 'L'
                  ( L21  I ) (  0  A22 ) (  0       I    )

            where the order of D is at most NB. The actual order is returned in
            the argument KB, and is either NB or NB-1, or N if N &lt;= NB.

            SLASYF is an auxiliary routine called by SSYTRF. It uses blocked code
            (calling Level 3 BLAS) to update the submatrix A11 (if UPLO = 'U') or
            A22 (if UPLO = 'L').

       <b>SLASYF_AA</b>

       <b>Purpose:</b>

            DLATRF_AA factorizes a panel of a real symmetric matrix A using
            the Aasen's algorithm. The panel consists of a set of NB rows of A
            when UPLO is U, or a set of NB columns when UPLO is L.

            In order to factorize the panel, the Aasen's algorithm requires the
            last row, or column, of the previous panel. The first row, or column,
            of A is set to be the first row, or column, of an identity matrix,
            which is used to factorize the first panel.

            The resulting J-th row of U, or J-th column of L, is stored in the
            (J-1)-th row, or column, of A (without the unit diagonals), while
            the diagonal and subdiagonal of A are overwritten by those of T.

                     On entry, A contains the last row, or column, of
                     the previous panel, and the trailing submatrix of A
                     to be factorized, except for the first panel, only

                     The factored form of the matrix A.  AF contains the block
                     diagonal matrix D and the multipliers used to obtain the
                     factor U or L from the factorization A = U*D*U**T or

                     X(j) (the j-th column of the solution matrix X).
                     If XTRUE is the true solution corresponding to X(j), FERR(j)
                     is an estimated upper bound for the magnitude of the largest
                     element in (X(j) - XTRUE) divided by the magnitude of the
                     largest element in X(j).  The estimate is as reliable as
                     the estimate for RCOND, and is almost always a slight

                     The componentwise relative backward error of each solution
                     vector X(j) (i.e., the smallest relative change in
                     any element of A or B that makes X(j) an exact solution).

       <b>SSYRFSX</b>

       <b>Purpose:</b>

               SSYRFSX improves the computed solution to a system of linear
               equations when the coefficient matrix is symmetric indefinite, and
               provides error bounds and backward error estimates for the
               solution.  In addition to normwise error bound, the code provides
               maximum componentwise error bound if possible.  See comments for
               ERR_BNDS_NORM and ERR_BNDS_COMP for details of the error bounds.

               The original system of linear equations may have been equilibrated
               before calling this routine, as described by arguments EQUED and S
               below. In this case, the solution and error bounds returned are
               for the original unequilibrated system.

                Some optional parameters are bundled in the PARAMS array.  These
                settings determine how refinement is performed, but often the
                defaults are acceptable.  If the defaults are acceptable, users
                can pass NPARAMS = 0 which prevents the source code from accessing
                the PARAMS argument.

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>UPLO</u>

                     UPLO is CHARACTER*1
                  = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;
                  = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.

           <u>EQUED</u>

                     EQUED is CHARACTER*1
                Specifies the form of equilibration that was done to A
                before calling this routine. This is needed to compute
                the solution and error bounds correctly.
                  = 'N':  No equilibration
                  = 'Y':  Both row and column equilibration, i.e., A has been
                          replaced by diag(S) * A * diag(S).
                          The right hand side B has been changed accordingly.

           <u>N</u>

                     N is INTEGER
                The order of the matrix A.  N &gt;= 0.

           <u>NRHS</u>

                     NRHS is INTEGER
                The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns
                of the matrices B and X.  NRHS &gt;= 0.

           <u>A</u>

                     A is REAL array, dimension (LDA,N)
                The symmetric matrix A.  If UPLO = 'U', the leading N-by-N
                upper triangular part of A contains the upper triangular
                part of the matrix A, and the strictly lower triangular
                part of A is not referenced.  If UPLO = 'L', the leading
                N-by-N lower triangular part of A contains the lower
                triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly upper
                triangular part of A is not referenced.

           <u>LDA</u>

                     LDA is INTEGER
                The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA &gt;= max(1,N).

           <u>AF</u>

                     AF is REAL array, dimension (LDAF,N)
                The factored form of the matrix A.  AF contains the block
                diagonal matrix D and the multipliers used to obtain the
                factor U or L from the factorization A = U*D*U**T or A =
                L*D*L**T as computed by SSYTRF.

           <u>LDAF</u>

                     LDAF is INTEGER
                The leading dimension of the array AF.  LDAF &gt;= max(1,N).

           <u>IPIV</u>

                     IPIV is INTEGER array, dimension (N)
                Details of the interchanges and the block structure of D
                as determined by SSYTRF.

           <u>S</u>

                     S is REAL array, dimension (N)
                The scale factors for A.  If EQUED = 'Y', A is multiplied on
                the left and right by diag(S).  S is an input argument if FACT =
                'F'; otherwise, S is an output argument.  If FACT = 'F' and EQUED
                = 'Y', each element of S must be positive.  If S is output, each
                element of S is a power of the radix. If S is input, each element
                of S should be a power of the radix to ensure a reliable solution
                and error estimates. Scaling by powers of the radix does not cause
                rounding errors unless the result underflows or overflows.
                Rounding errors during scaling lead to refining with a matrix that
                is not equivalent to the input matrix, producing error estimates
                that may not be reliable.

           <u>B</u>

                     B is REAL array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
                The right hand side matrix B.

           <u>LDB</u>

                     LDB is INTEGER
                The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB &gt;= max(1,N).

           <u>X</u>

                     X is REAL array, dimension (LDX,NRHS)
                On entry, the solution matrix X, as computed by SGETRS.
                On exit, the improved solution matrix X.

           <u>LDX</u>

                     LDX is INTEGER
                The leading dimension of the array X.  LDX &gt;= max(1,N).

           <u>RCOND</u>

                     RCOND is REAL
                Reciprocal scaled condition number.  This is an estimate of the
                reciprocal Skeel condition number of the matrix A after
                equilibration (if done).  If this is less than the machine
                precision (in particular, if it is zero), the matrix is singular
                to working precision.  Note that the error may still be small even
                if this number is very small and the matrix appears ill-
                conditioned.

           <u>BERR</u>

                     BERR is REAL array, dimension (NRHS)
                Componentwise relative backward error.  This is the
                componentwise relative backward error of each solution vector X(j)
                (i.e., the smallest relative change in any element of A or B that
                makes X(j) an exact solution).

           <u>N_ERR_BNDS</u>

                     N_ERR_BNDS is INTEGER
                Number of error bounds to return for each right hand side
                and each type (normwise or componentwise).  See ERR_BNDS_NORM and
                ERR_BNDS_COMP below.

           <u>ERR_BNDS_NORM</u>

                     ERR_BNDS_NORM is REAL array, dimension (NRHS, N_ERR_BNDS)
                For each right-hand side, this array contains information about
                various error bounds and condition numbers corresponding to the
                normwise relative error, which is defined as follows:

                Normwise relative error in the ith solution vector:
                        max_j (abs(XTRUE(j,i) - X(j,i)))
                       ------------------------------
                             max_j abs(X(j,i))

                The array is indexed by the type of error information as described
                below. There currently are up to three pieces of information
                returned.

                The first index in ERR_BNDS_NORM(i,:) corresponds to the ith
                right-hand side.

                The second index in ERR_BNDS_NORM(:,err) contains the following
                three fields:
                err = 1 "Trust/don't trust" boolean. Trust the answer if the
                         reciprocal condition number is less than the threshold
                         sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon').

                err = 2 "Guaranteed" error bound: The estimated forward error,
                         almost certainly within a factor of 10 of the true error
                         so long as the next entry is greater than the threshold
                         sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon'). This error bound should only
                         be trusted if the previous boolean is true.

                err = 3  Reciprocal condition number: Estimated normwise
                         reciprocal condition number.  Compared with the threshold
                         sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon') to determine if the error
                         estimate is "guaranteed". These reciprocal condition
                         numbers are 1 / (norm(Z^{-1},inf) * norm(Z,inf)) for some
                         appropriately scaled matrix Z.
                         Let Z = S*A, where S scales each row by a power of the
                         radix so all absolute row sums of Z are approximately 1.

                See Lapack Working Note 165 for further details and extra
                cautions.

           <u>ERR_BNDS_COMP</u>

                     ERR_BNDS_COMP is REAL array, dimension (NRHS, N_ERR_BNDS)
                For each right-hand side, this array contains information about
                various error bounds and condition numbers corresponding to the
                componentwise relative error, which is defined as follows:

                Componentwise relative error in the ith solution vector:
                               abs(XTRUE(j,i) - X(j,i))
                        max_j ----------------------
                                    abs(X(j,i))

                The array is indexed by the right-hand side i (on which the
                componentwise relative error depends), and the type of error
                information as described below. There currently are up to three
                pieces of information returned for each right-hand side. If
                componentwise accuracy is not requested (<a href="../man3/PARAMS.3.html">PARAMS</a>(3) = 0.0), then
                ERR_BNDS_COMP is not accessed.  If N_ERR_BNDS &lt; 3, then at most
                the first (:,N_ERR_BNDS) entries are returned.

                The first index in ERR_BNDS_COMP(i,:) corresponds to the ith
                right-hand side.

                The second index in ERR_BNDS_COMP(:,err) contains the following
                three fields:
                err = 1 "Trust/don't trust" boolean. Trust the answer if the
                         reciprocal condition number is less than the threshold
                         sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon').

                err = 2 "Guaranteed" error bound: The estimated forward error,
                         almost certainly within a factor of 10 of the true error
                         so long as the next entry is greater than the threshold
                         sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon'). This error bound should only
                         be trusted if the previous boolean is true.

                err = 3  Reciprocal condition number: Estimated componentwise
                         reciprocal condition number.  Compared with the threshold
                         sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon') to determine if the error
                         estimate is "guaranteed". These reciprocal condition
                         numbers are 1 / (norm(Z^{-1},inf) * norm(Z,inf)) for some
                         appropriately scaled matrix Z.
                         Let Z = S*(A*diag(x)), where x is the solution for the
                         current right-hand side and S scales each row of
                         A*diag(x) by a power of the radix so all absolute row
                         sums of Z are approximately 1.

                     written by the corresponding elements of the tridiagonal
                     matrix T, and the elements below the first subdiagonal, with
                     the array TAU, represent the orthogonal matrix Q as a product
                     of elementary reflectors. See Further Details.

                     LDA is INTEGER
                     The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA &gt;= max(1,N).

                     TAU is REAL array, dimension (N-1)
                     The scalar factors of the elementary reflectors (see Further
                     Details).

             A(1:i-1,i+1), and tau in TAU(i).

             If UPLO = 'L', the matrix Q is represented as a product of elementary

       <b>Purpose:</b>

            SSYTF2 computes the factorization of a real symmetric matrix A using
            the Bunch-Kaufman diagonal pivoting method:

               A = U*D*U**T  or  A = L*D*L**T

            where U (or L) is a product of permutation and unit upper (lower)
            triangular matrices, U**T is the transpose of U, and D is symmetric and
            block diagonal with 1-by-1 and 2-by-2 diagonal blocks.

            This is the unblocked version of the algorithm, calling Level 2 BLAS.

                     A is REAL array, dimension (LDA,N)
                     On entry, the symmetric matrix A.  If UPLO = 'U', the leading
                     n-by-n upper triangular part of A contains the upper
                     triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly lower
                     triangular part of A is not referenced.  If UPLO = 'L', the

                     triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly upper
                     triangular part of A is not referenced.

                     On exit, the block diagonal matrix D and the multipliers used
                     to obtain the factor U or L (see below for further details).

                     LDA is INTEGER
                     The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA &gt;= max(1,N).

                     IPIV is INTEGER array, dimension (N)
                     Details of the interchanges and the block structure of D.

                     If UPLO = 'U':
                        If IPIV(k) &gt; 0, then rows and columns k and IPIV(k) were
                        interchanged and D(k,k) is a 1-by-1 diagonal block.

                        If IPIV(k) = IPIV(k-1) &lt; 0, then rows and columns
                        k-1 and -IPIV(k) were interchanged and D(k-1:k,k-1:k)
                        is a 2-by-2 diagonal block.

                     If UPLO = 'L':
                        If IPIV(k) &gt; 0, then rows and columns k and IPIV(k) were
                        interchanged and D(k,k) is a 1-by-1 diagonal block.

                        If IPIV(k) = IPIV(k+1) &lt; 0, then rows and columns
                        k+1 and -IPIV(k) were interchanged and D(k:k+1,k:k+1)
                        is a 2-by-2 diagonal block.

           <u>INFO</u>

                     INFO is INTEGER
                     = 0: successful exit
                     &lt; 0: if INFO = -k, the k-th argument had an illegal value
                     &gt; 0: if INFO = k, D(k,k) is exactly zero.  The factorization
                          has been completed, but the block diagonal matrix D is
                          exactly singular, and division by zero will occur if it
                          is used to solve a system of equations.

       <b>SSYTF2_ROOK</b> computes the factorization of a real symmetric indefinite matrix using the bounded Bunch-
       Kaufman ('rook') diagonal pivoting method (unblocked algorithm).

       <b>Purpose:</b>

            SSYTF2_ROOK computes the factorization of a real symmetric matrix A
            using the bounded Bunch-Kaufman ("rook") diagonal pivoting method:

               A = U*D*U**T  or  A = L*D*L**T

            where U (or L) is a product of permutation and unit upper (lower)
            triangular matrices, U**T is the transpose of U, and D is symmetric and
            block diagonal with 1-by-1 and 2-by-2 diagonal blocks.

            This is the unblocked version of the algorithm, calling Level 2 BLAS.

                     Specifies whether the upper or lower triangular part of the
                     symmetric matrix A is stored:
                     = 'U':  Upper triangular
                     = 'L':  Lower triangular

           <u>N</u>

                     N is INTEGER

                     A is REAL array, dimension (LDA,N)
                     On entry, the symmetric matrix A.  If UPLO = 'U', the leading
                     n-by-n upper triangular part of A contains the upper
                     triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly lower
                     triangular part of A is not referenced.  If UPLO = 'L', the
                     leading n-by-n lower triangular part of A contains the lower
                     triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly upper
                     triangular part of A is not referenced.

                     On exit, the block diagonal matrix D and the multipliers used
                     to obtain the factor U or L (see below for further details).

           <u>LDA</u>

                     LDA is INTEGER
                     The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA &gt;= max(1,N).

           <u>IPIV</u>

                     IPIV is INTEGER array, dimension (N)
                     Details of the interchanges and the block structure of D.

                     If UPLO = 'U':
                        If IPIV(k) &gt; 0, then rows and columns k and IPIV(k)
                        were interchanged and D(k,k) is a 1-by-1 diagonal block.

                        If IPIV(k) &lt; 0 and IPIV(k-1) &lt; 0, then rows and
                        columns k and -IPIV(k) were interchanged and rows and
                        columns k-1 and -IPIV(k-1) were inerchaged,
                        D(k-1:k,k-1:k) is a 2-by-2 diagonal block.

                     If UPLO = 'L':
                        If IPIV(k) &gt; 0, then rows and columns k and IPIV(k)
                        were interchanged and D(k,k) is a 1-by-1 diagonal block.

                        If IPIV(k) &lt; 0 and IPIV(k+1) &lt; 0, then rows and
                        columns k and -IPIV(k) were interchanged and rows and
                        columns k+1 and -IPIV(k+1) were inerchaged,
                        D(k:k+1,k:k+1) is a 2-by-2 diagonal block.

           <u>INFO</u>

                     INFO is INTEGER
                     = 0: successful exit
                     &lt; 0: if INFO = -k, the k-th argument had an illegal value
                     &gt; 0: if INFO = k, D(k,k) is exactly zero.  The factorization
                          has been completed, but the block diagonal matrix D is
                          exactly singular, and division by zero will occur if it
                          is used to solve a system of equations.

            Q**T * A * Q = T.

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>UPLO</u>

                     UPLO is CHARACTER*1
                     = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;

                     A is REAL array, dimension (LDA,N)
                     On entry, the symmetric matrix A.  If UPLO = 'U', the leading
                     N-by-N upper triangular part of A contains the upper
                     triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly lower
                     triangular part of A is not referenced.  If UPLO = 'L', the

                     On exit, if UPLO = 'U', the diagonal and first superdiagonal
                     of A are overwritten by the corresponding elements of the
                     tridiagonal matrix T, and the elements above the first
                     superdiagonal, with the array TAU, represent the orthogonal
                     matrix Q as a product of elementary reflectors; if UPLO
                     = 'L', the diagonal and first subdiagonal of A are over-
                     written by the corresponding elements of the tridiagonal

                     E is REAL array, dimension (N-1)
                     The off-diagonal elements of the tridiagonal matrix T:
                     E(i) = A(i,i+1) if UPLO = 'U', E(i) = A(i+1,i) if UPLO = 'L'.

           <u>TAU</u>

                     TAU is REAL array, dimension (N-1)
                     The scalar factors of the elementary reflectors (see Further
                     Details).

           <u>WORK</u>

                     WORK is REAL array, dimension (MAX(1,LWORK))
                     On exit, if INFO = 0, <a href="../man1/WORK.1.html">WORK</a>(1) returns the optimal LWORK.

           <u>LWORK</u>

                     LWORK is INTEGER

                     For optimum performance LWORK &gt;= N*NB, where NB is the
                     optimal blocksize.

                     If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine
                     only calculates the optimal size of the WORK array, returns
                     this value as the first entry of the WORK array, and no error
                     message related to LWORK is issued by XERBLA.

       <b>Purpose:</b>

            SSYTRD_2STAGE reduces a real symmetric matrix A to real symmetric
            tridiagonal form T by a orthogonal similarity transformation:
            Q1**T Q2**T* A * Q2 * Q1 = T.

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>VECT</u>

                     VECT is CHARACTER*1
                     = 'N':  No need for the Housholder representation,
                             in particular for the second stage (Band to
                             tridiagonal) and thus LHOUS2 is of size max(1, 4*N);
                     = 'V':  the Householder representation is needed to
                             either generate Q1 Q2 or to apply Q1 Q2,
                             then LHOUS2 is to be queried and computed.

                     On exit, if UPLO = 'U', the band superdiagonal
                     of A are overwritten by the corresponding elements of the
                     internal band-diagonal matrix AB, and the elements above
                     the KD superdiagonal, with the array TAU, represent the orthogonal

                     written by the corresponding elements of the internal band-diagonal
                     matrix AB, and the elements below the KD subdiagonal, with

       <b>SSYTRF</b>

       <b>Purpose:</b>

            SSYTRF computes the factorization of a real symmetric matrix A using
            the Bunch-Kaufman diagonal pivoting method.  The form of the
            factorization is

               A = U**T*D*U  or  A = L*D*L**T

            where U (or L) is a product of permutation and unit upper (lower)
            triangular matrices, and D is symmetric and block diagonal with
            1-by-1 and 2-by-2 diagonal blocks.

            This is the blocked version of the algorithm, calling Level 3 BLAS.

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>UPLO</u>

                     UPLO is CHARACTER*1
                     = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;
                     = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.

           <u>N</u>

                     N is INTEGER
                     The order of the matrix A.  N &gt;= 0.

           <u>A</u>

                     A is REAL array, dimension (LDA,N)
                     On entry, the symmetric matrix A.  If UPLO = 'U', the leading
                     N-by-N upper triangular part of A contains the upper
                     triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly lower
                     triangular part of A is not referenced.  If UPLO = 'L', the
                     leading N-by-N lower triangular part of A contains the lower
                     triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly upper
                     triangular part of A is not referenced.

                     LDA is INTEGER
                     The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA &gt;= max(1,N).

                     IPIV is INTEGER array, dimension (N)
                     Details of the interchanges and the block structure of D.
                     If IPIV(k) &gt; 0, then rows and columns k and IPIV(k) were
                     interchanged and D(k,k) is a 1-by-1 diagonal block.
                     If UPLO = 'U' and IPIV(k) = IPIV(k-1) &lt; 0, then rows and
                     columns k-1 and -IPIV(k) were interchanged and D(k-1:k,k-1:k)
                     is a 2-by-2 diagonal block.  If UPLO = 'L' and IPIV(k) =
                     IPIV(k+1) &lt; 0, then rows and columns k+1 and -IPIV(k) were
                     interchanged and D(k:k+1,k:k+1) is a 2-by-2 diagonal block.

           <u>WORK</u>

                     WORK is REAL array, dimension (MAX(1,LWORK))
                     On exit, if INFO = 0, <a href="../man1/WORK.1.html">WORK</a>(1) returns the optimal LWORK.

           <u>LWORK</u>

                     LWORK is INTEGER
                     The length of WORK.  LWORK &gt;=1.  For best performance
                     LWORK &gt;= N*NB, where NB is the block size returned by ILAENV.

                     If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine
                     only calculates the optimal size of the WORK array, returns
                     this value as the first entry of the WORK array, and no error
                     message related to LWORK is issued by XERBLA.

           <u>INFO</u>

                     INFO is INTEGER
                     = 0:  successful exit
                     &lt; 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
                     &gt; 0:  if INFO = i, D(i,i) is exactly zero.  The factorization
                           has been completed, but the block diagonal matrix D is
                           exactly singular, and division by zero will occur if it
                           is used to solve a system of equations.

       <b>SSYTRF_ROOK</b>

       <b>Purpose:</b>

            SSYTRF_ROOK computes the factorization of a real symmetric matrix A
            using the bounded Bunch-Kaufman ("rook") diagonal pivoting method.
            The form of the factorization is

               A = U*D*U**T  or  A = L*D*L**T

            where U (or L) is a product of permutation and unit upper (lower)
            triangular matrices, and D is symmetric and block diagonal with
            1-by-1 and 2-by-2 diagonal blocks.

            This is the blocked version of the algorithm, calling Level 3 BLAS.

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>UPLO</u>

                     UPLO is CHARACTER*1
                     = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;
                     = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.

           <u>N</u>

                     N is INTEGER
                     The order of the matrix A.  N &gt;= 0.

                     A is REAL array, dimension (LDA,N)
                     On entry, the symmetric matrix A.  If UPLO = 'U', the leading
                     N-by-N upper triangular part of A contains the upper
                     triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly lower
                     triangular part of A is not referenced.  If UPLO = 'L', the
                     leading N-by-N lower triangular part of A contains the lower
                     triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly upper
                     triangular part of A is not referenced.

                     Details of the interchanges and the block structure of D.

                     If UPLO = 'U':
                          If IPIV(k) &gt; 0, then rows and columns k and IPIV(k)
                          were interchanged and D(k,k) is a 1-by-1 diagonal block.

                          If IPIV(k) &lt; 0 and IPIV(k-1) &lt; 0, then rows and
                          columns k and -IPIV(k) were interchanged and rows and
                          columns k-1 and -IPIV(k-1) were inerchaged,
                          D(k-1:k,k-1:k) is a 2-by-2 diagonal block.

                     If UPLO = 'L':
                          If IPIV(k) &gt; 0, then rows and columns k and IPIV(k)
                          were interchanged and D(k,k) is a 1-by-1 diagonal block.

                          If IPIV(k) &lt; 0 and IPIV(k+1) &lt; 0, then rows and
                          columns k and -IPIV(k) were interchanged and rows and
                          columns k+1 and -IPIV(k+1) were inerchaged,
                          D(k:k+1,k:k+1) is a 2-by-2 diagonal block.

           <u>WORK</u>

                     WORK is REAL array, dimension (MAX(1,LWORK)).
                     On exit, if INFO = 0, <a href="../man1/WORK.1.html">WORK</a>(1) returns the optimal LWORK.

           <u>LWORK</u>

                     LWORK is INTEGER
                     The length of WORK.  LWORK &gt;=1.  For best performance
                     LWORK &gt;= N*NB, where NB is the block size returned by ILAENV.

                     If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine
                     only calculates the optimal size of the WORK array, returns
                     this value as the first entry of the WORK array, and no error
                     message related to LWORK is issued by XERBLA.

           <u>INFO</u>

                     INFO is INTEGER
                     = 0:  successful exit
                     &lt; 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
                     &gt; 0:  if INFO = i, D(i,i) is exactly zero.  The factorization
                           has been completed, but the block diagonal matrix D is
                           exactly singular, and division by zero will occur if it
                           is used to solve a system of equations.

                     Note that A is input / output. This might be counter-intuitive,
                     and one may think that A is input only. A is input / output. This
                     is because, at the start of the subroutine, we permute A in a

                     the end.

       <b>STGSYL</b>

       <b>Purpose:</b>

            STGSYL solves the generalized Sylvester equation:

                        A * R - L * B = scale * C                 (1)
                        D * R - L * E = scale * F

            where R and L are unknown m-by-n matrices, (A, D), (B, E) and
            (C, F) are given matrix pairs of size m-by-m, n-by-n and m-by-n,
            respectively, with real entries. (A, D) and (B, E) must be in
            generalized (real) Schur canonical form, i.e. A, B are upper quasi
            triangular and D, E are upper triangular.

            The solution (R, L) overwrites (C, F). 0 &lt;= SCALE &lt;= 1 is an output
            scaling factor chosen to avoid overflow.

            In matrix notation (1) is equivalent to solve  Zx = scale b, where
            Z is defined as

                       Z = [ kron(In, A)  -kron(B**T, Im) ]         (2)
                           [ kron(In, D)  -kron(E**T, Im) ].

            Here Ik is the identity matrix of size k and X**T is the transpose of
            X. kron(X, Y) is the Kronecker product between the matrices X and Y.

            If TRANS = 'T', STGSYL solves the transposed system Z**T*y = scale*b,
            which is equivalent to solve for R and L in

                        A**T * R + D**T * L = scale * C           (3)
                        R * B**T + L * E**T = scale * -F

            This case (TRANS = 'T') is used to compute an one-norm-based estimate
            of Dif[(A,D), (B,E)], the separation between the matrix pairs (A,D)
            and (B,E), using SLACON.

            If IJOB &gt;= 1, STGSYL computes a Frobenius norm-based estimate
            of Dif[(A,D),(B,E)]. That is, the reciprocal of a lower bound on the
            reciprocal of the smallest singular value of Z. See [1-2] for more
            information.

            This is a level 3 BLAS algorithm.

       <b>STRSYL</b>

       <b>Purpose:</b>

            STRSYL solves the real Sylvester matrix equation:

               op(A)*X + X*op(B) = scale*C or
               op(A)*X - X*op(B) = scale*C,

            where op(A) = A or A**T, and  A and B are both upper quasi-
            triangular. A is M-by-M and B is N-by-N; the right hand side C and
            the solution X are M-by-N; and scale is an output scale factor, set
            &lt;= 1 to avoid overflow in X.

            A and B must be in Schur canonical form (as returned by SHSEQR), that
            is, block upper triangular with 1-by-1 and 2-by-2 diagonal blocks;
            each 2-by-2 diagonal block has its diagonal elements equal and its
            off-diagonal elements of opposite sign.

                     The upper quasi-triangular matrix A, in Schur canonical form.

           <u>LDA</u>

                     LDA is INTEGER
                     The leading dimension of the array A. LDA &gt;= max(1,M).

           <u>B</u>

                     B is REAL array, dimension (LDB,N)
                     The upper quasi-triangular matrix B, in Schur canonical form.

           <u>LDB</u>

                     LDB is INTEGER
                     The leading dimension of the array B. LDB &gt;= max(1,N).

           <u>C</u>

                     C is REAL array, dimension (LDC,N)
                     On entry, the M-by-N right hand side matrix C.
                     On exit, C is overwritten by the solution matrix X.

           <u>LDC</u>

                     LDC is INTEGER
                     The leading dimension of the array C. LDC &gt;= max(1,M)

           <u>SCALE</u>

                     SCALE is REAL
                     The scale factor, scale, set &lt;= 1 to avoid overflow in X.

           <u>INFO</u>

                     INFO is INTEGER
                     = 0: successful exit
                     &lt; 0: if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
                     = 1: A and B have common or very close eigenvalues; perturbed
                          values were used to solve the equation (but the matrices
                          A and B are unchanged).
