       <b>CLAHR2</b> reduces the specified number of first columns of a general rectangular matrix A so that elements
       below the specified subdiagonal are zero, and returns auxiliary matrices which are needed to apply the
       transformation to the unreduced part of A.

       <b>Purpose:</b>

            CLAHR2 reduces the first NB columns of A complex general n-BY-(n-k+1)
            matrix A so that elements below the k-th subdiagonal are zero. The
            reduction is performed by an unitary similarity transformation
            Q**H * A * Q. The routine returns the matrices V and T which determine
            Q as a block reflector I - V*T*v**H, and also the matrix Y = A * V * T.

            This is an auxiliary routine called by CGEHRD.

       <b>Parameters</b>

                     K &lt; N.

                     elements of the reduced matrix; the elements below the k-th
                     subdiagonal, with the array TAU, represent the matrix Q as a
                     product of elementary reflectors. The other columns of A are

       <b>Further</b> <b>Details:</b>

             The matrix Q is represented as a product of nb elementary reflectors

                Q = <a href="../man1/H.1.html">H</a>(1) <a href="../man2/H.2.html">H</a>(2) . . . H(nb).

             Each H(i) has the form

                H(i) = I - tau * v * v**H

             where tau is a complex scalar, and v is a complex vector with
             v(1:i+k-1) = 0, v(i+k) = 1; v(i+k+1:n) is stored on exit in
             A(i+k+1:n,i), and tau in TAU(i).

             The elements of the vectors v together form the (n-k+1)-by-nb matrix
             V which is needed, with T and Y, to apply the transformation to the
             unreduced part of the matrix, using an update of the form:
             A := (I - V*T*V**H) * (A - Y*V**H).

             The contents of A on exit are illustrated by the following example
             with n = 7, k = 3 and nb = 2:

                ( a   a   a   a   a )
                ( a   a   a   a   a )
                ( a   a   a   a   a )
                ( h   h   a   a   a )
                ( v1  h   a   a   a )
                ( v1  v2  a   a   a )
                ( v1  v2  a   a   a )

             where a denotes an element of the original matrix A, h denotes a
             modified element of the upper Hessenberg matrix H, and vi denotes an
             element of the vector defining H(i).

             This subroutine is a slight modification of LAPACK-3.0's CLAHRD
             incorporating improvements proposed by Quintana-Orti and Van de
             Gejin. Note that the entries of A(1:K,2:NB) differ from those
             returned by the original LAPACK-3.0's CLAHRD routine. (This
             subroutine is not backward compatible with LAPACK-3.0's CLAHRD.)

             v(1:i+k-1) = 0, v(i+k) = 1; v(i+k+1:n) is stored on exit in
             A(i+k+1:n,i), and tau in TAU(i).

             The elements of the vectors v together form the (n-k+1)-by-nb matrix
             V which is needed, with T and Y, to apply the transformation to the
             unreduced part of the matrix, using an update of the form:
             A := (I - V*T*V**T) * (A - Y*V**T).

             The contents of A on exit are illustrated by the following example
             with n = 7, k = 3 and nb = 2:

                ( a   a   a   a   a )
                ( a   a   a   a   a )
                ( a   a   a   a   a )
                ( h   h   a   a   a )
                ( v1  h   a   a   a )
                ( v1  v2  a   a   a )
                ( v1  v2  a   a   a )

             where a denotes an element of the original matrix A, h denotes a
             modified element of the upper Hessenberg matrix H, and vi denotes an
             element of the vector defining H(i).

             This subroutine is a slight modification of LAPACK-3.0's SLAHRD
             incorporating improvements proposed by Quintana-Orti and Van de
             Gejin. Note that the entries of A(1:K,2:NB) differ from those
             returned by the original LAPACK-3.0's SLAHRD routine. (This
             subroutine is not backward compatible with LAPACK-3.0's SLAHRD.)

       <b>ZLAHR2</b> reduces the specified number of first columns of a general rectangular matrix A so that elements
       below the specified subdiagonal are zero, and returns auxiliary matrices which are needed to apply the
       transformation to the unreduced part of A.

       <b>Purpose:</b>

            ZLAHR2 reduces the first NB columns of A complex general n-BY-(n-k+1)
            matrix A so that elements below the k-th subdiagonal are zero. The
            reduction is performed by an unitary similarity transformation
            Q**H * A * Q. The routine returns the matrices V and T which determine
            Q as a block reflector I - V*T*V**H, and also the matrix Y = A * V * T.

            This is an auxiliary routine called by ZGEHRD.

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>N</u>

                     N is INTEGER
                     The order of the matrix A.

           <u>K</u>

                     K is INTEGER
                     The offset for the reduction. Elements below the k-th
                     subdiagonal in the first NB columns are reduced to zero.
                     K &lt; N.

           <u>NB</u>

                     NB is INTEGER
                     The number of columns to be reduced.

           <u>A</u>

                     A is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDA,N-K+1)
                     On entry, the n-by-(n-k+1) general matrix A.
                     On exit, the elements on and above the k-th subdiagonal in
                     the first NB columns are overwritten with the corresponding
                     elements of the reduced matrix; the elements below the k-th
                     subdiagonal, with the array TAU, represent the matrix Q as a
                     product of elementary reflectors. The other columns of A are
                     unchanged. See Further Details.

                     The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA &gt;= max(1,N).

           <u>TAU</u>

                     TAU is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (NB)
                     The scalar factors of the elementary reflectors. See Further
                     Details.

           <u>T</u>

                     T is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDT,NB)
                     The upper triangular matrix T.

           <u>Y</u>

                     Y is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDY,NB)
                     The n-by-nb matrix Y.

           <u>LDY</u>

                     LDY is INTEGER
                     The leading dimension of the array Y. LDY &gt;= N.

       <b>Further</b> <b>Details:</b>

             The matrix Q is represented as a product of nb elementary reflectors

                Q = <a href="../man1/H.1.html">H</a>(1) <a href="../man2/H.2.html">H</a>(2) . . . H(nb).

             Each H(i) has the form

                H(i) = I - tau * v * v**H

             where tau is a complex scalar, and v is a complex vector with
             v(1:i+k-1) = 0, v(i+k) = 1; v(i+k+1:n) is stored on exit in
             A(i+k+1:n,i), and tau in TAU(i).

             The elements of the vectors v together form the (n-k+1)-by-nb matrix
             V which is needed, with T and Y, to apply the transformation to the
             unreduced part of the matrix, using an update of the form:
             A := (I - V*T*V**H) * (A - Y*V**H).

             with n = 7, k = 3 and nb = 2:

                ( v1  v2  a   a   a )
                ( v1  v2  a   a   a )

             where a denotes an element of the original matrix A, h denotes a
             modified element of the upper Hessenberg matrix H, and vi denotes an
             element of the vector defining H(i).
