</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       B::Concise - Walk Perl syntax tree, printing concise info about ops

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           perl -MO=Concise[,OPTIONS] foo.pl

           use B::Concise qw(set_style add_callback);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This compiler backend prints the internal OPs of a Perl program's syntax tree in one of several space-
       efficient text formats suitable for debugging the inner workings of perl or other compiler backends. It
       can print OPs in the order they appear in the OP tree, in the order they will execute, or in a text
       approximation to their tree structure, and the format of the information displayed is customizable. Its
       function is similar to that of perl's <b>-Dx</b> debugging flag or the <b>B::Terse</b> module, but it is more
       sophisticated and flexible.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       Here's two outputs (or 'renderings'), using the -exec and -basic (i.e. default) formatting conventions on
       the same code snippet.

           % perl -MO=Concise,-exec -e '$a = $b + 42'
           1  &lt;0&gt; enter
           2  &lt;;&gt; nextstate(main 1 -e:1) v
           3  &lt;#&gt; gvsv[*b] s
           4  &lt;$&gt; const[IV 42] s
        *  5  &lt;2&gt; add[t3] sK/2
           6  &lt;#&gt; gvsv[*a] s
           7  &lt;2&gt; sassign vKS/2
           8  &lt;@&gt; leave[1 ref] vKP/REFC

       In this -exec rendering, each opcode is executed in the order shown.  The add opcode, marked with '*', is
       discussed in more detail.

       The 1st column is the op's sequence number, starting at 1, and is displayed in base 36 by default.  Here
       they're purely linear; the sequences are very helpful when looking at code with loops and branches.

       The symbol between angle brackets indicates the op's type, for example; &lt;2&gt; is a BINOP, &lt;@&gt; a LISTOP, and
       &lt;#&gt; is a PADOP, which is used in threaded perls. (see "OP class abbreviations").

       The opname, as in <b>'add[t1]'</b>, may be followed by op-specific information in parentheses or brackets (ex
       <b>'[t1]'</b>).

       The op-flags (ex <b>'sK/2'</b>) are described in ("OP flags abbreviations").

           % perl -MO=Concise -e '$a = $b + 42'
           8  &lt;@&gt; leave[1 ref] vKP/REFC -&gt;(end)
           1     &lt;0&gt; enter -&gt;2
           2     &lt;;&gt; nextstate(main 1 -e:1) v -&gt;3
           7     &lt;2&gt; sassign vKS/2 -&gt;8
        *  5        &lt;2&gt; add[t1] sK/2 -&gt;6
           -           &lt;1&gt; ex-rv2sv sK/1 -&gt;4
           3              &lt;$&gt; gvsv(*b) s -&gt;4
           4           &lt;$&gt; const(IV 42) s -&gt;5
           -        &lt;1&gt; ex-rv2sv sKRM*/1 -&gt;7
           6           &lt;$&gt; gvsv(*a) s -&gt;7

       The default rendering is top-down, so they're not in execution order.  This form reflects the way the
       stack is used to parse and evaluate expressions; the add operates on the two terms below it in the tree.

       Nullops appear as "ex-opname", where <u>opname</u> is an op that has been optimized away by perl.  They're
       displayed with a sequence-number of '-', because they are not executed (they don't appear in previous
       example), they're printed here because they reflect the parse.

       The arrow points to the sequence number of the next op; they're not displayed in -exec mode, for obvious
       reasons.

       Note that because this rendering was done on a non-threaded perl, the PADOPs in the previous examples are
       now SVOPs, and some (but not all) of the square brackets have been replaced by round ones.  This is a
       subtle feature to provide some visual distinction between renderings on threaded and un-threaded perls.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Arguments that don't start with a hyphen are taken to be the names of subroutines or formats to render;
       if no such functions are specified, the main body of the program (outside any subroutines, and not
       including use'd or require'd files) is rendered.  Passing "BEGIN", "UNITCHECK", "CHECK", "INIT", or "END"
       will cause all of the corresponding special blocks to be printed.  Arguments must follow options.

       Options affect how things are rendered (ie printed).  They're presented here by their visual effect, 1st
       being strongest.  They're grouped according to how they interrelate; within each group the options are
       mutually exclusive (unless otherwise stated).

   <b>Options</b> <b>for</b> <b>Opcode</b> <b>Ordering</b>
       These options control the 'vertical display' of opcodes.  The display 'order' is also called 'mode'
       elsewhere in this document.

       <b>-basic</b>
           Print  OPs  in the order they appear in the OP tree (a preorder traversal, starting at the root). The
           indentation of each OP shows its level in the tree, and the '-&gt;' at the end of the line indicates the
           next opcode in execution order.  This mode is the  default,  so  the  flag  is  included  simply  for
           completeness.

       <b>-exec</b>
           Print  OPs  in  the  order  they  would  normally  execute  (for the majority of constructs this is a
           postorder traversal of the tree, ending at the root). In most cases the OP  that  usually  follows  a
           given OP will appear directly below it; alternate paths are shown by indentation. In cases like loops
           when control jumps out of a linear path, a 'goto' line is generated.

       <b>-tree</b>
           Print  OPs  in  a  text  approximation  of  a  tree,  with  the  root  of  the  tree  at the left and
           'left-to-right' order of children transformed into 'top-to-bottom'. Because this mode grows  both  to
           the right and down, it isn't suitable for large programs (unless you have a very wide terminal).

   <b>Options</b> <b>for</b> <b>Line-Style</b>
       These options select the line-style (or just style) used to render each opcode, and dictates what info is
       actually printed into each line.

       <b>-concise</b>
           Use the author's favorite set of formatting conventions. This is the default, of course.

       <b>-terse</b>
           Use  formatting  conventions  that  emulate  the  output  of  <b>B::Terse</b>.  The  basic  mode  is  almost
           indistinguishable from the real <b>B::Terse</b>, and the exec mode looks very similar,  but  is  in  a  more
           logical  order  and lacks curly brackets. <b>B::Terse</b> doesn't have a tree mode, so the tree mode is only
           vaguely reminiscent of <b>B::Terse</b>.

       <b>-linenoise</b>
           Use formatting conventions in which the name of each OP, rather than being written out  in  full,  is
           represented by a one- or two-character abbreviation.  This is mainly a joke.

       <b>-debug</b>
           Use formatting conventions reminiscent of CPAN module <b>B::Debug</b>; these aren't very concise at all.

       <b>-env</b>
           Use    formatting    conventions    read   from   the   environment   variables   "B_CONCISE_FORMAT",
           "B_CONCISE_GOTO_FORMAT", and "B_CONCISE_TREE_FORMAT".

   <b>Options</b> <b>for</b> <b>tree-specific</b> <b>formatting</b>
       <b>-compact</b>
           Use a tree format in which the minimum amount of space is used for the lines  connecting  nodes  (one
           character in most cases). This squeezes out a few precious columns of screen real estate.

       <b>-loose</b>
           Use  a tree format that uses longer edges to separate OP nodes. This format tends to look better than
           the compact one, especially in ASCII, and is the default.

       <b>-vt</b> Use tree connecting characters drawn from the VT100 line-drawing set.   This  looks  better  if  your
           terminal supports it.

       <b>-ascii</b>
           Draw the tree with standard ASCII characters like "+" and "|". These don't look as clean as the VT100
           characters,  but  they'll work with almost any terminal (or the horizontal scrolling mode of <b><a href="../man1/less.1.html">less</a></b>(1))
           and are suitable for text documentation or email. This is the default.

       These are pairwise exclusive, i.e. compact or loose, vt or ascii.

   <b>Options</b> <b>controlling</b> <b>sequence</b> <b>numbering</b>
       <b>-base</b><u>n</u>
           Print OP sequence numbers in base <u>n</u>. If <u>n</u> is greater than 10, the digit for 11 will be  'a',  and  so
           on. If <u>n</u> is greater than 36, the digit for 37 will be 'A', and so on until 62. Values greater than 62
           are not currently supported. The default is 36.

       <b>-bigendian</b>
           Print sequence numbers with the most significant digit first. This is the usual convention for Arabic
           numerals, and the default.

       <b>-littleendian</b>
           Print  sequence numbers with the least significant digit first.  This is obviously mutually exclusive
           with bigendian.

   <b>Other</b> <b>options</b>
       <b>-src</b>
           With this option, the rendering of each statement (starting with the nextstate OP) will  be  preceded
           by the 1st line of source code that generates it.  For example:

               1  &lt;0&gt; enter
               # 1: my $i;
               2  &lt;;&gt; nextstate(main 1 junk.pl:1) v:{
               3  &lt;0&gt; padsv[$i:1,10] vM/LVINTRO
               # 3: for $i (0..9) {
               4  &lt;;&gt; nextstate(main 3 junk.pl:3) v:{
               5  &lt;0&gt; pushmark s
               6  &lt;$&gt; const[IV 0] s
               7  &lt;$&gt; const[IV 9] s
               8  &lt;{&gt; enteriter(next-&gt;j last-&gt;m redo-&gt;9)[$i:1,10] lKS
               k  &lt;0&gt; iter s
               l  &lt;|&gt; and(other-&gt;9) vK/1
               # 4:     print "line ";
               9      &lt;;&gt; nextstate(main 2 junk.pl:4) v
               a      &lt;0&gt; pushmark s
               b      &lt;$&gt; const[PV "line "] s
               c      &lt;@&gt; print vK
               # 5:     print "$i\n";
               ...

       <b>-stash="somepackage"</b>
           With  this,  "somepackage"  will  be  required,  then  the  stash  is inspected, and each function is
           rendered.

       The following options are pairwise exclusive.

       <b>-main</b>
           Include the main program in the output, even if subroutines were also specified.  This  rendering  is
           normally suppressed when a subroutine name or reference is given.

       <b>-nomain</b>
           This  restores  the default behavior after you've changed it with '-main' (it's not normally needed).
           If no subroutine name/ref is given, main is rendered, regardless of this flag.

       <b>-nobanner</b>
           Renderings usually include a banner line identifying the function name or stringified  subref.   This
           suppresses the printing of the banner.

           TBC:  Remove  the  stringified  coderef; while it provides a 'cookie' for each function rendered, the
           cookies used should be 1,2,3.. not a random hex-address.  It also complicates  string  comparison  of
           two different trees.

       <b>-banner</b>
           restores default banner behavior.

       <b>-banneris</b> =&gt; subref
           TBC:  a  hookpoint  (and  an  option  to  set  it)  for  a user-supplied function to produce a banner
           appropriate for users needs.  It's not ideal, because the  rendering-state  variables,  which  are  a
           natural candidate for use in concise.t, are unavailable to the user.

   <b>Option</b> <b>Stickiness</b>
       If  you  invoke Concise more than once in a program, you should know that the options are 'sticky'.  This
       means that the options you provide in the first call will be remembered for the 2nd call, unless you  re-
       specify or change them.

</pre><h4><b>ABBREVIATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The  concise  style  uses symbols to convey maximum info with minimal clutter (like hex addresses).  With
       just a little practice, you can start to see the flowers, not just the branches, in the trees.

   <b>OP</b> <b>class</b> <b>abbreviations</b>
       These symbols appear before the op-name, and indicate the B:: namespace that represents the ops  in  your
       Perl code.

           1      UNOP             An OP with one child

           .      METHOP           An OP with method call info

   <b>OP</b> <b>flags</b> <b>abbreviations</b>
       OP  flags are either public or private.  The public flags alter the behavior of each opcode in consistent
       ways, and are represented by 0 or more single characters.

           v      OPf_WANT_VOID    Want nothing (void context)
           s      OPf_WANT_SCALAR  Want single value (scalar context)
           l      OPf_WANT_LIST    Want list of any length (list context)
                                   Want is unknown
           K      OPf_KIDS         There is a firstborn child.
           P      OPf_PARENS       This operator was parenthesized.
                                    (Or block needs explicit scope entry.)
           R      OPf_REF          Certified reference.
                                    (Return container, not containee).
           M      OPf_MOD          Will modify (lvalue).
           S      OPf_STACKED      Some arg is arriving on the stack.
           *      OPf_SPECIAL      Do something weird for this op (see op.h)

       Private flags, if any are set for an opcode, are displayed after a '/'

           8  &lt;@&gt; leave[1 ref] vKP/REFC -&gt;(end)
           7     &lt;2&gt; sassign vKS/2 -&gt;8

       They're opcode specific, and occur less often than the public  ones,  so  they're  represented  by  short
       mnemonics instead of single-chars; see B::Op_private and <u>regen/op_private</u> for more details.

       Note  that  a  number after a '/' often indicates the number of arguments.  In the <u>sassign</u> example above,
       the OP takes 2 arguments. These values are sometimes used at runtime: in  particular,  the  MAXARG  macro
       makes use of them.

</pre><h4><b>FORMATTING</b> <b>SPECIFICATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       For  each  line-style  ('concise', 'terse', 'linenoise', etc.) there are 3 format-specs which control how
       OPs are rendered.

       The first is the 'default' format, which is used in both basic and exec modes to print all opcodes.   The
       2nd,  goto-format, is used in exec mode when branches are encountered.  They're not real opcodes, and are
       inserted to look like a closing curly brace.  The tree-format is tree specific.

       When a line is rendered, the correct format-spec is copied and scanned for the following items;  data  is
       substituted in, and other manipulations like basic indenting are done, for each opcode rendered.

       There  are  3  kinds  of items that may be populated; special patterns, #vars, and literal text, which is
       copied verbatim.  (Yes, it's a set of s///g steps.)

   <b>Special</b> <b>Patterns</b>
       These items are the primitives used to perform indenting, and to select text from amongst alternatives.

       <b>(x(</b><u>exec_text</u><b>;</b><u>basic_text</u><b>)x)</b>
           Generates <u>exec_text</u> in exec mode, or <u>basic_text</u> in basic mode.

       <b>(*(</b><u>text</u><b>)*)</b>
           Generates one copy of <u>text</u> for each indentation level.

       <b>(*(</b><u>text1</u><b>;</b><u>text2</u><b>)*)</b>
           Generates one fewer copies of <u>text1</u> than the indentation level, followed by one copy of <u>text2</u> if  the
           indentation level is more than 0.

       <b>(?(</b><u>text1</u><b>#</b><u>varText2</u><b>)?)</b>
           If  the  value of <u>var</u> is true (not empty or zero), generates the value of <u>var</u> surrounded by <u>text1</u> and
           <u>Text2</u>, otherwise nothing.

       <b>~</b>   Any number of tildes and surrounding whitespace will be collapsed to a single space.

   <b>#</b> <b>Variables</b>
       These #vars represent opcode properties that you may want as part of your rendering.  The '#' is intended
       as a private sigil; a #var's value is interpolated into the style-line, much like "read $this".

       These vars take 3 forms:

       <b>#</b><u>var</u>
           A property named 'var' is assumed to exist for the opcodes, and is interpolated into the rendering.

       <b>#</b><u>varN</u>
           Generates the value of <u>var</u>, left justified to fill <u>N</u> spaces.  Note that this means while you can have
           properties 'foo' and 'foo2', you cannot render 'foo2', but you could with 'foo2a'.  You would be wise
           not to rely on this behavior going forward ;-)

       <b>#</b><u>Var</u>
           This ucfirst form of #var generates a tag-value form of itself for display; it converts '#Var' into a
           'Var =&gt; #var' style, which is then handled as described above.  (Imp-note: #Vars cannot be  used  for
           conditional-fills, because the =&gt; #var transform is done after the check for #Var's value).

       The  following  variables  are  'defined'  by B::Concise; when they are used in a style, their respective
       values are plugged into the rendering of each opcode.

       Only some of these are used by the standard styles, the others are provided for you to delve into  optree
       mechanics,  should  you wish to add a new style (see "add_style" below) that uses them.  You can also add
       new ones using "add_callback".

       <b>#addr</b>
           The address of the OP, in hexadecimal.

       <b>#arg</b>
           The OP-specific information of the OP (such as the SV for an SVOP, the non-local exit pointers for  a
           LOOP, etc.) enclosed in parentheses.

       <b>#class</b>
           The B-determined class of the OP, in all caps.

       <b>#classsym</b>
           A single symbol abbreviating the class of the OP.

       <b>#coplabel</b>
           The label of the statement or block the OP is the start of, if any.

       <b>#exname</b>
           The name of the OP, or 'ex-foo' if the OP is a null that used to be a foo.

       <b>#extarg</b>
           The target of the OP, or nothing for a nulled OP.

       <b>#firstaddr</b>
           The address of the OP's first child, in hexadecimal.

       <b>#flags</b>
           The OP's flags, abbreviated as a series of symbols.

       <b>#flagval</b>

</pre><h4><b>One-Liner</b> <b>Command</b> <b>tips</b></h4><pre>
       perl -MO=Concise,bar foo.pl
           Renders only <b>bar()</b> from foo.pl.  To see main, drop the ',bar'.  To see both, add ',-main'

       perl -MDigest::MD5=md5 -MO=Concise,md5 -e1
           Identifies md5 as an XS function.  The export is needed so that BC can find it in main.

       perl -MPOSIX -MO=Concise,_POSIX_ARG_MAX -e1
           Identifies  _POSIX_ARG_MAX  as  a  constant  sub,  optimized to an IV.  Although POSIX isn't entirely
           consistent across platforms, this is likely to be present in virtually all of them.

       perl -MPOSIX -MO=Concise,a -e 'print _POSIX_SAVED_IDS'
           This renders a print statement, which includes a call to the function.  It's identical to rendering a
           file with a use call and that single  statement,  except  for  the  filename  which  appears  in  the
           nextstate ops.

       perl -MPOSIX -MO=Concise,a -e 'sub a{_POSIX_SAVED_IDS}'
           This  is  <b>very</b> similar to previous, only the first two ops differ.  This subroutine rendering is more
           representative, insofar as a single main program will have many subs.

       perl -MB::Concise -e 'B::Concise::compile("-exec","-src", \%B::Concise::)-&gt;()'
           This renders all functions in the B::Concise package  with  the  source  lines.   It  eschews  the  O
           framework  so  that  the stashref can be passed directly to <b>B::Concise::compile()</b>.  See -stash option
           for a more convenient way to render a package.

</pre><h4><b>Using</b> <b>B::Concise</b> <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>O</b> <b>framework</b></h4><pre>
       The common (and original) usage of B::Concise was for command-line renderings of simple code, as given in
       EXAMPLE.  But you can also use <b>B::Concise</b> from your code, and call <b>compile()</b>  directly,  and  repeatedly.
       By  doing  so,  you  can avoid the compile-time only operation of O.pm, and even use the debugger to step
       through <b>B::Concise::compile()</b> itself.

       Once you're doing this, you may alter Concise output by adding new rendering styles,  and  by  optionally
       adding  callback  routines  which populate new variables, if such were referenced from those (just added)
       styles.

   <b>Example:</b> <b>Altering</b> <b>Concise</b> <b>Renderings</b>
           use B::Concise qw(set_style add_callback);
           add_style($yourStyleName =&gt; $defaultfmt, $gotofmt, $treefmt);
           add_callback
             ( sub {
                   my ($h, $op, $format, $level, $stylename) = @_;
                   $h-&gt;{variable} = some_func($op);
               });
           $walker = B::Concise::compile(@options,@subnames,@subrefs);
           $walker-&gt;();

   <b>set_style()</b>
       <b>set_style</b> accepts 3 arguments, and updates the three format-specs comprising  a  line-style  (basic-exec,
       goto, tree).  It has one minor drawback though; it doesn't register the style under a new name.  This can
       become  an  issue if you render more than once and switch styles.  Thus you may prefer to use <b>add_style()</b>
       and/or <b>set_style_standard()</b> instead.

   <b>set_style_standard($name)</b>
       This restores one of the standard line-styles: "terse",  "concise",  "linenoise",  "debug",  "env",  into
       effect.  It also accepts style names previously defined with <b>add_style()</b>.

   <b>add_style</b> <b>()</b>
       This  subroutine accepts a new style name and three style arguments as above, and creates, registers, and
       selects the newly named style.  It is an error to re-add a style;  call  <b>set_style_standard()</b>  to  switch
       between several styles.

   <b>add_callback</b> <b>()</b>
       If your newly minted styles refer to any new #variables, you'll need to define a callback subroutine that
       will populate (or modify) those variables.  They are then available for use in the style you've chosen.

       The  callbacks  are called for each opcode visited by Concise, in the same order as they are added.  Each
       subroutine is passed five parameters.

         1. A hashref, containing the variable names and values which are
            populated into the report-line for the op
         2. the op, as a B&lt;B::OP&gt; object
         3. a reference to the format string
         4. the formatting (indent) level
         5. the selected stylename

       To define your own variables, simply add them to the hash, or change existing values if you need to.  The
       level and format are passed in as references to scalars, but it is unlikely that they  will  need  to  be
       changed or even used.

   <b>Running</b> <b>B::Concise::compile()</b>
       <b>compile</b>  accepts  options  as  described above in "OPTIONS", and arguments, which are either coderefs, or
       subroutine names.

       It constructs and returns a $treewalker coderef, which when invoked, traverses, or walks, and renders the
       optrees of the given arguments to STDOUT.  You can reuse this, and can change the  rendering  style  used
       each time; thereafter the coderef renders in the new style.

       <b>walk_output</b>  lets  you  change  the  print  destination from STDOUT to another open filehandle, or into a
       string passed as a ref (unless you've built perl with -Uuseperlio).

         my $walker = B::Concise::compile('-terse','aFuncName', \&amp;aSubRef); # 1
         walk_output(\my $buf);
         $walker-&gt;();                          # 1 renders -terse
         set_style_standard('concise');        # 2
         $walker-&gt;();                          # 2 renders -concise
         $walker-&gt;(@new);                      # 3 renders whatever
         print "3 different renderings: terse, concise, and @new: $buf\n";

       When $walker is called, it traverses the subroutines supplied when it was created, and renders them using
       the current style.  You can change the style afterwards in several different ways:

         1. call C&lt;compile&gt;, altering style or mode/order
         2. call C&lt;set_style_standard&gt;
         3. call $walker, passing @new options

       Passing new options to the $walker is the easiest way to change amongst any pre-defined styles (the  ones
       you  add  are  automatically recognized as options), and is the only way to alter rendering order without
       calling compile again.  Note however that rendering  state  is  still  shared  amongst  multiple  $walker
       objects, so they must still be used in a coordinated manner.

   <b>B::Concise::reset_sequence()</b>
       This function (not exported) lets you reset the sequence numbers (note that they're numbered arbitrarily,
       their  goal  being  to be human readable).  Its purpose is mostly to support testing, i.e. to compare the
       concise output from two identical anonymous subroutines (but different instances).   Without  the  reset,
       B::Concise, seeing that they're separate optrees, generates different sequence numbers in the output.

   <b>Errors</b>
       Errors  in  rendering  (non-existent  function-name,  non-existent coderef) are written to the STDOUT, or
       wherever you've set it via <b>walk_output()</b>.

       Errors using the various *style* calls, and bad args to <b>walk_output()</b>, result in <b>die()</b>.  Use an  eval  if
       you wish to catch these errors and continue processing.
