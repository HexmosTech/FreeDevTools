</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Test::Taint - Tools to test taintedness

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       Version 1.08

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           taint_checking_ok();        # We have to have taint checking on
           my $id = "deadbeef";        # Dummy session ID
           taint( $id );               # Simulate it coming in from the web
           tainted_ok( $id );
           $id = validate_id( $id );   # Your routine to check the $id
           untainted_ok( $id );        # Did it come back clean?
           ok( defined $id );

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Tainted data is data that comes from an unsafe source, such as the command line, or, in the case of web
       apps, any GET or POST transactions.  Read the perlsec man page for details on why tainted data is bad,
       and how to untaint the data.

       When you're writing unit tests for code that deals with tainted data, you'll want to have a way to
       provide tainted data for your routines to handle, and easy ways to check and report on the taintedness of
       your data, in standard Test::More style.

</pre><h4><b>Test::More"-style</b> <b>Functions</b></h4><pre>
       All the xxx_ok() functions work like standard "Test::More"-style functions, where the last parm is an
       optional message, it outputs ok or not ok, and returns a boolean telling if the test passed.

   <b>taint_checking_ok(</b> <b>[$message]</b> <b>)</b>
       Test::More-style test that taint checking is on.  This should probably be the first thing in any <u>*.t</u> file
       that deals with taintedness.

   <b>tainted_ok(</b> <b>$var</b> <b>[,</b> <b>$message</b> <b>]</b> <b>)</b>
       Checks that <u>$var</u> is tainted.

           tainted_ok( $ENV{FOO} );

   <b>untainted_ok(</b> <b>$var</b> <b>[,</b> <b>$message</b> <b>]</b> <b>)</b>
       Checks that <u>$var</u> is not tainted.

           my $foo = my_validate( $ENV{FOO} );
           untainted_ok( $foo );

   <b>tainted_ok_deeply(</b> <b>$var</b> <b>[,</b> <b>$message</b> <b>]</b> <b>)</b>
       Checks that <u>$var</u> is tainted.  If <u>$var</u> is a reference, it recursively checks every variable to make sure
       they are all tainted.

           tainted_ok_deeply( \%ENV );

   <b>untainted_ok_deeply(</b> <b>$var</b> <b>[,</b> <b>$message</b> <b>]</b> <b>)</b>
       Checks that <u>$var</u> is not tainted.  If <u>$var</u> is a reference, it recursively checks every variable to make
       sure they are all not tainted.

           my %env = my_validate( \%ENV );
           untainted_ok_deeply( \%env );

</pre><h4><b>Helper</b> <b>Functions</b></h4><pre>
       These are all helper functions.  Most are wrapped by an xxx_ok() counterpart, except for "taint" which
       actually does something, instead of just reporting it.

   <b>taint_checking()</b>
       Returns true if taint checking is enabled via the -T flag.

   <b>tainted(</b> <u><b>$var</b></u> <b>)</b>
       Returns boolean saying if $var is tainted.

   <b>tainted_deeply(</b> <u><b>$var</b></u> <b>)</b>
       Returns boolean saying if $var is tainted.  If $var is a reference it recursively checks every variable
       to make sure they are all tainted.

   <b>taint(</b> <b>@list</b> <b>)</b>
       Marks each (apparently) taintable argument in <u>@list</u> as being tainted.

       References can be tainted like any other scalar, but it doesn't make sense to, so they will <b>not</b> be
       tainted by this function.

       Some "tie"d and magical variables may fail to be tainted by this routine, try as it may.

   <b>taint_deeply(</b> <b>@list</b> <b>)</b>
       Similar to "taint", except that if any elements in <u>@list</u> are references, it walks deeply into the data
       structure and marks each taintable argument as being tainted.

       If any variables are "tie"d this will taint all the scalars within the tied object.
