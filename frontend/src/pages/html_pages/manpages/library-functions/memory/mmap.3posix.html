       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       mmap — map pages of memory

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;sys/mman.h&gt;

       void *mmap(void *<u>addr</u>, size_t <u>len</u>, int <u>prot</u>, int <u>flags</u>,
           int <u>fildes</u>, off_t <u>off</u>);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>mmap</u>() function shall establish a mapping between an address space of a process and a memory object.

       The <u>mmap</u>() function shall be supported for the following memory objects:

        *  Regular files

        *  Shared memory objects

        *  Typed memory objects

       Support for any other type of file is unspecified.

       The format of the call is as follows:

           <u>pa</u>=<u>mmap</u>(<u>addr</u>, <u>len</u>, <u>prot</u>, <u>flags</u>, <u>fildes</u>, <u>off</u>);

       The  <u>mmap</u>()  function shall establish a mapping between the address space of the process at an address <u>pa</u>
       for <u>len</u> bytes to the memory object represented by the file descriptor <u>fildes</u> at offset <u>off</u> for <u>len</u> bytes.
       The value of <u>pa</u> is an implementation-defined function of the parameter <u>addr</u>  and  the  values  of  <u>flags</u>,
       further  described  below.  A  successful  <u>mmap</u>()  call  shall return <u>pa</u> as its result. The address range
       starting at <u>pa</u> and continuing for <u>len</u> bytes  shall  be  legitimate  for  the  possible  (not  necessarily
       current)  address  space  of the process. The range of bytes starting at <u>off</u> and continuing for <u>len</u> bytes
       shall be legitimate for the possible (not necessarily current) offsets in the memory  object  represented
       by <u>fildes</u>.

       If  <u>fildes</u>  represents  a typed memory object opened with either the POSIX_TYPED_MEM_ALLOCATE flag or the
       POSIX_TYPED_MEM_ALLOCATE_CONTIG flag, the memory object to be mapped shall be that portion of  the  typed
       memory  object  allocated by the implementation as specified below. In this case, if <u>off</u> is non-zero, the
       behavior of <u>mmap</u>() is undefined. If <u>fildes</u> refers to a valid typed memory object that is  not  accessible
       from the calling process, <u>mmap</u>() shall fail.

       The  mapping  established  by <u>mmap</u>() shall replace any previous mappings for those whole pages containing
       any part of the address space of the process starting at <u>pa</u> and continuing for <u>len</u> bytes.

       If the size of the mapped file changes after the call to <u>mmap</u>() as a result of some  other  operation  on
       the  mapped  file,  the effect of references to portions of the mapped region that correspond to added or
       removed portions of the file is unspecified.

       If <u>len</u> is zero, <u>mmap</u>() shall fail and no mapping shall be established.

       The parameter <u>prot</u> determines whether read, write, execute, or some combination of accesses are permitted
       to the data being mapped. The <u>prot</u> shall be either PROT_NONE or the bitwise-inclusive OR of one  or  more
       of the other flags in the following table, defined in the <u>&lt;sys/mman.h&gt;</u> header.

       If an implementation cannot support the combination of access types specified by <u>prot</u>, the call to <u>mmap</u>()
       shall fail.

       An  implementation  may  permit  accesses other than those specified by <u>prot</u>; however, the implementation
       shall not permit a write to succeed where PROT_WRITE has not been set and shall  not  permit  any  access
       where  PROT_NONE  alone  has  been set. The implementation shall support at least the following values of
       <u>prot</u>: PROT_NONE, PROT_READ, PROT_WRITE, and the bitwise-inclusive OR of  PROT_READ  and  PROT_WRITE.  The
       file  descriptor <u>fildes</u> shall have been opened with read permission, regardless of the protection options
       specified. If PROT_WRITE is specified,  the  application  shall  ensure  that  it  has  opened  the  file
       descriptor  <u>fildes</u>  with  write  permission  unless  MAP_PRIVATE  is  specified in the <u>flags</u> parameter as
       described below.

       The parameter <u>flags</u> provides other information about the handling of the mapped data.  The value of <u>flags</u>
       is the bitwise-inclusive OR of these options, defined in <u>&lt;sys/mman.h&gt;</u>:

       It is implementation-defined whether MAP_FIXED shall be supported.  MAP_FIXED shall be supported on  XSI-
       conformant systems.

       MAP_SHARED  and  MAP_PRIVATE  describe  the  disposition  of  write  references  to the memory object. If
       MAP_SHARED is specified,  write  references  shall  change  the  underlying  object.  If  MAP_PRIVATE  is
       specified,  modifications  to the mapped data by the calling process shall be visible only to the calling
       process and shall not change the underlying object.  It  is  unspecified  whether  modifications  to  the
       underlying  object  done after the MAP_PRIVATE mapping is established are visible through the MAP_PRIVATE
       mapping. Either MAP_SHARED or MAP_PRIVATE can be specified, but not both. The mapping  type  is  retained
       across <u>fork</u>().

       The  state  of  synchronization  objects such as mutexes, semaphores, barriers, and conditional variables
       placed in shared memory mapped with MAP_SHARED becomes undefined when the  last  region  in  any  process
       containing the synchronization object is unmapped.

       When  <u>fildes</u> represents a typed memory object opened with either the POSIX_TYPED_MEM_ALLOCATE flag or the
       POSIX_TYPED_MEM_ALLOCATE_CONTIG flag, <u>mmap</u>() shall, if there are  enough  resources  available,  map  <u>len</u>
       bytes  allocated  from  the  corresponding typed memory object which were not previously allocated to any
       process in any processor that may access that typed memory object. If  there  are  not  enough  resources
       available,  the  function  shall  fail.  If  <u>fildes</u>  represents  a  typed  memory  object opened with the
       POSIX_TYPED_MEM_ALLOCATE_CONTIG flag, these allocated bytes shall be contiguous within the  typed  memory
       object.  If  <u>fildes</u> represents a typed memory object opened with the POSIX_TYPED_MEM_ALLOCATE flag, these
       allocated bytes may be composed of non-contiguous fragments within the typed  memory  object.  If  <u>fildes</u>
       represents  a  typed  memory  object opened with neither the POSIX_TYPED_MEM_ALLOCATE_CONTIG flag nor the
       POSIX_TYPED_MEM_ALLOCATE flag, <u>len</u> bytes starting at offset  <u>off</u>  within  the  typed  memory  object  are
       mapped,  exactly  as  when  mapping a file or shared memory object. In this case, if two processes map an
       area of typed memory using the same <u>off</u> and <u>len</u> values and using file descriptors that refer to the  same
       memory  pool  (either  from  the  same  port or from a different port), both processes shall map the same
       region of storage.

       When MAP_FIXED is set in the <u>flags</u> argument, the implementation is informed that the value of <u>pa</u> shall be
       <u>addr</u>, exactly. If MAP_FIXED is set, <u>mmap</u>() may return  MAP_FAILED  and  set  <u>errno</u>  to  <b>[EINVAL]</b>.   If  a
       MAP_FIXED  request  is  successful,  then  any  previous  mappings  or memory locks for those whole pages
       containing any part of the address range [<u>pa</u>,<u>pa</u>+<u>len</u>) shall be removed, as if by an  appropriate  call  to
       <u>munmap</u>(), before the new mapping is established.

       When  MAP_FIXED is not set, the implementation uses <u>addr</u> in an implementation-defined manner to arrive at
       <u>pa</u>.  The <u>pa</u> so chosen shall be an area of the address space that the implementation deems suitable for  a
       mapping  of  <u>len</u>  bytes  to  the  file.  All implementations interpret an <u>addr</u> value of 0 as granting the
       implementation complete freedom in selecting <u>pa</u>, subject to constraints described below. A non-zero value
       of <u>addr</u> is taken to be a suggestion of a process address near which the mapping should  be  placed.  When
       the  implementation  selects  a value for <u>pa</u>, it never places a mapping at address 0, nor does it replace
       any extant mapping.

       If MAP_FIXED is specified and <u>addr</u> is non-zero, it shall have the same remainder as  the  <u>off</u>  parameter,
       modulo  the  page  size  as  returned  by  <u>sysconf</u>()  when  passed  _SC_PAGESIZE  or  _SC_PAGE_SIZE.  The
       implementation may require that off is a multiple of the  page  size.  If  MAP_FIXED  is  specified,  the
       implementation  may  require  that  <u>addr</u>  is  a  multiple  of  the page size. The system performs mapping
       operations over whole pages. Thus, while the parameter <u>len</u> need not meet a size or alignment  constraint,
       the  system  shall  include,  in  any  mapping operation, any partial page specified by the address range
       starting at <u>pa</u> and continuing for <u>len</u> bytes.

       The system shall always zero-fill any partial page at the end of an object.  Further,  the  system  shall
       never write out any modified portions of the last page of an object which are beyond its end.  References
       within  the address range starting at <u>pa</u> and continuing for <u>len</u> bytes to whole pages following the end of
       an object shall result in delivery of a SIGBUS signal.

       An implementation may generate SIGBUS signals when a reference would cause an error in the mapped object,
       such as out-of-space condition.

       The <u>mmap</u>() function shall add an extra reference to the file associated with the file  descriptor  <u>fildes</u>
       which  is  not  removed  by a subsequent <u>close</u>() on that file descriptor. This reference shall be removed
       when there are no more mappings to the file.

       The last data access timestamp of the mapped file may be marked for update at any time between the <u>mmap</u>()
       call and the corresponding <u>munmap</u>() call. The initial read or write reference to a  mapped  region  shall
       cause the file's last data access timestamp to be marked for update if it has not already been marked for
       update.

       The  last  data  modification  and  last  file  status  change  timestamps  of a file that is mapped with
       MAP_SHARED and PROT_WRITE shall be marked for update at some  point  in  the  interval  between  a  write
       reference  to the mapped region and the next call to <u>msync</u>() with MS_ASYNC or MS_SYNC for that portion of
       the file by any process.  If there is no such call and if the underlying file is modified as a result  of
       a  write  reference,  then  these  timestamps  shall  be  marked  for update at some time after the write
       reference.

       There may be implementation-defined limits on the number of  memory  regions  that  can  be  mapped  (per
       process or per system).

       If  such  a  limit  is  imposed,  whether the number of memory regions that can be mapped by a process is
       decreased by the use of <u>shmat</u>() is implementation-defined.

       If <u>mmap</u>() fails for reasons other than <b>[EBADF]</b>, <b>[EINVAL]</b>, or <b>[ENOTSUP]</b>,  some  of  the  mappings  in  the
       address range starting at <u>addr</u> and continuing for <u>len</u> bytes may have been unmapped.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       Upon  successful completion, the <u>mmap</u>() function shall return the address at which the mapping was placed
       (<u>pa</u>); otherwise, it shall return a value of MAP_FAILED and set <u>errno</u> to indicate the  error.  The  symbol
       MAP_FAILED is defined in the <u>&lt;sys/mman.h&gt;</u> header. No successful return from <u>mmap</u>() shall return the value
       MAP_FAILED.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>mmap</u>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EACCES</b> The <u>fildes</u> argument is not open for read, regardless of the protection specified, or <u>fildes</u> is not
              open for write and PROT_WRITE was specified for a MAP_SHARED type mapping.

       <b>EAGAIN</b> The mapping could not be locked in memory, if required by <u>mlockall</u>(), due to a lack of resources.

       <b>EBADF</b>  The <u>fildes</u> argument is not a valid open file descriptor.

       <b>EINVAL</b> The value of <u>len</u> is zero.

       <b>EINVAL</b> The value of <u>flags</u> is invalid (neither MAP_PRIVATE nor MAP_SHARED is set).

       <b>EMFILE</b> The  number  of  mapped  regions  would exceed an implementation-defined limit (per process or per
              system).

       <b>ENODEV</b> The <u>fildes</u> argument refers to a file whose type is not supported by <u>mmap</u>().

       <b>ENOMEM</b> MAP_FIXED was specified, and the range [<u>addr</u>,<u>addr</u>+<u>len</u>) exceeds that allowed for the address  space
              of  a  process;  or,  if MAP_FIXED was not specified and there is insufficient room in the address
              space to effect the mapping.

       <b>ENOMEM</b> The mapping could not be locked in memory, if required by <u>mlockall</u>(),  because  it  would  require
              more space than the system is able to supply.

       <b>ENOMEM</b> Not  enough unallocated memory resources remain in the typed memory object designated by <u>fildes</u> to
              allocate <u>len</u> bytes.

       <b>ENOTSUP</b>
              MAP_FIXED or MAP_PRIVATE was specified in the <u>flags</u>  argument  and  the  implementation  does  not
              support this functionality.

                   The  implementation  does  not  support  the  combination  of  accesses requested in the <u>prot</u>
                   argument.

       <b>ENXIO</b>  Addresses in the range [<u>off</u>,<u>off</u>+<u>len</u>) are invalid for the object specified by <u>fildes</u>.

       <b>ENXIO</b>  MAP_FIXED was specified in <u>flags</u> and the combination of <u>addr</u>, <u>len</u>, and  <u>off</u>  is  invalid  for  the
              object specified by <u>fildes</u>.

       <b>ENXIO</b>  The  <u>fildes</u>  argument  refers  to  a  typed  memory object that is not accessible from the calling
              process.

       <b>EOVERFLOW</b>
              The file is a regular file and the value of <u>off</u> plus <u>len</u> exceeds the offset maximum established in
              the open file description associated with <u>fildes</u>.

       The <u>mmap</u>() function may fail if:

       <b>EINVAL</b> The <u>addr</u> argument (if MAP_FIXED was specified) or <u>off</u> is not  a  multiple  of  the  page  size  as
              returned by <u>sysconf</u>(), or is considered invalid by the implementation.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       Use of <u>mmap</u>() may reduce the amount of memory available to other memory allocation functions.

       Use  of  MAP_FIXED may result in unspecified behavior in further use of <u>malloc</u>() and <u>shmat</u>().  The use of
       MAP_FIXED is discouraged, as it may prevent an implementation from  making  the  most  effective  use  of
       resources.  Most  implementations require that <u>off</u> and <u>addr</u> are multiples of the page size as returned by
       <u>sysconf</u>().

       The application must ensure correct synchronization when using <u>mmap</u>() in conjunction with any other  file
       access method, such as <u>read</u>() and <u>write</u>(), standard input/output, and <u>shmat</u>().

       The   <u>mmap</u>()   function   allows  access  to  resources  via  address  space  manipulations,  instead  of
       <u>read</u>()/<u>write</u>().  Once a file is mapped, all a process has to do to access it  is  use  the  data  at  the
       address  to  which  the file was mapped. So, using pseudo-code to illustrate the way in which an existing
       program might be changed to use <u>mmap</u>(), the following:

           fildes = open(...)
           lseek(fildes, some_offset)
           read(fildes, buf, len)
           /* Use data in buf. */

       becomes:

           fildes = open(...)
           address = mmap(0, len, PROT_READ, MAP_PRIVATE, fildes, some_offset)
           /* Use data at address. */

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       After considering several other alternatives, it was decided to adopt the <u>mmap</u>() definition found in SVR4
       for mapping memory objects into process address spaces. The  SVR4  definition  is  minimal,  in  that  it
       describes  only  what has been built, and what appears to be necessary for a general and portable mapping
       facility.

       Note that while <u>mmap</u>() was first designed for mapping files, it is  actually  a  general-purpose  mapping
       facility.  It  can be used to map any appropriate object, such as memory, files, devices, and so on, into
       the address space of a process.

       When a mapping is established, it is possible that the implementation  may  need  to  map  more  than  is
       requested  into  the  address  space  of  the  process  because of hardware requirements. An application,
       however, cannot count on this behavior. Implementations that do not use a paged architecture  may  simply
       allocate  a  common  memory  region  and  return  the address of it; such implementations probably do not
       allocate any more than is necessary. References past the end of the requested area are unspecified.

       If an application requests a mapping that  overlaps  existing  mappings  in  the  process,  it  might  be
       desirable  that  an  implementation  detect  this  and  inform  the  application. However, if the program
       specifies a fixed address mapping (which requires some implementation knowledge to determine  a  suitable
       address,  if  the function is supported at all), then the program is presumed to be successfully managing
       its own address space and should  be  trusted  when  it  asks  to  map  over  existing  data  structures.
       Furthermore,  it  is  also  desirable to make as few system calls as possible, and it might be considered
       onerous to require an <u>munmap</u>() before an <u>mmap</u>() to the same address range. This  volume  of  POSIX.1‐2017
       specifies  that  the  new  mapping  replaces any existing mappings (implying an automatic <u>munmap</u>() on the
       address range), following existing practice in this regard.   The  standard  developers  also  considered
       whether  there  should  be  a  way  for  new mappings to overlay existing mappings, but found no existing
       practice for this.

       It is not expected that all hardware implementations are able to support all combinations of  permissions
       at  all  addresses.   Implementations  are  required  to  disallow write access to mappings without write
       permission and  to  disallow  access  to  mappings  without  any  access  permission.  Other  than  these
       restrictions,  implementations  may allow access types other than those requested by the application. For
       example, if the application requests only PROT_WRITE, the implementation may also allow  read  access.  A
       call  to  <u>mmap</u>()  fails  if  the  implementation  cannot support allowing all the access requested by the
       application. For example, some implementations cannot support a request for both write access and execute
       access simultaneously. All implementations must support  requests  for  no  access,  read  access,  write
       access,  and  both read and write access. Strictly conforming code must only rely on the required checks.
       These restrictions allow for portability across a wide range of hardware.

       The MAP_FIXED  address  treatment  is  likely  to  fail  for  non-page-aligned  values  and  for  certain
       architecture-dependent  address  ranges.  Conforming implementations cannot count on being able to choose
       address  values  for  MAP_FIXED  without  utilizing   non-portable,   implementation-defined   knowledge.
       Nonetheless,  MAP_FIXED is provided as a standard interface conforming to existing practice for utilizing
       such knowledge when it is available.

       Similarly, in order to allow implementations that do not support virtual addresses, support for  directly
       specifying  any mapping addresses via MAP_FIXED is not required and thus a conforming application may not
       count on it.

       The MAP_PRIVATE function can be implemented efficiently when memory  protection  hardware  is  available.
       When  such  hardware is not available, implementations can implement such ``mappings'' by simply making a
       real copy of the relevant data into process private memory, though this  tends  to  behave  similarly  to
       <u>read</u>().

       The  function  has  been  defined to allow for many different models of using shared memory. However, all
       uses are not equally portable across all machine architectures. In particular, the <u>mmap</u>() function allows
       the system as well as the application to specify the address at which to  map  a  specific  region  of  a
       memory  object. The most portable way to use the function is always to let the system choose the address,
       specifying NULL as the value for the argument <u>addr</u> and not to specify MAP_FIXED.

       If it is intended that a particular region of a memory object be mapped at the same address in a group of
       processes (on machines where this is even possible), then MAP_FIXED can be used to pass  in  the  desired
       mapping  address. The system can still be used to choose the desired address if the first such mapping is
       made without specifying MAP_FIXED, and then the resulting mapping address can  be  passed  to  subsequent
       processes  for  them  to  pass  in  via MAP_FIXED. The availability of a specific address range cannot be
       guaranteed, in general.

       The <u>mmap</u>() function can be used to map a region of memory that is larger than the  current  size  of  the
       object.  Memory access within the mapping but beyond the current end of the underlying objects may result
       in SIGBUS signals being sent to the process. The reason for this is that the size of the  object  can  be
       manipulated  by  other  processes  and  can  change  at  any  moment.  The implementation should tell the
       application that a memory reference is outside the object where this can be detected; otherwise,  written
       data may be lost and read data may not reflect actual data in the object.

       Note  that  references  beyond  the  end  of the object do not extend the object as the new end cannot be
       determined precisely by most virtual memory hardware. Instead, the size can be  directly  manipulated  by
       <u>ftruncate</u>().

       Process memory locking does apply to shared memory regions, and the MCL_FUTURE argument to <u>mlockall</u>() can
       be relied upon to cause new shared memory regions to be automatically locked.

       Existing implementations of <u>mmap</u>() return the value -1 when unsuccessful. Since the casting of this value
       to  type  <b>void</b>  <b>*</b> cannot be guaranteed by the ISO C standard to be distinct from a successful value, this
       volume of POSIX.1‐2017 defines the symbol MAP_FAILED, which a conforming implementation does  not  return
       as the result of a successful call.
