</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       FCGI::Engine::ProcManager::Constrained - FastCGI applications with memory and number of request limits.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       A constrained process manager that restarts child workers after a number of requests or if they use too
       much memory.

       Most of the memory usage code is stolen from Apache2::SizeLimit.

</pre><h4><b>ATTRIBUTES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>max_requests</b>
       The number of requests a child process can handle before being terminated.

       0 (the default) means let child processes do an infinite number of requests

   <b>sizecheck_num_requests</b>
       The number of requests between a check on the process size taking place.

       0 (the default) means never attempt to check the process size.

   <b>max_process_size</b>
       The maximum size of the process (both shared and unshared memory) in KB.

       0 (the default) means unlimited.

   <b>max_unshared_size</b>
       The maximum amount of memory in KB this process can have that isn't Copy-On-Write shared with other
       processes.

       0 (the default) means unlimited.

   <b>min_share_size</b>
       The minimum amount of memory in KB this process can have Copy-On-Write from it's parent process before it
       is terminate.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       I will fill this in more eventually, but for now if you really wanna know, read the source.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       All  complex  software  has bugs lurking in it, and this module is no exception. If you find a bug please
       either email me, or add the bug to cpan-RT.
