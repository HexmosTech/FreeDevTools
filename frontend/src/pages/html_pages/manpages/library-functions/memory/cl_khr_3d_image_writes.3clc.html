       cl_khr_3d_image_writes - Extension to enable writes to 3D image memory objects.

       #pragma OPENCL EXTENSION cl_khr_3d_image_writes : enable

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       OpenCL supports 2D image memory objects that can be read or written by kernels. Reads and writes to the
       same 2D image memory object are not supported in a kernel. OpenCL also supports reads to 3D image memory
       objects in kernels. Writes to a 3D image memory object are not supported unless the
       <b>cl_khr_3d_image_writes</b> extension is implemented. Reads and writes to the same 3D image memory object are
       not allowed in a kernel.

       An application that wants to use this extension to write to 3D image memory objects will need to include
       the #pragma OPENCL EXTENSION cl_khr_3d_image_writes : enable directive in the OpenCL program source.

       The <b><a href="../man3clc/write_image3d.3clc.html">write_image3d</a></b>(3clc) are implemented by the <b>cl_khr_3d_image_writes</b> extension.
