</pre><h4><b>Description</b></h4><pre>
       "APR::Pool" provides an access to APR pools, which are used for an easy memory management.

       Different pools have different life scopes and therefore one doesn't need to free allocated memory
       explicitly, but instead it's done when the pool's life is getting to an end. For example a request pool
       is created at the beginning of a request and destroyed at the end of it, and all the memory allocated
       during the request processing using the request pool is freed at once at the end of the request.

       Most of the time you will just pass various pool objects to the methods that require them. And you must
       understand the scoping of the pools, since if you pass a long lived server pool to a method that needs
       the memory only for a short scoped request, you are going to leak memory. A request pool should be used
       in such a case. And vice versa, if you need to allocate some memory for a scope longer than a single
       request, then a request pool is inappropriate, since when the request will be over, the memory will be
       freed and bad things may happen.

       If you need to create a new pool, you can always do that via the new() method.

</pre><h4><b>API</b></h4><pre>
       "APR::Pool" provides the following functions and/or methods:

   <b>"cleanup_register"</b>
       Register cleanup callback to run

         $pool-&gt;cleanup_register($callback);
         $pool-&gt;cleanup_register($callback, $arg);

       obj: $pool ( "APR::Pool object" )
           The pool object to register the cleanup callback for

       arg1: $callback ( CODE ref or sub name )
           a cleanup callback CODE reference or just a name of the subroutine (fully qualified unless defined in
           the current package).

       opt arg2: $arg ( SCALAR )
           If  this  optional  argument  is passed, the $callback function will receive it as the first and only
           argument when executed.

           To pass more than one argument, use an ARRAY or a HASH reference

       ret: no return value
       excpt:
           If a registered callback dies or throws an exception $@ is stringified and passed to warn(). Usually,
           this results in printing it to the <u>error_log</u>. However, a $SIG{__WARN__} handler can be used to  catch
           them.

             $pool-&gt;cleanup_register(sub {die "message1\n"});
             $pool-&gt;cleanup_register(sub {die "message2\n"});
             my @warnings;
             {
                 local $SIG{__WARN__}=sub {push @warnings, @_};
                 $pool-&gt;destroy;       # or simply undef $pool
             }

           Both  of  the  cleanups above are executed at the time "$pool-&gt;destroy" is called. @warnings contains
           "message2\n" and "message1\n" afterwards.  "$pool-&gt;destroy" itself does not throw an  exception.  Any
           value of $@ is preserved.

       since: 2.0.00

       If  there  is  more than one callback registered (when "cleanup_register" is called more than once on the
       same pool object), the last registered callback will be executed first (LIFO).

       Examples:

       No arguments, using anon sub as a cleanup callback:

         $r-&gt;pool-&gt;cleanup_register(sub { warn "running cleanup" });

       One or more arguments using a cleanup code reference:

         $r-&gt;pool-&gt;cleanup_register(\&amp;cleanup, $r);
         $r-&gt;pool-&gt;cleanup_register(\&amp;cleanup, [$r, $foo]);
         sub cleanup {
             my @args = (@_ &amp;&amp; ref $_[0] eq ARRAY) ? @{ +shift } : shift;
             my $r = shift @args;
             warn "cleaning up";
         }

       No arguments, using a function name as a cleanup callback:

         $r-&gt;pool-&gt;cleanup_register('foo');

   <b>"clear"</b>
       Clear all memory in the pool and run all the registered cleanups. This also destroys all sub-pools.

         $pool-&gt;clear();

       obj: $pool ( "APR::Pool object" )
           The pool to clear

       ret: no return value
       since: 2.0.00

       This method differs from destroy() in that it is not freeing the previously  allocated,  but  allows  the
       pool to re-use it for the future memory allocations.

   <b>"DESTROY"</b>
       "DESTROY"  is  an  alias  to  "destroy".  It's there so that custom "APR::Pool" objects will get properly
       cleaned up, when the pool object goes out of scope. If you ever want to  destroy  an  "APR::Pool"  object
       before it goes out of scope, use "destroy".

       since: 2.0.00

   <b>"destroy"</b>
       Destroy the pool.

         $pool-&gt;destroy();

       obj: $pool ( "APR::Pool object" )
           The pool to destroy

       ret: no return value
       since: 2.0.00

       This method takes a similar action to clear() and then frees all the memory.

   <b>"is_ancestor"</b>
       Determine if pool a is an ancestor of pool b

         $ret = $pool_a-&gt;is_ancestor($pool_b);

       obj: $pool_a ( "APR::Pool object" )
           The pool to search

       arg1: $pool_b ( "APR::Pool object" )
           The pool to search for

       ret: $ret ( integer )
           True if $pool_a is an ancestor of $pool_b.

       since: 2.0.00

       For example create a sub-pool of a given pool and check that the pool is an ancestor of that sub-pool:

         use APR::Pool ();
         my $pp = $r-&gt;pool;
         my $sp = $pp-&gt;new();
         $pp-&gt;is_ancestor($sp) or die "Don't mess with genes!";

   <b>"new"</b>
       Create a new sub-pool

         my $pool_child = $pool_parent-&gt;new;
         my $pool_child = APR::Pool-&gt;new;

       obj: $pool_parent ( "APR::Pool object" )
           The parent pool.

           If  you  don't  have  a  parent pool to create the sub-pool from, you can use this object method as a
           class method, in which case the sub-pool will be created from the global pool:

             my $pool_child = APR::Pool-&gt;new;

       ret: $pool_child ( "APR::Pool object" )
           The child sub-pool

       since: 2.0.00

   <b>"parent_get"</b>
       Get the parent pool

         $parent_pool = $child_pool-&gt;parent_get();

       obj: $child_pool ( "APR::Pool object" )
           the child pool

       ret: $parent_pool ( "APR::Pool object" )
           the parent pool. "undef" if there is no parent pool (which is the case for the top-most global pool).

       since: 2.0.00

       Example: Calculate how big is the pool's ancestry:

         use APR::Pool ();
         sub ancestry_count {
             my $child = shift;
             my $gen = 0;
             while (my $parent = $child-&gt;parent_get) {
                 $gen++;
                 $child = $parent;
             }
             return $gen;
         }

   <b>"tag"</b>
       Tag a pool (give it a name)

         $pool-&gt;tag($tag);

       obj: $pool ( "APR::Pool object" )
           The pool to tag

       arg1: $tag ( string )
           The tag (some unique string)

       ret: no return value
       since: 2.0.00

       Each pool can be tagged with a unique label. This can prove  useful  when  doing  low  level  apr_pool  C
       tracing  (when  apr  is  compiled with "-DAPR_POOL_DEBUG"). It allows you to <b><a href="../man1/grep.1.html">grep</a></b>(1) for the tag you have
       set, to single out the traces relevant to you.

       Though there is no way to get read the tag value, since APR doesn't provide such an accessor method.

</pre><h4><b>Unsupported</b> <b>API</b></h4><pre>
       "APR::Pool" also provides auto-generated Perl interface for a few other methods which  aren't  tested  at
       the  moment  and  therefore  their API is a subject to change. These methods will be finalized later as a
       need arises. If you want to rely on any  of  the  following  methods  please  contact  the  the  mod_perl
       development  mailing  list  so  we can help each other take the steps necessary to shift the method to an
       officially supported API.

   <b>"cleanup_for_exec"</b>
       META: Autogenerated - needs to be reviewed/completed

       Preparing for <b>exec()</b> --- close files, etc., but *don't* flush I/O buffers, *don't* wait for subprocesses,
       and *don't* free any memory.  Run all of the child_cleanups, so that any  unnecessary  files  are  closed
       because we are about to exec a new program

       ret: no return value
       since: subject to change
