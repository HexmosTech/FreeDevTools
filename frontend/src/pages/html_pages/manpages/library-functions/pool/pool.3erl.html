</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       pool - Load distribution facility.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  module  can  be  used  to  run  a  set of Erlang nodes as a pool of computational processors. It is
       organized as a master and a set of slave nodes and includes the following features:

         * The slave nodes send regular reports to the master about their current load.

         * Queries can be sent to the master to determine which node will have the least load.

       The BIF <u>statistics(run_queue)</u> is used for estimating future loads. It returns the length of the queue  of
       ready to run processes in the Erlang runtime system.

       The  slave  nodes  are started with the <u><a href="../man3erl/slave.3erl.html">slave</a>(3erl)</u> module. This effects terminal I/O, file I/O, and code
       loading.

       If the master node fails, the entire pool exits.

</pre><h4><b>EXPORTS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>attach(Node)</b> <b>-&gt;</b> <b>already_attached</b> <b>|</b> <b>attached</b>

              Types:

                 Node = node()

              Ensures that a pool master is running and includes <u>Node</u> in the pool master's pool of nodes.

       <b>get_node()</b> <b>-&gt;</b> <b>node()</b>

              Returns the node with the expected lowest future load.

       <b>get_nodes()</b> <b>-&gt;</b> <b>[node()]</b>

              Returns a list of the current member nodes of the pool.

       <b>pspawn(Mod,</b> <b>Fun,</b> <b>Args)</b> <b>-&gt;</b> <b>pid()</b>

              Types:

                 Mod = module()
                 Fun = atom()
                 Args = [term()]

              Spawns a process on the pool node that is expected to have the lowest future load.

       <b>pspawn_link(Mod,</b> <b>Fun,</b> <b>Args)</b> <b>-&gt;</b> <b>pid()</b>

              Types:

                 Mod = module()
                 Fun = atom()
                 Args = [term()]

              Spawns and links to a process on the pool node that is expected to have the lowest future load.

       <b>start(Name)</b> <b>-&gt;</b> <b>Nodes</b>

       <b>start(Name,</b> <b>Args)</b> <b>-&gt;</b> <b>Nodes</b>

              Types:

                 Name = atom()
                 Args = string()
                 Nodes = [node()]

              Starts a new pool. The file <u>.hosts.erlang</u> is read to find host names where the pool nodes  can  be
              started; see section Files. The startup procedure fails if the file is not found.

              The  slave nodes are started with <u>slave:start/2,3</u>, passing along <u>Name</u> and, if provided, <u>Args</u>. <u>Name</u>
              is used as the first part of the node names, <u>Args</u> is used to specify command-line arguments.

              Access rights must be set so that all nodes in the pool have the authority to access each other.

              The function is synchronous and all the nodes, and all the system servers,  are  running  when  it
              returns a value.

       <b>stop()</b> <b>-&gt;</b> <b>stopped</b>

              Stops the pool and kills all the slave nodes.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>.hosts.erlang</u> is used to pick hosts where nodes can be started. For information about format and location
       of this file, see <u>net_adm:host_file/0</u>.

       <u>$HOME/.erlang.slave.out.HOST</u>  is  used  for  all extra I/O that can come from the slave nodes on standard
       I/O. If the startup procedure does not work, this file can indicate the reason.
