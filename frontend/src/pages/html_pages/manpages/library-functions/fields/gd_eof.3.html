       gd_eof — find the end of a Dirfile field

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;getdata.h&gt;</b>

       <b>off_t</b> <b>gd_eof(DIRFILE</b> <b>*</b><u>dirfile</u><b>,</b> <b>const</b> <b>char</b> <b>*</b><u>field_code</u><b>);</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>gd_eof</b>() function queries a <a href="../man5/dirfile.5.html">dirfile</a>(5) database specified by <u>dirfile</u> and determines the sample number
       of  the end-of-field marker for the vector field given by <u>field_code</u>.  This is effectively the total num‐
       ber of samples available for the field, including any frame offset.

       The caller should not assume that this is equivalent (when accounting for the  samples-per-frame  of  the
       indicated  field)  to  the  number of frames in the database returned by <b><a href="../man3/gd_nframes.3.html">gd_nframes</a></b>(3), nor even that the
       end-of-field marker falls on a frame boundary.

       For a <b>RAW</b> field, the end-of-field marker occurs immediately after the last datum in the data file associ‐
       ated with the field.  The special field <u>INDEX</u> has no end-of-field marker.

       The end-of-field of a <b>PHASE</b> field is the end-of-field of its input adjusted by the <b>PHASE</b>  field's  shift.
       For  other  vector field types, the end-of-field marker is the smallest end-of-field marker of any of its
       inputs.

       If the end-of-field marker for a field is less than  or  equal  to  its  beginning-of-field  marker  (see
       <b><a href="../man3/gd_bof.3.html">gd_bof</a></b>(3)), then that field has no data.  For a <b>RAW</b> field, the difference between the beginning- and end-
       of-field markers indicates the number of samples of data actually stored on disk.

       The <u>dirfile</u> argument must point to a valid DIRFILE object previously created by a call to <b><a href="../man3/gd_open.3.html">gd_open</a></b>(3).

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       Upon  successful  completion, <b>gd_eof</b>() returns the sample number of the end-of-field marker for the indi‐
       cated field, which is never negative.  On error, it returns a negative-valued error code.  Possible error
       codes are:

       <b>GD_E_ALLOC</b>
               The library was unable to allocate memory.

       <b>GD_E_BAD_CODE</b>
               The field specified by <u>field_code</u> or one of the fields it uses as input  was  not  found  in  the
               database.

       <b>GD_E_BAD_DIRFILE</b>
               The supplied dirfile was invalid.

       <b>GD_E_BAD_FIELD_TYPE</b>
               The  location  of the non-existent end-of-field marker for the special field <u>INDEX</u> was requested,
               possibly as a result of the field specified by <u>field_code</u> using <u>INDEX</u> as one of its inputs.

       <b>GD_E_DIMENSION</b>
               A scalar field was found where a vector field was expected in the definition of <u>field_code</u> or one
               of its inputs, or else <u>field_code</u> itself specified a scalar field.

       <b>GD_E_INTERNAL_ERROR</b>
               An internal error occurred in the library while trying to perform the task.  This indicates a bug
               in the library.  Please report the incident to the GetData developers.

       <b>GD_E_IO</b> An I/O error occurred while deterimining the size of the raw data file associated with the field,
               or one of its input fields.

       <b>GD_E_RECURSE_LEVEL</b>
               Too many levels of recursion were encountered while trying to resolve <u>field_code</u>.   This  usually
               indicates a circular dependency in field specification in the dirfile.

       <b>GD_E_UNKNOWN_ENCODING</b>
               The  size of the decoded data file associated with the specified field or one of its inputs could
               not be determined, because its encoding scheme was not understood.

       <b>GD_E_UNSUPPORTED</b>
               The size of the decoded data file associated with the specified field or one of its inputs  could
               not be determined, because its encoding scheme was not supported.

       The  error  code is also stored in the <b>DIRFILE</b> object and may be retrieved after this function returns by
       calling  <b><a href="../man3/gd_error.3.html">gd_error</a></b>(3).   A  descriptive  error  string  for  the  error  may  be   obtained   by   calling
       <b><a href="../man3/gd_error_string.3.html">gd_error_string</a></b>(3).

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>gd_eof</b>() function appeared in GetData-0.7.0.

       In GetData-0.10.0, the error return from this function changed from -1 to a negative-valued error code.
