</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Streamlines - Utility for plotting a streamline representation of field flow data given two arrays
       containing the vector field components on a uniform grid.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       The following two calls are the minimum required to create a streamline field flow plot using the current
       interface:

       •      STINIT - Performs initialization tasks required before STREAM may be called to create a streamline
              field  flow  plot.  Information  about  the input data arrays is copied into internal common block
              variables and the coordinate system mappings and boundaries are established.

       •      STREAM - Plots a streamline representation of field flow data, based on conditions established  by
              STINIT  and the current values of a set of user-modifiable internal parameters associated with the
              Streamlines utility.

       All user-modifiable internal parameters have  default  values;  only  those  which  are  to  have  values
       different  from  the  default  need  to  be  set.  The routines used to set Streamlines parameters are as
       follows:

       •      STRSET - Resets all parameters to their initial default values.

       •      STSETI - Sets the value of an internal parameter of type INTEGER.

       •      STSETR - Sets the value of an internal parameter of type REAL.

       In general, once a parameter is given a value by a call to one of these routines, it retains  that  value
       until  a  similar  call  resets  it.   Retrieve  the value of an internal parameter by calling one of the
       following routines:

       •      STGETI - Gets the current value of an internal parameter of type INTEGER.

       •      STGETR - Gets the current value of an internal parameter of type REAL.

       Streamlines supports  two  obsolete  routines  for  compatibility  with  old  NCAR  Graphics  codes.  The
       compatibility  mode  parameter,  CPM,  offers  a number of options that allow considerable flexibility in
       making the transition to the new version of the utility. When writing new code you are encouraged not  to
       use  these  entry points, since they provide less capability than the standard Streamlines interface, and
       may eventually be phased out.

       •      STRMLN - The principal entry point prior to Version 3.2, now a  front  end  to  the  STINIT/STREAM
              interface.

       •      EZSTRM  -  Front end to STRMLN: a simpler interface for standard situations, when detailed control
              of the plot is not required.

</pre><h4><b>USER-MODIFIABLE</b> <b>INTERNAL</b> <b>ROUTINES</b></h4><pre>
       The following routines are not to be called directly. However, you may modify them in order to  customize
       the  behavior  of  Streamlines. Three routines (STUMXY, STUIXY, and STUMTA) are provided to support user-
       defined mapping transformations. The fourth (STUMSL) allows you to  tailor  streamline  masking  to  your
       requirements.

       •      STUIXY - User modifiable routine that inversely maps a single point on the streamline from user to
              data coordinate space.

       •      STUMSL  -  Default  name for a user-definable external subroutine used to draw masked streamlines.
              The default version of the routine draws any polyline all of whose area  identifiers  are  greater
              than or equal to zero.

       •      STUMTA  - Given the coordinates of a point on the streamline in data, user, and NDC space, and the
              interpolated, normalized components of the vector at the point relative to data coordinate  space,
              the  user-modifiable  routine STUMTA finds the directional angle of the streamline relative to NDC
              space at the point.

       •      STUMXY - User modifiable routine that maps a single point on the  streamline  from  data  to  user
              coordinate space.

</pre><h4><b>ACCESS</b></h4><pre>
       To  use  Streamlines,  load the NCAR Graphics libraries ncarg, ncarg_gks, and ncarg_c, preferably in that
       order.

</pre><h4><b>MESSAGES</b></h4><pre>
       In this section are listed, in alphabetical order,  all  the  error  messages  that  may  be  written  by
       Streamlines.  Each  error  message  begins with the name of the Streamlines routine in which an error has
       been detected, followed by a dash, followed by the error message itself. These error messages are written
       by a call to the error-handling support routine SETER, with a final argument indicating that the error is
       fatal and that execution should be terminated.

       STGETI OR STGETR - PARAMETER NAME NOT KNOWN - x
              The given parameter name (´x´) is not a legal parameter name known to Streamlines.

       STGETI OR STGETR - PARAMETER NAME TOO SHORT - x
              The parameter name ("x") is less than three characters long.

       STINIT - U AND/OR V ARRAY DIMENSIONS EXCEEDED
              The STINIT input argument, M, specifying the number of array  elements  to  use  along  the  first
              dimension of the U and V arrays, exceeds the actual first dimension of U and/or V, as specified by
              the input arguments LU and LV.

       STREAM - TOO MANY AREA GROUPS
              The  area map passed as the argument, IAM, to STREAM contains more area groups than allowed by the
              Streamlines utility, currently 64. This error can occur only if the mask to  area  map  parameter,
              MSK,  has  a  value  greater than 0, specifying that streamlines are to be drawn masked to an area
              map.

       STREAM - INVALID AREA MAP
              The area map passed as the argument, IAM, to STREAM is judged to be invalid because it contains  a
              negative  value  for  the number of area groups. This error can occur only if the mask to area map
              parameter, MSK, has a value greater than 0, specifying that streamlines are to be drawn masked  to
              an area map.

       STSETI OR STSETR - PARAMETER NAME NOT KNOWN - x
              The given parameter name (´x´) is not a legal parameter name known to Streamlines.

       STSETI OR STSETR - PARAMETER NAME TOO SHORT - x
              The parameter name ("x") is less than three characters long.

       STSETI OR STSETR - PARAMETER VALUE OUT OF RANGE - x
              An  attempt  has  been made to set the parameter named ´x´ to a value outside the range allowed by
              the Streamlines utility.
