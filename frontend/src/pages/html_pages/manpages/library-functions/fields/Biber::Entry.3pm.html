       Biber::Entry - Biber::Entry objects

   <b>new</b>
           Initialize a Biber::Entry object

           There are three types of field possible in an entry:

           * data    - These are fields which derive directly from or are themselves fields in the
                       data source. Things like YEAR, MONTH, DAY etc. are such fields which are
                       derived from, for example, the DATE field. They are part of the original
                       data implicitly, derived from a field.
           * derived - These are fields, often meta-information like labelname, labelalpha etc.
                       which are more removed from the data fields.

           The reason for this division is largely the entry cloning required for the related entry and
           inheritance features. When we clone an entry or copy some fields from one entry to another
           we generally don't want the "derived" category as such derived meta-fields will often need
           to be re-created or ignored so we need to know which are the actual "data" fields to
           copy/clone.

   <b>relclone</b>
           Recursively create related entry clones starting with an entry

   <b>clone</b>
           Clone a Biber::Entry object and return a copy
           Accepts optionally a key for the copy

   <b>notnull</b>
           Test for an empty object

   <b>add_xdata_ref</b>
         Add an XDATA reference to the entry
         Reference can be simply to an entire XDATA entry or a particular field+position in field
         Record reference and target positions so that the XDATA marker can be removed as otherwise
         it would break further parsing

   <b>get_xdata_refs</b>
         Get the XDATA references

   <b>get_xdata_ref</b>
         Get a specific XDATA reference

   <b>is_xdata_resolved</b>
         Checks if an XDATA reference was resolved. Returns false also for
         "no such reference".

   <b>set_labelname_info</b>
         Record the labelname information. This is special
         meta-information so we have a separate method for this
         Takes a hash ref with the information.

   <b>get_labelname_info</b>
         Retrieve the labelname information. This is special
         meta-information so we have a separate method for this
         Returns a hash ref with the information.

   <b>set_labelnamefh_info</b>
         Record the fullhash labelname information. This is special
         meta-information so we have a separate method for this
         Takes a hash ref with the information.

   <b>get_labelnamefh_info</b>
         Retrieve the fullhash labelname information. This is special
         meta-information so we have a separate method for this
         Returns a hash ref with the information.

   <b>set_labeltitle_info</b>
         Record the labeltitle information. This is special
         meta-information so we have a separate method for this
         Takes a hash ref with the information.

   <b>get_labeltitle_info</b>
         Retrieve the labeltitle information. This is special
         meta-information so we have a separate method for this
         Returns a hash ref with the information.

   <b>set_labeldate_info</b>
         Record the labeldate information. This is special
         meta-information so we have a separate method for this
         Takes a hash ref with the information.

   <b>get_labeldate_info</b>
         Retrieve the labeldate information. This is special
         meta-information so we have a separate method for this
         Returns a hash ref with the information.

   <b>set_field</b>
         Set a derived field for a Biber::Entry object, that is, a field
         which was not an actual bibliography field

   <b>get_field</b>
           Get a field for a Biber::Entry object
           Uses // as fields can be null (end dates etc).

   <b>set_datafield</b>
           Set a field which is in the .bib data file

   <b>get_datafield</b>
           Get a field that was in the original data file

   <b>del_field</b>
           Delete a field in a Biber::Entry object

   <b>del_datafield</b>
           Delete an original data source data field in a Biber::Entry object

   <b>field_exists</b>
           Check whether a field exists (even if null)

   <b>date_fields_exist</b>
           Check whether any parts of a date field exist when passed a datepart field name

   <b>delete_date_fields</b>
           Delete all parts of a date field when passed any datepart field name

   <b>datafields</b>
           Returns a sorted array of the fields which came from the data source

   <b>count_datafields</b>
           Returns the number of datafields

   <b>derivedfields</b>
           Returns a sorted array of the fields which were added during processing

   <b>fields</b>
           Returns a sorted array of all field names, including ones
           added during processing which are not necessarily fields
           which came from the data file

   <b>count_fields</b>
           Returns the number of fields

   <b>has_keyword</b>
           Check if a Biber::Entry object has a particular keyword in
           in the KEYWORDS field.

   <b>add_warning</b>
           Append a warning to a Biber::Entry object

   <b>set_inherit_from</b>
           Inherit fields from first child entry

           $entry-&gt;set_inherit_from($firstchild);

           Takes a second Biber::Entry object as argument

           The purpose here is to inherit fields so that sorting/labelling defaults
           can be generated for set parents from the first child set member data, unless
           the set parent itself already has some fields set that will do this. Set
           parents only have certain fields output in the .bbl and those that output but
           are not used in sorting/labelling data generation should not be inherited.

   <b>resolve_xdata</b>
           Recursively resolve XDATA in an entry. Sets a flag in the XDATA metadata to
           say if the reference was successfully resolved.

           $entry-&gt;resolve_xdata($xdata);

   <b>inherit_from</b>
           Inherit fields from parent entry (as indicated by the crossref field)

           $entry-&gt;inherit_from($parententry);

           Takes a second Biber::Entry object as argument
           Uses the crossref inheritance specifications from the .bcf

   <b>dump</b>
           Dump Biber::Entry object
