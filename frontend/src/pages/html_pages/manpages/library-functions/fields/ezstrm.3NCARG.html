</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       EZSTRM - A front-end to STRMLN with a simpler interface.  Like STRMLN, it plots a streamline
       representation of field flow data in a single call.

</pre><h4><b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       EZSTRM is obsolete, and is supported only to provide compatibility with old NCAR Graphics codes. However,
       the compatibility mode parameter, CPM, offers a number of options to help ease the the transition to the
       new version of the utility. When writing new code you are encouraged not to use this entry point, since
       it provides less capability than the standard Streamlines interface, and may eventually be phased out.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       CALL EZSTRM (U,V,WORK,IMAX,JMAX)

</pre><h4><b>C-BINDING</b> <b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;ncarg/ncargC.h&gt;

       void c_ezstrm (float *u, float *v, float *work,
                      int imax, int jmax)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       U           (REAL  2-dimensional  array,  dimensioned  IMAX x n: n &gt;= JMAX, input) By default, assumed to
                   contain the first dimensional Cartesian components of the vector field.  However, if  PLR  is
                   non-zero, it is treated as containing the vector magnitudes.

       V           (REAL  2-dimensional  array,  dimensioned  IMAX x n: n &gt;= JMAX, input) By default, assumed to
                   contain the second dimensional Cartesian components of the vector field.  However, if PLR  is
                   non-zero, it is treated as containing the vector angles.

       WORK        (REAL  array, dimensioned n: n&gt;= 2*IMAX*JMAX working space): User provided work array used to
                   store the normalized vector component values, and also  to  keep  track  of  the  grid  boxes
                   eligible for starting a streamline or placement of a directional arrow.

       IMAX        (INTEGER, input) Actual size of the first dimension of arrays U and V

       JMAX        (INTEGER, input) Assumed size of the second dimension of arrays U and V.

</pre><h4><b>C-BINDING</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  C-binding argument descriptions are the same as the FORTRAN argument descriptions with the following
       exceptions:

       imax        The actual size of the second dimension of arrays u and v.

       jmax        The assumed size of first dimension of arrays u and v.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       U and V are 2-dimensional vector component arrays, whose actual first dimensions must  be  equal  to  the
       value  of  IMAX, and whose second dimensions must equal or exceed the value of JMAX. The WORK array must,
       at minimum, be of length 2*IMAX*JMAX.

       Assuming the default value of the compatibility mode parameter, CPM, Streamlines always  performs  a  SET
       call  and draws a perimeter around the plot when accessed through the EZSTRM interface. Before the return
       from EZSTRM, another call to SET restores the previous coordinate system mapping.

       By modifying the value of CPM, you may take more control over the utility than originally possible  using
       this  entry  point.  For  instance,  you  can override the default value of the SET parameter, or use the
       Version 3.2 coordinate system mapping routines instead of the old FX and FY functions. Nevertheless, when
       creating new code, use the STINIT/STREAM interface, since its capabilities are greater and more likely to
       improve with time.

</pre><h4><b>ACCESS</b></h4><pre>
       To use EZSTRM, load the NCAR Graphics libraries ncarg, ncarg_gks, and ncarg_c, preferably in that order.
