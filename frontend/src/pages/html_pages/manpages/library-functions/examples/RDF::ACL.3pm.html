</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Note that this module provides access control and does not perform authentication!

   <b>Constructors</b>
       "$acl-&gt;new($input, %args)"
           Creates  a  new  access  control list based on RDF data defined in $input. $input can be a serialised
           string of RDF, a file  name,  a  URI  or  any  other  input  accepted  by  the  "parse"  function  of
           RDF::TrineX::Functions.

           new() can be called with no arguments to create a fresh, clean ACL containing no authorisations.

       "$acl-&gt;new_remote($endpoint)"
           Creates  a  new  access  control  list  based  on  RDF data accessed via a remote SPARQL Protocol 1.0
           endpoint.

   <b>Public</b> <b>Methods</b>
       "$acl-&gt;check($webid, $item, $level, @data)"
           Checks an agent's authorisation to access an item.

           $webid is the WebID (URI) of the agent requesting access to the item.

           $item is the URL (URI) of the item being accessed.

           $level is a URI identifying the type of access  required.  As  special  cases,  the  case-insensitive
           string   'read'   is   expanded   to   the   URI   &lt;<a href="http://www.w3.org/ns/auth/acl">http://www.w3.org/ns/auth/acl</a>#Read&gt;,  'write'  to
           &lt;<a href="http://www.w3.org/ns/auth/acl">http://www.w3.org/ns/auth/acl</a>#Write&gt;,   'append'   to   &lt;<a href="http://www.w3.org/ns/auth/acl">http://www.w3.org/ns/auth/acl</a>#Append&gt;   and
           'control' to &lt;<a href="http://www.w3.org/ns/auth/acl">http://www.w3.org/ns/auth/acl</a>#Control&gt;.

           If  the  access  control list is local (not remote), zero or more additional RDF graphs can be passed
           (i.e. @data) containing data to take into consideration  when  checking  the  agent's  authorisation.
           This  data  is  trusted blindly, so should not include data that the user has themselves supplied. If
           the access control list is remote, then this method  throws  an  error  if  any  additional  data  is
           provided.  (A remote ACL cannot take into account local data.)

           If $level is provided, this method returns a boolean.

           If  $level is undefined or omitted, this method returns a list of URIs which each represent a type of
           access that the user is authorised.

       "$acl-&gt;why($webid, $item, $level, @data)"
           Investigates an agent's authorisation to access an item.

           Arguments as per "check", however $level is required.

           Returns a list of authorisations that justify a user's access to  the  item  with  the  given  access
           level. These authorisations are equivalent to $authid values provided by allow().

           In  some  cases  (especially  if  the  authorisation  was  created  by  hand, and not via allow()) an
           authorisation may not have an identifier. In these cases, the list will contain undef.

       "$acl-&gt;allow(%args)"
           Adds an authorisation to the ACL. The ACL must be mutable.

           The method takes a hash of named arguments:

             my $authid = $acl-&gt;allow(
               webid =&gt; '<a href="http://example.com/joe">http://example.com/joe</a>#me',
               item  =&gt; '<a href="http://example.com/private/document">http://example.com/private/document</a>',
               level =&gt; ['Read', 'Write'],
               );

           'item' is the URI of the item to authorise access to. As an alternative, 'item_class' may be used  to
           authorise  access  to  an entire class of items (using classes in the RDFS/OWL sense of the word). If
           neither of these arguments is provided, then the method will throw an error. Both  may  be  provided.
           Either  or  both  may  be an arrayref, because an authorisation may authorise access to more than one
           thing.

           'container' is an alternative to using 'item' or 'item_class'. It specifies the URI  for  a  resource
           which  in  some way is a container for other resources. Setting authorisations for a container allows
           you to set a default authorisation for new items created within that container.  (You  must  use  the
           created() method to notify the ACL about newly created items.)

           'webid'  is  the  WebID  (URI)  of  the  person  or  agent  being granted access.  As an alternative,
           'agent_class' may be used to authorise access to an entire class of agents. If neither  is  provided,
           an  agent_class of &lt;<a href="http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Agent">http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Agent</a>&gt; is assumed. Both may be provided. Either or both
           may be an arrayref, because an authorisation may authorise  access  by  more  than  one  agent.  (For
           consistency with 'item', 'agent' is supported as a synonym for 'webid'.)

           'level' is the access level being granted. As with the "check" method, the shortcuts 'read', 'write',
           'append'  and  'control'  may  be used.  An arrayref may be used. If no level is specified, 'read' is
           assumed.

           This authorisation is not automatically saved, so it is probably useful to call save()  after  adding
           authorisations.

           The  method  returns  an identifier for the authorisation. This identifier may be needed again if you
           ever need to deny() the authorisation.

           This method is aware of i_am()/who_am_i().

       "$acl-&gt;deny($authid)"
           Completely removes all traces of an authorisation from the ACL.

           The authorisation identifier can be found using why() or you may have remembered it  when  you  first
           allowed  the access.  In some cases (especially if the authorisation was created by hand, and not via
           allow()) an authorisation may not have an identifier. In these cases, you will have to be creative in
           figuring out how to deny access.

           Returns the number of statements removed from the ACL's internal model as a result  of  the  removal.
           (This will normally be at least 3.)

           This authorisation is not automatically saved, so it is probably useful to call save() after removing
           authorisations.

           This method is aware of i_am()/who_am_i().

       "$acl-&gt;created($item, $container)"
           Finds  all  authorisations  which  are the default for new items within $container and clones each of
           them for newly created $item.

           Returns a list of authorisation identifiers.

       "$acl-&gt;i_am($webid)"
           Tells the ACL object to "act like" the agent with the given WebID.

           If the ACL object is acting like you, then methods that make changes to the  ACL  (e.g.  allow()  and
           deny()) will only work if you have 'Control' permission over the resources specified.

           $webid can be null to restore the usual behaviour.

           Returns the previous WebID the ACL was acting like as a URI object.

       "$acl-&gt;who_am_i"
           Returns the WebID of the agent that ACL is acting like (if any).

       "$acl-&gt;save($format, $filename)"
           Serialises a local (not remote) ACL.

           $format can be any format supported by the "serialize" function from RDF::TrineX::Functions.

           If $filename is provided, this method writes to the file and returns the new file size in bytes.

           If  $filename  is  omitted,  this  method does not attempt to write to a file, and simply returns the
           string it would have written.

       "$acl-&gt;is_remote"
           Returns true if the ACL is remote; false if local.

       "$acl-&gt;is_mutable"
           Can this ACL be modified?

       "$acl-&gt;model"
           The graph model against which authorisation checks are made.

           Returned as an RDF::Trine::Model object.

       "$acl-&gt;endpoint"
           The endpoint URI for remote (non-local) ACL queries.

           Returned as a URI object.
