       Pod::Tests - (DEPRECATED) Extracts embedded tests and code examples from POD

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Pod::Tests;
         $p = Pod::Tests-&gt;new;

         $p-&gt;parse_file($file);
         $p-&gt;parse_fh($fh);
         $p-&gt;parse(@code);

         my @examples = $p-&gt;examples;
         my @tests    = $p-&gt;tests;

         foreach my $example (@examples) {
             print "The example:  '$example-&gt;{code}' was on line ".
                   "$example-&gt;{line}\n";
         }

         my @test_code         = $p-&gt;build_tests(@tests);
         my @example_test_code = $p-&gt;build_examples(@examples);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This is a specialized POD viewer to extract embedded tests and code examples from POD.  It doesn't do
       much more than that.  pod2test does the useful work.

   <b>Parsing</b>
       After creating a Pod::Tests object, you parse the POD by calling one of the available parsing methods
       documented below.  You can call parse as many times as you'd like, all examples and tests found will
       stack up inside the object.

   <b>Testing</b>
       Once extracted, the tests can be built into stand-alone testing code using the <b>build_tests()</b> and
       <b>build_examples()</b> methods.  However, it is recommended that you first look at the pod2test program before
       embarking on this.

   <b>Methods</b>
   <b>new</b>
         $parser = Pod::Tests-&gt;new;

       Returns a new Pod::Tests object which lets you read tests and examples out of a POD document.

   <b>parse</b>
         $parser-&gt;parse(@code);

       Finds the examples and tests in a bunch of lines of Perl @code.  Once run they're available via
       <b>examples()</b> and <b>testing()</b>.

   <b>parse_file</b> <b>$file</b>
         $parser-&gt;parse_file($filename);

       Just like <b>parse()</b> except it works on a file.

   <b>parse_fh</b> <b>$fh</b>
         $parser-&gt;parse_fh($fh);

       Just like <b>parse()</b> except it works on a filehandle.

   <b>tests</b>
         @testing  = $parser-&gt;tests;

       Returns the tests found in the parsed POD documents.  Each element of @testing is a hash representing an
       individual testing block and contains information about that block.

         $test-&gt;{code}         actual testing code
         $test-&gt;{line}         line from where the test was taken

   <b>examples</b>
         @examples = $parser-&gt;examples;

       Returns the examples found in the parsed POD documents.  Each element of @examples is a hash representing
       an individual testing block and contains information about that block.

         $test-&gt;{code}         actual testing code
         $test-&gt;{line}         line from where the test was taken

   <b>build_tests</b>
         my @code = $p-&gt;build_tests(@tests);

       Returns a code fragment based on the given embedded @tests.  This fragment is expected to print the usual
       "ok/not ok" (or something Test::Harness can read) or nothing at all.

       Typical usage might be:

           my @code = $p-&gt;build_tests($p-&gt;tests);

       This fragment is suitable for placing into a larger test script.

       <b>NOTE</b> Look at pod2test before embarking on your own test building.

   <b>build_examples</b>
         my @code = $p-&gt;build_examples(@examples);

       Similar to <b>build_tests()</b>, it creates a code fragment which tests the basic validity of your example code.
       Essentially, it just makes sure it compiles.

       If your example has an "example testing" block associated with it it will run the the example code and
       the example testing block.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Here's the simplest example, just finding the tests and examples in a single module.

         my $p = Pod::Tests-&gt;new;
         $p-&gt;parse_file("path/to/Some.pm");

       And one to find all the tests and examples in a directory of files.  This illustrates building a set of
       examples and tests through multiple calls to <b>parse_file()</b>.

         my $p = Pod::Tests-&gt;new;
         opendir(PODS, "path/to/some/lib/") || die $!;
         while( my $file = readdir PODS ) {
             $p-&gt;parse_file($file);
         }
         printf "Found %d examples and %d tests in path/to/some/lib\n",
                scalar $p-&gt;examples, scalar $p-&gt;tests;

       Finally, an example of parsing your own POD using the DATA filehandle.

         use Fcntl qw(:seek);
         my $p = Pod::Tests-&gt;new;

         # Seek to the beginning of the current code.
         seek(DATA, 0, SEEK_SET) || die $!;
         $p-&gt;parse_fh(\*DATA);

   <b>SUPPORT</b>
       This module has been replaced by the newer Test::Inline 2. Most testing code that currently works with
       "pod2test" should continue to work with the new version. The most notable exceptions are "=for begin" and
       "=for end", which are deprecated.

       After upgrading, Pod::Tests and "pod2test" were split out to provide a compatibility package for legacy
       code.

       "pod2test" will stay in CPAN, but should remain unchanged indefinately, with the exception of any minor
       bugs that will require squishing.

       Bugs in this dist should be reported via the following URL. Feature requests should not be submitted, as
       further development is now occuring in Test::Inline.
