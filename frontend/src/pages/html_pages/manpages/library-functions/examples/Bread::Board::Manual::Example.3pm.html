</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Bread::Board::Manual::Example - A set of examples of Bread::Board usage

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 0.37

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The goal of this set of documents it to provide examples of how you can use Bread::Board in different
       situations. It is still pretty raw and sparse right now, but more will come soon.

       Each example attempts to show a real world problem and how one might go about solving it with
       Bread::Board. These examples are currently are  born out of discussions I had with people about how they
       might be able to utilize Bread::Board.

       Bread::Board::Manual::Example::LogDispatch
           An example of how to get more dynamic behavior for your dependencies.

       Bread::Board::Manual::Example::FormSensible
           An  example of using parameterized containers and dynamic dependencies together to build a set of re-
           usable components within an application.
