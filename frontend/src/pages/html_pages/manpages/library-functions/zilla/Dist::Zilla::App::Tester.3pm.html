</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Dist::Zilla::App::Tester - testing library for Dist::Zilla::App

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 6.032

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module exports only one function, "test_dzil".

   <b>"test_dzil"</b>
       This function is used to test Dist::Zilla::App.  It receives two mandatory options. The first is the path
       to a Dist::Zilla-based distribution. The second, an array reference to a list of arguments.

       The third optional argument is a hash reference, with further options. At the moment the only supported
       option is c&lt;tempdir&gt;.

       It returns a Dist::Zilla::App::Tester::Result, that inherits from App::Cmd::Tester::Result. Typical
       methods called from this result are:

       "output"
           The output of running dzil;

       "tempdir"
           The folder used for temporary files.

       "build_dir"
           The folder where the distribution was built.

</pre><h4><b>PERL</b> <b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This  module  should  work  on any version of perl still receiving updates from the Perl 5 Porters.  This
       means it should work on any version of perl released in the last two to three years.  (That  is,  if  the
       most recently released version is v5.40, then this module should work on both v5.40 and v5.38.)

       Although  it  may  work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made that the minimum required version
       will not be increased.  The version may be increased for any reason, and there is no promise that patches
       will be accepted to lower the minimum required perl.
