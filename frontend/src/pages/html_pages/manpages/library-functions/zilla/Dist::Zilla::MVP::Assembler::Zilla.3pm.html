</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Dist::Zilla::MVP::Assembler::Zilla - Dist::Zilla::MVP::Assembler for the Dist::Zilla object

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 6.032

</pre><h4><b>OVERVIEW</b></h4><pre>
       This is a subclass of Dist::Zilla::MVP::Assembler used when assembling the Dist::Zilla object.

       It has a "zilla_class" attribute, which is used to determine what class of Dist::Zilla object to create.
       (This isn't very useful now, but will be in the future when minting and building use different subclasses
       of Dist::Zilla.)

       Upon construction, the assembler will create a Dist::Zilla::MVP::RootSection as the initial section.

</pre><h4><b>PERL</b> <b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This module should work on any version of perl still receiving updates from the Perl 5 Porters.  This
       means it should work on any version of perl released in the last two to three years.  (That is, if the
       most recently released version is v5.40, then this module should work on both v5.40 and v5.38.)

       Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made that the minimum required version
       will not be increased.  The version may be increased for any reason, and there is no promise that patches
       will be accepted to lower the minimum required perl.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>zilla</b>
       This method is a shortcut for retrieving the "zilla" from the root section.  If called before that
       section has been finalized, it will result in an exception.

   <b>register_stash</b>
         $assembler-&gt;register_stash($name =&gt; $stash_object);

       This adds a stash to the assembler's zilla's stash registry -- unless the name is already taken, in which
       case an exception is raised.
