</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Error::TypeTiny::Assertion - exception when a value fails a type constraint

</pre><h4><b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       This module is covered by the Type-Tiny stability policy.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This exception is thrown when a value fails a type constraint assertion.

       This package inherits from Error::TypeTiny; see that for most documentation. Major differences are listed
       below:

   <b>Attributes</b>
       "type"
           The  type  constraint that was checked against. Weakened links are involved, so this may end up being
           "undef".

       "value"
           The value that was tested.

       "varname"
           The name of the variable that was checked, if known. Defaults to '$_'.

       "attribute_name"
           If this exception was thrown as the result of an isa check or a failed coercion for a Moo  attribute,
           then this will tell you which attribute (if your Moo is new enough).

           (Hopefully one day this will support other OO frameworks.)

       "attribute_step"
           If  this exception was thrown as the result of an isa check or a failed coercion for a Moo attribute,
           then this will contain either "isa check" or "coercion" to indicate which went wrong (if your Moo  is
           new enough).

           (Hopefully one day this will support other OO frameworks.)

   <b>Methods</b>
       "has_type", "has_attribute_name", "has_attribute_step"
           Predicate methods.

       "message"
           Overridden to add "varname" to the message if defined.

       "explain"
           Attempts  to  explain  why the value did not pass the type constraint. Returns an arrayref of strings
           providing step-by-step reasoning; or returns undef if no explanation is possible.
