</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       exit — terminate a process

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/stdlib.h">stdlib.h</a>&gt;

       void exit(int <u>status</u>);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  functionality  described  on  this  reference  page is aligned with the ISO C standard. Any conflict
       between the requirements described  here  and  the  ISO C  standard  is  unintentional.  This  volume  of
       POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO C standard.

       The  value  of  <u>status</u>  may  be  0, EXIT_SUCCESS, EXIT_FAILURE, or any other value, though only the least
       significant 8 bits (that is, <u>status</u> &amp; 0377) shall be available from <u>wait</u>() and <u>waitpid</u>(); the full  value
       shall be available from <u>waitid</u>() and in the <b>siginfo_t</b> passed to a signal handler for SIGCHLD.

       The  <u>exit</u>() function shall first call all functions registered by <u>atexit</u>(), in the reverse order of their
       registration, except that a function is called after any previously registered functions that had already
       been called at the time it was registered. Each function is called as many times as  it  was  registered.
       If,  during  the call to any such function, a call to the <u>longjmp</u>() function is made that would terminate
       the call to the registered function, the behavior is undefined.

       If a function registered by a call to <u>atexit</u>() fails to return, the remaining registered functions  shall
       not be called and the rest of the <u>exit</u>() processing shall not be completed. If <u>exit</u>() is called more than
       once, the behavior is undefined.

       The  <u>exit</u>()  function  shall  then flush all open streams with unwritten buffered data and close all open
       streams. Finally, the process shall be terminated with the same consequences as described in <u>Consequences</u>
       <u>of</u> <u>Process</u> <u>Termination</u>.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>exit</u>() function does not return.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       No errors are defined.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       See <b>_</b><u>Exit</u>().

</pre><h4><b>FUTURE</b> <b>DIRECTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       None.
