</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       PDL::Graphics::ColorSpace - colour-space conversions for PDL

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use PDL::LiteF;
           use PDL::IO::Pic;
           use PDL::Graphics::ColorSpace;

           my $image_rgb = PDL-&gt;rpic('photo.jpg') if PDL-&gt;rpiccan('JPEG');

           # convert RGB value from [0,255] to [0,1]
           $image_rgb = $image_rgb-&gt;double / 255;

           my $image_xyz = $image_rgb-&gt;rgb_to_xyz( 'sRGB' );

       Or

           my $image_xyz = rgb_to_xyz( $image_rgb, 'sRGB' );

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Does image color space conversions such as RGB to XYZ and Lab to LCH. Derived from Graphics::ColorObject
       (Izvorski &amp; Reibenschuh, 2005) but since it's implemented in C and PDL, it runs *much* faster.

       Often the conversion will return out-of-gamut values. Retaining out-of-gamut values allows chained
       conversions to be lossless and reverse conversions to produce the original values. You can clip the
       values to be within-gamut if necessary. Please check the specific color space for the gamut range.

</pre><h4><b>COLOR</b> <b>SPACES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>RGB</b>
       An RGB color space is any additive color space based on the RGB color model. A particular RGB color space
       is defined by the three chromaticities of the red, green, and blue additive primaries, and can produce
       any chromaticity that is the triangle defined by those primary colors. The complete specification of an
       RGB color space also requires a white point chromaticity and a gamma correction curve.

       For more info on the RGB color space, see &lt;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_space">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_space</a>&gt;.

       This module expects and produces RGB values normalized to be in the range of [0,1]. If you have / need
       integer value between [0,255], divide or multiply the values by 255.

   <b>CMYK</b>
       CMYK refers to the four inks used in some color printing: cyan, magenta, yellow, and key (black). The
       CMYK model works by partially or entirely masking colors on a lighter, usually white, background. The ink
       reduces the light that would otherwise be reflected. Such a model is called subtractive because inks
       "subtract" brightness from white.

       In additive color models such as RGB, white is the "additive" combination of all primary colored lights,
       while black is the absence of light. In the CMYK model, it is the opposite: white is the natural color of
       the paper or other background, while black results from a full combination of colored inks. To save money
       on ink, and to produce deeper black tones, unsaturated and dark colors are produced by using black ink
       instead of the combination of cyan, magenta and yellow.

       For more info, see &lt;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMYK_color_model">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMYK_color_model</a>&gt;.

   <b>HSL</b>
       Hue, Saturation and Luminance (or brightness).

       The HSL color space defines colors more naturally: Hue specifies the base color, the other two values
       then let you specify the saturation of that color and how bright the color should be.

       Hue is specified here as degrees ranging from 0 to 360. There are 6 base colors:

           0    red
           60    yellow
           120    green
           180    cyan
           240    blue
           300    magenta
           360    red

       Saturation specifies the distance from the middle of the color wheel. So a saturation value of 0 (0%)
       means "center of the wheel", i.e. a grey value, whereas a saturation value of 1 (100%) means "at the
       border of the wheel", where the color is fully saturated.

       Luminance describes how "bright" the color is. 0 (0%) means 0 brightness and the color is black. 1 (100%)
       means maximum brightness and the color is white.

       For more info, see &lt;<a href="http://www.chaospro.de/documentation/html/paletteeditor/colorspace_hsl.htm">http://www.chaospro.de/documentation/html/paletteeditor/colorspace_hsl.htm</a>&gt;.

   <b>XYZ</b> <b>and</b> <b>xyY</b>
       The CIE XYZ color space was derived the CIE RGB color space. XYZ are three hypothetical primaries. Y
       means brightness, Z is quasi-equal to blue stimulation, and X is a mix which looks like red sensitivity
       curve of cones.  All visible colors can be represented by using only positive values of X, Y, and Z. The
       main advantage of the CIE XYZ space (and any color space based on it) is that this space is completely
       device-independent.

       For more info, see &lt;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIE_1931_color_space">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIE_1931_color_space</a>&gt;.

   <b>Lab</b>
       A Lab color space is a color-opponent space with dimension L for lightness and a and b for the color-
       opponent dimensions, based on nonlinearly compressed CIE XYZ color space coordinates. It's derived from
       the "master" space CIE 1931 XYZ color space but is more perceptually uniform than XYZ. The Lab space is
       relative to the white point of the XYZ data they were converted from. Lab values do not define absolute
       colors unless the white point is also specified.

       For more info, see &lt;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lab_color_space">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lab_color_space</a>&gt;.

   <b>LCH</b>
       This is possibly a little easier to comprehend than the Lab colour space, with which it shares several
       features. It is more correctly known as  L*C*H*.  Essentially it is in the form of a sphere. There are
       three axes; L* and C* and H°.

       The L* axis represents Lightness. This is vertical; from 0, which has no lightness (i.e. absolute black),
       at the bottom; through 50 in the middle, to 100 which is maximum lightness (i.e. absolute white) at the
       top.

       The C* axis represents Chroma or "saturation". This ranges from 0 at the centre of the circle, which is
       completely unsaturated (i.e. a neutral grey, black or white) to 100 or more at the edge of the circle for
       very high Chroma (saturation) or "colour purity".

       If we take a horizontal slice through the centre, we see a coloured circle. Around the edge of the circle
       we see every possible saturated colour, or Hue. This circular axis is known as H° for Hue. The units are
       in the form of degrees° (or angles), ranging from 0 (red) through 90 (yellow), 180 (green), 270 (blue)
       and back to 0.

       For more info, see &lt;<a href="http://www.colourphil.co.uk/lab_lch_colour_space.html">http://www.colourphil.co.uk/lab_lch_colour_space.html</a>&gt;.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Some conversions require specifying the RGB space which includes gamma curve and white point definitions.
       Supported RGB spaces include (aliases in square brackets):

           Adobe RGB (1998) [Adobe]
           Apple RGB [Apple]
           BestRGB
           Beta RGB
           BruceRGB
           CIE
           ColorMatch
           DonRGB4
           ECI
           Ekta Space PS5
           NTSC [601] [CIE Rec 601]
           PAL/SECAM [PAL] [CIE ITU]
           ProPhoto
           SMPTE-C [SMPTE]
           WideGamut
           sRGB [709] [CIE Rec 709]
           lsRGB

       You can also add custom RGB space definitions via the function add_rgb_space.  Alternatively, as of 0.202
       you can directly supply the function with a hash-ref in the same format.

</pre><h4><b>CONVERSIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Some conversions, if not already included as functions, can be achieved by chaining existing functions.
       For example, LCH to HSV conversion can be achieved by chaining lch_to_rgb and rgb_to_hsv:

           my $hsv = rgb_to_hsv( lch_to_rgb( $lch, 'sRGB' ), 'sRGB' );

       To generate a local diagram of what conversions are available between formats, using GraphViz, you can
       use this script:

         use blib;
         use PDL::Graphics::ColorSpace;
         print "digraph {\n";
         print join(' -&gt; ', split /_to_/), "\n"
           for grep !/^_/ &amp;&amp; /_to_/, @PDL::Graphics::ColorSpace::EXPORT_OK;
         print "}\n";
         # then:
         perl scriptname &gt;d.dot; dot -Tsvg d.dot &gt;d.svg; display d.svg

       (As of 0.202, this is everything to and from "rgb", plus "xyz" &lt;-&gt; "lab" &lt;-&gt; "lch")
