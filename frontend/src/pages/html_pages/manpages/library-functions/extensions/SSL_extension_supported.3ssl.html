</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>SSL_CTX_add_custom_ext()</b> adds a custom extension for a TLS/DTLS client or server for all supported
       protocol versions with extension type <b>ext_type</b> and callbacks <b>add_cb</b>, <b>free_cb</b> and <b>parse_cb</b> (see the
       "EXTENSION CALLBACKS" section below). The <b>context</b> value determines which messages and under what
       conditions the extension will be added/parsed (see the "EXTENSION CONTEXTS" section below).

       <b>SSL_CTX_add_client_custom_ext()</b> adds a custom extension for a TLS/DTLS client with extension type
       <b>ext_type</b> and callbacks <b>add_cb</b>, <b>free_cb</b> and <b>parse_cb</b>. This function is similar to <b>SSL_CTX_add_custom_ext()</b>
       except it only applies to clients, uses the older style of callbacks, and implicitly sets the <b>context</b>
       value to:

        SSL_EXT_TLS1_2_AND_BELOW_ONLY | SSL_EXT_CLIENT_HELLO
        | SSL_EXT_TLS1_2_SERVER_HELLO | SSL_EXT_IGNORE_ON_RESUMPTION

       <b>SSL_CTX_add_server_custom_ext()</b> adds a custom extension for a TLS/DTLS server with extension type
       <b>ext_type</b> and callbacks <b>add_cb</b>, <b>free_cb</b> and <b>parse_cb</b>. This function is similar to <b>SSL_CTX_add_custom_ext()</b>
       except it only applies to servers, uses the older style of callbacks, and implicitly sets the <b>context</b>
       value to the same as for <b>SSL_CTX_add_client_custom_ext()</b> above.

       The <b>ext_type</b> parameter corresponds to the <b>extension_type</b> field of RFC5246 et al. It is <b>not</b> a NID. In all
       cases the extension type must not be handled by OpenSSL internally or an error occurs.

       <b>SSL_extension_supported()</b> returns 1 if the extension <b>ext_type</b> is handled internally by OpenSSL and 0
       otherwise.

</pre><h4><b>EXTENSION</b> <b>CALLBACKS</b></h4><pre>
       The callback <b>add_cb</b> is called to send custom extension data to be included in various TLS messages. The
       <b>ext_type</b> parameter is set to the extension type which will be added and <b>add_arg</b> to the value set when the
       extension handler was added. When using the new style callbacks the <b>context</b> parameter will indicate which
       message is currently being constructed e.g. for the ClientHello it will be set to <b>SSL_EXT_CLIENT_HELLO</b>.

       If the application wishes to include the extension <b>ext_type</b> it should set <b>*out</b> to the extension data, set
       <b>*outlen</b> to the length of the extension data and return 1.

       If the <b>add_cb</b> does not wish to include the extension it must return 0.

       If <b>add_cb</b> returns -1 a fatal handshake error occurs using the TLS alert value specified in <b>*al</b>.

       When constructing the ClientHello, if <b>add_cb</b> is set to NULL a zero length extension is added for
       <b>ext_type</b>. For all other messages if <b>add_cb</b> is set to NULL then no extension is added.

       When constructing a Certificate message the callback will be called for each certificate in the message.
       The <b>x</b> parameter will indicate the current certificate and the <b>chainidx</b> parameter will indicate the
       position of the certificate in the message. The first certificate is always the end entity certificate
       and has a <b>chainidx</b> value of 0. The certificates are in the order that they were received in the
       Certificate message.

       For all messages except the ServerHello and EncryptedExtensions every registered <b>add_cb</b> is always called
       to see if the application wishes to add an extension (as long as all requirements of the specified
       <b>context</b> are met).

       For the ServerHello and EncryptedExtension messages every registered <b>add_cb</b> is called once if and only if
       the requirements of the specified <b>context</b> are met and the corresponding extension was received in the
       ClientHello. That is, if no corresponding extension was received in the ClientHello then <b>add_cb</b> will not
       be called.

       If an extension is added (that is <b>add_cb</b> returns 1) <b>free_cb</b> is called (if it is set) with the value of
       <b>out</b> set by the add callback. It can be used to free up any dynamic extension data set by <b>add_cb</b>. Since
       <b>out</b> is constant (to permit use of constant data in <b>add_cb</b>) applications may need to cast away const to
       free the data.

       The callback <b>parse_cb</b> receives data for TLS extensions. The callback is only called if the extension is
       present and relevant for the context (see "EXTENSION CONTEXTS" below).

       The extension data consists of <b>inlen</b> bytes in the buffer <b>in</b> for the extension <b>ext_type</b>.

       If the message being parsed is a TLSv1.3 compatible Certificate message then <b>parse_cb</b> will be called for
       each certificate contained within the message.  The <b>x</b> parameter will indicate the current certificate and
       the <b>chainidx</b> parameter will indicate the position of the certificate in the message. The first
       certificate is always the end entity certificate and has a <b>chainidx</b> value of 0.

       If the <b>parse_cb</b> considers the extension data acceptable it must return 1. If it returns 0 or a negative
       value a fatal handshake error occurs using the TLS alert value specified in <b>*al</b>.

       The buffer <b>in</b> is a temporary internal buffer which will not be valid after the callback returns.

</pre><h4><b>EXTENSION</b> <b>CONTEXTS</b></h4><pre>
       An extension context defines which messages and under which conditions an extension should be added or
       expected. The context is built up by performing a bitwise OR of multiple pre-defined values together. The
       valid context values are:

       SSL_EXT_TLS_ONLY
           The extension is only allowed in TLS

       SSL_EXT_DTLS_ONLY
           The extension is only allowed in DTLS

       SSL_EXT_TLS_IMPLEMENTATION_ONLY
           The  extension is allowed in DTLS, but there is only a TLS implementation available (so it is ignored
           in DTLS).

       SSL_EXT_SSL3_ALLOWED
           Extensions are not typically defined for SSLv3. Setting this value will allow the extension in SSLv3.
           Applications will not typically need to use this.

       SSL_EXT_TLS1_2_AND_BELOW_ONLY
           The extension is only defined for TLSv1.2/DTLSv1.2 and below. Servers will ignore this  extension  if
           it is present in the ClientHello and TLSv1.3 is negotiated.

       SSL_EXT_TLS1_3_ONLY
           The  extension  is  only  defined  for  TLS1.3 and above. Servers will ignore this extension if it is
           present in the ClientHello and TLSv1.2 or below is negotiated.

       SSL_EXT_IGNORE_ON_RESUMPTION
           The extension will be ignored during parsing if a previous session is being successfully resumed.

       SSL_EXT_CLIENT_HELLO
           The extension may be present in the ClientHello message.

       SSL_EXT_TLS1_2_SERVER_HELLO
           The extension may be present in a TLSv1.2 or below compatible ServerHello message.

       SSL_EXT_TLS1_3_SERVER_HELLO
           The extension may be present in a TLSv1.3 compatible ServerHello message.

       SSL_EXT_TLS1_3_ENCRYPTED_EXTENSIONS
           The extension may be present in an EncryptedExtensions message.

       SSL_EXT_TLS1_3_HELLO_RETRY_REQUEST
           The extension may be present in a HelloRetryRequest message.

       SSL_EXT_TLS1_3_CERTIFICATE
           The extension may be present in a TLSv1.3 compatible Certificate message.

       SSL_EXT_TLS1_3_NEW_SESSION_TICKET
           The extension may be present in a TLSv1.3 compatible NewSessionTicket message.

       SSL_EXT_TLS1_3_CERTIFICATE_REQUEST
           The extension may be present in a TLSv1.3 compatible CertificateRequest message.

       The context must include at least one message value (otherwise the extension will never be used).

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>add_arg</b> and <b>parse_arg</b> parameters can be  set  to  arbitrary  values  which  will  be  passed  to  the
       corresponding  callbacks.  They  can,  for  example,  be  used  to store the extension data received in a
       convenient structure or pass the extension data to be added or freed when adding extensions.

       If the same custom extension type is received multiple times a fatal <b>decode_error</b> alert is sent  and  the
       handshake  aborts.  If  a custom extension is received in a ServerHello/EncryptedExtensions message which
       was not sent in the ClientHello a fatal <b>unsupported_extension</b> alert is sent and the handshake is aborted.
       The ServerHello/EncryptedExtensions <b>add_cb</b> callback is only called if  the  corresponding  extension  was
       received  in  the ClientHello. This is compliant with the TLS specifications. This behaviour ensures that
       each callback is called at most once and that an application can never send unsolicited extensions.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>SSL_CTX_add_custom_ext()</b>, <b>SSL_CTX_add_client_custom_ext()</b> and  <b>SSL_CTX_add_server_custom_ext()</b>  return  1
       for  success  and  0 for failure. A failure can occur if an attempt is made to add the same <b>ext_type</b> more
       than once, if an attempt is made to use an extension type handled internally by OpenSSL or if an internal
       error occurs (for example a memory allocation failure).

       <b>SSL_extension_supported()</b> returns 1 if the extension <b>ext_type</b> is handled  internally  by  OpenSSL  and  0
       otherwise.
