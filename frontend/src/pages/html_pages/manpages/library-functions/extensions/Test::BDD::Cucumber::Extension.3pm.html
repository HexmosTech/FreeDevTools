</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Test::BDD::Cucumber::Extension - Abstract superclass for extensions

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 0.87

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Provides an abstract superclass for extensions.  Loaded extensions will have their hook-implementations
       triggered at specific points during the BDD script execution.

</pre><h4><b>PROPERTIES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>config</b>
       A hash, the configuration read from the config file, verbatim.  Extensions should look for their own
       configuration in
         $self-&gt;config-&gt;{extensions}-&gt;{&lt;extension&gt;}

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>steps_directories()</b>
       The returns an arrayref whose values enumerate directories (relative to the directory of the extension)
       which hold step files to be loaded when the extension is loaded.

   <b>pre_execute($app)</b>
       Invoked by "App::pherkin" before executing any features.  This callback allows generic extension setup.
       Reports errors by calling <b>croak()</b>. It is called once per "App::pherkin" instance.

       Note that the "TAP::Parser::SourceHandler::Feature" plugin for "prove" might instantiate multiple
       "App::pherkin" objects, meaning it will create multiple instances of the extensions too. As such, this
       callback may be called once per instance, but multiple times in a Perl image.

       The source handler "fork"s the running Perl instance in order to support the parallel testing "-j"
       option. This callback will be called pre-fork.

   <b>post_execute()</b>
       Invoked by "App::pherkin" after executing all features.  This callback allows generic extension teardown
       and cleanup. Reports errors by calling <b>croak()</b>.

       Note: When the "TAP::Parser::SourceHandler::Feature" plugin for "prove"
        is used, there are no guarantees at this point that this hook is called
        only once.

   <b>pre_feature($feature,</b> <b>$feature_stash)</b>
       Invoked by the Executor before executing the background and feature scenarios and their respective pre-
       hooks. Reports errors by calling <b>croak()</b>.

   <b>post_feature($feature,</b> <b>$feature_stash)</b>
       Invoked by the Executor after executing the background and feature scenarios and their respective post-
       hooks. Reports errors by calling <b>croak()</b>.

   <b>pre_scenario($scenario,</b> <b>$feature_stash,</b> <b>$scenario_stash)</b>
       Invoked by the Executor before executing the steps in $scenario and their respective pre-hooks. Reports
       errors by calling <b>croak()</b>.

   <b>post_scenario($scenario,</b> <b>$feature_stash,</b> <b>$scenario_stash,</b> <b>$failed)</b>
       Invoked by the Executor after executing all the steps in $scenario and their respective post-hooks.
       Reports errors by calling <b>croak()</b>.

       $failure indicates whether any of the steps in the scenario has failed.

   <b>pre_step($stepdef,</b> <b>$step_context)</b>
       Invoked by the Executor before executing each step in $scenario.  Reports errors by calling <b>croak()</b>.

       $stepdef contains a reference to an array with step data:

         [ qr//, { meta =&gt; $data }, $code ]

       Feature and scenario stashes can be reached through

         $step_context-&gt;stash-&gt;{feature}
         # and
         $step_context-&gt;stash-&gt;{scenario}

       Feature, scenario and step (from the feature file) are available as

         $step_context-&gt;feature
         $step_context-&gt;scenario
         $step_context-&gt;step

       Note: <b>executed</b> steps, so not called for skipped steps.

   <b>post_step($stepdef,</b> <b>$step_context,</b> <b>$failed,</b> <b>$result)</b>
       Invoked by the Executor after each executed step in $scenario.  Reports errors by calling <b>croak()</b>.

       $failed indicates that the step has not been completed successfully; this means the step can have failed,
       be marked as TODO or pending (not implemented).

       $result is a "Test::BDD::Cucumber::Model::Result" instance which holds the completion status of the step.

       Note: <b>executed</b> steps, so not called for skipped steps.
