       fi_collective - Collective operations

       fi_join_collective
              Operation where a subset of peers join a new collective group.

       fi_barrier / fi_barrier2
              Collective operation that does not complete until all peers have entered the barrier call.

       fi_broadcast
              A single sender transmits data to all peers, including itself.

       fi_alltoall
              Each peer distributes a slice of its local data to all peers.

       fi_allreduce
              Collective operation where all peers broadcast an atomic operation to all other peers.

       fi_allgather
              Each peer sends a complete copy of its local data to all peers.

       fi_reduce_scatter
              Collective  call  where data is collected from all peers and merged (reduced).  The results of the
              reduction is distributed back to the peers, with each peer receiving a slice of the results.

       fi_reduce
              Collective call where data is collected from all peers to a root peer and merged (reduced).

       fi_scatter
              A single sender distributes (scatters) a slice of its local data to all peers.

       fi_gather

       fi_query_collective
              Returns information about which collective operations are supported by a provider, and limitations
              on the collective.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       In general collective operations can be thought of as coordinated atomic operations between a set of peer
       endpoints.  Readers should refer to the <b><a href="../man3/fi_atomic.3.html">fi_atomic</a></b>(3) man page for details on the  atomic  operations  and
       datatypes defined by libfabric.

       A  collective  operation  is  a group communication exchange.  It involves multiple peers exchanging data
       with other peers participating in the collective call.  Collective operations require close  coordination
       by  all  participating  members.  All participants must invoke the same collective call before any single
       member can complete its operation locally.  As a result, collective calls can strain the fabric, as  well
       as local and remote data buffers.

       Libfabric  collective interfaces target fabrics that support offloading portions of the collective commu‐
       nication into network switches, NICs, and other  devices.   However,  no  implementation  requirement  is
       placed on the provider.

       The  first step in using a collective call is identifying the peer endpoints that will participate.  Col‐
       lective membership follows one of two models, both supported by libfabric.  In the first model,  the  ap‐
       plication manages the membership.  This usually means that the application is performing a collective op‐
       eration  itself  using  point to point communication to identify the members who will participate.  Addi‐
       tionally, the application may be interacting with a fabric resource manager to reserve network  resources
       needed  to  execute collective operations.  In this model, the application will inform libfabric that the
       membership has already been established.

       A separate model moves the membership management under libfabric and directly into the provider.  In this
       model, the application must identify which peer addresses will be members.  That information is  conveyed
       to  the  libfabric  provider,  which  is then responsible for coordinating the creation of the collective
       group.  In the provider managed model, the provider will usually perform the necessary collective  opera‐
       tion to establish the communication group and interact with any fabric management agents.

       In  both models, the collective membership is communicated to the provider by creating and configuring an
       address vector set (AV set).  An AV set represents an ordered subset of addresses in  an  address  vector
       (AV).  Details on creating and configuring an AV set are available in <b><a href="../man3/fi_av_set.3.html">fi_av_set</a></b>(3).

       Once  an  AV set has been programmed with the collective membership information, an endpoint is joined to
       the set.  This uses the fi_join_collective operation and operates asynchronously.  This differs from  how
       an  endpoint  is associated synchronously with an AV using the fi_ep_bind() call.  Upon completion of the
       fi_join_collective operation, an fi_addr is provided that is used as the target address when  invoking  a
       collective operation.

       For developer convenience, a set of collective APIs are defined.  Collective APIs differ from message and
       RMA interfaces in that the format of the data is known to the provider, and the collective may perform an
       operation on that data.  This aligns collective operations closely with the atomic interfaces.

   <b>Join</b> <b>Collective</b> <b>(fi_join_collective)</b>
       This  call attaches an endpoint to a collective membership group.  Libfabric treats collective members as
       a multicast group, and the fi_join_collective call attaches the endpoint to that multicast group.  By de‐
       fault, the endpoint will join the group based on the data transfer capabilities of the endpoint.  For ex‐
       ample, if the endpoint has been configured to both send and receive data, then the endpoint will be  able
       to  initiate  and  receive transfers to and from the collective.  The input flags may be used to restrict
       access to the collective group, subject to endpoint capability limitations.

       Join collective operations complete asynchronously, and may involve fabric transfers,  dependent  on  the
       provider  implementation.   An  endpoint must be bound to an event queue prior to calling fi_join_collec‐
       tive.  The result of the join operation will be reported to the EQ as an FI_JOIN_COMPLETE event.   Appli‐
       cations  cannot  issue collective transfers until receiving notification that the join operation has com‐
       pleted.  Note that an endpoint may begin receiving messages from the collective group as soon as the join
       completes, which can occur prior to the FI_JOIN_COMPLETE event being generated.

       The join collective operation is itself a  collective  operation.   All  participating  peers  must  call
       fi_join_collective  before any individual peer will report that the join has completed.  Application man‐
       aged collective memberships are an exception.  With application managed memberships, the  fi_join_collec‐
       tive  call  may be completed locally without fabric communication.  For provider managed memberships, the
       join collective call requires as input a coll_addr that refers to either an address associated with an AV
       set (see  fi_av_set_addr)  or  an  existing  collective  group  (obtained  through  a  previous  call  to
       fi_join_collective).   The fi_join_collective call will create a new collective subgroup.  If application
       managed memberships are used, coll_addr should be set to FI_ADDR_UNAVAIL.

       Applications must call fi_close on the collective group to disconnect the endpoint from the group.  After
       a join operation has completed, the fi_mc_addr call may be used to retrieve the address  associated  with
       the multicast group.  See <b><a href="../man3/fi_cm.3.html">fi_cm</a></b>(3) for additional details on fi_mc_addr().

   <b>Barrier</b> <b>(fi_barrier)</b>
       The  fi_barrier operation provides a mechanism to synchronize peers.  Barrier does not result in any data
       being transferred at the application level.  A barrier does not complete locally until all peers have in‐
       voked the barrier call.  This signifies to the local application that work by peers that completed  prior
       to them calling barrier has finished.

   <b>Barrier</b> <b>(fi_barrier2)</b>
       The  fi_barrier2  operations  is the same as fi_barrier, but with an extra parameter to pass in operation
       flags.

   <b>Broadcast</b> <b>(fi_broadcast)</b>
       fi_broadcast transfers an array of data from a single sender to  all  other  members  of  the  collective
       group.   The  input buf parameter is treated as the transmit buffer if the local rank is the root, other‐
       wise it is the receive buffer.  The broadcast operation acts as an atomic write or read to a data  array.
       As  a  result,  the  format of the data in buf is specified through the datatype parameter.  Any non-void
       datatype may be broadcast.

       The following diagram shows an example of broadcast being used to transfer an  array  of  integers  to  a
       group of peers.

              [1]  [1]  [1]
              [5]  [5]  [5]
              [9]  [9]  [9]
               |____^    ^
               |_________|
               broadcast

   <b>All</b> <b>to</b> <b>All</b> <b>(fi_alltoall)</b>
       The  fi_alltoall  collective involves distributing (or scattering) different portions of an array of data
       to peers.  It is best explained using an example.  Here three peers perform an all to all  collective  to
       exchange different entries in an integer array.

              [1]   [2]   [3]
              [5]   [6]   [7]
              [9]  [10]  [11]
                 \   |   /
                 All to all
                 /   |   \
              [1]   [5]   [9]
              [2]   [6]  [10]
              [3]   [7]  [11]

       Each peer sends a piece of its data to the other peers.

       All to all operations may be performed on any non-void datatype.  However, all to all does not perform an
       operation on the data itself, so no operation is specified.

   <b>All</b> <b>Reduce</b> <b>(fi_allreduce)</b>
       fi_allreduce  can  be  described  as  all peers providing input into an atomic operation, with the result
       copied back to each peer.  Conceptually, this can be viewed as each peer issuing a multicast atomic oper‐
       ation to all other peers, fetching the results, and combining them.  The combining of the results is  re‐
       ferred  to as the reduction.  The fi_allreduce() operation takes as input an array of data and the speci‐
       fied atomic operation to perform.  The results of the reduction are written into the result buffer.

       Any non-void datatype may be specified.  Valid atomic operations are listed below in the fi_query_collec‐
       tive call.  The following diagram shows an example of an all reduce operation involving summing an  array
       of integers between three peers.

               [1]  [1]  [1]
               [5]  [5]  [5]
               [9]  [9]  [9]
                 \   |   /
                    sum
                 /   |   \
               [3]  [3]  [3]
              [15] [15] [15]
              [27] [27] [27]
                All Reduce

   <b>All</b> <b>Gather</b> <b>(fi_allgather)</b>
       Conceptually, all gather can be viewed as the opposite of the scatter component from reduce-scatter.  All
       gather collects data from all peers into a single array, then copies that array back to each peer.

              [1]  [5]  [9]
                \   |   /
               All gather
                /   |   \
              [1]  [1]  [1]
              [5]  [5]  [5]
              [9]  [9]  [9]

       All  gather may be performed on any non-void datatype.  However, all gather does not perform an operation
       on the data itself, so no operation is specified.

   <b>Reduce-Scatter</b> <b>(fi_reduce_scatter)</b>
       The fi_reduce_scatter collective is similar to an fi_allreduce operation, followed by all to  all.   With
       reduce scatter, all peers provide input into an atomic operation, similar to all reduce.  However, rather
       than the full result being copied to each peer, each participant receives only a slice of the result.

       This is shown by the following example:

              [1]  [1]  [1]
              [5]  [5]  [5]
              [9]  [9]  [9]
                \   |   /
                   sum (reduce)
                    |
                   [3]
                  [15]
                  [27]
                    |
                 scatter
                /   |   \
              [3] [15] [27]

       The reduce scatter call supports the same datatype and atomic operation as fi_allreduce.

   <b>Reduce</b> <b>(fi_reduce)</b>
       The  fi_reduce collective is the first half of an fi_allreduce operation.  With reduce, all peers provide
       input into an atomic operation, with the the results collected by a single `root' endpoint.

       This is shown by the following example, with the leftmost peer identified as the root:

              [1]  [1]  [1]
              [5]  [5]  [5]
              [9]  [9]  [9]
                \   |   /
                   sum (reduce)
                  /
               [3]
              [15]
              [27]

       The reduce call supports the same datatype and atomic operation as fi_allreduce.

   <b>Scatter</b> <b>(fi_scatter)</b>
       The fi_scatter collective is the second half of an fi_reduce_scatter operation.  The data from  a  single
       `root' endpoint is split and distributed to all peers.

       This is shown by the following example:

               [3]
              [15]
              [27]
                  \
                 scatter
                /   |   \
              [3] [15] [27]

       The  scatter  operation  is used to distribute results to the peers.  No atomic operation is performed on
       the data.

   <b>Gather</b> <b>(fi_gather)</b>
       The fi_gather operation is used to collect (gather) the results from all peers and store them at a `root'
       peer.

       This is shown by the following example, with the leftmost peer identified as the root.

              [1]  [5]  [9]
                \   |   /
                  gather
                 /
              [1]
              [5]
              [9]

       The gather operation does not perform any operation on the data itself.

   <b>Query</b> <b>Collective</b> <b>Attributes</b> <b>(fi_query_collective)</b>
       The fi_query_collective call  reports  which  collective  operations  are  supported  by  the  underlying
       provider, for suitably configured endpoints.  Collective operations needed by an application that are not
       supported  by  the  provider  must  be  implemented  by the application.  The query call checks whether a
       provider supports a specific collective operation for a given datatype and operation, if applicable.

       The name of the collective, as well as the datatype and associated operation, if applicable, and are pro‐
       vided as input into fi_query_collective.

       The coll parameter may  reference  one  of  these  collectives:  FI_BARRIER,  FI_BROADCAST,  FI_ALLTOALL,
       FI_ALLREDUCE,  FI_ALLGATHER,  FI_REDUCE_SCATTER, FI_REDUCE, FI_SCATTER, or FI_GATHER.  Additional details
       on the collective operation is specified through the struct fi_collective_attr  parameter.   For  collec‐
       tives that act on data, the operation and related data type must be specified through the given attribut‐
       es.

              struct fi_collective_attr {
                  enum fi_op op;
                  enum fi_datatype datatype;
                  struct fi_atomic_attr datatype_attr;
                  size_t max_members;
                    uint64_t mode;
              };

       For a description of struct fi_atomic_attr, see <b><a href="../man3/fi_atomic.3.html">fi_atomic</a></b>(3).

       <u>op</u>     On  input,  this specifies the atomic operation involved with the collective call.  This should be
              set to one of the following values: FI_MIN, FI_MAX,  FI_SUM,  FI_PROD,  FI_LOR,  FI_LAND,  FI_BOR,
              FI_BAND,  FI_LXOR,  FI_BXOR, FI_ATOMIC_READ, FI_ATOMIC_WRITE, of FI_NOOP.  For collectives that do
              not exchange application data (fi_barrier), this should be set to FI_NOOP.

       <u>datatype</u>
              On onput, specifies the datatype of the data being modified by the collective.  This should be set
              to one of the following values:  FI_INT8,  FI_UINT8,  FI_INT16,  FI_UINT16,  FI_INT32,  FI_UINT32,
              FI_INT64,  FI_UINT64,  FI_FLOAT,  FI_DOUBLE,  FI_FLOAT_COMPLEX, FI_DOUBLE_COMPLEX, FI_LONG_DOUBLE,
              FI_LONG_DOUBLE_COMPLEX, or FI_VOID.   For  collectives  that  do  not  exchange  application  data
              (fi_barrier), this should be set to FI_VOID.

       <u>datatype_attr.count</u>
              The maximum number of elements that may be used with the collective.

       <u>datatype_attr.size</u>
              The  size  of the datatype as supported by the provider.  Applications should validate the size of
              datatypes that differ based on the platform, such as FI_LONG_DOUBLE.

       <u>max_members</u>
              The maximum number of peers that may participate in a collective operation.

       <u>mode</u>   This field is reserved and should be 0.

       If a collective operation is supported, the query call will return FI_SUCCESS, along with  attributes  on
       the limits for using that collective operation through the provider.

   <b>Completions</b>
       Collective  operations map to underlying fi_atomic operations.  For a discussion of atomic completion se‐
       mantics, see <b><a href="../man3/fi_atomic.3.html">fi_atomic</a></b>(3).  The completion, ordering, and atomicity of collective operations match  those
       defined for point to point atomic operations.

</pre><h4><b>FLAGS</b></h4><pre>
       The following flags are defined for the specified operations.

       <u>FI_SCATTER</u>
              Applies  to  fi_query_collective.   When set, requests attribute information on the reduce-scatter
              collective operation.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       Returns 0 on success.  On error, a negative value corresponding to fabric errno is returned.  Fabric  er‐
       rno values are defined in <b>rdma/fi_errno.h</b>.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>-FI_EAGAIN</u>
              See <b><a href="../man3/fi_msg.3.html">fi_msg</a></b>(3) for a detailed description of handling FI_EAGAIN.

       <u>-FI_EOPNOTSUPP</u>
              The requested atomic operation is not supported on this endpoint.

       <u>-FI_EMSGSIZE</u>
              The  number  of collective operations in a single request exceeds that supported by the underlying
              provider.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       Collective operations map to atomic operations.  As such, they follow most of  the  conventions  and  re‐
       strictions  as peer to peer atomic operations.  This includes data atomicity, data alignment, and message
       ordering semantics.  See <b><a href="../man3/fi_atomic.3.html">fi_atomic</a></b>(3) for additional information on the datatypes and operations  defined
       for atomic and collective operations.
