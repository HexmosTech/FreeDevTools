</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       XGetWindowAttributes,  XGetGeometry,  XWindowAttributes  -  get  current window attribute or geometry and
       current window attributes structure

</pre><h4><b>SYNTAX</b></h4><pre>

       Status XGetWindowAttributes(Display *<u>display</u>, Window <u>w</u>, XWindowAttributes *<u>window_attributes_return</u>);

       Status XGetGeometry(Display *<u>display</u>, Drawable <u>d</u>, Window  *<u>root_return</u>,  int  *<u>x_return</u>,  int  *<u>y_return</u>,
              unsigned  int  *<u>width_return</u>,  unsigned  int  *<u>height_return</u>,  unsigned  int *<u>border_width_return</u>,
              unsigned int *<u>depth_return</u>);

</pre><h4><b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>border_width_return</u>
                 Returns the border width in pixels.

       <u>d</u>         Specifies the drawable, which can be a window or a pixmap.

       <u>depth_return</u>
                 Returns the depth of the drawable (bits per pixel for the object).

       <u>display</u>   Specifies the connection to the X server.

       <u>root_return</u>
                 Returns the root window.

       <u>w</u>         Specifies the window whose current attributes you want to obtain.

       <u>width_return</u>
       <u>height_return</u>
                 Return the drawable's dimensions (width and height).

       <u>window_attributes_return</u>
                 Returns the specified window's attributes in the <b>XWindowAttributes</b> structure.

       <u>x_return</u>
       <u>y_return</u>  Return the x and y coordinates that define the location of the drawable.  For a  window,  these
                 coordinates  specify the upper-left outer corner relative to its parent's origin.  For pixmaps,
                 these coordinates are always zero.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>XGetWindowAttributes</b> function  returns  the  current  attributes  for  the  specified  window  to  an
       <b>XWindowAttributes</b>  structure.   It  returns  a  nonzero  status  on success; otherwise, it returns a zero
       status.

       <b>XGetWindowAttributes</b> can generate <b>BadDrawable</b> and <b>BadWindow</b> errors.

       The <b>XGetGeometry</b> function returns the root window and the current geometry of the drawable.  The geometry
       of the drawable includes the x and y coordinates, width and height, border width, and depth.   These  are
       described  in the argument list.  It is legal to pass to this function a window whose class is <b>InputOnly</b>.
       It returns a nonzero status on success; otherwise, it returns a zero status.

</pre><h4><b>STRUCTURES</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>XWindowAttributes</b> structure contains:

       typedef struct {
               int x, y;       /* location of window */
               int width, height;      /* width and height of window */
               int border_width;       /* border width of window */
               int depth;      /* depth of window */
               Visual *visual; /* the associated visual structure */
               Window root;    /* root of screen containing window */
               int class;      /* InputOutput, InputOnly*/
               int bit_gravity;        /* one of the bit gravity values */
               int win_gravity;        /* one of the window gravity values */
               int backing_store;      /* NotUseful, WhenMapped, Always */
               unsigned long backing_planes;   /* planes to be preserved if possible */
               unsigned long backing_pixel;    /* value to be used when restoring planes */
               Bool save_under;        /* boolean, should bits under be saved? */
               Colormap colormap;      /* color map to be associated with window */
               Bool map_installed;     /* boolean, is color map currently installed*/
               int map_state;  /* IsUnmapped, IsUnviewable, IsViewable */
               long all_event_masks;   /* set of events all people have interest in*/
               long your_event_mask;   /* my event mask */
               long do_not_propagate_mask;     /* set of events that should not propagate */
               Bool override_redirect; /* boolean value for override-redirect */
               Screen *screen; /* back pointer to correct screen */
       } XWindowAttributes;

       The x and y members are set to the upper-left outer corner relative to the parent window's  origin.   The
       width  and  height  members  are  set  to  the  inside size of the window, not including the border.  The
       border_width member is set to the window's border width in pixels.  The depth member is set to the  depth
       of  the  window (that is, bits per pixel for the object).  The visual member is a pointer to the screen's
       associated <b>Visual</b> structure.  The root member is set to the root window  of  the  screen  containing  the
       window.  The class member is set to the window's class and can be either <b>InputOutput</b> or <b>InputOnly</b>.

       The bit_gravity member is set to the window's bit gravity and can be one of the following:

       <b>ForgetGravity</b>      <b>EastGravity</b>
       <b>NorthWestGravity</b>   <b>SouthWestGravity</b>
       <b>NorthGravity</b>       <b>SouthGravity</b>
       <b>NorthEastGravity</b>   <b>SouthEastGravity</b>
       <b>WestGravity</b>        <b>StaticGravity</b>
       <b>CenterGravity</b>

       The win_gravity member is set to the window's window gravity and can be one of the following:

       <b>UnmapGravity</b>       <b>EastGravity</b>
       <b>NorthWestGravity</b>   <b>SouthWestGravity</b>
       <b>NorthGravity</b>       <b>SouthGravity</b>
       <b>NorthEastGravity</b>   <b>SouthEastGravity</b>
       <b>WestGravity</b>        <b>StaticGravity</b>
       <b>CenterGravity</b>

       For additional information on gravity, see section 3.3.

       The backing_store member is set to indicate how the X server should maintain the contents of a window and
       can  be <b>WhenMapped</b>, <b>Always</b>, or <b>NotUseful</b>.  The backing_planes member is set to indicate (with bits set to
       1) which bit planes of the window hold dynamic data that must be preserved in backing_stores  and  during
       save_unders.   The  backing_pixel  member  is  set  to  indicate what values to use for planes not set in
       backing_planes.

       The save_under member is set to <b>True</b> or <b>False</b>.  The colormap member  is  set  to  the  colormap  for  the
       specified  window  and can be a colormap ID or <b>None</b>.  The map_installed member is set to indicate whether
       the colormap is currently installed and can be <b>True</b> or <b>False</b>.  The map_state member is  set  to  indicate
       the  state of the window and can be <b>IsUnmapped</b>, <b>IsUnviewable</b>, or <b>IsViewable</b>.  <b>IsUnviewable</b> is used if the
       window is mapped but some ancestor is unmapped.

       The all_event_masks member is set to the bitwise inclusive OR of all event masks selected on  the  window
       by  all  clients.   The  your_event_mask  member  is  set  to the bitwise inclusive OR of all event masks
       selected by the querying client.  The do_not_propagate_mask member is set to the bitwise inclusive OR  of
       the set of events that should not propagate.

       The  override_redirect  member  is  set  to  indicate  whether  this  window  overrides structure control
       facilities and can be <b>True</b> or <b>False</b>.  Window manager clients should ignore the window if this  member  is
       <b>True</b>.

       The  screen  member is set to a screen pointer that gives you a back pointer to the correct screen.  This
       makes it easier to obtain the screen information without having to loop over the root  window  fields  to
       see which field matches.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>BadDrawable</b>
                 A value for a Drawable argument does not name a defined Window or Pixmap.

       <b>BadWindow</b> A value for a Window argument does not name a defined Window.
