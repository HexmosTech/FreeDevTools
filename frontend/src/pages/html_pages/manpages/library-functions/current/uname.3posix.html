</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       uname — get the name of the current system

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;sys/utsname.h&gt;

       int uname(struct utsname *<u>name</u>);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>uname</u>()  function shall store information identifying the current system in the structure pointed to
       by <u>name</u>.

       The <u>uname</u>() function uses the <b>utsname</b> structure defined in <u>&lt;sys/utsname.h&gt;</u>.

       The <u>uname</u>() function shall return a string naming the current system  in  the  character  array  <u>sysname</u>.
       Similarly,  <u>nodename</u>  shall contain the name of this node within an implementation-defined communications
       network. The arrays <u>release</u> and <u>version</u> shall further identify the operating system.  The  array  <u>machine</u>
       shall contain a name that identifies the hardware that the system is running on.

       The format of each member is implementation-defined.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       Upon  successful completion, a non-negative value shall be returned.  Otherwise, -1 shall be returned and
       <u>errno</u> set to indicate the error.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       No errors are defined.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       The inclusion of the <u>nodename</u> member in this structure does not imply that it is  sufficient  information
       for interfacing to communications networks.

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       The  values  of  the  structure  members  are not constrained to have any relation to the version of this
       volume of POSIX.1‐2017 implemented in the operating system.  An  application  should  instead  depend  on
       _POSIX_VERSION and related constants defined in <u>&lt;unistd.h&gt;</u>.

       This volume of POSIX.1‐2017 does not define the sizes of the members of the structure and permits them to
       be  of  different  sizes,  although most implementations define them all to be the same size: eight bytes
       plus one byte for the string terminator. That size for <u>nodename</u> is not enough for use with many networks.

       The <u>uname</u>() function originated in System III, System V, and related implementations,  and  it  does  not
       exist  in  Version 7 or 4.3 BSD. The values it returns are set at system compile time in those historical
       implementations.

       4.3 BSD  has  <u>gethostname</u>()  and  <u>gethostid</u>(),  which  return  a  symbolic  name  and  a  numeric  value,
       respectively.  There  are related <u>sethostname</u>() and <u>sethostid</u>() functions that are used to set the values
       the other two functions return. The former functions are included in this specification, the  latter  are
       not.

</pre><h4><b>FUTURE</b> <b>DIRECTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       None.
