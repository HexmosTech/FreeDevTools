       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       dlopen — open a symbol table handle

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/dlfcn.h">dlfcn.h</a>&gt;

       void *dlopen(const char *<u>file</u>, int <u>mode</u>);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>dlopen</u>()  function  shall make the symbols (function identifiers and data object identifiers) in the
       executable object file specified by <u>file</u> available to the calling program.

       The class of executable object files eligible for this operation and the manner of their construction are
       implementation-defined, though typically such files are shared libraries or programs.

       Implementations may permit the construction of embedded dependencies in executable object files. In  such
       cases,  a  <u>dlopen</u>()  operation  shall  load  those dependencies in addition to the executable object file
       specified by <u>file</u>.  Implementations may also impose specific constraints on the construction of  programs
       that can employ <u>dlopen</u>() and its related services.

       A  successful <u>dlopen</u>() shall return a symbol table handle which the caller may use on subsequent calls to
       <u>dlsym</u>() and <u>dlclose</u>().

       The value of this symbol table handle should not be interpreted in any way by the caller.

       The <u>file</u> argument is used to construct a pathname to the executable  object  file.  If  <u>file</u>  contains  a
       &lt;slash&gt;  character, the <u>file</u> argument is used as the pathname for the file. Otherwise, <u>file</u> is used in an
       implementation-defined manner to yield a pathname.

       If <u>file</u> is a null pointer, <u>dlopen</u>() shall return a global symbol table handle for the  currently  running
       process  image.  This  symbol  table  handle  shall  provide access to the symbols from an ordered set of
       executable object files consisting of the original program image file, any executable object files loaded
       at program start-up as specified by that process file (for example, shared libraries),  and  the  set  of
       executable  object files loaded using <u>dlopen</u>() operations with the RTLD_GLOBAL flag. As the latter set of
       executable object files can change during execution, the set of symbols made  available  by  this  symbol
       table handle can also change dynamically.

       Only a single copy of an executable object file shall be brought into the address space, even if <u>dlopen</u>()
       is invoked multiple times in reference to the executable object file, and even if different pathnames are
       used to reference the executable object file.

       The  <u>mode</u>  parameter  describes  how  <u>dlopen</u>()  shall operate upon <u>file</u> with respect to the processing of
       relocations and the scope of visibility of the symbols provided within <u>file</u>.  When an  executable  object
       file is brought into the address space of a process, it may contain references to symbols whose addresses
       are not known until the executable object file is loaded.

       These  references  shall be relocated before the symbols can be accessed. The <u>mode</u> parameter governs when
       these relocations take place and may have the following values:

       RTLD_LAZY   Relocations shall be performed at an implementation-defined time, ranging from  the  time  of
                   the  <u>dlopen</u>()  call  until the first reference to a given symbol occurs. Specifying RTLD_LAZY
                   should improve performance on implementations  supporting  dynamic  symbol  binding  since  a
                   process might not reference all of the symbols in an executable object file. And, for systems
                   supporting  dynamic  symbol resolution for normal process execution, this behavior mimics the
                   normal handling of process execution.

       RTLD_NOW    All necessary relocations shall be performed when the executable object file is first loaded.
                   This may waste some processing if relocations  are  performed  for  symbols  that  are  never
                   referenced.  This  behavior may be useful for applications that need to know that all symbols
                   referenced during execution will be available before <u>dlopen</u>() returns.

       Any executable object file loaded by <u>dlopen</u>()  that  requires  relocations  against  global  symbols  can
       reference  the  symbols in the original process image file, any executable object files loaded at program
       start-up, from the initial process image itself, from any other executable object file  included  in  the
       same <u>dlopen</u>() invocation, and any executable object files that were loaded in any <u>dlopen</u>() invocation and
       which  specified the RTLD_GLOBAL flag. To determine the scope of visibility for the symbols loaded with a
       <u>dlopen</u>() invocation, the <u>mode</u> parameter should be a  bitwise-inclusive  OR  with  one  of  the  following
       values:

       RTLD_GLOBAL The executable object file's symbols shall be made available for relocation processing of any
                   other  executable  object  file.  In  addition,  symbol lookup using <u>dlopen</u>(NULL,<u>mode</u>) and an
                   associated <u>dlsym</u>() allows executable object files loaded with this mode to be searched.

       RTLD_LOCAL  The executable object file's symbols shall not be made available for relocation processing of
                   any other executable object file.

       If neither RTLD_GLOBAL nor RTLD_LOCAL is specified, the default behavior is unspecified.

       If an executable object file is specified in multiple <u>dlopen</u>() invocations, <u>mode</u> is interpreted  at  each
       invocation.

       If  RTLD_NOW  has  been  specified,  all relocations shall have been completed rendering further RTLD_NOW
       operations redundant and any further RTLD_LAZY operations irrelevant.

       If RTLD_GLOBAL has been specified, the executable object  file  shall  maintain  the  RTLD_GLOBAL  status
       regardless  of  any previous or future specification of RTLD_LOCAL, as long as the executable object file
       remains in the address space (see <u>dlclose</u>()).

       Symbols introduced into the process image through calls to <u>dlopen</u>() may be used in relocation activities.
       Symbols so introduced may  duplicate  symbols  already  defined  by  the  program  or  previous  <u>dlopen</u>()
       operations.  To  resolve  the  ambiguities  such  a  situation  might present, the resolution of a symbol
       reference to symbol definition is based on a symbol resolution order.  Two  such  resolution  orders  are
       defined:  load  order  and dependency order. Load order establishes an ordering among symbol definitions,
       such that the first definition loaded  (including  definitions  from  the  process  image  file  and  any
       dependent  executable  object files loaded with it) has priority over executable object files added later
       (by <u>dlopen</u>()).  Load ordering is used in relocation processing. Dependency ordering uses a  breadth-first
       order  starting with a given executable object file, then all of its dependencies, then any dependents of
       those, iterating until all dependencies are satisfied. With the exception  of  the  global  symbol  table
       handle obtained via a <u>dlopen</u>() operation with a null pointer as the <u>file</u> argument, dependency ordering is
       used  by  the  <u>dlsym</u>() function. Load ordering is used in <u>dlsym</u>() operations upon the global symbol table
       handle.

       When an executable object file is first made accessible via <u>dlopen</u>(), it  and  its  dependent  executable
       object  files  are added in dependency order. Once all the executable object files are added, relocations
       are performed using load order. Note that if an executable object  file  or  its  dependencies  had  been
       previously loaded, the load and dependency orders may yield different resolutions.

       The  symbols introduced by <u>dlopen</u>() operations and available through <u>dlsym</u>() are at a minimum those which
       are exported as identifiers of global scope by the executable object file.  Typically,  such  identifiers
       shall  be  those that were specified in (for example) C source code as having <b>extern</b> linkage. The precise
       manner in which an implementation constructs the set of exported symbols for an executable object file is
       implementation-defined.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       Upon successful completion, <u>dlopen</u>() shall return a symbol table handle. If <u>file</u> cannot be found,  cannot
       be opened for reading, is not of an appropriate executable object file format for processing by <u>dlopen</u>(),
       or  if an error occurs during the process of loading <u>file</u> or relocating its symbolic references, <u>dlopen</u>()
       shall return a null pointer. More detailed diagnostic information shall be available through <u>dlerror</u>().
