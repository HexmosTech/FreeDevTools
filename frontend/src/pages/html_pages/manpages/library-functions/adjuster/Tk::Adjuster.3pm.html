       Tk::Adjuster - Allow size of packed widgets to be adjusted by user

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       use Tk::Adjuster;

       <u>$adjuster</u> = <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>Adjuster</b><u>(?options?)</u>;

</pre><h4><b>WIDGET-SPECIFIC</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Name: <b>restore</b>
       Class: <b>Restore</b>
       Switch: <b>-restore</b>
           Specifies  a  boolean value that determines whether the Adjuster should forcibly attempt to make room
           for itself (by reducing the size of its managed widget) when it is unmapped (for example,  due  to  a
           size change in a top level window).  The default value is 1.

       Name: <b>side</b>
       Class: <b>Side</b>
       Switch: <b>-side</b>
           Specifies the side on which the managed widget lies relative to the Adjuster. In conjunction with the
           pack  geometry  manager,  this relates to the side of the master against which the managed widget and
           the Adjuster are packed.  Must be <b>left</b>, <b>right</b>, <b>top</b>, or <b>bottom</b>. Defaults to <b>top</b>.

       Name: <b>widget</b>
       Class: <b>Widget</b>
       Switch: <b>-widget</b>
           Specifies the widget which is to be managed by the Adjuster.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Tk::Adjuster</b> is a Frame containing a "line" and a "blob".

       Dragging with Mouse Button-1 results in a line being dragged to indicate  new  size.  Releasing  Button-1
       submits  GeometryRequests  on  behalf  of  the  managed  widget which will cause the packer to change the
       widget's size.

       If Drag is done with Shift button down, then GeometryRequests are made in "real time" so  that  text-flow
       effects can be seen, but as a lot more work is done behaviour may be sluggish.

       If  widget  is packed with -side =&gt; left or -side =&gt; right then width is adjusted. If packed -side =&gt; top
       or -side =&gt; bottom then height is adjusted.

       <b>packPropagate</b> is turned off for the master window to prevent adjustment  changing  overall  window  size.
       Similarly  <b>packPropagate</b>  is turned off for the managed widget if it has things packed inside it. This is
       so that the GeometryRequests made by <b>Tk::Adjuster</b> are not overridden by pack.

       In addition, the managed widget is made non-expandable to prevent the geometry manager reallocating freed
       space in the master back to the managed widget.  Note however that expansion is turned off only after the
       Adjuster is mapped, which allows the managed widget to expand naturally on window creation.

       The Tk::Widget method, <b>packAdjust</b>, calls pack on the widget, then creates an  instance  of  <b>Tk::Adjuster</b>,
       and packs that "after" the widget. Its use has two disadvantages however: the Adjuster widget is not made
       available  to  the caller, and options cannot be set on the Adjuster. For these reasons, the Tk::Adjuster
       method, <b>packAfter</b> is preferred, but <b>packAdjust</b> is retained for backwards compatibility.

</pre><h4><b>WIDGET</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>$adjuster</u>-&gt;<b>packAfter</b>(<u>managed_widget,</u> <u>?pack_options?</u>)
           This command configures the Adjuster's <b>-widget</b> and <b>-side</b> options respectively to  <u>managed_widget</u>  and
           the  <b>-side</b>  value  specified in <u>pack_options</u> (<b>top</b> if not specified). It then packs the Adjuster after
           <u>managed_widget</u>, with <b>-fill</b> set to <b>x</b> or <b>y</b> as appropriate.

       <u>$adjuster</u>-&gt;<b>packForget</b><u>?(boolean)?</u>
           This command calls <b>Tk::Widget::packForget</b> on the Adjuster.  If a parameter is provided and it  has  a
           true boolean value, then <b>packForget</b> is also called on the managed widget.

       <u>$adjuster</u>-&gt;<b>slave</b>
           This command returns the value <u>$adjuster</u>-&gt;<u>cget('-widget')</u>, ie. the reference to the managed widget.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Using</b>  <b>an</b>  <b>Adjuster</b> <b>to</b> <b>separate</b> <b>two</b> <b>widgets,</b> <b>whereby</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>widget</b> <b>is</b> <b>managed,</b> <b>and</b> <b>right</b> <b>widget</b> <b>expands</b>
       <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> <b>space</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>window</b> <b>resize</b>

       a) Using packAfter (preferred interface)

         use Tk;
         use Tk::Adjuster;

         my $f = MainWindow-&gt;new;
         my $lst1 = $f-&gt;Listbox();
         my $adj1 = $f-&gt;Adjuster();
         my $lst2 = $f-&gt;Listbox();

         my $side = 'left';
         $lst1-&gt;pack(-side =&gt; $side, -fill =&gt; 'both', -expand =&gt; 1);
         $adj1-&gt;packAfter($lst1, -side =&gt; $side);
         $lst2-&gt;pack(-side =&gt; $side, -fill =&gt; 'both', -expand =&gt; 1);
         MainLoop;

       b) Using packAdjust

         use Tk;
         use Tk::Adjuster;

         my $f = MainWindow-&gt;new;
         my $lst1 = $f-&gt;Listbox();
         my $lst2 = $f-&gt;Listbox();

         my $side = 'left';
         $lst1-&gt;packAdjust(-side =&gt; $side, -fill =&gt; 'both');
         $lst2-&gt;pack      (-side =&gt; $side, -fill =&gt; 'both', -expand =&gt; 1);
         MainLoop;

       c) Using the standard Tk::Widget::pack

         use Tk;
         use Tk::Adjuster;

         my $f = MainWindow-&gt;new;
         my $side = 'left';
         my $lst1 = $f-&gt;Listbox();
         my $adj  = $f-&gt;Adjuster(-widget =&gt; $lst1, -side =&gt; $side);
         my $lst2 = $f-&gt;Listbox();

         $lst1-&gt;pack(-side =&gt; $side, -fill =&gt; 'both', -expand =&gt; 1);
         $adj-&gt;pack (-side =&gt; $side, -fill =&gt; 'y');
         $lst2-&gt;pack(-side =&gt; $side, -fill =&gt; 'both', -expand =&gt; 1);

         MainLoop;

       Changing the above examples so that $side has the value 'right' means the left  widget  expands  to  fill
       space on a window resize.

       Changing  the  above  examples  so  that  $side has the value 'top' produces a testcase with a horizontal
       Adjuster.  Here the bottom widget expands to fill space on a window  resize.   Packing  to  the  'bottom'
       makes the top widget expand to fill space on window resize.

       <b>Using</b> <b>-restore</b> <b>=&gt;</b> <b>0</b> <b>for</b> <b>multiple</b> <b>columns</b>

       In  the  case  of  multiple  columns  (or  rows)  the  "restore"  functionality  of  the  Adjuster can be
       inconvenient. When the user adjusts the width of one column and thereby pushes the  Adjuster  of  another
       column  off the window, this adjuster tries to restore itself by reducing the size of its managed widget.
       This has the effect that column widths shrink; and the original  size  is  not  restored  when  the  user
       reverses  the  originating  change.  The  <b>-restore</b> option can be used to turn off this functionality. (It
       makes some sense, however, to leave <b>-restore</b> turned on for the first-packed Adjuster, so  that  at  least
       one Adjuster always remains visible.)

         use Tk;
         use Tk::Adjuster;
         my $f = MainWindow-&gt;new;
         my $lst1 = $f-&gt;Listbox();
         my $adj1 = $f-&gt;Adjuster();
         my $lst2 = $f-&gt;Listbox();
         my $adj2 = $f-&gt;Adjuster(-restore =&gt; 0);
         my $lst3 = $f-&gt;Listbox();

         my $side = 'left';
         $lst1-&gt;pack(-side =&gt; $side, -fill =&gt; 'both', -expand =&gt; 1);
         $adj1-&gt;packAfter($lst1, -side =&gt; $side);
         $lst2-&gt;pack(-side =&gt; $side, -fill =&gt; 'both', -expand =&gt; 1);
         $adj2-&gt;packAfter($lst2, -side =&gt; $side);
         $lst3-&gt;pack(-side =&gt; $side, -fill =&gt; 'both', -expand =&gt; 1);

         MainLoop;

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       It is currently not possible to configure the appearance of the Adjuster.  It would be nice to be able to
       set the width and relief of the Adjuster "line" and the presence/absence of the "blob" on the Adjuster.

       Tk::Adjuster  works  theoretically  with  the grid geometry manager but there are currently some problems
       which seem to be due to bugs in grid:

         a) There's never an Unmap event for the adjuster, so the "restore"
            functionality has no effect.
         b) After adjusting, widgets protrude into the border of the master.
         c) grid('Propagate', 0) on MainWindow has no effect - window shrinks/grows
            when widgets are adjusted.
         d) Widgets shuffle to correct position on startup
