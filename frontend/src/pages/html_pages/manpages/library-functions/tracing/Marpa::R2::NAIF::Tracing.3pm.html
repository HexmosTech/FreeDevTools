       Marpa::R2::NAIF::Tracing - Tracing a NAIF grammar

</pre><h4><b>Description</b></h4><pre>
       This document is an overview of the techniques for tracing and debugging Marpa parses and grammars.
       using its named argument interface (NAIF).  If you are a beginner, or are not sure which interface you
       are interested in, or do not know what the NAIF interfaces is, you probably are looking for the document
       on tracing and debugging for the SLIF interface.

</pre><h4><b>Basic</b> <b>techniques</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Check</b> <b>the</b> <b>input</b> <b>location</b> <b>where</b> <b>parsing</b> <b>failed</b>
       If parsing failed in the recognizer, look at the input location where it happened.  Compare the input
       against the grammar.  This step is fairly obvious, but I include it because even experts (actually,
       especially experts) will sometimes overlook the obvious in a rush to use more advanced techniques.

   <b>Turn</b> <b>on</b> <b>warnings</b>
       Make sure that Marpa's "warnings" named arguments for both the grammar and the recognizer are turned on.
       Warnings are on by default.

   <b>Trace</b> <b>terminals</b>
       Turn on the "trace_terminals" recognizer named argument.  This tells you which tokens the recognizer is
       looking for and which ones it thinks it found.  If the problem is in lexing, "trace_terminals" tells you
       the whole story.

       Even if the problem is not in the lexing, tracing terminals can tell you a lot.  Marpa uses prediction-
       driven lexing.  At any given parse location, Marpa is only looking for those tokens that it thinks could
       result in a successful parse.  Examining the list of tokens that the recognizer is looking for can tell
       you a lot about what the recognizer thinks it has seen so far.

   <b>Trace</b> <b>progress</b>
       Tracing the recognizer's progress with "show_progress" is most powerful tool available in the basic
       toolkit.  "show_progress" should provide all the information necessary to debug an application's grammar.
       A separate document explains how to interpret the progress reports.  That document includes an example of
       the use of "show_progress" to debug an error in a grammar.

   <b>Double</b> <b>check</b> <b>rules</b> <b>and</b> <b>symbols</b>
       It sometimes helps to look carefully at the output of "show_rules" and "show_symbols".  Check if anything
       there is not what you expected.

   <b>Other</b> <b>traces</b>
       "trace_actions" will show you how action names resolve to actions.  Setting the "trace_values" evaluator
       named argument to a trace level of 1 traces the values of the parse tree nodes as they are pushed on, and
       popped off, the evaluation stack.

   <b>Basic</b> <b>checklist</b>
       A full investigation of a parse includes the following:

       •   Make sure the "warnings" option is turned on.  It is on by default.

       •   Turn on the "trace_terminals" recognizer named argument.

       •   Run "show_symbols" on the precomputed grammar.

       •   Run "show_rules" on the precomputed grammar.

       •   Run "show_progress" on the recognizer.

       •   Turn on the "trace_actions" evaluator named argument.

       •   Set the "trace_values" evaluator named argument to level 1.

       When  considering  how  much tracing to turn on, remember that if the input text to the grammar is large,
       the outputs from "trace_terminals", "show_progress", and "trace_values" will be very lengthy.   You  want
       to work with short inputs if at all possible.
