       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

       posix_trace_attr_getinherited, posix_trace_attr_getlogfullpolicy, posix_trace_attr_getstreamfullpolicy,
       posix_trace_attr_setinherited, posix_trace_attr_setlogfullpolicy, posix_trace_attr_setstreamfullpolicy —

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;trace.h&gt;

       int posix_trace_attr_getinherited(const trace_attr_t *restrict <u>attr</u>,
           int *restrict <u>inheritancepolicy</u>);
       int posix_trace_attr_getlogfullpolicy(const trace_attr_t *restrict <u>attr</u>,
           int *restrict <u>logpolicy</u>);
       int posix_trace_attr_getstreamfullpolicy(const trace_attr_t *restrict
           <u>attr</u>, int *restrict <u>streampolicy</u>);
       int posix_trace_attr_setinherited(trace_attr_t *<u>attr</u>,
           int <u>inheritancepolicy</u>);
       int posix_trace_attr_setlogfullpolicy(trace_attr_t *<u>attr</u>,
           int <u>logpolicy</u>);
       int posix_trace_attr_setstreamfullpolicy(trace_attr_t *<u>attr</u>,
           int <u>streampolicy</u>);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>posix_trace_attr_getinherited</u>()  and  <u>posix_trace_attr_setinherited</u>() functions, respectively, shall
       get and set the inheritance policy stored in the <u>inheritance</u> attribute for traced  processes  across  the
       <u>fork</u>()  and <u>spawn</u>() operations. The <u>inheritance</u> attribute of the attributes object pointed to by the <u>attr</u>
       argument shall be set to one of the following values defined  by  manifest  constants  in  the  <u>&lt;trace.h&gt;</u>
       header:

       POSIX_TRACE_CLOSE_FOR_CHILD
             After a <u>fork</u>() or <u>spawn</u>() operation, the child shall not be traced, and tracing of the parent shall
             continue.

       POSIX_TRACE_INHERITED
             After a <u>fork</u>() or <u>spawn</u>() operation, if the parent is being traced, its child shall be concurrently
             traced using the same trace stream.

       The default value for the <u>inheritance</u> attribute is POSIX_TRACE_CLOSE_FOR_CHILD.

       The  <u>posix_trace_attr_getlogfullpolicy</u>() and <u>posix_trace_attr_setlogfullpolicy</u>() functions, respectively,
       shall get and set the trace log full policy stored in the <u>log-full-policy</u>  attribute  of  the  attributes
       object pointed to by the <u>attr</u> argument.

       The  <u>log-full-policy</u>  attribute shall be set to one of the following values defined by manifest constants
       in the <u>&lt;trace.h&gt;</u> header:

       POSIX_TRACE_LOOP
             The trace log shall loop until the associated trace stream is stopped.  This policy means that when
             the trace log gets full, the file system shall reuse the resources allocated to  the  oldest  trace
             events  that  were  recorded.  In this way, the trace log will always contain the most recent trace
             events flushed.

       POSIX_TRACE_UNTIL_FULL
             The trace stream shall be flushed to the trace log until the trace log is full. This condition  can
             be  deduced from the <u>posix_log_full_status</u> member status (see the <b>posix_trace_status_info</b> structure
             defined in <u>&lt;trace.h&gt;</u>).  The last recorded trace event shall be the POSIX_TRACE_STOP trace event.

       POSIX_TRACE_APPEND
             The associated trace stream shall be flushed to the trace log without log size limitation.  If  the
             application   specifies  POSIX_TRACE_APPEND,  the  implementation  shall  ignore  the  <u>log-max-size</u>
             attribute.

       The default value for the <u>log-full-policy</u> attribute is POSIX_TRACE_LOOP.

       The   <u>posix_trace_attr_getstreamfullpolicy</u>()   and   <u>posix_trace_attr_setstreamfullpolicy</u>()    functions,
       respectively,  shall  get and set the trace stream full policy stored in the <u>stream-full-policy</u> attribute
       of the attributes object pointed to by the <u>attr</u> argument.

       The <u>stream-full-policy</u> attribute shall be set  to  one  of  the  following  values  defined  by  manifest
       constants in the <u>&lt;trace.h&gt;</u> header:

       POSIX_TRACE_LOOP
             The  trace  stream  shall  loop  until  explicitly stopped by the <u>posix_trace_stop</u>() function. This
             policy means that when the trace stream is  full,  the  trace  system  shall  reuse  the  resources
             allocated  to  the  oldest trace events recorded. In this way, the trace stream will always contain
             the most recent trace events recorded.

       POSIX_TRACE_UNTIL_FULL
             The trace stream will run until the trace stream resources are exhausted.  Then  the  trace  stream
             will stop. This condition can be deduced from <u>posix_stream_status</u> and <u>posix_stream_full_status</u> (see
             the  <b>posix_trace_status_info</b>  structure  defined  in <u>&lt;trace.h&gt;</u>).  When this trace stream is read, a
             POSIX_TRACE_STOP trace event shall be reported after reporting the last recorded trace event.   The
             trace  system  shall  reuse  the  resources  allocated to any trace events already reported—see the
             <u>posix_trace_getnext_event</u>(), <u>posix_trace_trygetnext_event</u>(),  and  <u>posix_trace_timedgetnext_event</u>()
             functions—or  already  flushed  for  an  active  trace  stream  with log if the Trace Log option is
             supported; see the <u>posix_trace_flush</u>() function. The trace system shall restart  the  trace  stream
             when  it  is  empty  and  may  restart it sooner. A POSIX_TRACE_START trace event shall be reported
             before reporting the next recorded trace event.

       POSIX_TRACE_FLUSH
             If the Trace Log option is supported, this policy is identical to the POSIX_TRACE_UNTIL_FULL  trace
             stream   full   policy   except   that   the   trace  stream  shall  be  flushed  regularly  as  if
             <u>posix_trace_flush</u>() had been explicitly called. Defining this policy for  an  active  trace  stream
             without log shall be invalid.

       The  default  value  for  the  <u>stream-full-policy</u> attribute shall be POSIX_TRACE_LOOP for an active trace
       stream without log.

       If the Trace Log option is supported, the default value for the  <u>stream-full-policy</u>  attribute  shall  be
       POSIX_TRACE_FLUSH for an active trace stream with log.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       Upon  successful  completion,  these functions shall return a value of zero. Otherwise, they shall return
       the corresponding error number.

       If successful, the <u>posix_trace_attr_getinherited</u>() function shall store the <u>inheritance</u>  attribute  value
       in the object pointed to by <u>inheritancepolicy</u>.  Otherwise, the content of this object is undefined.

       If successful, the <u>posix_trace_attr_getlogfullpolicy</u>() function shall store the <u>log-full-policy</u> attribute
       value in the object pointed to by <u>logpolicy</u>.  Otherwise, the content of this object is undefined.

       If  successful,  the  <u>posix_trace_attr_getstreamfullpolicy</u>()  function shall store the <u>stream-full-policy</u>
       attribute value in the object pointed to by <u>streampolicy</u>.  Otherwise,  the  content  of  this  object  is
       undefined.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       These functions may fail if:

       <b>EINVAL</b> The value specified by at least one of the arguments is invalid.
