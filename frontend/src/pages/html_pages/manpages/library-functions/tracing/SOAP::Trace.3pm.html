</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       SOAP::Trace - used only to manage and manipulate the runtime tracing of execution within the toolkit

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This class has no methods or objects. It is used only to manage and manipulate the runtime tracing of
       execution within the toolkit. In absence of methods, this section reviews the events that may be
       configured and the ways of configuring them.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       Tracing is enabled by the SOAP::Lite import method. This is usually done at compile-time, though it may
       be done explicitly by calling import directly. The commands for setting up tracing start with the keyword
       +trace. Alternately, +debug may be used; the two are interchangeable. After the initial keyword, one or
       more of the signals detailed here may be specified, optionally with a callback to handle them. When
       specifying multiple signals to be handled by a single callback, it is sufficient to list all of them
       first, followed finally by the callback, as in:

          use SOAP::Lite +trace =&gt;
            method =&gt; fault =&gt; \&amp;message_level,
            trace =&gt; objects =&gt; \&amp;lower_level;

       In the fragment, the reference to message_level is installed as the callback for both method and fault
       signals, while lower_level is installed for trace and object events. If callbacks aren't explicitly
       provided, the default tracing action is to log a message to Perl's STDOUT file descriptor. Callbacks
       should expect a one or more arguments passed in, though the nature of the arguments varies based on the
       signal.

       Any signal can be disabled by prefacing the name with a hyphen, such as -result. This is useful with the
       pseudosignal "all," which is shorthand for the full list of signals. The following fragment disables only
       the two signals, while still enabling the rest:

           SOAP::Lite-&gt;import(+trace =&gt; all =&gt; -result =&gt; -parameters);

       If the keyword +trace (or +debug) is used without any signals specified, it enables all signals (as if
       all were implied).

       The signals and their meaning follow. Each also bears a note as to whether the signal is relevant to a
       server application, client application, or both.

</pre><h4><b>TRACE</b> <b>SIGNALS</b></h4><pre>
       transport <u>Client</u> <u>only</u>
           Triggered  in  the  transport layer just before a request is sent and immediately after a response is
           received. Each time the signal is sent, the sole argument to the callback is the relevant object.  On
           requests, this is a HTTP::Request object; for responses, it's a HTTP::Response object.

       dispatch <u>Server</u> <u>only</u>
           Triggered  with  the full name of the method being dispatched, just before execution is passed to it.
           It is currently disabled in SOAP::Lite 0.55.

       result <u>Server</u> <u>only</u>
           Triggered after the method has been dispatched and is passed the results returned from the method  as
           a list. The result values have not yet been serialized when this signal is sent.

       parameters <u>Server</u> <u>only</u>
           Triggered  before  a  method call is actually dispatched, with the data that is intended for the call
           itself. The parameters for the method call are passed in as a list, after  having  been  deserialized
           into Perl data.

       headers <u>Server</u> <u>only</u>
           This  signal should be for triggering on the headers of an incoming message, but it isn't implemented
           as of SOAP::Lite 0.55.

       objects <u>Client</u> <u>or</u> <u>server</u>
           Highlights when an object is instantiated or destroyed. It  is  triggered  in  the  new  and  DESTROY
           methods of the various SOAP::Lite classes.

       method <u>Client</u> <u>or</u> <u>server</u>
           Triggered with the list of arguments whenever the envelope method of SOAP::Serializer is invoked with
           an initial argument of method. The initial string itself isn't passed to the callback.

       fault <u>Client</u> <u>or</u> <u>server</u>
           As    with   the   method   signal   earlier,   except   that   this   signal   is   triggered   when
           SOAP::Serializer::envelope is called with an initial argument of fault.

       freeform <u>Client</u> <u>or</u> <u>server</u>
           Like the two previous, this signal is triggered when the method SOAP::Serializer::envelope is  called
           with  an  initial  parameter  of freeform. This syntax is used when the method is creating SOAP::Data
           objects from free-form input data.

       trace <u>Client</u> <u>or</u> <u>server</u>
           Triggered at the entry-point of many of the more-significant functions. Not all the functions  within
           the  SOAP::Lite classes trigger this signal. Those that do are primarily the highly visible functions
           described in the interface descriptions for the various classes.

       debug <u>Client</u> <u>or</u> <u>server</u>
           Used in the various transport modules to track the contents of requests and  responses  (as  ordinary
           strings, not as objects) at different points along the way.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>SELECTING</b> <b>SIGNALS</b> <b>TO</b> <b>TRACE</b>
       The following code snippet will enable tracing for all signals:

         use SOAP::Lite +trace =&gt; 'all';

       You  can  disable  tracing for a set of signals by prefixing the signal name with a hyphen. Therefore, if
       you wish to enable tracing for every signal EXCEPT transport signals, then you would use the code below:

         use SOAP::Lite +trace =&gt; [ qw(all -transport) ];

   <b>LOGGING</b> <b>SIGNALS</b> <b>TO</b> <b>A</b> <b>FILE</b>
       You can optionally provide a subroutine or callback to each signal trace you declare. Each time a  signal
       is  received,  it  is passed to the corresponding subroutine. For example, the following code effectively
       logs all fault signals to a file called fault.log:

         use SOAP::Lite +trace =&gt; [ fault =&gt; \&amp;log_faults ];

         sub log_faults {
           open LOGFILE,"&gt;fault.log";
           print LOGFILE, $_[0] . "\n";
           close LOGFILE;
         }

       You can also use a single callback for multiple signals using the code below:

         use SOAP::Lite +trace =&gt; [ method, fault =&gt; \&amp;log ];

   <b>LOGGING</b> <b>MESSAGE</b> <b>CONTENTS</b>
       The transport signal is unique  in  the  that  the  signal  is  not  a  text  string,  but  the  actually
       HTTP::Request  being  sent  (just  prior  to be sent), or HTTP::Response object (immediately after it was
       received). The following code sample shows how to make use of this:

         use SOAP::Lite +trace =&gt; [ transport =&gt; \&amp;log_message ];

         sub log_message {
           my ($in) = @_;
           if (class($in) eq "HTTP::Request") {
             # do something...
             print $in-&gt;contents; # ...for example
           } elsif (class($in) eq "HTTP::Response") {
             # do something
           }
         }

   <b>ON_DEBUG</b>
       The "on_debug" method is available, as in:

         use SOAP::Lite;
         my $client = SOAP::Lite
           -&gt;uri($NS)
           -&gt;proxy($HOST)
           -&gt;on_debug( sub { print @_; } );
