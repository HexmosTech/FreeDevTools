</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       posix_trace_eventid_equal,  posix_trace_eventid_get_name,  posix_trace_trid_eventid_open — manipulate the
       trace event type identifier (<b>TRACING</b>)

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;trace.h&gt;

       int posix_trace_eventid_equal(trace_id_t <u>trid</u>, trace_event_id_t <u>event1</u>,
           trace_event_id_t <u>event2</u>);
       int posix_trace_eventid_get_name(trace_id_t <u>trid</u>,
           trace_event_id_t <u>event</u>, char *<u>event_name</u>);
       int posix_trace_trid_eventid_open(trace_id_t <u>trid</u>,
           const char *restrict <u>event_name</u>,
           trace_event_id_t *restrict <u>event</u>);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>posix_trace_eventid_equal</u>() function shall compare the trace event type identifiers <u>event1</u> and <u>event2</u>
       from the same trace stream or the same trace log identified by the <u>trid</u> argument. If the trace event type
       identifiers <u>event1</u> and <u>event2</u> are from different trace streams, the return value shall be unspecified.

       The <u>posix_trace_eventid_get_name</u>() function shall return, in the argument pointed to by  <u>event_name</u>,  the
       trace  event  name  associated with the trace event type identifier identified by the argument <u>event</u>, for
       the trace stream or for the trace log identified by the <u>trid</u> argument. The name of the trace event  shall
       have    a    maximum    of    {TRACE_EVENT_NAME_MAX}    characters   (which   has   the   minimum   value
       {_POSIX_TRACE_EVENT_NAME_MAX}).  Successive calls to  this  function  with  the  same  trace  event  type
       identifier and the same trace stream identifier shall return the same event name.

       The  <u>posix_trace_trid_eventid_open</u>()  function shall associate a user trace event name with a trace event
       type identifier for a given trace stream. The trace stream is identified by the  <u>trid</u>  argument,  and  it
       shall  be  an  active  trace  stream.  The  trace  event  name  is  the string pointed to by the argument
       <u>event_name</u>.  It shall have a maximum of {TRACE_EVENT_NAME_MAX} characters (which has  the  minimum  value
       {_POSIX_TRACE_EVENT_NAME_MAX}).   The number of user trace event type identifiers that can be defined for
       any given process is limited by the maximum value {TRACE_USER_EVENT_MAX}, which  has  the  minimum  value
       {_POSIX_TRACE_USER_EVENT_MAX}.

       If  the  Trace  Inherit  option  is  not  supported,  the  <u>posix_trace_trid_eventid_open</u>() function shall
       associate the user trace event name pointed to by  the  <u>event_name</u>  argument  with  a  trace  event  type
       identifier  that  is  unique  for  the  process  being  traced in the trace stream identified by the <u>trid</u>
       argument, and is returned in the variable pointed to by the <u>event</u> argument. If the user trace event  name
       has  already been mapped for the traced process, then the previously assigned trace event type identifier
       shall be returned. If the per-process user trace event name limit represented  by  {TRACE_USER_EVENT_MAX}
       has  been reached, the pre-defined POSIX_TRACE_UNNAMED_USEREVENT (see <u>Table</u> <u>2-7</u>, <u>Trace</u> <u>Option:</u> <u>User</u> <u>Trace</u>
       <u>Event</u>) user trace event shall be returned.

       If the Trace Inherit option is supported, the <u>posix_trace_trid_eventid_open</u>()  function  shall  associate
       the  user  trace event name pointed to by the <u>event_name</u> argument with a trace event type identifier that
       is unique for all the processes being traced in the trace stream identified by the <u>trid</u> argument, and  is
       returned  in the variable pointed to by the <u>event</u> argument. If the user trace event name has already been
       mapped for the traced processes, then the previously  assigned  trace  event  type  identifier  shall  be
       returned.  If  the per-process user trace event name limit represented by {TRACE_USER_EVENT_MAX} has been
       reached, the pre-defined POSIX_TRACE_UNNAMED_USEREVENT (see <u>Table</u> <u>2-7</u>, <u>Trace</u> <u>Option:</u>  <u>User</u>  <u>Trace</u>  <u>Event</u>)
       user trace event shall be returned.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       Upon   successful  completion,  the  <u>posix_trace_eventid_get_name</u>()  and  <u>posix_trace_trid_eventid_open</u>()
       functions shall return a value of zero. Otherwise, they shall return the corresponding error number.

       The <u>posix_trace_eventid_equal</u>() function shall return a non-zero value if <u>event1</u> and  <u>event2</u>  are  equal;
       otherwise,  a  value of zero shall be returned. No errors are defined. If either <u>event1</u> or <u>event2</u> are not
       valid trace event type identifiers for the trace stream specified by <u>trid</u> or if the <u>trid</u> is invalid,  the
       behavior shall be unspecified.

       The <u>posix_trace_eventid_get_name</u>() function stores the trace event name value in the object pointed to by
       <u>event_name</u>, if successful.

       The  <u>posix_trace_trid_eventid_open</u>()  function stores the trace event type identifier value in the object
       pointed to by <u>event</u>, if successful.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>posix_trace_eventid_get_name</u>() and <u>posix_trace_trid_eventid_open</u>() functions shall fail if:

       <b>EINVAL</b> The <u>trid</u> argument was not a valid trace stream identifier.

       The <u>posix_trace_trid_eventid_open</u>() function shall fail if:

       <b>ENAMETOOLONG</b>
              The size of the name pointed to by the <u>event_name</u> argument was  longer  than  the  implementation-
              defined value {TRACE_EVENT_NAME_MAX}.

       The <u>posix_trace_eventid_get_name</u>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EINVAL</b> The trace event type identifier <u>event</u> was not associated with any name.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>FUTURE</b> <b>DIRECTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The   <u>posix_trace_eventid_equal</u>(),  <u>posix_trace_eventid_get_name</u>(),  and  <u>posix_trace_trid_eventid_open</u>()
       functions may be removed in a future version.
