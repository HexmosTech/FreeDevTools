</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       posix_trace_event,   posix_trace_eventid_open  —  trace  functions  for  instrumenting  application  code
       (<b>TRACING</b>)

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
       #include &lt;trace.h&gt;

       void posix_trace_event(trace_event_id_t <u>event_id</u>,
           const void *restrict <u>data_ptr</u>, size_t <u>data_len</u>);
       int posix_trace_eventid_open(const char *restrict <u>event_name</u>,
           trace_event_id_t *restrict <u>event_id</u>);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>posix_trace_event</u>() function shall record the <u>event_id</u> and the user data pointed to  by  <u>data_ptr</u>  in
       the  trace  stream  into  which the calling process is being traced and in which <u>event_id</u> is not filtered
       out. If the total size of the user trace event data represented by  <u>data_len</u>  is  not  greater  than  the
       declared  maximum size for user trace event data, then the <u>truncation-status</u> attribute of the trace event
       recorded is POSIX_TRACE_NOT_TRUNCATED.  Otherwise, the  user  trace  event  data  is  truncated  to  this
       declared   maximum   size   and   the   <u>truncation-status</u>  attribute  of  the  trace  event  recorded  is
       POSIX_TRACE_TRUNCATED_RECORD.

       If there is no trace stream created for the process or if the created trace stream is not running, or  if
       the  trace  event  specified  by  <u>event_id</u>  is  filtered out in the trace stream, the <u>posix_trace_event</u>()
       function shall have no effect.

       The <u>posix_trace_eventid_open</u>() function shall associate a user trace event name with a trace  event  type
       identifier  for  the  calling  process.  The  trace  event  name is the string pointed to by the argument
       <u>event_name</u>.  It shall have a maximum of {TRACE_EVENT_NAME_MAX} characters (which has  the  minimum  value
       {_POSIX_TRACE_EVENT_NAME_MAX}).   The number of user trace event type identifiers that can be defined for
       any given process is limited by the maximum value {TRACE_USER_EVENT_MAX}, which  has  the  minimum  value
       {POSIX_TRACE_USER_EVENT_MAX}.

       If the Trace Inherit option is not supported, the <u>posix_trace_eventid_open</u>() function shall associate the
       user  trace  event  name pointed to by the <u>event_name</u> argument with a trace event type identifier that is
       unique for the traced process, and is returned in the variable pointed to by the  <u>event_id</u>  argument.  If
       the  user  trace  event name has already been mapped for the traced process, then the previously assigned
       trace event type identifier shall be returned. If the per-process user trace event name limit represented
       by {TRACE_USER_EVENT_MAX} has been reached, the pre-defined POSIX_TRACE_UNNAMED_USEREVENT (see <u>Table</u> <u>2-7</u>,
       <u>Trace</u> <u>Option:</u> <u>User</u> <u>Trace</u> <u>Event</u>) user trace event shall be returned.

       If the Trace Inherit option is supported, the <u>posix_trace_eventid_open</u>()  function  shall  associate  the
       user  trace  event  name pointed to by the <u>event_name</u> argument with a trace event type identifier that is
       unique for all the processes being traced in this same trace stream, and  is  returned  in  the  variable
       pointed  to by the <u>event_id</u> argument. If the user trace event name has already been mapped for the traced
       processes, then the previously assigned trace event type identifier shall be returned. If the per-process
       user trace event name limit represented by  {TRACE_USER_EVENT_MAX}  has  been  reached,  the  pre-defined
       POSIX_TRACE_UNNAMED_USEREVENT  (<u>Table</u>  <u>2-7</u>,  <u>Trace</u>  <u>Option:</u>  <u>User</u>  <u>Trace</u> <u>Event</u>) user trace event shall be
       returned.

       <b>Note:</b>     The above procedure, together with the fact that multiple processes can only be traced into the
                 same trace stream by inheritance, ensure that all the processes that are traced  into  a  trace
                 stream have the same mapping of trace event names to trace event type identifiers.

       If there is no trace stream created, the <u>posix_trace_eventid_open</u>() function shall store this information
       for future trace streams created for this process.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       No return value is defined for the <u>posix_trace_event</u>() function.

       Upon  successful  completion,  the  <u>posix_trace_eventid_open</u>()  function  shall  return  a value of zero.
       Otherwise, it shall return the corresponding error number. The <u>posix_trace_eventid_open</u>() function stores
       the trace event type identifier value in the object pointed to by <u>event_id</u>, if successful.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>posix_trace_eventid_open</u>() function shall fail if:

       <b>ENAMETOOLONG</b>
              The size of the name pointed to by the <u>event_name</u> argument was  longer  than  the  implementation-
              defined value {TRACE_EVENT_NAME_MAX}.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>FUTURE</b> <b>DIRECTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>posix_trace_event</u>() and <u>posix_trace_eventid_open</u>() functions may be removed in a future version.
