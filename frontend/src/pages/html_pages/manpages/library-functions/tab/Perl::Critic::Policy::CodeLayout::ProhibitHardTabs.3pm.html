</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Perl::Critic::Policy::CodeLayout::ProhibitHardTabs - Use spaces instead of tabs.

</pre><h4><b>AFFILIATION</b></h4><pre>
       This Policy is part of the core Perl::Critic distribution.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Putting hard tabs in your source code (or POD) is one of the worst things you can do to your co-workers
       and colleagues, especially if those tabs are anywhere other than a leading position.  Because various
       applications and devices represent tabs differently, they can cause you code to look vastly different to
       other people.  Any decent editor can be configured to expand tabs into spaces.  Perl::Tidy also does this
       for you.

       This Policy catches all tabs in your source code, including POD, quotes, and HEREDOCs.  The contents of
       the "__DATA__" section are not examined.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       Hard tabs in a string are always forbidden (use "\t" instead).  But hard tabs in a leading position are
       allowed when they are used to indent code statements, qw() word lists, and regular expressions with the
       "/x" modifier.  However, if you want to forbid all tabs everywhere, then add this to your <u>.perlcriticrc</u>
       file:

           [CodeLayout::ProhibitHardTabs]
           allow_leading_tabs = 0

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       Beware that Perl::Critic may report the location of the string that contains the tab, not the actual
       location of the tab, so you may need to do some hunting.  I'll try and fix this in the future.
