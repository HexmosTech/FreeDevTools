       Mail::Message::Head::ResentGroup - header fields tracking message delivery

</pre><h4><b>INHERITANCE</b></h4><pre>
        Mail::Message::Head::ResentGroup
          is a Mail::Message::Head::FieldGroup
          is a Mail::Reporter

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        use Mail::Message::Head::ResentGroup;
        my $rg = Mail::Message::Head::ResentGroup-&gt;new(head =&gt; $head,
                     From =&gt; '<a href="mailto:me@home.nl">me@home.nl</a>', To =&gt; '<a href="mailto:You@tux.aq">You@tux.aq</a>');

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       A <u>resent</u> <u>group</u> is a set of header fields which describe one intermediate step in the message transport.
       Resent groups <b>have</b> <b>NOTHING</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with user activety; there is no relation to the "user's" sense of
       creating reply, forward, or bounce messages at all!

       Extends "DESCRIPTION" in Mail::Message::Head::FieldGroup.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       Extends "METHODS" in Mail::Message::Head::FieldGroup.

   <b>Constructors</b>
       Extends "Constructors" in Mail::Message::Head::FieldGroup.

           Inherited, see "Constructors" in Mail::Message::Head::FieldGroup

       $obj-&gt;<b>from</b>( [&lt;$head|$message&gt;, %options] )
           WARNING:  this  method  has two very different purposes.  For backward compatibility reasons, without
           arguments <b>resentFrom()</b> is called to return the "From" field of this resent group.

           With any arguments, a list of "Mail::Message::Head::ResentGroup" objects is returned, taken from  the
           specified $message or message $head.

       Mail::Message::Head::ResentGroup-&gt;<b>new</b>( [$fields], %options )
           Create  an  object  which  maintains one set of resent headers.  The $fields are Mail::Message::Field
           objects from the same header.

           %options which start with capitals will be used to construct additional fields.  These  option  names
           are prepended with "Resent-*", keeping the capitization of what is specified.

           Bcc =&gt; STRING|OBJECT|OBJECTS
           Cc =&gt; STRING|OBJECT|OBJECTS
           Date =&gt; STRING
             When  this  resent-group is dispatched by the resender of the message. Like the "Date" field, it is
             not the date and time that the message was actually transported.

           Delivered-To =&gt; STRING|FIELD
           From =&gt; STRING|OBJECT|OBJECTS
           Message-ID =&gt; STRING|FIELD
             The "Resent-Message-ID" which identifies this resent group.  The FIELD must contain a message id.

           Received =&gt; STRING
             The "Received" field is the starting line for a resent group of header lines. If it is not defined,
             one is created using <b>createReceived()</b>.

           Return-Path =&gt; STRING|FIELD
           Sender =&gt; STRING|OBJECT
             Only permitted when more than one from address is specified.  In this case, it selects one of these
             addresses as the main originator of the message.

           To =&gt; STRING|OBJECT|OBJECTS
           head =&gt; OBJECT
             The header where the data is stored in. By default a Mail::Message::Head::Partial  is  created  for
             you.

           log =&gt; LEVEL
           message_head =&gt; HEAD
             The  real  header of the message where this resent group is part of.  The "head" used in this class
             is only a container for a subset of fields.

           software =&gt; STRING
           trace =&gt; LEVEL
           type =&gt; STRING
           version =&gt; STRING

   <b>The</b> <b>header</b>
       Extends "The header" in Mail::Message::Head::FieldGroup.

       $obj-&gt;<b>add</b>( &lt;$field, $value&gt; | $object )
           All fields appear only once, so add() behaves as <b>set()</b>.

       $obj-&gt;<b>addFields</b>( [$fieldnames] )
           Not applicable to resent-groups: the same name can appear in  more  than  one  group.   Therefore,  a
           FIELDNAME is sufficiently distinctive.

       $obj-&gt;<b>attach</b>($head)
           Inherited, see "The header" in Mail::Message::Head::FieldGroup

       $obj-&gt;<b>delete</b>()
           Inherited, see "The header" in Mail::Message::Head::FieldGroup

       $obj-&gt;<b>fieldNames</b>()
           Inherited, see "The header" in Mail::Message::Head::FieldGroup

       $obj-&gt;<b>fields</b>()
           Inherited, see "The header" in Mail::Message::Head::FieldGroup

       $obj-&gt;<b>head</b>()
           Inherited, see "The header" in Mail::Message::Head::FieldGroup

       $obj-&gt;<b>messageHead</b>( [$head] )
           Returns  (optionally  after setting) the real header where this resent group belongs to.  This may be
           undef at creation, and then later filled in when  <b>Mail::Message::Head::Complete::addResentGroup()</b>  is
           called.

       $obj-&gt;<b>orderedFields</b>()
           Returns  the fields in the order as should appear in header according to rfc2822.  For the "Resent-*"
           fields of the group, the order is not that important,  but  the  "Return-Path",  "Delivered-To",  and
           "Received" must come first.  Only fields mentioned in the RFC are returned.

       $obj-&gt;<b>set</b>( &lt;$field, $value&gt; | $object )
           Set a $field to a (new) $value.  The $field names which do not start with 'Resent-*' but need it will
           have  that  added.   It  is also an option to specify a fully prepared message field $object.  In any
           case, a field $object is returned.

           example:

            my $this = Mail::Message::Head::ResentGroup-&gt;new;
            $this-&gt;set(To =&gt; '<a href="mailto:fish@tux.aq">fish@tux.aq</a>');
            $msg-&gt;addResentGroup($this);
            $msg-&gt;send;

            $msg-&gt;bounce(To =&gt; '<a href="mailto:fish@tux.aq">fish@tux.aq</a>')-&gt;send;   # the same

            my $this = Mail::Message::Head::ResentGroup
                -&gt;new(To =&gt; '<a href="mailto:fish@tux.aq">fish@tux.aq</a>');

   <b>Access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>header</b>
       Extends "Access to the header" in Mail::Message::Head::FieldGroup.

       $obj-&gt;<b>bcc</b>()
           In scalar context, the "Resent-Bcc" field is returned.  In list context, the addresses  as  specified
           within  the  bcc field are returned as Mail::Address objects.  Bcc fields are not transmitted (hidden
           for external parties).

       $obj-&gt;<b>cc</b>()
           In scalar context, the "Resent-Cc" field is returned.  In list context, the  addresses  as  specified
           within the cc field are returned as Mail::Address objects.

       $obj-&gt;<b>date</b>()
           Returns the "Resent-Date" field, or "undef" if it was not defined.

       $obj-&gt;<b>dateTimestamp</b>()
           The timestamp as stored within the "Resent-Date" field converted to local system time.

       $obj-&gt;<b>deliveredTo</b>()
           The field which describes the "Delivered-To" of this resent group.

       $obj-&gt;<b>destinations</b>()
           Returns a list of all addresses specified in the "Resent-To", "-Cc", and "-Bcc" fields of this resent
           group.

       $obj-&gt;<b>isResentGroupFieldName</b>($name)
       Mail::Message::Head::ResentGroup-&gt;<b>isResentGroupFieldName</b>($name)
       $obj-&gt;<b>messageId</b>()
           Returns the message-ID used for this group of resent lines.

       $obj-&gt;<b>received</b>()
           The field which describes the "Received" data of this resent group.

       $obj-&gt;<b>receivedTimestamp</b>()
           The timestamp as stored within the "Received" field converted to local system time.

       $obj-&gt;<b>resentFrom</b>()
           In  scalar context, the "Resent-From" field is returned.  In list context, the addresses as specified
           within the from field are returned as Mail::Address objects.

           For reasons of backward compatibility and consistency, the <b>from()</b> method will return the same as this
           method.

       $obj-&gt;<b>returnPath</b>()
           The field which describes the "Return-Path" of this resent group.

       $obj-&gt;<b>sender</b>()
           In scalar context, the "Resent-Sender"  field  is  returned.   In  list  context,  the  addresses  as
           specified within the from field are returned as Mail::Address objects.

       $obj-&gt;<b>software</b>()
           Inherited, see "Access to the header" in Mail::Message::Head::FieldGroup

       $obj-&gt;<b>to</b>()
           In  scalar  context,  the "Resent-To" field is returned.  In list context, the addresses as specified
           within the to field are returned as Mail::Address objects.

       $obj-&gt;<b>createReceived</b>( [$domain] )
           Create a received field for this resent group.  This is automatically called if  none  was  specified
           during creation of this resent group object.

           The content of this field is described in RFC2821 section 4.4.  It could use some improvement.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       Error: Message header required for creation of ResentGroup.
           It  is  required  to know to which header the resent-group is created.  Use the "head" option.  Maybe
           you should use <b>Mail::Message::Head::Complete::addResentGroup()</b> with DATA,  which  will  organize  the
           correct initiations for you.

       Error: Package $package does not implement $method.
           Fatal  error:  the specific package (or one of its superclasses) does not implement this method where
           it should. This message means that some other related classes do implement this  method  however  the
           class  at  hand does not.  Probably you should investigate this and probably inform the author of the
           package.
