</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Mail::Message::Head::Complete - the header of one message

</pre><h4><b>INHERITANCE</b></h4><pre>
        Mail::Message::Head::Complete
          is a Mail::Message::Head
          is a Mail::Reporter

        Mail::Message::Head::Complete is extended by
          Mail::Message::Head::Partial
          Mail::Message::Replace::MailHeader

        Mail::Message::Head::Complete is realized by
          Mail::Message::Head::Delayed
          Mail::Message::Head::Subset

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        my $head = Mail::Message::Head::Complete-&gt;new;
        See Mail::Message::Head

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       E-mail's message can be in various states: unread, partially read, and fully read.  The class stores a
       message of which all header lines are known for sure.

       Extends "DESCRIPTION" in Mail::Message::Head.

</pre><h4><b>OVERLOADED</b></h4><pre>
       Extends "OVERLOADED" in Mail::Message::Head.

       overload: <b>""</b>
           Inherited, see "OVERLOADED" in Mail::Message::Head

       overload: <b>bool</b>
           Inherited, see "OVERLOADED" in Mail::Message::Head

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       Extends "METHODS" in Mail::Message::Head.

   <b>Constructors</b>
       Extends "Constructors" in Mail::Message::Head.

       Mail::Message::Head::Complete-&gt;<b>build</b>( [PAIR|$field], ... )
           Undefined values are interpreted as empty field values, and therefore skipped.

       $obj-&gt;<b>clone</b>( [@names|ARRAY|Regexps] )
           Make  a  copy  of  the  header, optionally limited only to the header lines specified by @names.  See
           <b>grepNames()</b> on the way these fields can be used.

           example:

            my $newhead = $head-&gt;clone('Subject', 'Received');

       Mail::Message::Head::Complete-&gt;<b>new</b>(%options)
           Inherited, see "Constructors" in Mail::Message::Head

   <b>The</b> <b>header</b>
       Extends "The header" in Mail::Message::Head.

       $obj-&gt;<b>isDelayed</b>()
           Inherited, see "The header" in Mail::Message::Head

       $obj-&gt;<b>isEmpty</b>()
           Inherited, see "The header" in Mail::Message::Head

       $obj-&gt;<b>isModified</b>()
           Inherited, see "The header" in Mail::Message::Head

       $obj-&gt;<b>knownNames</b>()
           Inherited, see "The header" in Mail::Message::Head

       $obj-&gt;<b>message</b>( [$message] )
           Inherited, see "The header" in Mail::Message::Head

       $obj-&gt;<b>modified</b>( [BOOLEAN] )
           Inherited, see "The header" in Mail::Message::Head

       $obj-&gt;<b>nrLines</b>()
           Return the number of lines needed to display this header (including the trailing newline)

       $obj-&gt;<b>orderedFields</b>()
           Inherited, see "The header" in Mail::Message::Head

       $obj-&gt;<b>size</b>()
           Return the number of bytes needed to display  this  header  (including  the  trailing  newline).   On
           systems  which  use CRLF as line separator, the number of lines in the header (see <b>nrLines()</b>) must be
           added to find the actual size in the file.

       $obj-&gt;<b>wrap</b>($integer)
           Re-fold all fields from the header to contain at most $integer number of characters per line.

           example: re-folding a header

            $msg-&gt;head-&gt;<a href="../man78/wrap.78.html">wrap</a>(78);

   <b>Access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>header</b>
       Extends "Access to the header" in Mail::Message::Head.

       $obj-&gt;<b>add</b>( $field | $line | &lt;$name, $body, [$attrs]&gt; )
           Add a field to the header.  If a field is added more than once, all values are stored in the  header,
           in the order they are added.

           When  a $field object is specified (some Mail::Message::Field instance), that will be added.  Another
           possibility is to specify a raw header $line, or a header line nicely split-up in $name and $body, in
           which case the field constructor is called for you.

           $line or $body specifications which are terminated by a  new-line  are  considered  to  be  correctly
           folded.   Lines  which are not terminated by a new-line will be folded when needed: new-lines will be
           added where required.  It is strongly advised to let MailBox do the folding for you.

           The return value of this  method  is  the  Mail::Message::Field  object  which  is  created  (or  was
           specified).

           example:

            my $head  = Mail::Message::Head-&gt;new;
            $head-&gt;add('Subject: hi!');
            $head-&gt;add(From =&gt; 'me@home');
            my $field = Mail::Message::Field-&gt;new('To: you@there');
            $head-&gt;add($field);
            my Mail::Message::Field $s = $head-&gt;add(Sender =&gt; 'I');

       $obj-&gt;<b>addListGroup</b>($object)
           A  <u>list</u>  <u>group</u>  is  a  set of header fields which contain data about a mailing list which was used to
           transmit the message.  See Mail::Message::Head::ListGroup for details about the implementation of the
           $object.

           When you have a list group prepared, you can add it later using  this  method.   You  will  get  your
           private  copy  of  the  list  group  data  in return, because the same group can be used for multiple
           messages.

           example: of adding a list group to a header

            my $lg = Mail::Message::Head::ListGroup-&gt;new(...);
            my $own_lg = $msg-&gt;head-&gt;addListGroup($lg);

       $obj-&gt;<b>addResentGroup</b>($resent_group|$data)
           Add a $resent_group (a Mail::Message::Head::ResentGroup object) to the header.  If you specify $data,
           that is used to create such group first.  If no "Received" line is specified, it will be created  for
           you.

           These  header  lines  have nothing to do with the user's sense of "reply" or "forward" actions: these
           lines trace the e-mail transport mechanism.

           example:

            my $rg = Mail::Message::Head::ResentGroup-&gt;new(head =&gt; $head, ...);
            $head-&gt;addResentGroup($rg);

            my $rg = $head-&gt;addResentGroup(From =&gt; 'me');

       $obj-&gt;<b>addSpamGroup</b>($object)
           A <u>spam</u> <u>fighting</u> <u>group</u> is a set of header fields which contains data which is used to fight spam.  See
           Mail::Message::Head::SpamGroup for details about the implementation of the $object.

           When you have a spam group prepared, you can add it later using  this  method.   You  will  get  your
           private  copy  of  the  spam  group  data  in return, because the same group can be used for multiple
           messages.

           example: of adding a spam group to a header

            my $sg = Mail::Message::Head::SpamGroup-&gt;new(...);
            my $own_sg = $msg-&gt;head-&gt;addSpamGroup($sg);

       $obj-&gt;<b>count</b>($name)
           Count the number of fields with this $name.  Most fields will return 1: only one  occurrence  in  the
           header.  As example, the "Received" fields are usually present more than once.

       $obj-&gt;<b>delete</b>($name)
           Remove the field with the specified name.  If the header contained multiple lines with the same name,
           they  will  be  replaced  all together.  This method simply calls <b>reset()</b> without replacement fields.
           READ THE IMPORTANT WARNING IN <b>removeField()</b>

       $obj-&gt;<b>get</b>( $name, [$index] )
           Inherited, see "Access to the header" in Mail::Message::Head

       $obj-&gt;<b>grepNames</b>( [@names|ARRAY|Regexps] )
           Filter from all header fields those with names which start will any of the specified list.   When  no
           names  are specified, all fields will be returned.  The list is ordered as they where read from file,
           or added later.

           The @names are considered regular expressions, and will all be matched case insensitive and  attached
           to the front of the string only.  You may also specify one or more prepared regexes.

           example:

            my @f  = $head-&gt;grepNames();       # same as $head-&gt;orderedFields
            my @f  = $head-&gt;grepNames('X-', 'Subject', ');
            my @to = $head-&gt;grepNames('To\b'); # will only select To

       $obj-&gt;<b>listGroup</b>()
           Returns  a  <u>list</u>  <u>group</u> description: the set of headers which form the information about mailing list
           software used to transport the message.  See also <b>addListGroup()</b> and <b>removeListGroup()</b>.

           example: use of <b>listGroup()</b>

            if(my $lg = $msg-&gt;head-&gt;listGroup)
            {  $lg-&gt;print(\*STDERR);
               $lg-&gt;delete;
            }

            $msg-&gt;head-&gt;removeListGroup;

       $obj-&gt;<b>names</b>()
           Returns a full ordered list of known field names, as  defined  in  the  header.   Fields  which  were
           <b>reset()</b> to be empty will still be listed here.

       $obj-&gt;<b>print</b>( [$fh] )
           Print  all  headers to the specified $fh, by default the selected filehandle.  See <b>printUndisclosed()</b>
           to limit the headers to include only the public headers.

           example:

            $head-&gt;print(\*OUT);
            $head-&gt;print;

            my $fh = IO::File-&gt;new(...);
            $head-&gt;print($fh);

       $obj-&gt;<b>printSelected</b>($fh, &lt;STRING|Regexp&gt;, ...)
           Like the usual <b>print()</b>, the header lines are printed to the specified $fh.  In  this  case,  however,
           only  the  fields  with  names as specified by STRING (case insensative) or Regexp are printed.  They
           will stay the in-order of the source header.

           example: printing only a subset of the fields

            $head-&gt;printSelected(STDOUT, qw/Subject From To/, qr/^x\-(spam|xyz)\-/i)

       $obj-&gt;<b>printUndisclosed</b>( [$fh] )
           Like the usual <b>print()</b>, the header lines are printed to the specified $fh, by  default  the  selected
           filehandle.  In this case, however, "Bcc" and "Resent-Bcc" lines are included.

       $obj-&gt;<b>removeContentInfo</b>()
           Remove all body related fields from the header.  The header will become partial.

       $obj-&gt;<b>removeField</b>($field)
           Remove the specified $field object from the header.  This is useful when there are possible more than
           one  fields  with  the  same  name,  and you need to remove exactly one of them.  Also have a look at
           <b>delete()</b>, <b>reset()</b>, and <b>set()</b>.

           See also <b>Mail::Message::Head::Partial::removeFields()</b> (mind the 's' at the end of  the  name),  which
           accepts a string or regular expression as argument to select the fields to be removed.

           WARNING WARNING WARNING: for performance reasons, the header administration uses weak references (see
           Scalar::Util  method  <b>weaken()</b>&gt;  to figure-out which fields have been removed.  A header is a hash of
           field for fast search and an array of weak references to remember the order of the  fields,  required
           for  printing.  If the field is removed from the hash, the weak-ref is set to undef and the field not
           printed.

           However... it is easy to disturb this process.  Example:
            my $msg = ....;                 # subject ref-count = 1 + 0 = 1
            $msg-&gt;head-&gt;delete('Subject');  # subject ref-count =     0 = 0: clean-up
            $msg-&gt;print;                    # subject doesn't show: ok

           But
            my $msg = ....;                 # subject ref-count = 1 + 0 = 1
            my $s = $msg-&gt;head-&gt;get('subject'); # ref-count = 1 + 1 + 0 = 2
            $msg-&gt;head-&gt;delete('Subject');  # subject ref-count = 1 + 0 = 1: no clean-up
            $msg-&gt;print;                    # subject DOES show: not ok
            undef $s;                       # ref-count becomes 0: clean-up
            $msg-&gt;print;                    # subject doesn't show: ok

           To avoid the latter situation, do not catch the field object, but only the field content.   SAVE  are
           all methods which return the text:
            my $s = $msg-&gt;head-&gt;get('subject')-&gt;body;
            my $s = $msg-&gt;head-&gt;get('subject')-&gt;unfoldedBody;
            my $s = $msg-&gt;head-&gt;get('subject')-&gt;foldedBody;
            my $s = $msg-&gt;head-&gt;get('subject')-&gt;foldedBody;
            my $s = $msg-&gt;get('subject');
            my $s = $msg-&gt;subject;
            my $s = $msg-&gt;string;

       $obj-&gt;<b>removeFields</b>( &lt;STRING|Regexp&gt;, ... )
           The  header  object  is  turned  into a Mail::Message::Head::Partial object which has a set of fields
           removed.      Read      about      the      implications      and      the      possibilities      in
           <b>Mail::Message::Head::Partial::removeFields()</b>.

       $obj-&gt;<b>removeFieldsExcept</b>( &lt;STRING|Regexp&gt;, ... )
           The  header  object  is  turned  into a Mail::Message::Head::Partial object which has a set of fields
           removed.      Read      about      the      implications      and      the      possibilities      in
           <b>Mail::Message::Head::Partial::removeFieldsExcept()</b>.

       $obj-&gt;<b>removeListGroup</b>()
           Removes  all fields related to mailing list administration at once.  The header object is turned into
           a Mail::Message::Head::Partial  object.   Read  about  the  implications  and  the  possibilities  in
           <b>Mail::Message::Head::Partial::removeListGroup()</b>.

       $obj-&gt;<b>removeResentGroups</b>()
           Removes  all  resent groups at once.  The header object is turned into a Mail::Message::Head::Partial
           object.       Read      about      the      implications      and      the      possibilities      in
           <b>Mail::Message::Head::Partial::removeResentGroups()</b>.

       $obj-&gt;<b>removeSpamGroups</b>()
           Removes all fields which were added by various spam detection software at once.  The header object is
           turned into a Mail::Message::Head::Partial object.  Read about the implications and the possibilities
           in <b>Mail::Message::Head::Partial::removeSpamGroups()</b>.

       $obj-&gt;<b>resentGroups</b>()
           Returns  a  list  of  Mail::Message::Head::ResentGroup  objects which each represent one intermediate
           point in the message's transmission in the order as they appear in the header: the  most  recent  one
           first.  See also <b>addResentGroup()</b> and <b>removeResentGroups()</b>.

           A  resent  group contains a set of header fields whose names start with "Resent-*".  Before the first
           "Resent" line is <u>trace</u> information, which is composed of  an  optional  "Return-Path"  field  and  an
           required "Received" field.

       $obj-&gt;<b>reset</b>($name, @fields)
           Replace  the  values  in  the  header  fields named by $name with the values specified in the list of
           @fields. A single name can correspond to multiple repeated fields.  READ  THE  IMPORTANT  WARNING  IN
           <b>removeField()</b>

           Removing  fields  which  are part of one of the predefined field groups is not a smart idea.  You can
           better remove these fields as group, all together.  For instance, the 'Received' lines  are  part  of
           resent  groups,  'X-Spam'  is past of a spam group, and "List-Post" belongs to a list group.  You can
           delete a whole group  with  <b>Mail::Message::Head::FieldGroup::delete()</b>,  or  with  methods  which  are
           provided by Mail::Message::Head::Partial.

           If FIELDS is empty, the corresponding $name fields will be removed. The location of removed fields in
           the  header  order will be remembered. Fields with the same name which are added later will appear at
           the remembered position.  This is equivalent to the <b>delete()</b> method.

           example:

            # reduce number of 'Keywords' lines to last 5)
            my @keywords = $head-&gt;get('Keywords');
            $head-&gt;reset('Keywords', @keywords[-5..-1]) if @keywords &gt; 5;

            # Reduce the number of Received lines to only the last added one.
            my @rgs = $head-&gt;resentGroups;
            shift @rgs;     # keep this one (later is added in front)
            $_-&gt;delete foreach @rgs;

       $obj-&gt;<b>set</b>( $field | $line | &lt;$name, $body, [$attrs]&gt; )
           The "set" method is similar to the <b>add()</b> method, and takes the same options. However, existing values
           for fields will be removed before a new value is added.  READ THE IMPORTANT WARNING IN <b>removeField()</b>

       $obj-&gt;<b>spamDetected</b>()
           Returns whether one of the spam groups defines a report about spam.  If there are not  header  fields
           in  the  message  which relate to spam-detection software, "undef" is returned.  The spamgroups which
           report spam are returned.

           example:

            $message-&gt;delete if $message-&gt;spamDetected;

            call_spamassassin($message)
               unless defined $message-&gt;spamDetected;

       $obj-&gt;<b>spamGroups</b>( [$names] )
           Returns a list of Mail::Message::Head::SpamGroup objects, each collecting some  lines  which  contain
           spam fighting information.  When any $names are given, then only these groups are returned.  See also
           <b>addSpamGroup()</b> and <b>removeSpamGroups()</b>.

           In scalar context, with exactly one NAME specified, that group will be returned.  With more $names or
           without $names, a list will be returned (which defaults to the length of the list in scalar context).

           example: use of <b>listGroup()</b>

            my @sg = $msg-&gt;head-&gt;spamGroups;
            $sg[0]-&gt;print(\*STDERR);
            $sg[-1]-&gt;delete;

            my $sg = $msg-&gt;head-&gt;spamGroups('SpamAssassin');

       $obj-&gt;<b>string</b>()
           Returns the whole header as one scalar (in scalar context) or list of lines (list context).  Triggers
           completion.

           For some kinds of folders, <b>Mail::Message::guessTimestamp()</b> may produce a better result, for  instance
           by looking at the modification time of the file in which the message is stored.  Also some protocols,
           like POP can supply that information.

       $obj-&gt;<b>recvstamp</b>()
           Returns  an indication about when the message was sent, but only using the "Date" field in the header
           as last resort: we do not trust the  sender  of  the  message  to  specify  the  correct  date.   See
           <b>timestamp()</b> when you do trust the sender.

           Many spam producers fake a date, which mess up the order of receiving things.  The timestamp which is
           produced is derived from the Received headers, if they are present, and "undef" otherwise.

           The  timestamp  is  encoded as "time" is on your system (see perldoc -f time), and as such usable for
           the "gmtime" and "localtime" methods.

           example: of time-sorting folders with received messages

            my $folder = $mgr-&gt;open('InBox');
            my @messages = sort {$a-&gt;recvstamp &lt;=&gt; $b-&gt;recvstamp}
                              $folder-&gt;messages;

           example: of time-sorting messages of mixed origin

            my $folder = $mgr-&gt;open('MyFolder');

            # Pre-calculate timestamps to be sorted (for speed)
            my @stamps = map { [ ($_-&gt;timestamp || 0), $_ ] }
                                $folder-&gt;messages;

            my @sorted
              = map { $_-&gt;[1] }      # get the message for the stamp
                  sort {$a-&gt;[0] &lt;=&gt; $b-&gt;[0]}   # stamps are numerics
                     @stamps;

       $obj-&gt;<b>timestamp</b>()
           Returns an indication about when the message was sent, with as little guessing as possible.  In  this
           case,  the date as specified by the sender is trusted.  See <b>recvstamp()</b> when you do not want to trust
           the sender.

           The timestamp is encoded as "time" is on your system (see perldoc -f time), and as  such  usable  for
           the "gmtime" and "localtime" methods.

       $obj-&gt;<b>createFromLine</b>()
           For  some  mail-folder  types  separate  messages by a line starting with '"From "'.  If a message is
           moved to such folder from a folder-type which does not  support  these  separators,  this  method  is
           called to produce one.

       $obj-&gt;<b>createMessageId</b>()
           Creates  a  message-id for this message.  This method will be run when a new message is created, or a
           message is discovered without the message-id header field.  Message-ids are required for detection of
           message-threads.  See <b>messageIdPrefix()</b>.

       $obj-&gt;<b>messageIdPrefix</b>( [$prefix, [$hostname]|CODE] )
       Mail::Message::Head::Complete-&gt;<b>messageIdPrefix</b>( [$prefix, [$hostname]|CODE] )
           When options are provided, it sets a new way to create message-ids,  as  used  by  <b>createMessageId()</b>.
           You have two choices: either by providing a $prefix and optionally a $hostname, or a CODE reference.

           The  CODE  reference will be called with the header as first argument.  You must ensure yourself that
           the returned value is RFC compliant.

           The $prefix defaults to "mailbox-$$", the $hostname defaults to the return of Net::Domains's function
           hostfqdn(), or when not installed, the Sys::Hostname's function hostname().   Inbetween  the  two,  a
           nano-second  time provided by Time::HiRes is used.  If that module is not available, "time" is called
           at the start of the program, and incremented for each newly created id.

           In any case, a subroutine will be created to be used.  A reference to that will  be  returned.   When
           the method is called without arguments, but no subroutine is defined yet, one will be created.

           example: setting a message prefix

             $head-&gt;messageIdPrefix('prefix');
             Mail::Message::Head::Complete-&gt;messageIdPrefix('prefix');
             my $code = $head-&gt;messageIdPrefix('mailbox', 'nohost');

             sub new_msgid()
             {   my $head = shift;
                 "myid-$$-${(rand 10000)}@example.com";
             }

             $many_msg-&gt;messageIdPrefix(\&amp;new_msgid);
             Mail::Message::Head::Complete-&gt;messageIdPrefix(&amp;new_msgid);

       Warning: Cannot remove field $name from header: not found.
           You  ask to remove a field which is not known in the header.  Using <b>delete()</b>, <b>reset()</b>, or <b>set()</b> to do
           the job will not result in warnings: those methods check the existence of the field first.

       Warning: Field objects have an implied name ($name)
       Error: Package $package does not implement $method.
           Fatal error: the specific package (or one of its superclasses) does not implement this  method  where
           it  should.  This  message means that some other related classes do implement this method however the
           class at hand does not.  Probably you should investigate this and probably inform the author  of  the
           package.
