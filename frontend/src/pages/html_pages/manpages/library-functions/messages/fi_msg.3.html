</pre><h4><b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>ep</u>     Fabric endpoint on which to initiate send or post receive buffer.

       <u>buf</u>    Data buffer to send or receive.

       <u>len</u>    Length of data buffer to send or receive, specified in bytes.  Valid transfers are from 0 bytes up
              to the endpoint’s max_msg_size.

       <u>iov</u>    Vectored data buffer.

       <u>count</u>  Count of vectored data entries.

       <u>desc</u>   Descriptor associated with the data buffer.  See <b><a href="../man3/fi_mr.3.html">fi_mr</a></b>(3).

       <u>data</u>   Remote CQ data to transfer with the sent message.

       <u>dest_addr</u>
              Destination address for connectionless transfers.  Ignored for connected endpoints.

       <u>src_addr</u>
              Applies only to connectionless endpoints configured with the FI_DIRECTED_RECV.  For all other end‐
              point  configurations,  src_addr is ignored.  src_addr defines the source address to receive from.
              By default, the src_addr is treated as a source endpoint  address  (i.e. fi_addr_t  returned  from
              fi_av_insert  /  fi_av_insertsvc  /  fi_av_remove).   If  the  FI_AUTH_KEY  flag is specified with
              fi_recvmsg, src_addr is treated as  a  source  authorization  key  (i.e. fi_addr_t  returned  from
              fi_av_insert_auth_key).  If set to FI_ADDR_UNSPEC, any source address may match.

       <u>msg</u>    Message descriptor for send and receive operations.

       <u>flags</u>  Additional flags to apply for the send or receive operation.

       <u>context</u>
              User  specified  pointer to associate with the operation.  This parameter is ignored if the opera‐
              tion will not generate a successful completion, unless an op flag specifies the context  parameter
              be used for required input.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  send  functions – fi_send, fi_sendv, fi_sendmsg, fi_inject, and fi_senddata – are used to transmit a
       message from one endpoint to another endpoint.  The main difference between send functions are the number
       and type of parameters that they accept as input.  Otherwise, they perform  the  same  general  function.
       Messages  sent  using fi_msg operations are received by a remote endpoint into a buffer posted to receive
       such messages.

       The receive functions – fi_recv, fi_recvv, fi_recvmsg – post a data buffer to an endpoint to receive  in‐
       bound messages.  Similar to the send operations, receive operations operate asynchronously.  Users should
       not touch the posted data buffer(s) until the receive operation has completed.

       An  endpoint  must  be enabled before an application can post send or receive operations to it.  For con‐
       nected endpoints, receive buffers may be posted prior to connect or accept being called on the  endpoint.
       This  ensures  that  buffers  are available to receive incoming data immediately after the connection has
       been established.

       Completed message operations are reported to the user through one or  more  event  collectors  associated
       with  the  endpoint.   Users provide context which are associated with each operation, and is returned to
       the user as part of the event completion.  See fi_cq for completion event details.

   <b>fi_send</b>
       The call fi_send transfers the data contained in the user-specified data buffer  to  a  remote  endpoint,
       with message boundaries being maintained.

   <b>fi_sendv</b>
       The  fi_sendv  call adds support for a scatter-gather list to fi_send.  The fi_sendv transfers the set of
       data buffers referenced by the iov parameter to a remote endpoint as a single message.

   <b>fi_sendmsg</b>
       The fi_sendmsg call supports data transfers over both connected and connectionless  endpoints,  with  the
       ability to control the send operation per call through the use of flags.  The fi_sendmsg function takes a
       <b>struct</b> <b>fi_msg</b> as input.

              struct fi_msg {
                  const struct iovec *msg_iov; /* scatter-gather array */
                  void               **desc;   /* local request descriptors */
                  size_t             iov_count;/* # elements in iov */
                  fi_addr_t          addr;     /* optional endpoint address */
                  void               *context; /* user-defined context */
                  uint64_t           data;     /* optional message data */
              };

   <b>fi_inject</b>
       The  send  inject  call  is an optimized version of fi_send with the following characteristics.  The data
       buffer is available for reuse immediately on return from the call, and no CQ entry will be written if the
       transfer completes successfully.

       Conceptually, this means that the fi_inject function behaves as if the FI_INJECT transfer flag were  set,
       selective  completions  are enabled, and the FI_COMPLETION flag is not specified.  Note that the CQ entry
       will be suppressed even if the default behavior of the endpoint is to write CQ entries for all successful
       completions.  See the flags discussion below for more details.  The requested message size  that  can  be
       used with fi_inject is limited by inject_size.

       If  FI_HMEM  is  enabled, the fi_inject call can only accept buffer with iface equal to FI_HMEM_SYSTEM if
       the provider requires the FI_MR_HMEM mr_mode.  This limitation applies to all the fi_*inject*  calls  and
       does not affect how inject_size is reported.

   <b>fi_senddata</b>
       The  send  data  call  is  similar  to  fi_send, but allows for the sending of remote CQ data (see FI_RE‐
       MOTE_CQ_DATA flag) as part of the transfer.

   <b>fi_injectdata</b>
       The inject data call is similar to fi_inject, but allows for the sending of remote CQ  data  (see  FI_RE‐
       MOTE_CQ_DATA flag) as part of the transfer.

   <b>fi_recv</b>
       The fi_recv call posts a data buffer to the receive queue of the corresponding endpoint.  Posted receives
       are  searched  in  the  order  in which they were posted in order to match sends.  Message boundaries are
       maintained.  The order in which the receives complete is dependent on the  endpoint  type  and  protocol.
       For  connectionless  endpoints,  the  src_addr  parameter can be used to indicate that a buffer should be
       posted to receive incoming data from a specific remote endpoint.

   <b>fi_recvv</b>
       The fi_recvv call adds support for a scatter-gather list to fi_recv.  The fi_recvv posts the set of  data
       buffers referenced by the iov parameter to a receive incoming data.

   <b>fi_recvmsg</b>
       The  fi_recvmsg  call supports posting buffers over both connected and connectionless endpoints, with the
       ability to control the receive operation per call through the use  of  flags.   The  fi_recvmsg  function
       takes a struct fi_msg as input.

</pre><h4><b>FLAGS</b></h4><pre>
       The  fi_recvmsg and fi_sendmsg calls allow the user to specify flags which can change the default message
       handling of the endpoint.  Flags specified with fi_recvmsg / fi_sendmsg override  most  flags  previously
       configured  with  the  endpoint, except where noted (see fi_endpoint.3).  The following list of flags are
       usable with fi_recvmsg and/or fi_sendmsg.

       <u>FI_REMOTE_CQ_DATA</u>
              Applies to fi_sendmsg.  Indicates that remote CQ data is available and should be sent as  part  of
              the request.  See fi_getinfo for additional details on FI_REMOTE_CQ_DATA.  This flag is implicitly
              set for fi_senddata and fi_injectdata.

       <u>FI_COMPLETION</u>
              Indicates  that  a completion entry should be generated for the specified operation.  The endpoint
              must be bound to a completion queue with FI_SELECTIVE_COMPLETION that corresponds to the specified
              operation, or this flag is ignored.

       <u>FI_MORE</u>
              Indicates that the user has additional requests that will immediately be posted after the  current
              call  returns.   Use of this flag may improve performance by enabling the provider to optimize its
              access to the fabric hardware.

       <u>FI_INJECT</u>
              Applies to fi_sendmsg.  Indicates that the outbound data buffer should be returned to user immedi‐
              ately after the send call returns, even if the operation is handled asynchronously.  This may  re‐
              quire  that  the underlying provider implementation copy the data into a local buffer and transfer
              out of that buffer.  This flag can only be used with messages smaller than inject_size.

       <u>FI_MULTI_RECV</u>
              Applies to posted receive operations.  This flag allows the user to post a single buffer that will
              receive multiple incoming messages.  Received messages will be packed into the receive buffer  un‐
              til the buffer has been consumed.  Use of this flag may cause a single posted receive operation to
              generate  multiple  events as messages are placed into the buffer.  The placement of received data
              into the buffer may be subjected to provider specific alignment restrictions.

       The buffer will be released by the provider when the available buffer space  falls  below  the  specified
       minimum  (see FI_OPT_MIN_MULTI_RECV).  Note that an entry to the associated receive completion queue will
       always be generated when the buffer has been consumed, even if other receive completions have  been  sup‐
       pressed  (i.e. the  Rx  context  has been configured for FI_SELECTIVE_COMPLETION).  See the FI_MULTI_RECV
       completion flag <b><a href="../man3/fi_cq.3.html">fi_cq</a></b>(3).

       <u>FI_INJECT_COMPLETE</u>
              Applies to fi_sendmsg.  Indicates that a completion should be generated when the source  buffer(s)
              may be reused.

       <u>FI_TRANSMIT_COMPLETE</u>
              Applies to fi_sendmsg and fi_recvmsg.  For sends, indicates that a completion should not be gener‐
              ated  until  the operation has been successfully transmitted and is no longer being tracked by the
              provider.  For receive operations, indicates that a completion may be generated  as  soon  as  the
              message  has  been processed by the local provider, even if the message data may not be visible to
              all processing elements.  See <b><a href="../man3/fi_cq.3.html">fi_cq</a></b>(3) for target side completion semantics.

       <u>FI_DELIVERY_COMPLETE</u>
              Applies to fi_sendmsg.  Indicates that a completion should be generated  when  the  operation  has
              been processed by the destination.

       <u>FI_FENCE</u>
              Applies to transmits.  Indicates that the requested operation, also known as the fenced operation,
              and any operation posted after the fenced operation will be deferred until all previous operations
              targeting  the  same  peer  endpoint have completed.  Operations posted after the fencing will see
              and/or replace the results of any operations initiated prior to the fenced operation.

       The ordering of operations starting at the posting of the fenced operation (inclusive) to the posting  of
       a subsequent fenced operation (exclusive) is controlled by the endpoint’s ordering semantics.

       <u>FI_MULTICAST</u>
              Applies  to transmits.  This flag indicates that the address specified as the data transfer desti‐
              nation is a multicast address.  This flag must be used in all multicast transfers, in  conjunction
              with a multicast fi_addr_t.

       <u>FI_AUTH_KEY</u>
              Only  valid  with  domains  configured with FI_AV_AUTH_KEY and connectionless endpoints configured
              with FI_DIRECTED_RECV.  When used with fi_recvmsg, this flag denotes that the src_addr is  an  au‐
              thorization key fi_addr_t instead of an endpoint fi_addr_t.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       If  an endpoint has been configured with FI_MSG_PREFIX, the application must include buffer space of size
       msg_prefix_size, as specified by the endpoint attributes.  The prefix buffer must occur at the  start  of
       the  data referenced by the buf parameter, or be referenced by the first IO vector.  Message prefix space
       cannot be split between multiple IO vectors.  The size of the prefix buffer should be included as part of
       the total buffer length.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       Returns 0 on success.  On error, a negative value corresponding to fabric errno is returned.  Fabric  er‐
       rno values are defined in <b>rdma/fi_errno.h</b>.

       See the discussion below for details handling FI_EAGAIN.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>-FI_EAGAIN</u>
              Indicates  that  the  underlying provider currently lacks the resources needed to initiate the re‐
              quested operation.  The reasons for a provider returning FI_EAGAIN are  varied.   However,  common
              reasons include insufficient internal buffering or full processing queues.

       Insufficient  internal  buffering is often associated with operations that use FI_INJECT.  In such cases,
       additional buffering may become available as posted operations complete.

       Full processing queues may be a temporary state related to local processing (for example, a large message
       is being transferred), or may be the result of flow control.  In the latter case, the queues  may  remain
       blocked until additional resources are made available at the remote side of the transfer.

       In  all  cases,  the  operation  may  be retried after additional resources become available.  When using
       FI_PROGRESS_MANUAL, the application must check for  transmit  and  receive  completions  after  receiving
       FI_EAGAIN as a return value, independent of the operation which failed.  This is also strongly recommend‐
       ed  when using FI_PROGRESS_AUTO, as acknowledgements or flow control messages may need to be processed in
       order to resume execution.
