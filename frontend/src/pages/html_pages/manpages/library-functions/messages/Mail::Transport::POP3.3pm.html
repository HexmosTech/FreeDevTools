</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Mail::Transport::POP3 - receive messages via POP3

</pre><h4><b>INHERITANCE</b></h4><pre>
        Mail::Transport::POP3
          is a Mail::Transport::Receive
          is a Mail::Transport
          is a Mail::Reporter

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        my $receiver = Mail::Transport::POP3-&gt;new(...);
        my $message = $receiver-&gt;receive($id);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Receive messages via the POP3 protocol from one remote server, as specified in rfc1939.  This object
       hides much of the complications in the protocol and recovers broken connections automatically.  Although
       it is part of the MailBox distribution, this object can be used separately.

       You probably should <b>not</b> <b>use</b> <b>this</b> module, but Mail::Box::POP3.  This module is the interface to POP3,
       whereas Mail::Box::POP3 hides the protocol weirdness and works as any other mail folder.

       Extends "DESCRIPTION" in Mail::Transport::Receive.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       Extends "METHODS" in Mail::Transport::Receive.

   <b>Constructors</b>
       Extends "Constructors" in Mail::Transport::Receive.

       Mail::Transport::POP3-&gt;<b>new</b>(%options)
           Create a new pop3 server connection.  One object can only handle one connection: for a single user to
           one  single  server.  If the server could not be reached, or when the login fails, this instantiating
           "new" will return "undef".

            -Option      --Defined in     --Default

           authenticate =&gt; 'LOGIN'|'APOP'|'AUTO'
             Authenthication method.  The standard defines two methods, named LOGIN and APOP.  The  first  sends
             the  username  and password in plain text to the server to get permission, the latter encrypts this
             data using MD5.  When AUTO is used, first APOP is tried, and then LOGIN.

           trace =&gt; LEVEL
           use_ssl =&gt; BOOLEAN
             To set the SSL parameters, use  IO::Socket::SSL  subroutine  set_defaults.   Connections  will  get
             restarted when they are lost: you have to keep the defaults in place during POP actions.

   <b>Receiving</b> <b>mail</b>
       Extends "Receiving mail" in Mail::Transport::Receive.

       $obj-&gt;<b>receive</b>( [$unique_message_id] )
           Inherited, see "Receiving mail" in Mail::Transport::Receive

   <b>Exchanging</b> <b>information</b>
       $obj-&gt;<b>deleteFetched</b>()
           Mark all messages that have been fetched with <b>message()</b> for deletion.  See <b>fetched()</b>.

       $obj-&gt;<b>deleted</b>(BOOLEAN, @ids)
           Either  mark  the specified message(s) to be deleted on the remote server or unmark them for deletion
           (if the first parameter is false).  Deletion of messages will take place <b>only</b> when the connection  is
           specifically disconnected or the last reference to the object goes out of scope.

       $obj-&gt;<b>disconnect</b>()
           Break contact with the server, if that (still) exists.  Returns true if successful.  Please note that
           even  if  the  disconnect was not successful, all knowledge of messages etc. will be removed from the
           object: the object basically has reverted to the state in which it was before anything was done  with
           the mail box.

       $obj-&gt;<b>fetched</b>()
           Returns  a  reference  to a list of ID's that have been fetched using <b>message()</b>.  This can be used to
           update a database of messages that were fetched (but maybe not yet deleted) from the mailbox.

           Please note that if the POP3 server did not support the UIDL command, this method will always  return
           undef  because  it is not possibly to reliably identify messages between sessions (other than looking
           at the contents of the messages themselves).

           See also <b>deleteFetched()</b>.

       $obj-&gt;<b>folderSize</b>()
           Returns the total number of octets used by the mailbox on the remote server.

       $obj-&gt;<b>header</b>( $id, [$bodylines] )
           Returns a reference to an array which contains the header of the  message  with  the  specified  $id.
           "undef" is returned if something has gone wrong.

           The optional integer $bodylines specifies the number of lines from the body which should be added, by
           default none.

           example:

            my $ref_lines = $pop3-&gt;header($uidl);
            print @$ref_lines;

       $obj-&gt;<b>id2n</b>($id)
           Translates  the unique $id of a message into a sequence number which represents the message as long a
           this connection to the POP3 server exists.  When the  message  has  been  deleted  for  some  reason,
           "undef" is returned.

       $obj-&gt;<b>ids</b>()
           Returns  a  list  (in list context) or a reference to a list (in scalar context) of all IDs which are
           known by the server on this moment.

       $obj-&gt;<b>message</b>($id)
           Returns a reference to an array which contains the lines of  the  message  with  the  specified  $id.
           Returns "undef" if something has gone wrong.

           example:

            my $ref_lines = $pop3-&gt;message($uidl);
            print @$ref_lines;

       $obj-&gt;<b>messageSize</b>($id)
           Returns  the  size  of the message which is indicated by the $id, in octets.  If the message has been
           deleted on the remote server, this will return "undef".

       $obj-&gt;<b>messages</b>()
           Returns (in scalar context only) the number of messages that are known to exist in the mailbox.

   <b>Protocol</b> <b>internals</b>
       The follow methods handle protocol internals, and should not be used by a normal user of this class.

       $obj-&gt;<b>login</b>()
           Establish a new connection to the POP3 server, using username and password.

       $obj-&gt;<b>send</b>($socket, $data)
           Send $data to the indicated socket and return the first line read from that socket.  Logs an error if
           either writing to or reading from socket failed.

           This method does <b>not</b> attempt to reconnect or anything:  if  reading  or  writing  the  socket  fails,
           something is very definitely wrong.

       $obj-&gt;<b>sendList</b>($socket, $command)
           Sends  the  indicated  $command  to  the  specified socket, and retrieves the response.  It returns a
           reference to an array with all the lines that were reveived after the first "+OK" line and before the
           end-of-message delimiter (a single dot on a line).   Returns  "undef"  whenever  something  has  gone
           wrong.

       $obj-&gt;<b>socket</b>()
           Returns  a  connection  to  the  POP3  server.   If  there  was no connection yet, it will be created
           transparently.  If the connection with the POP3 server was lost,  it  will  be  reconnected  and  the
           assures that internal state information (STAT and UIDL) is up-to-date in the object.

           If  the  contact to the server was still present, or could be established, an IO::Socket::INET object
           is returned.  Else, "undef" is returned and no further actions should be tried on the object.

       $obj-&gt;<b>status</b>($socket)
           Update the current status of folder on the remote POP3 server.

   <b>Server</b> <b>connection</b>
       Extends "Server connection" in Mail::Transport::Receive.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       Error: Cannot connect to $host:$port for POP3: $!
           Unsuccessful in connecting to the remote POP3 server.

       Error: Cannot get the messages of pop3 via <b>messages()</b>
           It is not possible to retrieve all messages on a remote POP3 folder at  once:  each  shall  be  taken
           separately.  The POP3 folder will hide this for you.

       Error: Cannot re-connect reliably to server which doesn't support UIDL.
           The  connection  to  the  remote  POP3  was  lost,  and cannot be re-established because the server's
           protocol implementation lacks the necessary information.

       Error: Cannot read POP3 from socket: $!
           It is not possible to read the success status of the previously given POP3 command.  Connection lost?

       Error: Cannot write POP3 to socket: $@
           It is not possible to send a protocol command to the POP3 server.  Connection lost?

       Error: Could not authenticate using '$some' method.
           The authenication method to get access to the POP3 server did not result in a connection.  Maybe  you
           need a different authentication protocol, or your username with password are invalid.

       Error: Could not authenticate using any login method.
           No  authentication method was explicitly prescribed, so both AUTH and APOP were tried.  However, both
           failed.  There are other authentication methods, which are not defined by the main POP3 RFC  rfc1939.
           These protocols are not implemented yet.  Please contribute your implementation.

       Error: POP3 Could not do a STAT
           For some weird reason, the server does not respond to the STAT call.

       Error: POP3 requires a username and password.
           No username and/or no password specified for this POP3 folder, although these are obligatory parts in
           the protocol.

       Error: Package $package does not implement $method.
           Fatal  error:  the specific package (or one of its superclasses) does not implement this method where
           it should. This message means that some other related classes do implement this  method  however  the
           class  at  hand does not.  Probably you should investigate this and probably inform the author of the
           package.

       Error: Server at $host:$port does not seem to be talking POP3.
           The remote server did not respond to an initial exchange of messages  as  is  expected  by  the  POP3
           protocol.  The server has probably a different service on the specified port.
