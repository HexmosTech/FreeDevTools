</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       sendmsg — send a message on a socket using a message structure

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;

       ssize_t sendmsg(int <u>socket</u>, const struct msghdr *<u>message</u>, int <u>flags</u>);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>sendmsg</u>()  function shall send a message through a connection-mode or connectionless-mode socket. If
       the socket is a connectionless-mode socket, the message shall be sent to the address specified by  <b>msghdr</b>
       if  no  pre-specified  peer  address  has  been set. If a peer address has been pre-specified, either the
       message shall be sent to the address specified in <b>msghdr</b> (overriding the pre-specified peer address),  or
       the  function  shall  return  -1  and  set  <u>errno</u>  to  <b>[EISCONN]</b>.   If the socket is connection-mode, the
       destination address in <b>msghdr</b> shall be ignored.

       The <u>sendmsg</u>() function takes the following arguments:

       <u>socket</u>      Specifies the socket file descriptor.

       <u>message</u>     Points to a <b>msghdr</b> structure, containing both the destination address and the buffers for the
                   outgoing message. The length and format of the address depend on the address  family  of  the
                   socket. The <u>msg_flags</u> member is ignored.

       <u>flags</u>       Specifies  the  type  of message transmission. The application may specify 0 or the following
                   flag:

                   MSG_EOR       Terminates a record (if supported by the protocol).

                   MSG_OOB       Sends  out-of-band  data  on  sockets  that  support  out-of-bound  data.   The
                                 significance and semantics of out-of-band data are protocol-specific.

                   MSG_NOSIGNAL  Requests  not  to  send  the  SIGPIPE signal if an attempt to send is made on a
                                 stream-oriented socket that is no longer connected.  The  <b>[EPIPE]</b>  error  shall
                                 still be returned.

       The <u>msg_iov</u> and <u>msg_iovlen</u> fields of <u>message</u> specify zero or more buffers containing the data to be sent.
       <u>msg_iov</u>  points  to an array of <b>iovec</b> structures; <u>msg_iovlen</u> shall be set to the dimension of this array.
       In each <b>iovec</b> structure, the <u>iov_base</u> field specifies a storage area and the <u>iov_len</u> field gives its size
       in bytes. Some of these sizes can be zero. The data from each storage area indicated by <u>msg_iov</u>  is  sent
       in turn.

       Successful  completion  of a call to <u>sendmsg</u>() does not guarantee delivery of the message. A return value
       of -1 indicates only locally-detected errors.

       If space is not available at the sending socket to hold the message to be transmitted and the socket file
       descriptor does not have O_NONBLOCK set, the <u>sendmsg</u>() function shall block until space is available.  If
       space  is  not  available at the sending socket to hold the message to be transmitted and the socket file
       descriptor does have O_NONBLOCK set, the <u>sendmsg</u>() function shall fail.

       If the socket protocol supports broadcast and the specified address is a broadcast address for the socket
       protocol, <u>sendmsg</u>() shall fail if the SO_BROADCAST option is not set for the socket.

       The socket in use may require the process to have appropriate privileges to use the <u>sendmsg</u>() function.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       Upon successful completion, <u>sendmsg</u>() shall return the number of  bytes  sent.  Otherwise,  -1  shall  be
       returned and <u>errno</u> set to indicate the error.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>sendmsg</u>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EAGAIN</b> or <b>EWOULDBLOCK</b>
              The socket's file descriptor is marked O_NONBLOCK and the requested operation would block.

       <b>EAFNOSUPPORT</b>
              Addresses in the specified address family cannot be used with this socket.

       <b>EBADF</b>  The <u>socket</u> argument is not a valid file descriptor.

       <b>ECONNRESET</b>
              A connection was forcibly closed by a peer.

       <b>EINTR</b>  A signal interrupted <u>sendmsg</u>() before any data was transmitted.

       <b>EINVAL</b> The sum of the <u>iov_len</u> values overflows an <b>ssize_t</b>.

       <b>EMSGSIZE</b>
              The message is too large to be sent all at once (as the socket requires), or the <u>msg_iovlen</u> member
              of  the  <b>msghdr</b>  structure  pointed  to  by  <u>message</u> is less than or equal to 0 or is greater than
              {IOV_MAX}.

       <b>ENOTCONN</b>
              The socket is connection-mode but is not connected.

       <b>ENOTSOCK</b>
              The <u>socket</u> argument does not refer to a socket.

       <b>EOPNOTSUPP</b>
              The <u>socket</u> argument is associated with a socket that does not support one or more  of  the  values
              set in <u>flags</u>.

       <b>EPIPE</b>  The  socket is shut down for writing, or the socket is connection-mode and is no longer connected.
              In the latter case,  and  if  the  socket  is  of  type  SOCK_STREAM  or  SOCK_SEQPACKET  and  the
              MSG_NOSIGNAL flag is not set, the SIGPIPE signal is generated to the calling thread.

       If the address family of the socket is AF_UNIX, then <u>sendmsg</u>() shall fail if:

       <b>EIO</b>    An I/O error occurred while reading from or writing to the file system.

       <b>ELOOP</b>  A  loop  exists  in  symbolic  links  encountered  during resolution of the pathname in the socket
              address.

       <b>ENAMETOOLONG</b>
              The length of a component of a pathname is longer than {NAME_MAX}.

       <b>ENOENT</b> A component of the pathname does not name an existing file or the path name is an empty string.

       <b>ENOTDIR</b>
              A component of the path prefix of the pathname in the socket address names an existing  file  that
              is  neither  a directory nor a symbolic link to a directory, or the pathname in the socket address
              contains at least one non-&lt;slash&gt; character and ends with one or more trailing &lt;slash&gt;  characters
              and  the last pathname component names an existing file that is neither a directory nor a symbolic
              link to a directory.

       The <u>sendmsg</u>() function may fail if:

       <b>EACCES</b> Search permission is denied for a component of the path prefix;  or  write  access  to  the  named
              socket is denied.

       <b>EDESTADDRREQ</b>
              The  socket  is  not  connection-mode  and  does not have its peer address set, and no destination
              address was specified.

       <b>EHOSTUNREACH</b>
              The destination host cannot be reached (probably because the host  is  down  or  a  remote  router
              cannot reach it).

       <b>EIO</b>    An I/O error occurred while reading from or writing to the file system.

       <b>EISCONN</b>
              A destination address was specified and the socket is already connected.

       <b>ENETDOWN</b>
              The local network interface used to reach the destination is down.

       <b>ENETUNREACH</b>
              No route to the network is present.

       <b>ENOBUFS</b>
              Insufficient resources were available in the system to perform the operation.

       <b>ENOMEM</b> Insufficient memory was available to fulfill the request.

       If the address family of the socket is AF_UNIX, then <u>sendmsg</u>() may fail if:

       <b>ELOOP</b>  More  than  {SYMLOOP_MAX} symbolic links were encountered during resolution of the pathname in the
              socket address.

       <b>ENAMETOOLONG</b>
              The length of a pathname exceeds {PATH_MAX}, or pathname resolution of a symbolic link produced an
              intermediate result with a length that exceeds {PATH_MAX}.
