       SMS::Send - Driver-based API for sending SMS messages

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         # Create a sender
         my $sender = SMS::Send-&gt;new('SomeDriver',
             _login    =&gt; 'myname',
             _password =&gt; 'mypassword',
         );

         # Send a message
         my $sent = $sender-&gt;send_sms(
             text =&gt; 'This is a test message',
             to   =&gt; '+61 (4) 1234 5678',
         );

         # Did the send succeed.
         if ( $sent ) {
             print "Message sent ok\n";
         } else {
             print "Failed to send message\n";
         }

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       "SMS::Send" is intended to provide a driver-based single API for sending SMS and MMS messages. The intent
       is to provide a single API against which to write the code to send an SMS message.

       At the same time, the intent is to remove the limits of some of the previous attempts at this sort of
       API, like "must be free internet-based SMS services".

       "SMS::Send" drivers are installed separately, and might use the web, email or physical SMS hardware. It
       could be a free or paid. The details shouldn't matter.

       You should not have to care how it is actually sent, only that it has been sent (although some drivers
       may not be able to provide certainty).

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>installed_drivers</b>
       The "installed_drivers" the list of SMS::Send drivers that are installed on the current system.

   <b>new</b>
         # The most basic sender
         $sender = SMS::Send-&gt;new('Test');

         # Indicate regional driver with ::
         $sender = SMS::Send-&gt;new('AU::Test');

         # Pass arbitrary params to the driver
         $sender = SMS::Send-&gt;new('MyDriver',
             _login    =&gt; 'adam',
             _password =&gt; 'adam',
         );

       The "new" constructor creates a new SMS sender.

       It takes as its first parameter a driver name. These names map the class names. For example driver "Test"
       matches the testing driver SMS::Send::Test.

       Any additional params should be key/value pairs, split into two types.

       Params without a leading underscore are "public" options and relate to standardised features within the
       SMS::Send API itself. At this time, there are no usable public options.

       Params <b>with</b> a leading underscore are "private" driver-specific options and will be passed through to the
       driver unchanged.

       Returns a new SMS::Send object, or dies on error.

   <b>send_sms</b>
         # Send a message to a particular address
         my $result = $sender-&gt;send_sms(
             text =&gt; 'This is a test message',
             to   =&gt; '+61 4 1234 5678',
         );

       The "send_sms" method sends a standard text SMS message to a destination phone number.

       It takes a set of named parameters to describe the message and its destination, again split into two
       types.

       Params without a leading underscore are "public" options and relate to standardised features within the
       SMS::Send API itself.

       text
           The  "text"  param  is  compulsory  and should be a plain text string of non-zero length. The maximum
           length is currently determined by the driver, and exceeding this length will result in  an  exception
           being thrown if you breach it.

           Better  functionality  for  determining  the  maximum-supported length is expected in the future. You
           input would be welcome.

       to  The "to" param is compulsory, and should be an international phone number as indicated by  a  leading
           plus  "+"  character.  Punctuation  in  any  form  is  allowed, and will be stripped out before it is
           provided to the driver.

           If and only if your driver is a regional  driver  (as  indicated  by  a  ::-seperated  name  such  as
           AU::Test) the "to" number can also be in a regional-specific dialing format, "without" a leading plus
           "+" character.

           Providing a regional number to a non-regional driver will throw an exception.

       Any  parameters  <b>with</b>  a  leading  underscore  are considered private driver-specific options and will be
       passed through without alteration.

       Any other parameters <b>without</b> a leading underscore will be silently stripped out and not passed through to
       the driver.

       After calling "send_sms" the driver  will  do  whatever  is  required  to  send  the  message,  including
       (potentially, but not always) waiting for a confirmation from the network that the SMS has been sent.

       Given that drivers may do the actual mechanics of sending a message by quite a large variety of different
       methods  the  "send_sms" method may potentially block for some time. Timeout functionality is expected to
       be added later.

       The "send_sms" returns true if the message was sent, or the  driver  is  fire-and-forget  and  unable  to
       determine success, or false if the message was not sent.
