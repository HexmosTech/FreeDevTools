</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Net::DBus::Binding::Message - Base class for messages

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       Sending a message

         my $msg = new Net::DBus::Binding::Message::Signal;
         my $iterator = $msg-&gt;iterator;

         $iterator-&gt;<a href="../man132/append_byte.132.html">append_byte</a>(132);
         $iterator-&gt;<a href="../man14241/append_int32.14241.html">append_int32</a>(14241);

         $connection-&gt;send($msg);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Provides a base class for the different kinds of message that can be sent/received. Instances of this
       class are never instantiated directly, rather one of the four sub-types
       Net::DBus::Binding::Message::Signal, Net::DBus::Binding::Message::MethodCall,
       Net::DBus::Binding::Message::MethodReturn, Net::DBus::Binding::Message::Error should be used.

</pre><h4><b>CONSTANTS</b></h4><pre>
       The following constants are defined in this module. They are not exported into the caller's namespace &amp;
       thus must be referenced with their fully qualified package names

       TYPE_ARRAY
           Constant representing the signature value associated with the array data type.

           Constant representing the signature value associated with the boolean data type.

       TYPE_BYTE
           Constant representing the signature value associated with the byte data type.

       TYPE_DICT_ENTRY
           Constant representing the signature value associated with the dictionary entry data type.

       TYPE_DOUBLE

           data type.

       TYPE_INT16
           Constant representing the signature value associated with the signed 16 bit integer data type.

       TYPE_INT32
           Constant representing the signature value associated with the signed 32 bit integer data type.

       TYPE_INT64
           Constant representing the signature value associated with the signed 64 bit integer data type.

       TYPE_OBJECT_PATH
           Constant representing the signature value associated with the object path data type.

       TYPE_STRING
           Constant representing the signature value associated with the UTF-8 string data type.

       TYPE_SIGNATURE
           Constant representing the signature value associated with the signature data type.

       TYPE_STRUCT
           Constant representing the signature value associated with the struct data type.

       TYPE_UINT16
           Constant representing the signature value associated with the unsigned 16 bit integer data type.

       TYPE_UINT32
           Constant representing the signature value associated with the unsigned 32 bit integer data type.

       TYPE_UINT64
           Constant representing the signature value associated with the unsigned 64 bit integer data type.

       TYPE_VARIANT
           Constant representing the signature value associated with the variant data type.

       TYPE_UNIX_FD
           Constant representing the signature value associated with the unix file descriptor data type.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       my $msg = Net::DBus::Binding::Message-&gt;new(message =&gt; $rawmessage);
           Creates a new message object, initializing it with the underlying  C  message  object  given  by  the
           "message"  object.  This  constructor  is intended for internal use only, instead refer to one of the
           four sub-types for this class for specific message types

       my $type = $msg-&gt;get_type
           Retrieves the type code for this  message.  The  returned  value  corresponds  to  one  of  the  four
           "Net::DBus::Binding::Message::MESSAGE_TYPE_*" constants.

       my $interface = $msg-&gt;get_interface
           Retrieves the name of the interface targeted by this message, possibly an empty string if there is no
           applicable interface for this message.

       my $path = $msg-&gt;get_path
           Retrieves  the  object  path  associated  with  the  message, possibly an empty string if there is no
           applicable object for this message.

       my $name = $msg-&gt;get_destination
           Retrieves the unique or well-known bus name for client intended to be the recipient of  the  message.
           Possibly returns an empty string if the message is being broadcast to all clients.

       my $name = $msg-&gt;get_sender
           Retireves the unique name of the client sending the message

       my $serial = $msg-&gt;get_serial
           Retrieves  the  unique  serial number of this message. The number is guaranteed unique for as long as
           the connection over which the message was sent remains open. May return zero, if the message  is  yet
           to be sent.

       my $name = $msg-&gt;get_member
           For  method  calls,  retrieves the name of the method to be invoked, while for signals, retrieves the
           name of the signal.

       my $sig = $msg-&gt;get_signature
           Retrieves a string representing the type signature of the values packed into the body of the message.

       $msg-&gt;set_sender($name)
           Set the name of the client sending the message. The name must be the unique name of the client.

       $msg-&gt;set_destination($name)
           Set the name of the intended recipient of the message. This is typically used for signals  to  switch
           them from broadcast to unicast.

       my $iterator = $msg-&gt;iterator;
           Retrieves  an  iterator  which can be used for reading or writing fields of the message. The returned
           object is an instance of the "Net::DBus::Binding::Iterator" class.

       $boolean = $msg-&gt;<b>get_no_reply()</b>
           Gets the flag indicating whether the message is expecting a reply to be sent.

       $msg-&gt;set_no_reply($boolean)
           Toggles the flag indicating whether the message is expecting a reply to  be  sent.  All  method  call
           messages  expect  a  reply  by default. By toggling this flag the communication latency is reduced by
           removing the need for the client to wait

       my @values = $msg-&gt;get_args_list
           De-marshall all the values in the body of the message, using the message signature to  identify  data
           types. The values are returned as a list.

       $msg-&gt;append_args_list(@values)
           Append a set of values to the body of the message. Values will be encoded as either a string, list or
           dictionary  as  appropriate  to  their  Perl  data  type.  For  more  specific data typing needs, the
           Net::DBus::Binding::Iterator object should be used instead.
