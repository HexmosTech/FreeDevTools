       Log::Agent::Message - a log message

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        require Log::Agent::Message;

        my $msg = Log::Agent::Message-&gt;make("string");
        $msg-&gt;prepend("string");
        $msg-&gt;append("string");
        my $copy = $msg-&gt;clone;

        print "Message is $msg\n";     # overloaded stringification

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The Log::Agent::Message class represents an original log message (a string) to which one may prepend or
       append other strings, but with the special property that prepended strings aggregate themselves in FIFO
       order, whilst appended strings aggregate themselves in LIFO order, which is counter-intuitive at first
       sight.

       In plain words, this means that the last routine that prepends something to the message will get its
       prepended string right next to the original string, regardless of what could have been prepended already.
       The behaviour is symmetric for appending.

</pre><h4><b>INTERFACE</b></h4><pre>
       The following routines are available:

       append($str)
           Append  suppled  string  $str  to  the  original  string (given at creation time), at the head of all
           existing appended strings.

       append_last($str)
           Append suppled string $str to the original string (given at  creation  time),  at  the  tail  of  all
           existing appended strings.

       clone
           Clone the message. This is not a shallow clone, because the list of prepended and appended strings is
           recreated.  However  it  is not a deep clone, because the items held in those lists are merely copied
           (this would matter only when other objects with overloaded stringification routines were supplied  to
           <b>prepend()</b> and <b>append()</b>, which is not the case today in the basic Log::Agent framework).

       make($string)
           This is the creation routine.

       prepend($str)
           Prepend  supplied  string  $str  to  the original string (given at creation time), at the tail of all
           existing prepended strings.

       prepend_first($str)
           Prepend supplied string $str to the original string (given at creation time),  at  the  head  of  all
           existing prepended strings.

       stringify
           This  is  the overloaded "" operator, which returns the complete string composed of all the prepended
           strings, the original string, and all the appended strings.
