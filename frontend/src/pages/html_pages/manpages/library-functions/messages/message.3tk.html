       See the <b>options</b> manual entry for details on the standard options.

</pre><h4><b>WIDGET-SPECIFIC</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Command-Line Name:<b>-aspect</b>
       Database Name:  <b>aspect</b>
       Database Class: <b>Aspect</b>

              Specifies  a  non-negative integer value indicating desired aspect ratio for the text.  The aspect
              ratio is specified as 100*width/height.  100 means the text should be as wide as it is  tall,  200
              means the text should be twice as wide as it is tall, 50 means the text should be twice as tall as
              it  is  wide,  and  so on.  Used to choose line length for text if <b>-width</b> option is not specified.
              Defaults to 150.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-justify</b>
       Database Name:  <b>justify</b>
       Database Class: <b>Justify</b>

              Specifies how to justify lines of text.  Must be one of <b>left</b>, <b>center</b>, or <b>right</b>.  Defaults to <b>left</b>.
              This option works together with the <b>-anchor</b>, <b>-aspect</b>, <b>-padx</b>, <b>-pady</b>, and <b>-width</b> options to  provide
              a variety of arrangements of the text within the window.  The <b>-aspect</b> and <b>-width</b> options determine
              the  amount  of  screen  space  needed to display the text.  The <b>-anchor</b>, <b>-padx</b>, and <b>-pady</b> options
              determine where this rectangular area is displayed within the widget's window,  and  the  <b>-justify</b>
              option determines how each line is displayed within that rectangular region.  For example, suppose
              <b>-anchor</b>  is <b>e</b> and <b>-justify</b> is <b>left</b>, and that the message window is much larger than needed for the
              text.  The text will be displayed so that the left edges of all the lines line up  and  the  right
              edge  of  the longest line is <b>-padx</b> from the right side of the window;  the entire text block will
              be centered in the vertical span of the window.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-width</b>
       Database Name:  <b>width</b>
       Database Class: <b>Width</b>

              Specifies the length of lines in the window.  The value may have any of the  forms  acceptable  to
              <b>Tk_GetPixels</b>.  If this option has a value greater than zero then the <b>-aspect</b> option is ignored and
              the  <b>-width</b> option determines the line length.  If this option value is negative or zero, then the
              <b>-aspect</b> option determines the line length.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>message</b> command creates a new window (given by the <u>pathName</u> argument) and makes  it  into  a  message
       widget.   Additional  options,  described  above,  may  be specified on the command line or in the option
       database to configure aspects of the message such as its colors, font, text,  and  initial  relief.   The
       <b>message</b> command returns its <u>pathName</u> argument.  At the time this command is invoked, there must not exist
       a window named <u>pathName</u>, but <u>pathName</u>'s parent must exist.

       A  message  is a widget that displays a textual string.  A message widget has three special features that
       differentiate it from a <b>label</b> widget.  First, it breaks up its string into lines in order  to  produce  a
       given  aspect  ratio for the window.  The line breaks are chosen at word boundaries wherever possible (if
       not even a single word would fit on a  line,  then  the  word  will  be  split  across  lines).   Newline
       characters  in the string will force line breaks;  they can be used, for example, to leave blank lines in
       the display.

       The second feature of a message widget is justification.  The text may be displayed left-justified  (each
       line  starts  at the left side of the window), centered on a line-by-line basis, or right-justified (each
       line ends at the right side of the window).

       The third feature of a message widget is that it handles control characters and  non-printing  characters
       specially.   Tab  characters  are  replaced  with  enough  blank space to line up on the next 8-character
       boundary.  Newlines cause line breaks.   Other  control  characters  (ASCII  code  less  than  0x20)  and
       characters  not  defined in the font are displayed as a four-character sequence <b>\x</b><u>hh</u> where <u>hh</u> is the two-
       digit hexadecimal number corresponding to the character.  In the unusual case where  the  font  does  not
       contain  all  of  the characters in “0123456789abcdef\x” then control characters and undefined characters
       are not displayed at all.

</pre><h4><b>WIDGET</b> <b>COMMAND</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>message</b> command creates a new Tcl command whose name is <u>pathName</u>.  This command may be used to invoke
       various operations on the widget.  It has the following general form:
              <u>pathName</u> <u>option</u> ?<u>arg</u> <u>...</u>?
       <u>Option</u> and the <u>arg</u>s determine the exact behavior of the command.  The following commands are possible for
       message widgets:

       <u>pathName</u> <b>cget</b> <u>option</u>
              Returns the current value of the configuration option given by <u>option</u>.  <u>Option</u> may have any of the
              values accepted by the <b>message</b> command.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>configure</b> ?<u>option</u>? ?<u>value</u> <u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>...</u>?
              Query or modify the configuration options of the widget.  If no <u>option</u>  is  specified,  returns  a
              list describing all of the available options for <u>pathName</u> (see <b>Tk_ConfigureInfo</b> for information on
              the  format  of this list).  If <u>option</u> is specified with no <u>value</u>, then the command returns a list
              describing the one named option (this list will be identical to the corresponding sublist  of  the
              value  returned if no <u>option</u> is specified).  If one or more <u>option-value</u> pairs are specified, then
              the command modifies the given widget option(s) to have the given  value(s);   in  this  case  the
              command  returns  an  empty  string.   <u>Option</u>  may  have any of the values accepted by the <b>message</b>
              command.

</pre><h4><b>DEFAULT</b> <b>BINDINGS</b></h4><pre>
       When a new message is created, it has no  default  event  bindings:  messages  are  intended  for  output
       purposes only.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Tabs do not work very well with text that is centered or right-justified.  The most common result is that
       the line is justified wrong.
