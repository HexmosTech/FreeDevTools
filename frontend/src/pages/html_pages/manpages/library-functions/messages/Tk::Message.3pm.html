       Tk::Message - Create and manipulate Message widgets

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Tk::Message;
           ...
           my $message = $parent-&gt;Message(
               -text =&gt; 'somewhat long message text',
               -aspect =&gt; 100,
               -justify =&gt; 'left',
           )-&gt;pack();

</pre><h4><b>STANDARD</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-anchor</b>   <b>-font</b>     <b>-highlightthickness</b> <b>-takefocus</b> <b>-background</b>    <b>-foreground</b>    <b>-padx</b>     <b>-text</b>

       <b>-cursor</b>   <b>-highlightcolor</b>     <b>-relief</b>   <b>-width</b>

       See Tk::options for details of the standard options.

</pre><h4><b>WIDGET-SPECIFIC</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Name:     <b>aspect</b>
       Class:    <b>Aspect</b>
       Switch:   <b>-aspect</b>
           Specifies  a  non-negative  integer  value  indicating desired aspect ratio for the text.  The aspect
           ratio is specified as 100*width/height.  100 means the text should be as wide  as  it  is  tall,  200
           means the text should be twice as wide as it is tall, 50 means the text should be twice as tall as it
           is  wide,  and so on.  Used to choose line length for text if <b>width</b> option isn't specified.  Defaults
           to 150.

       Name:     <b>justify</b>
       Class:    <b>Justify</b>
       Switch:   <b>-justify</b>
           Specifies how to justify lines of text.  Must be one of <b>left</b>, <b>center</b>, or <b>right</b>.   Defaults  to  <b>left</b>.
           This  option  works  together  with  the  <b>anchor</b>,  <b>aspect</b>, <b>padX</b>, <b>padY</b>, and <b>width</b> options to provide a
           variety of arrangements of the text within the window.  The <b>aspect</b> and <b>width</b>  options  determine  the
           amount  of  screen  space  needed  to display the text.  The <b>anchor</b>, <b>padX</b>, and <b>padY</b> options determine
           where this rectangular area  is  displayed  within  the  widget's  window,  and  the  <b>justify</b>  option
           determines how each line is displayed within that rectangular region.  For example, suppose <b>anchor</b> is
           <b>e</b>  and <b>justify</b> is <b>left</b>, and that the message window is much larger than needed for the text.  The the
           text will displayed so that the left edges of all the lines line up and the right edge of the longest
           line is <b>padX</b> from the right side of the window;  the entire  text  block  will  be  centered  in  the
           vertical span of the window.

       Name:     <b>width</b>
       Class:    <b>Width</b>
       Switch:   <b>-width</b>
           Specifies  the  length  of  lines  in  the window.  The value may have any of the forms acceptable to
           <b>Tk_GetPixels</b>.  If this option has a value greater than zero then the <b>aspect</b> option is ignored and the
           <b>width</b> option determines the line length.  If this option has a value less than or equal to zero, then
           the <b>aspect</b> option determines the line length.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>Message</b> method creates a new window (given by the $widget argument)  and  makes  it  into  a  message
       widget.   Additional  options,  described  above,  may  be specified on the command line or in the option
       database to configure aspects of the message such as its colors, font, text,  and  initial  relief.   The
       <b>message</b>  command returns its $widget argument.  At the time this command is invoked, there must not exist
       a window named $widget, but $widget's parent must exist.

       A message is a widget that displays a textual string.  A  message  widget  has  three  special  features.
       First,  it  breaks up its string into lines in order to produce a given aspect ratio for the window.  The
       line breaks are chosen at word boundaries wherever possible (if not even a single word  would  fit  on  a
       line,  then  the  word  will  be  split  across lines).  Newline characters in the string will force line
       breaks;  they can be used, for example, to leave blank lines in the display.

       The second feature of a message widget is justification.  The text may be displayed left-justified  (each
       line  starts  at the left side of the window), centered on a line-by-line basis, or right-justified (each
       line ends at the right side of the window).

       The third feature of a message widget is that it handles control characters and  non-printing  characters
       specially.   Tab  characters  are  replaced  with  enough  blank space to line up on the next 8-character
       boundary.  Newlines cause line breaks.   Other  control  characters  (ASCII  code  less  than  0x20)  and
       characters  not  defined in the font are displayed as a four-character sequence <b>\x</b><u>hh</u> where <u>hh</u> is the two-
       digit hexadecimal number corresponding to the character.  In the unusual  case  where  the  font  doesn't
       contain  all of the characters in ``0123456789abcdef\x'' then control characters and undefined characters
       are not displayed at all.

</pre><h4><b>WIDGET</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>Message</b> method creates a widget  object.   This  object  supports  the  <b>configure</b>  and  <b>cget</b>  methods
       described in Tk::options which can be used to enquire and modify the options described above.  The widget
       also inherits all the methods provided by the generic Tk::Widget class.

</pre><h4><b>DEFAULT</b> <b>BINDINGS</b></h4><pre>
       When  a  new  message  is  created,  it  has  no default event bindings: messages are intended for output
       purposes only.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Tabs don't work very well with text that is centered or right-justified.  The most common result is  that
       the line is justified wrong.
