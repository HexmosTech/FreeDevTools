       Mail::Box - manage a mailbox, a folder with messages

</pre><h4><b>INHERITANCE</b></h4><pre>
        Mail::Box
          is a Mail::Reporter

        Mail::Box is extended by
          Mail::Box::Dir
          Mail::Box::File
          Mail::Box::Net

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        use Mail::Box::Manager;
        my $mgr    = Mail::Box::Manager-&gt;new;
        my $folder = $mgr-&gt;open(folder =&gt; $ENV{MAIL}, ...);
        print $folder-&gt;name;

        # Get the first message.
        print $folder-&gt;<a href="../man0/message.0.html">message</a>(0);

        # Delete the third message
        $folder-&gt;<a href="../man3/message.3.html">message</a>(3)-&gt;delete;

        # Get the number of messages in scalar context.
        my $emails = $folder-&gt;messages;

        # Iterate over the messages.
        foreach ($folder-&gt;messages) {...} # all messages
        foreach (@$folder) {...}          # all messages

        $folder-&gt;addMessage(Mail::Box::Message-&gt;new(...));

       Tied-interface:

        tie my(@inbox), 'Mail::Box::Tie::ARRAY', $inbox;

        # Four times the same:
        $inbox[3]-&gt;print;                 # tied
        $folder-&gt;[3]-&gt;print;              # overloaded folder
        $folder-&gt;<a href="../man3/message.3.html">message</a>(3)-&gt;print;       # usual
        print $folder-&gt;[3];               # overloaded message

        tie my(%inbox), 'Mail::Box::Tie::HASH', $inbox;

        # Twice times the same
        $inbox{$msgid}-&gt;print;            # tied
        $folder-&gt;messageId($msgid)-&gt;print;# usual

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       A Mail::Box::Manager creates "Mail::Box" objects.  But you already knew, because you started with the
       Mail::Box-Overview manual page.  That page is obligatory reading, sorry!

       "Mail::Box" is the base class for accessing various types of mailboxes (folders) in a uniform manner.
       The various folder types vary on how they store their messages, but when some effort those differences
       could be hidden behind a general API. For example, some folders store many messages in one single file,
       where other store each message in a separate file within the same directory.

       No object in your program will be of type "Mail::Box": it is only used as base class for the real folder
       types.  "Mail::Box" is extended by

       Extends "DESCRIPTION" in Mail::Reporter.

</pre><h4><b>OVERLOADED</b></h4><pre>
       overload: <b>""</b>
           (stringification)  The  folder  objects  stringify  to  their name.  This simplifies especially print
           statements and sorting a lot.

           example: use overloaded folder as string

            # Three lines with overloading: resp. cmp, @{}, and ""
            foreach my $folder (sort @folders)
            {   my $msgcount = @$folder;
                print "$folder contains $msgcount messages\n";
            }

       overload: <b>@{}</b>
           When the folder is used as if it is a reference  to  an  array,  it  will  show  the  messages,  like
           <b>messages()</b> and <b>message()</b> would do.

           example: use overloaded folder as array

            my $msg = $folder-&gt;[3];
            my $msg = $folder-&gt;<a href="../man3/message.3.html">message</a>(3);          # same

            foreach my $msg (@$folder) ...
            foreach my $msg ($folder-&gt;messages) ... # same

       overload: <b>cmp</b>
           (string comparison) folders are compared based on their name.  The sort rules are those of the build-
           in "cmp".

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       Extends "METHODS" in Mail::Reporter.

   <b>Constructors</b>
       Extends "Constructors" in Mail::Reporter.

       Mail::Box-&gt;<b>new</b>(%options)
           Open  a  new folder. A list of labeled %options for the mailbox can be supplied. Some options pertain
           to Mail::Box, and others are added by sub-classes.

           To control delay-loading of messages, as well the headers as the bodies, a set of *_type options  are
           available. "extract" determines whether we want delay-loading.

             trusted                             &lt;depends on folder location&gt;

           access =&gt; MODE
             Access-rights  to  the  folder.   Folders are opened for read-only (which means write-protected) by
             default! MODE can be

             'r': read-only (default)
             'a': append
             'rw': read-write
             'd': delete

             These MODE has no relation to the modes actually used to open the folder files within this  module.
             For  instance, if you specify "rw", and open the folder, only read permission on the folder-file is
             required.

             Be warned: writing a MBOX folder may create a new file to replace the old folder.  The  permissions
             and owner of the file may get changed by this.

           body_delayed_type =&gt; CLASS
             The bodies which are delayed: which will be read from file when it is needed, but not before.

           body_type =&gt; CLASS|CODE
             When messages are read from a folder-file, the headers will be stored in a "head_type" object.  For
             the  body,  however,  there  is  a  range  of  choices  about  type,  which  are  all  described in
             Mail::Message::Body.

             Specify a CODE-reference which produces the body-type to be created, or a CLASS of the  body  which
             is  used  when  the  body  is  not  a multipart or nested.  In case of a code reference, the header
             structure is passed as first argument to the routine.

             Do <u>not</u> return a delayed body-type (like "::Delayed"), because that is determined by  the  "extract"
             option while the folder is opened.  Even delayed message will require some real body type when they
             get parsed eventually.  Multiparts and nested messages are also outside your control.

             For instance:

              $mgr-&gt;open('InBox', body_type =&gt; \&amp;which_body);

              sub which_body($) {
                  my $head = shift;
                  my $size = $head-&gt;guessBodySize || 0;
                  my $type = $size &gt; 100000 ? 'File' : 'Lines';
                  "Mail::Message::Body::$type";
              }

             The    default   depends   on   the   mail-folder   type,   although   the   general   default   is
             Mail::Message::Body::Lines.  Please check the applicable manual pages.

           coerce_options =&gt; ARRAY
             Keep configuration information for messages which are  coerced  into  the  specified  folder  type,
             starting  with  a different folder type (or even no folder at all).  Messages which are coerced are
             always fully read, so this kind of information does not need to be kept here.

           create =&gt; BOOLEAN
             Automatically create the folder when it does not exist yet.  This will only  work  when  access  is
             granted for writing or appending to the folder.

             Be  careful:  you  may create a different folder type than you expect unless you explicitly specify
             Mail::Box::Manager::open(type).

           extract =&gt; INTEGER | CODE | METHOD | 'LAZY'|'ALWAYS'
             Defines when to parse (process) the content of the message.  When the header of a message is  read,
             you  may want to postpone the reading of the body: header information is more often needed than the
             body data, so why parse it always together?  The cost of delaying is not too high,  and  with  some
             luck you may never need parsing the body.

             If  you supply an INTEGER to this option, bodies of those messages with a total size less than that
             number will be extracted from the folder only when necessary.  Messages  where  the  size  (in  the
             "Content-Length"  field)  is  not  included  in  the header, like often the case for multiparts and
             nested messages, will not be extracted by default.

             If you supply a CODE reference, that subroutine is called every time that the extraction  mechanism
             wants  to  determine  whether to parse the body or not. The subroutine is called with the following
             arguments:

              CODE-&gt;(FOLDER, HEAD)

             where  FOLDER  is  a  reference  to  the   folder   we   are   reading.    HEAD   refers   to   the
             Mail::Message::Head::Complete  head of the message at hand.  The routine must return a "true" value
             (extract  now)  or  a  "false"  value  (be  lazy,  do  not  parse  yet).   Think  about  using  the
             <b>Mail::Message::Head::guessBodySize()</b> and <b>Mail::Message::guessTimestamp()</b> on the header to determine
             your choice.

             The  third  possibility  is  to  specify  the  NAME of a method.  In that case, for each message is
             called:

              FOLDER-&gt;NAME(HEAD)

             Where each component has the same meaning as described above.

             The fourth way to use this option involves constants: with "LAZY" all  messages  will  be  delayed.
             With "ALWAYS" you enforce unconditional parsing, no delaying will take place.  The latter is usuful
             when you are sure you always need all the messages in the folder.

              $folder-&gt;new(extract =&gt; 'LAZY');  # Very lazy
              $folder-&gt;new(extract =&gt; 10000);   # Less than 10kB

              # same, but implemented yourself
              $folder-&gt;new(extract =&gt; &amp;large);
              sub large($) {
                 my ($f, $head) = @_;
                 my $size = $head-&gt;guessBodySize;
                 defined $size ? $size &lt; 10000 : 1
              };

              # method call by name, useful for Mail::Box
              # extensions. The example selects all messages
              # sent by you to be loaded without delay.
              # Other messages will be delayed.
              $folder-&gt;new(extract =&gt; 'sent_by_me');
              sub Mail::Box::send_by_me($) {
                  my ($self, $header) = @_;
                  $header-&gt;get('from') =~ m/\bmy\@example.com\b/i;
              }

           field_type =&gt; CLASS
             The type of the fields to be used in a header. Must extend Mail::Message::Field.

           fix_headers =&gt; BOOLEAN
             Broken  MIME  headers  usually  stop  the parser: all lines not parsed are added to the body of the
             message.  With this flag set, the erroneous line is added to the previous header field and  parsing
             is continued.  See Mail::Box::Parser::Perl::new(fix_header_errors).

           folder =&gt; FOLDERNAME
             Which  folder  to  open (for reading or writing). When used for reading (the "access" option set to
             "r" or "a") the mailbox should already exist and must be readable. The file  or  directory  of  the
             mailbox need not exist if it is opened for reading and writing ("rw").  Write-permission is checked
             when opening an existing mailbox.

             The  folder  name  can be preceded by a "=", to indicate that it is named relative to the directory
             specified in new(folderdir).  Otherwise, it is taken as relative or absolute path.

           folderdir =&gt; DIRECTORY
             Where are folders to be found by default?  A folder-name may be preceded by a equals-sign  ("=",  a
             "mutt" convension) to explicitly state that the folder is located below the default directory.  For
             example:  in  case  "folderdir  =&gt;  '<a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a>'"  and "folder =&gt; '=abc'", the name of the folder-file is
             '/tmp/abc'.  Each folder type has already some default set.

           head_delayed_type =&gt; CLASS
             The headers which are delayed: which will be read from file when it is needed, but not before.

           head_type =&gt; CLASS
             The   type    of    header    which    contains    all    header    information.     Must    extend
             Mail::Message::Head::Complete.

           keep_dups =&gt; BOOLEAN
             Indicates  whether  or  not  duplicate messages within the folder should be retained.  A message is
             considered to be a duplicate if its message-id is the same as a previously  parsed  message  within
             the  same  folder.  If  this option is false (the default) such messages are automatically deleted,
             because it is considered useless to store the same message twice.

           lock_file =&gt; FILENAME
             The name of the file which is used to lock.  This must be specified when locking is to be used.

           lock_timeout =&gt; SECONDS
             When the lock file is older than the specified number of SECONDS, it is considered a mistake.   The
             original lock is released, and accepted for this folder.

           lock_type =&gt; CLASS|STRING|ARRAY
             The   type  of  the  locker  object.   This  may  be  the  full  name  of  a  CLASS  which  extends
             Mail::Box::Locker, or one of the known locker types "DotLock", "Flock", "FcntlLock", "Mutt", "NFS",
             "POSIX", or "NONE".  If an ARRAY is specified,  then  a  Multi  locker  is  built  which  uses  the
             specified list.

           lock_wait =&gt; SECONDS
             SECONDS to wait before failing on opening this folder.

           locker =&gt; OBJECT
             An  OBJECT  which  extends  Mail::Box::Locker, and will handle folder locking replacing the default
             lock behavior.

           log =&gt; LEVEL
           manager =&gt; MANAGER
             A reference to the object which manages this folder -- typically an Mail::Box::Manager instance.

           message_type =&gt; CLASS
             What kind of message objects are stored in this type of folder.  The default  is  constructed  from
             the  folder class followed by "::Message".  For instance, the message type for "Mail::Box::POP3" is
             "Mail::Box::POP3::Message"

           multipart_type =&gt; CLASS
             The default type of objects which are to be created for multipart message bodies.

           remove_when_empty =&gt; BOOLEAN
             Determines whether to remove the folder file or directory automatically when the write would result
             in a folder without messages nor sub-folders.

           save_on_exit =&gt; BOOLEAN
             Sets the policy for saving the folder when it is closed.  A folder  can  be  closed  manually  (see
             <b>close()</b>) or in a number of implicit ways, including on the moment the program is terminated.

           trace =&gt; LEVEL
           trusted =&gt; BOOLEAN
             Flags  whether  to  trust  the data in the folder or not.  Folders which reside in your "folderdir"
             will be trusted by default (even when the names if not specified staring with "=").  Folders  which
             are  outside  the folderdir or read from STDIN (<b>Mail::Message::Construct::read()</b>) are not trused by
             default, and require some extra checking.

             If you do not check encodings of received messages, you may print binary data to the screen,  which
             is a security risk.

   <b>The</b> <b>folder</b>
       $obj-&gt;<b>addMessage</b>($message, %options)
           Add  a  message  to  the  folder.   A  message  is usually a Mail::Box::Message object or a sub-class
           thereof.  The message shall not be in an other folder, when you use this method.  In case it is,  use
           <b>Mail::Box::Manager::moveMessage()</b> or <b>Mail::Box::Manager::copyMessage()</b> via the manager.

           Messages with id's which already exist in this folder are not added.

           BE  WARNED that message labels may get lost when a message is moved from one folder type to an other.
           An attempt is made to  translate  labels,  but  there  are  many  differences  in  interpretation  by
           applications.

            -Option--Default
             share   &lt;not used&gt;

           share =&gt; BOOLEAN
             Try  to  share  the  physical  resource  of  the current message with the indicated message.  It is
             sometimes possible to share messages between different folder  types.   When  the  sharing  is  not
             possible, than this option is simply ignored.

             Sharing  the  resource is quite dangerous, and only available for a limited number of folder types,
             at the moment only some Mail::Box::Dir folders; these file-based messages  can  be  hardlinked  (on
             platforms  that  support  it).   The link may get broken when one message is modified in one of the
             folders.... but maybe not, depending on the folder types involved.

           example:

            $folder-&gt;addMessage($msg);
            $folder-&gt;addMessages($msg1, $msg2, ...);

       $obj-&gt;<b>addMessages</b>(@messages)
           Adds a set of message objects to the open folder at once.  For some folder types this may  be  faster
           than adding them one at a time.

           example:

            $folder-&gt;addMessages($msg1, $msg2, ...);

       Mail::Box-&gt;<b>appendMessages</b>(%options)
           Append  one  or  more  messages  to  an  unopened  folder.   Usually,  this  method  is called by the
           <b>Mail::Box::Manager::appendMessage()</b>, in which case the correctness of the folder type is checked.

           For some folder types it is required to open the folder before it can be used  for  appending.   This
           can  be  fast,  but  this can also be very slow (depends on the implementation).  All %options passed
           will also be used to open the folder, if needed.

            -Option  --Default
             folder    &lt;required&gt;
             message   undef
             messages  undef
             share     &lt;false&gt;

           folder =&gt; FOLDERNAME
             The name of the folder to which the messages are to be appended.  The  folder  implementation  will
             avoid opening the folder when possible, because this is resource consuming.

           message =&gt; MESSAGE
           messages =&gt; ARRAY-OF-MESSAGES
             One  reference  to a MESSAGE or a reference to an ARRAY of MESSAGEs, which may be of any type.  The
             messages will be first coerced into the correct message type to fit in the folder, and then will be
             added to it.

           share =&gt; BOOLEAN
             Try to share physical storage of the message.  Only available for a limited number of folder types,
             otherwise no-op.

           example:

            my $message = Mail::Message-&gt;new(...);
            Mail::Box::Mbox-&gt;appendMessages
             ( folder    =&gt; '=xyz'
             , message   =&gt; $message
             , folderdir =&gt; $ENV{FOLDERS}
             );

           better:

            my Mail::Box::Manager $mgr;
            $mgr-&gt;appendMessages($message, folder =&gt; '=xyz');

       $obj-&gt;<b>close</b>(%options)
           Close the folder, which usually implies writing the changes.  This will return "false"  when  writing
           is required but fails.  Please do check this result.

           WARNING:  When  moving  messages  from one folder to another, be sure to write the destination folder
           before writing and closing the source folder.  Otherwise you may lose data if the system  crashes  or
           if there are software problems.

            -Option      --Default
             force         &lt;false&gt;
             save_deleted  false
             write         MODIFIED

           force =&gt; BOOLEAN
             Override  the  new(access) setting which was specified when the folder was opened. This option only
             has an effect if its value is TRUE. NOTE: Writing to  the  folder  may  not  be  permitted  by  the
             operating system, in which case even "force" will not help.

           save_deleted =&gt; BOOLEAN
             Do also write messages which where flagged to be deleted to their folder.  The flag for deletion is
             conserved  (when  possible),  which  means that a re-open of the folder may remove the messages for
             real.  See write(save_deleted).

           write =&gt; 'ALWAYS'|'NEVER'|'MODIFIED'
             Specifies whether the folder should be written.  As could be expected, "ALWAYS" means always  (even
             if  there  are  no  changes), "NEVER" means that changes to the folder will be lost, and "MODIFIED"
             only saves the folder if there are any changes.

           example:

            my $f = $mgr-&gt;open('spam', access =&gt; 'rw')
                or die "Cannot open spam: $!\n";

            $f-&gt;<a href="../man0/message.0.html">message</a>(0)-&gt;delete
                if $f-&gt;messages;

            $f-&gt;close
                or die "Couldn't write $f: $!\n";

       $obj-&gt;<b>copyTo</b>($folder, %options)
           Copy the folder's messages to a new folder.  The new folder may be of a different type.

            -Option       --Default
             delete_copied  &lt;false&gt;
             select         'ACTIVE'
             share          &lt;not used&gt;
             subfolders     &lt;folder type dependent&gt;

           delete_copied =&gt; BOOLEAN
             Flag the messages from the source folder to be deleted, just after it  was  copied.   The  deletion
             will only take effect when the originating folder is closed.

           select =&gt; 'ACTIVE'|'DELETED'|'ALL'|LABEL|!LABEL|FILTER
             Which messages are to be copied. See the description of <b>messages()</b> about how this works.

           share =&gt; BOOLEAN
             Try  to  share  the message between the folders.  Some Mail::Box::Dir folder types do support it by
             creating a hardlink (on UNIX/Linux).

           subfolders =&gt; BOOLEAN|'FLATTEN'|'RECURSE'
             How to handle sub-folders.  When false (0  or  "undef"),  sub-folders  are  simply  ignored.   With
             "FLATTEN",  messages  from sub-folders are included in the main copy.  "RECURSE" recursively copies
             the sub-folders as well.  By default, when the destination folder supports sub-folders "RECURSE" is
             used, otherwise "FLATTEN".  A value of true will select the default.

           example:

            my $mgr  = Mail::Box::Manager-&gt;new;
            my $imap = $mgr-&gt;open(type =&gt; 'imap', host =&gt; ...);
            my $mh   = $mgr-&gt;open(type =&gt; 'mh', folder =&gt; '/tmp/mh',
                create =&gt; 1, access =&gt; 'w');

            $imap-&gt;copyTo($mh, delete_copied =&gt; 1);
            $mh-&gt;close; $imap-&gt;close;

       $obj-&gt;<b>delete</b>(%options)
           Remove the specified folder file or folder directory (depending on the type of folder) from disk.  Of
           course, THIS IS DANGEROUS: you "may" lose data.  Returns a "true" value on success.

           WARNING: When moving messages from one folder to another, be sure to  write  the  destination  folder
           before deleting the source folder.  Otherwise you may lose data if the system crashes or if there are
           software problems.

            -Option   --Default
             recursive  1

           recursive =&gt; BOOLEAN

           example: removing an open folder

            my $folder = Mail::Box::Mbox-&gt;new(folder =&gt; 'InBox', access =&gt; 'rw');
            ... some other code ...
            $folder-&gt;delete;

           example: removing an closed folder

            my $folder = Mail::Box::Mbox-&gt;new(folder =&gt; 'INBOX', access =&gt; 'd');
            $folder-&gt;delete;

       $obj-&gt;<b>folderdir</b>( [$directory] )
           Get or set the $directory which is used to store mail-folders by default.

           example:

            print $folder-&gt;folderdir;
            $folder-&gt;folderdir("$ENV{HOME}/nsmail");

       $obj-&gt;<b>name</b>()
           Returns the name of the folder.  What the name represents depends on the actual type of mailbox used.

           example:

            print $folder-&gt;name;
            print "$folder";       # overloaded stringification

       $obj-&gt;<b>organization</b>()
           Returns how the folder is organized: as one "FILE" with many messages, a "DIRECTORY" with one message
           per file, or by a "REMOTE" server.

       $obj-&gt;<b>size</b>()
           Returns  the  size  of  the  folder in bytes, not counting in the deleted messages.  The error in the
           presented result may be as large as 10%, because the in-memory  representation  of  messages  is  not
           always the same as the size when they are written.

       $obj-&gt;<b>type</b>()
           Returns a name for the type of mail box.  This can be "mbox", "mh", "maildir", or "pop3".

       $obj-&gt;<b>update</b>(%options)
           Read new messages from the folder, which where received after opening it. This is quite dangerous and
           shouldn't be possible: folders which are open are locked. However, some applications do not use locks
           or the wrong kind of locks. This method reads the changes (not always failsafe) and incorporates them
           in the open folder administration.

           The  %options  are  extra  values  which are passed to the <b>updateMessages()</b> method which is doing the
           actual work here.

       $obj-&gt;<b>url</b>()
           Represent the folder as a URL (Universal Resource Locator) string.  You may pass such a URL as folder
           name to <b>Mail::Box::Manager::open()</b>.

           example:

            print $folder-&gt;url;
            # may result in
            #   mbox:/var/mail/markov   or
            #   pop3://user:<a href="mailto:password@pop.aol.com">password@pop.aol.com</a>:101

   <b>Folder</b> <b>flags</b>
       $obj-&gt;<b>access</b>()
           Returns the access mode of the folder, as set by new(access)

       $obj-&gt;<b>isModified</b>()
           Checks if the folder, as stored in memory, is modified.  A true value is returned  when  any  of  the
           messages is to be deleted, has changed, or messages were added after the folder was read from file.

           WARNING: this flag is not related to an external change to the folder structure on disk.  Have a look
           at <b>update()</b> for that.

       $obj-&gt;<b>modified</b>( [BOOLEAN] )
           Sets whether the folder is modified or not.

       $obj-&gt;<b>writable</b>()
           Checks whether the current folder is writable.

           example:

            $folder-&gt;addMessage($msg) if $folder-&gt;writable;

   <b>The</b> <b>messages</b>
       $obj-&gt;<b>current</b>( [$number|$message|$message_id] )
           Some  mail-readers  keep  the  <u>current</u>  message, which represents the last used message.  This method
           returns [after setting] the current message.  You may specify a $number, to specify that that message
           number is to be selected as current, or a $message/$message_id (as long as  you  are  sure  that  the
           header is already loaded, otherwise they are not recognized).

           example:

            $folder-&gt;<a href="../man0/current.0.html">current</a>(0);
            $folder-&gt;current($message);

       $obj-&gt;<b>find</b>($message_id)
           Like   <b>messageId()</b>,  this  method  searches  for  a  message  with  the  $message_id,  returning  the
           corresponding message object.  However, "find" will cause unparsed message in the folder to be parsed
           until the message-id is found.  The folder will be scanned back to front.

       $obj-&gt;<b>findFirstLabeled</b>( $label, [BOOLEAN, [$msgs]] )
           Find the first message which has this $label with the correct setting. The BOOLEAN indicates  whether
           any  true value or any false value is to be found in the ARRAY of $msgs.  By default, a true value is
           searched for.  When a message does not have the requested label, it is taken as false.

           example: looking for a labeled message

            my $current = $folder-&gt;findFirstLabeled('current');

            my $first   = $folder-&gt;findFirstLabeled(seen =&gt; 0);

            my $last    = $folder-&gt;findFirstLabeled(seen =&gt; 0,
                            [ reverse $self-&gt;messages('ACTIVE') ] )

       $obj-&gt;<b>message</b>( $index, [$message] )
           Get or set a message with on a certain index.  Messages which are flagged for deletion  are  counted.
           Negative indexes start at the end of the folder.

           example:

            my $msg = $folder-&gt;<a href="../man3/message.3.html">message</a>(3);
            $folder-&gt;<a href="../man3/message.3.html">message</a>(3)-&gt;delete;   # status changes to `deleted'
            $folder-&gt;message(3, $msg);
            print $folder-&gt;message(-1);    # last message.

       $obj-&gt;<b>messageId</b>( $message_id, [$message] )
           With  one  argument, returns the message in the folder with the specified $message_id. If a reference
           to a message object is passed as the optional second argument, the message is  first  stored  in  the
           folder,  replacing  any existing message whose message ID is $message_id. (The message ID of $message
           need not match $message_id.)

           !!WARNING!!: when the message headers are delay-parsed, the message might be in the  folder  but  not
           yet parsed into memory. In this case, use <b>find()</b> instead of messageId() if you really need a thorough
           search.   This  is  especially  the case for directory organized folders without special indexi, like
           Mail::Box::MH.

           The $message_id may still be in angles, which will be stripped.  In that case  blanks  (which  origin
           from header line folding) are removed too.  Other info around the angles will be removed too.

           example:

            my $msg = $folder-&gt;messageId('&lt;complex-message.id&gt;');
            $folder-&gt;messageId("&lt;complex-message\n.id&gt;", $msg);
            my $msg = $folder-&gt;messageId('complex-message.id');
            my $msg = $folder-&gt;messageId('garbage &lt;complex-message.id&gt; trash');

       $obj-&gt;<b>messageIds</b>()
           Returns a list of <u>all</u> message-ids in the folder, including those of messages which are to be deleted.

           For  some  folder-types  (like  MH),  this  method may cause all message-files to be read.  See their
           respective manual pages.

           example:

            foreach my $id ($folder-&gt;messageIds) {
               $folder-&gt;messageId($id)-&gt;print;
            }

       $obj-&gt;<b>messages</b>( &lt;'ALL'|$range|'ACTIVE'|'DELETED'|$label| !$label|$filter&gt; )
           Returns multiple messages from the folder.  The default is  "ALL"  which  will  return  (as  expected
           maybe)  all  the  messages in the folder.  The "ACTIVE" flag will return the messages not flagged for
           deletion.  This is the opposite of "DELETED", which returns all messages from the folder  which  will
           be deleted when the folder is closed.

           You  may  also specify a $range: two numbers specifying begin and end index in the array of messages.
           Negative indexes count from the end of the folder.  When an index is out-of-range, the returned  list
           will be shorter without complaints.

           Everything  else than the predefined names is seen as labels.  The messages which have that label set
           will be returned.  When the sequence starts with an  exclamation  mark  (!),  the  search  result  is
           reversed.

           For  more complex searches, you can specify a $filter, which is simply a code reference.  The message
           is passed as only argument.

           example:

            foreach my $message ($folder-&gt;messages) {...}
            foreach my $message (@$folder) {...}

            # twice the same
            my @messages   = $folder-&gt;messages;
            my @messages   = $folder-&gt;messages('ALL');

            # Selection based on a range (begin, end)
            my $subset     = $folder-&gt;messages(10,-8);

            # twice the same:
            my @not_deleted= grep {not $_-&gt;isDeleted}
                                $folder-&gt;messages;
            my @not_deleted= $folder-&gt;messages('ACTIVE');

            # scalar context the number of messages
            my $nr_of_msgs = $folder-&gt;messages;

            # third message, via overloading
            $folder-&gt;[2];

            # Selection based on labels
            $mgr-&gt;moveMessages($spam, $inbox-&gt;message('spam'));
            $mgr-&gt;moveMessages($archive, $inbox-&gt;message('seen'));

       $obj-&gt;<b>nrMessages</b>(%options)
           Simply calls <b>messages()</b> in scalar context to return a count instead of  the  messages  itself.   Some
           people  seem  to understand this better.  Note that <b>nrMessages()</b> will default to returning a count of
           "ALL" messages in the folder, including both "ACTIVE" and "DELETED".

           The %options are passed to (and explained in) <b>messages()</b>.

       $obj-&gt;<b>scanForMessages</b>($message, $message_ids, $timespan, $window)
           You start with a $message, and are looking for a set of  messages  which  are  related  to  it.   For
           instance,  messages  which appear in the 'In-Reply-To' and 'Reference' header fields of that message.
           These messages are known by their $message_ids and you want to find them in the folder.

           When all message-ids are known, then looking-up messages is simple: they are found in  a  plain  hash
           using  <b>messageId()</b>.  But Mail::Box is lazy where it can, so many messages may not have been read from
           file yet, and that's the preferred situation, because that saves time and memory.

           It is not smart to search for the messages from front to back in the folder:  the  chances  are  much
           higher that related message reside closely to each other.  Therefore, this method starts scanning the
           folder from the specified $message, back to the front of the folder.

           The  $timespan  can  be used to terminate the search based on the time enclosed in the message.  When
           the constant string "EVER" is used as $timespan, then the search is not limited  by  that.   When  an
           integer  is  specified,  it  will be used as absolute time in time-ticks as provided by your platform
           dependent "time" function.  In other cases, it is  passed  to  <b>timespan2seconds()</b>  to  determine  the
           threshold as time relative to the message's time.

           The  $window  is  used to limit the search in number of messages to be scanned as integer or constant
           string "ALL".

           Returned are the message-ids which were not found during the scan.  Be warned that a message-id could
           already be known and therefore not found: check that first.

           example: scanning through a folder for a message

            my $refs   = $msg-&gt;get('References') or return;
            my @msgids = $ref =~ m/\&lt;([^&gt;]+\&gt;/g;
            my @failed = $folder-&gt;scanForMessages($msg, \@msgids, '3 days', 50);

   <b>Sub-folders</b>
       $obj-&gt;<b>listSubFolders</b>(%options)
       Mail::Box-&gt;<b>listSubFolders</b>(%options)
           List the names of all sub-folders to this folder, not recursively  decending.   Use  these  names  as
           argument to <b>openSubFolder()</b>, to get access to that folder.

           For MBOX folders, sub-folders are simulated.

             Should  all  returned foldernames be checked to be sure that they are of the right type?  Each sub-
             folder may need to be opened to check this, with a folder type dependent  penalty  (in  some  cases
             very expensive).

           folder =&gt; FOLDERNAME
             The folder whose sub-folders should be listed.

           folderdir =&gt; DIRECTORY
           skip_empty =&gt; BOOL
             Shall  empty  folders  (folders  which  currently  do not contain any messages) be included?  Empty
             folders are not useful to open, but may be useful to save to.

           example:

            my $folder = $mgr-&gt;open('=in/new');
            my @subs = $folder-&gt;listSubFolders;

            my @subs = Mail::Box::Mbox-&gt;listSubFolders(folder =&gt; '=in/new');
            my @subs = Mail::Box::Mbox-&gt;listSubFolders; # toplevel folders.

       $obj-&gt;<b>nameOfSubFolder</b>( $subname, [$parentname] )
       Mail::Box-&gt;<b>nameOfSubFolder</b>( $subname, [$parentname] )
           Returns the constructed name of the folder with NAME, which is a sub-folder of this current one.  You
           have either to call this method as instance method, or specify a $parentname.

           example: how to get the name of a subfolder

            my $sub = Mail::Box::Mbox-&gt;nameOfSubfolder('xyz', 'abc');
            print $sub;                        # abc/xyz

            my $f = Mail::Box::Mbox-&gt;new(folder =&gt; 'abc');
            print $f-&gt;nameOfSubfolder('xyz');  # abc/xyz

            my $sub = Mail::Box::Mbox-&gt;nameOfSubfolder('xyz', undef);
            print $sub;                        # xyz

       $obj-&gt;<b>openRelatedFolder</b>(%options)
           Open a folder (usually a sub-folder) with the same options as this one.  If there is a folder manager
           in use, it will be informed about this new folder.  %options overrule the options  which  where  used
           for the folder this method is called upon.

       $obj-&gt;<b>openSubFolder</b>($subname, %options)
           Open (or create, if it does not exist yet) a new subfolder in an existing folder.

           example:

            my $folder = Mail::Box::Mbox-&gt;new(folder =&gt; '=Inbox');
            my $sub    = $folder-&gt;openSubFolder('read');

       $obj-&gt;<b>topFolderWithMessages</b>()
       Mail::Box-&gt;<b>topFolderWithMessages</b>()
           Some folder types can have messages in the top-level folder, some other can't.

   <b>Internals</b>
       $obj-&gt;<b>coerce</b>($message, %options)
           Coerce  the  $message  to  be  of  the  correct  type  to  be  placed in the folder.  You can specify
           Mail::Internet and MIME::Entity objects here: they will be  translated  into  Mail::Message  messages
           first.

       $obj-&gt;<b>create</b>($foldername, %options)
       Mail::Box-&gt;<b>create</b>($foldername, %options)
           Create  a  folder.   If the folder already exists, it will be left unchanged.  The folder is created,
           but  not  opened!   If  you  want  to  open  a  file  which  may  need  to  be  created,   then   use
           <b>Mail::Box::Manager::open()</b> with the create flag, or Mail::Box::new(create).

            -Option   --Default
             folderdir  undef

           folderdir =&gt; DIRECTORY
             When  the foldername is preceded by a "=", the "folderdir" directory will be searched for the named
             folder.

       $obj-&gt;<b>determineBodyType</b>($message, $head)
           Determine which kind of body will be created for this message when reading the folder initially.

       Mail::Box-&gt;<b>foundIn</b>( [$foldername], %options )
           Determine if the specified folder is of the type handled by the folder class. This method is extended
           by each folder sub-type.

           The $foldername specifies the name of the folder, as is specified by the application.   You  need  to
           specified the "folder" option when you skip this first argument.

           %options  is  a  list  of extra information for the request.  Read the documentation for each type of
           folder for type specific options, but each folder class will at least support the "folderdir" option:

            -Option   --Default
             folderdir  undef

           folderdir =&gt; DIRECTORY
             The location where the folders of this class are stored by default.  If the user specifies  a  name
             starting with a "=", that indicates that the folder is to be found in this default DIRECTORY.

           example:

            Mail::Box::Mbox-&gt;foundIn('=markov',
                folderdir =&gt; "$ENV{HOME}/Mail");
            Mail::Box::MH-&gt;foundIn(folder =&gt; '=markov');

       $obj-&gt;<b>lineSeparator</b>( [&lt;STRING|'CR'|'LF'|'CRLF'&gt;] )
           Returns  the  character  or  characters  used  to separate lines in the folder file, optionally after
           setting it to STRING, or one of the constants.  The first line of the folder sets the default.

           UNIX uses a LF character, Mac a CR, and Windows  both  a  CR  and  a  LF.   Each  separator  will  be
           represented  by  a  "\n"  within  your  program.   However, when processing platform foreign folders,
           complications appear.  Think about the "Size" field in the header.

           When the separator is changed, the whole folder me be rewritten.  Although, that may not be required.

       $obj-&gt;<b>locker</b>()
           Returns the locking object.

       $obj-&gt;<b>read</b>(%options)
           Read messages from the folder into memory.  The %options are folder specific.   Do  not  call  read()
           yourself:  it will be called for you when you open the folder via the manager or instantiate a folder
           object directly.

           NOTE: if you are copying messages from one folder to another, use <b>addMessages()</b> instead of read().

           example:

            my $mgr = Mail::Box::Manager-&gt;new;
            my $folder = $mgr-&gt;open('InBox');             # implies read
            my $folder = Mail::Box::Mbox-&gt;new(folder =&gt; 'Inbox'); # same

       $obj-&gt;<b>readMessages</b>(%options)
           Called by <b>read()</b> to actually read the messages from one specific folder type.  The  <b>read()</b>  organizes
           the general activities.

           The  %options  are  "trusted",  "head_type",  "field_type",  "message_type", "body_delayed_type", and
           "head_delayed_type" as defined by the folder at hand.  The defaults are the constructor defaults (see
           <b>new()</b>).

       $obj-&gt;<b>storeMessage</b>($message)
           Store the message in the folder without the checks as performed by <b>addMessage()</b>.

       $obj-&gt;<b>toBeThreaded</b>($messages)
           The specified message is ready to be removed from a thread.  This will be  passed  on  to  the  mail-
           manager, which keeps an overview on which thread-detection objects are floating around.

       $obj-&gt;<b>toBeUnthreaded</b>($messages)
           The  specified  message  is  ready  to  be included in a thread.  This will be passed on to the mail-
           manager, which keeps an overview on which thread-detection objects are floating around.

       $obj-&gt;<b>updateMessages</b>(%options)
           Called by <b>update()</b> to read messages which arrived in the folder  after  it  was  opened.   Sometimes,
           external  applications dump messages in a folder without locking (or using a different lock than your
           application does).

           Although this is quite a dangerous, it only fails when a folder  is  updated  (reordered  or  message
           removed) at exactly the same time as new messages arrive.  These collisions are sparse.

           The options are the same as for <b>readMessages()</b>.

       $obj-&gt;<b>write</b>(%options)
           Write the data to disk.  The folder (a "true" value) is returned if successful.  Deleted messages are
           transformed into destroyed messages: their memory is freed.

           WARNING:  When  moving  messages  from  one  folder  to  another,  be  sure to write (or <b>close()</b>) the
           destination folder before writing (or closing) the source folder: otherwise you may lose data if  the
           system crashes or if there are software problems.

           To  write  a  folder  to  a  different  file,  you  must first create a new folder, then move all the
           messages, and then write or <b>close()</b> that new folder.

            -Option      --Default
             force         &lt;false&gt;
             save_deleted  &lt;false&gt;

           force =&gt; BOOLEAN
             Override write-protection with new(access) while opening the  folder  (whenever  possible,  it  may
             still be blocked by the operating system).

           save_deleted =&gt; BOOLEAN
             Do also write messages which where flagged to be deleted to their folder.  The flag for deletion is
             conserved  (when  possible),  which  means that a re-open of the folder may remove the messages for
             real.  See close(save_deleted).

       $obj-&gt;<b>writeMessages</b>(%options)
           Called by <b>write()</b> to actually write  the  messages  from  one  specific  folder  type.   The  "write"
           organizes  the  general  activities.   All  options to <b>write()</b> are passed to "writeMessages" as well.
           Besides, a few extra are added by "write" itself.

            -Option  --Default
             messages  &lt;required&gt;

           messages =&gt; ARRAY
             The messages to be written, which is a sub-set of all messages in the current folder.

   <b>Other</b> <b>methods</b>
       $obj-&gt;<b>timespan2seconds</b>($time)
       Mail::Box-&gt;<b>timespan2seconds</b>($time)
           $time is a string, which starts with a float, and then one  of  the  words  'hour',  'hours',  'day',
           'days', 'week', or 'weeks'.  For instance: '1 hour' or '4 weeks'.

</pre><h4><b>DETAILS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Different</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>folders</b>
       In general, there are three classes of folders: those who  group  messages  per  file,  those  who  group
       messages  in a directory, and those do not provide direct access to the message data.  These folder types
       are each based on a different base class.

       •   File based folders Mail::Box::File

           File based folders maintain a folder (a set of messages) in one single file.  The advantage  is  that
           your  folder  has  only  one  single file to access, which speeds-up things when all messages must be
           accessed at once.

           One of the main disadvantages over directory based folders is that you have to construct  some  means
           to  keep  all message apart.  For instance MBOX adds a message separator line between the messages in
           the file, and this line can cause confusion with the message's contents.

           Where access to all messages at once is faster in file based folders, access to a single  message  is
           (much)  slower,  because the whole folder must be read.  However, in directory based folders you have
           to figure-out which message you need, which may be a hassle as well.

           Examples of file based folders are MBOX, DBX, and NetScape.

       •   Directory based folders Mail::Box::Dir

           In stead of collecting multiple messages in one file, you can also put each  message  in  a  separate
           file and collect those files in a directory to represent a folder.

           The main disadvantages of these folders are the enormous amount of tiny files you usually get in your
           file-system.  It is extremely slow to search through your whole folder, because many files have to be
           opened to do so.

           The  best  feature  of this organization is that each message is kept exactly as it was received, and
           can be processed with external scripts as well: you do not need any mail user agent (MUA).

           Examples of directory organized folders are MH, Maildir, EMH and XMH.

       •   Network (external) folders Mail::Box::Net

           Where both types described before provide direct access to the message data,  maintain  these  folder
           types  the message data for you: you have to request for messages or parts of them.  These folders do
           not have a filename, file-system privileges and system locking to worry about, but typically  require
           a hostname, folder and message IDs, and authorization.

           Examples of these folder types are the popular POP and IMAP, and database oriented message storage.

   <b>Available</b> <b>folder</b> <b>types</b>
       •   Mail::Box::Dbx (read only)

           Dbx  files are created by Outlook Express. Using the external (optional) Mail::Transport::Dbx module,
           you can read these folders, even when you are running MailBox on a UNIX/Linux platform.

           Writing and deleting messages is not supported by the library, and therefore  not  by  MailBox.  Read
           access is enough to do folder conversions, for instance.

       •   Mail::Box::IMAP4 (partially)

           The  IMAP  protocol  is  very complex.  Some parts are implemented to create (sub-optimal but usable)
           IMAP clients.  Besides, there are also some parts for  IMAP  servers  present.   The  most  important
           lacking feature is support for encrypted connections.

       •   Mail::Box::Maildir

           Maildir  folders  have  a  directory  for each folder.  A folder directory contains "tmp", "new", and
           "cur" sub-directories, each containing messages with a different purpose.  Files  with  new  messages
           are created in "tmp", then moved to "new" (ready to be accepted).  Later, they are moved to the "cur"
           directory  (accepted).   Each message is one file with a name starting with timestamp.  The name also
           contains flags about the status of the message.

           Maildir folders can not be used on Windows by reason of file-name limitations on that platform.

       •   Mail::Box::Mbox

           A folder type in which all related messages are stored in one file.  This is  a  very  common  folder
           type for UNIX.

       •   Mail::Box::MH

           This  folder  creates  a  directory for each folder, and a message is one file inside that directory.
           The message files are numbered sequentially on order of  arrival.   A  special  ".mh_sequences"  file
           maintains flags about the messages.

       •   Mail::Box::POP3 (read/delete only)

           POP3 is a protocol which can be used to retrieve messages from a remote system.  After the connection
           to  a  POP  server  is  made,  the  messages can be looked at and removed as if they are on the local
           system.

       •   Mail::Box::Netzwert

           The Netzwert folder type is optimized for mailbox handling on a cluster of systems with a shared  NFS
           storage.  The code is not released under GPL (yet)

       Other  folder  types  are  on  the (long) wishlist to get implemented.  Please, help implementing more of
       them.

   <b>Folder</b> <b>class</b> <b>implementation</b>
       The  class  structure  of  folders  is   very   close   to   that   of   messages.    For   instance,   a
       Mail::Box::File::Message relates to a Mail::Box::File folder.  The folder types are:

                           Mail::Box::Netzwert
        Mail::Box::Mbox   | Mail::Box::Maildir Mail::Box::POP3
        |  Mail::Box::Dbx | | Mail::Box::MH    |  Mail::Box::IMAP4
        |  |               | | |                 |  |
        |  |               | | |                 |  |
        Mail::Box::File   Mail::Box::Dir       Mail::Box::Net
              |                  |                   |
              `--------------.   |   .---------------'
                             |   |   |
                             Mail::Box
                                 |
                                 |
                           Mail::Reporter (general base class)

       By  far  most folder features are implemented in Mail::Box, so available to all folder types.  Sometimes,
       features which appear in only some of the folder types are simulated for folders  that  miss  them,  like
       sub-folder support for MBOX.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       Warning: Changes not written to read-only folder $self.
           You have opened the folder read-only --which is the default set by new(access)--, made modifications,
           and  now  want  to  close it.  Set close(force) if you want to overrule the access mode, or close the
           folder with close(write) set to "NEVER".

       Error: Copying failed for one message.
           For some reason, for instance disc full, removed by  external  process,  or  read-protection,  it  is
           impossible to copy one of the messages.  Copying will proceed for the other messages.

       Error: Destination folder $name is not writable.
           The  folder where the messages are copied to is not opened with write access (see new(access)).  This
           has no relation with write permission to the folder which is controlled by your operating system.

       Warning: Different messages with id $msgid
           The message id is discovered more than once within the same folder, but the content  of  the  message
           seems to be different.  This should not be possible: each message must be unique.

       Error: Folder $name is opened read-only
           You  can  not  write  to  this  folder  unless  you  have  opened  the folder to write or append with
           new(access), or the "force" option is set true.

       Error: Folder $name not deleted: not writable.
           The folder must be opened with write access via new(access), otherwise removing it will  be  refused.
           So, you may have write-access according to the operating system, but that will not automatically mean
           that this "delete" method permits you to.  The reverse remark is valid as well.

       Error: Invalid timespan '$timespan' specified.
           The string does not follow the strict rules of the time span syntax which is permitted as parameter.

       Warning: Message-id '$msgid' does not contain a domain.
           According  to  the  RFCs,  message-ids  need to contain a unique random part, then an "@", and then a
           domain name.  This is made to avoid the creation of two messages  with  the  same  id.   The  warning
           emerges when the "@" is missing from the string.

       Error: No folder name specified.
           You  did not specify the name of a folder to be opened.  Use the new(folder) option or set the "MAIL"
           environment variable.

       Error: Package $package does not implement $method.
           Fatal error: the specific package (or one of its superclasses) does not implement this  method  where
           it  should.  This  message means that some other related classes do implement this method however the
           class at hand does not.  Probably you should investigate this and probably inform the author  of  the
