</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       mq_receive, mq_timedreceive — receive a message from a message queue (<b>REALTIME</b>)

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/mqueue.h">mqueue.h</a>&gt;

       ssize_t mq_receive(mqd_t <u>mqdes</u>, char *<u>msg_ptr</u>, size_t <u>msg_len</u>,
           unsigned *<u>msg_prio</u>);

       #include &lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/mqueue.h">mqueue.h</a>&gt;
       #include &lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/time.h">time.h</a>&gt;

       ssize_t mq_timedreceive(mqd_t <u>mqdes</u>, char *restrict <u>msg_ptr</u>,
           size_t <u>msg_len</u>, unsigned *restrict <u>msg_prio</u>,
           const struct timespec *restrict <u>abstime</u>);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>mq_receive</u>()  function  shall receive the oldest of the highest priority message(s) from the message
       queue specified by <u>mqdes</u>.  If the size of the buffer in bytes, specified by the <u>msg_len</u> argument, is less
       than the <u>mq_msgsize</u> attribute of the message  queue,  the  function  shall  fail  and  return  an  error.
       Otherwise,  the  selected  message shall be removed from the queue and copied to the buffer pointed to by
       the <u>msg_ptr</u> argument.

       If the value of <u>msg_len</u> is greater than {SSIZE_MAX}, the result is implementation-defined.

       If the argument <u>msg_prio</u> is not NULL, the priority of  the  selected  message  shall  be  stored  in  the
       location referenced by <u>msg_prio</u>.

       If  the  specified  message  queue  is  empty  and O_NONBLOCK is not set in the message queue description
       associated with <u>mqdes</u>, <u>mq_receive</u>() shall block until a message is enqueued on the message queue or until
       <u>mq_receive</u>() is interrupted by a signal. If more than one thread is waiting to receive a message  when  a
       message  arrives  at  an  empty queue and the Priority Scheduling option is supported, then the thread of
       highest priority that has been waiting the longest shall be selected to receive the  message.  Otherwise,
       it  is unspecified which waiting thread receives the message. If the specified message queue is empty and
       O_NONBLOCK is set in the message queue description associated with <u>mqdes</u>, no  message  shall  be  removed
       from the queue, and <u>mq_receive</u>() shall return an error.

       The <u>mq_timedreceive</u>() function shall receive the oldest of the highest priority messages from the message
       queue  specified  by  <u>mqdes</u>  as  described  for the <u>mq_receive</u>() function. However, if O_NONBLOCK was not
       specified when the message queue was opened via the <u>mq_open</u>() function, and  no  message  exists  on  the
       queue  to satisfy the receive, the wait for such a message shall be terminated when the specified timeout
       expires. If O_NONBLOCK is set, this function is equivalent to <u>mq_receive</u>().

       The timeout expires when the absolute time specified by <u>abstime</u> passes, as measured by the clock on which
       timeouts are based (that is, when the value of that clock equals or exceeds <u>abstime</u>), or if the  absolute
       time specified by <u>abstime</u> has already been passed at the time of the call.

       The  timeout  shall  be  based  on  the CLOCK_REALTIME clock.  The resolution of the timeout shall be the
       resolution of the clock on which it is based. The <u>timespec</u> argument is defined in the <u>&lt;time.h&gt;</u> header.

       Under no circumstance shall the operation fail with a timeout if  a  message  can  be  removed  from  the
       message  queue immediately. The validity of the <u>abstime</u> parameter need not be checked if a message can be
       removed from the message queue immediately.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       Upon successful completion, the <u>mq_receive</u>() and <u>mq_timedreceive</u>() functions shall return the  length  of
       the  selected  message  in  bytes  and the message shall be removed from the queue. Otherwise, no message
       shall be removed from the queue, the functions shall return a value of -1, and set <u>errno</u> to indicate  the
       error.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       These functions shall fail if:

       <b>EAGAIN</b> O_NONBLOCK  was  set  in  the message description associated with <u>mqdes</u>, and the specified message
              queue is empty.

       <b>EBADF</b>  The <u>mqdes</u> argument is not a valid message queue descriptor open for reading.

       <b>EMSGSIZE</b>
              The specified message buffer size, <u>msg_len</u>, is less than the message size attribute of the message
              queue.

       <b>EINTR</b>  The <u>mq_receive</u>() or <u>mq_timedreceive</u>() operation was interrupted by a signal.

       <b>EINVAL</b> The process or thread would have blocked, and the <u>abstime</u> parameter specified a nanoseconds  field
              value less than zero or greater than or equal to 1000 million.

       <b>ETIMEDOUT</b>
              The  O_NONBLOCK  flag was not set when the message queue was opened, but no message arrived on the
              queue before the specified timeout expired.

       These functions may fail if:

       <b>EBADMSG</b>
              The implementation has detected a data corruption problem with the message.
