       Tk::tkvars - Variables used or set by Tk

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The following perl variables are either set or used by Tk at various times in its execution. (For a list
       of variables used by perl see perlvar.)

       <b>$Tk::library</b>
           This  variable  holds  the  file  name  for  a directory containing the modules related to Tk.  These
           modules include an initialization file that is normally processed whenever a  Tk  application  starts
           up, plus other files containing procedures that implement default behaviors for widgets.  The initial
           value of <b>$Tk::library</b> is set when Tk is added to an interpreter;  this is done by searching searching
           for a directory named Tk in the directory where the file <u>Tk.pm</u>, or the first directory <u>Tk</u> in @INC.

           The  <b>TK_LIBRARY</b>  environment variable used by Tcl/Tk is not supported by perl/Tk.  Please use @INC to
           change where modules are searched.

           <b>Note:</b> This is Tcl remnant. With perl it makes more sense to use @INC and %INC).

       <b>$Tk::patchLevel</b>
           Contains a decimal integer giving the current patch level for Tk.  The patch level is incremented for
           each new release or patch, and it uniquely identifies an official version of Tk.

           <b>Note:</b> this is Tcl remnant. With perl it makes more sense to use <b>$Tk::VERSION</b> described below.

       <b>$Tk::strictMotif</b>
           This variable is set to zero by default.  If an application sets it  to  one,  then  Tk  attempts  to
           adhere as closely as possible to Motif look-and-feel standards.  For example, active elements such as
           buttons and scrollbar sliders will not change color when the pointer passes over them.

       <b>$Tk::VERSION</b>
           The  variable holds the current version number of the perl/Tk release in the form <u>major</u>.<u>minor</u>.  <u>Major</u>
           and <u>minor</u> are integers.

           The <u>major</u> version number shows on which Tcl/Tk release perl/Tk is based.  E.g., <b>402</b>  means  based  on
           Tcls  Tk 4.2.  (Patchlevel of Tcls Tk are not incorporated because perl/Tk tended  to be ``<u>ahead</u>'' of
           them on some fixes and behind on others.  The first digest of the major version number  increases  in
           any Tk release that includes changes that are not backward compatible (i.e. whenever existing perl/Tk
           applications and scripts may have to change to work with the new release).

           The  <u>minor</u>  version depends on perl/Tk only. It uses the 'even'='stable', 'odd'='experimental' scheme
           that linux uses:

            .0xx  - inherently 'alpha'
            .1xx  - experimental 'beta'
            .2xx  - stable
            .3xx  - experimental
            .4xx  - stable
            ...

           The minor version number increases with each new release  of  Tk,  except  that  it  resets  to  zero
           whenever the major version number changes.

       <b>$Tk::version</b>
           The  variable  holds the current version number of the Tk library in the form <u>major</u>.<u>minor</u>.  <u>Major</u> and
           <u>minor</u> are integers.  The major version number increases in any Tk release that includes changes  that
           are not backward compatible (i.e. whenever existing Tk applications and scripts may have to change to
           work  with  the new release).  The minor version number increases with each new release of Tk, except
           that it resets to zero whenever the major version number changes.

           <b>Note:</b> this is Tcl remnant.  With perl it makes more sense to use <b>$Tk::VERSION</b> described above.
