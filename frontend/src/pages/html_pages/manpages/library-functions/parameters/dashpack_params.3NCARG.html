</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Dashpack_params - This document briefly describes all Dashpack parameters.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Dashpack has twenty internal parameters that affect what it does.  The current value of a parameter may
       be retrieved by calling one of the routines DPGETC, DPGETI or DPGETR.  A parameter may be given a new
       value by calling one of the routines DPSETC, DPSETI, or DPSETR.

       The Dashpack parameter descriptions appear below in alphabetical order. Each description begins with a
       line giving the parameter name and the intrinsic FORTRAN type of the parameter.

       'CRB' - Character

              Character  Representing  a  Break:  the single character that is to be used in a label string in a
              character dash pattern to represent a break point in the label string. (Each piece  of  the  label
              string  is  written  using a separate call to PLCHHQ, PLCHMQ, or PLCHLQ; the effect is to make the
              label "bend" with the curve that it labels.)

              The default value of 'CRB' is a vertical bar.

       'CRG' - Character

              Character Representing a Gap: the single character that is to be used in a character dash  pattern
              to represent a gap (of width 'WOG') in the curve.

              The default value of 'CRG' is an underscore.

       'CRS' - Character

              Character  Representing  a  Solid:  the  single  character  that is to be used in a character dash
              pattern to represent a solid section (of width 'WOS') of the curve.

              The default value of 'CRS' is a dollar sign.

       'DPL' - Integer

              Dash Pattern Length: the length of the character-string value of the internal parameter 'DPT',  as
              set  by  DPSETC  or  by a subsequent call to DPSETI or DPSETR.  Calling DPSETC with first argument
              'DPT' sets both 'DPT', which is the character dash pattern, and 'DPL', which is its length;  'DPL'
              can  later  be  reset  (normally to a smaller value) by a subsequent call to DPSETI or DPSETR with
              first argument 'DPL', thus requesting the use of a different number of characters of the specified
              dash pattern.

              The value of 'DPL' must be between 1 and 256.

              The default value is 16.

       'DPS' - Integer

              Dash Pattern Selector: selects the dash pattern to be used.

              A negative value of 'DPS' says that the integer dash pattern (as specified by a call to DPSETI  or
              DPSETR with first argument 'DPT') is to be used.  If the absolute value is "n", then the low-order
              "n"  bits  of  the  integer are used as the dash pattern.  No more than 32 bits of an integer dash
              pattern may be used; using more than 24 may be a problem on some systems.

              A positive value of 'DPS' says that the current character dash pattern (as specified by a call  to
              DPSETC  with first argument 'DPT') is to be used; 'DPS' = 0 says to use the first 'DPL' characters
              of the dash pattern, while 'DPS' &gt; 0 says to use the first 'DPS' characters of the  dash  pattern.
              No more than 256 characters of a character dash pattern may be used.

              The value of 'DPS' must be between -32 and +256.

              The default value is 0.

       'DPT' - Character or Integer

              Dash  PaTtern:  one  of  the current dash patterns. (In a call to DPSETC or DPGETC, the name 'DPT'
              refers to the current character-string dash pattern, but in a call to DPSETI, DPGETI,  DPSETR,  or
              DPGETR,  it  refers  to  the current integer dash pattern.  Which of these is actually in use at a
              given time is specified by the value of the internal parameter 'DPS'.)

              In an integer dash pattern, 1 bits represent solids and 0 bits represent gaps.  No  more  than  32
              bits  of  an  integer  dash  pattern may be used; using more than 24 bits may be a problem on some
              systems.

              A character dash pattern is a string of 256 or fewer characters; in such a string, occurrences  of
              the  characters  specified by the values of 'CRG' and 'CRS' specify gaps and solids, respectively.
              Other characters in the dash pattern form label strings to be written along a curve.  Within  each
              complete  label  string of a character dash pattern, the character specified by the value of 'CRB'
              may be used to specify "break points" at which  the  label  string  may  be  broken  into  smaller
              substrings.  Alternatively,  the  single-character  flag 'SCF' may be set non-zero to say that the
              label string may be broken into single-character substrings. Since each such substring is  written
              by  a  separate  call to PLCHHQ, PLCHMQ, or PLCHLQ, the effect of breaking up a label string is to
              make the label "bend" with the curve.

              The default character dash pattern consists of sixteen dollar signs, and the default integer  dash
              pattern is "65535", which has sixteen low-order 1s.

       'EPS' - Real

              EPSilon: says how far apart two points have to be (in X or Y, in the fractional coordinate system)
              in order to be considered separate points by the smoothing routine DPSMTH.

              The value of 'EPS' must be greater than or equal to zero.

              The default value is .000001.

       'LS1' - Real

              Label Spacing parameter 1: specifies how much extra gap space to leave at the beginning and end of
              a label. Giving 'LS1' a non-zero value helps to ensure that there will be a sufficiently large gap
              to (for example) prevent a leading minus sign from appearing to be part of the line.

              The  value  of  'LS1'  is  given as a multiple of the value of the parameter 'WOC' (the width of a
              character); it must not be less than zero nor greater than 10.

              The default value is .5.

       'LS2' - Real

              Label Spacing parameter 2: specifies how much extra gap space to leave for each piece of a  broken
              label.  When  break  characters  are  used  or the single-character flag 'SCF' is turned on, 'LS2'
              determines the spacing of the characters along the line.

              The value of 'LS2' is given as a multiple of the value of the parameter  'WOC'  (the  width  of  a
              character); it must not be less than zero nor greater than 10.

              The default value is 0.

       'LTL' - Integer

              Line  Through Label: a flag that says whether or not each label substring specified by a character
              dash pattern is to be written in a gap ('LTL' = 0) or just on top of the curve ('LTL'  =  1).  The
              latter is most effective if the line is one color and the labels are another color.

              The value of 'LTL' must be either 0 or 1.

              The default value is 0.

       'MFS' - Real

              Multiplier  for  First  Solid:  a  real multiplier for the length of an initial solid portion of a
              curve drawn by DASHPACK. The object of using this is to make it possible to slightly offset labels
              on curves that are very nearly parallel to one another (as can happen, for example,  when  drawing
              contour lines).

              The value of 'MFS' must be greater than or equal to zero.

              The default value is 1.

       'PCF' - Integer

              PlotChar  Flag: says which PLOTCHAR routine is to be called to draw character strings. The value 0
              says to call PLCHHQ, the value 1 says to call PLCHMQ, and the value 2 says to call PLCHLQ.

              The value of 'PCF" must be either 0, 1, or 2.

              The default value is 0.

       'SAF' - Real

              String Angle Flag: says how labels are to be oriented.

              If 'SAF' = 0, labels are written along a curve in the direction in which the curve is being drawn.

              If 'SAF' is negative, labels are written in the direction ABS('SAF') degrees,  but  this  is  done
              only  if  'LTL' is non-zero; otherwise, the code behaves as if 'SAF' were zero: labels are written
              in the direction of the curve.

              If 'SAF' is greater than zero, labels are written along the curve, but the angle  is  adjusted  by
              adding  multiples  of  180  degrees so that the resulting angle lies in the range from 'SAF'-90 to
              'SAF'+90 degrees.

              If a label string is broken into substrings (either because there are "break" characters in it  or
              because  'SCF'  is  non-zero),  a negative value of 'SAF' will be treated as a zero value; a value
              greater than zero may cause the entire label to be written in the  opposite  direction  along  the
              curve if that ensures that more characters of the label will be written at angles between 'SAF'-90
              and 'SAF'+90 degrees.

              Generally,  when  'SAF' is non-zero, it is either -360 or +360, which has the effect of making the
              labels as nearly upright as possible on the frame.

              The value of 'SAF" must be in the range from -360 to +360.

              The default value is 360.

       'SBF' - Integer

              String Buffering Flag: a flag that says whether output of labels is to be buffered or not.

              When 'SBF' is non-zero, buffering is done.  This ensures that,  if  the  end  of  a  curve  occurs
              anywhere  within  a  particular  label, no part of the label is written; instead, that part of the
              curve is drawn using only the gap and solid elements of  the  dash  pattern.   Buffering  is  also
              important  when  'SCF'  is non-zero or there are "break" characters in a label string and 'SAF' is
              greater than zero; in this case, the buffering makes it possible to reorient the label  as  needed
              to make most of it upright.

              When  'SBF'  is  zero,  buffering  is turned off. There may be gaps at the ends of curves.  If, in
              addition, 'SCF' is non-zero or there are "break" characters in label strings, there may be partial
              labels at the ends of curves.

              The value of 'SBF' must be either 0 or 1.

              The default value is 1.

       'SCF' - Integer

              Single Character Flag: When 'SCF' is non-zero, it says that the label-string portions of character
              dash patterns are to be broken into single-character pieces, each of which is to be written  by  a
              separate call to PLCHHQ, PLCHMQ, or PLCHLQ.

              If  'SCF'  = 0, label strings are broken into pieces only at the break points indicated by the use
              of "break" characters in the strings.

              It is not appropriate to use 'SCF' non-zero when PLCHHQ is being used and a label  string  in  the
              dash pattern contains function codes that are meaningful to PLCHHQ; in that case, one should leave
              'SCF' = 0 and use the "break" character 'CRB' in the label string to tell DASHPACK where it can be
              broken.

              The value of 'SCF" must be either 0 or 1.

              The default value is 0.

       'SSL' - Real

              Smoothed  Segment  Length: specifies how far apart the points used to draw a smoothed curve should
              be.

              The value of 'SSL' is given in the fractional coordinate system and must  be  in  the  range  from
              .000001 to 1.

              The default value is .01.

       'TCS' - Real

              Tension  on  Cubic  Splines:  a  value which, if negative, turns smoothing off, and which, if non-
              negative, turns smoothing on and, if greater than zero, specifies the desired tension to  be  used
              on the cubic splines used to do the smoothing.

              Note  that  only the routines DPCURV, DPFRST, DPVECT, DPLAST, and DPSMTH are affected by the value
              of 'TCS'; the routines DPLINE and DPDRAW never smooth. The routine DPSMTH always smooths: if 'TCS'
              is less than or equal to zero, simple cubic splines are used, and, if 'TCS' is greater than  zero,
              splines under tension are used, in which case 'TCS' specifies the desired tension.

              It's  a  bad idea to use values of 'TCS' much bigger than about 15, as this can cause overflows in
              the smoothing routines.

              The default value is -1.

       'WOC' - Real

              Width Of Character: the character width to be used in writing labels.

              The value of 'WOC' is given in the fractional coordinate system and must  be  in  the  range  from
              .000001 to 1.

              The default value is .01.

       'WOG' - Real

              Width of Gap: the width of each gap in the dashed line.

              The  value  of  'WOG'  is  given in the fractional coordinate system and must be in the range from
              .000001 to 1.

              The default value is .005.

       'WOS' - Real

              Width of Solid: the width of each solid in the dashed line.

              The value of 'WOS' is given in the fractional coordinate system and must  be  in  the  range  from
              .000001 to 1.

              The default value is .005.
