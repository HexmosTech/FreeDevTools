</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Gridall_params - This document briefly describes all Gridall internal parameters.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       GRIDAL has twenty-two internal parameters, each of which affects, in some way, the behavior of the
       routines that draw backgrounds. The current value of a parameter may be retrieved by calling GAGETC,
       GAGETI, and/or GAGETR and it may be reset by calling GASETC, GASETI, and/or GASETR; certain parameters
       may also be reset by calling other, older, routines (GACOLR, LABMOD, TICKS, and TICK4).

       Parameter descriptions, in alphabetical order, of all Gridall internal parameters follow. Each
       description begins with a line giving the parameter name and the intrinsic FORTRAN type of the parameter.

       ´CAX´ - Integer
              The  polyline color index to be used for drawing the axes. A negative value implies that no change
              is to be made in the polyline color index before drawing the axes. The default value of  ´CAX´  is
              -1; its value may be changed by calling GASETI, GASETR, or GACOLR (argument KAXS) .

       ´CLB´ - Integer
              The polyline/text color index to be used for drawing labels. (Both are affected because the labels
              may  be drawn using calls to WTSTR or calls to PLCHHQ.) A negative value implies that no change is
              to be made in the polyline and text color indices before drawing the labels. The default value  of
              ´CLB´ is -1; its value may be changed by calling GASETI, GASETR, or GACOLR (argument KLBL).

       ´CMJ´ - Integer
              The  polyline  color  index to be used for major ticks and/or grid lines. A negative value implies
              that no change is to be made in the polyline color index before drawing  major  ticks/grid  lines.
              The  default  value  of ´CMJ´ is -1; its value may be changed by calling GASETI, GASETR, or GACOLR
              (argument KMJT).

       ´CMN´ - Integer
              The polyline color index to be used for minor ticks and/or grid lines. A  negative  value  implies
              that  no  change  is to be made in the polyline color index before drawing minor ticks/grid lines.
              The default value of ´CMN´ is -1; its value may be changed by calling GASETI,  GASETR,  or  GACOLR
              (argument KMNT).

       ´LTY´ - Integer
              The labeling type. The value 0 implies that the SPPS routine WTSTR is to be called to draw labels,
              the value 1 that the Plotchar routine PLCHHQ is to be called. The default value of ´LTY´ is 0; its
              value may be changed by calling GASETI or GASETR.

       ´WAX´ - Real
              The line width to be used for drawing the axes. A value less than or equal to zero implies that no
              change  is to be made in the line width scale factor before drawing the axes. The default value of
              ´WAX´ is 0; its value may be changed by calling GASETI or GASETR.

       ´WLB´ - Real
              The line width to be used for drawing labels. (Labels drawn using calls to  the  Plotchar  routine
              PLCHHQ  are  affected by this; those drawn using calls to the SPPS routine WTSTR are not.) A value
              less than or equal to zero implies that no change is to be made in the  line  width  scale  factor
              before  drawing  the  labels. The default value of ´WLB´ is 0; its value may be changed by calling
              GASETI or GASETR.

       ´WMJ´ - Real
              The line width to be used for major ticks and/or grid lines. A value less than or  equal  to  zero
              implies  that  no  change is to be made in the line width scale factor before drawing. The default
              value of ´WMJ´ is 0; its value may be changed by calling GASETI or GASETR.

       ´WMN´ - Real
              The line width to be used for minor ticks and/or grid lines. A value less than or  equal  to  zero
              implies  that  no  change is to be made in the line width scale factor before drawing. The default
              value of ´WMN´ is 0; its value may be changed by calling GASETI or GASETR.

       ´XLF´ - Character
              The format to be used for labels on the X axis. The  character  string  must  begin  with  a  left
              parenthesis  and  end  with  a  right parenthesis and it must not exceed ten characters in length.
              Conversions of types E, F, G, and I are allowed. The default value  of  ´XLF´  is  ´(E10.3)´;  its
              value may be changed by calling GASETC or LABMOD (argument FMTX).

       ´XLL´ - Integer
              The  length  of  each  X-axis  label.  If ´XLL´ is given a non-zero value "n" and LBLX is a string
              produced by the format ´XLF´, then the label will be the substring LBLX(1:n).  If,  on  the  other
              hand, ´XLL´ = 0, then the label will be the substring LBLX(m:n), where LBLX(m:m) is the first non-
              blank character in LBLX and LBLX(n:n) is the last non-blank character following LBLX(m:m). Using a
              non-zero  value  for  ´XLL´ causes labels to be centered differently than if a zero value is used.
              The default value of ´XLL´ is 0; its value may be changed by calling  GASETI,  GASETR,  or  LABMOD
              (argument NUMX).

       ´XLO´ - Real
              The (vertical) distance of an X-axis label from the X axis. Values between 0 and 1 are interpreted
              as  fractions  of  the  width of the plotter frame, while values greater than 1 are interpreted as
              plotter address units (PAUs). The value is interpreted as the distance from the bottom edge of the
              viewport to the nearest Y address of an X-axis label; negative values may be used  to  put  labels
              above  the  viewport.  The  value  0  is treated as equivalent to 20 and the value 1 is treated as
              equivalent to -20-h, where h is the height of the viewport in plotter address units.  The  default
              value  of ´XLO´ is 20, which means 20 PAUs; its value may be changed by calling GASETI, GASETR, or
              LABMOD (argument IYDC).  (Note that the LABMOD argument IXDC corresponds to  ´YLO´  and  that  the
              LABMOD argument IYDC corresponds to ´XLO´, which is perhaps somewhat counterintuitive.)

       ´XLS´ - Real
              The  size  (width)  of  characters  in  X-axis  labels.  Values between 0 and 1 are interpreted as
              fractions of the width of the plotter  frame,  while  values  greater  than  or  equal  to  1  are
              interpreted  as  plotter  address units (PAUs). The integral values 0., 1., 2., and 3. mean 8, 12,
              16, and 24 PAUs, respectively. Values less than zero are treated as zero.  The  default  value  of
              ´XLS´  is  10,  which means 10 PAUs; its value may be changed by calling GASETI, GASETR, or LABMOD
              (argument ISZX).

       ´XMJ´ - Real
              The length of major ticks on the X axis.  ABS(´XMJ´) specifies the length of major ticks on the  X
              axis; values between 0 and 1 are interpreted as fractions of the width of the plotter frame, while
              values  greater  than  or  equal to 1 are interpreted as plotter address units (PAUs). If ´XMJ´ is
              positive, the ticks point inward; if ´XMJ´ is negative, the ticks point outward. The default value
              of ´XMJ´ is 12, which means 12 PAUs; its value may be changed by calling GASETI, GASETR, or  TICKS
              (argument LMJX).

       ´XMN´ - Real
              The  length  of minor ticks on the X axis. ABS(´XMN´) specifies the length of minor ticks on the X
              axis; values between 0 and 1 are interpreted as fractions of the width of the plotter frame, while
              values greater than or equal to 1 are interpreted as plotter address units  (PAUs).  If  ´XMN´  is
              positive, the ticks point inward; if ´XMN´ is negative, the ticks point outward. The default value
              of  ´XMN´  is  8, which means 8 PAUs; its value may be changed by calling GASETI, GASETR, or TICKS
              (argument LMNX).

       ´XOR´ - Integer
              The orientation of X-axis labels. The value 0 implies the use  of  horizontal  labels,  while  the
              value  1  implies  the use of vertical labels. The default value is 0; its value may be changed by
              calling GASETI, GASETR, or LABMOD (argument IXOR).

       ´YLF´ - Character
              The format to be used for labels on the Y axis. The  character  string  must  begin  with  a  left
              parenthesis  and  end  with  a  right parenthesis and it must not exceed ten characters in length.
              Conversions of types E, F, G, and I are allowed. The default value  of  ´YLF´  is  ´(E10.3)´;  its
              value may be changed by calling GASETC or LABMOD (argument FMTY).

       ´YLL´ - Integer
              The  length  of  each  Y-axis  label.  If ´YLL´ is given a non-zero value "n" and LBLY is a string
              produced by the format ´YLF´, then the label will be the substring LBLY(1:n).  If,  on  the  other
              hand, ´YLL´ = 0, then the label will be the substring LBLY(m:n), where LBLY(m:m) is the first non-
              blank character in LBLY and LBLY(n:n) is the last non-blank character following LBLY(m:m). Using a
              non-zero  value  for  ´YLL´ causes labels to be centered differently than if a zero value is used.
              The default value of ´YLL´is 0; its value may be changed by  calling  GASETI,  GASETR,  or  LABMOD
              (argument NUMY).

       ´YLO´ - Real
              The  (horizontal)  offset  distance  of a Y-axis label from the Y axis. Values between 0 and 1 are
              interpreted as fractions of the width of the plotter  frame,  while  values  greater  than  1  are
              interpreted  as  plotter  address  units (PAUs). The value is interpreted as the distance from the
              left edge of the viewport to the nearest X address of a Y-axis label; negative values may be  used
              to  put  labels  to  the right of the viewport. The value 0 is treated as equivalent to 20 and the
              value 1 is treated as equivalent to -20-w, where w is the width of the viewport in plotter address
              units. The default value of ´YLO´ is 20, which means 20 PAUs; its value may be changed by  calling
              GASETI,  GASETR,  or  LABMOD  (argument IXDC).  (Note that the LABMOD argument IXDC corresponds to
              ´YLO´ and that  the  LABMOD  argument  IYDC  corresponds  to  ´XLO´,  which  is  perhaps  somewhat
              counterintuitive.)

       ´YLS´ - Real
              The  size  (width)  of  characters  in  Y-axis  labels.  Values between 0 and 1 are interpreted as
              fractions of the width of the plotter  frame,  while  values  greater  than  or  equal  to  1  are
              interpreted  as  plotter  address units (PAUs). The integral values 0., 1., 2., and 3. mean 8, 12,
              16, and 24 PAUs, respectively. Values less than zero are treated as zero.  The  default  value  of
              ´YLS´  is  10,  which means 10 PAUs; its value may be changed by calling GASETI, GASETR, or LABMOD
              (argument ISZY).

       ´YMJ´ - Real
              The length of major ticks on the Y axis.  ABS(´YMJ´) specifies the length of major ticks on the  Y
              axis; values between 0 and 1 are interpreted as fractions of the width of the plotter frame, while
              values  greater  than  or  equal to 1 are interpreted as plotter address units (PAUs). If ´YMJ´ is
              positive, the ticks point inward; if ´YMJ´ is negative, the ticks point outward. The default value
              of ´YMJ´ is 12, which means 12 PAUs; its value may be changed by calling GASETI, GASETR, or  TICKS
              (argument LMJY).

       ´YMN´ - Real
              The  length  of minor ticks on the Y axis. ABS(´YMN´) specifies the length of minor ticks on the Y
              axis; values between 0 and 1 are interpreted as fractions of the width of the plotter frame, while
              values greater than or equal to 1 are interpreted as plotter address units  (PAUs).  If  ´YMN´  is
              positive, the ticks point inward; if ´YMN´ is negative, the ticks point outward. The default value
              of  ´YMN´  is  8, which means 8 PAUs; its value may be changed by calling GASETI, GASETR, or TICKS
              (argument LMNY).
