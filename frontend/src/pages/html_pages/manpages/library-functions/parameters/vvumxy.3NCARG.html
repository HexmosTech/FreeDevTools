</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       VVUMXY - The user may modify this routine to define a custom mapping of vectors from a data coordinate
       system aligned with the natural boundaries of the vector field to the uniform normalized device
       coordinate (NDC) system suitable for generating a plot on an output device. It has same parameters as the
       internal Vectors routine, VVMPXY, used for the predefined mappings employed when the MAP parameter has a
       value between 0 and 2.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       CALL VVUMXY (X,Y,U,V,UVM,XB,YB,XE,YE,IST)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       X           (REAL,  input) Location of the vector along the first dimensional axis in the data coordinate
                   system. When MAP is 0, this is the X Axis. If MAP is 1, it is the longitudinal axis,  and  if
                   MAP  is  2,  it  is  the  radial axis. For other values of MAP, those that cause VVUMXY to be
                   invoked, the interpretation is up to the author of the mapping routine.

       Y           (REAL, input) Location of the vector along the second dimensional axis in the data coordinate
                   system. When MAP is 0, this is the Y Axis. If MAP is 1, it is the latitudinal  axis,  and  if
                   MAP  is  2,  it  is  the angular axis. For other values of MAP, those that cause VVUMXY to be
                   invoked, the interpretation is up to the author of the mapping routine.

       U           (REAL, input) U component of the vector. If TRT is set to 1, the direction of the U component
                   is tangent to the direction of the first dimensional axis in the data  coordinate  system  at
                   the  location of the vector. If TRT is set to 0, and MAP has a value of 0 or 2, the direction
                   of the U component is parallel to the horizontal (X axis) in NDC space.

       V           (REAL, input) V component of the vector. If TRT is set to 1, the direction of the V component
                   is normal to the direction of the first dimensional axis in the data coordinate system at the
                   location of the vector. If TRT is set to 0, and MAP has a value of 0 or 2, the  direction  of
                   the V component is parallel to the vertical (Y axis) in NDC space.

       UVM         (REAL,  input)  Magnitude of the U and V components, SQRT(U*U+V*V). Although this value could
                   be calculated within the routine, it is more efficient for the calling routine to supply  the
                   value as an argument, since it is needed for other purposes at a higher level.

       XB          (REAL,  output)  Location  of  the vector starting point along the horizontal (X axis) in NDC
                   space, before adjustment based on the value of the vector positioning parameter, VPO.

       YB          (REAL, output) Location of the vector starting point along  the  vertical  (Y  axis)  in  NDC
                   space, before adjustment based on the value of the vector positioning parameter, VPO

       XE          (REAL,  output)  Location  of  the  vector  ending point along the horizontal (X axis) in NDC
                   space, before adjustment based on the value of the vector positioning parameter, VPO

       YE          (REAL, output) Location of the vector ending point along the vertical (Y axis) in  NDC  space
                   before adjustment based on the value of the vector positioning parameter, VPO

       IST         (REAL,  output)  Status of the vector mapping operation: 0 indicates success, negative values
                   indicate that the mapping failed; positive values are reserved and should not be used by  the
                   implementor of a mapping routine.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       The  user does not call VVUMXY. Vectors calls it only when the parameter MAP has a value other than 0, 1,
       or 2, the mappings handled by Vectors internally. Note that unlike other user-modifiable mapping routines
       in NCAR Graphics, such as CPMPXY, that map a single point into the user coordinate system,  this  routine
       returns  two points, representing both ends of the vector, scaled for magnitude, in the normalized device
       coordinate (NDC) system. The NDC system is used for output because, as a coordinate system guaranteed  to
       be  rectangular and uniform, it serves as a convenient reference system to help map both vector magnitude
       and direction correctly. The term uniform, as used in this discussion, means that an arbitrary  numerical
       increment  along  either  the X or Y axis has the same length given any offset from the coordinate system
       origin. The user coordinate system does not qualify, because it may be log-scaled, or  the  X  units  may
       have a different size from the Y units.

       In  order  to implement a custom mapping, you must pick a unique mapping code (a positive integer greater
       than 2), and then modify VVUMXY to recognize and respond to the chosen code. In the standard distribution
       of NCAR Graphics, this routine resides in the file, ´vvumxy.f´.  VVUMXY has  access  to  a  common  block
       called  VVMAP  that  contains  a number of variables used to record the current transformation state.  In
       order to accommodate a variety of mapping implementations, VVMAP provides more information than  normally
       required. Consider the values stored in VVMAP as strictly read-only.  One essential member of this common
       block is IMAP, which contains the value currently assigned to the MAP parameter.

       When implementing a non-linear mapping, an iterative differential technique will most likely be required.
       Look  at  the routine, VVMPXY, in ´vvmpxy.f´, which handles the pre-defined mappings, for examples of the
       method. Both the default transformation (MAP set to 0), in order to account for possible log  scaling  of
       the  user  coordinate axes, and also the Ezmap projection (MAP set to 1) use such a technique.  Basically
       the idea is that the vector components must be proportionally reduced in size enough that an  effectively
       "instantaneous"  angle  can be calculated, although they must not become so small that the calculation is
       adversely affected by the floating point precision available for the machine. Additionally,  checks  must
       be  put  in place to prevent the increment from stepping off the edge of the coordinate system space. The
       pre-defined mappings step in the opposite direction to find  the  angle  whenever  an  increment  in  the
       original direction would fall off the edge.
