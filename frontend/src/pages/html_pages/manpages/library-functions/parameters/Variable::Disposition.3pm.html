       Variable::Disposition - helper functions for disposing of variables

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        use feature qw(say);
        use Variable::Disposition;
        my $x = [];
        dispose $x;
        say '$x is no longer defined';

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Provides some basic helper functions for making sure variables go away when you want them to.

       Currently provides "dispose" as a default import. To avoid this:

        use Variable::Disposition ();

       In addition, "retain" and "retain_future" are available as optional imports.

        use Variable::Disposition qw(dispose retain retain_future);

       The " :all " tag can be used to import every available function:

        use Variable::Disposition qw(:all);

       but it would be safer to use a version instead:

        use Variable::Disposition qw(:v1);

       since these are guaranteed not to change in future.

       Other functions for use with Future and IO::Async are likely to be added later.

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>dispose</b>
       Undefines the given variable, then checks that the original ref was destroyed.

        my $x = [1,2,3];
        dispose $x;
        # $x is no longer defined.

       This is primarily intended for cases where you no longer need a variable, and want to ensure that you
       haven't accidentally captured a strong reference to it elsewhere.

       Note that this clears the <b>caller</b>'s variable.

       This function is defined with a prototype of ($), since it is only intended for use on scalar variables.
       To clear multiple variables, use a foreach loop:

        my ($x, $y, $z) = ...;
        dispose $_ for $x, $y, $z;
        is($x, undef);
        is($y, undef);
        is($z, undef);

   <b>retain</b>
       Keeps a copy of this variable until program exit or "dispose".

       Returns the original variable.

   <b>retain_future</b>
       Holds a copy of the given Future until it's marked ready, then releases our copy.  Does not use
       "dispose", since that could interfere with other callbacks attached to the Future.

       Since Future 0.36, this behaviour is directly available via the "retain" in Future method, so it is
       recommended to use that instead of this function.

       Returns the original Future.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       •   Devel::Refcount  -  assert_oneref is almost identical to this, although it doesn't clear the variable
           it's called on

       •   Closure::Explicit - provides a sub{} wrapper that will complain if  you  capture  a  lexical  without
           explicitly declaring that you're going to do that.
