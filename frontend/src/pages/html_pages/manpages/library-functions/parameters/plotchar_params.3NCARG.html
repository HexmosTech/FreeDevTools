</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Plotchar_params - This document briefly describes all the internal parameters of Plotchar.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The following shows all of the internal parameters that affect the behavior of PCHIQU. Each entry
       includes the name of a parameter, its FORTRAN type, its default value, and a short description of the
       parameter.

       Internal Parameters of PCHIQU

              ´AS´   -   Real   -    0.
                     When  this parameter is nonzero, it forces extra space between characters. A negative value
                     is interpreted in digitization units. A positive value is interpreted as  a  multiplier  of
                     the  nominal character width specified by the argument SIZE (and, in the case of the PWRITX
                     database, one of ´PW´, ´IW´, or ´CW´, whichever is appropriate).

              ´BC´   -   Integer array   -   all -1's
                     An array of three "box colors".  Element 1 applies to the outline of the box, element 2  to
                     fill  of  the  box,  and  element  3  to  fill  of  the  box  shadow.  The value "-1" means
                     "unspecified"; and a value greater than or equal to 0 selects a particular color index.  To
                     access  element  1,  use the parameter name ´<a href="../man1/BC.1.html">BC</a>(1)´; to access element 2, use ´<a href="../man2/BC.2.html">BC</a>(2)´; etc.
                     The name ´BC´ by itself refers to element 1.

              ´BF´   -   Integer   -   0
                     When this parameter is nonzero, it requests a box around each string of characters  written
                     by  PCHIQU.  The  value  is interpreted as a three-bit flag: Add 1 to the value to have the
                     outline of the box drawn, 2 to have the box filled, and 4 to  have  its  shadow  drawn.  (1
                     implies  "draw  outline",  2  implies  "fill box", 3 implies "fill box and draw outline", 4
                     implies "fill shadow", 5 implies "fill shadow and draw outline", 6 implies "fill shadow and
                     fill box", and 7 implies "fill shadow, fill box, and draw outline".)

              ´BL´   -   Real   -   0.
                     When this parameter is greater than zero, it specifies the line  width  to  be  used  while
                     drawing  the  box  around  a  character  string.  A  value less than or equal to zero means
                     "unspecified".

              ´BM´   -   Real   -   .15
                     The width of box margins (the space between the characters and the  outline  of  the  box),
                     stated as a fraction of principal character height.

              ´BX´   -   Real   -    -.05
                     The  X  offset for box shadows, stated as a fraction of principal character height. This is
                     actually an offset in the direction ANGD.

              ´BY´   -   Real   -    -.05
                     The Y offset for box shadows, stated as a fraction of principal character height.  This  is
                     actually an offset in the direction ANGD+90.

              ´CC´   -   Integer array   -   all -1´s
                     An  array of color indices.  Element 0 specifies the principal character color and elements
                     1 through 16 specify special colors to be used for certain characters. The value  -1  means
                     "unspecified";  a  value  greater  than  or equal to zero is a particular color index to be
                     used. The routine PCDLSC may be called to define a  standard  default  set  of  colors  for
                     elements  1  through  16.  To  access  element 0, use the parameter name ´<a href="../man0/CC.0.html">CC</a>(0)´; to access
                     element 1, use ´<a href="../man1/CC.1.html">CC</a>(1)´; etc. The name ´CC´ by itself refers to element 0.

              ´CD´   -   Integer   -   0
                     The value 0 selects the complex dataset from the PWRITX  database;  1  selects  the  duplex
                     dataset.

              ´CE´   -   Integer   -   0
                     The  value  0  selects centering of strings as specified by the argument CNTR and 1 selects
                     exact centering, using text-extent quantities. This works as  desired  only  when  ´QU´  is
                     zero.

              ´CH´   -   Real   -   9.
                     Digitized cartographic height.

              ´CL´   -   Real   -   0.
                     If  greater  than  zero,  this is the desired principal line width to be used while drawing
                     characters. A value less than or equal to zero says that line width is unspecified.

              ´CS´   -   Real   -   0.
                     Constant-spacing flag. The high-quality character sets normally have variable spacing  when
                     written  "across"  the  frame. When this parameter is set nonzero, it forces the centers of
                     the characters to be spaced a constant distance apart. If a negative  value  is  used,  its
                     absolute  value  specifies the spacing in digitization units.  If a positive value is used,
                     it is interpreted as a multiplier of the nominal character width specified by the  argument
                     SIZE  (and,  in  the  case of the PWRITX database, one of ´PW´, ´IW´, or ´CW´, whichever is
                     appropriate).  Medium- and low-quality characters are not affected by this parameter.

              ´CV´   -   Real   -   14.
                     Digitized cartographic vertical spacing.

              ´CW´   -   Real   -   8.
                     Digitized cartographic width.

              ´DB´   -   Real   -   none
                     Output only - distance from (XPOS,YPOS) to the bottom edge of the text-extent box  for  the
                     last string drawn, in the fractional system.

              ´DL´   -   Real   -   none
                     Output  only  -  distance  from (XPOS,YPOS) to the left edge of the text-extent box for the
                     last string drawn, in the fractional system.

              ´DO´   -   Integer   -   1
                     The drawing order for the characters. If the value is positive, characters are drawn in the
                     order in which they appear in the input character string; otherwise, they are drawn in  the
                     opposite  order.  If  the  absolute  value  is  a 1, all shadows are drawn, followed by all
                     character bodies, followed by all outlines. If the absolute value is  2  or  greater,  each
                     character  is  drawn  completely  (including  its shadow, its body, and its outline) before
                     moving on to the next  character;  this  can  be  used,  together  with  ´SS´,  to  "stack"
                     characters so that they apparently overlap one another.

              ´DR´   -   Real   -   none
                     Output  only  -  distance from (XPOS,YPOS) to the right edge of the text-extent box for the
                     last string drawn, in the fractional system.

              ´DT´   -   Real   -   none
                     Output only - distance from (XPOS,YPOS) to the top edge of the text-extent box for the last
                     string drawn, in the fractional system.

              ´FB´   -   Real   -   .00003
                     Fidelity parameter for Bezier curves used to draw the filled fonts. The value specifies how
                     close the interpolated curve should be to the actual Bezier curve and  is  specified  as  a
                     fraction of the height of the plotter frame.

              ´FC´   -   Character   -   ´:' (a colon)
                     Function-code character.

              ´FN´   -   Character or Integer   -   0
                     Font  number.  The default value, 0, implies the use of the PWRITX database. Use a positive
                     value "n" to force the use of fontcap database "n". Use a character-string  font  name,  as
                     shown  in  table  2 in the programmer document for PLOTCHAR, in a call to PCSETC; a call to
                     PCGETC will return one of these font names.  The list of  font  names  is  also  reproduced
                     later in this man page.

              ´IH´   -   Real   -   13.
                     Digitized indexical height.

              ´IS´   -   Real   -   7.
                     Offset  to  be  used  when subscripting or superscripting a character of indexical size, in
                     digitization units.

              ´IV´   -   Real   -   20.
                     Digitized indexical vertical spacing.

              ´IW´   -   Real   -   12.
                     Digitized indexical width.

              ´MA´   -   Integer   -   0
                     The mapping flag. The value zero says that no mapping is to occur; nonzero values say  that
                     PCMPXY is to be called and select particular mappings.

              ´OC´   -   Integer   -   1
                     The outline color specifier. The value "-1" says that outline color is unspecified; a value
                     of 0 or greater selects a particular color index.

              ´OF´   -   Integer   -   0
                     The  outline flag. The value 0 says that outlines are not to be drawn; a nonzero value says
                     that outlines are to be drawn.

              ´OL´   -   Real   -   0.
                     The outline line width. A value less than or equal to  zero  says  that  outline  width  is
                     unspecified;  a  value  greater  than  zero  is  the  desired  line width, as a fraction of
                     "normal".

              ´OR´   -   Real   -   0.
                     The out-of-range flag. The value 0. says that no values returned by the routine PCMPXY  are
                     "out  of  range";  any  other  value  is  the  value  to be used as an out-of-range signal,
                     indicating that a point to be mapped is invisible under the current mapping.

              ´PH´   -   Real   -   21.
                     Digitized principal height.

              ´PS´   -   Real   -   10.
                     Offset to be used when subscripting or superscripting a character  of  principal  size,  in
                     digitization units.

              ´PV´   -   Real   -   32.
                     Digitized principal vertical spacing.

              ´PW´   -   Real   -   16.
                     Digitized principal width.

              ´QU´   -   Integer   -   0
                     Quality  flag.  The  value  0  means to use the high-quality characters, 1 means to use the
                     medium-quality characters of PCMEQU, and 2 means to use  the  "low-quality"  characters  of
                     PCLOQU.

              ´SA´   -   Real   -   .88888888...
                     A  multiplier  for  the  sizes  of all characters written directly by PCHIQU, introduced in
                     version 3.2 of NCAR Graphics in order to make characters written by PCHIQU the same size as
                     those written by PCMEQU. The default value is (16/21)(7/6). Those users who want PCHIQU  to
                     produce  the  same  size  characters that it did before may set ´SA´ to 1., but this is not
                     recommended.

              ´SC´ - Integer - 0
                     The shadow color specifier. The value "-1" says that shadow color is unspecified;  a  value
                     of 0 or greater selects a particular color index.

              ´SF´   -   Integer   -   0
                     The  shadow  flag.  The value 0 says that shadows are not to be drawn; a nonzero value says
                     that shadows are to be drawn.

              ´SL´   -   Real   -   0.
                     The shadow line width. A value less than or equal to zero says that shadow  line  width  is
                     unspecified;  a  value  greater  than  zero  is  the  desired  line width, as a fraction of
                     "normal".

              ´SS´   -   Real   -   0.
                     Subtract-space flag.  When  this  parameter  is  nonzero,  it  reduces  the  space  between
                     characters.  If  a  negative  value  is used, it is interpreted in digitization units. If a
                     positive value is used, it is interpreted as a multiplier of the  nominal  character  width
                     specified by the argument SIZE (and, in the case of the PWRITX database, one of ´PW´, ´IW´,
                     or ´CW´, whichever is appropriate).

              ´SX´   -   Real  -   -.05
                     The  X  offset  for  character shadows, stated as a fraction of principal character height.
                     This is actually an offset in the direction ANGD.

              ´SY´   -   Real   -   -.05
                     The Y offset for character shadows, stated as a fraction  of  principal  character  height.
                     This is actually an offset in the direction ANGD+90.

              ´TE´   -   Integer   -   0
                     The text-extent computation flag. Zero means do not compute text-extent quantities, nonzero
                     means  do compute them. If ´TE´ is nonzero and the value of the argument ANGD, in a call to
                     PCHIQU, is exactly 360. instead of  0.,  no  characters  are  drawn,  but  the  text-extent
                     quantities  are  still  computed.  This  provides  a  way  to get these quantities prior to
                     actually drawing a particular string.

              ´UN´   -   Integer   -   3
                     This used to be the FORTRAN logical unit number to be used in reading the data defining the
                     various character sets.  It is no longer used for anything.

              ´XB´   -   Real   -   0.
                     For retrieval only. The X position at the beginning of the last string written  by  PCHIQU,
                     in the fractional system.

              ´XC´   -   Real   -   0.
                     For  retrieval  only. The X position at the center of the last character written by PCHIQU,
                     in the fractional system.

              ´XE´   -   Real   -   0.
                     For retrieval only. The X position at the end of the last string written by PCHIQU, in  the
                     fractional system.

              ´YB´   -   Real   -   0.
                     For  retrieval  only. The Y position at the beginning of the last string written by PCHIQU,
                     in the fractional system.

              ´YC´   -   Real   -   0.
                     For retrieval only. The Y position at the center of the last character written  by  PCHIQU,
                     in the fractional system.

              ´YE´   -   Real   -   0.
                     For  retrieval only. The Y position at the end of the last string written by PCHIQU, in the
                     fractional system.

       Internal Parameters of PCMEQU

              The internal parameter ´HW´ specifies the desired ratio of the character height (the height  of  a
              capital)  to  the  character  width  (excluding  white  space). The default value of ´HW´ is 1.75,
              reflecting the fact that the capitals are digitized to be 7 units high and 4 units wide  and  1.75
              is  therefore their natural aspect ratio.  Negative values of ´HW´ may be used. The absolute value
              will be used as the ratio, but, in addition, PCHIQU will be prohibited from changing  ´HW´  (which
              it otherwise does when the quality flag ´QU´ is set to 1).

              PCMEQU  reacts  properly  to nonzero values of ´MA´ and ´OR´, which are used to request mapping of
              characters through the routine PCMPXY, as described for PCHIQU, above. Characters that are  partly
              visible and partly invisible are clipped at the visible/invisible boundary.

       Internal Parameters of PCLOQU

              PCLOQU  reacts to nonzero values of ´MA´ and ´OR´, which are used to request mapping of characters
              through the routine PCMPXY, as described for PCHIQU, above. However, it doesn´t react in quite the
              same way: Mapping will affect the position of the string written by a call to PCLOQU, the angle at
              which it is written, and the size of the characters used. The shape of the characters will not  be
              affected  (and cannot be, since the characters are drawn by calling the GKS routine GTX instead of
              GPL). If the point (XPOS,YPOS) is visible under the mapping, the whole string is considered to  be
              visible;  otherwise,  the  whole  string  is considered to be invisible. The results can be pretty
              crude; for that reason, mapping is not recommended.
