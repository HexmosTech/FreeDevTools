</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Scrolled_title_params - This document briefly describes all Scrolled_title internal parameters.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Parameter descriptions, in alphabetical order, of all Scrolled_title internal parameters follow. Each
       description begins with a line giving the parameter name and its default value.

       ´ALN´ - 0
              Flag  to  control whether alignment frames with dots in the corners are produced in non-test mode.
              ´ALN´ = 0 means "suppress them", ´ALN´ = 1 means "produce them", and ´ALN´ = 2 means "produce them
              and label the frames as ´alignment frames´".

       ´BGC´ - 0
              An integer specifying the color index to be used for the background color.  If ´BGC´ = 0,  GKS  is
              depended upon to fill the background; otherwise, STITLE does a GFA call to fill it.

       ´BGF´ - -2
              An integer specifying the type of background fade-in/fade-out.

              The value "-1" implies that background fades are suppressed.

              The value "-2" implies a fade from/to black by mapping RGB values to HSV values and varying V.

              A  non-negative  value  of  the  form "ni x 1000 + no" implies a fade-in from the color with color
              index "ni" and a fade-out to the color with color index  "no";  for  example,  the  value  "11012"
              implies  fading in from color 11 and out to color 12.  Use "999" to suppress one of the fades; for
              example, the value "26999" implies fading in from color 26,  but  no  fade-out,  while  the  value
              "999026"  implies  no  fade-in,  but  a  fade-out  to color 26.  These fades are done using linear
              interpolation in the RGB system.

       ´BGR´, ´BGG´, and ´BGB´  - Device default.
              Real values, in the range 0. to 1., to be used for the red, green,  and  blue  components  of  the
              background color.  When one of these values is set, it defines a component of the color associated
              with the current value of the color index ´BGC´.

       ´FGC´ - 1
              An  integer  specifying  the  color  index  to  be  used  for  the  default foreground color.  All
              informative information on "test run" frames and all title lines for which no other color index is
              specified will be in the color specified by this color index.

       ´FGF´ - -2
              An integer specifying the type of foreground fade-in/fade-out.

              The value "-1" implies that foreground fades are suppressed.

              The value "-2" implies a fade from/to black by mapping RGB values to HSV values and varying V.

              A non-negative value of the form "ni x 1000 + no" implies a fade-in  from  the  color  with  color
              index  "ni"  and  a  fade-out  to  the color with color index "no"; for example, the value "11012"
              implies fading in from color 11 and out to color 12.  Use "999" to suppress one of the fades;  for
              example,  the  value  "26999"  implies  fading  in from color 26, but no fade-out, while the value
              "999026" implies no fade-in, but a fade-out to color  26.   These  fades  are  done  using  linear
              interpolation in the RGB system.

              Fades  are  done on all foreground colors known to STITLE because SLSETR has been called to define
              their RGB components or because their color indices have appeared on card images  defined  by  the
              argument CRDS.

       ´FGR´,´FGG´, and ´FGB´ - Device default.
              Real  values,  in  the  range  0.  to  1., to be used for the red, green, and blue components of a
              specified foreground color.

              The index of the color being defined may be specified in parentheses following the  ´FGR´,  ´FGG´,
              or  ´FGB´; for example, the statement "CALL SLSETR ('<a href="../man2/FGR.2.html">FGR</a>(2)',.5)" defines the red component of the
              color associated with color index 2 to be .5.  If no subscript appears, the color index defined by
              the current value of ´FGC´ is the one whose definition is affected.

              A color can also be defined by calling the GKS subroutine GSCR and specifying the color  index  on
              one  of  the  card  images  in  the CRDS array.  Note, however, that any color which is to be used
              solely in a user-supplied version of the routine SLUBKG and which is  desired  to  be  subject  to
              fade-in/fade-out should be defined by means of SLSETR calls.

              Characters may be drawn in any of the foreground colors.

       ´FIN´ - 0.
              Number  of  seconds during which to fade in titles.  The background color and foreground color are
              faded in independently.  Each color is faded in in the manner specified by  the  value  of  either
              ´BGF´ or ´FGF´, whichever is appropriate.

       ´FOU´ - 0.
              Number  of  seconds during which to fade out titles. The background color and foreground color are
              faded out independently.  Each color is faded out in the manner specified by the value  of  either
              ´BGF´ or ´FGF´, whichever is appropriate.

       ´GSZ´ - 40.
              Value for interline spacing, defined in terms of a 1024x1024 grid. Used only by FTITLE.

       ´ICO´ - 1
              Centering  option.  Set  to 0 to get left edges lined up at X-coordinate 64, and to 2 to get right
              edges lined up at X-coordinate 960. Set to 1 for centered text. Used only by FTITLE.

       ´ICU´ - 5
              Unit number for reading input. Used only by FTITLE.

       ´INC´ - 300
              Vertical spacing between test frames.

       ´LOG´ - 4
              FORTRAN logical unit number for opening WISS (Workstation-Independent Segment Storage).

       ´LX1´ - 0
              Integer, in the range 0 to 32767, specifying the X coordinate of the  lower  left  corner  of  the
              viewport.  Use ´VPL´, instead.

       ´LX2´ - 32767
              Integer,  in  the  range  0 to 32767, specifying the X coordinate of the upper right corner of the
              viewport.  Use ´VPR´, instead.

       ´LY1´ - 0
              Integer, in the range 0 to 32767, specifying the Y coordinate of the  lower  left  corner  of  the
              viewport.  Use ´VPB´, instead.

       ´LY2´ - 32767
              Integer,  in  the  range  0 to 32767, specifying the Y coordinate of the upper right corner of the
              viewport.  Use ´VPT´, instead.

       ´MAP´ - 100
              internal parameter ´MA´ is to be set; otherwise, the user will be assumed to  have  set  it.   The
              default  values  of ´MAP´ and ´ORV´ are such as to create scrolled titles in the normal way; other
              values may be used to create titles that scroll upwards on the surface of the globe or that scroll
              off into space (a la Star Wars); the appropriate transformations need to be embedded  in  a  user-
              written  version of the Plotchar routine PCMPXY. (This is still rather new; eventually, there will
              be an example showing how to do this.)

       ´NFS´ - 24.
              The number of frames per second.  The default, 24, is appropriate for film.  For video, use  ´NFS´
              = 30.

       ´NXE´ - 512
              Analogous  to the Scrolled_title argument IYND, to allow for limited scrolling in the X direction.
              ´NXE´ must be within the current Scrolled_title window.

       ´NXS´ - 512
              Analogous to the Scrolled_title argument IYST, to allow for limited scrolling in the X  direction.
              ´NXS´ must be within the current Scrolled_title window.

       ´ORV´ - 1.E12
              If  non-zero,  the  value to which Plotchar´s internal parameter ´OR´ is to be set; otherwise, the
              user will be assumed to have set it.  See the discussion of the parameter ´MAP´, above.

       ´PSZ´ - 21.
              Default character height on a 1024 by 1024 grid.

       ´SBK´ - 0
              Suppresses fade in/out of the background color when a fade in/out  time  has  been  specified.  If
              ´SBK´=0, then the fade in/out will be honored; otherwise, the background color will appear at full
              intensity during a fade in/out.  This parameter has been superseded by ´BGF´, which should be used
              instead.  ´SBK´ = 0 is equivalent to ´BGF´ = -2, while ´SBK´ = 1 is equivalent to ´BGF´ = -1.

       ´SFG´ - 0
              Suppresses  fade  in/out  of  the  foreground color when a fade in/out time has been specified. If
              ´SFG´=0, then the fade in/out will be honored; otherwise, the foreground color will appear at full
              intensity during a fade in/out.  This parameter has been superseded by ´FGF´, which should be used
              instead.  ´SFG´ = 0 is equivalent to ´FGF´ = -2, while ´SFG´ = 1 is equivalent to ´FGF´ = -1.

       ´TM1´ - 1.
              Number of seconds worth of blank frames (at ´NFS´ frames/second) generated before any title frames
              produced by a call to FTITLE.  Used only by FTITLE.

       ´TM2´ - .5
              Number of seconds worth of blank frames (at ´NFS´ frames/second), between sets  of  title  frames,
              and after the last set of title frames, produced by a call to FTITLE.  Used only by FTITLE.

       ´TM3´ - 0.
              Number  of  additional seconds worth of blank frames (at ´NFS´ frames/second) after the last title
              frame produced by a call to FTITLE.  ´TM3´  may  be  negative  to  suppress  some  of  the  frames
              specified  by  ´TM2´; the number of seconds of blank frames after the last title frame will be the
              sum of ´TM2´ and ´TM3´.  Used only by FTITLE.

       ´VPB´ - 0.
              A real, in the range from 0. to 1., specifying the Y coordinate of the bottom edge of  the  STITLE
              viewport.

              The STITLE viewport is used in two ways: 1) characters are clipped at its edges; and 2) it defines
              the rectangle which is filled by STITLE when the value of 'BGC' is non-zero.

              Changing  the  values of ´VPL´, ´VPR´, ´VPB´, and ´VPT´ changes the values of ´LX1´, ´LX2´, ´LY1´,
              and ´LY2´ (and vice-versa); use of the names ´VPL´, ´VPR´, ´VPB´, and ´VPT´ is now preferred.

       ´VPL´ - 0.
              A real, in the range from 0. to 1., specifying the X coordinate of the left  edge  of  the  STITLE
              viewport.

       ´VPR´ - 0.
              A  real,  in  the range from 0. to 1., specifying the X coordinate of the right edge of the STITLE
              viewport.

       ´VPT´ - 0.
              A real, in the range from 0. to 1., specifying the Y coordinate of the  top  edge  of  the  STITLE
              viewport.

       ´WID´ - 9
              Workstation identifier for WISS (Workstation-Independent Segment Storage); this is used internally
              in the calls to Gflash.
