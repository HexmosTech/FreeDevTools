</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Areas_params - This document briefly describes all Areas parameters.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Areas currently supports nine parameters. These parameters are useful mostly for debugging Areas
       problems. The current values may be retrieved using one of the routines ARGETI or ARGETR. Parameter
       values may be reset using the routine ARSETI or ARSETR; the parameter 'DI' is for retrieval only and may
       not be given a new value by the user.

       The Areas parameter descriptions appear below in alphabetical order. Each description begins with a line
       giving the parameter name and the intrinsic FORTRAN type of the parameter.

       'AL' - Real
              Arrowhead  Length.   AL  specifies  the  length of each arrowhead used on a debug plot produced by
              ARDBPA. The value is interpreted as a fraction of the width of the plotter frame.  Using  a  value
              which is less than or equal to zero causes arrowheads to be omitted.  The default value is .008.

       'AT' - Integer
              Arithmetic  Type flag.  AT allows the user to specify the type of arithmetic Areas is to use or to
              find out what type it decided to use.  A call to set the value of AT should precede any other call
              to an Areas routine (except, possibly, one to set the value of LC) and  it  should  only  be  done
              once.   A  call  to  get the value of AT will either return the value you set or a value picked by
              Areas.

              &lt; 1  Areas decides what sort of arithmetic to use.

                1  Real arithmetic is to be used.

                2  Double-precision arithmetic is to be used.

                3  Multiple-precision arithmetic is to be used and Areas is to choose the base value.

              &gt; 3  Multiple-precision arithmetic is to be used and AT specifies the base value.   (For  example,
                   the value 100 specifies the use of base-100 multiple-precision integer arithmetic.)

            Default: 0

            Note: You should use a nonzero value of AT only on the recommendation of an NCAR consultant.

       'AW' - Real
              Arrowhead  Width.   AL specifies the half-width of each arrowhead used on a debug plot produced by
              ARDBPA. The value is interpreted as a fraction of the width of the plotter frame.  Using  a  value
              which is less than or equal to zero causes arrowheads to be omitted.  The default value is .002.

       'DB' - Integer
              DeBug-plots flag. DB allows the user to study the area map.

                0  Debugging turned off. This is the default.

              &gt; 0  Debugging is on. At selected break points, ARPRAM produces plots showing all edge segments in
                   the area map that belong to the edge group with group identifier DB.

       'DC' - Integer
              Debug Colors index. ARDBPA uses color indices DC+1 through DC+5 for debug-plot colors.

              By default, DC=100, so ARDBPA defines and uses color indices 101 through 105.

       'DI' - Integer
              Direction  Indicator flag. The value of DI is for retrieval only and cannot be set by the user.  A
              value returned for DI is meaningful only when the call to ARGETI that retrieves it originates from
              the user-written routine (dummy argument "APR") that is called  by  ARSCAM.   It  then  gives  you
              information  about  the area whose polygonal boundary is defined by the values of APR's arguments.
              The two possible values of DI are:

              1    Edge of the area is given in counterclockwise order (with the interior to the left).

              2    Edge of the area is given in clockwise order (with the interior to the right).

       'ID' - Real
              Identifier Distance.  ID specifies the distance from an arrow to a left or right  area  identifier
              on  a  debug  plot  produced by ARDBPA. The value is interpreted as a fraction of the width of the
              plotter frame. Using a value which is less than or equal to zero causes  area  identifiers  to  be
              omitted.  The default value is .004.

       'IS' - Real
              Identifier  Size.   IS  specifies the size of the characters used to write an area identifier on a
              debug plot produced by ARDBPA. The value is interpreted as a fraction of the width of the  plotter
              frame.  Using  a  value which is less than or equal to zero causes area identifiers to be omitted.
              The default value is .001.

       'LC' - Integer
              Largest Coordinate. LC lets you specify the largest coordinate allowed in an area  map.  X  and  Y
              coordinates  in  an area map are represented by integers in the range from 0 to LC, inclusive; the
              default value of LC is 1000000.

              The minimum value allowed for LC is 1000; attempting to set LC&lt;1000 gives it the value  1000.  The
              value of LC must not be greater than the largest integer on the machine on which Areas is running;
              its value must also be exactly representable as a real number on that machine.

              A call to set the value of LC should precede any other call to an Areas routine and should only be
              done once.

       'RC' - Integer
              Reconciling Conflicts in area-identifier information.

              This is an array of 16 values, indexed by group identifier.  To set all values in the array to the
              same  value  "n",  use  "CALL ARSETI('RC',n)"; to set just the first value in the array, use "CALL
              ARSETI('<a href="../man1/RC.1.html">RC</a>(1)',n)"; to set just the second value, use "CALL ARSETI('<a href="../man2/RC.2.html">RC</a>(2)',n)"; and  so  on.   You
              can  call  ARGETI  to  get the value of <a href="../man1/RC.1.html">RC</a>(1) or <a href="../man2/RC.2.html">RC</a>(2) or <a href="../man3/RC.3.html">RC</a>(3), etc.; if you ask for the value of
              just RC, you will get the value of <a href="../man1/RC.1.html">RC</a>(1).

              <a href="../man1/RC.1.html">RC</a>(1) is associated with edge group 1, <a href="../man2/RC.2.html">RC</a>(2) with edge group 2, and so on.  An edge group  with  a
              group identifier greater than 16 is associated with <a href="../man16/RC.16.html">RC</a>(16).

              When the set of possible area identifiers for a given area in a given group is contradictory, some
              algorithm must be used to choose an identifier for the area.  The value of that element of RC that
              is associated with the group determines what algorithm will be used, as follows:

              0    The  default  scheme:  If  any  of  the  possible area identifiers is negative, use -1 as the
                   identifier for the area.  Otherwise, if none of the possible values is non-zero, use  a  zero
                   identifier.  Otherwise, from among the non-zero possibilities, use the one most recently seen
                   by AREAS.

              1    The  set  of  possible identifiers is examined:  Zeroes are ignored, negatives are treated as
                   -1's, and the value that occurs  most  frequently  in  the  resulting  set  is  used  as  the
                   identifier for the area.

              2    Using  RC  =  2  is  just  like  using  RC  =  1 except that zeroes are not ignored: the area
                   identifier used is simply the one that occurs most frequently in  the  set  of  possibilities
                   (all negatives being treated as -1's).

              -1   Using RC = -1 is just like using RC = 1 except that, if there are any negatives in the set of
                   possible identifiers, a -1 is used.

              -2   Using RC = -2 is just like using RC = 2 except that, if there are any negatives in the set of
                   possible identifiers, a -1 is used.
