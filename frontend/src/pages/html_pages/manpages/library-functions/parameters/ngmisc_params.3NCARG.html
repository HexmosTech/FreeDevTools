</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Ngmisc_params - This document briefly describes all Ngmisc internal parameters.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Parameter descriptions, in alphabetical order, of all Ngmisc internal parameters follow. Each entry
       includes the name of a parameter, its FORTRAN type, its default value, and a short description of the
       parameter.

       ´CA´   -   Integer   -   1
              This  parameter  controls  the  type  of line cap used in PostScript output from NCAR GKS.  If the
              value is 0, butt caps are used; if the value is 1, round  caps  are  used;  if  the  value  is  2,
              projecting  square  caps  are used.  This value applies to the specific workstation specified in a
              previous call to NGSETI to set a value for the ´WO´ parameter (see below).

       ´CL´   -   Integer   -   1
              Specifies whether clipping to NDC space is on in NCAR GKS.  A value of "1" will turn  clipping  on
              and  a  value  of "0" will turn it off.  This flag controls whether filled areas and polylines are
              clipped if they go out of the world coordinate rectangle that gets mapped onto  NDC  space.   This
              clipping  is  not to be confused with the clipping that is controlled by the GKS GSCLIP function -
              that function controls whether clipping is to be done to the viewport of the current normalization
              transformation, not to NDC  space  itself  (unless  the  viewport  of  the  current  normalization
              transformation is the entirety of NDC space).

       ´CM´   -   Integer     -   1
              If  CM  equals 1, then the RGB color model is used for PostScript output; if CM equals 0, then the
              CMYK color model is used for PostScript output.

       ´CO´   -   Integer   -   25
              A positive integer specifying a scale factor for  the  integer  coordinate  values  in  PostScript
              output from NCAR GKS.  This value will apply to the first PostScript workstation opened with GOPWK
              after  specifying  the value for ´CO´.  The default coordinates in PostScript user space represent
              units of 1/72 of an inch; for an 8 1/2 inch  by  11  inch  page  in  portrait  mode,  the  default
              PostScript  user  coordinate  space  is  0  to  612  in X and  0  to  792 in Y.  The value of ´CO´
              will multiply the PostScript user coordinates by the specified amount.  Specifying  larger  values
              for  CO  will  increase  the accuracy of coordinate positions at the expense of larger files (more
              space is needed to represent the larger integer coordinate values);  smaller  numbers  reduce  the
              accuracy of coordinate positions, but reduce file sizes.

       ´CT´   -   Integer   -    0
              Specifies  whether  NGDOTS will draw filled dots or circles.  If the value of CT is 0, then filled
              dots are drawn.  If the value of CT is not 0, then circles are drawn.

       ´ER´   -   Integer   -   10
              Specifies the maximum number of error  messages  that  will  be  issued  by  NCAR  GKS  before  it
              terminates execution.  ER must be larger than zero.

       ´FI´   -   Real   -   0.0005
              A  real  number  in  the  range  0.  to 1. (normalized device coordinate space) that specifies the
              spacing between fill lines used in software fill in PostScript output from NCAR GKS.   This  value
              applies  to the specific workstation specified in a previous call to NGSETI to set a value for the
              "WO" parameter (see below).

       ´FU´   -   Integer   -   0
              Controls whether the background color is applied to the entirety of a page, or just  the  viewport
              area,  in  PostScript  output from NCAR GKS.  If the value is 0, then the background color applies
              only to the viewport area; if the value is non-zero, then the background color covers  the  entire
              page.   This  value  applies to the specific workstation specified in a previous call to NGSETI to
              set a value for the ´WO´ parameter (see below).

       ´HA´   -   Real   -   0.01
              A real number in the range 0. to 1.  (normalized  device  coordinate  space)  that  specifies  the
              spacing between hatch lines used in hatch-pattern filled areas in PostScript output from NCAR GKS.
              This  value  applies  to  the specific workstation specified in a previous call to NGSETI to set a
              value for the ´WO´ parameter (see below).

       ´IG´   -   Integer   -   0
              A flag to indicate whether the clip rectangles in segment copies should be  transformed  by  using
              the  current segment transformation.  The GKS standard says that the clip rectangles should not be
              so transformed and this is the default.

       ´JO´   -   Integer   -   1
              Controls the type of line join used in PostScript output from NCAR GKS.  If the value is 0,  miter
              joins  are used; if the value is 1, round joins are used; if the value is 2, bevel joins are used.
              This value applies to the specific workstation specified in a previous call to  NGSETI  to  set  a
              value for the ´WO´ parameter (see below).

       ´LB´   -   Integer   -   1
              Specifies  the  secondary  logo  color (this is applicable only for logo type 5, in which case the
              secondary color is used for the text string "UCAR").

       ´LC´   -   Integer   -   1
              Specifies the logo color (except in the case of  an  NCAR  logo  being  plotted  to  a  PostScript
              workstation, in which case you will get the full-color logo).

       ´LT´   -   Integer   -   1
              Specify  the logo type.  See the documentation for NGLOGO for a list of the logo types, or execute
              "ncargex miex01" for an example plot that lists the logo types.

       ´LX´   -   Integer   -   36
              Specifies the left X coordinate value to be used in positioning PostScript output from NCAR GKS on
              the output page.  This value is in the default PostScript user space where one unit corresponds to
              1/72 inch.  This value must be specified before opening the PostScript  workstation  to  which  it
              will apply.  See descriptions for the parameters ´LY´, ´UX´, and ´UY´.

       ´LY´   -   Integer   -   126
              Specifies  the  lower Y coordinate value to be used in positioning PostScript output from NCAR GKS
              on the output page.  This value is in the default PostScript user space where one unit corresponds
              to 1/72 inch.  This value must be specified before opening the PostScript workstation to which  it
              will apply.  See descriptions for the parameters ´LX´, ´UX´, and ´UY´.

       ´MC´   -   Integer     -   depends on the workstation type
              The  X11  workstation indicated by the integer should use a "mixed" X color model.  (-1) indicates
              the next X11 workstation created.

       ´ME´   -   Character   -   depends on the workstation type
              A character string that specifies the metafile name that will be used by the next NCAR  GKS  GOPWK
              call that opens a GKS CGM or PostScript workstation.

       ´MI´   -   Real   -   10.
              Controls  the  miter limit of line joins in PostScript output from NCAR GKS.  This applies only if
              line joins are specified as mitered joins (see the description of the parameter ´JO´ above).  This
              value applies to the specific workstation specified in a previous call to NGSETI to  set  a  value
              for the ´WO´ parameter (see below).

       ´NO´   -   Real   -   1.0
              A  positive  real  number specifying a scale factor for the nominal linewidth in PostScript output
              from NCAR GKS.  Setting the value larger than 1.0 will result in all line thicknesses being fatter
              by that amount; setting the value smaller than 1.0 will  result  in  all  line  thicknesses  being
              narrower  by  that amount.  This value applies to the specific workstation specified in a previous
              call to NGSETI to set a value for the ´WO´ parameter (see below).

       ´OS´   -   Real   -  0.07
              Specifies the logo size in normalized device coordinates  (a  number  between  0.  and  1.).   For
              example, a size specification of 0.1 would give a logo size one-tenth the maximum plot height.

       ´OX´   -   Real   -  0.93
              Specify the logo X-coordinate position in normalized device coordinates.

       ´OY´   -   Real   -  0.05
              Specify the logo Y-coordinate position in normalized device coordinates.

       ´PA´   -   Integer   -   1300
              Specifies  the maximum size of paths used in PostScript output from NCAR GKS.  This value controls
              when software fill will be used in place of hardware fill.  Larger values  result  in  significant
              file  size  and  interpretation  time  savings.   This  value  applies to the specific workstation
              specified in a previous call to NGSETI to set a value for the ´WO´  parameter  (see  below).   The
              default   value   is  compatible  with  the  minimum  value  specified  in  the  Adobe  PostScript
              specifications that is to apply to all PostScript interpreters.  A specific interpreter may  allow
              for  significantly  larger  paths.  See the documentation for your local PostScript interpreter to
              determine this value.

       ´PC´   -   Integer     -   depends on the workstation type
              The X11 workstation indicated by the integer should use a "private" X color model.  (-1) indicates
              the next X11 workstation created.

       ´PE´   -   Integer   -   20
              Percentage error allowed in matching requested colors in X Window output where the window shares a
              single color map with all the other current X windows.  The value "0" is special and is  the  same
              as  the  value  "100"  meaning that any color may be selected.  In the default environment all X11
              windows share a single color map and when a request is made to allocate a new color, and there are
              no more colors left, then the nearest color (to within the stated percentage)  is  selected.   The
              "nearest  color"  is  the one in the current color table that is closest using the normal distance
              metric in the RGB color cube.  The percentage error is measured as a percentage  of  lenght  of  a
              diagonal of the RGB color cube.

       ´PH´   -   Integer     -   792
              Specification, in points, of the PDF output page height.

       ´PI´   -   Character   -   blanks
              A  character  string  that will be used for the picture name of the current picture in the PICTURE
              NAME element of an ncgm file.  The first picture must be named  before  the  ncgm  workstation  is
              opened and subsequent pictures must be named immediately after creating the previous picture.  Not
              all pictures need be named and any picture that is not assigned a specific name is assigned blanks
              in the PICTURE NAME field of the ncgm.

       ´PW´   -   Integer     -   612
              Specification, in points, of the PDF output page width.

       ´SC´   -   Integer     -   depends on the workstation type
              The  X11 workstation indicated by the integer should use a "shared" X color model.  (-1) indicates
              the next X11 workstation created.

       ´SH´   -   Integer     -   612
              Specification, in points, of the PS output page height.

       ´SE´   -   Character   -   'GSEG'
              Specifies a root name for segments created by NCAR GKS.  In the default  case,  the  segment  name
              used  will  be  constructed  from  GSEG  by appending an integer constructed from the user id, the
              process id, and the segment number.   By  default,  the  segments  are  stored  in  the  directory
              specified by the environment variable TMPDIR (usually set internally at install time to <a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a>).  If
              SE  is  changed away from the default setting, then the segment name will be cunstructed using the
              value of SE as a root and appending the segment number.

       ´SW´   -   Integer     -   792
              Specification, in points, of the PS output page width.

       ´SS´   -   Integer   -   1
              Specifies whether segments should be deleted when WISS  is  closed.   The  default  is  to  delete
              segments.  Setting SS to a non-default value will cause segments to be saved.

       ´ST´   -   Integer   -   200
              Specifies  the  maximum  size  of  the operand stack used in PostScript output from NCAR GKS.  The
              primary effect of setting this value controls how many points can be included in a locally-defined
              macro for polylines and filled areas.  Larger values result in space savings.  This value  applies
              to  the  specific  workstation  specified in a previous call to NGSETI to set a value for the ´WO´
              parameter (see below).  The default value is compatible with the minimum value  specified  in  the
              Adobe PostScript specifications that is to apply to all PostScript interpreters.

       ´UX´   -   Integer   -   576
              Specifies  the  upper X coordinate value to be used in positioning PostScript output from NCAR GKS
              on the output page.  This value is in the default PostScript user space where one unit corresponds
              to 1/72 inch.  This value must be specified before opening the PostScript workstation to which  it
              will apply.  See descriptions for the parameters "LX", "LY", and "UY".

       ´UY´   -   Integer   -   666
              An integer that specifies the upper Y coordinate value to be used in positioning PostScript output
              from  NCAR  GKS  on the output page.  This value is in the default PostScript user space where one
              unit corresponds to 1/72 inch.  This  value  must  be  specified  before  opening  the  PostScript
              workstation to which it will apply.  See descriptions for the parameters "LX", "LY", and "UX".

       ´WO´   -   Integer   -   none
              An integer specifying the NCAR GKS workstation ID that will be used for subsequent parameters that
              apply to a specific workstation.
