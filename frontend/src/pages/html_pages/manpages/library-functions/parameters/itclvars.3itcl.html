       itclvars - variables used by [incr Tcl]
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  following  global variables are created and managed automatically by the <b>[incr</b> <b>Tcl]</b> library.  Except
       where noted below, these variables should normally be treated as read-only by  application-specific  code
       and by users.

       <b>itcl::library</b>
              When  an  interpreter  is  created,  <b>[incr</b> <b>Tcl]</b>  initializes  this  variable to hold the name of a
              directory containing the system library of <b>[incr</b> <b>Tcl]</b> scripts.  The initial value of <b>itcl::library</b>
              is set from the ITCL_LIBRARY environment variable if  it  exists,  or  from  a  compiled-in  value
              otherwise.

       <b>itcl::patchLevel</b>
              When  an  interpreter  is  created, <b>[incr</b> <b>Tcl]</b> initializes this variable to hold the current patch
              level for <b>[incr</b> <b>Tcl]</b>.  For example, the value "<b>2.0p1</b>" indicates <b>[incr</b> <b>Tcl]</b> version  2.0  with  the
              first set of patches applied.

       <b>itcl::purist</b>
              When  an  interpreter  is  created  containing  Tcl/Tk and the <b>[incr</b> <b>Tcl]</b> namespace facility, this
              variable controls a "backward-compatibility" mode for widget access.

              In vanilla Tcl/Tk, there is a single pool of commands, so the access command for a widget  is  the
              same as the window name.  When a widget is created within a namespace, however, its access command
              is  installed in that namespace, and should be accessed outside of the namespace using a qualified
              name.  For example,

                     namespace foo {
                         namespace bar {
                             button .b -text "Testing"
                         }
                     }
                     foo::bar::.b configure -background red
                     pack .b

              Note that the window name ".b" is still used in conjunction with commands like <b>pack</b>  and  <b>destroy</b>.
              However,  the  access  command  for the widget (i.e., name that appears as the <u>first</u> argument on a
              command line) must be more specific.

              The "<b>winfo</b> <b>command</b>" command can be used to  query  the  fully-qualified  access  command  for  any
              widget, so one can write:

                     [winfo command .b] configure -background red

              and  this  is  good  practice when writing library procedures.  Also, in conjunction with the <b>bind</b>
              command, the "%q" field can be used in place of "%W" as the access command:

                     bind Button &lt;Key-Return&gt; {%q flash; %q invoke}

              While this behavior makes sense from the standpoint of  encapsulation,  it  causes  problems  with
              existing Tcl/Tk applications.  Many existing applications are written with bindings that use "%W".
              Many library procedures assume that the window name is the access command.

              The  <b>itcl::purist</b>  variable  controls a backward-compatibility mode.  By default, this variable is
              "0", and the window name can be used as an access command in any context.   Whenever  the  <b>unknown</b>
              procedure  stumbles  across  a  widget  name,  it  simply  uses  "<b>winfo</b>  <b>command</b>" to determine the
              appropriate command name.  If this variable is set to "1",  this  backward-compatibility  mode  is
              disabled.   This  gives  better encapsulation, but using the window name as the access command may
              lead to "invalid command" errors.

       <b>itcl::version</b>
              When an interpreter is created, <b>[incr</b> <b>Tcl]</b> initializes this variable to hold the version number of
              the form <u>x.y</u>.  Changes to <u>x</u> represent major changes with probable incompatibilities and changes to
              <u>y</u> represent small enhancements and bug fixes that retain backward compatibility.
