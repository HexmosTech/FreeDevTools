</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Ezmap_params - This document briefly describes all internal parameters of EZMAP.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       EZMAP has a large group of internal parameters, each of which affects the behavior of one or more of the
       EZMAP routines. The current values of the internal parameters may be retrieved using the routines MAPGTC,
       MAPGTI, MAPGTL, and MAPGTR. The values of most of the internal parameters may be reset using the routines
       MAPSTC, MAPSTI, MAPSTL, and MAPSTR; some of the parameters are intended for retrieval only and may not be
       given new values in this way.

       Parameter descriptions, in alphabetical order, of all EZMAP internal parameters follow. Each description
       begins with a line giving the parameter name and the intrinsic FORTRAN type of the parameter.

       'AR' - Character
              For  retrieval  only. The value of the map limits specifier JLTS from the last call to MAPSET. The
              default value is 'MA'.

       'Cn' - Integer
              The character "n" is a digit between 1 and 8. Each 'Cn', if zero or greater, specifies  the  color
              index  of  some  part  of  the map. The user must do the calls to GKS routines to define the color
              indices. All default values are -1s, indicating no change in color index from one part of the  map
              to another.

       'C1' - Integer
              Color index for perimeter. See 'Cn', above.

       'C2' - Integer
              Color index for grid. See 'Cn', above.

       'C3' - Integer
              Color index for labels. See 'Cn', above.

       'C4' - Integer
              Color index for limb lines. See 'Cn', above.

       'C5' - Integer
              Color index for continent outlines. See 'Cn', above.

       'C6' - Integer
              Color index for U.S. state outlines. See 'Cn', above.

       'C7' - Integer
              Color index for outlines of countries of the world.

       'C8' - Integer
              Color index for outlines of counties of the world.  See 'Cn', above.

       'DA' - Integer
              Dashed-line  pattern for the grids. A 16-bit quantity. The default is 21845 (octal 52525 or binary
              0101010101010101).

       'DD' - Integer or Real
              Distance between dots along a dotted line drawn by MAPIT. The default value is 12  (out  of  4096;
              see 'RE', below).

       'DL' - Integer or Logical
              If  true  (non-zero),  user  calls  to MAPIT draw dotted lines. The default is false (zero); lines
              drawn by MAPIT are solid or dashed, depending on the current state of the Dashline  package.  'DL'
              may  be  reset by a user version of MAPUSR or MPCHLN to change the way in which the perimeter, the
              grid, the limb lines, and the outlines are drawn.

       'DO' - Integer or Logical
              If true (non-zero), outlines are dotted. The default is false (zero); outlines are solid.

       'EL' - Integer or Logical
              If true (non-zero), only that part of the map which falls inside an ellipse inscribed  within  the
              normal  rectangular  perimeter  is  drawn. This is particularly appropriate for use with azimuthal
              projections and angular limits specifying a square, in which case the ellipse  becomes  a  circle,
              but it will work for any map. The default value is false (zero).

       'GD' - Real
              The  distance  between  points  used  to  draw the grid, in degrees. The default value is 1.; user
              values must fall between 0.001 and 10.0.

       'GP' - Integer or Real
              Specifies the way in which the grid, if drawn, is to be modified near  the  poles  on  projections
              which  map the poles into single points; 'GP' is given a value of the form "1000*GLAT+GLON", where
              GLAT is an integer between 0 and 90 and GLON is a positive real between 0 and 360.

              If GLAT is zero, all the latitude lines of the grid are drawn; if GLAT is non-zero, latitude lines
              at latitudes from GLAT to 90, inclusive (South or North) are omitted.

              If GLON is zero, no longitude lines are drawn near the poles; if GLON is non-zero, only  longitude
              lines of the grid at multiples of GLON are drawn near the poles.

              Examples: "'GP'=0" says "draw all the latitude lines of the grid; omit longitude lines of the grid
              near the poles."  "'GP'=1" says "draw entire grid."  "'GP'=75045" says "suppress latitude lines of
              the  grid  above  75N  and below 75S; near the poles, draw the longitude lines of the grid only at
              multiples of 45 degrees."  The default is "'GP'=90", which says "draw all latitude  lines  of  the
              grid; near the poles, omit longitude lines of the grid except those at multiples of 90 degrees".

       'GR' - Integer or Real
              The  desired grid spacing, in degrees.  (Note that, when 'GT' and/or 'GN' have values greater than
              zero, they are used in place of 'GR'.)  Giving 'GR' a value less than or equal to zero  suppresses
              the grid.  The default value of 'GR' is 10 degrees.

       'GT' and 'GN' - Integer or Real
              The desired spacings of latitude and longitude grid lines, respectively (in degrees); if either is
              less than or equal to zero, the value of 'GR' is used instead.

       'G1' - Integer
              The  group  identifier  to be used by MAPBLA or MPLNAM when putting into the area map the group of
              edges that define the division of the plotter  frame  into  the  projected  images  of  geographic
              entities.

       'G2' - Integer
              The  group  identifier  to be used by MAPBLA or MPLNAM when putting into the area map the group of
              edges that define the division of the plotter frame into vertical strips.

       'IN' - Integer or Logical
              For retrieval only. Initialization flag. If true (non-zero), it says that  EZMAP  is  in  need  of
              initialization (by a CALL MAPINT). The default value is true (non-zero).

       'LA' - Integer or Logical
              If true (non-zero), label the meridians and the poles. The default is true (non-zero).

       'LS' - Integer
              Controls  label  size.  A  character width, to be used in a call to PWRIT. The default value is 1,
              which gives a character width of 12 plotter units.

       'MV' - Integer or Real
              Minimum vector length for MAPIT. A point closer to the previous point than this  is  omitted.  The
              default value is 4 (out of 4096; see 'RE', below).

       'OU' - Character
              Says  which set of outline data are be used by MAPLOT, MAPBLA, and MAPBLM. The possible values are
              'NO' (no outlines), 'CO' (continental outlines), 'US' (U.S.  state  outlines),  'PS'  (continental
              outlines  plus  international  outlines  plus  U.S. outlines), and 'PO' (continental outlines plus
              international outlines).  Default is 'CO'.

       'PE' - Integer or Logical
              If true (non-zero), draw the perimeter. The default is true (non-zero).

       'PN' - Integer or Real
              For retrieval only. The value of PLON from the last call to MAPROJ. The default value is zero.

       'PR' - Character
              For retrieval only. The value of the projection specifier JPRJ from the last call to  MAPROJ.  The
              default value is 'CE'.

       'PT' - Integer or Real
              For retrieval only. The value of PLAT from the last call to MAPROJ. The default value is zero.

       'Pn' - Integer or Real
              For retrieval only. The character "n" is a digit from 1 to 8, inclusive. Retrieves values from the
              call to MAPSET.  P1 through P4 specify <a href="../man1/PLM1.1.html">PLM1</a>(1), <a href="../man1/PLM2.1.html">PLM2</a>(1), <a href="../man1/PLM3.1.html">PLM3</a>(1), and <a href="../man1/PLM4.1.html">PLM4</a>(1), while P5 through P8
              specify <a href="../man2/PLM1.2.html">PLM1</a>(2), <a href="../man2/PLM2.2.html">PLM2</a>(2), <a href="../man2/PLM3.2.html">PLM3</a>(2), and <a href="../man2/PLM4.2.html">PLM4</a>(2). Default values are all zero.

       'RE' - Integer or Real
              The width of the target plotter, in plotter units.  The default value is 4096.

       'RO' - Integer or Real
              For retrieval only. The value of ROTA from the last call to MAPROJ. The default value is zero.

       'SA' - Integer or Real
              If  'SA'  is  greater than 1., a satellite-view projection replaces the orthographic. The value is
              the distance of the satellite from the center of the earth, in multiples of  the  earth's  radius.
              The default value is zero. See also 'S1' and 'S2', below.

       'S1' and 'S2' - Integer or Real
              Used  only  when  'SA'  is  greater  than  1. Both are angles, in degrees. 'S1' measures the angle
              between the line to the center of the earth and the line of sight (to which the  projection  plane
              is  perpendicular). If 'S1' is zero, the projection shows the earth as seen by a satellite looking
              straight down; call this the "basic view". If 'S1' is non-zero, 'S2' measures the angle  from  the
              positive u axis of the basic view to the line OP, where O is the origin of the basic view and P is
              the  projection  of  the  desired  line  of  sight on the basic view. 'S2' is positive if measured
              counter-clockwise.

       'SR' - Real
              A search radius, in degrees, used by MAPINT in finding the latitude/longitude range of a map.  The
              default  value is 1.; user values must lie between 0.001 and 10.0. Should not be changed except by
              advice of a consultant.

       'VS' - Integer
              The vertical-stripping parameter, which determines whether MAPBLA and MPLNAM put into the area map
              edge group 'G2', defining a set of vertical strips. A negative or  zero  value  of  'VS'  prevents
              MAPBLA  and  MPLNAM  from  doing  this.  A  value  greater  than zero requests that it be done and
              specifies the number of vertical strips to be created. The default value of 'VS' is 1.

       'XL', 'XR', 'YB', and 'YT' - Real
              For retrieval only. The parameters XLOW, XROW, YBOW, and  YTOW  from  the  last  call  to  MAPPOS.
              Defaults are 0.05, 0.95, 0.05, and 0.95, respectively.
