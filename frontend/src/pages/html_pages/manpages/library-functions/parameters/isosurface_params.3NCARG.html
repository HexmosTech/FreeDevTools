</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Isosurface_params - This document briefly describes all Isosurface internal parameters.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Parameter descriptions, in alphabetical order, of all Isosurface internal parameters follow. Each
       description begins with a line giving the parameter name and the intrinsic FORTRAN type of the parameter.

       'IU' - Integer
              Number  of  extra slabs to be interpolated between each pair of slabs perpendicular to the U axis.
              Using a non-zero value takes longer, but makes a better picture. Negate the value  to  interpolate
              the  extra  slabs  but not draw them, which has the effect of reducing errors due to being able to
              see between slabs.  Attempting to give 'IU' a value less than -10 will  give  it  the  value  -10;
              similarly,  trying to give it a value greater than 10 will give it the value 10. The default value
              is 0.

       'IV' - Integer
              Like 'IU', but applies to extra slabs perpendicular to the V axis. The default value is 0.

       'IW' - Integer
              Like 'IU', but applies to extra slabs perpendicular to the W axis. The default value is 0.

       'RF' - Integer
              Controls drawing of reference planes and axes. Zero means "don't draw them"; non-zero means  "draw
              them". The default value is 1.

       'RS' - Real
              Zero  turns  off  the  "relative  size" feature; the 3D grid box will be scaled to fill almost the
              entire plotter frame.  Give 'RS' a non-zero value to turn on the "relative size"  feature  and  to
              specify  that  distance  from  which the box, when viewed from the direction which makes its image
              largest, almost fills the frame. Views from closer in will give a  bigger  image  and  views  from
              farther out will give a smaller image.  This is useful when making movies with the "camera" flying
              around the box. The default value is 0.

       'SL' - Real
              Segment length. When contours are smoothed, this parameter specifies the approximate length of the
              line  segments used to draw the smooth curves. Values outside the range from 0.0001 to 0.1 will be
              mapped to the nearer end of that range. The default value is 0.01.

       'SM' - Integer
              Screen model selector. Zero selects the coarse screen model (128 x 128); non-zero selects a  finer
              screen  model (256 x 256). Using the former is faster, but using the latter gives better pictures.
              The default value is 0.

       'ST' - Real
              Spline tension. If zero, turns off the smoothing of contours. If non-zero, turns the  smoother  on
              and  determines  the  tension  on the splines used to do the smoothing. Use of values greater than
              about 15. has been observed to cause overflow on some machines. The default value is 0.

       'SV' - Integer
              Special value. The value zero turns off the special-value feature. A non-zero value turns  on  the
              feature  and  specifies  the  special  value itself. Regions filled with this value are treated as
              being outside the volume bounded by the isosurface. Preliminary experiments seem to indicate  that
              sometimes  the use of special values works well and sometimes it doesn't (depending on the pattern
              of the special values in the field). The default value is 0.

       'VB' - Real
              The position of the bottom edge of the viewport in  which  the  isosurface  is  to  be  displayed,
              expressed  as  a  fraction  between  0  (the  bottom edge of the frame) and 1 (the top edge of the
              frame). The default value is 0.

       'VL' - Real
              The position of the left edge of the  viewport  in  which  the  isosurface  is  to  be  displayed,
              expressed  as  a  fraction  between  0  (the  left edge of the frame) and 1 (the right edge of the
              frame). The default value is 0.

       'VR' - Real
              The position of the right edge of the viewport  in  which  the  isosurface  is  to  be  displayed,
              expressed  as  a  fraction  between  0  (the  left edge of the frame) and 1 (the right edge of the
              frame). The default value is 1.

       'VT' - Real
              The position of the top edge of the viewport in which the isosurface is to be displayed, expressed
              as a fraction between 0 (the bottom of the frame) and 1 (the top edge of the frame).  The  default
              value is 1.
