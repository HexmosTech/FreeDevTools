       URI::Normalize - Normalize URIs according to RFC 3986

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 0.002

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use URI;
           use URI::Normalize qw( normalize_uri remove_dot_segments );
           my $uri = URI-&gt;new('HTTPS://www.Example.com:443/../test/../foo/index.html');

           say normalize_uri($uri);       #&gt; https://www.example.com/foo/index.html
           say remove_dot_segments($uri); #&gt; HTTPS://www.Example.com:443/foo/index.html

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Section 6 of RFC 3986 describes a process of URI normalization. This implements syntax-based
       normalization and may include some schema-based and protocol-based normalization. This includes
       implementing the "remove_dot_segments" algorithm described in Section 5.2.3 of the RFC.

       This has a number of useful applications in allowing URIs to be compared with fewer false negatives. For
       example, all of the following URIs will normalize to the same value:

           HTTPS://www.example.com:443/../test/../foo/index.html
           https://WWW.EXAMPLE.COM/./foo/index.html
           https://www.example.com/%66%6f%6f/index.html
           https://www.example.com/foo/index.html

       That is, they will all be normalized into the last value.

</pre><h4><b>SUBROUTINES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>normalize_uri</b>
           $normal_uri = normalize_uri($uri);
           $normal_uri = normalize_uri($str);

       Given a URI object or a string, this routine basically just calls the "canonical" method and
       "remove_dot_segments" on the URI and returns the result as a URI object.

       The original URI is left unchanged.

   <b>remove_dot_segments</b>
           $clean_path_uri = remove_dot_segments($uri);
           $clean_path_uri = remove_dot_segments($str);

       Given a URI object or a string, this routine will remove dot segments (i.e, "."  and "..") from the path
       of the URI.

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
       As RFC 3986 notes, normalization is a tool used to help identify whether one URI is equivalent to
       another. This does not, however, imply that the resources identified by two URIs that are different byte-
       for-byte but normalize to the same value will be the same. For example, the presence of "<a href="file:/./">/./</a>" in the path
       might be significant to an implementation, or using octet-encoding (e.g., "%3a") instead of the character
       represented might represent a different actual resource. So use normalization judiciously.

       This implementation of normalization is far from comprehensive. There are many normalizations you may
       wish to perform. In that case, you may want to look into URL::Normalize, which provides a more
       comprehensive list of normalizations, some of which go against the letter of RFC 3986, but can be
       valuable in certain applications.

       This implementation does not include the full gamut of what is keeping with the letter of RFC 3986, but
       might be expanded to include additional normalizations in the future.

       If you know of a normalization that could be implemented here: patches welcome.
