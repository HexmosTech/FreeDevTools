       Tk_Window
       <b>Tk_CreateWindow</b>(<u>interp,</u> <u>parent,</u> <u>name,</u> <u>topLevScreen</u>)

       Tk_Window
       <b>Tk_CreateAnonymousWindow</b>(<u>interp,</u> <u>parent,</u> <u>topLevScreen</u>)

</pre><h4><b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Tcl_Interp <u>*interp</u> (out)               Tcl  interpreter  to use for error reporting.  If no error occurs,
                                              then <u>*interp</u> is not modified.

       Tk_Window <u>parent</u> (in)                  Token for the window that is to serve as the logical parent of the
                                              new window.

       const char <u>*name</u> (in)                  Name to use for this window.  Must be unique among all children of
                                              the same <u>parent</u>.

       const char <u>*topLevScreen</u> (in)          Has same format as  <u>screenName</u>.   If  NULL,  then  new  window  is
                                              created as an internal window.  If non-NULL, new window is created
                                              as  a top-level window on screen <u>topLevScreen</u>.  If <u>topLevScreen</u> is
                                              an empty string (“”) then  new  window  is  created  as  top-level
                                              window of <u>parent</u>'s screen.

       Tk_Window <u>tkwin</u> (in)                   Token for window.

       const char <u>*pathName</u> (in)              Name  of  new  window,  specified  as path name within application
                                              (e.g. <b>.a.b.c</b>).

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The procedures <b>Tk_CreateWindow</b>, <b>Tk_CreateAnonymousWindow</b>, and <b>Tk_CreateWindowFromPath</b> are used to  create
       new windows for use in Tk-based applications.  Each of the procedures returns a token that can be used to
       manipulate the window in other calls to the Tk library.  If the window could not be created successfully,
       then NULL is returned and the result of interpreter <u>interp</u> is modified to hold an error message.

       Tk  supports two different kinds of windows:  internal windows and top-level windows.  An internal window
       is an interior window of a Tk application, such as a scrollbar or menu bar or button.  A top-level window
       is one that is created as a child of a screen's root window, rather than as an interior window, but which
       is logically part of some existing main window.  Examples of  top-level  windows  are  pop-up  menus  and
       dialog boxes.

       New  windows  may  be created by calling <b>Tk_CreateWindow</b>.  If the <u>topLevScreen</u> argument is NULL, then the
       new window will be an internal window.  If <u>topLevScreen</u> is non-NULL, then the new window will be  a  top-
       level  window:  <u>topLevScreen</u> indicates the name of a screen and the new window will be created as a child
       of the root window of <u>topLevScreen</u>.  In either case Tk will consider the new window  to  be  the  logical
       child  of <u>parent</u>: the new window's path name will reflect this fact, options may be specified for the new
       window under this assumption, and so on.  The only difference is that new X window for a top-level window
       will not be a child of <u>parent</u>'s X window.  For example, a pull-down menu's <u>parent</u> would  be  the  button-
       like window used to invoke it, which would in turn be a child of the menu bar window.  A dialog box might
       have the application's main window as its parent.

       <b>Tk_CreateAnonymousWindow</b>  differs from <b>Tk_CreateWindow</b> in that it creates an unnamed window.  This window
       will be manipulatable only using C interfaces, and will not be visible to  Tcl  scripts.   Both  interior
       windows and top-level windows may be created with <b>Tk_CreateAnonymousWindow</b>.

       <b>Tk_CreateWindowFromPath</b>  offers  an  alternate way of specifying new windows.  In <b>Tk_CreateWindowFromPath</b>
       the new window is specified with a token for any window in the target application (<u>tkwin</u>),  plus  a  path
       name  for  the  new window.  It produces the same effect as <b>Tk_CreateWindow</b> and allows both top-level and
       internal  windows  to  be  created,  depending   on   the   value   of   <u>topLevScreen</u>.    In   calls   to
       <b>Tk_CreateWindowFromPath</b>,  as  in calls to <b>Tk_CreateWindow</b>, the parent of the new window must exist at the
       time of the call, but the new window must not already exist.

       The window creation procedures do not actually issue the command to X to create a window.  Instead,  they
       create  a  local  data  structure associated with the window and defer the creation of the X window.  The
       window will actually be created by the first call  to  <b>Tk_MapWindow</b>.   Deferred  window  creation  allows
       various  aspects  of  the  window  (such  as  its  size, background color, etc.) to be modified after its
       creation without incurring any overhead in the X server.  When the window is finally mapped  all  of  the
       window attributes can be set while creating the window.

       The  value returned by a window-creation procedure is not the X token for the window (it cannot be, since
       X has not been asked to create the window yet).  Instead, it is a token for Tk's local data structure for
       the window.  Most of the Tk library procedures take Tk_Window tokens, rather  than  X  identifiers.   The
       actual  X  window  identifier can be retrieved from the local data structure using the <b>Tk_WindowId</b> macro;
       see the manual entry for <b>Tk_WindowId</b> for details.

       <b>Tk_DestroyWindow</b> deletes a window and all the data structures associated with  it,  including  any  event
       handlers  created  with <b>Tk_CreateEventHandler</b>.  In addition, <b>Tk_DestroyWindow</b> will delete any children of
       <u>tkwin</u> recursively (where children are defined in the Tk  sense,  consisting  of  all  windows  that  were
       created with the given window as <u>parent</u>).  If <u>tkwin</u> is an internal window, then event handlers interested
       in  destroy  events  are  invoked  immediately.   If  <u>tkwin</u> is a top-level or main window, then the event
       handlers will be invoked later, after X has seen the request and returned an event for it.

       If a window has been created but has not been mapped, so no X window exists, it is possible to force  the
       creation  of  the  X  window  by  calling  <b>Tk_MakeWindowExist</b>.   This  procedure issues the X commands to
       instantiate the window given by <u>tkwin</u>.
