</pre><h4><b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Tcl_Interp <u>*interp</u> (in)            Interpreter in which to execute the script.  The interpreter's  result
                                          is modified to hold the result or error message from the script.

       Tcl_Obj <u>*objPtr</u> (in)               A Tcl value containing the script to execute.

       int <u>flags</u> (in)                     OR'ed  combination  of  flag  bits  that  specify  additional options.
                                          <b>TCL_EVAL_GLOBAL</b> and <b>TCL_EVAL_DIRECT</b> are currently supported.

       const char <u>*fileName</u> (in)          Name of a file containing a Tcl script.

       Tcl_Size <u>objc</u> (in)                 The number of values in the array pointed to by <u>objv</u>; this is also the
                                          number of words in the command.

       Tcl_Obj <u>**objv</u> (in)                Points to an array of pointers to values; each value holds  the  value
                                          of a single word in the command to execute.

       int <u>numBytes</u> (in)                  The  number  of  bytes  in  <u>script</u>, not including any null terminating
                                          character.  If -1, then all characters up to the first null  byte  are
                                          used.

       const char <u>*script</u> (in)            Points to first byte of script to execute (null-terminated and UTF-8).

       const char <u>*part</u> (in)              String forming part of a Tcl script.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  procedures described here are invoked to execute Tcl scripts in various forms.  <b>Tcl_EvalObjEx</b> is the
       core procedure and is used by many of the others.  It executes the  commands  in  the  script  stored  in
       <u>objPtr</u>  until  either  an  error  occurs  or the end of the script is reached.  If this is the first time
       <u>objPtr</u> has been executed, its commands are compiled into bytecode instructions which are  then  executed.
       The  bytecodes  are saved in <u>objPtr</u> so that the compilation step can be skipped if the value is evaluated
       again in the future.

       The return value from <b>Tcl_EvalObjEx</b> (and all the other procedures described here)  is  a  Tcl  completion
       code  with  one of the values <b>TCL_OK</b>, <b>TCL_ERROR</b>, <b>TCL_RETURN</b>, <b>TCL_BREAK</b>, or <b>TCL_CONTINUE</b>, or possibly some
       other integer value originating in an extension.  In addition, a result value or error message is left in
       <u>interp</u>'s result; it can be retrieved using <b>Tcl_GetObjResult</b>.

       <b>Tcl_EvalFile</b> reads the file given by <u>fileName</u> and evaluates its contents as a Tcl script.  It returns the
       same information as <b>Tcl_EvalObjEx</b>.  If the file could not be  read  then  a  Tcl  error  is  returned  to
       describe  why the file could not be read.  The eofchar for files is “\x1A” (^Z) for all platforms. If you
       require a “^Z” in code for string comparison, you can use “\x1A”, which will be safely substituted by the
       Tcl interpreter into “^Z”.

       <b>Tcl_EvalObjv</b> executes a single preparsed command instead of  a  script.   The  <u>objc</u>  and  <u>objv</u>  arguments
       contain  the  values  of  the  words  for  the Tcl command, one word in each value in <u>objv</u>.  <b>Tcl_EvalObjv</b>
       evaluates the command and returns a completion code and result just like <b>Tcl_EvalObjEx</b>.   The  caller  of
       <b>Tcl_EvalObjv</b>  has  to  manage  the  reference count of the elements of <u>objv</u>, insuring that the values are
       valid until <b>Tcl_EvalObjv</b> returns.

       <b>Tcl_Eval</b> is similar to <b>Tcl_EvalObjEx</b> except that the script to  be  executed  is  supplied  as  a  string
       instead of a value and no compilation occurs.  The string should be a proper UTF-8 string as converted by
       <b>Tcl_ExternalToUtfDString</b> or <b>Tcl_ExternalToUtf</b> when it is known to possibly contain upper ASCII characters
       whose  possible  combinations  might be a UTF-8 special code.  The string is parsed and executed directly
       (using <b>Tcl_EvalObjv</b>) instead of compiling it and executing the bytecodes.   In  situations  where  it  is
       known that the script will never be executed again, <b>Tcl_Eval</b> may be faster than <b>Tcl_EvalObjEx</b>.
        <b>Tcl_Eval</b> returns a completion code and result just like <b>Tcl_EvalObjEx</b>.

       <b>Tcl_EvalEx</b> is an extended version of <b>Tcl_Eval</b> that takes additional arguments <u>numBytes</u> and <u>flags</u>.

       <b>Tcl_GlobalEval</b>  and  <b>Tcl_GlobalEvalObj</b> are older procedures that are now deprecated.  They are similar to
       <b>Tcl_EvalEx</b> and <b>Tcl_EvalObjEx</b> except that the script is evaluated in the global namespace and its variable
       context consists of global variables only (it  ignores  any  Tcl  procedures  that  are  active).   These
       functions are equivalent to using the <b>TCL_EVAL_GLOBAL</b> flag (see below).

       <b>Tcl_VarEval</b>  takes  any number of string arguments of any length, concatenates them into a single string,
       then calls <b>Tcl_Eval</b> to execute that string as a Tcl command.  It returns the result of  the  command  and
       also  modifies the interpreter result in the same way as <b>Tcl_Eval</b>.  The last argument to <b>Tcl_VarEval</b> must
       be (char *)NULL to indicate the end of arguments.

</pre><h4><b>FLAG</b> <b>BITS</b></h4><pre>
       Any OR'ed combination of the following values may be used for the <u>flags</u> argument to  procedures  such  as
       <b>Tcl_EvalObjEx</b>:

       <b>TCL_EVAL_DIRECT</b>        This  flag  is  only used by <b>Tcl_EvalObjEx</b>; it is ignored by other procedures.  If
                              this flag bit is set, the script is not  compiled  to  bytecodes;  instead  it  is
                              executed directly as is done by <b>Tcl_EvalEx</b>.  The <b>TCL_EVAL_DIRECT</b> flag is useful in
                              situations  where  the contents of a value are going to change immediately, so the
                              bytecodes will not be reused in a future execution.  In this case, it is faster to
                              execute the script directly.

       <b>TCL_EVAL_GLOBAL</b>        If this flag is set, the script is evaluated in the global  namespace  instead  of
                              the  current  namespace and its variable context consists of global variables only
                              (it ignores any Tcl procedures that are active).

</pre><h4><b>MISCELLANEOUS</b> <b>DETAILS</b></h4><pre>
       During the processing of a Tcl command it is legal to make nested calls to evaluate other commands  (this
       is  how procedures and some control structures are implemented).  If a code other than <b>TCL_OK</b> is returned
       from a nested <b>Tcl_EvalObjEx</b> invocation, then the caller should normally return immediately, passing  that
       same  return  code  back  to  its  caller,  and  so on until the top-level application is reached.  A few
       commands, like <b>for</b>, will check for certain return codes, like <b>TCL_BREAK</b>  and  <b>TCL_CONTINUE</b>,  and  process
       them specially without returning.

       <b>Tcl_EvalObjEx</b>  keeps track of how many nested <b>Tcl_EvalObjEx</b> invocations are in progress for <u>interp</u>.  If a
       code of <b>TCL_RETURN</b>, <b>TCL_BREAK</b>, or <b>TCL_CONTINUE</b> is about to be returned  from  the  topmost  <b>Tcl_EvalObjEx</b>
       invocation  for  <u>interp</u>,  it  converts  the return code to <b>TCL_ERROR</b> and sets <u>interp</u>'s result to an error
       message indicating that the <b>return</b>, <b>break</b>, or <b>continue</b> command was invoked  in  an  inappropriate  place.
       This  means  that  top-level  applications  should  never see a return code from <b>Tcl_EvalObjEx</b> other than
       <b>TCL_OK</b> or <b>TCL_ERROR</b>.

</pre><h4><b>REFERENCE</b> <b>COUNT</b> <b>MANAGEMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Tcl_EvalObjEx</b> and <b>Tcl_GlobalEvalObj</b> both increment and decrement the  reference  count  of  their  <u>objPtr</u>
       argument;  you  must  not  pass  them  any value with a reference count of zero. They also manipulate the
       interpreter result; you must not count on the interpreter result to hold the reference count of any value
       over these calls.

       <b>Tcl_EvalObjv</b> may increment and decrement the reference count of any value passed via its  <u>objv</u>  argument;
       you  must  not  pass  any  value  with  a  reference  count  of  zero. This function also manipulates the
       interpreter result; you must not count on the interpreter result to hold the reference count of any value
       over this call.
