       zmq_socket - create 0MQ socket

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>void</b> <b>*zmq_socket</b> <b>(void</b> <u>*context</u><b>,</b> <b>int</b> <u>type</u><b>);</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>zmq_socket()</u> function shall create a 0MQ socket within the specified <u>context</u> and return an opaque
       handle to the newly created socket. The <u>type</u> argument specifies the socket type, which determines the
       semantics of communication over the socket.

       The newly created socket is initially unbound, and not associated with any endpoints. In order to
       establish a message flow a socket must first be connected to at least one endpoint with <b><a href="../man3/zmq_connect.3.html">zmq_connect</a></b>(3),
       or at least one endpoint must be created for accepting incoming connections with <b><a href="../man3/zmq_bind.3.html">zmq_bind</a></b>(3).

       <b>Key</b> <b>differences</b> <b>to</b> <b>conventional</b> <b>sockets</b>. Generally speaking, conventional sockets present a <u>synchronous</u>
       interface to either connection-oriented reliable byte streams (SOCK_STREAM), or connection-less
       unreliable datagrams (SOCK_DGRAM). In comparison, 0MQ sockets present an abstraction of an asynchronous
       <u>message</u> <u>queue</u>, with the exact queueing semantics depending on the socket type in use. Where conventional
       sockets transfer streams of bytes or discrete datagrams, 0MQ sockets transfer discrete <u>messages</u>.

       0MQ sockets being <u>asynchronous</u> means that the timings of the physical connection setup and tear down,
       reconnect and effective delivery are transparent to the user and organized by 0MQ itself. Further,
       messages may be <u>queued</u> in the event that a peer is unavailable to receive them.

       Conventional sockets allow only strict one-to-one (two peers), many-to-one (many clients, one server), or
       in some cases one-to-many (multicast) relationships. With the exception of <u>ZMQ_PAIR</u> and <u>ZMQ_CHANNEL</u>, 0MQ
       sockets may be connected <b>to</b> <b>multiple</b> <b>endpoints</b> using <u>zmq_connect()</u>, while simultaneously accepting
       incoming connections <b>from</b> <b>multiple</b> <b>endpoints</b> bound to the socket using <u>zmq_bind()</u>, thus allowing
       many-to-many relationships.

       <b>Thread</b> <b>safety</b>. 0MQ has both thread safe socket type and <u>not</u> thread safe socket types. Applications MUST
       NOT use a <u>not</u> thread safe socket from multiple threads under any circumstances. Doing so results in
       undefined behaviour.

       Following are the thread safe sockets: * ZMQ_CLIENT * ZMQ_SERVER * ZMQ_DISH * ZMQ_RADIO * ZMQ_SCATTER *
       ZMQ_GATHER * ZMQ_PEER * ZMQ_CHANNEL

       <b>Socket</b> <b>types</b>. The following sections present the socket types defined by 0MQ, grouped by the general
       <u>messaging</u> <u>pattern</u> which is built from related socket types.

   <b>Client-server</b> <b>pattern</b>
       The client-server pattern is used to allow a single <u>ZMQ_SERVER</u> <u>server</u> talk to one or more <u>ZMQ_CLIENT</u>
       <u>clients</u>. The client always starts the conversation, after which either peer can send messages
       asynchronously, to the other.

       The client-server pattern is formally defined by <b><a href="http://rfc.zeromq.org/spec">http://rfc.zeromq.org/spec</a>:41</b>.

           <b>Note</b>

           Server-client is still in draft phase.

       <b>ZMQ_CLIENT</b>

           A <u>ZMQ_CLIENT</u> socket talks to a <u>ZMQ_SERVER</u> socket. Either peer can connect, though the usual and
           recommended model is to bind the <u>ZMQ_SERVER</u> and connect the <u>ZMQ_CLIENT</u>.

           If the <u>ZMQ_CLIENT</u> socket has established a connection, <b><a href="../man3/zmq_send.3.html">zmq_send</a></b>(3) will accept messages, queue them,
           and send them as rapidly as the network allows. The outgoing buffer limit is defined by the high
           water mark for the socket. If the outgoing buffer is full, or, for connection-oriented transports, if
           the ZMQ_IMMEDIATE option is set and there is no connected peer, <b><a href="../man3/zmq_send.3.html">zmq_send</a></b>(3) will block. The
           <u>ZMQ_CLIENT</u> socket will not drop messages.

           When a <u>ZMQ_CLIENT</u> socket is connected to multiple <u>ZMQ_SERVER</u> sockets, outgoing messages are
           distributed between connected peers on a round-robin basis. Likewise, the <u>ZMQ_CLIENT</u> socket receives
           messages fairly from each connected peer. This usage is sensible only for stateless protocols.

           <u>ZMQ_CLIENT</u> sockets are threadsafe and can be used from multiple threads at the same time. Note that
           replies from a <u>ZMQ_SERVER</u> socket will go to the first client thread that calls <b><a href="../man3/zmq_msg_recv.3.html">zmq_msg_recv</a></b>(3). If
           you need to get replies back to the originating thread, use one <u>ZMQ_CLIENT</u> socket per thread.

               <b>Note</b>

               <u>ZMQ_CLIENT</u> sockets are threadsafe. They do not accept the ZMQ_SNDMORE option on sends not
               ZMQ_RCVMORE on receives. This limits them to single part data. The intention is to extend the API
               to allow scatter/gather of multi-part data.

       <b>ZMQ_SERVER</b>

           A <u>ZMQ_SERVER</u> socket talks to a set of <u>ZMQ_CLIENT</u> sockets. A <u>ZMQ_SERVER</u> socket can only reply to an
           incoming message: the <u>ZMQ_CLIENT</u> peer must always initiate a conversation.

           Each received message has a <u>routing_id</u> that is a 32-bit unsigned integer. The application can fetch
           this with <b><a href="../man3/zmq_msg_routing_id.3.html">zmq_msg_routing_id</a></b>(3). To send a message to a given <u>ZMQ_CLIENT</u> peer the application must
           set the peerâ€™s <u>routing_id</u> on the message, using <b><a href="../man3/zmq_msg_set_routing_id.3.html">zmq_msg_set_routing_id</a></b>(3).

           If the <u>routing_id</u> is not specified, or does not refer to a connected client peer, the send call will
           fail with EHOSTUNREACH. If the outgoing buffer for the client peer is full, the send call shall
           block, unless ZMQ_DONTWAIT is used in the send, in which case it shall fail with EAGAIN. The
           <u>ZMQ_SERVER</u> socket shall not drop messages in any case.

               <b>Note</b>

               <u>ZMQ_SERVER</u> sockets are threadsafe. They do not accept the ZMQ_SNDMORE option on sends not
               ZMQ_RCVMORE on receives. This limits them to single part data. The intention is to extend the API

   <b>Radio-dish</b> <b>pattern</b>
       The radio-dish pattern is used for one-to-many distribution of data from a single <u>publisher</u> to multiple
       <u>subscribers</u> in a fan out fashion.

       Radio-dish is using groups (vs Pub-sub topics), Dish sockets can join a group and each message sent by
       Radio sockets belong to a group.

       Groups are null terminated strings limited to 16 chars length (including null). The intention is to
       increase the length to 40 chars (including null). The encoding of groups shall be UTF8.

       Groups are matched using exact matching (vs prefix matching of PubSub).

           <b>Note</b>

           Radio-dish is still in draft phase.

       <b>ZMQ_RADIO</b>

           A socket of type <u>ZMQ_RADIO</u> is used by a <u>publisher</u> to distribute data. Each message belong to a group,
           a group is specified with <b><a href="../man3/zmq_msg_set_group.3.html">zmq_msg_set_group</a></b>(3). Messages are distributed to all members of a group.
           The <b><a href="../man3/zmq_recv.3.html">zmq_recv</a></b>(3) function is not implemented for this socket type.

           When a <u>ZMQ_RADIO</u> socket enters the <u>mute</u> state due to having reached the high water mark for a
           <u>subscriber</u>, then any messages that would be sent to the <u>subscriber</u> in question shall instead be
           dropped until the mute state ends. The <u>zmq_send()</u> function shall never block for this socket type.

           A socket of type <u>ZMQ_PAIR</u> can only be connected to a single peer at any one time. No message routing
           or filtering is performed on messages sent over a <u>ZMQ_PAIR</u> socket.

           When a <u>ZMQ_PAIR</u> socket enters the <u>mute</u> state due to having reached the high water mark for the
           connected peer, or, for connection-oriented transports, if the ZMQ_IMMEDIATE option is set and there
           is no connected peer, then any <b><a href="../man3/zmq_send.3.html">zmq_send</a></b>(3) operations on the socket shall block until the peer
           becomes available for sending; messages are not discarded.

           While <u>ZMQ_PAIR</u> sockets can be used over transports other than <b><a href="../man7/zmq_inproc.7.html">zmq_inproc</a></b>(7), their inability to
           auto-reconnect coupled with the fact new incoming connections will be terminated while any previous
           connections (including ones in a closing state) exist makes them unsuitable for TCP in most cases.

               <b>Note</b>

               <u>ZMQ_PAIR</u> sockets are designed for inter-thread communication across the <b><a href="../man7/zmq_inproc.7.html">zmq_inproc</a></b>(7) transport

   <b>Peer-to-peer</b> <b>pattern</b>
       The peer-to-peer pattern is used to connect a peer to multiple peers. Peer can both connect and bind and
       mix both of them with the same socket. The peer-to-peer pattern is useful to build peer-to-peer networks
       (e.g zyre, bitcoin, torrent) where a peer can both accept connections from other peers or connect to
       them.

           <b>Note</b>

           Peer-to-peer is still in draft phase.

       <b>ZMQ_PEER</b>

           A <u>ZMQ_PEER</u> socket talks to a set of <u>ZMQ_PEER</u> sockets.

           To connect and fetch the <u>routing_id</u> of the peer use <b><a href="../man3/zmq_connect_peer.3.html">zmq_connect_peer</a></b>(3).

           Each received message has a <u>routing_id</u> that is a 32-bit unsigned integer. The application can fetch
           this with <b><a href="../man3/zmq_msg_routing_id.3.html">zmq_msg_routing_id</a></b>(3).

           To send a message to a given <u>ZMQ_PEER</u> peer the application must set the peerâ€™s <u>routing_id</u> on the
           message, using <b><a href="../man3/zmq_msg_set_routing_id.3.html">zmq_msg_set_routing_id</a></b>(3).

           If the <u>routing_id</u> is not specified, or does not refer to a connected client peer, the send call will
           fail with EHOSTUNREACH. If the outgoing buffer for the peer is full, the send call shall block,
           unless ZMQ_DONTWAIT is used in the send, in which case it shall fail with EAGAIN. The <u>ZMQ_PEER</u> socket
           shall not drop messages in any case.

               <b>Note</b>

               <u>ZMQ_PEER</u> sockets are threadsafe. They do not accept the ZMQ_SNDMORE option on sends not
               ZMQ_RCVMORE on receives. This limits them to single part data.

           Channel pattern

               The channel pattern is the thread-safe version of the exclusive pair pattern.
               The channel pattern is used to connect a peer to precisely one other
               peer. This pattern is used for inter-thread communication across the inproc
               transport.

               NOTE: Channel is still in draft phase.

               ZMQ_CHANNEL
               ^^^^^^^^
               A socket of type 'ZMQ_CHANNEL' can only be connected to a single peer at any one
               time.  No message routing or filtering is performed on messages sent over a
               'ZMQ_CHANNEL' socket.

               When a 'ZMQ_CHANNEL' socket enters the 'mute' state due to having reached the
               high water mark for the connected peer, or, for connection-oriented transports,
               if the ZMQ_IMMEDIATE option is set and there is no connected peer, then
               any linkzmq:zmq_send[3] operations on the socket shall block until the peer
               becomes available for sending; messages are not discarded.

               While 'ZMQ_CHANNEL' sockets can be used over transports other than linkzmq:zmq_inproc[7],
               their inability to auto-reconnect coupled with the fact new incoming connections will
               be terminated while any previous connections (including ones in a closing state)
               exist makes them unsuitable for TCP in most cases.

               NOTE: 'ZMQ_CHANNEL' sockets are designed for inter-thread communication across
               the linkzmq:zmq_inproc[7] transport and do not implement functionality such
               as auto-reconnection.

               NOTE: 'ZMQ_CHANNEL' sockets are threadsafe. They do not accept ZMQ_RCVMORE on receives.
               This limits them to single part data.

               Native Pattern

           The native pattern is used for communicating with TCP peers and allows asynchronous requests and
           replies in either direction.

       <b>ZMQ_STREAM</b>

           A socket of type <u>ZMQ_STREAM</u> is used to send and receive TCP data from a non-0MQ peer, when using the
           tcp:// transport. A <u>ZMQ_STREAM</u> socket can act as client and/or server, sending and/or receiving TCP
           data asynchronously.

           When receiving TCP data, a <u>ZMQ_STREAM</u> socket shall prepend a message part containing the <u>routing</u> <u>id</u>
           of the originating peer to the message before passing it to the application. Messages received are
           fair-queued from among all connected peers.

           When sending TCP data, a <u>ZMQ_STREAM</u> socket shall remove the first part of the message and use it to
           determine the <u>routing</u> <u>id</u> of the peer the message shall be routed to, and unroutable messages shall
           cause an EHOSTUNREACH or EAGAIN error.

           To open a connection to a server, use the zmq_connect call, and then fetch the socket routing id
           using the zmq_getsockopt call with the ZMQ_ROUTING_ID option.

           To close a specific connection, send the routing id frame followed by a zero-length message (see
           EXAMPLE section).

           When a connection is made, a zero-length message will be received by the application. Similarly, when
           the peer disconnects (or the connection is lost), a zero-length message will be received by the
           application.

           You must send one routing id frame followed by one data frame. The ZMQ_SNDMORE flag is required for
           routing id frames but is ignored on data frames.

   <b>Request-reply</b> <b>pattern</b>
       The request-reply pattern is used for sending requests from a ZMQ_REQ <u>client</u> to one or more ZMQ_REP
       <u>services</u>, and receiving subsequent replies to each request sent.

       The request-reply pattern is formally defined by <b><a href="http://rfc.zeromq.org/spec">http://rfc.zeromq.org/spec</a>:28</b>.

       <b>ZMQ_REQ</b>

           A socket of type <u>ZMQ_REQ</u> is used by a <u>client</u> to send requests to and receive replies from a <u>service</u>.
           This socket type allows only an alternating sequence of <u>zmq_send(request)</u> and subsequent
           <u>zmq_recv(reply)</u> calls. Each request sent is round-robined among all <u>services</u>, and each reply received
           is matched with the last issued request.

           For connection-oriented transports, If the ZMQ_IMMEDIATE option is set and there is no service
           available, then any send operation on the socket shall block until at least one <u>service</u> becomes
           available. The REQ socket shall not discard messages.

       <b>ZMQ_DEALER</b>

           A socket of type <u>ZMQ_DEALER</u> is an advanced pattern used for extending request/reply sockets. Each
           message sent is round-robined among all connected peers, and each message received is fair-queued
           from all connected peers.

           When a <u>ZMQ_DEALER</u> socket enters the <u>mute</u> state due to having reached the high water mark for all
           peers, or, for connection-oriented transports, if the ZMQ_IMMEDIATE option is set and there are no

           at least one peer becomes available for sending; messages are not discarded.

           When a <u>ZMQ_DEALER</u> socket is connected to a <u>ZMQ_REP</u> socket each message sent must consist of an empty

       <b>ZMQ_ROUTER</b>

           A socket of type <u>ZMQ_ROUTER</u> is an advanced socket type used for extending request/reply sockets. When
           receiving messages a <u>ZMQ_ROUTER</u> socket shall prepend a message part containing the <u>routing</u> <u>id</u> of the
           originating peer to the message before passing it to the application. Messages received are
           fair-queued from among all connected peers. When sending messages a <u>ZMQ_ROUTER</u> socket shall remove
           the first part of the message and use it to determine the _routing id _ of the peer the message shall
           be routed to. If the peer does not exist anymore, or has never existed, the message shall be silently
           discarded. However, if <u>ZMQ_ROUTER_MANDATORY</u> socket option is set to <u>1</u>, the socket shall fail with
           EHOSTUNREACH in both cases.

           When a <u>ZMQ_ROUTER</u> socket enters the <u>mute</u> state due to having reached the high water mark for all
           peers, then any messages sent to the socket shall be dropped until the mute state ends. Likewise, any
           messages routed to a peer for which the individual high water mark has been reached shall also be
           dropped. If, <u>ZMQ_ROUTER_MANDATORY</u> is set to <u>1</u>, the socket shall block or return EAGAIN in both cases.

           When a <u>ZMQ_ROUTER</u> socket has <u>ZMQ_ROUTER_MANDATORY</u> flag set to <u>1</u>, the socket shall generate <u>ZMQ_POLLIN</u>
           events upon reception of messages from one or more peers. Likewise, the socket shall generate
           <u>ZMQ_POLLOUT</u> events when at least one message can be sent to one or more peers.

           When a <u>ZMQ_REQ</u> socket is connected to a <u>ZMQ_ROUTER</u> socket, in addition to the <u>routing</u> <u>id</u> of the
           originating peer each message received shall contain an empty <u>delimiter</u> message part. Hence, the
           entire structure of each received message as seen by the application becomes: one or more <u>routing</u> <u>id</u>
           parts, <u>delimiter</u> part, one or more <u>body</u> <u>parts</u>. When sending replies to a <u>ZMQ_REQ</u> socket the
           application must include the <u>delimiter</u> part.
