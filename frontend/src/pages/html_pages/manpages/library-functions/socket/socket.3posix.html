</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       socket — create an endpoint for communication

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;

       int socket(int <u>domain</u>, int <u>type</u>, int <u>protocol</u>);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>socket</u>()  function  shall  create  an  unbound  socket in a communications domain, and return a file
       descriptor that can be used in later function calls that operate on sockets. The file descriptor shall be
       allocated as described in <u>Section</u> <u>2.14</u>, <u>File</u> <u>Descriptor</u> <u>Allocation</u>.

       The <u>socket</u>() function takes the following arguments:

       <u>domain</u>      Specifies the communications domain in which a socket is to be created.

       <u>type</u>        Specifies the type of socket to be created.

       <u>protocol</u>    Specifies a particular protocol to be used with the socket. Specifying a <u>protocol</u> of 0 causes
                   <u>socket</u>() to use an unspecified default protocol appropriate for the requested socket type.

       The <u>domain</u> argument specifies the address family used in the communications domain. The address  families
       supported by the system are implementation-defined.

       Symbolic constants that can be used for the domain argument are defined in the <u>&lt;sys/socket.h&gt;</u> header.

       The  <u>type</u>  argument  specifies  the socket type, which determines the semantics of communication over the
       socket. The following socket types are defined; implementations may specify additional socket types:

       SOCK_STREAM Provides sequenced, reliable, bidirectional, connection-mode byte streams, and may provide  a
                   transmission mechanism for out-of-band data.

       SOCK_DGRAM  Provides  datagrams,  which  are  connectionless-mode,  unreliable  messages of fixed maximum
                   length.

       SOCK_SEQPACKET
                   Provides sequenced, reliable, bidirectional, connection-mode transmission paths for  records.
                   A record can be sent using one or more output operations and received using one or more input
                   operations,  but  a  single  operation  never  transfers part of more than one record. Record
                   boundaries are visible to the receiver via the MSG_EOR flag.

       If the <u>protocol</u> argument is non-zero, it shall specify a  protocol  that  is  supported  by  the  address
       family.  If the <u>protocol</u> argument is zero, the default protocol for this address family and type shall be
       used. The protocols supported by the system are implementation-defined.

       The process may need to have appropriate privileges to use  the  <u>socket</u>()  function  or  to  create  some
       sockets.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       Upon  successful  completion,  <u>socket</u>()  shall return a non-negative integer, the socket file descriptor.
       Otherwise, a value of -1 shall be returned and <u>errno</u> set to indicate the error.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>socket</u>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EAFNOSUPPORT</b>
              The implementation does not support the specified address family.

       <b>EMFILE</b> All file descriptors available to the process are currently open.

       <b>ENFILE</b> No more file descriptors are available for the system.

       <b>EPROTONOSUPPORT</b>
              The protocol is not supported by the address family, or the  protocol  is  not  supported  by  the
              implementation.

       <b>EPROTOTYPE</b>
              The socket type is not supported by the protocol.

       The <u>socket</u>() function may fail if:

       <b>EACCES</b> The process does not have appropriate privileges.

       <b>ENOBUFS</b>
              Insufficient resources were available in the system to perform the operation.

       <b>ENOMEM</b> Insufficient memory was available to fulfill the request.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       The  documentation  for specific address families specifies which protocols each address family supports.
       The documentation for specific protocols specifies which socket types each protocol supports.

       The application can determine whether an address family is supported by trying to create  a  socket  with
       <u>domain</u> set to the protocol in question.

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>FUTURE</b> <b>DIRECTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       None.
