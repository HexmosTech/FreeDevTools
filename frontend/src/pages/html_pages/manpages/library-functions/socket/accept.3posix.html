</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       accept — accept a new connection on a socket

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;

       int accept(int <u>socket</u>, struct sockaddr *restrict <u>address</u>,
           socklen_t *restrict <u>address_len</u>);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>accept</u>()  function  shall extract the first connection on the queue of pending connections, create a
       new socket with the same socket type protocol and address family as the specified socket, and allocate  a
       new file descriptor for that socket. The file descriptor shall be allocated as described in <u>Section</u> <u>2.14</u>,
       <u>File</u> <u>Descriptor</u> <u>Allocation</u>.

       The <u>accept</u>() function takes the following arguments:

       <u>socket</u>      Specifies  a socket that was created with <u>socket</u>(), has been bound to an address with <u>bind</u>(),
                   and has issued a successful call to <u>listen</u>().

       <u>address</u>     Either a null pointer, or a pointer  to  a  <b>sockaddr</b>  structure  where  the  address  of  the
                   connecting socket shall be returned.

       <u>address_len</u> Either a null pointer, if <u>address</u> is a null pointer, or a pointer to a <b>socklen_t</b> object which
                   on input specifies the length of the supplied <b>sockaddr</b> structure, and on output specifies the
                   length of the stored address.

       If  <u>address</u> is not a null pointer, the address of the peer for the accepted connection shall be stored in
       the <b>sockaddr</b> structure pointed to by <u>address</u>, and the length of this  address  shall  be  stored  in  the
       object pointed to by <u>address_len</u>.

       If  the  actual  length of the address is greater than the length of the supplied <b>sockaddr</b> structure, the
       stored address shall be truncated.

       If the protocol permits connections by unbound clients, and the peer is not bound, then the value  stored
       in the object pointed to by <u>address</u> is unspecified.

       If  the listen queue is empty of connection requests and O_NONBLOCK is not set on the file descriptor for
       the socket, <u>accept</u>() shall block until a connection is  present.  If  the  <u>listen</u>()  queue  is  empty  of
       connection  requests and O_NONBLOCK is set on the file descriptor for the socket, <u>accept</u>() shall fail and
       set <u>errno</u> to <b>[EAGAIN]</b> or <b>[EWOULDBLOCK]</b>.

       The accepted socket cannot itself accept more connections. The  original  socket  remains  open  and  can
       accept more connections.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       Upon  successful  completion,  <u>accept</u>()  shall  return  the  non-negative file descriptor of the accepted
       socket.  Otherwise, -1 shall be returned, <u>errno</u> shall be set  to  indicate  the  error,  and  any  object
       pointed to by <u>address_len</u> shall remain unchanged.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>accept</u>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EAGAIN</b> or <b>EWOULDBLOCK</b>
              O_NONBLOCK is set for the socket file descriptor and no connections are present to be accepted.

       <b>EBADF</b>  The <u>socket</u> argument is not a valid file descriptor.

       <b>ECONNABORTED</b>
              A connection has been aborted.

       <b>EINTR</b>  The  <u>accept</u>()  function  was  interrupted  by  a  signal that was caught before a valid connection
              arrived.

       <b>EINVAL</b> The <u>socket</u> is not accepting connections.

       <b>EMFILE</b> All file descriptors available to the process are currently open.

       <b>ENFILE</b> The maximum number of file descriptors in the system are already open.

       <b>ENOBUFS</b>
              No buffer space is available.

       <b>ENOMEM</b> There was insufficient memory available to complete the operation.

       <b>ENOTSOCK</b>
              The <u>socket</u> argument does not refer to a socket.

       <b>EOPNOTSUPP</b>
              The socket type of the specified socket does not support accepting connections.

       The <u>accept</u>() function may fail if:

       <b>EPROTO</b> A protocol error has occurred; for example, the STREAMS protocol stack has not been initialized.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       When a connection is available, <u>select</u>() indicates that the file descriptor for the socket is  ready  for
       reading.

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>FUTURE</b> <b>DIRECTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       None.
