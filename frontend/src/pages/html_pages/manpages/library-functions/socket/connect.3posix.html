</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       connect — connect a socket

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;

       int connect(int <u>socket</u>, const struct sockaddr *<u>address</u>,
           socklen_t <u>address_len</u>);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>connect</u>() function shall attempt to make a connection on a connection-mode socket or to set or reset
       the peer address of a connectionless-mode socket. The function takes the following arguments:

       <u>socket</u>      Specifies the file descriptor associated with the socket.

       <u>address</u>     Points to a <b>sockaddr</b> structure containing the peer address. The  length  and  format  of  the
                   address depend on the address family of the socket.

       <u>address_len</u> Specifies the length of the <b>sockaddr</b> structure pointed to by the <u>address</u> argument.

       If the socket has not already been bound to a local address, <u>connect</u>() shall bind it to an address which,
       unless the socket's address family is AF_UNIX, is an unused local address.

       If  the initiating socket is not connection-mode, then <u>connect</u>() shall set the socket's peer address, and
       no connection is made. For SOCK_DGRAM sockets, the peer address identifies where all datagrams  are  sent
       on  subsequent  <u>send</u>()  functions,  and  limits the remote sender for subsequent <u>recv</u>() functions. If the
       <u>sa_family</u> member of <u>address</u> is AF_UNSPEC, the socket's peer address shall be reset. Note that despite  no
       connection  being made, the term ``connected'' is used to describe a connectionless-mode socket for which
       a peer address has been set.

       If the initiating socket is connection-mode, then <u>connect</u>() shall attempt to establish  a  connection  to
       the  address  specified  by the <u>address</u> argument. If the connection cannot be established immediately and
       O_NONBLOCK is not set for the file descriptor for  the  socket,  <u>connect</u>()  shall  block  for  up  to  an
       unspecified  timeout interval until the connection is established. If the timeout interval expires before
       the connection is established, <u>connect</u>() shall fail and the  connection  attempt  shall  be  aborted.  If
       <u>connect</u>()  is  interrupted  by  a  signal that is caught while blocked waiting to establish a connection,
       <u>connect</u>() shall fail and set <u>errno</u> to <b>[EINTR]</b>, but the connection request shall not be aborted,  and  the
       connection shall be established asynchronously.

       If the connection cannot be established immediately and O_NONBLOCK is set for the file descriptor for the
       socket,  <u>connect</u>()  shall  fail  and  set <u>errno</u> to <b>[EINPROGRESS]</b>, but the connection request shall not be
       aborted, and the connection shall be established asynchronously. Subsequent calls to  <u>connect</u>()  for  the
       same socket, before the connection is established, shall fail and set <u>errno</u> to <b>[EALREADY]</b>.

       When  the  connection has been established asynchronously, <u>pselect</u>(), <u>select</u>(), and <u>poll</u>() shall indicate
       that the file descriptor for the socket is ready for writing.

       The socket in use may require the process to have appropriate privileges to use the <u>connect</u>() function.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       Upon successful completion, <u>connect</u>() shall return 0; otherwise, -1 shall be returned and  <u>errno</u>  set  to
       indicate the error.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>connect</u>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EADDRNOTAVAIL</b>
              The specified address is not available from the local machine.

       <b>EAFNOSUPPORT</b>
              The specified address is not a valid address for the address family of the specified socket.

       <b>EALREADY</b>
              A connection request is already in progress for the specified socket.

       <b>EBADF</b>  The <u>socket</u> argument is not a valid file descriptor.

       <b>ECONNREFUSED</b>
              The target address was not listening for connections or refused the connection request.

       <b>EINPROGRESS</b>
              O_NONBLOCK  is set for the file descriptor for the socket and the connection cannot be immediately
              established; the connection shall be established asynchronously.

       <b>EINTR</b>  The attempt to establish a connection was interrupted by delivery of a signal that was caught; the
              connection shall be established asynchronously.

       <b>EISCONN</b>
              The specified socket is connection-mode and is already connected.

       <b>ENETUNREACH</b>
              No route to the network is present.

       <b>ENOTSOCK</b>
              The <u>socket</u> argument does not refer to a socket.

       <b>EPROTOTYPE</b>
              The specified address has a different type than the socket bound to the specified peer address.

       <b>ETIMEDOUT</b>
              The attempt to connect timed out before a connection was made.

       If the address family of the socket is AF_UNIX, then <u>connect</u>() shall fail if:

       <b>EIO</b>    An I/O error occurred while reading from or writing to the file system.

       <b>ELOOP</b>  A loop exists in symbolic links encountered during resolution of the pathname in <u>address</u>.

       <b>ENAMETOOLONG</b>
              The length of a component of a pathname is longer than {NAME_MAX}.

       <b>ENOENT</b> A component of the pathname does not name an existing file or the pathname is an empty string.

       <b>ENOTDIR</b>
              A component of the path prefix of the pathname in <u>address</u> names an existing file that is neither a
              directory nor a symbolic link to a directory, or the pathname in <u>address</u>  contains  at  least  one
              non-&lt;slash&gt;  character and ends with one or more trailing &lt;slash&gt; characters and the last pathname
              component names an existing file that is neither a directory nor a symbolic link to a directory.

       The <u>connect</u>() function may fail if:

       <b>EACCES</b> Search permission is denied for a component of the path prefix;  or  write  access  to  the  named
              socket is denied.

       <b>EADDRINUSE</b>
              Attempt to establish a connection that uses addresses that are already in use.

       <b>ECONNRESET</b>
              Remote host reset the connection request.

       <b>EHOSTUNREACH</b>
              The  destination  host  cannot  be  reached  (probably because the host is down or a remote router
              cannot reach it).

       <b>EINVAL</b> The <u>address_len</u> argument is not a valid length for the address family; or invalid  address  family
              in the <b>sockaddr</b> structure.

       <b>ELOOP</b>  More  than  {SYMLOOP_MAX}  symbolic  links  were  encountered during resolution of the pathname in
              <u>address</u>.

       <b>ENAMETOOLONG</b>
              The length of a pathname exceeds {PATH_MAX}, or pathname resolution of a symbolic link produced an
              intermediate result with a length that exceeds {PATH_MAX}.

       <b>ENETDOWN</b>
              The local network interface used to reach the destination is down.

       <b>ENOBUFS</b>
              No buffer space is available.

       <b>EOPNOTSUPP</b>
              The socket is listening and cannot be connected.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       If <u>connect</u>() fails, the state of the socket is unspecified. Conforming applications should close the file
       descriptor and create a new socket before attempting to reconnect.

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>FUTURE</b> <b>DIRECTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       None.
