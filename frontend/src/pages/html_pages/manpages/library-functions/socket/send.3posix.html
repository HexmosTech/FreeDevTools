</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       send — send a message on a socket

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;

       ssize_t send(int <u>socket</u>, const void *<u>buffer</u>, size_t <u>length</u>, int <u>flags</u>);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>send</u>()  function shall initiate transmission of a message from the specified socket to its peer. The
       <u>send</u>() function  shall  send  a  message  only  when  the  socket  is  connected.  If  the  socket  is  a
       connectionless-mode socket, the message shall be sent to the pre-specified peer address.

       The <u>send</u>() function takes the following arguments:

       <u>socket</u>      Specifies the socket file descriptor.

       <u>buffer</u>      Points to the buffer containing the message to send.

       <u>length</u>      Specifies the length of the message in bytes.

       <u>flags</u>       Specifies  the  type of message transmission. Values of this argument are formed by logically
                   OR'ing zero or more of the following flags:

                   MSG_EOR       Terminates a record (if supported by the protocol).

                   MSG_OOB       Sends out-of-band data on sockets that support out-of-band communications.  The
                                 significance and semantics of out-of-band data are protocol-specific.

                   MSG_NOSIGNAL  Requests  not  to  send  the  SIGPIPE signal if an attempt to send is made on a
                                 stream-oriented socket that is no longer connected.  The  <b>[EPIPE]</b>  error  shall
                                 still be returned.

       The  length  of the message to be sent is specified by the <u>length</u> argument. If the message is too long to
       pass through the underlying protocol, <u>send</u>() shall fail and no data shall be transmitted.

       Successful completion of a call to <u>send</u>() does not guarantee delivery of the message. A return  value  of
       -1 indicates only locally-detected errors.

       If  space  is  not  available at the sending socket to hold the message to be transmitted, and the socket
       file descriptor does not have O_NONBLOCK set, <u>send</u>() shall block until space is available.  If  space  is
       not available at the sending socket to hold the message to be transmitted, and the socket file descriptor
       does  have  O_NONBLOCK set, <u>send</u>() shall fail. The <u>select</u>() and <u>poll</u>() functions can be used to determine
       when it is possible to send more data.

       The socket in use may require the process to have appropriate privileges to use the <u>send</u>() function.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       Upon successful completion, <u>send</u>() shall return the number of bytes sent. Otherwise, -1 shall be returned
       and <u>errno</u> set to indicate the error.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>send</u>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EAGAIN</b> or <b>EWOULDBLOCK</b>
              The socket's file descriptor is marked O_NONBLOCK and the requested operation would block.

       <b>EBADF</b>  The <u>socket</u> argument is not a valid file descriptor.

       <b>ECONNRESET</b>
              A connection was forcibly closed by a peer.

       <b>EDESTADDRREQ</b>
              The socket is not connection-mode and no peer address is set.

       <b>EINTR</b>  A signal interrupted <u>send</u>() before any data was transmitted.

       <b>EMSGSIZE</b>
              The message is too large to be sent all at once, as the socket requires.

       <b>ENOTCONN</b>
              The socket is not connected.

       <b>ENOTSOCK</b>
              The <u>socket</u> argument does not refer to a socket.

       <b>EOPNOTSUPP</b>
              The <u>socket</u> argument is associated with a socket that does not support one or more  of  the  values
              set in <u>flags</u>.

       <b>EPIPE</b>  The  socket is shut down for writing, or the socket is connection-mode and is no longer connected.
              In the latter case,  and  if  the  socket  is  of  type  SOCK_STREAM  or  SOCK_SEQPACKET  and  the
              MSG_NOSIGNAL flag is not set, the SIGPIPE signal is generated to the calling thread.

       The <u>send</u>() function may fail if:

       <b>EACCES</b> The calling process does not have appropriate privileges.

       <b>EIO</b>    An I/O error occurred while reading from or writing to the file system.

       <b>ENETDOWN</b>
              The local network interface used to reach the destination is down.

       <b>ENETUNREACH</b>
              No route to the network is present.

       <b>ENOBUFS</b>
              Insufficient resources were available in the system to perform the operation.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       If  the <u>socket</u> argument refers to a connection-mode socket, the <u>send</u>() function is equivalent to <u>sendto</u>()
       (with any value for the <u>dest_addr</u> and <u>dest_len</u> arguments, as they are  ignored  in  this  case).  If  the
       <u>socket</u>  argument  refers  to  a  socket and the <u>flags</u> argument is 0, the <u>send</u>() function is equivalent to
       <u>write</u>().

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>FUTURE</b> <b>DIRECTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       None.
