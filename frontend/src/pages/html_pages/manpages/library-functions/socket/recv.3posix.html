</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       recv — receive a message from a connected socket

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;

       ssize_t recv(int <u>socket</u>, void *<u>buffer</u>, size_t <u>length</u>, int <u>flags</u>);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>recv</u>()  function shall receive a message from a connection-mode or connectionless-mode socket. It is
       normally used with connected sockets because it does not permit the application to  retrieve  the  source
       address of received data.

       The <u>recv</u>() function takes the following arguments:

       <u>socket</u>    Specifies the socket file descriptor.

       <u>buffer</u>    Points to a buffer where the message should be stored.

       <u>length</u>    Specifies the length in bytes of the buffer pointed to by the <u>buffer</u> argument.

       <u>flags</u>     Specifies the type of message reception. Values of this argument are formed by logically OR'ing
                 zero or more of the following values:

                 MSG_PEEK    Peeks  at an incoming message. The data is treated as unread and the next <u>recv</u>() or
                             similar function shall still return this data.

                 MSG_OOB     Requests out-of-band data. The significance and semantics of out-of-band  data  are
                             protocol-specific.

                 MSG_WAITALL On  SOCK_STREAM sockets this requests that the function block until the full amount
                             of data can be returned. The function may return the smaller amount of data if  the
                             socket  is  a  message-based  socket,  if  a signal is caught, if the connection is
                             terminated, if MSG_PEEK was specified, or if an error is pending for the socket.

       The <u>recv</u>() function shall return the length of the message written to the buffer pointed to by the <u>buffer</u>
       argument. For message-based sockets, such as SOCK_DGRAM and SOCK_SEQPACKET, the entire message  shall  be
       read  in a single operation.  If a message is too long to fit in the supplied buffer, and MSG_PEEK is not
       set in the <u>flags</u> argument, the excess bytes  shall  be  discarded.  For  stream-based  sockets,  such  as
       SOCK_STREAM,  message  boundaries  shall  be ignored. In this case, data shall be returned to the user as
       soon as it becomes available, and no data shall be discarded.

       If the MSG_WAITALL flag is not set, data shall be returned only up to the end of the first message.

       If no messages are available at the socket and O_NONBLOCK is not set on  the  socket's  file  descriptor,
       <u>recv</u>()  shall block until a message arrives. If no messages are available at the socket and O_NONBLOCK is
       set on the socket's file descriptor, <u>recv</u>() shall fail and set <u>errno</u> to <b>[EAGAIN]</b> or <b>[EWOULDBLOCK]</b>.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       Upon successful completion, <u>recv</u>() shall return the length of the message in bytes. If  no  messages  are
       available  to  be  received  and  the  peer  has  performed  an  orderly shutdown, <u>recv</u>() shall return 0.
       Otherwise, -1 shall be returned and <u>errno</u> set to indicate the error.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>recv</u>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EAGAIN</b> or <b>EWOULDBLOCK</b>
              The socket's file descriptor is marked O_NONBLOCK and no  data  is  waiting  to  be  received;  or
              MSG_OOB  is  set  and  no out-of-band data is available and either the socket's file descriptor is
              marked O_NONBLOCK or the socket does not support blocking to await out-of-band data.

       <b>EBADF</b>  The <u>socket</u> argument is not a valid file descriptor.

       <b>ECONNRESET</b>
              A connection was forcibly closed by a peer.

       <b>EINTR</b>  The <u>recv</u>() function was interrupted by a signal that was caught, before any data was available.

       <b>EINVAL</b> The MSG_OOB flag is set and no out-of-band data is available.

       <b>ENOTCONN</b>
              A receive is attempted on a connection-mode socket that is not connected.

       <b>ENOTSOCK</b>
              The <u>socket</u> argument does not refer to a socket.

       <b>EOPNOTSUPP</b>
              The specified flags are not supported for this socket type or protocol.

       <b>ETIMEDOUT</b>
              The connection timed out during connection establishment, or due  to  a  transmission  timeout  on
              active connection.

       The <u>recv</u>() function may fail if:

       <b>EIO</b>    An I/O error occurred while reading from or writing to the file system.

       <b>ENOBUFS</b>
              Insufficient resources were available in the system to perform the operation.

       <b>ENOMEM</b> Insufficient memory was available to fulfill the request.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>recv</u>() function is equivalent to <u>recvfrom</u>() with null pointer <u>address</u> and <u>address_len</u> arguments, and
       to <u>read</u>() if the <u>socket</u> argument refers to a socket and the <u>flags</u> argument is 0.

       The <u>select</u>() and <u>poll</u>() functions can be used to determine when data is available to be received.

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>FUTURE</b> <b>DIRECTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       <u>poll</u>(), <u>pselect</u>(), <u>read</u>(), <u>recvmsg</u>(), <u>recvfrom</u>(),  <u>send</u>(),  <u>sendmsg</u>(),  <u>sendto</u>(),  <u>shutdown</u>(),  <u>socket</u>(),
       <u>write</u>()
