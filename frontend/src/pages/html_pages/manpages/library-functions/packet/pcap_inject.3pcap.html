       pcap_inject, pcap_sendpacket - transmit a packet

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;pcap/pcap.h&gt;</b>

       <b>int</b> <b>pcap_inject(pcap_t</b> <b>*p,</b> <b>const</b> <b>void</b> <b>*buf,</b> <b>size_t</b> <b>size);</b>
       <b>int</b> <b>pcap_sendpacket(pcap_t</b> <b>*p,</b> <b>const</b> <b>u_char</b> <b>*buf,</b> <b>int</b> <b>size);</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pcap_inject</b>()  sends  a  raw  packet through the network interface; <u>buf</u> points to the data of the packet,
       including the link-layer header, and <u>size</u> is the number of bytes in the packet.

       Note that, even if you successfully open the network interface, you might not  have  permission  to  send
       packets  on  it, or it might not support sending packets; as <b><a href="../man3PCAP/pcap_open_live.3PCAP.html">pcap_open_live</a></b>(3PCAP) doesn't have a flag to
       indicate whether to open for capturing, sending, or capturing and sending, you  cannot  request  an  open
       that supports sending and be notified at open time whether sending will be possible.  Note also that some
       devices might not support sending packets.

       Note  that,  on  some platforms, the link-layer header of the packet that's sent might not be the same as
       the link-layer header of the packet supplied to <b>pcap_inject</b>(), as the source link-layer address,  if  the
       header  contains  such  an address, might be changed to be the address assigned to the interface on which
       the packet it sent, if the platform doesn't support sending completely raw and unchanged  packets.   Even
       worse,  some  drivers  on some platforms might change the link-layer type field to whatever value libpcap
       used when attaching to the device, even on platforms that <u>do</u> nominally support sending completely raw and
       unchanged packets.

       <b>pcap_sendpacket</b>() is like <b>pcap_inject</b>(), but it returns <b>0</b> on success, rather than returning the number of
       bytes written.  (<b>pcap_inject</b>() comes from OpenBSD; <b>pcap_sendpacket</b>() comes from WinPcap/Npcap.  Both  are
       provided for compatibility.)

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pcap_inject</b>()  returns  the  number  of bytes written on success, <b>PCAP_ERROR_NOT_ACTIVATED</b> if called on a
       capture handle that has been created but not activated, and <b>PCAP_ERROR</b> on other errors.

       <b>pcap_sendpacket</b>() returns <b>0</b> on success, <b>PCAP_ERROR_NOT_ACTIVATED</b> if called on a capture handle  that  has
       been created but not activated, and <b>PCAP_ERROR</b> on other errors.

       If  <b>PCAP_ERROR</b>  is returned, <b><a href="../man3PCAP/pcap_geterr.3PCAP.html">pcap_geterr</a></b>(3PCAP) or <b><a href="../man3PCAP/pcap_perror.3PCAP.html">pcap_perror</a></b>(3PCAP) may be called with <u>p</u> as an argument
       to fetch or display the error text.
