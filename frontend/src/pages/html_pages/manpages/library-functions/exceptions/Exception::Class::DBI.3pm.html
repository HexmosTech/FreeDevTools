</pre><h4><b>Description</b></h4><pre>
       This module offers a set of DBI-specific exception classes. They inherit from Exception::Class, the base
       class for all exception objects created by the Exception::Class module from the CPAN.
       Exception::Class::DBI itself offers a single class method, "handler()", that returns a code reference
       appropriate for passing to the DBI "HandleError" attribute.

       The exception classes created by Exception::Class::DBI are designed to be thrown in certain DBI contexts;
       the code reference returned by "handler()" and passed to the DBI "HandleError" attribute determines the
       context and throws the appropriate exception.

       Each of the Exception::Class::DBI classes offers a set of object accessor methods in addition to those
       provided by Exception::Class. These can be used to output detailed diagnostic information in the event of
       an exception.

</pre><h4><b>Interface</b></h4><pre>
       Exception::Class::DBI inherits from Exception::Class, and thus its entire interface. Refer to the
       Exception::Class documentation for details.

   <b>Class</b> <b>Method</b>
       "handler"
             my $dbh = DBI-&gt;connect($data_source, $username, $auth, {
                 PrintError  =&gt; 0,
                 RaiseError  =&gt; 0,
                 HandleError =&gt; Exception::Class::DBI-&gt;handler
             });

           This method returns a code reference appropriate for passing to the DBI "HandleError" attribute. When
           DBI  encounters  an  error, it checks its "PrintError", "RaiseError", and "HandleError" attributes to
           decide what to do about it. When "HandleError" has been set to a code  reference,  DBI  executes  it,
           passing  it  the  error string that would be printed for "PrintError", the DBI handle object that was
           executing the method call that triggered the error, and the return value of that method call (usually
           "undef"). Using these arguments, the code reference provided by "handler()" determines what  type  of
           exception  to  throw.  Exception::Class::DBI contains the subclasses detailed below, each relevant to
           the DBI handle that triggered the error.

</pre><h4><b>Classes</b></h4><pre>
       Exception::Class::DBI creates a number of exception classes, each one specific to a particular DBI  error
       context.  Most  of  the  object  methods  described  below correspond to like-named attributes in the DBI
       itself. Thus the documentation below summarizes the DBI attribute documentation, so you should  refer  to
       DBI itself for more in-depth information.

   <b>Exception::Class::DBI</b>
       All  of  the Exception::Class::DBI classes documented below inherit from Exception::Class::DBI. It offers
       the several object methods in addition to those it inherits  from  <u>its</u>  parent,  Exception::Class.  These
       methods  correspond  to  the  DBI  dynamic attributes, as well as to the values passed to the "handler()"
       exception handler via the DBI "HandleError" attribute. Exceptions of this base class are only thrown when
       there is no DBI handle object executing, e.g. in the DBI "connect()" method. <b>Note:</b> This functionality  is
       not     yet     implemented     in     DBI     --     see     the    discusion    that    starts    here:
       &lt;<a href="http://archive.develooper.com/dbi-dev">http://archive.develooper.com/dbi-dev</a>@perl.org/msg01438.html&gt;.

       "error"
             my $error = $ex-&gt;error;

           Exception::Class::DBI actually inherits this method from  Exception::Class.  It  contains  the  error
           string  that  DBI  prints  when  its  "PrintError"  attribute  is  enabled,  or  "die"s with when its
           &lt;RaiseError&gt; attribute is enabled.

       "err"
             my $err = $ex-&gt;err;

           Corresponds to the $DBI::err dynamic attribute. Returns the native database engine  error  code  from
           the last driver method called.

       "errstr"
             my $errstr = $ex-&gt;errstr;

           Corresponds  to  the $DBI::errstr dynamic attribute. Returns the native database engine error message
           from the last driver method called.

       "state"
             my $state = $ex-&gt;state;

           Corresponds to the $DBI::state dynamic attribute. Returns an error code in the standard SQLSTATE five
           character format.

       "retval"
             my $retval = $ex-&gt;retval;

           The first value being returned by the DBI method that failed (typically "undef").

       "handle"
             my $db_handle = $ex-&gt;handle;

           The DBI handle appropriate to the exception class.  For  Exception::Class::DBI::DRH,  it  will  be  a
           driver   handle.   For   Exception::Class::DBI::DBH   it   will   be   a  database  handle.  And  for
           Exception::Class::DBI::STH it will be a statement handle.  If  there  is  no  handle  thrown  in  the
           exception  (because,  say,  the  exception  was  thrown before a driver handle could be created), the
           "handle" will be "undef".

   <b>Exception::Class::DBI::H</b>
       This class inherits from Exception::Class::DBI, and is the base class for all DBI handle exceptions  (see
       below).  It  will  not  be  thrown  directly.  Its methods correspond to the DBI attributes common to all
       handles.

       "warn"
             my $warn = $ex-&gt;warn;

           Boolean value indicating whether DBI warnings have  been  enabled.  Corresponds  to  the  DBI  "Warn"
           attribute.

       "active"
             my $active = $ex-&gt;active;

           Boolean  value indicating whether the DBI handle that encountered the error is active. Corresponds to
           the DBI "Active" attribute.

       "kids"
             my $kids = $ex-&gt;kids;

           For a driver handle, Kids is the number of currently existing database handles that were created from
           that driver handle. For a database handle, Kids is the number of currently existing statement handles
           that were created from that database handle. Corresponds to the DBI "Kids" attribute.

       "active_kids"
             my $active_kids = $ex-&gt;active_kids;

           Like "kids", but  only  counting  those  that  are  "active"  (as  above).  Corresponds  to  the  DBI
           "ActiveKids" attribute.

       "compat_mode"
             my $compat_mode = $ex-&gt;compat_mode;

           Boolean  value indicating whether an emulation layer (such as Oraperl) enables compatible behavior in
           the underlying driver (e.g., DBD::Oracle) for  this  handle.  Corresponds  to  the  DBI  "CompatMode"
           attribute.

       "inactive_destroy"
             my $inactive_destroy = $ex-&gt;inactive_destroy;

           Boolean  value  indicating  whether  the  DBI  has  disabled  the  database  engine related effect of
           "DESTROY"ing a handle. Corresponds to the DBI "InactiveDestroy" attribute.

       "trace_level"
             my $trace_level = $ex-&gt;trace_level;

           Returns the DBI trace level set on the handle that encountered the  error.  Corresponds  to  the  DBI
           "TraceLevel" attribute.

       "fetch_hash_key_name"
             my $fetch_hash_key_name = $ex-&gt;fetch_hash_key_name;

           Returns  the attribute name the DBI "fetchrow_hashref()" method should use to get the field names for
           the hash keys. Corresponds to the DBI "FetchHashKeyName" attribute.

       "chop_blanks"
             my $chop_blanks = $ex-&gt;chop_blanks;

           Boolean value indicating whether DBI trims trailing  space  characters  from  fixed  width  character
           (CHAR) fields. Corresponds to the DBI "ChopBlanks" attribute.

             my $long_read_len = $ex-&gt;long_read_len;

           Returns  the maximum length of long fields ("blob", "memo", etc.) which the DBI driver will read from
           the database automatically when it fetches each row of data. Corresponds  to  the  DBI  "LongReadLen"
           attribute.

       "long_trunc_ok"
             my $long_trunc_ok = $ex-&gt;long_trunc_ok;

           Boolean  value indicating whether the DBI will truncate values it retrieves from long fields that are
           longer than the value returned by "long_read_len()". Corresponds to the DBI "LongTruncOk" attribute.

       "taint"
             my $taint = $ex-&gt;taint;

           Boolean value indicating whether data fetched from the database is considered tainted. Corresponds to
           the DBI "Taint" attribute.

   <b>Exception::Class::DBI::DRH</b>

       extra methods of its own.

   <b>Exception::Class::DBI::DBH</b>
       DBI  database  handle  exceptions  objects. This class inherits from Exception::Class::DBI::H Its methods

           Returns the "name" of the database. Corresponds to the DBI database handle "Name" attribute.

       "statement"
             my $statement = $ex-&gt;statement;

           Returns  the  statement  string  passed to the most recent call to the DBI "prepare()" method in this
           database handle. If it was the "prepare()" method  that  encountered  the  error  and  triggered  the
           exception,  the  statement string will be the statement passed to "prepare()". Corresponds to the DBI
           database handle "Statement" attribute.

       "row_cache_size"
             my $row_cache_size = $ex-&gt;row_cache_size;

           Returns the hint to the database driver  indicating  the  size  of  the  local  row  cache  that  the
           application  would  like  the  driver  to  use for future "SELECT" statements. Corresponds to the DBI
           database handle "RowCacheSize" attribute.

   <b>Exception::Class::DBI::STH</b>
       DBI statement handle exceptions objects. This class inherits from  Exception::Class::DBI::H  Its  methods
       correspond to the DBI statement handle attributes.

       "field_names"
             my $field_names = $ex-&gt;field_names;

           Returns  a  reference  to  an  array of field names for each column. Corresponds to the DBI statement

       "precision"
             my $precision = $ex-&gt;precision;

           Returns a reference to an array of integer values for each column. For non-numeric columns, the value
           generally  refers  to  either  the  maximum  length  or the defined length of the column. For numeric

           statements. Corresponds to the DBI statement handle "RowsInCache" attribute.

   <b>Exception::Class::DBI::Unknown</b>
       Exceptions  of this class are thrown when the context for a DBI error cannot be determined. Inherits from
       Exception::Class::DBI, but implements no methods of its own.

</pre><h4><b>Note</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Note:</b> Not <u>all</u> of the attributes offered by the DBI are exploited by these exception classes. For example,
       the "PrintError" and "RaiseError" attributes seemed redundant. But if  folks  think  it  makes  sense  to
       include  the  missing attributes for the sake of completeness, let me know. Enough interest will motivate
       me to get them in.

</pre><h4><b>Subclassing</b></h4><pre>
       It is possible to subclass Exception::Class::DBI. The trick is to subclass its subclasses,  too.  Similar
       to  subclassing  DBI  itself, this means that the handle subclasses should exist as subnamespaces of your
       base subclass.

       It's easier to explain with an example. Say that you wanted to add a new method  to  all  DBI  exceptions
       that outputs a nicely formatted error message.  You might do it like this:

         package MyApp::Ex::DBI;
         use base 'Exception::Class::DBI';

         sub full_message {
             my $self = shift;
             return $self-&gt;SUPER::full_message unless $self-&gt;can('statement');
             return $self-&gt;SUPER::full_message
                 . ' [for Statement "'
                 . $self-&gt;statement . '"]';
         }

       You can then use this subclass just like Exception::Class::DBI itself:

         my $dbh = DBI-&gt;connect($dsn, $user, $pass, {
             PrintError  =&gt; 0,
             RaiseError  =&gt; 0,
             HandleError =&gt; MyApp::Ex::DBI-&gt;handler,
         });

       And  that's  all  well  and good, except that none of Exception::Class::DBI's own subclasses inherit from
       your class, so most exceptions won't be able to use your spiffy new method.

       The solution is to create subclasses of both the  Exception::Class::DBI  subclasses  and  your  own  base
       subclass, as long as they each use the same package name as your subclass, plus "H", "DRH", "DBH", "STH",
       and "Unknown".  Here's what it looks like:

         package MyApp::Ex::DBI::H;
         use base 'MyApp::Ex::DBI', 'Exception::Class::DBI::H';

         package MyApp::Ex::DBI::DRH;
         use base 'MyApp::Ex::DBI', 'Exception::Class::DBI::DRH';

         package MyApp::Ex::DBI::DBH;
         use base 'MyApp::Ex::DBI', 'Exception::Class::DBI::DBH';

         package MyApp::Ex::DBI::STH;
         use base 'MyApp::Ex::DBI', 'Exception::Class::DBI::STH';

         package MyApp::Ex::DBI::Unknown;
         use base 'MyApp::Ex::DBI', 'Exception::Class::DBI::Unknown';

       And  then  things  should  work just spiffy! Of course, you probably don't need the H subclass unless you
       want to add other methods for the DRH, DBH, and STH classes to inherit from.

</pre><h4><b>To</b> <b>Do</b></h4><pre>
       •   I need to figure out a non-database specific way of testing STH exceptions.  DBD::ExampleP works well
           for DRH and DBH exceptions, but not so well for STH exceptions.
