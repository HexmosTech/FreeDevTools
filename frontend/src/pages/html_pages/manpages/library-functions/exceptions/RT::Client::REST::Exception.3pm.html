       RT::Client::REST::Exception - Exceptions thrown by RT::Client::REST

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 0.72

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       These are exceptions that are thrown by various RT::Client::REST methods.

</pre><h4><b>EXCEPTION</b> <b>HIERARCHY</b></h4><pre>
       <b>RT::Client::REST::Exception</b>
         This  exception  is  virtual  --  it  is  never thrown.  It is used to group all the exceptions in this
         category.

         <b>RT::Client::REST::OddNumberOfArgumentsException</b>
           This means that the method you called wants key-value pairs.

         <b>RT::Client::REST::InvaildObjectTypeException</b>
           Thrown when you specify an invalid type to "show()", "edit()", or "search()" methods.

         <b>RT::Client::REST::RequiredAttributeUnsetException</b>
           An operation failed because a required attribute was not set in the object.

         <b>RT::Client::REST::MalformedRTResponseException</b>
           RT server sent response that we cannot parse.  This may very well mean a bug in this  client,  so  if
           you get this exception, some debug information mailed to the author would be appreciated.

         <b>RT::Client::REST::InvalidParameterValueException</b>
           Invalid value for comments, link types, object IDs, etc.

         <b>RT::Client::REST::CannotReadAttachmentException</b>
           Cannot read attachment (thrown from methods "<b>comment()</b>" and "correspond").

         <b>RT::Client::REST::RTException</b>
           This  is  a  virtual exception and is never thrown.  It is used to group exceptions thrown because RT
           server returns an error.

           <b>RT::Client::REST::ObjectNotFoundException</b>
             One or more of the specified objects was not found.

           <b>RT::Client::REST::AuthenticationFailureException</b>
             Incorrect username or password.

           <b>RT::Client::REST::UpdateException</b>
             This is a virtual exception.  It is used to group exceptions thrown when RT server returns an error
             trying to update an object.

             <b>RT::Client::REST::CouldNotSetAttributeException</b>
               For one or another reason, attribute could not be updated with the new value.

             <b>RT::Client::REST::InvalidEmailAddressException</b>
               Invalid e-mail address specified.

             <b>RT::Client::REST::AlreadyCurrentValueException</b>
               The attribute you are trying to update already has this value.  I do not know why RT  insists  on
               treating  this  as  an  exception,  but since it does so, so should the client.  You can probably
               safely catch and throw away this exception in your code.

             <b>RT::Client::REST::ImmutableFieldException</b>
               Trying to update an immutable field (such as "last_updated", for example).

             <b>RT::Client::REST::IllegalValueException</b>
               Illegal value for attribute was specified.

           <b>RT::Client::REST::UnknownCustomFieldException</b>
             Unknown custom field was specified in the request.

           <b>RT::Client::REST::InvalidQueryException</b>
             Server could not parse the search query.

           <b>RT::Client::REST::UnauthorizedActionException</b>
             You are not authorized to perform this action.

           <b>RT::Client::REST::AlreadyTicketOwnerException</b>
             The owner you are trying to assign to a ticket is already the owner.   This  exception  is  usually
             thrown by methods "take()", "untake", and "steal", if the operation is a noop.

           <b>RT::Client::REST::RequestTimedOutException</b>
             Request timed out.

           <b>RT::Client::REST::UnknownRTException</b>
             Some other RT exception that the driver cannot recognize.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>_get_exception_class</b>
         Figure out exception class based on content returned by RT.

       <b>_rt_content_to_exception</b>
         Translate error string returned by RT server into an exception object ready to be thrown.
