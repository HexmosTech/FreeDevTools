</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       OpenDBX::Exception - Exceptions thrown by the <b>OpenDBX</b> classes.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       Inherits std::runtime_error.

   <b>Public</b> <b>Member</b> <b>Functions</b>
       <b>Exception</b> (const string &amp;msg, int err, int type)  throw ()
           Initializes the exception object.
       int <b>getCode</b> () const  throw ()
           Returns the <b>OpenDBX</b> error code related to the error.
       int <b>getType</b> () const  throw ()
           Returns severity indicator.

</pre><h4><b>Detailed</b> <b>Description</b></h4><pre>
       Exceptions thrown by the <b>OpenDBX</b> classes.

       Most calls to methods of <b>OpenDBX</b> objects does throw an exception in case an error occurs in the
       underlying database library. Additionally to other exceptions which inherit from the STL exception class
       it will not only contain a translated error message depending on the user settings but also a machine
       readable error code and an indicator for the severity of the eror.

       <b>Version</b>
           1.0

</pre><h4><b>Constructor</b> <b>&amp;</b> <b>Destructor</b> <b>Documentation</b></h4><pre>
   <b>OpenDBX::Exception::Exception</b> <b>(const</b> <b>string</b> <b>&amp;</b> <b>msg,</b> <b>int</b> <b>err,</b> <b>int</b> <b>type)</b>
       Initializes the exception object. The first parameter, the error message, should be the human readable
       description of what has gone wrong. It should also be already translated to the language of the user
       which depends on his environment settings when e.g GNU gettext is used. Errors thrown by the <b>OpenDBX</b> C++
       library are already translated.

       The <b>OpenDBX</b> error code is the machine readable code for the error which has been occured.

       The last parameter must be a value indicating the severity of the thrown error. If the value is smaller
       than zero, the error is fatal and the connection to the database can't be recovered and has to be closed
       and reopened before the application can try to continue. In case it's greater than zero, the operation
       failed but the database connection is still usable. Zero represents a successful operation and shouldn't
       be used because an exception should only be thrown in error conditions.

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>msg</u> Human readable error message
           <u>err</u> <b>OpenDBX</b> error code
           <u>type</u> Severity of error (negative: fatal, zero: success, positive: warning)

       <b>Returns</b>
           <b>Exception</b>

</pre><h4><b>Member</b> <b>Function</b> <b>Documentation</b></h4><pre>
   <b>int</b> <b>OpenDBX::Exception::getCode</b> <b>()</b> <b>const</b>
       Returns the <b>OpenDBX</b> error code related to the error. The machine readable code describing the error which
       occured can be used by the application to act differently depending on the specific error. Currently
       defined codes are:

       • ODBX_ERR_SUCCESS
          The operation was successfully completed.

       • ODBX_ERR_BACKEND
          An error occured in the native database library or in the database server.

       • ODBX_ERR_NOCAP
          The capability isn't available in the currently selected backend.

       • ODBX_ERR_PARAM
          One of the given parameters is invalid and doesn't match the expectations.

       • ODBX_ERR_NOMEM
          An out of memory condition occured.

       • ODBX_ERR_SIZE
          The internally allocated memory is unable to store the value.

       • ODBX_ERR_NOTEXIST
          The backend library wasn't found or loading the library failed.

       • ODBX_ERR_NOOP
          The required function isn't available or the operation isn't possible in this backend.

       • ODBX_ERR_OPTION
          The given option is unknown an therefore invalid.

       • ODBX_ERR_OPTRO
          The requested option is read-only and its value can't be changed.

       • ODBX_ERR_OPTWR
          Setting the given option to the new value failed.

       • ODBX_ERR_RESULT
          Waiting for the result set after sending a statement to the database server failed.

       • ODBX_ERR_NOTSUP
          The requested functionality isn't supported by the backend.

       • ODBX_ERR_HANDLE
          The internal data structure which should store the details for accessing the database are invalid.

       <b>Returns</b>
           Error code

   <b>int</b> <b>OpenDBX::Exception::getType</b> <b>()</b> <b>const</b>
       Returns  severity  indicator. The returned value classifies the error thrown. In case it is negative, the
       error is fatal (e.g. the connection to the database is lost) and the application can't  continue  without
       closing and reopening the connection.

       If  the value is positive, the database wasn't able to perform the requested action but the connection is
       still OK and can be used to send more requests to the database. On zero, everything was  successfull  and
       no error occured. This shouldn't happen when catching one of these exceptions.

       <b>Returns</b>
           Severity of error (negative: fatal, zero: success, positive: warning)
