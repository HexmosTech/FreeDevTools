</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Dancer::Exception - class for throwing and catching exceptions

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 1.3521

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Dancer::Exception qw(:all);

           register_exception('DataProblem',
                               message_pattern =&gt; "test message : %s"
                             );

           sub do_stuff {
             raise DataProblem =&gt; "we've lost data!";
           }

           try {
             do_stuff()
           } catch {
             # an exception was thrown
             my ($exception) = @_;
             if ($exception-&gt;does('DataProblem')) {
               # handle the data problem
               my $message = $exception-&gt;message();
             } else {
               $exception-&gt;rethrow
             }
           };

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Dancer::Exception is based on Try::Tiny. You can try and catch exceptions, like in Try::Tiny.

       Exceptions are objects, from subclasses of Dancer::Exception::Base.

       However, for internal Dancer usage, we introduce a special class of exceptions, called
       Dancer::Continuation. Exceptions that are from this class are not caught with a "catch" block, but only
       with a "continuation". That's a cheap way to implement a <u>workflow</u> <u>interruption</u>. Dancer users should
       ignore this feature.

   <b>What</b> <b>it</b> <b>means</b> <b>for</b> <b>Dancer</b> <b>users</b>
       Users can throw and catch exceptions, using "try" and "catch". They can reuse some Dancer core exceptions
       ("Dancer::Exception::Base::*"), but they can also create new exception classes, and use them for their
       own means. That way it's easy to use custom exceptions in a Dancer application. Have a look at
       "register_exception", "raise", and the methods in Dancer::Exception::Base.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>try</b>
       Same as in Try::Tiny

   <b>catch</b>
       Same as in Try::Tiny. The exception can be retrieved as the first parameter:

           try { ... } catch { my ($exception) = @_; };

   <b>continuation</b>
       To be used by Dancer developers only, in Dancer core code.

   <b>raise</b>
         # raise Dancer::Exception::Base::Custom
         raise Custom =&gt; "user $username is unknown";

         # raise Dancer::Exception::Base::Custom::Frontend
         raise 'Custom::Frontend' =&gt; "user $username is unknown";

         # same, raise Dancer::Exception::Base::Custom::Frontend
         raise custom_frontend =&gt; "user $username is unknown";

         # raise My::Own::ExceptionSystem::Invalid::Login
         raise '+My::Own::ExceptionSystem::Invalid::Login' =&gt; "user $username is unknown";

       raise provides an easy way to throw an exception. First parameter is the name of the exception class,
       without the "Dancer::Exception::" prefix. other parameters are stored as <u>raising</u> <u>arguments</u> in the
       exception. Usually the parameters is an exception message, but it's left to the exception class
       implementation.

       If the exception class name starts with a "+", then the "Dancer::Exception::" won't be added. This allows
       one to build their own exception class hierarchy, but you should first look at "register_exception"
       before implementing your own class hierarchy. If you really wish to build your own exception class
       hierarchy, we recommend that all exceptions inherit of Dancer::Exception::. Or at least it should
       implement its methods.

       The exception class can also be written as words separated by underscores, it'll be camelized
       automatically. So 'Exception::Foo' and 'exception_foo' are equivalent. Be careful, 'MyException' can't be
       written 'myexception', as it would be camelized into 'Myexception'.

   <b>register_exception</b>
       This method allows one to register custom exceptions, usable by Dancer users in their route code
       (actually pretty much everywhere).

         # simple exception
         register_exception ('InvalidCredentials',
                             message_pattern =&gt; "invalid credentials : %s",
                            );

       This registers a new custom exception. To use it, do:

         raise InvalidCredentials =&gt; "user Herbert not found";

       The exception message can be retrieved with the "$exception-&gt;message" method, and we'll be "invalid
       credentials : user Herbert not found" (see methods in Dancer::Exception::Base)

         # complex exception
         register_exception ('InvalidLogin',
                             composed_from =&gt; [qw(Fatal InvalidCredentials)],
                             message_pattern =&gt; "wrong login or password",
                          );

       In this example, the "InvalidLogin" is built as a composition of the "Fatal" and "InvalidCredentials"
       exceptions. See the "does" method in Dancer::Exception::Base.

   <b>registered_exceptions</b>
         my @exception_classes = registered_exceptions;

       Returns the list of exception class names. It will list core exceptions "and" custom exceptions (except
       the one you've registered with a leading "+", see "register_exception"). The list is sorted.

</pre><h4><b>GLOBAL</b> <b>VARIABLE</b></h4><pre>
   <b>$Dancer::Exception::Verbose</b>
       When set to 1, exceptions will stringify with a long stack trace. This variable is similar to
       $Carp::Verbose. I recommend you use it like that:

         local $Dancer::Exception::Verbose;
         $Dancer::Exception::Verbose = 1;

       All the Carp global variables can also be used to alter the stacktrace generation.
