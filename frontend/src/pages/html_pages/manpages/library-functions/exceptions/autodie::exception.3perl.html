</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       autodie::exception - Exceptions from autodying functions.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           eval {
               use autodie;

               open(my $fh, '&lt;', 'some_file.txt');

               ...
           };

           if (my $E = $@) {
               say "Ooops!  ",$E-&gt;caller," had problems: $@";
           }

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       When an autodie enabled function fails, it generates an "autodie::exception" object.  This can be
       interrogated to determine further information about the error that occurred.

       This document is broken into two sections; those methods that are most useful to the end-developer, and
       those methods for anyone wishing to subclass or get very familiar with "autodie::exception".

   <b>Common</b> <b>Methods</b>
       These methods are intended to be used in the everyday dealing of exceptions.

       The following assume that the error has been copied into a separate scalar:

           if ($E = $@) {
               ...
           }

       This is not required, but is recommended in case any code is called which may reset or alter $@.

       <u>args</u>

           my $array_ref = $E-&gt;args;

       Provides a reference to the arguments passed to the subroutine that died.

       <u>function</u>

           my $sub = $E-&gt;function;

       The subroutine (including package) that threw the exception.

       <u>file</u>

           my $file = $E-&gt;file;

       The file in which the error occurred (eg, "myscript.pl" or "MyTest.pm").

       <u>package</u>

           my $package = $E-&gt;package;

       The package from which the exceptional subroutine was called.

       <u>caller</u>

           my $caller = $E-&gt;caller;

       The subroutine that <u>called</u> the exceptional code.

       <u>line</u>

           my $line = $E-&gt;line;

       The line in "$E-&gt;file" where the exceptional code was called.

       <u>context</u>

           my $context = $E-&gt;context;

       The context in which the subroutine was called by autodie; usually the same as the context in which you
       called the autodying subroutine.  This can be 'list', 'scalar', or undefined (unknown).  It will never be
       'void', as "autodie" always captures the return value in one way or another.

       For some core functions that always return a scalar value regardless of their context (eg, "chown"), this
       may be 'scalar', even if you used a list context.

       <u>return</u>

           my $return_value = $E-&gt;return;

       The value(s) returned by the failed subroutine.  When the subroutine was called in a list context, this
       will always be a reference to an array containing the results.  When the subroutine was called in a
       scalar context, this will be the actual scalar returned.

       <u>errno</u>

           my $errno = $E-&gt;errno;

       The value of $! at the time when the exception occurred.

       <b>NOTE</b>: This method will leave the main "autodie::exception" class and become part of a role in the future.
       You should only call "errno" for exceptions where $! would reasonably have been set on failure.

       <u>eval_error</u>

           my $old_eval_error = $E-&gt;eval_error;

       The contents of $@ immediately after autodie triggered an exception.  This may be useful when dealing
       with modules such as Text::Balanced that set (but do not throw) $@ on error.

       <u>matches</u>

           if ( $e-&gt;matches('open') ) { ... }

           if ( 'open' ~~ $e ) { ... }

       "matches" is used to determine whether a given exception matches a particular role.

       An exception is considered to match a string if:

       •   For  a  string  not starting with a colon, the string exactly matches the package and subroutine that
           threw the exception.  For example, "MyModule::log".  If the string does not contain a  package  name,
           "CORE::" is assumed.

       •   For  a  string  that  does  start  with  a  colon, if the subroutine throwing the exception <u>does</u> that
           behaviour.  For example, the "CORE::open" subroutine does ":file", ":io" and ":all".

           See "CATEGORIES" in autodie for further information.

           On Perl 5.10 and above, using  smart-match  ("~~")  with  an  "autodie::exception"  object  will  use
           "matches"  underneath.   This module used to recommend using smart-match with the exception object on
           the left hand side, but in future Perls that is likely to stop working.  The smart-match facility  of
           this  class  should  only  be  used  with  the  exception  object on the right hand side.  Having the
           exception object on the right is both future-proof and portable to older Perls, back to 5.10.  Beware
           that this facility can only be relied upon when it is certain that the exception object  actually  is
           an "autodie::exception" object; it is no more capable than an explicit call to the "matches" method.

   <b>Advanced</b> <b>methods</b>
       The  following  methods,  while  usable  from  anywhere, are primarily intended for developers wishing to
       subclass "autodie::exception", write code that registers custom error messages, or otherwise work closely
       with the "autodie::exception" model.

       <u>register</u>

           autodie::exception-&gt;register( 'CORE::open' =&gt; \&amp;mysub );

       The "register" method allows for the registration of a message handler for a given subroutine.  The  full
       subroutine name including the package should be used.

       Registered message handlers will receive the "autodie::exception" object as the first parameter.

       <u>add_file_and_line</u>

           say "Problem occurred",$@-&gt;add_file_and_line;

       Returns  the string " at %s line %d", where %s is replaced with the filename, and %d is replaced with the
       line number.

       Primarily intended for use by format handlers.

       <u>stringify</u>

           say "The error was: ",$@-&gt;stringify;

       Formats the error as a human readable string.  Usually there's no reason to call this directly, as it  is
       used automatically if an "autodie::exception" object is ever used as a string.

       Child classes can override this method to change how they're stringified.

       <u>format_default</u>

           my $error_string = $E-&gt;format_default;

       This  produces  the  default  error  string for the given exception, <u>without</u> <u>using</u> <u>any</u> <u>registered</u> <u>message</u>
       <u>handlers</u>.  It is primarily intended to be called from a message handler when they  have  been  passed  an
       exception they don't want to format.

       Child classes can override this method to change how default messages are formatted.

       <u>new</u>

           my $error = autodie::exception-&gt;new(
               args =&gt; \@_,
               function =&gt; "CORE::open",
               errno =&gt; $!,
               context =&gt; 'scalar',
               return =&gt; undef,
           );

       Creates  a  new  "autodie::exception"  object.  Normally called directly from an autodying function.  The
       "function" argument is required, its the function we were trying to call that  generated  the  exception.
       The "args" parameter is optional.

       The  "errno"  value is optional.  In versions of "autodie::exception" 1.99 and earlier the code would try
       to automatically use the current value of $!, but this was unreliable and is no longer supported.

       Atrributes such as package, file, and caller are determined automatically, and cannot be specified.
