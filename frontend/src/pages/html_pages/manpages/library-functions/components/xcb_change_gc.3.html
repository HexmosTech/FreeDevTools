       <u>conn</u>      The XCB connection to X11.

       <u>gc</u>        The graphics context to change.

       <u>value_mask</u>
                 One of the following values:

                 <u>XCB_GC_FUNCTION</u>
                           TODO: Refer to GX

                 <u>XCB_GC_PLANE_MASK</u>
                           In  graphics operations, given a source and destination pixel, the result is computed
                           bitwise on corresponding bits of the pixels; that is, a  Boolean  operation  is  per‐
                           formed  in  each  bit  plane.  The  plane-mask restricts the operation to a subset of
                           planes, so the result is:

                                   ((src FUNC dst) AND plane-mask) OR (dst AND (NOT plane-mask))

                 <u>XCB_GC_FOREGROUND</u>
                           Foreground colorpixel.

                 <u>XCB_GC_BACKGROUND</u>
                           Background colorpixel.

                 <u>XCB_GC_LINE_WIDTH</u>
                           The line-width is measured in pixels and can be greater than or equal to one, a  wide
                           line, or the special value zero, a thin line.

                 <u>XCB_GC_LINE_STYLE</u>
                           The  line-style  defines which sections of a line are drawn: Solid                The
                           full path of the line is drawn.  DoubleDash           The full path of  the  line  is
                           drawn, but the even dashes are filled differently
                                                than  the  odd dashes (see fill-style), with Butt cap-style used
                           where even and
                                                odd dashes meet.  OnOffDash            Only the even dashes  are
                           drawn, and cap-style applies to all internal ends of
                                                the individual dashes (except NotLast is treated as Butt).

                 <u>XCB_GC_CAP_STYLE</u>
                           The cap-style defines how the endpoints of a path are drawn: NotLast    The result is
                           equivalent to Butt, except that for a line-width of zero the final
                                      endpoint  is  not  drawn.  Butt       The result is square at the endpoint
                           (perpendicular to the slope of the line)
                                      with no projection beyond.  Round      The result is a circular  arc  with
                           its diameter equal to the line-width, centered
                                      on the endpoint; it is equivalent to Butt for line-width zero.  Projecting
                           The result is square at the end, but the path continues beyond the endpoint for
                                      a  distance  equal  to  half  the line-width; it is equivalent to Butt for
                           line-width
                                      zero.

                 <u>XCB_GC_JOIN_STYLE</u>
                           The join-style defines how corners are drawn for wide lines: Miter                The
                           outer edges of the two lines extend to meet at an angle. However, if the
                                               angle  is  less  than  11 degrees, a Bevel join-style is used in‐
                           stead.  Round               The result is a circular arc with a diameter equal to the
                           line-width, centered
                                               on the joinpoint.  Bevel               The result  is  Butt  end‐
                           point styles, and then the triangular notch is filled.

                 <u>XCB_GC_FILL_STYLE</u>
                           The  fill-style defines the contents of the source for line, text, and fill requests.
                           For all text and fill requests (for example, PolyText8,  PolyText16,  PolyFillRectan‐
                           gle,  FillPoly,  and PolyFillArc) as well as for line requests with line-style Solid,
                           (for example, PolyLine, PolySegment, PolyRectangle, PolyArc) and for the even  dashes
                           for    line    requests    with    line-style    OnOffDash   or   DoubleDash:   Solid

                           same width and height as stipple but with background

                 <u>XCB_GC_FILL_RULE</u>

                 <u>XCB_GC_TILE</u>
                           The  tile/stipple  represents an infinite two-dimensional plane with the tile/stipple
                           replicated in all dimensions. When that plane is superimposed on the drawable for use
                           in a graphics operation, the upper-left corner of some instance of  the  tile/stipple
                           is  at  the coordinates within the drawable specified by the tile/stipple origin. The
                           tile/stipple and clip origins are interpreted relative to the origin of whatever des‐
                           tination drawable is specified in a graphics request.  The tile pixmap must have  the
                           same  root  and depth as the gcontext (or a Match error results).  The stipple pixmap
                           must have depth one and must have the same root as the gcontext (or a Match error re‐
                           sults). For fill-style Stippled (but not fill-style OpaqueStippled), the stipple pat‐
                           tern is tiled in a single plane and acts as an additional clip mask to be ANDed  with
                           the  clip-mask.   Any  size pixmap can be used for tiling or stippling, although some
                           sizes may be faster to use than others.

                 <u>XCB_GC_STIPPLE</u>
                           The tile/stipple represents an infinite two-dimensional plane with  the  tile/stipple
                           replicated in all dimensions. When that plane is superimposed on the drawable for use

                 <u>XCB_GC_SUBWINDOW_MODE</u>
                           For  ClipByChildren,  both source and destination windows are additionally clipped by
                           all viewable InputOutput children. For IncludeInferiors, neither source nor  destina‐
                           tion window is clipped by inferiors. This will result in including subwindow contents
                           in the source and drawing through subwindow boundaries of the destination. The use of
                           IncludeInferiors with a source or destination window of one depth with mapped inferi‐
                           ors  of  differing  depth  is not illegal, but the semantics is undefined by the core
                           protocol.

                           The clip-mask restricts writes to the destination drawable.  Only  pixels  where  the
                           clip-mask  has bits set to 1 are drawn. Pixels are not drawn outside the area covered
                           by the clip-mask or where the clip-mask has bits set to 0. The clip-mask affects  all
                           graphics  requests, but it does not clip sources. The clip-mask origin is interpreted
                           relative to the origin of whatever destination drawable is specified  in  a  graphics
                           request. If a pixmap is specified as the clip-mask, it must have depth 1 and have the
                           same root as the gcontext (or a Match error results). If clip-mask is None, then pix‐
                           els  are  always  drawn, regardless of the clip origin. The clip-mask can also be set
                           with the SetClipRectangles request.
