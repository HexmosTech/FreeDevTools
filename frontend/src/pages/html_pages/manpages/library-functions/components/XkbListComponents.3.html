       XkbListComponents - List of components for one or more component types

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>XkbComponentListPtr</b>  <b>XkbListComponents</b>  <b>(Display</b>  <b>*</b><u>dpy</u><b>,</b>  <b>unsigned</b>  <b>int</b>  <u>device_spec</u><b>,</b> <b>XkbComponentNamesPtr</b>
              <u>ptrns</u><b>,</b> <b>int</b> <b>*</b><u>max_inout</u><b>);</b>

</pre><h4><b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>dpy</u>    connection to X server

       <u>device_spec</u>
              device ID, or XkbUseCoreKbd

       <u>ptrns</u>  namelist for components of interest

       <u>max_inout</u>
              max # returned names, # left over

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       You may ask the server for a list of components for one or more component types. The  request  takes  the
       form  of  a  set  of  patterns,  one pattern for each of the component types, including a pattern for the
       complete keyboard description. To obtain this list, use <u>XkbListComponents.</u>

       <u>XkbListComponents</u> queries the server for a list of component names matching  the  patterns  specified  in
       <u>ptrns.</u>   It  waits  for  a  reply  and  returns  the  matching  component names in an XkbComponentListRec
       structure.  When you are done using  the  structure,  you  should  free  it  using  <u>XkbFreeComponentList.</u>
       <u>device_spec</u> indicates a particular device in which the caller is interested. A server is allowed (but not
       required) to restrict its reply to portions of the database that are relevant for that particular device.

       <u>ptrns</u>  is a pointer to an XkbComponentNamesRec. Each of the fields in <u>ptrns</u> contains a pattern naming the
       components of interest. Each of the patterns is composed of characters from the ISO Latin1 encoding,  but
       can  contain  only  parentheses,  the  wildcard  characters  `?'  and  `*', and characters permitted in a
       component class or member name. A pattern may be NULL, in which case  no  components  for  that  type  is
       returned.  Pattern  matches with component names are case sensitive. The `?'  wildcard matches any single
       character, except a left or right parenthesis; the `*' wildcard matches any number of characters,  except
       a  left  or  right parenthesis. If an implementation allows additional characters in a component class or
       member name other than those required by the Xkb extension, the result of comparing one of the additional
       characters to either of the wildcard characters is implementation-dependent.

       If a pattern contains illegal characters, the illegal characters are ignored.  The  matching  process  is
       carried out as if the illegal characters were omitted from the pattern.

       <u>max_inout</u>  is  used  to throttle the amount of data passed to and from the server. On input, it specifies
       the maximum number of names to be returned (the total number of names in all component categories).  Upon
       return  from  <u>XkbListComponents,</u> max_inout contains the number of names that matched the request but were
       not returned because of the limit.

       <b>Component</b> <b>Names</b>

       Component names have the form <u><a href="../manmember/class.member.html">class</a>(member)</u> where <u>class</u> describes a subset of  the  available  components
       for  a  particular  type  and  the  optional <u>member</u> identifies a specific component from that subset. For
       example, the name "atlantis(acme)" for a symbols  component  might  specify  the  symbols  used  for  the
       atlantis  national  keyboard  layout  by  the  vendor "acme." Each class has an optional <u>default</u> member -
       references that specify a class but not a member refer to the default member of the class, if one exists.
       Xkb places no constraints on the interpretation of the class and member names used in component names.

       The <u>class</u> and <u>member</u> names are both specified using  characters  from  the  Latin-1  character  set.  Xkb
       implementations  must  accept  all  alphanumeric characters, minus (`-') and underscore (`_') in class or
       member names, and must not accept parentheses, plus, vertical bar, percent sign, asterisk, question mark,
       or white space. The use of other characters is implementation-dependent.

</pre><h4><b>STRUCTURES</b></h4><pre>
       The component name patterns used to describe  the  request  are  passed  to  <u>XkbListComponents</u>  using  an
       XkbComponentNamesRec   structure.   This   structure   has   no   special   allocation   constraints   or
       interrelationships with other structures; allocate and free this structure using standard <u>malloc</u> and <u>free</u>
       calls or their equivalent:

           typedef struct _XkbComponentNames {
               char *         keymap;           /* keymap names */
               char *         keycodes;         /* keycode names */
               char *         types;            /* type names */
               char *         compat;           /* compatibility map names */
               char *         symbols;          /* symbol names */
               char *         geometry;         /* geometry names */
           } XkbComponentNamesRec, *XkbComponentNamesPtr;

       <u>XkbListComponents</u> returns a pointer to an XkbComponentListRec:

           typedef struct _XkbComponentList {
               int                      num_keymaps;  /* number of entries in keymap */
               int                      num_keycodes; /* number of entries in keycodes */
               int                      num_types;    /* number of entries in types */
               int                      num_compat;   /* number of entries in compat */
               int                      num_symbols;  /* number of entries in symbols */
               int                      num_geometry; /* number of entries in geometry;
               XkbComponentNamePtr      keymap;       /* keymap names */
               XkbComponentNamePtr      keycodes;     /* keycode names */
               XkbComponentNamePtr      types;        /* type names */
               XkbComponentNamePtr      compat;       /* compatibility map names */
               XkbComponentNamePtr      symbols;      /* symbol names */
               XkbComponentNamePtr      geometry;     /* geometry names */
           } XkbComponentListRec, *XkbComponentListPtr;

           typedef struct _XkbComponentName {
               unsigned short           flags;        /* hints regarding component name */
               char *                   name;         /* name of component */
           } XkbComponentNameRec, *XkbComponentNamePtr;

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       Note that the structure used to specify patterns on input is an XkbComponentNamesRec, and  that  used  to
       hold the individual component names upon return is an XkbComponentNameRec (no trailing `s' in Name).
