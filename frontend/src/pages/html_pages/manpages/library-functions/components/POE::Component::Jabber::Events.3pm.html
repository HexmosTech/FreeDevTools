</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       POE::Component::Jabber::Events exports many useful constants for tracking the status of PCJ during its
       operation. Simply subscribe to these events in order to receive notification.

</pre><h4><b>EXPORTS</b></h4><pre>
       Below are the exported constants with a brief explanation of what it is signalling to the end developer:

       PCJ_CONNECT
           'connect' or 'reconnect' event has fired.

       PCJ_CONNECTING
           Connecting is now in process

       PCJ_CONNECTED
           Initial connection established

       PCJ_STREAMSTART
           A  &lt;stream:stream/&gt;  tag  has  been  sent.  The number of these events is variable depending on which
           Protocol is currently active (ie. XMPP will send upto three, while LEGACY will only send one).

       PCJ_SSLNEGOTIATE
           TLS/SSL negotiation  has  begun.   This  event  only  is  fired  from  XMPP  and  JABBERD20_COMPONENT
           connections.

       PCJ_SSLSUCCESS
           TLS/SSL  negotiation  has  successfully  complete. Socket layer is now encrypted.  This event only is
           fired from XMPP and JABBERD20_COMPONENT connections.

       PCJ_SSLFAIL
           TLS/SSL negotiation has  failed.   This  event  only  is  fired  from  XMPP  and  JABBERD20_COMPONENT
           connections.

       PCJ_AUTHNEGOTIATE
           Whatever  your  authentication  method  (ie. iq:auth, SASL, &lt;handshake/&gt;, etc), it is in process when
           this status is received.

       PCJ_AUTHSUCCESS
           Authentication was successful.

       PCJ_AUTHFAIL
           Authentication failed.

       PCJ_BINDNEGOTIATE
           For XMPP connections: this indicates resource binding negotiation has begun.

           For JABBERD20_COMPONENT connections: domain binding negotiation has begun.

           This event will not fire for any but the above two connection types.

       PCJ_BINDSUCCESS
           For XMPP connections: this indicates resource binding negotiation was sucessful.

           For JABBERD20_COMPONENT connections: domain binding negotiation was successful.

           This event will not fire for any but the above two connection types.

       PCJ_BINDFAIL
           Binding for which ever context has failed.

       PCJ_SESSIONNEGOTIATE
           Only for XMPP: This indicates session binding (XMPP IM) negotiation has begun.

       PCJ_SESSIONSUCCESS
           Only for XMPP: This indicates session binding (XMPP IM) negotiation was successful.

       PCJ_SESSIONFAIL
           Session negotiation has failed for which ever context.

       PCJ_NODESENT
           A Node has been placed, outbound, into the Wheel. ARG0 will be the node.

       PCJ_NODERECEIVED
           A Node has been received. ARG0 will be the node.

       PCJ_NODEQUEUED
           An attempt to send a Node while there is no valid, initialized connection was caught.  The  Node  has
           been queued. See POE::Component::Jabber event 'purge_queue' for details. ARG0 will be the node.

       PCJ_RTS_START
           A return_to_sender event has been fired for an outbound node. ARG0 will be the node.

       PCJ_RTS_FINISH
           A return_to_sender event has been fired for a matching inbound node. ARG0 will be the node.

       PCJ_READY
           This event indicates that the connection is fully initialized and ready for use.

           Watch for this event and begin packet transactions AFTER it has been fired.

       PCJ_STREAMEND
           A  &lt;/stream:stream&gt;  Node  has been sent. This indicates the end of the connection and is called upon
           'shutdown' of PCJ after the Node has been flushed.

       PCJ_SHUTDOWN_START
           This indicates that 'shutdown' has been fired and is  currently  in  progress  of  tearing  down  the
           connection.

       PCJ_SHUTDOWN_FINISH
           This indicates that 'shutdown' is complete.

       PCJ_SOCKETFAIL
           This  indicates  a  socket  level  error.  ARG0..ARG2  will  be  exactly  what  was passed to us from
           POE::Wheel::ReadWrite.

       PCJ_SOCKETDISCONNECT
           This indicates the socket has disconnected and will occur in both normal, and in error states.
