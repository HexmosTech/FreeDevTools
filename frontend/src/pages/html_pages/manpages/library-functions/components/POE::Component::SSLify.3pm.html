       POE::Component::SSLify - Makes using SSL in the world of POE easy!

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
         This document describes v1.012 of POE::Component::SSLify - released November 14, 2014 as part of POE-Component-SSLify.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
               # look at the DESCRIPTION for client and server example code

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This component is a method to simplify the SSLification of a socket before it is passed to a
       POE::Wheel::ReadWrite wheel in your application.

   <b>Client</b> <b>usage</b>
               # Import the module
               use POE::Component::SSLify qw( Client_SSLify );

               # Create a normal SocketFactory wheel and connect to a SSL-enabled server
               my $factory = POE::Wheel::SocketFactory-&gt;new;

               # Time passes, SocketFactory gives you a socket when it connects in SuccessEvent
               # Convert the socket into a SSL socket POE can communicate with
               my $socket = shift;
               eval { $socket = Client_SSLify( $socket ) };
               if ( $@ ) {
                       # Unable to SSLify it...
               }

               # Now, hand it off to ReadWrite
               my $rw = POE::Wheel::ReadWrite-&gt;new(
                       Handle  =&gt;      $socket,
                       # other options as usual
               );

   <b>Server</b> <b>usage</b>
               # !!! Make sure you have a public key + certificate
               # excellent howto: <a href="http://www.akadia.com/services/ssh_test_certificate.html">http://www.akadia.com/services/ssh_test_certificate.html</a>

               # Import the module
               use POE::Component::SSLify qw( Server_SSLify SSLify_Options );

               # Set the key + certificate file
               eval { SSLify_Options( 'server.key', 'server.crt' ) };
               if ( $@ ) {

               # Create a normal SocketFactory wheel to listen for connections
               my $factory = POE::Wheel::SocketFactory-&gt;new;

               # Time passes, SocketFactory gives you a socket when it gets a connection in SuccessEvent
               # Convert the socket into a SSL socket POE can communicate with
               my $socket = shift;
               eval { $socket = Server_SSLify( $socket ) };
               if ( $@ ) {
                       # Unable to SSLify it...
               }

               # Now, hand it off to ReadWrite
               my $rw = POE::Wheel::ReadWrite-&gt;new(
                       Handle  =&gt;      $socket,
                       # other options as usual
               );

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Client_SSLify</b>
       This function sslifies a client-side socket. You can pass several options to it:

               my $socket = shift;
               $socket = Client_SSLify( $socket, $version, $options, $ctx, $callback );
                       $socket is the non-ssl socket you got from somewhere ( required )
                       $version is the SSL version you want to use
                       $options is the SSL options you want to use
                       $ctx is the custom SSL context you want to use
                       $callback is the callback hook on success/failure of sslification

                       # This is an example of the callback and you should pass it as Client_SSLify( $socket, ... , \&amp;callback );
                       sub callback {
                               my( $socket, $status, $errval ) = @_;
                               # $socket is the original sslified socket in case you need to play with it
                               # $status is either 1 or 0; with 1 signifying success and 0 failure
                               # $errval will be defined if $status == 0; it's the numeric SSL error code
                               # check <a href="http://www.openssl.org/docs/ssl/SSL_get_error.html">http://www.openssl.org/docs/ssl/SSL_get_error.html</a> for the possible error values ( and import them from Net::SSLeay! )

                               # The return value from the callback is discarded
                       }

       If $ctx is defined, SSLify will ignore $version and $options. Otherwise, it will be created from the
       $version and $options parameters. If all of them are undefined, it will follow the defaults in
       "SSLify_ContextCreate".

       BEWARE: If you passed in a CTX, SSLify will do Net::SSLeay::CTX_free( $ctx ) when the socket is
       destroyed. This means you cannot reuse contexts!

       NOTE: The way to have a client socket with proper certificates set up is:

               my $socket = shift;     # get the socket from somewhere
               my $ctx = SSLify_ContextCreate( 'server.key', 'server.crt' );
               $socket = Client_SSLify( $socket, undef, undef, $ctx );

       NOTE: You can pass the callback anywhere in the arguments, we'll figure it out for you! If you want to
       call a POE event, please look into the postback/callback stuff in POE::Session.

               # we got this from POE::Wheel::SocketFactory
               sub event_SuccessEvent {
                       my $socket = $_[ARG0];
                       $socket = Client_SSLify( $socket, $_[SESSION]-&gt;callback( 'sslify_result' ) );
                       $_[HEAP]-&gt;{client} = POE::Wheel::ReadWrite-&gt;new(
                               Handle =&gt; $socket,
                               ...
                       );
                       return;
               }

               # the callback event
               sub event_sslify_result {
                       my ($creation_args, $called_args) = @_[ARG0, ARG1];
                       my( $socket, $status, $errval ) = @$called_args;

                       if ( $status ) {
                               print "Yay, SSLification worked!";
                       } else {
                               print "Aw, SSLification failed with error $errval";
                       }
               }

   <b>Server_SSLify</b>
       This function sslifies a server-side socket. You can pass several options to it:

               my $socket = shift;
               $socket = Server_SSLify( $socket, $ctx, $callback );
                       $socket is the non-ssl socket you got from somewhere ( required )
                       $ctx is the custom SSL context you want to use; overrides the global ctx set in SSLify_Options
                       $callback is the callback hook on success/failure of sslification

       BEWARE: "SSLify_Options" must be called first if you aren't passing a $ctx. If you want to set some
       options per-connection, do this:

               my $socket = shift;     # get the socket from somewhere
               my $ctx = SSLify_ContextCreate();
               # set various options on $ctx as desired
               $socket = Server_SSLify( $socket, $ctx );

       NOTE: You can use "SSLify_GetCTX" to modify the global, and avoid doing this on every connection if the
       options are the same...

       Please look at "Client_SSLify" for more details on the callback hook.

   <b>SSLify_ContextCreate</b>
       Accepts some options, and returns a brand-new Net::SSLeay context object ( $ctx )

               my $ctx = SSLify_ContextCreate( $key, $cert, $version, $options );
                       $key is the certificate key file
                       $cert is the certificate file
                       $version is the SSL version to use
                       $options is the SSL options to use

       You can then call various Net::SSLeay methods on the context

               my $mode = Net::SSLeay::CTX_get_mode( $ctx );

       By default we don't use the SSL key + certificate files

       By default we use the version: default. Known versions of the SSL connection - look at
       &lt;<a href="http://www.openssl.org/docs/ssl/SSL_CTX_new.html">http://www.openssl.org/docs/ssl/SSL_CTX_new.html</a>&gt; for more info.

               * sslv2
               * sslv3
               * tlsv1
               * sslv23
               * default ( sslv23 )

       By default we don't set any options - look at &lt;<a href="http://www.openssl.org/docs/ssl/SSL_CTX_set_options.html">http://www.openssl.org/docs/ssl/SSL_CTX_set_options.html</a>&gt;
       for more info.

   <b>SSLify_Options</b>
       Call this function to initialize the global server-side context object. This will be the default context
       whenever you call "Server_SSLify" without passing a custom context to it.

               SSLify_Options( $key, $cert, $version, $options );
                       $key is the certificate key file ( required )
                       $cert is the certificate file ( required )
                       $version is the SSL version to use
                       $options is the SSL options to use

       By default we use the version: default

       By default we use the options: Net::SSLeay::OP_ALL

       Please look at "SSLify_ContextCreate" for more info on the available versions/options.

   <b>SSLify_GetCTX</b>
       Returns the actual Net::SSLeay context object in case you wanted to play with it :)

       If passed in a socket, it will return that socket's $ctx instead of the global.

               my $ctx = SSLify_GetCTX();                      # get the one set via SSLify_Options
               my $ctx = SSLify_GetCTX( $sslified_sock );      # get the one in the object

   <b>SSLify_GetCipher</b>
       Returns the cipher used by the SSLified socket

               print "SSL Cipher is: " . SSLify_GetCipher( $sslified_sock ) . "\n";

       NOTE: Doing this immediately after Client_SSLify or Server_SSLify will result in "(NONE)" because the SSL
       handshake is not done yet. The socket is nonblocking, so you will have to wait a little bit for it to get
       ready.

               Input: ^C
               stopped at serverclient.pl line 126.

   <b>SSLify_GetSocket</b>
       Returns the actual socket used by the SSLified socket, useful for stuff like <b>getpeername()</b>/<b>getsockname()</b>

               print "Remote IP is: " . inet_ntoa( ( unpack_sockaddr_in( getpeername( SSLify_GetSocket( $sslified_sock ) ) ) )[1] ) . "\n";

   <b>SSLify_GetSSL</b>
       Returns the actual Net::SSLeay object so you can call methods on it

               print Net::SSLeay::dump_peer_certificate( SSLify_GetSSL( $sslified_sock ) );

   <b>SSLify_GetStatus</b>
       Returns the status of the SSL negotiation/handshake/connection. See
       &lt;<a href="http://www.openssl.org/docs/ssl/SSL_connect.html">http://www.openssl.org/docs/ssl/SSL_connect.html</a>#RETURN_VALUES&gt; for more info.

               my $status = SSLify_GetStatus( $socket );
                       -1 = still in negotiation stage ( or error )
                        0 = internal SSL error, connection will be dead
                        1 = negotiation successful

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Socket</b> <b>methods</b> <b>doesn't</b> <b>work</b>
       The new socket this module gives you actually is tied socket magic, so you cannot do stuff like
       <b>getpeername()</b> or <b>getsockname()</b>. The only way to do it is to use "SSLify_GetSocket" and then operate on
       the socket it returns.

   <b>Dying</b> <b>everywhere...</b>
       This module will <b>die()</b> if Net::SSLeay could not be loaded or it is not the version we want. So, it is
       recommended that you check for errors and not use SSL, like so:

               eval { use POE::Component::SSLify };
               if ( $@ ) {
                       $sslavailable = 0;
               } else {
                       $sslavailable = 1;
               }

               # Make socket SSL!
               if ( $sslavailable ) {
                       eval { $socket = POE::Component::SSLify::Client_SSLify( $socket ) };
                       if ( $@ ) {
                               # Unable to SSLify the socket...
                       }
               }

       <u>$IGNORE_SSL_ERRORS</u>

       As of SSLify v1.003 you can override this variable to temporarily ignore some SSL errors. This is useful
       if you are doing crazy things with the underlying Net::SSLeay stuff and don't want to die. However, it
       won't ignore all errors as some is still considered fatal.  Here's an example:

               {
                       local $POE::Component::SSLify::IGNORE_SSL_ERRORS=1;
                       my $ctx = SSLify_CreateContext(...);
                       #Some more stuff
               }

   <b>OpenSSL</b> <b>functions</b>
       Theoretically you can do anything that Net::SSLeay exports from the OpenSSL libs on the socket. However,
       I have not tested every possible function against SSLify, so use them carefully!

       <u>Net::SSLeay::renegotiate</u>

       This function has been tested ( it's in "t/2_renegotiate_client.t" ) but it doesn't work on FreeBSD! I
       tracked it down to this security advisory:
       &lt;<a href="http://security.freebsd.org/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-09">http://security.freebsd.org/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-09</a>:15.ssl.asc&gt; which explains it in detail. The test
       will skip this function if it detects that you're on a broken system. However, if you have the updated
       OpenSSL library that fixes this you can use it.

       NOTE: Calling this means the callback function you passed in "Client_SSLify" or "Server_SSLify" will not
       fire! If you need this please let me know and we can come up with a way to make it work.

   <b>Upgrading</b> <b>a</b> <b>non-ssl</b> <b>socket</b> <b>to</b> <b>SSL</b>
       You can have a normal plaintext socket, and convert it to SSL anytime. Just keep in mind that the client
       and the server must agree to sslify at the same time, or they will be waiting on each other forever! See
       "t/3_upgrade.t" for an example of how this works.

   <b>Downgrading</b> <b>a</b> <b>SSL</b> <b>socket</b> <b>to</b> <b>non-ssl</b>
       As of now this is unsupported. If you need this feature please let us know and we'll work on it together!

   <b>MSWin32</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>supported</b>
       This module doesn't work on MSWin32 platforms at all ( XP, Vista, 7, etc ) because of some weird
       underlying fd issues. Since I'm not a windows developer, I'm unable to fix this. However, it seems like
       Cygwin on MSWin32 works just fine! Please help me fix this if you can, thanks!

   <b>LOAD_SSL_ENGINES</b>
       OpenSSL supports loading ENGINEs to accelerate the crypto algorithms. SSLify v1.004 automatically loaded
       the engines, but there was some problems on certain platforms that caused coredumps. A big shout-out to
       BinGOs and CPANTesters for catching this! It's now disabled in v1.007 and you would need to explicitly
       enable it.

               sub POE::Component::SSLify::LOAD_SSL_ENGINES () { 1 }
               use POE::Component::SSLify qw( Client::SSLify );

</pre><h4><b>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</b></h4><pre>
               Original code is entirely Rocco Caputo ( Creator of POE ) -&gt; I simply
               packaged up the code into something everyone could use and accepted the burden
               of maintaining it :)

               From the PoCo::Client::HTTP code =]
               # This code should probably become a POE::Kernel method,
               # seeing as it's rather baroque and potentially useful in a number
               # of places.

       ASCENT also helped a lot with the nonblocking mode, without his hard work  this  module  would  still  be
       stuck in the stone age :)

       A lot of people helped add various features/functions - please look at the changelog for more detail.
