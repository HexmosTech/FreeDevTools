</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       POE::Component::IRC::Projects - A listing of projects that use POE::Component::IRC

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        perldoc POE::Component::IRC::Projects

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       POE::Component::IRC::Projects strives to document projects that are using POE::Component::IRC&gt;. Projects
       can include subclasses, bot frameworks, bots, etc. The only stipulation for inclusion is that the project
       utilises POE::Component::IRC&gt;.

       Inclusion to ( or inversely, exclusion from ) this list does not imply any sort of endorsement ( or
       disapproval ) of the said project.

</pre><h4><b>BOT</b> <b>FRAMEWORKS</b> <b>(</b> <b>CPAN</b> <b>)</b></h4><pre>
       An alphabetically ordered list of bot frameworks, that are available on CPAN.

       Amethyst
           Amethyst  is  a  bot core capable of handling parsing and routing of messages between connections and
           brains. Amethyst can handle  an  arbitrary  number  of  connections  of  arbitrary  types  (given  an
           appropriate  module  in  Amethyst::Connection::*),  routing these messages fairly arbitrarily through
           multiple processing cores (brains, live in Amethyst::Brain::*), and responding to these  messages  on
           other arbitrary connections.

       Bot::BasicBot
           Basic  bot  system  designed  to  make it easy to do simple bots, optionally forking longer processes
           (like searches) concurrently in the background.

       Bot::Pluggable
           This is a very small (but important) part of a pluggable IRC bot framework. It provides the developer
           with a simply framework for writing Bot components as Perl modules.

       Bot::Infobot
           Bot::BasicBot::Pluggable based replacement for the venerable infobot.

       IRC::Bot
           A complete bot, similar to eggdrop using POE::Component::IRC.  Allows  access  to  all  channel  user
           management  modes. Provides !seen functions, a complete help system, logging, dcc chat interface, and
           it runs as a daemon process. IRC::Bot utilizes Cache::FileCache for seen functions, and  for  session
           handling.

       ThreatNet::Bot::AmmoBot
           ThreatNet::Bot::AmmoBot is the basic foot soldier of the ThreatNet bot ecosystem, fetching ammunition
           and bringing it to the channel. It connects to a single ThreatNet channel, and then tails one or more
           files scanning for threat messages while following the basic channel rules.

</pre><h4><b>EXTENSIONS</b> <b>(</b> <b>CPAN</b> <b>)</b></h4><pre>
       POE::Component::IRC::Plugin::RSS::Headlines
           A POE::Component::IRC plugin that provides RSS headline retrieval.

       POE::Component::IRC::Plugin::URI::Find
           A POE::Component::IRC plugin that finds URIs in channel traffic.

       POE::Component::IRC::Plugin::POE::Knee
           A POE::Component::IRC plugin that runs Acme::POE::Knee races.

       POE::Component::IRC::Plugin::Blowfish
           A POE::Component::IRC plugin that provides blowfish encryption.

       POE::Component::IRC::Plugin::YouTube::MovieFindStore
           A plugin for finding, resolving .FLV, and optionally storing YouTube URIs.

       POE::Component::IRC::Object
           A slightly simpler OO interface to PoCoIRC

       POE::Component::IRC::Onjoin
           This  module  implements a class that provides moved message and onjoin services as an IRC bot. Based
           on the configuration parameters passed to it via its constructor it will connect to a  channel  on  a
           server  and immediately send everyone on that channel a message privately. It will also send the same
           message to the channel itself publically at the specified interval. All  users  joining  the  channel
           thereafter will also receive the message.
