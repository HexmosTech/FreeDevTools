</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       HTML::Mason::Component - Mason Component Class

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           my $comp1 = $m-&gt;current_comp;
           my $comp2 = $m-&gt;<a href="../man1/callers.1.html">callers</a>(1);
           my $comp3 = $m-&gt;fetch_comp('foo/bar');

           foreach ($comp1,$comp2,$comp3) {
              print "My name is ".$_-&gt;title.".\n";
           }

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Mason uses the Component class to store components loaded into memory. Components come from three
       distinct sources:

       1.  File-based: loaded from a source or object file.

       2.  Subcomponents: embedded components defined with the "&lt;%def&gt;" or "&lt;%method&gt;" tags.

       3.  Anonymous: created on-the-fly with the "make_component" Interp method.

       Some of the methods below return different values (or nothing at all) depending on the component type.

       The  component  API  is  primarily useful for introspection, e.g. "what component called me" or "does the
       next component take a certain argument".  You can build complex Mason sites without ever dealing directly
       with a component object.

   <b>CREATING</b> <b>AND</b> <b>ACCESSING</b> <b>COMPONENTS</b>
       Common  ways  to  get  handles  on  existing  component  objects   include   the   Request-&gt;current_comp,
       Request-&gt;callers, and Request-&gt;fetch_comp methods.

       There  is  no  published  "new"  method,  because  creating  a component requires an Interpreter. Use the
       make_component method to create a new component dynamically.

       Similarly, there is no "execute" or "call" method, because calling a component requires a request. All of
       the interfaces for calling a component ("&lt;&amp; &amp;&gt;",  "$m-&gt;comp",  "$interp-&gt;exec")  which  normally  take  a
       component path will also take a component object.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       attr (name)
           Looks for the specified attribute in this component and its parents, returning the first value found.
           Dies with an error if not found. Attributes are declared in the "&lt;%attr&gt;" section.

       attr_if_exists (name)
           This method works exactly like the one above but returns undef if the attribute does not exist.

       attr_exists (name)
           Returns  true  if  the  specified  attribute  exists  in  this component or one of its parents, undef
           otherwise.

       attributes
           Returns a hashref containing the attributes defined in this component, with the  attribute  names  as
           keys.  This does not return attributes inherited from parent components.

       call_method (name, args...)
           Looks  for the specified user-defined method in this component and its parents, calling the first one
           found. Dies with an error if not found.  Methods are declared in the "&lt;%method&gt;" section.

       create_time
           A synonym for load_time (deprecated).

       declared_args
           Returns a reference to a hash of hashes representing the arguments declared in the "&lt;%args&gt;" section.
           The keys of the main hash are the variable names including prefix (e.g. $foo, @list). Each  secondary
           hash contains:

           â€¢   'default': the string specified for default value (e.g. 'fido') or undef if none specified.  Note
               that  in  general  this  is  not  the default value itself but rather a Perl expression that gets
               evaluated every time the component runs.

           For example:

             # does $comp have an argument called $fido?
             if (exists($comp-&gt;declared_args-&gt;{'$fido'})) { ... }

             # does $fido have a default value?
             if (defined($comp-&gt;declared_args-&gt;{'$fido'}-&gt;{default})) { ... }

       dir_path
           Returns the component's notion of a current directory, relative to the component root; this  is  used
           to  resolve relative component paths. For file-based components this is the full component path minus
           the filename.  For subcomponents this is the same as the component that defines  it.   Undefined  for
           anonymous components.

       flag (name)
           Returns  the  value  for the specified system flag.  Flags are declared in the "&lt;%flags&gt;" section and
           affect the behavior of the component.  Unlike attributes, flags values  do  not  get  inherited  from
           parent components.

       is_subcomp
           Returns  true  if  this is a subcomponent of another component.  For historical reasons, this returns
           true for both methods and subcomponents.

       is_method
           Returns true if this is a method.

       is_file_based
           Returns true if this component was loaded from a source or object file.

       load_time
           Returns the time (in Perl <b>time()</b> format) when this component object was created.

       method_exists (name)
           Returns true if the specified user-defined method exists in this component or  one  of  its  parents,
           undef otherwise.

       methods
           This  method works exactly like the subcomps method, but it returns methods, not subcomponents.  This
           does not return methods inherited from parent components.

           Methods are declared in "&lt;%method&gt;" sections.

       name
           Returns a short name of the component.  For file-based components this is the  filename  without  the
           path. For subcomponents this is the name specified in "&lt;%def&gt;". Undefined for anonymous components.

       object_file
           Returns the object filename for this component.

       parent
           Returns  the  parent of this component for inheritance purposes, by default the nearest "autohandler"
           in or above the component's directory.  Can be changed via the "inherit" flag.

       path
           Returns the entire path of this component, relative to the component root.

       scall_method (name, args...)
           Like item_call_method, but returns the method output as a  string  instead  of  printing  it.  (Think
           sprintf versus printf.) The method's return value, if any, is discarded.

       subcomps
           With  no  arguments,  returns  a hashref containing the subcomponents defined in this component, with
           names as keys and component objects as values.  With one argument, returns the subcomponent  of  that
           name or undef if no such subcomponent exists. e.g.

               if (my $subcomp = $comp-&gt;subcomps('.link')) {
                   ...
               }

           Subcomponents are declared in "&lt;%def&gt;" sections.

       title
           Returns  a printable string denoting this component.  It is intended to uniquely identify a component
           within a given interpreter although this is not 100% guaranteed. Mason  uses  this  string  in  error
           messages, among other places.

           For   file-based   components   this   is   the   component   path.    For   subcomponents   this  is
           "parent_component_path:subcomponent_name". For anonymous components  this  is  a  unique  label  like
           "[anon 17]".

</pre><h4><b>FILE-BASED</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       The  following  methods  apply  only to file-based components (those loaded from source or object files).
       They return undef for other component types.

       source_file
           Returns the source filename for this component.

       source_dir
           Returns the directory of the source filename for this component.
