</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Crypt::URandom - Provide non blocking randomness

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This document describes Crypt::URandom version 0.54

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Crypt::URandom();

           my $random_string_50_bytes_long = Crypt::URandom::<a href="../man50/urandom.50.html">urandom</a>(50);

       OR

           use Crypt::URandom qw( urandom );

           my $random_string_50_bytes_long = <a href="../man50/urandom.50.html">urandom</a>(50);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This Module is intended to provide an interface to the strongest available source of non-blocking
       randomness on the current platform.  Platforms currently supported are anything supporting <b><a href="../man2/getrandom.2.html">getrandom</a></b>(2),
       /dev/urandom and versions of Windows greater than or equal to Windows 2000.

</pre><h4><b>SUBROUTINES/METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       "urandom"
           This  function  accepts  an integer and returns a string of the same size filled with random data. It
           will throw an exception if the requested amount of random data is not returned. The first  call  will
           initialize  the  native  cryptographic  libraries  (if  necessary)  and  load  all  the required Perl
           libraries.  This call is a buffered read on non Win32 platforms that do not support  <b><a href="../man2/getrandom.2.html">getrandom</a></b>(2)  or
           equivalent.

       "urandom_ub"
           This  function  accepts an integer and returns a string of the same size filled with random data.  It
           will throw an exception if the requested amount of random data is not returned.  The first call  will
           initialize  the  native  cryptographic  libraries  (if  necessary)  and  load  all  the required Perl
           libraries.  This call is a unbuffered sysread on non Win32 platforms that do not support <b><a href="../man2/getrandom.2.html">getrandom</a></b>(2)
           or equivalent.

       "getrandom"
           This function accepts an integer and returns a string of the same size filled  with  random  data  on
           platforms  that implement <b><a href="../man2/getrandom.2.html">getrandom</a></b>(2).  It will throw an exception if the requested amount of random
           data is not returned.  This is NOT portable across all operating systems, but is  made  available  if
           high-speed generation of random numbers is required.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       "No secure alternative for random number generation for Win32 versions older than W2K"
           The  module  cannot run on versions of Windows earlier than Windows 2000 as there is no cryptographic
           functions provided by the operating system.

       "Could not import CryptAcquireContext"
           The module was unable to load the CryptAcquireContextA function from the  advapi32  dynamic  library.
           The advapi32 library cannot probably be loaded.

       "CryptAcquireContext failed"
           The module was unable to call the CryptAcquireContextA function from the advapi32 dynamic library.

       "Could not import CryptGenRandom"
           The module was unable to load the CryptGenRandom function from the advapi32 dynamic library.

       "Could not import SystemFunction036"
           The module was unable to load the SystemFunction036 function from the advapi32 dynamic library.

       "The length argument must be supplied and must be an integer"
           The  get  method  must  be  called  with  an  integer  argument to describe how many random bytes are
           required.

       "CryptGenRandom failed"
           The Windows 2000 CryptGenRandom method call failed to generate the required amount of randomness

       "RtlGenRand failed"
           The post Windows 2000 RtlGenRand method call failed to generate the required amount of randomness

       "Only read n bytes from path"
           The /dev/urandom device did not return the desired amount of random bytes

       "Failed to read from path"
           The /dev/urandom device returned an error when being read from

       "Failed to open path"
           The /dev/urandom device returned an error when being opened

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>AND</b> <b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       Crypt::URandom requires no configuration files or environment variables.

       If the environment variable CRYPT_URANDOM_BUILD_DEBUG is specified when  running  "perl  Makefile.PL"  or
       "make  test"  AND  <b><a href="../man2/getrandom.2.html">getrandom</a></b>(2) or it's equivalents cannot be detected, extra debug will be shown to show
       the failures to detect these functions.

</pre><h4><b>DEPENDENCIES</b></h4><pre>
           If the platform is Win32, the Win32::API module will be required.  Otherwise no other  modules  other
           than those provided by perl will be required

</pre><h4><b>INCOMPATIBILITIES</b></h4><pre>
       None reported.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
