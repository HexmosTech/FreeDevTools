       <b>CLATRS3</b> solves a triangular system of equations with the scale factors set to prevent overflow.

       <b>Purpose:</b>

            CLATRS3 solves one of the triangular systems

               A * X = B * diag(scale),  A**T * X = B * diag(scale), or
               A**H * X = B * diag(scale)

            with scaling to prevent overflow.  Here A is an upper or lower
            triangular matrix, A**T denotes the transpose of A, A**H denotes the
            conjugate transpose of A. X and B are n-by-nrhs matrices and scale
            is an nrhs-element vector of scaling factors. A scaling factor scale(j)
            is usually less than or equal to 1, chosen such that X(:,j) is less
            than the overflow threshold. If the matrix A is singular (A(j,j) = 0
            for some j), then a non-trivial solution to A*X = 0 is returned. If
            the system is so badly scaled that the solution cannot be represented
            as (1/scale(k))*X(:,k), then x(:,k) = 0 and scale(k) is returned.

            This is a BLAS-3 version of LATRS for solving several right
            hand sides simultaneously.

                     = 'Y':  CNORM contains the column norms on entry
                     = 'N':  CNORM is not set on entry.  On exit, the norms will
                             be computed and stored in CNORM.

                     triangular matrix, and the strictly lower triangular part of

                     A * x(:,k) = s(k)*b(:,k)  or  A**T* x(:,k) = s(k)*b(:,k).
                     If SCALE = 0, the matrix A is singular or badly scaled.
                     If A(j,j) = 0 is encountered, a non-trivial vector x(:,k)
                     that is an exact or approximate solution to A*x(:,k) = 0
                     is returned. If the system so badly scaled that solution
                     cannot be presented as x(:,k) * 1/s(k), then x(:,k) = 0
                     is returned.

           <u>CNORM</u>

                     CNORM is REAL array, dimension (N)

                     If NORMIN = 'Y', CNORM is an input argument and CNORM(j)
                     contains the norm of the off-diagonal part of the j-th column
                     of A.  If TRANS = 'N', CNORM(j) must be greater than or equal
                     to the infinity-norm, and if TRANS = 'T' or 'C', CNORM(j)
                     must be greater than or equal to the 1-norm.

                     If NORMIN = 'N', CNORM is an output argument and CNORM(j)
                     returns the 1-norm of the offdiagonal part of the j-th column
                     of A.

           <u>WORK</u>

                     WORK is REAL array, dimension (MAX(1,LWORK)).
                     On exit, if INFO = 0, <a href="../man1/WORK.1.html">WORK</a>(1) returns the optimal size of
                     WORK.

                     NBA = (N + NB - 1)/NB and NB is the optimal block size.

                     If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine
                     only calculates the optimal dimensions of the WORK array, returns
                     this value as the first entry of the WORK array, and no error
                     message related to LWORK is issued by XERBLA.

           <u>INFO</u>

                     INFO is INTEGER
                     = 0:  successful exit
                     &lt; 0:  if INFO = -k, the k-th argument had an illegal value

       <b>DLATRS3</b> solves a triangular system of equations with the scale factors set to prevent overflow.

       <b>Purpose:</b>

            DLATRS3 solves one of the triangular systems

            factors. A scaling factor scale(j) is usually less than or equal

       <b>SLATRS3</b> solves a triangular system of equations with the scale factors set to prevent overflow.

       <b>Purpose:</b>

            SLATRS3 solves one of the triangular systems

               A * X = B * diag(scale)  or  A**T * X = B * diag(scale)

            with scaling to prevent overflow.  Here A is an upper or lower
            triangular matrix, A**T denotes the transpose of A. X and B are
            n by nrhs matrices and scale is an nrhs element vector of scaling
            factors. A scaling factor scale(j) is usually less than or equal
            to 1, chosen such that X(:,j) is less than the overflow threshold.
            If the matrix A is singular (A(j,j) = 0 for some j), then
            a non-trivial solution to A*X = 0 is returned. If the system is
            so badly scaled that the solution cannot be represented as
            (1/scale(k))*X(:,k), then x(:,k) = 0 and scale(k) is returned.

            This is a BLAS-3 version of LATRS for solving several right
            hand sides simultaneously.

                     A * x(:,k) = s(k)*b(:,k)  or  A**T* x(:,k) = s(k)*b(:,k).
                     If SCALE = 0, the matrix A is singular or badly scaled.
                     If A(j,j) = 0 is encountered, a non-trivial vector x(:,k)
                     that is an exact or approximate solution to A*x(:,k) = 0

                     cannot be presented as x(:,k) * 1/s(k), then x(:,k) = 0
                     is returned.

                     CNORM is REAL array, dimension (N)

                     must be greater than or equal to the 1-norm.

                     returns the 1-norm of the offdiagonal part of the j-th column
                     of A.

           <u>WORK</u>

                     If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine
                     only calculates the optimal dimensions of the WORK array, returns
                     this value as the first entry of the WORK array, and no error
                     message related to LWORK is issued by XERBLA.

           <u>INFO</u>

                     INFO is INTEGER
                     = 0:  successful exit

       <b>ZLATRS3</b> solves a triangular system of equations with the scale factors set to prevent overflow.

       <b>Purpose:</b>

            ZLATRS3 solves one of the triangular systems

               A * X = B * diag(scale),  A**T * X = B * diag(scale), or
               A**H * X = B * diag(scale)

            with scaling to prevent overflow.  Here A is an upper or lower
            triangular matrix, A**T denotes the transpose of A, A**H denotes the
            conjugate transpose of A. X and B are n-by-nrhs matrices and scale
            is an nrhs-element vector of scaling factors. A scaling factor scale(j)
            is usually less than or equal to 1, chosen such that X(:,j) is less
            than the overflow threshold. If the matrix A is singular (A(j,j) = 0
            for some j), then a non-trivial solution to A*X = 0 is returned. If
            the system is so badly scaled that the solution cannot be represented
            as (1/scale(k))*X(:,k), then x(:,k) = 0 and scale(k) is returned.
