       <b>CLATPS</b> solves a triangular system of equations with the matrix held in packed storage.

       <b>Purpose:</b>

            CLATPS solves one of the triangular systems

               A * x = s*b,  A**T * x = s*b,  or  A**H * x = s*b,

            with scaling to prevent overflow, where A is an upper or lower
            triangular matrix stored in packed form.  Here A**T denotes the
            transpose of A, A**H denotes the conjugate transpose of A, x and b
            are n-element vectors, and s is a scaling factor, usually less than
            or equal to 1, chosen so that the components of x will be less than
            the overflow threshold.  If the unscaled problem will not cause
            overflow, the Level 2 BLAS routine CTPSV is called. If the matrix A
            is singular (A(j,j) = 0 for some j), then s is set to 0 and a
            non-trivial solution to A*x = 0 is returned.

       <b>Further</b> <b>Details:</b>

             A rough bound on x is computed; if that is less than overflow, CTPSV
             is called, otherwise, specific code is used which checks for possible
             overflow or divide-by-zero at every operation.

             A columnwise scheme is used for solving A*x = b.  The basic algorithm
             if A is lower triangular is

                  x[1:n] := b[1:n]
                  for j = 1, ..., n
                       x(j) := x(j) / A(j,j)
                       x[j+1:n] := x[j+1:n] - x(j) * A[j+1:n,j]
                  end

             Define bounds on the components of x after j iterations of the loop:
                M(j) = bound on x[1:j]
                G(j) = bound on x[j+1:n]
             Initially, let <a href="../man0/M.0.html">M</a>(0) = 0 and <a href="../man0/G.0.html">G</a>(0) = max{x(i), i=1,...,n}.

             Then for iteration j+1 we have
                M(j+1) &lt;= G(j) / | A(j+1,j+1) |
                G(j+1) &lt;= G(j) + M(j+1) * | A[j+2:n,j+1] |
                       &lt;= G(j) ( 1 + CNORM(j+1) / | A(j+1,j+1) | )

             where CNORM(j+1) is greater than or equal to the infinity-norm of
             column j+1 of A, not counting the diagonal.  Hence

                G(j) &lt;= <a href="../man0/G.0.html">G</a>(0) product ( 1 + CNORM(i) / | A(i,i) | )
                             1&lt;=i&lt;=j
             and

                |x(j)| &lt;= ( <a href="../man0/G.0.html">G</a>(0) / |A(j,j)| ) product ( 1 + CNORM(i) / |A(i,i)| )
                                              1&lt;=i&lt; j

             Since |x(j)| &lt;= M(j), we use the Level 2 BLAS routine CTPSV if the
             reciprocal of the largest M(j), j=1,..,n, is larger than
             max(underflow, 1/overflow).

             The bound on x(j) is also used to determine when a step in the
             columnwise method can be performed without fear of overflow.  If
             the computed bound is greater than a large constant, x is scaled to
             prevent overflow, but if the bound overflows, x is set to 0, x(j) to
             1, and scale to 0, and a non-trivial solution to A*x = 0 is found.

             Similarly, a row-wise scheme is used to solve A**T *x = b  or
             A**H *x = b.  The basic algorithm for A upper triangular is

                  for j = 1, ..., n
                       x(j) := ( b(j) - A[1:j-1,j]' * x[1:j-1] ) / A(j,j)
                  end

             We simultaneously compute two bounds
                  G(j) = bound on ( b(i) - A[1:i-1,i]' * x[1:i-1] ), 1&lt;=i&lt;=j
                  M(j) = bound on x(i), 1&lt;=i&lt;=j

             The initial values are <a href="../man0/G.0.html">G</a>(0) = 0, <a href="../man0/M.0.html">M</a>(0) = max{b(i), i=1,..,n}, and we
             add the constraint G(j) &gt;= G(j-1) and M(j) &gt;= M(j-1) for j &gt;= 1.
             Then the bound on x(j) is

                  M(j) &lt;= M(j-1) * ( 1 + CNORM(j) ) / | A(j,j) |

                       &lt;= <a href="../man0/M.0.html">M</a>(0) * product ( ( 1 + CNORM(i) ) / |A(i,i)| )
                                 1&lt;=i&lt;=j

             and we can safely call CTPSV if 1/M(n) and 1/G(n) are both greater
             than max(underflow, 1/overflow).

       <b>DLATPS</b> solves a triangular system of equations with the matrix held in packed storage.

       <b>Purpose:</b>

            DLATPS solves one of the triangular systems

               A *x = s*b  or  A**T*x = s*b

            with scaling to prevent overflow, where A is an upper or lower
            triangular matrix stored in packed form.  Here A**T denotes the

            factor, usually less than or equal to 1, chosen so that the

                G(j) &lt;= <a href="../man0/G.0.html">G</a>(0) product ( 1 + CNORM(i) / | A(i,i) | )
                             1&lt;=i&lt;=j
             and

                |x(j)| &lt;= ( <a href="../man0/G.0.html">G</a>(0) / |A(j,j)| ) product ( 1 + CNORM(i) / |A(i,i)| )
                                              1&lt;=i&lt; j

             Since |x(j)| &lt;= M(j), we use the Level 2 BLAS routine DTPSV if the
             reciprocal of the largest M(j), j=1,..,n, is larger than
             max(underflow, 1/overflow).

             The bound on x(j) is also used to determine when a step in the
             columnwise method can be performed without fear of overflow.  If
             the computed bound is greater than a large constant, x is scaled to
             prevent overflow, but if the bound overflows, x is set to 0, x(j) to
             1, and scale to 0, and a non-trivial solution to A*x = 0 is found.

             Similarly, a row-wise scheme is used to solve A**T*x = b.  The basic
             algorithm for A upper triangular is

                  for j = 1, ..., n
                       x(j) := ( b(j) - A[1:j-1,j]**T * x[1:j-1] ) / A(j,j)
                  end

             We simultaneously compute two bounds
                  G(j) = bound on ( b(i) - A[1:i-1,i]**T * x[1:i-1] ), 1&lt;=i&lt;=j
                  M(j) = bound on x(i), 1&lt;=i&lt;=j

             The initial values are <a href="../man0/G.0.html">G</a>(0) = 0, <a href="../man0/M.0.html">M</a>(0) = max{b(i), i=1,..,n}, and we
             add the constraint G(j) &gt;= G(j-1) and M(j) &gt;= M(j-1) for j &gt;= 1.
             Then the bound on x(j) is

                  M(j) &lt;= M(j-1) * ( 1 + CNORM(j) ) / | A(j,j) |

                       &lt;= <a href="../man0/M.0.html">M</a>(0) * product ( ( 1 + CNORM(i) ) / |A(i,i)| )
                                 1&lt;=i&lt;=j

             and we can safely call DTPSV if 1/M(n) and 1/G(n) are both greater
             than max(underflow, 1/overflow).

       <b>SLATPS</b> solves a triangular system of equations with the matrix held in packed storage.

       <b>Purpose:</b>

            SLATPS solves one of the triangular systems

               A *x = s*b  or  A**T*x = s*b

            with scaling to prevent overflow, where A is an upper or lower
            triangular matrix stored in packed form.  Here A**T denotes the
            transpose of A, x and b are n-element vectors, and s is a scaling
            factor, usually less than or equal to 1, chosen so that the
            components of x will be less than the overflow threshold.  If the
            unscaled problem will not cause overflow, the Level 2 BLAS routine
            STPSV is called. If the matrix A is singular (A(j,j) = 0 for some j),
            then s is set to 0 and a non-trivial solution to A*x = 0 is returned.

       <b>Further</b> <b>Details:</b>

             A rough bound on x is computed; if that is less than overflow, STPSV
             is called, otherwise, specific code is used which checks for possible
             overflow or divide-by-zero at every operation.

             A columnwise scheme is used for solving A*x = b.  The basic algorithm
             if A is lower triangular is

                  x[1:n] := b[1:n]
                  for j = 1, ..., n
                       x(j) := x(j) / A(j,j)
                       x[j+1:n] := x[j+1:n] - x(j) * A[j+1:n,j]
                  end

             Define bounds on the components of x after j iterations of the loop:
                M(j) = bound on x[1:j]
                G(j) = bound on x[j+1:n]
             Initially, let <a href="../man0/M.0.html">M</a>(0) = 0 and <a href="../man0/G.0.html">G</a>(0) = max{x(i), i=1,...,n}.

             Then for iteration j+1 we have
                M(j+1) &lt;= G(j) / | A(j+1,j+1) |
                G(j+1) &lt;= G(j) + M(j+1) * | A[j+2:n,j+1] |
                       &lt;= G(j) ( 1 + CNORM(j+1) / | A(j+1,j+1) | )

             where CNORM(j+1) is greater than or equal to the infinity-norm of
             column j+1 of A, not counting the diagonal.  Hence

                G(j) &lt;= <a href="../man0/G.0.html">G</a>(0) product ( 1 + CNORM(i) / | A(i,i) | )

             and

             Since |x(j)| &lt;= M(j), we use the Level 2 BLAS routine STPSV if the
             reciprocal of the largest M(j), j=1,..,n, is larger than
             max(underflow, 1/overflow).

             The bound on x(j) is also used to determine when a step in the

             1, and scale to 0, and a non-trivial solution to A*x = 0 is found.

                       x(j) := x(j) / A(j,j)
                       x[j+1:n] := x[j+1:n] - x(j) * A[j+1:n,j]
                  end

             Define bounds on the components of x after j iterations of the loop:
                M(j) = bound on x[1:j]
                G(j) = bound on x[j+1:n]
             Initially, let <a href="../man0/M.0.html">M</a>(0) = 0 and <a href="../man0/G.0.html">G</a>(0) = max{x(i), i=1,...,n}.

             Then for iteration j+1 we have
                M(j+1) &lt;= G(j) / | A(j+1,j+1) |
                G(j+1) &lt;= G(j) + M(j+1) * | A[j+2:n,j+1] |
                       &lt;= G(j) ( 1 + CNORM(j+1) / | A(j+1,j+1) | )

             where CNORM(j+1) is greater than or equal to the infinity-norm of
             column j+1 of A, not counting the diagonal.  Hence

                G(j) &lt;= <a href="../man0/G.0.html">G</a>(0) product ( 1 + CNORM(i) / | A(i,i) | )
                             1&lt;=i&lt;=j
             and

                |x(j)| &lt;= ( <a href="../man0/G.0.html">G</a>(0) / |A(j,j)| ) product ( 1 + CNORM(i) / |A(i,i)| )
                                              1&lt;=i&lt; j

             Since |x(j)| &lt;= M(j), we use the Level 2 BLAS routine ZTPSV if the
             reciprocal of the largest M(j), j=1,..,n, is larger than
             max(underflow, 1/overflow).

             The bound on x(j) is also used to determine when a step in the
             columnwise method can be performed without fear of overflow.  If
             the computed bound is greater than a large constant, x is scaled to
             prevent overflow, but if the bound overflows, x is set to 0, x(j) to
             1, and scale to 0, and a non-trivial solution to A*x = 0 is found.

             Similarly, a row-wise scheme is used to solve A**T *x = b  or
             A**H *x = b.  The basic algorithm for A upper triangular is

                  for j = 1, ..., n
                       x(j) := ( b(j) - A[1:j-1,j]' * x[1:j-1] ) / A(j,j)
                  end

             We simultaneously compute two bounds
                  G(j) = bound on ( b(i) - A[1:i-1,i]' * x[1:i-1] ), 1&lt;=i&lt;=j
                  M(j) = bound on x(i), 1&lt;=i&lt;=j

             The initial values are <a href="../man0/G.0.html">G</a>(0) = 0, <a href="../man0/M.0.html">M</a>(0) = max{b(i), i=1,..,n}, and we
             add the constraint G(j) &gt;= G(j-1) and M(j) &gt;= M(j-1) for j &gt;= 1.
             Then the bound on x(j) is

                  M(j) &lt;= M(j-1) * ( 1 + CNORM(j) ) / | A(j,j) |

                       &lt;= <a href="../man0/M.0.html">M</a>(0) * product ( ( 1 + CNORM(i) ) / |A(i,i)| )
                                 1&lt;=i&lt;=j

             and we can safely call ZTPSV if 1/M(n) and 1/G(n) are both greater
             than max(underflow, 1/overflow).
