       <b>DLAQTR</b> solves a real quasi-triangular system of equations, or a complex quasi-triangular system of
       special form, in real arithmetic.

       <b>Purpose:</b>

            DLAQTR solves the real quasi-triangular system

                         op(T)*p = scale*c,               if LREAL = .TRUE.

            or the complex quasi-triangular systems

                       op(T + iB)*(p+iq) = scale*(c+id),  if LREAL = .FALSE.

            in real arithmetic, where T is upper quasi-triangular.
            If LREAL = .FALSE., then the first diagonal block of T must be
            1 by 1, B is the specially structured matrix

                           B = [ <a href="../man1/b.1.html">b</a>(1) <a href="../man2/b.2.html">b</a>(2) ... b(n) ]
                               [       w            ]
                               [           w        ]
                               [              .     ]
                               [                 w  ]

            op(A) = A or A**T, A**T denotes the transpose of
            matrix A.

            On input, X = [ c ].  On output, X = [ p ].
                          [ d ]                  [ q ]

            This subroutine is designed for the condition number estimation
            in routine DTRSNA.
