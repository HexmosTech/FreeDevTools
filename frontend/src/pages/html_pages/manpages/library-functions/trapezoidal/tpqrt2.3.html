       <b>Further</b> <b>Details:</b>

             The input matrix C is a (N+M)-by-N matrix

                          C = [ A ]
                              [ B ]

             where A is an upper triangular N-by-N matrix, and B is M-by-N pentagonal
             matrix consisting of a (M-L)-by-N rectangular matrix B1 on top of a L-by-N
             upper trapezoidal matrix B2:

                          B = [ B1 ]  &lt;- (M-L)-by-N rectangular
                              [ B2 ]  &lt;-     L-by-N upper trapezoidal.

             The upper trapezoidal matrix B2 consists of the first L rows of a
             N-by-N upper triangular matrix, where 0 &lt;= L &lt;= MIN(M,N).  If L=0,
             B is rectangular M-by-N; if M=L=N, B is upper triangular.

             The matrix W stores the elementary reflectors H(i) in the i-th column
             below the diagonal (of A) in the (N+M)-by-N input matrix C

                          C = [ A ]  &lt;- upper triangular N-by-N
                              [ B ]  &lt;- M-by-N pentagonal

             so that W can be represented as

                          W = [ I ]  &lt;- identity, N-by-N
                              [ V ]  &lt;- M-by-N, same form as B.

             Thus, all of information needed for W is contained on exit in B, which
             we call V above.  Note that V has the same form as B; that is,

                          V = [ V1 ] &lt;- (M-L)-by-N rectangular
                              [ V2 ] &lt;-     L-by-N upper trapezoidal.

             The columns of V represent the vectors which define the H(i)'s.
             The (M+N)-by-(M+N) block reflector H is then given by

                          H = I - W * T * W**H

             where W**H is the conjugate transpose of W and T is the upper triangular
             factor of the block reflector.

                          W = [ I ]  &lt;- identity, N-by-N
                              [ V ]  &lt;- M-by-N, same form as B.

             Thus, all of information needed for W is contained on exit in B, which

             The columns of V represent the vectors which define the H(i)'s.
             The (M+N)-by-(M+N) block reflector H is then given by

                          H = I - W * T * W^H

             where W^H is the conjugate transpose of W and T is the upper triangular
             factor of the block reflector.

       <b>Further</b> <b>Details:</b>

             The input matrix C is a (N+M)-by-N matrix

                          C = [ A ]
                              [ B ]

             where A is an upper triangular N-by-N matrix, and B is M-by-N pentagonal
             matrix consisting of a (M-L)-by-N rectangular matrix B1 on top of a L-by-N
             upper trapezoidal matrix B2:

                          B = [ B1 ]  &lt;- (M-L)-by-N rectangular
                              [ B2 ]  &lt;-     L-by-N upper trapezoidal.

             The upper trapezoidal matrix B2 consists of the first L rows of a
             N-by-N upper triangular matrix, where 0 &lt;= L &lt;= MIN(M,N).  If L=0,
             B is rectangular M-by-N; if M=L=N, B is upper triangular.

             The matrix W stores the elementary reflectors H(i) in the i-th column
             below the diagonal (of A) in the (N+M)-by-N input matrix C

                          C = [ A ]  &lt;- upper triangular N-by-N
                              [ B ]  &lt;- M-by-N pentagonal

             so that W can be represented as

                          W = [ I ]  &lt;- identity, N-by-N
                              [ V ]  &lt;- M-by-N, same form as B.

             Thus, all of information needed for W is contained on exit in B, which
             we call V above.  Note that V has the same form as B; that is,

                          V = [ V1 ] &lt;- (M-L)-by-N rectangular
                              [ V2 ] &lt;-     L-by-N upper trapezoidal.

             The columns of V represent the vectors which define the H(i)'s.
             The (M+N)-by-(M+N) block reflector H is then given by

                          H = I - W * T * W**H

             where W**H is the conjugate transpose of W and T is the upper triangular
             factor of the block reflector.
