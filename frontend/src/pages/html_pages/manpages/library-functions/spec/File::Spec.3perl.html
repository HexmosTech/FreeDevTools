       File::Spec - portably perform operations on file names

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
               use File::Spec;

               my $x = File::Spec-&gt;catfile('a', 'b', 'c');

       which returns 'a/b/c' under Unix. Or:

               use File::Spec::Functions;

               my $x = catfile('a', 'b', 'c');

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module is designed to support operations commonly performed on file specifications (usually called
       "file names", but not to be confused with the contents of a file, or Perl's file handles), such as
       concatenating several directory and file names into a single path, or determining whether a path is
       rooted. It is based on code directly taken from MakeMaker 5.17, code written by Andreas KÃ¶nig, Andy
       Dougherty, Charles Bailey, Ilya Zakharevich, Paul Schinder, and others.

       Since these functions are different for most operating systems, each set of OS specific routines is
       available in a separate module, including:

               File::Spec::Unix
               File::Spec::Mac
               File::Spec::OS2
               File::Spec::Win32
               File::Spec::VMS

       The module appropriate for the current OS is automatically loaded by File::Spec. Since some modules (like
       VMS) make use of facilities available only under that OS, it may not be possible to load all modules
       under all operating systems.

       Since File::Spec is object oriented, subroutines should not be called directly, as in:

               File::Spec::catfile('a','b');

       but rather as class methods:

               File::Spec-&gt;catfile('a','b');

       For simple uses, File::Spec::Functions provides convenient functional forms of these methods.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       canonpath
         No physical check on the filesystem, but a logical cleanup of a path.

             $cpath = File::Spec-&gt;canonpath( $path ) ;

         Note  that this does *not* collapse <u>x/../y</u> sections into <u>y</u>.  This is by design.  If <u>/foo</u> on your system
         is a symlink to <u>/bar/baz</u>, then <u>/foo/../quux</u> is actually <u>/bar/quux</u>, not <u>/quux</u>  as  a  naive  <u>../</u>-removal
         would  give  you.   If  you  want  to  do this kind of processing, you probably want "Cwd"'s realpath()
         function to actually traverse the filesystem cleaning up paths like this.

       catdir
         Concatenate two or more directory names to form a complete path ending with a directory. But remove the
         trailing slash from the resulting string, because it doesn't look good, isn't  necessary  and  confuses
         OS/2. Of course, if this is the root directory, don't cut off the trailing slash :-)

             $path = File::Spec-&gt;catdir( @directories );

       catfile
         Concatenate one or more directory names and a filename to form a complete path ending with a filename

             $path = File::Spec-&gt;catfile( @directories, $filename );

       curdir
         Returns a string representation of the current directory.

             $curdir = File::Spec-&gt;curdir();

       devnull
         Returns a string representation of the null device.

             $devnull = File::Spec-&gt;devnull();

       rootdir
         Returns a string representation of the root directory.

             $rootdir = File::Spec-&gt;rootdir();

       tmpdir
         Returns  a  string  representation  of  the  first writable directory from a list of possible temporary
         directories.  Returns the current directory if no writable temporary directories are found.   The  list
         of directories checked depends on the platform; e.g. File::Spec::Unix checks $ENV{TMPDIR} (unless taint
         is on) and <u><a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a></u>.

             $tmpdir = File::Spec-&gt;tmpdir();

       updir
         Returns a string representation of the parent directory.

             $updir = File::Spec-&gt;updir();

       no_upwards
         Given a list of files in a directory (such as from readdir()), strip out '.' and '..'.

         <b>SECURITY</b>  <b>NOTE:</b> This does NOT filter paths containing '..', like '..<a href="file:/../../../etc/passwd">/../../../etc/passwd</a>', only literal
         matches to '.' and '..'.

             @paths = File::Spec-&gt;no_upwards( readdir $dirhandle );

       case_tolerant
         Returns a true or false value indicating, respectively, that alphabetic case is not or  is  significant
         when comparing file specifications.  Cygwin and Win32 accept an optional drive argument.

             $is_case_tolerant = File::Spec-&gt;case_tolerant();

       file_name_is_absolute
         Takes as its argument a path, and returns true if it is an absolute path.

             $is_absolute = File::Spec-&gt;file_name_is_absolute( $path );

         This  does not consult the local filesystem on Unix, Win32, OS/2, or Mac OS (Classic).  It does consult
         the working environment for VMS (see "file_name_is_absolute" in File::Spec::VMS).

       path
         Takes no argument.  Returns the environment variable "PATH" (or the local platform's equivalent)  as  a
         list.

             @PATH = File::Spec-&gt;path();

       join
         join is the same as catfile.

       splitpath
         Splits  a  path  in  to volume, directory, and filename portions. On systems with no concept of volume,
         returns '' for volume.

             ($volume,$directories,$file) =
                                File::Spec-&gt;splitpath( $path );
             ($volume,$directories,$file) =
                                File::Spec-&gt;splitpath( $path, $no_file );

         For systems with no syntax differentiating filenames from directories, assumes that the last file is  a
         path  unless $no_file is true or a trailing separator or <u><a href="file:/.">/.</a></u> or <u><a href="file:/..">/..</a></u> is present. On Unix, this means that
         $no_file true makes this return ( '', $path, '' ).

         The directory portion may or may not be returned with a trailing '/'.

         The results can be passed to "<b>catpath()</b>" to get back a path equivalent to (usually  identical  to)  the
         original path.

       splitdir
         The opposite of "catdir".

             @dirs = File::Spec-&gt;splitdir( $directories );

         $directories  must  be  only  the  directory  portion of the path on systems that have the concept of a
         volume or that have path syntax that differentiates files from directories.

         Unlike just splitting the directories on the separator, empty directory names  ('')  can  be  returned,
         because these are significant on some OSes.

       <b>catpath()</b>
         Takes  volume,  directory and file portions and returns an entire path. Under Unix, $volume is ignored,
         and directory and file are concatenated.  A '/' is inserted if need be.   On  other  OSes,  $volume  is
         significant.

             $full_path = File::Spec-&gt;catpath( $volume, $directory, $file );

       abs2rel
         Takes  a  destination  path and an optional base path returns a relative path from the base path to the
         destination path:

             $rel_path = File::Spec-&gt;abs2rel( $path ) ;
             $rel_path = File::Spec-&gt;abs2rel( $path, $base ) ;

         If $base is not present or '', then <b>Cwd::cwd()</b> is used. If $base is relative, then it is  converted  to
         absolute form using "<b>rel2abs()</b>". This means that it is taken to be relative to <b>Cwd::cwd()</b>.

         On  systems  with  the  concept of volume, if $path and $base appear to be on two different volumes, we
         will not attempt to resolve the two paths, and we will instead simply return $path.  Note that previous
         versions of this module ignored the volume of $base, which resulted in  garbage  results  part  of  the
         time.

         On  systems  that  have  a  grammar  that indicates filenames, this ignores the $base filename as well.
         Otherwise all path components are assumed to be directories.

         If $path is relative, it is converted to absolute form using "<b>rel2abs()</b>".  This means that it is  taken
         to be relative to <b>Cwd::cwd()</b>.

         No  checks against the filesystem are made.  On VMS, there is interaction with the working environment,
         as logicals and macros are expanded.

         Based on code written by Shigio Yamaguchi.

       <b>rel2abs()</b>
         Converts a relative path to an absolute path.

             $abs_path = File::Spec-&gt;rel2abs( $path ) ;
             $abs_path = File::Spec-&gt;rel2abs( $path, $base ) ;

         If $base is not present or '', then <b>Cwd::cwd()</b> is used. If $base is relative, then it is  converted  to
         absolute form using "<b>rel2abs()</b>". This means that it is taken to be relative to <b>Cwd::cwd()</b>.

         On  systems  with  the  concept of volume, if $path and $base appear to be on two different volumes, we
         will not attempt to resolve the two paths, and we will instead simply return $path.  Note that previous
         versions of this module ignored the volume of $base, which resulted in  garbage  results  part  of  the
         time.

         On  systems  that  have  a  grammar  that indicates filenames, this ignores the $base filename as well.
         Otherwise all path components are assumed to be directories.

         If $path is absolute, it is cleaned up and returned using "canonpath".

         No checks against the filesystem are made.  On VMS, there is interaction with the working  environment,
         as logicals and macros are expanded.
