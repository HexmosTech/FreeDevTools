</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       File::Spec::Unix - File::Spec for Unix, base for other File::Spec modules

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        require File::Spec::Unix; # Done automatically by File::Spec

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Methods for manipulating file specifications.  Other File::Spec modules, such as File::Spec::Mac, inherit
       from File::Spec::Unix and override specific methods.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>canonpath()</b>
         No  physical  check  on  the filesystem, but a logical cleanup of a path. On UNIX eliminates successive
         slashes and successive "<a href="file:/.">/.</a>".

             $cpath = File::Spec-&gt;canonpath( $path ) ;

         Note that this does *not* collapse <u>x/../y</u> sections into <u>y</u>.  This is by design.  If <u>/foo</u> on your  system
         is  a  symlink  to  <u>/bar/baz</u>, then <u>/foo/../quux</u> is actually <u>/bar/quux</u>, not <u>/quux</u> as a naive <u>../</u>-removal
         would give you.  If you want to do this kind  of  processing,  you  probably  want  "Cwd"'s  realpath()
         function to actually traverse the filesystem cleaning up paths like this.

       <b>catdir()</b>
         Concatenate two or more directory names to form a complete path ending with a directory. But remove the
         trailing  slash  from  the resulting string, because it doesn't look good, isn't necessary and confuses
         OS2. Of course, if this is the root directory, don't cut off the trailing slash :-)

       catfile
         Concatenate one or more directory names and a filename to form a complete path ending with a filename

       curdir
         Returns a string representation of the current directory.  "." on UNIX.

       devnull
         Returns a string representation of the null device. "/dev/null" on UNIX.

       rootdir
         Returns a string representation of the root directory.  "/" on UNIX.

       tmpdir
         Returns a string representation of the first writable directory from the following list or the  current
         directory if none from the list are writable:

             $ENV{TMPDIR}
             <a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a>

         If running under taint mode, and if $ENV{TMPDIR} is tainted, it is not used.

       updir
         Returns a string representation of the parent directory.  ".." on UNIX.

       no_upwards
         Given a list of file names, strip out those that refer to a parent directory. (Does not strip symlinks,
         only '.', '..', and equivalents.)

       case_tolerant
         Returns  a  true or false value indicating, respectively, that alphabetic is not or is significant when
         comparing file specifications.

       file_name_is_absolute
         Takes as argument a path and returns true if it is an absolute path.

         This does not consult the local filesystem on Unix, Win32, OS/2 or Mac OS (Classic).  It  does  consult
         the working environment for VMS (see "file_name_is_absolute" in File::Spec::VMS).

       path
         Takes no argument, returns the environment variable PATH as an array.

       join
         join is the same as catfile.

       splitpath
             ($volume,$directories,$file) = File::Spec-&gt;splitpath( $path );
             ($volume,$directories,$file) = File::Spec-&gt;splitpath( $path,
                                                                   $no_file );

         Splits  a  path  into  volume,  directory, and filename portions. On systems with no concept of volume,
         returns '' for volume.

         For systems with no syntax differentiating filenames from directories, assumes that the last file is  a
         path  unless  $no_file is true or a trailing separator or <a href="file:/.">/.</a> or <a href="file:/..">/..</a> is present. On Unix this means that
         $no_file true makes this return ( '', $path, '' ).

         The directory portion may or may not be returned with a trailing '/'.

         The results can be passed to "<b>catpath()</b>" to get back a path equivalent to (usually  identical  to)  the
         original path.

       splitdir
         The opposite of "<b>catdir()</b>".

             @dirs = File::Spec-&gt;splitdir( $directories );

         $directories  must  be  only  the  directory  portion of the path on systems that have the concept of a
         volume or that have path syntax that differentiates files from directories.

         Unlike just splitting the directories on the separator, empty directory names  ('')  can  be  returned,
         because these are significant on some OSs.

         On Unix,

             File::Spec-&gt;splitdir( "/a/b//c/" );

         Yields:

             ( '', 'a', 'b', '', 'c', '' )

       <b>catpath()</b>
         Takes  volume,  directory and file portions and returns an entire path. Under Unix, $volume is ignored,
         and directory and file are concatenated.  A '/' is inserted if needed (though if the directory  portion
         doesn't start with '/' it is not added).  On other OSs, $volume is significant.

       abs2rel
         Takes  a  destination  path and an optional base path returns a relative path from the base path to the
         destination path:

             $rel_path = File::Spec-&gt;abs2rel( $path ) ;
             $rel_path = File::Spec-&gt;abs2rel( $path, $base ) ;

         If $base is not present or '', then <b>cwd()</b> is used. If $base  is  relative,  then  it  is  converted  to
         absolute form using "<b>rel2abs()</b>". This means that it is taken to be relative to <b>cwd()</b>.

         On systems that have a grammar that indicates filenames, this ignores the $base filename. Otherwise all
         path components are assumed to be directories.

         If  $path is relative, it is converted to absolute form using "<b>rel2abs()</b>".  This means that it is taken
         to be relative to <b>cwd()</b>.

         No checks against the filesystem are made, so the result may not be correct if $base contains  symbolic
         links.  (Apply <b>Cwd::abs_path()</b> beforehand if that is a concern.)  On VMS, there is interaction with the
         working environment, as logicals and macros are expanded.

         Based on code written by Shigio Yamaguchi.

       <b>rel2abs()</b>
         Converts a relative path to an absolute path.

             $abs_path = File::Spec-&gt;rel2abs( $path ) ;
             $abs_path = File::Spec-&gt;rel2abs( $path, $base ) ;

         If  $base  is  not  present  or  '',  then <b>cwd()</b> is used. If $base is relative, then it is converted to
         absolute form using "<b>rel2abs()</b>". This means that it is taken to be relative to <b>cwd()</b>.

         On systems that have a grammar that indicates filenames, this ignores the $base filename. Otherwise all
         path components are assumed to be directories.

         If $path is absolute, it is cleaned up and returned using "<b>canonpath()</b>".

         No checks against the filesystem are made.  On VMS, there is interaction with the working  environment,
         as logicals and macros are expanded.

         Based on code written by Shigio Yamaguchi.
