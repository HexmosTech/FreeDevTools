</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Sys::Virt - Represent and manage a libvirt hypervisor connection

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         my $conn = Sys::Virt-&gt;new(uri =&gt; $uri);

         my @domains = $conn-&gt;list_domains();

         foreach my $dom (@domains) {
           print "Domain ", $dom-&gt;get_id, " ", $dom-&gt;get_name, "\n";
         }

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The Sys::Virt module provides a Perl XS binding to the libvirt virtual machine management APIs. This
       allows machines running within arbitrary virtualization containers to be managed with a consistent API.

</pre><h4><b>CALLBACK</b> <b>HANDLING</b></h4><pre>
       Each callback registration routine returns a $callbackID (except for "domain_event_register" and
       "register_close_callback"). This return value must be retained and used for callback deregistration.

       <b>IMPORTANT:</b> All callbacks must be deregistered (including the ones registered using
       "domain_event_register" and "register_close_callback"); failing to do so prevents the "Sys::Virt" object
       from being garbage collected and the connection to "libvirtd" from being closed.

</pre><h4><b>ERROR</b> <b>HANDLING</b></h4><pre>
       Any operations in the Sys::Virt API which have failure scenarios will result in an instance of the
       Sys::Virt::Error module being thrown. To catch these errors, simply wrap the method in an eval block:

         eval { my $conn = Sys::Virt-&gt;new(uri =&gt; $uri); };
         if ($@) {
           print STDERR "Unable to open connection to $addr" . $@-&gt;message . "\n";
         }

       For details of the information contained in the error objects, consult the Sys::Virt::Error manual page.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       my $conn = Sys::Virt-&gt;new(uri =&gt; $uri, readonly =&gt; $ro, flags =&gt; $flags);
           Attach  to  the virtualization host identified by "uri". The "uri" parameter may be omitted, in which
           case the default connection made will be to the local Xen hypervisor. Some example URIs include:

           xen:///
               Xen on the local machine

           test:///default
               Dummy "in memory" driver for test suites

           qemu:///system
               System-wide driver for QEMU / KVM virtualization

           qemu:///session
               Per-user driver for QEMU virtualization

           qemu+tls://somehost/system
               System-wide QEMU driver on "somehost" using TLS security

           xen+tcp://somehost/
               Xen driver on "somehost" using TCP / SASL security

           For further details consult "<a href="http://libvirt.org/uri.html">http://libvirt.org/uri.html</a>"

           If the optional "readonly" parameter is supplied, then an unprivileged connection to  the  hypervisor
           will be attempted. If it is not supplied, then it defaults to making a fully privileged connection to
           the  hypervisor.  If  the  calling application is not running as root, it may be necessary to provide
           authentication callbacks.

           If the optional "auth" parameter is set to a non-zero value, authentication will  be  enabled  during
           connection, using the default set of credential gathering callbacks. The default callbacks prompt for
           credentials  on  the  console, so are not suitable for graphical applications. For such apps a custom
           implementation should be supplied. The "credlist" parameter should be an array reference listing  the
           set  of  credential types that will be supported. The credential constants in this module can be used
           as values in this list. The "callback" parameter should be a subroutine reference containing the code
           necessary to gather the credentials. When invoked it will be supplied with  a  single  parameter,  an
           array  reference  of  requested credentials. The elements of the array are hash references, with keys
           "type" giving the type of credential, "prompt" giving a user  descriptive  user  prompt,  "challenge"
           giving name of the credential required. The answer should be collected from the user, and returned by
           setting the "result" key. This key may already be set with a default result if applicable

           As a simple example returning hardcoded credentials

               my $uri  = "qemu+tcp://192.168.122.1/system";
               my $username = "test";
               my $password = "123456";

               my $con = Sys::Virt-&gt;new(uri =&gt; $uri,
                                        auth =&gt; 1,
                                        credlist =&gt; [
                                          Sys::Virt::CRED_AUTHNAME,
                                          Sys::Virt::CRED_PASSPHRASE,
                                        ],
                                        callback =&gt;
                    sub {
                          my $creds = shift;

                          foreach my $cred (@{$creds}) {
                             if ($cred-&gt;{type} == Sys::Virt::CRED_AUTHNAME) {
                                 $cred-&gt;{result} = $username;
                             }
                             if ($cred-&gt;{type} == Sys::Virt::CRED_PASSPHRASE) {
                                 $cred-&gt;{result} = $password;
                             }
                          }
                          return 0;
                    });

           For  backwards  compatibility with earlier releases, the "address" parameter is accepted as a synonym
           for the "uri" parameter. The use of "uri" is recommended for all newly written code.

       $conn-&gt;set_identity($identity, $flags=0)
           Change the identity that is used for access control over the connection. Normally the  remote  daemon
           will  use  the identity associated with the UNIX domain socket that the app opens.  Only a privileged
           client is usually able to override this.  The $identity should be a hash reference whose keys are one
           of the IDENTITY constants. The $flags parameter is currently unused, and defaults to 0 if omitted.

           list  are  instances  of  the  Sys::Virt::Domain  class.  This method requires O(n) RPC calls, so the
           "list_all_domains" method is recommended as a more efficient alternative.

       my $nids = $conn-&gt;<b>num_of_domains()</b>
           Return the number of running domains known to the hypervisor.  This  can  be  used  as  the  "maxids"

           Return  a  list  of  names  of all storage pools defined, but not currently running, on the host. The
           names can be used with the "get_storage_pool_by_name" method.

       my @pools = $conn-&gt;list_all_storage_pools($flags)
           Return a list of all storage pools currently known to the hypervisor, whether running or shutoff. The
           elements in the returned list are instances of the Sys::Virt::StoragePool class. The $flags parameter
           can be used to filter the list of returned pools.

       my @devs = $conn-&gt;list_node_devices($capability)
           Return a list of all devices currently known to the host OS. The elements in the  returned  list  are
           instances of the Sys::Virt::NodeDevice class.  The optional "capability" parameter allows the list to
           be restricted to only devices with a particular capability type. This method requires O(n) RPC calls,

       my $ndevs = $conn-&gt;num_of_node_devices($capability[, $flags])
           Return the number of host devices known to the hypervisor. This can be used as the "maxids" parameter
           to  "list_node_device_names".   The  "capability"  parameter allows the list to be restricted to only
           devices with a particular capability type, and should  be  left  as  "undef"  if  the  full  list  is
           required. The optional &lt;flags&gt; parameter is currently unused and defaults to 0 if omitted.

       my @devNames = $conn-&gt;list_node_device_names($capability, $maxnames[, $flags])

           inclusive.  The  @pagesizes  parameter should be an arrayref specifying which pages sizes information
           should be returned for. Information about supported page sizes is available in the capabilities  XML.
           The returned array has an element for each NUMA cell requested. The elements are hash references with
           two  keys,  'cell' specifies the NUMA cell number and 'pages' specifies the free page information for
           that cell. The 'pages' value is another hash reference where the keys are  the  page  sizes  and  the
           values are the free count for that size.

       $con-&gt;node_alloc_pages(\@pages, $start, $end, $flags=0)
           Allocate  further huge pages for the reserved dev. The "\@pages" parameter is an array reference with
           one entry per page size to allocate for. Each entry is a further  array  reference  where  the  first
           element  is  the page size and the second element is the page count. The same number of pages will be
           allocated on each NUMA node in the range $start to $end inclusive. The $flags parameter  accepts  two
           constants
