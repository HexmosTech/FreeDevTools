   <b>RFC-4510</b> <b>Lightweight</b> <b>Directory</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Protocol</b> <b>(LDAP):</b> <b>Technical</b> <b>Specification</b> <b>Road</b> <b>Map</b>
       <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4510.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4510.txt</a>

       The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is an Internet protocol for accessing distributed
       directory services that act in accordance with X.500 data and service models.  This document provides a
       road map of the LDAP Technical Specification.

   <b>RFC-4511</b> <b>Lightweight</b> <b>Directory</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Protocol</b> <b>(LDAP):</b> <b>The</b> <b>Protocol</b>
       <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4511.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4511.txt</a>

       This document describes the protocol elements, along with their semantics and encodings, of the
       Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP).  LDAP provides access to distributed directory services
       that act in accordance with X.500 data and service models.  These protocol elements are based on those
       described in the X.500 Directory Access Protocol (DAP).

   <b>RFC-4512</b> <b>Lightweight</b> <b>Directory</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Protocol</b> <b>(LDAP):</b> <b>Directory</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Models</b>
       <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4512.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4512.txt</a>

       The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is an Internet protocol for accessing distributed
       directory services that act in accordance with X.500 data and service models.  This document describes
       the X.500 Directory Information Models, as used in LDAP.

   <b>RFC-4513</b> <b>Lightweight</b> <b>Directory</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Protocol</b> <b>(LDAP):</b> <b>Authentication</b> <b>Methods</b> <b>and</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Mechanisms</b>
       <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4513.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4513.txt</a>

       This document describes authentication methods and security mechanisms of the Lightweight Directory
       Access Protocol (LDAP).  This document details establishment of Transport Layer Security (TLS) using the
       StartTLS operation.

       This document details the simple Bind authentication method including anonymous, unauthenticated, and
       name/password mechanisms and the Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) Bind authentication
       method including the EXTERNAL mechanism.

       This document discusses various authentication and authorization states through which a session to an
       LDAP server may pass and the actions that trigger these state changes.

   <b>RFC-4514</b> <b>Lightweight</b> <b>Directory</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Protocol</b> <b>(LDAP):</b> <b>String</b> <b>Representation</b> <b>of</b> <b>Distinguished</b> <b>Names</b>
       <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4514.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4514.txt</a>

       The X.500 Directory uses distinguished names (DNs) as primary keys to entries in the directory.  This
       document defines the string representation used in the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) to
       transfer distinguished names.  The string representation is designed to give a clean representation of
       commonly used distinguished names, while being able to represent any distinguished name.

   <b>RFC-4515</b> <b>Lightweight</b> <b>Directory</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Protocol</b> <b>(LDAP):</b> <b>String</b> <b>Representation</b> <b>of</b> <b>Search</b> <b>Filters</b>
       <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4515.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4515.txt</a>

       Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) search filters are transmitted in the LDAP protocol using a
       binary representation that is appropriate for use on the network.  This document defines a human-readable
       string representation of LDAP search filters that is appropriate for use in LDAP URLs (RFC 4516) and in
       other applications.

   <b>RFC-4516</b> <b>Lightweight</b> <b>Directory</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Protocol</b> <b>(LDAP):</b> <b>Uniform</b> <b>Resource</b> <b>Locator</b>
       <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4516.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4516.txt</a>

       This document describes a format for a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) Uniform Resource
       Locator (URL).  An LDAP URL describes an LDAP search operation that is used to retrieve information from
       an LDAP directory, or, in the context of an LDAP referral or reference, an LDAP URL describes a service
       where an LDAP operation may be progressed.

   <b>RFC-4517</b> <b>Lightweight</b> <b>Directory</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Protocol</b> <b>(LDAP):</b> <b>Syntaxes</b> <b>and</b> <b>Matching</b> <b>Rules</b>
       <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4517.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4517.txt</a>

       Each attribute stored in a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) directory, whose values may be
       transferred in the LDAP protocol, has a defined syntax that constrains the structure and format of its
       values.  The comparison semantics for values of a syntax are not part of the syntax definition but are
       instead provided through separately defined matching rules.  Matching rules specify an argument, an
       assertion value, which also has a defined syntax.  This document defines a base set of syntaxes and
       matching rules for use in defining attributes for LDAP directories.

   <b>RFC-4518</b> <b>Lightweight</b> <b>Directory</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Protocol</b> <b>(LDAP):</b> <b>Internationalized</b> <b>String</b> <b>Preparation</b>
       <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4518.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4518.txt</a>

       The previous Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) technical specifications did not precisely
       define how character string matching is to be performed.  This led to a number of usability and
       interoperability problems.  This document defines string preparation algorithms for character-based
       matching rules defined for use in LDAP.

   <b>RFC-4519</b> <b>Lightweight</b> <b>Directory</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Protocol</b> <b>(LDAP):</b> <b>Schema</b> <b>for</b> <b>User</b> <b>Applications</b>
       <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4519.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4519.txt</a>

       This document is an integral part of the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) technical
       specification.  It provides a technical specification of attribute types and object classes intended for
       use by LDAP directory clients for many directory services, such as White Pages.  These objects are widely
       used as a basis for the schema in many LDAP directories.  This document does not cover attributes used
       for the administration of directory servers, nor does it include directory objects defined for specific
       uses in other documents.

</pre><h4><b>Other</b> <b>LDAP</b> <b>Related</b> <b>RFCs</b> <b>-</b> <b>Proposed</b> <b>Standards</b></h4><pre>
   <b>RFC-6171</b> <b>The</b> <b>Lightweight</b> <b>Directory</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Protocol</b> <b>(LDAP)</b> <b>Don't</b> <b>Use</b> <b>Copy</b> <b>Control</b>
       <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc6171.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc6171.txt</a>

       This document defines the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) Don't Use Copy control extension
       which allows a client to specify that copied information should not be used in providing service.  This
       control is based upon the X.511 dontUseCopy service control option.

   <b>RFC-5020</b> <b>The</b> <b>Lightweight</b> <b>Directory</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Protocol</b> <b>(LDAP)</b> <b>entryDN</b> <b>Operational</b> <b>Attribute</b>
       <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5020.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5020.txt</a>

       This document describes the LDAP/X.500 'entryDN' operational attribute.  The attribute provides a copy of
       the entry's distinguished name for use in attribute value assertions.

   <b>RFC-4792</b> <b>Encoding</b> <b>Instructions</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Generic</b> <b>String</b> <b>Encoding</b> <b>Rules</b> <b>(GSER)</b>
       <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4792.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4792.txt</a>

       Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) defines a general framework for annotating types in an ASN.1
       specification with encoding instructions that alter how values of those types are encoded according to
       ASN.1 encoding rules.  This document defines the supporting notation for encoding instructions that apply
       to the Generic String Encoding Rules (GSER), and in particular defines an encoding instruction to provide
       a machine-processable representation for the declaration of a GSER ChoiceOfStrings type.

   <b>RFC-4532</b> <b>Lightweight</b> <b>Directory</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Protocol</b> <b>(LDAP)</b> <b>Who</b> <b>am</b> <b>I?</b> <b>Operation</b>
       <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4532.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4532.txt</a>

       This specification provides a mechanism for Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) clients to
       obtain the authorization identity the server has associated with the user or application entity.  This
       mechanism is specified as an LDAP extended operation called the LDAP "Who am I?" operation.

   <b>RFC-4530</b> <b>Lightweight</b> <b>Directory</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Protocol</b> <b>(LDAP)</b> <b>entryUUID</b> <b>Operational</b> <b>Attribute</b>
       <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4530.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4530.txt</a>

       This document describes the LDAP/X.500 'entryUUID' operational attribute and associated matching rules
       and syntax.  The attribute holds a server-assigned Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) for the object.
       Directory clients may use this attribute to distinguish objects identified by a distinguished name or to
       locate an object after renaming.

   <b>RFC-4528</b> <b>Lightweight</b> <b>Directory</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Protocol</b> <b>(LDAP)</b> <b>Assertion</b> <b>Control</b>
       <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4528.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4528.txt</a>

       This document defines the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) Assertion Control, which allows a
       client to specify that a directory operation should only be processed if an assertion applied to the
       target entry of the operation is true.  It can be used to construct "test and set", "test and clear", and
       other conditional operations.

   <b>RFC-4527</b> <b>Lightweight</b> <b>Directory</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Protocol</b> <b>(LDAP)</b> <b>Read</b> <b>Entry</b> <b>Controls</b>
       <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4527.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4527.txt</a>

       This document specifies an extension to the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) to allow the
       client to read the target entry of an update operation.  The client may request to read the entry before
       and/or after the modifications are applied.  These reads are done as an atomic part of the update
       operation.

   <b>RFC-4526</b> <b>Lightweight</b> <b>Directory</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Protocol</b> <b>(LDAP)</b> <b>Absolute</b> <b>True</b> <b>and</b> <b>False</b> <b>Filters</b>
       <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4526.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4526.txt</a>

       This document extends the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) to support absolute True and False
       filters based upon similar capabilities found in X.500 directory systems.  The document also extends the
       String Representation of LDAP Search Filters to support these filters.

   <b>RFC-4524</b> <b>COSINE</b> <b>LDAP/X.500</b> <b>Schema</b>
       <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4524.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4524.txt</a>

       This document provides a collection of schema elements for use with the Lightweight Directory Access
       Protocol (LDAP) from the COSINE and Internet X.500 pilot projects.

   <b>RFC-4523</b> <b>Lightweight</b> <b>Directory</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Protocol</b> <b>(LDAP)</b> <b>Schema</b> <b>Definitions</b> <b>for</b> <b>X.509</b> <b>Certificates</b>
       <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4523.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4523.txt</a>

       This document describes schema for representing X.509 certificates, X.521 security information, and
       related elements in directories accessible using the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP).  The
       LDAP definitions for these X.509 and X.521 schema elements replace those provided in RFCs 2252 and 2256.

   <b>RFC-4522</b> <b>Lightweight</b> <b>Directory</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Protocol</b> <b>(LDAP):</b> <b>The</b> <b>Binary</b> <b>Encoding</b> <b>Option</b>
       <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4522.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4522.txt</a>

       Each attribute stored in a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) directory has a defined syntax
       (i.e., data type).  A syntax definition specifies how attribute values conforming to the syntax are
       normally represented when transferred in LDAP operations.  This representation is referred to as the
       LDAP-specific encoding to distinguish it from other methods of encoding attribute values.  This document
       defines an attribute option, the binary option, that can be used to specify that the associated attribute
       values are instead encoded according to the Basic Encoding Rules (BER) used by X.500 directories.

   <b>RFC-4370</b> <b>Lightweight</b> <b>Directory</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Protocol</b> <b>(LDAP)</b> <b>Proxied</b> <b>Authorization</b> <b>Control</b>
       <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4370.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4370.txt</a>

       This document defines the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) Proxy Authorization Control.  The
       Proxy Authorization Control allows a client to request that an operation be processed under a provided
       authorization identity instead of under the current authorization identity associated with the
       connection.

   <b>RFC-4104</b> <b>Policy</b> <b>Core</b> <b>Extension</b> <b>Lightweight</b> <b>Directory</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Protocol</b> <b>Schema</b> <b>(PCELS)</b>
       <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4104.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4104.txt</a>

       This document defines a number of changes and extensions to the Policy Core Lightweight Directory Access
       Protocol (LDAP) Schema (RFC 3703) based on the model extensions defined by the Policy Core Information
       Model (PCIM) Extensions (RFC 3460).  These changes and extensions consist of new LDAP object classes and
       attribute types.  Some of the schema items defined in this document re-implement existing concepts in
       accordance with their new semantics introduced by RFC 3460.  The other schema items implement new
       concepts, not covered by RFC 3703.  This document updates RFC 3703.

   <b>RFC-3928</b> <b>Lightweight</b> <b>Directory</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Protocol</b> <b>(LDAP)</b> <b>Client</b> <b>Update</b> <b>Protocol</b> <b>(LCUP)</b>
       <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3928.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3928.txt</a>

       This document defines the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) Client Update Protocol (LCUP).
       The protocol is intended to allow an LDAP client to synchronize with the content of a directory
       information tree (DIT) stored by an LDAP server and to be notified about the changes to that content.

   <b>RFC-3909</b> <b>Lightweight</b> <b>Directory</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Protocol</b> <b>(LDAP)</b> <b>Cancel</b> <b>Operation</b>
       <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3909.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3909.txt</a>

       This specification describes a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) extended operation to cancel
       (or abandon) an outstanding operation.  Unlike the LDAP Abandon operation, but like the X.511 Directory
       Access Protocol (DAP) Abandon operation, this operation has a response which provides an indication of
       its outcome.

   <b>RFC-3876</b> <b>Returning</b> <b>Matched</b> <b>Values</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lightweight</b> <b>Directory</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Protocol</b> <b>version</b> <b>3</b> <b>(LDAPv3)</b>
       <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3876.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3876.txt</a>

       This document describes a control for the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol version 3 that is used to
       return a subset of attribute values from an entry.  Specifically, only those values that match a "values
       return" filter.  Without support for this control, a client must retrieve all of an attribute's values
       and search for specific values locally.

   <b>RFC-3866</b> <b>Language</b> <b>Tags</b> <b>and</b> <b>Ranges</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lightweight</b> <b>Directory</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Protocol</b> <b>(LDAP)</b>
       <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3866.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3866.txt</a>

       It is often desirable to be able to indicate the natural language associated with values held in a
       directory and to be able to query the directory for values which fulfill the user's language needs.  This
       document details the use of Language Tags and Ranges in the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP).

   <b>RFC-3727</b> <b>ASN.1</b> <b>Module</b> <b>Definition</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>LDAP</b> <b>and</b> <b>X.500</b> <b>Component</b> <b>Matching</b> <b>Rules</b>
       <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3727.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3727.txt</a>

       This document updates the specification of the component matching rules for Lightweight Directory Access
       Protocol (LDAP) and X.500 directories (RFC3687) by collecting the Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)
       definitions of the component matching rules into an appropriately identified ASN.1 module so that other
       specifications may reference the component matching rule definitions from within their own ASN.1 modules.

   <b>RFC-3703</b> <b>Policy</b> <b>Core</b> <b>Lightweight</b> <b>Directory</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Protocol</b> <b>(LDAP)</b> <b>Schema</b>
       <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3703.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3703.txt</a>

       This document defines a mapping of the Policy Core Information Model to a form that can be implemented in
       a directory that uses Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) as its access protocol.  This model
       defines two hierarchies of object classes: structural classes representing information for representing
       and controlling policy data as specified in RFC 3060, and relationship classes that indicate how
       instances of the structural classes are related to each other.  Classes are also added to the LDAP schema
       to improve the performance of a client's interactions with an LDAP server when the client is retrieving
       large amounts of policy-related information.  These classes exist only to optimize LDAP retrievals: there
       are no classes in the information model that correspond to them.

   <b>RFC-3698</b> <b>Lightweight</b> <b>Directory</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Protocol</b> <b>(LDAP):</b> <b>Additional</b> <b>Matching</b> <b>Rules</b>
       <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3698.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3698.txt</a>

       This document provides a collection of matching rules for use with the Lightweight Directory Access
       Protocol (LDAP).  As these matching rules are simple adaptations of matching rules specified for use with
       the X.500 Directory, most are already in wide use.

   <b>RFC-3687</b> <b>Lightweight</b> <b>Directory</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Protocol</b> <b>(LDAP)</b> <b>and</b> <b>X.500</b> <b>Component</b> <b>Matching</b> <b>Rules</b>
       <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3687.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3687.txt</a>

       The syntaxes of attributes in a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) or X.500 directory range
       from simple data types, such as text string, integer, or Boolean, to complex structured data types, such
       as the syntaxes of the directory schema operational attributes.  Matching rules defined for the complex
       syntaxes usually only provide the most immediately useful matching capability.  This document defines
       generic matching rules that can match any user selected component parts in an attribute value of any
       arbitrarily complex attribute syntax.

   <b>RFC-3672</b> <b>Subentries</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lightweight</b> <b>Directory</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Protocol</b> <b>(LDAP)</b>
       <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3672.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3672.txt</a>

       In X.500 directories, subentries are special entries used to hold information associated with a subtree
       or subtree refinement.  This document adapts X.500 subentries mechanisms for use with the Lightweight
       Directory Access Protocol (LDAP).

   <b>RFC-3671</b> <b>Collective</b> <b>Attributes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lightweight</b> <b>Directory</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Protocol</b> <b>(LDAP)</b>
       <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3671.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3671.txt</a>

       X.500 collective attributes allow common characteristics to be shared between collections of entries.
       This document summarizes the X.500 information model for collective attributes and describes use of
       collective attributes in LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol).  This document provides schema
       definitions for collective attributes for use in LDAP.

   <b>RFC-3296</b> <b>Named</b> <b>Subordinate</b> <b>References</b> <b>in</b> <b>Lightweight</b> <b>Directory</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Protocol</b> <b>(LDAP)</b> <b>Directories</b>
       <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3296.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3296.txt</a>

       This document details schema and protocol elements for representing and managing named subordinate
       references in Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) Directories.

   <b>RFC-3062</b> <b>LDAP</b> <b>Password</b> <b>Modify</b> <b>Extended</b> <b>Operation</b>
       <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3062.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3062.txt</a>

       The integration of the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) and external authentication services
       has introduced non-DN authentication identities and allowed for non-directory storage of passwords.  As
       such, mechanisms which update the directory (e.g., Modify) cannot be used to change a user's password.
       This document describes an LDAP extended operation to allow modification of user passwords which is not
       dependent upon the form of the authentication identity nor the password storage mechanism used.

   <b>RFC-2891</b> <b>LDAP</b> <b>Control</b> <b>Extension</b> <b>for</b> <b>Server</b> <b>Side</b> <b>Sorting</b> <b>of</b> <b>Search</b> <b>Results</b>
       <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2891.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2891.txt</a>

       This document describes two LDAPv3 control extensions for server side sorting of search results. These
       controls allows a client to specify the attribute types and matching rules a server should use when
       returning the results to an LDAP search request. The controls may be useful when the LDAP client has
       limited functionality or for some other reason cannot sort the results but still needs them sorted. Other
       permissible controls on search operations are not defined in this extension.

   <b>RFC-2849</b> <b>The</b> <b>LDAP</b> <b>Data</b> <b>Interchange</b> <b>Format</b> <b>(LDIF)</b> <b>-</b> <b>Technical</b> <b>Specification</b>
       <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2849.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2849.txt</a>

       This document describes a file format suitable for describing directory information or modifications made
       to directory information. The file format, known as LDIF, for LDAP Data Interchange Format, is typically
       used to import and export directory information between LDAP-based directory servers, or to describe a
       set of changes which are to be applied to a directory.

   <b>RFC-2831</b> <b>Using</b> <b>Digest</b> <b>Authentication</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>SASL</b> <b>Mechanism</b>
       <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2831.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2831.txt</a>

       This specification defines how HTTP Digest Authentication can be used as a SASL [RFC 2222] mechanism for
       any protocol that has a SASL profile. It is intended both as an improvement over CRAM-MD5 [RFC 2195] and
       as a convenient way to support a single authentication mechanism for web, mail, LDAP, and other
       protocols.

   <b>RFC-2739</b> <b>Calendar</b> <b>Attributes</b> <b>for</b> <b>vCard</b> <b>and</b> <b>LDAP</b>
       <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2739.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2739.txt</a>

       When scheduling a calendar entity, such as an event, it is a prerequisite that an organizer has the
       calendar address of each attendee that will be invited to the event. Additionally, access to an
       attendee's current "busy time" provides an a priori indication of whether the attendee will be free to
       participate in the event. In order to meet these challenges, a calendar user agent (CUA) needs a
       mechanism to locate individual user's calendar and free/busy time. This memo defines three mechanisms for
       obtaining a URI to a user's calendar and free/busy time. These include:

   <b>RFC-2589</b> <b>Extensions</b> <b>for</b> <b>Dynamic</b> <b>Directory</b> <b>Services</b>
       <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2589.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2589.txt</a>

       LDAP supports lightweight access to static directory services, allowing relatively fast search and update
       access. Static directory services store information about people that persists in its accuracy and value
       over a long period of time. Dynamic directory services are different in that they store information about
       people that only persists in its accuracy and value while people are online. Though the protocol
       operations and attributes used by dynamic directory services are similar to the ones used for static
       directory services, clients that are bound to a dynamic directory service need to periodically refresh
       their presence at the server to keep directory entries from getting stale in the presence of client
       application crashes. A flow control mechanism from the server is also described that allows a server to
       inform clients how often they should refresh their presence.

       <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2559.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2559.txt</a>

       The protocol described in this document is designed to satisfy some of the operational requirements
       within the Internet X.509 PKI. Specifically, this document addresses requirements to provide access to
       PKI repositories for the purposes of retrieving PKI information and managing that same information.  The
       mechanism described in this document is based on the LDAPv2, defined in RFC 1777, defining a profile of
       that protocol for use within the PKIX and updates encodings for certificates and revocation lists from
       RFC 1778. Additional mechanisms addressing PKIX operational requirements are specified in separate
       documents.

       <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2247.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2247.txt</a>

       LDAP uses X.500-compatible distinguished names for providing unique identification of entries. This
       document defines an algorithm by which a name registered with the Internet Domain Name Service can be
       represented as an LDAP distinguished name.

       <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2222.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2222.txt</a>

       This document describes a method for adding authentication support to connection-based protocols. To use
       this specification, a protocol includes a command for identifying and authenticating a user to a server
       and for optionally negotiating protection of subsequent protocol interactions. If its use is negotiated,
       a security layer is inserted between the protocol and the connection. This document describes how a
       protocol specifies such a command, defines several mechanisms for use by the command, and defines the
       protocol used for carrying a negotiated security layer over the connection.

   <b>RFC-2218</b> <b>A</b> <b>Common</b> <b>Schema</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> <b>White</b> <b>Pages</b> <b>Service</b>
       <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2218.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2218.txt</a>

       This IETF Integrated Directory Services(IDS) Working Group proposes a standard specification for a simple
       Internet White Pages service by defining a common schema for use by the various White Pages servers. This
       schema is independent of specific implementations of the White Pages service. This document specifies the
       minimum set of core attributes of a White Pages entry for an individual and describes how new objects
       with those attributes can be defined and published. It does not describe how to represent other objects
       in the White Pages service. Further, it does not address the search sort expectations within a particular
       service.

       MIXER (RFC 2156) defines an algorithm for use of a set of global mapping between X.400 and RFC 822
       addresses. This specification defines how to represent and maintain these mappings (MIXER Conformant
       Global Address Mappings of MCGAMs) in an X.500 or LDAP directory. Mechanisms for representing OR Address
       and Domain hierarchies within the DIT. These techniques are used to define two independent subtrees in
       the DIT, which contain the mapping information.

       <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2079.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2079.txt</a>

       URLs are being widely used to specify the location of Internet resources. There is an urgent need to be
       able to include URLs in directories that conform to the LDAP and X.500 information models, and a desire
       to include other types of URIs as they are defined. A number of independent groups are already
       experimenting with the inclusion of URLs in LDAP and X.500 directories. This document builds on the
       experimentation to date and defines a new attribute type and an auxiliary object class to allow URIs,
       including URLs, to be stored in directory entries in a standard way.

       The Internet is used for information exchange and communication between its users. It can only be
       effective as such if users are able to find each other's addresses. Therefore the Internet benefits from
       an adequate White Pages Service, i.e., a directory service offering (Internet) address information
       related to people and organizations.

       This document describes the way in which the Internet White Pages Service (from now on abbreviated as
       IWPS) is best exploited using today's experience, today's protocols, today's products and today's

       This document consists of two primary components, a schema for agents that make use of the Lightweight
       Directory Access protocol (LDAP) and a proposed use case of that schema, for distributed configuration of
       similar directory user agents.  A set of attribute types and an object class are proposed.  In the
       proposed use case, directory user agents (DUAs) can use this schema to determine directory data location
       and access parameters for specific services they support.  In addition, in the proposed use case,
       attribute and object class mapping allows DUAs to reconfigure their expected (default) schema to match
       that of the end user's environment.  This document is intended to be a skeleton for future documents that
       describe configuration of specific DUA services.

       The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) Bulk Update/Replication Protocol (LBURP) allows an LDAP
       client to perform a bulk update to an LDAP server.  The protocol frames a sequenced set of update
       operations within a pair of LDAP extended operations to notify the server that the update operations in
       the framed set are related in such a way that the ordering of all operations can be preserved during
       processing even when they are sent asynchronously by the client.  Update operations can be grouped within
       a single protocol message to maximize the efficiency of client-server communication.

       The protocol is suitable for efficiently making a substantial set of updates to the entries in an LDAP
       server.

       The International Telecommunications Union Standardization Sector (ITU-T) has created the H.350 series of
       Recommendations that specify directory services architectures in support of multimedia conferencing
       protocols.  The goal of the architecture is to 'directory enable' multimedia conferencing so that these
       services can leverage existing identity management and enterprise directories.  A particular goal is to
       enable an enterprise or service provider to maintain a canonical source of users and their multimedia
       conferencing systems, so that multiple call servers from multiple vendors, supporting multiple protocols,
       can all access the same data store.

       Because SIP is an IETF standard, the contents of H.350 and H.350.4 are made available via this document
       to the IETF community.  This document contains the entire normative text of ITU-T Recommendations H.350

   <b>RFC-2926</b> <b>Conversion</b> <b>of</b> <b>LDAP</b> <b>Schemas</b> <b>to</b> <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>SLP</b> <b>Templates</b>
       <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2926.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2926.txt</a>

       This document describes a procedure for mapping between Service Location Protocol (SLP) service
       advertisements and lightweight directory access protocol (LDAP) descriptions of services.  The document
       covers two aspects of the mapping.  One aspect is mapping between SLP service type templates and LDAP
       directory schema.  Because the SLP service type template grammar is relatively simple, mapping from
       service type templates to LDAP types is straightforward.  Mapping in the other direction is
       straightforward if the attributes are restricted to use just a few of the syntaxes defined in RFC 2252.
       If arbitrary ASN.1 types occur in the schema, then the mapping is more complex and may even be
       impossible.  The second aspect is representation of service information in an LDAP directory.  The
       recommended representation simplifies interoperability with SLP by allowing SLP directory agents to
       backend into LDAP directory servers.  The resulting system allows service advertisements to propagate
       easily between SLP and LDAP.

       This document describes an LDAPv3 control extension for simple paging of search results. This control
       extension allows a client to control the rate at which an LDAP server returns the results of an LDAP
       search operation. This control may be useful when the LDAP client has limited resources and may not be
       able to process the entire result set from a given LDAP query, or when the LDAP client is connected over
       a low-bandwidth connection. Other operations on the result set are not defined in this extension. This
       extension is not designed to provide more sophisticated result set management.

       Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) update operations, such as Add, Delete, and Modify
       operations, have atomic, consistency, isolation, durability (ACID) properties.  Each of these update
       operations act upon an entry.  It is often desirable to update two or more entries in a single unit of

       resource provisioning.  This document extends LDAP to support transactions.

   <b>RFC-4533</b> <b>The</b> <b>Lightweight</b> <b>Directory</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Protocol</b> <b>(LDAP)</b> <b>Content</b> <b>Synchronization</b> <b>Operation</b>
       <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4533.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4533.txt</a>

       This specification describes the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) Content Synchronization
       Operation.  The operation allows a client to maintain a copy of a fragment of the Directory Information
       Tree (DIT).  It supports both polling for changes and listening for changes.  The operation is defined as
       an extension of the LDAP Search Operation.

   <b>RFC-4531</b> <b>Lightweight</b> <b>Directory</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Protocol</b> <b>(LDAP)</b> <b>Turn</b> <b>Operation</b>
       <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4531.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4531.txt</a>

       This specification describes a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) extended operation to reverse
       (or "turn") the roles of client and server for subsequent protocol exchanges in the session, or to enable
       each peer to act as both client and server with respect to the other.

   <b>RFC-3663</b> <b>Domain</b> <b>Administrative</b> <b>Data</b> <b>in</b> <b>Lightweight</b> <b>Directory</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Protocol</b> <b>(LDAP)</b>
       <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3663.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3663.txt</a>

       Domain registration data has typically been exposed to the general public via Nicname/Whois for
       administrative purposes.  This document describes the Referral Lightweight Directory Access Protocol
       (LDAP) Service, an experimental service using LDAP and well-known LDAP types to make domain
       administrative data available.

   <b>RFC-3088</b> <b>OpenLDAP</b> <b>Root</b> <b>Service</b> <b>-</b> <b>An</b> <b>experimental</b> <b>LDAP</b> <b>referral</b> <b>service</b>
       <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3088.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3088.txt</a>

       The OpenLDAP Project is operating an experimental LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) referral
       service known as the "OpenLDAP Root Service".  The automated system generates referrals based upon
       service location information published in DNS SRV RRs (Domain Name System location of services resource
       records).  This document describes this service.

   <b>RFC-2657</b> <b>LDAPv2</b> <b>Client</b> <b>vs.</b> <b>the</b> <b>Index</b> <b>Mesh</b>
       <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2657.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2657.txt</a>

       LDAPv2 clients as implemented according to RFC 1777 have no notion of referral. The integration between
       such a client and an Index Mesh, as defined by the Common Indexing Protocol, heavily depends on referrals
       and therefore needs to be handled in a special way. This document defines one possible way of doing this.

       <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2649.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2649.txt</a>

       This document defines an LDAPv3 based mechanism for signing directory operations in order to create a
       secure journal of changes that have been made to each directory entry. Both client and server based
       signatures are supported. An object class for subsequent retrieval are 'journal entries' is also defined.
       This document specifies LDAPv3 controls that enable this functionality. It also defines an LDAPv3 schema
       that allows for subsequent browsing of the journal information.

   <b>RFC-2307</b> <b>An</b> <b>Approach</b> <b>for</b> <b>Using</b> <b>LDAP</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>Network</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Service</b>
       <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2307.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2307.txt</a>

       This document describes an experimental mechanism for mapping entities related to TCP/IP and the UNIX
       system into X.500 entries so that they may be resolved with the LDAP. A set of attribute types and object
       classes are proposed, along with specific guidelines for interpreting them. The intention is to assist
       the deployment of LDAP as an organizational nameservice.  No proposed solutions are intended as standards
       for the Internet. Rather, it is hoped that a general consensus will emerge as to the appropriate solution
       to such problems, leading eventually to the adoption of standards. The proposed mechanism has already
       been implemented with some success.

   <b>draft-wahl-ldap-adminaddr</b> <b>--</b> <b>Administrator</b> <b>Address</b> <b>Attribute</b>
       Organizations running multiple directory servers need an ability for administrators to determine who is
       responsible for a particular server. This is conceptually similar to the 'sysContact' object of SNMP. The
       administratorsAddress attribute allows a server administrator to provide the contact information of the
       responsible party for an LDAP server. This can be used by management clients which are, for example,
       checking the state of a replication or referral topology, to provide a way for the user of the management
       client to send email to manager of a particular server.

   <b>draft-zeilenga-ldap-noop</b> <b>--</b> <b>The</b> <b>LDAP</b> <b>No-Op</b> <b>Control</b>
       This document defines the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) No-Op control which can be used to
       disable the normal effect of an operation.  The control can be used to discover how a server might react
       to a particular update request without updating the directory.

   <b>draft-legg-ldap-transfer</b> <b>--</b> <b>Lightweight</b> <b>Directory</b> <b>Access</b> <b>Protocol</b> <b>(LDAP):</b> <b>Transfer</b> <b>Encoding</b> <b>Options</b>
       Each attribute stored in a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) directory has a defined syntax
       (i.e., data type).  A syntax definition specifies how attribute values conforming to the syntax are
       normally represented when transferred in LDAP operations.  This representation is referred to as the
       LDAP-specific encoding to distinguish it from other methods of encoding attribute values.  This document
       introduces a new category of attribute options, called transfer encoding options, that can be used to
       specify that the associated attribute values are encoded according to one of these other methods.

   <b>draft-furuseth-ldap-untypedobject</b> <b>--</b> <b>Structural</b> <b>object</b> <b>class</b> <b>'namedObject'</b> <b>for</b> <b>LDAP/X.500</b>
       This document defines an 'namedObject' structural object class for the Lightweight Directory Access
       Protocol (LDAP) and X.500.  This is useful for entries with no natural choice of structural object class,
       e.g. if an entry must exist even though its contents are uninteresting.

   <b>draft-wahl-ldap-p3p</b> <b>--</b> <b>P3P</b> <b>Policy</b> <b>Attributes</b> <b>for</b> <b>LDAP</b>
       This document defines attributes that can be retrieved via Lightweight Directory Access Protocol version
       3 (LDAP) requests, which contain URIs pointing to the privacy policy documents.  These documents describe
       the privacy policy concerning access to a directory server, and the privacy policies that apply to the
       contents of the directory (a subtree of entries).

   <b>draft-chu-ldap-xordered</b> <b>--</b> <b>Ordered</b> <b>Entries</b> <b>and</b> <b>Values</b> <b>in</b> <b>LDAP</b>
       As LDAP is used more extensively for managing various kinds of data, one often encounters a need to
       preserve both the ordering and the content of data, despite the inherently unordered structure of entries
       and attribute values in the directory.  This document describes a scheme to attach ordering information
       to attributes in a directory so that the ordering may be preserved and propagated to other LDAP
       applications.

   <b>draft-chu-ldap-logschema</b> <b>--</b> <b>A</b> <b>Schema</b> <b>for</b> <b>Logging</b> <b>the</b> <b>LDAP</b> <b>Protocol</b>
       In order to facilitate remote administration and auditing of LDAP server operation, it is desirable to
       provide the server's operational logs themselves as a searchable LDAP directory.  These logs may also be
       used as a persistent change log to support various replication mechanisms.  This document defines a
       schema that may be used to represent all of the requests that have been processed by an LDAP server.  It
       may be used by various applications for auditing, flight recorder, replication, and other purposes.

   <b>draft-zeilenga-ldap-relax</b> <b>--</b> <b>The</b> <b>LDAP</b> <b>Relax</b> <b>Rules</b> <b>Control</b>
       This document defines the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) Relax Rules Control which allows a
       directory user agent (a client) to request the directory service temporarily relax enforcement of various
       data and service model rules.

   <b>draft-gpaterno-dhcp-ldap</b> <b>--</b> <b>DHCP</b> <b>Option</b> <b>for</b> <b>LDAP</b> <b>Directory</b> <b>Services</b> <b>discovery</b>
       This document defines a new DHCP option for delivering configuration information for LDAP services.
       Through this option, the client receives an LDAP URL [8] of the closest available LDAP server/replica
       that can be used to authenticate users or look up any useful data.

   <b>draft-schleiff-ldap-xri</b> <b>--</b> <b>LDAP</b> <b>Schema</b> <b>for</b> <b>eXtensible</b> <b>Resource</b> <b>Identifier</b> <b>(XRI)</b>
       This document describes Attribute Types and an Object Class for use in representing XRI (eXtensible
       Resource Identifier) values in LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) and X.500 directory services.

   <b>draft-wahl-ldap-session</b> <b>--</b> <b>LDAP</b> <b>Session</b> <b>Tracking</b> <b>Control</b>
       Many network devices, application servers, and middleware components of a enterprise software
       infrastructure generate some form of session tracking identifiers, which are useful when analyzing
       activity and accounting logs to group activity relating to a particular session.  This document discusses
       how Lightweight Directory Access Protocol version 3 (LDAP) clients can include session tracking
       identifiers with their LDAP requests.  This information is provided through controls in the requests the
       clients send to LDAP servers.  The LDAP server receiving these controls can include the session tracking
       identifiers the log messages it writes, enabling LDAP requests in the LDAP server's logs to be correlated
       with activity in logs of other components in the infrastructure.  The control also enables session
       tracking information to be generated by LDAP servers and returned to clients and other servers.  Three
       formats of session tracking identifiers are defined in this document.

   <b>draft-wahl-ldap-subtree-source</b> <b>--</b> <b>LDAP</b> <b>Subtree</b> <b>Data</b> <b>Source</b> <b>URI</b> <b>Attribute</b>
       This document defines an attribute that enables administrative clients using the Lightweight Directory
       Access Protocol (LDAP) to determine the source of directory entries.

   <b>draft-ietf-ldapext-psearch</b> <b>--</b> <b>Persistent</b> <b>Search:</b> <b>A</b> <b>Simple</b> <b>LDAP</b> <b>Change</b> <b>Notification</b> <b>Mechanism</b>
       This document defines two controls that extend the LDAPv3 search operation to provide a simple mechanism
       by which an LDAP client can receive notification of changes that occur in an LDAP server. The mechanism
       is designed to be very flexible yet easy for clients and servers to implement.

   <b>draft-ietf-ldapext-ldapv3-vlv</b> <b>--</b> <b>LDAP</b> <b>Extensions</b> <b>for</b> <b>Scrolling</b> <b>View</b> <b>Browsing</b> <b>of</b> <b>Search</b> <b>Results</b>
       This document describes a Virtual List View control  extension  for  the LDAP  Search  operation.  This
       control is designed to allow the "virtual list box" feature, common in existing  commercial  e-mail
       address  book applications, to be supported efficiently by LDAP servers. LDAP servers' inability to
       support this client feature is a significant impediment  to LDAP replacing proprietary protocols in
       commercial e-mail systems.

       The control allows a client to specify that the  server  return,  for  a given  LDAP search with
       associated sort keys, a contiguous subset of the search result set. This subset is specified in terms of
       offsets into the ordered list, or in terms of a greater than or equal comparison value.
