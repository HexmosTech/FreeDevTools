</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Cyrus::IMAP::IMSP - Perl module for Cyrus IMSP user options

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Cyrus::IMAP::IMSP;

         my $client = Cyrus::IMAP::IMSP-&gt;new('imsphost'[, $port[, $flags]]);
         $rc = $client-&gt;set('mailreader.window.size', '200x300');
         %options = $client-&gt;get('mailreader.*')
         $rc = $client-&gt;unset('mailreader.window.size');

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module is a Perl interface to the Cyrus IMSP functions that relate to user options (preferences).
       Only three IMSP operations are implemented: set, unset, and get.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       new($server[, $port[, $flags]])
           Instantiates  a <b>Cyrus::IMAP::IMSP</b> object.  This is in fact a Cyrus::IMAP object with a few additional
           methods, so all Cyrus::IMAP methods are available if needed.  (In particular, you will always want to
           use the "authenticate" method.)

       error
           Return the last error that occurred, or undef if the last operation was successful.  This is in  some
           cases (such as "get") the only way to distinguish between a successful return of an empty list and an
           error return.

           Calling "error" does not reset the error state, so it is legal to write:

               %options = $client-&gt;get($option);
               print STDERR "Error: ", $client-&gt;error if $client-&gt;error;

       set($option, $value)
           Sets the option named by $option to the value in $value.

           There  are  no  restrictions  or  quoting  rules  needed  to  protect special characters in the value
           argument. (The Cyrus::IMAP layer will take care those details by adding double quotes  or  a  literal
           introducer.)

           If  successful,  returns 1. Otherwise, returns undef and makes an error message available through the
           "error" function.

       unset($option)
           Removes the option named by $option. The option is completely removed from the user's name space  but
           will revert to a site-wide default if one has been set. Note that this is different from assigning an
           option the null value with set($option, '').

           If  you  try  to unset an option that does not exist, an error is returned saying that the option was
           already unset.

           If successful, returns 1. Otherwise, returns undef and makes an error message available  through  the
           "error" function.

       get($option_pattern)
           Get takes either an option name or a pattern of names to fetch. The pattern can contain either "*" or
           "%" wildcards anywhere in the string. The usual IMAP wildcard semantics apply.

           The  return  value  is  a hash of options with each key being an option name and each value being the
           option's value string. If an empty hash is returned, it's  either  because  there  were  no  matching
           options or because some error happened. Check the "error" function to see which was the case.

           The IMSP protocol also returns an access flag of "[READ-WRITE]" or "[READ-ONLY]" but that information
           is discarded by this function. A more complicated function that returns both the value and the access
           flag could be added later if needed.
