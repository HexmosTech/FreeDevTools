</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Perl debug information is frequently required not just by debuggers, but also by modules that need some
       "special" information to do their job properly, like profilers.

       This module abstracts and provides all of the hooks into Perl internal debugging functionality, so that
       various implementations of Perl debuggers (or packages that want to simply get at the "privileged"
       debugging data) can all benefit from the development of this common code.  Currently used by Swat, the
       perl/Tk GUI debugger.

       Note that multiple "front-ends" can latch into this debugging API simultaneously.  This is intended to
       facilitate things like debugging with a command line and GUI at the same time, debugging debuggers etc.
       [Sounds nice, but this needs some serious support -- GSAR]

       In particular, this API does <b>not</b> provide the following functions:

       •   data display

       •   command processing

       •   command alias management

       •   user interface (tty or graphical)

       These are intended to be services performed by the clients of this API.

       This module attempts to be squeaky clean w.r.t "use strict;" and when warnings are enabled.

   <b>Global</b> <b>Variables</b>
       The  following  "public"  global  names  can be read by clients of this API.  Beware that these should be
       considered "readonly".

       $DB::sub
               Name of current executing subroutine.

       %DB::sub
               The keys of this hash are the names of all the known  subroutines.   Each  value  is  an  encoded
               string that has the <b><a href="../man3/sprintf.3.html">sprintf</a></b>(3) format "("%s:%d-%d", filename, fromline, toline)".

       $DB::single
               Single-step flag.  Will be true if the API will stop at the next statement.

       $DB::signal
               Signal flag. Will be set to a true value if a signal was caught.  Clients may check for this flag
               to abort time-consuming operations.

       $DB::trace
               This flag is set to true if the API is tracing through subroutine calls.

       @DB::args
               Contains the arguments of current subroutine, or the @ARGV array if in the toplevel context.

       @DB::dbline
               List of lines in currently loaded file.

       %DB::dbline
               Actions in current file (keys are line numbers).  The values are strings that have the <b><a href="../man3/sprintf.3.html">sprintf</a></b>(3)
               format "("%s\000%s", breakcondition, actioncode)".

       $DB::package
               Package namespace of currently executing code.

       $DB::filename
               Currently loaded filename.

       $DB::subname
               Fully qualified name of currently executing subroutine.

       $DB::lineno
               Line number that will be executed next.

   <b>API</b> <b>Methods</b>
       The following are methods in the DB base class.  A client must access these methods by inheritance (*not*
       by calling them directly), since the API keeps track of clients through the inheritance mechanism.

       CLIENT-&gt;<b>register()</b>
               register a client object/package

       CLIENT-&gt;evalcode(STRING)
               eval STRING in executing code context

       CLIENT-&gt;skippkg('D::hide')
               ask DB not to stop in these packages

       CLIENT-&gt;<b>run()</b>
               run some more (until a breakpt is reached)

       CLIENT-&gt;<b>step()</b>
               single step

       CLIENT-&gt;<b>next()</b>
               step over

       CLIENT-&gt;<b>done()</b>
               de-register from the debugging API

   <b>Client</b> <b>Callback</b> <b>Methods</b>
       The  following  "virtual"  methods  can  be  defined  by  the  client.  They will be called by the API at
       appropriate points.  Note that unless specified  otherwise,  the  debug  API  only  defines  empty,  non-
       functional default versions of these methods.

       CLIENT-&gt;<b>init()</b>
               Called after debug API inits itself.

       CLIENT-&gt;prestop([STRING])
               Usually  inherited  from  DB  package.   If  no  arguments are passed, returns the prestop action
               string.

       CLIENT-&gt;<b>stop()</b>
               Called when execution stops (w/ args file, line).

       CLIENT-&gt;<b>idle()</b>
               Called while stopped (can be a client event loop).

       CLIENT-&gt;poststop([STRING])
               Usually inherited from DB package.  If no arguments  are  passed,  returns  the  poststop  action
               string.

       CLIENT-&gt;evalcode(STRING)
               Usually inherited from DB package.  Ask for a STRING to be "eval"-ed in executing code context.

       CLIENT-&gt;<b>cleanup()</b>
               Called just before exit.

       CLIENT-&gt;output(LIST)
               Called when API must show a message (warnings, errors etc.).

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       The  interface  defined  by  this  module  is  missing  some  of  the later additions to perl's debugging
       functionality.  As such, this interface should be considered highly experimental and subject to change.
