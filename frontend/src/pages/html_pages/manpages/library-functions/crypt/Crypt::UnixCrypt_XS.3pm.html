       Crypt::UnixCrypt_XS - perl xs interface for a portable traditional crypt function.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Crypt::UnixCrypt_XS qw/crypt/;
         my $hashed = crypt( $password, $salt );

         use Crypt::UnixCrypt_XS qw/crypt_rounds fold_password
             base64_to_block block_to_base64
             base64_to_int24 int24_to_base64
             base64_to_int12 int12_to_base64/;
         $block = crypt_rounds( $password, $nrounds, $saltnum, $block );
         $password = fold_password( $password );
         $block = base64_to_block( $base64 );
         $base64 = block_to_base64( $block );
         $saltnum = base64_to_int24( $base64 );
         $base64 = int24_to_base64( $saltnum );
         $saltnum = base64_to_int12( $base64 );
         $base64 = int12_to_base64( $saltnum );

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module implements the DES-based Unix <u>crypt</u> function.  For those who need to construct non-standard
       variants of <u>crypt</u>, the various building blocks used in <u>crypt</u> are also supplied separately.

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       crypt( PASSWORD, SALT )
           This  is the conventional <u>crypt</u> interface.  <u>PASSWORD</u> and <u>SALT</u> are both strings.  The password will be
           hashed, in a manner determined by the salt, and a string is returned containing the  salt  and  hash.
           The  salt  is  at  the beginning of the returned string, and only the beginning of the salt string is
           examined, so it is acceptable to use a string returned by <u>crypt</u> as a salt argument.  Three  different
           types of hashing may occur:

           If  the  salt  is an empty string, then the password is ignored and an empty string is returned.  The
           empty salt/hash string is thus used to not require a password.

           If the salt string starts with two base 64 digits (from the set [./0-9A-Za-z]), then the password  is
           hashed  using  the  traditional DES-based algorithm.  The salt is used to modify the DES algorithm in
           one of 4096 different ways.  The first eight characters of the password are used as  a  DES  key,  to
           encrypt  a  block of zeroes through 25 iterations of the modified DES.  The block output by the final
           iteration is the hash, and it is returned in base 64 (as eleven digits).

           If the salt string starts with an underscore character  and  then  eight  base  64  digits  then  the
           password  is  hashed using the extended DES-based algorithm from BSDi.  The first four base 64 digits
           specify how many encryption rounds are to be performed.  The next four base 64  digits  are  used  to
           modify  the  DES  algorithm  in one of 16777216 different ways.  If the password is longer than eight
           characters, it is hashed down to eight characters before being used as a key, so  all  characters  of
           the password are significant.

       crypt_rounds( PASSWORD, NROUNDS, SALTNUM, BLOCK )
           This is the core of the DES-based <u>crypt</u> algorithm, exposed here to allow variant hash functions to be
           built.   <u>PASSWORD</u>  is  a  string;  its  first  eight characters are used as a DES key.  <u>SALTNUM</u> is an
           integer; its low 24 bits are used to modify the DES algorithm.  <u>BLOCK</u> must be a string exactly  eight
           bytes  long.   The data block is passed through <u>NROUNDS</u> iterations of the modified DES, and the final
           output block (also a string of exactly eight bytes) is returned.

       fold_password( PASSWORD )
           This is the pre-hashing algorithm used in the extended DES algorithm to fold a long password  to  the
           size  of  a  DES  key.  It takes a password of any length, and returns a password of eight characters
           which is completely equivalent in the extended  DES  algorithm.   Note:  the  password  returned  may
           contain  NUL characters.  The functions in this module correctly handle NULs in password strings, but
           a normal C library <u>crypt</u> cannot.  If you need the short password to  contain  no  NULs,  perform  the
           substitution  "s/\0/\x80/g":  the  top  bit  of  each password character is ignored, so the result is
           equivalent.

       base64_to_block( BASE64 )
           This converts a data block from a string of eleven base 64 digits to a raw string of eight bytes.

       block_to_base64( BLOCK )
           This converts a data block from a raw string of eight bytes to a string of eleven base 64 digits.

       base64_to_int24( BASE64 )
           This converts a 24-bit integer from a string of four base 64 digits to a Perl integer.

       int24_to_base64( VALUE )
           This converts a 24-bit integer from a Perl integer to a string of four base 64 digits.

       base64_to_int12( BASE64 )
           This converts a 12-bit integer from a string of two base 64 digits to a Perl integer.

       int12_to_base64( VALUE )
           This converts a 12-bit integer from a Perl integer to a string of two base 64 digits.

   <b>EXPORT</b>
       None by default.

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       Crypt::UnixCrypt_XS provide a fast portable crypt function. Perl's internal crypt is not present at every
       system. Perl calls the <u>crypt</u> function of the system's C library. This may lead to trouble if the system's
       crypt presents different results for the same key and salt, but different  processid's.  Crypt::UnixCrypt
       is  the  cure  here, but it is to slow. On my computer Crypt::UnixCrypt_XS is about 800 times faster than
       Crypt::UnixCrypt.
