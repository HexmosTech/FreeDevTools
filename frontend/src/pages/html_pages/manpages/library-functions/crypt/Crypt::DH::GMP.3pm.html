</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Crypt::DH::GMP - Crypt::DH Using GMP Directly

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Crypt::DH::GMP;

         my $dh = Crypt::DH::GMP-&gt;new(p =&gt; $p, g =&gt; $g);
         my $val = $dh-&gt;compute_secret();

         # If you want compatibility with Crypt::DH (it uses Math::BigInt)
         # then use this flag
         # You /think/ you're using Crypt::DH, but...
         use Crypt::DH::GMP qw(-compat);

         my $dh = Crypt::DH-&gt;new(p =&gt; $p, g =&gt; $g);
         my $val = $dh-&gt;compute_secret();

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Crypt::DH::GMP is a (somewhat) portable replacement to Crypt::DH, implemented mostly in C.

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       In the beginning, there was "Crypt::DH". However, "Crypt::DH" suffers from a couple of problems:

       GMP/Pari libraries are almost always required
           "Crypt::DH"  works  with  a plain "Math::BigInt", but if you want to use it in production, you almost
           always need  to  install  "Math::BigInt::GMP"  or  "Math::BigInt::Pari"  because  without  them,  the
           computation that is required by "Crypt::DH" makes the module pretty much unusable.

           Because of this, "Crypt::DH" might as well make "Math::BigInt::GMP" a hard requirement.

       Crypt::DH suffers from having Math::BigInt in between GMP
           With  or  without  "Math::BigInt::GMP"  or "Math::BigInt::Pari", "Crypt::DH" makes several round trip
           conversions between Perl scalars, Math::BigInt objects, and finally its C representation (if GMP/Pari
           are installed).

           Instantiating an object comes with a relatively high cost, and if you make many computations  in  one
           go, your program will suffer dramatically because of this.

       These  problems  quickly  become  apparent  when  you  use modules such as "Net::OpenID::Consumer", which
       requires to make a few calls to "Crypt::DH".

       "Crypt::DH::GMP" attempts to alleviate these problems by providing a "Crypt::DH"-compatible layer, which,
       instead of doing calculations via Math::BigInt, directly works with libgmp in C.

       This means that we've essentially eliminated 2 call stacks worth of expensive Perl method  calls  and  we
       also only load 1 (Crypt::DH::GMP) module instead of 3 (Crypt::DH + Math::BigInt + Math::BigInt::GMP).

       These add up to a fairly significant increase in performance.

</pre><h4><b>COMPATIBILITY</b> <b>WITH</b> <b>Crypt::DH</b></h4><pre>
       Crypt::DH::GMP  absolutely refuses to consider using anything other than strings as its parameters and/or
       return values therefore if you would like to use Math::BigInt objects as your return values, you can  not
       use Crypt::DH::GMP directly. Instead, you need to be explicit about it:

         use Crypt::DH;
         use Crypt::DH::GMP qw(-compat); # must be loaded AFTER Crypt::DH

       Specifying -compat invokes a very nasty hack that overwrites Crypt::DH's symbol table -- this then forces
       Crypt::DH users to use Crypt::DH::GMP instead, even if you are writing

         my $dh = Crypt::DH-&gt;new(...);
         $dh-&gt;compute_key();

</pre><h4><b>BENCHMARK</b></h4><pre>
       By  NO  MEANS  is this an exhaustive benchmark, but here's what I get on my MacBook (OS X 10.5.8, 2.4 GHz
       Core 2 Duo, 4GB RAM)
