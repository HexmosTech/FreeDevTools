</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Crypt::UnixCrypt - perl-only implementation of the "crypt" function.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Crypt::UnixCrypt;
         $hashed = crypt($plaintext,$salt);

         # always use this module's crypt
         BEGIN { $Crypt::UnixCrpyt::OVERRIDE_BUILTIN = 1 }
         use Crypt::UnixCrypt;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module is for all those poor souls whose perl port answers to the use of "crypt()" with the message
       `The <b>crypt()</b> function is unimplemented due to excessive paranoia.'.

       This module won't overload a built-in "crypt()" unless forced by a true value of the variable
       $Crypt::UnixCrypt::OVERRIDE_BUILTIN.

       If you use this module, you probably neither have a built-in "crypt()" function nor a <b><a href="../man3/crypt.3.html">crypt</a></b>(3) manpage;
       so I'll supply the appropriate portions of its description (from my Linux system) here:

       crypt is the password encryption function. It is based on the Data Encryption Standard algorithm with
       variations intended (among other things) to discourage use of hardware implementations of a key search.

       $plaintext is a user's typed password.

       $salt is a two-character string chosen from the set [a-zA-Z0-9./]. This string is used to perturb the
       algorithm in one of 4096 different ways.

       By taking the lowest 7 bit of each character of $plaintext (filling it up to 8 characters with zeros, if
       needed), a 56-bit key is obtained. This 56-bit key is used to encrypt repeatedly a constant string
       (usually a string consisting of all zeros). The returned value points to the encrypted password, a series
       of 13 printable ASCII characters (the first two characters represent the salt itself).

       Warning: The key space consists of 2**56 equal 7.2e16 possible values.  Exhaustive searches of this key
       space are possible using massively parallel computers. Software, such as <b><a href="../man1/crack.1.html">crack</a></b>(1), is available which
       will search the portion of this key space that is generally used by humans for passwords. Hence, password
       selection should, at minimum, avoid common words and names. The use of a <b><a href="../man1/passwd.1.html">passwd</a></b>(1) program that checks
       for crackable passwords during the selection process is recommended.

       The DES algorithm itself has a few quirks which make the use of the <b><a href="../man3/crypt.3.html">crypt</a></b>(3) interface a very poor choice
       for anything other than password authentication. If you are planning on using the <b><a href="../man3/crypt.3.html">crypt</a></b>(3) interface for
       a cryptography project, don't do it: get a good book on encryption and one of the widely available DES
       libraries.

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
       In extreme situations, this function doesn't behave like <a href="../man3/crypt.3.html">crypt</a>(3), e.g. when called with a salt not in
       [A-Za-z0-9./]{2}.
