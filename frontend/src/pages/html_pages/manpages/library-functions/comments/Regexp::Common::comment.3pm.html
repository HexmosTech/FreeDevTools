           while (&lt;&gt;) {
               /$RE{comment}{C}/       and  print "Contains a C comment\n";

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Please consult the manual of Regexp::Common for a general description of the works of this interface.

       Do not use this module directly, but load it via <u>Regexp::Common</u>.

       This modules gives you regular expressions for comments in various languages.

   <b>THE</b> <b>LANGUAGES</b>
       Below, the comments of each of the languages are described.  The patterns are available as
       "$RE{comment}{<u>LANG</u>}", foreach language <u>LANG</u>. Some languages have variants; it's described at the
       individual languages how to get the patterns for the variants.  Unless mentioned otherwise, "{-keep}"
       sets $1, $2, $3 and $4 to the entire comment, the opening marker, the content of the comment, and the
       closing marker (for many languages, the latter is a newline) respectively.

       ABC Comments  in  <u>ABC</u>  start  with  a  backslash  ("\"),  and  last  till  the  end  of  the  line.   See

       Haskell
           There are two types of comments in <u>Haskell</u>. They either start with at least two dashes, or are nested
           comments,  delimited  with "{-" and "-}".  Under "{-keep}", only $1 will be set, returning the entire
           comment.  This pattern requires <u>perl</u> <u>5.6.0</u> or newer.

       HTML
           In <u>HTML</u>, comments only appear inside a <u>comment</u> <u>declaration</u>.  A  comment  declaration  starts  with  a
           "&lt;!",  and  ends with a "&gt;". Inside this declaration, we have zero or more comments.  Comments starts
           with  "--"  and  end  with  "--",  and  are  optionally   followed   by   whitespace.   The   pattern
           "$RE{comment}{HTML}"  recognizes  those  comment  declarations (and hence more than a comment).  Note
           that this is not the same as something that starts with "&lt;!--"  and  ends  with  "--&gt;",  because  the
           following will be matched completely:

               &lt;!--  First  Comment   --
                 --&gt; Second Comment &lt;!--
                 --  Third  Comment   --&gt;

           Do not be fooled by what your favourite browser thinks is an HTML comment.

           If "{-keep}" is used, the following are returned:

           $1  captures the entire comment declaration.

           $2  captures the MDO (markup declaration open), "&lt;!".

           $3  captures the content between the MDO and the MDC.

           $4  captures the (last) comment, without the surrounding dashes.

           $5  captures the MDC (markup declaration close), "&gt;".

       Hugo
           There  are  two  types of comments in <u>Hugo</u>. They either start with "!" (which cannot be followed by a
           "\"), or are nested comments, delimited with "!\" and "\!".  Under "{-keep}", only $1  will  be  set,
           returning the entire comment.  This pattern requires <u>perl</u> <u>5.6.0</u> or newer.

       Icon
           <u>Icon</u>    has   comments   that   start   with   "#"   and   end   at   the   next   new   line.    See

       ILLGOL
           The  esotoric  language  <u>ILLGOL</u>  uses comments starting with <u>NB</u> and lasting till the end of the line.

           precedes "DO". Keywords are separated by whitespace.

       J   The  language  <u>J</u>  uses  comments  that  start with "NB.", and that last till the end of the line. See
           &lt;<a href="http://www.jsoftware.com/books/help/primer/contents.htm">http://www.jsoftware.com/books/help/primer/contents.htm</a>&gt;, and &lt;<a href="http://www.jsoftware.com/">http://www.jsoftware.com/</a>&gt;.

           set, and set to the entire comment.

       JavaDoc
           The  <u>Javadoc</u>  documentation syntax is demarked with a subset of ordinary Java comments to separate it
           from code.  Comments start with "/**" end with "*/".  If "{-keep}" is used, only $1 will be set,  and
           set                to               the               entire               comment.               See

       M, MUMPS
           In "M" (aka "MUMPS"), comments start with a semi-colon, and last till the end of a line. The language
           specification requires the semi-colon to be preceded by one  or  more  <u>linestart</u>  <u>character</u>s.   Those
           characters  default  to  a space, but that's configurable. This requirement, of preceding the comment
           with        linestart        characters        is         <b>not</b>         tested         for.         See

       m4  By default, the preprocessor language <u>m4</u> uses single  line  comments,  that  start  with  a  "#"  and
           continue to the end of the line, including the newline. The pattern "$RE {comment} {m4}" matches such
           comments.     In    <u>m4</u>,    it   is   possible   to   change   the   starting   token   though.    See

       Pascal
           There  are  many  implementations  of  Pascal.  This modules provides pattern for comments of several
           implementations.

           "$RE{comment}{Pascal}"
               This is the pattern that recognizes comments according to the Pascal ISO standard. This  standard
               says  that  comments  start  with  either "{", or "(*", and end with "}" or "*)". This means that
               "{*)" and "(*}" are considered to be comments. Many Pascal applications don't  allow  this.   See
               &lt;<a href="http://www.pascal-central.com/docs/iso10206.txt">http://www.pascal-central.com/docs/iso10206.txt</a>&gt;

           "$RE{comment}{Pascal}{Alice}"
               The <u>Alice</u> <u>Pascal</u> compiler accepts comments that start with "{" and end with "}". Comments are not
               allowed to contain newlines.  See &lt;<a href="http://www.templetons.com/brad/alice/language/">http://www.templetons.com/brad/alice/language/</a>&gt;.

           "$RE{comment}{Pascal}{Delphi}", "$RE{comment}{Pascal}{Free}" and "$RE{comment}{Pascal}{GPC}"
               The  <u>Delphi</u>  <u>Pascal</u>,  <u>Free</u>  <u>Pascal</u> and the <u>Gnu</u> <u>Pascal</u> <u>Compiler</u> implementations of Pascal all have
               comments that either start with "//" and last till the end of the line, are  delimited  with  "{"
               and  "}"  or  are  delimited  with  "(*"  and  "*)".  Patterns  for  those  comments are given by
               "$RE{comment}{Pascal}{Delphi}",  "$RE{comment}{Pascal}{Free}"   and   "$RE{comment}{Pascal}{GPC}"
               respectively.  These  patterns  only  set  $1 when "{-keep}" is used, which will then include the
               entire comment.

               See                                             &lt;<a href="http://info.borland.com/techpubs/delphi5/oplg/">http://info.borland.com/techpubs/delphi5/oplg/</a>&gt;,

               comment.
