</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       MDOM::Token::Comment - A comment in Makefile source code

</pre><h4><b>INHERITANCE</b></h4><pre>
         MDOM::Token::Comment
         isa MDOM::Token
             isa MDOM::Element

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         # This is a MDOM::Token::Comment

         foo: bar # So is this one
               echo 'hello'

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       In MDOM, comments are represented by "MDOM::Token::Comment" objects.

       These come in two flavours, line comment and inline comments.

       A "line comment" is a comment that stands on its own line. These comments hold their own newline and
       whitespace (both leading and trailing) as part of the one "MDOM::Token::Comment" object.

       An inline comment is a comment that appears after some code, and continues to the end of the line. This
       does <b>not</b> include whitespace, and the terminating newlines is considered a separate
       MDOM::Token::Whitespace token.

       This is largely a convenience, simplifying a lot of normal code relating to the common things people do
       with comments.

       Most commonly, it means when you "prune" or "delete" a comment, a line comment disappears taking the
       entire line with it, and an inline comment is removed from the inside of the line, allowing the newline
       to drop back onto the end of the code, as you would expect.

       It also means you can move comments around in blocks much more easily.

       For now, this is a suitably handy way to do things. However, I do reserve the right to change my mind on
       this one if it gets dangerously anachronistic somewhere down the line.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       Only very limited methods are available, beyond those provided by our parent MDOM::Token and
       MDOM::Element classes.

   <b>line</b>
       The "line" accessor returns true if the "MDOM::Token::Comment" is a line comment, or false if it is an
       inline comment.
