</pre><h4><b>WIDGET-SPECIFIC</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Command-Line Name:<b>-activestyle</b>
       Database Name:  <b>activeStyle</b>
       Database Class: <b>ActiveStyle</b>

              Specifies the style in which to draw the active element.  This must be one of <b>dotbox</b> (show a focus
              ring  around  the  active  element),  <b>none</b>  (no special indication of active element) or <b>underline</b>
              (underline the active element).  The default is <b>underline</b> on Windows, and <b>dotbox</b> elsewhere.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-height</b>
       Database Name:  <b>height</b>
       Database Class: <b>Height</b>

              Specifies the desired height for the window, in lines.  If zero or less, then the  desired  height
              for the window is made just large enough to hold all the elements in the listbox.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-listvariable</b>
       Database Name:  <b>listVariable</b>
       Database Class: <b>Variable</b>

              Specifies  the  name  of  a  global variable.  The value of the variable is a list to be displayed
              inside the widget; if the variable value changes then the widget will automatically update  itself
              to  reflect  the  new  value.   Attempts  to  assign  a  variable  with  an  invalid list value to
              <b>-listvariable</b> will cause an error.  Attempts to unset a variable in use as  a  <b>-listvariable</b>  will
              fail but will not generate an error.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-selectmode</b>
       Database Name:  <b>selectMode</b>
       Database Class: <b>SelectMode</b>

              Specifies  one  of  several styles for manipulating the selection.  The value of the option may be
              arbitrary, but the default bindings expect it to be either <b>single</b>, <b>browse</b>, <b>multiple</b>, or  <b>extended</b>;
              the default value is <b>browse</b>.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-state</b>
       Database Name:  <b>state</b>
       Database Class: <b>State</b>

              Specifies one of two states for the listbox:  <b>normal</b> or <b>disabled</b>.  If the listbox is disabled then
              items  may  not  be  inserted  or  deleted,  items are drawn in the <b>-disabledforeground</b> color, and
              selection cannot be modified and is not shown (though selection information is retained).

       Command-Line Name:<b>-width</b>
       Database Name:  <b>width</b>
       Database Class: <b>Width</b>

              Specifies the desired width for the window in characters.  If the font does  not  have  a  uniform
              width  then  the  width of the character “0” is used in translating from character units to screen
              units.  If zero or less, then the desired width for the window is made just large enough  to  hold
              all the elements in the listbox.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>listbox</b>  command  creates  a new window (given by the <u>pathName</u> argument) and makes it into a listbox
       widget.  Additional options, described above, may be specified on the  command  line  or  in  the  option
       database  to  configure  aspects  of the listbox such as its colors, font, text, and relief.  The <b>listbox</b>
       command returns its <u>pathName</u> argument.  At the time this command is  invoked,  there  must  not  exist  a
       window named <u>pathName</u>, but <u>pathName</u>'s parent must exist.

       A  listbox  is a widget that displays a list of strings, one per line.  When first created, a new listbox
       has no elements.  Elements may be added or deleted using widget commands described below.   In  addition,
       one  or  more  elements may be selected as described below.  If a listbox is exporting its selection (see
       <b>-exportselection</b> option), then it will observe the standard X11 protocols  for  handling  the  selection.
       Listbox  selections  are  available  as  type  <b>STRING</b>; the value of the selection will be the text of the
       selected elements, with newlines separating the elements.

       It is not necessary for all the elements to be  displayed  in  the  listbox  window  at  once;   commands
       described  below  may  be  used  to  change  the  view  in the window.  Listboxes allow scrolling in both
       directions using the standard <b>-xscrollcommand</b> and <b>-yscrollcommand</b> options.  They also  support  scanning,
       as described below.

</pre><h4><b>INDICES</b></h4><pre>
       Many  of  the  widget commands for listboxes take one or more indices as arguments.  An index specifies a
       particular element of the listbox, in any of the following ways:

       <u>number</u>      Specifies the element as a numerical index, where 0 corresponds to the first element  in  the
                   listbox.

       <b>active</b>      Indicates  the  element  that  has  the  location  cursor.  This element will be displayed as
                   specified by <b>-activestyle</b> when the listbox has the keyboard focus, and it is  specified  with
                   the <b>activate</b> widget command.

       <b>anchor</b>      Indicates  the  anchor point for the selection, which is set with the <b>selection</b> <b>anchor</b> widget
                   command.

       <b>end</b>         Indicates the end of the listbox.  For most commands this refers to the last element  in  the
                   listbox,  but for a few commands such as <b>index</b> and <b>insert</b> it refers to the element just after
                   the last one.

       <b>@</b><u>x</u><b>,</b><u>y</u>        Indicates the element that covers the point in the listbox window specified by <u>x</u>  and  <u>y</u>  (in
                   pixel  coordinates).  If no element covers that point, then the closest element to that point
                   is used.

       Indexes support the same simple interpretation as for the command <b>string</b> <b>index</b>, with simple integer index
       arithmetic and indexing relative to <b>end</b>.  In the  widget  command  descriptions  below,  arguments  named
       <u>index</u>, <u>first</u>, and <u>last</u> always contain text indices in one of the above forms.

</pre><h4><b>WIDGET</b> <b>COMMAND</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>listbox</b> command creates a new Tcl command whose name is <u>pathName</u>.  This command may be used to invoke
       various operations on the widget.  It has the following general form:
              <u>pathName</u> <u>option</u> ?<u>arg</u> <u>...</u>?
       <u>Option</u> and the <u>arg</u>s determine the exact behavior of the command.  The following commands are possible for
       listbox widgets:

       <u>pathName</u> <b>activate</b> <u>index</u>
              Sets  the active element to the one indicated by <u>index</u>.  If <u>index</u> is outside the range of elements
              in the listbox then the closest element is activated.  The active element is drawn as specified by
              <b>-activestyle</b> when the widget has the input focus, and its index may be retrieved  with  the  index
              <b>active</b>.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>bbox</b> <u>index</u>
              Returns  a  list  of  four numbers describing the bounding box of the text in the element given by
              <u>index</u>.  The first two elements of the list give the x and y coordinates of the  upper-left  corner
              of  the  screen area covered by the text (specified in pixels relative to the widget) and the last
              two elements give the width and height of the area, in pixels.  If no part of the element given by
              <u>index</u> is visible on the screen, or if <u>index</u> refers to a non-existent element, then the  result  is
              an  empty  string;   if  the  element  is partially visible, the result gives the full area of the
              element, including any parts that are not visible.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>cget</b> <u>option</u>
              Returns the current value of the configuration option given by <u>option</u>.  <u>Option</u> may have any of the
              values accepted by the <b>listbox</b> command.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>configure</b> ?<u>option</u>? ?<u>value</u> <u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>...</u>?
              Query or modify the configuration options of the widget.  If no <u>option</u>  is  specified,  returns  a
              list describing all of the available options for <u>pathName</u> (see <b>Tk_ConfigureInfo</b> for information on
              the  format  of this list).  If <u>option</u> is specified with no <u>value</u>, then the command returns a list
              describing the one named option (this list will be identical to the corresponding sublist  of  the
              value  returned if no <u>option</u> is specified).  If one or more <u>option-value</u> pairs are specified, then
              the command modifies the given widget option(s) to have the given  value(s);   in  this  case  the
              command  returns  an  empty  string.   <u>Option</u>  may  have any of the values accepted by the <b>listbox</b>
              command.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>curselection</b>
              Returns a list containing the numerical indices of all of the elements in  the  listbox  that  are
              currently  selected.   If  there  are  no elements selected in the listbox then an empty string is
              returned.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>delete</b> <u>first</u> ?<u>last</u>?
              Deletes one or more elements of the listbox.  <u>First</u> and <u>last</u> are indices specifying the first  and
              last  elements  in  the  range  to  delete.  If <u>last</u> is not specified it defaults to <u>first</u>, i.e. a
              single element is deleted.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>get</b> <u>first</u> ?<u>last</u>?
              If <u>last</u> is omitted, returns the contents of the listbox element indicated by <u>first</u>,  or  an  empty
              string  if  <u>first</u>  refers  to a non-existent element.  If <u>last</u> is specified, the command returns a
              list whose elements are all of the listbox elements between <u>first</u> and <u>last</u>, inclusive.  Both <u>first</u>
              and <u>last</u> may have any of the standard forms for indices.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>index</b> <u>index</u>
              Returns the integer index value that corresponds to <u>index</u>.  If <u>index</u> is <b>end</b> the return value is  a
              count of the number of elements in the listbox (not the index of the last element).

       <u>pathName</u> <b>insert</b> <u>index</u> ?<u>element</u> <u>element</u> <u>...</u>?
              Inserts zero or more new elements in the list just before the element given by <u>index</u>.  If <u>index</u> is
              specified as <b>end</b> then the new elements are added to the end of the list.  Returns an empty string.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>itemcget</b> <u>index</u> <u>option</u>
              Returns the current value of the item configuration option given by <u>option</u>. <u>Option</u> may have any of
              the values accepted by the <b>itemconfigure</b> command.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>itemconfigure</b> <u>index</u> ?<u>option</u>? ?<u>value</u>? ?<u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>...</u>?
              Query  or  modify the configuration options of an item in the listbox.  If no <u>option</u> is specified,
              returns a list describing all of the available options for  the  item  (see  <b>Tk_ConfigureInfo</b>  for
              information  on  the format of this list).  If <u>option</u> is specified with no <u>value</u>, then the command
              returns a list describing the one named option (this list will be identical to  the  corresponding
              sublist  of  the value returned if no <u>option</u> is specified).  If one or more <u>option-value</u> pairs are
              specified, then the command modifies the given widget option(s) to have the  given  value(s);   in
              this  case  the command returns an empty string. The following options are currently supported for
              items:

              <b>-background</b> <u>color</u>
                     <u>Color</u> specifies the background color to use when displaying the item. It may  have  any  of
                     the forms accepted by <b>Tk_GetColor</b>.

              <b>-foreground</b> <u>color</u>
                     <u>Color</u>  specifies  the  foreground color to use when displaying the item. It may have any of
                     the forms accepted by <b>Tk_GetColor</b>.

              <b>-selectbackground</b> <u>color</u>
                     <u>color</u> specifies the background color to use when displaying the item while it is  selected.
                     It may have any of the forms accepted by <b>Tk_GetColor</b>.

              <b>-selectforeground</b> <u>color</u>
                     <u>color</u>  specifies the foreground color to use when displaying the item while it is selected.
                     It may have any of the forms accepted by <b>Tk_GetColor</b>.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>nearest</b> <u>y</u>
              Given a y-coordinate within the listbox window, this command returns the index  of  the  (visible)
              listbox element nearest to that y-coordinate.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>scan</b> <u>option</u> <u>args</u>
              This command is used to implement scanning on listboxes.  It has two forms, depending on <u>option</u>:

              <u>pathName</u> <b>scan</b> <b>mark</b> <u>x</u> <u>y</u>
                     Records <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> and the current view in the listbox window;  used in conjunction with later
                     <b>scan</b>  <b>dragto</b>  commands.   Typically this command is associated with a mouse button press in
                     the widget.  It returns an empty string.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>scan</b> <b>dragto</b> <u>x</u> <u>y</u>.
                     This command computes the difference between its  <u>x</u>  and  <u>y</u>  arguments  and  the  <u>x</u>  and  <u>y</u>
                     arguments  to  the  last  <b>scan</b> <b>mark</b> command for the widget.  It then adjusts the view by 10
                     times the difference in coordinates.  This  command  is  typically  associated  with  mouse
                     motion  events  in  the  widget,  to  produce the effect of dragging the list at high speed
                     through the window.  The return value is an empty string.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>see</b> <u>index</u>
              Adjust the view in the listbox so that the element given by <u>index</u> is visible.  If the  element  is
              already visible then the command has no effect; if the element is near one edge of the window then
              the  listbox scrolls to bring the element into view at the edge;  otherwise the listbox scrolls to
              center the element.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>selection</b> <u>option</u> <u>arg</u>
              This command is used to adjust the selection within a listbox.  It has several forms, depending on
              <u>option</u>:

              <u>pathName</u> <b>selection</b> <b>anchor</b> <u>index</u>
                     Sets the selection anchor to the element given by <u>index</u>.  If <u>index</u> refers to a non-existent
                     element, then the closest element is  used.   The  selection  anchor  is  the  end  of  the
                     selection  that  is  fixed while dragging out a selection with the mouse.  The index <b>anchor</b>
                     may be used to refer to the anchor element.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>selection</b> <b>clear</b> <u>first</u> ?<u>last</u>?
                     If any of  the  elements  between  <u>first</u>  and  <u>last</u>  (inclusive)  are  selected,  they  are
                     deselected.  The selection state is not changed for elements outside this range.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>selection</b> <b>includes</b> <u>index</u>
                     Returns 1 if the element indicated by <u>index</u> is currently selected, 0 if it is not.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>selection</b> <b>set</b> <u>first</u> ?<u>last</u>?
                     Selects  all  of  the  elements  in  the  range  between <u>first</u> and <u>last</u>, inclusive, without
                     affecting the selection state of elements outside that range.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>size</b>
              Returns a decimal string indicating the total number of elements in the listbox.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>xview</b> ?<u>args</u>
              This command is used to query and change  the  horizontal  position  of  the  information  in  the
              widget's window.  It can take any of the following forms:

              <u>pathName</u> <b>xview</b>
                     Returns  a  list containing two elements.  Each element is a real fraction between 0 and 1;
                     together they describe the horizontal span that is visible in the window.  For example,  if
                     the  first  element  is  .2 and the second element is .6, 20% of the listbox's text is off-
                     screen to the left, the middle 40% is visible in the window, and 40% of the  text  is  off-
                     screen   to   the  right.   These  are  the  same  values  passed  to  scrollbars  via  the
                     <b>-xscrollcommand</b> option.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>xview</b> <u>index</u>
                     Adjusts the view in the window so that the character position given by <u>index</u>  is  displayed
                     at  the  left  edge  of  the  window.   Character positions are defined by the width of the
                     character <b>0</b>.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>xview</b> <b>moveto</b> <u>fraction</u>
                     Adjusts the view in the window so that <u>fraction</u> of the total width of the listbox  text  is
                     off-screen to the left.  <u>fraction</u> must be a fraction between 0 and 1.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>xview</b> <b>scroll</b> <u>number</u> <u>what</u>
                     This  command  shifts  the  view  in the window left or right according to <u>number</u> and <u>what</u>.
                     <u>Number</u> must be an integer or a float, but if it is a float  then  it  is  converted  to  an
                     integer, rounded away from 0.  <u>What</u> must be either <b>pages</b> or <b>units</b> or an abbreviation of one
                     of  these.   If  <u>what</u>  is  <b>pages</b>  then the view adjusts by <u>number</u> screenfuls.  If <u>number</u> is
                     negative then characters farther to the left  become  visible;   if  it  is  positive  then
                     characters farther to the right become visible.  If <u>what</u> is <b>units</b>, the view adjusts left or
                     right by <u>number</u> character units (the width of the <b>0</b> character) on the display.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>yview</b> ?<u>args</u>?
              This command is used to query and change the vertical position of the text in the widget's window.
              It can take any of the following forms:

              <u>pathName</u> <b>yview</b>
                     Returns  a  list containing two elements, both of which are real fractions between 0 and 1.
                     The first element gives the position of the listbox element  at  the  top  of  the  window,
                     relative  to  the  listbox  as  a  whole  (0.5 means it is halfway through the listbox, for
                     example).  The second element gives the position of the listbox element just after the last
                     one in the window, relative to the listbox as a whole.  These are the same values passed to
                     scrollbars via the <b>-yscrollcommand</b> option.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>yview</b> <u>index</u>
                     Adjusts the view in the window so that the element given by <u>index</u> is displayed at  the  top
                     of the window.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>yview</b> <b>moveto</b> <u>fraction</u>
                     Adjusts  the view in the window so that the element given by <u>fraction</u> appears at the top of
                     the window.  <u>Fraction</u> is a fraction between 0 and 1;  0 indicates the first element in  the
                     listbox, 0.33 indicates the element one-third the way through the listbox, and so on.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>yview</b> <b>scroll</b> <u>number</u> <u>what</u>
                     This  command  adjusts  the  view  in  the  window up or down according to <u>number</u> and <u>what</u>.
                     <u>Number</u> must be an integer or a float, but if it is a float  then  it  is  converted  to  an
                     integer,  rounded  away from 0.  <u>What</u> must be either <b>pages</b> or <b>units</b>.  If <u>what</u> is <b>pages</b> then
                     the view adjusts by <u>number</u> screenfuls.  If <u>number</u> is negative then earlier elements  become
                     visible;  if it is positive then later elements become visible.  If <u>what</u> is <b>units</b>, the view
                     adjusts up or down by <u>number</u> lines.

</pre><h4><b>DEFAULT</b> <b>BINDINGS</b></h4><pre>
       Tk  automatically  creates  class bindings for listboxes that give them Motif-like behavior.  Much of the
       behavior of a listbox is determined by its <b>-selectmode</b> option, which selects one of four ways of  dealing
       with the selection.

       If  the  selection  mode is <b>single</b> or <b>browse</b>, at most one element can be selected in the listbox at once.
       In both modes, clicking button 1 on an element selects it and deselects  any  other  selected  item.   In
       <b>browse</b>  mode it is also possible to drag the selection with button 1.  On button 1, the listbox will also
       take focus if it has a <b>normal</b> state.

       If the selection mode is <b>multiple</b> or <b>extended</b>, any number of elements may be selected at once,  including
       discontiguous  ranges.   In  <b>multiple</b>  mode,  clicking button 1 on an element toggles its selection state
       without affecting any other elements.  In <b>extended</b> mode, pressing button 1  on  an  element  selects  it,
       deselects  everything  else, and sets the anchor to the element under the mouse;  dragging the mouse with
       button 1 down extends the selection to include all the elements between the anchor and the element  under
       the mouse, inclusive.

       Most  people  will  probably want to use <b>browse</b> mode for single selections and <b>extended</b> mode for multiple
       selections; the other modes appear to be useful only in special situations.

       Any time the set of selected item(s) in the listbox is updated by the user through the keyboard or mouse,
       the virtual event <b>&lt;&lt;ListboxSelect&gt;&gt;</b> will be generated. This virtual event  will  not  be  generated  when
       adjusting  the  selection with the <u>pathName</u> <b>selection</b>  command. It is easiest to bind to this event to be
       made aware of any user changes to listbox selection.

       In addition to the above behavior, the following additional behavior is defined by the default bindings:

       [1]    In <b>extended</b> mode, the selected range can be adjusted by pressing button 1 with the Shift key down:
              this modifies the selection to consist of the elements between the anchor and  the  element  under
              the  mouse,  inclusive.   The  un-anchored  end of this new selection can also be dragged with the
              button down.

       [2]    In <b>extended</b> mode, pressing button 1 with the Control key  down  starts  a  toggle  operation:  the
              anchor  is set to the element under the mouse, and its selection state is reversed.  The selection
              state of other elements is not changed.  If the mouse is dragged with  button  1  down,  then  the
              selection state of all elements between the anchor and the element under the mouse is set to match
              that  of the anchor element;  the selection state of all other elements remains what it was before
              the toggle operation began.

       [3]    If the mouse leaves the listbox window with button 1 down, the window scrolls away from the mouse,
              making information visible that used to be off-screen on the side of  the  mouse.   The  scrolling
              continues  until the mouse re-enters the window, the button is released, or the end of the listbox
              is reached.

       [4]    Mouse button 2 may be used for scanning.  If it is pressed  and  dragged  over  the  listbox,  the
              contents of the listbox drag at high speed in the direction the mouse moves.

       [5]    If  the  Up  or  Down  key  is  pressed, the location cursor (active element) moves up or down one
              element.  If the selection mode is <b>browse</b> or <b>extended</b> then the new active element is also selected
              and all other elements are deselected.  In <b>extended</b>  mode  the  new  active  element  becomes  the
              selection anchor.

       [6]    In <b>extended</b> mode, Shift-Up and Shift-Down move the location cursor (active element) up or down one
              element  and also extend the selection to that element in a fashion similar to dragging with mouse
              button 1.

       [7]    The Left and Right keys scroll the listbox view left and right by the width of  the  character  <b>0</b>.
              Control-Left  and Control-Right scroll the listbox view left and right by the width of the window.
              Control-Prior and Control-Next also scroll left and right by the width of the window.

       [8]    The Prior and Next keys scroll the listbox view up and  down  by  one  page  (the  height  of  the
              window).

       [9]    The Home and End keys scroll the listbox horizontally to the left and right edges, respectively.

       [10]   Control-Home  sets  the location cursor to the first element in the listbox, selects that element,
              and deselects everything else in the listbox.

       [11]   Control-End sets the location cursor to the last element in the listbox, selects that element, and
              deselects everything else in the listbox.

       [12]   In <b>extended</b> mode, Control-Shift-Home extends the selection to the first element in the listbox and
              Control-Shift-End extends the selection to the last element.

       [13]   In <b>multiple</b> mode, Control-Shift-Home moves the location cursor to the first element in the listbox
              and Control-Shift-End moves the location cursor to the last element.

       [14]   The space and Select keys make a selection at the location cursor  (active  element)  just  as  if
              mouse button 1 had been pressed over this element.

       [15]   In  <b>extended</b> mode, Control-Shift-space and Shift-Select extend the selection to the active element
              just as if button 1 had been pressed with the Shift key down.

       [16]   In <b>extended</b> mode, the Escape key cancels the most recent selection and restores all  the  elements
              in the selected range to their previous selection state.

       [17]   Control-/  selects  everything  in the widget, except in <b>single</b> and <b>browse</b> modes, in which case it
              selects the active element and deselects everything else.

       [18]   Control-backslash deselects everything in the widget, except  in  <b>browse</b>  mode  where  it  has  no
              effect.

       [19]   The  F16 key (labelled Copy on many Sun workstations) or Meta-w copies the selection in the widget
              to the clipboard, if there is a selection.

       The behavior of listboxes can be changed by defining new bindings for individual widgets or by redefining
       the class bindings.
