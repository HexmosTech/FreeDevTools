</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>XmComboBox</b> — The ComboBox widget class "XmComboBox" "widget class" "ComboBox"

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;Xm/ComboBox.h&gt;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>XmComboBox</b> combines the capabilities of a single-line TextField widget and a List widget. It allows users
       to  perform  opoerations  like  typing  and  pasting information, and it also provides a list of possible
       choices that the user can select from to complete the TextField entry  field.  The  list  can  either  be
       displayed  at  all  times  or  can  be dropped down by the user. When the list portion of the ComboBox is
       hidden, users are given a visual cue (a  downward-pointing  arrow)  next  to  the  TextField  field.  The
       position  of  the arrow relative to the TextField field depends on the <b>XmNlayoutDirection</b> resource of the
       widget. This version of the ComboBox is called the "drop-down" ComboBox. Drop-down ComboBoxes are  useful
       when  screen space is limited, or when users will complete the text entry field more often by typing text
       than by selecting the entry field text from the list.  The user can  access  the  drop-down  ComboBox  in
       either one of two ways:

          •  By  clicking  and  releasing <b>&lt;Btn1&gt;</b> on the downward-pointing arrow, which pops the list up, and the
             list stays up. A later selection of an item in the list will cause the item to appear in  the  text
             entry field, and the list will unpost itself.

          •  By  pressing  <b>&lt;Btn1&gt;</b> on the downward-pointing arrow, dragging it to a list item, and then releasing
             it there, which selects that item. The list disappears, and the selected item appears in  the  text
             entry field.

       The  application  provides  an array of strings that fill the list. At creation time, string items can be
       passed to the ComboBox via an arglist.  Each string becomes an item in the list, with  the  first  string
       becoming  the  item in position 1, the second string becoming the item in position 2, and so on. The size
       of the list is set by specifying the number of items that are visible in the list  (<b>XmNvisibleItemCount</b>).
       If  the  number  of items in the list exceeds the number of items that are visible, a vertical scroll bar
       will automatically appear that allows the user to scroll through a large number of items.

       ComboBox creates two child widgets: a TextField widget for entering text and a ScrolledWindow  containing
       a  List  for the list of items.  The name of the items list itself is <b>List</b>, and the name of the TextField
       is <b>Text</b>.  The application or user can specify resource values for these widgets in a resource  file,  and
       the  application  can  use  <b>XtNameToWidget</b>  (specifying  <b>"*List"</b>  for  the  items list or <b>"*Text"</b> for the
       TextField widget) to obtain the widget IDs of the descendant widgets.  At creation time, ComboBox  passes
       appropriate  resource  values  in the creation arglist, including <b>XmNitems</b>, to the items list.  Note that
       the result of providing the <b>XmNdestroyCallback</b> resource in  the  creation  <u>arglist</u>  is  unspecified.  The
       application  should  use the <b>XtAddCallback</b> function to add callbacks to the appropriate widget (TextField
       or List) after creating it.

       ComboBox forces the following resource values on its List child:

          •  If <b>XmNcomboBoxType</b> is <b>XmCOMBO_BOX</b>, <b>XmNtraversalOn</b> is forced to False.

          •  <b>XmNhighlightThickness</b> is forced to 2 in a drop-down ComboBox and to 0 in other types of ComboBoxes.

          •  <b>XmNborderWidth</b> is forced to 0.

          •  <b>XmNnavigationType</b> is forced to <b>XmNONE</b>.

          •  <b>XmNselectionPolicy</b> is forced to <b>XmBROWSE_SELECT</b>.

          •  <b>XmNlistSizePolicy</b> is forced to <b>XmVARIABLE</b>.

          •  <b>XmNspacing</b> is forced to 0.

          •  <b>XmNvisualPolicy</b> is forced to <b>XmVARIABLE</b>.

          •  <b>XmNselectedPositions</b> is forced to NULL.

          •  <b>XmNselectedPositionsCount</b> is forced to 0.

       When <b>XmNcomboBoxType</b> is <b>XmDROP_DOWN_LIST</b>, ComboBox forces the following resource values on its  TextField
       child:

          •  <b>XmNeditable</b> is forced to False.

          •  <b>XmNcursorPositionVisible</b> is forced to False.

          •  <b>XmNshadowThickness</b> is forced to 0.

       By  contrast, when <b>XmNcomboBoxType</b> is <b>XmCOMBO_BOX</b> or <b>XmDROP_DOWN_COMBO_BOX</b>, ComboBox forces the following
       resource values on its TextField child:

          •  <b>XmNeditable</b> is forced to True.

          •  <b>XmNcursorPositionVisible</b> is forced to True.

          •  <b>XmNeditMode</b> is forced to <b>XmSINGLE_LINE_EDIT</b>.

       ComboBox always forces the values of the following resources on the TextField:

          •  <b>XmNnavigationType</b> is forced to <b>XmNONE</b>.

          •  <b>XmNhighlightThickness</b> is forced to 0.

          •  <b>XmNborderWidth</b> is forced to 0.

       ComboBox allows a single item to be selected in two ways: by selecting the desired item from the List  or
       by  entering  text  into  the  TextField.  ComboBox does not automatically select a list item if the user
       types that string into the TextField. It selects the item when the user presses <b>KActivate</b>  or  moves  the
       focus.   ComboBox supports the Browse Select selection model of List (see the <b>XmList</b> reference page for a
       description of this model), so selections are mutually exclusive. Selecting an item from the list  causes
       that  item to be displayed in the TextField portion of the ComboBox.  If an application sets the <b>XmNvalue</b>
       resource of TextField, that string is shown in the TextField.  If the application has  not  provided  any
       list items, or if there is no current selection, the TextField is empty.

       The TextField in the ComboBox widget can be either editable or noneditable, depending on the value of the
       <b>XmNcomboBoxType</b> resource.

       If  the  TextField  is  editable,  the  user can type into it.  When the user presses the Return key, the
       ComboBox will compare the typed entry to the items in the List.  If there is an  exact  match,  then  the
       matched  List  item is selected.  If the application wishes to validate the entered text (for example, to
       ensure that the typed selection is a valid one), it can do so by setting <b>XmNmodifyVerifyCallback</b>  on  the
       TextField widget.

       If  the  TextField is noneditable, typing text may invoke a matching algorithm that will attempt to match
       the entered text with items in the list. The specific matching algorithm applied, which may be  none,  is
       determined  by  the  value  of  the  <b>XmNmatchBehavior</b> resource in ComboBox, which can be either <b>XmNONE</b> or
       <b>XmQUICK_NAVIGATE</b>. A value of <b>XmNONE</b>  indicates  that  no  matching  algorithm  will  occur.  A  value  of
       <b>XmQUICK_NAVIGATE</b> indicates that when the List widget has focus, one-character navigation is supported. In
       this  algorithm, if the typed character is the initial character of some item in the List, this algorithm
       causes that item to be  navigated  to  and  selected,  and  the  item  is  displayed  in  the  TextField.
       Subsequently typing the same character will cycle among the items with the same first character.

       Regardless  of  the  selection  mechanism  used (either selected directly from the List or typed into the
       TextField), when an item in the List is selected, that item is highlighted in the List.  In addition, the
       selected item is displayed in the TextField of the ComboBox. If the user performs an  action  that  would
       move  focus away from ComboBox, or selects a List item, the <b>XmNselectionCallback</b> callbacks are invoked to
       notify the application of the current contents of the TextField (or choice). The application  then  takes
       whatever action is required based on those contents (or choice).

       ComboBox uses the <b>XmQTspecifyRenderTable</b> trait and holds the <b>XmQTaccessTextual</b> trait.

   <b>Classes</b>
       <b>XmComboBox</b> inherits behavior, resources, and traits from <b>Core</b>, <b>Composite</b>, and <b>XmManager</b> classes.

       The class pointer is <b>xmComboBoxWidgetClass</b>.

       The class name is <b>XmComboBox</b>.

   <b>New</b> <b>Resources</b>
       The  following  table  defines  a  set  of  widget  resources used by the programmer to specify data. The
       programmer can also set the resource values for the inherited classes to set attributes for this  widget.
       To  reference  a  resource by name or by class in a <b>.Xdefaults</b> file, remove the <b>XmN</b> or <b>XmC</b> prefix and use
       the remaining letters. To specify one of the defined values for a resource in a <b>.Xdefaults</b>  file,  remove
       the  <b>Xm</b>  prefix  and  use  the  remaining  letters  (in  either  lowercase  or uppercase, but include any
       underscores between words). The codes in the access column indicate if  the  given  resource  can  be  at
       creation time (C), set by using <b>XtSetValues</b> (S), retrieved by using <b>XtGetValues</b> (G), or is not applicable
       (N/A).

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS/WARNINGS</b></h4><pre>
       The toolkit will display a warning if  the  application  tries  to  set  the  value  of  <b>XmNlist</b>  or  the
       <b>XmNtextField</b> resource, which are read-only (marked G in the resource table).
