       pam_fail_delay - request a delay on failure

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;security/pam_appl.h&gt;</b>

       <b>int</b> <b>pam_fail_delay(pam_handle_t</b> <b>*</b><u>pamh</u><b>,</b> <b>unsigned</b> <b>int</b> <u>usec</u><b>);</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>pam_fail_delay</b> function provides a mechanism by which an application or module can suggest a minimum
       delay of <u>usec</u> micro-seconds. The function keeps a record of the longest time requested with this
       function. Should <b><a href="../man3/pam_authenticate.3.html">pam_authenticate</a></b>(3) fail, the failing return to the application is delayed by an amount
       of time randomly distributed (by up to 50%) about this longest value.

       Independent of success, the delay time is reset to its zero default value when the PAM service module
       returns control to the application. The delay occurs <u>after</u> all authentication modules have been called,
       but <u>before</u> control is returned to the service application.

       When using this function the programmer should check if it is available with:

           #ifdef HAVE_PAM_FAIL_DELAY
               ....
           #endif /* HAVE_PAM_FAIL_DELAY */

       For applications written with a single thread that are event driven in nature, generating this delay may
       be undesirable. Instead, the application may want to register the delay in some other way. For example,
       in a single threaded server that serves multiple authentication requests from a single event loop, the
       application might want to simply mark a given connection as blocked until an application timer expires.
       For this reason the delay function can be changed with the <u>PAM_FAIL_DELAY</u> item. It can be queried and set
       with <b><a href="../man3/pam_get_item.3.html">pam_get_item</a></b>(3) and <b><a href="../man3/pam_set_item.3.html">pam_set_item</a></b>(3) respectively. The value used to set it should be a function
       pointer of the following prototype:

           void (*delay_fn)(int retval, unsigned usec_delay, void *appdata_ptr);

       The arguments being the <u>retval</u> return code of the module stack, the <u>usec_delay</u> micro-second delay that
       libpam is requesting and the <u>appdata_ptr</u> that the application has associated with the current <u>pamh</u>. This
       last value was set by the application when it called <b><a href="../man3/pam_start.3.html">pam_start</a></b>(3) or explicitly with <b><a href="../man3/pam_set_item.3.html">pam_set_item</a></b>(3).

       Note that the PAM_FAIL_DELAY item is set to NULL by default. This indicates that PAM should perform a
       random delay as described above when authentication fails and a delay has been suggested. If an
       application does not want the PAM library to perform any delay on authentication failure, then the
       application must define a custom delay function that executes no statements and set the PAM_FAIL_DELAY
       item to point to this function.

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       It is often possible to attack an authentication scheme by exploiting the time it takes the scheme to
       deny access to an applicant user. In cases of <u>short</u> timeouts, it may prove possible to attempt a <u>brute</u>
       <u>force</u> dictionary attack -- with an automated process, the attacker tries all possible passwords to gain
       access to the system. In other cases, where individual failures can take measurable amounts of time
       (indicating the nature of the failure), an attacker can obtain useful information about the
       authentication process. These latter attacks make use of procedural delays that constitute a <u>covert</u>
       <u>channel</u> of useful information.

       To minimize the effectiveness of such attacks, it is desirable to introduce a random delay in a failed
       authentication process. Preferable this value should be set by the application or a special PAM module.
       Standard PAM modules should not modify the delay unconditional.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       For example, a login application may require a failure delay of roughly 3 seconds. It will contain the
       following code:

               pam_fail_delay (pamh, 3000000 /* micro-seconds */ );
               pam_authenticate (pamh, 0);

       if the modules do not request a delay, the failure delay will be between 1.5 and 4.5 seconds.

       However, the modules, invoked in the authentication process, may also request delays:

           module #1:    pam_fail_delay (pamh, 2000000);
           module #2:    pam_fail_delay (pamh, 4000000);

       in this case, it is the largest requested value that is used to compute the actual failed delay: here
       between 2 and 6 seconds.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUES</b></h4><pre>
       PAM_SUCCESS
           Delay was successful adjusted.

       PAM_SYSTEM_ERR
           A NULL pointer was submitted as PAM handle.
