</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       MooseX::Object::Pluggable - Make your classes pluggable

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 0.0014

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           package MyApp;
           use Moose;

           with 'MooseX::Object::Pluggable';

           ...

           package MyApp::Plugin::Pretty;
           use Moose::Role;

           sub pretty{ print "I am pretty" }

           1;

           #
           use MyApp;
           my $app = MyApp-&gt;new;
           $app-&gt;load_plugin('Pretty');
           $app-&gt;pretty;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module is meant to be loaded as a role from Moose-based classes.  It will add five methods and four
       attributes to assist you with the loading and handling of plugins and extensions for plugins. I
       understand that this may pollute your namespace, however I took great care in using the least ambiguous
       names possible.

</pre><h4><b>How</b> <b>plugins</b> <b>Work</b></h4><pre>
       Plugins and extensions are just Roles by a fancy name. They are loaded at runtime on demand and are
       instance, not class based. This means that if you have more than one instance of a class they can all
       have different plugins loaded. This is a feature.

       Plugin methods are allowed to "around", "before", "after" their consuming classes, so it is important to
       watch for load order as plugins can and will overload each other. You may also add attributes through
       "has".

       Please note that when you load at runtime you lose the ability to wrap "BUILD" and roles using "has" will
       not go through compile time checks like "required" and "default".

       Even though "override" will work, I <b>STRONGLY</b> discourage its use and a warning will be thrown if you try
       to use it.  This is closely linked to the way multiple roles being applied is handled and is not likely
       to change. "override" behavior is closely linked to inheritance and thus will likely not work as you
       expect it in multiple inheritance situations. Point being, save yourself the headache.

</pre><h4><b>How</b> <b>plugins</b> <b>are</b> <b>loaded</b></h4><pre>
       When roles are applied at runtime an anonymous class will wrap your class and "$self-&gt;blessed", "ref
       $self" and "$self-&gt;meta-&gt;name" will no longer return the name of your object; they will instead return
       the name of the anonymous class created at runtime.  See "_original_class_name".

</pre><h4><b>Usage</b></h4><pre>
       For a simple example see the tests included in this distribution.

</pre><h4><b>Attributes</b></h4><pre>
   <b>_plugin_ns</b>
       String. The prefix to use for plugin names provided. "MyApp::Plugin" is sensible.

   <b>_plugin_app_ns</b>
       An ArrayRef accessor that automatically dereferences into array on a read call.  By default it will be
       filled with the class name and its precedents. It is used to determine which directories to look for
       plugins as well as which plugins take precedence upon namespace collisions. This allows you to subclass a
       pluggable class and still use its plugins while using yours first if they are available.

   <b>_plugin_locator</b>
       An automatically built instance of Module::Pluggable::Object used to locate available plugins.

   <b>_original_class_name</b>
       Because of the way roles apply, "$self-&gt;blessed", "ref $self" and "$self-&gt;meta-&gt;name" will no longer
       return what you expect. Instead, upon instantiation, the name of the class instantiated will be stored in
       this attribute if you need to access the name the class held before any runtime roles were applied.

</pre><h4><b>Public</b> <b>Methods</b></h4><pre>
   <b>load_plugins</b> <b>@plugins</b>
   <b>load_plugin</b> <b>$plugin</b>
       Load the appropriate role for $plugin.

</pre><h4><b>Private</b> <b>Methods</b></h4><pre>
       There's nothing stopping you from using these, but if you are using them for anything that's not really
       complicated you are probably doing something wrong.

   <b>_role_from_plugin</b> <b>$plugin</b>
       Creates a role name from a plugin name. If the plugin name is prepended with a "+" it will be treated as
       a full name returned as is. Otherwise a string consisting of $plugin  prepended with the "_plugin_ns" and
       the first valid value from "_plugin_app_ns" will be returned. Example

          #assuming appname MyApp and C&lt;_plugin_ns&gt; 'Plugin'
          $self-&gt;_role_from_plugin("MyPlugin"); # MyApp::Plugin::MyPlugin

   <b>_load_and_apply_role</b> <b>@roles</b>
       Require $role if it is not already loaded and apply it. This is the meat of this module.

   <b>_build_plugin_app_ns</b>
       Automatically builds the _plugin_app_ns attribute with the classes in the class precedence list that are
       not part of Moose.

   <b>_build_plugin_locator</b>
       Automatically creates a Module::Pluggable::Object instance with the correct search_path.
