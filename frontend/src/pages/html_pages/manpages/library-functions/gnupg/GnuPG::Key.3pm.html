</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       GnuPG::Key - GnuPG Key Object

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         # assumes a GnuPG::Interface object in $gnupg
         my @keys = $gnupg-&gt;get_public_keys( 'ftobin' );

         # now GnuPG::PublicKey objects are in @keys

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       GnuPG::Key objects are generally not instantiated on their own, but rather used as a superclass of
       GnuPG::PublicKey, GnuPG::SecretKey, or GnuPG::SubKey objects.

</pre><h4><b>OBJECT</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Initialization</b> <b>Methods</b>
       new( <u>%initialization_args</u> )
           This methods creates a new object.  The optional arguments are initialization of data members.

       hash_init( <u>%args</u> ).
       short_hex_id
           This returns the commonly-used short, 8 character short hex id of the key.

       compare( <u>$other</u>, <u>$deep</u> )
           Returns  non-zero  only  when this Key is identical to the other GnuPG::Key.  If $deep is present and
           non-zero, the key's associated signatures, revocations, and revokers will also be compared.

</pre><h4><b>OBJECT</b> <b>DATA</b> <b>MEMBERS</b></h4><pre>
       length
           Number of bits in the key.

       algo_num
           They algorithm number that the Key is used for.

       usage_flags
           The Key Usage flags associated with  this  key,  represented  as  a  string  of  lower-case  letters.
           Possible values include: (a) authenticate, (c) certify, (e) encrypt, and (s) sign.

           A  key  may have any combination of them in any order.  In addition to these letters, the primary key
           has uppercase versions of the letters to denote the _usable_ capabilities of the entire  key,  and  a
           potential letter 'D' to indicate a disabled key.

           See "key capabilities" DETAILS from the GnuPG sources for more details.

       hex_data
           The  data  of  the  key.   WARNING:  this seems to have never been instantiated, and should always be
           undef.

       pubkey_data
           A list of Math::BigInt objects that correspond to the public key material for  the  given  key.  This
           member is empty on secret keys in GnuPG 1.4. It is populated on secret keys In GnuPG &gt;= 2.2.0.

           For DSA keys, the values are: prime (p), group order (q), group generator (g), y

           For RSA keys, the values are: modulus (n), exponent (e)

           For El Gamal keys, the values are: prime (p), group generator (g), y

           For more details, see: <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4880">http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4880</a>#page-42

       hex_id
           The  long  hex  id  of  the  key.   This  is not the fingerprint nor the short hex id, which is 8 hex
           characters.

       creation_date_string
       expiration_date_string
           Formatted  date  of  the  key's  creation  and  expiration.   If   the   key   has   no   expiration,
           expiration_date_string will return undef.

       creation_date
       expiration_date
           Date  of the key's creation and expiration, stored as the number of seconds since midnight 1970-01-01
           UTC.  If the key has no expiration, expiration_date will return undef.

       fingerprint
           A GnuPG::Fingerprint object.

       signatures
           A list of GnuPG::Signature objects embodying the signatures on this key.  For subkeys, the signatures
           are usually subkey-binding signatures.  For primary keys, the signatures are statements about the key
           itself.

       revocations
           A list of revocations associated with this key, stored as GnuPG::Signature objects (since revocations
           are a type of certification as well).  Note that a revocation  of  a  primary  key  has  a  different
           semantic meaning than a revocation associated with a subkey.

       revokers
           A list of GnuPG::Revoker objects associated with this key, indicating other keys which are allowed to
           revoke certifications made by this key.
