</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       GnuPG::Options - GnuPG options embodiment

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         # assuming $gnupg is a GnuPG::Interface object
         $gnupg-&gt;options-&gt;armor( 1 );
         $gnupg-&gt;options-&gt;push_recipients( 'ftobin', '0xABCD1234ABCD1234ABCD1234ABCD1234ABCD1234' );

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       GnuPG::Options objects are generally not instantiated on their own, but rather as part of a
       GnuPG::Interface object.

</pre><h4><b>OBJECT</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       new( <u>%initialization_args</u> )
           This methods creates a new object.  The optional arguments are initialization of data members.

       hash_init( <u>%args</u> ).
       copy
           Returns a copy of this object.  Useful for 'saving' options.

       get_args
           Returns  a  list  of arguments to be passed to GnuPG based on data members which are 'meta_' options,
           regular options, and then <u>extra_args</u>, in that order.

       encrypt_to
       recipients

       These options correlate directly to many GnuPG options.  For those that are boolean to GnuPG, simply that
       argument is passed.  For those that are associated with a scalar, that scalar  is  passed  passed  as  an
       argument  appropriate.   For  those  that  can be specified more than once, such as <b>recipients</b>, those are
       considered lists and passed accordingly.  Each are undefined or false to begin.

   <b>Meta</b> <b>Options</b>
       Meta options are those which do not correlate directly to any option in GnuPG, but rather are generally a
       bundle of options used to accomplish a specific goal, such as obtaining compatibility with  PGP  5.   The
       actual  arguments  each  of these reflects may change with time.  Each defaults to false unless otherwise
       specified.

       These options are being designed  and  to  provide  a  non-GnuPG-specific  abstraction,  to  help  create
       compatibility with a possible PGP::Interface module.

       To help avoid confusion, methods with take a form of a key as an object shall be prepended with <b>_</b><u>id(s)</u> if
       they only take an id; otherwise assume an object of type GnuPG::Key is required.

       meta_pgp_5_compatible
           If true, arguments are generated to try to be compatible with PGP 5.x.

       meta_pgp_2_compatible
           If true, arguments are generated to try to be compatible with PGP 2.x.

       meta_interactive
           If  false,  arguments  are  generated to try to help the using program use GnuPG in a non-interactive
           environment, such as CGI scripts.  Default is true.

       meta_signing_key_id
           This scalar reflects the key used to sign messages.  Currently this is synonymous with <u>default-key</u>.

       meta_signing_key
           This GnuPG::Key object reflects the key used to sign messages.

       meta_recipients_key_ids
           This list of scalar key ids are used to generate the  appropriate  arguments  having  these  keys  as
           recipients.

       meta_recipients_keys
           This  list of keys of the type GnuPG::Key are used to generate the appropriate arguments having these
           keys as recipients.  You probably want to have this list be of the inherited class GnuPG::SubKey,  as
           in  most  instances, OpenPGP keypairs have the encyrption key as the subkey of the primary key, which
           is used for signing.

   <b>Other</b> <b>Data</b> <b>Members</b>
       extra_args
           This is a list of any other arguments used to pass to GnuPG.  Useful to  pass  an  argument  not  yet
           covered in this package.
