</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       App::Alice - an Altogether Lovely Internet Chatting Experience

</pre><h4><b>SYNPOSIS</b></h4><pre>
           arthur:~ leedo$ alice
           Location: <a href="http://localhost">http://localhost</a>:8080/

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Alice is an IRC client that is viewed in the web browser. Alice runs in the background maintaining
       connections and collecting messages. When a browser connects, it will display the 100 most recent
       messages for each channel, and update with any new messages as they arrive.

       Alice also logs messages to an SQLite database. These logs are searchable through the web interface.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       Installation will add a new `alice` command to start the alice server.  When the command is run it will
       start the daemon and print the URL to load in your browser.

   <b>COMMANDLINE</b> <b>OPTIONS</b>
       -d --debug
           Print out additional debug information. Useful for development or finding out if something is wrong.

       -p --port
           This will change the port that the HTTP server listens on. The default port is 8080.

       -a --address
           This  will  change the IP address that the HTTP server listens on.  The default address is 127.0.0.1.
           That means alice only accepts local connections by default. If you want to connect to alice  remotely
           you should change it to the IP you want to listen on, or 0.0.0.0 to listen on all addresses.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       Most  of  alice  can  be  configured through the web interface. There are two windows that can be used to
       alter the configuration, Connections and Preferences. To bring up either of these windows click the  gear
       icon in the bottom right hand corner of the page.

       This  <b>should</b>  bring  up  the  new  window.  Some  browsers (specifically Chrome) will block this popup by
       default. If it doesn't appear make sure that you allow popups!

   <b>CONNECTION</b> <b>WINDOW</b>
       The connection window is used to add or remove servers. It should be familiar if you have  ever  used  an
       IRC client (and I assume you have.)

       The  only  difference of note is the "Avatar" field. In reality, this field just sets the <b>realname</b>. Alice
       abuses this field to get avatars for users.  If a user has an image URL or  an  email  address  as  their
       realname,  alice  will  display  the  image  next too their messages. This feature can be disabled in the
       Preferences window.

   <b>PREFERENCES</b> <b>WINDOW</b>
       The Preferences window can be used to set configuration options that are not connection specific. You can
       toggle the use of avatars, timestamps, and notifications. You can  also  edit  a  list  of  highlightable
       terms.

   <b>HTTP</b> <b>AUTHENTICATION</b>
       Some  configuration  options  do  not  have  a  UI  yet.  The  most  notable  of  these  options  is HTTP
       authentication. If you would like to use HTTP authentication, you will have to  edit  your  configuration
       file by hand. You can find this file at <a href="file:~/.alice/config.">~/.alice/config.</a>

       The config is simply a perl hash. So, if you are familiar with perl it should not be too intimidating. If
       you do not know perl, sorry! :)

       You will need to add "user" and "pass" values to the "auth" hash.  The resulting section of configuration
       might look like this:

           'auth' =&gt; {
             'user' =&gt; 'lee',
             'pass' =&gt; 'mypassword',
           },

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       /j[oin] [-network] $channel
           Takes  a  channel name as an argument, and an optional network flag.  If no network flag is provided,
           it will use the network of the current tab.

       /close
           Closes the current tab. If used in a channel it will also part the channel.

           <b>/wc</b> and <b>/part</b> are aliases for /close

       /clear
           This will clear the current tab's messages from your browser. It will also clear  the  tab's  message
           buffer so when you refresh your browser the messages won't re-appear.

       /msg [-network] &lt;nick&gt; [&lt;msg&gt;]
           Takes a nick as an argument and an optional network flag. If no network flag is provided, it will use
           the network of the current tab. A third argument may be used for the message text. If no message text
           is provided, a blank tab will be opened.

           <b>/query</b> is an alias for /msg

       /whois [-force] &lt;nick&gt;
           Takes  a  nick  as an argument and an optional force flag. This will print some information about the
           supplied user. If the force flag is provided, the information will be refreshed from the server.

       /quote &lt;command&gt;
           Sends a string as a raw message to the server.

           <b>/raw</b> is an alias for /quote

       /t[opic] [&lt;topic&gt;]
           Takes an optional topic string. This will display the topic for the current  tab.   If  a  string  is
           supplied, it will attempt to update the channel's topic.  Only works in a channel.

       /n[ames] [-avatars]
           This  will  print  a  table  of all of the nicks in the current tab.  An optional avatars flag can be
           provided to include avatars.

       /me &lt;action&gt;
           Sends a string as an action to the channel.

           e.g. * lee hits clint with a large trout

       /w[indow] &lt;number&gt;
           Focus the provided tab number. Also accepts "next" or "prev". The space after the w  can  be  ommited
           (e.g. /w4 to focus window 4.)

       /connect &lt;network&gt;
           Connect  to  a  network. The network must be the name of a server from the Connections window. If you
           are already connected to the network it will do nothing.

       /disconnect &lt;network&gt;
           Disconnect from a network. The network must be the name of a server from the Connections window. This
           command will also stop any reconnect timers for that network.

       /ignore &lt;nick&gt;
           Ignore any nick that matches the one provided. <b>This</b> <b>applies</b> <b>across</b> <b>all</b> <b>networks.</b>

       /ignores
           List all active ignored nicks.

       /unignore &lt;nick&gt;
           Unignore a nick.

</pre><h4><b>NOTIFICATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       If you get a message with your nick in the body while no browsers are connected, a notification  will  be
       sent using either Growl (if running on OS X) or libnotify (on Linux.)

       You can add additional patterns to highlight in the Preferences window.

       If  you  are using Fluid.app (a SSB for OS X) or Chrome you can also get notifications when the window is
       unfocused.

</pre><h4><b>MOBILE</b> <b>INTERFACE</b></h4><pre>
       Alice has an iPhone style sheet, but it may work in other mobile  browsers  as  well.  Any  help  or  bug
       reports would be much appreciated.
