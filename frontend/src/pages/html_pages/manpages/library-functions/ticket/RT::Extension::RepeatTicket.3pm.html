</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       RT::Extension::RepeatTicket - Repeat tickets based on schedule

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The RepeatTicket extension allows you to set up recurring tickets so new tickets are automatically
       created based on a schedule. The new tickets are populated with the subject and initial content of the
       original ticket in the recurrence.

       After you activate the plugin by adding it to your RT_SiteConfig.pm file, all tickets will have a
       Recurrence tab on the create and edit pages. To set up a repeating ticket, click the checkbox to "Enable
       Recurrence" and fill out the schedule for the new tickets.

       New tickets are created when you initially save the recurrence, if new tickets are needed, and when your
       daily cron job runs the rt-repeat-ticket script.

</pre><h4><b>INSTALLATION</b></h4><pre>
       "perl Makefile.PL"
       "make"
       "make install"
           May need root permissions

       "make initdb"
           Only run this the first time you install this module.

           If you run this twice, you may end up with duplicate data in your database.

           If you are upgrading this module, check for upgrading instructions in case changes need to be made to
           your database.

       Edit your <u>/opt/rt4/etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm</u>
           If you are using RT 4.2 or greater, add this line:

               Plugin('RT::Extension::RepeatTicket');

           For RT 4.0, add this line:

               Set(@Plugins, qw(RT::Extension::RepeatTicket));

           or add "RT::Extension::RepeatTicket" to your existing @Plugins line.

       Clear your mason cache
               rm -rf /opt/rt4/var/mason_data/obj

       Add <u>bin/rt-repeat-ticket</u> to the daily cron job.
       Restart your webserver

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
   <b>$RepeatTicketCoexistentNumber</b>
       The $RepeatTicketCoexistentNumber determines how many tickets can be in an active status for a recurrence
       at  any  time.  A  value  of 1 means one ticket at a time can be active.  New tickets will not be created
       until the current active ticket is resolved or set to some other inactive status. You can also  set  this
       value per recurrence, overriding this config value.  The extension default is 1 ticket.

   <b>$RepeatTicketLeadTime</b>
       The  $RepeatTicketLeadTime  becomes the ticket Starts value and sets how far in advance of a ticket's Due
       date you want the ticket to be created. This essentially is how long you want to give people to  work  on
       the ticket.

       For example, if you create a weekly recurrence scheduled on Mondays and set the lead time to 7 days, each
       Monday  a  ticket will be created with the Starts date set to that Monday and a Due date of the following
       Monday.

       The value you set in RT_SiteConfig.pm becomes the system default, but you can  set  this  value  on  each
       ticket as well. The extension default is 14 days.

   <b>$RepeatTicketSubjectFormat</b>
       By  default,  repeated  tickets  will  have  the same subject as the original ticket. You can modify this
       subject by setting a format with the $RepeatTicketSubjectFormat option. This option  accepts  formats  in
       the  same form as formats for RT searches. The placeholders take values from the repeated ticket, not the
       original ticket, so you can use the format to help differentiate the subjects in repeated tickets.

       For example, if you wanted to put the due date in the subject, you could set the format to:

           Set($RepeatTicketSubjectFormat, '__Due__ __Subject__');

       You'll want to use values that you don't expect to change since the subject won't change  if  the  ticket
       value (e.g., Due) is changed.

       Since  this  uses  RT formats, you can create a custom format by creating a new RT ColumnMap. You can see
       the available formats by looking at the columns available in the Display Columns portlet on the RT ticket
       search page.

   <b>rt-repeat-ticket</b>
       The rt-repeat-ticket utility evaluates all of your repeating tickets and creates any new tickets that are
       needed. With no parameters, it runs for "today" each day. You can also pass a --date value  in  the  form
       YYYY-MM-DD to run the script for a specific day.

           bin/rt-repeat-ticket --date 2012-07-25

       This  can  be  handy  if your cron job doesn't run for some reason and you want to make sure no repeating
       tickets have been missed. Just go back and run the script for the days you  missed.  You  can  also  pass
       dates  in  the  future  which  might  be  handy  if  you  want  to  experiment with recurrences in a test
       environment.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Initial</b> <b>Tickets</b>
       The initial ticket you create for a recurrence stores the schedule and other details for the  recurrence.
       If you need to change the recurrence in the future, to make it more frequent or less frequent or anything
       else, make the changes on the original ticket.  To help you find this initial ticket, which may have been
       resolved  long ago, a custom field is created on each ticket in the recurrence with link called "Original
       Ticket."

       When setting up the recurrence, you can use the original ticket as an  actual  work  ticket.  When  doing
       this,  you'll  need to set the Starts and Due dates when you create the ticket. Scheduled tickets created
       subsequently will set these values based on the recurrence. Resolving the original ticket does not cancel
       the recurrence.

   <b>Start</b> <b>Value</b>
       You can set a Start date for a new recurrence. If you don't, it  defaults  to  the  day  you  create  the
       recurrence.

   <b>Cancelling</b> <b>Recurrences</b>
       You can cancel or end a recurrence in two ways:

       •   Go to the original ticket in the recurrence and uncheck the Enable Recurrence checkbox.

       •   Set ending conditions on the recurrence with either a set number of recurrences or an end date.

   <b>Recursive</b> <b>Recurrences</b>
       Creating recurrences on recurrences isn't supported and may do strange things.

</pre><h4><b>FAQ</b></h4><pre>
       I'm not seeing new recurrences. Why not?
           A few things to check:

           •   Do you have rt-repeat-tickets scheduled in cron? Is it running?

           •   Do  you  have  previous  tickets  still in an active state? Resolve those tickets or increase the
               concurrent active tickets value.

           •   Is it the right day? Remember to subtract the lead time value to determine the  day  new  tickets
               should be created.

           •   If you set a start date and another criteria like day of the week, the new ticket will be created
               on  the  first  time  that day of the week occurs after the start date you set (if the start date
               isn't on that day of the week).

       I want to enable the repeat function only on some queues
           To do this, insetad of applying the "Original Ticket" custom field globally, you can apply it to  the
           chosen queues and that's it.

       some users can't see or use this feature successfully.
           Make  sure  those  users  have  "SeeCustomField" and "ModifyCusotmField" rights granted for "Original
           Ticket" custom field.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Run(</b> <b>RT::Attribute</b> <b>$attr,</b> <b>DateTime</b> <b>$checkday</b> <b>)</b>
       Repeat the ticket if $checkday meets the repeat settings.  It also tries to repeat more  to  meet  config
       "RepeatTicketCoexistentNumber".

       Return ids of new created tickets.

   <b>Repeat</b> <b>(</b> <b>RT::Attribute</b> <b>$attr,</b> <b>DateTime</b> <b>$checkday_1,</b> <b>DateTime</b> <b>$checkday_2,</b> <b>...</b> <b>)</b>
       Repeat the ticket for the check days that meet repeat settings.

       Return ids of new created tickets.

   <b>MaybeRepeatMore</b> <b>(</b> <b>RT::Attribute</b> <b>$attr</b> <b>)</b>
       Try to repeat more tickets to meet the coexistent ticket number.

       Return ids of new created tickets.

   <b>SetRepeatAttribute</b> <b>(</b> <b>RT::Ticket</b> <b>$ticket,</b> <b>%args</b> <b>)</b>
       Save %args to the ticket's "RepeatTicketSettings" attribute.

       Return ( RT::Attribute, UPDATE MESSAGE )
