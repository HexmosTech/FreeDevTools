       RT::Client::REST::Ticket - ticket object representation.

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 0.72

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         my $rt = RT::Client::REST-&gt;new(server =&gt; $ENV{RTSERVER});

         # Create a new ticket:
         my $ticket = RT::Client::REST::Ticket-&gt;new(
           rt =&gt; $rt,
           queue =&gt; "General",
           subject =&gt; $subject,
         )-&gt;store(text =&gt; "This is the initial text of the ticket");
         print "Created a new ticket, ID ", $ticket-&gt;id, "\n";

         # Update

           priority =&gt; 10,
         )-&gt;store;

         # Retrieve
         my $ticket =&gt; RT::Client::REST::Ticket-&gt;new(
           rt =&gt; $rt,
           id =&gt; $id,
         )-&gt;retrieve;

         unless ($ticket-&gt;owner eq $me) {
           $ticket-&gt;steal;     # Give me more work!
         }

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>RT::Client::REST::Ticket</b> is based on RT::Client::REST::Object.  The representation allows one to
       retrieve, edit, comment on, and create tickets in RT.

</pre><h4><b>ATTRIBUTES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>id</b>
         This is the numeric ID of the ticket.

       <b>queue</b>
         This is the <b>name</b> of the queue (not numeric id).

       <b>owner</b>
         Username of the owner.

       <b>creator</b>
         Username of RT user who created the ticket.

       <b>subject</b>
         Subject of the ticket.

       <b>status</b>
         The  status  is  usually  one  of  the following: "new", "open", "resolved", "stalled", "rejected", and
         "deleted".  However, custom RT installations sometimes add their own statuses.

       <b>priority</b>
         Ticket priority.  Usually a numeric value.

       <b>initial_priority</b>
       <b>final_priority</b>
       <b>requestor</b>
         This is the attribute for setting the requestor on ticket creation.  If you use requestors to  do  this
         in  3.8, the recipient may not receive an auto-reply from RT because the ticket is initially created as
         the user your REST session is connected as.

         It is a list  attribute  (for  explanation  of  list  attributes,  see  <b>LIST</b>  <b>ATTRIBUTE</b>  <b>PROPERTIES</b>  in
         RT::Client::REST::Object).

       <b>requestors</b>
         This contains e-mail addresses of the requestors.

         It  is  a  list  attribute  (for  explanation  of  list  attributes,  see  <b>LIST</b> <b>ATTRIBUTE</b> <b>PROPERTIES</b> in
         RT::Client::REST::Object).

       <b>cc</b>
         A list of e-mail addresses used to notify people of 'correspond' actions.

       <b>admin_cc</b>
         A list of e-mail addresses used to notify people of all actions performed on a ticket.

       <b>created</b>
         Time at which ticket was created. Note that this is an immutable field and therefore the  value  cannot
         be changed..

       <b>starts</b>
       <b>started</b>
       <b>due</b>
       <b>resolved</b>
       <b>told</b>
       <b>time_estimated</b>
       <b>time_worked</b>
       <b>time_left</b>
       <b>last_updated</b>

   <b>Attributes</b> <b>storing</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b>
       The  attributes  which  store  a time stamp have an additional accessor with the suffix "_datetime" (e.g.
       "resolved_datetime").  This allows  you  can  get  and  set  the  stored  value  as  a  DateTime  object.
       Internally, it is converted into the date-time string which RT uses, which is assumed to be in UTC.

</pre><h4><b>DB</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       For full explanation of these, please see <b>"DB</b> <b>METHODS"</b> in RT::Client::REST::Object documentation.

       <b>retrieve</b>
         Retrieve RT ticket from database.

       <b>store</b> <b>([text</b> <b>=&gt;</b> <b>$text])</b>
         Create  or update the ticket.  When creating a new ticket, optional 'text' parameter can be supplied to
         set the initial text of the ticket.

       <b>search</b>
         Search for tickets that meet specific conditions.

</pre><h4><b>TICKET-SPECIFIC</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>comment</b> (message =&gt; $message, %opts)
         Comment on this ticket with message $message.  %opts is a list of key-value pairs as follows:

         <b>attachments</b>
           List of filenames (an array reference) that should be attached to the ticket along with the comment.

         <b>cc</b>
           List of e-mail addresses to send carbon copies to (an array reference).

         <b>bcc</b>
           List of e-mail addresses to send blind carbon copies to (an array reference).

       <b>correspond</b> (message =&gt; $message, %opts)
         Add correspondence to the ticket.  Takes exactly the same arguments as the <b>comment</b> method above.

       <b>attachments</b>
         Get  attachments  associated  with  this  ticket.   What   is   returned   is   an   object   of   type
         RT::Client::REST::SearchResult    which    can   then   be   used   to   get   at   objects   of   type
         RT::Client::REST::Attachment.

       <b>transactions</b>
         Get transactions associated with this ticket.  Optionally,  you  can  specify  exactly  what  types  of
         transactions you want listed, for example:

           my $result = $ticket-&gt;transactions(type =&gt; [qw(Comment Correspond)]);

         Please reference RT::Client::REST documentation for the full list of valid transaction types.

         Return value is an object of type RT::Client::REST::SearchResult which can then be used to iterate over
         transaction objects (RT::Client::REST::Transaction).

       <b>take</b>
         Take      this      ticket.       If      you     already     the     owner     of     this     ticket,
         "RT::Client::REST::Object::NoopOperationException" will be thrown.

       <b>untake</b>
         Untake    this    ticket.     If    Nobody    is    already    the    owner     of     this     ticket,
         "RT::Client::REST::Object::NoopOperationException" will be thrown.

       <b>steal</b>
         Steal      this      ticket.       If     you     already     the     owner     of     this     ticket,
         "RT::Client::REST::Object::NoopOperationException" will be thrown.

</pre><h4><b>CUSTOM</b> <b>FIELDS</b></h4><pre>
       This class inherits 'cf' method from RT::Client::REST::Object.  To create a ticket with a bunch of custom
       fields, use the following approach:

         RT::Client::REST::Ticket-&gt;new(
           rt =&gt; $rt,
           # blah blah
           cf =&gt; {
             'field one' =&gt; $value1,
             'field two' =&gt; $another_value,
           },
         )-&gt;store;

       Some more examples:

         # Update a custom field value:
         $ticket-&gt;cf('field one' =&gt; $value1);
         $ticket-&gt;store;

         # Get a custom field value:
         my $another value = $ticket-&gt;cf('field two');

         # Get a list of ticket's custom field names:
         my @custom_fields = $ticket-&gt;cf;

</pre><h4><b>INTERNAL</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>rt_type</b>
         Returns 'ticket'.
