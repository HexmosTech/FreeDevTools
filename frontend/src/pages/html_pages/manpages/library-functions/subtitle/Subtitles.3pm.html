       Subtitles - handle video subtitles in various text formats

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Video files (avi mpeg etc) are sometimes accompanied with subtitles, which are currently very popular as
       text files. "Subtitles" provides means for simple loading, re-timing, and storing these subtitle files.
       A command-line tool <u>subs</u> for the same purpose and using "Subtitles" interface is included in the
       distribution.

       The module supports "srt", "sub", "smi", and "mdvd" subtitle formats.

       Time values are floats, in seconds with millisecond precision.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
               use Subtitles;

               my $sub = Subtitles-&gt;new();

               open F, 'Ichi The Killer.sub' or die "Cannot read:$!";
               die "Cannot load:$@\n" unless $sub-&gt; load(\*F);
               close F;

               # back two minutes
               $sub-&gt; shift( $sub-&gt; parse_time('-02:00'));

               # re-frame from 25 fps
               $sub-&gt; scale( 23.976 / 25 );

               # or both
               $sub-&gt; transform( -120, 0.96);
               $sub-&gt; transform( -120, 0.96, 0, $sub-&gt; length - 60);

               # split in 2
               my ( $part1, $part2) = $sub-&gt; split( $self-&gt; length / 2);

               # join back with 5-second gap
               $part1-&gt; join( $part2, 5);

               # save
               open F, "&gt; out.sub" or die "Cannot write:$!\n";
               $part1-&gt; save( \*F);
               close F;

               # report
               print "sub is ", time2str( $sub-&gt; length);

</pre><h4><b>API</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Package</b> <b>methods</b>
       codecs
           Returns array of installed codecs.

       hms2time HOURS, MINUTES, SECONDS, MILLISECONDS
           Combines four parameters into float time in seconds.

       time2hms TIME
           Splits  time  into  four integers, - hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds.  If time is less than
           zero, zero times are returned.

       time2shms
           Splits time into five integers, - time sign, hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds.

       time2str TIME
           Converts time to a human-readable string.

   <b>Object</b> <b>methods</b>
       clear
           Removes all content

       codec [ STRING ]
           If STRING is not defined, returns currently associated codec.   Otherwise,  sets  the  new  codec  in
           association. The STRING is the codec's package name, such as "Subtitles::Codec::srt".

       dup [ CLEAR ]
           Duplicates object instance in deep-copy fashion. If CLEAR flag is set, timeframes are not copied.

       join GUEST, GAP
           Adds content of object GUEST at the end of the list of subtitles with GAP in seconds.

       length
           Returns length of subtitle span.

       load FH [ CODEC ]
           Reads  subtitle  content  into  object.  If successful, returns 1; otherwise undef is returned and $@
           contains the error.

           By default, tries to deduce which codec to use; to point the selection explicitly CODEC string is  to
           be used.

       lines
           Returns number of subtitle cues.

       new Creates a new instance. To force a particular codec, supply "codec" string here.

       parse_time STRING
           Parses  STRING  which  is  either  a "[[HH:]MM:]SS[,MSEC]" string or string in a format specific to a
           codec, for example, number of a frame.

       rate FPS
           Forces a particluar frame-per-second rate, if a codec can make use of it.

       save FH
           Writes content of instance into FH file handle, using the associated codec.

       scale A
           Changes time-scale. If A is 2, the subtitles go off 2 times slower, if 0.5 - two times faster, etc.

       shift B
           Shifts timings by B seconds. B can be negative.

       split TIME
           Splits the content of the instance between two newly created instances of the same  class,  by  TIME,
           and returns these. The both resulting subtitles begin at time 0.

       transform A, B [FROM, TO]
           Applies  linear transformation to the time-scale, such as "u = At + B" where "t" is the original time
           and "u" is the result. If FROM and TO brackets are set, the changes are applied only to the lines  in
           the timeframe between these.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       This is alpha code, more a proof-of-concept rather that anything else, so most surely bugs are lurking.

       Anyway: not all subtitle types are recognized.  The modules doesn't handle multi-language subtitles.
