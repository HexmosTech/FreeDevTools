       pt::peg::export::container - PEG Export Plugin. Write CONTAINER format

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       package require <b>Tcl</b> <b>8.5</b> <b>9</b>

       package require <b>pt::peg::export::container</b> <b>?1?</b>

       package require <b>pt::peg::to::container</b>

________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Are  you lost ?  Do you have trouble understanding this document ?  In that case please read the overview
       provided by the <u>Introduction</u> <u>to</u> <u>Parser</u> <u>Tools</u>. This document is the entrypoint to  the  whole  system  the
       current package is a part of.

       This  package  implements  the  parsing  expression grammar export plugin for the generation of CONTAINER
       markup.

       It resides in the Export section of the Core Layer of  Parser  Tools  and  is  intended  to  be  used  by
       <b>pt::peg::export</b>,   the  export  manager,  sitting  between  it  and  the  corresponding  core  conversion
       functionality provided by <b>pt::peg::to::container</b>.

       IMAGE: arch_core_eplugins

       While the direct use  of  this  package  with  a  regular  interpreter  is  possible,  this  is  strongly
       disrecommended  and requires a number of contortions to provide the expected environment.  The proper way
       to use this functionality depends on the situation:

       [1]    In an untrusted environment the proper access is  through  the  package  <b>pt::peg::export</b>  and  the
              export manager objects it provides.

       [2]    In a trusted environment however simply use the package <b>pt::peg::to::container</b> and access the core
              conversion functionality directly.

</pre><h4><b>API</b></h4><pre>
       The  API provided by this package satisfies the specification of the Plugin API found in the <u>Parser</u> <u>Tools</u>
       <u>Export</u> <u>API</u> specification.

       <b>export</b> <u>serial</u> <u>configuration</u>
              This command takes the canonical serialization of a parsing expression grammar,  as  specified  in
              section  <b>PEG</b>  <b>serialization</b>  <b>format</b>, and contained in <u>serial</u>, the <u>configuration</u>, a dictionary, and
              generates CONTAINER markup encoding the grammar.  The created  string  is  then  returned  as  the
              result of the command.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       The CONTAINER export plugin recognizes the following configuration variables and changes its behaviour as
       they specify.

       enum <u>mode</u>
              The  value  of  this configuration variable controls which methods of <b>pt::peg</b> instances the plugin
              will use to specify the grammar. There are two legal values

              <b>bulk</b>   In this mode the methods <b>start</b>, <b>add</b>, <b>modes</b>, and <b>rules</b> are used to specify the grammar in  a
                     bulk  manner,  i.e.  as a set of nonterminal symbols, and two dictionaries mapping from the
                     symbols to their semantic modes and parsing expressions.

                     This mode is the default.

              <b>incremental</b>
                     In this mode the methods <b>start</b>, <b>add</b>, <b>mode</b>,  and  <b>rule</b>  are  used  to  specify  the  grammar
                     piecemal, with each nonterminal having its own block of defining commands.

       string <u>template</u>
              If  this  configuration  variable  is  set it is assumed to contain a string into which to put the
              generated code and other configuration data. The various locations are expected  to  be  specified
              with the following placeholders:

              <b>@user@</b> To be replaced with the value of the configuration variable <b>user</b>.

              <b>@format@</b>
                     To be replaced with the the constant <b>CONTAINER</b>.

              <b>@file@</b> To be replaced with the value of the configuration variable <b>file</b>.

              <b>@name@</b> To be replaced with the value of the configuration variable <b>name</b>.

              <b>@mode@</b> To be replaced with the value of the configuration variable <b>mode</b>.

              <b>@code@</b> To be replaced with the generated code.

       If  this  configuration variable is not set, or empty, then the plugin falls back to a standard template,
       which is defined as "<b>@code@</b>".

       <u>Note</u> that this plugin may ignore the standard configuration  variables  <b>user</b>,  <b>format</b>,  <b>file</b>,  and  their
       values, depending on the chosen template.

       The  content  of  the standard configuration variable <b>name</b>, if set, is used as name of the grammar in the
       output. Otherwise the plugin falls back to the default name <b>a_pe_grammar</b>.

</pre><h4><b>GRAMMAR</b> <b>CONTAINER</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>container</b> format is another form of describing parsing expression grammars. While data in this format
       is executable it does not constitute a parser for the grammar. It always has to be  used  in  conjunction
       with the package <b>pt::peg::interp</b>, a grammar interpreter.

       The  format  represents  grammars  by a <b>snit::type</b>, i.e. class, whose instances are API-compatible to the
       instances of the <b>pt::peg::container</b> package, and which are preloaded with the grammar in question.

       It has no direct formal specification beyond what was said above.

   <b>EXAMPLE</b>
       Assuming the following PEG for simple mathematical expressions

              PEG calculator (Expression)
                  Digit      &lt;- '0'/'1'/'2'/'3'/'4'/'5'/'6'/'7'/'8'/'9'       ;
                  Sign       &lt;- '-' / '+'                                     ;
                  Number     &lt;- Sign? Digit+                                  ;
                  Expression &lt;- Term (AddOp Term)*                            ;
                  MulOp      &lt;- '*' / '/'                                     ;
                  Term       &lt;- Factor (MulOp Factor)*                        ;
                  AddOp      &lt;- '+'/'-'                                       ;
                  Factor     &lt;- '(' Expression ')' / Number                   ;
              END;

       one possible CONTAINER serialization for it is

              snit::type a_pe_grammar {
                  constructor {} {
                      install myg using pt::peg::container ${selfns}::G
                      $myg start {n Expression}
                      $myg add   AddOp Digit Expression Factor MulOp Number Sign Term
                      $myg modes {
                          AddOp      value
                          Digit      value
                          Expression value
                          Factor     value
                          MulOp      value
                          Number     value
                          Sign       value
                          Term       value
                      }
                      $myg rules {
                          AddOp      {/ {t -} {t +}}
                          Digit      {/ {t 0} {t 1} {t 2} {t 3} {t 4} {t 5} {t 6} {t 7} {t 8} {t 9}}
                          Expression {/ {x {t \50} {n Expression} {t \51}} {x {n Factor} {* {x {n MulOp} {n Factor}}}}}
                          Factor     {x {n Term} {* {x {n AddOp} {n Term}}}}
                          MulOp      {/ {t *} {t /}}
                          Number     {x {? {n Sign}} {+ {n Digit}}}
                          Sign       {/ {t -} {t +}}
                          Term       {n Number}
                      }
                      return
                  }

                  component myg
                  delegate method * to myg
              }

</pre><h4><b>PEG</b> <b>SERIALIZATION</b> <b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
       Here we specify the format used by the Parser Tools to serialize Parsing Expression Grammars as immutable
       values for transport, comparison, etc.

       We distinguish between <u>regular</u> and <u>canonical</u> serializations.  While a PEG may have more than one  regular
       serialization only exactly one of them will be <u>canonical</u>.

       regular serialization

              [1]    The serialization of any PEG is a nested Tcl dictionary.

              [2]    This  dictionary  holds a single key, <b>pt::grammar::peg</b>, and its value. This value holds the
                     contents of the grammar.

              [3]    The contents of the grammar are a Tcl dictionary holding the set of nonterminal symbols and
                     the starting expression. The relevant keys and their values are

                     <b>rules</b>  The value is a Tcl dictionary whose keys are the names of  the  nonterminal  symbols
                            known to the grammar.

                            [1]    Each nonterminal symbol may occur only once.

                            [2]    The empty string is not a legal nonterminal symbol.

                            [3]    The  value  for each symbol is a Tcl dictionary itself. The relevant keys and
                                   their values in this dictionary are

                                   <b>is</b>     The value is the serialization of the  parsing  expression  describing
                                          the  symbols  sentennial  structure,  as  specified  in the section <b>PE</b>
                                          <b>serialization</b> <b>format</b>.

                                   <b>mode</b>   The value can be one of three values specifying how  a  parser  should
                                          handle the semantic value produced by the symbol.

                                          <b>value</b>  The  semantic  value  of  the nonterminal symbol is an abstract
                                                 syntax  tree  consisting  of  a  single  node  node   for   the
                                                 nonterminal  itself,  which  has the ASTs of the symbol's right
                                                 hand side as its children.

                                          <b>leaf</b>   The semantic value of the nonterminal  symbol  is  an  abstract
                                                 syntax   tree   consisting  of  a  single  node  node  for  the
                                                 nonterminal, without any children. Any ASTs  generated  by  the
                                                 symbol's right hand side are discarded.

                                          <b>void</b>   The  nonterminal  has  no semantic value. Any ASTs generated by
                                                 the symbol's right hand side are discarded (as well).

                     <b>start</b>  The value is the serialization of the start parsing expression of  the  grammar,  as
                            specified in the section <b>PE</b> <b>serialization</b> <b>format</b>.

              [4]    The  terminal  symbols  of  the grammar are specified implicitly as the set of all terminal
                     symbols used in the start expression and on the RHS of the grammar rules.

       canonical serialization
              The canonical serialization of a grammar has the format as specified in  the  previous  item,  and
              then  additionally  satisfies  the  constraints below, which make it unique among all the possible
              serializations of this grammar.

              [1]    The keys found in all the nested Tcl dictionaries are sorted in ascending dictionary order,
                     as generated by Tcl's builtin command <b>lsort</b> <b>-increasing</b> <b>-dict</b>.

              [2]    The string representation of the value is the canonical representation of a Tcl dictionary.
                     I.e. it does not contain superfluous whitespace.

   <b>EXAMPLE</b>
       Assuming the following PEG for simple mathematical expressions

              PEG calculator (Expression)
                  Digit      &lt;- '0'/'1'/'2'/'3'/'4'/'5'/'6'/'7'/'8'/'9'       ;
                  Sign       &lt;- '-' / '+'                                     ;
                  Number     &lt;- Sign? Digit+                                  ;
                  Expression &lt;- Term (AddOp Term)*                            ;
                  MulOp      &lt;- '*' / '/'                                     ;
                  Term       &lt;- Factor (MulOp Factor)*                        ;
                  AddOp      &lt;- '+'/'-'                                       ;
                  Factor     &lt;- '(' Expression ')' / Number                   ;
              END;

       then its canonical serialization (except for whitespace) is

              pt::grammar::peg {
                  rules {
                      AddOp      {is {/ {t -} {t +}}                                                                mode value}
                      Digit      {is {/ {t 0} {t 1} {t 2} {t 3} {t 4} {t 5} {t 6} {t 7} {t 8} {t 9}}                mode value}
                      Expression {is {x {n Term} {* {x {n AddOp} {n Term}}}}                                        mode value}
                      Factor     {is {/ {x {t (} {n Expression} {t )}} {n Number}}                                  mode value}
                      MulOp      {is {/ {t *} {t /}}                                                                mode value}
                      Number     {is {x {? {n Sign}} {+ {n Digit}}}                                                 mode value}
                      Sign       {is {/ {t -} {t +}}                                                                mode value}
                      Term       {is {x {n Factor} {* {x {n MulOp} {n Factor}}}}                                    mode value}
                  }
                  start {n Expression}
              }

</pre><h4><b>PE</b> <b>SERIALIZATION</b> <b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
       Here we specify the format used by the Parser Tools to serialize Parsing Expressions as immutable  values
       for transport, comparison, etc.

       We  distinguish  between  <u>regular</u> and <u>canonical</u> serializations.  While a parsing expression may have more
       than one regular serialization only exactly one of them will be <u>canonical</u>.

       Regular serialization

              <b>Atomic</b> <b>Parsing</b> <b>Expressions</b>

                     [1]    The string <b>epsilon</b> is an atomic parsing expression. It matches the empty string.

              <b>Combined</b> <b>Parsing</b> <b>Expressions</b>

                     [1]    For  parsing  expressions <b>e1</b>, <b>e2</b>, ... the result of [list / <b>e1</b> <b>e2</b> ... ] is a parsing
                            expression as well.  This is the <u>ordered</u> <u>choice</u>, aka <u>prioritized</u> <u>choice</u>.

                     [2]    For parsing expressions <b>e1</b>, <b>e2</b>, ... the result of [list x <b>e1</b> <b>e2</b> ... ] is  a  parsing
                            expression as well.  This is the <u>sequence</u>.

                     [3]    For a parsing expression <b>e</b> the result of [list * <b>e</b>] is a parsing expression as well.
                            This is the <u>kleene</u> <u>closure</u>, describing zero or more repetitions.

                     [4]    For a parsing expression <b>e</b> the result of [list + <b>e</b>] is a parsing expression as well.
                            This is the <u>positive</u> <u>kleene</u> <u>closure</u>, describing one or more repetitions.

                     [5]    For a parsing expression <b>e</b> the result of [list &amp; <b>e</b>] is a parsing expression as well.
                            This is the <u>and</u> <u>lookahead</u> <u>predicate</u>.

                     [6]    For a parsing expression <b>e</b> the result of [list ! <b>e</b>] is a parsing expression as well.
                            This is the <u>not</u> <u>lookahead</u> <u>predicate</u>.

                     [7]    For a parsing expression <b>e</b> the result of [list ? <b>e</b>] is a parsing expression as well.
                            This is the <u>optional</u> <u>input</u>.

       Canonical serialization
              The  canonical  serialization  of a parsing expression has the format as specified in the previous
              item, and then additionally satisfies the constraints below, which make it unique  among  all  the
              possible serializations of this parsing expression.

              [1]    The  string representation of the value is the canonical representation of a pure Tcl list.
                     I.e. it does not contain superfluous whitespace.

              [2]    Terminals are <u>not</u> encoded as ranges (where start and end of the range are identical).

   <b>EXAMPLE</b>
       Assuming the parsing expression shown on the right-hand side of the rule

                  Expression &lt;- Term (AddOp Term)*

       then its canonical serialization (except for whitespace) is

                  {x {n Term} {* {x {n AddOp} {n Term}}}}
