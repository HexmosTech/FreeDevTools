       Export::Attrs - The Perl 6 'is export(...)' trait as a Perl 5 attribute

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This document describes Export::Attrs version v0.1.0

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           package Some::Module;
           use Export::Attrs;

           # Export &amp;foo by default, when explicitly requested,
           # or when the ':ALL' export set is requested...

           sub foo :Export(:DEFAULT) {
               print "phooo!";
           }

           # Export &amp;var by default, when explicitly requested,
           # or when the ':bees', ':pubs', or ':ALL' export set is requested...
           # the parens after 'is export' are like the parens of a qw(...)

           sub bar :Export(:DEFAULT :bees :pubs) {
               print "baaa!";
           }

           # Export &amp;baz when explicitly requested
           # or when the ':bees' or ':ALL' export set is requested...

           sub baz :Export(:bees) {
               print "baassss!";
           }

           # Always export &amp;qux
           # (no matter what else is explicitly or implicitly requested)

           sub qux :Export(:MANDATORY) {
               print "quuuuuuuuux!";
           }

           # Allow the constant $PI to be exported when requested...

           use Readonly;
           Readonly our $PI :Export =&gt; 355/113;

           # Allow the variable $EPSILON to be always exported...

           our $EPSILON :Export( :MANDATORY ) = 0.00001;

           sub IMPORT {
               # This subroutine is called when the module is used (as usual),
               # but it is called after any export requests have been handled.
           };

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>NOTE:</b> This module is a fork of Perl6::Export::Attrs created to restore compatibility with
       Perl6::Export::Attrs version 0.0.3.

       Implements a Perl 5 native version of what the Perl 6 symbol export mechanism will look like (with some
       unavoidable restrictions).

       It's very straightforward:

       •   If  you  want  a  subroutine  or  package  variable  to be capable of being exported (when explicitly
           requested in the "use" arguments), you mark it with the ":Export" attribute.

       •   If you want a subroutine or package variable to be automatically exported when  the  module  is  used
           (without specific overriding arguments), you mark it with the ":Export(:DEFAULT)" attribute.

       •   If  you  want  a  subroutine or package variable to be automatically exported when the module is used
           (even if the user specifies  overriding  arguments),  you  mark  it  with  the  ":Export(:MANDATORY)"
           attribute.

       •   If  the  subroutine  or  package  variable  should also be exported when particular export groups are
           requested, you add the names of those export groups to the attribute's argument list.

       That's it.

   <b>"IMPORT"</b> <b>blocks</b>
       Perl 6 replaces the "import" subroutine with an "IMPORT" block. It's analogous  to  a  "BEGIN"  or  "END"
       block, except that it's executed every time the corresponding module is "use"'d.

       The  "IMPORT"  block  is  passed  the  argument list that was specified on the "use" line that loaded the
       corresponding module, minus the arguments that were used to specify exports.

       Note that, due to limitations in Perl 5, the "IMPORT" block provided by this module must be terminated by
       a semi-colon, unless it is the last statement in the file.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       %s does not export: %s\nuse %s failed
           You tried to import the specified subroutine or package variable, but the module  didn't  export  it.
           Often  caused  by a misspelling, or forgetting to add an ":Export" attribute to the definition of the
           subroutine or variable in question.

       Bad tagset in :Export attribute at %s line %s: [%s]
           You tried to import a collection of items via a tagset, but the module didn't export any  subroutines
           under that tagset. Is the tagset name misspelled (maybe you forgot the colon?).

       Can't export lexical %s variable at %s
           The  module  can  only  export  package  variables. You applied the ":Export" marker to a non-package
           variable (almost certainly to a lexical). Change the variable's "my" declarator to an "our".

       Can't export anonymous subroutine at %s
           Although you <u>can</u> apply the ":Export" marker to an anonymous subroutine, it rarely makes any sense  to
           do  so,  since  that  subroutine  can't  be  exported without a name to export it as. Either give the
           subroutine a name, or make sure it's aliased to a named  typeglob  at  compile-time  (or,  at  least,
           before it's exported).

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>AND</b> <b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       Export::Attrs requires no configuration files or environment variables.

</pre><h4><b>DEPENDENCIES</b></h4><pre>
       This module requires the Attribute::Handlers module to handle the attributes.

</pre><h4><b>INCOMPATIBILITIES</b></h4><pre>
       This  module  cannot  be  used  with  the  Memoize CPAN module, because memoization replaces the original
       subroutine with a wrapper. Because the ":Export" attribute is applied to the original (not the  wrapper),
       the memoized wrapper is not found by the exporter mechanism.

</pre><h4><b>LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Note that the module does not support exporting lexical variables, since there is no way for the exporter
       mechanism to determine the name of a lexical and hence to export it.

       Nor  does  this  module support the numerous addition export modes that Perl 6 offers, such as export-as-
       lexical or export-as-state.
