       package require <b>Tcl</b> <b>8.5</b> <b>9</b>

       package require <b>doctools::toc::export::html</b> <b>?0.2?</b>

       <b>export</b> <u>serial</u> <u>configuration</u>

________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This package implements the doctools table of contents export plugin for the generation of HTML markup.

       This  is an internal package of doctools, for use by the higher level management packages handling tables
       of contents, especially <b>doctools::toc::export</b>, the export manager.

       Using it from a regular interpreter is possible, however only with contortions, and is  not  recommended.
       The  proper  way  to  use  this functionality is through the package <b>doctools::toc::export</b> and the export
       manager objects it provides.

</pre><h4><b>API</b></h4><pre>
       The API provided by this package satisfies the specification of the doctoc export plugin API version 2.

       <b>export</b> <u>serial</u> <u>configuration</u>
              This command takes the canonical serialization of a table of contents, as specified in section <b>ToC</b>
              <b>serialization</b> <b>format</b>, and contained in <u>serial</u>, the <u>configuration</u>, a dictionary, and generates HTML
              markup encoding the table.  The created string is then returned as the result of the command.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       The html export plugin recognizes the following configuration variables and changes its behaviour as they
       specify.

       string <u>user</u>
              This standard configuration variable contains the name of  the  user  running  the  process  which
              invoked  the  export  plugin.  The plugin puts this information into the provenance comment at the
              beginning of the generated document.

       string <u>file</u>
              This standard configuration variable contains the name of the file  the  table  of  contents  came
              from. This variable may not be set or contain the empty string.  The plugin puts this information,
              if defined, i.e. set and not the empty string, into the provenance comment at the beginning of the
              generated document.

       dictionary <u>map</u>
              This  standard  configuration  variable contains a dictionary mapping from the (symbolic) document
              ids in reference entries to the actual filenames and/or urls to be used in the output.

              Document ids without a mapping are used unchanged.

       boolean <u>newlines</u>
              If this flag is set the plugin will break the generated html code across lines, with  each  markup
              command on a separate line.

              If  this  flag is not set (the default), the whole document will be written on a single line, with
              minimum spacing between all elements.

       boolean <u>indented</u>
              If this flag is set the plugin will indent the markup  commands  according  to  the  structure  of
              indices. To make this work this also implies that <b>newlines</b> is set.

              If  this  flag is not set (the default), the output is formatted as per the value of <b>newlines</b>, and
              no indenting is done.

       string <u>meta</u>
              This variable is meant to hold a fragment of HTML (default: empty).  The fragment it contains will
              be inserted into the generated output in the &lt;head&gt;  section  of  the  document,  just  after  the
              &lt;title&gt; tag.

       string <u>header</u>
              This variable is meant to hold a fragment of HTML (default: empty).  The fragment it contains will
              be  inserted  into the generated output just after the &lt;h1&gt; title tag in the body of the document,
              in the class.header &lt;div&gt;'ision.

       string <u>footer</u>
              This variable is meant to hold a fragment of HTML (default: empty). The fragment it contains  will
              be  inserted  into  the  generated  output  just  before  the  &lt;/body&gt;  tag,  in  the class.footer
              &lt;div&gt;'ision.

       dictionary <u>rid</u>
              The value of this variable (default: empty) maps references to the identifiers  to  use  as  their
              anchor  names.  Each reference <b>FOO</b> not found in the dictionary uses <b>REF-FOO</b> as anchor, i.e. itself
              prefixed with the string <b>REF-</b>.

       string <u>sepline</u>
              The value of this variable is the string to use for  the  separator  comments  inserted  into  the
              output  when the outpout is broken across lines and/or indented. The default string consists of 60
              dashes.

       string <u>class.main</u>
              This variable contains the class name for the main &lt;div&gt;'ivision of the  generated  document.  The
              default is <b>doctools</b>.

       string <u>class.header</u>
              This  variable  contains  the class name for the header &lt;div&gt;'ision of the generated document. The
              default is <b>toc-header</b>.  This division contains the document title, the user specified  <b>header</b>,  if
              any, and a visible separator line.

       string <u>class.title</u>
              This  variable  contains the class name for the &lt;h1&gt; tag enclosing the document title. The default
              is <b>toc-title</b>.

       string <u>class.navsep</u>
              This variable contains the class name for the &lt;hr&gt; separators in the header and footer sections of
              the generated document. The default is <b>toc-navsep</b>.

       string <u>class.contents</u>
              This variable contains the class name for the XXXXX holding the keywords and their  references  in
              the generated document. The default is <b>toc-contents</b>.

       string <u>class.ref</u>
              This  variable  contains  the  class  name  for  the  table elements which are references to other
              documents. The default is <b>toc-ref</b>.

       string <u>class.div</u>
              This variable contains the class name for the table elements which are divisions. The  default  is
              <b>toc-div</b>.

       string <u>class.footer</u>
              This  variable  contains  the class name for the footer &lt;div&gt;'ision of the generated document. The
              default is <b>toc-footer</b>. This division contains  a  browser-visible  separator  line  and  the  user
              specified <b>footer</b>, if any.

       <u>Note</u> that this plugin ignores the standard configuration variable <b>format</b>, and its value.

</pre><h4><b>TOC</b> <b>SERIALIZATION</b> <b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
       Here  we specify the format used by the doctools v2 packages to serialize tables of contents as immutable
       values for transport, comparison, etc.

       We distinguish between <u>regular</u> and <u>canonical</u> serializations.  While a table of  contents  may  have  more
       than one regular serialization only exactly one of them will be <u>canonical</u>.

       regular serialization

              [1]    The serialization of any table of contents is a nested Tcl dictionary.

              [2]    This  dictionary  holds  a  single  key, <b>doctools::toc</b>, and its value. This value holds the
                     contents of the table of contents.

              [3]    The contents of the table of contents are a Tcl dictionary holding the title of  the  table
                     of contents, a label, and its elements. The relevant keys and their values are

                     <b>title</b>  The value is a string containing the title of the table of contents.

                     <b>label</b>  The value is a string containing a label for the table of contents.

                     <b>items</b>  The  value is a Tcl list holding the elements of the table, in the order they are to
                            be shown.

                            Each element is a Tcl list holding the type of the item,  and  its  description,  in
                            this  order. An alternative description would be that it is a Tcl dictionary holding
                            a single key, the item type, mapped to the item description.

                            The two legal item types and their descriptions are

                            <b>reference</b>
                                   This item describes a single entry in the table of  contents,  referencing  a
                                   single  document.  To this end its value is a Tcl dictionary containing an id
                                   for the referenced document, a label, and a longer textual description  which
                                   can be associated with the entry.  The relevant keys and their values are

                                   <b>id</b>     The  value  is  a  string containing the id of the document associated
                                          with the entry.

                                   <b>label</b>  The value is a string containing a label for this entry.  This  string
                                          also  identifies  the  entry,  and  no  two  entries  (references  and
                                          divisions) in the containing list are allowed to have the same label.

                                   <b>desc</b>   The value is a string containing a longer description for this entry.

                            <b>division</b>
                                   This item describes a group of entries in the table of contents,  inducing  a
                                   hierarchy of entries.  To this end its value is a Tcl dictionary containing a
                                   label  for  the  group, an optional id to a document for the whole group, and
                                   the list of entries in the group.  The relevant keys and their values are

                                   <b>id</b>     The value is a string containing the id  of  the  document  associated
                                          with the whole group. This key is optional.

                                   <b>label</b>  The  value  is  a string containing a label for the group. This string
                                          also  identifies  the  entry,  and  no  two  entries  (references  and
                                          divisions) in the containing list are allowed to have the same label.

                                   <b>items</b>  The  value  is  a  Tcl  list holding the elements of the group, in the
                                          order they are to be shown.  This list has the same structure  as  the
                                          value  for  the  keyword  <b>items</b>  used  to  describe the whole table of
                                          contents, see above. This  closes  the  recusrive  definition  of  the
                                          structure,  with  divisions  holding  the same type of elements as the
                                          whole table of contents, including other divisions.

       canonical serialization
              The canonical serialization of a table of contents has the format as  specified  in  the  previous
              item,  and  then  additionally satisfies the constraints below, which make it unique among all the
              possible serializations of this table of contents.

              [1]    The keys found in all the nested Tcl dictionaries are sorted in ascending dictionary order,
                     as generated by Tcl's builtin command <b>lsort</b> <b>-increasing</b> <b>-dict</b>.
