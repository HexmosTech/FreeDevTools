       doctools::idx::export::docidx - docidx export plugin

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       package require <b>Tcl</b> <b>8.5</b> <b>9</b>

       package require <b>doctools::idx::export::docidx</b> <b>?0.2.2?</b>

       <b>export</b> <u>serial</u> <u>configuration</u>

________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This package implements the doctools keyword index export plugin for the generation of docidx markup.

       This is an internal package of doctools, for use by the higher level management packages handling keyword
       indices, especially <b>doctools::idx::export</b>, the export manager.

       Using  it  from a regular interpreter is possible, however only with contortions, and is not recommended.
       The proper way to use this functionality is through the  package  <b>doctools::idx::export</b>  and  the  export
       manager objects it provides.

</pre><h4><b>API</b></h4><pre>
       The API provided by this package satisfies the specification of the docidx export plugin API version 2.

       <b>export</b> <u>serial</u> <u>configuration</u>
              This command takes the canonical serialization of a keyword index, as specified in section <b>Keyword</b>
              <b>index</b>  <b>serialization</b>  <b>format</b>,  and  contained  in  <u>serial</u>,  the  <u>configuration</u>,  a dictionary, and
              generates docidx markup encoding the index.  The created string is then returned as the result  of
              the command.

</pre><h4><b>[DOCIDX]</b> <b>NOTATION</b> <b>OF</b> <b>KEYWORD</b> <b>INDICES</b></h4><pre>
       The docidx format for keyword indices, also called the <u>docidx</u> <u>markup</u> <u>language</u>, is too large to be covered
       in single section.  The interested reader should start with the document

       [1]    <u>docidx</u> <u>language</u> <u>introduction</u>

       and then proceed from there to the formal specifications, i.e. the documents

       [1]    <u>docidx</u> <u>language</u> <u>syntax</u> and

       [2]    <u>docidx</u> <u>language</u> <u>command</u> <u>reference</u>.

       to get a thorough understanding of the language.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       The  docidx  export  plugin recognizes the following configuration variables and changes its behaviour as
       they specify.

       string <u>user</u>
              This standard configuration variable contains the name of  the  user  running  the  process  which
              invoked  the  export  plugin.  The plugin puts this information into the provenance comment at the
              beginning of the generated document.

       string <u>file</u>
              This standard configuration variable contains the name of the  file  the  index  came  from.  This
              variable  may  not  be  set  or  contain  the  empty string.  The plugin puts this information, if
              defined, i.e. set and not the empty string, into the provenance comment at the  beginning  of  the
              generated document.

       boolean <u>newlines</u>
              If this flag is set the plugin will break the generated docidx code across lines, with each markup
              command on a separate line.

              If  this  flag is not set (the default), the whole document will be written on a single line, with
              minimum spacing between all elements.

       boolean <u>indented</u>
              If this flag is set the plugin will indent the markup  commands  according  to  the  structure  of
              indices.  To  make this work this also implies that <b>newlines</b> is set. This effect is independent of
              the value for <b>aligned</b> however.

              If this flag is not set (the default), the output is formatted as per the values of  <b>newlines</b>  and
              <b>aligned</b>, and no indenting is done.

       boolean <u>aligned</u>
              If this flag is set the generator ensures that the arguments for the <b>manpage</b> and <b>url</b> commands in a
              keyword  section  are  aligned  vertically  for  a  nice table effect. To make this work this also
              implies that <b>newlines</b> is set. This effect is independent of the value for <b>indented</b> however.

              If this flag is not set (the default), the output is formatted as per the values of  <b>newlines</b>  and
              <b>indented</b>, and no alignment is done.

       <u>Note</u> that this plugin ignores the standard configuration variables <b>format</b>, and <b>map</b>, and their values.

</pre><h4><b>KEYWORD</b> <b>INDEX</b> <b>SERIALIZATION</b> <b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
       Here  we  specify  the  format used by the doctools v2 packages to serialize keyword indices as immutable
       values for transport, comparison, etc.

       We distinguish between <u>regular</u> and <u>canonical</u> serializations. While a keyword index may have more than one
       regular serialization only exactly one of them will be <u>canonical</u>.

       regular serialization

              [1]    An index serialization is a nested Tcl dictionary.

              [2]    This dictionary holds a single key, <b>doctools::idx</b>, and its  value.  This  value  holds  the
                     contents of the index.

              [3]    The contents of the index are a Tcl dictionary holding the title of the index, a label, and
                     the keywords and references. The relevant keys and their values are

                     <b>title</b>  The value is a string containing the title of the index.

                     <b>label</b>  The value is a string containing a label for the index.

                     <b>keywords</b>
                            The  value  is  a Tcl dictionary, using the keywords known to the index as keys. The
                            associated values are lists containing the identifiers of the references  associated
                            with that particular keyword.

                            Any reference identifier used in these lists has to exist as a key in the <b>references</b>
                            dictionary, see the next item for its definition.

                     <b>references</b>
                            The value is a Tcl dictionary, using the identifiers for the references known to the
                            index  as  keys.  The  associated values are 2-element lists containing the type and
                            label of the reference, in this order.

                            Any key here has to be associated with at least one keyword, i.e. occur in at  least
                            one  of  the  reference  lists  which are the values in the <b>keywords</b> dictionary, see
                            previous item for its definition.

              [4]    The <u>type</u> of a reference can be one of two values,

                     <b>manpage</b>
                            The identifier of the reference is interpreted as symbolic file name,  referring  to
                            one of the documents the index was made for.

                     <b>url</b>    The identifier of the reference is interpreted as an url, referring to some external
                            location, like a website, etc.

       canonical serialization
              The  canonical  serialization of a keyword index has the format as specified in the previous item,
              and then additionally satisfies the constraints below, which make it unique among all the possible
              serializations of the keyword index.

              [1]    The keys found in all the nested Tcl dictionaries are sorted in ascending dictionary order,
                     as generated by Tcl's builtin command <b>lsort</b> <b>-increasing</b> <b>-dict</b>.

              [2]    The references listed for each keyword of the  index,  if  any,  are  listed  in  ascending
                     dictionary  order  of their <u>labels</u>, as generated by Tcl's builtin command <b>lsort</b> <b>-increasing</b>
                     <b>-dict</b>.
