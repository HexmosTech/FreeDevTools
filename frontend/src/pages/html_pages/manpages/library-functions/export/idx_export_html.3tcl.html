       <b>export</b> <u>serial</u> <u>configuration</u>

________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This package implements the doctools keyword index export plugin for the generation of HTML markup.

       This is an internal package of doctools, for use by the higher level management packages handling keyword
       indices, especially <b>doctools::idx::export</b>, the export manager.

       Using  it  from a regular interpreter is possible, however only with contortions, and is not recommended.
       The proper way to use this functionality is through the  package  <b>doctools::idx::export</b>  and  the  export
       manager objects it provides.

</pre><h4><b>API</b></h4><pre>
       The API provided by this package satisfies the specification of the docidx export plugin API version 2.

       <b>export</b> <u>serial</u> <u>configuration</u>
              This command takes the canonical serialization of a keyword index, as specified in section <b>Keyword</b>
              <b>index</b>  <b>serialization</b>  <b>format</b>,  and  contained  in  <u>serial</u>,  the  <u>configuration</u>,  a dictionary, and
              generates HTML markup encoding the index.  The created string is then returned as  the  result  of
              the command.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       The html export plugin recognizes the following configuration variables and changes its behaviour as they
       specify.

       string <u>user</u>
              This  standard  configuration  variable  contains  the  name of the user running the process which
              invoked the export plugin.  The plugin puts this information into the provenance  comment  at  the
              beginning of the generated document.

       string <u>file</u>
              This  standard  configuration  variable  contains  the  name of the file the index came from. This
              variable may not be set or contain the  empty  string.   The  plugin  puts  this  information,  if
              defined,  i.e.  set  and not the empty string, into the provenance comment at the beginning of the
              generated document.

       dictionary <u>map</u>
              This standard configuration variable contains a dictionary mapping from the symbolic  files  names
              in manpage references to the actual filenames and/or urls to be used in the output.

              Url references and symbolic file names without a mapping are used unchanged.

       boolean <u>newlines</u>
              If  this  flag is set the plugin will break the generated html code across lines, with each markup
              command on a separate line.

              If this flag is not set (the default), the whole document will be written on a single  line,  with
              minimum spacing between all elements.

       boolean <u>indented</u>
              If  this  flag  is  set  the  plugin will indent the markup commands according to the structure of
              indices. To make this work this also implies that <b>newlines</b> is set.

              If this flag is not set (the default), the output is formatted as per the value of  <b>newlines</b>,  and
              no indenting is done.

       string <u>meta</u>
              This variable is meant to hold a fragment of HTML (default: empty).  The fragment it contains will
              be  inserted  into  the  generated  output  in  the &lt;head&gt; section of the document, just after the
              &lt;title&gt; tag.

       string <u>header</u>
              This variable is meant to hold a fragment of HTML (default: empty).  The fragment it contains will
              be inserted into the generated output just after the &lt;h1&gt; title tag in the body of  the  document,
              in the class.header &lt;div&gt;'ision.

       string <u>footer</u>
              This  variable is meant to hold a fragment of HTML (default: empty). The fragment it contains will
              be inserted  into  the  generated  output  just  before  the  &lt;/body&gt;  tag,  in  the  class.footer
              &lt;div&gt;'ision.

       dictionary <u>kwid</u>
              The  value  of  this  variable  (default:  empty) maps keywords to the identifiers to use as their
              anchor names. Each keyword <b>FOO</b> not found in the dictionary uses  <b>KW-FOO</b>  as  anchor,  i.e.  itself
              prefixed with the string <b>KW-</b>.

       string <u>sepline</u>
              The  value  of  this  variable  is  the string to use for the separator comments inserted into the
              output when the outpout is broken across lines and/or indented. The default string consists of  60
              dashes.

       integer <u>kwidth</u>
              This  variable  holds the size of the keyword column in the main table generated by the plugin, in
              percent of the total width of the table. This is an integer number  in  the  range  of  1  to  99.
              Choosing a value outside of that range causes the generator to switch back to the defauly setting,
              35 percent.

       string <u>dot</u>
              This variable contains a HTML fragment inserted between the entries of the navigation bar, and the
              references  associated  with  each keyword.  The default is the HTML entity &amp;#183; i.e. the bullet
              character, also known as the "Greek middle dot", i.e. the unicode character 00B7.

       string <u>class.main</u>
              This variable contains the class name for the main &lt;div&gt;'ivision of the  generated  document.  The
              default is <b>doctools</b>.

       string <u>class.header</u>
              This  variable  contains  the class name for the header &lt;div&gt;'ision of the generated document. The
              default is <b>idx-header</b>.  This division contains the document title, the user specified  <b>header</b>,  if
              any, a visible separator line, and the navigation bar for quick access to each keyword section.

       string <u>class.title</u>
              This  variable  contains the class name for the &lt;h1&gt; tag enclosing the document title. The default
              is <b>idx-title</b>.

       string <u>class.navsep</u>
              This variable contains the class name for the &lt;hr&gt; separators in the header and footer sections of
              the generated document. The default is <b>idx-navsep</b>.

       string <u>class.navbar</u>
              This variable contains the class name for the navigation &lt;div&gt;'ision enclosing the navigation  bar
              of the generated document. The default is <b>idx-kwnav</b>.

       string <u>class.contents</u>
              This variable contains the class name for the &lt;table&gt; holding the keywords and their references in
              the generated document. The default is <b>idx-contents</b>.

       string <u>class.leader</u>
              This  variable  contains  the  class name for the anchor names the plugin inserts into the keyword
              table when switching from one section to  the  next  (Each  section  holds  all  keywords  with  a
              particular first character). The default is <b>idx-leader</b>.

       string <u>class.row0</u>
              This variable contains the class name used to label the even rows (&lt;tr&gt;) of the keyword table. The
              default is <b>idx-even</b>.

       string <u>class.row1</u>
              This  variable contains the class name used to label the odd rows (&lt;tr&gt;) of the keyword table. The
              default is <b>idx-odd</b>.

       string <u>class.keyword</u>
              This variable contains the class name used to label the keyword cells/column (&lt;td&gt;) in the keyword
              table of the document. The default is <b>idx-keyword</b>.

       string <u>class.refs</u>
              This variable contains the class name used to label  the  reference  cells/column  (&lt;td&gt;)  in  the
              keyword table of the document. The default is <b>idx-refs</b>.

       string <u>class.footer</u>
              This  variable  contains  the class name for the footer &lt;div&gt;'ision of the generated document. The
              default is <b>idx-footer</b>. This division contains  a  browser-visible  separator  line  and  the  user
              specified <b>footer</b>, if any.

       <u>Note</u> that this plugin ignores the standard configuration variable <b>format</b>, and its value.

</pre><h4><b>KEYWORD</b> <b>INDEX</b> <b>SERIALIZATION</b> <b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
       Here  we  specify  the  format used by the doctools v2 packages to serialize keyword indices as immutable
       values for transport, comparison, etc.

       We distinguish between <u>regular</u> and <u>canonical</u> serializations. While a keyword index may have more than one
       regular serialization only exactly one of them will be <u>canonical</u>.

       regular serialization

              [1]    An index serialization is a nested Tcl dictionary.

              [2]    This dictionary holds a single key, <b>doctools::idx</b>, and its  value.  This  value  holds  the
                     contents of the index.

              [3]    The contents of the index are a Tcl dictionary holding the title of the index, a label, and
                     the keywords and references. The relevant keys and their values are

                     <b>title</b>  The value is a string containing the title of the index.

                     <b>label</b>  The value is a string containing a label for the index.

                     <b>keywords</b>
                            The  value  is  a Tcl dictionary, using the keywords known to the index as keys. The
                            associated values are lists containing the identifiers of the references  associated
                            with that particular keyword.

                            Any reference identifier used in these lists has to exist as a key in the <b>references</b>
                            dictionary, see the next item for its definition.

                     <b>references</b>
                            The value is a Tcl dictionary, using the identifiers for the references known to the
                            index  as  keys.  The  associated values are 2-element lists containing the type and
                            label of the reference, in this order.

                            Any key here has to be associated with at least one keyword, i.e. occur in at  least
                            one  of  the  reference  lists  which are the values in the <b>keywords</b> dictionary, see
                            previous item for its definition.

              [4]    The <u>type</u> of a reference can be one of two values,

                     <b>manpage</b>
                            The identifier of the reference is interpreted as symbolic file name,  referring  to
                            one of the documents the index was made for.

                     <b>url</b>    The identifier of the reference is interpreted as an url, referring to some external
                            location, like a website, etc.

       canonical serialization
              The  canonical  serialization of a keyword index has the format as specified in the previous item,
              and then additionally satisfies the constraints below, which make it unique among all the possible
              serializations of the keyword index.

              [1]    The keys found in all the nested Tcl dictionaries are sorted in ascending dictionary order,
                     as generated by Tcl's builtin command <b>lsort</b> <b>-increasing</b> <b>-dict</b>.

              [2]    The references listed for each keyword of the  index,  if  any,  are  listed  in  ascending
                     dictionary  order  of their <u>labels</u>, as generated by Tcl's builtin command <b>lsort</b> <b>-increasing</b>
                     <b>-dict</b>.
