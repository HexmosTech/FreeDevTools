       doctools::toc::export::text - plain text export plugin

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       package require <b>Tcl</b> <b>8.5</b> <b>9</b>

       package require <b>doctools::toc::export::text</b> <b>?0.2?</b>

       package require <b>doctools::text</b>

________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  package  implements  the  doctools table of contents export plugin for the generation of plain text
       markup.

       This is an internal package of doctools, for use by the higher level management packages handling  tables
       of contents, especially <b>doctools::toc::export</b>, the export manager.

       Using  it  from a regular interpreter is possible, however only with contortions, and is not recommended.
       The proper way to use this functionality is through the  package  <b>doctools::toc::export</b>  and  the  export
       manager objects it provides.

</pre><h4><b>API</b></h4><pre>
       The API provided by this package satisfies the specification of the doctoc export plugin API version 2.

       <b>export</b> <u>serial</u> <u>configuration</u>
              This command takes the canonical serialization of a table of contents, as specified in section <b>ToC</b>
              <b>serialization</b>  <b>format</b>,  and  contained  in  <u>serial</u>, the <u>configuration</u>, a dictionary, and generates
              plain text markup encoding the table.  The created string is then returned as the  result  of  the
              command.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       The text export plugin recognizes the following configuration variables and changes its behaviour as they
       specify.

       dictionary <u>map</u>
              This  standard  configuration  variable contains a dictionary mapping from the (symbolic) document
              ids in reference entries to the actual filenames and/or urls to be used in the output.

              Document ids without a mapping are used unchanged.

       <u>Note</u> that this plugin ignores the standard configuration variables <b>user</b>,  <b>file</b>,  and  <b>format</b>,  and  their
       values.

</pre><h4><b>TOC</b> <b>SERIALIZATION</b> <b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
       Here  we specify the format used by the doctools v2 packages to serialize tables of contents as immutable
       values for transport, comparison, etc.

       We distinguish between <u>regular</u> and <u>canonical</u> serializations.  While a table of  contents  may  have  more
       than one regular serialization only exactly one of them will be <u>canonical</u>.

       regular serialization

              [1]    The serialization of any table of contents is a nested Tcl dictionary.

              [2]    This  dictionary  holds  a  single  key, <b>doctools::toc</b>, and its value. This value holds the
                     contents of the table of contents.

              [3]    The contents of the table of contents are a Tcl dictionary holding the title of  the  table
                     of contents, a label, and its elements. The relevant keys and their values are

                     <b>title</b>  The value is a string containing the title of the table of contents.

                     <b>label</b>  The value is a string containing a label for the table of contents.

                     <b>items</b>  The  value is a Tcl list holding the elements of the table, in the order they are to
                            be shown.

                            Each element is a Tcl list holding the type of the item,  and  its  description,  in
                            this  order. An alternative description would be that it is a Tcl dictionary holding
                            a single key, the item type, mapped to the item description.

                            The two legal item types and their descriptions are

                            <b>reference</b>
                                   This item describes a single entry in the table of  contents,  referencing  a
                                   single  document.  To this end its value is a Tcl dictionary containing an id
                                   for the referenced document, a label, and a longer textual description  which
                                   can be associated with the entry.  The relevant keys and their values are

                                   <b>id</b>     The  value  is  a  string containing the id of the document associated
                                          with the entry.

                                   <b>label</b>  The value is a string containing a label for this entry.  This  string
                                          also  identifies  the  entry,  and  no  two  entries  (references  and
                                          divisions) in the containing list are allowed to have the same label.

                                   <b>desc</b>   The value is a string containing a longer description for this entry.

                            <b>division</b>
                                   This item describes a group of entries in the table of contents,  inducing  a
                                   hierarchy of entries.  To this end its value is a Tcl dictionary containing a
                                   label  for  the  group, an optional id to a document for the whole group, and
                                   the list of entries in the group.  The relevant keys and their values are

                                   <b>id</b>     The value is a string containing the id  of  the  document  associated
                                          with the whole group. This key is optional.

                                   <b>label</b>  The  value  is  a string containing a label for the group. This string
                                          also  identifies  the  entry,  and  no  two  entries  (references  and
                                          divisions) in the containing list are allowed to have the same label.

                                   <b>items</b>  The  value  is  a  Tcl  list holding the elements of the group, in the
                                          order they are to be shown.  This list has the same structure  as  the
                                          value  for  the  keyword  <b>items</b>  used  to  describe the whole table of
                                          contents, see above. This  closes  the  recusrive  definition  of  the
                                          structure,  with  divisions  holding  the same type of elements as the
                                          whole table of contents, including other divisions.

       canonical serialization
              The canonical serialization of a table of contents has the format as  specified  in  the  previous
              item,  and  then  additionally satisfies the constraints below, which make it unique among all the
              possible serializations of this table of contents.

              [1]    The keys found in all the nested Tcl dictionaries are sorted in ascending dictionary order,
                     as generated by Tcl's builtin command <b>lsort</b> <b>-increasing</b> <b>-dict</b>.
