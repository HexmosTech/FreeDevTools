</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Perl6::Export - Implements the Perl 6 'is export(...)' trait

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           # Perl 5 code...

           package Some::Module;
           use Perl6::Export;

           # Export &amp;foo by default, when explicitly requested,
           # or when the ':ALL' export set is requested...

           sub foo is export(:DEFAULT) {
               print "phooo!";
           }

           # Export &amp;bar by default, when explicitly requested,
           # or when the ':bees', ':pubs', or ':ALL' export set is requested...
           # the parens after 'is export' are like the parens of a qw(...)

           sub bar is export(:DEFAULT :bees :pubs) {
               print "baaa!";
           }

           # Export &amp;baz when explicitly requested
           # or when the ':bees' or ':ALL' export set is requested...

           sub baz is export(:bees) {
               print "baassss!";
           }

           # Always export &amp;qux
           # (no matter what else is explicitly or implicitly requested)

           sub qux is export(:MANDATORY) {
               print "quuuuuuuuux!";
           }

           IMPORT {
               # This block is called when the module is used (as usual),
               # but it is called after any export requests have been handled.
               # Those requests will have been stripped from its @_ argument list
           }

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Implements what I hope the Perl 6 symbol export mechanism might look like.

       It's very straightforward:

       •   If  you  want  a  subroutine  to be capable of being exported (when explicitly requested in the "use"
           arguments), you mark it with the "is export" trait.

       •   If you want a subroutine to be automatically exported when  the  module  is  used  (without  specific
           overriding arguments), you mark it with the "is export(:DEFAULT)" trait.

       •   If  you  want  a  subroutine  to  be automatically exported when the module is used (even if the user
           specifies overriding arguments), you mark it with the "is export(:MANDATORY)" trait.

       •   If the subroutine should also be exported when particular export groups are requested,  you  add  the
           names of those export groups to the trait's argument list.

       That's it.

   <b>"IMPORT"</b> <b>blocks</b>
       Perl  6  replaces  the  "import"  subroutine with an "IMPORT" block. It's analogous to a "BEGIN" or "END"
       block, except that it's executed every time the corresponding module is "use"'d.

       Perl6::Export honours either the Perl5-ish:

           sub import {...}

       or the equivalent Perl6-ish:

           IMPORT {...}

       In either case the subroutine/block is passed the argument list that was specified on the "use" line that
       loaded the corresponding module. However, any export specifications (names of subroutines or  tagsets  to
       be exported) will have already been removed from that argument list before "import"/"IMPORT" receives it.

</pre><h4><b>WARNING</b></h4><pre>
       The  syntax  and  semantics of Perl 6 is still being finalized and consequently is at any time subject to
       change. That means the same caveat applies to this module.

</pre><h4><b>DEPENDENCIES</b></h4><pre>
       Requires Filter::Simple

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>IRRITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Does not yet handle the export of variables.  The author personally believes this is  a  feature,  rather
       than a bug.

       Comments, suggestions, and patches welcome.
