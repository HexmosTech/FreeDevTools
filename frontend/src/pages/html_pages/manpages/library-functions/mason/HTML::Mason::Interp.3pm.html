</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       HTML::Mason::Interp - Mason Component Interpreter

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           my $i = HTML::Mason::Interp-&gt;new (data_dir=&gt;'/usr/local/mason',
                                             comp_root=&gt;'/usr/local/www/htdocs/',
                                             ...other params...);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Interp is the Mason workhorse, executing components and routing their output and errors to all the right
       places. In a mod_perl environment, Interp objects are handed off immediately to an ApacheHandler object
       which internally calls the Interp implementation methods. In that case the only user method is the <b>new()</b>
       constructor.

</pre><h4><b>PARAMETERS</b> <b>TO</b> <b>THE</b> <b>new()</b> <b>CONSTRUCTOR</b></h4><pre>
       autohandler_name
           File  name  used  for autohandlers. Default is "autohandler".  If this is set to an empty string ("")
           then autohandlers are turned off entirely.

       buffer_preallocate_size
           Number of bytes to preallocate in the output buffer for each request.  Defaults to  0.  Setting  this
           to, say, your maximum page size (or close to it) can reduce the number of reallocations Perl performs
           as components add to the output buffer.

       code_cache_max_size
           Specifies  the  maximum  number  of  components  that should be held in the in-memory code cache. The
           default is 'unlimited', meaning no components will ever  be  discarded;  Mason  can  perform  certain
           optimizations in this mode. Setting this to zero disables the code cache entirely. See the code cache
           section of the administrator's manual for further details.

       comp_root
           The  component  root  marks  the  top of your component hierarchy and defines how component paths are
           translated into real file paths. For example, if your  component  root  is  <u>/usr/local/httpd/docs</u>,  a
           component       path       of       <u>/products/index.html</u>       translates       to      the      file
           <u>/usr/local/httpd/docs/products/index.html</u>.

           Under Apache and CGI, comp_root defaults to the server's document root. In standalone mode  comp_root
           defaults to the current working directory.

           This  parameter  may  be  either  a  scalar or an array reference.  If it is a scalar, it should be a
           filesystem path indicating the component root. If it is an array  reference,  it  should  be  of  the
           following form:

            [ [ foo =&gt; '/usr/local/foo' ],
              [ bar =&gt; '/usr/local/bar' ] ]

           This  is  an  array  of  two-element  array references, not a hash.  The "keys" for each path must be
           unique and their "values" must be filesystem paths.  These paths will be  searched  in  the  provided
           order  whenever  a  component  path  is  resolved. For example, given the above component roots and a
           component     path     of     <u>/products/index.html</u>,     Mason     would     search     first      for
           <u>/usr/local/foo/products/index.html</u>, then for <u>/usr/local/bar/products/index.html</u>.

           The keys are used in several ways. They help to distinguish component caches and object files between
           different component roots, and they appear in the title() of a component.

           When you specify a single path for a component root, this is actually translated into

             [ [ MAIN =&gt; path ] ]

           If  you  have  turned  on  dynamic_comp_root,  you may modify the component root(s) of an interpreter
           between requests by calling "$interp-&gt;comp_root" with a value. However, the path associated with  any
           given key may not change between requests. For example, if the initial component root is

            [ [ foo =&gt; '/usr/local/foo' ],
              [ bar =&gt; '/usr/local/bar' ], ]

           then it may not be changed to

            [ [ foo =&gt; '/usr/local/bar' ],
              [ bar =&gt; '/usr/local/baz' ],

           but it may be changed to

            [ [ foo   =&gt; '/usr/local/foo' ],
              [ blarg =&gt; '/usr/local/blarg' ] ]

           In  other  words,  you may add or remove key/path pairs but not modify an already-used key/path pair.
           The reason for this restriction is that the interpreter maintains a  component  cache  per  key  that
           would become invalid if the associated paths were to change.

       compiler
           The  Compiler  object  to  associate  with  this  Interpreter.   By  default  a  new  object of class
           compiler_class will be created.

       compiler_class
           The class to use when creating a compiler. Defaults to HTML::Mason::Compiler.

       data_dir
           The data directory is a writable directory that Mason uses for various  features  and  optimizations:
           for example, component object files and data cache files. Mason will create the directory on startup,
           if necessary, and set its permissions according to the web server User/Group.

           Under  Apache, data_dir defaults to a directory called "mason" under the Apache server root. You will
           need to change this on certain systems that assign a high-level server root such as <u><a href="file:/usr">/usr</a></u>!

           In non-Apache environments, data_dir has no default. If it is left unspecified, Mason  will  not  use
           object files, and the default data cache class will be "MemoryCache" instead of "FileCache".

       dynamic_comp_root
           True or false, defaults to false. Indicates whether the comp_root can be modified on this interpreter
           between  requests.  Mason  can perform a few optimizations with a fixed component root, so you should
           only set this to true if you actually need it.

       escape_flags
           A hash reference of escape flags to set for this object.  See the section on  the  set_escape  method
           for more details.

       ignore_warnings_expr
           Regular  expression  indicating which warnings to ignore when loading components. Any warning that is
           not ignored will prevent the component from being loaded and executed. For example:

               ignore_warnings_expr =&gt;
                   'Global symbol.*requires explicit package'

           If set to undef, all warnings are heeded. If set to '.', warnings are  turned  off  completely  as  a
           specially optimized case.

           By  default, this is set to 'Subroutine .* redefined'.  This allows you to declare global subroutines
           inside &lt;%once&gt; sections and not receive an error when the component is reloaded.

       object_file_extension
           Extension to add to the end of object files. Default is ".obj".

       preloads
           A list of component paths, optionally with glob wildcards, to load when the interpreter  initializes.
           e.g.

               preloads =&gt; ['/foo/index.html','/bar/*.pl']

           Default is the empty list.  For maximum performance, this should only be used for components that are
           frequently  viewed  and rarely updated.  See the preloading components section of the administrator's
           manual for further details.

           As mentioned in the developer's manual, a component's  "&lt;%once&gt;"  section  is  executed  when  it  is
           loaded.   For  preloaded  components, this means that this section will be executed before a Mason or
           Apache request exist, so preloading a component that uses $m or $r in a "&lt;%once&gt;" section will fail.

       request_class
           The class to use when creating requests. Defaults to HTML::Mason::Request.

       resolver
           The Resolver object to associate with this Compiler. By default a new object of class  resolver_class
           will be created.

       resolver_class
           The class to use when creating a resolver. Defaults to HTML::Mason::Resolver::File.

       static_source
           True  or false, default is false. When false, Mason checks the timestamp of the component source file
           each time the component is used to see if it has changed. This  provides  the  instant  feedback  for
           source  changes  that  is  expected  for  development.   However  it does entail a file stat for each
           component executed.

           When true, Mason assumes that the component source tree is unchanging: it will  not  check  component
           source  files  to  determine if the memory cache or object file has expired.  This can save many file
           stats per request. However, in order to get Mason to recognize a component source  change,  you  must
           flush  the  memory  cache  and remove object files.  See static_source_touch_file for one easy way to
           arrange this.

           We recommend turning this mode on in your production sites if possible,  if  performance  is  of  any
           concern.

       static_source_touch_file
           Specifies  a  filename that Mason will check once at the beginning of of every request. When the file
           timestamp changes, Mason will (1) clear its in-memory component cache, and (2) remove object files if
           they have not already been deleted by another process.

           This provides a convenient way to implement static_source mode.  All you need to do is make sure that
           a single file gets touched whenever components change. For Mason's part, checking a  single  file  at
           the beginning of a request is much cheaper than checking every component file when static_source=0.

       use_object_files
           True  or false, default is true.  Specifies whether Mason creates object files to save the results of
           component parsing. You may want to turn off object files for disk space reasons, but  otherwise  this
           should be left alone.

</pre><h4><b>ACCESSOR</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       All  of  the  above  properties  have  standard  accessor  methods  of  the same name. Only comp_root and
       ignore_warnings_expr can be modified in an existing interpreter; the rest are read-only.

</pre><h4><b>ESCAPE</b> <b>FLAG</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       apply_escapes ($text, $flags, [more flags...])
           This method applies a one or more escapes to a piece of text.  The escapes are  specified  by  giving
           their  flag.   Each  escape  is  applied  to  the  text in turn, after which the now-modified text is
           returned.

       remove_escape ($name)
           Given an escape name, this removes that escape from the interpreter's known escapes.  If the name  is
           not recognized, it is simply ignored.

       set_escape ($name =&gt; see below])
           This  method  is  called to add an escape flag to the list of known escapes for the interpreter.  The
           flag may only consist of the characters matching "\w" and the dash (-).  It must start with an  alpha
           character or an underscore (_).

           The  right hand side may be one of several things.  It can be a subroutine reference.  It can also be
           a string match "/^\w+$/", in which case it is  assumed  to  be  the  name  of  a  subroutine  in  the
           "HTML::Mason::Escapes"  module.  Finally, if it is a string that does not match the above regex, then
           it is assumed to be "eval"able code, which will return a subroutine reference.

           When setting these with "PerlSetVar" directives in an Apache configuration file,  you  can  set  them
           like this:

             PerlSetVar  MasonEscapeFlags  "h =&gt; \&amp;HTML::Mason::Escapes::basic_html_escape"
             PerlSetVar  MasonEscapeFlags  "flag  =&gt; \&amp;subroutine"
             PerlSetVar  MasonEscapeFlags  "uc    =&gt; sub { ${$_[0]} = uc ${$_[0]}; }"
             PerlAddVar  MasonEscapeFlags  "thing =&gt; other_thing"

</pre><h4><b>OTHER</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       comp_exists (path)
           Given  an  <u>absolute</u>  component  path, this method returns a boolean value indicating whether or not a
           component exists for that path.

       exec (comp, args...)
           Creates a new HTML::Mason::Request object for the given <u>comp</u> and <u>args</u>, and executes  it.  The  return
           value is the return value of <u>comp</u>, if any.

           This  is  useful  for running Mason outside of a web environment.  See "using Mason from a standalone
           script" in HTML::Mason::Admin for examples.

           This method isn't generally useful in a mod_perl environment; see subrequests instead.

       flush_code_cache
           Empties the component cache. When using Perl 5.00503 or earlier, you should call this  when  finished
           with  an  interpreter, in order to remove circular references that would prevent the interpreter from
           being destroyed.

       load (path)
           Returns the component object corresponding to an absolute component "path", or undef if none  exists.
           Dies with an error if the component fails to load because of a syntax error.

       make_component (comp_source =&gt; ... )
       make_component (comp_file =&gt; ... )
           This  method  compiles Mason component source code and returns a Component object.  The source may be
           passed in as a string in "comp_source", or as a filename in "comp_file".  When using "comp_file", the
           filename is specified as a path on the file system, not as a path relative to Mason's component  root
           (see $m-&gt;fetch_comp for that).

           If Mason encounters an error during processing, an exception will be thrown.

           Example of usage:

               # Make an anonymous component
               my $anon_comp =
                 eval { $interp-&gt;make_component
                          ( comp_source =&gt; '&lt;%perl&gt;my $name = "World";&lt;/%perl&gt;Hello &lt;% $name %&gt;!' ) };
               die $@ if $@;

               $m-&gt;comp($anon_comp);

       make_request (@request_params)
           This  method creates a Mason request object. The arguments to be passed are the same as those for the
           "HTML::Mason::Request-&gt;new" constructor or its relevant subclass. This method will likely only be  of
           interest to those attempting to write new handlers or to subclass "HTML::Mason::Interp".  If you want
           to create a <u>subrequest</u>, see subrequests instead.

       purge_code_cache ()
           Called  during  request  execution  in order to clear out the code cache. Mainly useful to subclasses
           that may want to take some custom action upon clearing the cache.

       set_global ($varname, [values...])
           This method sets a global to be used in components. "varname" is a variable name, optionally preceded
           with a prefix ("$", "@", or "%"); if the prefix is omitted then "$" is assumed. "varname" is followed
           by a value, in the case of a scalar, or by one or more values in the case of a  list  or  hash.   For
           example:

               # Set a global variable $dbh containing the database handle
               $interp-&gt;set_global(dbh =&gt; DBI-&gt;connect(...));

               # Set a global hash %session from a local hash
               $interp-&gt;set_global('%session', %s);

           The  global  is  set in the package that components run in: usually "HTML::Mason::Commands", although
           this can be overridden via the in_package parameter.  The lines above, for  example,  are  equivalent
           to:

               $HTML::Mason::Commands::dbh = DBI-&gt;connect(...);
               %HTML::Mason::Commands::session = %s;

           assuming that in_package has not been changed.

           Any  global that you set should also be registered with the allow_globals parameter; otherwise you'll
           get warnings from "strict".
