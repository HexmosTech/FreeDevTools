</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       HTML::Mason::Params - Mason configuration parameters

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This document lists all of the Mason configuration parameters that are intended to be used by end users.

</pre><h4><b>PERL</b> <b>AND</b> <b>APACHE</b> <b>NAMES</b></h4><pre>
       Each parameter has two names: a Perl version and an Apache version.  The Perl version uses
       "lowercase_with_underscores", while the Apache version uses "StudlyCaps" with a "Mason" prefix. The
       conversion from one version to the other is otherwise very predictable. For example,

       •   "autohandler_name" "&lt;--&gt;" "MasonAutohandlerName"

       •   "comp_root" "&lt;--&gt;" "MasonCompRoot"

       •   "data_cache_defaults" "&lt;--&gt;" "MasonDataCacheDefaults"

   <b>Where</b> <b>Apache</b> <b>Names</b> <b>Are</b> <b>Used</b>
       The Apache parameter names are used in the Apache configuration file in an httpd-based configuration.

   <b>Where</b> <b>Perl</b> <b>Names</b> <b>Are</b> <b>Used</b>
       The Perl parameter names are used from Perl code, i.e. anywhere other than the Apache configuration file.
       For example,

       •   In  an custom wrapper-based configuration, you can pass most of these parameters to the ApacheHandler
           constructor.

       •   In a standalone Mason script, you can pass most of these parameters to the Interp constructor.

       •   When  launching  a  subrequest,  you  can  pass  any  of  the  "HTML::Mason::Request"  parameters  to
           make_subrequest.

</pre><h4><b>PARAMETERS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>allow_globals</b>
       •   Perl name:           allow_globals

       •   Apache name:         MasonAllowGlobals

       •   Type in httpd.conf:  list

       •   Default:             []

       •   Belongs to:          "HTML::Mason::Compiler"

       List  of  variable  names, complete with prefix ("$@%"), that you intend to use as globals in components.
       Normally global variables are forbidden by "strict", but any variable mentioned in this list is granted a
       reprieve via a "use vars" statement. For example:

           allow_globals =&gt; [qw($DBH %session)]

       In a mod_perl environment, $r (the request object) is automatically added to this list.

   <b>apache_status_title</b>
       •   Perl name:           apache_status_title

       •   Apache name:         MasonApacheStatusTitle

       •   Type in httpd.conf:  string

       •   Default:             HTML::Mason status

       •   Belongs to:          "HTML::Mason::ApacheHandler"

       Title that you want this ApacheHandler to  appear  as  under  Apache::Status.   Default  is  "HTML::Mason
       status".   This  is useful if you create more than one ApacheHandler object and want them all visible via
       Apache::Status.

   <b>args_method</b>
       •   Perl name:           args_method

       •   Apache name:         MasonArgsMethod

       •   Type in httpd.conf:  string

       •   Default:             mod_perl

       •   Belongs to:          "HTML::Mason::ApacheHandler"

       Method to use for unpacking GET and POST arguments. The valid options are  'CGI'  and  'mod_perl';  these
       indicate  that  a "CGI.pm" or "Apache::Request" object (respectively) will be created for the purposes of
       argument handling.

       'mod_perl' is the default under mod_perl-1 and requires that you  have  installed  the  "Apache::Request"
       package.  Under mod_perl-2, the default is 'CGI' because "Apache2::Request" is still in development.

       If  args_method  is  'mod_perl',  the  $r  global  is  upgraded to an Apache::Request object. This object
       inherits all Apache methods and adds a few of its own, dealing with parameters  and  file  uploads.   See
       "Apache::Request" for more information.

       If  the  args_method  is  'CGI',  the  Mason  request  object ($m) will have a method called "cgi_object"
       available.  This method returns the CGI object used for argument processing.

       While Mason will load "Apache::Request" or "CGI" as needed at runtime, it is recommended that you preload
       the relevant module either in your <u>httpd.conf</u> or <u>handler.pl</u> file, as this will save some memory.

   <b>auto_send_headers</b>
       •   Perl name:           auto_send_headers

       •   Apache name:         MasonAutoSendHeaders

       •   Type in httpd.conf:  boolean

       •   Default:             1

       •   Belongs to:          "HTML::Mason::Request::ApacheHandler"

       True or false, default is true.  Indicates whether Mason should automatically send  HTTP  headers  before
       sending content back to the client. If you set to false, you should call "$r-&gt;send_http_header" manually.

       See  the  sending  HTTP  headers  section  of the developer's manual for more details about the automatic
       header feature.

       NOTE: This parameter has no effect under mod_perl-2, since calling "$r-&gt;send_http_header"  is  no  longer
       needed.

   <b>autoflush</b>
       •   Perl name:           autoflush

       •   Apache name:         MasonAutoflush

       •   Type in httpd.conf:  boolean

       •   Default:             0

       •   Belongs to:          "HTML::Mason::Request"

       True  or false, default is false. Indicates whether to flush the output buffer ("$m-&gt;flush_buffer") after
       every string is output. Turn on autoflush if you need to send partial output to the client,  for  example
       in a progress meter.

       As  of  Mason 1.3, autoflush will only work if enable_autoflush has been set.  Components can be compiled
       more efficiently if they don't have to check for autoflush. Before using  autoflush  you  might  consider
       whether a few manual "$m-&gt;flush_buffer" calls would work nearly as well.

   <b>autohandler_name</b>
       •   Perl name:           autohandler_name

       •   Apache name:         MasonAutohandlerName

       •   Type in httpd.conf:  string

       •   Default:             autohandler

       •   Belongs to:          "HTML::Mason::Interp"

       File  name  used for autohandlers. Default is "autohandler".  If this is set to an empty string ("") then
       autohandlers are turned off entirely.

   <b>buffer_preallocate_size</b>
       •   Perl name:           buffer_preallocate_size

       •   Apache name:         MasonBufferPreallocateSize

       •   Type in httpd.conf:  string

       •   Default:             0

       •   Belongs to:          "HTML::Mason::Interp"

       Number of bytes to preallocate in the output buffer for each request.  Defaults to 0.  Setting  this  to,
       say,  your  maximum  page  size  (or close to it) can reduce the number of reallocations Perl performs as
       components add to the output buffer.

   <b>code_cache_max_size</b>
       •   Perl name:           code_cache_max_size

       •   Apache name:         MasonCodeCacheMaxSize

       •   Type in httpd.conf:  string

       •   Default:             unlimited

       •   Belongs to:          "HTML::Mason::Interp"

       Specifies the maximum number of components that should be held in the in-memory code cache.  The  default
       is  'unlimited', meaning no components will ever be discarded; Mason can perform certain optimizations in
       this mode. Setting this to zero disables the code cache entirely. See  the  code  cache  section  of  the
       administrator's manual for further details.

   <b>comp_class</b>
       •   Perl name:           comp_class

       •   Apache name:         MasonCompClass

       •   Type in httpd.conf:  string

       •   Default:             HTML::Mason::Component

       •   Belongs to:          "HTML::Mason::Compiler::ToObject"

       The class into which component objects are blessed.  This defaults to HTML::Mason::Component.

   <b>comp_root</b>
       •   Perl name:           comp_root

       •   Apache name:         MasonCompRoot

       •   Type in httpd.conf:  list

       •   Default:             Varies

       •   Belongs to:          "HTML::Mason::Interp"

       The  component  root  marks  the  top  of  your  component  hierarchy and defines how component paths are
       translated into real file paths.  For  example,  if  your  component  root  is  <u>/usr/local/httpd/docs</u>,  a
       component path of <u>/products/index.html</u> translates to the file <u>/usr/local/httpd/docs/products/index.html</u>.

       Under  Apache  and  CGI,  comp_root  defaults to the server's document root. In standalone mode comp_root
       defaults to the current working directory.

       This parameter may be either a scalar or an array  reference.   If  it  is  a  scalar,  it  should  be  a
       filesystem path indicating the component root. If it is an array reference, it should be of the following
       form:

        [ [ foo =&gt; '/usr/local/foo' ],
          [ bar =&gt; '/usr/local/bar' ] ]

       This  is  an  array of two-element array references, not a hash.  The "keys" for each path must be unique
       and their "values" must be filesystem paths.  These paths will be searched in the provided order whenever
       a component path is resolved. For example, given the above  component  roots  and  a  component  path  of
       <u>/products/index.html</u>,   Mason   would  search  first  for  <u>/usr/local/foo/products/index.html</u>,  then  for
       <u>/usr/local/bar/products/index.html</u>.

       The keys are used in several ways. They help to distinguish component caches  and  object  files  between
       different component roots, and they appear in the title() of a component.

       When you specify a single path for a component root, this is actually translated into

         [ [ MAIN =&gt; path ] ]

       If  you  have turned on dynamic_comp_root, you may modify the component root(s) of an interpreter between
       requests by calling "$interp-&gt;comp_root" with a value. However, the path associated with  any  given  key
       may not change between requests. For example, if the initial component root is

        [ [ foo =&gt; '/usr/local/foo' ],
          [ bar =&gt; '/usr/local/bar' ], ]

       then it may not be changed to

        [ [ foo =&gt; '/usr/local/bar' ],
          [ bar =&gt; '/usr/local/baz' ],

       but it may be changed to

        [ [ foo   =&gt; '/usr/local/foo' ],
          [ blarg =&gt; '/usr/local/blarg' ] ]

       In  other  words,  you may add or remove key/path pairs but not modify an already-used key/path pair. The
       reason for this restriction is that the interpreter maintains a component cache per key that would become
       invalid if the associated paths were to change.

   <b>compiler_class</b>
       •   Perl name:           compiler_class

       •   Apache name:         MasonCompilerClass

       •   Type in httpd.conf:  string

       •   Default:             HTML::Mason::Compiler::ToObject

       •   Belongs to:          "HTML::Mason::Interp"

       The class to use when creating a compiler. Defaults to HTML::Mason::Compiler::ToObject.

   <b>component_error_handler</b>
       •   Perl name:           component_error_handler

       •   Apache name:         MasonComponentErrorHandler

       •   Type in httpd.conf:  code

       •   Default:             sub { package HTML::Mason::Exceptions; use warnings; use strict 'refs'; my($err)
           = @_; return unless $err; if (UNIVERSAL::can($err, 'rethrow')) { $err-&gt;rethrow; } elsif (ref $err)  {
           die $err; } 'HTML::Mason::Exception'-&gt;throw('error', $err); }

       •   Belongs to:          "HTML::Mason::Request"

       A  code  reference used to handle errors thrown during component compilation or runtime. By default, this
       is a subroutine that turns non-exception object errors in components into exceptions. If  this  parameter
       is set to a false value, these errors are simply rethrown as-is.

       Turning  exceptions  into objects can be expensive, since this will cause the generation of a stack trace
       for each error. If you are using strings or unblessed references as exceptions in your code, you may want
       to turn this off as a performance boost.

   <b>data_cache_api</b>
       •   Perl name:           data_cache_api

       •   Apache name:         MasonDataCacheApi

       •   Type in httpd.conf:  string

       •   Default:             1.1

       •   Belongs to:          "HTML::Mason::Request"

       The "$m-&gt;cache" API to use:

       •   '1.1', the default, indicates a "Cache::Cache" based API.

       •   'chi' indicates a "CHI" based API.

       •   '1.0' indicates the custom cache API used in Mason 1.0x and  earlier.  This  compatibility  layer  is
           provided as a convenience for users upgrading from older versions of Mason, but will not be supported
           indefinitely.

   <b>data_cache_defaults</b>
       •   Perl name:           data_cache_defaults

       •   Apache name:         MasonDataCacheDefaults

       •   Type in httpd.conf:  hash_list

       •   Default:             None

       •   Belongs to:          "HTML::Mason::Request"

       A  hash  reference  of  default  options  to  use  for  the  "$m-&gt;cache"  command.   For  example, to use
       Cache::Cache's "MemoryCache" implementation by default:

           data_cache_defaults =&gt; {cache_class =&gt; 'MemoryCache'}

       To use the CHI "FastMmap" driver by default:

           data_cache_api      =&gt; 'CHI',
           data_cache_defaults =&gt; {driver =&gt; 'FastMmap'},

       These settings are overridden by options given to particular "$m-&gt;cache" calls.

   <b>data_dir</b>
       •   Perl name:           data_dir

       •   Apache name:         MasonDataDir

       •   Type in httpd.conf:  string

       •   Default:             None

       •   Belongs to:          "HTML::Mason::Interp"

       The data directory is a writable directory that Mason uses for various features  and  optimizations:  for
       example,  component  object  files  and  data cache files. Mason will create the directory on startup, if
       necessary, and set its permissions according to the web server User/Group.

       Under Apache, data_dir defaults to a directory called "mason" under the Apache server root. You will need
       to change this on certain systems that assign a high-level server root such as <u><a href="file:/usr">/usr</a></u>!

       In non-Apache environments, data_dir has no default. If it is left unspecified, Mason will not use object
       files, and the default data cache class will be "MemoryCache" instead of "FileCache".

   <b>decline_dirs</b>
       •   Perl name:           decline_dirs

       •   Apache name:         MasonDeclineDirs

       •   Type in httpd.conf:  boolean

       •   Default:             1

       •   Belongs to:          "HTML::Mason::ApacheHandler"

       True or false, default is true. Indicates whether Mason should decline directory requests, leaving Apache
       to serve up a directory index or a "FORBIDDEN" error as appropriate. See the allowing directory  requests
       section of the administrator's manual for more information about handling directories with Mason.

   <b>default_escape_flags</b>
       •   Perl name:           default_escape_flags

       •   Apache name:         MasonDefaultEscapeFlags

       •   Type in httpd.conf:  string

       •   Default:             []

       •   Belongs to:          "HTML::Mason::Compiler"

       Escape flags to apply to all &lt;% %&gt; expressions by default. The current valid flags are

           h - escape for HTML ('&lt;' =&gt; '&amp;lt;', etc.)
           u - escape for URL (':' =&gt; '%3A', etc.)

       The  developer  can override default escape flags on a per-expression basis; see the escaping expressions
       section of the developer's manual.

       If you want to set <u>multiple</u> flags as the default, this should be given as a  reference  to  an  array  of
       flags.

   <b>define_args_hash</b>
       •   Perl name:           define_args_hash

       •   Apache name:         MasonDefineArgsHash

       •   Type in httpd.conf:  string

       •   Default:             auto

       •   Belongs to:          "HTML::Mason::Compiler::ToObject"

       One  of  "always",  "auto",  or  "never".   This  determines  whether  or not an %ARGS hash is created in
       components.  If it is set to "always", one is always defined.  If set to "never", it is never defined.

       The default, "auto", will cause the hash to be defined only if some part of the  component  contains  the
       string "ARGS".  This is somewhat crude, and may result in some false positives, but this is preferable to
       false negatives.

       Not defining the args hash means that we can avoid copying component arguments, which can save memory and
       slightly improve execution speed.

   <b>dhandler_name</b>
       •   Perl name:           dhandler_name

       •   Apache name:         MasonDhandlerName

       •   Type in httpd.conf:  string

       •   Default:             dhandler

       •   Belongs to:          "HTML::Mason::Request"

       File  name  used  for  dhandlers.  Default  is  "dhandler".   If this is set to an empty string ("") then
       dhandlers are turned off entirely.

   <b>dynamic_comp_root</b>
       •   Perl name:           dynamic_comp_root

       •   Apache name:         MasonDynamicCompRoot

       •   Type in httpd.conf:  boolean

       •   Default:             0

       •   Belongs to:          "HTML::Mason::Interp"

       True or false, defaults to false. Indicates whether the comp_root can be  modified  on  this  interpreter
       between  requests.  Mason can perform a few optimizations with a fixed component root, so you should only
       set this to true if you actually need it.

   <b>enable_autoflush</b>
       •   Perl name:           enable_autoflush

       •   Apache name:         MasonEnableAutoflush

       •   Type in httpd.conf:  boolean

       •   Default:             1

       •   Belongs to:          "HTML::Mason::Compiler"

       True or false, default is true. Indicates whether components are compiled with support for autoflush. The
       component can be compiled to a more efficient form if it does not have to check for  autoflush  mode,  so
       you should set this to 0 if you can.

   <b>error_format</b>
       •   Perl name:           error_format

       •   Apache name:         MasonErrorFormat

       •   Type in httpd.conf:  string

       •   Default:             Varies

       •   Belongs to:          "HTML::Mason::Request"

       Indicates how errors are formatted. The built-in choices are

       •   <u>brief</u> - just the error message with no trace information

       •   <u>text</u> - a multi-line text format

       •   <u>line</u>  - a single-line text format, with different pieces of information separated by tabs (useful for
           log files)

       •   <u>html</u> - a fancy html format

       The default format under Apache and CGI is either <u>line</u> or <u>html</u> depending on whether  the  error  mode  is
       <u>fatal</u> or <u>output</u>, respectively. The default for standalone mode is <u>text</u>.

       The  formats  correspond  to  "HTML::Mason::Exception"  methods  named as_<u>format</u>. You can define your own
       format by creating an appropriately named method; for example, to define an "xml" format, create a method
       "HTML::Mason::Exception::as_xml" patterned after one of the built-in methods.

   <b>error_mode</b>
       •   Perl name:           error_mode

       •   Apache name:         MasonErrorMode

       •   Type in httpd.conf:  string

       •   Default:             Varies

       •   Belongs to:          "HTML::Mason::Request"

       Indicates how errors are returned to the caller.  The choices are <u>fatal</u>, meaning die with the error,  and
       <u>output</u>, meaning output the error just like regular output.

       The  default  under  Apache  and  CGI  is  <u>output</u>, causing the error to be displayed in the browser.  The
       default for standalone mode is <u>fatal</u>.

   <b>escape_flags</b>
       •   Perl name:           escape_flags

       •   Apache name:         MasonEscapeFlags

       •   Type in httpd.conf:  hash_list

       •   Default:             None

       •   Belongs to:          "HTML::Mason::Interp"

       A hash reference of escape flags to set for this object.  See the section on the  set_escape  method  for
       more details.

   <b>ignore_warnings_expr</b>
       •   Perl name:           ignore_warnings_expr

       •   Apache name:         MasonIgnoreWarningsExpr

       •   Type in httpd.conf:  regex

       •   Default:             qr/Subroutine .* redefined/i

       •   Belongs to:          "HTML::Mason::Interp"

       Regular  expression  indicating which warnings to ignore when loading components. Any warning that is not
       ignored will prevent the component from being loaded and executed. For example:

           ignore_warnings_expr =&gt;
               'Global symbol.*requires explicit package'

       If set to undef, all warnings are heeded. If set  to  '.',  warnings  are  turned  off  completely  as  a
       specially optimized case.

       By  default,  this  is  set  to 'Subroutine .* redefined'.  This allows you to declare global subroutines
       inside &lt;%once&gt; sections and not receive an error when the component is reloaded.

   <b>in_package</b>
       •   Perl name:           in_package

       •   Apache name:         MasonInPackage

       •   Type in httpd.conf:  string

       •   Default:             HTML::Mason::Commands

       •   Belongs to:          "HTML::Mason::Compiler::ToObject"

       This is the package in which a component's code is executed.  For historical reasons,  this  defaults  to
       "HTML::Mason::Commands".

   <b>interp_class</b>
       •   Perl name:           interp_class

       •   Apache name:         MasonInterpClass

       •   Apache name:         MasonLexerClass

       •   Type in httpd.conf:  string

       •   Default:             HTML::Mason::Lexer

       •   Belongs to:          "HTML::Mason::Compiler"

       The class to use when creating a lexer. Defaults to HTML::Mason::Lexer.

   <b>max_recurse</b>

       •   Default:             32

       •   Belongs to:          "HTML::Mason::Request"

       The  maximum  recursion  depth  for  the  component stack, for the request stack, and for the inheritance
       stack. An error is signalled if the maximum is exceeded.  Default is 32.

   <b>named_component_subs</b>
       •   Perl name:           named_component_subs

       •   Apache name:         MasonNamedComponentSubs

       •   Type in httpd.conf:  boolean

       •   Default:             0

       •   Belongs to:          "HTML::Mason::Compiler::ToObject"

       When compiling a component, use uniquely named subroutines for the a component's body, subcomponents, and
       methods. Doing this allows you to effectively profile Mason  components.  Without  this,  all  components
       simply show up as __ANON__ or something similar in the profiler.

   <b>object_file_extension</b>
       •   Perl name:           object_file_extension

       •   Apache name:         MasonObjectFileExtension

       •   Default:             .obj

       •   Belongs to:          "HTML::Mason::Interp"

       Extension to add to the end of object files. Default is ".obj".

   <b>out_method</b>
       •   Perl name:           out_method

       •   Apache name:         MasonOutMethod

       •   Type in httpd.conf:  code

       •   Default:             Print to STDOUT

       •   Belongs to:          "HTML::Mason::Request"

       Indicates  where  to  send  output.  If  out_method is a reference to a scalar, output is appended to the
       scalar.  If out_method is a reference to a subroutine, the subroutine is called with each output  string.
       For example, to send output to a file called "mason.out":

           my $fh = new IO::File "&gt;mason.out";
           ...
           out_method =&gt; sub { $fh-&gt;print($_[0]) }

       By  default,  out_method  prints  to  standard  output.  Under  Apache,  standard output is redirected to
       "$r-&gt;print".

       •   Belongs to:          "HTML::Mason::Compiler::ToObject"

       Text  given  for  this  parameter is placed at the end of each component. See also preamble.  The request
       will be available as $m in postamble code.

   <b>postprocess_perl</b>
       •   Perl name:           postprocess_perl

       •   Apache name:         MasonPostprocessPerl

       •   Type in httpd.conf:  code

       •   Default:             None

       •   Belongs to:          "HTML::Mason::Compiler"

       Sub reference that is called to postprocess the Perl portion of a compiled component, just before  it  is
       assembled  into its final subroutine form.  The sub is called with a single parameter, a scalar reference
       to the Perl portion of the component.  The sub is expected to  process  the  string  in-place.  See  also
       preprocess and postprocess_text.

   <b>postprocess_text</b>

       •   Type in httpd.conf:  code

       •   Default:             None

       •   Belongs to:          "HTML::Mason::Compiler"

       Sub  reference  that is called to postprocess the text portion of a compiled component, just before it is
       assembled into its final subroutine form.  The sub is called with a single parameter, a scalar  reference
       to  the  text  portion  of  the  component.  The sub is expected to process the string in-place. See also
       preprocess and postprocess_perl.

   <b>preamble</b>

       •   Default:             None

       •   Belongs to:          "HTML::Mason::Compiler::ToObject"

       Text given for this parameter is placed at the beginning of each component, but after  the  execution  of
       any "&lt;%once&gt;" block. See also postamble. The request will be available as $m in preamble code.

   <b>preloads</b>
       •   Perl name:           preloads

       •   Apache name:         MasonPreloads

       •   Type in httpd.conf:  list

       •   Default:             None

       •   Belongs to:          "HTML::Mason::Interp"

       A list of component paths, optionally with glob wildcards, to load when the interpreter initializes. e.g.

           preloads =&gt; ['/foo/index.html','/bar/*.pl']

       Default  is  the  empty  list.  For maximum performance, this should only be used for components that are
       frequently viewed and rarely updated.  See the  preloading  components  section  of  the  administrator's
       manual for further details.

       As  mentioned  in  the developer's manual, a component's "&lt;%once&gt;" section is executed when it is loaded.
       For preloaded components, this means that this section will be executed before a Mason or Apache  request
       exist, so preloading a component that uses $m or $r in a "&lt;%once&gt;" section will fail.

   <b>preprocess</b>
       •   Perl name:           preprocess

       •   Apache name:         MasonPreprocess

       •   Type in httpd.conf:  code

       •   Default:             None

       •   Belongs to:          "HTML::Mason::Compiler"

       Sub  reference  that is called to preprocess each component before the compiler does it's magic.  The sub
       is called with a single parameter, a scalar reference to the script.  The sub is expected to process  the
       script  in-place.   This is one way to extend the HTML::Mason syntax with new tags, etc., although a much
       more  flexible  way  is  to  subclass  the  Lexer  or  Compiler  class.  See  also  postprocess_text  and
       postprocess_perl.

   <b>request_class</b>
       •   Perl name:           request_class

       •   Apache name:         MasonRequestClass

       •   Type in httpd.conf:  string

       •   Default:             HTML::Mason::Request

       •   Belongs to:          "HTML::Mason::Interp"

       The class to use when creating requests. Defaults to HTML::Mason::Request.

   <b>resolver_class</b>
       •   Perl name:           resolver_class

       •   Apache name:         MasonResolverClass

       •   Type in httpd.conf:  string

       •   Default:             HTML::Mason::Resolver::File

       •   Belongs to:          "HTML::Mason::Interp"

       The class to use when creating a resolver. Defaults to HTML::Mason::Resolver::File.

   <b>static_source</b>
       •   Perl name:           static_source

       •   Apache name:         MasonStaticSource

       •   Type in httpd.conf:  boolean

       •   Default:             0

       •   Belongs to:          "HTML::Mason::Interp"

       True or false, default is false. When false, Mason checks the timestamp of the component source file each
       time  the  component  is  used  to  see  if it has changed. This provides the instant feedback for source
       changes that is expected for development.  However  it  does  entail  a  file  stat  for  each  component
       executed.

       When true, Mason assumes that the component source tree is unchanging: it will not check component source
       files  to  determine  if  the memory cache or object file has expired.  This can save many file stats per
       request. However, in order to get Mason to recognize a component source change, you must flush the memory
       cache and remove object files.  See static_source_touch_file for one easy way to arrange this.

       We recommend turning this mode on in your production sites if possible, if performance is of any concern.

   <b>static_source_touch_file</b>
       •   Perl name:           static_source_touch_file

       •   Apache name:         MasonStaticSourceTouchFile

       •   Type in httpd.conf:  string

       •   Default:             None

       •   Belongs to:          "HTML::Mason::Interp"

       Specifies a filename that Mason will check once at the beginning of  of  every  request.  When  the  file
       timestamp  changes,  Mason  will  (1) clear its in-memory component cache, and (2) remove object files if
       they have not already been deleted by another process.

       This provides a convenient way to implement static_source mode.  All you need to do is make sure  that  a
       single  file  gets  touched  whenever  components change. For Mason's part, checking a single file at the
       beginning of a request is much cheaper than checking every component file when static_source=0.

   <b>subcomp_class</b>
       •   Perl name:           subcomp_class

       •   Apache name:         MasonSubcompClass

       •   Type in httpd.conf:  string

       •   Default:             HTML::Mason::Component::Subcomponent

       •   Belongs to:          "HTML::Mason::Compiler::ToObject"

       The    class    into    which    subcomponent    objects    are    blessed.      This     defaults     to
       HTML::Mason::Component::Subcomponent.

   <b>use_object_files</b>
       •   Perl name:           use_object_files

       •   Apache name:         MasonUseObjectFiles

       •   Type in httpd.conf:  boolean

       •   Default:             1

       •   Belongs to:          "HTML::Mason::Interp"

       True  or  false,  default  is  true.  Specifies whether Mason creates object files to save the results of
       component parsing. You may want to turn off object files for  disk  space  reasons,  but  otherwise  this
       should be left alone.

   <b>use_source_line_numbers</b>
       •   Perl name:           use_source_line_numbers

       •   Apache name:         MasonUseSourceLineNumbers

       •   Type in httpd.conf:  boolean

       •   Default:             1

       •   Belongs to:          "HTML::Mason::Compiler"

       True  or  false, default is true. Indicates whether component line numbers that appear in error messages,
       stack traces, etc. are in terms of the source file instead  of  the  object  file.  Mason  does  this  by
       inserting  '#line'  directives  into compiled components.  While source line numbers are more immediately
       helpful, object file line numbers may be more appropriate for in-depth debugging sessions.

   <b>use_strict</b>
       •   Perl name:           use_strict

       •   Apache name:         MasonUseStrict

       •   Type in httpd.conf:  boolean

       •   Default:             1

       •   Belongs to:          "HTML::Mason::Compiler::ToObject"

       True or false, default is true. Indicates whether or not a given component should "use strict".

   <b>use_warnings</b>
       •   Perl name:           use_warnings

       •   Apache name:         MasonUseWarnings

       •   Default:             1

       •   Belongs to:          "HTML::Mason::Compiler::ToObject"

       True or false, default is false. Indicates whether or not a given component should "use warnings".
