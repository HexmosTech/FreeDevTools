</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       al_hold_bitmap_drawing - Allegro 5 API

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
              #include &lt;allegro5/allegro.h&gt;

              void al_hold_bitmap_drawing(bool hold)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Enables  or  disables  deferred  bitmap  drawing.  This allows for efficient drawing of many bitmaps that
       share a parent bitmap, such as sub-bitmaps from a tilesheet or simply identical bitmaps.  Drawing bitmaps
       that do not share a parent is less efficient, so it is advisable to stagger  bitmap  drawing  calls  such
       that  the  parent  bitmap  is the same for large number of those calls.  While deferred bitmap drawing is
       enabled, the only functions that can be used are the bitmap drawing functions and font drawing functions.
       Changing the state such as the blending modes will result in undefined behaviour.  One exception to  this
       rule  are  the  non-projection  transformations.   It  is  possible to set a new transformation while the
       drawing is held.

       No drawing is guaranteed to take place until you disable the hold.  Thus, the idiom  of  this  functionâ€™s
       usage  is to enable the deferred bitmap drawing, draw as many bitmaps as possible, taking care to stagger
       bitmaps that share parent bitmaps, and then disable deferred drawing.  As mentioned above, this  function
       also  works  with bitmap and truetype fonts, so if multiple lines of text need to be drawn, this function
       can speed things up.
