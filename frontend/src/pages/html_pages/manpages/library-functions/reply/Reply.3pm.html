</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Reply - read, eval, print, loop, yay!

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 0.42

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Reply;

         Reply-&gt;new(config =&gt; "$ENV{HOME}/.replyrc")-&gt;run;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       NOTE: This is an early release, and implementation details of this module are still very much in flux.
       Feedback is welcome!

       Reply is a lightweight, extensible REPL for Perl. It is plugin-based (see Reply::Plugin), and through
       plugins supports many advanced features such as coloring and pretty printing, readline support, and
       pluggable commands.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>new(%opts)</b>
       Creates a new Reply instance. Valid options are:

       config
           Name  of  a  configuration  file  to load. This should contain INI-style configuration for plugins as
           described above.

       plugins
           An arrayref of additional plugins to load.

   <b>run</b>
       Runs the repl. Will continue looping until the "read_line" callback returns  undef  (typically  when  the
       user presses "Ctrl+D"), or the "loop" callback returns false (by default, the "#q" command quits the repl
       in this way).

   <b>step($line,</b> <b>$verbose)</b>
       Runs  a  single  iteration of the repl. If $line is given, it will be used as the string to evaluate (and
       the "prompt" and "read_line" callbacks will not be called). If $verbose is true, the prompt and line will
       be displayed as though they were typed. Returns true if the repl  can  continue,  and  false  if  it  was
       requested to quit.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       Configuration  uses an INI-style format similar to the configuration format of Dist::Zilla. Section names
       are used as the names of plugins, and any options within a  section  are  passed  as  arguments  to  that
       plugin.  Plugins  are  loaded in order as they are listed in the configuration file, which can affect the
       results in some cases where multiple plugins are hooking into a single callback  (see  Reply::Plugin  for
       more information).

       In  addition  to  plugin  configuration,  there  are  some  additional  options recognized. These must be
       specified at the top of the file, before any section headers.

       script_file
           This contains a filename whose contents will be evaluated as perl code once the configuration is done
           being loaded.

       script_line&lt;<u>n</u>&gt;
           Any options that start with "script_line" will be sorted by their key and then  each  value  will  be
           evaluated individually once the configuration is done being loaded.

           NOTE:  this  is  currently a hack due to the fact that Config::INI doesn't support multiple keys with
           the same name in a section. This may be fixed in the future to just  allow  specifying  "script_line"
           multiple times.
