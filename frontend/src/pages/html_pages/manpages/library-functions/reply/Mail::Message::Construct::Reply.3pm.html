</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Mail::Message::Construct::Reply - reply to a Mail::Message

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        my Mail::Message $reply = $message-&gt;reply;
        my $quoted  = $message-&gt;replyPrelude($head-&gt;get('From'));

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Complex functionality on Mail::Message objects is implemented in different files which are autoloaded.
       This file implements the functionality related to creating message replies.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Constructing</b> <b>a</b> <b>message</b>
       $obj-&gt;<b>reply</b>(%options)
           Start  a  reply  to  this  message. Some of the header-lines of the original message will be taken. A
           message-id will be assigned. Some header lines will be updated to facilitate message-thread detection
           (see Mail::Box::Thread::Manager).

           You may reply to a whole message or a message part.  You may wish to overrule  some  of  the  default
           header settings for the reply immediately, or you may do that later with "set" on the header.

           ADDRESSES  may  be  specified  as  string,  or  a  Mail::Address object, or as array of Mail::Address
           objects.

           All %options which are not listed below AND start with a capital, will be added as additional headers
           to the reply message.

            -Option         --Default
             Bcc              undef
             Cc               &lt;'cc' in current&gt;
             From             &lt;'to' in current&gt;
             Message-ID       &lt;uniquely generated&gt;
             Subject          replySubject()
             To               &lt;sender in current&gt;
             body             undef
             group_reply      &lt;true&gt;
             include          'INLINE'
             max_signature    10
             message_type     Mail::Message
             postlude         undef
             prelude          undef
             quote            '&gt; '
             signature        undef
             strip_signature  qr/^--\s/

           Bcc =&gt; ADDRESSES
             Receivers of blind carbon copies: their names will not be published to other message receivers.

           Cc =&gt; ADDRESSES
             The carbon-copy receivers, by default a copy of the "Cc" field of the source message.

           From =&gt; ADDRESSES
             Your identification, by default taken from the "To" field of the source message.

           Message-ID =&gt; STRING
             Supply a STRING as specific message-id for the reply.  By default, one is generated  for  you.   If
             there are no angles around your id, they will be added.

           Subject =&gt; STRING|CODE
             Force  the  subject line to the specific STRING, or the result of the subroutine specified by CODE.
             The subroutine will be called passing the subject of the original message  as  only  argument.   By
             default, <b>Mail::Message::replySubject()</b> is used.

           To =&gt; ADDRESSES
             The destination of your message.  By default taken from the "Reply-To" field in the source message.
             If  that  field  is  not present as well, the "From" line is scanned.  If they all fail, "undef" is
             returned by this method: no reply message produced.

           body =&gt; BODY
             Usually, the reply method can create a nice, sufficient message from the source message's body.  In
             case you like more complicated reformatting, you may also create a body yourself  first,  and  pass
             this  on  to  this "reply" method. Some of the other options to this method will be ignored in this
             case.

           group_reply =&gt; BOOLEAN
             Will the people listed in the "Cc" headers (those who received the message where you reply to  now)
             also receive this message as carbon copy?

           include =&gt; 'NO'|'INLINE'|'ATTACH'
             Must  the  message  where  this  is a reply to be included in the message?  If "NO" then not.  With
             "INLINE" a reply body is composed. "ATTACH" will create  a  multi-part  body,  where  the  original
             message  is  added  after  the  specified  body.   It  is only possible to inline textual messages,
             therefore binary or multipart messages will always be enclosed as attachment.

           max_signature =&gt; INTEGER
             Passed to "stripSignature" on the body as parameter "max_lines".  Only  effective  for  single-part
             messages.

           message_type =&gt; CLASS
             Create  a  message  with  the  requested  type.   By  default, it will be a Mail::Message.  This is
             correct, because it will be coerced into the correct folder message type when it is added  to  that
             folder.

           postlude =&gt; BODY|LINES
             The  line(s)  which  to  be  added after the quoted reply lines.  Create a body for it first.  This
             should not include the signature, which has its own option.  The signature will be added after  the
             postlude when the reply is INLINEd.

           prelude =&gt; BODY|LINES
             The line(s) which will be added before the quoted reply lines.  If nothing is specified, the result
             of the <b>replyPrelude()</b> method is taken.  When "undef" is specified, no prelude will be added.

           quote =&gt; CODE|STRING
             Mangle  the  lines  of  an  "INLINE"d reply with CODE, or by prepending a STRING to each line.  The
             routine specified by CODE is called when the line is in $_.

             By default, '&gt; ' is added before each line.  Specify "undef" to disable quoting.   This  option  is
             processed after the body has been decoded.

           signature =&gt; BODY|MESSAGE
             The  signature  to  be  added  in  case of a multi-part reply.  The mime-type of the signature body
             should indicate this is a used as such.  However, in INLINE mode, the body will be  taken,  a  line
             containing '-- ' added before it, and added behind the epilogue.

           strip_signature =&gt; REGEXP|STRING|CODE
             Remove   the   signature   of   the   sender.    The   value   of   this  parameter  is  passed  to
             Mail::Message::Body::stripSignature(pattern) unless the source text is not included.  The signature
             is stripped from the message before quoting.

             When a multipart body is encountered, and the message is included to ATTACH, the parts  which  look
             like  signatures  will  be  removed.   If  only one message remains, it will be the added as single
             attachment, otherwise a nested multipart will be the result.  The value of  this  option  does  not
             matter, as long as it is present.  See Mail::Message::Body::Multipart.

           example:

             my $reply = $msg-&gt;reply
              ( prelude         =&gt; "No spam, please!\n\n"
              , postlude        =&gt; "\nGreetings\n"
              , strip_signature =&gt; 1
              , signature       =&gt; $my_pgp_key
              , group_reply     =&gt; 1
              , 'X-Extra'       =&gt; 'additional header'
              );

       $obj-&gt;<b>replyPrelude</b>( [STRING|$field|$address|ARRAY-$of-$things] )
           Produces  a  list  of  lines  (usually only one), which will preceded the quoted body of the message.
           STRING must comply to the RFC822 email address specification, and is usually the content of a "To" or
           "From" header line.  If a $field is specified, the field's body must be compliant.  Without  argument
           -or when the argument is "undef"- a slightly different line is produced.

           An characteristic example of the output is

           Create  a subject for a message which is a reply for this one.  This routine tries to count the level
           of reply in subject field, and transform it into a standard form.  Please contribute improvements.
