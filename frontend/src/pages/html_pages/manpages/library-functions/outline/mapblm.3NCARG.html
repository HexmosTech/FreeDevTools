</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       MAPBLM - Draws geographical outlines masked against an existing area map.  Note that this routine uses
       whichever old outline dataset is selected by the value of the internal parameter 'OU'; to access the new
       map database "Earth..1", which was created in 1998, one must call instead the EZMAPB routine MPLNDM.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       CALL MAPBLM (IAMA,XCRA,YCRA,MCRA,IAAI,IAGI,MNOG,ULPR)

</pre><h4><b>C-BINDING</b> <b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;ncarg/ncargC.h&gt;

       void c_mapblm (int *iama, float *xcra, float *ycra,
       int mcra, int *iaai, int *iagi, int mnog,
       int (*ulpr)(float *xcra, float *ycra, int *ncs,
       int *iaai, int *iagi, int *nai))

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       IAMA        (an  input/output  array,  dimensioned as specified in a call to the AREAS routine ARINAM, of
                   type INTEGER) is the array containing the area map against which boundary  lines  are  to  be
                   masked.  The  area  map must have been initialized by a call to ARINAM; it should contain the
                   edges required to create a desired effect.  For example, an area map might  be  created  that
                   defines  a  region of interest, within which user data is available and within which boundary
                   lines are to be drawn. For more details, see the reference document  for  the  package  named
                   AREAS.

       XCRA and YCRA
                   (scratch  arrays,  dimensioned at least MCRA, of type REAL) are to be used by MAPBLM in calls
                   to the AREAS routine ARDRLN; they will eventually be used in calls to the user-provided line-
                   processing routine ULPR.

       MCRA        (an input expression of type INTEGER) is the dimension of the arrays XCRA and YCRA.

       IAAI and IAGI
                   (scratch arrays, dimensioned at least NOGI, of type INTEGER) are to  be  used  by  MAPBLM  in
                   calls to the AREAS routine ARDRLN; they will eventually be used in calls to the user-provided
                   line-processing routine ULPR. The mnemonics stand for "Integer Array of Area Identifiers" and
                   "Integer Array of Group Identifiers", respectively.

       NOGI        (an  input  expression  of  type  INTEGER)  is the dimension of the arrays IAAI and IAGI. The
                   mnemonic stands for "Number  Of  Group  Identifiers  (of  edges  in  the  area  map)",  which
                   determines the required dimension of IAAI and IAGI.

       ULPR        is the name of the user-supplied line-processing routine. It must be declared EXTERNAL in the
                   routine that calls MAPBLM, so that the compiler and loader will know that it is the name of a
                   routine  to  be  called  instead of a variable. The user routine ULPR will be called once for
                   each piece of a boundary line resulting from the masking process; it may decide to  draw  (or
                   to not draw) each such piece. ULPR will be called using a FORTRAN statement like

                        CALL ULPR (XCRA,YCRA,NCRA,IAAI,IAGI,NGPS)

                   where  XCRA and YCRA are real arrays holding the normalized device coordinates of NCRA points
                   defining a polyline which is part of some boundary line and IAAI and IAGI are integer  arrays
                   holding  NGPS  area-identifier/group-identifier pairs for the area within which that piece of
                   the line lies. In writing ULPR, the user may rely upon a SET call's having  been  done  which
                   makes  it  possible  to  use  normalized  device coordinates in calls to routines like CURVE,
                   CURVED, GPL, etc. For more details, see the reference document for the  package  named  AREAS
                   and, in particular, the description of the subroutine ARDRLN.

</pre><h4><b>C-BINDING</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The C-binding argument descriptions are the same as the FORTRAN argument descriptions.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       The statement

            CALL MAPBLM (IAMA,XCRA,YCRA,MCRA,IAAI,IAGI,MNOG,ULPR)

       does the same thing as the statement

            CALL MAPLOT

       except  that the boundary lines are drawn using calls to MAPITM and MAPIQM, which does the masking of the
       lines against the area map defined by the arguments in the call and passes the pieces resulting from  the
       masking process to a user-provided line-drawing routine.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Use the ncargex command to see the following relevant example: cpex10.

</pre><h4><b>ACCESS</b></h4><pre>
       To  use MAPBLM or c_mapblm, load the NCAR Graphics libraries ncarg, ncarg_gks, and ncarg_c, preferably in
       that order.
