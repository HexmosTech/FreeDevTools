</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>XmOutline</b> — The Outline widget class "XmOutline" "widget class" "Outline"

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;Xm/Outline.h&gt;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  Outline  widget  is a container that shows the relationship of its children in a graphical tree-like
       format. Each child of the Outline widget is a  node  in  the  Outline.   The  parent-child  relationships
       between  these nodes are completely distinct from the widget hierarchy. The hierarchy of nodes is created
       by specifying the tree "parent" of each node as a constraint resource. If a node's parent is NULL then it
       is assumed to be a root of the tree. Although each widget can only have one parent,  the  Outline  widget
       supports adding more than one "root" node to a single Outline.

       Note:  The  Outline  widget  assumes  that  it  will be totally responsible for mapping and unmapping its
       children. Therefore no child of this widget should ever modify its mappedWhenManaged resource. If a child
       does modify this resource the behavior is undefined.

   <b>User</b> <b>Interaction</b>
       Each node in the outline can have one of four states: open, closed, always open, and hidden. The state of
       a node changes how it appears to the user and what actions are available to the user.

       Open           This node will have an open folder shown to its left that may be selected by the  user  to
                      close this node. When a node is open all of its children will be visible to the user.

       Closed         This  node will have a closed folder shown to its left that may be selected by the user to
                      open this node. When a node is closed none of its children will be visible to the user.

       Always Open    This node will have no folder button associated with it.  All  of  its  children  will  be
                      visible to the user.

       Hidden         This  node  will  not  be  shown  to  the user and all of its children will appear and act
                      exactly as if they were children of this node's parent. It will appear to the user  as  if
                      this node does not exist.

       To maintain consistency of the user interface we have found that it is best to use the node state "Always
       Open" for nodes with no children. This way the user will only see a folder button next to a node that has
       children  to  display.  A  folder  button  associated  with  a  node  that has no children has no defined
       semantics.

   <b>Classes</b>
       Outline inherits behavior and resources from the <b>Core</b>, <b>Composite</b>, <b>Constraint</b>, <b>XmManager</b>, and  <b>XmHierarchy</b>
       classes.

       The class pointer is <b>xmOutlineWidgetClass</b>.

       The class name is <b>XmOutline</b>.

   <b>New</b> <b>Resources</b>
       The  following  table  defines  a  set  of  widget  resources used by the programmer to specify data. The
       programmer can also set the resource values for the inherited classes to set attributes for this  widget.
       To  reference  a  resource by name or by class in a <b>.Xdefaults</b> file, remove the <b>XmN</b> or <b>XmC</b> prefix and use
       the remaining letters. To specify one of the defined values for a resource in a <b>.Xdefaults</b>  file,  remove
       the  <b>Xm</b>  prefix  and  use  the  remaining  letters  (in  either  lowercase  or uppercase, but include any
       underscores between words).  The codes in the access column indicate if the given resource can be set  at
       creation time (C), set by using <b>XtSetValues</b> (S), retrieved by using <b>XtGetValues</b> (G), or is not applicable
       (N/A).
