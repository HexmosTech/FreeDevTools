</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Crypt::Blowfish - Perl Blowfish encryption module

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Crypt::Blowfish;
         my $cipher = new Crypt::Blowfish $key;
         my $ciphertext = $cipher-&gt;encrypt($plaintext);
         my $plaintext  = $cipher-&gt;decrypt($ciphertext);

         You probably want to use this in conjunction with
         a block chaining module like Crypt::CBC.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Blowfish is capable of strong encryption and can use key sizes up to 56 bytes (a 448 bit key).  You're
       encouraged to take advantage of the full key size to ensure the strongest encryption possible from this
       module.

       Crypt::Blowfish has the following methods:

        blocksize()
        keysize()
        encrypt()
        decrypt()

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       blocksize
           Returns the size (in bytes) of the block cipher.

           Crypt::Blowfish  doesn't  return  a  key  size  due to its ability to use variable-length keys.  More
           accurately, it shouldn't, but it does anyway to play nicely with others.

       new
                   my $cipher = new Crypt::Blowfish $key;

           This creates a new Crypt::Blowfish BlockCipher object, using $key, where $key is a key  of  keysize()
           bytes (minimum of eight bytes).

       encrypt
                   my $cipher = new Crypt::Blowfish $key;
                   my $ciphertext = $cipher-&gt;encrypt($plaintext);

           This  function  encrypts $plaintext and returns the $ciphertext where $plaintext and $ciphertext must
           be of blocksize() bytes.  (hint:  Blowfish is an 8 byte block cipher)

       decrypt
                   my $cipher = new Crypt::Blowfish $key;
                   my $plaintext = $cipher-&gt;decrypt($ciphertext);

           This function decrypts $ciphertext and returns the $plaintext where $plaintext and  $ciphertext  must
           be of blocksize() bytes.  (hint:  see previous hint)

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
               my $key = pack("H16", "0123456789ABCDEF");  # min. 8 bytes
               my $cipher = new Crypt::Blowfish $key;
               my $ciphertext = $cipher-&gt;encrypt("plaintex");  # SEE NOTES
               print unpack("H16", $ciphertext), "\n";

</pre><h4><b>PLATFORMS</b></h4><pre>
               Please see the README document for platforms and performance
               tests.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       The  module  is  capable  of  being  used  with  Crypt::CBC.   You're  encouraged to read the perldoc for
       Crypt::CBC if you intend to use this module for Cipher Block Chaining modes.  In fact, if  you  have  any
       intentions of encrypting more than eight bytes of data with this, or any other block cipher, you're going
       to need <b>some</b> type of block chaining help.  Crypt::CBC tends to be very good at this.  If you're not going
       to  encrypt  more  than eight bytes, your data <b>must</b> be <b>exactly</b> eight bytes long.  If need be, do your own
       padding. "\0" as a null byte is perfectly valid to use for this.
