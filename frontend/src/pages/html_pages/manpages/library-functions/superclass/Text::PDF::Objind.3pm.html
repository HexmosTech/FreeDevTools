</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Text::PDF::Objind - PDF indirect object reference. Also acts as an abstract superclass for all elements
       in a PDF file.

</pre><h4><b>INSTANCE</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       Instance variables differ from content variables in that they all start with a space.

       parent
           For  an  object  which  is  a  reference to an object in some source, this holds the reference to the
           source object, so that should the reference have to be de-referenced, then we know where  to  go  and
           get the info.

       objnum (R)
           The object number in the source (only for object references)

       objgen (R)
           The object generation in the source

           There are other instance variables which are used by the parent for file control.

       isfree
           This  marks  whether  the  object  is  in  the  free  list and available for re-use as another object
           elsewhere in the file.

       nextfree
           Holds a direct reference to the next free object in the free list.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Text::PDF::Objind-&gt;new()</b>
       Creates a new indirect object

   <b>uid</b>
       Returns a Unique id for this object, creating one if it didn't have one before

   <b>$r-&gt;release</b>
       Releases ALL of the memory used by this indirect object, and all of its  component/child  objects.   This
       method is called automatically by '"Text::PDF::File-&gt;release"' (so you don't have to call it yourself).

       <b>NOTE</b>,  that  it is important that this method get called at some point prior to the actual destruction of
       the object.  Internally, PDF files have an enormous amount of cross-references and this  causes  circular
       references  within  our  own  internal  data  structures.   Calling  '"release()"'  forces these circular
       references to be cleaned up and the entire internal data structure purged.

       <b>Developer</b> <b>note:</b> As part of the brute-force cleanup done here, this method will throw  a  warning  message
       whenever  unexpected  key  values  are found within the "Text::PDF::Objind" object.  This is done to help
       ensure that unexpected and unfreed values are brought to your attention, so you can bug us  to  keep  the
       module  updated  properly;  otherwise  the potential for memory leaks due to dangling circular references
       will exist.

   <b>$r-&gt;val</b>
       Returns the val of this object or reads the object and then returns its value.

       Note that all direct subclasses *must* make their own versions of this subroutine otherwise we  could  be
       in for a very deep loop!

   <b>$r-&gt;realise</b>
       Makes sure that the object is fully read in, etc.

   <b>$r-&gt;outobjdeep($fh,</b> <b>$pdf)</b>
       If  you really want to output this object, then you must need to read it first.  This also means that all
       direct subclasses must subclass this method or loop forever!

   <b>$r-&gt;outobj($fh)</b>
       If this is a full object then outputs a reference to the object, otherwise calls outobjdeep to output the
       contents of the object at this point.

   <b>$r-&gt;elementsof</b>
       Abstract superclass function filler. Returns self here but should return  something  more  useful  if  an
       array.

   <b>$r-&gt;empty</b>
       Empties  all  content  from  this object to free up memory or to be read to pass the object into the free
       list. Simplistically undefs all instance variables other than object number and generation.

   <b>$r-&gt;merge($objind)</b>
       This merges content information into an object  reference  place-holder.   This  occurs  when  an  object
       reference  is  read  before the object definition and the information in the read data needs to be merged
       into the object place-holder

   <b>$r-&gt;is_obj($pdf)</b>
       Returns whether this object is a full object with its own object number or whether it is  purely  a  sub-
       object. $pdf indicates which output file we are concerned that the object is an object in.

   <b>$r-&gt;copy($inpdf,</b> <b>$res,</b> <b>$unique,</b> <b>$outpdf,</b> <b>%opts)</b>
       Returns a new copy of this object.

       $inpdf  gives  the  source  pdf  object for the object to be copied. $outpdf gives the target pdf for the
       object to be copied into. $outpdf may be undefined. $res may be defined  in  which  case  the  object  is
       copied  into  that object. $unique controls recursion. if $unique is non zero then new objects are always
       created and recursion always occurs. But each time recursion occurs,  $unique  is  incremented.  Thus  is
       $unique  starts  with a negative value it is possible to stop the recursion at a certain depth. Of course
       for a positive value of $unique, recursion always occurs.

       If $unique is 0 then recursion only occurs if $outpdf is not the same as $inpdf. In this case, a cache is
       held in $outpdf to see whether a previous copy of the same  object  has  been  made.  If  so,  then  that
       previous copy is returned otherwise a new object is made and added to the cache and recursed into.

       Objects  that  are  full objects with their own id numbers are correspondingly full objects in the output
       pdf.
