</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       ZoneMinder::Control::Amcrest_HTTP - Amcrest camera control

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module contains the implementation of the Amcrest Camera controllable SDK API.

       NOTE: This module implements interaction with the camera in clear text.

       The login and password are transmitted from ZM to the camera in clear text, and as such, this module
       should be used ONLY on a blind LAN implementation where interception of the packets is very low risk.

       The "usleep (X);" lines throughout the script may need adjustments for your situation.  This is the time
       that the script waits between sending a "start" and a "stop" signal to the camera.  For example, the pan
       left arrow would result in the camera panning full to its leftmost position if there were no stop signal.
       So the usleep time sets how long the script waits to allow the camera to start moving before issuing a
       stop.  The X value of usleep is in microseconds, so "usleep (100000);" is equivalent to wait one second.
