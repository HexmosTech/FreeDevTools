</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Net::LDAP::Control - LDAPv3 control object base class

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        use Net::LDAP::Control;
        use Net::LDAP::Constant qw( LDAP_CONTROL_MANAGEDSAIT );

        my $req_ctrl1 = Net::LDAP::Control-&gt;new( type =&gt; LDAP_CONTROL_MANAGEDSAIT );
        my $req_ctrl2 = Net::LDAP::Control-&gt;new(
          type     =&gt; "1.2.3.4",
          value    =&gt; "help",
          critical =&gt; 0
        );

        $mesg = $ldap-&gt;search( @args, control =&gt; [ $req_ctrl1, $req_ctrl2 ]);

        my @res_ctrls = $mesg-&gt;control();

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       "Net::LDAP::Control" is the base-class for LDAPv3 control objects.

       Controls provide a mechanism that allows one to extend the semantics and arguments of LDAP operations.
       Controls may be attached to LDAP operations, and only affect the semantics of the operation they are
       attached to.

       Controls sent by clients are termed <u>request</u> <u>controls</u>, and are set using the "control" option of the
       respective LDAP operations.  Controls sent by servers are called <u>response</u> <u>controls</u>, they can be found
       using the "control()" method of the response message objects.

       Servers announce the controls they support in the attribute "supportedControls" in their RootDSE.

</pre><h4><b>CONSTRUCTORS</b></h4><pre>
       new ( ARGS )
           ARGS is a list of name/value pairs, valid arguments are:

           critical
               A  Boolean  value,  if TRUE and the control is unrecognized by the server or is inappropriate for
               the requested operation then the server will return an  error  and  the  operation  will  not  be
               performed.

               If  FALSE  and  the  control  is unrecognized by the server or is inappropriate for the requested
               operation then the server will ignore the control and perform the requested operation as  if  the
               control was not given.

               If absent, FALSE is assumed.

           type
               A  dotted-decimal  representation  of an OBJECT IDENTIFIER which uniquely identifies the control.
               This prevents conflicts between control names.

               This may be omitted if the constructor is being called on a sub-class of Net::LDAP::Control which
               has registered to be associated with  an  OID.   If  the  constructor  is  being  called  on  the
               Net::LDAP::Control  package,  then  this  argument  must  be  given.   If  the given OID has been
               registered by a package, then the returned object will be of the type registered to  handle  that
               OID.

           value
               Optional  information  associated  with  the  control.  Its  format is specific to the particular
               control.

       from_asn ( ASN )
           ASN is a HASH reference, normally extracted from  a  PDU.  It  will  contain  a  "type"  element  and
           optionally  "critical"  and "value" elements. On return ASN will be blessed into a package. If "type"
           is a registered OID, then ASN will be blessed into the registered package, if not then  ASN  will  be
           blessed into Net::LDAP::Control.

           This  constructor  is  used  internally  by  Net::LDAP  and assumes that HASH passed contains a valid
           control. It should be used with <b>caution</b>.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       In addition to the methods listed below, each of the named parameters to "new" is  also  available  as  a
       method.  "type" will return the OID of the control object. "value" and "critical" are set/get methods and
       will return the current value for each attribute if called without arguments, but may also be called with
       arguments to set new values.

       error ()
           If there has been an error returns a description of the error, otherwise it will return "undef"

       init ()
           "init" will be called as the last step in both constructors. What it does will  depend  on  the  sub-
           class. It must always return the object.

       register ( OID )
           "register"  is  provided  for sub-class implementors. It should be called as a class method on a sub-
           class of Net::LDAP::Control with the OID that the class will handle. Net::LDAP::Control will remember
           this class and OID pair and use it in the following situations.

           •   "new" is called as a class method on the Net::LDAP::Control package and  OID  is  passed  as  the
               type. The returned object will be blessed into the package that registered the OID.

           •   "new"  is  called  as a class method on a registered package and the "type" is not specified. The
               "type" will be set to the OID registered by that package.

           •   "from_asn" is called to construct an object from ASN. The returned object will  be  blessed  into
               the package which was registered to handle the OID in the ASN.

       ( to_asn )
           Returns a structure suitable for passing to Convert::ASN1 for encoding. This method will be called by
           Net::LDAP when the control is used.

           The  base class implementation of this method will call the "value" method without arguments to allow
           a sub-class to encode it's value. Sub-classes should not need to override this method.

       valid ()
           Returns true if the object is valid and can be encoded. The default implementation for this method is
           to return TRUE if there is no error, but sub-classes may override that.
