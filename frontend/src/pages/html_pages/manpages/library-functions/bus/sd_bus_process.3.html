       sd_bus_process - Drive the connection

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;systemd/sd-bus.h&gt;</b>

       <b>int</b> <b>sd_bus_process(sd_bus</b> <b>*</b><u>bus</u><b>,</b> <b>sd_bus_message</b> <b>**</b><u>ret</u><b>);</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>sd_bus_process()</b> drives the connection between the client and the message bus. That is, it handles
       connecting, authentication, and processing of messages. When invoked, pending I/O work is executed, and
       queued incoming messages are dispatched to registered callbacks. Each time it is invoked a single
       operation is executed. It returns zero when no operations were pending and positive if a message was
       processed. When zero is returned the caller should poll for I/O events before calling into
       <b>sd_bus_process()</b> again. For that either use the simple, blocking <b><a href="../man3/sd_bus_wait.3.html">sd_bus_wait</a></b>(3) call, or hook up the bus
       connection object to an external or manual event loop using <b><a href="../man3/sd_bus_get_fd.3.html">sd_bus_get_fd</a></b>(3).

       <b>sd_bus_process()</b> processes at most one incoming message per call. If the parameter <u>ret</u> is not <b>NULL</b> and
       the call processed a message, <u>*ret</u> is set to this message. The caller owns a reference to this message
       and should call <b><a href="../man3/sd_bus_message_unref.3.html">sd_bus_message_unref</a></b>(3) when the message is no longer needed. If <u>ret</u> is not <b>NULL</b> and
       progress was made, but no message was processed, <u>*ret</u> is set to <b>NULL</b>. Note that only messages not already
       handled by the various types of registered message handlers (i.e. by filters registered via
       <b><a href="../man3/sd_bus_add_filter.3.html">sd_bus_add_filter</a></b>(3), object handlers registered via <b><a href="../man3/sd_bus_add_object.3.html">sd_bus_add_object</a></b>(3), matches registered via
       <b><a href="../man3/sd_bus_add_match.3.html">sd_bus_add_match</a></b>(3), and related) will be returned through this parameter. Also note that if such a
       message handler returns a zero return value (as opposed to some value &gt; 0) an incoming message will not
       be considered handled, and be passed to other suitable handlers (until one returns &gt; &gt; 0), or returned by
       <b>sd_bus_process()</b> (in case none returns &gt; 0).

       If the bus object is connected to an <b><a href="../man3/sd-event.3.html">sd-event</a></b>(3) event loop (with <b><a href="../man3/sd_bus_attach_event.3.html">sd_bus_attach_event</a></b>(3)), it is not
       necessary to call <b>sd_bus_process()</b> directly as it is invoked automatically when necessary.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       If progress was made, a positive integer is returned. If no progress was made, 0 is returned. If an error
       occurs, a negative <u>errno</u>-style error code is returned.

   <b>Errors</b>
       Returned errors may indicate the following problems:

       <b>-EINVAL</b>
           An invalid bus object was passed.

       <b>-ECHILD</b>
           The bus connection was allocated in a parent process and is being reused in a child process after
           <b>fork()</b>.

       <b>-ENOTCONN</b>
           The bus connection has been terminated already.

       <b>-ECONNRESET</b>
           The bus connection has been terminated just now.

       <b>-EBUSY</b>
           This function is already being called, i.e.  <b>sd_bus_process()</b> has been called from a callback
           function that itself was called by <b>sd_bus_process()</b>.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       Functions described here are available as a shared library, which can be compiled against and linked to
       with the <b>libsystemd</b> <b><a href="../man1/pkg-config.1.html">pkg-config</a></b>(1) file.

       The code described here uses <b><a href="../man3/getenv.3.html">getenv</a></b>(3), which is declared to be not multi-thread-safe. This means that
       the code calling the functions described here must not call <b><a href="../man3/setenv.3.html">setenv</a></b>(3) from a parallel thread. It is
       recommended to only do calls to <b>setenv()</b> from an early phase of the program when no other threads have
       been started.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       <b>sd_bus_process()</b> was added in version 221.
