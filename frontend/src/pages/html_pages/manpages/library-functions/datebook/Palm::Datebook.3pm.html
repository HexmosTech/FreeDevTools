</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Palm::Datebook - Handler for Palm OS DateBook and Calendar databases

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This document describes version 1.400 of Palm::Datebook, released March 14, 2015 as part of Palm version
       1.400.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Palm::Datebook;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The Datebook PDB handler is a helper class for the Palm::PDB package.  It parses DateBook and Calendar
       databases.

   <b>AppInfo</b> <b>block</b>
       The AppInfo block begins with standard category support. See Palm::StdAppInfo for details.

   <b>Sort</b> <b>block</b>
           $pdb-&gt;{sort}

       This is a scalar, the raw data of the sort block.

   <b>Records</b>
           $record = $pdb-&gt;{records}[N]

           $record-&gt;{day}
           $record-&gt;{month}
           $record-&gt;{year}

       The day, month and year of the event. The day and month start at 1 (<u>i.e.</u>, for January, "$record-&gt;{month}"
       is set to 1). The year is a four-digit number (for dates in 2001, "$record-&gt;{year}" is "2001").

       For repeating events, these fields specify the first date at which the event occurs.

           $record-&gt;{start_hour}
           $record-&gt;{start_minute}
           $record-&gt;{end_hour}
           $record-&gt;{end_minute}

       The start and end times of the event. For untimed events, all of these are 0xff.

           $record-&gt;{when_changed}

       This is defined and true iff the "when info" for the record has changed. I don't know what this means.

           $record-&gt;{alarm}{advance}
           $record-&gt;{alarm}{unit}

       If the record has an alarm associated with it, the %{$record-&gt;{alarm}} hash exists. The "unit" subfield
       is an integer: 0 for minutes, 1 for hours, 2 for days. The "advance" subfield specifies how many units
       before the event the alarm should ring.  <u>e.g.</u>, if "unit" is 1 and "advance" is 5, then the alarm will
       sound 5 hours before the event.

       If "advance" is -1, then there is no alarm associated with this event.  New records created via
       "new_Record" have a 10 minute alarm set by default. "undef $record-&gt;{alarm}" to remove this alarm before
       writing.  An alarm icon will still show up in the Datebook if the "alarm" field exists, even with
       "advance" set to -1.

           %{ $record-&gt;{repeat} }

       This exists iff this is a repeating event.

           $record-&gt;{repeat}{type}

       An integer which specifies the type of repeat:

       0   no repeat.

       1   a daily event, one that occurs every day.

       2   a  weekly  event,  one  that occurs every week on the same day(s). An event may occur on several days
           every week, <u>e.g.</u>, every Monday, Wednesday and Friday.

           For weekly events, the following fields are defined:

               @{ $record-&gt;{repeat}{repeat_days} }

           This is an array of 7 elements; each element is true iff the event occurs on the  corresponding  day.
           Element 0 is Sunday, element 1 is Monday, and so forth.

               $record-&gt;{repeat}{start_of_week}

           Day  the  week  starts  on (0 for Sunday, 1 for Monday). This affects the phase of events that repeat
           every 2nd (or more) Sunday.

       3   a "monthly by day" event, <u>e.g.</u>, one that occurs on the second Friday of every month.

           For "monthly by day" events, the following fields are defined:

               $record-&gt;{repeat}{weeknum}

           The number of the week on which the event occurs. 0 means the first week of the month,  1  means  the
           second week of the month, and so forth.  A value of 5 means that the event occurs on the last week of
           the month.

               $record-&gt;{repeat}{daynum}

           An  integer,  the  day  of the week on which the event occurs. 0 means Sunday, 1 means Monday, and so
           forth.

       4   a "monthly by date" event, <u>e.g.</u>, one that occurs on the 12th of every month.

       5   a yearly event, <u>e.g.</u>, one that occurs every year on December 25th.

               $record-&gt;{repeat}{frequency}

           Specifies  the  frequency  of  the  repeat.  For  instance,  if  the  event  is  a  daily  one,   and
           $record-&gt;{repeat}{frequency} is 3, then the event occurs every 3 days.

           $record-&gt;{repeat}{unknown}

       I don't know what this is.

           $record-&gt;{repeat}{end_day}
           $record-&gt;{repeat}{end_month}
           $record-&gt;{repeat}{end_year}

       The last day, month and year on which the event occurs.

           @{ $record-&gt;{exceptions} }
           $day   = $record-&gt;{exceptions}[N][0]
           $month = $record-&gt;{exceptions}[N][1]
           $year  = $record-&gt;{exceptions}[N][2]

       If there are any exceptions to a repeating event, <u>e.g.</u> a weekly meeting that was cancelled one time, then
       the @{$record-&gt;{exceptions}} array is defined.

       Each  element in this array is a reference to an anonymous array with three elements: the day, month, and
       year of the exception.

           $record-&gt;{description}

       A text string, the description of the event.

           $record-&gt;{location}

       A text string, the location (if any) of the event (Calendar database only).

           $record-&gt;{note}

       A text string, the note (if any) attached to the event.

           %{ $record-&gt;{timezone} }

       This exists iff a time zone has been set for the event.

           $record-&gt;{timezone}{name}

       The time zone name, <u>e.g.</u>, "London" or "San Francisco".

           $record-&gt;{timezone}{country}

       The country the time zone is in. This is an integer defined in Core/System/PalmLocale.h.

           $record-&gt;{timezone}{offset}

       This gives the offset from UTC, in minutes, of the time zone.

           $record-&gt;{timezone}{dst_adjustment}

       This gives the additional offset while daylight savings time is  in  effect.   The  offset  from  UTC  is
       $record-&gt;{timezone}{offset} + $record-&gt;{timezone}{dst_adjustment} (actually only 0 or 60 are used).

           $record-&gt;{timezone}{custom}

       Should indicate whether this location was created by the user, though this always seems to be true.

           $record-&gt;{timezone}{flags}

       Reserved flags.

           $record-&gt;{timezone}{start_hour}
           $record-&gt;{timezone}{start_daynum}
           $record-&gt;{timezone}{start_weeknum}
           $record-&gt;{timezone}{start_month}
           $record-&gt;{timezone}{end_hour}
           $record-&gt;{timezone}{end_daynum}
           $record-&gt;{timezone}{end_weeknum}
           $record-&gt;{timezone}{end_month}

       These    define    the    period    during    which    daylight    savings   time   is   in   effect   if
       $record-&gt;{timezone}{dst_adjustment} is non-zero.  daynum specifies the day of week (0=Sunday, 6=Saturday)
       and weeknum specifies the week of month (0=1st, 3=4th, 4=last),  analagously  to  the  "monthly  by  day"
       repeating  event.   <u>e.g.</u>,  The  "London" time zone has DST starting on the last Sunday of March, which is
       indicated with start_daynum=0 (Sunday), start_weeknum=4 (last  week  of  the  month),  and  start_month=3
       (March).

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>new</b>
         $pdb = new Palm::Datebook;
         $pdb = new Palm::Datebook({app =&gt; 'Calendar'});

       Create  a new PDB, initialized with the various Palm::Datebook fields and an empty record list. Creates a
       Datebook PDB by default.  Specify the app parameter as 'Calendar' to create a Calendar PDB.

   <b>new_Record</b>
         $record = $pdb-&gt;new_Record;

       Creates a new Datebook record, with blank values for all of the fields.

       "new_Record" does <b>not</b> add the new record to $pdb. For that, you want "$pdb-&gt;append_Record".
