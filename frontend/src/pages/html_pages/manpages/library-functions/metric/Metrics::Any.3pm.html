</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       "Metrics::Any" - abstract collection of monitoring metrics

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       In a module:

          use Metrics::Any '$metrics',
             strict =&gt; 0,
             name_prefix =&gt; [ 'my_module_name' ];

          sub do_thing {
             $metrics-&gt;inc_counter( 'things_done' );
          }

       In a program or top-level program-like module:

          use Metrics::Any::Adapter 'Prometheus';

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Provides a central location for modules to report monitoring metrics, such as counters of the number of
       times interesting events have happened, and programs to collect up and send those metrics to monitoring
       services.

       Inspired by Log::Any, this module splits the overall problem into two sides. Modules wishing to provide
       metrics for monitoring purposes can use the "use Metrics::Any" statement to obtain a <u>collector</u> into which
       they can report metric events. By default this collector doesn't actually do anything, so modules can
       easily use it without adding extra specific dependencies for specific reporting.

       A program using one or more such modules can apply a different policy and request a particular <u>adapter</u>
       implementation in order to actually report these metrics to some external system, by using the "use
       Metrics::Any::Adapter" statement.

       This separation of concerns allows module authors to write code which will report metrics without needing
       to care about the exact mechanism of that reporting (as well as to write code which does not itself
       depend on the code required to perform that reporting).

   <b>Future</b> <b>Direction</b>
       At present this interface is in an early state of experimentation. The API is fairly specifically-shaped
       for Net::Prometheus at present, but it is hoped with more adapter implementations (such as for statsd or
       OpenTelemetry) the API shapes can be expanded and made more generic to support a wider variety of
       reporting mechanisms.

       As a result, any API details for now should be considered experimental and subject to change in later
       versions.

</pre><h4><b>USE</b> <b>STATEMENT</b></h4><pre>
       For a module to use this facility, the "use" statement importing it should give the name of a variable
       (as a plain string) to store the collector for that package.

          use Metrics::Any '$metrics';

       This variable will be created in the calling package and populated with an instance of
       Metrics::Any::Collector. The module can then use the collector API to declare new metrics, and eventually
       report values into them.

       Note that the variable is created at the package level; any other packages within the same file will not
       see it and will have to declare their own.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       •   The  name  and  overall concept of this module is heavily influenced by a similar module for logging,
           Log::Any.

       •   For reporting metrics to one specific target collector, there are specific modules for  systems  like
           <u>statsd</u> (Net::Statsd, Net::Async::Statsd) or <u>prometheus</u> (Prometheus::Tiny, Net::Prometheus).

       •   There is also a similar concept in Measure::Everything.
