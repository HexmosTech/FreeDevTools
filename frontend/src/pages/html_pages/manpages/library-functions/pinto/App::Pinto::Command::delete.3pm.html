</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       App::Pinto::Command::delete - permanently remove an archive

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 0.14

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         pinto --root=REPOSITORY_ROOT delete [OPTIONS] TARGET ...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       !! THIS COMMAND IS EXPERIMENTAL !!

       <b>IMPORTANT:</b>  This command is dangerous.  If you just want to remove packages or distributions from a
       stack, then you should probably be looking at the unregister command instead.

       This command permanently removes an archive from the repository, thereby unregistering it from all stacks
       and wiping it from all history (as if it had never been put in the repository).  Beware that once an
       archive is deleted it cannot be recovered.  There will be no record that the archive was ever added or
       deleted, and this change cannot be undone.

       To merely remove packages from a stack (while preserving the archive), use the unregister command.

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND</b> <b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Arguments are the targets that you want to delete.  Targets are specified as "AUTHOR/FILENAME".  For
       example:

         SHAKESPEARE/King-Lear-1.2.tar.gz

       You can also pipe arguments to this command over STDIN.  In that case, blank lines and lines that look
       like comments (i.e. starting with "#" or ';') will be ignored.

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       --force
           Deletes  the  archive  even  if  its  packages are pinned to a stack.  Take care when deleting pinned
           packages, as it usually means that particular package is important to someone.
