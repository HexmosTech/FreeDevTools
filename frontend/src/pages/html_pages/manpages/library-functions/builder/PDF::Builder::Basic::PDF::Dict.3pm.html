</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       PDF::Builder::Basic::PDF::Dict - PDF Dictionaries and Streams. Inherits from
       PDF::Builder::Basic::PDF::Objind

</pre><h4><b>INSTANCE</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       There are various special instance variables which are used to look after, particularly, streams. Each
       begins with a space:

       ' stream'
           Holds the stream contents for output

       ' streamfile'
           Holds  the  stream  contents in an external file rather than in memory. This is not the same as a PDF
           file stream. The data is stored in its unfiltered form.

       ' streamloc'
           If both ' stream' and ' streamfile' are empty, this indicates where in  the  source  PDF  the  stream
           starts.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>new</b>
           $d = PDF::Builder::Basic::PDF-&gt;new()

           Creates a new instance of a dictionary. The usual practice is to call "PDFDict()" instead.

   <b>type</b>
           $type = $d-&gt;type($type)

           Get/Set  the  standard  Type  key. It can be passed, and will return, a text value rather than a Name
           object.

   <b>filter</b>
           @filters = $d-&gt;filter(@filters)

           Get/Set one or more filters being used by the optional stream attached to the dictionary.

   <b>outobjdeep</b>
           $d-&gt;outobjdeep($fh, $pdf)

           Outputs the contents of the dictionary to a PDF file. This is a recursive call.

           It also outputs a stream if the dictionary has a stream element. If this occurs then this method will
           calculate the length of the stream and insert it into the stream's dictionary.

   <b>read_stream</b>
           $d-&gt;read_stream($force_memory)

           Reads in a stream from a PDF file. If the stream is greater than "PDF::Dict::mincache"  (defaults  to
           32768)  bytes  to  be stored, then the default action is to create a file for it somewhere and to use
           that file as a data cache. If $force_memory is set, this caching will not occur and the data will all
           be stored in the $self-&gt;{' stream'} variable.

   <b>val</b>
           $d-&gt;val()

           Returns the dictionary, which is itself.
