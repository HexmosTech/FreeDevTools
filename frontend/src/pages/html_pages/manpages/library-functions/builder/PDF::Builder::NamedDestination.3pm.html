       PDF::Builder::NamedDestination - Add named destinations (views) to a PDF

       Inherits from PDF::Builder::Basic::PDF::Dict

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>new</b>
           $dest = PDF::Builder::NamedDestination-&gt;new($pdf, ...)

           Creates a new named destination object. Any optional additional arguments will be passed on to
           "destination".

   <b>Destination</b> <b>types</b>
       <u>dest</u>

           $dest-&gt;dest($page, %opts)

           A destination (dest) is a particular view of a PDF, consisting of a page object, the location of the
           window on that page, and possible coordinate and zoom arguments.

               # The XYZ location takes three arguments
               my $dest1 = PDF::Builder::NamedDestination-&gt;new($pdf);
               $dest-&gt;dest($pdf-&gt;<a href="../man1/open_page.1.html">open_page</a>(1), 'xyz' =&gt; [$x, $y, $zoom]);

               # The Fit location doesn't require any arguments, but one is still
               # needed for the hash array
               my $dest2 = PDF::Builder::NamedDestination-&gt;new($pdf);
               $dest-&gt;dest($pdf-&gt;<a href="../man2/open_page.2.html">open_page</a>(2), 'fit' =&gt; 1);

           See "Page Fit Options" in PDF::Builder::Docs for a listing of the available locations and their
           syntax.

           "xyz" is the <b>default</b> fit setting, with position (left and top) and zoom the same as the calling
           page's.

   <b>Target</b> <b>Destinations</b>
       <u>link,</u> <u>goto</u>

           $dest-&gt;link($page, %opts)

           A go-to (link) action changes the view to a specified destination (page, location, and magnification
           factor).

           Parameters are as described in "dest".

           <b>Alternate</b> <b>name:</b> "goto"

           Originally this method was "link", but recently PDF::API2 changed the name to "goto". "goto" is added
           for compatibility.

       <u>uri,</u> <u>url</u>

           $dest-&gt;uri($url)

           Defines the destination as launch-url with uri $url.

           <b>Alternate</b> <b>name:</b> "url"

           Originally this method was "url", but recently PDF::API2 changed the name to "uri". "url" is retained
           for compatibility.

       <u>launch,</u> <u>file</u>

           $dest-&gt;launch($file)

           Defines the destination as launch-file with filepath $file and page-fit options %opts. The target
           application is run. Note that this is <b>not</b> a PDF <u>or</u> a browser file -- it is a local application.

           <b>Alternate</b> <b>name:</b> "file"

           Originally this method was "file", but recently PDF::API2 changed the name to "launch". "file" is
           retained for compatibility.

       <u>pdf,</u> <u>pdf_file,</u> <u>pdfile</u>

           $dest-&gt;pdf($pdf_file, $pagenum, %opts)

           Defines the destination as a PDF-file with filepath $pdf_file, on page $pagenum, and options %opts
           (same as <b>dest()</b>).

           <b>Alternate</b> <b>names:</b> "pdf_file" and "pdfile"

           Originally this method was "pdfile", and had been earlier renamed to "pdf_file", but recently
           PDF::API2 changed the name to "pdf". "pdfile" and "pdf_file" are retained for compatibility. <b>Note</b>
           <b>that</b> the position and zoom information is still given as a hash element in PDF::Builder, while
           PDF::API2 has changed to a position string and an array of dimensions.
