</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       PDF::Builder::Basic::PDF::Page - Represents a PDF page

       Inherits from PDF::Builder::Basic::PDF::Pages

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Represents a page of output in PDF. It also keeps track of the content stream, any resources (such as
       fonts) being switched, etc.

       Page inherits from Pages due to a number of shared methods. They are really structurally quite different.

</pre><h4><b>INSTANCE</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       A page has various working variables:

       ' curstrm'
           The currently open stream

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>new</b>
           PDF::Builder::Basic::PDF::Page-&gt;new($pdf, $parent, $index)

           Creates a new page based on a pages object (perhaps the root object).

           The  page  is  also  added to the parent at this point, so pages are ordered in a PDF document in the
           order in which they are created rather than in the order they are closed.

           Only the essential elements in the page dictionary are created here, all others are  either  optional
           or can be inherited.

           The optional index value indicates the index in the parent list that this page should be inserted (so
           that new pages need not be appended)

   <b>ship_out</b>
           $p-&gt;ship_out($pdf)

           Ships the page out to the given output file context
