</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Bio::MAGE::Experiment - Container module for classes in the MAGE package: Experiment

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Bio::MAGE::Experiment;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This is a <u>package</u> module that encapsulates a number of classes in the Bio::MAGE hierarchy. These classes
       belong to the Experiment package of the MAGE-OM object model.

</pre><h4><b>CLASSES</b></h4><pre>
       The Bio::MAGE::Experiment module contains the following Bio::MAGE classes:

       •   Experiment

       •   ExperimentDesign

       •   ExperimentalFactor

       •   FactorValue

</pre><h4><b>CLASS</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       @class_list = <b>Bio::MAGE::Experiment::classes()</b>;
           This method returns a list of non-fully qualified class names (i.e. they do not have 'Bio::MAGE::' as
           a prefix) in this package.

       $obj = class-&gt;new(%parameters)
           The "new()" method is the class constructor.

           <b>Parameters</b>:  if  given  a  list  of  name/value  parameters  the  corresponding slots, attributes, or
           associations will have their initial values set by the constructor.

           <b>Return</b> <b>value</b>: It returns a reference to an object of the class.

           <b>Side</b> <b>effects</b>: It invokes the "initialize()" method if it is defined by the class.

       @names = class-&gt;<b>get_slot_names()</b>
           The "get_slot_names()" method is used to retrieve the name of all slots defined in a given class.

           <b>NOTE</b>: the list of names does not include attribute or association names.

           <b>Return</b> <b>value</b>: A list of the names of all slots defined for this class.

           <b>Side</b> <b>effects</b>: none

       @name_list = <b>get_attribute_names()</b>
           returns the list of attribute data members for this class.

       @name_list = <b>get_association_names()</b>
           returns the list of association data members for this class.

       @class_list = <b>get_superclasses()</b>
           returns the list of superclasses for this class.

       @class_list = <b>get_subclasses()</b>
           returns the list of subclasses for this class.

       $name = <b>class_name()</b>
           Returns the full class name for this class.

       $package_name = <b>package_name()</b>
           Returns the base package name (i.e. no 'namespace::') of the package that contains this class.

       %assns = <b>associations()</b>
           returns the association meta-information in a hash where the keys are the association names  and  the
           values are "Association" objects that provide the meta-information for the association.

</pre><h4><b>INSTANCE</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       $obj_copy = $obj-&gt;<b>new()</b>
           When  invoked  with  an  existing object reference and not a class name, the "new()" method acts as a
           copy constructor - with the new object's initial values set to be those of the existing object.

           <b>Parameters</b>: No input parameters  are used in the copy  constructor,  the  initial  values  are  taken
           directly from the object to be copied.

           <b>Return</b> <b>value</b>: It returns a reference to an object of the class.

           <b>Side</b> <b>effects</b>: It invokes the "initialize()" method if it is defined by the class.

       $obj-&gt;set_slots(%parameters)
       $obj-&gt;set_slots(\@name_list, \@value_list)
           The  "set_slots()"  method  is  used  to set a number of slots at the same time. It has two different
           invocation methods. The first  takes  a  named  parameter  list,  and  the  second  takes  two  array
           references.

           <b>Return</b> <b>value</b>: none

           <b>Side</b> <b>effects</b>: will call "croak()" if a slot_name is used that the class does not define.

       @obj_list = $obj-&gt;get_slots(@name_list)
           The "get_slots()" method is used to get the values of a number of slots at the same time.

           <b>Return</b> <b>value</b>: a list of instance objects

           <b>Side</b> <b>effects</b>: none

       $val = $obj-&gt;set_slot($name,$val)
           The "set_slot()" method sets the slot $name to the value $val

           <b>Return</b> <b>value</b>: the new value of the slot, i.e. $val

           <b>Side</b> <b>effects</b>: none

       $val = $obj-&gt;get_slot($name)
           The "get_slot()" method is used to get the values of a number of slots at the same time.

           <b>Return</b> <b>value</b>: a single slot value, or undef if the slot has not been initialized.

           <b>Side</b> <b>effects</b>: none

       $val = $experiment-&gt;<b>xml_lists()</b>
       $inval = $experiment-&gt;xml_lists($inval)
           This is the unified setter/getter method for the xml_lists slot.

           If  $inval  is  specified,  the  setter  method  is invoked, with no parameters, the getter method is
           invoked.

           Input parameters: the optional $inval will invoke the setter method.

           Return value: for both setter and getter the current value of the xml_lists slot

           Side effects: none

           Exceptions: none

       $val = $experiment-&gt;<b>tagname()</b>
       $inval = $experiment-&gt;tagname($inval)
           This is the unified setter/getter method for the tagname slot.

           If $inval is specified, the setter method is invoked,  with  no  parameters,  the  getter  method  is
           invoked.

           Input parameters: the optional $inval will invoke the setter method.

           Return value: for both setter and getter the current value of the tagname slot

           Side effects: none

           Exceptions: none

       $val = $experiment-&gt;<b>experiment_list()</b>
       $inval = $experiment-&gt;experiment_list($inval)
           This is the unified setter/getter method for the experiment_list slot.

           If  $inval  is  specified,  the  setter  method  is invoked, with no parameters, the getter method is
           invoked.

           Input parameters: the optional $inval will invoke the setter method.

           Return value: for both setter and getter the current value of the experiment_list slot

           Side effects: none

           Exceptions: none

       $array_ref = $experiment-&gt;<b>getExperiment_list()</b>
           This method handles  the  list  for  the  "Bio::MAGE::Experiment::Experiment"  class.  It  returns  a
           reference to an array of the class objects that have been associated with the package instance.

           This is useful when retrieving data from parsed MAGE-ML file.

       $experiment-&gt;addExperiment(@vals)
           This   method   is  an  interface  for  adding  "Bio::MAGE::Experiment::Experiment"  objects  to  the
           "experiment_list" list. It is generally used by generic methods such as those in the XMLWriter.

           Input parameters: the list of values @vals to add to the owner association. <b>NOTE</b>: submitting a single
           value is permitted.

           Return value: none

           Side effects: none

           Exceptions: will call "croak()" if no input parameters are specified , or if any of  the  objects  in
           @vals is not a subclass of class "Bio::MAGE::Experiment::Experiment"

       $experiment-&gt;obj2xml($writer)
           Write  out this object, and all sub-objects, as XML using the supplied $writer to actually do the XML
           formatting.

           Input parameters: $writer must be an XML writer, e.g. an instance of Bio::MAGE::XML::Writer. It  must
           have methods: <b>write_start_tag()</b>, <b>write_end_tag()</b>, and <b>obj2xml()</b>.

           Return value: none

           Side  effects:  all  writing is delegated to the $writer - it's <b>write_start_tag()</b> and <b>write_end_tag()</b>
           methods  are  invoked   with   the   appropriate   data,   and   all   class   sub-objects   of   the
           "Bio::MAGE::Experiment"  instance  will have their <b>obj2xml()</b> methods invoked in turn. By allowing the
           $writer to do the actual formatting of the output XML, it enables the user to precisely  control  the
           format.

           Exceptions:  will  call  "croak()"  if  no  identifier  has  been set for the "Bio::MAGE::Experiment"
           instance.

       $experiment-&gt;register($obj)
           Store an object for later writing as XML.

           Input parameters: object to be added to the list of registered objects.

           Return value: none

           Side effects: if $obj needs to be stored by this class, a reference will be stored in the correct XML
           list for this class.

           Exceptions: none

</pre><h4><b>SLOTS,</b> <b>ATTRIBUTES,</b> <b>AND</b> <b>ASSOCIATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       In the Perl implementation of MAGE-OM classes, there are three types  of  class  data  members:  "slots",
       "attributes", and "associations".

   <b>SLOTS</b>
       This  API  uses  the  term  "slot" to indicate a data member of the class that was not present in the UML
       model and is used for mainly internal purposes - use only if you understand the  inner  workings  of  the
       API. Most often slots are used by generic methods such as those in the XML writing and reading classes.

       Slots are implemented using unified getter/setter methods:

       $var = $obj-&gt;<b>slot_name()</b>;
           Retrieves the current value of the slot.

       $new_var = $obj-&gt;slot_name($new_var);
           Store $new_var in the slot - the return value is also $new_var.

       @names = $obj-&gt;<b>get_slot_names()</b>
           Returns the list of all slots in the class.

       <b>DATA</b> <b>CHECKING</b>: No data type checking is made for these methods.

   <b>ATTRIBUTES</b> <b>AND</b> <b>ASSOCIATIONS</b>
       The  terms  "attribute" and "association" indicate data members of the class that were specified directly
       from the UML model.

       In the Perl implementation of MAGE-OM classes, association and attribute accessors are implemented  using
       three separate methods:

       get*
           Retrieves the current value.

           <b>NOTE</b>: For associations, if the association has list cardinality, an array reference is returned.

           <b>DATA</b> <b>CHECKING</b>: Ensure that no argument is provided.

       set*
           Sets the current value, <b>replacing</b> any existing value.

           <b>NOTE</b>:  For  associations,  if  the  association  has  list cardinality, the argument must be an array
           reference. Because of this, you probably should be using the add* methods.

           <b>DATA</b> <b>CHECKING</b>: For attributes,  ensure  that  a  single  value  is  provided  as  the  argument.  For
           associations,  if the association has list cardinality, ensure that the argument is a reference to an
           array of instances of the correct MAGE-OM class, otherwise ensure that there is a single argument  of
           the correct MAGE-OM class.

       add*
           <b>NOTE</b>: Only present in associations with list cardinality.

           Appends a list of objects to any values that may already be stored in the association.

           <b>DATA</b> <b>CHECKING</b>: Ensure that all arguments are of the correct MAGE-OM class.

   <b>GENERIC</b> <b>METHODS</b>
       The  unified base class of all MAGE-OM classes, "Bio::MAGE::Base", provides a set of generic methods that
       will operate on slots, attributes, and associations:

       $val = $obj-&gt;get_slot($name)
       \@list_ref = $obj-&gt;get_slots(@name_list);
       $val = $obj-&gt;set_slot($name,$val)
       $obj-&gt;set_slots(%parameters)
       $obj-&gt;set_slots(\@name_list, \@value_list)
           See elsewhere in this page for a detailed description of these methods.
