</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       DebianNet - create, remove, enable or disable entry in /etc/inetd.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       You can use the functions in <b>DebianNet</b> to to add, remove, enable or disable entries in the
       <u>/etc/inetd.conf</u> file. After the <u>/etc/inetd.conf</u> file has been changed, a <b>SIGHUP</b> signal will be sent to
       the inetd process to make sure that inetd will use the new <u>/etc/inetd.conf</u> file.  The functions can also
       be used to add entries that are commented out by default. They will be treated like normal entries. That
       also means that if you already have an entry that is commented out you can't add an entry for the same
       service without removing the old one first.

       The <b>DebianNet</b> functions treat entries that are commented out by a single '<b>#</b>' character as entries that
       have been commented out by a user. It will not change such entries.

       For shell scripts you can also use the <b>update-inetd</b> command. See <b><a href="../man8/update-inetd.8.html">update-inetd</a></b>(8) for further information.

</pre><h4><b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       $DebianNet::INETD_CONF
           Contains a scalar filename to use as the inetd config file (e.g. for testing purposes).

           Defaults to <u>/etc/inetd.conf</u>.

       $DebianNet::SEP
           Contains  the entry comment characters. This is only necessary if you have to deal with two (or more)
           services of the same name.

           Defaults to "<b>#&lt;off&gt;#</b> " as the comment characters.

       $DebianNet::MULTI
           Contains a boolean that decides whether to disable/remove more than one entry at a time. If  you  try
           to remove more than one entry at a time without using this option the program will show a warning and
           will ask the user whether to continue.

           Defaults to false.

       $DebianNet::VERBOSE
           Contains a boolean to select whether to explain verbosely what is being done.

           Defaults to false.

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       $rc = DebianNet::add_service($newentry, $group)
           Add  $newentry to the group $group of the <u>/etc/inetd.conf</u> file. If the entry already exist it will be
           enabled (it will also detect entries with different program options). Using $group is  optional  (the
           default group is the group OTHER). If the group does not exist the entry will be placed at the end of
           the file.

           Returns  1  on  success,  and  -1  on  failure. This function might call <b>exit</b>() due to debconf prompt
           answers.

       $rc = DebianNet::remove_service($entry)
           Remove $entry from <u>/etc/inetd.conf</u>. You can use a regular expression to remove the entry.

           Returns 1 on success, and -1 on failure.

       $rc = DebianNet::disable_service($service, $pattern)
           Disable $service (e.g. "<u>ftp</u>") in <u>/etc/inetd.conf</u>. Using $pattern is optional (see <b>enable_service()</b>).

           Returns 1 on success, and -1 on failure.

       $rc = DebianNet::enable_service($service, $pattern)
           Enable $service (e.g. "<u>ftp</u>") in <u>/etc/inetd.conf</u>. Using $pattern is optional. It can be used to select
           a service. You only need this option if you have two (or more) services of the same name.

           An example: you have three <u>ftp</u> entries in the <u>/etc/inetd.conf</u> file (all disabled by default) and  you
           want  to  enable the entry which uses the <u>vsftpd</u> daemon. To do this, use the pattern "<u>vsftpd</u>" (or any
           other regular expression that matches this entry).

           Returns 1 on success, and -1 on failure.
