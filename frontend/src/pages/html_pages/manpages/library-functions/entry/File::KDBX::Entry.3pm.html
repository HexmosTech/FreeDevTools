</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       File::KDBX::Entry - A KDBX database entry

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 0.906

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       An entry in a KDBX database is a record that can contains strings (also called "fields") and binaries
       (also called "files" or "attachments"). Every string and binary has a key or name. There is a default set
       of strings that every entry has:

       •   <b>Title</b>

       •   <b>UserName</b>

       •   <b>Password</b>

       •   <b>URL</b>

       •   <b>Notes</b>

       Beyond  this,  you  can store any number of other strings and any number of binaries that you can use for
       whatever purpose you want.

       There is also some metadata associated with an entry. Each entry in a database is identified uniquely  by
       a  UUID. An entry can also have an icon associated with it, and there are various timestamps. Take a look
       at the attributes to see what's available.

       A <b>File::KDBX::Entry</b> is a subclass of File::KDBX::Object. View its documentation to see  other  attributes
       and methods available on entries.

   <b>Placeholders</b>
       Entry  string  and auto-type key sequences can have placeholders or template tags that can be replaced by
       other values. Placeholders can appear like "{PLACEHOLDER}". For example, a <b>URL</b> string might have a  value
       of  "<a href="http://example.com">http://example.com</a>?user={USERNAME}".  "{USERNAME}"  is  a  placeholder for the value of the <b>UserName</b>
       string of the same entry. If the <b>UserName</b> string had a value of "batman", the <b>URL</b> string would expand  to
       "<a href="http://example.com">http://example.com</a>?user=batman".

       Some  placeholders  take  an  argument,  where  the argument follows the tag after a colon but before the
       closing brace, like "{PLACEHOLDER:ARGUMENT}".

       Placeholders        are        documented        in        the        KeePass         Help         Center
       &lt;https://keepass.info/help/base/placeholders.html&gt;.   This  software  supports  many (but not all) of the
       placeholders documented there.

       <u>Special</u> <u>Key</u> <u>Placeholders</u>

       Certain placeholders for use in auto-type key sequences are not supported for replacement, but they  will
       remain  as-is  so that an auto-type engine (not included) can parse and replace them with the appropriate
       virtual key presses. For completeness, here is the list that the KeePass program claims to support:

       "{TAB}", "{ENTER}",  "{UP}",  "{DOWN}",  "{LEFT}",  "{RIGHT}",  "{HOME}",  "{END}",  "{PGUP}",  "{PGDN}",
       "{INSERT}", "{DELETE}", "{SPACE}"

       "{BACKSPACE}",  "{BREAK}",  "{CAPSLOCK}",  "{ESC}",  "{WIN}",  "{LWIN}",  "{RWIN}",  "{APPS}",  "{HELP}",
       "{NUMLOCK}", "{PRTSC}", "{SCROLLLOCK}"

       "{F1}", "{F2}", "{F3}", "{F4}", "{F5}",  "{F6}",  "{F7}",  "{F8}",  "{F9}",  "{F10}",  "{F11}",  "{F12}",
       "{F13}", "{F14}", "{F15}", "{F16}"

       "{ADD}",  "{SUBTRACT}",  "{MULTIPLY}",  "{DIVIDE}",  "{NUMPAD0}",  "{NUMPAD1}", "{NUMPAD2}", "{NUMPAD3}",
       "{NUMPAD4}", "{NUMPAD5}", "{NUMPAD6}", "{NUMPAD7}", "{NUMPAD8}", "{NUMPAD9}"

       <u>Miscellaneous</u> <u>Placeholders</u>

       •   ☒ "{BASE}"

       •   ☒ "{BASE:SCM}" / "{BASE:SCHEME}"

       •   ☒ "{BASE:USERINFO}"

       •   ☒ "{BASE:USERNAME}"

       •   ☒ "{BASE:PASSWORD}"

       •   ☒ "{BASE:HOST}"

       •   ☒ "{BASE:PORT}"

       •   ☒ "{BASE:PATH}"

       •   ☒ "{BASE:QUERY}"

       •   ☒ "{BASE:FRAGMENT}" / "{BASE:HASH}"

       •   ☒ "{BASE:RMVSCM}" / "{BASE:WITHOUTSCHEME}"

       •   ☒ "{CLIPBOARD-SET:/Text/}"

       •   ☒ "{PICKCHARS:Field:Options}"

       •   ☒ "{PICKFIELD}"

       •   ☒ "{T-CONV:/Text/Type/}"

       •   ☒ "{T-REPLACE-RX:/Text/Type/Replace/}"

       Some of these that remain unimplemented, such as "{CLIPBOARD}", cannot be implemented portably.  Some  of
       these  I  haven't  implemented  (yet)  just  because they don't seem very useful. You can create your own
       placeholder to augment the list of default supported placeholders or to replace  a  built-in  placeholder
       handler. To create a placeholder, just set it in the %File::KDBX::PLACEHOLDERS hash. For example:

           $File::KDBX::PLACEHOLDERS{'MY_PLACEHOLDER'} = sub {
               my ($entry) = @_;
               ...;
           };

       If  the  placeholder  is  expanded  in the context of an entry, $entry is the <b>File::KDBX::Entry</b> object in
       context. Otherwise it is "undef". An entry is in context if,  for  example,  the  placeholder  is  in  an
       entry's strings or auto-type key sequences.

           $File::KDBX::PLACEHOLDERS{'MY_PLACEHOLDER:'} = sub {
               my ($entry, $arg) = @_;         #    ^ Notice the colon here
               ...;
           };

       If  the  name  of  the  placeholder  ends  in a colon, then it is expected to receive an argument. During
       expansion, everything after the colon and before the end of the placeholder is passed to your placeholder
       handler subroutine. So if the placeholder  is  "{MY_PLACEHOLDER:whatever}",  $arg  will  have  the  value
       <b>whatever</b>.

       An  argument  is required for placeholders than take one. I.e. The placeholder handler won't be called if
       there is no argument. If you want a placeholder to support an optional argument, you'll need to  set  the
       placeholder both with and without a colon (or they could be different subroutines):

           $File::KDBX::PLACEHOLDERS{'RAND'} = $File::KDBX::PLACEHOLDERS{'RAND:'} = sub {
               (undef, my $arg) = @_;
               return defined $arg ? rand($arg) : rand;
           };

       You  can  also  remove  placeholder handlers. If you want to disable placeholder expansion entirely, just
       delete all the handlers:

           %File::KDBX::PLACEHOLDERS = ();

   <b>One-time</b> <b>Passwords</b>
       An entry can be configured to generate one-time passwords, both HOTP (HMAC-based) and TOTP  (time-based).
       The  configuration  storage  isn't  completely  standardized,  but  this  module supports two predominant
       configuration styles:

       •   KeePass 2 &lt;https://keepass.info/help/base/placeholders.html#otp&gt;

       •   KeePassXC

       <b>NOTE:</b> To use this feature, you must install the suggested dependency:

       •   Pass::OTP

       To configure TOTP in the KeePassXC style, there is only one string to set: "otp". The value should be any
       valid otpauth URI. When generating an OTP, all of the relevant OTP properties are parsed from the URI.

       To configure TOTP in the KeePass 2 style, set the following strings:

       •   "TimeOtp-Algorithm" - Cryptographic algorithm, one  of  "HMAC-SHA-1"  (default),  "HMAC-SHA-256"  and
           "HMAC-SHA-512"

       •   "TimeOtp-Length" - Number of digits each one-time password is (default: 6, maximum: 8)

       •   "TimeOtp-Period" - Time-step size in seconds (default: 30)

       •   "TimeOtp-Secret" - Text string secret, OR

       •   "TimeOtp-Secret-Hex" - Hexidecimal-encoded secret, OR

       •   "TimeOtp-Secret-Base32" - Base32-encoded secret (most common), OR

       •   "TimeOtp-Secret-Base64" - Base64-encoded secret

       To configure HOTP in the KeePass 2 style, set the following strings:

       •   "HmacOtp-Counter"  - Counting value in decimal, starts on 0 by default and increments when "hmac_otp"
           is called

       •   "HmacOtp-Secret" - Text string secret, OR

       •   "HmacOtp-Secret-Hex" - Hexidecimal-encoded secret, OR

       •   "HmacOtp-Secret-Base32" - Base32-encoded secret (most common), OR

       •   "HmacOtp-Secret-Base64" - Base64-encoded secret

       <b>NOTE:</b> The multiple "Secret" strings are simply a way to store a secret in different formats. Only one  of
       these should actually be set or an error will be thrown.

       Here's a basic example:

           $entry-&gt;string(otp =&gt; 'otpauth://totp/Issuer:user?secret=NBSWY3DP&amp;issuer=Issuer');
           # OR
           $entry-&gt;string('TimeOtp-Secret-Base32' =&gt; 'NBSWY3DP');

           my $otp = $entry-&gt;time_otp;

</pre><h4><b>ATTRIBUTES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>foreground_color</b>
       Text color represented as a string of the form "#000000".

   <b>background_color</b>
       Background color represented as a string of the form "#FFFFFF".

   <b>override_url</b>
       TODO

   <b>auto_type_enabled</b>
       Whether or not the entry is eligible to be matched for auto-typing.

   <b>auto_type_obfuscation</b>
       Whether or not to use some kind of obfuscation when sending keystroke sequences to applications.

   <b>auto_type_default_sequence</b>
       The default auto-type keystroke sequence.

   <b>auto_type_associations</b>
       An array of window title / keystroke sequence associations.

           {
               window              =&gt; 'Example Window Title',
               keystroke_sequence  =&gt; '{USERNAME}{TAB}{PASSWORD}{ENTER}',
           }

       Keystroke sequences can have "Placeholders", most commonly "{USERNAME}" and "{PASSWORD}".

   <b>quality_check</b>
       Boolean indicating whether the entry password should be tested for weakness and show up in reports.

   <b>strings</b>
       Hash with entry strings, including the standard strings as well as any custom ones.

           {
               # Every entry has these five strings:
               Title    =&gt; { value =&gt; 'Example Entry' },
               UserName =&gt; { value =&gt; 'jdoe' },
               Password =&gt; { value =&gt; 's3cr3t', protect =&gt; true },
               URL      =&gt; { value =&gt; 'https://example.com' }
               Notes    =&gt; { value =&gt; '' },
               # May also have custom strings:
               MySystem =&gt; { value =&gt; 'The mainframe' },
           }

       There  are  methods  available  to  provide  more  convenient  access  to  strings,  including  "string",
       "string_value", "expand_string_value" and "string_peek".

   <b>binaries</b>
       Files or attachments. Binaries are similar to strings except they have a value of bytes instead  of  test
       characters.

           {
               'myfile.txt'    =&gt; {
                   value   =&gt; '...',
               },
               'mysecrets.txt' =&gt; {
                   value   =&gt; '...',
                   protect =&gt; true,
               },
           }

       There  are  methods  available  to  provide  more  convenient  access to binaries, including "binary" and
       "binary_value".

   <b>history</b>
       Array of historical entries. Historical entries are prior versions of the same entry so  they  all  share
       the same UUID with the current entry.

   <b>notes</b>
       Alias for the <b>Notes</b> string value.

   <b>password</b>
       Alias for the <b>Password</b> string value.

   <b>title</b>
       Alias for the <b>Title</b> string value.

   <b>url</b>
       Alias for the <b>URL</b> string value.

   <b>username</b>
       Aliases for the <b>UserName</b> string value.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>string</b>
           \%string = $entry-&gt;string($string_key);

           $entry-&gt;string($string_key, \%string);
           $entry-&gt;string($string_key, %attributes);
           $entry-&gt;string($string_key, $value); # same as: value =&gt; $value

       Get or set a string. Every string has a unique (to the entry) key and flags and so are returned as a hash
       structure. For example:

           $string = {
               value   =&gt; 'Password',
               protect =&gt; true,    # optional
           };

       Every string should have a value (but might be "undef" due to memory protection) and these optional flags
       which might exist:

       •   "protect" - Whether or not the string value should be memory-protected.

   <b>string_value</b>
           $string = $entry-&gt;string_value($string_key);

       Access a string value directly. The arguments are the same as for "string". Returns "undef" if the string
       is not set or is currently memory-protected. This is just a shortcut for:

           my $string = do {
               my $s = $entry-&gt;string(...);
               defined $s ? $s-&gt;{value} : undef;
           };

   <b>expand_string_value</b>
           $string = $entry-&gt;expand_string_value($string_key);

       Same  as  "string_value"  but will substitute placeholders and resolve field references. Any placeholders
       that do not expand to values are left as-is.

       See "Placeholders".

       Some placeholders (notably field references) require the entry be connected to a database and will  throw
       an error if it is not.

   <b>expand_notes</b>
       Shortcut equivalent to "-&gt;expand_string_value('Notes')".

   <b>expand_password</b>
       Shortcut equivalent to "-&gt;expand_string_value('Password')".

   <b>expand_title</b>
       Shortcut equivalent to "-&gt;expand_string_value('Title')".

   <b>expand_url</b>
       Shortcut equivalent to "-&gt;expand_string_value('URL')".

   <b>expand_username</b>
       Shortcut equivalent to "-&gt;expand_string_value('UserName')".

   <b>other_strings</b>
           $other = $entry-&gt;other_strings;
           $other = $entry-&gt;other_strings($delimiter);

       Get  a  concatenation  of  all non-standard string values. The default delimiter is a newline. This is is
       useful for executing queries to search for entities based on the contents  of  these  other  strings  (if
       any).

   <b>string_peek</b>
           $string = $entry-&gt;string_peek($string_key);

       Same  as  "string_value"  but can also retrieve the value from protected-memory if the value is currently
       protected.

   <b>add_auto_type_association</b>
           $entry-&gt;add_auto_type_association(\%association);

       Add a new auto-type association to an entry.

   <b>expand_keystroke_sequence</b>
           $string = $entry-&gt;expand_keystroke_sequence($keystroke_sequence);
           $string = $entry-&gt;expand_keystroke_sequence(\%association);
           $string = $entry-&gt;expand_keystroke_sequence;    # use default auto-type sequence

       Get a keystroke sequence after placeholder expansion.

   <b>binary</b>
           \%binary = $entry-&gt;binary($binary_key);

           $entry-&gt;binary($binary_key, \%binary);
           $entry-&gt;binary($binary_key, %attributes);
           $entry-&gt;binary($binary_key, $value); # same as: value =&gt; $value

       Get or set a binary. Every binary has a unique (to the entry) key and flags and so are returned as a hash
       structure. For example:

           $binary = {
               value   =&gt; '...',
               protect =&gt; true,    # optional
           };

       Every binary should have a value (but might be "undef" due to memory protection) and these optional flags
       which might exist:

       •   "protect" - Whether or not the binary value should be memory-protected.

   <b>binary_value</b>
           $binary = $entry-&gt;binary_value($binary_key);

       Access a binary value directly. The arguments are the same as for "binary". Returns "undef" if the binary
       is not set or is currently memory-protected. This is just a shortcut for:

           my $binary = do {
               my $b = $entry-&gt;binary(...);
               defined $b ? $b-&gt;{value} : undef;
           };

   <b>hmac_otp</b>
           $otp = $entry-&gt;hmac_otp(%options);

       Generate an HMAC-based one-time password, or "undef" if HOTP is not configured for the entry. The entry's
       strings generally must first be unprotected, just like when accessing the password. Valid options are:

       •   "counter" - Specify the counter value

       To configure HOTP, see "One-time Passwords".

   <b>time_otp</b>
           $otp = $entry-&gt;time_otp(%options);

       Generate a time-based one-time password, or "undef" if TOTP is not configured for the entry. The  entry's
       strings generally must first be unprotected, just like when accessing the password. Valid options are:

       •   "now" - Specify the value for determining the time-step counter

       To configure TOTP, see "One-time Passwords".

   <b>hmac_otp_uri</b>
   <b>time_otp_uri</b>
           $uri_string = $entry-&gt;hmac_otp_uri;
           $uri_string = $entry-&gt;time_otp_uri;

       Get a HOTP or TOTP otpauth URI for the entry, if available.

       To configure OTP, see "One-time Passwords".

   <b>size</b>
           $size = $entry-&gt;size;

       Get the size (in bytes) of an entry.

       <b>NOTE:</b>  This  is  not  an  exact figure because there is no canonical serialization of an entry. This size
       should only be used as a rough estimate for  comparison  with  other  entries  or  to  impose  data  size
       limitations.

   <b>history_size</b>
           $size = $entry-&gt;history_size;

       Get the size (in bytes) of all historical entries combined.

   <b>prune_history</b>
           @removed_historical_entries = $entry-&gt;prune_history(%options);

       Remove  just  as  many older historical entries as necessary to get under the database limits. The limits
       are taken from the connected database (if any) or can be overridden with %options:

       •   "max_items" - Maximum number of historical entries to keep (default: 10, no limit: -1)

       •   "max_size" - Maximum total size (in bytes) of historical entries to keep (default: 6 MiB,  no  limit:
           -1)

       •   "max_age" - Maximum age (in days) of historical entries to keep (default: 365, no limit: -1)

   <b>add_historical_entry</b>
           $entry-&gt;add_historical_entry($entry);

       Add an entry to the history.

   <b>remove_historical_entry</b>
           $entry-&gt;remove_historical_entry($historical_entry);

       Remove an entry from the history.

   <b>current_entry</b>
           $current_entry = $entry-&gt;current_entry;

       Get an entry's current entry. If the entry itself is current (not historical), itself is returned.

   <b>is_current</b>
           $bool = $entry-&gt;is_current;

       Get  whether  or  not  an entry is considered current (i.e. not historical). An entry is current if it is
       directly in the parent group's entry list.

   <b>is_historical</b>
           $bool = $entry-&gt;is_historical;

       Get whether or not an entry is considered historical (i.e. not current).

       This is just the inverse of "is_current".

   <b>remove</b>
           $entry = $entry-&gt;remove;

       Remove an entry from its parent group. If the entry is historical, remove it  from  the  history  of  the
       current entry. If the entry is current, this behaves the same as "remove" in File::KDBX::Object.

   <b>searching_enabled</b>
           $bool = $entry-&gt;searching_enabled;

       Get  whether  or  not  an  entry may show up in search results. This is determine from the entry's parent
       group's "effective_enable_searching" in File::KDBX::Group value.

       Throws if entry has no parent group or if the entry is not connected to a database.
