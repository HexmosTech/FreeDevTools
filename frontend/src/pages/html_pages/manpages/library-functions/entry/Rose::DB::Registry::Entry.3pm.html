</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Rose::DB::Registry::Entry - Data source registry entry.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Rose::DB::Registry::Entry;

         $entry = Rose::DB::Registry::Entry-&gt;new(
           domain   =&gt; 'production',
           type     =&gt; 'main',
           driver   =&gt; 'Pg',
           database =&gt; 'big_db',
           host     =&gt; 'dbserver.acme.com',
           username =&gt; 'dbadmin',
           password =&gt; 'prodsecret',
           server_time_zone =&gt; 'UTC');

         Rose::DB-&gt;register_db($entry);

         ...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       "Rose::DB::Registry::Entry" objects store information about a single Rose::DB data source.  See the
       Rose::DB documentation for more information on data sources, and the Rose::DB::Registry documentation to
       learn how "Rose::DB::Registry::Entry" objects are managed.

       "Rose::DB::Registry::Entry" inherits from, and follows the conventions of, Rose::Object.  See the
       Rose::Object documentation for more information.

</pre><h4><b>CONSTRUCTOR</b></h4><pre>
       <b>new</b> <b>PARAMS</b>
           Constructs  a  "Rose::DB::Registry::Entry" object based on PARAMS, where PARAMS are name/value pairs.
           Any object method is a valid parameter name.

</pre><h4><b>OBJECT</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>GENERAL</b>
       <b>autocommit</b> <b>[VALUE]</b>
           Get or set the value of the "AutoCommit" connect option.

       <b>catalog</b> <b>[CATALOG]</b>
           Get or set the database catalog name.  This setting is only relevant to databases  that  support  the
           concept of catalogs.

       <b>clone</b>
           Returns a clone (i.e., deep copy) of the current object.

       <b>connect_option</b> <b>NAME</b> <b>[,</b> <b>VALUE]</b>
           Get or set the connect option named NAME.  Returns the current value of the connect option.

       <b>connect_options</b> <b>[HASHREF</b> <b>|</b> <b>PAIRS]</b>
           Get  or  set  the  options  passed  in  a  hash  reference  as  the  fourth  argument  to the call to
           "DBI-&gt;connect()".  See the "DBI" documentation for descriptions of the various options.

           If a reference to a hash is passed, it replaces the connect options hash.  If a series of  name/value
           pairs are passed, they are added to the connect options hash.

           Returns  a  reference to the hash of options in scalar context, or a list of name/value pairs in list
           context.

       <b>database</b> <b>[NAME]</b>
           Get or set the database name.

       <b>description</b> <b>[TEXT]</b>
           A description of the data source.

       <b>domain</b> <b>[DOMAIN]</b>
           Get or set the data source domain.  Note that changing the "domain" after a registry entry  has  been
           added to the registry has no affect on where the entry appears in the registry.

       <b>driver</b> <b>[DRIVER]</b>
           Get or set the driver name.  The DRIVER argument is converted to lowercase before being set.

       <b>dsn</b> <b>[DSN]</b>
           Get  or  set the "DBI" DSN (Data Source Name).  Note that an explicitly set DSN may render some other
           attributes inaccurate.  For example, the DSN may contain a host  name  that  is  different  than  the
           object's  current host() value.  I recommend not setting the DSN value explicitly unless you are also
           willing to manually synchronize (or ignore) the corresponding object attributes.

       <b>dump</b>
           Returns a reference to a hash of the entry's attributes.  Only those attributes with  defined  values
           are included in the hash keys.  All values are deep copies.

       <b>handle_error</b> <b>[VALUE]</b>
           Get or set the value of the "HandleError" connect option.

       <b>host</b> <b>[NAME]</b>
           Get or set the database server host name.

       <b>password</b> <b>[PASS]</b>
           Get or set the database password.

           Get  or  set  the SQL statements that will be run immediately before disconnecting from the database.
           STATEMENTS should be a list or reference to an array of SQL statements.  Returns a reference  to  the
           array of SQL statements in scalar context, or a list of SQL statements in list context.

       <b>post_connect_sql</b> <b>[STATEMENTS]</b>
           Get  or  set  the  SQL  statements  that  will  be  run immediately after connecting to the database.
           STATEMENTS should be a list or reference to an array of SQL statements.  Returns a reference  to  the
           array of SQL statements in scalar context, or a list of SQL statements in list context.

       <b>print_error</b> <b>[VALUE]</b>
           Get or set the value of the "PrintError" connect option.

       <b>raise_error</b> <b>[VALUE]</b>
           Get or set the value of the "RaiseError" connect option.

       <b>schema</b> <b>[SCHEMA]</b>
           Get  or  set  the  database  schema  name.  This setting is only useful to databases that support the
           concept of schemas (e.g., PostgreSQL).

       <b>server_time_zone</b> <b>[TZ]</b>
           Get or set the time zone used by the database server software.  TZ should be a time zone name that is
           understood by "DateTime::TimeZone".  See the "DateTime::TimeZone" documentation for acceptable values
           of TZ.

       <b>type</b> <b>[TYPE]</b>
           Get or set the  data source type.  Note that changing the "type" after  a  registry  entry  has  been
           added to the registry has no affect on where the entry appears in the registry.

       <b>username</b> <b>[NAME]</b>
           Get or set the database username.
