</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       KiokuDB::Entry - An entry in the database

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 0.57

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           KiokuDB::Entry-&gt;new(
               id =&gt; ...,
               data =&gt; ...
           );

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This object provides the meta data for a single storage entry.

</pre><h4><b>ATTRIBUTES</b></h4><pre>
       id  The UUID for the entry.

           If there is no ID then the entry is intrinsic.

       root
           Whether  or  not this is a member of the root set (not subject to garbage collection, because storage
           was explicitly requested).

       data
           A simplified data structure modeling this object/reference. This is a tree, not a graph, and  has  no
           shared  data  (JSON  compliant).  All references are symbolic, using a KiokuDB::Reference object with
           UIDs as the address space.

       class
           If the entry is blessed, this contains the class of that object.

           In the future this might be a complex structure for anonymous classes, e.g. the class and the runtime
           roles.

       class_meta
           Optional information such as runtime roles to be applied to the object is stored in this hashref.

       tied
           One of "HASH", "ARRAY", "SCALAR" or "GLOB".

           "data" is assumed to be a reference or an intrinsic entry for the object driving the  tied  structure
           (e.g. the "tied(%hash)").

       prev
           Contains a link to a KiokuDB::Entry objects that precedes this one.

           The  last entry that was loaded from the store, or successfully written to the store for a given UUID
           is kept in the live object set.

           The collapser creates transient Entry objects, which if written to the store successfully replace the
           previous one.

       backend_data
           Backends can use this to store additional meta data as they see fit.

           For instance, this is used in the CouchDB backend to track  entry  revisions  for  the  opportunistic
           locking, and in KiokuDB::Backend::BDB::GIN to to store extracted keys.

       deleted
           Used for marking entries for deletion.

           Deletion  entries  can  be  generated  using the "deletion_entry" method, which creates a new derived
           entry with no data but retaining the ID.
