</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Zonemaster::Logger::Entry - module for single log entries

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           Zonemaster-&gt;logger-&gt;add( TAG =&gt; { some =&gt; 'arguments' });

       There should never be a need to create a log entry object in isolation. They should always be associated
       with and created via a logger object.

</pre><h4><b>CLASS</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       levels
           Returns  a  hash  where the keys are log levels as strings and the corresponding values their numeric
           value.

       <b>start_time_now()</b>
           Set the logger's start time to the current time.

</pre><h4><b>ATTRIBUTES</b></h4><pre>
       module
           An auto-generated identifier of the module that created the log entry. If it  was  generated  from  a
           module  under  Zonemaster::Test,  it  will  be  an  uppercased  version of the part of the name after
           "Zonemaster::Test". For example, "Zonemaster::Test::Basic" gets the module identifier "BASIC". If the
           entry was generated from anywhere else, it will get the module identifier "SYSTEM".

       tag The tag that was set when the entry was created.

       args
           The argument hash reference that was provided when the entry was created.

       timestamp
           The time after the current program started running when this entry was created. This is  a  floating-
           point value with the precision provided by Time::HiRes.

       trace
           A  partial  stack  trace  for  the call that created the entry. Used to create the module tag. Almost
           certainly not useful for anything else.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       string
           Simple method to generate a string representation of the log entry. Overloaded to the stringification
           operator.

       printable_args
           Used to transform data from an internal/JSON representation to a "user friendly" representation one.

       numeric_level
           Returns the log level of the entry in numeric form.
