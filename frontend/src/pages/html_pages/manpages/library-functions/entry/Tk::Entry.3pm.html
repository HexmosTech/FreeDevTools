</pre><h4><b>WIDGET-SPECIFIC</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Command-Line Name: <b>-disabledbackground</b>
       Database Name:  <b>disabledBackground</b>
       Database Class: <b>DisabledBackground</b>
           Specifies  the  background  color  to  use  when  the entry is disabled.  If this option is the empty
           string, the normal background color is used.

       Command-Line Name: <b>-disabledforeground</b>
       Database Name:  <b>disabledForeground</b>
       Database Class: <b>DisabledForeground</b>
           Specifies the foreground color to use when the entry is  disabled.   If  this  option  is  the  empty
           string, the normal foreground color is used.

       Name:     <b>invalidCommand</b>
       Class:    <b>InvalidCommand</b>
       Switch:   <b>-invalidcommand</b>
       Alias:    <b>-invcmd</b>
           Specifies  a  script  to  eval  when  <b>validateCommand</b> returns 0.  Setting it to &lt;undef&gt; disables this
           feature (the default).  The best use of this option is to set it to <u>bell</u>.  See <b>Validation</b>  below  for
           more information.

       Command-Line Name: <b>-readonlybackground</b>
       Database Name:  <b>readonlyBackground</b>
       Database Class: <b>ReadonlyBackground</b>
           Specifies  the  background  color  to  use  when the entry is read-only.  If this option is the empty
           string, the normal background color is used.

       Name:     <b>show</b>
       Class:    <b>Show</b>
       Switch:   <b>-show</b>
           If this option is specified, then the true contents of the entry are not  displayed  in  the  window.
           Instead, each character in the entry's value will be displayed as the first character in the value of
           this  option,  such  as  ``*''.   This  is useful, for example, if the entry is to be used to enter a
           password.  If characters in the entry are selected and copied elsewhere, the information copied  will
           be what is displayed, not the true contents of the entry.

       Name:     <b>state</b>
       Class:    <b>State</b>
       Switch:   <b>-state</b>
           Specifies  one  of  three  states  for  the  entry:  <b>normal</b>,  <b>disabled</b>, or <b>readonly</b>.  If the entry is
           <b>readonly</b>, then the value may not be changed using widget commands and no  insertion  cursor  will  be
           displayed,  even  if  the  input  focus  is  in  the  widget; the contents of the widget may still be
           selected.  If the entry is <b>disabled</b>, the value may not  be  changed,  no  insertion  cursor  will  be
           displayed,  the contents will not be selectable, and the entry may be displayed in a different color,
           depending on the values of the <b>-disabledforeground</b> and <b>-disabledbackground</b> options.

       Name:     <b>validate</b>
       Class:    <b>Validate</b>
       Switch:   <b>-validate</b>
           Specifies the mode in which validation should operate: <b>none</b>, <b>focus</b>, <b>focusin</b>, <b>focusout</b>, <b>key</b>,  or  <b>all</b>.
           It defaults to <b>none</b>.  When you want validation, you must explicitly state which mode you wish to use.
           See <b>Validation</b> below for more.

       Name:     <b>validateCommand</b>
       Class:    <b>ValidateCommand</b>
       Switch:   <b>-validatecommand</b>
       Alias:    <b>-vcmd</b>
           Specifies  a script to eval when you want to validate the input into the entry widget.  Setting it to
           "undef" disables this feature (the default).  This command must return a valid boolean value.  If  it
           returns  0 (or the valid boolean equivalent) then it means you reject the new edition and it will not
           occur and the <b>invalidCommand</b> will be evaluated if it is set. If it returns 1, then  the  new  edition
           occurs.  See <b>Validation</b> below for more information.

       Name:     <b>width</b>
       Class:    <b>Width</b>
       Switch:   <b>-width</b>
           Specifies  an  integer  value  indicating  the  desired  width  of  the entry window, in average-size
           characters of the widget's font.  If the value is less than or equal to zero, the widget picks a size
           just large enough to hold its current text.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>Entry</b> method creates a new window (given by the $entry argument) and makes it into an  entry  widget.
       Additional  options,  described  above, may be specified on the command line or in the option database to
       configure aspects of the entry such as its colors, font, and  relief.   The  <b>entry</b>  command  returns  its
       $entry  argument.   At  the time this command is invoked, there must not exist a window named $entry, but
       $entry's parent must exist.

       An entry is a widget that displays a one-line text string and allows  that  string  to  be  edited  using
       methods  described below, which are typically bound to keystrokes and mouse actions.  When first created,
       an entry's string is empty.  A portion of the entry may be selected as described below.  If an  entry  is
       exporting its selection (see the <b>exportSelection</b> option), then it will observe the standard X11 protocols
       for  handling  the  selection;   entry selections are available as type <b>STRING</b>.  Entries also observe the
       standard Tk rules for dealing with the input focus.  When an entry has the input  focus  it  displays  an
       <u>insertion</u> <u>cursor</u> to indicate where new characters will be inserted.

       Entries  are  capable of displaying strings that are too long to fit entirely within the widget's window.
       In this case, only a portion of the string will be displayed;  methods described below  may  be  used  to
       change  the  view  in the window.  Entries use the standard <b>xScrollCommand</b> mechanism for interacting with
       scrollbars (see the description of the <b>-xscrollcommand</b> option for details).  They also support  scanning,
       as described below.

</pre><h4><b>VALIDATION</b></h4><pre>
       Validation  of  entry  widgets  is derived from part of the patch written by <a href="mailto:jhobbs@cs.uoregon.edu">jhobbs@cs.uoregon.edu</a>.  This
       works by setting the <b>validateCommand</b> option to a callback  which  will  be  evaluated  according  to  the
       <b>validate</b> option as follows:

       <b>none</b>
           Default.  This means no validation will occur.

       <b>focus</b>
           <b>validateCommand</b> will be called when the entry receives or loses focus.

       <b>focusin</b>
           <b>validateCommand</b> will be called when the entry receives focus.

       <b>focusout</b>
           <b>validateCommand</b> will be called when the entry loses focus.

       <b>key</b> <b>validateCommand</b> will be called when the entry is edited.

       <b>all</b> <b>validateCommand</b> will be called for all above conditions.

       The <b>validateCommand</b> and <b>invalidCommand</b> are called with the following arguments:

       •   The proposed value of the entry.  If you are configuring the entry widget to have a new textvariable,
           this will be the value of that textvariable.

       •   The  characters to be added (or deleted). This will be "undef" if validation is due to focus, explcit
           call to validate or if change is due to "-textvariable" changing.

       •   The current value of entry i.e. before the proposed change.

       •   index of char string to be added/deleted, if any. -1 otherwise

       •   type of action. 1 == INSERT, 0 == DELETE, -1 if it's a forced validation or textvariable validation

       In general, the <b>textVariable</b> and <b>validateCommand</b> can be dangerous to mix. If you try set the <b>textVariable</b>
       to something that the <b>validateCommand</b> will not accept it will be set back  to  the  value  of  the  entry
       widget.  Using the <b>textVariable</b> for read-only purposes will never cause problems.

       The  <b>validateCommand</b>  will  turn itself off by setting <b>validate</b> to <b>none</b> when an error occurs, for example
       when the <b>validateCommand</b> or <b>invalidCommand</b> encounters  an  error  in  its  script  while  evaluating,  or
       <b>validateCommand</b> does not return a valid boolean value.

       With   the   perl/Tk  version  <b>validate</b>  option  is  supposed  to  be  "suspended"  while  executing  the
       <b>validateCommand</b> or the <b>invalidCommand</b>.  This is experimental but in theory either callback can  "correct"
       the  value of the widget, and override the proposed change. (<b>validateCommand</b> should still return false to
       inhibit the change from happening when it returns.)

</pre><h4><b>WIDGET</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>Entry</b> method creates a widget object.  This object supports the <b>configure</b> and <b>cget</b> methods  described
       in  Tk::options  which  can  be  used to enquire and modify the options described above.  The widget also
       inherits all the methods provided by the generic Tk::Widget class.

       Many of the additional methods for entries take one or more indices as arguments.  An index  specifies  a
       particular character in the entry's string, in any of the following ways:

       <u>number</u>
           Specifies  the  character  as  a  numerical  index, where 0 corresponds to the first character in the
           string.

       <b>anchor</b>
           Indicates the anchor point for the selection, which is set with the <b>selectionFrom</b> and <b>selectionAdjust</b>
           methods.

       <b>end</b> Indicates the character just after the last one  in  the  entry's  string.   This  is  equivalent  to
           specifying a numerical index equal to the length of the entry's string.

       <b>insert</b>
           Indicates the character adjacent to and immediately following the insertion cursor.

       <b>sel.first</b>
           Indicates  the  first  character  in the selection.  It is an error to use this form if the selection
           isn't in the entry window.

       <b>sel.last</b>
           Indicates the character just after the last one in the selection.  It is an error to use this form if
           the selection isn't in the entry window.

       <b>@</b><u>number</u>
           In this form, <u>number</u> is treated as an x-coordinate in the entry's  window;   the  character  spanning
           that x-coordinate is used.  For example, ``<b>@0</b>'' indicates the left-most character in the window.

       Abbreviations  may be used for any of the forms above, e.g. ``<b>e</b>'' or ``<b>sel.f</b>''.  In general, out-of-range
       indices are automatically rounded to the nearest legal value.

       The following additional methods are available for entry widgets:

       <u>$entry</u>-&gt;<b>bbox</b>(<u>index</u>)
           Returns a list of four numbers describing the bounding box of the  character  given  by  <u>index</u>.   The
           first  two  elements  of the list give the x and y coordinates of the upper-left corner of the screen
           area covered by the character (in pixels relative to the widget) and the last two elements  give  the
           width  and  height  of  the character, in pixels.  The bounding box may refer to a region outside the
           visible area of the window.

       <u>$entry</u>-&gt;<b>cget</b>(?<u>option</u>?)
           Returns the current value of the configuration option given by <u>option</u>.  <u>Option</u> may have  any  of  the
           values accepted by the <b>entry</b> command.

       <u>$entry</u>-&gt;<b>configure</b>(?<u>option</u>?, ?<u>value,</u> <u>option,</u> <u>value,</u> <u>...</u>?)
           Query  or  modify the configuration options of the widget.  If no <u>option</u> is specified, returns a list
           describing all of the available options for $entry (see Tk::configure for information on  the  format
           of  this list).  If <u>option</u> is specified with no <u>value</u>, then the command returns a list describing the
           one named option (this list will be identical to the corresponding sublist of the value  returned  if
           no  <u>option</u> is specified).  If one or more <u>option-value</u> pairs are specified, then the command modifies
           the given widget option(s) to have the given value(s);  in this case the  command  returns  an  empty
           string.  <u>Option</u> may have any of the values accepted by the <b>entry</b> command.

       <u>$entry</u>-&gt;<b>delete</b>(<u>first,</u> ?<u>last</u>?)
           Delete  one  or more elements of the entry.  <u>First</u> is the index of the first character to delete, and
           <u>last</u> is the index of the character just after the last one to delete.  If  <u>last</u>  isn't  specified  it
           defaults to <u>first</u>+1, i.e. a single character is deleted.  This method returns an empty string.

       <u>$entry</u>-&gt;<b>get</b>
           Returns the entry's string.

       <u>$entry</u>-&gt;<b>icursor</b>(<u>index</u>)
           Arrange  for  the insertion cursor to be displayed just before the character given by <u>index</u>.  Returns
           an empty string.

       <u>$entry</u>-&gt;<b>index</b>(<u>index</u>)
           Returns the numerical index corresponding to <u>index</u>.

       <u>$entry</u>-&gt;<b>insert</b>(<u>index,</u> <u>string</u>)
           Insert the characters of <u>string</u> just before the character  indicated  by  <u>index</u>.   Returns  an  empty
           string.

       <u>$entry</u>-&gt;<b>scan</b>(<u>option,</u> <u>args</u>)
       <u>$entry</u>-&gt;<b>scan</b><u>Option</u>(<u>args</u>)
           This method is used to implement scanning on entries.  It has two forms, depending on <u>Option</u>:

           <u>$entry</u>-&gt;<b>scanMark</b>(<u>x</u>)
                   Records  <u>x</u>  and  the  current  view  in  the  entry  widget;   used in conjunction with later
                   <b>scanDragto</b> methods.  Typically this method is associated with a mouse  button  press  in  the
                   widget.  It returns an empty string.

           <u>$entry</u>-&gt;<b>scanDragto</b>(<u>x</u>)
                   This  method  computes  the  difference between its <u>x</u> argument and the <u>x</u> argument to the last
                   <b>scanMark</b> method for the widget.  It then adjusts the view left  or  right  by  10  times  the
                   difference in x-coordinates.  This method is typically associated with mouse motion events in
                   the  widget,  to  produce  the effect of dragging the entry at high speed through the widget.
                   The return value is an empty string.

       <u>$entry</u>-&gt;<b>selection</b>(<u>option,</u> <u>arg</u>)
       <u>$entry</u>-&gt;<b>selection</b><u>Option</u>(<u>arg</u>)
           This method is used to adjust the selection within an entry.  It  has  several  forms,  depending  on
           <u>Option</u>:

           <u>$entry</u>-&gt;<b>selectionAdjust</b>(<u>index</u>)
                   Locate  the end of the selection nearest to the character given by <u>index</u>, and adjust that end
                   of the selection to be at <u>index</u> (i.e including but not going beyond <u>index</u>).  The other end of
                   the selection is made the anchor point for future  <b>selectionTo</b>  methods.   If  the  selection
                   isn't  currently  in  the  entry,  then  a new selection is created to include the characters
                   between <u>index</u> and the most recent  selection  anchor  point,  inclusive.   Returns  an  empty
                   string.

           <u>$entry</u>-&gt;<b>selectionClear</b>
                   Clear the selection if it is currently in this widget.  If the selection isn't in this widget
                   then the method has no effect.  Returns an empty string.

           <u>$entry</u>-&gt;<b>selectionFrom</b>(<u>index</u>)
                   Set  the  selection anchor point to just before the character given by <u>index</u>.  Doesn't change
                   the selection.  Returns an empty string.

           <u>$entry</u>-&gt;<b>selectionPresent</b>
                   Returns 1 if there is are characters selected in the entry, 0 if nothing is selected.

           <u>$entry</u>-&gt;<b>selectionRange</b>(<u>start,</u> <u>end</u>)
                   Sets the selection to include the characters starting with  the  one  indexed  by  <u>start</u>  and
                   ending  with  the  one  just  before <u>end</u>.  If <u>end</u> refers to the same character as <u>start</u> or an
                   earlier one, then the entry's selection is cleared.

           <u>$entry</u>-&gt;<b>selectionTo</b>(<u>index</u>)
                   If <u>index</u> is before the anchor point, set the selection to the characters from <u>index</u> up to but
                   not including the anchor point.  If <u>index</u> is the same as the anchor point,  do  nothing.   If
                   <u>index</u> is after the anchor point, set the selection to the characters from the anchor point up
                   to  but not including <u>index</u>.  The anchor point is determined by the most recent <b>selectionFrom</b>
                   or <b>selectionAdjust</b> method in this widget.  If the selection isn't in this widget then  a  new
                   selection is created using the most recent anchor point specified for the widget.  Returns an
                   empty string.

       <u>$entry</u>-&gt;<b>validate</b>
           This  command  is  used  to  force an evaluation of the <b>validateCommand</b> independent of the conditions
           specified by the <b>validate</b> option.  It returns 0 or 1.

       <u>$entry</u>-&gt;<b>xview</b>(<u>args</u>)
           This command is used to query and change the horizontal position of the text in the widget's  window.
           It can take any of the following forms:

           <u>$entry</u>-&gt;<b>xview</b>
                   Returns  a  list  containing  two elements.  Each element is a real fraction between 0 and 1;
                   together they describe the horizontal span that is visible in the window.   For  example,  if
                   the  first  element is .2 and the second element is .7, 20% of the entry's text is off-screen
                   to the left, the middle 50% is visible in the window, and 30% of the text  is  off-screen  to
                   the right.  These are the same values passed to scrollbars via the <b>-xscrollcommand</b> option.

           <u>$entry</u>-&gt;<b>xview</b>(<u>index</u>)
                   Adjusts  the view in the window so that the character given by <u>index</u> is displayed at the left
                   edge of the window.

           <u>$entry</u>-&gt;<b>xviewMoveto</b>(<u>fraction</u>)
                   Adjusts the view in the window so that the character <u>fraction</u> of the  way  through  the  text
                   appears at the left edge of the window.  <u>Fraction</u> must be a fraction between 0 and 1.

           <u>$entry</u>-&gt;<b>xviewScroll</b>(<u>number,</u> <u>what</u>)
                   This method shifts the view in the window left or right according to <u>number</u> and <u>what</u>.  <u>Number</u>
                   must  be  an integer.  <u>What</u> must be either <b>units</b> or <b>pages</b> or an abbreviation of one of these.
                   If <u>what</u> is <b>units</b>, the view adjusts left or right by <u>number</u> average-width  characters  on  the
                   display;   if  it is <b>pages</b> then the view adjusts by <u>number</u> screenfuls.  If <u>number</u> is negative
                   then characters farther to the left become  visible;   if  it  is  positive  then  characters
                   farther to the right become visible.

</pre><h4><b>DEFAULT</b> <b>BINDINGS</b></h4><pre>
       Tk  automatically  creates  class bindings for entries that give them the following default behavior.  In
       the descriptions below, ``word'' refers to a contiguous group of letters, digits, or ``_'' characters, or
       any single character other than these.

       [1] Clicking mouse button 1 positions the insertion cursor just before the character underneath the mouse
           cursor, sets the input focus to this widget, and clears any selection in the widget.   Dragging  with
           mouse  button  1  strokes  out  a  selection between the insertion cursor and the character under the
           mouse.

       [2] Double-clicking with mouse button 1 selects the word under the  mouse  and  positions  the  insertion
           cursor  at  the  beginning  of  the  word.  Dragging after a double click will stroke out a selection
           consisting of whole words.

       [3] Triple-clicking with mouse button 1 selects all of the text in the entry and positions the  insertion
           cursor before the first character.

       [4] The  ends  of  the  selection  can be adjusted by dragging with mouse button 1 while the Shift key is
           down;  this will adjust the end of the selection that was nearest to the mouse cursor when  button  1
           was  pressed.  If the button is double-clicked before dragging then the selection will be adjusted in
           units of whole words.

       [5] Clicking mouse button 1 with the Control key down will position the insertion  cursor  in  the  entry
           without affecting the selection.

       [6] If  any  normal  printing  characters  are  typed  in an entry, they are inserted at the point of the
           insertion cursor.

       [7] The view in the entry can be adjusted by dragging with mouse button 2.  If mouse button 2 is  clicked
           without moving the mouse, the selection is copied into the entry at the position of the mouse cursor.

       [8] If  the  mouse  is dragged out of the entry on the left or right sides while button 1 is pressed, the
           entry will automatically scroll to make more text visible (if there is more text  off-screen  on  the
           side where the mouse left the window).

       [9] The  Left  and  Right  keys  move the insertion cursor one character to the left or right;  they also
           clear any selection in the entry and set the selection anchor.  If Left or Right is  typed  with  the
           Shift  key  down,  then  the  insertion cursor moves and the selection is extended to include the new
           character.  Control-Left and Control-Right move the insertion cursor by words, and Control-Shift-Left
           and Control-Shift-Right move the insertion cursor by words and also extend the selection.   Control-b
           and  Control-f behave the same as Left and Right, respectively.  Meta-b and Meta-f behave the same as
           Control-Left and Control-Right, respectively.

       [10]
           The Home key, or Control-a, will move the insertion cursor to the beginning of the  entry  and  clear
           any  selection in the entry.  Shift-Home moves the insertion cursor to the beginning of the entry and
           also extends the selection to that point.

       [11]
           The End key, or Control-e, will move the insertion cursor to the end  of  the  entry  and  clear  any
           selection  in  the  entry.   Shift-End  moves the cursor to the end and extends the selection to that
           point.

       [12]
           The Select key and Control-Space set the selection anchor to the position of  the  insertion  cursor.
           They  don't  affect the current selection.  Shift-Select and Control-Shift-Space adjust the selection
           to the current position of the insertion cursor, selecting from the anchor to the insertion cursor if
           there was not any selection previously.

       [13]
           Control-/ selects all the text in the entry.

       [14]
           Control-\ clears any selection in the entry.

       [15]
           The F16 key (labelled Copy on many Sun workstations) or Meta-w copies the selection in the widget  to
           the clipboard, if there is a selection.

       [16]
           The  F20  key (labelled Cut on many Sun workstations) or Control-w copies the selection in the widget
           to the clipboard and deletes the selection.  If there is no selection in the widget then  these  keys
           have no effect.

       [17]
           The  F18  key  (labelled  Paste  on  many  Sun workstations) or Control-y inserts the contents of the
           clipboard at the position of the insertion cursor.

       [18]
           The Delete key deletes the selection, if there is one in the entry.  If there  is  no  selection,  it
           deletes the character to the right of the insertion cursor.

       [19]
           The  BackSpace  key and Control-h delete the selection, if there is one in the entry.  If there is no
           selection, it deletes the character to the left of the insertion cursor.

       [20]
           Control-d deletes the character to the right of the insertion cursor.

       [21]
           Meta-d deletes the word to the right of the insertion cursor.

       [22]
           Control-k deletes all the characters to the right of the insertion cursor.

       [23]
           Control-t reverses the order of the two characters to the right of the insertion cursor.

           If the entry is disabled using the <b>-state</b> option, then the entry's view can  still  be  adjusted  and
           text  in  the  entry  can  still  be  selected, but no insertion cursor will be displayed and no text
           modifications will take place.

           The behavior of entries can be changed  by  defining  new  bindings  for  individual  widgets  or  by
           redefining the class bindings.
