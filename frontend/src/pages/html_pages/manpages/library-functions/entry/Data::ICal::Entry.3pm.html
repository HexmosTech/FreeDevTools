       Data::ICal::Entry - Represents an entry in an iCalendar file

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           my $vtodo = Data::ICal::Entry::Todo-&gt;new();
           $vtodo-&gt;add_property(
           # ... see Data::ICal::Entry::Todo documentation
           );
           $vtodo-&gt;add_properties( ... );

           $calendar-&gt;add_entry($vtodo);

           $event-&gt;add_entry($alarm);
           $event-&gt;add_entries($alarm1, ...);

           # or all in one go
           my $vtodo = Data::ICal::Entry::Todo-&gt;new( \%props, \@entries );

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       A Data::ICal::Entry object represents a single entry in an iCalendar file.  (Note that the iCalendar RFC
       refers to entries as "components".)  iCalendar defines several types of entries, such as events and to-do
       lists; each of these corresponds to a subclass of Data::ICal::Entry (though only to-do lists and events
       are currently implemented).  Data::ICal::Entry should be treated as an abstract base class -- all objects
       created should be of its subclasses.  The entire calendar itself (the Data::ICal object) is also
       represented as a Data::ICal::Entry object.

       Each entry has an entry type (such as "VCALENDAR" or "VEVENT"), a series of "properties", and possibly
       some sub-entries.  (Only the root Data::ICal object can have sub-entries, except for alarm entries
       contained in events and to-dos (not yet implemented).)

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>new</b>
       Creates a new entry object with no properties or sub-entries.

   <b>as_string</b> <b>[</b> <b>crlf</b> <b>=&gt;</b> <b>"CRLF"</b> <b>]</b>
       Returns the entry as an appropriately formatted string (with trailing newline).

       Properties are returned in alphabetical order, with multiple properties of the same name returned in the
       order added.  (Property order is unimportant in iCalendar, and this makes testing easier.)

       If any mandatory property is missing, issues a warning.

       The string to use as a newline can optionally be specified by giving the a "crlf" argument, which
       defaults to "\x0d\x0a", per RFC 2445 spec; this option is primarily for backwards compatibility with
       versions of this module before 0.16.

   <b>add_entry</b> <b>$entry</b>
       Adds an entry to this entry.  (According to the standard, this should only be called on either a to-do or
       event entry with an alarm entry, or on a calendar entry (Data::ICal) with a to-do, event, journal,
       timezone, or free/busy entry.)

       Returns true if the entry was successfully added, and false otherwise (perhaps because you tried to add
       an entry of an invalid type, but this check hasn't been implemented yet).

   <b>add_entries</b> <b>$entry1,</b> <b>[$entry2,</b> <b>...]</b>
       Convenience function to call "add_entry" several times with a list of entries.

   <b>entries</b>
       Returns a reference to the array of subentries of this entry.

   <b>properties</b>
       Returns a reference to the hash of properties of this entry.  The keys are property names and the values
       are array references containing Data::ICal::Property objects.

   <b>property</b>
       Given a property name returns a reference to the array of Data::ICal::Property objects.

   <b>add_property</b> <b>$propname</b> <b>=&gt;</b> <b>$propval</b>
       Creates a new Data::ICal::Property object with name $propname and value $propval and adds it to the
       event.

       If the property is not known to exist for that object type and does not begin with "X-", issues a
       warning.

       If the property is known to be unique, replaces the original property.

       To specify parameters for the property, let $propval be a two-element array reference where the first
       element is the property value and the second element is a hash reference.  The keys of the hash are
       parameter names; the values should be either strings or array references of strings, depending on whether
       the parameter should have one or multiple (to be comma-separated) values.

       Examples of setting parameters:

        # Add a property with a parameter of VALUE set to 'DATE'
        $event-&gt;add_property( rdate =&gt; [ $date, { VALUE =&gt; 'DATE' } ] );

   <b>add_properties</b> <b>$propname1</b> <b>=&gt;</b> <b>$propval1,</b> <b>[$propname2</b> <b>=&gt;</b> <b>$propname2,</b> <b>...]</b>
       Convenience function to call "add_property" several times with a list of properties.

       This method is guaranteed to call add "add_property" on them in the order given, so that unique
       properties given later in the call will take precedence over those given earlier.  (This is unrelated to
       the order of properties when the entry is rendered as a string, though.)

       Parameters for the properties are specified in the same way as in "add_property".

   <b>mandatory_unique_properties</b>
       Subclasses should override this method (which returns an empty list by default) to provide a list of
       lower case strings identifying the properties which must appear exactly once in the subclass's entry
       type.

   <b>mandatory_repeatable_properties</b>
       Subclasses should override this method (which returns an empty list by default) to provide a list of
       lower case strings identifying the properties which must appear at least once in the subclass's entry
       type.

   <b>optional_unique_properties</b>
       Subclasses should override this method (which returns an empty list by default) to provide a list of
       lower case strings identifying the properties which must appear at most once in the subclass's entry
       type.

   <b>optional_repeatable_properties</b>
       Subclasses should override this method (which returns an empty list by default) to provide a list of
       lower case strings identifying the properties which may appear zero, one, or more times in the subclass's
       entry type.

   <b>is_property</b> <b>$name</b>
       Returns a boolean value indicating whether or not the property $name is known to the class (that is, if
       it's listed in "(mandatory/optional)_(unique/repeatable)_properties").

   <b>is_mandatory</b> <b>$name</b>
       Returns a boolean value indicating whether or not the property $name is known to the class as mandatory
       (that is, if it's listed in "mandatory_(unique/repeatable)_properties").

   <b>is_optional</b> <b>$name</b>
       Returns a boolean value indicating whether or not the property $name is known to the class as optional
       (that is, if it's listed in "optional_(unique/repeatable)_properties").

   <b>is_unique</b> <b>$name</b>
       Returns a boolean value indicating whether or not the property $name is known to the class as unique
       (that is, if it's listed in "(mandatory/optional)_unique_properties").

   <b>is_repeatable</b> <b>$name</b>
       Returns a boolean value indicating whether or not the property $name is known to the class as repeatable
       (that is, if it's listed in "(mandatory/optional)_repeatable_properties").

   <b>ical_entry_type</b>
       Subclasses should override this method to provide the identifying type name of the entry (such as
       "VCALENDAR" or "VTODO").

   <b>vcal10</b> <b>[$bool]</b>
       Gets or sets a boolean saying whether this entry should be interpreted as vCalendar 1.0 (as opposed to
       iCalendar 2.0).  Generally, you can just set this on your main Data::ICal object when you construct it;
       "add_entry" automatically makes sure that sub-entries end up with the same value as their parents.

   <b>rfc_strict</b> <b>[$bool]</b>
       Gets or sets a boolean saying whether this entry will complain about missing UIDs as per RFC2446.
       Defaults to false, for backwards compatibility.  Generally, you can just set this on your main Data::ICal
       object when you construct it; "add_entry" automatically makes sure that sub-entries end up with the same
       value as their parents.

   <b>auto_uid</b> <b>[$bool]</b>
       Gets or sets a boolean saying whether this entry should automatically generate its own persistently
       unique UIDs.  Defaults to false.  Generally, you can just set this on your main Data::ICal object when
       you construct it; "add_entry" automatically makes sure that sub-entries end up with the same value as
       their parents.

   <b>header</b>
       Returns the header line for the entry (including trailing newline).

   <b>footer</b>
       Returns the footer line for the entry (including trailing newline).

   <b>parse_object</b>
       Translate a Text::vFile::asData sub object into the appropriate Data::iCal::Event subtype.
