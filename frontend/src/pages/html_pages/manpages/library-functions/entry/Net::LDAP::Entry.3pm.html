       Net::LDAP::Entry - An LDAP entry object

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        use Net::LDAP;

        $ldap = Net::LDAP-&gt;new ( $host );
        $mesg = $ldap-&gt;search ( @search_args );

        my $max = $mesg-&gt;count;
        for ( $i = 0 ; $i &lt; $max ; $i++ ) {
          my $entry = $mesg-&gt;entry ( $i );
          foreach my $attr ( $entry-&gt;attributes ) {
            print join( "\n ", $attr, $entry-&gt;get_value( $attr ) ), "\n";
          }
        }

        # or

        use Net::LDAP::Entry;

        $entry = Net::LDAP::Entry-&gt;new;

        $entry-&gt;dn($dn);

        $entry-&gt;add (
          attr1 =&gt; 'value1',
          attr2 =&gt; [ qw(value1 value2) ]
        );

        $entry-&gt;delete ( 'unwanted' );

        $entry-&gt;replace (
          attr1 =&gt; 'newvalue',
          attr2 =&gt; [ qw(new values) ]
        );

        $entry-&gt;update ( $ldap ); # update directory server

        $entry2 = $entry-&gt;clone; # copies entry

        # new alternate syntax

        $entry = Net::LDAP::Entry-&gt;new ( $dn,
          attr1 =&gt; 'value1',
          attr2 =&gt; [ qw(value1 value2) ]
        )-&gt;add(
          attr3   =&gt; 'value'
        )-&gt;update( $ldap );

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>Net::LDAP::Entry</b> object represents a single entry in the directory.  It is a container for attribute-
       value pairs.

       A <b>Net::LDAP::Entry</b> object can be used in two situations. The first and probably most common use is in the
       result of a search to the directory server.

       The other is where a new object is created locally and then a single command is sent to the directory
       server to add, modify or replace an entry. Entries for this purpose can also be created by reading an
       LDIF file with the Net::LDAP::LDIF module.

</pre><h4><b>CONSTRUCTORS</b></h4><pre>
       new ( )
           Create  a  new entry object with the changetype set to 'add'.  Optionally, you can provide a DN and a
           list of arguments passed to the add method.

            Net::LDAP::Entry-&gt;new()

            # or
            Net::LDAP::Entry-&gt;new( $dn )

            # or
            Net::LDAP::Entry-&gt;new( $dn ,
             objectClass =&gt; [qw( top posixAccount )] , uid =&gt; 'admin'
            )

       clone ( )
           Returns a copy of the <b>Net::LDAP::Entry</b> object.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       add ( ATTR =&gt; VALUE, ... )
           Add more attributes or values to the entry and returns the entry itself. Each  "VALUE"  should  be  a
           string  if  only  a single value is wanted in the attribute, or a reference to an array of strings if
           multiple values are wanted. The values given will be added to the values which already exist for  the
           given attributes.

            $entry-&gt;add ( 'sn' =&gt; 'Barr' );

            $entry-&gt;add ( 'street' =&gt; [ '1 some road','nowhere' ] );

           <b>NOTE</b>:  these  changes  are  local to the client and will not appear on the directory server until the
           "update" method is called. As "add" returns the entry, you can write something like.

            $entry-&gt;add ( 'sn' =&gt; 'Barr' )-&gt;update( $ldap );

       attributes ( OPTIONS )
           Return a list of attributes in this entry

           nooptions =&gt; 1
               Return a list of the attribute names excluding any options. For example for the entry

                 name: Graham Barr
                 name;en-us: Bob
                 jpegPhoto;binary: **binary data**

               then

                 @values = $entry-&gt;attributes;
                 print "default: @values\n";

                 @values = $entry-&gt;attributes ( nooptions =&gt; 1 );
                 print "nooptions: @values\n";

               will output

                 default: name name;en-us jpegPhoto;binary
                 nooptions: name jpegPhoto

       changetype ( )
           Returns the type of operation that would be performed when the update method is called.

       changetype ( TYPE )
           Set the type of operation that will be performed when the update method is called to "TYPE".  Returns
           the entry itself.

           Possible values for "TYPE" are

           add The  update  method will call the add method on the client object, which will result in the entry
               being added to the directory server.

           delete
               The update method will call the delete method on the client object,  which  will  result  in  the
               entry being removed from the directory server.

                $entry-&gt;delete-&gt;update( $ldap )

           modify
               The  update  method  will  call  the modify method on the client object, which will result in any
               changes that have been made locally being made to the entry on the directory server.

           moddn/modrdn
               The update method will call the moddn method on the client object, which will result  in  any  DN
               changes  that  have  been  made locally being made to the entry on the directory server. These DN
               changes are specified by setting the entry  attributes  newrdn,  deleteoldrdn,  and  (optionally)
               newsuperior.

       delete ( )
           Delete the entry from the server on the next call to "update".

       delete ( ATTR =&gt; [ VALUE, ... ], ... )
           Delete  the  values  of  given  attributes from the entry. Values are references to arrays; passing a
           reference to an empty array is the same as passing "undef", and will result in the  entire  attribute
           being deleted. For example:

            $entry-&gt;delete ( 'mail' =&gt; [ '<a href="mailto:foo.bar@example.com">foo.bar@example.com</a>' ] );
            $entry-&gt;delete ( 'description' =&gt; [ ], 'streetAddress' =&gt; [ ] );

           <b>NOTE</b>:  these  changes  are  local to the client and will not appear on the directory server until the
           "update" method is called.

       dn ( )
           Get the DN of the entry.

       dn ( DN )
           Set the DN for the entry, and return the previous value.

           <b>NOTE</b>: these changes are local to the client and will not appear on the  directory  server  until  the
           "update" method is called.

       ldif ( OPTION =&gt; VALUE, ... )
           Returns  the  entry  as  an  LDIF  string.  Possible options are all options "new" in Net::LDAP::LDIF
           allows, with two being treated special:

           change =&gt; VALUE
               If given a true value then the LDIF will be generated as a change record.   If  false,  then  the
               LDIF  generated  will represent the entry content. If unspecified then it will default to true if
               the entry has changes and false if no changes have been applied to the entry.

           version =&gt; VALUE
               No matter what value is passed, it will be ignored, and treated as if 0 were given.

       dump ( [ FILEHANDLE ] )
           Dump the entry to the given filehandle.

           This method is intended for debugging purposes and does not treat binary  attributes  specially.   It
           also does not deal properly with entries resulting from LDIF change records.

           See Net::LDAP::LDIF on how to generate LDIF output.

           If "FILEHANDLE" is omitted "STDOUT" is used by default.

       exists ( ATTR )
           Returns "TRUE" if the entry has an attribute called "ATTR".

       get_value ( ATTR, OPTIONS )
           Get  the  values  for  the  attribute  "ATTR".  In  a  list  context returns all values for the given
           attribute, or the empty list if the attribute does not exist. In a scalar context returns  the  first
           value for the attribute or undef if the attribute does not exist.

           alloptions =&gt; 1
               The  result will be a hash reference. The keys of the hash will be the options and the hash value
               will be the values for those attributes.  For example if an entry had:

                name: Graham Barr
                name;en-us: Bob

               Then a get for attribute "name" with alloptions set to a true value

                $ref = $entry-&gt;get_value ( 'name', alloptions =&gt; 1 );

               will return a hash reference that would be like

                {
                  ''       =&gt; [ 'Graham Barr' ],
                  ';en-us' =&gt; [ 'Bob' ]
                }

               If alloptions is not set or is set to false only the attribute values for  the  exactly  matching
               name are returned.

           nooptions =&gt; 1
               Instead  of  only  returning the values of the exactly matching attribute name, get the attribute
               values of all attributes with the base name given.  I.e. in the example above, calling

                @array = $entry-&gt;get_value ( 'name', nooptions =&gt; 1 );

               will yield

                ( 'Graham Barr', 'Bob' )

               The name of this option has neen chosen for consistency with the  equally  named  option  in  the
               attributes method.

           asref =&gt; 1
               The  result  will  be  a  reference  to  an array containing all the values for the attribute, or
               "undef" if the attribute does not exist.

                $scalar = $entry-&gt;get_value ( 'name' );

               $scalar will be the first value for the "name" attribute,  or  "undef"  if  the  entry  does  not
               contain a "name" attribute.

                $ref = $entry-&gt;get_value ( 'name', asref =&gt; 1 );

               $ref will be a reference to an array, which will have all the values for the "name" attribute. If
               the entry does not have an attribute called "name" then $ref will be "undef".

           <b>NOTE</b>:  In  the interest of performance the array references returned by "get_value" may be references
           to structures held inside the entry object. These values and their contents should  <b>NOT</b>  be  modified
           directly.

       replace ( ATTR =&gt; VALUE, ... )
           Similar  to  "add",  except  that the values given will replace any values that already exist for the
           given attributes.

           <b>NOTE</b>: these changes are local to the client and will not appear on the  directory  server  until  the
           "update" method is called.

       update ( CLIENT [, OPTIONS ] )
           Update  the  directory  server with any changes that have been made locally to the attributes of this
           entry. This means any calls that have been made to add, replace or delete  since  the  last  call  to
           changetype or update was made.

           This  method  can  also  be  used to modify the DN of the entry on the server, by specifying moddn or
           modrdn as the changetype, and setting the entry attributes  newrdn,  deleteoldrdn,  and  (optionally)
           newsuperior.

           "CLIENT" is a "Net::LDAP" object where the update will be sent to.

           "OPTIONS"  may  be  options  to  the  "Net::LDAP"  actions  on  CLIENT  corresponding  to the entry's
           changetype.

           The result will be an object of type Net::LDAP::Message as returned by  the  add,  modify  or  delete
           method called on CLIENT.

           Alternatively  "CLIENT"  can also be a "Net::LDAP::LDIF" object, that must be an LDIF file opened for
           writing.

           In this case, the entry, together with any "OPTIONS" is passed  as  arguments  to  the  "write_entry"
           method of the "CLIENT" object.

           Here  too,  the  result  is  an  object  class  "Net::LDAP::Message".   On  error,  the error code is
           "LDAP_OTHER" with the LDIF error message in the error text.
