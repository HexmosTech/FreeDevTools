</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       MooseX::Role::Parameterized::Tutorial - why and how

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 1.11

</pre><h4><b>MOTIVATION</b></h4><pre>
       Roles are composable units of behavior. They are useful for factoring out functionality common to many
       classes from any part of your class hierarchy. See Moose::Cookbook::Roles::Comparable_CodeReuse for an
       introduction to Moose::Role.

       While combining roles affords you a great deal of flexibility, individual roles have very little in the
       way of configurability. Core Moose provides "-alias" for renaming methods and "-excludes" for ignoring
       methods. These options are primarily for resolving role conflicts. Depending on how much of a purist you
       are, these options are <u>solely</u> for resolving role conflicts. See
       Moose::Cookbook::Roles::Restartable_AdvancedComposition for more about "-alias" and "-excludes".

       Because roles serve many different masters, they usually provide only the least common denominator of
       functionality. To empower roles further, more configurability than "-alias" and "-excludes" is required.
       Perhaps your role needs to know which method to call when it is done processing. Or what default value to
       use for its "url" attribute.

       Parameterized roles offer a solution to these (and other) kinds of problems.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
   <b>"with"</b>
       The syntax of a class consuming a parameterized role has not changed from the standard "with". You pass
       in parameters just like you pass in "-alias" and "-excludes" to ordinary roles (though your custom
       parameters do not get hyphens, since these are not core Moose composition parameters):

           with 'MyRole::InstrumentMethod' =&gt; {
               method_name =&gt; 'dbh_do',
               log_to      =&gt; 'query.log',
           };

       You can still combine parameterized roles. You just need to specify parameters immediately after the role
       they belong to:

           with (
               'My::Parameterized::Role' =&gt; {
                   needs_better_example =&gt; 1,
               },
               'My::Other::Role',
           );

       We, like Moose itself, use Data::OptList to make sure that a list of role names and associated parameters
       is handled correctly.

   <b>"parameter"</b>
       Inside your parameterized role, you specify a set of parameters. This is exactly like specifying the
       attributes of a class. Instead of "has" in Moose you use the keyword "parameter", but your parameters can
       use any options to "has".

           parameter 'delegation' =&gt; (
               isa       =&gt; 'HashRef|ArrayRef|RegexpRef',
               predicate =&gt; 'has_delegation',
           );

       You do have to declare what parameters you accept, just like you have to declare what attributes you
       accept for regular Moose objects.

       One departure from "has" is that we create a reader accessor for you by default. In other words, we
       assume "is =&gt; 'ro'". We create this reader for convenience because generally the parameterized role is
       the only consumer of the parameters object, so data hiding is not as important than in the general case
       of "has" in Moose. If you do not want an accessor, you can use "is =&gt; 'bare'".

   <b>"role"</b>
       "role" takes a block of code that will be used to generate your role with its parameters bound. Here is
       where you declare components that depend on parameters. You can declare attributes, methods, modifiers,
       etc. The first argument to the "role" is an object containing the parameters specified by "with". You can
       access the parameters just like regular attributes on that object.

       Each time you compose this parameterized role, the "role {}" block will be executed. It will receive a
       new parameter object and produce an entirely new role. That's the whole point, after all.

       Due to limitations inherent in Perl, you must declare methods with "method name =&gt; sub { ... }" instead
       of the usual "sub name { ... }".  Your methods may, of course, close over the parameter object. This
       means that your methods may use parameters however they wish!

</pre><h4><b>USES</b></h4><pre>
       Ideally these will become fully-explained examples in something resembling Moose::Cookbook. But for now,
       only a brain dump.

       Configure a role's attributes
           You  can  rename  methods with core Moose, but now you can rename attributes. You can now also choose
           type, default value, whether it's required, <b>traits</b>, etc.

               parameter traits =&gt; (
                   isa     =&gt; 'ArrayRef',
                   default =&gt; sub { [] },
               );

               parameter type =&gt; (
                   isa     =&gt; 'Str',
                   default =&gt; 'Any',
               );

               role {
                   my $p = shift;

                   has action =&gt; (
                       traits =&gt; $p-&gt;traits,
                       isa    =&gt; $p-&gt;type,
                       ...
                   );
               };

       Inform a role of your class' attributes and methods
           Core roles can only require methods with specific names chosen by the role. Now your roles can demand
           that the class specifies a method name you wish the role to instrument, or which attributes  to  dump
           to a file.

               parameter instrument_method =&gt; (
                   isa      =&gt; 'Str',
                   required =&gt; 1,
               );

               role {
                   my $p = shift;
                   around $p-&gt;instrument_method =&gt; sub { ... };
               };

       Arbitrary execution choices
           Your  role  may  be able to provide configuration in how the role's methods operate. For example, you
           can tell the role whether to save intermediate states.

               parameter save_intermediate =&gt; (
                   isa     =&gt; 'Bool',
                   default =&gt; 0,
               );

               role {
                   my $p = shift;
                   method process =&gt; sub {
                       ...
                       if ($p-&gt;save_intermediate) { ... }
                       ...
                   };
               };

       Deciding a backend
           Your role may be able to freeze and thaw your instances using YAML, JSON, Storable. Which backend  to
           use can be a parameter.

               parameter format =&gt; (
                   isa     =&gt; (enum ['Storable', 'YAML', 'JSON']),
                   default =&gt; 'Storable',
               );

               role {
                   my $p = shift;
                   if ($p-&gt;format eq 'Storable') {
                       method freeze =&gt; \&amp;Storable::freeze;
                       method thaw   =&gt; \&amp;Storable::thaw;
                   }
                   elsif ($p-&gt;format eq 'YAML') {
                       method freeze =&gt; \&amp;YAML::Dump;
                       method thaw   =&gt; \&amp;YAML::Load;
                   }
                   ...
               };

       Additional validation
           Ordinary  roles  can  require  that  its  consumers  have  a  particular  list of method names. Since
           parameterized roles have direct access to its consumer, you can inspect it and throw  errors  if  the
           consumer does not meet your needs.

               role {
                   my $p    = shift;
                   my %args = @_;
                   my $consumer = $args{consumer};

                   $consumer-&gt;find_attribute_by_name('stack')
                       or confess "You must have a 'stack' attribute";

                   my $push = $consumer-&gt;find_method_by_name('push')
                       or confess "You must have a 'push' method";

                   my $params = $push-&gt;parsed_signature-&gt;positional_params-&gt;params;
                   @$params == 1
                       or confess "Your push method must take a single parameter";

                   $params-&gt;[0]-&gt;sigil eq '$'
                       or confess "Your push parameter must be a scalar";

                   ...
               };
