       enum - C style enumerated types and bitmask flags in Perl

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use enum qw(Sun Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat);
         # Sun == 0, Mon == 1, etc

         use enum qw(Forty=40 FortyOne Five=5 Six Seven);
         # Yes, you can change the start indexs at any time as in C

         use enum qw(:Prefix_ One Two Three);
         ## Creates Prefix_One, Prefix_Two, Prefix_Three

         use enum qw(:Letters_ A..Z);
         ## Creates Letters_A, Letters_B, Letters_C, ...

         use enum qw(
             :Months_=0 Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec
             :Days_=0   Sun Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat
             :Letters_=20 A..Z
         );
         ## Prefixes can be changed mid list and can have index changes too

         use enum qw(BITMASK:LOCK_ SH EX NB UN);
         ## Creates bitmask constants for LOCK_SH == 1, LOCK_EX == 2,
         ## LOCK_NB == 4, and LOCK_UN == 8.
         ## NOTE: This example is only valid on FreeBSD-2.2.5 however, so don't
         ## actually do this.  Import from Fnctl instead.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module is used to define a set of constants with ordered numeric values, similar to the "enum" type
       in the C programming language.  You can also define bitmask constants, where the value assigned to each
       constant has exactly one bit set (eg 1, 2, 4, 8, etc).

       What are enumerations good for?  Typical uses would be for giving mnemonic names to indexes of arrays.
       Such arrays might be a list of months, days, or a return value index from a function such as <b>localtime()</b>:

         use enum qw(
             :Months_=0 Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec
             :Days_=0   Sun Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat
             :LC_=0     Sec Min Hour MDay Mon Year WDay YDay Isdst
         );

         if ((localtime)[LC_Mon] == Months_Jan) {
             print "It's January!\n";
         }
         if ((localtime)[LC_WDay] == Days_Fri) {
             print "It's Friday!\n";
         }

       This not only reads easier, but can also be typo-checked at compile time when run under <b>use</b> <b>strict</b>.  That
       is, if you misspell <b>Days_Fri</b> as <b>Days_Fry</b>, you'll generate a compile error.

</pre><h4><b>BITMASKS</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>BITMASK</b> option allows the easy creation of bitmask constants such as functions like <b>flock()</b> and
       <b>sysopen()</b> use.  These are also very useful for your own code as they allow you to efficiently store many
       true/false options within a single integer.

           use enum qw(BITMASK:MY_ FOO BAR CAT DOG);

           my $foo = 0;
           $foo |= MY_FOO;
           $foo |= MY_DOG;

           if ($foo &amp; MY_DOG) {
               print "foo has the MY_DOG option set\n";
           }
           if ($foo &amp; (MY_BAR | MY_DOG)) {
               print "foo has either the MY_BAR or MY_DOG option set\n"
           }

           $foo ^= MY_DOG;  ## Turn MY_DOG option off (set its bit to false)

       When using bitmasks, remember that you must use the bitwise operators, <b>|</b>, <b>&amp;</b>, <b>^</b>, and <b>~</b>.  If you try to do
       an operation like "$foo += MY_DOG;" and the <b>MY_DOG</b> bit has already been set, you'll end up setting other
       bits you probably didn't want to set.  You'll find the documentation for these operators in the <b>perlop</b>
       manpage.

       You can set a starting index for bitmasks just as you can for normal <b>enum</b> values.  But if the given index
       isn't a power of 2, then it won't resolve to a single bit and therefore will generate a compile error.
       Because of this, whenever you set the <b>BITFIELD:</b> directive, the index is automatically set to 1.  If you
       wish to go back to normal <b>enum</b> mode, use the <b>ENUM:</b> directive.  Similarly to the <b>BITFIELD</b> directive, the
       <b>ENUM:</b> directive resets the index to 0.  Here's an example:

         use enum qw(
             BITMASK:BITS_ FOO BAR CAT DOG
             ENUM: FALSE TRUE
             ENUM: NO YES
             BITMASK: ONE TWO FOUR EIGHT SIX_TEEN
         );

       In this case, <b>BITS_FOO,</b> <b>BITS_BAR,</b> <b>BITS_CAT,</b> <b>and</b> <b>BITS_DOG</b> equal 1, 2, 4 and 8 respectively.  <b>FALSE</b> <b>and</b>
       <b>TRUE</b> equal 0 and 1.  <b>NO</b> <b>and</b> <b>YES</b> also equal 0 and 1.  And <b>ONE,</b> <b>TWO,</b> <b>FOUR,</b> <b>EIGHT,</b> <b>and</b> <b>SIX_TEEN</b> equal, you
       guessed it, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Enum names can not be the same as method, function, or constant names.  This is probably a Good
       Thing[tm].

       No way (that I know of) to cause compile time errors when one of these enum names get redefined.  IMHO,
       there is absolutely no time when redefining a sub is a Good Thing[tm], and should be taken out of the
       language, or at least have a pragma that can cause it to be a compile time error.

       Enumerated types are package scoped just like constants, not block scoped as some other pragma modules
       are.

       It supports A..Z nonsense.  Can anyone give me a Real World[tm] reason why anyone would ever use this
       feature...?

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       There are a number of modules that can be used to define enumerations: Class::Enum, enum::fields,
       enum::hash, Readonly::Enum, Object::Enum, Enumeration.

       If you're using Moose, then MooseX::Enumeration may be of interest.  Type::Tiny::Enum is part of the
       Type-Tiny &lt;https://metacpan.org/release/Type-Tiny&gt; distribution.

       There are many CPAN modules related to defining constants in Perl; here are some of the best ones:
       constant, Const::Fast, constant::lexical, constant::our.

       Neil Bowers has written a review of CPAN modules for definining constants
       &lt;<a href="http://neilb.org/reviews/constants.html">http://neilb.org/reviews/constants.html</a>&gt;, which covers all such modules.
