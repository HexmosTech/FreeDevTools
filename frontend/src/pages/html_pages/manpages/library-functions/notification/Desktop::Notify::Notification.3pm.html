</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Desktop::Notify::Notification - a notification object for the desktop notifications framework

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       Version 0.03

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           # $notify is an existing Desktop::Notify object
           my $note = $notify-&gt;create(summary =&gt; 'Rebuilding FooBar',
                                      body =&gt; 'Progress: 10%');
           $note-&gt;show;

           ...

           # Update the notification later
           $note-&gt;body('Progress: 20%');
           $note-&gt;show;

           ...
           # Take it off the screen
           $note-&gt;close;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Desktop notification objects are represented as objects of this class.  They are created by a
       Desktop::Notify object.  Displaying, closing, and modifying the notification is done by using methods in
       this class.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>new</b> <b>$notify,</b> <b>%params</b>
       This is called internally by Desktop::Notify to create a new notification object.

   <b>show</b>
       Display the notification on the screen. If this notification had previously been shown and not closed
       yet, it will replace the existing notification.

       Show can be called multiple times on the same notification, probably with attribute changes between
       calls, and later show calls will cause the server to seamlessly replace the existing notification.

   <b>close</b>
       Close the notification if it is already being displayed.

</pre><h4><b>ATTRIBUTES</b></h4><pre>
       The following parameters can be set when creating the object or later modified using accessors
       (descriptions are from the specification at
       &lt;<a href="http://www.galago-project.org/specs/notification/0.9/x408.html">http://www.galago-project.org/specs/notification/0.9/x408.html</a>&gt;)

       summary
           The summary text briefly describing the notification.

       body
           The optional detailed body text. Can be empty.

       actions
           Actions  are  sent  over  as  a  list  of  pairs. Each even element in the list (starting at index 0)
           represents the identifier for the action. Each odd element in the list is the localized  string  that
           will be displayed to the user.

           A  user-specified  function  to  be  called  whenever  an  action  is  invoked  can be specified with
           Desktop::Notify's action_callback method.

       hints
           Optional hints that can be passed to the server from the client program.

       timeout
           The timeout time in milliseconds since the display of the  notification  at  which  the  notification
           should automatically close.

           If -1, the notification's expiration time is dependent on the notification server's settings, and may
           vary for the type of notification. If 0, never expire.

       The  following extra parameters are included in the specification but not supported by Desktop::Notify at
       this time

       app_icon
           The optional program icon of the calling application.
