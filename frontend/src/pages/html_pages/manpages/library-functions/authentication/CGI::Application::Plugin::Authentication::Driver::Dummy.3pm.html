</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       CGI::Application::Plugin::Authentication::Driver::Dummy - Dummy Authentication driver which lets anyone
       authenticate regardless of the password they provide

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        use base qw(CGI::Application);
        use CGI::Application::Plugin::Authentication;

         __PACKAGE__-&gt;authen-&gt;config(
               DRIVER =&gt; 'Dummy',
         );

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This Driver is the anti-authentication driver, since it doesn't check the credentials at all, and just
       accepts whatever the user has entered.  It can be useful in development, or if you want a guest based
       system without passwords.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
         __PACKAGE__-&gt;authen-&gt;config(
               DRIVER =&gt; 'Dummy',
         );

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>verify_credentials</b>
       This method will automatically return the first credential as the username without checking anything
       else.
