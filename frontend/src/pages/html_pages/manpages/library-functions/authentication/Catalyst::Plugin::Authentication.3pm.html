</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Catalyst::Plugin::Authentication - Infrastructure plugin for the Catalyst authentication framework.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Catalyst qw/
               Authentication
           /;

           # later on ...
           $c-&gt;authenticate({ username =&gt; 'myusername',
                              password =&gt; 'mypassword' });
           my $age = $c-&gt;user-&gt;get('age');
           $c-&gt;logout;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The authentication plugin provides generic user support for Catalyst apps. It is the basis for both
       authentication (checking the user is who they claim to be), and authorization (allowing the user to do
       what the system authorises them to do).

       Using authentication is split into two parts. A Store is used to actually store the user information, and
       can store any amount of data related to the user. Credentials are used to verify users, using information
       from the store, given data from the frontend. A Credential and a Store are paired to form a 'Realm'. A
       Catalyst application using the authentication framework must have at least one realm, and may have
       several.

       To implement authentication in a Catalyst application you need to add this module, and specify at least
       one realm in the configuration.

       Authentication data can also be stored in a session, if the application is using the
       Catalyst::Plugin::Session module.

       <b>NOTE</b> in version 0.10 of this module, the interface to this module changed.  Please see "COMPATIBILITY
       ROUTINES" for more information.

</pre><h4><b>INTRODUCTION</b></h4><pre>
   <b>The</b> <b>Authentication/Authorization</b> <b>Process</b>
       Web applications typically need to identify a user - to tell the user apart from other users. This is
       usually done in order to display private information that is only that user's business, or to limit
       access to the application so that only certain entities can access certain parts.

       This process is split up into several steps. First you ask the user to identify themselves. At this point
       you can't be sure that the user is really who they claim to be.

       Then the user tells you who they are, and backs this claim with some piece of information that only the
       real user could give you. For example, a password is a secret that is known to both the user and you.
       When the user tells you this password you can assume they're in on the secret and can be trusted (ignore
       identity theft for now). Checking the password, or any other proof is called <b>credential</b> <b>verification</b>.

       By this time you know exactly who the user is - the user's identity is <b>authenticated</b>. This is where this
       module's job stops, and your application or other plugins step in.

       The next logical step is <b>authorization</b>, the process of deciding what a user is (or isn't) allowed to do.
       For example, say your users are split into two main groups - regular users and administrators. You want
       to verify that the currently logged in user is indeed an administrator before performing the actions in
       an administrative part of your application. These decisions may be made within your application code
       using just the information available after authentication, or it may be facilitated by a number of
       plugins.

   <b>The</b> <b>Components</b> <b>In</b> <b>This</b> <b>Framework</b>
       <u>Realms</u>

       Configuration of the Catalyst::Plugin::Authentication framework is done in terms of realms. In simplest
       terms, a realm is a pairing of a Credential verifier and a User storage (Store) backend. As of version
       0.10003, realms are now objects that you can create and customize.

       An application can have any number of Realms, each of which operates independent of the others. Each
       realm has a name, which is used to identify it as the target of an authentication request. This name can
       be anything, such as 'users' or 'members'. One realm must be defined as the default_realm, which is used
       when no realm name is specified. More information about configuring realms is available in the
       configuration section.

       <u>Credential</u> <u>Verifiers</u>

       When user input is transferred to the Catalyst application (typically via form inputs) the application
       may pass this information into the authentication system through the "$c-&gt;authenticate()" method.  From
       there, it is passed to the appropriate Credential verifier.

       These plugins check the data, and ensure that it really proves the user is who they claim to be.

       Credential verifiers compatible with versions of this module 0.10x and upwards should be in the namespace
       "Catalyst::Authentication::Credential".

       <u>Storage</u> <u>Backends</u>

       The authentication data also identifies a user, and the Storage backend modules use this data to locate
       and return a standardized object-oriented representation of a user.

       When a user is retrieved from a store it is not necessarily authenticated.  Credential verifiers accept a
       set of authentication data and use this information to retrieve the user from the store they are paired
       with.

       Storage backends compatible with versions of this module 0.10x and upwards should be in the namespace
       "Catalyst::Authentication::Store".

       <u>The</u> <u>Core</u> <u>Plugin</u>

       This plugin on its own is the glue, providing realm configuration, session integration, and other
       goodness for the other plugins.

       <u>Other</u> <u>Plugins</u>

       More layers of plugins can be stacked on top of the authentication code. For example,
       Catalyst::Plugin::Session::PerUser provides an abstraction of browser sessions that is more persistent
       per user.  Catalyst::Plugin::Authorization::Roles provides an accepted way to separate and group users
       into categories, and then check which categories the current user belongs to.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       Let's say we were storing users in a simple Perl hash. Users are verified by supplying a password which
       is matched within the hash.

       This means that our application will begin like this:

           package MyApp;

           use Catalyst qw/
               Authentication
           /;

           __PACKAGE__-&gt;config( 'Plugin::Authentication' =&gt;
                       {
                           default =&gt; {
                               credential =&gt; {
                                   class =&gt; 'Password',
                                   password_field =&gt; 'password',
                                   password_type =&gt; 'clear'
                               },
                               store =&gt; {
                                   class =&gt; 'Minimal',
                                   users =&gt; {
                                       bob =&gt; {
                                           password =&gt; "s00p3r",
                                           editor =&gt; 'yes',
                                           roles =&gt; [qw/edit delete/],
                                       },
                                       william =&gt; {
                                           password =&gt; "s3cr3t",
                                           roles =&gt; [qw/comment/],
                                       }
                                   }
                               }
                           }
                       }
           );

       This tells the authentication plugin what realms are available, which credential and store modules are
       used, and the configuration of each. With this code loaded, we can now attempt to authenticate users.

       To show an example of this, let's create an authentication controller:

           package MyApp::Controller::Auth;

           sub login : Local {
               my ( $self, $c ) = @_;

               if (    my $user     = $c-&gt;req-&gt;params-&gt;{user}
                   and my $password = $c-&gt;req-&gt;params-&gt;{password} )
               {
                   if ( $c-&gt;authenticate( { username =&gt; $user,
                                            password =&gt; $password } ) ) {
                       $c-&gt;res-&gt;body( "hello " . $c-&gt;user-&gt;get("name") );
                   } else {
                       # login incorrect
                   }
               }
               else {
                   # invalid form input
               }
           }

       This code should be self-explanatory. If all the necessary fields are supplied, call the "authenticate"
       method on the context object. If it succeeds the user is logged in.

       The credential verifier will attempt to retrieve the user whose details match the authentication
       information provided to "$c-&gt;authenticate()". Once it fetches the user the password is checked and if it
       matches the user will be <b>authenticated</b> and "$c-&gt;user" will contain the user object retrieved from the
       store.

       In the above case, the default realm is checked, but we could just as easily check an alternate realm. If
       this were an admin login, for example, we could authenticate on the admin realm by simply changing the
       "$c-&gt;authenticate()" call:

           if ( $c-&gt;authenticate( { username =&gt; $user,
                                    password =&gt; $password }, 'admin' ) ) {
               $c-&gt;res-&gt;body( "hello " . $c-&gt;user-&gt;get("name") );
           } ...

       Now suppose we want to restrict the ability to edit to a user with an 'editor' value of yes.

       The restricted action might look like this:

           sub edit : Local {
               my ( $self, $c ) = @_;

               $c-&gt;detach("unauthorized")
                 unless $c-&gt;user_exists
                 and $c-&gt;user-&gt;get('editor') eq 'yes';

               # do something restricted here
           }

       (Note that if you have multiple realms, you can use "$c-&gt;user_in_realm('realmname')" in place of
       "$c-&gt;user_exists();" This will essentially perform the same verification as user_exists, with the added
       requirement that if there is a user, it must have come from the realm specified.)

       The above example is somewhat similar to role based access control.
       Catalyst::Authentication::Store::Minimal treats the roles field as an array of role names. Let's leverage
       this. Add the role authorization plugin:

           use Catalyst qw/
               ...
               Authorization::Roles
           /;

           sub edit : Local {
               my ( $self, $c ) = @_;

               $c-&gt;detach("unauthorized") unless $c-&gt;check_user_roles("edit");

               # do something restricted here
           }

       This is somewhat simpler and will work if you change your store, too, since the role interface is
       consistent.

       Let's say your app grows, and you now have 10,000 users. It's no longer efficient to maintain a hash of
       users, so you move this data to a database.  You can accomplish this simply by installing the DBIx::Class
       Store and changing your config:

           __PACKAGE__-&gt;config( 'Plugin::Authentication' =&gt;
                           {
                               default_realm =&gt; 'members',
                               members =&gt; {
                                   credential =&gt; {
                                       class =&gt; 'Password',
                                       password_field =&gt; 'password',
                                       password_type =&gt; 'clear'
                                   },
                                   store =&gt; {
                                       class =&gt; 'DBIx::Class',
                                       user_model =&gt; 'MyApp::Users',
                                       role_column =&gt; 'roles',
                                   }
                               }
                           }
           );

       The authentication system works behind the scenes to load your data from the new source. The rest of your
       application is completely unchanged.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
           # example
           __PACKAGE__-&gt;config( 'Plugin::Authentication' =&gt;
                       {
                           default_realm =&gt; 'members',

                           members =&gt; {
                               credential =&gt; {
                                   class =&gt; 'Password',
                                   password_field =&gt; 'password',
                                   password_type =&gt; 'clear'
                               },
                               store =&gt; {
                                   class =&gt; 'DBIx::Class',
                                   user_model =&gt; 'MyApp::Users',
                                   role_column =&gt; 'roles',
                               }
                           },
                           admins =&gt; {
                               credential =&gt; {
                                   class =&gt; 'Password',
                                   password_field =&gt; 'password',
                                   password_type =&gt; 'clear'
                               },
                               store =&gt; {
                                   class =&gt; '+MyApp::Authentication::Store::NetAuth',
                                   authserver =&gt; '192.168.10.17'
                               }
                           }
                       }
           );

       NOTE: Until version 0.10008 of this module, you would need to put all the realms inside a "realms" key in
       the configuration. Please see "COMPATIBILITY CONFIGURATION" for more information

       use_session
           Whether  or  not to store the user's logged in state in the session, if the application is also using
           Catalyst::Plugin::Session. This value is set to true per default.

           However, even if use_session is disabled, if any code touches $c-&gt;session, a session object  will  be
           auto-vivified  and  session  Cookies  will  be  sent  in  the  headers. To prevent accidental session
           creation, check if a session already exists with if ($c-&gt;sessionid) { ... }. If the  session  doesn't
           exist, then don't place anything in the session to prevent an unnecessary session from being created.

       default_realm
           This  defines which realm should be used as when no realm is provided to methods that require a realm
           such as authenticate or find_user.

       realm refs
           The Plugin::Authentication config hash contains the series of realm configurations you  want  to  use
           for  your  app.  The  only  rule here is that there must be at least one. A realm consists of a name,
           which is used to reference the realm, a credential  and  a  store.   You  may  also  put  your  realm
           configurations  within a subelement called 'realms' if you desire to separate them from the remainder
           of your configuration.  Note that if you use a 'realms' subelement, you must put ALL of  your  realms
           within it.

           You    can    also    specify    a    realm   class   to   instantiate   instead   of   the   default
           Catalyst::Authentication::Realm class using the 'class' element within the realm config.

           Each realm config contains two hashes, one called 'credential' and one called 'store', each of  which
           provide configuration details to the respective modules.  The contents of these hashes is specific to
           the module being used, with the exception of the 'class' element, which tells the core Authentication
           module the classname to instantiate.

           The  'class'  element  follows  the standard Catalyst mechanism of class specification. If a class is
           prefixed with a +, it is assumed to be a complete class name. Otherwise it  is  considered  to  be  a
           portion  of  the  class  name. For credentials, the classname '<b>Password</b>', for example, is expanded to
           Catalyst::Authentication::Credential::<b>Password</b>. For stores, the classname '<b>storename</b>' is expanded to:
           Catalyst::Authentication::Store::<b>storename</b>.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>$c-&gt;authenticate(</b> <b>$userinfo</b> <b>[,</b> <b>$realm</b> <b>])</b>
       Attempts to authenticate the user using the information in the $userinfo hash reference using  the  realm
       $realm. $realm may be omitted, in which case the default realm is checked.

   <b>$c-&gt;user(</b> <b>)</b>
       Returns  the currently logged in user, or undef if there is none.  Normally the user is re-retrieved from
       the store.  For Catalyst::Authentication::Store::DBIx::Class the user is re-restored  using  the  primary
       key of the user table.  Thus <b>user</b> can throw an error even though <b>user_exists</b> returned true.

   <b>$c-&gt;user_exists(</b> <b>)</b>
       Returns  true  if  a  user  is  logged  in right now. The difference between <b>user_exists</b> and <b>user</b> is that
       user_exists will return true if a user is logged in, even if it has  not  been  yet  retrieved  from  the
       storage  backend.  If  you only need to know if the user is logged in, depending on the storage mechanism
       this can be much more efficient.  <b>user_exists</b> only looks into the session while <b>user</b> is trying to restore
       the user.

   <b>$c-&gt;user_in_realm(</b> <b>$realm</b> <b>)</b>
       Works like user_exists, except that it only returns true if a user is both logged in right  now  and  was
       retrieved from the realm provided.

   <b>$c-&gt;logout(</b> <b>)</b>
       Logs  the  user  out.  Deletes the currently logged in user from "$c-&gt;user" and the session.  It does not
       delete the session.

   <b>$c-&gt;find_user(</b> <b>$userinfo,</b> <b>$realm</b> <b>)</b>
       Fetch a particular users details, matching the provided user info, from the realm specified in $realm.

           $user = $c-&gt;find_user({ id =&gt; $id });
           $c-&gt;set_authenticated($user); # logs the user in and calls persist_user

   <b>persist_user()</b>
       Under normal circumstances the user data is only saved to  the  session  during  initial  authentication.
       This call causes the auth system to save the currently authenticated user's data across requests.  Useful
       if  you have changed the user data and want to ensure that future requests reflect the most current data.
       Assumes that at the time of this call, $c-&gt;user contains the most current data.

   <b>find_realm_for_persisted_user()</b>
       Private method, do not call from user code!

</pre><h4><b>INTERNAL</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       These methods are for Catalyst::Plugin::Authentication <b>INTERNAL</b> <b>USE</b> only.  Please do not use them in your
       own code, whether application or credential / store modules. If you do, you  will  very  likely  get  the
       nasty  shock  of  having to fix / rewrite your code when things change. They are documented here only for
       reference.

   <b>$c-&gt;set_authenticated(</b> <b>$user,</b> <b>$realmname</b> <b>)</b>
       Marks a user as authenticated. This is called from within the  authenticate  routine  when  a  credential
       returns a user. $realmname defaults to 'default'.  You can use find_user to get $user

   <b>$c-&gt;auth_restore_user(</b> <b>$user,</b> <b>$realmname</b> <b>)</b>
       Used  to  restore  a user from the session. In most cases this is called without arguments to restore the
       user via the session. Can be called with  arguments  when  restoring  a  user  from  some  other  method.
       Currently not used in this way.

   <b>$c-&gt;auth_realms(</b> <b>)</b>
       Returns  a  hashref containing realmname -&gt; realm instance pairs. Realm instances contain an instantiated
       store and credential object as the 'store' and 'credential' elements, respectively

   <b>$c-&gt;get_auth_realm(</b> <b>$realmname</b> <b>)</b>
       Retrieves the realm instance for the realmname provided.

   <b>$c-&gt;update_user_in_session</b>
       This was a short-lived method to update user information - you should use persist_user instead.

   <b>$c-&gt;setup_auth_realm(</b> <b>)</b>

</pre><h4><b>DON'T</b> <b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       This  module  along  with  its  sub  plugins  deprecate  a  great  number of other modules. These include
       Catalyst::Plugin::Authentication::Simple, Catalyst::Plugin::Authentication::CDBI.

</pre><h4><b>INCOMPATABILITIES</b></h4><pre>
       The realms-based configuration and functionality of the 0.10 update  of  Catalyst::Plugin::Authentication
       required  a  change  in the API used by credentials and stores.  It has a compatibility mode which allows
       use of modules that have not yet been updated.  This,  however,  completely  mimics  the  older  api  and
       disables  the  new  realm-based  features.  In  other words you cannot mix the older credential and store
       modules with realms, or realm-based configs. The changes required to update modules are relatively  minor
       and  are  covered in Catalyst::Plugin::Authentication::Internals.  We hope that most modules will move to
       the compatible list above very quickly.

</pre><h4><b>COMPATIBILITY</b> <b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       Until version 0.10008 of this module, you needed to put all the realms  inside  a  "realms"  key  in  the
       configuration.

           # example
           __PACKAGE__-&gt;config( 'Plugin::Authentication' =&gt;
                       {
                           default_realm =&gt; 'members',
                           realms =&gt; {
                               members =&gt; {
                                   ...
                               },
                           },
                       }
           );

       If  you  use  the  old,  deprecated "__PACKAGE__-&gt;config( 'authentication' )" configuration key, then the
       realms key is still required.

</pre><h4><b>COMPATIBILITY</b> <b>ROUTINES</b></h4><pre>
       In version 0.10 of Catalyst::Plugin::Authentication, the API changed. For app developers, this change  is
       fairly minor, but for Credential and Store authors, the changes are significant.

       Please   see  the  documentation  in  version  0.09  of  Catalyst::Plugin::Authentication  for  a  better
       understanding of how the old API functioned.

       The items below are still present in the plugin, though using them is deprecated. They remain only  as  a
       transition  tool,  for  those  sites  which  can  not  yet be upgraded to use the new system due to local
       customizations or use of Credential / Store modules that have not yet been updated to work with  the  new
       API.

       These  routines  should  not  be used in any application using realms functionality or any of the methods
       described above. These are for reference purposes only.

   <b>$c-&gt;login(</b> <b>)</b>
       This method is used to initiate authentication and user retrieval. Technically this is part  of  the  old
       Password  credential module and it still resides in the Password class. It is included here for reference
       only.

   <b>$c-&gt;default_auth_store(</b> <b>)</b>
       Return the store whose name is 'default'.

       This is set to "$c-&gt;config( 'Plugin::Authentication' =&gt; { store =&gt; # Store} )" if that value  exists,  or
       by using a Store plugin:

           # load the Minimal authentication store.
           use Catalyst qw/Authentication Authentication::Store::Minimal/;

       Sets the default store to Catalyst::Plugin::Authentication::Store::Minimal.

   <b>$c-&gt;get_auth_store(</b> <b>$name</b> <b>)</b>
       Return the store whose name is $name.

   <b>$c-&gt;get_auth_store_name(</b> <b>$store</b> <b>)</b>
       Return the name of the store $store.

   <b>$c-&gt;auth_stores(</b> <b>)</b>
       A hash keyed by name, with the stores registered in the app.

   <b>$c-&gt;register_auth_stores(</b> <b>%stores_by_name</b> <b>)</b>
       Register stores into the application.

   <b>$c-&gt;auth_store_names(</b> <b>)</b>
   <b>$c-&gt;get_user(</b> <b>)</b>
