</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       CGI::Application::Plugin::Authentication::Display - Generate bits of HTML needed for authentication

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The purpose of this code is to keep display code away from the back-end of authentication management. It
       is an abstract base class and must be used in conjunction with derived classes. Those derived classes can
       be used in an number of ways:

       •   The   subclass   CGI::Application::Plugin::Authentication::Display::Classic  is  provided  to  ensure
           backwards compatibility with the old code. It has the advantage of working out of the box  but  still
           retaining flexibility.

       •   The  subclass  CGI::Application::Plugin::Authentication::Display::Basic  is  provided to ensure XHTML
           compliance and to leave styling to CSS style-sheets.

       •   You can handle all the HTML side yourself in which case this code is not even loaded.

       •   You can use derived classes in templates that have dot support, which keeps the display code close to
           the templates. This has other advantages. For example one can use the "enforce_protection" method  to
           mark  a template as being only viewable after authentication. A number of other methods can be called
           from the template that provide information about the authentication status.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>new</b>
       The constructor must be passed the CGI::Application object as the first non-object argument.  This allows
       derived modules to access the authentication information.

   <b>login_box</b>
       This method will return the HTML for a login box that can be embedded into another  page.   This  is  the
       same login box that is used in the default authen_login runmode that the plugin provides.

       This  function  is  not  implemented  in  this  module.  One must use a derived class with an appropriate
       implementation of this function.

   <b>logout_form</b>
       This returns the simple bit of HTML need to have a logout button. The form has '/?authen_logout=1' as the
       action but of course this can be changed in derived modules.

   <b>enforce_protection</b>
       This method is useful when the class is being used in  templates  to  mark  a  certain  template  as  for
       authenticated eyes only. So in HTML::Template::Plugin::Dot one might have

           &lt;TMPL_VAR NAME="authen.enforce_protection"&gt;

       and  one  must  set  "authen"  to  one  of  these  objects  via  the  "HTML::Template::param"  method. If
       authenticated it will resolve to a simple string, otherwise it will croak.

   <b>login_title</b>
       This returns the <u>TITLE</u> parameter from the <u>LOGIN_FORM</u> section of the config.

   <b>is_authenticated</b>
   <b>username</b>
   <b>last_login</b>
   <b>last_access</b>
   <b>is_login_timeout</b>
   <b>login_attempts</b>
       These methods all provide access to the cognate methods on the authentication object. They  are  provided
       as templates might find them expressive.
