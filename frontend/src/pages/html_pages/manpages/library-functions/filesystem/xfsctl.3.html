       xfsctl - control XFS filesystems and individual files

</pre><h4><b>C</b> <b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;xfs/xfs.h&gt;</b>

       <b>int</b> <b>xfsctl(const</b> <b>char</b> <b>*</b><u>path</u><b>,</b> <b>int</b> <u>fd</u><b>,</b> <b>int</b> <u>cmd</u><b>,</b> <b>void</b> <b>*</b><u>ptr</u><b>);</b>

       <b>int</b> <b>platform_test_xfs_fd(int</b> <u>fd</u><b>);</b>
       <b>int</b> <b>platform_test_xfs_path(const</b> <b>char</b> <b>*</b><u>path</u><b>);</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Some functionality specific to the XFS filesystem is accessible to applications through platform-specific
       system  call  interfaces.  These operations can be divided into two sections - operations that operate on
       individual files, and operations that operate on the filesystem itself. Care should be taken when issuing
       <b>xfsctl</b>() calls to ensure the target path and file descriptor (both must be supplied) do indeed  represent
       a  file  from  an  XFS  filesystem.   The  <b><a href="../man2/statfs.2.html">statfs</a></b>(2) and <b><a href="../man2/fstatfs.2.html">fstatfs</a></b>(2) system calls can be used to determine
       whether or not an arbitrary path or file descriptor belong to an XFS filesystem.  These are not  portable
       however,  so  the  routines  <b>platform_test_xfs_fd</b>()  and  <b>platform_test_xfs_path</b>()  provide  a  platform-
       independent mechanism.

   <b>File</b> <b>Operations</b>
       In order to effect an operation on an individual file, the pathname and descriptor  arguments  passed  to
       <b>xfsctl</b>  identifies  the  file  being operated on.  The final argument described below refers to the final
       argument of <b>xfsctl</b>.  All  of  the  data  structures  and  macros  mentioned  below  are  defined  in  the
       &lt;<u>xfs/xfs_fs.h</u>&gt; header file.

       <b>XFS_IOC_ALLOCSP</b>
       <b>XFS_IOC_ALLOCSP64</b>
       <b>XFS_IOC_FREESP</b>
       <b>XFS_IOC_FREESP64</b>
              Alter  storage  space  associated  with  a section of the ordinary file specified.  The section is
              specified by a variable of type <b>xfs_flock64_t</b>, pointed to by the final argument.   The  data  type
              <b>xfs_flock64_t</b> contains the following members: <b>l_whence</b> is 0, 1, or 2 to indicate that the relative
              offset  <b>l_start</b>  will  be measured from the start of the file, the current position, or the end of
              the file, respectively (i.e., <b>l_start</b> is the offset from the position specified in <b>l_whence</b>).   If
              the  offset  specified  is  before  the current end of file, any data previously written into this
              section is no longer accessible.  If the offset specified is beyond the current end of  file,  the
              file  is grown and filled with zeroes.  The <b>l_len</b> field is currently ignored, and should be set to
              zero.

              <b>XFS_IOC_ALLOCSP</b>,  <b>XFS_IOC_ALLOCSP64</b>,  <b>XFS_IOC_FREESP</b>  and  <b>XFS_IOC_FREESP64</b>  operations  are   all
              identical.

              These ioctls are no longer supported as of Linux 5.17.

       <b>XFS_IOC_FSSETDM</b>
              Set the di_dmevmask and di_dmstate fields in an XFS on-disk inode.  The only legitimate values for
              these  fields  are  those  previously  returned  in  the  <b>bs_dmevmask</b> and <b>bs_dmstate</b> fields of the
              bulkstat structure.  The data referred to by the final  argument  is  a  <b>struct</b>  <b>fsdmidata</b>.   This
              structure's  members  are <b>fsd_dmevmask</b> and <b>fsd_dmstate</b>.  The di_dmevmask field is set to the value
              in <b>fsd_dmevmask</b>.  The di_dmstate field is set to  the  value  in  <b>fsd_dmstate</b>.   This  command  is
              restricted  to  root  or to processes with device management capabilities.  Its sole purpose is to
              allow backup and restore programs to restore the aforementioned  critical  on-disk  inode  fields.
              This ioctl is not supported as of Linux 5.5.

       <b>XFS_IOC_DIOINFO</b>
              Get  information  required  to perform direct I/O on the specified file descriptor.  Direct I/O is
              performed directly to and from a user's data buffer.  Since the kernel's buffer cache is no longer
              between the two, the user's data buffer must conform to the same type of constraints  as  required
              for  accessing  a  raw  disk  partition.   The  final argument points to a variable of type <b>struct</b>
              <b>dioattr</b>, which contains the following members: <b>d_mem</b> is the memory alignment  requirement  of  the
              user's  data buffer.  <b>d_miniosz</b> specifies block size, minimum I/O request size, and I/O alignment.
              The size of all I/O requests must be a multiple of this amount and the value of the  seek  pointer
              at  the time of the I/O request must also be an integer multiple of this amount.  <b>d_maxiosz</b> is the
              maximum I/O request size which can be performed on the file descriptor.  If an  I/O  request  does
              not  meet  these constraints, the <b><a href="../man2/read.2.html">read</a></b>(2) or <b><a href="../man2/write.2.html">write</a></b>(2) will fail with EINVAL.  All I/O requests are
              kept consistent with any data brought into the cache with an access through a non-direct I/O  file
              descriptor.

       <b>XFS_IOC_FSGETXATTR</b>
       <b>XFS_IOC_FSGETXATTRA</b>
       <b>XFS_IOC_FSSETXATTR</b>
              See <b><a href="../man2/ioctl_xfs_fsgetxattr.2.html">ioctl_xfs_fsgetxattr</a></b>(2) for more information.

       <b>XFS_IOC_GETBMAP</b>
       <b>XFS_IOC_GETBMAPA</b>
       <b>XFS_IOC_GETBMAPX</b>
              See <b><a href="../man2/ioctl_getbmap.2.html">ioctl_getbmap</a></b>(2) for more information.

       <b>XFS_IOC_RESVSP</b>
       <b>XFS_IOC_RESVSP64</b>
              This  command  is used to allocate space to a file.  A range of bytes is specified using a pointer
              to a variable of type <b>xfs_flock64_t</b> in the final argument.  The  blocks  are  allocated,  but  not
              zeroed,  and the file size does not change.  If the XFS filesystem is configured to flag unwritten
              file extents, performance will be negatively affected when writing to  preallocated  space,  since
              extra  filesystem  transactions  are  required  to  convert  extent flags on the range of the file
              written.  If <b><a href="../man8/xfs_info.8.html">xfs_info</a></b>(8) reports unwritten=1, then the  filesystem  was  made  to  flag  unwritten
              extents.

       <b>XFS_IOC_UNRESVSP</b>
       <b>XFS_IOC_UNRESVSP64</b>
              This  command is used to free space from a file.  A range of bytes is specified using a pointer to
              a variable of type <b>xfs_flock64_t</b> in the final argument.  Partial filesystem blocks are zeroed, and
              whole filesystem blocks are removed from the file.  The file size does not change.

       <b>XFS_IOC_ZERO_RANGE</b>
              This command is used to convert a range of a file to zeros without issuing data IO.   A  range  of
              bytes  is  specified  using  a  pointer to a variable of type <b>xfs_flock64_t</b> in the final argument.
              Blocks are preallocated for regions that span holes in the file, and the entire range is converted
              to unwritten extents.  This operation is a fast method of overwriting any from the range specified
              with zeros without removing any blocks or having to write zeros to disk.  Any subsequent  read  in
              the  given  range  will  return  zeros  until  new  data  is written.  This functionality requires
              filesystems to support unwritten extents.  If <b><a href="../man8/xfs_info.8.html">xfs_info</a></b>(8) reports unwritten=1, then the filesystem
              was made to flag unwritten extents.

       <b>XFS_IOC_PATH_TO_FSHANDLE</b>

       <b>XFS_IOC_ATTR_MULTI_BY_HANDLE</b>
       <b>XFS_IOC_FSSETDM_BY_HANDLE</b>
              These  are  all  interfaces  that  are  used  to  implement  various  <u>libhandle</u>   functions   (see
              <b><a href="../man3/open_by_handle.3.html">open_by_handle</a></b>(3)).   They  are  all  subject  to  change  and  should  not  be called directly by
              applications.  XFS_IOC_FSSETDM_BY_HANDLE is not supported as of Linux 5.5.

   <b>Filesystem</b> <b>Operations</b>
       In order to effect one of the following operations, the  pathname  and  descriptor  arguments  passed  to
