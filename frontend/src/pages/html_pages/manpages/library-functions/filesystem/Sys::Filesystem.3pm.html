       Sys::Filesystem - Retrieve list of filesystems and their properties

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use strict;
           use Sys::Filesystem ();

           # Method 1
           my $fs = Sys::Filesystem-&gt;new();
           my @filesystems = $fs-&gt;filesystems();
           for (@filesystems)
           {
               printf("%s is a %s filesystem mounted on %s\n",
                                 $fs-&gt;mount_point($_),
                                 $fs-&gt;format($_),
                                 $fs-&gt;device($_)
                          );
           }

           # Method 2
           my $weird_fs = Sys::Filesystem-&gt;new(
                                 fstab =&gt; '/etc/weird/vfstab.conf',
                                 mtab  =&gt; '/etc/active_mounts',
                                 xtab  =&gt; '/etc/nfs/mounts'
                           );
           my @weird_filesystems = $weird_fs-&gt;filesystems();

           # Method 3 (nice but naughty)
           my @filesystems = Sys::Filesystem-&gt;filesystems();

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Sys::Filesystem is intended to be a portable interface to list and query filesystem names and their
       properties. At the time of writing there were only Solaris and Win32 modules available on CPAN to perform
       this kind of operation.  This module hopes to provide a consistent API to list all, mounted, unmounted
       and special filesystems on a system, and query as many properties as possible with common aliases
       wherever possible.

</pre><h4><b>INHERITANCE</b></h4><pre>
         Sys::Filesystem
         ISA UNIVERSAL

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       new Creates  a  new  Sys::Filesystem  object. "new" accepts following optional key value pairs to help or
           force where mount information is gathered from. These values are not otherwise defaulted by the  main
           Sys::Filesystem  object, but left to the platform specific helper modules to determine as an exercise
           of common sense.

           canondev
               Specify whether device path's shall be resolved when they're a symbolic link.

               $Sys::Filesystem::CANONDEV is used when no key "canondev" is passed.

           fstab
               Specify the full path and filename of  the  filesystem  table  (or  fstab  for  short).  Not  all
               platforms have such a file and so this option may be ignored on some systems.

               $Sys::Filesystem::FSTAB is used when no key "fstab" is passed.

           mtab
               Specify  the  full path and filename of the mounted filesystem table (or mtab for short). Not all
               platforms have such a file and so this option may be ignored on some systems.

               $Sys::Filesystem::MTAB is used when no key "mtab" is passed.

           xtab
               <b>DEPRECIATED</b> Specify the full path and filename of the mounted NFS filesystem table (or  xtab  for
               short).  This is usually only pertinent to Unix bases systems.  Not all helper modules will query
               NFS mounts as a separate exercise, and therefore this option may be ignored on some systems.

               <b>None</b> of the OS plugins use that tunable (anymore?), so now a warning is raised  when  it's  used.
               The  entire  support will be removed not before 2015. Once that happened, using "xtab" will raise
               an exception.

           aliases
               Overrides internal aliasing table used to match queries against OS plugin. This  should  be  used
               only when dealing with closed source platform helper module(s).

       supported
           Returns  true if the operating system is supported by Sys::Filesystem.  Unsupported operating systems
           may get less information, e.g. the mount state couldn't determined  or  which  file  system  type  is
           special isn't known.

   <b>Listing</b> <b>Filesystems</b>
       <b>filesystems()</b>
           Returns  a  list  of  all  filesystem.  May  accept  an  optional list of key pair values in order to
           filter/restrict the results which are returned. The restrictions are evaluated to match  as  much  as
           possible, so asking for regular and special file system (or mounted and special file systems), you'll
           get all.

           For better understanding, please imagine the parameters like:

             @fslist = $fs-&gt;filesystems( mounted =&gt; 1, special =&gt; 1 );
             # results similar as
             SELECT mountpoint FROM filesystems WHERE mounted = 1 OR special = 1

           If you need other selection choices, please take a look at DBD::Sys.

           Valid values are as follows:

           device =&gt; "string"
               Returns only filesystems that are mounted using the device of "string".  For example:

                   my $fdd_filesytem = Sys::Filesystem-&gt;filesystems(device =&gt; "/dev/fd0");

           mounted =&gt; 1
               Returns  only  filesystems  which  can  be confirmed as actively mounted.  (Filesystems which are
               mounted).

               The <b>mounted_filesystems()</b> method is an alias for this syntax.

           unmounted =&gt; 1
               Returns only filesystems which cannot be confirmed as actively mounted.  (Filesystems  which  are
               not mounted).

               The <b>unmounted_filesystems()</b> method is an alias for this syntax.

           special =&gt; 1
               Returns  only  filesystems  which  are regarded as special in some way. A filesystem is marked as
               special by the operating specific helper module. For example, a  tmpfs  type  filesystem  on  one
               operating  system  might  be  regarded  as  a  special filesystem, but not on others. Consult the
               documentation of the operating system specific helper module for further information  about  your
               system. (Sys::Filesystem::Linux for Linux or Sys::Filesystem::Solaris for Solaris etc).

               This parameter is mutually exclusive to "regular".

               The <b>special_filesystems()</b> method is an alias for this syntax.

           regular =&gt; 1
               Returns only fileystems which are not regarded as special. (Normal filesystems).

               This parameter is mutually exclusive to "special".

               The <b>regular_filesystems()</b> method is an alias for this syntax.

       <b>mounted_filesystems()</b>
           Returns a list of all filesystems which can be verified as currently being mounted.

       <b>unmounted_filesystems()</b>
           Returns a list of all filesystems which cannot be verified as currently being mounted.

       <b>special_filesystems()</b>
           Returns  a  list  of  all fileystems which are considered special. This will usually contain meta and
           swap partitions like <a href="file:/proc">/proc</a> and <a href="file:/dev/shm">/dev/shm</a> on Linux.

       <b>regular_filesystems()</b>
           Returns a list of all filesystems which are not considered to be special.

   <b>Filesystem</b> <b>Properties</b>
       Available filesystem properties and their names vary wildly between platforms.  Common aliases have  been
       provided  wherever possible. You should check the documentation of the specific platform helper module to
       list  all  of  the  properties  which  are  available  for  that  platform.   For   example,   read   the
       Sys::Filesystem::Linux  documentation  for  a  list of all filesystem properties available to query under
       Linux.

       <b>mount_point()</b> or <b>filesystem()</b>
           Returns the friendly name of the filesystem. This will usually be the same name  as  appears  in  the
           list returned by the <b>filesystems()</b> method.

       <b>mounted()</b>
           Returns boolean true if the filesystem is mounted.

       <b>label()</b>
           Returns the fileystem label.

           This  functionality  may  need  to  be  retrofitted to some original OS specific helper modules as of
           Sys::Filesystem 1.12.

       <b>volume()</b>
           Returns the volume that the filesystem belongs to or is mounted on.

           This functionality may need to be retrofitted to some original  OS  specific  helper  modules  as  of
           Sys::Filesystem 1.12.

       <b>device()</b>
           Returns the physical device that the filesystem is connected to.

       <b>special()</b>
           Returns boolean true if the filesystem type is considered "special".

       <b>type()</b> or <b>format()</b>
           Returns the type of filesystem format. fat32, ntfs, ufs, hpfs, ext3, xfs etc.

       <b>options()</b>
           Returns  the options that the filesystem was mounted with. This may commonly contain information such
           as read-write, user and group settings and permissions.

       <b>mount_order()</b>
           Returns the order in which this filesystem should be mounted on boot.

       <b>check_order()</b>
           Returns the order in which this filesystem should be consistency checked on boot.

       <b>check_frequency()</b>
           Returns how often this filesystem is checked for consistency.

</pre><h4><b>OS</b> <b>SPECIFIC</b> <b>HELPER</b> <b>MODULES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Dummy</b>
       The Dummy module is there to provide a default failover result to the main Sys::Filesystem module  if  no
       suitable  platform  specific  module  can  be found or successfully loaded. This is the last module to be
       tried, in order of platform, Unix (if not on Win32), and then Dummy.

   <b>Unix</b>
       The Unix module is intended to provide a "best guess" failover result to the main Sys::Filesystem  module
       if no suitable platform specific module can be found, and the platform is not 'MSWin32'.

       This module requires additional work to improve it's guestimation abilities.

   <b>Darwin</b>
       First written by Christian Renz &lt;<a href="mailto:crenz@web42.com">crenz@web42.com</a>&gt;.

   <b>Win32</b>
       Provides "mount_point" and "device" of mounted filesystems on Windows.

   <b>AIX</b>
       Please  be  aware  that the AIX /etc/filesystems file has both a "type" and "vfs" field. The "type" field
       should not be confused with the filesystem format/type (that is stored in the "vfs" field). You may  wish
       to  use  the  "format"  field when querying for filesystem types, since it is aliased to be more reliable
       accross different platforms.

   <b>Other</b>
       Linux, Solaris, Cygwin, FreeBSD, NetBSD, HP-UX.

   <b>OS</b> <b>Identifiers</b>
       The following list is taken from perlport. Please refer to the original source for the most  up  to  date
       version.  This  information  should  help  anyone who wishes to write a helper module for a new platform.
       Modules should have the same name as ^O in title caps. Thus 'openbsd' becomes 'Openbsd.pm'.

</pre><h4><b>REQUIREMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Sys::Filesystem requires Perl &gt;= 5.6 to run.

</pre><h4><b>TODO</b></h4><pre>
       Add support for Tru64, MidnightBSD, Haiku, Minix, DragonflyBSD and OpenBSD.  Please  contact  me  if  you
       would like to provide code for these operating systems.

</pre><h4><b>SUPPORT</b></h4><pre>
