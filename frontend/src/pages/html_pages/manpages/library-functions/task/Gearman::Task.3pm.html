</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Gearman::Task - a task in Gearman, from the point of view of a client

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           my $task = Gearman::Task-&gt;new("add", "1+2", {
                   ...
           });

           $taskset-&gt;add_task($task);
           $client-&gt;do_task($task);
           $client-&gt;dispatch_background($task);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Gearman::Task</u> is a Gearman::Client's representation of a task to be done.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Gearman::Task-&gt;new($func,</b> <b>$arg,</b> <b>\%options)</b>
       Creates a new <u>Gearman::Task</u> object, and returns the object.

       <u>$func</u> is the function name to be run.  (that you have a worker registered to process)

       <u>$arg</u> is an opaque scalar or scalarref representing the argument(s) to pass to the distributed function.
       If you want to pass multiple arguments, you must encode them somehow into this one.  That's up to you and
       your worker.

       <u>%options</u> can contain:

       •   uniq

           A  key  which  indicates  to  the server that other tasks with the same function name and key will be
           merged into one.  That is, the task will be run just once, but all the listeners waiting on that  job
           will get the response multiplexed back to them.

           Uniq  may also contain the magic value "-" (a single hyphen) which means the uniq key is the contents
           of the args.

       •   on_complete

           A subroutine reference to be invoked when the task is completed. The  subroutine  will  be  passed  a
           reference to the return value from the worker process.

       •   on_fail

           A subroutine reference to be invoked when the task fails (or fails for the last time, if retries were
           specified). The reason could be passed to this callback as an argument. This callback won't be called
           after a failure if more retries are still possible.

       •   on_retry

           A subroutine reference to be invoked when the task fails, but is about to be retried.

           Is passed one argument, what retry attempt number this is.  (starts with 1)

       •   on_status

           A  subroutine  reference  to  be  invoked  if the task emits status updates.  Arguments passed to the
           subref are ($numerator, $denominator), where those are left up to the client and job to determine.

       •   on_warning

           A subroutine reference to be invoked if the task emits  status  updates.   Arguments  passed  to  the
           subref are ($numerator, $denominator), where those are left up to the client and job to determine.

       •   retry_count

           Number of times job will be retried if there are failures.  Defaults to 0.

       •   high_priority

           <b>the</b>  <b>option</b>  <b>high_priority</b>  <b>is</b> <b>deprecated</b>. Use "priority =&gt; high" instead.  Boolean, whether this job
           should take priority over other jobs already enqueued.

       •   priority

           valid value:

           •   high

           •   normal (defaul)

           •   low

       •   timeout

           Automatically fail, calling your on_fail callback, after this many seconds have  elapsed  without  an
           on_fail  or  on_complete  being  called.  Defaults to 0, which means never.  Bypasses any retry_count
           remaining.

       •   try_timeout

           Automatically fail, calling your on_retry callback (or on_fail if out of retries),  after  this  many
           seconds have elapsed. Defaults to 0, which means never.
