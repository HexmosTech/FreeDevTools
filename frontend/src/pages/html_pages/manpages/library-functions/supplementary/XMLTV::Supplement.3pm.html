</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       XMLTV::Supplement - Supplementary file loader for XMLTV grabbers

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Utility library that loads supplementary files for xmltv-grabbers and other programs in the xmltv-
       distribution.

       Supplementary files can be loaded either via http or from a local file, depending on the configuration of
       the module. The default is to load the files from <a href="http://supplement.xmltv.org">http://supplement.xmltv.org</a>. This can be changed by
       setting the environment variable XMLTV_SUPPLEMENT to the new root-directory or root-url for supplementary
       files.

</pre><h4><b>EXPORTED</b> <b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       All these functions are exported on demand.

       GetSupplement
           Load a supplement file and return it as a string. Takes two parameters: directory and filename.

               my $content = GetSupplement( 'tv_grab_uk_rt', 'channel_ids' );

           GetSupplement will always return a string with the content. If it fails to get the content, it prints
           an error-message and aborts the program.

       GetSupplementLines
           Load  a supplement file and return it as an array. Any comments or blank lines will be removed. Takes
           two parameters: directory and filename.

               my $content = GetSupplementLines( 'tv_grab_uk_rt', 'channel_ids' );

           GetSupplementLines will always return an array with the content. If it fails to get the  content,  it
           prints an error-message and aborts the program.

       GetSupplementFile
           Get the supplement file from the local machine

       GetSupplementUrl
           Get the supplement file from a URL

       GetSupplementDir
           Get the base directory containing supplementary files.
              e.g. $ENV{HOME}/.xmltv/supplement

       SetSupplementRoot
           Set the root directory for loading supplementary files.

               SetSupplementRoot( '/usr/share/xmltv' );
               SetSupplementRoot( '<a href="http://my.server.org/xmltv">http://my.server.org/xmltv</a>' );

       GetSupplementRoot
           Get the root directory for loading supplementary files.

</pre><h4><b>CACHING</b></h4><pre>
       The  module stores all downloaded files in a cache. The cache is stored on disk in <a href="file:~/.xmltv/supplement">~/.xmltv/supplement</a> on
       Unix and in CSIDL_LOCAL_APPDATA//xmltv/supplement on Windows.

       If a file has been downloaded less than 1 hour ago, the file from the cache is  used  without  contacting
       the  server. Otherwise, if the file has been downloaded more than 1 hour ago, then the module checks with
       the server to see if an updated file is available and downloads it if necessary.

       If the server does not respond or returns an error-message, a warning is printed to STDERR and  the  file
       from the cache is used.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       The  XMLTV_SUPPLEMENT  environment  variable can be used to tell the module where the supplementary files
       are found.

         XMLTV_SUPPLEMENT=/usr/share/xmltv
         XMLTV_SUPPLEMENT=<a href="http://supplementary.xmltv.se">http://supplementary.xmltv.se</a>

       The  XMLTV_SUPPLEMENT_VERBOSE  environment  variable  can  be  used  to  get  more  debug   output   from
       XMLTV::Supplement.

         XMLTV_SUPPLEMENT_VERBOSE=1
