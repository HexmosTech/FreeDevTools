</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       SDL_HINT_VIDEO_WAYLAND_SCALE_TO_DISPLAY  -  A variable forcing non-DPI-aware Wayland windows to output at
       1:1 scaling.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;SDL3/SDL_hints.h&gt;</b>

       <b>#define</b> <b>SDL_HINT_VIDEO_WAYLAND_SCALE_TO_DISPLAY</b> <b>"SDL_VIDEO_WAYLAND_SCALE_TO_DISPLAY"</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This must be set before initializing the video subsystem.

       When this hint is set, Wayland windows that are not flagged  as  being  DPI-aware  will  be  output  with
       scaling designed to force 1:1 pixel mapping.

       This  is intended to allow legacy applications to be displayed without desktop scaling being applied, and
       has issues with certain display configurations, as this forces the window to behave in a way that Wayland
       desktops were not designed to accommodate:

       • Rounding errors can result with odd window sizes and/or desktop scales,  which  can  cause  the  window
       contents to appear slightly blurry.

       • Positioning the window may be imprecise due to unit conversions and rounding.

       • The window may be unusably small on scaled desktops.

       • The window may jump in size when moving between displays of different scale factors.

       • Displays may appear to overlap when using a multi-monitor setup with scaling enabled.

       • Possible loss of cursor precision due to the logical size of the window being reduced.

       New applications should be designed with proper DPI awareness handling instead of enabling this.

       The variable can be set to the following values:

       • "0": Windows will be scaled normally.

       • "1": Windows will be forced to scale to achieve 1:1 output.

       This hint should be set before creating a window.

</pre><h4><b>AVAILABILITY</b></h4><pre>
       This hint is available since SDL 3.2.0.
