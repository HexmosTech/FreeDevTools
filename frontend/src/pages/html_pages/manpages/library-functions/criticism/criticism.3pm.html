</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       criticism - Perl pragma to enforce coding standards and best-practices

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use criticism;

         use criticism 'gentle';
         use criticism 'stern';
         use criticism 'harsh';
         use criticism 'cruel';
         use criticism 'brutal';

         use criticism ( -profile =&gt; '/foo/bar/perlcriticrc' );
         use criticism ( -severity =&gt; 3, -verbose =&gt; '%m at %f line %l' );

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This pragma enforces coding standards and promotes best-practices by running your file through
       Perl::Critic before every execution.  In a production system, this usually isn't feasible because it adds
       a lot of overhead at start-up.  If you have a separate development environment, you can effectively
       bypass the "criticism" pragma by not installing Perl::Critic in the production environment.  If
       Perl::Critic can't be loaded, then "criticism" just fails silently.

       Alternatively, the "perlcritic" command-line (which is distributed with Perl::Critic) can be used to
       analyze your files on-demand and has some additional configuration features.  And Test::Perl::Critic
       provides a nice interface for analyzing files during the build process.

       If you'd like to try Perl::Critic without installing anything, there is a web-service available at
       &lt;<a href="http://perlcritic.com">http://perlcritic.com</a>&gt;.  The web-service does not yet support all the configuration features that are
       available in the native Perl::Critic API, but it should give you a good idea of what it does.  You can
       also invoke the perlcritic web-service from the command line by doing an HTTP-post, such as one of these:

         $&gt; POST <a href="http://perlcritic.com/perl/critic.pl">http://perlcritic.com/perl/critic.pl</a> &lt; MyModule.pm
         $&gt; lwp-request -m POST <a href="http://perlcritic.com/perl/critic.pl">http://perlcritic.com/perl/critic.pl</a> &lt; MyModule.pm
         $&gt; wget -q -O - --post-file=MyModule.pm <a href="http://perlcritic.com/perl/critic.pl">http://perlcritic.com/perl/critic.pl</a>

       Please note that the perlcritic web-service is still alpha code.  The URL and interface to the service
       are subject to change.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       If there is <b>exactly</b> <b>one</b> import argument, then it is taken to be a named equivalent to one of the numeric
       severity levels supported by Perl::Critic.  For example, "use criticism 'gentle';" is equivalent to
       setting the "-severity =&gt; 5", which reports only the most dangerous violations.  On the other hand, "use
       criticism 'brutal';" is like setting the "-severity =&gt; 1", which reports <b>every</b> violation.  If there are
       no import arguments, then it defaults to 'gentle'.

       If there is more than one import argument, then they will all be passed directly into the Perl::Critic
       constructor.  So you can use whatever arguments are supported by Perl::Critic.

       The "criticism" pragma will also obey whatever configurations you have set in your <u>.perlcriticrc</u> file.
       In particular, setting the "criticism-fatal" option to a true value will cause your program to
       immediately "die" if any Perl::Critic violations are found.  Otherwise, violations are merely advisory.
       This option can be set in the global section at the top of your <u>.perlcriticrc</u> file, like this:

         # Top of your .perlcriticrc file...
         criticism-fatal = 1

         # per-policy configurations follow...

       You can also pass "('-criticism-fatal' =&gt; 1)" as import arguments, just like any other Perl::Critic
       argument.  See "CONFIGURATION" in Perl::Critic for details on the other configuration options.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       Usually, the "criticism" pragma fails silently if it cannot load Perl::Critic.  So by <b>not</b> installing
       Perl::Critic in your production environment, you can leave the "criticism" pragma in your production
       source code and it will still compile, but it won't be analyzed by Perl::Critic each time it runs.

       However, if you set the "DEBUG" environment variable to a true value or run your program under the Perl
       debugger, you will get a warning when "criticism" fails to load Perl::Critic.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       The "criticism" pragma applies to the entire file, so it is not affected by scope or package boundaries
       and "use"-ing it multiple times will just cause it to repeatedly process the same file.  There isn't a
       reciprocal "no criticism" pragma.  However, Perl::Critic does support a pseudo-pragma that directs it to
       overlook certain lines or blocks of code.  See "BENDING THE RULES" in Perl::Critic for more details.
