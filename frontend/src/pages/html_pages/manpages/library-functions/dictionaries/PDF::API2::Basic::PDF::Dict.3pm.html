</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       PDF::API2::Basic::PDF::Dict - Low-level dictionary and stream objects

</pre><h4><b>INSTANCE</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       There are various special instance variables which are used to look after, particularly, streams. Each
       begins with a space:

       stream
           Holds the stream contents for output

       streamfile
           Holds  the  stream  contents in an external file rather than in memory. This is not the same as a PDF
           file stream. The data is stored in its unfiltered form.

       streamloc
           If both ' stream' and ' streamfile' are empty, this indicates where in  the  source  PDF  the  stream
           starts.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>$type</b> <b>=</b> <b>$d-&gt;type($type)</b>
       Get/Set  the  standard  Type  key.   It  can  be passed, and will return, a text value rather than a Name
       object.

   <b>@filters</b> <b>=</b> <b>$d-&gt;filter(@filters)</b>
       Get/Set one or more filters being used by the optional stream attached to the dictionary.

   <b>$d-&gt;outobjdeep($fh)</b>
       Outputs the contents of the dictionary to a PDF file. This is a recursive call.

       It also outputs a stream if the dictionary has a stream element. If this occurs  then  this  method  will
       calculate the length of the stream and insert it into the stream's dictionary.

   <b>$d-&gt;read_stream($force_memory)</b>
       Reads  in  a  stream  from  a  PDF file. If the stream is greater than "PDF::Dict::mincache" (defaults to
       32768) bytes to be stored, then the default action is to create a file for it somewhere and to  use  that
       file  as  a  data  cache.  If  $force_memory is set, this caching will not occur and the data will all be
       stored in the $self-&gt;{' stream'} variable.

   <b>$d-&gt;val</b>
       Returns the dictionary, which is itself.
