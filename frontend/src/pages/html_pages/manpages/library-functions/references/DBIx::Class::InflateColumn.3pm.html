</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       DBIx::Class::InflateColumn - Automatically create references from column data

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         # In your table classes
         __PACKAGE__-&gt;inflate_column('column_name', {
           inflate =&gt; sub {
             my ($raw_value_from_db, $result_object) = @_;
             ...
           },
           deflate =&gt; sub {
             my ($inflated_value_from_user, $result_object) = @_;
             ...
           },
         });

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This component translates column data into references, i.e. "inflating" the column data. It also
       "deflates" references into an appropriate format for the database.

       It can be used, for example, to automatically convert to and from DateTime objects for your date and time
       fields. There's a convenience component to actually do that though, try
       DBIx::Class::InflateColumn::DateTime.

       It will handle all types of references except scalar references. It will not handle scalar values, these
       are ignored and thus passed through to SQL::Abstract::Classic. This is to allow setting raw values to
       "just work". Scalar references are passed through to the database to deal with, to allow such settings as
       " \'year + 1'" and " \'DEFAULT' " to work.

       If you want to filter plain scalar values and replace them with something else, see
       DBIx::Class::FilterColumn.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>inflate_column</b>
       Instruct DBIx::Class to inflate the given column.

       In addition to the column name, you must provide "inflate" and "deflate" methods. The "inflate" method is
       called when you access the field, while the "deflate" method is called when the field needs to used by
       the database.

       For example, if you have a table "events" with a timestamp field named "insert_time", you could inflate
       the column in the corresponding table class using something like:

           __PACKAGE__-&gt;inflate_column('insert_time', {
               inflate =&gt; sub {
                 my ($insert_time_raw_value, $event_result_object) = @_;
                 DateTime-&gt;from_epoch( epoch =&gt; $insert_time_raw_value );
               },
               deflate =&gt; sub {
                 my ($insert_time_dt_object, $event_result_object) = @_;
                 $insert_time_dt_object-&gt;epoch;
               },
           });

       The coderefs you set for inflate and deflate are called with two parameters, the first is the value of
       the column to be inflated/deflated, the second is the result object itself.

       In this example, calls to an event's "insert_time" accessor return a DateTime object. This DateTime
       object is later "deflated" back to the integer epoch representation when used in the database layer.  For
       a much more thorough handling of the above example, please see DBIx::Class::DateTime::Epoch

   <b>get_inflated_column</b>
         my $val = $obj-&gt;get_inflated_column($col);

       Fetch a column value in its inflated state.  This is directly analogous to "get_column" in
       DBIx::Class::Row in that it only fetches a column already retrieved from the database, and then inflates
       it.  Throws an exception if the column requested is not an inflated column.

   <b>set_inflated_column</b>
         my $copy = $obj-&gt;set_inflated_column($col =&gt; $val);

       Sets a column value from an inflated value.  This is directly analogous to "set_column" in
       DBIx::Class::Row.

   <b>store_inflated_column</b>
         my $copy = $obj-&gt;store_inflated_column($col =&gt; $val);

       Sets a column value from an inflated value without marking the column as dirty. This is directly
       analogous to "store_column" in DBIx::Class::Row.
