</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  document specifies both names and syntax of all the commands which together are the doctools markup
       language, version 1.  As this document is  intended  to  be  a  reference  the  commands  are  listed  in
       alphabetical  order,  and  the  descriptions  are relatively short.  A beginner should read the much more
       informally written <u>doctools</u> <u>language</u> <u>introduction</u> first.

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>arg</b> <u>text</u>
              Text markup. The argument text is marked up as the <u>argument</u>  of  a  command.  Main  uses  are  the
              highlighting of command arguments in free-form text, and for the argument parameters of the markup
              commands <b>call</b> and <b>usage</b>.

       <b>arg_def</b> <u>type</u> <u>name</u> ?<u>mode</u>?
              Text  structure.  List  element.  Argument  list.  Automatically closes the previous list element.
              Specifies the data-<u>type</u> of the described argument of a command, its <u>name</u>  and  its  i/o-<u>mode</u>.  The
              latter is optional.

       <b>bullet</b> <u>Deprecated</u>.  Text  structure.  List  element. Itemized list. See <b>item</b> for the canonical command to
              open a list item in an itemized list.

       <b>call</b> <u>args</u>
              Text structure. List element. Definition list. Automatically closes  the  previous  list  element.
              Defines  the  term  as a command and its arguments.  The first argument is the name of the command
              described by the following free-form text, and all arguments coming after that are descriptions of
              the command's arguments.  It is expected that the arguments are marked up with <b>arg</b>, <b>method</b>, <b>option</b>
              etc., as is appropriate, and that the command itself is marked up with <b>cmd</b>.  It is  expected  that
              the  formatted  term  is  not  only  printed  in  place,  but also in the table of contents of the
              document, or synopsis, depending on the output format.

       <b>category</b> <u>text</u>
              Document information. Anywhere. This command registers its plain text arguments  as  the  category
              this document belongs to. If this command is used multiple times the last value specified is used.

       <b>class</b> <u>text</u>
              Text  markup.  The  argument  is  marked up as the name of a <u>class</u>. The text may have other markup
              already applied to it. Main use is the highlighting of class names in free-form text.

       <b>cmd</b> <u>text</u>
              Text markup. The argument text is marked up as the name of a <u>Tcl</u> <u>command</u>. The text may have  other
              markup  already  applied  to it. Main uses are the highlighting of commands in free-form text, and
              for the command parameters of the markup commands <b>call</b> and <b>usage</b>.

       <b>cmd_def</b> <u>command</u>
              Text structure. List element. Command list. Automatically closes the previous  list  element.  The
              argument specifies the name of the <u>Tcl</u> <u>command</u> to be described by the list element. Expected to be
              marked up in the output as if it had been formatted with <b>cmd</b>.

       <b>comment</b> <u>plaintext</u>
              Text  markup.  The  argument text is marked up as a comment standing outside of the actual text of
              the document. Main use is in free-form text.

       <b>const</b> <u>text</u>
              Text markup. The argument is marked up as a <u>constant</u> value. The text may have other markup already

       <b>copyright</b> <u>text</u>
              Document information. Anywhere. The command registers the  plain  text  argument  as  a  copyright
              assignment for the manpage. When invoked more than once the assignments are accumulated.

       <b>def</b> <u>text</u>
              Text structure. List element. Definition list. Automatically closes the previous list element. The
              argument text is the term defined by the new list element. Text markup can be applied to it.

       <b>description</b>
              Document structure. This command separates the header from the document body.  Implicitly starts a
              section named "DESCRIPTION" (See command <b>section</b>).

       <b>enum</b>   Text structure. List element. Enumerated list. Automatically closes the previous list element.

       <b>emph</b> <u>text</u>
              Text markup. The argument text is marked up as emphasized. Main use is for general highlighting of
              pieces of free-form text without attaching special meaning to the pieces.

       <b>example</b> <u>text</u>
              Text  structure,  Text  markup.  This command marks its argument up as an <u>example</u>. Main use is the
              simple embedding of examples in free-form text. It should be used if the  example  does  <u>not</u>  need
              special markup of its own. Otherwise use a sequence of <b>example_begin</b> ... <b>example_end</b>.

       <b>example_begin</b>
              Text  structure.  This  commands starts an example. All text until the next <b>example_end</b> belongs to
              the example. Line breaks, spaces, and tabs have to be  preserved  literally.  Examples  cannot  be
              nested.

       <b>example_end</b>
              Text structure. This command closes the example started by the last <b>example_begin</b>.

       <b>file</b> <u>text</u>
              Text  markup.  The  argument is marked up as a <u>file</u> or <u>directory</u>, i.e. in general a <u>path</u>. The text
              may have other markup already applied to it. Main use is the highlighting of  paths  in  free-form
              text.

       <b>fun</b> <u>text</u>
              Text  markup.  The argument is marked up as the name of a <u>function</u>. The text may have other markup
              already applied to it. Main use is the highlighting of function names in free-form text.

       <b>image</b> <u>name</u> ?<u>label</u>?
              Text markup. The argument is the symbolic name of an <u>image</u> and replaced with the image itself,  if
              a  suitable  variant  is  found by the backend. The second argument, should it be present, will be
              interpreted the human-readable description of the image, and put into the  output  in  a  suitable
              position,  if such is supported by the format. The HTML format, for example, can place it into the
              <u>alt</u> attribute of image references.

       <b>include</b> <u>filename</u>
              Templating. The contents of the named file are interpreted as text written in the doctools  markup
              and  processed  in  the  place  of  the  include  command.  The markup in the file has to be self-
              contained. It is not possible for a markup command to cross the file boundaries.

       <b>item</b>   Text structure. List element. Itemized list. Automatically closes the previous list element.

       <b>keywords</b> <u>args</u>
              Document information. Anywhere. This command registers all its plain text  arguments  as  keywords
              applying  to  this  document.  Each argument is a single keyword. If this command is used multiple
              times all the arguments accumulate.

       <b>lb</b>     Text. The command is replaced with a left bracket. Use  in  free-form  text.   Required  to  avoid
              interpretation of a left bracket as the start of a markup command.

       <b>list_begin</b> <u>what</u>
              Text  structure.  This  command  starts  a list. The exact nature of the list is determined by the
              argument <u>what</u> of the command. This further determines which commands are have to be used to  start
              the  list  elements.  Lists  can  be  nested, i.e. it is allowed to start a new list within a list
              element.

              The allowed types (and their associated item commands) are:

              <b>arguments</b>
                     <b>arg_def</b>.

              <b>commands</b>
                     <b>cmd_def</b>.

              <b>definitions</b>
                     <b>def</b> and <b>call</b>.

              <b>enumerated</b>
                     <b>enum</b>

              <b>itemized</b>
                     <b>item</b>

              <b>options</b>
                     <b>opt_def</b>

              <b>tkoptions</b>
                     <b>tkoption_def</b>

       Additionally the following names are recognized as shortcuts for some of the regular types:

              <b>args</b>   Short for <b>arguments</b>.

              <b>cmds</b>   Short for <b>commands</b>.

              <b>enum</b>   Short for <b>enumerated</b>.

              <b>item</b>   Short for <b>itemized</b>.

              <b>opts</b>   Short for <b>options</b>.

       At last the following names are still recognized for backward compatibility, but are otherwise considered
       to be <u>deprecated</u>.

              <b>arg</b>    <u>Deprecated</u>. See <b>arguments</b>.

              Text  markup. The argument text is marked up as the name of an <u>object</u> <u>method</u>, i.e. subcommand of a
              Tcl command. The text may have other markup already applied to it. Main uses are the  highlighting
              of  method names in free-form text, and for the command parameters of the markup commands <b>call</b> and

       <b>sectref-external</b> <u>text</u>
              Text markup. Like <b>sectref</b>, except that the section is assumed to be in a  different  document  and
              therefore  doesn't  need to be identified, nor are any checks for existence made. Only the text to
              format is needed.

       <b>see_also</b> <u>args</u>
              Document information. Anywhere. The command defines direct cross-references  to  other  documents.
              Each  argument  is a plain text label identifying the referenced document. If this command is used

              already applied to it. Main use is the highlighting of important terms and concepts  in  free-form
              text.

       <b>titledesc</b> <u>desc</u>
              Document  information.  Header.  Optional.  Registers  the plain text argument as the title of the
              manpage. Defaults to the value registered by <b>moddesc</b>.

       <b>tkoption_def</b> <u>name</u> <u>dbname</u> <u>dbclass</u>
              Text structure. List element. Widget option list. Automatically closes the previous list  element.

              (<u>dbname</u>), and its class (<u>dbclass</u>), i.e. its type. It is expected that the name is marked up  using
              <b>option</b>.

       <b>type</b> <u>text</u>

              already applied to it. Main use is the highlighting of data types in free-form text.

       <b>uri</b> <u>text</u> ?<u>text</u>?
              Text markup. The argument is marked up as an <u>uri</u> (i.e. a <u>uniform</u> <u>resource</u> <u>identifier</u>. The text may
              have other markup already applied to it. Main use is the highlighting of uris in  free-form  text.
              The  second  argument, should it be present, will be interpreted the human-readable description of
              the uri. In other words, as its label. Without an explicit label the uri will be its own label.

       <b>usage</b> <u>args</u>
              Text markup. See <b>call</b> for the full description, this command is syntactically identical, as it  is
              in  its  expectations  for  the  markup  of  its arguments.  In contrast to <b>call</b> it is however not
              allowed to generate output where this command occurs in the text.  The  command  is  <u>silent</u>.   The
              formatted  text  may  only  appear  in  a  different section of the output, for example a table of
              contents, or synopsis, depending on the output format.

       <b>var</b> <u>text</u>
              Text markup. The argument is marked up as the name of a <u>variable</u>. The text may have  other  markup
