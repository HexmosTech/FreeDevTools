</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  document  is  intended  for  <u>plugin</u> <u>writers</u>, i.e. developers wishing to write a doctools <u>formatting</u>
       <u>engine</u> for some output format X.

       It specifies the interaction between the <b>doctools</b>  package  and  its  plugins,  i.e.  the  interface  any
       doctools formatting engine has to comply with.

       This document deals with version 1 of the interface.

       A  reader  who  is  on the other hand more interested in the markup language itself should start with the
       <u>doctools</u> <u>language</u> <u>introduction</u> and proceed from there to the formal  specifications,  i.e.  the  <u>doctools</u>
       <u>language</u> <u>syntax</u> and the <u>doctools</u> <u>language</u> <u>command</u> <u>reference</u>.

</pre><h4><b>OVERVIEW</b></h4><pre>
       The API for a doctools formatting engine consists of two major sections.

       On  the  one side we have a set of commands through which the plugin is able to query the frontend. These
       commands are provided by the frontend and linked into the plugin interpreter. Please see section <b>FRONTEND</b>
       <b>COMMANDS</b> for their detailed specification.

       And on the other side the plugin has to provide its own set of commands which will then be called by  the
       frontend in a specific sequence while processing input. They, again, fall into two categories, management
       and formatting.  Please see section <b>PLUGIN</b> <b>COMMANDS</b> and its subsections for their detailed specification.

</pre><h4><b>FRONTEND</b> <b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       This  section  specifies  the set of commands through which a plugin, also known as a doctools formatting
       engine, is able to query the frontend. These commands are provided by the frontend and  linked  into  the
       plugin interpreter.

       I.e.  a  doctools formatting engine can assume that all of the following commands are present when any of
       its own commands (as specified in section <b>PLUGIN</b> <b>COMMANDS</b>) are executed.

       Beyond that it can also assume that it has full access to its own safe interpreter and thus is  not  able
       to  damage  the  other  parts  of the processor, nor can it damage the filesystem.  It is however able to
       either kill or hang the whole process, by exiting, or running an infinite loop.

       Coming back to the imported commands, all the commands with prefix <u>dt</u><b>_</b> provide limited access to specific
       parts of the frontend, whereas the  commands  with  prefix  <u>ex</u><b>_</b>  provide  access  to  the  state  of  the
       <b>textutil::expander</b>  object  which  does the main parsing of the input within the frontend. These commands
       should not be except under very special circumstances.

       <b>dt_copyright</b>
              Query command. It returns a string containing the copyright information the doctools processor was
              configured with. The relevant option is <b>-copyright</b>).

       <b>dt_file</b>
              Query command. It returns the full path of the file containing the input  currently  processed  by
              the engine. This may be an included file.

       <b>dt_mainfile</b>
              Query  command.  It  returns  the  full  path  of the toplevel file containing the input currently
              processed by the engine.

       <b>dt_fileid</b>
              Query command. It returns the name of the file containing the input  currently  processed  by  the
              engine, without path, nor extension.

       <b>dt_fmap</b> <u>symfname</u>
              Query  command.  It  returns  the  actual  pathname  to use in the output in place of the symbolic
              filename <u>symfname</u>. It will return the unchanged input if no mapping was established for <u>symfname</u>.

              The required mappings are established with the method <b>map</b> of a frontend, as explained  in  section
              <b>OBJECT</b> <b>METHODS</b> of the documentation for the package <b>doctools</b>.

       <b>dt_format</b>
              Query command. It returns the name of the format associated with the doctools formatting engine.

       <b>dt_imgdata</b> <u>key</u> <u>extensions</u>
              Query  command.  Access  to the image map. Looks for an image recorded under the <u>key</u> and having on
              the specified <u>extension</u>. If a matching image is found its data is returned as the  result  of  the
              command. Otherwise an empty string is returned.

       <b>dt_imgdst</b> <u>key</u> <u>extensions</u>
              Query  command.  Access  to the image map. Looks for an image recorded under the <u>key</u> and having on
              the specified <u>extension</u>. If a matching image is found  its  destination  path  in  the  output  is
              returned as the result of the command. Otherwise an empty string is returned.

       <b>dt_imgsrc</b> <u>key</u> <u>extensions</u>
              Query  command.  Access  to the image map. Looks for an image recorded under the <u>key</u> and having on
              the specified <u>extension</u>. If a matching image is found its origin path is returned as the result of
              the command. Otherwise an empty string is returned.

       <b>dt_lnesting</b>
              Query command. It returns the number of lists currently open.

       <b>dt_module</b>
              Query command. It returns the name of the module the input currently processed belongs to.

       <b>dt_read</b> <u>file</u>
              Controlled filesystem access. Returns contents of <u>file</u> for whatever use  desired  by  the  plugin.
              Only  files which are either in the same directory as the file containing the engine, or below it,
              can be loaded. Trying to load a file outside of this directory causes an error.

       <b>dt_source</b> <u>file</u>
              Controlled filesystem  access.  This  command  allows  the  doctools  formatting  engine  to  load
              additional  Tcl  code  it may need.  Only files which are either in the same directory as the file
              containing the engine, or below it, can be loaded. Trying to load a file outside of this directory
              causes an error.

       <b>dt_user</b>
              Query command. It returns the name of the current  user  as  known  to  the  tcl  interpreter  the
              frontend controlling the formatting engine resides in.

       <b>ex_cappend</b> <u>text</u>
              Appends  a  string  to  the  output in the current context.  This command should rarely be used by
              macros or application code.

       <b>ex_cget</b> <u>varname</u>
              Retrieves the value of variable <u>varname</u>, defined in the current context.

       <b>ex_cis</b> <u>cname</u>
              Determines whether or not the name of the current context is <u>cname</u>.

       <b>ex_cname</b>
              Returns the name of the current context.

       <b>ex_cpop</b> <u>cname</u>
              Pops a context from the context stack, returning all accumulated  output  in  that  context.   The
              context must be named <u>cname</u>, or an error results.

       <b>ex_cpush</b> <u>cname</u>
              Pushes  a  context  named <u>cname</u> onto the context stack.  The context must be popped by <b>cpop</b> before
              expansion ends or an error results.

       <b>ex_cset</b> <u>varname</u> <u>value</u>
              Sets variable <u>varname</u> to <u>value</u> in the current context.

       <b>ex_lb</b> ?<u>newbracket</u>?
              Returns the current value of the left macro expansion bracket; this is for  use  as  or  within  a
              macro,  when  the bracket needs to be included in the output text.  If <u>newbracket</u> is specified, it
              becomes the new bracket, and is returned.

       <b>ex_rb</b> ?<u>newbracket</u>?
              Returns the current value of the right macro expansion bracket; this is for use  as  or  within  a
              macro,  when  the bracket needs to be included in the output text.  If <u>newbracket</u> is specified, it
              becomes the new bracket, and is returned.

</pre><h4><b>PLUGIN</b> <b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       The plugin has to provide its own set of commands which will then be called by the frontend in a specific
       sequence while processing input. They fall into two categories, management and formatting. Their expected
       names, signatures, and responsibilities are specified in the following two subsections.

   <b>MANAGEMENT</b> <b>COMMANDS</b>
       The management commands a plugin has to provide are used by the frontend to

       [1]    initialize and shutdown the plugin

       [2]    determine the number of passes it has to make over the input

       [3]    initialize and shutdown each pass

       [4]    query and initialize engine parameters

       After the plugin has been loaded and the frontend commands are established the commands will be called in
       the following sequence:

                  fmt_numpasses -&gt; n
                  fmt_listvariables -&gt; vars

                  fmt_varset var1 value1
                  fmt_varset var2 value2
                  ...
                  fmt_varset varK valueK
                  fmt_initialize
                  fmt_setup 1
                  ...
                  fmt_setup 2
                  ...
                  ...
                  fmt_setup n
                  ...
                  fmt_postprocess
                  fmt_shutdown
                  ...

       I.e. first the number of passes and the set of available engine parameters is  established,  followed  by
       calls setting the parameters. That second part is optional.

       After  that  the  plugin  is  initialized,  the specified number of passes executed, the final result run
       through a global post processing step and at last the plugin is shutdown again. This can be  followed  by
       more conversions, restarting the sequence at <b>fmt_varset</b>.

       In each of the passes, i.e. after the calls of <b>fmt_setup</b> the frontend will process the input and call the
       formatting  commands  as  markup  is  encountered. This means that the sequence of formatting commands is
       determined by the grammar of the doctools markup language, as specified in the <u>doctools</u>  <u>language</u>  <u>syntax</u>
       specification.

       A different way of looking at the sequence is:

       •      First some basic parameters are determined.

       •      Then  everything starting at the first <b>fmt_varset</b> to <b>fmt_shutdown</b> forms a <u>run</u>, the formatting of a
              single input. Each run can be followed by more.

       •      Embedded within each run we have one or more <u>passes</u>, each starting with <b>fmt_setup</b> and going  until
              either the next <b>fmt_setup</b> or <b>fmt_postprocess</b> is reached.

              If  more  than  one pass is required to perform the formatting only the output of the last pass is
              relevant. The output of all the previous, preparatory passes is ignored.

       The commands, their names, signatures, and responsibilities are, in detail:

       <b>fmt_initialize</b>
              <u>Initialization/Shutdown</u>.  This command is called at the beginning of every conversion run, as  the
              first  command of that run. Note that a run is not a pass, but may consist of multiple passes.  It
              has to initialize the general state of the plugin, beyond the initialization done during the load.
              No return value is expected, and any returned value is ignored.

       <b>fmt_listvariables</b>
              <u>Initialization/Shutdown</u> and <u>Engine</u> <u>parameters</u>.  Second command is called after the plugin code has
              been loaded, i.e. immediately after <b>fmt_numpasses</b>.  It has to return a list containing  the  names
              of the parameters the frontend can set to configure the engine. This list can be empty.

       <b>fmt_numpasses</b>
              <u>Initialization/Shutdown</u>  and <u>Pass</u> <u>management</u>.  First command called after the plugin code has been
              loaded. No other command of the engine will be called before it.  It has to return the  number  of
              passes  this  engine requires to fully process the input document. This value has to be an integer
              number greater or equal to one.

       <b>fmt_postprocess</b> <u>text</u>
              <u>Initialization/Shutdown</u>.  This command is called immediately after the last pass  in  a  run.  Its
              argument  is  the  result  of  the  conversion generated by that pass. It is provided to allow the
              engine to perform any global modifications of the generated document.  If  no  post-processing  is
              required for a specific format the command has to just return the argument.

              Expected to return a value, the final result of formatting the input.

       <b>fmt_setup</b> <u>n</u>
              <u>Initialization/Shutdown</u> and <u>Pass</u> <u>management</u>.  This command is called at the beginning of each pass
              over  the  input  in  a  run.  Its  argument is the number of the pass which has begun. Passes are
              counted from <b>1</b> upward.  The command has to set up the  internal  state  of  the  plugin  for  this
              particular pass. No return value is expected, and any returned value is ignored.

       <b>fmt_shutdown</b>
              <u>Initialization/Shutdown</u>.   This  command  is  called at the end of every conversion run. It is the
              last command called in a run. It has to clean up of all the  run-specific  state  in  the  plugin.
              After  the call the engine has to be in a state which allows the initiation of another run without
              fear that information from the last run is leaked into this new run.  No return value is expected,
              and any returned value is ignored.

       <b>fmt_varset</b> <u>varname</u> <u>text</u>
              <u>Engine</u> <u>parameters</u>.  This command is called by the  frontend  to  set  an  engine  parameter  to  a
              particular value.  The parameter to change is specified by <u>varname</u>, the value to set in <u>text</u>.

              The  command  has  to  throw  an  error  if an unknown <u>varname</u> is used. Only the names returned by
              <b>fmt_listvariables</b> have to be considered as known.

              The values of all engine parameters have to persist between passes and runs.

   <b>FORMATTING</b> <b>COMMANDS</b>
       The formatting commands have to implement the formatting for  the  output  format,  for  all  the  markup
       commands of the doctools markup language, except <b>lb</b>, <b>rb</b>, <b>vset</b>, <b>include</b>, and <b>comment</b>. These exceptions are
       processed  by  the  frontend  and are never seen by the plugin. In return a command for the formatting of
       plain text has to be provided, something which has no markup in the input at all.

       This means, that each of the 49 markup commands specified in the <u>doctools</u> <u>language</u> <u>command</u> <u>reference</u>  and
       outside  of  the set of exceptions listed above has an equivalent formatting command which takes the same
       arguments as the markup command and whose name is the name of markup command with the prefix  <u>fmt</u><b>_</b>  added
       to it.

       All  commands  are  expected to format their input in some way per the semantics specified in the command
       reference and to return whatever part of this that they deem necessary as their  result,  which  will  be
       added to the output.

       To  avoid essentially duplicating the command reference we do not list any of the command here and simply
       refer the reader to the <u>doctools</u> <u>language</u> <u>command</u> <u>reference</u> for their signature and description. The sole
       exception is the plain text formatter, which has no equivalent markup command.

       The calling sequence of formatting commands  is  not  as  rigid  as  for  the  management  commands,  but
       determined  by  the grammar of the doctools markup language, as specified in the <u>doctools</u> <u>language</u> <u>syntax</u>
       specification.

       <b>fmt_plain_text</b> <u>text</u>
              <u>No</u> <u>associated</u> <u>markup</u> <u>command</u>.

              Called by the frontend for any plain text encountered in the input. It has to perform any and  all
              special processing required for plain text.

              The  formatted  text  is  expected  as  the  result of the command, and added to the output. If no
              special processing is required it has to simply return its argument without change.
