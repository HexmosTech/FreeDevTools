</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       PERIM3 - Draws the projection of a rectangular perimeter in a plane parallel to one of the three
       coordinate planes, with inward-pointing tick marks at specified intervals.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       CALL PERIM3 (MAJOR1,MINOR1,MAJOR2,MINOR2,IAXIS,VALUE)

</pre><h4><b>C-BINDING</b> <b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;ncarg/ncargC.h&gt;

       void c_perim3 (int major1, int minor1, int major2, int minor2,
       int iaxis, float value)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       MAJOR1      (an  input expression of type INTEGER) specifies the number of major divisions of those sides
                   of the perimeter parallel to direction 1.  (Directions 1 and 2 are defined by  the  value  of
                   IAXIS.)  Major divisions are indicated by tick marks.

       MINOR1      (an  input  expression  of  type  INTEGER)  specifies the number of minor divisions per major
                   division along those sides of the perimeter parallel to direction 1.  (Directions 1 and 2 are
                   defined by the value of IAXIS.)  Minor  divisions  are  indicated  by  tick  marks  that,  by
                   default, are smaller than the tick marks indicating major divisions.

       MAJOR2      (an  input expression of type INTEGER) specifies the number of major divisions of those sides
                   of the perimeter parallel to direction 2.  (Directions 1 and 2 are defined by  the  value  of
                   IAXIS.)  Major divisions are indicated by tick marks.

       MINOR2      (an  input  expression  of  type  INTEGER)  specifies the number of minor divisions per major
                   division along those sides of the perimeter parallel to direction 2.  (Directions 1 and 2 are
                   defined by the value of IAXIS.)  Minor  divisions  are  indicated  by  tick  marks  that,  by
                   default, are smaller than the tick marks indicating major divisions.

       IAXIS       (an  input  expression of type INTEGER) specifies which of the three axes the perimeter is to
                   be perpendicular to and identifies directions 1 and 2:

                   1  The perimeter is to be perpendicular to the U axis.  Direction 1 is parallel to the V axis
                      and direction 2 is parallel to the W axis.

                   2  The perimeter is to be perpendicular to the V axis.  Direction 1 is parallel to the U axis
                      and direction 2 is parallel to the W axis.

                   3  The perimeter is to be perpendicular to the W axis.  Direction 1 is parallel to the U axis
                      and direction 2 is parallel to the V axis.

       VALUE       (an input expression of type REAL)  is the value at which the plane of the  perimeter  is  to
                   intersect the axis specified by IAXIS.  If IAXIS is a 1, VALUE is a U coordinate; if IAXIS is
                   a 2, VALUE is a V coordinate; and, if IAXIS is a 3, VALUE is a W coordinate.

       Each call to PERIM3 draws a perimeter: a rectangle representing the intersection of a plane perpendicular
       to  one  of the three axes with the box specified by the arguments UMIN, UMAX, VMIN, VMAX, WMIN, and WMAX
       in the last call to SET3.  The perimeter can be placed at any desired position along the axis to which it
       is perpendicular; it can have inward-pointing major and minor tick  marks  along  its  edges,  spaced  as
       specified  by  the user.  Tick marks along two parallel edges of the perimeter are controlled by one pair
       of arguments, and tick marks along the other two parallel edges are  controlled  by  the  other  pair  of
       arguments.

       Each  of  the  arguments MAJOR1 and MAJOR2 refers to the number of major divisions (spaces between ticks)
       rather than to the number of major ticks; counting those at the ends, there will be one more  major  tick
       than there are major divisions.

       Each  of  the  arguments MINOR1 and MINOR2 refers to the number of minor divisions (spaces between ticks)
       rather than to the number of minor ticks; in a given major interval, there will be one fewer  minor  tick
       than there are minor divisions.

       The  rectangle  itself  is drawn in the current polyline color, as determined by the last call to the GKS
       routine GSPLCI; by default, color index 1 is used.  Major ticks and minor ticks are drawn in  the  colors
       implied by the values of the variables ITHRMJ and ITHRMN in the Threed COMMON block

             COMMON /THRINT/ ITHRMJ,ITHRMN,ITHRTX

       The default value of both ITHRMJ and ITHRMN is 1; user code may change these values.

       All  lines  are  drawn  using the current GKS line width scale factor, as set by the last call to the GKS
       routine GSLWSC.
