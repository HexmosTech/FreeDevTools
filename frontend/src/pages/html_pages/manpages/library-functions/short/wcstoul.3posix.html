</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       wcstoul, wcstoull — convert a wide-character string to an unsigned long

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/wchar.h">wchar.h</a>&gt;

       unsigned long wcstoul(const wchar_t *restrict <u>nptr</u>,
           wchar_t **restrict <u>endptr</u>, int <u>base</u>);
       unsigned long long wcstoull(const wchar_t *restrict <u>nptr</u>,
           wchar_t **restrict <u>endptr</u>, int <u>base</u>);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  functionality  described  on  this  reference  page is aligned with the ISO C standard. Any conflict
       between the requirements described  here  and  the  ISO C  standard  is  unintentional.  This  volume  of
       POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO C standard.

       The  <u>wcstoul</u>()  and  <u>wcstoull</u>()  functions shall convert the initial portion of the wide-character string
       pointed to by <u>nptr</u> to <b>unsigned</b> <b>long</b> and <b>unsigned</b> <b>long</b>  <b>long</b>  representation,  respectively.  First,  they
       shall decompose the input wide-character string into three parts:

        1. An initial, possibly empty, sequence of white-space wide-character codes (as specified by <u>iswspace</u>())

        2. A  subject  sequence  interpreted  as an integer represented in some radix determined by the value of
           <u>base</u>

        3. A final wide-character string of  one  or  more  unrecognized  wide-character  codes,  including  the
           terminating null wide-character code of the input wide-character string

       Then they shall attempt to convert the subject sequence to an unsigned integer, and return the result.

       If <u>base</u> is 0, the expected form of the subject sequence is that of a decimal constant, octal constant, or
       hexadecimal constant, any of which may be preceded by a <b>'+'</b> or <b>'-'</b> sign. A decimal constant begins with a
       non-zero  digit,  and  consists of a sequence of decimal digits. An octal constant consists of the prefix
       <b>'0'</b> optionally followed by a sequence of the digits <b>'0'</b> to <b>'7'</b> only. A hexadecimal constant  consists  of
       the prefix 0x or 0X followed by a sequence of the decimal digits and letters <b>'a'</b> (or <b>'A'</b>) to <b>'f'</b> (or <b>'F'</b>)
       with values 10 to 15 respectively.

       If  the  value  of  <u>base</u>  is between 2 and 36, the expected form of the subject sequence is a sequence of
       letters and digits representing an integer with the radix specified by <u>base</u>, optionally preceded by a <b>'+'</b>
       or <b>'-'</b> sign, but not including an integer suffix. The letters from <b>'a'</b> (or <b>'A'</b>) to <b>'z'</b> (or <b>'Z'</b>) inclusive
       are ascribed the values 10 to 35; only letters whose ascribed values are less than that of <u>base</u> shall  be
       permitted.  If  the  value  of  <u>base</u>  is 16, the wide-character codes 0x or 0X may optionally precede the
       sequence of letters and digits, following the sign if present.

       The subject sequence is defined as the longest initial subsequence of the  input  wide-character  string,
       starting  with  the  first  wide-character  code that is not white space and is of the expected form. The
       subject sequence contains no wide-character codes if the input wide-character string is empty or consists
       entirely of white-space wide-character codes, or if the first wide-character code that is not white space
       is other than a sign or a permissible letter or digit.

       If the subject sequence has the expected form and  <u>base</u>  is  0,  the  sequence  of  wide-character  codes
       starting  with  the  first digit shall be interpreted as an integer constant. If the subject sequence has
       the expected form and the value of <u>base</u> is between 2 and 36, it shall be used as the base for conversion,
       ascribing to each letter its value as given above. If the subject sequence begins with a  &lt;hyphen-minus&gt;,
       the  value  resulting  from the conversion shall be negated. A pointer to the final wide-character string
       shall be stored in the object pointed to by <u>endptr</u>, provided that <u>endptr</u> is not a null pointer.

       In other than the C or POSIX locale, additional locale-specific subject sequence forms may be accepted.

       If the subject sequence is empty or does not have the expected form, no conversion  shall  be  performed;
       the  value of <u>nptr</u> shall be stored in the object pointed to by <u>endptr</u>, provided that <u>endptr</u> is not a null
       pointer.

       These functions shall not change the setting of <u>errno</u> if successful.

       Since 0, {ULONG_MAX}, and {ULLONG_MAX} are returned on error and 0 is also a valid return on success,  an
       application  wishing  to  check  for  error  situations  should  set  <u>errno</u>  to 0, then call <u>wcstoul</u>() or
       <u>wcstoull</u>(), then check <u>errno</u>.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       Upon successful completion, the <u>wcstoul</u>() and <u>wcstoull</u>() functions shall return the converted  value,  if
       any. If no conversion could be performed, 0 shall be returned and <u>errno</u> may be set to indicate the error.
       If  the  correct  value  is  outside  the  range  of  representable  values,  {ULONG_MAX} or {ULLONG_MAX}
       respectively shall be returned and <u>errno</u> set to <b>[ERANGE]</b>.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       These functions shall fail if:

       <b>EINVAL</b> The value of <u>base</u> is not supported.

       <b>ERANGE</b> The value to be returned is not representable.

       These functions may fail if:

       <b>EINVAL</b> No conversion could be performed.
