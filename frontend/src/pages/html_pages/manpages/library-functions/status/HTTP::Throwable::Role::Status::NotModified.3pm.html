</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       HTTP::Throwable::Role::Status::NotModified - 304 Not Modified

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 0.028

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       If the client has performed a conditional GET request and access is allowed, but the document has not
       been modified, the server SHOULD respond with this status code. The 304 response MUST NOT contain a
       message-body, and thus is always terminated by the first empty line after the header fields.

       The response MUST include the following header fields:

       Date, unless its omission is required by section 14.18.1
           If  a  clockless  origin  server obeys these rules, and proxies and clients add their own Date to any
           response received without one (as already specified  by  [RFC  2068],  section  14.19),  caches  will
           operate correctly.

       ETag and/or Content-Location, if the header would have been sent in a 200 response to the same request
       Expires, Cache-Control, and/or Vary, if the field-value might differ from that sent in any previous
       response for the same variant

       If  the  conditional  GET  used  a  strong cache validator, the response SHOULD NOT include other entity-
       headers. Otherwise (i.e., the conditional GET used a weak validator), the response MUST NOT include other
       entity-headers; this prevents inconsistencies between cached entity-bodies and updated headers.

       If a 304 response indicates an entity not currently cached, then the cache MUST  disregard  the  response
       and repeat the request without the conditional.

       If  a  cache  uses  a  received  304 response to update a cache entry, the cache MUST update the entry to
       reflect any new field values given in the response.

</pre><h4><b>PERL</b> <b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This library should run on perls released even a long time ago.  It should work on any  version  of  perl
       released in the last five years.

       Although  it  may  work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made that the minimum required version
       will not be increased.  The version may be increased for any reason, and there is no promise that patches
       will be accepted to lower the minimum required perl.
