       treeview - Create and manipulate hierarchical table widgets
_________________________________________________________________

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>treeview</b> <u>pathName</u> ?<u>options</u>?

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>treeview</b>  widget  displays a tree of data.  It replaces both the <b>hiertable</b> and <b>hierbox</b> widgets.  The
       <b>treeview</b> is 100% syntax compatible with the <b>hiertable</b> widget.  The <b>hiertable</b> command is retained for sake
       of script-level compatibility.  This widget obsoletes the <b>hierbox</b> widget.  It  does  everything  the  old
       <b>hierbox</b> widget did, but also provides data sharing (via <u>tree</u> <u>data</u> <u>objects</u>) and the ability to tag nodes.

</pre><h4><b>INTRODUCTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>treeview</b> widget displays hierarchical data.  Data is represented as nodes in a general-ordered tree.
       Each node may have sub-nodes and these nodes can in turn has their own children.

       A node is displayed as a row entry in the widget.  Each entry has a text label and icon.  When a node has
       children, its entry is drawn with a small button to the left of the label.  Clicking the mouse over  this
       button  opens or closes the node.  When a node is <u>open</u>, its children are exposed.  When it is <u>closed</u>, the
       children and their descedants are hidden.  The button is normally a <b>+</b> or <b>-</b> symbol (ala Windows Explorer),
       but can be replaced with a pair of Tk images (open and closed images).

       If the node has data associated with it, they can be displayed in columns running  vertically  on  either
       side the tree.  You can control the color, font, etc of each entry.  Any entry label or data field can be
       edited in-place.

</pre><h4><b>TREE</b> <b>DATA</b> <b>OBJECT</b></h4><pre>
       The  tree  is  not stored inside the widget but in a tree data object (see the <b>tree</b> command for a further
       explanation).  Tree data objects can be shared among different clients, such as a <b>treeview</b> widget or  the
       <b>tree</b>  command.  You can walk the tree and manage its data with the <b>tree</b> command tree, while displaying it
       with the <b>treeview</b> widget.  Whenever the tree is updated, the <b>treeview</b> widget is automatically redrawn.

       By default, the <b>treeview</b> widget creates its own tree object.  The tree initially  contains  just  a  root
       node.   But  you can also display trees created by the <b>tree</b> command using the <b>-tree</b> configuration option.
       <b>Treeview</b> widgets can share the same tree object, possibly displaying different views of the same data.

       A tree object has both a Tcl and C API.  You can insert or delete nodes using  <b>treeview</b>  widget  or  <b>tree</b>
       command  operations,  but  also  from  C code.  For example, you can load the tree from your C code while
       still managing and displaying the tree from Tcl. The widget is automatically notified whenever  the  tree
       is modified via C or Tcl.

</pre><h4><b>SYNTAX</b></h4><pre>
       <b>treeview</b> <u>pathName</u> ?<u>option</u> <u>value</u>?...  The <b>treeview</b> command creates a new window <u>pathName</u> and makes it into
       a  <b>treeview</b>  widget.   At the time this command is invoked, there must not exist a window named <u>pathName</u>,
       but <u>pathName</u>'s parent must exist.  Additional options may be specified on the  command  line  or  in  the
       option  database  to  configure  aspects  of  the  widget such as its colors and font.  See the <b>configure</b>
       operation below for the exact details about what <u>option</u> and <u>value</u> pairs are valid.

       If successful, <b>treeview</b> returns the path name of the widget.  It also creates a new Tcl  command  by  the
       same  name.   You can use this command to invoke various operations that query or modify the widget.  The
       general form is: <u>pathName</u> <u>operation</u> ?<u>arg</u>?...  Both  <u>operation</u>  and  its  arguments  determine  the  exact
       behavior of the command.  The operations available are described in the <b>TREEVIEW</b> <b>OPERATIONS</b> section.

</pre><h4><b>IDS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>TAGS</b></h4><pre>
       Nodes can be inserted into a tree using the <b>treeview</b> widget

              blt::treeview .t
              set node [.t insert end root "one"]

       or <b>tree</b> command.

              set tree [blt::tree create]
              set node [$tree insert root "one"]

       In  both cases, a number identifying the node is returned (the value of <b>$node</b>).  This serial number or <u>id</u>
       uniquely identifies the node.  Please note that you can't infer a location or position of a node from its
       id.  The only exception is that the root node is always id <b>0</b>. Since nodes may have the same labels or  be
       moved  within  the  tree,  ids provide an convenient way to identify nodes.  If a tree is shared, the ids
       will be the same regardless if you are using by the  <b>treeview</b>  widget  or  the  <b>tree</b>  command.   Ids  are
       recycled when the node deleted.

       A node may also have any number of <u>tags</u> associated with it.  A tag is just a string of characters, and it
       may  take  any  form except that of an integer.  For example, "<b>x123</b>" is valid, but "<b>123</b>" isn't.  The same
       tag may be associated with many different nodes.  This is typically done to associate a group  of  nodes.
       Many  operations in the <b>treeview</b> widget take either node ids or tag names as arguments.  Using a tag says
       to apply the operation to all nodes with that tag.

       The tag <b>all</b> is implicitly associated with every node in the tree.  It may be used to invoke operations on
       all the nodes in the tree.

       Tags may be shared, just like trees, between clients.  For example, you can use the tags created  by  the
       <b>tree</b> command with <b>treeview</b> widgets.

</pre><h4><b>SPECIAL</b> <b>NODE</b> <b>IDS</b></h4><pre>
       There  are  also  several  special non-numeric ids.  Special ids differ from tags in that they are always
       translated to their numeric equivalent.  They also take precedence over tags.  For example, you can't use
       a tag name that is a special id.  These ids are specific to the <b>treeview</b> widget.

       <b>active</b>         The node where the mouse pointer is currently located.  When a node is active, it is drawn
                      using  its  active  icon  (see  the  <b>-activeicon</b>  option).   The  <b>active</b>  id  is   changed
                      automatically by moving the mouse pointer over another node or by using the <b>entry</b> <b>activate</b>
                      operation. Note that there can be only one active node at a time.

       <b>anchor</b>         The  node  representing  the fixed end of the current selection.  The anchor is set by the
                      <b>selection</b> <b>anchor</b> operation.

       <b>current</b>        The node where the mouse pointer is currently located.  But unlike <b>active</b>, this id changes
                      while the selection is dragged.  It is used to determine the current  node  during  button
                      drags.

       <b>down</b>           The next open node from the current focus. The <b>down</b> of the last open node is the same.

       <b>end</b>            The last open node (in depth-first order) on the tree.

       <b>focus</b>          The  node  that  currently  has focus.  When a node has focus, it receives key events.  To
                      indicate focus, the node is drawn with a dotted line around its label.  You can change the
                      focus using the <b>focus</b> operation.

       <b>last</b>           The last open node from the current focus. But unlike <b>up</b>, when the focus is at root,  <b>last</b>
                      wraps around to the last open node in the tree.

       <b>mark</b>           The  node representing the non-fixed end of the current selection.  The mark is set by the
                      <b>selection</b> <b>mark</b> operation.

       <b>next</b>           The next open node from the current focus.  But unlike <b>down</b>, when the  focus  is  on  last
                      open node, <b>next</b> wraps around to the root node.

       <b>nextsibling</b>    The  next  sibling  from the node with the current focus.  If the node is already the last
                      sibling then it is the <b>nextsibling.</b>

       <b>parent</b>         The parent of the node with the current focus. The <b>parent</b> of the root is also the root.

       <b>prevsibling</b>    The previous sibling from the node with the current focus.  If the  node  is  already  the
                      first sibling then it is the <b>prevsibling.</b>

       <b>root</b>           The root node. You can also use id <b>0</b> to indicate the root.

       <b>up</b>             The  last open node (in depth-first order) from the current focus. The <b>up</b> of the root node
                      (i.e. the root has focus) is also the root.

       <b>view.top</b>       First node that's current visible in the widget.

       <b>view.bottom</b>    Last node that's current visible in the widget.

       <u>path</u>           Absolute path of a node.  Path names refer to the node name, not their entry labels. Paths
                      don't have to start with a  separator  (see  the  <b>-separator</b>  configuration  option),  but
                      component names must be separated by the designated separator.

       <b>@</b><u>x</u><b>,</b><u>y</u>           Indicates  the  node that covers the point in the treeview window specified by <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> (in
                      pixel coordinates).  If no part of the entryd covers that point, then the closest node  to
                      that point is used.

       A  node  may  be specified as an id or tag. If the specifier is an integer then it is assumed to refer to
       the single node with that id.  If the specifier is not an integer, it's checked to see if it's a  special
       id (such as focus).  Otherwise, it's assumed to be tag.  Some operations only operate on a single node at
       a time; if a tag refers to more than one node, then an error is generated.

</pre><h4><b>DATA</b> <b>FIELDS</b></h4><pre>
       A  node in the tree can have <u>data</u> <u>fields</u>.  A data field is a name-value pair, used to represent arbitrary
       data in the node.  Nodes can contain different fields (they aren't required to contain the same  fields).
       You  can  optionally display these fields in the <b>treeview</b> widget in columns running on either side of the
       displayed tree.  A node's value for the field is  drawn  in  the  column  along  side  its  node  in  the
       hierarchy.   Any  node  that  doesn't  have a specific field is left blank.  Columns can be interactively
       resized, hidden, or, moved.

</pre><h4><b>ENTRY</b> <b>BINDINGS</b></h4><pre>
       You can bind Tcl commands to be invoked when events occur on nodes (much like Tk canvas items).  You  can
       bind a node using its id or its <u>bindtags</u>.  Bindtags are simply names that associate a binding with one or
       more nodes.  There is a built-in tag <b>all</b> that all node entries automatically have.

</pre><h4><b>TREEVIEW</b> <b>OPERATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>treeview</b>  operations  are  the  invoked  by specifying the widget's pathname, the operation, and any
       arguments that pertain to that operation.  The general form is:

              <u>pathName</u> <u>operation</u> ?<u>arg</u> <u>arg</u> <u>...</u>?

       <u>Operation</u> and the <u>arg</u>s determine the  exact  behavior  of  the  command.   The  following  operation  are
       available for <b>treeview</b> widgets:

       <u>pathName</u> <b>bbox</b> ?<b>-screen</b>? <u>tagOrId...</u>
              Returns  a  list  of  4  numbers, representing a bounding box of around the specified entries. The
              entries is given by one or more <u>tagOrId</u> arguments.  If the <b>-screen</b> flag is  given,  then  the  x-y
              coordinates  of  the  bounding  box  are  returned as screen coordinates, not virtual coordinates.
              Virtual coordinates start from <b>0</b> from the root node.  The returned  list  contains  the  following
              values.

              <u>x</u>           X-coordinate of the upper-left corner of the bounding box.

              <u>y</u>           Y-coordinate of the upper-left corner of the bounding box.

              <u>width</u>       Width of the bounding box.

              <u>height</u>      Height of the bounding box.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>bind</b> <u>tagName</u> ?<u>sequence</u> <u>command</u>?
              Associates <u>command</u> with <u>tagName</u> such that whenever the event sequence given by <u>sequence</u> occurs for
              a  node  with this tag, <u>command</u> will be invoked.  The syntax is similar to the <b>bind</b> command except
              that it operates on <b>treeview</b> entries, rather than widgets. See the <b>bind</b> manual entry for  complete
              details on <u>sequence</u> and the substitutions performed on <u>command</u> before invoking it.

              If  all  arguments are specified then a new binding is created, replacing any existing binding for
              the same <u>sequence</u> and <u>tagName</u>.  If the first character of <u>command</u> is <b>+</b> then  <u>command</u>  augments  an
              existing  binding  rather  than replacing it.  If no <u>command</u> argument is provided then the command
              currently associated with <u>tagName</u> and <u>sequence</u> (it's an error occurs if there's no  such  binding)
              is  returned.  If both <u>command</u> and <u>sequence</u> are missing then a list of all the event sequences for
              which bindings have been defined for <u>tagName</u>.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>button</b> <u>operation</u> ?<u>args</u>?
              This command is used to control the button selectors within a <b>treeview</b>  widget.   It  has  several
              forms, depending on <u>operation</u>:

              <u>pathName</u> <b>button</b> <b>activate</b> <u>tagOrId</u>
                     Designates  the node given by <u>tagOrId</u> as active.  When a node is active it's entry is drawn
                     using its active icon (see the <b>-activeicon</b> option).  Note that there can be only one active
                     entry at a time.  The special id <b>active</b> indicates the currently active node.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>button</b> <b>bind</b> <u>tagName</u> ?<u>sequence</u> <u>command</u>?
                     Associates <u>command</u> with <u>tagName</u> such that whenever the event  sequence  given  by  <u>sequence</u>
                     occurs for an button of a node entry with this tag, <u>command</u> will be invoked.  The syntax is
                     similar  to  the  <b>bind</b>  command  except  that  it operates on <b>treeview</b> buttons, rather than
                     widgets. See the <b>bind</b> manual entry for complete details on <u>sequence</u> and  the  substitutions
                     performed on <u>command</u> before invoking it.

                     If  all  arguments  are  specified  then  a  new binding is created, replacing any existing
                     binding for the same <u>sequence</u> and <u>tagName</u>.  If the first character of  <u>command</u>  is  <b>+</b>  then
                     <u>command</u>  augments  an existing binding rather than replacing it.  If no <u>command</u> argument is
                     provided then the command currently associated with <u>tagName</u> and  <u>sequence</u>  (it's  an  error
                     occurs  if  there's no such binding) is returned.  If both <u>command</u> and <u>sequence</u> are missing
                     then a list of all the event sequences for which bindings have been defined for <u>tagName</u>.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>button</b> <b>cget</b> <u>option</u>
                     Returns the current value of the configuration option given by <u>option</u>.  <u>Option</u> may have any
                     of the values accepted by the <b>configure</b> operation described below.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>button</b> <b>configure</b> ?<u>option</u>? ?<u>value</u> <u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>...</u>?
                     Query or modify the configuration options of  the  widget.   If  no  <u>option</u>  is  specified,
                     returns  a  list describing all of the available options for <u>pathName</u> (see <b>Tk_ConfigureInfo</b>
                     for information on the format of this list).  If <u>option</u> is specified with  no  <u>value</u>,  then
                     the  command returns a list describing the one named option (this list will be identical to
                     the corresponding sublist of the value returned if no <u>option</u> is specified).  If one or more
                     <u>option-value</u> pairs are specified, then the command modifies the given widget  option(s)  to
                     have  the  given  value(s);   in this case the command returns an empty string.  <u>Option</u> and
                     <u>value</u> are described in the section <b>BUTTON</b> <b>OPTIONS</b> below.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>cget</b> <u>option</u>
              Returns the current value of the configuration option given by <u>option</u>.  <u>Option</u> may have any of the
              values accepted by the <b>configure</b> operation described below.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>close</b> ?<b>-recurse</b>? <u>tagOrId...</u>
              Closes the node specified by <u>tagOrId</u>.   In  addition,  if  a  Tcl  script  was  specified  by  the
              <b>-closecommand</b>  option,  it is invoked.  If the node is already closed, this command has no effect.
              If the <b>-recurse</b> flag is present, each child node is recursively closed.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>column</b> <u>operation</u> ?<u>args</u>?
              The following operations are available for treeview columns.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>column</b> <b>activate</b> <u>column</u>
                     Sets the active column to <u>column</u>.  <u>Column</u> is the name of a column in the  widget.   When  a
                     column  is  active,  it's drawn using its <b>-activetitlebackground</b> and <b>-activetitleforeground</b>
                     options.  If <u>column</u> is the <b>""</b>, then no column will be active.  If  no  column  argument  is
                     provided, then the name of the currently active column is returned.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>column</b> <b>cget</b> <u>name</u> <u>option</u>
                     Returns  the  current  value  of  the column configuration option given by <u>option</u> for <u>name</u>.
                     <u>Name</u> is the name of column that corresponds to a data field.  <u>Option</u> may have  any  of  the
                     values accepted by the <b>configure</b> operation described below.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>column</b> <b>configure</b> <u>name</u> ?<u>option</u>? ?<u>value</u> <u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>...</u>?
                     Query  or  modify  the  configuration options of the column designated by <u>name</u>. <u>Name</u> is the
                     name of the column corresponding to a data field.  If no <u>option</u>  is  specified,  returns  a
                     list  describing  all  of  the  available  options  for  <u>pathName</u> (see <b>Tk_ConfigureInfo</b> for
                     information on the format of this list).  If <u>option</u> is specified with no  <u>value</u>,  then  the
                     command  returns a list describing the one named option (this list will be identical to the
                     corresponding sublist of the value returned if no <u>option</u> is specified).   If  one  or  more
                     <u>option-value</u>  pairs  are specified, then the command modifies the given widget option(s) to
                     have the given value(s);  in this case the command returns an  empty  string.   <u>Option</u>  and
                     <u>value</u> are described in the section <b>COLUMN</b> <b>OPTIONS</b> below.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>column</b> <b>delete</b> <u>field</u> ?<u>field</u>...?
                     Deletes  one  of more columns designated by <u>field</u>.  Note that this does not delete the data
                     fields themselves.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>column</b> <b>insert</b> <u>position</u> <u>field</u> ?<u>options</u>...?
                     Inserts one of more columns designated by <u>field</u>.  A column displays each node's data  field
                     by  the  same  name.   If  the  node  doesn't have the given field, the cell is left blank.
                     <u>Position</u> indicates where in the list of columns to add the new column.  It may be either  a
                     number or <b>end</b>.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>column</b> <b>invoke</b> <u>field</u>
                     Invokes  the  Tcl  command  associated  with  the  column <u>field</u>, if there is one (using the
                     column's <b>-command</b> option).  The command is ignored if the column's  <b>-state</b>  option  set  to
                     <b>disabled</b>.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>column</b> <b>move</b> <u>name</u> <u>dest</u>
                     Moves the column <u>name</u> to the destination position.  <u>Dest</u> is the name of another column or a
                     screen position in the form <b>@</b><u>x</u><b>,</b><u>y</u>.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>column</b> <b>names</b>
                     Returns  a  list  of  the  names  of all columns in the widget.  The list is ordered as the
                     columns are drawn from left-to-right.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>column</b> <b>nearest</b> <u>x</u> ?<u>y</u>?
                     Returns the name of the column closest to the given X-Y screen coordinate.  If you  provide
                     a  <u>y</u> argument (it's optional), a name is returned only when if the point is over a column's
                     title.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>configure</b> ?<u>option</u>? ?<u>value</u> <u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>...</u>?
              Query or modify the configuration options of the widget.  If no <u>option</u>  is  specified,  returns  a
              list describing all of the available options for <u>pathName</u> (see <b>Tk_ConfigureInfo</b> for information on
              the  format  of this list).  If <u>option</u> is specified with no <u>value</u>, then the command returns a list
              describing the one named option (this list will be identical to the corresponding sublist  of  the
              value  returned if no <u>option</u> is specified).  If one or more <u>option-value</u> pairs are specified, then
              the command modifies the given widget option(s) to have the given  value(s);   in  this  case  the
              command  returns  an empty string.  <u>Option</u> and <u>value</u> are described in the section <b>TREEVIEW</b> <b>OPTIONS</b>
              below.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>curselection</b>
              Returns a list containing the ids of all of the entries that are currently selected.  If there are
              no entries selected, then the empty string is returned.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>delete</b> <u>tagOrId</u>...
              Deletes one or more entries given by <u>tagOrId</u> and its children.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>entry</b> <u>operation</u> ?<u>args</u>?
              The following operations are available for treeview entries.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>entry</b> <b>activate</b> <u>tagOrId</u>
                     Sets the active entry to the one specified by <u>tagOrId</u>.  When an entry is active it is drawn
                     using its active icon (see the <b>-activeicon</b> option).  Note that there can be only one active
                     node at a time.  The special id of the currently active node is <b>active</b>.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>entry</b> <b>cget</b> <u>option</u>
                     Returns the current value of the configuration option given by <u>option</u>.  <u>Option</u> may have any
                     of the values accepted by the <b>configure</b> operation described below.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>entry</b> <b>children</b> <u>tagOrId</u>  ?<u>first</u>? ?<u>last</u>?
                     Returns a list of ids for the given range of children of <u>tagOrId</u>.  <u>TagOrId</u> is the id or tag
                     of the node to be examined.  If only a <u>first</u> argument is present, then the id of  the  that
                     child  at  that  numeric position is returned.  If both <u>first</u> and <u>last</u> arguments are given,
                     then the ids of all the children in that range are returned.   Otherwise  the  ids  of  all
                     children are returned.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>entry</b> <b>configure</b> ?<u>option</u>? ?<u>value</u> <u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>...</u>?
                     Query  or  modify  the  configuration  options  of  the widget.  If no <u>option</u> is specified,
                     returns a list describing all of the available options for <u>pathName</u>  (see  <b>Tk_ConfigureInfo</b>
                     for  information  on  the format of this list).  If <u>option</u> is specified with no <u>value</u>, then
                     the command returns a list describing the one named option (this list will be identical  to
                     the corresponding sublist of the value returned if no <u>option</u> is specified).  If one or more
                     <u>option-value</u>  pairs  are specified, then the command modifies the given widget option(s) to
                     have the given value(s);  in this case the command returns an  empty  string.   <u>Option</u>  and
                     <u>value</u> are described below:

              <u>pathName</u> <b>entry</b> <b>delete</b> <u>tagOrId</u> ?<u>first</u> ?<u>last</u>?
                     Deletes  the one or more children nodes of the parent <u>tagOrId</u>.  If <u>first</u> and <u>last</u> arguments
                     are present, they are positions designating a range of children nodes to be deleted.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>entry</b> <b>isbefore</b> <u>tagOrId1</u> <u>tagOrId2</u>
                     Returns 1 if <u>tagOrId1</u> is before <u>tagOrId2</u> and 0 otherwise.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>entry</b> <b>ishidden</b> <u>tagOrId</u>
                     Returns 1 if the node is currently hidden and 0 otherwise.  A node is also hidden if any of
                     its ancestor nodes are closed or hidden.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>entry</b> <b>isopen</b> <u>tagOrId</u>
                     Returns 1 if the node is currently open and 0 otherwise.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>entry</b> <b>size</b> <b>-recurse</b> <u>tagOrId</u>
                     Returns the number of children for parent node <u>tagOrId</u>.  If the <b>-recurse</b> flag is  set,  the
                     number of all its descendants is returned.  The node itself is not counted.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>find</b> ?<u>flags</u>? <u>first</u> <u>last</u>
              Finds  for all entries matching the criteria given by <u>flags</u>.  A list of ids for all matching nodes
              is returned. <u>First</u> and <u>last</u> are ids designating the range of the search in depth-first  order.  If
              <u>last</u> is before <u>first</u>, then nodes are searched in reverse order.  The valid flags are:

              <b>-name</b> <u>pattern</u>
                          Specifies pattern to match against node names.

              <b>-full</b> <u>pattern</u>
                          Specifies pattern to match against node pathnames.

              <b>-</b><u>option</u> <u>pattern</u>
                          Specifies pattern to match against the node entry's configuration option.

              <b>-exact</b>      Patterns must match exactly.  The is the default.

              <b>-glob</b>       Use  global  pattern  matching.  Matching is done in a fashion similar to that used by
                          the C-shell.  For  the  two strings  to match, their contents must be identical except
                          that the  following  special  sequences  may appear in pattern:

                          <b>*</b>    Matches  any  sequence  of  characters in string, including a null string.

                          <b>?</b>    Matches any single character in string.

                          <b>[</b><u>chars</u><b>]</b>
                               Matches any character in the set given by <u>chars</u>. If a sequence of  the  form  <u>x</u>-<u>y</u>
                               appears in <u>chars</u>, then any character between <u>x</u> and <u>y</u>, inclusive, will match.

                          <b>\</b><u>x</u>   Matches   the   single   character   <u>x</u>.   This  provides  a way of  avoiding  the
                               special interpretation of the characters <b>*?[]\</b> in the pattern.

              <b>-regexp</b>     Use regular expression pattern matching (i.e. the same as implemented  by  the  <b>regexp</b>
                          command).

              <b>-nonmatching</b>
                          Pick entries that don't match.

              <b>-exec</b> <u>string</u>
                          Specifies  a  Tcl  script to be invoked for each matching node.  Percent substitutions
                          are performed on <u>string</u> before it is executed.  The following substitutions are valid:

                          <b>%W</b>   The pathname of the widget.

                          <b>%p</b>   The name of the node.

                          <b>%P</b>   The full pathname of the node.

                          <b>%#</b>   The id of the node.

                          <b>%%</b>   Translates to a single percent.

              <b>-count</b> <u>number</u>
                          Stop searching after <u>number</u> matches.

              <b>--</b>          Indicates the end of flags.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>focus</b>  <u>tagOrId</u>
              Sets the focus to the node given by <u>tagOrId</u>.  When a node  has  focus,  it  can  receive  keyboard
              events.  The special id <b>focus</b> designates the node that currently has focus.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>get</b> ?<b>-full</b>? <u>tagOrId</u> <u>tagOrId</u>...
              Translates  one or more ids to their node entry names.  It returns a list of names for all the ids
              specified.  If the <b>-full</b> flag is set, then the full pathnames are returned.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>hide</b> ?<b>flags</b>? <u>tagOrId</u>...
              Hides all nodes matching the criteria given by <u>flags</u>.  The search  is  performed  recursively  for
              each node given by <u>tagOrId</u>.  The valid flags are described below:

              <b>-name</b> <u>pattern</u>
                          Specifies pattern to match against node names.

              <b>-full</b> <u>pattern</u>
                          Specifies pattern to match against node pathnames.

              <b>-</b><u>option</u> <u>pattern</u>
                          Specifies pattern to match against the node entry's configuration option.

              <b>-exact</b>      Match patterns exactly.  The is the default.

              <b>-glob</b>       Use  global  pattern  matching.  Matching is done in a fashion similar to that used by
                          the C-shell.  For  the  two strings  to match, their contents must be identical except
                          that the  following  special  sequences  may appear in pattern:

                          <b>*</b>    Matches  any  sequence  of  characters in string, including a null string.

                          <b>?</b>    Matches any single character in string.

                          <b>[</b><u>chars</u><b>]</b>
                               Matches any character in the set given by <u>chars</u>. If a sequence of  the  form  <u>x</u>-<u>y</u>
                               appears in <u>chars</u>, then any character between <u>x</u> and <u>y</u>, inclusive, will match.

                          <b>\</b><u>x</u>   Matches   the   single   character   <u>x</u>.   This  provides  a way of  avoiding  the
                               special interpretation of the characters <b>*?[]\</b> in the pattern.

              <b>-regexp</b>     Use regular expression pattern matching (i.e. the same as implemented  by  the  <b>regexp</b>
                          command).

              <b>-nonmatching</b>
                          Hide nodes that don't match.

              <b>--</b>          Indicates the end of flags.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>index</b> ?<b>-at</b> <u>tagOrId</u>? <u>string</u>
              Returns the id of the node specified by <u>string</u>.  <u>String</u> may be a tag or node id.  Some special ids
              are normally relative to the node that has focus.  The <b>-at</b> flag lets you select another node.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>insert</b> ?<b>-at</b> <u>tagOrId</u>? <u>position</u> <u>path</u> ?<u>options...</u>? ?<u>path</u>? ?<u>options...</u>?
              Inserts  one  or  more  nodes at <u>position</u>.  <u>Position</u> is the location (number or <b>end</b>) where the new
              nodes are added to the parent node.  <u>Path</u> is the pathname of  the  new  node.   Pathnames  can  be
              formated  either  as  a  Tcl list (each element is a path component) or as a string separated by a
              special character sequence (using the <b>-separator</b> option).  Pathnames are  normally  absolute,  but
              the  <b>-at</b>  switch  lets  you select a relative starting point.  Its value is the id of the starting
              node.

              All ancestors of the new node must already exist, unless the <b>-autocreate</b> option  is  set.   It  is
              also an error if a node already exists, unless the <b>-allowduplicates</b> option is set.

              <u>Option</u> and <u>value</u> may have any of the values accepted by the <b>entry</b> <b>configure</b> operation described in
              the <b>ENTRY</b> <b>OPERATIONS</b> section below.  This command returns a list of the ids of the new entries.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>move</b> <u>tagOrId</u> <u>how</u> <u>destId</u>
              Moves  the  node given by <u>tagOrId</u> to the destination node.  The node can not be an ancestor of the
              destination.  <u>DestId</u> is the id of the destination node and can not be the root of  the  tree.   In
              conjunction with <u>how</u>, it describes how the move is performed.

              <b>before</b>  Moves the node before the destination node.

              <b>after</b>   Moves the node after the destination node.

              <b>into</b>    Moves the node to the end of the destination's list of children.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>nearest</b> <u>x</u> <u>y</u> ?<u>varName</u>?
              Returns  the  id  of  the  node  entry  closest  to the given X-Y screen coordinate.  The optional
              argument <u>varName</u> is the name of variable which is set to either <b>button</b> or <b>select</b> to indicate  over
              what  part of the node the coordinate lies.  If the coordinate is not directly over any node, then
              <u>varName</u> will contain the empty string.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>open</b> ?<b>-recurse</b>? <u>tagOrId...</u>
              Opens the one or more nodes specified by <u>tagOrId</u>.  If a node is not already open, the  Tcl  script
              specified  by  the  <b>-opencommand</b>  option  is  invoked.  If the <b>-recurse</b> flag is present, then each
              descendant is recursively opened.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>range</b> ?<b>-open</b>? <u>first</u> <u>last</u>
              Returns the ids in depth-first order of the nodes between the <u>first</u> and <u>last</u> ids.   If  the  <b>-open</b>
              flag  is present, it indicates to consider only open nodes.  If <u>last</u> is before <u>first</u>, then the ids
              are returned in reverse order.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>scan</b> <u>option</u> <u>args</u>
              This command implements scanning.  It has two forms, depending on <u>option</u>:

              <u>pathName</u> <b>scan</b> <b>mark</b> <u>x</u> <u>y</u>
                     Records <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> and the current view in the treeview  window;   used  in  conjunction  with
                     later <b>scan</b> <b>dragto</b> commands.  Typically this command is associated with a mouse button press
                     in the widget.  It returns an empty string.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>scan</b> <b>dragto</b> <u>x</u> <u>y</u>.
                     Computes the difference between its <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> arguments and the <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> arguments to the last
                     <b>scan</b>  <b>mark</b>  command for the widget.  It then adjusts the view by 10 times the difference in
                     coordinates.  This command is typically associated with mouse motion events in the  widget,
                     to  produce  the  effect of dragging the list at high speed through the window.  The return
                     value is an empty string.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>see</b> ?<b>-anchor</b> <u>anchor</u>? <u>tagOrId</u>
              Adjusts the view of entries so that the node given by <u>tagOrId</u> is visible in the widget window.  It
              is an error if <b>tagOrId</b> is a tag that refers to more than one node.  By default the node's entry is
              displayed in the middle of the window.  This can changed using the <b>-anchor</b> flag.  Its value  is  a
              Tk anchor position.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>selection</b> <u>option</u> <u>arg</u>
              This  command  is  used  to  adjust the selection within a <b>treeview</b> widget.  It has several forms,
              depending on <u>option</u>:

              <u>pathName</u> <b>selection</b> <b>anchor</b> <u>tagOrId</u>
                     Sets the selection anchor to the node given by  <u>tagOrId</u>.   If  <u>tagOrId</u>  refers  to  a  non-
                     existent  node,  then  the  closest  node  is used.  The selection anchor is the end of the
                     selection that is fixed while dragging out a selection with  the  mouse.   The  special  id
                     <b>anchor</b> may be used to refer to the anchor node.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>selection</b> <b>cancel</b>
                     Clears the temporary selection of entries back to the current anchor.  Temporary selections
                     are created by the <b>selection</b> <b>mark</b> operation.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>selection</b> <b>clear</b> <u>first</u> ?<u>last</u>?
                     Removes  the entries between <u>first</u> and <u>last</u> (inclusive) from the selection.  Both <u>first</u> and
                     <u>last</u> are ids representing a range of entries.  If <u>last</u> isn't  given,  then  only  <u>first</u>  is
                     deselected.  Entries outside the selection are not affected.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>selection</b> <b>clearall</b>
                     Clears the entire selection.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>selection</b> <b>mark</b> <u>tagOrId</u>
                     Sets  the  selection  mark  to the node given by <u>tagOrId</u>.  This causes the range of entries
                     between the anchor and the mark to be temporarily added to the  selection.   The  selection
                     mark  is  the  end  of  the selection that is fixed while dragging out a selection with the
                     mouse.  The special id <b>mark</b> may be used to refer to the  current  mark  node.   If  <u>tagOrId</u>
                     refers  to a non-existent node, then the mark is ignored.  Resetting the mark will unselect
                     the previous range.  Setting the anchor finalizes the range.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>selection</b> <b>includes</b> <u>tagOrId</u>
                     Returns 1 if the node given by <u>tagOrId</u> is currently selected, 0 if it isn't.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>selection</b> <b>present</b>
                     Returns 1 if any nodes are currently selected and 0 otherwise.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>selection</b> <b>set</b> <u>first</u> ?<u>last</u>?
                     Selects all of the nodes in the range between <u>first</u> and <u>last</u>, inclusive, without  affecting
                     the selection state of nodes outside that range.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>selection</b> <b>toggle</b> <u>first</u> ?<u>last</u>?
                     Selects/deselects nodes in the range between <u>first</u> and <u>last</u>, inclusive, from the selection.
                     If a node is currently selected, it becomes deselected, and visa versa.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>show</b> ?<b>flags</b>? <u>tagOrId</u>...
              Exposes  all  nodes  matching  the  criteria  given  by  <u>flags</u>.   This  is the inverse of the <b>hide</b>
              operation.  The search is performed recursively for each node given by <u>tagOrId</u>.  The  valid  flags
              are described below:

              <b>-name</b> <u>pattern</u>
                          Specifies pattern to match against node names.

              <b>-full</b> <u>pattern</u>
                          Specifies pattern to match against node pathnames.

              <b>-</b><u>option</u> <u>pattern</u>
                          Specifies pattern to match against the entry's configuration option.

              <b>-exact</b>      Match patterns exactly.  The is the default.

              <b>-glob</b>       <b>-glob</b> Use global pattern matching.  Matching is done in a fashion similar to that used
                          by  the  C-shell.   For   the  two strings  to match, their contents must be identical
                          except that the  following  special  sequences  may appear in pattern:

                          <b>*</b>    Matches  any  sequence  of  characters in string, including a null string.

                          <b>?</b>    Matches any single character in string.

                          <b>[</b><u>chars</u><b>]</b>
                               Matches any character in the set given by <u>chars</u>. If a sequence of  the  form  <u>x</u>-<u>y</u>
                               appears in <u>chars</u>, then any character between <u>x</u> and <u>y</u>, inclusive, will match.

                          <b>\</b><u>x</u>   Matches   the   single   character   <u>x</u>.   This  provides  a way of  avoiding  the
                               special interpretation of the characters <b>*?[]\</b> in the pattern.

              <b>-regexp</b>     Use regular expression pattern matching (i.e. the same as implemented  by  the  <b>regexp</b>
                          command).

              <b>-nonmatching</b>
                          Expose nodes that don't match.

              <b>--</b>          Indicates the end of flags.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>sort</b> ?<u>operation</u>? <u>args...</u>

              <u>pathName</u> <b>sort</b> <b>auto</b> ?<u>boolean</u>
                     Turns  on/off  automatic  sorting  of  node  entries.   If <u>boolean</u> is true, entries will be
                     automatically sorted as they are opened, closed,  inserted,  or  deleted.   If  no  <u>boolean</u>
                     argument is provided, the current state is returned.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>sort</b> <b>cget</b> <u>option</u>
                     Returns the current value of the configuration option given by <u>option</u>.  <u>Option</u> may have any
                     of the values accepted by the <b>configure</b> operation described below.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>sort</b> <b>configure</b> ?<u>option</u>? ?<u>value</u> <u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>...</u>?
                     Query  or  modify  the  sorting  configuration  options  of  the  widget.   If no <u>option</u> is
                     specified, returns a list describing  all  of  the  available  options  for  <u>pathName</u>  (see
                     <b>Tk_ConfigureInfo</b>  for information on the format of this list).  If <u>option</u> is specified with
                     no <u>value</u>, then the command returns a list describing the one named option (this  list  will
                     be identical to the corresponding sublist of the value returned if no <u>option</u> is specified).
                     If  one  or  more  <u>option-value</u>  pairs  are  specified, then the command modifies the given
                     sorting option(s) to have the given value(s);  in this case the command  returns  an  empty
                     string.  <u>Option</u> and <u>value</u> are described below:

                     <b>-column</b> <u>string</u>
                            Specifies the column to sort. Entries in the widget are rearranged according to this
                            column.  If <u>column</u> is <b>""</b> then no sort is performed.

                     <b>-command</b> <u>string</u>
                            Specifies  a Tcl procedure to be called when sorting nodes.  The procedure is called
                            with three arguments: the pathname of the widget and the fields of two entries.  The
                            procedure returns 1 if the first node is greater than the second, -1 is  the  second
                            is greater, and 0 if equal.

                     <b>-decreasing</b> <u>boolean</u>
                            Indicates  to  sort  in  ascending/descending  order.   If <u>boolean</u> is true, then the
                            entries as in descending order. The default is <b>no</b>.

                     <b>-mode</b> <u>string</u>
                            Specifies how to compare entries when sorting. <u>String</u> may be one of the following:

                            <b>ascii</b>          Use string comparison based upon the ASCII collation order.

                            <b>dictionary</b>     Use dictionary-style comparison.  This is the same  as  <b>ascii</b>  except
                                           (a)  case  is  ignored except as a tie-breaker and (b) if two strings
                                           contain embedded  numbers,  the  numbers  compare  as  integers,  not
                                           characters.   For  example,  "bigBoy"  sorts  between  "bigbang"  and
                                           "bigboy", and "x10y" sorts between "x9y" and "x11y".

                            <b>integer</b>        Compares fields as integers.

                            <b>real</b>           Compares fields as floating point numbers.

                            <b>command</b>        Use the Tcl proc specified by the <b>-command</b> option to compare  entries
                                           when sorting.   If no command is specified, the sort reverts to <b>ascii</b>
                                           sorting.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>sort</b> <b>once</b> ?<u>flags</u>? <u>tagOrId...</u>
                     Sorts  the  children for each entries specified by <u>tagOrId</u>.  By default, entries are sorted
                     by name, but you can specify a Tcl proc to do your own comparisons.

                     <b>-recurse</b>       Recursively sort the entire branch, not just the children.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>tag</b> <u>operation</u> <u>args</u>
              Tags are a general means of selecting and marking nodes in the tree.  A tag is just  a  string  of
              characters,  and  it  may take any form except that of an integer.  The same tag may be associated
              with many different nodes.

              Both <u>operation</u> and its arguments determine the exact behavior  of  the  command.   The  operations
              available for tags are listed below.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>tag</b> <b>add</b> <u>string</u> <u>id</u>...
                     Adds the tag <u>string</u> to one of more entries.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>tag</b> <b>delete</b> <u>string</u> <u>id</u>...
                     Deletes the tag <u>string</u> from one or more entries.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>tag</b> <b>forget</b> <u>string</u>
                     Removes  the  tag  <u>string</u>  from all entries.  It's not an error if no entries are tagged as
                     <u>string</u>.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>tag</b> <b>names</b> ?<u>id</u>?
                     Returns a list of tags used.  If an <u>id</u> argument is present, only those  tags  used  by  the
                     node designated by <u>id</u> are returned.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>tag</b> <b>nodes</b> <u>string</u>
                     Returns  a  list  of ids that have the tag <u>string</u>.  If no node is tagged as <u>string</u>, then an
                     empty string is returned.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>text</b> <u>operation</u> ?<u>args</u>?
              This operation is used to provide text editing for cells  (data  fields  in  a  column)  or  entry
              labels.  It has several forms, depending on <u>operation</u>:

              <u>pathName</u> <b>text</b> <b>apply</b>
                     Applies  the  edited  buffer,  replacing  the entry label or data field. The edit window is
                     hidden.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>text</b> <b>cancel</b>
                     Cancels the editing operation, reverting the entry label or data value back to the previous
                     value. The edit window is hidden.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>text</b> <b>cget</b> <u>value</u>
                     Returns the current value of the configuration option given by <u>option</u>.  <u>Option</u> may have any
                     of the values accepted by the <b>configure</b> operation described below.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>text</b> <b>configure</b> ?<u>option</u> <u>value</u>?
                     Query or modify the configuration options of the edit window.  If no <u>option</u>  is  specified,
                     returns  a  list  describing  all  of  the  available  options  (see  <b>Tk_ConfigureInfo</b>  for
                     information on the format of this list).  If <u>option</u> is specified with no  <u>value</u>,  then  the
                     command  returns a list describing the one named option (this list will be identical to the
                     corresponding sublist of the value returned if no <u>option</u> is specified).   If  one  or  more
                     <u>option-value</u>  pairs  are specified, then the command modifies the given widget option(s) to
                     have the given value(s);  in this case the command returns an  empty  string.   <u>Option</u>  and
                     <u>value</u> are described in the section <b>TEXT</b> <b>EDITING</b> <b>OPTIONS</b> below.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>text</b> <b>delete</b> <u>first</u> <u>last</u>
              Deletes the characters in the edit buffer between the two given character positions.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>text</b> <b>get</b> ?<u>-root</u>? <u>x</u> <u>y</u>

       <u>pathName</u> <b>text</b> <b>icursor</b> <u>index</u>

       <u>pathName</u> <b>text</b> <b>index</b> <u>index</u>
              Returns the text index of given <u>index</u>.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>text</b> <b>insert</b> <u>index</u> <u>string</u>
              Insert  the  text string <u>string</u> into the edit buffer at the index <u>index</u>.  For example, the index 0
              will prepend the buffer.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>text</b> <b>selection</b> <u>args</u>
              This operation controls the selection of the editing window.  Note  that  this  differs  from  the
              selection of entries.  It has the following forms:

              <u>pathName</u> <b>text</b> <b>selection</b> <b>adjust</b> <u>index</u>
                     Adjusts either the first or last index of the selection.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>text</b> <b>selection</b> <b>clear</b>
                     Clears the selection.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>text</b> <b>selection</b> <b>from</b> <u>index</u>
                     Sets the anchor of the selection.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>text</b> <b>selection</b> <b>present</b>
                     Indicates if a selection is present.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>text</b> <b>selection</b> <b>range</b> <u>start</u> <u>end</u>
                     Sets both the anchor and mark of the selection.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>text</b> <b>selection</b> <b>to</b> <u>index</u>
                     Sets the unanchored end (mark) of the selection.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>toggle</b> <u>tagOrId</u>
              Opens  or  closes  the  node given by <u>tagOrId</u>.  If the corresponding <b>-opencommand</b> or <b>-closecommand</b>
              option is set, then that command is also invoked.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>xview</b> <u>args</u>
              This command is used to query and change  the  horizontal  position  of  the  information  in  the
              widget's window.  It can take any of the following forms:

              <u>pathName</u> <b>xview</b>
                     Returns  a  list containing two elements.  Each element is a real fraction between 0 and 1;
                     together they describe the horizontal span that is visible in the window.  For example,  if
                     the  first element is .2 and the second element is .6, 20% of the <b>treeview</b> widget's text is
                     off-screen to the left, the middle 40% is visible in the window, and 40%  of  the  text  is
                     off-screen  to  the  right.   These  are  the  same  values  passed  to  scrollbars via the
                     <b>-xscrollcommand</b> option.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>xview</b> <u>tagOrId</u>
                     Adjusts the view in the window so that the character position given by <u>tagOrId</u> is displayed
                     at the left edge of the window.  Character positions  are  defined  by  the  width  of  the
                     character <b>0</b>.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>xview</b> <b>moveto</b> <u>fraction</u>
                     Adjusts the view in the window so that <u>fraction</u> of the total width of the <b>treeview</b> widget's
                     text is off-screen to the left.  <u>fraction</u> must be a fraction between 0 and 1.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>xview</b> <b>scroll</b> <u>number</u> <u>what</u>
                     This  command  shifts  the  view  in the window left or right according to <u>number</u> and <u>what</u>.
                     <u>Number</u> must be an integer.  <u>What</u> must be either <b>units</b> or <b>pages</b> or an abbreviation of one of
                     these.  If <u>what</u> is <b>units</b>, the view adjusts left or right by  <u>number</u>  character  units  (the
                     width  of  the <b>0</b> character) on the display;  if it is <b>pages</b> then the view adjusts by <u>number</u>
                     screenfuls.  If <u>number</u> is negative then characters farther to the left become visible;   if
                     it is positive then characters farther to the right become visible.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>yview</b> <u>?args</u>?
              This command is used to query and change the vertical position of the text in the widget's window.
              It can take any of the following forms:

              <u>pathName</u> <b>yview</b>
                     Returns  a  list containing two elements, both of which are real fractions between 0 and 1.
                     The first element gives the position of the node at the top of the window, relative to  the
                     widget  as a whole (0.5 means it is halfway through the treeview window, for example).  The
                     second element gives the position of the node just  after  the  last  one  in  the  window,
                     relative  to the widget as a whole.  These are the same values passed to scrollbars via the
                     <b>-yscrollcommand</b> option.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>yview</b> <u>tagOrId</u>
                     Adjusts the view in the window so that the node given by <u>tagOrId</u> is displayed at the top of
                     the window.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>yview</b> <b>moveto</b> <u>fraction</u>
                     Adjusts the view in the window so that the node given by <u>fraction</u> appears at the top of the
                     window.  <u>Fraction</u> is a fraction between  0  and  1;   0  indicates  the  first  node,  0.33
                     indicates the node one-third the way through the <b>treeview</b> widget, and so on.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>yview</b> <b>scroll</b> <u>number</u> <u>what</u>
                     This  command  adjusts  the  view  in  the  window up or down according to <u>number</u> and <u>what</u>.
                     <u>Number</u> must be an integer.  <u>What</u> must be either <b>units</b> or <b>pages</b>.  If <u>what</u> is <b>units</b>, the view
                     adjusts up or down by <u>number</u> lines;  if it  is  <b>pages</b>  then  the  view  adjusts  by  <u>number</u>
                     screenfuls.   If  <u>number</u>  is negative then earlier nodes become visible;  if it is positive
                     then later nodes become visible.

</pre><h4><b>TREEVIEW</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       In addition to the <b>configure</b> operation, widget configuration options may also be set  by  the  Tk  <b>option</b>
       command.  The class resource name is <b>TreeView</b>.

              option add *TreeView.Foreground white
              option add *TreeView.Background blue

       The following widget options are available:

       <b>-activebackground</b> <u>color</u>
              Sets  the  background  color for active entries.  A node is active when the mouse passes over it's
              entry or using the <b>activate</b> operation.

       <b>-activeforeground</b> <u>color</u>
              Sets the foreground color of the active node.  A node is active when the mouse  passes  over  it's
              entry or using the <b>activate</b> operation.

       <b>-activeicons</b> <u>images</u>
              Specifies images to be displayed for an entry's icon when it is active. <u>Images</u> is a list of two Tk

       <b>-titleshadow</b> <u>color</u>
              Sets the color of the drop shadow of the column title.  The default is <b>""</b>.

       <b>-width</b> <u>pixels</u>
              Sets  the  requested  width  of  the  column.  This overrides the computed with of the column.  If
              <u>pixels</u> is 0, the width is computed as from the contents of the column. The default is <b>0</b>.

</pre><h4><b>TEXT</b> <b>EDITING</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Text edit window configuration options may also be set by the  <b>option</b>  command.  The  resource  class  is
       <b>TreeViewEditor</b>.  The resource name is always <b>edit</b>.

              option add *TreeViewEditor.Foreground white
              option add *edit.Background blue

       The following are the configuration options available for the text editing window.

       <b>-background</b> <u>color</u>
              Sets the background of the text edit window.  The default is <b>white</b>.

       <b>-borderwidth</b> <u>pixels</u>
              Sets  the  width  of  the  3-D  border around the edit window.  The <b>-relief</b> option determines if a
              border is to be drawn.  The default is <b>1</b>.

       <b>-exportselection</b> <u>boolean</u>
              Indicates if the text selection is exported.  If the edit window is exporting its  selection  then
              it  will  observe the standard X11 protocols for handling the selection.  Selections are available
              as type <b>STRING</b>.  The default is <b>no</b>.

       <b>-relief</b> <u>relief</u>
              Specifies the 3-D effect of the edit window.  <u>Relief</u> indicates how the  background  should  appear
              relative  to  the edit window; for example, <b>raised</b> means the background should appear to protrude.
              The default is <b>solid</b>.

       <b>-selectbackground</b> <u>color</u>
              Sets the background of the selected text in the edit window.  The default is <b>white</b>.

       <b>-selectborderwidth</b> <u>pixels</u>
              Sets the width of the 3-D border around the selected text in the edit window.   The  <b>-selectrelief</b>
              option determines if a border is to be drawn.  The default is <b>1</b>.

       <b>-selectforeground</b> <u>color</u>
              Sets the foreground of the selected text in the edit window.  The default is <b>white</b>.

       <b>-selectrelief</b> <u>relief</u>
              Specifies  the  3-D effect of the selected text in the edit window.  <u>Relief</u> indicates how the text
              should appear relative to the edit window; for example, <b>raised</b> means the  text  should  appear  to
              protrude.  The default is <b>flat</b>.

</pre><h4><b>DEFAULT</b> <b>BINDINGS</b></h4><pre>
       Tk  automatically  creates  class bindings for treeviews that give them Motif-like behavior.  Much of the
       behavior of a <b>treeview</b> widget is determined by its <b>-selectmode</b> option, which selects one of two  ways  of
       dealing with the selection.

       If  the  selection mode is <b>single</b>, only one node can be selected at a time.  Clicking button 1 on an node
       selects it and deselects any other selected item.

       If the selection mode is <b>multiple</b>, any number of entries may be selected at once, including discontiguous
       ranges.  Clicking Control-Button-1 on a node entry toggles its  selection  state  without  affecting  any
       other entries.  Pressing Shift-Button-1 on a node entry selects it, extends the selection.

       [1]    In <b>extended</b> mode, the selected range can be adjusted by pressing button 1 with the Shift key down:
              this  modifies  the selection to consist of the entries between the anchor and the entry under the
              mouse, inclusive.  The un-anchored end of this new selection can also be dragged with  the  button
              down.

       [2]    In  <b>extended</b>  mode,  pressing  button  1  with the Control key down starts a toggle operation: the
              anchor is set to the entry under the mouse, and its selection state is  reversed.   The  selection
              state  of  other  entries  isn't  changed.   If  the mouse is dragged with button 1 down, then the
              selection state of all entries between the anchor and the entry under the mouse is  set  to  match
              that of the anchor entry;  the selection state of all other entries remains what it was before the
              toggle operation began.

       [3]    If  the  mouse  leaves  the  treeview  window with button 1 down, the window scrolls away from the
              mouse, making information visible that used to be off-screen  on  the  side  of  the  mouse.   The
              scrolling  continues  until  the mouse re-enters the window, the button is released, or the end of
              the hierarchy is reached.

       [4]    Mouse button 2 may be used for scanning.  If it is pressed and dragged over the  <b>treeview</b>  widget,
              the contents of the hierarchy drag at high speed in the direction the mouse moves.

       [5]    If  the  Up or Down key is pressed, the location cursor (active entry) moves up or down one entry.
              If the selection mode is <b>browse</b> or <b>extended</b> then the new active entry is  also  selected  and  all
              other entries are deselected.  In <b>extended</b> mode the new active entry becomes the selection anchor.

       [6]    In  <b>extended</b>  mode, Shift-Up and Shift-Down move the location cursor (active entry) up or down one
              entry and also extend the selection to that entry in a fashion  similar  to  dragging  with  mouse
              button 1.

       [7]    The  Left  and  Right  keys  scroll  the  <b>treeview</b>  widget view left and right by the width of the
              character <b>0</b>.  Control-Left and Control-Right scroll the <b>treeview</b> widget view left and right by the
              width of the window.  Control-Prior and Control-Next also scroll left and right by  the  width  of
              the window.

       [8]    The Prior and Next keys scroll the <b>treeview</b> widget view up and down by one page (the height of the
              window).

       [9]    The  Home  and  End  keys  scroll  the  <b>treeview</b>  widget horizontally to the left and right edges,
              respectively.

       [10]   Control-Home sets the location cursor to the the first entry, selects that  entry,  and  deselects
              everything else in the widget.

       [11]   Control-End  sets  the  location  cursor  to the the last entry, selects that entry, and deselects
              everything else in the widget.

       [12]   In <b>extended</b> mode, Control-Shift-Home extends the selection to the first entry  and  Control-Shift-
              End extends the selection to the last entry.

       [13]   In  <b>multiple</b>  mode,  Control-Shift-Home  moves the location cursor to the first entry and Control-
              Shift-End moves the location cursor to the last entry.

       [14]   The space and Select keys make a selection at the location cursor (active entry) just as if  mouse
              button 1 had been pressed over this entry.

       [15]   In  <b>extended</b>  mode,  Control-Shift-space and Shift-Select extend the selection to the active entry
              just as if button 1 had been pressed with the Shift key down.

       [16]   In <b>extended</b> mode, the Escape key cancels the most recent selection and restores all the entries in
              the selected range to their previous selection state.

       [17]   Control-slash selects everything in the widget, except in <b>single</b> and <b>browse</b> modes, in  which  case
              it selects the active entry and deselects everything else.

       [18]   Control-backslash  deselects  everything  in  the  widget,  except  in <b>browse</b> mode where it has no
              effect.

       [19]   The F16 key (labelled Copy on many Sun workstations) or Meta-w copies the selection in the  widget
              to the clipboard, if there is a selection.

       The  behavior  of  <b>treeview</b>  widgets can be changed by defining new bindings for individual widgets or by
       redefining the class bindings.

   <b>WIDGET</b> <b>BINDINGS</b>
       In addition to the above behavior, the following additional behavior is defined  by  the  default  widget
       class (TreeView) bindings.

       <b>&lt;ButtonPress-2&gt;</b>
              Starts scanning.

       <b>&lt;B2-Motion&gt;</b>
              Adjusts the scan.

       <b>&lt;ButtonRelease-2&gt;</b>
              Stops scanning.

       <b>&lt;B1-Leave&gt;</b>
              Starts auto-scrolling.

       <b>&lt;B1-Enter&gt;</b>
              Starts auto-scrolling

       <b>&lt;KeyPress-Up&gt;</b>
              Moves the focus to the previous entry.

       <b>&lt;KeyPress-Down&gt;</b>
              Moves the focus to the next entry.

       <b>&lt;Shift-KeyPress-Up&gt;</b>
              Moves the focus to the previous sibling.

       <b>&lt;Shift-KeyPress-Down&gt;</b>
              Moves the focus to the next sibling.

       <b>&lt;KeyPress-Prior&gt;</b>
              Moves the focus to first entry.  Closed or hidden entries are ignored.

       <b>&lt;KeyPress-Next&gt;</b>
              Move the focus to the last entry. Closed or hidden entries are ignored.

       <b>&lt;KeyPress-Left&gt;</b>
              Closes the entry.  It is not an error if the entry has no children.

       <b>&lt;KeyPress-Right&gt;</b>
              Opens the entry, displaying its children.  It is not an error if the entry has no children.

       <b>&lt;KeyPress-space&gt;</b>
              In  "single"  select mode this selects the entry.  In "multiple" mode, it toggles the entry (if it
              was previous selected, it is not deselected).

       <b>&lt;KeyRelease-space&gt;</b>
              Turns off select mode.

       <b>&lt;KeyPress-Return&gt;</b>
              Sets the focus to the current entry.

       <b>&lt;KeyRelease-Return&gt;</b>
              Turns off select mode.

       <b>&lt;KeyPress&gt;</b>
              Moves to the next entry whose label starts with the letter typed.

       <b>&lt;KeyPress-Home&gt;</b>
              Moves the focus to first entry.  Closed or hidden entries are ignored.

       <b>&lt;KeyPress-End&gt;</b>
              Move the focus to the last entry. Closed or hidden entries are ignored.

       <b>&lt;KeyPress-F1&gt;</b>
              Opens all entries.

       <b>&lt;KeyPress-F2&gt;</b>
              Closes all entries (except root).

   <b>BUTTON</b> <b>BINDINGS</b>
       Buttons have bindings.  There are associated with the "all" bindtag (see the  entry's  -bindtag  option).
       You can use the <b>bind</b> operation to change them.

              Highlights the button of the current entry.

       <b>&lt;Leave&gt;</b>
              Returns the button back to its normal state.

       <b>&lt;ButtonRelease-1&gt;</b>
              Adjust the view so that the current entry is visible.

   <b>ENTRY</b> <b>BINDINGS</b>
       Entries  have  default  bindings.   There are associated with the "all" bindtag (see the entry's -bindtag
       option).  You can use the <b>bind</b> operation to modify them.

       <b>&lt;Enter&gt;</b>
              Highlights the current entry.

       <b>&lt;Leave&gt;</b>
              Returns the entry back to its normal state.

       <b>&lt;Control-Shift-B1-Motion&gt;</b>
              Place holder. Does nothing.

   <b>COLUMN</b> <b>BINDINGS</b>
       Columns  have bindings too.  They are associated with the column's "all" bindtag (see the column -bindtag
       option).  You can use the <b>column</b> <b>bind</b> operation to change them.

       <b>&lt;Enter&gt;</b>

       <b>&lt;ButtonRelease-1&gt;</b>
              Adjust the size of the column, based upon the resize anchor and mark positions.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>treeview</b> command creates a new widget.

              treeview .h -bg white

       A new Tcl command <b>.h</b> is also created.  This command can be used to query and modify the <b>treeview</b>  widget.
       For  example,  to  change  the  background color of the table to "green", you use the new command and the
       widget's <b>configure</b> operation.

              # Change the background color.
              .h configure -background "green"

       By default, the <b>treeview</b> widget will automatically create a new tree object to  contain  the  data.   The
       name  of  the  new tree is the pathname of the widget.  Above, the new tree object name is ".h".  But you
       can use the <b>-tree</b> option to specify the name of another tree.

              # View the tree "myTree".
              .h configure -tree "myTree"

       When a new tree is created, it contains only a root node.  The node is automatically opened.  The  id  of
       the  root  node  is  always  <b>0</b>  (you can use also use the special id <b>root</b>). The <b>insert</b> operation lets you
       insert one or more new entries into the tree.  The last argument is the node's <u>pathname</u>.

              # Create a new entry named "myEntry"
              set id [.h insert end "myEntry"]

       This appends a new node named "myEntry".  It will positioned as the last child of the root  of  the  tree
       (using the position "end").  You can supply another position to order the node within its siblings.

              # Prepend "fred".
              set id [.h insert 0 "fred"]

       Entry  names  do not need to be unique.  By default, the node's label is its name.  To supply a different
       text label, add the <b>-label</b> option.

              # Create a new node named "fred"
              set id [.h insert end "fred" -label "Fred Flintstone"]

       The <b>insert</b> operation returns the id of the new node.  You can also use the <b>index</b> operation  to  get  this
       information.

              # Get the id of "fred"
              .h index "fred"

       To  insert  a  node somewhere other than root, use the <b>-at</b> switch.  It takes the id of the node where the
       new child will be added.

              # Create a new node "barney" in "fred".
              .h insert -at $id end "barney"

       A pathname describes the path to an entry in the hierarchy.  It's a list of entry names that compose  the
       path in the tree.  Therefore, you can also add "barney" to "fred" as follows.

              # Create a new sub-entry of "fred"
              .h insert end "fred barney"

       Every  name  in  the list is ancestor of the next.  All ancestors must already exist.  That means that an
       entry "fred" is an ancestor of "barney" and  must  already  exist.   But  you  can  use  the  <b>-autocreate</b>
       configuration option to force the creation of ancestor nodes.

              # Force the creation of ancestors.
              .h configure -autocreate yes
              .h insert end "fred barney wilma betty"

       Sometimes the pathname is already separated by a character sequence rather than formed as a list.  A file
       name is a good example of this.  You can use the <b>-separator</b> option to specify a separator string to split
       the  path  into its components.  Each pathname inserted is automatically split using the separator string
       as a separator.  Multiple separators are treated as one.

              .h configure -separator /
              .h insert end "/usr/local/tcl/bin"

       If the path is prefixed by extraneous characters, you can automatically  trim  it  off  using  the  <b>-trim</b>
       option.  It removed the string from the path before it is parsed.

              .h configure -trim C:/windows -separator /
              .h insert end "C:/window/system"

       You  can  insert  more  than one entry at a time with the <b>insert</b> operation.  This can be much faster than
       looping over a list of names.

              # The slow way
              foreach f [glob $dir/*] {
                  .h insert end $f
              }
              # The fast way
              eval .h insert end [glob $dir/*]

       In this case, the <b>insert</b> operation will return a list of ids of the new entries.

       You can delete entries with the <b>delete</b> operation.  It takes one or more tags of ids as its  argument.  It
       deletes the entry and all its children.

              .h delete $id

       Entries  have  several configuration options.  They control the appearance of the entry's icon and label.
       We have already seen the <b>-label</b> option that sets the entry's text label.   The <b>entry</b> <b>configure</b>  operation
       lets you set or modify an entry's configuration options.

              .h entry configure $id -color red -font fixed

       You can hide an entry and its children using the <b>-hide</b> option.

              .h entry configure $id -hide yes

       More  that  one  entry  can  be  configured  at once.  All entries specified are configured with the same
       options.

              .h entry configure $i1 $i2 $i3 $i4 -color brown

       An icon is displayed for each entry.  It's a Tk image drawn to the left of the label.  You  can  set  the
       icon  with  the  entry's  <b>-icons</b>  option.   It takes a list of two image names: one to represent the open
       entry, another when it is closed.

              set im1 [image create photo -file openfolder.gif]
              set im2 [image create photo -file closefolder.gif]
              .h entry configure $id -icons "$im1 $im2"

       If <b>-icons</b> is set to the empty string, no icons are display.

       If an entry has children, a button is displayed to the left of the  icon.  Clicking  the  mouse  on  this
       button  opens or closes the sub-hierarchy.  The button is normally a <b>+</b> or <b>-</b> symbol, but can be configured
       in a variety of ways using the <b>button</b> <b>configure</b> operation.  For example, the  <b>+</b>  and  <b>-</b>  symbols  can  be
       replaced with Tk images.

              set im1 [image create photo -file closefolder.gif]
              set im2 [image create photo -file downarrow.gif]
              .h button configure $id -images "$im1 $im2" \

       Entries  can  contain  an  arbitrary  number of <u>data</u> <u>fields</u>.  Data fields are name-value pairs.  Both the
       value and name are strings.  The entry's <b>-data</b> option lets you set data fields.

              .h entry configure $id -data {mode 0666 group users}

       The <b>-data</b> takes a list of name-value pairs.

       You can display these data fields as <u>columns</u> in the  <b>treeview</b>  widget.   You  can  create  and  configure
       columns with the <b>column</b> operation.  For example, to add a new column to the widget, use the <b>column</b> <b>insert</b>
       operation.  The last argument is the name of the data field that you want to display.

              .h column insert end "mode"

       The  column  title  is  displayed at the top of the column.  By default, it's is the field name.  You can
       override this using the column's <b>-text</b> option.

              .h column insert end "mode" -text "File Permissions"

       Columns have several configuration options.  The <b>column</b> <b>configure</b> operation  lets  you  query  or  modify
       column options.

              .h column configure "mode" -justify left

       The  <b>-justify</b>  option  says  how  the data is justified within in the column.  The <b>-hide</b> option indicates
       whether the column is displayed.

              .h column configure "mode" -hide yes

       Entries can be selected by clicking on the mouse.  Selected entries are drawn using the colors  specified
       by the <b>-selectforeground</b> and <b>-selectbackground</b> configuration options.  The selection itself is managed by
       the <b>selection</b> operation.

              # Clear all selections
              .h selection clear 0 end
              # Select the root node
              .h selection set 0

       The <b>curselection</b> operation returns a list of ids of all the selected entries.

              set ids [.h curselection]

       You can use the <b>get</b> operation to convert the ids to their pathnames.

              set names [eval .h get -full $ids]

       If  a  treeview  is exporting its selection (using the <b>-exportselection</b> option), then it will observe the
       standard X11 protocols for handling the selection.  Treeview selections are available as type <b>STRING</b>; the
       value of the selection will be the pathnames of the selected entries, separated by newlines.

       The <b>treeview</b> supports two modes of selection: <b>single</b> and <b>multiple</b>.  In single select mode, only one entry
       can be selected at a time, while multiple select mode allows several entries to be selected.  The mode is
       set by the widget's <b>-selectmode</b> option.

              .h configure -selectmode "multiple"

       You can be notified when the list of selected entries changes.  The widget's <b>-selectcommand</b>  specifies  a
       Tcl procedure that is called whenever the selection changes.

              proc SelectNotify { widget } {
                 set ids [$widget curselection]
              }
              .h configure -selectcommand "SelectNotify .h"

       The  widget  supports  the  standard  Tk  scrolling  and  scanning  operations.  The <b>treeview</b> can be both
       horizontally and vertically. You can attach scrollbars to the <b>treeview</b> the same way  as  the  listbox  or
       canvas widgets.

              scrollbar .xbar -orient horizontal -command ".h xview"
              scrollbar .ybar -orient vertical -command ".h yview"
              .h configure -xscrollcommand ".xbar set" \
                  -yscrollcommand ".ybar set"

       There  are  three  different modes of scrolling: <b>listbox</b>, <b>canvas</b>, and <b>hierbox</b>.  In <b>listbox</b> mode, the last
       entry can always be scrolled to the top of the widget.  In <b>hierbox</b> mode, the last entry is  always  drawn
       at the bottom of the widget.  The scroll mode is set by the widget's <b>-selectmode</b> option.

              .h configure -scrollmode "listbox"

       Entries can be programmatically opened or closed using the <b>open</b> and <b>close</b> operations respectively.

              .h open $id
              .h close $id

       When an entry is opened, a Tcl procedure can be automatically invoked.  The <b>-opencommand</b> option specifies
       this procedure.  This procedure can lazily insert entries as needed.

              proc AddEntries { dir } {
                 eval .h insert end [glob -nocomplain $dir/*]
              }
              .h configure -opencommand "AddEntries %P"

       Now  when  an entry is opened, the procedure <b>AddEntries</b> is called and adds children to the entry.  Before
       the command is invoked, special "%" substitutions (like <b>bind</b>) are performed. Above, <b>%P</b> is  translated  to
       the pathname of the entry.

       The same feature exists when an entry is closed.  The <b>-closecommand</b> option specifies the procedure.

              proc DeleteEntries { id } {
                 .h entry delete $id 0 end
              }
              .h configure -closecommand "DeleteEntries %#"

       When an entry is closed, the procedure <b>DeleteEntries</b> is called and deletes the entry's children using the
       <b>entry</b> <b>delete</b> operation (<b>%#</b> is the id of entry).
