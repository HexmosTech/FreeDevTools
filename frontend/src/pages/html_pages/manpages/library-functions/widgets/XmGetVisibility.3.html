</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>XmGetVisibility</b> — A function that determines if a widget is visible "XmGetVisibility"

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;Xm/Xm.h&gt;
       <b>XmVisibility</b> <b>XmGetVisibility</b>(
       <b>Widget</b> <b>widget</b>);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>XmGetVisibility</b>  returns  the visibility state of the specified widget.  It checks to see if some part of
       the widget's rectangular area is unobscured by the widget's ancestors,  or  some  part  of  the  widget's
       rectangular  area  is  inside  the work window (but possibly outside the clip window) of a ScrolledWindow
       whose <b>XmNscrollingPolicy</b> is <b>XmAUTOMATIC</b> and whose <b>XmNtraverseObscuredCallback</b> is not NULL.

       <b>XmGetVisibility</b> does not check to see if <u>widget</u> is obscured  by  its  siblings  or  by  siblings  of  its
       ancestors. Consequently, <b>XmGetVisibility</b> returns <b>XmVISIBILITY_UNOBSCURED</b> for widgets which are completely
       or partially covered by one or more siblings of <u>widget</u> by one or more siblings of ancestors of <u>widget</u>.

       When  a  widget  which is unrealized is being queried, it is indicated that the widget is fully obscured.
       If an application unmaps a <u>widget</u> that has its <b>XmNmappedWhenManaged</b> resource  set  to  True,  the  return
       value  is  undefined.  When a widget which is unmanaged is being queried, it is indicated that the widget
       is fully obscured.

       <u>widget</u>    Specifies the ID of the widget

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b></h4><pre>
       Returns one of the following values:

       <b>XmVISIBILITY_UNOBSCURED</b>
                 Indicates that the widget is mapped, not obscured, and is completely visible on the screen.

       <b>XmVISIBILITY_PARTIALLY_OBSCURED</b>
                 Indicates that the widget is mapped, and is not completely visible  on  the  screen  (partially
                 obscured).

       <b>XmVISIBILITY_FULLY_OBSCURED</b>
                 Indicates that the widget is not at all visible on the screen.
