       Tk::Widget - Base class of all widgets

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
          package Tk::Whatever;
          require Tk::Widget;
          @ISA = qw(Tk::Widget);
          Construct Tk::Widget 'Whatever';

          sub Tk_cmd { \&amp;Tk::whatever }

          <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<u>method</u>(?<u>arg,</u> <u>arg,</u> <u>...</u>?)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>Tk::Widget</b> is an abstract base class for all Tk widgets.

       Generic methods available to all widgets include the methods based on core "winfo" mechanism and are used
       to retrieve information about windows managed by Tk. They can take any of a number of different forms,
       depending on the <u>method</u>.  The legal forms are:

       <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>appname</b>?(<u>newName</u>)?
           If  <u>newName</u>  isn't  specified,  this method returns the name of the application (the name that may be
           used in <b>send</b> commands to communicate with the application).  If <u>newName</u> is specified, then  the  name
           of  the application is changed to <u>newName</u>.  If the given name is already in use, then a suffix of the
           form `` <b>#2</b>'' or `` <b>#3</b>'' is appended in order to make the name unique.  The  method's  result  is  the
           name  actually  chosen.   <u>newName</u>  should  not start with a capital letter.  This will interfere with
           option processing, since names starting with capitals are assumed to be classes;  as a result, Tk may
           not be able to find some options for the application.  If sends have been disabled  by  deleting  the
           <b>send</b> command, this command will re-enable them and recreate the <b>send</b> command.

       <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>atom</b>(<u>name</u>)
           Returns  a  decimal string giving the integer identifier for the atom whose name is <u>name</u>.  If no atom
           exists with the name <u>name</u> then a new one is created.

       <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>atomname</b>(<u>id</u>)
           Returns the textual name for the atom whose integer identifier is <u>id</u>.  This command is the inverse of
           the <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>atom</b> command.  It generates an error if no such atom exists.

       <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>bell</b>( ?-nice? );
           This command rings the bell on the display for <u>$widget</u> and returns an empty string.  The command uses
           the current bell-related settings for the display, which may be modified with programs such as <b>xset</b>.

           If <u>-nice</u>  is  not specified, this command also resets the screen saver for the screen.   Some  screen
           savers will ignore this, but  others  will reset so that the screen becomes visible again.

       <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>bindDump</b>
           This  command  returns  a  list  of strings suitable for printing detailing binding information for a
           widget.  It prints a widget's bindtags.  For each binding tag it prints all the  bindings,  comprised
           of  the  event  descriptor  and the callback.  Callback arguments are printed, and <b>Tk::Ev</b> objects are
           expanded.

       <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>Busy</b>?(?-recurse =&gt; 1?,<u>-option</u> =&gt; <u>value</u>?)?
           This method <b>configure</b>s a <b>-cursor</b> option for <u>$widget</u> and (if <b>-recurse</b>  <b>=</b>  1&gt;  is  specified)  all  its
           descendants.  The  cursor  to  be  set  may  be  passed  as <b>-cursor</b> = <u>cursor</u>&gt; or defaults to 'watch'.
           Additional <b>configure</b> options are applied to <u>$widget</u> only.  It also adds a special tag <b>'Busy'</b>  to  the
           <b>bindtags</b>  of  the  widgets so configured so that  <b>KeyPress</b>, <b>KeyRelease</b>, <b>ButtonPress</b> and <b>ButtonRelease</b>
           events are ignored (with press events generating a call to <b>bell</b>). It then acquires a local  <b>grab</b>  for
           <u>$widget</u>.  The state of the widgets and the grab is restored by a call to <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>Unbusy</b>.

       <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>caret</b>( ?-x =&gt; <u>x</u>?, ?-y =&gt; <u>y</u>?, ?-height =&gt; <u>height</u>? );
           Sets  and queries the caret location for the display of the specified Tk window window.  The caret is
           the per-display cursor location used for indicating global  focus  (e.g.  to  comply  with  Microsoft
           Accessibility  guidelines),  as  well  as  for location of the over-the-spot XIM (X Input Methods) or
           Windows IME windows. If no options are specified, the last values used  for  setting  the  caret  are
           return  in option-value pair format.  -x and -y represent window-relative coordinates, and -height is
           the height of the current cursor location, or the height of the specified window if none is given.

       <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>cells</b>
           Returns a decimal string giving the number of cells in the color map for <u>$widget</u>.

       <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>children</b>
           <u>$widget-</u>&gt;<b>children</b> Returns a list containing all the children of $widget.  The  list  is  in  stacking
           order,  with  the  lowest  window first.  Top-level windows are returned as children of their logical
           parents.

       <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>class</b>
           Returns the class name for <u>$widget</u>.

       <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>colormapfull</b>
           Returns 1 if the colormap for <u>$widget</u> is known to be full, 0 otherwise.  The colormap for a window is
           ``known'' to be full if the last attempt to allocate a new color  on  that  window  failed  and  this
           application hasn't freed any colors in the colormap since the failed allocation.

       <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>ConfigSpecs</b>
           Used    to    perform    delegated   option   configuration   for   a   mega-widget.    Returns,   in
           Tk::Derived::ConfigSpecs notation (see Tk::ConfigSpecs), all  possible  options  for  a  widget.  For
           example,

            $s = $self-&gt;Scale;
            $self-&gt;ConfigSpecs(
                $s-&gt;ConfigSpecs,
                .... more ConfigSpecs specifications
            );

           returns a hash of all Tk::Scale options, delegated to $s - e.g. some representative examples:

            -bigincrement =&gt; [$s, bigIncrement, BigIncrement, 0, 0]
            -digits       =&gt; [$s, digits, Digits, 0, 0]
            -sliderlength =&gt; [$s, sliderLength, SliderLength, 10m, 30]
            -troughcolor  =&gt; [$s, troughColor, Background, #c3c3c3, #c3c3c3]

           This provides an easy means of populating a mega-widget's ConfigSpecs with initializers.

       <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>containing</b>(<u>rootX,rootY</u>)
           Returns  the  window containing the point given by <u>rootX</u> and <u>rootY</u>.  <u>RootX</u> and <u>rootY</u> are specified in
           screen units (i.e.  any form acceptable to <b>Tk_GetPixels</b>) in the coordinate system of the root  window
           (if  a virtual-root window manager is in use then the coordinate system of the virtual root window is
           used).  If no window in this application contains the point then an empty  string  is  returned.   In
           selecting  the  containing window, children are given higher priority than parents and among siblings
           the highest one in the stacking order is chosen.

       <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>depth</b>
           Returns a decimal string giving the depth of <u>$widget</u> (number of bits per pixel).

       <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>destroy</b>
           This command deletes the window related to <u>$widget</u>, plus all its descendants.  If all the <b>MainWindows</b>
           are deleted then the entire application will be destroyed.

           The perl object <u>$widget</u> continues to exist while references to it still exist,  e.g.  until  variable
           goes  out  of scope.  However any attempt to use Tk methods on the object will fail.  <b>Exists</b>(<u>$widget</u>)
           will return false on such objects.

           Note however that while  a  window  exists  for  <u>$widget</u>  the  perl  object  is  maintained  (due  to
           "references"  in  perl/Tk  internals)  even  though  original  variables  may have gone out of scope.
           (Normally this is intuitive.)

       <b>Exists</b>(<u>$widget</u>)
           Returns 1 if there exists a window for <u>$widget</u>, 0 if no such window exists.

       <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>font</b>(<u>option</u>?, <u>arg,</u> <u>arg,</u> <u>...</u>?)
           Create and inspect fonts. See Tk::Font for further details.

       <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>fpixels</b>(<u>number</u>)
           Returns a floating-point value giving the number of pixels in <u>$widget</u> corresponding to  the  distance
           given  by  <u>number</u>.  <u>Number</u> may be specified in any of the forms acceptable to <b>Tk_GetScreenMM</b>, such as
           ``2.0c'' or ``1i''.  The return value may be fractional;  for an integer value, use <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>pixels</b>.

       <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>Getimage</b>(<u>name</u>)
           Given <u>name</u>, look for an image file with that base name and return a Tk::Image.  File  extensions  are
           tried  in  this  order: <u>xpm</u>, <u>gif</u>, <u>ppm</u>, <u>xbm</u> until a valid iamge is found.  If no image is found, try a
           builtin image with that name.

       <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>geometry</b>
           Returns the geometry for <u>$widget</u>, in the form <u>width</u><b>x</b><u>height</u><b>+</b><u>x</u><b>+</b><u>y</u>.  All dimensions are in pixels.

       <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>height</b>
           Returns a decimal string giving <u>$widget</u>'s height in pixels.  When  a  window  is  first  created  its
           height  will  be 1 pixel;  the height will eventually be changed by a geometry manager to fulfill the
           window's needs.  If you need the true height immediately after creating a widget,  invoke  <b>update</b>  to
           force  the  geometry  manager  to arrange it, or use <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>reqheight</b> to get the window's requested
           height instead of its actual height.

       <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>id</b>
           Returns a hexadecimal string giving a low-level platform-specific identifier for  $widget.   On  Unix
           platforms,  this  is  the  X  window  identifier.   Under  Windows, this is the Windows HWND.  On the
           Macintosh the value has no meaning outside Tk.

       <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>idletasks</b>
           One of two methods which are used to bring the application ``up to date'' by entering the event  loop
           repeated until all pending events (including idle callbacks) have been processed.

           If the <b>idletasks</b> method is specified, then no new events or errors are processed; only idle callbacks
           are  invoked.  This  causes operations that are normally deferred, such as display updates and window
           layout calculations, to be performed immediately.

           The <b>idletasks</b> command is useful in scripts where changes have been made to  the  application's  state
           and  you  want those changes to appear on the display immediately, rather than waiting for the script
           to complete. Most display updates are performed as idle callbacks, so <b>idletasks</b> will  cause  them  to
           run.  However,  there are some kinds of updates that only happen in response to events, such as those
           triggered by window size changes; these updates will not occur in <b>idletasks</b>.

       <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>interps</b>
           Returns a list whose members are the names of all Tcl interpreters (e.g. all  Tk-based  applications)
           currently registered for a particular display.  The return value refers to the display of <u>$widget</u>.

       <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>ismapped</b>
           Returns <b>1</b> if <u>$widget</u> is currently mapped, <b>0</b> otherwise.

       <u>$widget-</u>&gt;<b>lower</b>(?<u>belowThis</u>?)
           If  the  <u>belowThis</u> argument is omitted then the command lowers $widget so that it is below all of its
           siblings in the stacking order (it will be obscured by any siblings that  overlap  it  and  will  not
           obscure  any  siblings).  If <u>belowThis</u> is specified then it must be the path name of a window that is
           either a sibling of $widget or the descendant of a sibling  of  $widget.   In  this  case  the  <b>lower</b>
           command  will  insert  $widget  into  the  stacking  order  just  below <u>belowThis</u> (or the ancestor of
           <u>belowThis</u> that is a sibling of $widget); this could end up either raising or lowering $widget.

       <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>MapWindow</b>
           Cause <u>$widget</u> to be "mapped" i.e. made visible on the display.   May  confuse  the  geometry  manager
           (pack, grid, place, ...)  that thinks it is managing the widget.

       <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>manager</b>
           Returns  the  name  of  the geometry manager currently responsible for <u>$widget</u>, or an empty string if
           <u>$widget</u> isn't managed by any geometry manager.  The name is usually the name of the  method  for  the
           geometry  manager,  such  as <b>pack</b> or <b>place</b>.  If the geometry manager is a widget, such as canvases or
           text, the name is the widget's class command, such as <b>canvas</b>.

       <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>name</b>
           Returns <u>$widget</u>'s name (i.e. its name within its parent, as opposed to  its  full  path  name).   The
           command <u>$mainwin</u>-&gt;<b>name</b> will return the name of the application.

       <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>OnDestroy</b>(<u>callback</u>);
           OnDestroy  accepts a standard perl/Tk <u>callback</u>.  When the window associated with <u>$widget</u> is destroyed
           then the callback is invoked. Unlike <u>$widget-</u>&gt;bind('&lt;Destroy&gt;',...)  the widgets  methods  are  still
           available when <u>callback</u> is executed, so (for example) a <b>Text</b> widget can save its contents to a file.

           OnDestroy was required for new <b>after</b> mechanism.

       <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>parent</b>
           Returns <u>$widget</u>'s parent, or an empty string if <u>$widget</u> is the main window of the application.

       <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>PathName</b>
           Returns  the  Tk path name of <u>$widget</u>. This is the inverse of the "Widget" method. (This is an import
           from the C interface.)

       <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>pathname</b>(<u>id</u>)
           Returns an object whose X identifier is <u>id</u>.  The identifier is looked up on the display  of  <u>$widget</u>.
           <u>Id</u>  must  be a decimal, hexadecimal, or octal integer and must correspond to a window in the invoking
           application, or an error occurs which can be trapped with "eval { }" or  "Tk::catch  {  }".   If  the
           window  belongs  to the application, but is not an object (for example wrapper windows, HList header,
           etc.) then "undef" is returned.

       <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>pixels</b>(<u>number</u>)
           Returns the number of pixels in <u>$widget</u> corresponding to the distance given by <u>number</u>.  <u>Number</u> may be
           specified in any of the forms acceptable to <b>Tk_GetPixels</b>, such as ``2.0c'' or ``1i''.  The result  is
           rounded to the nearest integer value;  for a fractional result, use <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>fpixels</b>.

       <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>pointerx</b>
           If  the  mouse pointer is on the same screen as <u>$widget</u>, returns the pointer's x coordinate, measured
           in pixels in the screen's root window.  If a virtual root  window  is  in  use  on  the  screen,  the
           position  is  measured in the virtual root.  If the mouse pointer isn't on the same screen as <u>$widget</u>
           then -1 is returned.

       <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>pointerxy</b>
           If the mouse pointer is on the same screen as <u>$widget</u>, returns a list with two  elements,  which  are
           the  pointer's x and y coordinates measured in pixels in the screen's root window.  If a virtual root
           window is in use on the screen, the position is computed in the virtual root.  If the  mouse  pointer
           isn't on the same screen as <u>$widget</u> then both of the returned coordinates are -1.

       <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>pointery</b>
           If  the  mouse pointer is on the same screen as <u>$widget</u>, returns the pointer's y coordinate, measured
           in pixels in the screen's root window.  If a virtual root  window  is  in  use  on  the  screen,  the
           position  is  computed in the virtual root.  If the mouse pointer isn't on the same screen as <u>$widget</u>
           then -1 is returned.

       <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>raise</b>(?<u>aboveThis</u>?)
           If the <u>aboveThis</u> argument is omitted then the command raises $widget so that it is above all  of  its
           siblings in the stacking order (it will not be obscured by any siblings and will obscure any siblings
           that overlap it).  If <u>aboveThis</u> is specified then it must be the path name of a window that is either
           a  sibling of $widget or the descendant of a sibling of $widget.  In this case the <b>raise</b> command will
           insert $widget into the stacking order just above <u>aboveThis</u> (or the ancestor of <u>aboveThis</u> that  is  a
           sibling of $widget); this could end up either raising or lowering $widget.

       <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>reqheight</b>
           Returns  a  decimal  string  giving <u>$widget</u>'s requested height, in pixels.  This is the value used by
           <u>$widget</u>'s geometry manager to compute its geometry.

       <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>reqwidth</b>
           Returns a decimal string giving <u>$widget</u>'s requested width, in pixels.  This  is  the  value  used  by
           <u>$widget</u>'s geometry manager to compute its geometry.

       <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>rgb</b>(<u>color</u>)
           Returns  a  list containing three decimal values, which are the red, green, and blue intensities that
           correspond to <u>color</u> in the window given by <u>$widget</u>.  <u>Color</u> may be  specified  in  any  of  the  forms
           acceptable for a color option.

       <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>rootx</b>
           Returns a decimal string giving the x-coordinate, in the root window of the screen, of the upper-left
           corner of <u>$widget</u>'s border (or <u>$widget</u> if it has no border).

       <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>rooty</b>
           Returns a decimal string giving the y-coordinate, in the root window of the screen, of the upper-left
           corner of <u>$widget</u>'s border (or <u>$widget</u> if it has no border).

       <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>scaling</b>?(<u>number</u>)?
           Sets  and  queries  the  current  scaling  factor  used  by Tk to convert between physical units (for
           example, points, inches, or millimeters) and pixels.  The <u>number</u> argument is a floating point  number
           that  specifies  the  number  of  pixels  per  point  on $widget's display. If the <u>number</u> argument is
           omitted, the current value of the scaling factor is returned.

           A ``point'' is a unit of measurement equal to 1/72 inch.  A scaling factor of 1.0  corresponds  to  1
           pixel  per  point,  which is equivalent to a standard 72 dpi monitor.  A scaling factor of 1.25 would
           mean 1.25 pixels per point, which is the setting for a 90 dpi monitor; setting the scaling factor  to
           1.25  on  a  72  dpi  monitor would cause everything in the application to be displayed 1.25 times as
           large as normal.  The initial value for the scaling factor is set when the application starts,  based
           on  properties of the installed monitor (as reported via the window system), but it can be changed at
           any time.  Measurements made after the scaling factor is changed will use the new scaling factor, but
           it is undefined whether existing widgets will resize themselves dynamically to  accommodate  the  new
           scaling factor.

       <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>screen</b>
           Returns the name of the screen associated with <u>$widget</u>, in the form <u>displayName</u>.<u>screenIndex</u>.

       <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>screencells</b>
           Returns a decimal string giving the number of cells in the default color map for <u>$widget</u>'s screen.

       <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>screendepth</b>
           Returns  a decimal string giving the depth of the root window of <u>$widget</u>'s screen (number of bits per
           pixel).

       <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>screenheight</b>
           Returns a decimal string giving the height of <u>$widget</u>'s screen, in pixels.

       <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>screenmmheight</b>
           Returns a decimal string giving the height of <u>$widget</u>'s screen, in millimeters.

       <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>screenmmwidth</b>
           Returns a decimal string giving the width of <u>$widget</u>'s screen, in millimeters.

       <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>screenvisual</b>
           Returns one of the following strings to indicate the  default  visual  class  for  <u>$widget</u>'s  screen:
           <b>directcolor</b>, <b>grayscale</b>, <b>pseudocolor</b>, <b>staticcolor</b>, <b>staticgray</b>, or <b>truecolor</b>.

       <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>screenwidth</b>
           Returns a decimal string giving the width of <u>$widget</u>'s screen, in pixels.

       <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>server</b>
           Returns  a string containing information about the server for <u>$widget</u>'s display.  The exact format of
           this string may vary from platform to platform.  For X servers the string has the form ``<b>X</b><u>major</u><b>R</b><u>minor</u>
           <u>vendor</u> <u>vendorVersion</u>'' where <u>major</u> and <u>minor</u> are the version and revision  numbers  provided  by  the
           server  (e.g.,  <b>X11R5</b>),  <u>vendor</u>  is  the  name  of the vendor for the server, and <u>vendorRelease</u> is an
           integer release number provided by the server.

       <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>toplevel</b>
           Returns the reference of the top-level window containing <u>$widget</u>.

       <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>Unbusy</b>
           Restores widget state after a call to  <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>Busy</b>.

       <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>UnmapWindow</b>
           Cause <u>$widget</u> to be "unmapped" i.e. removed  from  the  display.   This  does  for  any  widget  what
           <u>$widget</u>-&gt;withdraw  does  for  toplevel  widgets. May confuse the geometry manager (pack, grid, place,
           ...)  that thinks it is managing the widget.

       <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>update</b>
           One of two methods which are used to bring the application ``up to date'' by entering the event  loop
           repeated until all pending events (including idle callbacks) have been processed.

           The  <b>update</b>  method  is useful in scripts where you are performing a long-running computation but you
           still want the application to respond to events such as user interactions; if you  occasionally  call
           <b>update</b> then user input will be processed during the next call to <b>update</b>.

       <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>useinputmethods</b>( ?<u>boolean</u>? )
           Sets  and queries the state of whether Tk should use XIM (X Input Methods) for filtering events.  The
           resulting state is returned.  XIM  is  used  in  some  locales  (ie:  Japanese,  Korean),  to  handle
           special  input  devices.  This feature is only significant  on  X.  If  XIM support is not available,
           this will always return 0.  If   the   boolean   argument   is   omitted,   the   current   state  is
           returned.  This is turned on by default for the main display.

       <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>viewable</b>
           Returns  1  if  <u>$widget</u>  and  all of its ancestors up through the nearest toplevel window are mapped.
           Returns 0 if any of these windows are not mapped.

       <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>visual</b>
           Returns one of the  following  strings  to  indicate  the  visual  class  for  <u>$widget</u>:  <b>directcolor</b>,
           <b>grayscale</b>, <b>pseudocolor</b>, <b>staticcolor</b>, <b>staticgray</b>, or <b>truecolor</b>.

       <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>visualid</b>
           Returns the X identifier for the visual for $widget.

       <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>visualsavailable</b>(?<b>includeids</b>?)
           Returns  a  list  whose  elements  describe the visuals available for <u>$widget</u>'s screen.  Each element
           consists of a visual class followed by an integer depth.  The class has the same form as returned  by
           <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>visual</b>.   The  depth  gives the number of bits per pixel in the visual.  In addition, if the
           <b>includeids</b> argument is provided, then the depth is followed by the X identifier for the visual.

       <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>vrootheight</b>
           Returns the height of the virtual root window associated with <u>$widget</u> if  there  is  one;   otherwise
           returns the height of <u>$widget</u>'s screen.

       <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>vrootwidth</b>
           Returns  the  width  of  the  virtual root window associated with <u>$widget</u> if there is one;  otherwise
           returns the width of <u>$widget</u>'s screen.

       <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>vrootx</b>
           Returns the x-offset of the virtual root window associated with <u>$widget</u>, relative to the root  window
           of  its  screen.   This  is  normally either zero or negative.  Returns 0 if there is no virtual root
           window for <u>$widget</u>.

       <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>vrooty</b>
           Returns the y-offset of the virtual root window associated with <u>$widget</u>, relative to the root  window
           of  its  screen.   This  is  normally either zero or negative.  Returns 0 if there is no virtual root
           window for <u>$widget</u>.

       <u>$widget-</u>&gt;<b>waitVariable</b>(\$<u>name</u>)
       <u>$widget-</u>&gt;<b>waitVisibility</b>
       <u>$widget-</u>&gt;<b>waitWindow</b>
           The <b>tk</b> <b>wait</b> methods wait for one of several things to happen, then  it  returns  without  taking  any
           other  actions.   The  return value is always an empty string.  <b>waitVariable</b> expects a reference to a
           perl variable and the command waits for that variable to be modified.  This form is typically used to
           wait for a user to finish interacting with a dialog which sets the variable as part (possibly  final)
           part  of  the  interaction.   <b>waitVisibility</b>  waits  for  a  change in <u>$widget</u>'s visibility state (as
           indicated by the arrival of a VisibilityNotify event).  This form is typically used  to  wait  for  a
           newly-created window to appear on the screen before taking some action.  <b>waitWindow</b> waits for <u>$widget</u>
           to  be destroyed.  This form is typically used to wait for a user to finish interacting with a dialog
           box before using the result of that interaction.  Note that creating and destroying the  window  each
           time a dialog is required makes code modular but imposes overhead which can be avoided by <b>withdrawing</b>
           the window instead and using <b>waitVisibility</b>.

           While the <b>tk</b> <b>wait</b> methods are waiting they processes events in the normal fashion, so the application
           will  continue to respond to user interactions.  If an event handler invokes <b>tkwait</b> again, the nested
           call to <b>tkwait</b> must complete before the outer call can complete.

       <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>Walk</b>(<u>proc</u>?, <u>arg,</u> <u>...</u>?)
           Traverse a widget hierarchy starting at <u>$widget</u> while executing the subroutine <u>proc</u> to every  visited
           widget. The arguments <u>arg,</u> <u>...</u>  are supplied to the subroutine.

       <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>Widget</b>(<u>pathname</u>)
           Returns the widget reference for the given Tk path name, or "undef" if the path name does not match a
           Tk widget. This is the inverse of the "PathName" method. (This is an import from the C interface.)

       <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>width</b>
           Returns  a decimal string giving <u>$widget</u>'s width in pixels.  When a window is first created its width
           will be 1 pixel;  the width will eventually be changed by a geometry manager to fulfill the  window's
           needs.   If  you  need the true width immediately after creating a widget, invoke <b>update</b> to force the
           geometry manager to arrange it, or use <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>reqwidth</b> to get the window's requested width  instead
           of its actual width.

       <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>windowingsystem</b>
           Returns  the current Tk windowing system, one of <b>x11</b> (X11-based), <b>win32</b> (MS Windows), <b>classic</b> (Mac OS
           Classic), or <b>aqua</b> (Mac OS  X Aqua).

       <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>x</b>
           Returns a decimal string giving the x-coordinate, in <u>$widget</u>'s parent, of the  upper-left  corner  of
           <u>$widget</u>'s border (or <u>$widget</u> if it has no border).

       <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>y</b>
           Returns  a  decimal  string giving the y-coordinate, in <u>$widget</u>'s parent, of the upper-left corner of
           <u>$widget</u>'s border (or <u>$widget</u> if it has no border).
