       htext - Create and manipulate hypertext widgets

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>htext</b> <u>pathName</u> ?<u>option</u> <u>value</u>?...
_________________________________________________________________

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>htext</b> command creates a new window (given by the <u>pathName</u> argument) and makes it into a <b>htext</b> widget.
       Additional  options,  described  above, may be specified on the command line or in the option database to
       configure aspects of the widget such as its color and font.  At the time this command is  invoked,  there
       must  not exist a window named <u>pathName</u>, but <u>pathName</u>'s parent must exist.  The <b>htext</b> command returns its
       <u>pathName</u>.

       The <b>htext</b> widget is hybrid of a non-editable text widget and a geometry manager (e.g.  the  packer).   It
       displays  text  (optionally  read  from  file)  in a window.  Text can be scrolled either horizontally or
       vertically using the <b>htext</b> window as a viewport.  In addition, Tcl commands can be embedded into the text
       which are evaluated as the text is parsed.  Text between special double characters (percent  signs  "%%")
       is immediately passed to the Tcl interpreter for evaluation.

       Furthermore,  any widget or widget hierarchy can be packed in-line and made to appear on the current line
       of the text.  Widgets are packed using the <b>htext</b> <b>append</b> command.  All widgets must  be  children  of  the
       <b>htext</b>  window and must already exist before packing.  Once a widget has been packed it cannot be moved to
       a different position within the text.  Widgets can be resized but they will remain at the  same  position
       within the text.

       Before  a  file  or  text  string  is  parsed  by the <b>htext</b> widget, all the widget's current children are
       destroyed.  You can reload files or text without worrying about unmapping or destroying each child window
       beforehand.

       Setting the either the <b>-filename</b> or <b>-text</b> configuration option will adjust the value of  the  other.   If
       both options are set, the file takes precedence.  When a new file is read using the <b>-filename</b> option, the
       value  of  the  <b>-text</b>  option  is reset to the empty string.  Likewise, when the <b>-text</b> option is set, the
       string representing the <b>-filename</b> option is cleared.

</pre><h4><b>FILE</b> <b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
       The format of <b>htext</b> text file is typically ASCII text.  Text enclosed by special  double  characters  (by
       default,  percent signs '%%') is interpreted and executed as Tcl commands.  The special character  may be
       specified by the <b>-specialchar</b> option.  In the following example of a <b>htext</b>  file,   a  button  widget  is
       appended to the text between  the words "<b>a</b>" and "<b>which</b>".  The <u>pathName</u> of the <b>htext</b> widget is "<b>.ht</b>".

              <b>This</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>displayed</b> <b>as</b> <b>normal</b> <b>text.</b>
              <b>But</b> <b>this</b> <b>will</b> <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>%%</b>
                <b>button</b> <b>.ht.button</b> <b>-text</b> <b>"button"</b> <b>-fg</b> <b>red</b>
                <b>.ht</b> <b>append</b> <b>.ht.button</b>
              <b>%%</b> <b>which</b> <b>can</b> <b>invoke</b> <b>a</b> <b>Tcl</b> <b>command.</b>

</pre><h4><b>INDICES</b></h4><pre>
       Some  of the widget operations (<b>selection</b>, gotoline, <b>search</b>, etc.) take one or more indices as arguments.
       An index is a string used to indicate a particular place within the text, such  as  the  first  and  last
       characters in a range to be selected.

       An index must have one of the following forms:

       <u>line</u><b>.</b><u>char</u>   Indicates  <u>char</u>'th  character  on line <u>line</u>.  Both lines and characters are number from 0, so
                   "0.0" is the first beginning of the  text.   <u>Char</u>  may  be  undesignated.   In  this  case  a
                   character position of 0 is assumed.

       <b>@</b><u>x</u><b>,</b><u>y</u>        Indicates  the  character  that  covers the pixel whose x and y coordinates within the text's
                   window are <u>x</u> and <u>y</u>.

       <b>end</b>         Indicates the end of the text.

       <b>anchor</b>      Indicates the anchor point for the selection, which is set with the <b>selection</b> operation.

       <b>sel.first</b>   Indicates the first character in the selection.  It is an error  to  use  this  form  if  the
                   selection isn't in the entry window.

       <b>sel.last</b>    Indicates the character just after the last one in the selection.  It is an error to use this 2
                   form if the selection isn't in the entry window.

</pre><h4><b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following global Tcl variables are maintained when an <b>htext</b> file is parsed.

       <b>htext(widget)</b>
              is the pathname of the <b>htext</b> widget.

       <b>htext(file)</b>
              is  the  name  of the file the <b>htext</b> widget is currently parsing.  It is the empty string when the
              <b>-text</b> option is used.

       <b>htext(line)</b>
              is the current line number in the text.

       This information might be used to construct hyper links between different files and/or lines.

</pre><h4><b>SYNTAX</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>htext</b> command creates a new Tcl command whose name is <u>pathName</u>.  This command may be used  to  invoke
       various operations on the widget.  It has the following general form: <u>pathName</u> <u>oper</u> ?<u>args</u>?  <u>Oper</u> and <u>args</u>
       determine the exact behavior of the command.

</pre><h4><b>OPERATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following operations are available for <b>htext</b> widgets:

       <u>pathName</u> <b>append</b> <u>window</u> ?<u>option</u> <u>value</u>?...
              Embeds  the  widget  <u>window</u>  into  the  htext  widget.  <u>Window</u> is the pathname of the widget to be
              embedded which must be a child of <u>pathName</u>.  <u>Window</u> will be positioned in the htext widget at  the
              current  location  of  the  text.  If  <u>option</u>  and <u>value</u> pairs are present, they configure various
              aspects how <u>window</u> appears in <u>pathName</u>.  The following options are available.

              <b>-anchor</b> <u>anchorPos</u>
                     Specifies how <u>window</u> will be arranged if there is any extra space in the cavity surrounding
                     the window.  For example, if <u>anchorPos</u> is <b>center</b> then the window is centered in the cavity;
                     if <u>anchorPos</u> is <b>w</b> then the window will be drawn such it touches the leftmost  edge  of  the
                     cavity. The default is <b>center</b>.

              <b>-fill</b> <u>style</u>
                     Specifies  how  the  <u>window</u>  should  be  stretched  to occupy the extra space in the cavity
                     surrounding it (if any exists).  <u>Style</u> is <b>none</b>, <b>x</b>, <b>y</b>, <b>both</b>.  If <u>style</u> is <b>x</b>,  the  width  of
                     <u>window</u> is expanded to fill the cavity.  If <u>style</u> is <b>y</b>, the height is expanded.  The default
                     is <b>none</b>.

              <b>-height</b> <u>pixels</u>
                     Sets  the  height  of  the cavity surrounding <u>window</u>.  If <u>pixels</u> is zero, the height of the
                     cavity will be the same as the requested height of <u>window</u>.  If  <u>pixels</u>  is  less  than  the
                     requested height of <u>window</u>, <u>window</u> will be reduced to fit the cavity.  The default is <b>0</b>.

              <b>-ipadx</b> <u>pad</u>
                     Sets  the amount of internal padding to be added to the width <u>window</u>.  <u>Pad</u> can be a list of
                     one or two numbers.  If <u>pad</u> has two elements, the left side of <u>window</u> is  extended  by  the
                     first  value  and  the  right side by the second value.  If <u>pad</u> is just one value, both the
                     left and right sides are padded by evenly by the value.  The default is <b>0</b>.

              <b>-ipady</b> <u>pad</u>
                     Sets an amount of internal padding to be added to the height of <u>window</u>.  <u>Pad</u> can be a  list
                     of  one  or two numbers.  If <u>pad</u> has two elements, the top of <u>window</u> is padded by the first
                     value and the bottom by the second value.  If <u>pad</u> is just one  number,  both  the  top  and
                     bottom are padded evenly by the value.  The default is <b>0</b>.

              <b>-justify</b> <u>justify</u>
                     Justifies  <u>window</u>  vertically  within  the  cavity containing it in relation to the line of
                     text. <u>Justify</u> is <b>top</b>, <b>bottom</b>, or  <b>center</b>.  If <u>justify</u> is  <b>center</b>  the  widget  is  centered
                     along the baseline of the line of text.  The default is <b>center</b>.

              <b>-padx</b> <u>pad</u>
                     Sets  the  padding  on the left and right sides of <u>window</u>.  <u>Pad</u> can be a list of one or two
                     numbers.  If <u>pad</u> has two elements, the left side of <u>window</u> is padded by the first value and
                     the right side by the second value.  If <u>pad</u> has just one value, both  the  left  and  right
                     sides are padded evenly by the value.  The default is <b>0</b>.

              <b>-pady</b> <u>pad</u>
                     Sets  the padding above and below <u>window</u>.  <u>Pad</u> can be a list of one or two numbers.  If <u>pad</u>
                     has two elements, the area above <u>window</u> is padded by the first value and the area below  by
                     the  second  value.   If  <u>pad</u> is just one number, both the top and bottom are padded by the
                     value.  The default is <b>0</b>.

              <b>-relheight</b> <u>value</u>
                     Specifies the height of the cavity containing <u>window</u> relative to the  height  of  <u>pathName</u>.
                     <u>Value</u>  is  real  number  indicating  the ratio of the height of the cavity to the height of
                     <u>pathName</u>.  As the height of <u>pathName</u> changes, so will the height of <u>window</u>.   If  <u>value</u>  is
                     0.0 or less, the height of the cavity is the requested height <u>window</u>.  The default is <b>0.0</b>.

              <b>-relwidth</b> <u>value</u>
                     Specifies  the  width  of  the  cavity containing <u>window</u> relative to the width of <u>pathName</u>.
                     <u>Value</u> is real number indicating the ratio of the width  of  the  cavity  to  the  width  of
                     IpathName.   As  the height of <u>pathName</u> changes, so will the height of <u>window</u>.  If <u>value</u> is
                     0.0 or less, the width of the cavity is the requested width of  <u>window</u>.    The  default  is
                     <b>0.0</b>.

              <b>-width</b> <u>value</u>
                     Species  the  width  of  the  cavity  containing the child window.  <u>Value</u> must be in a form
                     accepted by <b>Tk_GetPixels</b>.  If <u>value</u> is greater than zero, the cavity  is  resized  to  that
                     width.   If  the requested window width is greater than the cavity's width, the window will
                     be reduced to fit the cavity.  By default, the cavity  is  requested  width  of  the  child
                     window.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>configure</b> ?<u>window</u>? ?<u>option</u>? ?<u>value</u> <u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>...</u>?
              Queries  or  modifies the configuration options of the text widget or one of its embedded widgets.
              If no <u>window</u> argument is present, the htext widget itself is configured.  Otherwise <u>window</u> is  the
              pathname  of  a  widget  already  embedded into the htext widget.  Then this command configure the
              options for the embedded widget.

       If <u>option</u> isn't specified, a list describing all of  the  current  options  for  <u>pathName</u>  or  <u>window</u>  is
       returned.   If  <u>option</u> is specified, but not <u>value</u>, then a list describing the option <u>option</u> is returned.
       If one or more <u>option</u> and <u>value</u> pairs are specified, then for each pair, the  htext  or  embedded  window
       option <u>option</u> is set to <u>value</u>.

       The following options are valid for the htext widget.

              <b>-background</b> <u>color</u>
                     Sets the background of the htext widget to <u>color</u>.  This default is <b>white</b>.

              <b>-cursor</b> <u>cursor</u>
                     Specifies the cursor for the htext widget.  The default cursor is <b>pencil</b>.

              <b>-filename</b> <u>fileName</u>
                     Specifies  a  <b>htext</b>  file to be displayed in the window.  If the value is the empty string,
                     the <b>-text</b> option is used instead.  See the section <b>FILE</b> <b>FORMAT</b> for  a  description  of  the
                     <b>htext</b> file format.

              <b>-font</b> <u>fontName</u>
                     Sets the font of the text in the htext widget to <u>fontName</u>. The default is <b>*-Helvetica-Bold-</b>
                     <b>R-Normal-*-12-120-*</b>.

              <b>-foreground</b> <u>color</u>
                     Sets  the  foreground  of  the htext widget to <u>color</u>.  This is the color of the text.  This
                     default is <b>black</b>.

              <b>-height</b> <u>pixels</u>
                     Specifies the height of the htext widget window.

              <b>-linespacing</b> <u>pixels</u>
                     Specifies the spacing between each line of text.  The value must be in a form  accepted  by
                     <b>Tk_GetPixels</b>. The default value is 1 pixel.

              <b>-specialchar</b> <u>number</u>
                     Specifies  the ASCII value of the special double character delimiters.  In <b>htext</b> files, the
                     text between these special characters is evaluated as a block of Tcl commands. The  default
                     special character is the <b>0x25</b>  (percent sign).

              <b>-text</b> <u>text</u>
                     Specifies  the  text  to be displayed in the htext widget.  <u>Text</u> can be any valid string of
                     characters. See <b>FILE</b> <b>FORMAT</b> for a description.

              <b>-xscrollcommand</b> <u>string</u>
                     Specifies the prefix for a command used to communicate with  horizontal  scrollbars.   When
                     the  view in the htext widget's window changes (or whenever anything else occurs that could
                     change the display in a scrollbar, such as a change in  the  total  size  of  the  widget's
                     contents),  the widget invoke <u>string</u> concatenated by two numbers.  Each of the numbers is a
                     fraction between 0 and 1, which indicates a position in the document.  If  this  option  is
                     not specified, then no command will be executed.

              <b>-yscrollcommand</b> <u>string</u>
                     Specifies  the prefix for a command used to communicate with vertical scrollbars.  When the
                     view in the htext widget's window changes (or whenever  anything  else  occurs  that  could
                     change  the  display  in  a  scrollbar,  such as a change in the total size of the widget's
                     contents), the widget invoke <u>string</u> concatenated by two numbers.  Each of the numbers is  a
                     fraction  between  0  and 1, which indicates a position in the document.  If this option is
                     not specified, then no command will be executed.

              <b>-width</b> <u>pixels</u>
                     Specifies the desired width of the viewport window.  If the <u>pixels</u> is less  than  one,  the
                     window will grow to accommodate the widest line of text.

              <b>-xscrollunits</b> <u>pixels</u>
                     Specifies the horizontal scrolling distance. The default is 10 pixels.

              <b>-yscrollunits</b> <u>pixels</u>
                     Specifies the vertical scrolling distance. The default is 10 pixels.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>gotoline</b> ?<u>index</u>?
              Sets  the top line of the text to <u>index</u>. <u>Index</u> must be a valid text index (the character offset is
              ignored).  If an <u>index</u> isn't provided, the current line number is returned.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>scan</b> <b>mark</b> <u>position</u>
              Records <u>position</u> and the current view in the text window;  used in  conjunction  with  later  <b>scan</b>
              <b>dragto</b>  commands.   <u>Position</u>  must  be  in  the  form "<u>@x,y</u>, where <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> are window coordinates.
              Typically this command is associated with a mouse button press in the widget.  It returns an empty
              string.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>scan</b> <b>dragto</b> <u>position</u>
              Computes the difference between <u>position</u> and the position registered in the last <b>scan</b> <b>mark</b> command
              for the widget.  The view is then adjusted up or down by 10 times the difference  in  coordinates.
              This  command  is can be associated with mouse motion events to produce the effect of dragging the
              text at high speed through the window.  <u>Position</u> must be in the form "<u>@x,y</u>,  where  <u>x</u>  and  <u>y</u>  are
              window coordinates. The command returns an empty string.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>search</b> <u>pattern</u> ?<u>from</u>? ?<u>to</u>?
              Returns  the  number  of  the  next  line  matching  <u>pattern</u>.  <u>Pattern</u> is a string which obeys the
              matching rules of <b>Tcl_StringMatch</b>.  <u>From</u> and <u>to</u> are text line numbers (inclusive) which bound  the
              search.  If no match for <u>pattern</u> can be found, <b>-1</b> is returned.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>xview</b> ?<u>position</u>?
              Moves  the  viewport  horizontally  to the new text x-coordinate position.  <u>Position</u> is the offset
              from the left side of the text to the  current  position  and  must  be  in  a  form  accepted  by
              <b>Tk_GetPixels</b>. If <u>position</u> is not present, the current text position is returned.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>yview</b> ?<u>position</u>?
              Moves  the viewport vertically to the new text y-coordinate position.  <u>Position</u> is the offset from
              the top of the text to the current position and must be in a form  accepted  by  <b>Tk_GetPixels</b>.  If
              <u>position</u> is not present, the current text position is returned.
