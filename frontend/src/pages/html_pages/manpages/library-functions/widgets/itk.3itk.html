       itk - framework for building mega-widgets in Tcl/Tk
_________________________________________________________________

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Mega-widgets  are  high-level  widgets  that are constructed using Tk widgets as component parts, usually
       without any C code.  A fileselectionbox, for example, may have a few listboxes, some  entry  widgets  and
       some  control  buttons.   These individual widgets are put together in a way that makes them act like one
       big widget.  A fileselectionbox mega-widget can be created with a command like:
              fileselectionbox .fsb -background blue -foreground white
       Once it has been created, it can be reconfigured with a command like:
              .fsb configure -background green -foreground black
       and all of its internal components will change color.  Each mega-widget has a set of methods that can  be
       used  to  manipulate  it.  For example, the current selection can be queried from a fileselectionbox like
       this:
              set fileName [.fsb get]
       In effect, a mega-widget looks and acts  exactly  like  a  Tk  widget,  but  is  considerably  easier  to
       implement.

       <b>[incr</b> <b>Tk]</b>  is  a framework for building mega-widgets.  It uses <b>[incr</b> <b>Tcl]</b> to support the object paradigm,
       and adds base classes which provide default widget behaviors.

       All <b>[incr</b> <b>Tk]</b> widgets are derived from the <b>Archetype</b> base class.  This class manages  internal  component
       widgets, and provides methods like "configure" and "cget" to access configuration options.

       The  <b>Widget</b>  base class inherits everything from <b>Archetype</b>, and adds a Tk frame which acts as a container
       for the mega-widget.  It is used to build mega-widgets that sit inside of  other  frames  and  toplevels.
       Derived  classes  create  other  internal  components  and pack them into the "hull" frame created by the
       <b>Widget</b> base class.

       The <b>Toplevel</b> base class inherits everything from <b>Archetype</b>, but adds  a  Tk  toplevel  which  acts  as  a
       container  for  the mega-widget.  It is used to build mega-widgets, such as dialog boxes, that have their
       own toplevel window.  Derived classes create other internal components and  pack  them  into  the  "hull"
       toplevel created by the <b>Toplevel</b> base class.

</pre><h4><b>[incr</b> <b>Widgets]</b> <b>LIBRARY</b></h4><pre>
       <b>[incr</b> <b>Widgets]</b>  is a mega-widget library built using <b>[incr</b> <b>Tk]</b>.  It can be used right out of the box, and
       contains more than 30 different widget classes, including:

       -      fileselectiondialog

       -      tabnotebook

       -      panedwindow

       -      combobox

       -      optionmenu

       -      scrolledlistbox

       -      scrolledframe

       -      messagedialog

       -      and many others...

       The <b>catalog</b> demo in the "iwidgets/demos" directory shows all of the available widgets  in  action.   Each
       widget class has its own man page describing the features available.
