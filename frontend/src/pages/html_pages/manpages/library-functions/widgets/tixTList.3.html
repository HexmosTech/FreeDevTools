       tixTList - Create and manipulate Tix Tabular List widgets

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>tixTList</b>          <u>pathName</u>         ?<u>options</u>?          -background    -borderWidth   -cursor   -foreground
       -font     -height   -highlightColor -highlightThickness   -relief   -selectBackground   -selectForeground
       -xScrollCommand     -yScrollCommand     -width

</pre><h4><b>WIDGET-SPECIFIC</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       [<b>-browsecmd</b>  <u>browsecmd</u>]  Specifies a TCL command to be executed when the user browses through the entries
       in the TList widget.  [<b>-command</b> <u>command</u>] Specifies the TCL command to be executed when the user invokes a
       list entry in the TList widget. Normally the user invokes a list entry by double-clicking it or  pressing
       the  Return  key.   [<b>-foreground</b> <u>foreground</u>] Specifies the default foreground color for the list entries.
       [<b>-height</b>  <u>height</u>]  Specifies  the  desired   height   for   the   window   in   number   of   characters.
       [<b>-itemtype</b>  <u>itemType</u>] Specifies the default type of display item for this TList widget. When you call the
       <b>insert</b> widget commands, display items of this type will  be  created  if  the  <b>-itemtype</b>  option  is  not
       specified  .   [<b>-orient</b>  <u>orient</u>]  Specifies  the  order  of  tabularizing  the  list entries. When set to
       "<b>vertical</b>", the entries are arranged in a column, from top to bottom. If the entries cannot be  contained
       in one column, the remaining entries will go to the next column, and so on. When set to "<b>horizontal</b>", the
       entries  are  arranged  in  a row, from left to right. If the entries cannot be contained in one row, the
       remaining entries will go to the next row, and so on.  [<b>-padx</b> <u>padX</u>] The default  horizontal  padding  for
       list     entries.     [<b>-padx</b>    <u>padY</u>]    The    default    vertical    padding    for    list    entries.
       [<b>-selectbackground</b> <u>selectBackground</u>] Specifies the  background  color  for  the  selected  list  entries.
       [<b>-selectborderwidth</b>  <u>selectBorderWidth</u>]  Specifies  a  non-negative value indicating the width of the 3-D
       border to draw around selected items.  The value may have any of the forms  acceptable  to  <b>Tk_GetPixels</b>.
       [<b>-selectforeground</b>  <u>selectForeground</u>]  Specifies  the  foreground  color  for  the selected list entries.
       [<b>-selectmode</b> <u>selectMode</u>] Specifies one of several styles for manipulating the selection.   The  value  of
       the option may be arbitrary, but the default bindings expect it to be either <b>single</b>, <b>browse</b>, <b>multiple</b>, or
       <b>extended</b>;  the  default value is <b>single</b>.  [<b>-sizecmd</b> <u>sizeCmd</u>] Specifies a TCL script to be called whenever
       the TList widget changes its size. This command can be useful to implement "user scroll bars when needed"
       features.  [<b>-state</b> <u>state</u>] Specifies whether the TList command should react to user actions. When  set  to
       "<b>normal</b>",  the TList reacts to user actions in the normal way. When set to "<b>disabled</b>", the TList can only
       be scrolled, but its entries cannot be selected or activated.  [<b>-width</b> <u>width</u>] Specifies the desired width
       for the window in characters.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>tixTList</b> command creates a new window (given by the <u>pathName</u> argument) and  makes  it  into  a  TList
       widget.   Additional  options,  described  above,  may  be specified on the command line or in the option
       database to configure aspects of the TList widget such as its cursor and relief.

       The TList widget can be used to display data in a tabular format. The list entries of a TList widget  are
       similar  to  the  entries  in  the  Tk  listbox widget. The main differences are (1) the TList widget can
       display the list entries in a two dimensional format and (2) you can use  graphical  images  as  well  as
       multiple colors and fonts for the list entries.

       Each list entry is identified by an <b>index</b>, which can be in the following forms:

              <u>number</u> An  integer  that  indicates  the  position  of  the  entry  in the list. 0 means the first
                     position, 1 means the second position, and so on.

              <b>end</b>    Indicates the end of the listbox. For some commands this means just after the  last  entry;
                     for other commands it means the last entry.

              <b>@</b><u>x</u>,<u>y</u>   Indicates  the element that covers the point in the listbox window specified by x and y (in
                     pixel coordinates). If no element covers that point, then the closest element to that point
                     is used.

</pre><h4><b>DISPLAY</b> <b>ITEMS</b></h4><pre>
       Each list entry in an TList widget is associated with a <b>display</b> <b>item</b>.  The display item  determines  what
       visual  information  should  be displayed for this list entry. Please see the <b>tixDisplayStyle</b> manual page
       for a list of all display items.

       When a list entry is created by the <b>insert</b> command, the type of its display item  is  determined  by  the
       <b>-itemtype</b>  option  passed  to  these  commands.  If  the  <b>-itemtype</b>  is omitted, then by default the type
       specified by this TList widget's <b>-itemtype</b> option is used.

</pre><h4><b>WIDGET</b> <b>COMMAND</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>tixTList</b> command creates a new Tcl command whose name is the same as  the  path  name  of  the  TList
       widget's  window.   This  command  may  be  used  to invoke various operations on the widget.  It has the
       following general form:
              <u>pathName</u> <u>option</u> ?<u>arg</u> <u>arg</u> <u>...</u>?
       <u>PathName</u> is the name of the command, which is the same as the TList widget's path name.  <u>Option</u>  and  the
       <u>arg</u>s determine the exact behavior of the command.  The following commands are possible for TList widgets:

       <u>pathName</u> <b>anchor</b> <b>set</b> <u>index</u>
              Sets the anchor to the list entry identified by <u>index</u>. The anchor is the end of the selection that
              is fixed while dragging out a selection with the mouse.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>anchor</b> <b>clear</b>
              Removes  the  anchor, if any, from this TList widget. This only removes the surrounding highlights
              of the anchor entry and does not affect its selection status.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>cget</b> <u>option</u>
              Returns the current value of the configuration option given by <u>option</u>. <u>Option</u> may have any of  the
              values accepted by the <b>tixTList</b> command.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>configure</b> ?<u>option</u>? <u>?value</u> <u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>...</u>?
              Query  or  modify  the  configuration options of the widget.  If no <u>option</u> is specified, returns a
              list describing all of the available options for <u>pathName</u> (see <b>Tk_ConfigureInfo</b> for information on
              the format of this list). If <u>option</u> is specified with no <u>value</u>, then the command  returns  a  list
              describing  the  one named option (this list will be identical to the corresponding sublist of the
              value returned if no <u>option</u> is specified).  If one or more <u>option-value</u> pairs are specified,  then
              the  command  modifies  the  given  widget  option(s) to have the given value(s); in this case the
              command returns an empty string.  <u>Option</u> may have any of  the  values  accepted  by  the  <b>tixTList</b>
              command.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>delete</b> <u>from</u> ?<u>to</u>?
              Deletes  one or more list entries between the two entries specified by the indices <u>from</u> and <u>to</u>. If
              <u>to</u> is not specified, deletes the single entry specified by <u>from</u>.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>dragsite</b> <b>set</b> <u>index</u>
              Sets the dragsite to the list entry identified by <u>index</u>. The dragsite  is  used  to  indicate  the
              source  of  a drag-and-drop action. Currently drag-and-drop functionality has not been implemented
              in Tix yet.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>dragsite</b> <b>clear</b>
              Remove the dragsite, if any, from the  this  TList  widget.  This  only  removes  the  surrounding
              highlights of the dragsite entry and does not affect its selection status.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>dropsite</b> <b>set</b> <u>index</u>
              Sets  the  dropsite  to  the  list entry identified by <u>index</u>. The dropsite is used to indicate the
              target of a grag-and-drop action. Currently drag-and-drop functionality has not  been  implemented
              in Tix yet.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>dropsite</b> <b>clear</b>
              Remove  the  dropsite,  if  any,  from  the  this  TList widget. This only removes the surrounding
              highlights of the dropsite entry and does not affect its selection status.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>entrycget</b> <u>index</u> <u>option</u>
              Returns the current value of the configuration option given by <u>option</u> for the entry indentfied  by
              <u>index</u>. <u>Option</u> may have any of the values accepted by the <b>insert</b> widget command.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>entryconfigure</b> <u>index</u> ?<u>option</u>? <u>?value</u> <u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>...</u>?
              Query  or  modify the configuration options of the list entry indentfied by <u>index</u>. If no <u>option</u> is
              specified, returns a list describing all of the available options for <u>index</u> (see  <b>Tk_ConfigureInfo</b>
              for  information  on  the  format  of  this  list). If <u>option</u> is specified with no <u>value</u>, then the
              command returns a list describing the one named  option  (this  list  will  be  identical  to  the
              corresponding  sublist  of  the  value  returned  if  no  <u>option</u>  is  specified).  If  one or more
              <u>option-value</u> pairs are specified, then the command modifies the given option(s) to have the  given
              value(s);  in  this  case  the command returns an empty string.  <u>Option</u> may have any of the values
              accepted by the <b>insert</b> widget command. The exact set of  options  depends  on  the  value  of  the
              <b>-itemtype</b> option passed to the the <b>insert</b> widget command when this list entry is created.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>insert</b> <u>index</u> ?<u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>...</u>?
              Creates  a  new list entry at the position indicated by <u>index</u>. The following configuration options
              can be given to configure the list entry:

              <b>-itemtype</b> <u>type</u>
                     Specifies the type of display item to be display for the new list entry.  <u>type</u>  must  be  a
                     valid  display  item type. Currently the available display item types are <b>image</b>, <b>imagetext</b>,
                     <b>text</b>, and <b>window</b>. If this option is not specified, then by default the  type  specified  by
                     this TList widget's <b>-itemtype</b> option is used.

              <b>-state</b> Specifies whether this entry can be selected or invoked by the user.  Must be either <b>normal</b>
                     or <b>disabled</b>.
       The  <b>insert</b>  widget  command  accepts  additional  configuration  options  to  configure the display item
       associated with this list entry. The set of additional configuration options depends on the type  of  the
       display  item given by the <b>-itemtype</b> option. Please see the <b>tixDisplayStyle</b> manual page for a list of the
       configuration options for each of the display item types.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>info</b> <u>option</u> <u>arg</u> <u>...</u>
              Query information about the TList widget. <u>option</u> can be one of the following:

              <u>pathName</u> <b>info</b> <b>anchor</b> <u>index</u>
                     ; Returns the index of the current anchor, if any, of the TList widget. If  the  anchor  is
                     not set, returns the empty string.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>info</b> <b>dragsite</b> <u>index</u>
                     Returns  the index of the current dragsite, if any, of the TList widget. If the dragsite is
                     not set, returns the empty string.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>info</b> <b>dropsite</b> <u>index</u>
                     Returns the index of the current dropsite, if any, of the TList widget. If the dropsite  is
                     not set, returns the empty string.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>info</b> <b>selection</b>
                     Returns a list of selected elements in the TList widget. If no entries are selectd, returns
                     an empty string.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>nearest</b> <u>x</u> <u>y</u>
              Given  an  (x,y)  coordinate  within the TList window, this command returns the index of the TList
              element nearest to that coordinate.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>see</b> <u>index</u>
              Adjust the view in the TList so that the entry given by <u>index</u> is visible. If the entry is  already
              visible then the command has no effect; if the entry is near one edge of the window then the TList
              scrolls  to  bring the element into view at the edge; otherwise the TList widget scrolls to center
              the entry.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>selection</b> <u>option</u> <u>arg</u> <u>...</u>
              This command is used to adjust the  selection  within  a  TList  widget.  It  has  several  forms,
              depending on <u>option</u>:

              <u>pathName</u> <b>selection</b> <b>clear</b> ?<u>from</u>? ?<u>to</u>?
                     When  no  extra  arguments  are  given,  deselects  all of the list entrie(s) in this TList
                     widget. When only <u>from</u> is given, only the list entry identified by <u>from</u> is deselected. When
                     both <u>from</u> and <u>to</u> are given, deselects all of the list entrie(s) between  between  <u>from</u>  and
                     <u>to</u>, inclusive, without affecting the selection state of entries outside that range.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>selection</b> <b>includes</b> <u>index</u>
                     Returns 1 if the list entry indicated by <u>index</u> is currently selected; returns 0 otherwise.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>selection</b> <b>set</b> <u>from</u> ?<u>to</u>?
                     Selects all of the list entrie(s) between between <u>from</u> and <u>to</u>, inclusive, without affecting
                     the  selection  state of entries outside that range. When only <u>from</u> is given, only the list
                     entry identified by <u>from</u> is selected.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>xview</b> <u>args</u>
              This command is used to query and change  the  horizontal  position  of  the  information  in  the
              widget's window. It can take any of the following forms:

              <u>pathName</u> <b>xview</b>
                     Returns  a  list containing two elements.  Each element is a real fraction between 0 and 1;
                     together they describe the horizontal span that is visible in the window.  For example,  if
                     the  first element is .2 and the second element is .6, 20% of the TList entry is off-screen
                     to the left, the middle 40% is visible in the window, and 40% of the entry is off-screen to
                     the right. These are the same values passed to scrollbars via the <b>-xscrollcommand</b> option.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>xview</b> <u>index</u>
                     Adjusts the view in the window so that the list entry identified by <u>index</u> is aligned to the
                     left edge of the window.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>xview</b> <b>moveto</b> <u>fraction</u>
                     Adjusts the view in the window so that <u>fraction</u> of the total width of  the  TList  is  off-
                     screen to the left. <u>fraction</u> must be a fraction between 0 and 1.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>xview</b> <b>scroll</b> <u>number</u> <u>what</u>
                     This  command  shifts  the  view  in the window left or right according to <u>number</u> and <u>what</u>.
                     <u>Number</u> must be an integer.  <u>What</u> must be either <b>units</b> or <b>pages</b> or an abbreviation of one of
                     these. If <u>what</u> is <b>units</b>, the view adjusts left or right  by  <u>number</u>  character  units  (the
                     width  of  the  <b>0</b> character) on the display; if it is <b>pages</b> then the view adjusts by <u>number</u>
                     screenfuls. If <u>number</u> is negative then characters farther to the left become visible; if it
                     is positive then characters farther to the right become visible.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>yview</b> <u>?args</u>?
              This command is used to query and change the vertical position of  the  entries  in  the  widget's
              window. It can take any of the following forms:

              <u>pathName</u> <b>yview</b>
                     Returns  a  list containing two elements, both of which are real fractions between 0 and 1.
                     The first element gives the position of the list element at the top of the window, relative
                     to the TList as a whole (0.5 means it is halfway through  the  TList,  for  example).   The
                     second  element gives the position of the list entry just after the last one in the window,
                     relative to the TList as a whole.  These are the same values passed to scrollbars  via  the
                     <b>-yscrollcommand</b> option.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>yview</b> <u>index</u>
                     Adjusts  the  view  in the window so that the list entry given by <u>index</u> is displayed at the
                     top of the window.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>yview</b> <b>moveto</b> <u>fraction</u>
                     Adjusts the view in the window so that the list entry given by <u>fraction</u> appears at the  top
                     of  the  window. <u>Fraction</u> is a fraction between 0 and 1; 0 indicates the first entry in the
                     TList, 0.33 indicates the entry one-third the way through the TList, and so on.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>yview</b> <b>scroll</b> <u>number</u> <u>what</u>
                     This command adjust the view in the window up or down according to <u>number</u> and <u>what</u>.  <u>Number</u>
                     must be an integer.  <u>What</u> must be either <b>units</b> or  <b>pages</b>.   If  <u>what</u>  is  <b>units</b>,  the  view
                     adjusts  up  or  down  by  <u>number</u>  lines;  if  it  is <b>pages</b> then the view adjusts by <u>number</u>
                     screenfuls.  If <u>number</u> is negative then earlier entries become visible; if it  is  positive
                     then later entries become visible.

</pre><h4><b>BINDINGS</b></h4><pre>
       [1]    If  the  <b>-selectmode</b> is "browse", when the user drags the mouse pointer over the list entries, the
              entry under the pointer will be highlighted and the <b>-browsecmd</b> procedure will be called  with  one
              parameter,  the  index  of the highlighted entry. Only one entry can be highlighted at a time. The
              <b>-command</b> procedure will be called when the user double-clicks on a list entry.

       [2]    If the <b>-selectmode</b> is "single", the entries will only be highlighted  by  mouse  &lt;ButtonRelease-1&gt;
              events.  When  a  new  list entry is highlighted, the <b>-browsecmd</b> procedure will be called with one
              parameter indicating the highlighted list entry. The <b>-command</b> procedure will be  called  when  the
              user double-clicks on a list entry.

       [3]    If the <b>-selectmode</b> is "multiple", when the user drags the mouse pointer over the list entries, all
              the  entries  under  the  pointer  will  be highlighted. However, only a contiguous region of list
              entries can be selected. When the highlighted area is changed, the <b>-browsecmd</b>  procedure  will  be
              called  with  an undefined parameter. It is the responsibility of the <b>-browsecmd</b> procedure to find
              out the exact highlighted selection in the TList. The <b>-command</b> procedure will be called  when  the
              user double-clicks on a list entry.

       [4]    If the <b>-selectmode</b> is "extended", when the user drags the mouse pointer over the list entries, all
              the  entries  under  the pointer will be highlighted. The user can also make disjointed selections
              using &lt;Control-ButtonPress-1&gt;. When the highlighted area is changed, the <b>-browsecmd</b> procedure will
              be called with an undefined parameter. It is the responsibility of  the  <b>-browsecmd</b>  procedure  to
              find  out the exact highlighted selection in the TList. The <b>-command</b> procedure will be called when
              the user double-clicks on a list entry.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       This example demonstrates how to use an TList to store a list of numbers:

       set image [tix getimage folder] set t [tixTList .t -orient vertical] $t insert  end  -itemtype  imagetext
       -image $image -text one $t insert end -itemtype imagetext -image $image -text two $t insert end -itemtype
       imagetext  -image $image -text three $t insert end -itemtype imagetext -image $image -text four $t insert
       end -itemtype imagetext -image $image -text five $t insert end -itemtype imagetext  -image  $image  -text
       six pack $t -expand yes -fill both
