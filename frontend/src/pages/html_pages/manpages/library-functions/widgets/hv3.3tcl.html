       hv3 - Mega-widget building on Tkhtml.

       THIS  IS  A  WORK IN PROGRESS. IT IS POSSIBLE TO USE THE HV3 WIDGET, BUT IT IS NOT YET PROPERLY PACKAGED.
       POST ON THE MAILING LIST IF YOU WISH TO USE IT NOW.

       Comments and feedback also welcome.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
              package require snit
              package require hv3
              ::hv3::hv3 pathName ?options?

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The [hv3] command creates a new window (given by the pathName argument) and makes it into hv3 widget. The
       hv3 command returns its pathName argument. At the time this command is invoked, there must  not  exist  a
       window  named  pathName,  but  pathName"s  parent  must exist. Hv3 is a pure Tcl widget implemented using
       Tkhtml3 and the excellent mega-widget framework Snit.

       An [hv3] widget is not a web-browser. If it were to be used as a component in a  web-browser  application
       it  would  represent  a  single  browser frame (or iframe). The API described in this document is not the
       whole API offered by the snit object ::hv3::hv3. Instead, it is the subset of that API that  is  expected
       not to change. No guarantees of course.

       There  are two "objects" involved in using the [hv3] widget. One is the widget itself ([::hv3::hv3]). The
       other is the request-handle ([::hv3::request]). A request-handle is the interface between the hv3  widget
       and  wherever  it  is  getting  its data from (i.e. your implementation of http://, https:// etc.).  Many
       users will also wish to understand the Tkhtml3 "node-handle" interface, documented as part of the Tkhtml3
       manpage.

       An [hv3] widget provides the following features on top of the [html] widget:

              * Built-in scrollbars.

              * Support for selecting text with the pointer.

              * Support for loading linked images and stylesheets from URIs.

              * Support for HTML forms and submission thereof.

              * Support for CSS configured hover (mouseover) effects.

              * Support for loading a new document by clicking on a hyper-link.

       The two most important interfaces are the [goto] method and the
        -requestcmd option. The [goto] method tells the widget to load the document identified by the  specified
       absolute or relative URI.

       The  -requestcmd  option must be configured with a callback script that the widget invokes to request the
       requested document. It is the users responsibility to retrieve the document  and  pass  it  back  to  the
       widget. If the document contains links to external resources (images or CSS stylesheets), then the widget
       invokes the
        -requestcmd  script  to request these. The -requestcmd callback may choose to implement handling for one
       or more of http:// URIs, file:// URIs or any other existing or invented  URI  scheme.  See  the  "Example
       Usage" section below for an example.

</pre><h4><b>STANDARD</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
              -height
              -width

</pre><h4><b>HTML</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following Tkhtml options are exposed as public options of this mega-widget.

              -fontscale
              -fonttable
              -forcefontmetrics
              -zoom

</pre><h4><b>HTML</b> <b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       The following Tkhtml commands are exposed as public options of this mega-widget.

              node ? ?-index? x y?

</pre><h4><b>WIDGET-SPECIFIC</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Command-Line Name:-enableimages
        .br Database Name:  enableimages
        .br Database Class: Enableimages
        .br
        .RS
        .PP  Boolean  option  (default  true). True for image support, false otherwise. If this option is set to
       false, then the -requestcmd script will never be invoked to request an image resource.
        .RE Command-Line Name:-isvisitedcmd
        .br Database Name:  isvisitedcmd
        .br Database Class: Isvisitedcmd
        .br
        .RS
        .PP If not an empty string, this option specifies a script for the widget to invoke to  determine  if  a
       hyperlink  (&amp;lt;A&amp;gt;)  node  should  be  styled  with  the :link or :visited pseudo-class. The script is
       invoked with the node handle appended to it. If true is returned, :visited is used, otherwise :link.
        .RE Command-Line Name:-requestcmd
        .br Database Name:  requestcmd
        .br Database Class: Requestcmd
        .br
        .RS
        .PP If this option is not set by the user code, then the Hv3 widget will be unable to display anything.

       It should be set to a script that may be invoked by the hv3 widget to  request  a  resource  required  to
       display  a  URI requested via the [goto] method. Each time a resource is required, the -requestcmd script
       is invoked with a single argument appended to it, the name  of  a  request  handle  object.  See  section
       "Request Handles" for details.
        .RE Command-Line Name:-targetcmd
        .br Database Name:  targetcmd
        .br Database Class: Targetcmd
        .br
        .RS
        .PP  If  this option is not set to an empty string (the default), it should be set to a script that will
       be invoked each time a hyper-link is clicked or a form submitted in the hv3 widget  by  the  end-user.  A
       single  argument  is  appended  to  the  script  before  it is evaluated, the Tkhtml3 node-handle for the
       relevant &amp;lt;FORM&amp;gt; (in the case of form submittal) or &amp;lt;A&amp;gt; (if the end user clicked a  hyperlink)
       node.  The  script  should return the path of an hv3 widget into which the new resource should be loaded.
       This is useful for implementing browsers that support HTML frames and iframes.

       If the script returns an empty string the request is abandoned and the new resource never loaded and  the
       form data (if any) not submitted.

       If the option is set to an empty string the new resource is always loaded into the hv3 widget itself.
        .RE

</pre><h4><b>WIDGET</b> <b>COMMAND</b></h4><pre>
       The  [hv3]  command  creates a new Tcl command whose name is pathName. This command may be used to invoke
       various operations on the widget as follows:

       pathName cget option
              Returns the current value of the configuration option given by option. Option may have any of  the
              values accepted by the [hv3] command.

       pathName configure ?option? ?value?
              Query or modify the configuration options of the widget. If no option is specified, returns a list
              describing  all of the available options for pathName (see Tk_ConfigureInfo for information on the
              format of this list). If option is specified with no  value,  then  the  command  returns  a  list
              describing  the  one named option (this list will be identical to the corresponding sublist of the
              value returned if no option is specified). If one or more option-value pairs are  specified,  then
              the  command  modifies  the  given  widget  option(s) to have the given value(s); in this case the
              command returns an empty string. Option may have any of the values accepted by the [hv3] command.

       pathName goto uri
              Load the resource at uri into the widget. If uri is not an  absolute  URI,  it  is  resolved  with
              respect to the widget"s current document URI (or &amp;lt;BASE&amp;gt; element contents, if present).

       pathName stop
              Abandon  all pending requests. All request handle objects that are still outstanding are destroyed
              (it is an error to use such a request handle after calling [stop]).

</pre><h4><b>REQUEST</b> <b>HANDLES</b></h4><pre>
       To be useful, the user must provide the hv3 with some way to request resources  ((X)HTML  documents,  CSS
       stylesheets  and  binary  image  files) identified by URI for display. To this end, the user configures a
       -requestcmd script with the hv3 widget.  Each time a resource is  required,  the  -requestcmd  script  is
       evaluated with a single argument, a request handle object identifier, appended to it.

       A  request  handle  object is a snit object. The -requestcmd script can query the object to determine the
       parameters of the request and then invoke object methods to return data and meta data. The key  APIs  are
       the -uri option and the [finish] method.

       Data  may  be  returned  asynchronously.  That  is,  it  is  not necessary to return data from within the
       -requestcmd evaluation, the request handle may be stored and data returned at some later time.

        .PP This option is used by "POST" requests, which may be made by an hv3 widget if  the  loaded  document
       contains  a form and the end-user submits it. For a "GET" request (all other requests, the usual case) it
       is set to an empty string.

       The cannonical test to check if a given request is a POST or GET request is:

              if {[$handle cget -postdata] ne ""} {
                # This is a POST request.
              } else {
                # This is a GET request.
              }

       For POST requests, this option may be set by the Hv3 widget to  contain  the  Content-Type  of  the  data
       stored in the -postdata option. For example "application/x-www-form-urlencoded".

       code.

       The user code may set this option to a list containing data to be handled by the hv3 widget as if it  had
       been  returned as the HTTP header for an HTTP request. The list consists of alternating HTTP header-names
       and values. This is the same format as the "meta" element of the "state array" interface  used  by  Tcl"s
       built-in http package.

       The Hv3 widget interprets the following HTTP headers:

       If the user code knows the mime type of the resource being returned, it should set this option before the
       first  invocation of the [append] method. Useful values recognized by the hv3 widget include "text/xhtml"

   <b>REQUEST</b> <b>HANDLE</b> <b>METHODS</b>
       requestHandle append data
              This method should be invoked one or more times to return data to the hv3 widget.

              The  data  passed  to this method should always be binary data.  If the data is actually text data
              for a document or stylesheet, it"s encoding is determined based on either a HTTP  header  returned
              via  the  [header]  option,  or  a  &amp;lt;meta&amp;gt; element in the header section of an HTML or XHTML
              document.  If neither of these are present, the assumed encoding is either the  document  encoding
              in  the  case  of linked CSS stylesheet, or the value returned by [encoding system] for an HTML or
              XHTML document.

       requestHandle finish
              This method should be called after all data has  been  obtained.  The  request  handle  object  is
              deleted  by  the system from within this call, so the object may not be used after this method has
              been invoked.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>CUSTOM</b> <b>URI</b> <b>SCHEMES</b>
       The hv3 widget may seem a little unusual at first in that there is no interface  to  feed  data  directly
       from  the  users  script  to  the  widget. Instead, the widget requests the required data by invoking the
       -requestcmd script. Data is identified by the -uri option of the request handle passed as an argument.

       The reason for this is that the widget often deals with documents that contain linked resources (external
       CSS stylesheets or images).  The resources are not always known when the user  script  initiates  loading
       the document. For example, if the following document is to be loaded from URI "<a href="http://tkhtml.tcl.tk">http://tkhtml.tcl.tk</a>":

              &lt;HTML&gt;
                &lt;BODY&gt;
                  &lt;IMG src="image.gif"&gt;
                &lt;/BODY&gt;
              &lt;/HTML&gt;

       then the -requestcmd must implement the HTTP protocol. The user calls:

              $hv3 goto <a href="http://tkhtml.tcl.tk">http://tkhtml.tcl.tk</a>

       which  causes  the  -requestcmd  script  to  be invoked with a request handle argument specifying the URI
       "<a href="http://tkhtml.tcl.tk">http://tkhtml.tcl.tk</a>".

       When the -requestcmd returns the  data  for  the  URI  "<a href="http://tkhtml.tcl.tk">http://tkhtml.tcl.tk</a>",  the  widget  invokes  the
       -requestcmd    a    second    time,    with    a    request    handle   argument   specifying   the   URI
       "<a href="http://tkhtml.tcl.tk/image.gif">http://tkhtml.tcl.tk/image.gif</a>". If the document contained links to CSS stylesheets or other images, the
       _-requestcmd- script would be invoked for each of these also.

       All this is fine if you are fetching data from http servers, but a little inconvenient if the user script
       already has the document to display ready in a Tcl variable (or  variables).  The  solution  here  is  to
       invent a custom URI scheme to use within the application. For example, the following example demonstrates
       a
        -requestcmd script that implements the "tclvar:", URI scheme for refering to global Tcl variables.

              proc tclvar_requestcmd {R} {
                # Get the URI from the request handle. The URI should look
                # something like:
                #
                #   tclvar:///&lt;global varname&gt;
                #
                set uri [$R cget -uri]

                # Strip "tclvar:///" from the start of the URI.
                set var [string range $uri 10 end]

                # Return the data in the global variable $var to the widget.
                global $var
                $R finish [set $var]
              }

       And a simple script for using this -requestcmd:

              set my_document {
                &lt;HTML&gt;
                  &lt;LINK rel="stylesheet" href="my_stylesheet"&gt;
                  &lt;BODY&gt;
                    &lt;P&gt;Some red text.&lt;/P&gt;
                  &lt;/BODY&gt;
                &lt;/HTML&gt;
              }
              set my_stylesheet {
                P { color : red }
              }

              ::hv3::hv3 .hv3
              pack .hv3 -fill both -expand true

               .hv3 configure -requestcmd tclvar_requestcmd
               .hv3 goto tclvar:///my_document

       Note  the  complication  in  the  code  above - the string "tclvar:///" is found at the start of each URI
       passed to [tclvar_requestcmd]. This is because Hv3 resolves and escapes all URIs against the base URI  of
       the currently loaded document before passing them to the
        -requestcmd.  This  means  you  need  to be careful with special characters. If the name of the variable
       storing the stylesheet document in the above example were ::css::my_stylesheet, then markup like this:

              &lt;LINK rel="stylesheet" href="::css::my_stylesheet"&gt;

       would not work. The string "::css::my_stylesheet" is not a valid relative or absolute URI, so the results
       of resolving it against the base URI of the  document,  "tclvar:///my_document",  are  not  defined.  The
       solution  is  to  escape  the  variable  names  using  URI  escapes.  The  Tkhtml3  package  provides the
       [::tkhtml::encode] and [::tkhtml::decode] commands for escaping  and  unescaping  strings,  respectively.
       After modifying the -requestcmd proc to support escaped strings, it looks like this:

              proc tclvar_requestcmd {R} {
                # Get the URI from the request handle. The URI should look
                # something like:
                #
                #   tclvar:///&lt;global varname&gt;
                #
                set uri [$R cget -uri]

                # Strip "tclvar:///" from the start of the URI.
                set var [::thtml::decode [string range $uri 10 end]]

                # Return the data in the global variable $var to the widget.
                global $var
                $R finish [set $var]
              }

       This could be used with a script like this:

              set my/document {
                &lt;HTML&gt;
                  &lt;LINK rel="stylesheet" href="%3A%3Acss%3A%3Amy_stylesheet"&gt;
                  &lt;BODY&gt;
                    &lt;P&gt;Some red text.&lt;/P&gt;
                  &lt;/BODY&gt;
                &lt;/HTML&gt;
              }
              namespace eval ::css {
                set my_stylesheet {
                  P { color : red }
                }
              }

              ::hv3::hv3 .hv3
              pack .hv3 -fill both -expand true

               .hv3 configure -requestcmd tclvar_requestcmd
               .hv3 goto tclvar:///[::tkhtml::encode my/document]

       In  this  case  the  two  invocation of tclvar_requestcmd are made with request handle arguments with the
       following -uri option values:

              tclvar:///my%2Fdocument
              tclvar:///%3A%3Acss%3A%3Amy_stylesheet

       Other custom URI scheme handlers could retrieve data by evaluating Tcl scripts, querying  a  database  or
       accessing any other part of the application.
