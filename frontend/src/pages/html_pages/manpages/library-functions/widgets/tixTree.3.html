</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       tixTree - Create and manipulate tixTree widgets

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>tixTree</b> <u>pathName</u> ?<u>options</u>?

</pre><h4><b>SUPER-CLASS</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>TixTree</b>  class is derived from the <b>TixScrolledHList</b> class and inherits all the commands, options and
       subwidgets of its super-class.

</pre><h4><b>STANDARD</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>TixTree</b> supports all the standard options of a frame widget.  See the <b>options(n)</b> manual entry for details
       on the standard options.

</pre><h4><b>WIDGET-SPECIFIC</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       [<b>-browsecmd</b> <u>browseCmd</u>] Specifies a command to call whenever the user browses  on  an  entry  (usually  by
       single-clicking  on  the  entry).  The  command  is  called with one argument, the pathname of the entry.
       [<b>-closecmd</b> <u>closeCmd</u>] Specifies a command to call whenever an entry needs to be closed (See  the  BINDINGS
       section  below). This command is called with one argument, the pathname of the entry. This command should
       perform appropriate actions to close the specified entry. If the <b>-closecmd</b> option is not  specified,  the
       default closing action is to hide all child entries of the specified entry.  [<b>-command</b> <u>command</u>] Specifies
       a  command  to  call  whenever the user activates an entry (usually by double-clicking on the entry). The
       command is called with one argument, the pathname of the entry.  [<b>-ignoreinvoke</b> <u>ignoreInvoke</u>]  A  Boolean
       value  that  specifies when a branch should be opened or closed. A branch will always be opened or closed
       when the user presses the (+) and (-) indicators. However, when the user invokes  a  branch  (by  doublc-
       clicking or pressing &lt;Return&gt;), the branch will be opened or closed only if <b>-ignoreinvoke</b> is set to false
       (the default setting).

       [<b>-opencmd</b>  <u>openCmd</u>]  Specifies  a  command to call whenever an entry needs to be opened (See the BINDINGS
       section below). This command is called with one argument, the pathname of the entry. This command  should
       perform  appropriate  actions  to  open the specified entry. If the <b>-opencmd</b> option is not specified, the
       default opening action is to show all the child entries of the specified entry.

</pre><h4><b>SUBWIDGETS</b></h4><pre>
       Name:          <b>hlist</b>
       Class:         <b>TixHList</b>

              The hierarchical listbox that displays the tree.

       Name:          <b>hsb</b>
       Class:         <b>Scrollbar</b>

              The horizontal scrollbar subwidget.

       Name:          <b>vsb</b>
       Class:         <b>Scrollbar</b>

              The vertical scrollbar subwidget.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>tixTree</b> command creates a new window (given by the <u>pathName</u>  argument)  and  makes  it  into  a  Tree
       widget.   Additional  options,  described  above,  may  be specified on the command line or in the option
       database to configure aspects of the Tree widget such as its cursor and relief.

       The Tree widget can be used to display hierarchical data in a tree form. The user can adjust the view  of
       the tree by opening or closing parts of the tree.

       To display a static tree structure, you can add the entries into the <b>hlist</b> subwidget and hide any entries
       as desired. Then you can call the <b>autosetmode</b> method. This will set up the Tree widget so that it handles
       all the <u>open</u> and <u>close</u> events automatically.

       The above method is not applicable if you want to maintain a dynamic tree structure, i.e, you do not know
       all  the  entries  in the tree and you need to add or delete entries subsequently. To do this, you should
       first create the entries in the <b>hlist</b> subwidget. Then, use the setmode method  to  indicate  the  entries
       that  can  be  opened  or  closed,  and use the <b>-opencmd</b> and  <b>-closecmd</b> options to handle the opening and
       closing events.

</pre><h4><b>WIDGET</b> <b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>tixTree</b> command creates a new Tcl command whose name is the same as  the  path  name  of  the  Tree's
       window.   This  command  may  be  used  to  invoke various operations on the widget. It has the following
       general form:
              <u>pathName</u> <u>option</u> ?<u>arg</u> <u>arg</u> <u>...</u>?
       <u>PathName</u> is the name of the command, which is the same as the Tree widget's path  name.  <u>Option</u>  and  the
       <u>arg</u>s determine the exact behavior of the command. The following commands are possible for Tree widgets:

       <u>pathName</u> <b>autosetmode</b>
              This  command calls the <b>setmode</b> method for all the entries in this Tree widget: if an entry has no
              child entries, its mode is set to <b>none</b>. Otherwise, if the entry has any hidden child entries,  its
              mode is set to <b>open</b>; otherwise its mode is set to <b>close</b>.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>cget</b> <u>option</u>
              Returns  the current value of the configuration option given by <u>option</u>. <u>Option</u> may have any of the
              values accepted by the <b>tixTree</b> command.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>close</b> <u>entryPath</u>
              Close the entry given by <u>entryPath</u> if its <u>mode</u> is <b>close</b>.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>configure</b> ?<u>option</u>? <u>?value</u> <u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>...</u>?
              Query or modify the configuration options of the widget.  If no <u>option</u>  is  specified,  returns  a
              list describing all of the available options for <u>pathName</u> (see <b>Tk_ConfigureInfo</b> for information on
              the  format  of  this list). If <u>option</u> is specified with no <u>value</u>, then the command returns a list
              describing the one named option (this list will be identical to the corresponding sublist  of  the
              value  returned if no <u>option</u> is specified).  If one or more <u>option-value</u> pairs are specified, then
              the command modifies the given widget option(s) to have the  given  value(s);  in  this  case  the
              command  returns  an  empty  string.   <u>Option</u>  may  have any of the values accepted by the <b>tixTree</b>
              command.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>getmode</b> <u>entryPath</u>
              Returns the current <u>mode</u> of the entry given by <u>entryPath</u>.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>open</b> <u>entryPath</u>
              Open the entry givaen by <u>entryPath</u> if its <u>mode</u> is <b>open</b>.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>setmode</b>  <u>entryPath</u> <u>mode</u>
              This command is used to indicate whether the entry given by <u>entryPath</u>  has  children  entries  and
              whether the children are visible. <u>mode</u> must be one of <b>open</b>, <b>close</b> or <b>none</b>. If <u>mode</u> is set to <b>open</b>,
              a  (+)  indicator  is  drawn next the the entry. If <u>mode</u> is set to <b>close</b>, a (-) indicator is drawn
              next the the entry. If <u>mode</u> is set to <b>none</b>, no indicators  will  be  drawn  for  this  entry.  The
              default  <u>mode</u> is none. The <b>open</b> mode indicates the entry has hidden children and this entry can be
              opened by the user. The <b>close</b> mode indicates that all the children of the entry  are  now  visible
              and the entry can be closed by the user.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>subwidget</b>  <u>name</u> <u>?args?</u>
              When  no  options  are  given, this command returns the pathname of the subwidget of the specified
              name.

              When options are given, the widget command of the specified subwidget will be  called  with  these
              options.

</pre><h4><b>BINDINGS</b></h4><pre>
       The  basic  mouse  and  keyboard  bindings  of  the Tree widget are the same as the bindings of the HList
       widget.

       In addition, the entries can be opened or closed under the following conditions:

       [1]    If the <u>mode</u> of the entry is <b>open</b>, it can be opened by clicking on its  (+)  indicator  or  double-
              clicking on the entry.

       [2]    If  the  <u>mode</u>  of the entry is <b>close</b>, it can be closed by clicking on its (-) indicator or double-
              clicking on the entry.
