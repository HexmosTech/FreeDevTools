       <b>XmIsTraversable</b> — A function that identifies whether a widget can be traversed "XmIsTraversable"

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;Xm/Xm.h&gt;
       <b>Boolean</b> <b>XmIsTraversable</b>(
       <b>Widget</b> <b>widget</b>);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>XmIsTraversable</b>  determines  whether  the  specified widget is eligible to receive focus through keyboard
       traversal.  In general, a widget is eligible to receive focus when all of the  following  conditions  are
       true:

          •  The  widget  and its ancestors are not being destroyed, are sensitive, and have a value of True for
             <b>XmNtraversalOn</b>.

          •  The widget and its ancestors are realized,  managed,  and  (except  for  gadgets)  mapped.   If  an
             application  unmaps  a  <u>widget</u>  that  has its <b>XmNmappedWhenManaged</b> resource set to True, the return
             value is undefined.

          •  Some part of the widget's rectangular area is unobscured by the widget's ancestors, or some part of
             the widget's rectangular area is inside the work window (but possibly outside the clip window) of a
             ScrolledWindow whose <b>XmNscrollingPolicy</b> is <b>XmAUTOMATIC</b> and whose <b>XmNtraverseObscuredCallback</b> is not
             NULL.

       Some widgets may not be eligible to receive focus even if they meet all these conditions.   For  example,
       most  managers  cannot receive focus through keyboard traversal.  Some widgets may be eligible to receive
       focus under particular conditions.  For example, a DrawingArea is eligible to receive focus if  it  meets
       the conditions above and has no child whose <b>XmNtraversalOn</b> resource is True.

       Note that when all widgets in a shell hierarchy have been made untraversable, they are considered to have
       lost focus. When a widget in this hierarchy is made traversable again, it regains focus.

       <b>XmIsTraversable</b>  may  return  unexpected  results  when  <u>widget</u>  or its ancestors are overlapped by their
       siblings.

       <u>widget</u>    Specifies the ID of the widget

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b></h4><pre>
       Returns True if the widget is eligible to receive focus through keyboard  traversal;  otherwise,  returns
       False.
