</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Number::Tolerant::Union - unions of tolerance ranges

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 1.710

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        use Number::Tolerant;

        my $range1 = tolerance(10 =&gt; to =&gt; 12);
        my $range2 = tolerance(14 =&gt; to =&gt; 16);

        my $union = $range1 | $range2;

        if ($11 == $union) { ... } # this will happen
        if ($12 == $union) { ... } # so will this

        if ($13 == $union) { ... } # nothing will happen here

        if ($14 == $union) { ... } # this will happen
        if ($15 == $union) { ... } # so will this

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Number::Tolerant::Union is used by Number::Tolerant to represent the union of multiple tolerances.  A
       subset of the same operators that function on a tolerance will function on a union of tolerances, as
       listed below.

</pre><h4><b>PERL</b> <b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This library should run on perls released even a long time ago.  It should work on any version of perl
       released in the last five years.

       Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made that the minimum required version
       will not be increased.  The version may be increased for any reason, and there is no promise that patches
       will be accepted to lower the minimum required perl.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>new</b>
         my $union = Number::Tolerant::Union-&gt;new(@list_of_tolerances);

       There is a "new" method on the Number::Tolerant::Union class, but unions are meant to be created with the
       "|" operator on a Number::Tolerant tolerance.

       The arguments to "new" are a list of numbers or tolerances to be unioned.

       Intersecting ranges are not converted into a single range, but this may change in the future.  (For
       example, the union of "5 to 10" and "7 to 12" is not "5 to 12.")

   <b>options</b>
       This method will return a list of all the acceptable options for the union.

   <b>Overloading</b>
       Tolerance unions overload a few operations, mostly comparisons.

       numification
           Unions numify to undef.  If there's a better idea, I'd love to hear it.

       stringification
           A  tolerance  stringifies  to  a  short description of itself.  This is a set of the union's options,
           parentheses-enclosed and joined by the word "or"

       equality
           A number is equal to a union if it is equal to any of its options.

       comparison
           A number is greater than a union if it is greater than all its options.

           A number is less than a union if it is less than all its options.

       union intersection
           An intersection ("&amp;") with a union is commutted across all options.  In other words:

            (a | b | c) &amp; d  ==yields==&gt; ((a &amp; d) | (b &amp; d) | (c &amp; d))

           Options that have no intersection with the new element are dropped.  The intersection of  a  constant
           number  and  a union yields that number, if the number was in the union's ranges and otherwise yields
           nothing.

</pre><h4><b>TODO</b></h4><pre>
       Who knows.  Collapsing overlapping options, probably.
