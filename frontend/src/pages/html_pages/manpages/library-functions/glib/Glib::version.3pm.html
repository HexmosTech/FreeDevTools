       Glib::version -  Library Versioning Utilities

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         # require at least version 1.021 of the Glib module
         use Glib '1.021';

         # g_set_application_name() was introduced in GLib 2.2.0, and
         # first supported by version 1.040 of the Glib Perl module.
         if ($Glib::VERSION &gt;= 1.040 and Glib-&gt;CHECK_VERSION (2,2,0)) {
            Glib::set_application_name ('My Cool Program');
         }

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Both the Glib module and the GLib C library are works-in-progress, and their interfaces grow over time.
       As more features are added to each, and your code uses those new features, you will introduce version-
       specific dependencies, and naturally, you'll want to be able to code around them.  Enter the versioning
       API.

       For simple Perl modules, a single version number is sufficient; however, Glib is a binding to another
       software library, and this introduces some complexity.  We have three versions that fully specify the API
       available to you.

       Perl Bindings Version
           Perl  modules  use  a version number, and Glib is no exception.  <u>$Glib::VERSION</u> is the version of the
           current Glib module.  By ad hoc convention, gtk2-perl modules generally use version  numbers  in  the
           form x.yyz, where even yy values denote stable releases and z is a patchlevel.

              $Glib::VERSION
              use Glib 1.040; # require at least version 1.040

       Compile-time ("Bound") Library Version
           This  is  the  version of the GLib C library that was available when the Perl module was compiled and
           installed.  These version constants are equivalent to the version  macros  provided  in  the  GLib  C
           headers.  GLib uses a major.minor.micro convention, where even minor versions are stable.  (gtk2-perl
           does not officially support unstable versions.)

              Glib::MAJOR_VERSION
              Glib::MINOR_VERSION
              Glib::MICRO_VERSION
              Glib-&gt;CHECK_VERSION($maj,$min,$mic)

       Run-time ("Linked") Library Version
           This  is  the  version  of the GLib C library that is available at run time; it may be newer than the
           compile-time version, but should never be older.  These  are  equivalent  to  the  version  variables
           exported by the GLib C library.

              Glib::major_version
              Glib::minor_version
              Glib::micro_version

   <b>Which</b> <b>one</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>use</b> <b>when?</b>
       Where do you use which version?  It depends entirely on what you're doing.  Let's explain by example:

       o Use the Perl module version for bindings support issues
           You need to register a new enum for use as the type of an object property.  This is something you can
           do  with all versions of the underlying C library, but which wasn't supported in the Glib Perl module
           until $Glib::VERSION &gt;= 1.040.

       o Use the bound version for library features
           You want to call Glib::set_application_name to set a human-readable name for your application  (which
           is  used  by various parts of Gtk2 and Gnome2).  <b>g_set_application_name()</b> (the underlying C function)
           was added in version 2.2.0 of glib, and support for it was introduced into the Glib  Perl  module  in
           Glib version 1.040.  However, you can build the Perl module against any stable 2.x.x version of glib,
           so you might not have that function available even if your Glib module is new enough!
             Thus, you need to check two things to see if the this function is available:

              if ($Glib::VERSION &gt;= 1.040 &amp;&amp; Glib-&gt;CHECK_VERSION (2,2,0)) {
                  # it's available, and we can call it!
                  Glib::set_application_name ('My Cool Application');
              }

           Now  what  happens if you installed the Perl module when your system had glib 2.0.6, and you upgraded
           glib to 2.4.1?  Wouldn't <b>g_set_application_name()</b> be available?  Well, it's there,  under  the  hood,
           but  the bindings were compiled when it wasn't there, so you won't be able to call it!  That's why we
           check the "bound" or compile-time version.  By the way, to enable support for the new function, you'd
           need to reinstall (or upgrade) the Perl module.

       o Use the linked version for runtime work-arounds
           Suppose there's a function whose API did not change, but  whose  implementation  had  a  bug  in  one
           version  that was fixed in another version.  To determine whether you need to apply a workaround, you
           would check the version that is actually being used at runtime.

              if (Glib::major_version == 2 &amp;&amp;
                  Glib::minor_version == 2 &amp;&amp;
                  Glib::micro_version == 1) {
                 # work around bug that exists only in glib 2.2.1.
              }

           In practice, such situations are very rare.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>boolean</b> <b>=</b> <b>Glib-&gt;CHECK_VERSION</b> <b>($required_major,</b> <b>$required_minor,</b> <b>$required_micro)</b>
       •   $required_major (integer)

       •   $required_minor (integer)

       •   $required_micro (integer)

       Provides a mechanism for checking the version information that Glib  was  compiled  against.  Essentially
       equvilent to the macro GLIB_CHECK_VERSION.

   <b>(MAJOR,</b> <b>MINOR,</b> <b>MICRO)</b> <b>=</b> <b>Glib-&gt;GET_VERSION_INFO</b>
       Shorthand  to  fetch  as a list the glib version for which Glib was compiled.  See "Glib::MAJOR_VERSION",
       etc.

   <b>integer</b> <b>=</b> <b>Glib::MAJOR_VERSION</b>
       Provides access to the version information that Glib was compiled against.  Essentially equivalent to the
       #define's GLIB_MAJOR_VERSION.

   <b>integer</b> <b>=</b> <b>Glib::MICRO_VERSION</b>
       Provides access to the version information that Glib was compiled against.  Essentially equivalent to the
       #define's GLIB_MICRO_VERSION.

   <b>integer</b> <b>=</b> <b>Glib::MINOR_VERSION</b>
       Provides access to the version information that Glib was compiled against.  Essentially equivalent to the
       #define's GLIB_MINOR_VERSION.

   <b>integer</b> <b>=</b> <b>Glib::major_version</b>
       Provides access to the version information that Glib is linked against.  Essentially  equivalent  to  the
       global variable glib_major_version.

   <b>integer</b> <b>=</b> <b>Glib::micro_version</b>
       Provides  access  to  the version information that Glib is linked against.  Essentially equivalent to the
       global variable glib_micro_version.

   <b>integer</b> <b>=</b> <b>Glib::minor_version</b>
       Provides access to the version information that Glib is linked against.  Essentially  equivalent  to  the
       global variable glib_minor_version.
