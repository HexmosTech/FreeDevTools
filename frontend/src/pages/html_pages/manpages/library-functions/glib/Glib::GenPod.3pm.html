       Glib::GenPod - POD generation utilities for Glib-based modules

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        use Glib::GenPod;

        # use the defaults:
        xsdoc2pod ($xsdocparse_output_file, $destination_dir);

        # or take matters into your own hands
        require $xsdocparse_output_file;
        foreach my $package (sort keys %$data) {
            print "=head1 NAME\n\n$package\n\n";
            print "=head1 METHODS\n\n" . podify_methods ($package) . "\n\n";
        }

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module includes several utilities for creating pod for xs-based Perl modules which build on the Glib
       module's foundations.  The most important bits are the logic to convert the data structures created by
       xsdocparse.pl to describe xsubs and pods into method docs, with call signatures and argument
       descriptions, and converting C type names into Perl type names.  The rest of the module is mostly boiler-
       plate code to format and pretty-print information that may be queried from the Glib type system.

       To make life easy for module maintainers, we also include a do-it-all function, <b>xsdoc2pod()</b>, which does
       pretty much everything for you.  All of the pieces it uses are publically usable, so you can do whatever
       you like if you don't like the default output.

</pre><h4><b>DOCUMENTING</b> <b>THE</b> <b>XS</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       All of the information used as input to the methods included here comes from the XS files of your
       project, and is extracted by Glib::ParseXSDoc's "xsdocparse".  This function creates an file containing
       Perl code that may be eval'd or require'd to recreate the parsed data structures, which are a list of
       pods from the verbatim C portion of the XS file (the xs api docs), and a hash of the remaining data,
       keyed by package name, and including the pods and xsubs read from the rest of each XS file following the
       first MODULE line.

       Several custom POD directives are recognized in the XSubs section.  Note that each one is sought as a
       paragraph starter, and must follow a "=cut" directive.

       =for object Package::Name
           All  xsubs  and pod from here until the next object directive or MODULE line will be placed under the
           key '<u>Package::Name</u>' in xsdocparse's data structure.  Everything from this line to the next "=cut"  is
           included as a description POD.

       =for object Package::Name (Other::Package::Name)
           Generate  POD  in <u>Package::Name</u> but for the package <u>Other::Package::Name</u>.  This is useful if you want
           POD to appear in a different namespace but still want the automatically generated  hierarchy,  signal
           and property listing, etc. from the original namespace.  For example:

             =for object Gnome2::PanelApplet::main (Gnome2::PanelApplet)
             =cut

           This will create Gnome2/PanelApplet/main.pod containing the automatically generated documentation for
           Gnome2::PanelApplet (hierarchy, signals, etc.) plus the method listing from the current XS file.

       =for enum Package::Name
       =for flags Package::Name
           This  causes  xsdoc2pod to call "podify_values" on <u>Package::Name</u> when writing the pod for the current
           package (as set by an object directive or MODULE line).  Any text in  this  paragraph,  to  the  next
           "=cut", is included in that section.

       =for deprecated_by Package::Name
           Used to add a deprecation warning, indicating <u>Package::Name</u> as an alternative way to achieve the same
           functionality.  There may be any number these in each package.

       =for see_also some_thing_to_see
           Used  to  add  extra  see  alsos  onto  the end of the parents, if any, for a given object.  Anything
           following the space behind see_also up to the end of the line will be placed onto the  list  of  "see
           also"s.  There may be any number of these in each package.

       =for apidoc
       =for apidoc Full::Symbol::name
           Paragraphs  of  this type document xsubs, and are associated with the xsubs by xsdocparse.pl.  If the
           full symbol name is not included, the paragraph must be attached to the xsub  declaration  (no  blank
           lines between "=cut" and the xsub).

           Within the apidoc PODs, we recognize a few special directives (the "for\s+" is optional on these):

           =for signature ...
               Override  the  generated  call  signature  with  the ... text.  If you include multiple signature
               directives, they will all be used.  This is handy when you want to change the return type or list
               different ways to invoke an overloaded method, like this:

                =for apidoc

                =signature bool Class-&gt;foo

                =signature ($thing, @other) = $object-&gt;foo ($it, $something)

                Text in here is included in the generated documentation.
                You can actually include signature and arg directives
                at any point in this pod -- they are stripped after.
                In fact, any pod is valid in here, until the =cut.

                =cut
                void foo (...)
                    PPCODE:
                       /* crazy code follows */

           =for arg name (type) description
           =for arg name description
               The arg directive adds or overrides an argument description.  The description text  is  optional,
               as is the type specification (the part in parentheses).  If you want to hide an argument, specify
               "__hide__"  as  its type.  The arg name does <u>not</u> need to include a sigil, as dollar signs will be
               added.  FIXME what about @ for lists?

           Also, we honor a couple of "modifiers" on the  =for  apidoc  line,  following  the  symbol  name,  if
           present:

           - __hide__
               Do  not  document  this  xsub.  This is handy in certain situations, e.g., for private functions.
               DESTROY always has this turned on, for example.

           - __gerror__
               This function or method can generate a Glib::Error exception.

           - __function__
               Generate a function-style signature for this xsub.   The  default  is  to  generate  method-style
               signatures.

           - __deprecated__
               This function or method is deprecated and should not be used in newly written code.

           (These  are  actually  handled  by  Glib::ParseXSDoc, but we list them here because, well, they're an
           important part of how you document the XS files.)

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       xsdoc2pod ($datafile, $outdir='blib/lib', index=undef)
           Given a <u>$datafile</u> containing the output of xsdocparse.pl, create in  <u>$outdir</u>  a  pod  file  for  each
           package,  containing  everything  we can think of for that module.  Output is controlled by the "=for
           object" directives and such in the source code.

           If you don't want each package to create a separate pod file, then use  this  function's  code  as  a
           starting point for your own pretty-printer.

       add_types (@filenames)
           Parse  the  given  <u>@filenames</u>  for  entries  to  add to the %basic_types used for C type name to Perl
           package name mappings of types that are not registered with the Glib type system.  The file format is
           dead simple: blank lines are ignored; /#.*$/ is stripped from each line as comments; the first  token
           on  each line is considered to be a C type name, and the remaining tokens are the description of that
           type.  For example, a valid file may look like this:

             # a couple of special types
             FooBar      Foo::Bar
             Frob        localized frobnicator

           C type decorations such as "const" and "*" are implied (do not include them), and the _ornull variant
           is handled for you.

       $string = podify_properties ($packagename)
           Pretty-print the object properties owned by the Glib::Object derivative <u>$packagename</u> and  return  the
           text as a string.  Returns undef if there are no properties or <u>$package</u> is not a Glib::Object.

       $string = podify_child_properties ($packagename)
           Pretty-print the child properties owned by the Gtk2::Container derivative <u>$packagename</u> and return the
           text  as  a  string.   Returns  undef  if  there  are  no  child  properties  or  <u>$package</u>  is  not a
           Gtk2::Container or similar class with a list_child_properties() method.

       $string = podify_style_properties ($packagename)
           Pretty-print the style properties owned by the Gtk2::Widget derivative <u>$packagename</u>  and  return  the
           text  as  a string.  Returns undef if there are no style properties or <u>$package</u> is not a Gtk2::Widget
           or similar class with a list_style_properties() method.

       $string = podify_values ($packagename)
           List and pretty-print the values of the GEnum or GFlags type <u>$packagename</u>, and return the text  as  a
           string.  Returns undef if <u>$packagename</u> isn't an enum or flags type.

       $string = podify_signals ($packagename)
           Query,  list,  and  pretty-print  the  signals  associated  with <u>$packagename</u>.  Returns the text as a
           string, or undef if there are no signals or <u>$packagename</u> is not a Glib::Object derivative.

       $string = podify_deprecated_by ($packagename, @deprecated_by)
           Creates a deprecation warning for $packagename, suggesting  using  the  items  inside  @deprecated_by
           instead.

       $string = podify_pods ($pods, $position)
           Helper  function  to  allow  specific  placement  of generic pod within the auto generated pages. Pod
           sections starting out with =for position XXX, where XXX is one of the following will be placed  at  a
           specified  position.  In the case of pod that is to be placed after a particular section that doesn't
           exist, that pod will be still be placed there.

           This function is called at all of the specified points through out the process of generating pod  for
           a  page.  Any  pod matching the <u>position</u> passed will be returned, undef if no matches were found.  If
           <u>position</u> is undef all pods without  specific  position  information  will  be  returned.  <u>pods</u>  is  a
           reference to an array of pod hashes.

       $string = podify_ancestors ($packagename)
           Pretty-prints  the  ancestry  of  <u>$packagename</u>  from the Glib type system's point of view.  This uses
           Glib::Type-&gt;list_ancestors; see that function's docs for an explanation of why that's different  from
           looking at @ISA.

           Returns the new text as a string, or undef if <u>$packagename</u> is not a registered GType.

       $string = podify_interfaces ($packagename)
           Pretty-print  the list of GInterfaces that <u>$packagename</u> implements.  Returns the text as a string, or
           undef if the type implements no interfaces.

       $string = podify_methods ($packagename)
           Call  "xsub_to_pod"  on  all  the  xsubs  under  the  key  <u>$packagename</u>  in  the  data  extracted  by
           xsdocparse.pl.

           Returns the new text as a string, or undef if there are no xsubs in <u>$packagename</u>.

       $string = podify_see_alsos (@entries)
           Creates  a  list of links to be placed in the SEE ALSO section of the page.  Returns undef if nothing
           is in the input list.

       $string = get_copyright
           Returns a string that will/should be placed on each page.  You can control the text of this string by
           calling the class method <u>set_copyright</u>.

           If no text has been set, we will attempt to create one  for  you,  using  what  has  been  passed  to
           <u>set_year</u>,  <u>set_authors</u>, and <u>set_main_mod</u>.  The year defaults to the current year, the authors default
           to 'The Gtk2-Perl Team', and the main mod is empty by default.  You want the main mod to  be  set  to
           the  main  module  of  your  extension  for the SEE ALSO section, and on the assumption that a decent
           license notice can be found in that module's doc, we point the reader there.

           So, in general, you will want to specify at least one of these, so that you don't credit your work to
           us under the LGPL.

           To set them do something similar to the following in the first part  of  your  postamble  section  in
           Makefile.PL.   All occurrences of &lt;br&gt; in the copyright are replaced with newlines, to make it easier
           to put in a multi-line string.

             POD_SET=Glib::GenPod::set_copyright(qq{Copyright 1999 team-foobar&lt;br&gt;LGPL});

           <b>Glib::MakeHelper::postamble_docs_full()</b> does this sort of thing for you.

   <b>Helpers</b>
       $perl_type = convert_type ($ctypestring)
           Convert a C type name to a Perl type name.

           Uses   %Glib::GenPod::basic_types   to   look   for   some    known    basic    types,    and    uses
           Glib::Type-&gt;package_from_cname  to look up the registered package corresponding to a C type name.  If
           no suitable mapping can be found, this just returns the input string.

       $string = xsub_to_pod ($xsub, $sigprefix='')
           Convert an xsub hash into a string of pod describing  it.   Includes  the  call  signature,  argument
           listing,  and  description,  honoring  special  switches  in  the  description pod (arg and signature
           overrides).

       $string = compile_signature ($xsub)
           Given an xsub hash, return a string with the call signature for that xsub.

       $string = fixup_arg_name ($name)
           Prepend a $ to anything that's not the literal ellipsis string '...'.

       fixup_default
           Mangle default parameter values from C to Perl values.  Mostly, this does NULL =&gt; undef.

       convert_arg_type
           C type to Perl type conversion for argument types.

       convert_return_type_to_name
           C type to Perl type conversion suitable for return types.
