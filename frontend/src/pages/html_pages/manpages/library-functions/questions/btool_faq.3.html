       btool_faq - Frequently-Asked Questions about btparse and Text::BibTeX

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This document attempts to address questions that I have been asked several times, and are easy to answer
       -- but not by perusing the documentation.  For various reasons, the answers tend to be thinly distributed
       across several man pages, making it difficult to figure out what's going on.  Hence, this man page will
       attempt to tie together various strands of thought, providing quick, focused, "How do I do X?"  answers
       as opposed to lengthy descriptions of the capabilities and conventions of the btOOL libraries.

</pre><h4><b>PERL</b> <b>LIBRARY</b></h4><pre>
       This section covers questions that users of "Text::BibTeX", the Perl component of <b>btOOL</b>, have asked.

   <b>Why</b> <b>aren't</b> <b>the</b> <b>BibTeX</b> <b>"month"</b> <b>macros</b> <b>defined?</b>
       Because they're bibliography-specific, and "Text::BibTeX" by default doesn't impose any assumptions about
       a particular type of database or data-processing domain on your entries.  The problem arises when you
       parse entries from a file, say <u>foo.bib</u> that quite sensibly use the month macros ("jan", "feb", etc.)
       provided by the BibTeX standard style files:

          $bibfile = Text::BibTeX::File-&gt;new('foo.bib')    # open file
             or die "foo.bib: $!\n";
          $entry = Text::BibTeX::Entry-&gt;new($bibfile);     # parse first entry

       Using this code, you might get an "undefined macro" warning for every entry parsed from <u>foo.bib</u>.  Apart
       from the superficial annoyance of all those warning messages, the undefined macros are expanded as empty
       strings, meaning you lose any information about them---not good.

       You could always kludge it and forcibly define the month macros yourself.  Prior to release 0.30, this
       had to be done by parsing a set of fake entries, but now "Text::BibTeX" provides a direct interface to
       the underlying macro table.  You <u>could</u> just do this before parsing any entries:

          use Text::BibTeX qw(:macrosubs);
          # ...
          my %month = (jan =&gt; 'January', feb =&gt; 'February', ... );
          add_macro_text ($macro, $value)
             while (($macro, $value) = each %month);

       But there's a better way that's more in keeping with how things are done under BibTeX (where default
       macros are defined in the style file): use "Text::BibTeX"'s object-oriented analogue to style files,
       called structure modules.  "Text::BibTeX" provides a structure module, "Text::BibTeX::Bib", that
       (partially) emulates the standard style files of BibTeX 0.99, including the definition of month macros.
       Structure modules are specified on a per-file basis by using the "set_structure" method on a
       "Text::BibTeX::File" object.  It's quite simple to tell "Text::BibTeX" that entries from $bibfile are
       expected to conform to the "Bib" structure (which is implemented by the "Text::BibTeX::Bib" module, but
       you don't really need to know that):

          $bibfile = Text::BibTeX::File-&gt;new('foo.bib')
             or die "foo.bib: $!\n";
          $bibfile-&gt;set_structure ('Bib');

       You probably shouldn't hardcode the name of a particular structure in your programs, though, as there
       will eventually be a multitude of structure modules to choose from (just as there are a multitude of
       BibTeX style files to choose from).  My preferred approach is to make the structure a command-line option
       which defaults to "Bib" (since that's the only structure actually implemented as of this writing).

   <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>append</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>BibTeX</b> <b>file?</b>
       Just open it in append mode, and write entries to it as usual.  Remember, a "Text::BibTeX::File" object
       is mainly a wrapper around an "IO::File" object, and the "Text::BibTeX::File::open" method (and thus
       "new" as well) is just a front-end to "IO::File::open".  "IO::File::open", in turn, is a front-end either
       to Perl's builtin "open" (if called with one argument) or "sysopen" (two or three arguments).  To save
       you the trouble of going off and reading all those man pages, here's the trick: if you pass just a
       filename to "Text::BibTeX::File"'s "new" method, then it's treated just like a filename passed to Perl's
       builtin "open":

          my $append_file = Text::BibTeX::File-&gt;new("&gt;&gt;$filename")
             or die "couldn't open $filename for appending: $!\n";

       opens $filename for appending.  If, later on, you have an entry from another file (say $entry), then you
       can append it to $append_file by just writing it as usual:

          $entry-&gt;write ($append_file);

       See "append_entries" in the <u>examples/</u> subdirectory of the "Text::BibTeX" distribution for a complete
       example.

       This section covers frequently-asked questions about <b>btparse</b>, the C component of <b>btOOL</b>.

   <b>Is</b> <b>there</b> <b>a</b> <b>Python</b> <b>binding</b> <b>for</b> <b>btparse</b> <b>yet?</b>
       Not that I know of.  I haven't written one.  If you do so, please let me know about it.
