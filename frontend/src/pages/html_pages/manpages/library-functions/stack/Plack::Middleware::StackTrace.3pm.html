       Plack::Middleware::StackTrace - Displays stack trace when your app dies

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         enable "StackTrace";

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This middleware uses $SIG{__DIE__} to intercept <u>all</u> exceptions (run-time errors) happening in your
       application, even those that are caught.  For each exception it builds a detailed stack trace.

       If the applications aborts by throwing an exception it will be caught and matched against the saved stack
       traces. If a match is found it will be displayed as a nice stack trace screen, if not then the exception
       will be reported without a stack trace.

       The stack trace is also stored in the environment as a plaintext and HTML under the key
       "plack.stacktrace.text" and "plack.stacktrace.html" respectively, so that middleware further up the stack
       can reference it.

       This middleware is enabled by default when you run plackup in the default <u>development</u> mode.

       You're recommended to use this middleware during the development and use
       Plack::Middleware::HTTPExceptions in the deployment mode as a replacement, so that all the exceptions
       thrown from your application still get caught and rendered as a 500 error response, rather than crashing
       the web server.

       Catching errors in streaming response is not supported.

   <b>Stack</b> <b>Trace</b> <b>Module</b>
       The Devel::StackTrace::WithLexicals module will be used to capture the stack trace if the installed
       version is 0.08 or later. Otherwise Devel::StackTrace is used.

   <b>Performance</b>
       Gathering the information for a stack trace via Devel::StackTrace is slow, and
       Devel::StackTrace::WithLexicals is significantly slower still.  This is not usually a concern in
       development and when exceptions are rare.  However, your application may include code that's throwing and
       catching exceptions that you're not aware of. Such code will run <u>significantly</u> slower with this module.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       force
             enable "StackTrace", force =&gt; 1;

           Force display the stack trace when an error occurs within your application and the response code from
           your application is 500. Defaults to off.

           The  use  case  of  this  option  is  that when your framework catches all the exceptions in the main
           handler and returns all failures in your code as a normal 500 PSGI error  response.  In  such  cases,
           this  middleware  would  never  have  a  chance  to  display  errors because it can't tell if it's an
           application error or just random "eval" in your code. This option enforces the middleware to  display
           stack trace even if it's not the direct error thrown by the application.

       no_print_errors
             enable "StackTrace", no_print_errors =&gt; 1;

           Skips  printing  the  text stacktrace to console ("psgi.errors"). Defaults to 0, which means the text
           version of the stack trace error is printed to the errors handle, which usually is a standard error.
