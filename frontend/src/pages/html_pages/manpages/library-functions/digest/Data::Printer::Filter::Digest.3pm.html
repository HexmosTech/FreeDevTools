</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Data::Printer::Filter::Digest - pretty-printing MD5, SHA and many other digests

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       In your ".dataprinter" file:

           filters = Digest

       You may also setup the look and feel with the following options:

           filter_digest.show_class_name = 0
           filter_digest.show_reset      = 1

           # you can even customize your themes:
           colors.digest = #27ac3c

       That's it!

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This is a filter plugin for Data::Printer. It filters through several message digest objects and displays
       their current value in hexadecimal format as a string.

   <b>Parsed</b> <b>Modules</b>
       Any module that inherits from Digest::base. The following ones are actively supported:

       •   Digest::Adler32

       •   Digest::MD2

       •   Digest::MD4

       •   Digest::MD5

       •   Digest::SHA

       •   Digest::SHA1

       •   Digest::Whirlpool

       If you have any suggestions for more modules or better output, please let us know.

   <b>Extra</b> <b>Options</b>
       Aside  from  the  display  color,  there are a few other options to be customized via the "filter_digest"
       option key:

       <u>show_class_name</u>

       If set to true (the default) the class name will be displayed right next to the hexadecimal digest.

       <u>show_reset</u>

       If set to true (the default), the filter will add a "[reset]" tag after dumping an empty  digest  object.
       See the rationale below.

   <b>Note</b> <b>on</b> <b>dumping</b> <b>Digest::*</b> <b>objects</b>
       The  digest operation is effectively a destructive, read-once operation. Once it has been performed, most
       Digest::* objects are automatically reset and can be used to calculate another digest value.

       This behaviour - or, rather, forgetting about this behaviour - is a common source of issues when  working
       with Digests.

       This  Data::Printer  filter will <b>not</b> destroy your object. Instead, we work on a <u>cloned</u> version to display
       the hexdigest, leaving your original object untouched.

       As another debugging convenience for developers, since the empty object will produce a digest even  after
       being  used,  this  filter  adds  by  default  a "[reset]" tag to indicate that the object is empty, in a
       'reset' state - i.e. its hexdigest is the same as the hexdigest of a  new,  empty  object  of  that  same
       class.
