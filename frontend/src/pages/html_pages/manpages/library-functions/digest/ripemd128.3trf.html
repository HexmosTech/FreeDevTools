       ripemd-128 - Message digest "ripemd-128"

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       package require <b>Tcl</b>  <b>?8.2?</b>

       package require <b>Trf</b>  <b>?2.1.3?</b>

       <b>ripemd-128</b> ?<u>options...</u>? ?<u>data</u>?

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  command  <b>ripemd-128</b> is one of several message digests provided by the package <b>trf</b>. See <b>trf-intro</b> for
       an overview of the whole package.

       <b>ripemd-128</b> ?<u>options...</u>? ?<u>data</u>?
              The options listed below are understood by the digest if and only if the digest is <u>attached</u>  to  a
              channel.  See section <b>IMMEDIATE</b> <b>versus</b> <b>ATTACHED</b> for an explanation of the term <u>attached</u>.

              <b>-mode</b> <b>absorb</b>|<b>write</b>|<b>transparent</b>
                     This  option  has  to  be  present.  The specified argument determines the behaviour of the
                     digest in <u>attached</u> mode.

                     Beyond the argument values listed above all unique abbreviations are recognized too.  Their
                     meaning is explained below:

                     <b>absorb</b> All data written to the channel is used to calculate the value of the message digest
                            and  then passed unchanged to the next level in the stack of transformations for the
                            channel the digest is attached to.  When the channel is closed the completed  digest
                            is  written  out  too,  essentially  attaching  the  vlaue  of the diggest after the
                            information actually written to the channel.

                            When reading from the channel a value for the digest  is  computed  too,  and  after
                            closing  of  the channel compared to the digest which was attached, i.e. came behind
                            the actual data.  The option <b>-matchflag</b> has to be specified so that the digest knows
                            where to store the result of said comparison. This result is  a  string  and  either
                            "<b>ok</b>", or "<b>failed</b>".

                     <b>write</b>  All  data  read  from or written to the channel the digest is attached to is ignored
                            and thrown away. Only a value for the digest of the  data  is  computed.   When  the
                            channel  is  closed  the  computed  values are stored as ordered through the options
                            <b>-write-destination</b>, <b>-write-type</b>, <b>-read-destination</b>, and <b>-read-type</b>.

                     <b>transparent</b>
                            This mode is a mixture of both <b>absorb</b> and <b>write</b> modes. As for <b>absorb</b> all data,  read
                            or written, passes through the digest unchanged. The generated values for the digest
                            however are handled in the same way as for <b>write</b>.

              <b>-matchflag</b> <u>varname</u>
                     This  option  can  be  used  if  and  only if the option "<b>-mode</b> <b>absorb</b>" is present. In that
                     situation the argument is the name of a global or  namespaced  variable.  The  digest  will
                     write  the  result  of  comparing  two digest values into this variable. The option will be
                     ignored if the channel is write-only, because in that case there will be no  comparison  of
                     digest values.

              <b>-write-type</b> <b>variable</b>|<b>channel</b>
                     This  option can be used for digests in mode <b>write</b> or <b>transparent</b>. Beyond the values listed
                     above all their unique abbreviations are also  allowed  as  argument  values.   The  option
                     determines the type of the argument to option <b>-write-destination</b>. It defaults to <b>variable</b>.

              <b>-read-type</b> <b>variable</b>|<b>channel</b>
                     Like option <b>-write-type</b>, but for option <b>-read-destination</b>.

              <b>-write-destination</b> <u>data</u>
                     This option can be used for digests in mode <b>write</b> or <b>transparent</b>.  The value <u>data</u> is either
                     the  name  of  a  global  (or  namespaced)  variable  or  the handle of a writable channel,
                     dependent on the value of option <b>-write-type</b>. The message digest computed for data  written
                     to  the  attached  channel  is  written into it after the attached channel was closed.  The
                     option is ignored if the channel is read-only.

                     <u>Note</u> that using a variable may yield incorrect results under tcl 7.6, due to embedded \0's.

              <b>-read-destination</b> <u>data</u>
                     This option can be used for digests in mode <b>write</b> or <b>transparent</b>.  The value <u>data</u> is either
                     the name of a global (or  namespaced)  variable  or  the  handle  of  a  writable  channel,
                     dependent on the value of option <b>-read-type</b>. The message digest computed for data read from
                     the  attached channel is written into it after the attached channel was closed.  The option
                     is ignored if the channel is write-only.

                     <u>Note</u> that using a variable may yield incorrect results under tcl 7.6, due to embedded \0's.

       The options listed below are always understood by the digest, <u>attached</u> versus <u>immediate</u> does not  matter.
       See section <b>IMMEDIATE</b> <b>versus</b> <b>ATTACHED</b> for explanations of these two terms.

              <b>-attach</b> <u>channel</u>
                     The   presence/absence   of   this  option  determines  the  main  operation  mode  of  the
                     transformation.

                     If present the transformation will be stacked onto the <u>channel</u> whose handle  was  given  to
                     the option and run in <u>attached</u> mode. More about this in section <b>IMMEDIATE</b> <b>versus</b> <b>ATTACHED</b>.

                     If the option is absent the transformation is used in <u>immediate</u> mode and the options listed
                     below are recognized. More about this in section <b>IMMEDIATE</b> <b>versus</b> <b>ATTACHED</b>.

              <b>-in</b> <u>channel</u>
                     This  options  is  legal  if  and  only if the transformation is used in <u>immediate</u> mode. It
                     provides the handle of the channel the data to transform has to be read from.

                     If the transformation is in <u>immediate</u> mode and this option is absent the data to  transform
                     is expected as the last argument to the transformation.

              <b>-out</b> <u>channel</u>
                     This  options  is  legal  if  and  only if the transformation is used in <u>immediate</u> mode. It
                     provides the handle of the channel the generated transformation result is written to.

                     If the transformation is in <u>immediate</u> mode and this option is absent the generated data  is
                     returned as the result of the command itself.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       See <u><a href="http://www.esat.kuleuven.ac.be/">http://www.esat.kuleuven.ac.be/</a>%7Ebosselae/ripemd160.html</u> for additional information.

</pre><h4><b>IMMEDIATE</b> <b>VERSUS</b> <b>ATTACHED</b></h4><pre>
       The  transformation distinguishes between two main ways of using it. These are the <u>immediate</u> and <u>attached</u>
       operation modes.

       For the <u>attached</u> mode the option <b>-attach</b> is  used  to  associate  the  transformation  with  an  existing
       channel.  During  the  execution  of  the  command no transformation is performed, instead the channel is
       changed in such a way, that from then on all  data  written  to  or  read  from  it  passes  through  the
       transformation  and  is modified by it according to the definition above.  This attachment can be revoked
       by executing the command <b>unstack</b> for the chosen channel. This is the only way  to  do  this  at  the  Tcl
       level.

       In  the  second  mode,  which  can  be  detected  by  the  absence  of option <b>-attach</b>, the transformation
       immediately takes data from either its commandline or a channel, transforms it, and  returns  the  result
       either  as  result  of  the  command, or writes it into a channel.  The mode is named after the immediate
       nature of its execution.

       Where the data is taken from, and delivered to, is governed by the presence and absence  of  the  options
       <b>-in</b> and <b>-out</b>.  It should be noted that this ability to immediately read from and/or write to a channel is
       an historic artifact which was introduced at the beginning of Trf's life when Tcl version 7.6 was current
       as  this  and  earlier  versions  have  trouble  to deal with \0 characters embedded into either input or
       output.
