                      ( 1 + ( n - 1 )*abs( INCX ) ).
                      Before entry, the incremented array X must contain the n
                      element vector x.

           <u>INCX</u>

                     INCX is INTEGER
                      On entry, INCX specifies the increment for the elements of
                      X. INCX must not be zero.

           <u>Y</u>

                     Y is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension at least
                      ( 1 + ( n - 1 )*abs( INCY ) ).
                      Before entry, the incremented array Y must contain the n
                      element vector y.

           <u>INCY</u>

                     INCY is INTEGER
                      On entry, INCY specifies the increment for the elements of
                      Y. INCY must not be zero.

           <u>A</u>

                     A is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension ( LDA, N )
                      Before entry with  UPLO = 'U' or 'u', the leading n by n
                      upper triangular part of the array A must contain the upper
                      triangular part of the hermitian matrix and the strictly
                      lower triangular part of A is not referenced. On exit, the
                      upper triangular part of the array A is overwritten by the
                      upper triangular part of the updated matrix.
                      Before entry with UPLO = 'L' or 'l', the leading n by n
                      lower triangular part of the array A must contain the lower
                      triangular part of the hermitian matrix and the strictly
                      upper triangular part of A is not referenced. On exit, the
                      lower triangular part of the array A is overwritten by the
                      lower triangular part of the updated matrix.
                      Note that the imaginary parts of the diagonal elements need
                      not be set, they are assumed to be zero, and on exit they
                      are set to zero.

           <u>LDA</u>

                     LDA is INTEGER
                      On entry, LDA specifies the first dimension of A as declared
                      in the calling (sub) program. LDA must be at least
                      max( 1, n ).
