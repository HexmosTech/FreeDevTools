       <b>DLASD2</b> merges the two sets of singular values together into a single sorted set. Used by sbdsdc.

       <b>Purpose:</b>

            DLASD2 merges the two sets of singular values together into a single
            sorted set.  Then it tries to deflate the size of the problem.
            There are two ways in which deflation can occur:  when two or more
            singular values are close together or if there is a tiny entry in the
            Z vector.  For each such occurrence the order of the related secular
            equation problem is reduced by one.

            DLASD2 is called from DLASD1.

                    solve for the new right singular vectors. VT2 is arranged into
                    three blocks. The first block contains a row that corresponds
                    to the special 0 diagonal element in SIGMA; the second block
                    contains non-zeros only at and before NL +1; the third block
                    contains non-zeros only at and after  NL +2.

           <u>LDVT2</u>

                     LDVT2 is INTEGER
                    The leading dimension of the array VT2.  LDVT2 &gt;= M.

           <u>IDXP</u>

                     IDXP is INTEGER array, dimension (N)
                    This will contain the permutation used to place deflated
                    values of D at the end of the array. On output IDXP(2:K)
                    points to the nondeflated D-values and IDXP(K+1:N)
                    points to the deflated singular values.

           <u>IDX</u>

                     IDX is INTEGER array, dimension (N)
                    This will contain the permutation used to sort the contents of
                    D into ascending order.

           <u>IDXC</u>

                     IDXC is INTEGER array, dimension (N)
                    This will contain the permutation used to arrange the columns
                    of the deflated U matrix into three groups:  the first group
                    contains non-zero entries only at and above NL, the second
                    contains non-zero entries only below NL+2, and the third is
                    dense.

           <u>IDXQ</u>

                     IDXQ is INTEGER array, dimension (N)
                    This contains the permutation which separately sorts the two
                    sub-problems in D into ascending order.  Note that entries in
                    the first hlaf of this permutation must first be moved one
                    position backward; and entries in the second half
                    must first have NL+1 added to their values.

           <u>COLTYP</u>

                     COLTYP is INTEGER array, dimension (N)
                    As workspace, this will contain a label which will indicate
                    which of the following types a column in the U2 matrix or a
                    row in the VT2 matrix is:
                    1 : non-zero in the upper half only
                    2 : non-zero in the lower half only
                    3 : dense
                    4 : deflated

                    On exit, it is an array of dimension 4, with COLTYP(I) being
                    the dimension of the I-th type columns.

           <u>INFO</u>

                     INFO is INTEGER
                     = 0:  successful exit.
                     &lt; 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value.
