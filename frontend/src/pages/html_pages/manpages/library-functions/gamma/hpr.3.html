                     UPLO is CHARACTER*1
                      On entry, UPLO specifies whether the upper or lower
                      triangular part of the matrix A is supplied in the packed
                      array AP as follows:

                                             supplied in AP.

                      element vector x.

           <u>INCX</u>

                     INCX is INTEGER

                      ( ( n*( n + 1 ) )/2 ).
                      Before entry with  UPLO = 'U' or 'u', the array AP must
                      contain the upper triangular part of the hermitian matrix
                      packed sequentially, column by column, so that AP( 1 )
                      contains a( 1, 1 ), AP( 2 ) and AP( 3 ) contain a( 1, 2 )
                      and a( 2, 2 ) respectively, and so on. On exit, the array
                      AP is overwritten by the upper triangular part of the
                      updated matrix.
                      Before entry with UPLO = 'L' or 'l', the array AP must
                      contain the lower triangular part of the hermitian matrix
                      packed sequentially, column by column, so that AP( 1 )

                      and a( 3, 1 ) respectively, and so on. On exit, the array
                      AP is overwritten by the lower triangular part of the
                      updated matrix.
                      Note that the imaginary parts of the diagonal elements need
                      not be set, they are assumed to be zero, and on exit they
                      are set to zero.
