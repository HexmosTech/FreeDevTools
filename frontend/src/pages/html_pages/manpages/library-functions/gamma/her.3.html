               A := alpha*x*x**H + A,

            where alpha is a real scalar, x is an n element vector and A is an
            n by n hermitian matrix.

       <b>Parameters</b>

                     UPLO is CHARACTER*1
                      On entry, UPLO specifies whether the upper or lower
                      triangular part of the array A is to be referenced as
                      follows:

                         UPLO = 'U' or 'u'   Only the upper triangular part of A
                                             is to be referenced.

                         UPLO = 'L' or 'l'   Only the lower triangular part of A

                     N is INTEGER
                      On entry, N specifies the order of the matrix A.

                      ( 1 + ( n - 1 )*abs( INCX ) ).
                      Before entry, the incremented array X must contain the n
                      element vector x.

                      Note that the imaginary parts of the diagonal elements need
                      not be set, they are assumed to be zero, and on exit they
                      are set to zero.

                     UPLO is CHARACTER*1
                      On entry, UPLO specifies whether the upper or lower
                      triangular part of the array A is to be referenced as
                      follows:

                         UPLO = 'U' or 'u'   Only the upper triangular part of A
                                             is to be referenced.

                         UPLO = 'L' or 'l'   Only the lower triangular part of A
                                             is to be referenced.

                     N is INTEGER
                      On entry, N specifies the order of the matrix A.

                      ( 1 + ( n - 1 )*abs( INCX ) ).
                      Before entry, the incremented array X must contain the n
                      element vector x.

           <u>INCX</u>

                     INCX is INTEGER
                      On entry, INCX specifies the increment for the elements of

                      triangular part of the hermitian matrix and the strictly
                      lower triangular part of A is not referenced. On exit, the
                      upper triangular part of the array A is overwritten by the
                      upper triangular part of the updated matrix.
                      Before entry with UPLO = 'L' or 'l', the leading n by n

                      lower triangular part of the array A is overwritten by the
                      lower triangular part of the updated matrix.
                      Note that the imaginary parts of the diagonal elements need
                      not be set, they are assumed to be zero, and on exit they
                      are set to zero.

                     LDA is INTEGER
                      On entry, LDA specifies the first dimension of A as declared
                      in the calling (sub) program. LDA must be at least
                      max( 1, n ).
