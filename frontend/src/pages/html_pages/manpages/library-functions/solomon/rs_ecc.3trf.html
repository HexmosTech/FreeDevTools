</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       rs_ecc - Reed-Solomon error correcting code

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       package require <b>Tcl</b>  <b>?8.2?</b>

       package require <b>Trf</b>  <b>?2.1.3?</b>

       <b>rs_ecc</b> ?<u>options...</u>? ?<u>data</u>?

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  command  <b>rs_ecc</b>  provides a reed-solomon error correcting coder. The coder operates on blocks of 248
       bytes each, therefore buffering 247 bytes.

       <b>rs_ecc</b> ?<u>options...</u>? ?<u>data</u>?

              <b>-mode</b> <b>encode</b>|<b>decode</b>
                     This option has to be present and is always understood.

                     For <u>immediate</u> mode the argument value specifies the operation  to  use.   For  an  <u>attached</u>
                     encoding  it specifies the operation to use for <u>writing</u>. Reading will automatically use the
                     reverse operation.  See section <b>IMMEDIATE</b> <b>versus</b> <b>ATTACHED</b> for  explanations  of  these  two
                     terms.

                     Beyond the argument values listed above all unique abbreviations are recognized too.

                     <b>Encode</b>  converts  from arbitrary (most likely binary) data into a representation containing
                     additional error correcting information, <b>decode</b> does the reverse, and  performs  the  error
                     correction if necessary.

              <b>-attach</b> <u>channel</u>
                     The   presence/absence   of   this  option  determines  the  main  operation  mode  of  the
                     transformation.

                     If present the transformation will be stacked onto the <u>channel</u> whose handle  was  given  to
                     the option and run in <u>attached</u> mode. More about this in section <b>IMMEDIATE</b> <b>versus</b> <b>ATTACHED</b>.

                     If the option is absent the transformation is used in <u>immediate</u> mode and the options listed
                     below are recognized. More about this in section <b>IMMEDIATE</b> <b>versus</b> <b>ATTACHED</b>.

              <b>-in</b> <u>channel</u>
                     This  options  is  legal  if  and  only if the transformation is used in <u>immediate</u> mode. It
                     provides the handle of the channel the data to transform has to be read from.

                     If the transformation is in <u>immediate</u> mode and this option is absent the data to  transform
                     is expected as the last argument to the transformation.

              <b>-out</b> <u>channel</u>
                     This  options  is  legal  if  and  only if the transformation is used in <u>immediate</u> mode. It
                     provides the handle of the channel the generated transformation result is written to.

                     If the transformation is in <u>immediate</u> mode and this option is absent the generated data  is
                     returned as the result of the command itself.

</pre><h4><b>IMMEDIATE</b> <b>VERSUS</b> <b>ATTACHED</b></h4><pre>
       The  transformation distinguishes between two main ways of using it. These are the <u>immediate</u> and <u>attached</u>
       operation modes.

       For the <u>attached</u> mode the option <b>-attach</b> is  used  to  associate  the  transformation  with  an  existing
       channel.  During  the  execution  of  the  command no transformation is performed, instead the channel is
       changed in such a way, that from then on all  data  written  to  or  read  from  it  passes  through  the
       transformation  and  is modified by it according to the definition above.  This attachment can be revoked
       by executing the command <b>unstack</b> for the chosen channel. This is the only way  to  do  this  at  the  Tcl
       level.

       In  the  second  mode,  which  can  be  detected  by  the  absence  of option <b>-attach</b>, the transformation
       immediately takes data from either its commandline or a channel, transforms it, and  returns  the  result
       either  as  result  of  the  command, or writes it into a channel.  The mode is named after the immediate
       nature of its execution.

       Where the data is taken from, and delivered to, is governed by the presence and absence  of  the  options
       <b>-in</b> and <b>-out</b>.  It should be noted that this ability to immediately read from and/or write to a channel is
       an historic artifact which was introduced at the beginning of Trf's life when Tcl version 7.6 was current
       as  this  and  earlier  versions  have  trouble  to deal with \0 characters embedded into either input or
       output.
