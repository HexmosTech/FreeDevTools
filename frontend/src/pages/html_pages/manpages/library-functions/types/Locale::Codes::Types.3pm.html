</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Locale::Codes::Types - types of data sets supported

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This document contains a description of different types of code sets supported by the <b>Locale-Codes</b>
       distribution.

       The following types are supported:

       "country"
       "language"
       "currency"
       "script"
       "langfam"
       "langvar"
       "langext"

       Any  time  you have to specify the type of data, use one of the values from this list.  When using the OO
       interface, you have to specify the type of data you are working with.  For example:

          use Locale::Codes;
          ...
          $obj-&gt;type('country');
          $obj-&gt;type('langext');

       When using the traditional interfaces, the functions all have the data  type  included  in  the  function
       name.  For example:

          use Locale::Codes::Country;
          code2country(...);

          use Locale::Codes::LangExt;
          code2langext(...);

       Each  type of data may have any number of code sets.  Code sets may be specified by name.  Traditionally,
       a perl constant was exported and could also be used to specify the code set.

       Both methods are available for both the OO and traditional interfaces, so whenever a function  or  method
       takes an argument specifying a code set, either the name or a constant can be used.

       In  the lists below, a code set is specified in the list by including the name and the constant.  So, for
       example, the first country code set is named 'alpha-2' and has a perl  constant  "LOCALE_COUNTRY_ALPHA_2"
       associated  with it.  When using the OO interface, the constants are only available if you import them by
       loading the module with:

          use Locale::Codes ':constants';

       The constants are always available when using the traditional interfaces.

       Some of the older perl constants names were not  consistent,  and  in  those  cases,  two  constants  are
       available (a newer consistent name and the older inconsistent one).  Either may be used.

       The default code set for each type is marked with an asterisk (*).

</pre><h4><b>country</b></h4><pre>
       Code sets for identifying countries are maintained by several different agencies and standards.

       The following code sets are maintained in the ISO 3166 standard.  The official home page for the ISO 3166
       maintenance agency is: &lt;<a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards/country_codes.htm">http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards/country_codes.htm</a>&gt; .

       Only the officially assigned codes are included.

       <b>*</b> <b>alpha-2,</b> <b>LOCALE_COUNTRY_ALPHA_2,</b> <b>LOCALE_CODE_ALPHA_2</b>
           This is the set of two-letter (lowercase) codes from ISO 3166-1, such as 'tv' for Tuvalu.

       <b>alpha-3,</b> <b>LOCALE_COUNTRY_ALPHA_3,</b> <b>LOCALE_CODE_ALPHA_3</b>
           This  is the set of three-letter (lowercase) codes from ISO 3166-1, such as 'brb' for Barbados. These
           codes are actually defined and maintained by the U.N. Statistics division.

       <b>numeric,</b> <b>LOCALE_COUNTRY_NUMERIC,</b> <b>LOCALE_CODE_NUMERIC</b>
           This is the set of three-digit numeric codes from ISO 3166-1, such as 064 for Bhutan.

           If a 2-digit code is entered, it is converted to 3 digits by prepending a 0.

       A list of domain names are maintained by the IANA  (Internet  Assigned  Numbers  Authority).   These  are
       available  at:  &lt;<a href="http://www.iana.org/domains/root/db/">http://www.iana.org/domains/root/db/</a>&gt; .  Only the actual country codes are used, and the
       country names come from ISO 3166.

       <b>dom,</b> <b>LOCALE_COUNTRY_DOM,</b> <b>LOCALE_CODE_DOM</b>
           The country domains assigned by IANA are usually the two-letter (lowercase) codes from ISO 3166,  but
           there are a few other additions.

       The  United  Nations also maintains country lists.  Their list is also similar, but not identical, to the
       ISO 3166 list.

       The data is available here: &lt;https://unstats.un.org/unsd/methodology/m49/&gt;

       Previously, this table was treated as a source of the ISO 3166 data, but  I  found  that  the  table  was
       incomplete, so I stopped using it.  Later, it was added back in as it's own list of codes.

       <b>un-alpha-3,</b> <b>LOCALE_COUNTRY_UN_ALPHA_3,</b> <b>LOCALE_CODE_UN_ALPHA_3</b>
           This is similar to the 'alpha-3' set from ISO 3166, except that the codes are uppercase.

       <b>un-numeric,</b> <b>LOCALE_COUNTRY_UN_NUMERIC,</b> <b>LOCALE_CODE_UN_NUMERIC</b>
           This is similar to the 'numeric' set from ISO 3166.

       The  US  Government also keeps a list of codes.  Originally, it maintained the FIPS-11 code set, but this
       was deprecated and replaced by the GENC code set.  The FIPS-11 code  sets  are  no  longer  supported  by
       <b>Locale-Codes</b>.

       The  GENC code sets are available here: &lt;https://nsgreg.nga.mil/genc/discovery&gt; .  They are also similar,
       but not identical, to the ISO 3166 code sets.

       <b>genc-alpha-2,</b> <b>LOCALE_COUNTRY_GENC_ALPHA_2,</b> <b>LOCALE_CODE_GENC_ALPHA_2</b>
           Similar to the 'alpha-2' set, but uppercase.

       <b>genc-alpha-3,</b> <b>LOCALE_COUNTRY_GENC_ALPHA_3,</b> <b>LOCALE_CODE_GENC_ALPHA_3</b>
           Similar to the 'alpha-3' set, but uppercase.

       <b>genc-numeric,</b> <b>LOCALE_COUNTRY_GENC_NUMERIC,</b> <b>LOCALE_CODE_GENC_NUMERIC</b>
           Similar to the 'numeric' set.

       There are other sources of codes that are not currently used in this distribution.

       ISO codes for country sub-divisions (states, counties, provinces, etc), as defined in ISO  3166-2.   This
       module   is   not   part   of   the   Locale-Codes   distribution,   but   is   available  from  CPAN  in
       CPAN/modules/by-module/Locale/

       The World Factbook maintained by  the  CIA  is  a  potential  source  of  the  data.   Unfortunately,  it
       adds/preserves    non-standard    codes,    so    it    is    not    used    as   a   source   of   data.
       &lt;https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/appendix/appendix-d.html&gt;

       Another unofficial source  of  data  is  the  Statoids  web  site:  &lt;<a href="http://www.statoids.com/wab.html">http://www.statoids.com/wab.html</a>&gt;  .
       Currently,  it  is  not  used  to  get  data, but the notes and explanatory material were very useful for
       understanding discrepancies between the sources.

</pre><h4><b>language</b></h4><pre>
       Code sets for identifying languages come from a couple different locations.

       The   primary   source   is   ISO   639   .     The    ISO    639-2    codes    are    available    here:
       &lt;<a href="http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/">http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/</a>&gt;    and    the    ISO    639-5    codes   are   available   here:
       &lt;<a href="http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-5/">http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-5/</a>&gt; .

       In addition, the IANA maintains a language registry which are added to the  ISO  lists.   Because  it  is
       intended to supplement the ISO standard, the IANA list is not separate.

       The IANA data is available here: &lt;<a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry">http://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry</a>&gt;

       The code sets are:

       <b>*</b> <b>alpha-2,</b> <b>LOCALE_LANGUAGE_ALPHA_2,</b> <b>LOCALE_LANG_ALPHA_2</b>
           This  is  the  set  of two-letter (lowercase) codes from ISO 639-1, such as 'he' for Hebrew.  It also
           includes additions to this set included in the IANA language registry.

       <b>alpha-3,</b> <b>LOCALE_LANGUAGE_ALPHA_3,</b> <b>LOCALE_LANG_ALPHA_3</b>
           This is the set of three-letter (lowercase) bibliographic codes from ISO 639-2  and  639-5,  such  as
           'heb' for Hebrew.  It also includes additions to this set included in the IANA language registry.

       <b>term,</b> <b>LOCALE_LANGUAGE_TERM,</b> <b>LOCALE_LANG_TERM</b>
           This is the set of three-letter (lowercase) terminologic codes from ISO 639.

</pre><h4><b>currency</b></h4><pre>
       The     source     of     currency     codes     is     the     ISO    4217    data    available    here:
       &lt;https://www.six-group.com/en/products-services/financial-information/data-standards.html&gt;

       The code sets are:

       <b>*</b> <b>alpha,</b> <b>LOCALE_CURRENCY_ALPHA,</b> <b>LOCALE_CURR_ALPHA</b>
           This is a set of three-letter (uppercase) codes from ISO 4217 such as EUR for Euro.

           Two of the codes specified by the standard (XTS which is reserved for testing purposes and XXX  which
           is for transactions where no currency is involved) are omitted.

       <b>num,</b> <b>LOCALE_CURRENCY_NUMERIC,</b> <b>LOCALE_CURR_NUMERIC</b>
           This is the set of three-digit numeric codes from ISO 4217.

</pre><h4><b>script</b></h4><pre>
       The source of script code sets is ISO 15924 available here: &lt;<a href="http://www.unicode.org/iso15924/">http://www.unicode.org/iso15924/</a>&gt;

       Additional       data       comes       from       the      IANA      language      subtag      registry:
       &lt;<a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry">http://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry</a>&gt; .

       Code sets are:

       <b>*</b> <b>alpha,</b> <b>LOCALE_SCRIPT_ALPHA</b>
           This is a set of four-letter (capitalized) codes from ISO 15924 such as 'Phnx'  for  Phoenician.   It
           also includes additions to this set included in the IANA language registry.

           The Zxxx, Zyyy, and Zzzz codes are not used.

       <b>num,</b> <b>LOCALE_SCRIPT_NUMERIC</b>
           This is a set of three-digit numeric codes from ISO 15924 such as 115 for Phoenician.

</pre><h4><b>langfam</b></h4><pre>
       Language     families    are    specified    using    codes    from    ISO    639-5    available    here:
       &lt;<a href="http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-5/id.php">http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-5/id.php</a>&gt;

       Code sets are:

       <b>*</b> <b>alpha,</b> <b>LOCALE_LANGFAM_ALPHA</b>
           This is the set of three-letter (lowercase) codes from ISO 639-5 such as 'apa' for Apache languages.

</pre><h4><b>langvar</b></h4><pre>
       Language variations are specified using codes from he  IANA  language  subtag  registry  available  here:

       Code sets are:

       <b>*</b> <b>alpha,</b> <b>LOCALE_LANGVAR_ALPHA</b>
           This  is the set of alphanumeric codes from the IANA language registry, such as 'arevela' for Eastern
           Armenian.

</pre><h4><b>langext</b></h4><pre>
       Language extensions are specified using codes from he  IANA  language  subtag  registry  available  here:
       &lt;<a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry">http://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry</a>&gt;

       Code sets are:

       <b>*</b> <b>alpha,</b> <b>LOCALE_LANGEXT_ALPHA</b>
           This  is the set of three-letter (lowercase) codes from the IANA language registry, such as 'acm' for
           Mesopotamian Arabic.

</pre><h4><b>NEW</b> <b>CODE</b> <b>SETS</b></h4><pre>
       I'm always open to suggestions for new code sets.

       In order for me to add a code set, I want the following criteria to be met:

       <b>General-use</b> <b>code</b> <b>set</b>
           If a code set is not general use, I'm not likely to spend the time to add and support it.

       <b>An</b> <b>official</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b>
           I require an official (or at least, a NEARLY official) source where I can get the data on  a  regular
           basis.

           Ideally,  I'd  only get data from an official source, but sometimes that is not possible. For example
           the ISO standards are not typically available for free, so I may have to get some of that  data  from
           alternate  sources  that  I'm  confident are getting their data from the official source.  However, I
           will always be hesitant to accept a non-official source.

           As an example, I used to get some country data from the CIA World Factbook. Given the nature  of  the
           source, I'm sure they're updating data from the official sources and I consider it "nearly" official.
           However,  even  in this case, I found that they were adding codes that were not part of the standard,
           so I have stopped using them as a source.

           There are many 3rd party sites which maintain lists (many of which are actually in a more  convenient
           form  than  the  official sites).  Unfortunately, I will reject most of them since I have no feel for
           how "official" they are.

       <b>A</b> <b>free</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>data</b>
           Obviously, the data must be free-of-charge. I'm not interested in paying for the data  (and  I'm  not
           interested in the overhead of having someone else pay for the data for me).

       <b>A</b> <b>reliable</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b>
           The  source of data must come from a source that I can reasonably expect to exist for the foreseeable
           future since I will be extremely reluctant to drop support for a data set once it's included.

           I am also reluctant to accept data sent to me by an individual.  Although I appreciate the offer,  it
           is  simply  not  practical  to  consider an individual contribution as a reliable source of data. The
           source should be an official agency of some sort.

       These requirements are open to discussion. If you have a code set you'd like to see added, but which  may
       not  meet  all  of  the  above  requirements,  feel  free to email me and we'll discuss it.  Depending on
       circumstances, I may be willing to waive some of these criteria.
