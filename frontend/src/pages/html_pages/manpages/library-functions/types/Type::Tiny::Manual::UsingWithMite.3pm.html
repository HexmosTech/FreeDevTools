       Type::Tiny::Manual::UsingWithMite - how to use Type::Tiny with Mite

</pre><h4><b>MANUAL</b></h4><pre>
       Mite takes an unorthodox approach to object-oriented code. When you first start a project with Mite
       (which we'll assume is called Your::Project), Mite will create a module called Your::Project::Mite for
       you.

       Then all your classes use code like:

          package Your::Project::Widget;

          use Your::Project::Mite -all;

          has name =&gt; (
             is =&gt; ro,
             isa =&gt; 'Str',
          );

          has id =&gt; (
             is =&gt; ro,
             isa =&gt; 'PositiveInt',
          );

          signature_for warble =&gt; (
             named =&gt; [
                foo   =&gt; 'Int',
                bar   =&gt; 'ArrayRef',
             ],
          );

          sub warble {
             my ( $self, $arg ) = @_;
             printf( "%s: %d\n", $self-&gt;name, $arg-&gt;foo );
             return;
          }

          1;

       After writing or editing each class or role, you run the command "mite compile" and Mite will output a
       collection of compiled Perl classes which have no non-core dependencies (on Perl 5.14+. There are a
       couple of non-core dependencies on older versions of Perl.)

       Attribute "isa" options are Type::Tiny type constraints expressed as strings. Mite looks them up during
       compilation using "dwim_type" from Type::Utils, and pre-loads Types::Standard, Types::Common::String, and
       Types::Common::Numeric for you.

       The "signature_for" keyword is similar to the corresponding function in Type::Params. Again, note that
       types are expressed as strings and looked up using "dwim_type".

       Any types which are inlineable should work. If using coercion, any coercions which are inlineable should
       work.

   <b>Custom</b> <b>Types</b> <b>in</b> <b>Mite</b>
       You can define your own type library (say, Your::Project::Types) using Type::Library as normal:

          package Your::Project::Types;

          use Type::Library
             -extends =&gt; [ 'Types::Standard', 'Types::Common::Numeric' ];

          __PACKAGE__-&gt;add_type(
             name    =&gt; 'Widget',
             parent  =&gt; InstanceOf['Your::Project::Widget'],
          )-&gt;coercion-&gt;add_type_coercions(
             HashRef, q{Your::Project::Widget-&gt;new($_)},
          );

          __PACKAGE__-&gt;make_immutable;

          1;

       Now if your classes load Your::Project::Types they'll suddenly have a dependency on Type::Library, so you
       don't get that nice zero-dependency feeling. But you can add this to your ".mite/config" file:

          types: Your::Project::Types

       Now Mite will know to load that type library at compile time, and will make those types available as
       stringy types everywhere.

   <b>Compiled</b> <b>Type</b> <b>Libraries</b>
       It does look really pretty to not have to quote your type constraints:

          has name =&gt; (
             is   =&gt; ro,
             isa  =&gt; Str,
          );

       One solution for that is Type::Library::Compiler.

       Say you've created the custom type library above, you can use Type::Library::Compiler to compile it into
       a module called Your::Project::Types::Compiled, which just uses Exporter and doesn't rely on
       Type::Library or any other part of Type::Tiny.

       Then your Widget class can use that:

          package Your::Project::Widget;

          use Your::Project::Mite -all;
          use Your::Project::Types::Compiled -types;

          has name =&gt; (
             is   =&gt; ro,
             isa  =&gt; Str,
          );

          has id =&gt; (
             is   =&gt; ro,
             isa  =&gt; PositiveInt,
          );

          signature_for warble =&gt; (
             named =&gt; [
                foo   =&gt; Int,
                bar   =&gt; ArrayRef,
             ],
          );

          sub warble {
             my ( $self, $arg ) = @_;
             printf( "%s: %d\n", $self-&gt;name, $arg-&gt;foo );
             return;
          }

          1;

       The compiled type libraries are more limited than real type libraries.  You can't, for example, do
       parameterized types with them. However, they still offer some cool features like:

          Foo-&gt;check( $value )     # a few basic methods like this
          is_Foo( $value )         # boolean checks
          assert_Foo( $value )     # assertions which die
          Foo | Bar                # unions!

       This way you can write a project with object orientation, roles, method modifiers, type-checked
       attributes, type-checked signatures, and even coercion, with no non-core dependencies! (The tools like
       Mite and Type::Library::Compiler are only needed by the developer, not the end user.)

           Including how to Type::Tiny in your object's "BUILD" method, and third-party shims between Type::Tiny
           and Class::Tiny.
