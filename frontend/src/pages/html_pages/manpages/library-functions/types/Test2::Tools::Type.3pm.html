</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Test2::Tools::Type - Tools for checking data types

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Test2::V0;
           use Test2::Tools::Type;

           is_integer(1, "is 1 integer?");         # pass, yes it is
           is_integer('1', "is '1' an integer?");  # fail, no it's a string

           SKIP: {
               skip "Your perl is too old" unless(bool_supported());
               is_bool(1 == 2, "is false a Boolean?");   # pass, yes it is
               is_bool(3.1415, "is pi a Boolean?");      # fail, no it isn't
           }

           like
               { should_be_int =&gt; 1, other_stuff =&gt; "we don't care about this" },
               hash {
                   field should_be_int =&gt; type('integer');
               },
               "is the should_be_int field an integer?";

       or if you want even more check functions:

           use Test2::V0;
           use Test2::Tools::Type qw(:extras);

           is_hashref($foo);

</pre><h4><b>OVERVIEW</b></h4><pre>
       Sometimes you don't want to be too precise in your tests, you just want to check that your code returns
       the right type of result but you don't care whether it's returning 192 or 193 - just checking that it
       returns an integer is good enough.

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       All these are exported by default.

   <b>bool_supported</b>
       Returns true if your perl is recent enough to have the Boolean type, false otherwise. It will be true if
       your perl is version 5.35.7 or higher.

   <b>is_bool</b>
       Emits a test pass if its argument is a Boolean - ie is the result of a comparison - and a fail otherwise.

       It is a fatal error to call this on a perl that is too old. If your tests need to run on perl 5.35.6 or
       earlier then you will need to check "bool_supported" before using it. See the "SYNOPSIS" above.

   <b>is_integer</b>
       Emits a test pass if its argument is an integer and a fail otherwise. Note that it can tell the
       difference between 1 (an integer) and '1' (a string).

   <b>is_number</b>
       Emits a test pass if its argument is a number and a fail otherwise. Note that it can tell the difference
       between 1 (a number), 1.2 (also a number) and '1' (a string).

   <b>type</b>
       Returns a check that you can use in a test such as:

           like
               { int =&gt; 1 },
               hash { field int =&gt; type('integer'); },
               "the 'int' field is an integer";

       You can negate the test with a "!" thus. This test will fail:

           like
               { int =&gt; 1 },
               hash { field int =&gt; !type('integer'); },
               "the 'int' field is an integer";

       You can supply more than one argument, so if you want to check that something is a <u>positive</u> integer, for
       example, you can do:

           is(94, type(qw(positive integer)));

       You can check something's type and value:

           # this uses 'number' from Test2::Tools::Compare
           is($foo, type('integer', <a href="../man94/number.94.html">number</a>(94)));

       And indeed you can use any other Test2 checker:

           # 'in_set' also comes from Test2::Tools::Compare
           is($foo, type('integer', in_set(1, 5, 8)));

       Valid arguments are any other Test2 checker (specifically, anything that inherits from
       Test2::Compare::Base), and any of the "is_*" methods' names, with the leading "is_" removed. You can see
       a list of supported types thus:

           $ perl -MTest2::Tools::Type=show_types

       or to include the extra functions:

           $ perl -MTest2::Tools::Type=show_types,:extras

</pre><h4><b>EXTRA</b> <b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       By default the only check functions you get are those that are thin wrappers around Scalar::Type. If you
       pass the ":extras" argument at "use"-time then all the following are available as well:

   <b>regex_supported</b>
       Returns true if your perl can reliably report the difference between a regex and a reference to a scalar,
       or false otherwise. It will be true if your perl is version 5.12 or higher.

   <b>is_positive,</b> <b>is_negative</b>
       Emit a test pass/fail depending on the argument's sign. Note that 0 is considered neither positive nor
       negative.

   <b>is_zero</b>
       Emit a pass/fail depending on whether the argument is zero.

   <b>is_ref</b>
       Emit a pass/fail depending on whether the argument is a reference. This includes blessed objects.

   <b>is_object</b>
       Emit a pass/fail depending on whether the argument is a blessed object.

   <b>is_regex</b>
       Emit a test pass if its argument is a regex, and a fail otherwise.

       It is a fatal error to call this on a perl that is too old. If your tests need to run on perl 5.10.1 or
       earlier then you will need to check "regex_supported" before using it.

   <b>is_hashref,</b> <b>is_arrayref,</b> <b>is_scalarref,</b> <b>is_coderef,</b> <b>is_globref,</b> <b>is_regex,</b> <b>is_refref</b>
       Emit a pass/fail if the argumet is a reference to something of the appropriate type.

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
       The definitions of Boolean, integer and number are exactly the same as those in Scalar::Type, which this
       is a thin wrapper around.

       Blessed objects will match both "is_object" and the appropriate "is_*ref". If you need to check that
       something is a ref, but is <u>not</u> blessed, do something like:

           is($foo, type(hashref =&gt; !type('object')));
