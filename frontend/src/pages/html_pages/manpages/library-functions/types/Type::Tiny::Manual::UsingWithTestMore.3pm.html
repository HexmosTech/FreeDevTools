       Type::Tiny::Manual::UsingWithTestMore - Type::Tiny for test suites

</pre><h4><b>MANUAL</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Test::TypeTiny</b>
       This is a module for testing that types you've defined accept and reject the values you think they
       should.

        should_pass($value, $type);
        should_fail($othervalue, $type);

       Easy. (But yeah, I always forget whether the type goes first or second!)

       There's also a function to test that subtype/supertype relationships are working okay.

        ok_subtype($type, @subtypes);

       Of course you can just check a type like this:

        ok( $type-&gt;check($value) );

       But the advantage of "should_pass" is that if the "EXTENDED_TESTING" environment variable is set to true,
       "should_pass" will also perform a strict check on the value, which involves climbing up the type's
       inheritance tree (its parent, its parent's parent, etc) to make sure the value passes all their
       constraints.

       If a normal check and strict check differ, this is usually a problem in the inlining code somewhere.

       See Test::TypeTiny for more information.

   <b>Type::Tiny</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>Replacement</b> <b>for</b> <b>Test::Deep</b>
       Here's one of the examples from the Test::Deep documentation:

        my $name_re = re('^(Mr|Mrs|Miss) \w+ \w+$');
        cmp_deeply(
          $person,
          {
            Name       =&gt; $name_re,
            Phone      =&gt; re('^0d{6}$'),
            ChildNames =&gt; array_each($name_re)
          },
          "person ok"
        );

       It's pretty easy to rewrite this to use Types::Standard:

        my $name = StrMatch[ qr/^(Mr|Mrs|Miss) \w+ \w+$/ ];
        should_pass(
          $person,
          Dict[
            Name         =&gt; $name,
            Phone        =&gt; StrMatch[ qr/^0d{6}$/ ],
            ChildNames   =&gt; ArrayRef[$name]
          ]
        );

       There's nothing especially wrong with Test::Deep, but if you're already familiar with Type::Tiny's built-
       in types and you've maybe written your own type libraries too, it will save you having to switch between
       using two separate systems of checks.

       Here's your next step:

       â€¢   Type::Tiny::Manual::Params

           Advanced  information  on  Type::Params,  and  using  Type::Tiny  with  other  signature modules like
           Function::Parameters and Kavorka.
