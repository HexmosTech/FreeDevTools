</pre><h4><b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       This module is covered by the Type-Tiny stability policy.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This documents the internals of the Type::Tiny class. Type::Tiny::Manual is a better starting place if
       you're new.

       Type::Tiny is a small class for creating Moose-like type constraint objects which are compatible with
       Moo, Moose and Mouse.

          use Scalar::Util qw(looks_like_number);
          use Type::Tiny;

          my $NUM = "Type::Tiny"-&gt;new(
             name       =&gt; "Number",
             constraint =&gt; sub { looks_like_number($_) },
             message    =&gt; sub { "$_ ain't a number" },
          );

          package Ermintrude {
             use Moo;
             has favourite_number =&gt; (is =&gt; "ro", isa =&gt; $NUM);
          }

          package Bullwinkle {
             use Moose;
             has favourite_number =&gt; (is =&gt; "ro", isa =&gt; $NUM);
          }

          package Maisy {
             use Mouse;
             has favourite_number =&gt; (is =&gt; "ro", isa =&gt; $NUM);
          }

       Type::Tiny conforms to Type::API::Constraint, Type::API::Constraint::Coercible,
       Type::API::Constraint::Constructor, and Type::API::Constraint::Inlinable.

       Maybe now we won't need to have separate MooseX, MouseX and MooX versions of everything? We can but
       hope...

   <b>Constructor</b>
       new(%attributes)
           Moose-style constructor function.

   <b>Attributes</b>
       Attributes  are  named  values  that  may  be  passed  to the constructor. For each attribute, there is a
       corresponding reader method. For example:

          my $type = Type::Tiny-&gt;new( name =&gt; "Foo" );
          print $type-&gt;name, "\n";   # says "Foo"

       <u>Important</u> <u>attributes</u>

       These are the attributes you are likely to be most interested in providing when creating  your  own  type
       constraints, and most interested in reading when dealing with type constraint objects.

       "constraint"
           Coderef  to validate a value ($_) against the type constraint.  The coderef will not be called unless
           the value is known to pass any parent type constraint (see "parent" below).

           Alternatively, a string of Perl code checking $_ can be passed as a parameter to the constructor, and
           will be converted to a coderef.

           Defaults to "sub { 1 }" - i.e. a coderef that passes all values.

       "parent"
           Optional attribute; parent type constraint. For example, an "Integer" type constraint  might  have  a
           parent "Number".

           If provided, must be a Type::Tiny object.

       "inlined"
           A coderef which returns a string of Perl code suitable for inlining this type. Optional.

           (The  coderef  will be called in list context and can actually return a list of strings which will be
           joined with "&amp;&amp;". If the first item on the list is undef, it will  be  substituted  with  the  type's
           parent's inline check.)

           If  "constraint"  (above)  is  a  coderef  generated  via  Sub::Quote, then Type::Tiny <u>may</u> be able to
           automatically generate "inlined" for you.  If "constraint" (above) is a string, it will be able to.

       "name"
           The name of the type constraint. These need to conform to certain naming rules (they must begin  with
           an uppercase letter and continue using only letters, digits 0-9 and underscores).

           Optional; if not supplied will be an anonymous type constraint.

       "display_name"
           A name to display for the type constraint when stringified. These don't have to conform to any naming
           rules. Optional; a default name will be calculated from the "name".

       "library"
           The  package  name  of  the type library this type is associated with.  Optional. Informational only:
           setting this attribute does not install the type into the package.

       "deprecated"
           Optional boolean indicating whether a type constraint is  deprecated.   Type::Library  will  issue  a
           warning  if  you attempt to import a deprecated type constraint, but otherwise the type will continue
           to function as normal.  There will not be deprecation warnings every time you validate a  value,  for
           instance. If omitted, defaults to the parent's deprecation status (or false if there's no parent).

       "message"
           Coderef that returns an error message when $_ does not validate against the type constraint. Optional
           (there's a vaguely sensible default.)

       "coercion"
           A Type::Coercion object associated with this type.

           Generally  speaking  this  attribute  should not be passed to the constructor; you should rely on the
           default lazily-built coercion object.

           You may pass "coercion =&gt; 1" to the constructor to inherit coercions from  the  constraint's  parent.
           (This requires the parent constraint to have a coercion.)

       "sorter"
           A  coderef  which can be passed two values conforming to this type constraint and returns -1, 0, or 1
           to put them in order. Alternatively an arrayref containing a pair of coderefs â€” a sorter and  a  pre-
           processor for the Schwarzian transform. Optional.

           The idea is to allow for:

             @sorted = Int-&gt;sort( 2, 1, 11 );    # =&gt; 1, 2, 11
             @sorted = Str-&gt;sort( 2, 1, 11 );    # =&gt; 1, 11, 2

       "type_default"
           A  coderef  which  returns a sensible default value for this type. For example, for a <b>Counter</b> type, a
           sensible default might be "0":

             my $Size = Type::Tiny-&gt;new(
               name          =&gt; 'Size',
               parent        =&gt; Types::Standard::Enum[ qw( XS S M L XL ) ],
               type_default  =&gt; sub { return 'M'; },
             );

             package Tshirt {
               use Moo;
               has size =&gt; (
                 is       =&gt; 'ro',
                 isa      =&gt; $Size,
                 default  =&gt; $Size-&gt;type_default,
               );
             }

           Child types will inherit a type default from their parent unless the child has a "constraint".  If  a
           type neither has nor inherits a type default, then calling "type_default" will return undef.

           As a special case, this:

             $type-&gt;type_default( @args )

           Will return:

             sub {
               local $_ = \@args;
               $type-&gt;type_default-&gt;( @_ );
             }

           Many of the types defined in Types::Standard and other bundled type libraries have type defaults, but
           discovering them is left as an exercise for the reader.

       "my_methods"
           Experimental hashref of additional methods that can be called on the type constraint object.

       "exception_class"
           The   class   used  to  throw  an  exception  when  a  value  fails  its  type  check.   Defaults  to
           "Error::TypeTiny::Assertion", which is usually good. This class is expected to provide  a  "throw_cb"
           method compatible with the method of that name in Error::TypeTiny.

           If  a  parent  type  constraint  has a custom "exception_class", then this will be "inherited" by its
           children.

       <u>Attributes</u> <u>related</u> <u>to</u> <u>parameterizable</u> <u>and</u> <u>parameterized</u> <u>types</u>

       The following additional attributes are used for parameterizable  (e.g.   "ArrayRef")  and  parameterized
       (e.g. "ArrayRef[Int]") type constraints. Unlike Moose, these aren't handled by separate subclasses.

       "constraint_generator"
           Coderef that is called when a type constraint is parameterized. When called, it is passed the list of
           parameters,  though any parameter which looks like a foreign type constraint (Moose type constraints,
           Mouse type constraints, etc, <u>and</u> <u>coderefs(!!!)</u>) is first coerced to a native Type::Tiny object.

           Note that for compatibility with the Moose API, the  base  type  is  <u>not</u>  passed  to  the  constraint
           generator,  but  can  be  found  in  the  package  variable $Type::Tiny::parameterize_type. The first
           parameter is also available as $_.

           Types <u>can</u> be parameterized with an empty parameter list. For example, in Types::Standard, "Tuple"  is
           just  an  alias  for  "ArrayRef"  but  "Tuple[]"  will  only  allow zero-length arrayrefs to pass the
           constraint.  If you wish "YourType" and "YourType[]" to mean the same thing, then do:

            return $Type::Tiny::parameterize_type unless @_;

           The constraint generator should generate and return a new constraint coderef based on the parameters.
           Alternatively, the constraint generator can return a fully-formed Type::Tiny object,  in  which  case
           the  "name_generator",  "inline_generator",  and "coercion_generator" attributes documented below are
           ignored.

           Optional; providing a generator makes this type into a parameterizable type constraint. If  there  is
           no generator, attempting to parameterize the type constraint will throw an exception.

       "name_generator"
           A coderef which generates a new display_name based on parameters. Called with the same parameters and
           package variables as the "constraint_generator".  Expected to return a string.

           Optional; the default is reasonable.

       "inline_generator"
           A coderef which generates a new inlining coderef based on parameters. Called with the same parameters
           and package variables as the "constraint_generator".  Expected to return a coderef.

           Optional.

       "coercion_generator"
           A  coderef  which  generates  a  new Type::Coercion object based on parameters.  Called with the same
           parameters and package variables as the "constraint_generator". Expected to return a blessed object.

           Optional.

       "deep_explanation"
           This API is not finalized. Coderef used by Error::TypeTiny::Assertion to  peek  inside  parameterized
           types and figure out why a value doesn't pass the constraint.

       "parameters"
           In parameterized types, returns an arrayref of the parameters.

       <u>Lazy</u> <u>generated</u> <u>attributes</u>

       The  following  attributes should not be usually passed to the constructor; unless you're doing something
       especially unusual, you should rely on the default lazily-built return values.

       "compiled_check"
           Coderef to validate a value ($_[0]) against the type constraint.  This coderef is  expected  to  also
           handle all validation for the parent type constraints.

       "definition_context"
           Hashref  of  information indicating where the type constraint was originally defined. Type::Tiny will
           generate this based on "caller" if you do not supply it. The hashref  will  ordinarily  contain  keys
           "package", "file", and "line".

           For  parameterized  types  and  compound  types  (e.g.  unions  and  intersections),  this may not be
           especially meaningful information.

       "complementary_type"
           A complementary type for this type. For example, the complementary type for an integer type would  be
           all  things  that  are  not  integers, including floating point numbers, but also alphabetic strings,
           arrayrefs, filehandles, etc.

       "moose_type", "mouse_type"
           Objects  equivalent  to   this   type   constraint,   but   as   a   Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint   or
           Mouse::Meta::TypeConstraint.

           It  should rarely be necessary to obtain a Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint object from Type::Tiny because
           the Type::Tiny object itself should be usable pretty much anywhere a  Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint  is
           expected.

   <b>Methods</b>
       <u>Predicate</u> <u>methods</u>

       These  methods  return  booleans  indicating information about the type constraint. They are each tightly
       associated with a particular attribute.  (See "Attributes".)

       "has_parent", "has_library", "has_inlined", "has_constraint_generator", "has_inline_generator",
       "has_coercion_generator", "has_parameters", "has_message", "has_deep_explanation", "has_sorter"
           Simple Moose-style predicate methods indicating the presence or absence of an attribute.

       "has_coercion"
           Predicate method with a little extra DWIM. Returns false if the coercion is a no-op.

       "is_anon"
           Returns true iff the type constraint does not have a "name".

       "is_parameterized", "is_parameterizable"
           Indicates whether a type has been parameterized (e.g. "ArrayRef[Int]") or could potentially be  (e.g.
           "ArrayRef").

       "has_parameterized_from"
           Useless alias for "is_parameterized".

       <u>Validation</u> <u>and</u> <u>coercion</u>

       The following methods are used for coercing and validating values against a type constraint:

       check($value)
           Returns true iff the value passes the type constraint.

       validate($value)
           Returns  the  error  message  for  the  value; returns an explicit undef if the value passes the type
           constraint.

       assert_valid($value)
           Like check($value) but dies if the value does not pass the type constraint.

           Yes, that's three very similar methods. Blame Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint whose API I'm attempting to
           emulate. :-)

       assert_return($value)
           Like assert_valid($value) but returns the value if it passes the type constraint.

           This  seems  a  more  useful  behaviour  than  assert_valid($value).  I  would  have   just   changed
           assert_valid($value)  to  do  this,  except  that  there  are  edge  cases where it could break Moose
           compatibility.

       get_message($value)
           Returns the error message for the value; even if the value passes the type constraint.

       "validate_explain($value, $varname)"
           Like "validate" but instead of a string error message, returns an arrayref of strings explaining  the
           reasoning why the value does not meet the type constraint, examining parent types, etc.

           The $varname is an optional string like '$foo' indicating the name of the variable being checked.

       coerce($value)
           Attempt to coerce $value to this type.

       assert_coerce($value)
           Attempt to coerce $value to this type. Throws an exception if this is not possible.

       <u>Child</u> <u>type</u> <u>constraint</u> <u>creation</u> <u>and</u> <u>parameterization</u>

       These methods generate new type constraint objects that inherit from the constraint they are called upon:

       create_child_type(%attributes)
           Construct a new Type::Tiny object with this object as its parent.

       where($coderef)
           Shortcut  for  creating  an  anonymous  child  type  constraint.  Use  it  like "HashRef-&gt;where(sub {
           exists($_-&gt;{name}) })". That said, you can get a similar result using overloaded "&amp;":

              HashRef &amp; sub { exists($_-&gt;{name}) }

           Like the "constraint" attribute, this will accept a string of Perl code:

              HashRef-&gt;where('exists($_-&gt;{name})')

       "child_type_class"
           The class that create_child_type will construct by default.

       parameterize(@parameters)
           Creates a new parameterized type; throws an exception if called on a non-parameterizable type.

       of(@parameters)
           A cute alias for "parameterize". Use it like "ArrayRef-&gt;of(Int)".

       "plus_coercions($type1, $code1, ...)"
           Shorthand for creating a new child type constraint with the same coercions  as  this  one,  but  then
           adding some extra coercions (at a higher priority than the existing ones).

       "plus_fallback_coercions($type1, $code1, ...)"
           Like "plus_coercions", but added at a lower priority.

       "minus_coercions($type1, ...)"
           Shorthand for creating a new child type constraint with fewer type coercions.

       "no_coercions"
           Shorthand for creating a new child type constraint with no coercions at all.

       <u>Type</u> <u>relationship</u> <u>introspection</u> <u>methods</u>

       These  methods  allow  you  to determine a type constraint's relationship to other type constraints in an
       organised hierarchy:

       equals($other), is_subtype_of($other), is_supertype_of($other), is_a_type_of($other)
           Compare two types. See Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint for what  these  all  mean.   (OK,  Moose  doesn't
           define "is_supertype_of", but you get the idea, right?)

           Note  that these have a slightly DWIM side to them. If you create two Type::Tiny::Class objects which
           test the same class, they're considered equal. And:

              my $subtype_of_Num = Types::Standard::Num-&gt;create_child_type;
              my $subtype_of_Int = Types::Standard::Int-&gt;create_child_type;
              $subtype_of_Int-&gt;is_subtype_of( $subtype_of_Num );  # true

       strictly_equals($other), is_strictly_subtype_of($other), is_strictly_supertype_of($other),
       is_strictly_a_type_of($other)
           Stricter versions of the type comparison functions. These only care about  explicit  inheritance  via
           "parent".

              my $subtype_of_Num = Types::Standard::Num-&gt;create_child_type;
              my $subtype_of_Int = Types::Standard::Int-&gt;create_child_type;
              $subtype_of_Int-&gt;is_strictly_subtype_of( $subtype_of_Num );  # false

       "parents"
           Returns  a  list  of  all  this type constraint's ancestor constraints. For example, if called on the
           "Str" type constraint would return the list "(Value, Defined, Item, Any)".

           <u>Due</u> <u>to</u> <u>a</u> <u>historical</u> <u>misunderstanding,</u> <u>this</u> <u>differs</u> <u>from</u> <u>the</u> <u>Moose</u>  <u>implementation</u>  <u>of</u>  <u>the</u>  <u>"parents"</u>
           <u>method.</u>  <u>In</u>  <u>Moose,</u>  <u>"parents"</u>  <u>only</u>  <u>returns</u> <u>the</u> <u>immediate</u> <u>parent</u> <u>type</u> <u>constraints,</u> <u>and</u> <u>because</u> <u>type</u>
           <u>constraints</u> <u>only</u> <u>have</u> <u>one</u> <u>immediate</u> <u>parent,</u> <u>this</u> <u>is</u> <u>effectively</u> <u>an</u> <u>alias</u> <u>for</u> <u>"parent".</u> <u>The</u>  <u>extension</u>
           <u>module</u>  <u>MooseX::Meta::TypeConstraint::Intersection</u>  <u>is</u> <u>the</u> <u>only</u> <u>place</u> <u>where</u> <u>multiple</u> <u>type</u> <u>constraints</u>
           <u>are</u> <u>returned;</u> <u>and</u> <u>they</u> <u>are</u> <u>returned</u> <u>as</u> <u>an</u> <u>arrayref</u> <u>in</u> <u>violation</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>base</u> <u>class'</u> <u>documentation.</u> <u>I'm</u>
           <u>keeping</u> <u>my</u> <u>behaviour</u> <u>as</u> <u>it</u> <u>seems</u> <u>more</u> <u>useful.</u>

       find_parent($coderef)
           Loops through the parent type constraints <u>including</u> <u>the</u>  <u>invocant</u>  <u>itself</u>  and  returns  the  nearest
           ancestor  type  constraint  where  the  coderef  evaluates  to  true. Within the coderef the ancestor
           currently being checked is $_. Returns undef if there is no match.

           In list context also returns the number of type constraints which had been looped through before  the
           matching constraint was found.

       "find_constraining_type"
           Finds  the  nearest  ancestor  type  constraint  (including the type itself) which has a "constraint"
           coderef.

           Equivalent to:

              $type-&gt;find_parent(sub { not $_-&gt;_is_null_constraint })

       "coercibles"
           Return a type constraint which is the union of type constraints that  can  be  coerced  to  this  one
           (including this one). If this type constraint has no coercions, returns itself.

       "type_parameter"
           In  parameterized  type  constraints,  returns  the  first  item on the list of parameters; otherwise
           returns undef. For example:

              ( ArrayRef[Int] )-&gt;type_parameter;    # returns Int
              ( ArrayRef[Int] )-&gt;parent;            # returns ArrayRef

           Note that parameterizable type  constraints  can  perfectly  legitimately  take  multiple  parameters
           (several of the parameterizable type constraints in Types::Standard do). This method only returns the
           first  such parameter.  "Attributes related to parameterizable and parameterized types" documents the
           "parameters" attribute, which returns an arrayref of all the parameters.

       "parameterized_from"
           Harder to spell alias for "parent" that only works for parameterized types.

       <u>Hint</u> <u>for</u> <u>people</u> <u>subclassing</u> <u>Type::Tiny:</u> Since version 1.006000,  the  methods  for  determining  subtype,
       supertype, and type equality should <u>not</u> be overridden in subclasses of Type::Tiny. This is because of the
       problem  of  diamond  inheritance.  If  X  and  Y are both subclasses of Type::Tiny, they <u>both</u> need to be
       consulted to figure out how type constraints are related; not just one of them should be overriding these
       methods. See the source code for Type::Tiny::Enum for an example of how subclasses can give  hints  about
       type  relationships  to  Type::Tiny.  Summary: push a coderef onto @Type::Tiny::CMP. This coderef will be
       passed two type constraints. It should then return one of the  constants  Type::Tiny::CMP_SUBTYPE  (first
       type  is  a  subtype of second type), Type::Tiny::CMP_SUPERTYPE (second type is a subtype of first type),
       Type::Tiny::CMP_EQUAL (the two types are exactly the same), Type::Tiny::CMP_EQUIVALENT (the two types are
       effectively the same), or Type::Tiny::CMP_UNKNOWN (your coderef couldn't establish any relationship).

       <u>Type</u> <u>relationship</u> <u>introspection</u> <u>function</u>

       "Type::Tiny::cmp($type1, $type2)"
           The subtype/supertype relationship between types results in a partial ordering of type constraints.

           This function will return one of the constants: Type::Tiny::CMP_SUBTYPE (first type is a  subtype  of
           second   type),   Type::Tiny::CMP_SUPERTYPE   (second   type   is   a   subtype   of   first   type),
           Type::Tiny::CMP_EQUAL (the two types are exactly the same), Type::Tiny::CMP_EQUIVALENT (the two types
           are effectively the same), or Type::Tiny::CMP_UNKNOWN  (couldn't  establish  any  relationship).   In
           numeric  contexts,  these  evaluate  to  -1, 1, 0, 0, and 0, making it potentially usable with "sort"
           (though you may need to silence warnings about treating the empty string as a numeric value).

       <u>List</u> <u>processing</u> <u>methods</u>

       grep(@list)
           Filters a list to return just the items that pass the type check.

             @integers = Int-&gt;grep(@list);

       first(@list)
           Filters the list to return the first item on the list that passes the type check, or  undef  if  none
           do.

             $first_lady = Woman-&gt;first(@people);

       map(@list)
           Coerces a list of items. Only works on types which have a coercion.

             @truths = Bool-&gt;map(@list);

       sort(@list)
           Sorts  a  list  of  items according to the type's preferred sorting mechanism, or if the type doesn't
           have a sorter coderef, uses the parent type. If no ancestor type constraint has a sorter,  throws  an
           exception. The "Str", "StrictNum", "LaxNum", and "Enum" type constraints include sorters.

             @sorted_numbers = Num-&gt;sort( Num-&gt;grep(@list) );

       rsort(@list)
           Like "sort" but backwards.

       any(@list)
           Returns true if any of the list match the type.

             if ( Int-&gt;any(@numbers) ) {
               say "there was at least one integer";
             }

       all(@list)
           Returns true if all of the list match the type.

             if ( Int-&gt;all(@numbers) ) {
               say "they were all integers";
             }

       assert_any(@list)
           Like  "any"  but  instead  of returning a boolean, returns the entire original list if any item on it
           matches the type, and dies if none does.

       assert_all(@list)
           Like "all" but instead of returning a boolean, returns the original list if all items on it match the
           type, but dies as soon as it finds one that does not.

       <u>Inlining</u> <u>methods</u>

       The following methods are used to generate strings  of  Perl  code  which  may  be  pasted  into  stringy
       "eval"uated subs to perform type checks:

       "can_be_inlined"
           Returns boolean indicating if this type can be inlined.

       inline_check($varname)
           Creates a type constraint check for a particular variable as a string of Perl code. For example:

              print( Types::Standard::Num-&gt;inline_check('$foo') );

           prints the following output:

              (!ref($foo) &amp;&amp; Scalar::Util::looks_like_number($foo))

           For Moose-compat, there is an alias "_inline_check" for this method.

       inline_assert($varname)
           Much like "inline_check" but outputs a statement of the form:

              ... or die ...;

           Can  also  be  called  line  "inline_assert($varname, $typevarname, %extras)".  In this case, it will
           generate a string of code that may include $typevarname which  is  supposed  to  be  the  name  of  a
           variable  holding the type itself. (This is kinda complicated, but it allows a useful string to still
           be produced if the type is not inlineable.) The %extras  are  additional  options  to  be  passed  to
           Error::TypeTiny::Assertion's  constructor  and must be key-value pairs of strings only, no references
           or undefs.

       <u>Other</u> <u>methods</u>

       "qualified_name"
           For non-anonymous type constraints that have a library, returns a qualified "MyLib::MyType"  sort  of
           name. Otherwise, returns the same as "name".

       isa($class), can($method), AUTOLOAD(@args)
           If   Moose   is   loaded,   then   the   combination   of   these   methods   is   used   to  mock  a
           Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint.

           If Mouse is loaded, then "isa" mocks Mouse::Meta::TypeConstraint.

       DOES($role)
           Overridden to advertise support for various roles.

           See also Type::API::Constraint, etc.

       "TIESCALAR", "TIEARRAY", "TIEHASH"
           These are provided as hooks that wrap Type::Tie. They allow the following to work:

              use Types::Standard qw(Int);
              tie my @list, Int;
              push @list, 123, 456;   # ok
              push @list, "Hello";    # dies

       exportables( $base_name )
           Returns a list of the functions a type library should export if it contains this type constraint.

           Example:

             [
               { name =&gt; 'Int',        tags =&gt; [ 'types' ],  code =&gt; sub { ... } },
               { name =&gt; 'is_Int',     tags =&gt; [ 'is' ],     code =&gt; sub { ... } },
               { name =&gt; 'assert_Int', tags =&gt; [ 'assert' ], code =&gt; sub { ... } },
               { name =&gt; 'to_Int',     tags =&gt; [ 'to' ],     code =&gt; sub { ... } },
             ]

           $base_name is optional, but allows you to get a list of exportables using a specific  name.  This  is
           useful if the type constraint has a name which wouldn't be a legal Perl function name.

       "exportables_by_tag( $tag, $base_name )"
           Filters  "exportables"  by a specific tag name. In list context, returns all matching exportables. In
           scalar context returns a single matching exportable and dies if multiple exportables match,  or  none
           do!

       The following methods exist for Moose/Mouse compatibility, but do not do anything useful.

       "compile_type_constraint"
       "hand_optimized_type_constraint"
       "has_hand_optimized_type_constraint"
       "inline_environment"
       "meta"

   <b>Overloading</b>
       â€¢   Stringification is overloaded to return the qualified name.

       â€¢   Boolification is overloaded to always return true.

       â€¢   Coderefification is overloaded to call "assert_return".

       â€¢   On Perl 5.10.1 and above, smart match is overloaded to call "check".

       â€¢   The "==" operator is overloaded to call "equals".

       â€¢   The "&lt;" and "&gt;" operators are overloaded to call "is_subtype_of" and "is_supertype_of".

       â€¢   The "~" operator is overloaded to call "complementary_type".

       â€¢   The "|" operator is overloaded to build a union of two type constraints.  See Type::Tiny::Union.

       â€¢   The   "&amp;"   operator   is  overloaded  to  build  the  intersection  of  two  type  constraints.  See
           Type::Tiny::Intersection.

       â€¢   The "/" operator provides magical Devel::StrictMode support.  If $ENV{PERL_STRICT} (or  a  few  other
           environment  variables)  is  true,  then  it  returns the left operand. Normally it returns the right
           operand.

       Previous  versions  of  Type::Tiny  would  overload  the  "+"  operator  to  call   "plus_coercions"   or
       "plus_fallback_coercions" as appropriate.  Support for this was dropped after 0.040.

   <b>Constants</b>
       "Type::Tiny::SUPPORT_SMARTMATCH"
           Indicates whether the smart match overload is supported on your version of Perl.

   <b>Package</b> <b>Variables</b>
       $Type::Tiny::DD
           This  undef  by  default  but may be set to a coderef that Type::Tiny and related modules will use to
           dump data structures in things like error messages.

           Otherwise Type::Tiny uses it's own routine to dump data structures.  $DD may then be set to a  number
           to limit the lengths of the dumps. (Default limit is 72.)

           This is a package variable (rather than get/set class methods) to allow for easy localization.

       $Type::Tiny::AvoidCallbacks
           If  this variable is set to true (you should usually do it in a "local" scope), it acts as a hint for
           type constraints, when generating inlined code, to  avoid  making  any  callbacks  to  variables  and
           functions defined outside the inlined code itself.

           This  should  have the effect that "$type-&gt;inline_check('$foo')" will return a string of code capable
           of checking the type on Perl installations that don't have Type::Tiny installed. This is intended  to
           allow Type::Tiny to be used with things like Mite.

           The  variable  works  on  the honour system. Types need to explicitly check it and decide to generate
           different   code   based   on   its   truth   value.   The   bundled   types   in    Types::Standard,
           Types::Common::Numeric, and Types::Common::String all do.  (<b>StrMatch</b> is sometimes unable to, and will
           issue a warning if it needs to rely on callbacks when asked not to.)

           Most normal users can ignore this.

       $Type::Tiny::SafePackage
           This  is the string "package Type::Tiny;" which is sometimes inserted into strings of inlined code to
           avoid namespace clashes. In most cases, you do not need to change this. However, if you are  inlining
           type constraint code, saving that code into Perl modules, and uploading them to CPAN, you may wish to
           change  it to avoid problems with the CPAN indexer. Most normal users of Type::Tiny do not need to be
           aware of this.

   <b>Environment</b>
       "PERL_TYPE_TINY_XS"
           Currently this has more effect on Types::Standard than Type::Tiny.  In  future  it  may  be  used  to
           trigger or suppress the loading XS implementations of parts of Type::Tiny.
