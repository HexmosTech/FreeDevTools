</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       MIME::Type - description of one MIME type

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        use MIME::Types;
        my $mimetypes = MIME::Types-&gt;new;
        my MIME::Type $plaintext = $mimetypes-&gt;type('text/plain');
        print $plaintext-&gt;mediaType;   # text
        print $plaintext-&gt;subType;     # plain

        my @ext = $plaintext-&gt;extensions;
        print "@ext"                   # txt asc c cc h hh cpp

        print $plaintext-&gt;encoding     # 8bit
        if($plaintext-&gt;isBinary)       # false
        if($plaintext-&gt;isAscii)        # true
        if($plaintext-&gt;equals('text/plain') {...}
        if($plaintext eq 'text/plain') # same

        print MIME::Type-&gt;simplified('x-appl/x-zip') #  'appl/zip'

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       MIME types are used in MIME entities, for instance as part of e-mail and HTTP traffic.  Sometimes real
       knowledge about a mime-type is need.  Objects of "MIME::Type" store the information on one such type.

</pre><h4><b>OVERLOADED</b></h4><pre>
       overload: <b>string</b> <b>comparison</b>
           When a MIME::Type object is compared to either a string or another MIME::Type, the <b>equals()</b> method is
           called.  Comparison is smart, which means that it extends common string comparison with some features
           which are defined in the related RFCs.

       overload: <b>stringification</b>
           The stringification (use of the object in a place where a string is required) will result in the type
           name, the same as <b>type()</b> returns.

           example: use of stringification

            my $mime = MIME::Type-&gt;new('text/html');
            print "$mime\n";   # explicit stringification
            print $mime;       # implicit stringification

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Initiation</b>
       MIME::Type-&gt;<b>new</b>(%options)
           Create (<u>instantiate</u>) a new MIME::Type object which manages one mime type.

            -Option    --Default
             charset     undef
             encoding    &lt;depends on type&gt;
             extensions  []
             simplified  &lt;derived from type&gt;
             system      undef
             type        &lt;required&gt;

           charset =&gt; $charset
             Specify the default charset for this type.

           encoding =&gt; '7bit'|'8bit'|'base64'|'quoted-printable'
             How  must  this  data  be encoded to be transported safely.  The default depends on the type: mimes
             with as main type "text/" will default to "quoted-printable" and all other to "base64".

           extensions =&gt; REF-ARRAY
             An array of extensions which are using this mime.

           simplified =&gt; STRING
             The mime types main- and sub-label can both start with "x-", to indicate that is  a  non-registered
             name.   Of  course,  after  registration  this flag can disappear which adds to the confusion.  The
             simplified string has the "x-" thingies removed and are translated to lower-case.

           system =&gt; REGEX
             Regular expression which defines for which systems this rule is valid.  The  REGEX  is  matched  on
             $^O.

           type =&gt; STRING
             The type which is defined here.  It consists of a <u>type</u> and a <u>sub-type</u>, both case-insensitive.  This
             module will return lower-case, but accept upper-case.

   <b>Attributes</b>
       $obj-&gt;<b>charset</b>()
           [2.28]  RFC6657  prescribes  that  IANA  registrations for text category types explicitly state their
           default character-set.  MIME-Types contains a manually produced list of these defaults.

           This method may also return "_REQUIRED", when there is no default, or "_FRAMED" when the  charset  is
           determined by the content.

       $obj-&gt;<b>encoding</b>()
           Returns the type of encoding which is required to transport data of this type safely.

       $obj-&gt;<b>extensions</b>()
           Returns a list of extensions which are known to be used for this mime type.

       $obj-&gt;<b>simplified</b>( [$string] )
       MIME::Type-&gt;<b>simplified</b>( [$string] )
           Returns  the  simplified  mime type for this object or the specified STRING.  Mime type names can get
           officially registered.  Until then, they have to carry an "x-" preamble to indicate that.  Of course,
           after recognition, the "x-" can disappear.  In many cases, we prefer the simplified  version  of  the
           type.

           example: results of <b>simplified()</b>

            my $mime = MIME::Type-&gt;new(type =&gt; 'x-appl/x-zip');
            print $mime-&gt;simplified;                     # 'appl/zip'

            print $mime-&gt;simplified('text/PLAIN');       # 'text/plain'
            print MIME::Type-&gt;simplified('x-xyz/x-abc'); # 'xyz/abc'

       $obj-&gt;<b>system</b>()
           Returns  the  regular  expression  which  can be used to determine whether this type is active on the
           system where you are working on.

       $obj-&gt;<b>type</b>()
           Returns the long type of this object, for instance 'text/plain'

   <b>Knowledge</b>
       $obj-&gt;<b>defaultCharset</b>()
           As per RFC6657, all "text/*" types must either specify a default charset in its IANA registration, or
           require the charset parameter.  Non-text types may require a charset as well.

           It is hard to extract this information from the IANA registration files automagically, so is manually
           maintained.

       $obj-&gt;<b>equals</b>($string|$mime)
           Compare this mime-type object with a STRING or other object.  In case  of  a  STRING,  simplification
           will take place.

       $obj-&gt;<b>isAscii</b>()
           Old name for <b>isText()</b>.

       $obj-&gt;<b>isBinary</b>()
           Returns true when the type is not known to be text.  See <b>isText()</b>.

       $obj-&gt;<b>isExperimental</b>()
           [2.00] Return "true" when the type is defined for experimental use; the subtype starts with "x."

       $obj-&gt;<b>isPersonal</b>()
           [2.00]  Return  "true"  when the type is defined by a person for private use; the subtype starts with
           "prs."

       $obj-&gt;<b>isRegistered</b>()
           Mime-types which are not registered by IANA nor defined in RFCs  shall  start  with  an  "x-".   This
           counts  for as well the media-type as the sub-type.  In case either one of the types starts with "x-"
           this method will return false.

       $obj-&gt;<b>isSignature</b>()
           Returns true when the type is in the list of known signatures.

       $obj-&gt;<b>isText</b>()
           [2.05] All types which may have the charset attribute, are text.   However,  there  is  currently  no
           record of attributes in this module... so we guess.

       $obj-&gt;<b>isVendor</b>()
           [2.00] Return "true" when the type is defined by a vendor; the subtype starts with "vnd."

       $obj-&gt;<b>mediaType</b>()
           The media type of the simplified mime.  For 'text/plain' it will return 'text'.

           For historical reasons, the 'mainType' method still can be used to retrieve the same value.  However,
           that method is deprecated.

       $obj-&gt;<b>subType</b>()
           The sub type of the simplified mime.  For 'text/plain' it will return 'plain'.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       Error: Type parameter is obligatory.
           When a MIME::Type object is created, the type itself must be specified with the "type" option flag.
