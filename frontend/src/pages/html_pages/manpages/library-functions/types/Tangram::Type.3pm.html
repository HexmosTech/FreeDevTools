       Tangram::Type - mapping individual fields

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Tangram's persistent type system is extensible, allowing you to mount your own types and make them
       persistent. All you have to do is to register your type and provide mapping code. See
       Tangram::Type::Extending.

       Tangram comes with built-in support for the following types:

       <b>Simple</b> <b>Scalar</b> <b>types</b>
           Supported are strings, integers, real numbers and dates.  More types of this ilk are easily added.

           "string", "int", "real": see Tangram::Type::Scalar

           "date", "time", "datetime", "dmdatetime": see "Date/Type/Date/DateTime" in Tangram::Type

       <b>Compound</b> <b>Structure</b> <b>types</b>
           "perl_dump":  see Tangram::Type::Dump::Perl.  A "perl_dump" structure may contain any structure which
           Data::Dumper can dump successfully.

           "storable": see Tangram::Type::Dump::Storable.  Very much like "perl_dump", but implemented  via  the
           `Storable' serialisation engine.

           "yaml":  see  Tangram::Type::Dump::YAML.   Very much like "perl_dump", but implemented via the `YAML'
           serialisation engine.  Doesn't  currently  work,  due  to  inadequacies  in  the  current  Perl  YAML
           implementation.

           <b>NEW</b> <b>in</b> <b>Tangram</b> <b>2.08</b>:

           "idbif":  see  Tangram::Type::Dump::Any.   Like the above, but can combine multiple object properties
           into a single database column.

       <b>`Flat'</b> <b>Array</b> <b>&amp;</b> <b>Hash</b> <b>types</b>
           Note: these are only actually required if you need to be able to query on  individual  fields  inside
           the array/hash - otherwise, the "perl_dump" or "idbif" mapping is a lot faster and more flexible.

           "flat_array": see "Array/Scalar" in Tangram::Type

           "flat_hash": see "Hash/Scalar" in Tangram::Type

       <b>References</b> <b>to</b> <b>other</b> <b>objects</b>
           "ref": see Tangram::Type::Ref::FromMany (implementing an <b>N</b> <b>to</b> <b>1</b> relationship, in which any object can
           be the referant)

       <b>Sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>objects</b>
           Set  relationships  are  closest  to  the  main  type of relationship used in an RDBMS.  Avid CompSci
           students will know that the relational database model is based heavily on `Set Theory',  which  is  a
           subset of a more general concept of `Categories' - generic couplings of a number of classes.

           In  Perl  space,  these  collections  are  represented via the Set::Object module.  Sets may not have
           duplicate elements, and cannot contain <u>undef</u> values.

           "set": see Tangram::Type::Set::FromMany (implementing an <u>unordered</u> <b>N</b>  <b>to</b>  <b>N</b>  relationship,  with  all
           objects sharing a common base class)

           "iset":  see  Tangram::Type::Set::FromOne  (implementing  an  <u>unordered</u> <b>1</b> <b>to</b> <b>N</b> relationship, with all
           objects sharing a common base class)

       <b>Arrays</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>objects</b>
           The addition to Sets, you can have `Arrays' of objects, represented  by  a  standard  Perl  array  in
           memory.   Arrays  may  contain  <u>undef</u>  values  (in  the middle of the list), and the "array" type may
           contain duplicates (ie, the same element present in separate places in the list).

           "array" : see Tangram::Type::Array::FromMany (implementing an <u>ordered</u> <b>N</b> <b>to</b> <b>N</b> relationship,  with  all
           objects sharing a common base class)

           "iarray":  see  Tangram::Type::Array::FromOne  (implementing an <u>ordered</u> <b>1</b> <b>to</b> <b>N</b> relationship, with all
           objects sharing a common base class)

       <b>Hashes</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>objects</b>
           Much like the Array types, the Hash types are indexed via a string value, and represented as  a  Perl
           hash  in memory.  These hashes may not contain <u>undef</u> values (those are dropped).  The "hash" type may
           contain duplicate elements.

           "hash" : see Tangram::Type::Hash::FromMany (implementing a  <u>keyed</u>  <b>N</b>  <b>to</b>  <b>N</b>  relationship,  with  all
           objects sharing a common base class)

           "ihash": see Tangram::Type::Hash::FromOne (implementing a <u>keyed</u> <b>1</b> <b>to</b> <b>N</b> relationship, with all objects
           sharing a common base class)
