       Type::Tiny::Manual::Policies - Type::Tiny policies

</pre><h4><b>MANUAL</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Type::Tiny</b> <b>Stability</b> <b>Policy</b>
       Type::Tiny 1.000000+ is considered stable. Any changes to the API that are big enough to <u>require</u> changes
       to the test suite will be preceded by a <u>six</u> <u>month</u> notice period, with the following exceptions:

       •   Any  changes which are necessary to maintain compatibility with new releases of Moose, Moo, and other
           software that Type::Tiny needs to integrate with.

       •   Changes to maintain compatibility with future versions of Perl itself.

       •   Where a change fixes a contradiction between the implementation and documentation of Type::Tiny.

       •   Where a feature is explicitly documented as being "experimental" or "unstable".

       •   Improvements to the text of error messages.

   <b>Experimental</b> <b>and</b> <b>Unstable</b> <b>Type::Tiny</b> <b>Features</b>
       The following list is currently non-exhaustive.

       •   The following type checks result may vary based on your version of Perl and whether Type::Tiny::XS is
           installed. Their outcome is currently considered undefined, and may change in future versions.

           •   Using <b>Object</b> and similar type checks on unblessed regular expression references, the  outcome  is
               undefined.

           •   On  all  current  versions  of  Perl,  false  ("!!0")  stringifies to the empty string (but using
               Devel::Peek you can tell the difference between this value and a normal empty string), so <b>Int</b> and
               subtypes of <b>Int</b> do not consider it to be an integer. If Perl's behaviour ever changes, you  might
               not  be  able  to  rely  on  this  outcome.  True ("!!1") stringifies as "1", so is considered an
               integer.

           •   A glob (not a globref but an actual glob) currently passes the <b>StringLike</b> type constraint but not
               the <b>Str</b> type constraint.

           •   The  <b>BoolLike</b> type is intended to extend <b>Bool</b> to cover overloaded boolean objects, but the  exact
               mechanism it uses may change.

       •   Type::Tiny's "my_methods" attribute and the functionality it provides is experimental.

       •   The parameterizable coercion API is subject to change.

       •   The  interaction  of deep coercions and mutable coercions currently results in ill-defined behaviour.
           This could change at any time.

       •   Type::Registry's ability to import MooseX::Types and MouseX::Types type libraries is experimental.

       •   These modules are considered part of Type::Tiny's internals, and not covered by the stability policy:
           Devel::TypeTiny::Perl58Compat,         Type::Coercion::FromMoose,         Type::Params::Alternatives,
           Type::Params::Parameter,   Type::Params::Signature,  Type::Tiny::_HalfOp,  Types::Standard::ArrayRef,
           Types::Standard::CycleTuple, Types::Standard::Dict,  Types::Standard::HashRef,  Types::Standard::Map,
           Types::Standard::ScalarRef,        Types::Standard::StrMatch,        Types::Standard::Tied,       and
           Types::Standard::Tuple.

       •   Reply::Plugin::TypeTiny is not covered by the stability policy.

   <b>Type::Tiny</b> <b>Versioning</b> <b>Policy</b>
       As of 1.000000, this distribution follows a versioning scheme similar to Moo, which is based on a  semver
       &lt;<a href="http://semver.org/">http://semver.org/</a>&gt;-like  three  component  version  number,  but  with  the  last  two  components each
       represented by three decimal digits in the fractional part  of  the  version  number.  That  is,  version
       1.003002 of the software represents "1.3.2".

       Additionally,  releases  where  the  second  component is an odd number will be considered unstable/trial
       releases. (These will also include an underscore in the version number as per the usual CPAN convention.)

   <b>Perl</b> <b>Version</b> <b>Support</b>
       Type::Tiny 0.000_01 to Type::Tiny 0.015_04 required Perl 5.8.1.

       Type::Tiny 0.015_05+ and Type::Tiny 1.000000+ requires Perl 5.6.1.

       Type::Tiny 2.000000+ will require Perl 5.8.1.
