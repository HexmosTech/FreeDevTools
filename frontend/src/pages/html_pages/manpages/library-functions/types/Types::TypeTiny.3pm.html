</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Types::TypeTiny - type constraints used internally by Type::Tiny

</pre><h4><b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       This module is covered by the Type-Tiny stability policy.

       The <b>BoolLike</b> type is currently unstable.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Dogfooding.

       This isn't a real Type::Library-based type library; that would involve too much circularity. But it
       exports some type constraints which, while designed for use within Type::Tiny, may be more generally
       useful.

   <b>Types</b>
       •   <b>StringLike</b>

           Accepts strings and objects overloading stringification.

       •   <b>BoolLike</b>

           Accepts  undef,  "",  0, 1; accepts any blessed object overloading "bool"; accepts any blessed object
           overloading "0+" to return 0 or 1. (Needs to actually call the overloaded operation to check that.)

           Warning: an object which overloads "0+" without also turning on overload fallbacks  may  actually  be
           useless  as  a  practical  boolean. But some common objects such as JSON::PP's booleans overload "0+"
           instead of overloading "bool" (thankfully with fallbacks enabled!) so we do need to support this.

           The intention of this type is to be a version of <b>Bool</b> which also accepts common boolean objects  such
           as  JSON::PP::Boolean.  It  is  currently unstable and the exact definition of the type may change to
           better implement that intended functionality.

       •   <b>HashLike[`a]</b>

           Accepts hashrefs and objects overloading hashification.

           Since Types::TypeTiny 1.012, may be parameterized with another type constraint like <b>HashLike[Int]</b>.

       •   <b>ArrayLike[`a]</b>

           Accepts arrayrefs and objects overloading arrayfication.

           Since Types::TypeTiny 1.012, may be parameterized with another type constraint like <b>ArrayLike[Int]</b>.

       •   <b>CodeLike</b>

           Accepts coderefs and objects overloading codification.

       •   <b>TypeTiny</b>

           Accepts blessed Type::Tiny objects.

       •   <b>_ForeignTypeConstraint</b>

           Any reference which to_TypeTiny recognizes as something that can be coerced to a Type::Tiny object.

           Yes, the underscore is included.

   <b>Coercion</b> <b>Functions</b>
       to_TypeTiny($constraint)
           Promotes (or "demotes" if you prefer) a "foreign" type constraint to a Type::Tiny object. Can handle:

           •   Moose  types  (including  Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint  objects  and  MooseX::Types::TypeDecorator
               objects).

           •   Mouse types (including Mouse::Meta::TypeConstraint objects).

           •   Validation::Class and Validation::Class::Simple objects.

           •   Types built using Type::Library::Compiler.

           •   Any  object  which  provides  "check"  and  "get_message"  methods.   (This  includes  Specio and
               Type::Nano types.) If the object provides "has_coercion" and coerce methods, these will  be  used
               to handle quoting. If the object provides "can_be_inlined" and "inline_check" methods, these will
               be  used  to  handling inlining.  If the object provides a "name" method, this will be assumed to
               return the type name.

           •   Coderefs (but not blessed coderefs or objects overloading "&amp;{}" unless they provide  the  methods
               described  above!) Coderefs are expected to return true iff $_ passes the constraint. If $_ fails
               the type constraint, they may either return false, or die with a helpful error message.

           •   Sub::Quote-enabled coderefs. These are handled the same way as above, but Type::Tiny will consult
               Sub::Quote to determine if they can be inlined.

   <b>Methods</b>
       These are implemented so that "Types::TypeTiny-&gt;meta-&gt;get_type($foo)" works, for rough compatibility with
       a real Type::Library type library.

       "meta"
       "type_names"
       get_type($name)
       has_type($name)
       "coercion_names"
       get_coercion($name)
       has_coercion($name)
