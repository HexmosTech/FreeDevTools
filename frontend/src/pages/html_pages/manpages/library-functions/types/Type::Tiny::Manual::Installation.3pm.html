       Type::Tiny::Manual::Installation - how to install Type::Tiny

</pre><h4><b>MANUAL</b></h4><pre>
       Installing Type-Tiny should be straightforward.

   <b>Installation</b> <b>with</b> <b>cpanminus</b>
       If you have cpanm, you only need one line:

         % cpanm Type::Tiny

       If you are installing into a system-wide directory, you may need to pass the "-S" flag to cpanm, which
       uses sudo to install the module:

         % cpanm -S Type::Tiny

   <b>Installation</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>CPAN</b> <b>Shell</b>
       Alternatively, if your CPAN shell is set up, you should just be able to do:

         % cpan Type::Tiny

   <b>Manual</b> <b>Installation</b>
       As a last resort, you can manually install it. Download the tarball and unpack it.

       Consult the file META.json for a list of pre-requisites. Install these first.

       To build Type-Tiny:

         % perl Makefile.PL
         % make &amp;&amp; make test

       Then install it:

         % make install

       If you are installing into a system-wide directory, you may need to run:

         % sudo make install

   <b>Dependencies</b>
       Type::Tiny requires at least Perl 5.8.1, though certain Unicode-related features (e.g. non-ASCII type
       constraint names) may work better in newer versions of Perl.

       Type::Tiny requires Exporter::Tiny, a module that was previously bundled in this distribution, but has
       since been spun off as a separate distribution. Don't worry - it's quick and easy to install.

       At run-time, Type::Tiny also requires the following Perl modules: B, B::Deparse, Carp, Data::Dumper,
       Scalar::Util, Text::Balanced, overload, strict, and warnings.  All of these come bundled with Perl
       itself.

       Certain features require additional modules. Stack traces on exceptions require Devel::StackTrace. The
       Reply::Plugin::TypeTiny plugin for Reply requires Reply (obviously).

       Type::Tiny::XS is not required, but if available provides a speed boost for some type checks. (Setting
       the environment variable "PERL_TYPE_TINY_XS" to false, or setting "PERL_ONLY" to true will suppress the
       use of Type::Tiny::XS, even if it is available.)

       The test suite additionally requires Test::More, Test::Fatal and Test::Requires. Test::More comes bundled
       with Perl, but if you are using a version of Perl older than 5.14, you will need to upgrade to at least
       Test::More version 0.96. Test::Requires and Test::Fatal (plus Try::Tiny which Test::Fatal depends on) are
       bundled with Type::Tiny in the "inc" directory, so you do not need to install them separately.

       If using Type::Tiny in conjunction with Moo, then at least Moo 1.006000 is recommended. If using
       Type::Tiny with Moose, then at least Moose 2.0000 is recommended. If using Type::Tiny with Mouse, then at
       least Mouse 1.00 is recommended. Type::Tiny is mostly untested against older versions of these packages.

       <u>Type::Tiny</u> <u>and</u> <u>cperl</u>

       cperl &lt;<a href="http://perl11.org/cperl/">http://perl11.org/cperl/</a>&gt; is an extended version of Perl with various incompatible changes from
       the official Perl 5 releases.

       As of Type::Tiny 1.010001, cperl is a supported platform for Type::Tiny with some caveats. At the time of
       writing, Moose will not install on the latest cperl releases, so using Type::Tiny with Moose on cperl is
       untested. Moo can be forced to install, and Type::Tiny is verified to work with Moo on cperl.  cperl not
       only enables a new warnings category called "shadow" (which is good; they're potentially useful) but
       switches on shadow warnings by default (which is annoying). Type::Tiny does not (and likely will never)
       attempt to work around these warnings. If the warnings bother you, you should be able to catch them using
       $SIG{__WARN__}. Certain features of Eval::TypeTiny are broken under cperl, but they're not thought to
       have any practical effect on Type::Tiny or its other bundled modules.

</pre><h4><b>NEXT</b> <b>STEPS</b></h4><pre>
       Here's your next step:

       â€¢   Type::Tiny::Manual::UsingWithMoo

           Basic  use  of  Type::Tiny  with  Moo,  including  attribute  type  constraints,  parameterized  type
           constraints, coercions, and method parameter checking.
