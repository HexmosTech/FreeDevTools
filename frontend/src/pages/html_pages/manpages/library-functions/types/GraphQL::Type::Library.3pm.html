</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       GraphQL::Type::Library - GraphQL type library

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use GraphQL::Type::Library -all;
           has name =&gt; (is =&gt; 'ro', isa =&gt; StrNameValid, required =&gt; 1);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Provides Type::Tiny types.

</pre><h4><b>TYPES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>StrNameValid</b>
       If called with a string that is not a valid GraphQL name, will throw an exception. Suitable for passing
       to an "isa" constraint in Moo.

   <b>ValuesMatchTypes</b>
       Subtype of "HashRef" in Types::Standard, whose values are hash-refs. Takes two parameters:

       value keyname
           Optional within the second-level hashes.

       type keyname
           Values will be a GraphQL::Type. Mandatory within the second-level hashes.

       In the second-level hashes, the values (if given) must pass the GraphQL type constraint.

   <b>FieldsGot</b>
       Data item describing the fields found in a particular object in a query.  Preserves their order.

   <b>FieldMapInput</b>
       Hash-ref mapping field names to a hash-ref description. Description keys, all optional except "type":

       type
           GraphQL input type for the field.

       default_value
           Default  value  for this argument if none supplied. Must be same type as the "type" (implemented with
           type "ValuesMatchTypes".  <b>NB</b> this is a Perl value, not a JSON/GraphQL value.

       description
           Description.

   <b>FieldMapOutput</b>
       Hash-ref mapping field names to a hash-ref description. Description keys, all optional except "type":

       <u>type</u>

       GraphQL output type for the field.

       <u>args</u>

       A "FieldMapInput".

       <u>subscribe</u>

       Code-ref to return  a  subscription  to  the  field  from  a  given  source-object.  See  "subscribe"  in
       GraphQL::Subscription.

       <u>deprecation_reason</u>

       Reason if deprecated. If given, also sets a boolean key of "is_deprecated" to true.

       <u>description</u>

       Description.

       <u>resolve</u>

       Code-ref  to  return  a given property from a given source-object.  A key concept is to remember that the
       "object" on which these fields exist, were themselves returned by other fields.

       There are no restrictions on what you can return, so long as it is a scalar, and if your return type is a
       list, that scalar is an array-ref.

       Emphasis has been put on there being Perl values here. Conversion between  Perl  and  GraphQL  values  is
       taken  care  of  by  scalar types, and it is only scalar information that will be returned to the client,
       albeit in the shape dictated by the object types.

       An example function that takes a name and GraphQL type, and returns a field definition, with  a  resolver
       that  calls  read-only  Moo  accessors,  suitable for placing (several of) inside the hash-ref defining a
       type's fields:

         sub _make_moo_field {
           my ($field_name, $type) = @_;
           ($field_name =&gt; { resolve =&gt; sub {
             my ($root_value, $args, $context, $info) = @_;
             my @passon = %$args ? ($args) : ();
             return undef unless $root_value-&gt;can($field_name);
             $root_value-&gt;$field_name(@passon);
           }, type =&gt; $type });
         }
         # ...
           fields =&gt; {
             _make_moo_field(name =&gt; $String),
             _make_moo_field(description =&gt; $String),
           },
         # ...

       The code-ref will be called with these parameters:

       $source

       The Perl entity (possibly a blessed object) returned by  the  resolver  that  conjured  up  this  GraphQL
       object.

       $args

       Hash-ref of the arguments passed to the field. The values will be Perl values.

       $context

       The  "context"  value  supplied  to  the  call  to  "execute"  in  GraphQL::Execution.  Can  be  used for
       authenticated user information, or a per-request cache.

       $info

       A hash-ref describing this node of the request; see "info hash" below.

       <u>info</u> <u>hash</u>

       field_name

       The real name of this field.

       field_nodes

       The array of Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) nodes that refer to this field in this "selection  set"  (set  of
       fields)  on  this  object. There may be more than one such set for a given field, if it is requested more
       than once with a given name (not with an alias) - the results will be combined into one reply.

       return_type

       The return type.

       parent_type

       The type of which this field is part.

       path

       The hierarchy of fields from the query root to this field-resolution.

       schema

       GraphQL::Schema object.

       fragments

       Any fragments applying to this request.

       root_value

       The "root value" given to "execute".

       operation

       A hash-ref describing the operation ("query", etc) being executed.

       variable_values

       the operation's arguments, filled out with the variables hash supplied to the request.

       promise_code

       A hash-ref. The relevant value supplied to the "execute" function.

   <b>Int32Signed</b>
       32-bit signed integer.

   <b>ArrayRefNonEmpty</b>
       Like "ArrayRef" in Types::Standard but requires at least one entry.

   <b>UniqueByProperty</b>
       An ArrayRef, its members' property (the one in the parameter) can occur only once.

         use Moo;
         use GraphQL::Type::Library -all;
         has types =&gt; (
           is =&gt; 'ro',
           isa =&gt; UniqueByProperty['name'] &amp; ArrayRef[InstanceOf['GraphQL::Type::Object']],
           required =&gt; 1,
         );

   <b>ExpectObject</b>
       A "Maybe[HashRef]" that produces a GraphQL-like message if it fails, saying "found not an object".

   <b>DocumentLocation</b>
       Hash-ref that has keys "line" and "column" which are "Int".

   <b>JSONable</b>
       A value that will be JSON-able.

   <b>ErrorResult</b>
       Hash-ref that has keys "message", "location", "path", "extensions".

   <b>ExecutionResult</b>
       Hash-ref that has keys "data" and/or "errors".

       The "errors", if present, will be an array-ref of "ErrorResult".

       The "data" if present will be the return data, being a hash-ref whose values are either  further  hashes,
       array-refs, or scalars. It will be JSON-able.

   <b>ExecutionPartialResult</b>
       Hash-ref  that  has  keys  "data"  and/or  "errors".  Like  "ExecutionResult" above, but the "errors", if
       present, will be an array-ref of GraphQL::Error objects.

   <b>Promise</b>
       An object that has a "then" method.

   <b>PromiseCode</b>
       A hash-ref with three keys: "resolve", "all", "reject". The values are all code-refs that take one  value
       (for "all", an array-ref), and create the given kind of Promise.

       An example, enabling interoperation with Promises:

         use Promises qw(collect resolved rejected);
         {
           all     =&gt; \&amp;collect,
           resolve =&gt; \&amp;resolved,
           reject  =&gt; \&amp;rejected,
         },

       Must  also  have  a  "new" key for use with GraphQL::Subscription, with code returning a promise that can
       then have "resolve" or "reject" called on it.

   <b>AsyncIterator</b>
       An instance of GraphQL::AsyncIterator.
