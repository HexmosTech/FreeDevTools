</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       GIS::Distance - Calculate geographic distances.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use GIS::Distance;

           # Use the GIS::Distance::Haversine formula by default.
           my $gis = GIS::Distance-&gt;new();

           # Or choose a different formula.
           my $gis = GIS::Distance-&gt;new( 'Polar' );

           # Returns a Class::Measure object.
           my $distance = $gis-&gt;distance( $lat1, $lon1, $lat2, $lon2 );

           print $distance-&gt;meters();

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module calculates distances between geographic points on, at the moment, planet Earth.  Various
       "FORMULAS" are available that provide different levels of accuracy versus speed.

       GIS::Distance::Fast, a separate distribution, ships with C implementations of some of the formulas
       shipped with GIS::Distance.  If you're looking for speed then install it and the ::Fast formulas will be
       automatically used by this module.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>distance</b>
           my $distance = $gis-&gt;distance( $lat1, $lon1, $lat2, $lon2 );

           my $point1 = Geo::Point-&gt;latlong( $lat1, $lon1 );
           my $point2 = Geo::Point-&gt;latlong( $lat2, $lon2 );
           my $distance = $gis-&gt;distance( $point1, $point2 );

       Takes either two decimal latitude and longitude pairs, or two Geo::Point objects.

       Returns a Class::Measure::Length object for the distance between the two degree lats/lons.

       See "distance_metal" for a faster, but less feature rich, method.

   <b>distance_metal</b>
       This works just like "distance" except for:

       •   Does not accept Geo::Point objects.  Only decimal latitude and longitude pairs.

       •   Does not return a Class::Measure object.  Instead kilometers are always returned.

       •   Does no argument checking.

       •   Does  not  support  formula arguments which are supported by at least the GIS::Distance::GeoEllipsoid
           formula.

       Calling this gets you pretty close to the fastest bare metal speed you can get.  The  speed  improvements
       of  calling  this is noticeable over hundreds of thousands of iterations only and you've got to decide if
       its worth the safety and features you are dropping.  Read more in the "SPEED" section.

</pre><h4><b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
           my $gis = GIS::Distance-&gt;new( $formula );

       When you call "new()" you may pass a partial or full formula class  name  as  the  first  argument.   The
       default is "Haversive".

       If you pass a partial name, as in:

           my $gis = GIS::Distance-&gt;new( 'Haversine' );

       Then the following modules will be looked for in order:

           GIS::Distance::Fast::Haversine
           GIS::Distance::Haversine
           Haversine

       Install GIS::Distance::Fast to get access to the "Fast::" (XS) implementations of the formula classes.

       You  may  globally  disable  the  automatic use of the "Fast::" formulas by setting the "GIS_DISTANCE_PP"
       environment variable.  Although, its likely simpler to just provide a full class name  to  get  the  same
       effect:

           my $gis = GIS::Distance-&gt;new( 'GIS::Distance::Haversine' );

</pre><h4><b>SPEED</b></h4><pre>
       Not that this module is slow, but if you're doing millions of distance calculations a second you may find
       that adjusting your code a bit may make it faster.  Here are some options.

       Install GIS::Distance::Fast to get the XS variants for most of the PP formulas.

       Use "distance_metal" instead of "distance".

       Call  the  undocumented "_distance()" function that each formula class has.  For example you could bypass
       this module entirely and just do:

           use GIS::Distance::Fast::Haversine;
           my $km = GIS::Distance::Fast::Haversine::_distance( @coords );

       The above would be the ultimate speed demon (as shown in benchmarking) but throws away  some  flexibility
       and adds some foot-gun support.

       Here's a benchmarks for these options:

           2019-03-13T09:34:00Z
           GIS::Distance 0.15
           GIS::Distance::Fast 0.12
           GIS::Distance::Fast::Haversine 0.12
           GIS::Distance::Haversine 0.15
                                                                        Rate
           PP Haversine - GIS::Distance-&gt;distance                   123213/s
           XS Haversine - GIS::Distance-&gt;distance                   196232/s
           PP Haversine - GIS::Distance-&gt;distance_metal             356379/s
           PP Haversine - GIS::Distance::Haversine::_distance       385208/s
           XS Haversine - GIS::Distance-&gt;distance_metal             3205128/s
           XS Haversine - GIS::Distance::Fast::Haversine::_distance 8620690/s

       You  can  run  your  own  benchmarks  using  the  included "author/bench" script.  The above results were
       produced with:

           author/bench -f Haversine

       The slowest result was about "125000/s", or about "8ms" each call.  This could be a substantial burden in
       some contexts, such as live HTTP responses to human users and running large batch jobs, to name just two.

       In conclusion, if  you  can  justify  the  speed  gain,  switching  to  "distance_metal"  and  installing
       GIS::Distance::Fast looks to be an ideal setup.

       As always with performance and benchmarking, YMMV.

</pre><h4><b>COORDINATES</b></h4><pre>
       When passing latitudinal and longitudinal coordinates to "distance" they must always be in decimal degree
       format.  Here is some sample code for converting from other formats to decimal:

           # DMS to Decimal
           my $decimal = $degrees + ($minutes/60) + ($seconds/3600);

           # Precision Six Integer to Decimal
           my $decimal = $integer * .000001;

       If you want to convert from decimal radians to degrees you can use Math::Trig's rad2deg function.

</pre><h4><b>FORMULAS</b></h4><pre>
       These formulas come bundled with this distribution:

       •   GIS::Distance::ALT

       •   GIS::Distance::Cosine

       •   GIS::Distance::GreatCircle

       •   GIS::Distance::Haversine

       •   GIS::Distance::MathTrig

       •   GIS::Distance::Null

       •   GIS::Distance::Polar

       •   GIS::Distance::Vincenty

       These formulas are available on CPAN:

       •   "FORMULAS" in GIS::Distance::Fast

       •   GIS::Distance::GeoEllipsoid

</pre><h4><b>AUTHORING</b></h4><pre>
       Take a look at GIS::Distance::Formula for instructions on authoring new formula classes.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       •   Geo::Distance - Is deprecated in favor of using this module.

       •   Geo::Distance::Google  -  While  in  the  Geo::Distance  namespace,  this  isn't  actually related to
           Geo::Distance at all.  Might be useful though.

       •   GIS::Distance::Lite - An old fork of this module, not recommended.

       •   Geo::Distance::XS - Used to be used by Geo::Distance but no longer is.

       •   Geo::Ellipsoid - Or use GIS::Distance::GeoEllipsoid for a uniform interface.

       •   Geo::Inverse - Does some distance calculations, but seems less than useful as all the code  looks  to
           be taken from Geo::Ellipsoid.
