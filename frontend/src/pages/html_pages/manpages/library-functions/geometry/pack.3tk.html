</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       pack - Geometry manager that packs around edges of cavity

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pack</b> <u>option</u> <u>arg</u> ?<u>arg</u> <u>...</u>?
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>pack</b> command is used to communicate with the packer, a geometry manager that arranges the children of
       a  parent  by  packing  them  in  order around the edges of the parent.  The <b>pack</b> command can have any of
       several forms, depending on the <u>option</u> argument:

       <b>pack</b> <u>window</u> ?<u>window</u> <u>...</u>? ?<u>options</u>?
              If the first argument to <b>pack</b> is a window name (any value starting with “.”), then the command  is
              processed in the same way as <b>pack</b> <b>configure</b>.

       <b>pack</b> <b>configure</b> <u>window</u> ?<u>window</u> <u>...</u>? ?<u>options</u>?
              The  arguments  consist of the names of one or more content windows followed by pairs of arguments
              that specify how to manage the content.  See <b>THE</b> <b>PACKER</b> <b>ALGORITHM</b> below for  details  on  how  the
              options are used by the packer.  The following options are supported:

              <b>-after</b> <u>other</u>
                     <u>Other</u> must the name of another window.  Use its container as the container for the content,
                     and insert the content just after <u>other</u> in the packing order.

              <b>-anchor</b> <u>anchor</u>
                     <u>Anchor</u> must be a valid anchor position such as <b>n</b> or <b>sw</b>; it specifies where to position each
                     content in its parcel.  Defaults to <b>center</b>.

              <b>-before</b> <u>other</u>
                     <u>Other</u> must the name of another window.  Use its container as the container for the content,
                     and insert the content just before <u>other</u> in the packing order.

              <b>-expand</b> <u>boolean</u>
                     Specifies whether the content should be expanded to consume extra space in their container.
                     <u>Boolean</u> may have any proper boolean value, such as <b>1</b> or <b>no</b>.  Defaults to 0.

              <b>-fill</b> <u>style</u>
                     If  a  content's parcel is larger than its requested dimensions, this option may be used to
                     stretch the content.  <u>Style</u> must have one of the following values:

                     <b>none</b>   Give the content its requested dimensions plus any internal padding  requested  with
                            <b>-ipadx</b> or <b>-ipady</b>.  This is the default.

                     <b>x</b>      Stretch  the  content  horizontally  to  fill the entire width of its parcel (except
                            leave external padding as specified by <b>-padx</b>).

                     <b>y</b>      Stretch the content vertically to fill the entire height of its parcel (except leave
                            external padding as specified by <b>-pady</b>).

                     <b>both</b>   Stretch the content both horizontally and vertically.

              <b>-in</b> <u>container</u>
                     Insert the window at the end of the  packing  order  for  the  container  window  given  by
                     <u>container</u>.

              <b>-ipadx</b> <u>amount</u>
                     <u>Amount</u> specifies how much horizontal internal padding to leave on each side of the content.
                     <u>Amount</u> must be a valid screen distance, such as <b>2</b> or <b>.5c</b>.  It defaults to 0.

              <b>-ipady</b> <u>amount</u>
                     <u>Amount</u>  specifies  how much vertical internal padding to leave on each side of the content.
                     <u>Amount</u>  defaults to 0.

              <b>-padx</b> <u>amount</u>
                     <u>Amount</u> specifies how much horizontal external padding to leave on each side of the content.
                     <u>Amount</u> may be a list of two values to  specify  padding  for  left  and  right  separately.
                     <u>Amount</u> defaults to 0.

              <b>-pady</b> <u>amount</u>
                     <u>Amount</u>  specifies  how much vertical external padding to leave on each side of the content.
                     <u>Amount</u> may be a list of two values to  specify  padding  for  top  and  bottom  separately.
                     <u>Amount</u> defaults to 0.

              <b>-side</b> <u>side</u>
                     Specifies  which  side  of the container the content will be packed against.  Must be <b>left</b>,
                     <b>right</b>, <b>top</b>, or <b>bottom</b>.  Defaults to <b>top</b>.

              If no <b>-in</b>, <b>-after</b> or <b>-before</b> option is specified then each of the content will be inserted at  the
              end  of  the packing list for its parent unless it is already managed by the packer (in which case
              it will be left where it is).  If one of these options is specified then all the content  will  be
              inserted  at  the  specified  point.   If  any  of the content are already managed by the geometry
              manager then any unspecified options for them retain their previous values rather  than  receiving
              default values.

       <b>pack</b> <b>content</b> <u>window</u>
              Returns  a  list  of  all of the content windows in the packing order for <u>window</u>. The order of the
              content windows in the list is the same as their order in the packing order.   If  <u>window</u>  has  no
              content then an empty string is returned.

       <b>pack</b> <b>forget</b> <u>window</u> ?<u>window</u> <u>...</u>?
              Removes  each  of  the  <u>window</u>s from the packing order for its container and unmaps their windows.
              The content will no longer be managed by the packer.

              If the last content window of the container becomes unmanaged, this will  also  send  the  virtual 2
              event <b>&lt;&lt;NoManagedChild&gt;&gt;</b> to the container; the container may choose to resize itself (or otherwise 2
              respond) to such a change.

       <b>pack</b> <b>info</b> <u>window</u>
              Returns a list whose elements are the current configuration state of the window given by <u>window</u> in
              the  same  option-value form that might be specified to <b>pack</b> <b>configure</b>.  The first two elements of
              the list are “<b>-in</b> <u>container</u>” where <u>container</u> is the window's container.

       <b>pack</b> <b>propagate</b> <u>container</u> ?<u>boolean</u>?
              If <u>boolean</u> has a true boolean value such as <b>1</b> or <b>on</b> then propagation  is  enabled  for  <u>container</u>,
              which  must  be  a  window  name (see <b>GEOMETRY</b> <b>PROPAGATION</b> below).  If <u>boolean</u> has a false boolean
              value then propagation is disabled for <u>container</u>.  In either of these cases  an  empty  string  is
              returned.   If  <u>boolean</u> is omitted then the command returns <b>0</b> or <b>1</b> to indicate whether propagation
              is currently enabled for <u>container</u>.  Propagation is enabled by default.

       <b>pack</b> <b>slaves</b> <u>window</u>
              Synonym for <b>pack</b> <b>content</b> <u>window</u>.

</pre><h4><b>THE</b> <b>PACKER</b> <b>ALGORITHM</b></h4><pre>
       For each container the packer maintains an ordered list of content windows called the <u>packing</u> <u>list</u>.   The
       <b>-in</b>, <b>-after</b>, and <b>-before</b> configuration options are used to specify the container for each content and the
       content's position in the packing list.  If none of these options is given for a content then the content
       is added to the end of the packing list for its parent.

       The  packer  arranges  the content windows for a container by scanning the packing list in order.  At the
       time it processes each content, a rectangular area within the container is still unallocated.  This  area
       is called the <u>cavity</u>;  for the first content it is the entire area of the container.

       For each content the packer carries out the following steps:

       [1]    The  packer  allocates  a rectangular <u>parcel</u> for the content along the side of the cavity given by
              the content's <b>-side</b> option.  If the side is top or bottom then the width  of  the  parcel  is  the
              width  of  the  cavity  and  its height is the requested height of the content plus the <b>-ipady</b> and
              <b>-pady</b> options.  For the left or right side the height of the parcel is the height  of  the  cavity
              and the width is the requested width of the content plus the <b>-ipadx</b> and <b>-padx</b> options.  The parcel
              may be enlarged further because of the <b>-expand</b> option (see <b>EXPANSION</b> below)

       [2]    The  packer  chooses  the  dimensions  of  the  content.  The width will normally be the content's
              requested width plus twice its <b>-ipadx</b> option  and  the  height  will  normally  be  the  content's
              requested height plus twice its <b>-ipady</b> option.  However, if the <b>-fill</b> option is <b>x</b> or <b>both</b> then the
              width  of  the  content is expanded to fill the width of the parcel, minus twice the <b>-padx</b> option.
              If the <b>-fill</b> option is <b>y</b> or <b>both</b> then the height of the content is expanded to fill the  width  of
              the parcel, minus twice the <b>-pady</b> option.

       [3]    The  packer positions the content over its parcel.  If the content is smaller than the parcel then
              the <b>-anchor</b> option determines where in the parcel the content will be placed.  If <b>-padx</b>  or  <b>-pady</b>
              is non-zero, then the given amount of external padding will always be left between the content and
              the edges of the parcel.

       Once  a  given  content  has been packed, the area of its parcel is subtracted from the cavity, leaving a
       smaller rectangular cavity for the next content.  If a content does not use all of its parcel, the unused
       space in the parcel will not be used by subsequent content.  If the cavity should  become  too  small  to
       meet  the needs of a content then the content will be given whatever space is left in the cavity.  If the
       cavity shrinks to zero size, then all remaining content on the packing list will  be  unmapped  from  the
       screen until the container window becomes large enough to hold them again.

   <b>EXPANSION</b>
       If  a container window is so large that there will be extra space left over after all of its content have
       been packed, then the extra space is distributed uniformly among all of the content for which the <b>-expand</b>
       option is set.  Extra horizontal space is distributed among the expandable content whose <b>-side</b> is <b>left</b> or
       <b>right</b>, and extra vertical space is distributed among the expandable content whose <b>-side</b> is <b>top</b> or <b>bottom</b>.

   <b>GEOMETRY</b> <b>PROPAGATION</b>
       The packer normally computes how large a container must be to just exactly meet the needs of its content,
       and it sets the requested width and height of the container to these dimensions.   This  causes  geometry
       information  to propagate up through a window hierarchy to a top-level window so that the entire sub-tree
       sizes itself to fit the needs of the leaf windows.  However, the <b>pack</b> <b>propagate</b> command may  be  used  to
       turn off propagation for one or more containers.  If propagation is disabled then the packer will not set
       the  requested  width  and  height  of  the  packer.   This may be useful if, for example, you wish for a
       container window to have a fixed size that you specify.

</pre><h4><b>RESTRICTIONS</b> <b>ON</b> <b>CONTAINER</b> <b>WINDOWS</b></h4><pre>
       The container for each content must either be the content's parent (the default) or a descendant  of  the
       content's  parent.   This  restriction  is necessary to guarantee that the content can be placed over any
       part of its container that is visible without danger of the content being clipped by its parent.

</pre><h4><b>PACKING</b> <b>ORDER</b></h4><pre>
       If the container for a content is not its parent then you must make sure that the content  is  higher  in
       the  stacking  order  than  the  container.  Otherwise the container will obscure the content and it will
       appear as if the content has not been packed correctly.  The easiest way to  make  sure  the  content  is
       higher than the container is to create the container window first:  the most recently created window will
       be  highest  in  the stacking order.  Or, you can use the <b>raise</b> and <b>lower</b> commands to change the stacking
       order of either the container or the content.
