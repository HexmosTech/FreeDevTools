       OSSL_CALLBACK, OSSL_PASSPHRASE_CALLBACK - OpenSSL Core type to define callbacks

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        #include &lt;openssl/core.h&gt;
        typedef int (OSSL_CALLBACK)(const OSSL_PARAM params[], void *arg);
        typedef int (OSSL_PASSPHRASE_CALLBACK)(char *pass, size_t pass_size,
                                               size_t *pass_len,
                                               const OSSL_PARAM params[],
                                               void *arg);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       For certain events or activities, provider functionality may need help from the application or the
       calling OpenSSL libraries themselves.  For example, user input or direct (possibly optional) user output
       could be implemented this way.

       Callback functions themselves are always provided by or through the calling OpenSSL libraries, along with
       a generic pointer to data <u>arg</u>.  As far as the function receiving the pointer to the function pointer and
       <u>arg</u> is concerned, the data that <u>arg</u> points at is opaque, and the pointer should simply be passed back to
       the callback function when it's called.

       <b>OSSL_CALLBACK</b>
           This  is a generic callback function.  When calling this callback function, the caller is expected to
           build an <b><a href="../man3/OSSL_PARAM.3.html">OSSL_PARAM</a></b>(3) array of data it wants or is expected to pass back, and pass that  as  <u>params</u>,
           as well as the opaque data pointer it received, as <u>arg</u>.

       <b>OSSL_PASSPHRASE_CALLBACK</b>
           This is a specialised callback function, used specifically to prompt the user for a passphrase.  When
           calling  this  callback  function, a buffer to store the pass phrase needs to be given with <u>pass</u>, and
           its size with <u>pass_size</u>.  The length of the prompted pass phrase will be given back in <u>*pass_len</u>.

           Additional parameters can be passed with the <b><a href="../man3/OSSL_PARAM.3.html">OSSL_PARAM</a></b>(3) array <u>params</u>,
