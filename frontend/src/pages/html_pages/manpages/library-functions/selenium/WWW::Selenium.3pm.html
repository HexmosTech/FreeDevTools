</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Selenium Remote Control (SRC) is a test tool that allows you to write automated web application UI tests
       in any programming language against any HTTP website using any mainstream JavaScript-enabled browser.
       SRC provides a Selenium Server, which can automatically start/stop/control any supported browser. It
       works by using Selenium Core, a pure-HTML+JS library that performs automated tasks in JavaScript; the
       Selenium Server communicates directly with the browser using AJAX (XmlHttpRequest).

       &lt;<a href="http://www.openqa.org/selenium-rc/">http://www.openqa.org/selenium-rc/</a>&gt;

       This module sends commands directly to the Server using simple HTTP GET/POST requests.  Using this module
       together with the Selenium Server, you can automatically control any supported browser.

       To use this module, you need to have already downloaded and started the Selenium Server.  (The Selenium
       Server is a Java application.)

   <b>Element</b> <b>Locators</b>
       Element Locators tell Selenium which HTML element a command refers to.The format of a locator is:

       <u>locatorType</u><b>=</b><u>argument</u>

       We support the following strategies for locating elements:

       •   <b>identifier</b>=<u>id</u>:  Select  the element with the specified @id attribute. If no match isfound, select the
           first element whose @name attribute is <u>id</u>.(This is normally the default; see below.)

       •   <b>id</b>=<u>id</u>:Select the element with the specified @id attribute.

       •   <b>name</b>=<u>name</u>:Select the first element with the specified @name attribute.

           •   username

           •   name=username

           The name may optionally be followed by one or  more  <u>element-filters</u>,  separated  from  the  name  by
           whitespace.  If the <u>filterType</u> is not specified, <b>value</b> is assumed.

           •   name=flavour value=chocolate

       •   <b>dom</b>=<u>javascriptExpression</u>:  Find  an  element  by evaluating the specified string.  This allows you to
           traverse the HTML Document ObjectModel using JavaScript.  Note that you must not return  a  value  in
           this string; simply make it the last expression in the block.

           •   dom=document.forms['myForm'].myDropdown

           •   dom=document.images[56]

           •   dom=function <b>foo()</b> { return document.links[1]; }; <b>foo()</b>;

       •   <b>xpath</b>=<u>xpathExpression</u>: Locate an element using an XPath expression.

           •   xpath=//img[@alt='The image alt text']

           •   xpath=//table[@id='table1']//tr[4]/td[2]

           •   xpath=//a[contains(@href,'#id1')]

           •   xpath=//a[contains(@href,'#id1')]/@class

           •   xpath=(//table[@class='stylee'])//th[<b>text()</b>='theHeaderText']/../td

           •   xpath=//input[@name='name2' and @value='yes']

           •   xpath=//*[<b>text()</b>="right"]

       •   <b>link</b>=<u>textPattern</u>:Select the link (anchor) element which contains text matching thespecified <u>pattern</u>.

           •   link=The link text

       •   <b>css</b>=<u>cssSelectorSyntax</u>:Select    the    element    using    css    selectors.    Please    refer    to
           <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/selector.html">http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/selector.html</a>                     (CSS2                     selectors),
           <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/CR-css3-selectors-20011113/">http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/CR-css3-selectors-20011113/</a>  (CSS3 selectors) for more information. You can
           also check the TestCssLocators test in the selenium test suite for an  example  of  usage,  which  is
           included in the downloaded selenium core package.

           •   css=a[href="#id3"]

           •   css=span#firstChild + span

           Currently  the  css  selector  locator supports all css1, css2 and css3 selectors except namespace in
           css3,   some   pseudo   classes(:nth-of-type,   :nth-last-of-type,   :first-of-type,   :last-of-type,
           :only-of-type,  :visited,  :hover, :active, :focus, :indeterminate) and pseudo elements(::first-line,
           ::first-letter, ::selection, ::before, ::after).

       •   <b>ui</b>=<u>uiSpecifierString</u>:Locate an element by resolving the UI specifier string to another  locator,  and
           evaluating                            it.                           See                           the
           <a href="http://svn.openqa.org/fisheye/browse/~raw">http://svn.openqa.org/fisheye/browse/~raw</a>,r=trunk/selenium/trunk/src/main/resources/core/scripts/ui-doc.html
           (Selenium UI-Element Reference) for more details.

           •   ui=<b>loginPages::loginButton()</b>

           •   ui=settingsPages::toggle(label=Hide Email)

           •   ui=forumPages::postBody(index=2)//a[2]

       Without an explicit locator prefix, Selenium uses the following defaultstrategies:

       •   <b>dom</b>, for locators starting with "document."

       •   <b>xpath</b>, for locators starting with "//"

       •   <b>identifier</b>, otherwise

   <b>Element</b> <b>Filters</b>
       Element filters can be used with a locator to refine a list of candidate elements.   They  are  currently
       used only in the 'name' element-locator.

       Filters look much like locators, ie.

       <u>filterType</u><b>=</b><u>argument</u>

       Supported element-filters are:

       <b>value=</b><u>valuePattern</u>
           Matches  elements  based  on  their  values.   This  is  particularly  useful  for refining a list of
           similarly-named toggle-buttons.

       <b>index=</b><u>index</u>
           Selects a single element based on its position in the list (offset from zero).

   <b>String-match</b> <b>Patterns</b>
       Various Pattern syntaxes are available for matching string values:

       •   <b>glob:</b><u>pattern</u>:Match a string against a "glob" (aka "wildmat") pattern.  "Glob"  is  akind  of  limited
           regular-expression syntax typically used in command-lineshells. In a glob pattern, "*" represents any
           sequence  of  characters,  and  "?"represents  any  single character. Glob patterns match against the
           entirestring.

       •   <b>regexp:</b><u>regexp</u>:Match a string  using  a  regular-expression.  The  full  power  of  JavaScriptregular-
           expressions is available.

       •   <b>regexpi:</b><u>regexpi</u>:Match a string using a case-insensitive regular-expression.

       •   <b>exact:</b><u>string</u>:Match a string exactly, verbatim, without any of that fancy wildcardstuff.

       If no pattern prefix is specified, Selenium assumes that it's a "glob"pattern.

       For  commands  that  return  multiple  values (such as verifySelectOptions),the string being matched is a
       comma-separated list  of  the  return  values,where  both  commas  and  backslashes  in  the  values  are
       backslash-escaped.When  providing  a  pattern,  the  optional matching syntax (i.e. glob,regexp, etc.) is
       specified once, as usual, at the beginning of thepattern.

   <b>METHODS</b>
       The following methods are available:

       $sel = WWW::Selenium-&gt;new( %args )
           Constructs a new "WWW::Selenium" object, specifying a Selenium Server host/port, a command to  launch
           the browser, and a starting URL for the browser.

           Options:

           •   "host"

               host is the host name on which the Selenium Server resides.

           •   "port"

               port is the port on which the Selenium Server is listening.

           •   "browser_url"

               browser_url  is  the starting URL including just a domain name.  We'll start the browser pointing
               at the Selenium resources on this URL, e.g. "<a href="http://www.google.com">http://www.google.com</a>" would  send  the  browser  to
               "<a href="http://www.google.com/selenium-server/SeleneseRunner.html">http://www.google.com/selenium-server/SeleneseRunner.html</a>"

           •   "browser" or "browser_start_command"

               This  is  the  command  string  used  to  launch  the  browser,  e.g.  "*firefox", "*iexplore" or
               "/usr/bin/firefox"

               This option may be any one of the following:

               •   "*firefox [absolute path]"

                   Automatically launch a new Firefox process using a custom Firefox profile.  This profile will
                   be automatically configured to use the Selenium Server as a proxy and to  have  all  annoying
                   prompts  ("save  your  password?"  "forms  are insecure" "make Firefox your default browser?"
                   disabled.  You may optionally specify an absolute path to your firefox  executable,  or  just
                   say  "*firefox".   If  no absolute path is specified, we'll look for firefox.exe in a default
                   location (normally c:\program files\mozilla firefox\firefox.exe), which you can  override  by
                   setting the Java system property "firefoxDefaultPath" to the correct path to Firefox.

               •   "*iexplore [absolute path]"

                   Automatically  launch a new Internet Explorer process using custom Windows registry settings.
                   This process will be automatically configured to use the Selenium Server as a  proxy  and  to
                   have  all  annoying  prompts  ("save  your password?" "forms are insecure" "make Firefox your
                   default browser?" disabled.  You may optionally specify an absolute  path  to  your  iexplore
                   executable,  or  just  say  "*iexplore".   If  no  absolute path is specified, we'll look for
                   iexplore.exe    in    a    default    location    (normally     c:\program     files\internet
                   explorer\iexplore.exe),   which  you  can  override  by  setting  the  Java  system  property
                   "iexploreDefaultPath" to the correct path to Internet Explorer.

               •   "/path/to/my/browser [other arguments]"

                   You may also simply specify the absolute path to your browser executable, or use  a  relative
                   path to your executable (which we'll try to find on your path).  <b>Warning:</b> If you specify your
                   own  custom  browser, it's up to you to configure it correctly.  At a minimum, you'll need to
                   configure your browser to use the Selenium Server  as  a  proxy,  and  disable  all  browser-
                   specific prompting.

           •   "auto_stop"

               Defaults  to true, and will attempt to close the browser if the object goes out of scope and stop
               hasn't been called.

           •   "keep_alive"

               Number of connections LWP should cache. This is just a minor speed improvement. Defaults to 5.

           •   "http_method"&gt;

               Choose which HTTP method should be used for requests to the Selenium server.  Only GET  and  POST
               are supported.

           $locator is an element locator
       $sel-&gt;mouse_move_at($locator, $coord_string)
           Simulates a user pressing the mouse button (without releasing it yet) onthe specified element.

           $locator is an element locator
           $coord_string is specifies the x,y position (i.e. - 10,20) of the mouse      event relative to the
           element returned by the locator.
       $sel-&gt;type($locator, $value)
           Sets the value of an input field, as though you typed it in.  Can also be used to set  the  value  of
           combo  boxes,  check boxes, etc. In these cases,value should be the value of the option selected, not
           the visible text.

           $locator is an element locator
           $value is the value to type
       $sel-&gt;type_keys($locator, $value)
           Simulates keystroke events on the specified element, as though you typed the value key-by-key.   This
           is  a  convenience  method  for calling keyDown, keyUp, keyPress for every character in the specified
           string;this is useful for dynamic UI widgets (like auto-completing combo boxes) that require explicit
           key events.

           Unlike the simple "type" command, which forces the specified  value  into  the  page  directly,  this
           commandmay  or may not have any visible effect, even in cases where typing keys would normally have a
           visible effect.For example, if you use "typeKeys" on a form element, you  may  or  may  not  see  the
           results of what you typed inthe field.

           In  some  cases, you may need to use the simple "type" command to set the value of the field and then
           the "typeKeys" command tosend the keystroke events corresponding to what you just typed.

           $locator is an element locator
           $value is the value to type
       $sel-&gt;set_speed($value)
           Set execution speed (i.e., set the millisecond length of a delay  which  will  follow  each  selenium
           operation).  By default, there is no such delay, i.e.,the delay is 0 milliseconds.

           $value is the number of milliseconds to pause after operation
       $sel-&gt;<b>get_speed()</b>
           Get  execution  speed  (i.e.,  get  the  millisecond  length  of  the  delay  following each selenium
           operation).  By default, there is no such delay, i.e.,the delay is 0 milliseconds.See also setSpeed.

           Returns the execution speed in milliseconds.
       $sel-&gt;check($locator)
           Check a toggle-button (checkbox/radio)

           $locator is an element locator
       $sel-&gt;uncheck($locator)
           Uncheck a toggle-button (checkbox/radio)

           $locator is an element locator
       $sel-&gt;select($select_locator, $option_locator)
           Select an option from a drop-down using an option locator.  Option locators provide different ways of
           specifying options  of  an  HTMLSelect  element  (e.g.  for  selecting  a  specific  option,  or  for
           assertingthat the selected option satisfies a specification). There are severalforms of Select Option
           Locator.

           •   <b>label</b>=<u>labelPattern</u>:matches  options  based  on  their  labels, i.e. the visible text. (Thisis the
               default.)

               •   label=regexp:^[Oo]ther

           •   <b>value</b>=<u>valuePattern</u>:matches options based on their values.

               •   value=other

           •   <b>id</b>=<u>id</u>:matches options based on their ids.

               •   id=option1

           •   <b>index</b>=<u>index</u>:matches an option based on its index (offset from zero).

               •   index=2

           If no option locator prefix is provided, the default behaviour is to match on <b>label</b>.

           $select_locator is an element locator identifying a drop-down menu
           $option_locator is an option locator (a label by default)
       $sel-&gt;add_selection($locator, $option_locator)
           Add a selection to the set of selected options in a multi-select element using an option locator.@see
           #doSelect for details of option locators

           $locator is an element locator identifying a multi-select box
           $option_locator is an option locator (a label by default)
       $sel-&gt;remove_selection($locator, $option_locator)
           Remove a selection from the set of selected  options  in  a  multi-select  element  using  an  option
           locator.@see #doSelect for details of option locators

           $locator is an element locator identifying a multi-select box
           $option_locator is an option locator (a label by default)
       $sel-&gt;remove_all_selections($locator)
           Unselects all of the selected options in a multi-select element.

           $locator is an element locator identifying a multi-select box
       $sel-&gt;submit($form_locator)
           Submit  the specified form. This is particularly useful for forms withoutsubmit buttons, e.g. single-
           input "Search" forms.

           $form_locator is an element locator for the form you want to submit
       $sel-&gt;open($url)
           Opens an URL in the test frame. This accepts both relative and absoluteURLs.The "open" command  waits
           for  the page to load before proceeding,ie. the "AndWait" suffix is implicit.<u>Note</u>: The URL must be on
           the same domain as the runner HTMLdue to security restrictions in the browser (Same  Origin  Policy).
           If youneed to open an URL on another domain, use the Selenium Server to start anew browser session on
           that domain.

           $url is the URL to open; may be relative or absolute
       $sel-&gt;open_window($url, $window_id)
           Opens  a  popup window (if a window with that ID isn't already open).After opening the window, you'll
           need to select it using the selectWindowcommand.  This command can also be a  useful  workaround  for
           bug  SEL-339.  In some cases, Selenium will be unable to intercept a call to window.open (if the call
           occurs during or before the "onLoad" event, for example).In those cases, you can  force  Selenium  to
           notice  the  open  window's name by using the Selenium openWindow command, usingan empty (blank) url,
           like this: openWindow("", "myFunnyWindow").

           $url is the URL to open, which can be blank
           $window_id is the JavaScript window ID of the window to select
       $sel-&gt;select_window($window_id)
           Selects a popup window using a window locator; once a popup window has been selected, allcommands  go
           to  that  window.  To  select  the main window again, use nullas the target.  Window locators provide
           different ways of specifying the window  object:by  title,  by  internal  JavaScript  "name,"  or  by
           JavaScript variable.

           •   <b>title</b>=<u>My</u>  <u>Special</u>  <u>Window</u>:Finds  the  window  using  the  text that appears in the title bar.  Be
               careful;two windows can share the same title.  If that happens, this locator willjust pick one.

           •   <b>name</b>=<u>myWindow</u>:Finds the window using its internal JavaScript "name" property.  This is the second
               parameter  "windowName"  passed   to   the   JavaScript   method   window.open(url,   windowName,
               windowFeatures, replaceFlag)(which Selenium intercepts).

           •   <b>var</b>=<u>variableName</u>:Some  pop-up  windows  are  unnamed  (anonymous),  but  are  associated  with  a
               JavaScript variable name in the currentapplication window, e.g. "window.foo = window.open(url);".
               In those cases, you can open the window using"var=foo".

           If no window locator prefix is provided, we'll try to guess what you mean like this:

           1.) if windowID is null, (or the string "null") then it is assumed  the  user  is  referring  to  the
           original window instantiated by the browser).

           2.) if the value of the "windowID" parameter is a JavaScript variable name in the current application
           window,  then it is assumedthat this variable contains the return value from a call to the JavaScript
           window.<b>open()</b> method.

           3.) Otherwise, selenium looks in a hash it maintains that maps string names to window "names".

           4.) If <u>that</u> fails, we'll try looping over all of the known windows to try  to  find  the  appropriate
           "title".Since "title" is not necessarily unique, this may have unexpected behavior.

           If  you're  having trouble figuring out the name of a window that you want to manipulate, look at the
           Selenium log messageswhich identify the names of  windows  created  via  window.open  (and  therefore
           intercepted by Selenium).  You will see messageslike the following for each window as it is opened:

           "debug:  window.open  call  intercepted;  window  ID  (which  you  can  use  with  selectWindow()) is
           "myNewWindow""

           In some cases, Selenium will be unable to intercept a call to window.open (if the call occurs  during
           or  before  the  "onLoad"  event,  for example).(This is bug SEL-339.)  In those cases, you can force
           Selenium to notice the open window's name by using the Selenium  openWindow  command,  usingan  empty
           (blank) url, like this: openWindow("", "myFunnyWindow").

           $window_id is the JavaScript window ID of the window to select
       $sel-&gt;select_pop_up($window_id)
           Simplifies  the  process  of  selecting  a  popup window (and does not offerfunctionality beyond what
           "selectWindow()" already provides).

           •   If "windowID" is either not specified,  or  specified  as"null",  the  first  non-top  window  is
               selected.  The  top window is the onethat would be selected by "selectWindow()" without providing
               a"windowID" . This should not be used when more than one popupwindow is in play.

           •   Otherwise, the window will be looked up considering"windowID" as the following in order:  1)  the
               "name"  of  thewindow,  as  specified  to  "window.open()";  2)  a  javascriptvariable which is a
               reference to a window; and 3) the title of thewindow. This is the same ordered  lookup  performed
               by"selectWindow" .

           $window_id is an identifier for the popup window, which can take on a                  number of
           different meanings
       $sel-&gt;<b>deselect_pop_up()</b>
           Selects  the  main  window.  Functionally equivalent to using"selectWindow()" and specifying no value
           for"windowID".

       $sel-&gt;select_frame($locator)
           Selects a frame within the current window.  (You may invoke  this  commandmultiple  times  to  select
           nested  frames.)   To  select  the parent frame, use"relative=parent" as a locator; to select the top
           frame, use "relative=top".You can also select a frame by its 0-based index number; select  the  first
           frame  with"index=0",  or  the  third  frame  with  "index=2".   You may also use a DOM expression to
           identify the frame you want directly,like this: "dom=frames["main"].frames["subframe"]"

           $locator is an element locator identifying a frame or iframe
       $sel-&gt;get_whether_this_frame_match_frame_expression($current_frame_string, $target)
           Determine whether current/locator identify the frame containing this running code.  This is useful in
           proxy injection mode, where this code runs in  everybrowser  frame  and  window,  and  sometimes  the
           selenium server needs to identifythe "current" frame.  In this case, when the test calls selectFrame,
           thisroutine  is  called  for  each frame to figure out which one has been selected.The selected frame
           will return true, while all others will return false.

           $current_frame_string is starting frame
           $target is new frame (which might be relative to the current one)
           Returns true if the new frame is this code's window
       $sel-&gt;get_whether_this_window_match_window_expression($current_window_string, $target)
           Determine whether currentWindowString plus target identify the window containing this  running  code.
           This  is  useful  in proxy injection mode, where this code runs in everybrowser frame and window, and
           sometimes the selenium server needs to identifythe "current" window.  In this  case,  when  the  test
           calls  selectWindow,  thisroutine  is  called  for  each  window  to  figure  out  which one has been
           selected.The selected window will return true, while all others will return false.

           $current_window_string is starting window
           $target is new window (which might be relative to the current one, e.g., "_parent")
           Returns true if the new window is this code's window
       $sel-&gt;wait_for_pop_up($window_id, $timeout)
           Waits for a popup window to appear and load up.

           $window_id is the JavaScript window "name" of the window that will appear (not the text of the title
           bar)                 If unspecified, or specified as "null", this command will                 wait
           for the first non-top window to appear (don't rely                 on this if you are working with
           multiple popups                 simultaneously).
           $timeout is a timeout in milliseconds, after which the action will return with an error.
           If this value is not specified, the default Selenium                timeout will be used. See the
           <b>setTimeout()</b> command.
       $sel-&gt;<b>choose_cancel_on_next_confirmation()</b>
           By default, Selenium's overridden window.<b>confirm()</b> function willreturn  true,  as  if  the  user  had
           manually  clicked  OK;  after  runningthis  command, the next call to <b>confirm()</b> will return false, as
           ifthe user had clicked Cancel.  Selenium will  then  resume  using  thedefault  behavior  for  future
           confirmations,  automatically  returning  true (OK) unless/until you explicitly call this command for
           eachconfirmation.

           Take  note  -  every  time  a  confirmation  comes  up,  you  mustconsume  it  with  a  corresponding
           getConfirmation, or elsethe next selenium operation will fail.

       $sel-&gt;<b>choose_ok_on_next_confirmation()</b>
           Undo   the   effect   of  calling  chooseCancelOnNextConfirmation.   Notethat  Selenium's  overridden
           window.<b>confirm()</b> function will normally automaticallyreturn true, as if the user had manually clicked
           OK, so you shouldn'tneed to use this command unless for some reason you need to changeyour mind prior
           to the next confirmation.  After any confirmation, Selenium will resume using thedefault behavior for
           future  confirmations,  automatically  returning  true  (OK)   unless/until   you   explicitly   call
           chooseCancelOnNextConfirmation for eachconfirmation.

           Take  note  -  every  time  a  confirmation  comes  up,  you  mustconsume  it  with  a  corresponding
           getConfirmation, or elsethe next selenium operation will fail.

       $sel-&gt;answer_on_next_prompt($answer)
           Instructs Selenium to return the specified answer string in response  tothe  next  JavaScript  prompt
           [window.<b>prompt()</b>].

           $answer is the answer to give in response to the prompt pop-up
       $sel-&gt;<b>go_back()</b>
           Simulates the user clicking the "back" button on their browser.

       $sel-&gt;<b>refresh()</b>
           Simulates the user clicking the "Refresh" button on their browser.

       $sel-&gt;<b>close()</b>
           Simulates the user clicking the "close" button in the titlebar of a popupwindow or tab.

       $sel-&gt;<b>is_alert_present()</b>
           Has an alert occurred?  This function never throws an exception

           Returns true if there is an alert
       $sel-&gt;<b>is_prompt_present()</b>
           Has a prompt occurred?  This function never throws an exception

           Returns true if there is a pending prompt
       $sel-&gt;<b>is_confirmation_present()</b>
           Has <b>confirm()</b> been called?  This function never throws an exception

           Returns true if there is a pending confirmation
       $sel-&gt;<b>get_alert()</b>
           Retrieves  the  message  of a JavaScript alert generated during the previous action, or fail if there
           were no alerts.  Getting an alert has the  same  effect  as  manually  clicking  OK.  If  analert  is
           generated but you do not consume it with getAlert, the next Selenium actionwill fail.

           Under Selenium, JavaScript alerts will NOT pop up a visible alertdialog.

           Selenium  does NOT support JavaScript alerts that are generated in apage's <b>onload()</b> event handler. In
           this case a visible dialog WILL begenerated and Selenium will hang until someone manually clicks OK.

           Returns The message of the most recent JavaScript alert
       $sel-&gt;<b>get_confirmation()</b>
           Retrieves the message of a JavaScript confirmation dialog generated duringthe  previous  action.   By
           default,  the  confirm function will return true, having the same effectas manually clicking OK. This
           can be changed by prior execution of thechooseCancelOnNextConfirmation command.

           If an confirmation is generated but you do not consume  it  with  getConfirmation,the  next  Selenium
           action will fail.

           NOTE: under Selenium, JavaScript confirmations will NOT pop up a visibledialog.

           NOTE: Selenium does NOT support JavaScript confirmations that aregenerated in a page's <b>onload()</b> event
           handler.  In  this  case  a visibledialog WILL be generated and Selenium will hang until you manually
           clickOK.

           Returns the message of the most recent JavaScript confirmation dialog
       $sel-&gt;<b>get_prompt()</b>
           Retrieves the message of a JavaScript question prompt dialog  generated  duringthe  previous  action.
           Successful  handling  of  the  prompt requires prior execution of theanswerOnNextPrompt command. If a
           prompt is generated but youdo not get/verify it, the next Selenium action will fail.

           NOTE: under Selenium, JavaScript prompts will NOT pop up a visibledialog.

           NOTE: Selenium does NOT support JavaScript prompts that  are  generated  in  apage's  <b>onload()</b>  event
           handler. In this case a visible dialog WILL begenerated and Selenium will hang until someone manually
           clicks OK.

           Returns the message of the most recent JavaScript question prompt
       $sel-&gt;<b>get_location()</b>
           Gets the absolute URL of the current page.

           Returns the absolute URL of the current page
       $sel-&gt;<b>get_title()</b>
           Gets the title of the current page.

           Returns the title of the current page
       $sel-&gt;<b>get_body_text()</b>
           Gets the entire text of the page.

           Returns the entire text of the page
       $sel-&gt;get_value($locator)
           Gets  the  (whitespace-trimmed) value of an input field (or anything else with a value parameter).For
           checkbox/radio elements, the value will be "on" or "off" depending onwhether the element  is  checked
           or not.

           $locator is an element locator
           Returns the element value, or "on/off" for checkbox/radio elements
       $sel-&gt;get_text($locator)
           Gets  the  text of an element. This works for any element that containstext. This command uses either
           the textContent (Mozilla-like browsers) orthe innerText (IE-like browsers) of the element,  which  is
           the renderedtext shown to the user.

           $locator is an element locator
           Returns the text of the element
       $sel-&gt;highlight($locator)
           Briefly changes the backgroundColor of the specified element yellow.  Useful for debugging.

           $locator is an element locator
       $sel-&gt;get_eval($script)
           Gets  the result of evaluating the specified JavaScript snippet.  The snippet mayhave multiple lines,
           but only the result of the last line will be returned.  Note that, by default, the snippet  will  run
           in  the  context  of  the  "selenium"object itself, so "this" will refer to the Selenium object.  Use
           "window" torefer to the window of your application, e.g. "window.document.getElementById('foo')"

           If you need to usea locator to refer to a  single  element  in  your  application  page,  you  canuse
           "this.browserbot.findElement("id=foo")" where "id=foo" is your locator.

           $script is the JavaScript snippet to run
           Returns the results of evaluating the snippet
       $sel-&gt;is_checked($locator)
           Gets  whether  a  toggle-button  (checkbox/radio) is checked.  Fails if the specified element doesn't
           exist or isn't a toggle-button.

           $locator is an element locator pointing to a checkbox or radio button
           Returns true if the checkbox is checked, false otherwise
       $sel-&gt;get_table($table_cell_address)
           Gets the text from a cell of a table. The cellAddress syntaxtableLocator.row.column,  where  row  and
           column start at 0.

           $table_cell_address is a cell address, e.g. "foo.1.4"
           Returns the text from the specified cell
       $sel-&gt;get_selected_labels($select_locator)
           Gets  all  option  labels (visible text) for selected options in the specified select or multi-select
           element.

           e.g., "+70,-300"
       $sel-&gt;set_mouse_speed($pixels)
           Configure  the  number of pixels between "mousemove" events during dragAndDrop commands (default=10).
           Setting this value to 0 means that we'll send a "mousemove" event to every single pixelin between the
           start location and the end location; that can be very slow, and maycause some browsers to  force  the
           JavaScript to timeout.

           If  the  mouse speed is greater than the distance between the two dragged objects, we'lljust send one
           "mousemove" at the start location and then one final one at the end location.

           $pixels is the number of pixels between "mousemove" events
       $sel-&gt;<b>get_mouse_speed()</b>
           Returns the number of pixels between "mousemove" events during dragAndDrop commands (default=10).

       $sel-&gt;set_cursor_position($locator, $position)
           Moves the text cursor to the specified position in the given input element  or  textarea.This  method
           will fail if the specified element isn't an input element or textarea.

           $locator is an element locator pointing to an input element or textarea
           $position is the numerical position of the cursor in the field; position should be 0 to move the
           position to the beginning of the field.  You can also set the cursor to -1 to move it to the end of
           the field.
       $sel-&gt;get_element_index($locator)
           Get the relative index of an element to its parent (starting from 0). The comment node and empty text
           nodewill be ignored.

       $sel-&gt;is_ordered($locator1, $locator2)
           Check  if  these two elements have same parent and are ordered siblings in the DOM. Two same elements
           willnot be considered ordered.

           $locator1 is an element locator pointing to the first element
           $locator2 is an element locator pointing to the second element
           Returns true if element1 is the previous sibling of element2, false otherwise
       $sel-&gt;get_element_position_left($locator)
           Retrieves the horizontal position of an element

           $locator is an element locator pointing to an element OR an element itself

       $sel-&gt;get_cursor_position($locator)
           Retrieves the text cursor position in the given input element or textarea; beware, this may not  work
           perfectly  on  all  browsers.   Specifically, if the cursor/selection has been cleared by JavaScript,
           this command will tend toreturn the position of the last location of  the  cursor,  even  though  the
           cursor  is now gone from the page.  This is filed as <a href="http://jira.openqa.org/browse/SEL-243">http://jira.openqa.org/browse/SEL-243</a> (SEL-243).
           This method will fail if the specified element isn't an input element or textarea,  or  there  is  no
           cursor in the element.

           $locator is an element locator pointing to an input element or textarea
           Returns the numerical position of the cursor in the field
       $sel-&gt;get_expression($expression)
           Returns  the  specified expression.  This is useful because of JavaScript preprocessing.It is used to
           generate commands like assertExpression and waitForExpression.

           $expression is the value to return
           Returns the value passed in
       $sel-&gt;get_xpath_count($xpath)
           Returns the number of nodes that match the specified xpath, eg. "//table"  would  givethe  number  of
           tables.

           $xpath is the xpath expression to evaluate. do NOT wrap this expression in a '<b>count()</b>' function; we
           will do that for you.
           Returns the number of nodes that match the specified xpath
       $sel-&gt;assign_id($locator, $identifier)
           Temporarily sets the "id" attribute of the specified element, so you can locate it in the futureusing
           its ID rather than a slow/complicated XPath.  This ID will disappear once the page isreloaded.

           $locator is an element locator pointing to an element
           $identifier is a string to be used as the ID of the specified element
       $sel-&gt;allow_native_xpath($allow)
           Specifies  whether  Selenium  should  use the native in-browser implementationof XPath (if any native
           version is available); if you pass "false" tothis function, we will always  use  our  pure-JavaScript
           xpath  library.Using  the  pure-JS xpath library can improve the consistency of xpathelement locators
           between  different  browser  vendors,  but  the  pure-JSversion  is  much  slower  than  the   native
           implementations.

           $allow is boolean, true means we'll prefer to use native XPath; false means we'll only use JS XPath
       $sel-&gt;ignore_attributes_without_value($ignore)
           Specifies whether Selenium will ignore xpath attributes that have novalue, i.e. are the empty string,
           when  using  the  non-native xpathevaluation engine. You'd want to do this for performance reasons in
           IE.However, this could break certain xpaths, for example an xpath that looksfor  an  attribute  whose
           value  is  NOT  the  empty  string.The  hope  is  that  such xpaths are relatively rare, but the user
           shouldhave the option of using them. Note that this only influences xpathevaluation  when  using  the
           ajaxslt engine (i.e. not "javascript-xpath").

           $ignore is boolean, true means we'll ignore attributes without value at the expense of xpath
           "correctness"; false means we'll sacrifice speed for correctness.
       $sel-&gt;wait_for_condition($script, $timeout)
           Runs  the  specified  JavaScript snippet repeatedly until it evaluates to "true".The snippet may have
           multiple lines, but only the result of the last linewill be considered.  Note that, by  default,  the
           snippet  will  be  run  in the runner's test window, not in the windowof your application. To get the
           window      of      your      application,      you      can      usethe      JavaScript      snippet
           "selenium.browserbot.getCurrentWindow()", and thenrun your JavaScript in there

           $script is the JavaScript snippet to run
           $timeout is a timeout in milliseconds, after which this command will return with an error
       $sel-&gt;set_timeout($timeout)
           Specifies  the  amount of time that Selenium will wait for actions to complete.  Actions that require
           waiting include "open" and the "waitFor*" actions.  The default timeout is 30 seconds.

           $timeout is a timeout in milliseconds, after which the action will return with an error
       $sel-&gt;wait_for_page_to_load($timeout)
           Waits for a new page to  load.   You  can  use  this  command  instead  of  the  "AndWait"  suffixes,
           "clickAndWait", "selectAndWait", "typeAndWait" etc.(which are only available in the JS API).

           Selenium  constantly  keeps  track of new pages loading, and sets a "newPageLoaded"flag when it first
           notices a page load.  Running any other Selenium command afterturns the flag to false.  Hence, if you
           want to wait for a page to load, you mustwait immediately after a  Selenium  command  that  caused  a
           page-load.

           $timeout is a timeout in milliseconds, after which this command will return with an error
       $sel-&gt;wait_for_frame_to_load($frame_address, $timeout)
           Waits  for a new frame to load.  Selenium constantly keeps track of new pages and frames loading, and
           sets a "newPageLoaded" flag when it first notices  a  page  load.   See  waitForPageToLoad  for  more
           information.

           $frame_address is FrameAddress from the server side
           $timeout is a timeout in milliseconds, after which this command will return with an error
       $sel-&gt;<b>get_cookie()</b>
           Return all cookies of the current page under test.

           Returns all cookies of the current page under test
       $sel-&gt;get_cookie_by_name($name)
           Returns  the  value  of  the  cookie with the specified name, or throws an error if the cookie is not
           present.

           $name is the name of the cookie
           Returns the value of the cookie
       $sel-&gt;is_cookie_present($name)
           Returns true if a cookie with the specified name is present, or false otherwise.

           $name is the name of the cookie
           Returns true if a cookie with the specified name is present, or false otherwise.
       $sel-&gt;create_cookie($name_value_pair, $options_string)
           Create a new cookie whose path and domain are same with those of current pageunder test,  unless  you
           specified a path for this cookie explicitly.

           $name_value_pair is name and value of the cookie in a format "name=value"
           $options_string is options for the cookie. Currently supported options include 'path', 'max_age' and
           'domain'.      the optionsString's format is "path=/path/, max_age=60, domain=.foo.com". The order of
           options are irrelevant, the unit      of the value of 'max_age' is second.  Note that specifying a
           domain that isn't a subset of the current domain will      usually fail.
       $sel-&gt;delete_cookie($name, $options_string)
           Delete  a  named  cookie  with specified path and domain.  Be careful; to delete a cookie, youneed to
           delete it using the exact same path and domain that were used to create the  cookie.If  the  path  is
           wrong, or the domain is wrong, the cookie simply won't be deleted.  Alsonote that specifying a domain
           that  isn't  a  subset  of  the  current domain will usually fail.Since there's no way to discover at
           runtime the original path and domain of a given cookie,we've added an option called 'recurse' to  try
           all  sub-domains  of the current domain withall paths that are a subset of the current path.  Beware;
           this option can be slow.  Inbig-O notation, it operates in O(n*m) time, where n is the number of dots
           in the domainname and m is the number of slashes in the path.

           $name is the name of the cookie to be deleted
           $options_string is options for the cookie. Currently supported options include 'path', 'domain'
           and 'recurse.' The optionsString's format is "path=/path/, domain=.foo.com, recurse=true".      The
           order of options are irrelevant. Note that specifying a domain that isn't a subset of      the
           current domain will usually fail.
       $sel-&gt;<b>delete_all_visible_cookies()</b>
           Calls deleteCookie with recurse=true on all cookies visible to  the  current  page.As  noted  on  the
           documentation for deleteCookie, recurse=true can be much slowerthan simply deleting the cookies using
           a known domain/path.

       $sel-&gt;set_browser_log_level($log_level)
           Sets  the  threshold  for  browser-side logging messages; log messages beneath this threshold will be
           discarded.Valid logLevel strings are: "debug", "info", "warn", "error" or "off".To  see  the  browser
           logs,  you  need toeither show the log window in GUI mode, or enable browser-side logging in Selenium
           RC.

           $log_level is one of the following: "debug", "info", "warn", "error" or "off"
       $sel-&gt;run_script($script)
           Creates a new "script" tag in the body of the current test window, and adds the specified  text  into
           the  body  of  the  command.   Scripts  run inthis way can often be debugged more easily than scripts
           executed usingSelenium's "getEval" command.  Beware that JS exceptions  thrown  in  these  scripttags
           aren't  managed  by  Selenium, so you should probably wrap your scriptin try/catch blocks if there is
           any chance that the script will throwan exception.

           $script is the JavaScript snippet to run
       $sel-&gt;add_location_strategy($strategy_name)
           Defines a new function for Selenium to locate elements on the  page.For  example,if  you  define  the
           strategy  "foo",  and  someone runs click("foo=blah"), we'llrun your function, passing you the string
           "blah", and click on the element that your functionreturns, or throw an "Element not found" error  if
           your function returns null.We'll pass three arguments to your function:

           •   locator: the string the user passed in

           •   inWindow: the currently selected window

           •   inDocument: the currently selected document

           The function must return null if the element can't be found.

           $strategy_name is the name of the strategy to define; this should use only   letters [a-zA-Z] with no
           spaces or other punctuation.
       $sel-&gt;capture_entire_page_screenshot($filename, $kwargs)
           Saves  the  entire  contents  of  the  current  window  canvas  to  a PNG file.Contrast this with the
           captureScreenshot command, which captures thecontents of the OS viewport (i.e. whatever is  currently
           being  displayedon  the  monitor),  and  is  implemented  in the RC only. Currently this onlyworks in
           Firefox when running in chrome mode, and in IE non-HTA usingthe EXPERIMENTAL "Snapsie"  utility.  The
           Firefox   implementation   is   mostlyborrowed   from   the  Screengrab!  Firefox  extension.  Please
           see<a href="http://www.screengrab.org">http://www.screengrab.org</a> and <a href="http://snapsie.sourceforge.net/">http://snapsie.sourceforge.net/</a> fordetails.

           $filename is the path to the file to persist the screenshot as. No filename extension will be
           appended by default.  Directories will not be created if they do not exist, and an exception will be
           thrown, possibly by native code.
           $kwargs is a kwargs string that modifies the way the screenshot is captured. Example:
           "background=#CCFFDD". Currently valid options:
               background the background CSS for the HTML document. This may be useful to set for capturing
               screenshots of less-than-ideal layouts, for example where absolute positioning causes the
               calculation of the canvas dimension to fail and a black background is exposed (possibly obscuring
               black text).
       $sel-&gt;rollup($rollup_name, $kwargs)
           Executes a command rollup, which is a series of commands with a uniquename, and optionally  arguments
           that  control  the  generation of the set ofcommands. If any one of the rolled-up commands fails, the
           rollup isconsidered to have failed. Rollups may also contain nested rollups.

           $rollup_name is the name of the rollup command
           $kwargs is keyword arguments string that influences how the rollup expands into commands
       $sel-&gt;add_script($script_content, $script_tag_id)
           Loads script content into a new script tag in the Selenium document. Thisdiffers from  the  runScript
           command  in  that runScript adds the script tagto the document of the AUT, not the Selenium document.
           The followingentities in the script content are replaced by the characters they represent: &amp;lt;  &amp;gt;
           &amp;amp;The corresponding remove command is removeScript.

           $script_content is the Javascript content of the script to add
           $script_tag_id is (optional) the id of the new script tag. If specified, and an element with this id
           already exists, this operation will fail.
       $sel-&gt;remove_script($script_tag_id)
           Removes  a  script  tag  from  the  Selenium  document identified by the givenid. Does nothing if the
           referenced tag doesn't exist.

           $script_tag_id is the id of the script element to remove.
       $sel-&gt;use_xpath_library($library_name)
           Allows choice of one of the available libraries.

           $library_name is name of the desired library Only the following three can be chosen:
               •   "ajaxslt" - Google's library

               •   "javascript-xpath" - Cybozu Labs' faster library

               •   "default" - The default library.  Currently the default library is "ajaxslt" .

                If libraryName isn't one of these three, then  no change will be made.

       $sel-&gt;set_context($context)
           Writes a message to the status bar and adds a note to the browser-sidelog.

           $context is the message to be sent to the browser
       $sel-&gt;attach_file($field_locator, $file_locator)
           Sets a file input (upload) field to the file listed in fileLocator

           $field_locator is an element locator
           $file_locator is a URL pointing to the specified file. Before the file  can be set in the input field
           (fieldLocator), Selenium RC may need to transfer the file to the local machine before attaching the
           file in a web page form. This is common in selenium  grid configurations where the RC server driving
           the browser is not the same  machine that started the test. Supported Browsers: Firefox ("*chrome")
           only.
       $sel-&gt;capture_screenshot($filename)
           Captures a PNG screenshot to the specified file.

           $filename is the absolute path to the file to be written, e.g. "c:\blah\screenshot.png"
       $sel-&gt;<b>capture_screenshot_to_string()</b>
           Capture a PNG screenshot.  It then returns the file as a base 64 encoded string.

           Returns The base 64 encoded string of the screen shot (PNG file)
       $sel-&gt;capture_entire_page_screenshot_to_string($kwargs)
           Downloads a screenshot of the browser current window canvas to a  based  64  encoded  PNG  file.  The
           <u>entire</u> windows canvas is captured,including parts rendered outside of the current view port.Currently
           this only works in Mozilla and when running in chrome mode.

           $kwargs is A kwargs string that modifies the way the screenshot is captured. Example:
           "background=#CCFFDD". This may be useful to set for capturing screenshots of less-than-ideal layouts,
           for example where absolute positioning causes the calculation of the canvas dimension to fail and a
           black background is exposed  (possibly obscuring black text).
           Returns The base 64 encoded string of the page screenshot (PNG file)
       $sel-&gt;<b>shut_down_selenium_server()</b>
           Kills  the running Selenium Server and all browser sessions.  After you run this command, you will no
           longer be able to sendcommands to the server; you can't remotely start the server once  it  has  been
           stopped.   Normallyyou  should prefer to run the "stop" command, which terminates the current browser
           session, rather than shutting down the entire server.

       $sel-&gt;<b>retrieve_last_remote_control_logs()</b>
           Retrieve the  last  messages  logged  on  a  specific  remote  control.  Useful  for  error  reports,
           especiallywhen  running  multiple remote controls in a distributed environment. The maximum number of
           log messagesthat can be retrieve is configured on remote control startup.

           Returns The last N log messages as a multi-line string.
       $sel-&gt;key_down_native($keycode)
           Simulates a user pressing a key (without releasing it yet)  by  sending  a  native  operating  system
           keystroke.This  function  uses  the  java.awt.Robot  class  to send a keystroke; this more accurately
           simulates typinga  key  on  the  keyboard.   It  does  not  honor  settings  from  the  shiftKeyDown,
           controlKeyDown,  altKeyDown andmetaKeyDown commands, and does not target any particular HTML element.
           To send a keystroke to a particularelement, focus on the element first before running this command.

           $keycode is an integer keycode number corresponding to a java.awt.event.KeyEvent; note that Java
           keycodes are NOT the same thing as JavaScript keycodes!
       $sel-&gt;key_up_native($keycode)
           Simulates a user releasing a key by sending a native operating system  keystroke.This  function  uses
           the  java.awt.Robot  class  to  send  a  keystroke; this more accurately simulates typinga key on the
           keyboard.   It  does  not  honor  settings  from   the   shiftKeyDown,   controlKeyDown,   altKeyDown
