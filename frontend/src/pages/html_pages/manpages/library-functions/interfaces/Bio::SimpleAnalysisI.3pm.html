</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Bio::SimpleAnalysisI - A simple interface to any (local or remote) analysis tool

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       This is an interface module - you do not instantiate it.  Use other modules instead (those that implement
       this interface).

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This interface contains public methods for accessing and controlling local and remote analysis tools. It
       is meant to be used on the client side. The interface consists only of a necessary set of methods for
       synchronous invocation of analysis tools. For more complex set, including an asynchronous access, see
       interface "Bio::AnalysisI" (which inherits from this one, by the way).

</pre><h4><b>FEEDBACK</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Mailing</b> <b>Lists</b>
       User feedback is an integral part of the evolution of this and other Bioperl modules. Send your comments
       and suggestions preferably to the Bioperl mailing list.  Your participation is much appreciated.

       This is actually the main documentation...

       If you try to call any of these methods directly on this "Bio::SimpleAnalysisI" object you will get a <u>not</u>
       <u>implemented</u> error message.

   <b>analysis_name</b>
        Usage   : $tool-&gt;analysis_name;
        Returns : a name of this analysis
        Args    : none

   <b>analysis_spec</b>
        Usage   : $tool-&gt;analysis_spec;
        Returns : a hash reference describing this analysis
        Args    : none

       The  returned  hash  reference  uses  the  following keys (not all of them always present, perhaps others
       present as well): "name", "type", "version", "supplier", "installation", "description".

   <b>input_spec</b>
        Usage   : $tool-&gt;input_spec;
        Returns : an array reference with hashes as elements
        Args    : none

       The analysis input data are named, and can be also associated with a default value, with  allowed  values
       and  with few other attributes. The names are important for feeding the analysis with the input data (the
       inputs are given to methods "run" and "wait_for" as name/value pairs).

   <b>result_spec</b>
        Usage   : $tool-&gt;result_spec;
        Returns : a hash reference with result names as keys
                  and result types as values
        Args    : none

       An analysis can produce several results, or the same  result  in  several  different  formats.  All  such
       results are named and can be retrieved using their names by metod "result".

       Here is an example of the result specification:

         $result_spec = {
                 'outseq' =&gt; 'String',
                 'report' =&gt; 'String',
                 'detailed_status' =&gt; 'String'
               };

   <b>run</b>
        Usage   : $tool-&gt;run ( ['sequence=@my.seq', 'osformat=embl'] )
        Returns : $self
        Args    : data and parameters for this execution
                  (in various formats)

       Create  a  job,  start it, and wait for its completion. The method is identical to the method "wait_for".
       Why there are two methods doing the same? Because it is expected that the sub-classes may implement  them
       differently  (an  example  is  an  interface "Bio::AnalysisI" which uses method "run" for an asynchronous
       execution and method "wait_for" for a synchronous one.

       Usually, after this call, you ask for results of the finished job:

           $analysis-&gt;run (...)-&gt;result;

       The input data and prameters for this execution can be specified in various ways:

       array reference
           The array has scalar elements of the form

              name = [[@]value]

           where "name" is the name of an input data or input parameter (see  method  "input_spec"  for  finding
           what  names  are  recognized  by  this  analysis)  and "value" is a value for this data/parameter. If
           "value" is missing a 1 is assumed (which is convenient for the boolean options).  If  "value"  starts
           with "@" it is treated as a local filename, and its contents is used as the data/parameter value.

       hash reference
           The same as with the array reference but now there is no need to use an equal sign. The hash keys are
           input names and hash values their data. The values can again start with a "@" sign indicating a local
           filename.

   <b>wait_for</b>
        Usage   : $tool-&gt;wait_for ( { 'sequence' =&gt; '@my,file' } )
        Returns : $self
        Args    : the same as for method 'run'

       Create  a  job,  start  it  and wait for its completion. The method is identical to the method "run". See
       details in the "run" method.

   <b>status</b>
        Usage   : $tool-&gt;status
        Returns : string describing a status of the execution
        Args    : none

       It returns one of the following strings (and perhaps more if a server  implementation  extended  possible
       job states):

          CREATED              (not run yet)
          COMPLETED            (run and finished normally)
          TERMINATED_BY_ERROR  (run and finished with an error or a signal)

   <b>result</b>
        Usage   : $job-&gt;result (...)
        Returns : a result created by running an analysis
        Args    : none (but an implementation may choose
                  to add arguments for instructions how to process
                  the raw result)

       The  method  returns  a  scalar representing a result of an executed job. If the job was terminated by an
       error the result may contain an error message instead of  the  real  data  (or  both,  depending  on  the
       implementation).
