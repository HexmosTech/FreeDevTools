</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Net::IMAP - A client interface to IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol).

       WARNING: This code is in alpha release.  Expect the interface to change release to release.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       "use Net::IMAP;"

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       "Net::IMAP" provides a perl interface to the client portion of IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol).

       <b>add</b> <b>more</b> <b>meat</b> <b>-</b> <b>describe</b> <b>overall</b> <b>design</b> <b>(commands,</b> <b>responses,</b> <b>callbacks,</b> <b>convenience</b> <b>routines</b>

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>new</b> <b>$host,</b> <b>%options</b>
       Creates a new "Net::IMAP" object, connects to $host on port 143, performs some preliminary setup of the
       session, and returns a reference to the object.

       Once connected, it processes the connection banner sent by the server.  If the considers the session to
       be preauthenticated, "new" notes the fact, allowing commands to be issued without logging in.

       The method also issues a "capability" command, and notes the result.  If the server does support
       IMAP4rev1, the method closes the connection and returns "undef".

       The client will use non-synchronizing literals if the server supports the "LITERAL+" extension (RFC2088)
       and the "NonSyncLits" options is set to 1.

       The following "Net::xAP" options are relevant to "Net::IMAP":

       "Synchronous =&gt; 1"
       "NonSyncLits =&gt; 0"
       "Debug =&gt; 0"
       "InternetDraft =&gt; 0"

       "Net::IMAP" also understands the following options, specific to the module:

       "EOL =&gt; 'lf'"
           Controls what style of end-of-line processing to presented to the end-programmer.  The default, 'lf',
           assumes  that  the  programemr wants to fling messages terminated with bare LFs when invoking append,
           and when fetching messages.  In this case, the module will map to/from CRLF accordingly.

           If "EOL" is set to 'crlf', the assumption is that the  programmer  wants  messages,  or  portions  of
           messages,  to  be  terminated  with  CRLF.   It  also  assumes  the  programmer is providing messages
           terminated with the string when invoking the "append" method, and will not provide an EOL mapping.

</pre><h4><b>IMAP</b> <b>COMMAND</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       There are numerous commands in the IMAP protocol.  Each of these are mapped to a corresponding method  in
       the "Net::IMAP" module.

       Some  commands  can  only  be  issued  in  certain protocol states.  Some commands alter the state of the
       session.  These facts are indicated in the documentation for the individual command methods.

       The following list enumerates the protocol states:

       Non-authenticated
           The client has not authenticated with the server.  Most commands are unavailable in this state.

       Authenticated
           The client has authenticated with the server.

       Selected
           The client has opened a mailbox on the server.

   <b>noop</b>
       Sends a "noop" command to the server.  It is valid in any protocol state.

       This method is useful for placating the auto-logout god, or for triggering pending unsolicited  responses
       from the server.

   <b>capability</b>
       The "capability" method retrieves the capabilities the IMAP server supports.  This method is valid in any
       protocol state.

       The server sends a "capability" response back to the client.

       If  the  response  does  not  indicate  support for the "LITERAL+" extension, the "NonSyncLits" option is
       forced off.

   <b>logout</b>
       Logs off of the server.  This method is valid in any protocol state.

   <b>login</b> <b>$user,</b> <b>$password</b>
       Logs into the server using a simple plaintext password.  This method is only valid when the  protocol  is
       in the non-authenticated state.

       If the server supports RFC2221 (IMAP4 Login Referrals), the completion response could include a referral.
       See RFC2221 for further information about login referrals.

       If successful, the session state is changed to <u>authenticated</u>.

   <b>authenticate</b> <b>$authtype,</b> <b>@authinfo</b>
       Logs  into  the  server  using  the authentication mechanism specified in $authtype.  This method is only
       valid when the protocol is in the non-authenticated state.

       The IMAP "authenticate" command is the same as that documented  in  RFC2222  (Simple  Authentication  and
       Security Layer (SASL)), despite the fact that IMAP predates SASL.

       If successful, the session state is changed to <u>authenticated</u>.

       The following authentication mechanisms are currently supported:

       'login'
           This  is  a  variation  on  the simple login technique, except that the information is transmitted in
           Base64.  This does not provide any additional security, but does allow clients to use "authenticate".

       'cram-md5'
           This implements the authentication mechanism defined in RFC2195  (IMAP/POP  AUTHorize  Extension  for
           Simple Challenge/Response).  It uses keyed MD5 to avoid sending the password over the wire.

       'anonymous'
           This  implements  the  authentication  mechanism  defined  in  RFC2245  (Anonymous  SASL  Mechanism).
           Anonymous IMAP access is intended to provide access to public mailboxes or newsgroups.

       The method returns "undef" is $authtype specifies an unsupported mechanism or  if  the  server  does  not
       advertise  support  for  the  mechanism.  The "has_authtype" method can be used to see whether the server
       supports a particular authentication mechanism.

       In general, if the server supports a mechanism  supported  by  "Net::IMAP",  the  "authenticate"  command
       should be used instead of the "login" method.

   <b>select</b> <b>$mailbox</b>
       Opens  the  specified mailbox with the intention of performing reading and writing.  This method is valid
       only when the session is in the authenticated or selected states.

       If successful, the server sends several responses: "flags", "exists", "resent", as well as "ok" responses
       containing a "unseen", "permanentflags", "uidnext", and "uidvalidity" codes.  If also changes the session
       state to <u>selected</u>.

       If server returns a "no" response containing a "newname" response code,  this  means  $mailbox  does  not
       exist but the server thinks this is because the folder was renamed.  In this case, try specifying the new
       folder name provided with the "newname" response code.

   <b>examine</b> <b>$mailbox</b>
       Opens  the  specified  mailbox  in  read-only mode.  This method is valid only when the session is in the
       authenticated or selected states.

   <b>create</b> <b>$mailbox</b> <b>[,</b> <b>$partition]</b>
       Creates the specified mailbox.  This method is valid only when the session is  in  the  authenticated  or
       selected states.

       The  optional  $partition  argument  is  only  valid  with  the  Cyrus IMAP daemon.  Refer to the section
       'Specifying Partitions with "create"' the "doc/overview" file for that package for  further  information.
       This  feature  can  only  be  used by administrators creating new mailboxes.  Other servers will probably
       reject the command if this argument is used.  The results are  undefined  if  another  server  accepts  a
       second argument.

   <b>delete</b> <b>$mailbox</b>
       Deletes  the  specified mailbox.  Returns "undef" if $mailbox is the currently open mailbox.  This method
       is valid only when the session is in the authenticated or selected states.

   <b>rename</b> <b>$oldmailboxname,</b> <b>$newmailboxname</b> <b>[,</b> <b>$partition]</b>
       Renames the mailbox specified in $oldmailbox to the name specified in $newmailbox.  This method is  valid
       only when the session is in the authenticated or selected states.

       The  optional  $partition  argument  is  only  valid  with  the  Cyrus IMAP daemon.  Refer to the section
       'Specifying Partitions with "rename"' the "doc/overview" file for that package for  further  information.
       This  feature can only be used by administrators.  Other servers will probably reject the command if this
       argument is used.  The results are undefined if another server accepts a third argument.

   <b>subscribe</b> <b>$mailbox</b>
       Subscribe to the specified $mailbox.  Subscribing in IMAP is subscribing in Usenet News, except that  the
       server  maintains  the  subscription  list.   This  method  is  valid  only  when  the  session is in the
       authenticated or selected states.

   <b>unsubscribe</b> <b>$mailbox</b>
       Unsubscribe from the specified $mailbox.   This  method  is  valid  only  when  the  session  is  in  the
       authenticated or selected states.

   <b>list</b> <b>$referencename,</b> <b>$mailbox_pattern</b>
       Send  an  IMAP  "list"  command  to  the  server.   This  method is valid only when the session is in the
       authenticated or selected states.

       Although IMAP folders do not need to be implemented as directories, think of an IMAP reference name as  a
       parameter given to a "cd" or "chdir" command, prior to checking for folders matching $mailbox_pattern.

       The  $mailbox_pattern  parameter  allows a couple wildcard characters to list subsets of the mailboxes on
       the server.

       "*" Matches zero or more characters at the specified location.

       "%" Like "*", matches zero or more characters at the specified location, but  does  not  match  hierarchy
           delimiter characters.

           If  the  last character in $mailbox_pattern is a "%", matching levels of hierarchy are also returned.
           In other words: subfolders.

       This method will fail, returning "undef", if $mailbox_pattern is "*".  This behavior is  not  built  into
       the  IMAP  protocol;  it is wired into "Net::IMAP".  Doing otherwise could be rude to both the client and
       server machines.  If you want to know why, imagine doing "list('#news.', '*')" on a machine with  a  full
       news feed.  The "%" character should be used to build up a folder tree incrementally.

       If successful, the server sends a series of "list" responses.

       Please  note  that  the $referencename is an IMAPism, not a Perl reference.  Also note that the wildcards
       usable in $mailbox_pattern are specific to IMAP.  Perl regexps are not usable here.

   <b>lsub</b> <b>$referencename,</b> <b>$mailbox_pattern</b>
       Sends an IMAP "lsub" command to the server.  The "lsub" command is similar to the "list" command,  except
       that  the server only returns subscribed mailboxes.  This method is valid only when the session is in the
       authenticated or selected states.

       The parameters are the same as those for the "list" method.

       If successful, the server sends a series of "lsub" responses.

   <b>status</b> <b>$mailbox,</b> <b>@statusattrs</b>
       Retrieves status information for the specified $mailbox.  This method is valid only when the  session  is
       in the authenticated or selected states.

       Per RFC2060, the @statusattrs can contain any of the following strings:

       •   messages

           The number of messages in the mailbox.

       •   recent

           The number of messages with the "\recent" flag set.

       •   uidnext

           The  UID  expected  to  be  assigned to the next mailbox appended to the mailbox.  This requires some
           explanation.  Rather than using this value for prefetching the next UID, it should be used to  detect
           whether  messages  have  been  added  to  the  mailbox.  The value will not change until messages are
           appended to the mailbox.

       •   uidvalidity

           The unique identifier validity value of the mailbox.

       •   unseen

           The number of messages without the "\seen" flag set.

       This method will fail, returning "undef" if $mailbox is the currently open mailbox.

       If successful, the server sends one or more "status" responses.

       The status operation can be rather expensive on some folder implementations, so clients should  use  this
       method sparingly.

   <b>append</b> <b>$mailbox,</b> <b>$message</b> <b>[,</b> <b>Flags</b> <b>=&gt;</b> <b>$flaglistref]</b> <b>[,</b> <b>Date</b> <b>=&gt;</b> <b>$date]</b>
       Appends  the  email  message  specified in $message to the mailbox specified in $mailbox.  This method is
       valid only when the session is in the authenticated or selected states.

       In general, the email message should be a real RFC822 message, although exceptions such as draft messages
       are reasonable in some situations.  Also note that the line terminators in $message need to be CRLF.

       The "Flags" option allows a set of flags to be specified for the message when it  is  appended.   Servers
       are not required to honor this, but most, if not all, do so.

       The  "Date"  option  forces the internaldate to the specified value.  If $date is a string, the format of
       the string is "dd-mmm-yyyy hh:mm:ss [-+]zzzz", where "dd" is the day of  the  month  (starting  from  1),
       "mmm"  is  the  three-character  abbreviation for the month name, "yyyy" is the 4-digit year, "hh" is the
       hour, "mm" is the minutes, "ss" is the seconds, and "[-+]zzzz" is  the  numeric  timezone  offset.   This
       happens  to be the same format returned by the "internaldate" item from the "fetch" command.  If $date is
       a list reference, it is expected to contain two elements: a time integer and a  timezone  offset  string.
       The  timezone  string  is  expected  to  be  formatted  as  "[-+]zzzz".  These two values will be used to
       synthesize a string in the format expected by the IMAP server.  As with the "Flags" options, servers  are
       not required to honor the "Date" option, but most, if not all, do so.

       Note  that the options are specified at the end of the list of method arguments.  This is due to the fact
       that it is possible to have a $mailbox named "Flags" or "Date".  Processing the options at the end of the
       argument list simplifies argument processing.  The order of the  arguments  will  be  changed  if  enough
       people complain.

       If  server  returns  a "no" response containing a "trycreate" response code, this means $mailbox does not
       exist but the server thinks the command would have succeeded if the an appropriate "create"  command  was
       issued.   On  the  other  hand, failure with no "trycreate" response code generally means that a "create"
       should not be attempted.

   <b>check</b>
       Ask the server to perform a checkpoint of its data.  This method is valid only when the session is in the
       selected state.

       While not always needed, this should be called if the client issues a large  quantity  of  updates  to  a
       folder in an extended session.

   <b>close</b>
       Close the current mailbox.  This method is valid only when the session is in the selected state.

       If successful, the session state is changed to <u>authenticated</u>.

   <b>expunge</b>
       Delete  messages  marked  for  deletion.   This  method is valid only when the session is in the selected
       state.

       If successful, the server sends a series of "expunge" responses.

       It will return "undef" is the mailbox is marked read-only.

   <b>search</b> <b>[Charset</b> <b>=&gt;</b> <b>$charset,]</b> <b>@searchkeys</b>
       Searches the mailbox for messages matching the criteria contained in @searchkeys.  This method  is  valid
       only when the session is in the selected state.

       The @searchkeys list contains strings matching the format described in Section 6.4.4 of RFC2060.

       If  successful,  the  server send zero or more "search" responses.  Lack of a "search" response means the
       server found no matches.  Note that the server can send the results of one search in multiple responses.

   <b>fetch</b> <b>$msgset,</b> <b>'all'|'full'|'fast'|$fetchattr|@fetchattrs</b>
       Retrieves data about a set of messages.  This method is valid only when the session is  in  the  selected
       state.

       The  $msgset  parameter identifies the set of messages from which to retrieve the items of interest.  The
       notation accepted is similar to that found in ".newsrc" files, except that ":" is used to specify ranges,
       instead of "-".  Thus, to specify messages 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9,  the  following  string  could  be  used:
       '1:3,5,7:9'.  The character "*" can be used to indicate the highest message number in the mailbox.  Thus,
       to specify the last 4 messages in an 8-message mailbox, you can use '5-*'.

       The  following  list  enumerates the items that can be retrieved with "fetch".  Refer to Section 6.4.5 of
       RFC2060 for a description of each of these items.

       •   body[$section]&lt;$partial&gt;

       •   body.peek[$section]&lt;$partial&gt;

           Important: the response item returned for a "body.peek" is "body".

       •   bodystructure

       •   body

       •   envelope

       •   flags

       •   internaldate

       •   rfc822

       •   rfc822.header

       •   rfc822.size

       •   rfc822.text

       •   uid

       Please note that the items returning messages, or portion of messages,  return  strings  terminated  with
       CRLF.

       RFC2060 also defines several items that are actually macros for other sets of items:

       •   all

           A macro equivalent to "('flags', 'internaldate', 'rfc822.size', 'envelope')".

       •   full

           A macro equivalent to "('flags', 'rfc822.size', 'envelope', 'body')".

       •   fast

           A macro equivalent to "('flags', 'internaldate', 'rfc822.size')".

       The "all", "full", and "fast" items are not intended to be used with other items.

       If successful, the server responses with one or more "fetch" responses.

       If  the  completion  response from a "fetch" command is "no", the client should send a "noop" command, to
       force any pending expunge responses from the server, and retry the "fetch" command with $msgset  adjusted
       accordingly.

   <b>store</b> <b>$msgset,</b> <b>$itemname,</b> <b>@storeattrflags</b>
       Sets  various  attributes  for  the  messages  identified in $msgset.  This method is valid only when the
       session is in the selected state.

       The $msgset parameter is described in the section describing "fetch".

       The $itemname can be one of the following:

       •   flags

           Replaces the current flags with the flags specified in @storeattrflags.

       •   +flags

           Adds the flags specified in @storeattrflags to the current flags.

       •   -flags

           Removes the flags specified in @storeattrflags from the current flags.

       The $itemname can also have ".silent" appended, which causes the server to not send back update responses
       for the messages.

       If successful, and ".silent" is used used in $itemname, the server response  with  a  series  of  "fetch"
       responses reflecting the updates to the specified messages.

       If  the  completion  response from a "store" command is "no", the client should send a "noop" command, to
       force any pending expunge responses from the server, and retry the "store" command with $msgset  adjusted
       accordingly.

       The @storeattrflags is a list of flag strings.

   <b>copy</b> <b>$msgset,</b> <b>$mailbox</b>
       Copy the messages $msgset to the specified mailbox.  This method is valid only when the session is in the
       selected state.

       The $msgset parameter is described in the section describing "fetch".

       If  server  returns  a "no" response containing a "trycreate" response code, this means $mailbox does not
       exist but the server thinks the command would have succeeded if the an appropriate "create"  command  was
       issued.   On  the  other  hand, failure with no "trycreate" response code generally means that a "create"
       should not be attempted.

   <b>uid_copy</b> <b>$msgset,</b> <b>$mailbox</b>
       A variant of "copy" that uses UIDs in $msgset, instead of message numbers.  This  method  is  valid  only
       when the session is in the selected state.

   <b>uid_fetch</b> <b>$msgset,</b> <b>'all'|'full'|'fast'|$fetchattr|@fetchattrs</b>
       A  variant of "fetch" that uses UIDs, instead of message numbers, in $msgset and "fetch" responses.  This
       method is valid only when the session is in the selected state.

   <b>uid_search</b> <b>[Charset</b> <b>=&gt;</b> <b>$charset,]</b> <b>@searchkeys</b>
       A variant of "search" that uses UIDs, instead of message numbers,  in  $msgset  and  "search"  responses.
       This method is valid only when the session is in the selected state.

   <b>uid_store</b> <b>$msgset,</b> <b>$itemname,</b> <b>@storeattrflags</b>
       A  variant of "store" that uses UIDs, instead of message numbers, in $msgset and "fetch" responses.  This
       method is valid only when the session is in the selected state.

</pre><h4><b>CONVENIENCE</b> <b>ROUTINES</b></h4><pre>
       In addition to the core protocol methods, "Net::IMAP" provides  several  methods  for  accessing  various
       pieces of information.

   <b>is_preauth</b>
       Returns a boolean valud indicating whether the IMAP session is preauthenticated.

   <b>banner</b>
       Returns the banner string issued by the server at connect time.

   <b>capabilities</b>
       Returns  the  list  of  capabilities supported by the server, minus the authentication capabilities.  The
       list is not guaranteed to be in any specific order.

   <b>has_capability</b> <b>$capname</b>
       Returns a boolean value indicating whether the server supports the specified capability.

   <b>authtypes</b>
       Returns a list of authentication types supported by the server.

   <b>has_authtype</b> <b>$authname</b>
       Returns a boolean value indicating whether the server supports the specified authentication type.

   <b>qty_messages</b>
       Returns the quantity of messages in the currently selected folder.

   <b>qty_recent</b>
       Returns the quantity of recent messages in the currently selected folder.

   <b>first_unseen</b>
       Returns the message number of the first unseen messages in the currently selected folder.

   <b>uidvalidity</b>
       Returns the "uidvalidity" value for the currently selected folder.  This is useful for IMAP clients  that
       cache  data  in  persistent  storage.   Cache  data  for a mailbox should only be considered valid if the
       "uidvalidity" is the same for both cached data and the remote mailbox.  See Section  2.3.1.1  of  RFC2060
       for further details.

   <b>uidnext</b>
       Returns the "uidnext" value for the currently selected folder.

   <b>permanentflags</b>
       Returns the list of permanent flags the server has identified for the currently open mailbox.

       If a "\*" flag is present, the server allows new persistent keywords to be created.

   <b>is_permanentflag</b> <b>$flag</b>
       Returns a boolean value indicating whether the server considers $flag to be a permanent flag.

   <b>flags</b>
       Returns a list of the flags associated with the mailbox.

   <b>has_flag</b> <b>$flag</b>
       Returns a boolean value indicating whether the given $flag is defined for the mailbox.

   <b>mailbox</b>
       Returns the name of the currently open mailbox.  Returns "undef" if no mailbox is currently open.

       Valid values for @setquotalist are server-dependant.

   <b>getquotaroot</b> <b>$mailbox</b>
       Lists the quota roots for $mailbox.

</pre><h4><b>UIDPLUS</b> <b>EXTENSION</b></h4><pre>
       The following method is available if the server advertises support for RFC2359 (IMAP4 UIDPLUS Extension).
       Refer to that RFC for additional information.

   <b>uid_expunge</b> <b>$msgset</b>
       A variant of "expunge" that allows the operation to be narrowed to the messages with  UIDs  specified  in
       $msgset.

       The $msgset parameter is described in the section describing "fetch".

</pre><h4><b>CALLBACKS</b></h4><pre>
       Many  of the command methods result in the server sending back response data.  "Net::IMAP" processes each
       response by parsing the data, packages it in an appropriate object, and optionally  calls  a  programmer-
       defined  callback  for  the  response.  This callback mechanism is how programmers get access to the data
       retrieved from the server.

   <b>set_untagged_callback</b> <b>$item,</b> <b>$coderef</b>
       Assigns a programmer-defined code reference to  the  associated  untagged  response.   When  an  untagged
       response matching $item is received, $coderef is called, with the IMAP object and the associated response
       object passed as parameters.

       The  default callback for the "ok", "bye", "bad", and "no" untagged responses includes code to output the
       text from "alert" responses to stderr, using "carp".  If you set your own callback for  these  responses,
       be  sure  to  code  handle  "alert"  codes.   Per Section 7.1 of RFC2060, clients are required to clearly
       display "alert" messages to users.

</pre><h4><b>RESPONSE</b> <b>OBJECTS</b></h4><pre>
       As mention in the previous section, responses are parsed and packaged into response  objects,  which  are
       then  passed  to  callbacks.   Each  type  of  response  has  a corresponding object class.  This section
       describes the various response objects provided.

       All of the class names itemized below are prefixed with "Net::IMAP".

       As a general rule, IMAP "nil" items are set to "undef" in the parsed data, and IMAP  parenthetical  lists
       are  converted  to  list  references  (of  one form or another).  In addition, atoms, quoted strings, and
       literals are presented as Perl strings.

       The condition responses ("ok", "no", "bad", "bye", and "preauth") can include a response code.  Refer  to
       Section 7.1 in RFC2060 for a description of each of the standard response codes.

</pre><h4><b>Response</b></h4><pre>
       This is the object class for completion responses.

   <b>is_tagged</b>
       Returns  a  boolean  value  indicating  whether the response is tagged.  In the case of tagged completion
       responses, this value is always 1.

   <b>has_trycreate</b>
       Returns a boolean value indicating whether the "TRYCREATE" response code  is  present  in  the  response.
       This  can  be  used  after a failed "append" or "copy" command to determine whether the server thinks the
       operation would succeed if a "create" was issued for the associated mailbox.

</pre><h4><b>UntaggedResponse</b></h4><pre>
       This class is common to all untagged server responses.

   <b>tag</b>
       Returns a string containing the tag associated with the response.  In the  case  of  untagged  responses,
       this is always "*".

   <b>is_tagged</b>
       Returns  a  boolean  value indicating whether the response is tagged.  Obviously, in the case of untagged
       responses, this value is always 0.

   <b>parent</b>
       Returns a reference to the parent IMAP object.

</pre><h4><b>Ok</b></h4><pre>
       This is a container for untagged "ok" responses from the server.

   <b>code</b>
       Returns a list reference containing response code elements  in  the  response.   Returns  "undef"  if  no
       response code is present.

   <b>name</b>
       Returns  the name of the response.  In the case of "Ok", this returns 'ok'.  This method is provided as a
       convenience for end-programmers wanting to write one common subroutine for one or more of  the  responses
       "Ok", "No", "Bad", and "Bye".

</pre><h4><b>No</b></h4><pre>
       This is a container for untagged "no" responses from the server.

</pre><h4><b>Bad</b></h4><pre>
       This is a container for untagged "bad" responses from the server.

</pre><h4><b>Bye</b></h4><pre>

       received.

   <b>msgnum</b>
       Returns the message number specified in the "expunge" response.

</pre><h4><b>Capability</b></h4><pre>
       This is a container for "capability" responses.

   <b>capabilities</b>
       Returns the list of capabilities supported by the server, minus  the  authentication  capabilities.   The
       list is not guaranteed to be in any specific order.

   <b>has_capability</b> <b>$capname</b>
       Returns a boolean value indicating whether the server supports the specified capability.

   <b>authtypes</b>
       Returns a list of authentication types supported by the server.

   <b>has_authtype</b> <b>$authname</b>
       Returns a boolean value indicating whether the server supports the specified authentication type.

       Returns a list of the flags associated with the mailbox.

   <b>has_flag</b> <b>$flag</b>
       Returns a boolean value indicating whether the given $flag is defined for the mailbox.

</pre><h4><b>List</b></h4><pre>
       This is a container for "lsub" responses.  It provides the same interface as the "Net::IMAP::List" class.

</pre><h4><b>Fetch</b></h4><pre>
       This is a container for "fetch" responses.

       Responses  for  partial fetches bear special mention.  While both the starting byte and quantity of bytes
       are specified when doing partial fetches with the "fetch" command, the corresponding response  will  only
       show  the  starting  byte.   In  other  words,  the  command  "$imap-&gt;fetch(1, 'body[]&lt;0.1024&gt;'" will, if
       successful, result in a fetch response item of "body[]&lt;0&gt;" containing a 1024 octet  value.   To  match  a
       given  response for a partial fetch, you might need to use "length" to match it up with the corresponding
       item specified in the "fetch" command.

   <b>msgnum</b>
       Returns the message number identified in the response.

   <b>items</b>
       Returns the list of data item names contained in the response.  The list is not guaranteed to be  in  any
       specific order.

       type.  For example, the type of "text/plain" is "text".

   <b>subtype</b>
       Returns  a  string  containing the MIME subtype of the message.  This is the right-hand portion of a MIME
       media type.  For example, the subtype of "text/plain" is "plain".

   <b>parameters</b>
       Returns a reference to a hash containing the key/value attribute pairs in the "Content-Type" field.

       If, for example, the "Content-Type" field was:

         Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

       The hash would contain one entry the a key of "charset", and a value of "us-ascii".  The  key  is  always
