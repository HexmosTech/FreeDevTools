</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       IO::All::LWP - IO::All interface to LWP

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use IO::All;

           "hello world\n" &gt; io('<a href="ftp://localhost/test/x">ftp://localhost/test/x</a>');   # save to FTP
           $content &lt; io('<a href="http://example.org">http://example.org</a>');              # GET webpage

           io('<a href="http://example.org">http://example.org</a>') &gt; io('index.html');      # save webpage

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module acts as glue between IO::All and LWP, so that files can be read and written through the
       network using the convenient &lt;IO:All&gt; interface.  Note that this module is not "use"d directly: you just
       use IO::All, which knows when to autoload IO::All::HTTP, IO::All::HTTPS, IO::All::FTP, or
       IO::All::Gopher, which implement the specific protocols based on IO::All::LWP.

</pre><h4><b>EXECUTION</b> <b>MODEL</b></h4><pre>
       <b>GET</b> <b>requests</b>. When the IO::All object is opened, the URI is fetched and stored by the object in an
       internal file handle. It can then be accessed like any other file via the IO::All methods and operators,
       it can be tied, etc.

       <b>PUT</b> <b>requests</b>. When the IO::All object is opened, an internal file handle is created. It is possible to
       that file handle using the various IO::All methods and operators, it can be tied, etc. If $io-&gt;put is not
       called explicitly, when the IO::All object is closed, either explicitly via $io-&gt;close or automatically
       upon destruction, the actual PUT request is made.

       The bad news is that the whole file is stored in memory after getting it or before putting it. This may
       cause problems if you are dealing with multi-gigabyte files!

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       The simplest way of doing things is via the overloaded operators &gt; and &lt;, as shown in the SYNOPSIS. These
       take care of automatically opening and closing the files and connections as needed. However, various
       methods are available to provide a finer degree of control.

       This is a subclass of IO::All. In addition to the inherited methods, the following methods are available:

       •   ua

           Set  or  get the user agent object (LWP::UserAgent or a subclass). If called with a list, the list is
           passed to LWP::UserAgent-&gt;new. If called with an object, the object is  used  directly  as  the  user
           agent. Note that there is a default user agent if no user agent is specified.

       •   uri

           Set  or  get the URI. It can take either a URI object or a string, and it returns an URI object. Note
           that calling  this  method  overrides  the  user  and  password  fields,  because  URIs  can  contain
           authentication information.

       •   user

           Set  or  get the user name for authentication. Note that the user name (and the password) can also be
           set as part of the URL, as in "<a href="http://me">http://me</a>:<a href="mailto:secret@example.com">secret@example.com</a>/".

       •   password

           Set or get the password for authentication. Note that the password can also be set  as  part  of  the
           URL, as discussed above.

       •   get

           GET  the  current  URI  using LWP. Or, if called with an HTTP::Request object as a parameter, it does
           that request instead. It returns the HTTP::Response object.

       •   put

           PUT to the current URI using LWP. If called with  an  HTTP::Request  object,  it  does  that  request
           instead.  If  called  with  a  scalar, it PUTs that as the content to the current URI, instead of the
           current accumulated content.

       •   response

           Return the HTTP::Response object.

       •   request

           Does an LWP request. It requires an HTTP::Request object as a parameter.  Returns  an  HTTP::Response
           object.

       •   open

           Overrides  the "open" method from IO::All. It takes care of GETting the content, or of setting up the
           internal buffer for PUTting. Just like the "open" method from IO::All, it can take a  mode:  '&lt;'  for
           GET and '&gt;' for PUT.

       •   close

           Overrides the "close" method from IO::All. It takes care of PUTting the content.

</pre><h4><b>DEPENDENCIES</b></h4><pre>
