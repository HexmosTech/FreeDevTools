</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Imager::interface.pod - describes the C level virtual image interface

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The Imager virtual interface aims to allow image types to be created for special purposes, both to allow
       consistent access to images with different sample sizes, and organizations, but also to allow creation of
       synthesized or virtual images.

       This is a C level interface rather than Perl.

   <b>Existing</b> <b>Images</b>
       As of this writing we have the following concrete image types:

       •   8-bit/sample direct images

       •   16-bit/sample direct images

       •   double/sample direct images

       •   8-bit/sample 8-bit/index paletted images

       Currently there is only one virtual image type:

       •   masked images, where a mask image can control write access to an underlying image.

       Other possible concrete images include:

       •   "bitmaps", 1 bit/sample images (perhaps limited to a single channel)

       •   16-bit/index paletted images

       Some other possible virtual images:

       •   image  alpha  combining,  where  the  combining  function  can  be  specified (see the layer modes in
           graphical editors like the GIMP or Photoshop.

</pre><h4><b>THE</b> <b>INTERFACE</b></h4><pre>
       Each image type needs to define a number of functions which implement the image operations.

       The image structure includes information describes  the  image,  which  can  be  used  to  determine  the
       structure of the image:

       •   "channels" - the number of samples kept for each pixel in the image.  For paletted images the samples
           are kept for each entry in the palette.

       •   "xsize", "ysize" - the dimensions of the image in pixels.

       •   "bytes" - the number of bytes of data kept for the image.  Zero for virtual images.  Does not include
           the space required for the palette for paletted images.

       •   "ch_mask" - controls which samples will be written to for direct images.

       •   "bits"  -  the  number  of  bits kept for each sample.  There are enum values i_8_bits, i_16_bits and
           i_double_bits (64).

       •   "type" - the type of image, either i_direct_type or i_palette_type.  Direct images keep  the  samples
           for every pixel image, while i_palette_type images keep an index into a color table for each pixel.

       •   "virtual" - whether the image keeps any pixel data.  If this is non-zero then "idata" points to image
           data, otherwise it points to implementation defined data, though "ext_data" is more likely to be used
           for that.

       •   "idata"  -  image data.  If the image is 8-bit direct, non-virtual, then this consists of each sample
           of the image stored one after another, otherwise it is implementation defined.

       •   "tags" - will be used to store meta-data for an image, eg.  tags  from  a  TIFF  file,  or  animation
           information  from  a  GIF file.  This should be initialized with a call to <b>i_tags_new()</b> in your image
           constructor if creating a new image type.

       •   "ext_data" - for internal use of image types.  This is not released by the standard  <b>i_img_exorcise()</b>
           function.   If  you  create a new image type and want to store a pointer to allocated memory here you
           should point i_f_destroy at a function that will release the data.

       If a caller has no knowledge of the internal format of an image, the caller  must  call  the  appropriate
       image  function pointer.  Imager provides macros that wrap these functions, so it isn't necessary to call
       them directly.

       Many functions have a similar function with an 'f' suffix, these take or return  samples  specified  with
       floating point values rather than 8-bit integers (unsigned char).  Floating point samples are returned in
       the range 0 to 1 inclusive.

       i_f_ppix(im,x,y,color)
       i_f_ppixf(im,x,y,fcolor)
           stores  the  specified  color  at  pixel  (x,y)  in  the image.  If the pixel can be stored return 0,
           otherwise -1.  An image type may choose to return 0 under some circumstances, eg. writing to a masked
           area of an image.  The "color" or "fcolor" always contains the actual samples to be  written,  rather
           than a palette index.

       i_f_plin(im,l,r,y,colors)
       i_f_plinf(im,l,r,y,fcolors)
           stores  (r-l)  pixels  at  positions  (l,y)  ...  (r-1,  y)  from the array specified by "colors" (or
           "fcolors").  Returns the number of pixels written to.  If l is negative it will return 0.   If  "r  &gt;
           im-&gt;xsize" then only "(im-&gt;xsize - l)" will be written.

       i_f_gpix(im,x,y,color)
       i_f_gpixf(im,x,y,fcolor)
           retrieves  a  single  pixel  from position (x,y).  This returns the samples rather than the index for
           paletted images.

       i_f_glin(im,l,r,y,colors)
       i_f_glinf(im,l,r,y,fcolors)
           retrieves (r-l) pixels from positions (l, y) through (r-1, y) into the  array  specified  by  colors.
           Returns  the  number of pixels retrieved.  If l &lt; 0 no pixels are retrieved.  If "r &gt; im-&gt;xsize" then
           pixels "(l, y)" ... "(im-&gt;xsize-1, y)" are retrieved.  Retrieves the samples rather  than  the  color
           indexes for paletted images.

       i_f_gsamp(im,l,r,y,samples,chans,chan_count)
       i_f_gsampf(im,l,r,y,fsamples,chans,chan_count)
           Retrieves  samples  from  channels  specified  by  "chans"  (for  length "chan_count") from pixels at
           positions (l,y) ... (r-1, y).  If "chans" is NULL then samples from  channels  0  ...  "chan_count-1"
           will  be  retrieved.   Returns  the  number  of  sample retrieved (<u>not</u> the number of channels).  If a
           channel in "chans" is not present in the image or l &lt; 0, returns 0.  If "r  &gt;  im-&gt;xsize",  then  the
           samples from "(l,y)" ... "(im-&gt;xsize-1, y)" are returned.

       The following are for images where type == i_palette_type only.

       i_f_gpal(im,l,r,y,vals)
           Retrieves  color  indexes  from  the  image  for pixels (l, y) ... (r-1, y) into "vals".  Returns the
           number of indexes retrieved.

       i_f_ppal(im,l,r,y,vals)
           Stores color indexes into the image for pixels (l, y) ... (r-1, y) from "vals".  Returns  the  number
           of  indexes  retrieved.   If  indexes  are outside the range of the images palette, then you may have
           problems reading those pixels with <b>i_gpix()</b> or <b>i_glin()</b>.

       i_f_addcolors(im,colors,count)
           Adds the count colors to the image's palette.  Returns the index of the first color added, or  -1  if
           there is not enough space for count colors.

       i_f_getcolors(im,index,colors,count)
           Retrieves  count  colors  from the image's palette starting from entry index in the palette.  Returns
           non-zero on success.

       i_f_colorcount(im)
           Returns the number of colors in the image's palette.  Returns -1 if this is not a paletted image.

       i_f_maxcolors(im)
           Returns the maximum number of colors that can fit in the image's palette.  Returns -1 if this is  not
           a paletted image.

       i_f_findcolor(im,color,entry)
           Searches  the image's palette for the specified color, setting *entry to the index and returning non-
           zero.  Returns zero if the color is not found.

       i_f_setcolors_t(im,index,colors,count)
           Sets count colors starting from index in the image from the array colors.  The colors to be set  must
           already have entries in the image's palette.  Returns non-zero on success.

       Finally,  the  i_f_destroy function pointer can be set which is called when the image is destroyed.  This
       can be used to release memory pointed to by ext_data or release any other resources.

       When writing to a paletted image with <b>i_ppix()</b> or <b>i_plin()</b> and the color you are writing doesn't exist in
       the image, then it's possible that the image will be internally converted to a direct image with the same
       number of channels.

</pre><h4><b>TOOLS</b></h4><pre>
       Several functions have been written to simplify creating new image types.

       These tools are available by including <u>imagei.h</u>.

   <b>Floating</b> <b>point</b> <b>wrappers</b>
       These functions implement the floating point sample versions of each interface function in terms  of  the
       integer sample version.

       These are:

       i_ppixf_fp
       i_gpixf_fp
       i_plinf_fp
       i_glinf_fp
       i_gsampf_fp

   <b>Forwarding</b> <b>functions</b>
       These  functions  are  used in virtual images where the call should simply be forwarded to the underlying
       image.  The underlying image is assumed to be the first pointer in a structure pointed at by ext_data.

       If this is not the case then these functions will just crash :)

       i_addcolors_forward
       i_getcolors_forward
       i_colorcount_forward
       i_maxcolors_forward
       i_findcolor_forward
       i_setcolors_forward

   <b>Sample</b> <b>macros</b>
       "imagei.h" defines several macros for converting samples between different sizes.

       Each macro is of the form "Sample"<u>size</u>"To"<u>size</u> where <u>size</u> is one of  8,  16,  or  F  (for  floating-point
       samples).

       SampleFTo16(sample)
       Sample16ToF(sample)
       SampleFTo8(sample)
       Sample8ToF(sample)
       Sample16To8(num)
       Sample8To16(num)
