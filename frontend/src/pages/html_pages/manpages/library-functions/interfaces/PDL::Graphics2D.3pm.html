</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       PDL::Graphics2D - An object oriented interface to PDL graphics

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        use PDL::Graphics2D;
        $win = PDL::Graphics2D-&gt;new(&lt;Interface&gt;, &lt;Options&gt;);

        $w = imag2d( $image, 'Title Here', ... );

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This is an umbrella class allowing for a simple interface to all plotting routines in PDL. On its own it
       does not do any work it merely passes information to the appropriate class. Ideally this should probably
       offer a uniform interface to a variety of packages.

       This requires a lot more work before it is useful I feel, but it can be used already.

</pre><h4><b>CONSTRUCTORS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>new</b>
       Create a 2-D graphics object with the requested interface type

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>imag2d</b>
       Display a 2-D image in a figure window

       <b>imag2d()</b> creates a plain FreeGLUT OpenGL window and displays the input image with 1:1 aspect ratio for
       pixels.  The window resize is constrained to the actual ratio of the image dimensions.  The initial
       display size is currently a 200x200 window to prevent things from being too small by default.

       The image to display can have dimensions ($c,$M,$N) where for $c==4 the display is in GL_RGBA, for $c==3
       the display is GL_RGB, for $c==2 the display is GL_LUMINANCE_ALPHA, and for $c==1 or for for dimensions
       ($M,$N) then the display is GL_LUMINANCE.

       This routine does not yet thread but multiple images may be viewed at the same time in separate windows
       by multiple calls to <b>imag2d()</b>.  TriD graphics visualization windows and the <b>imag2d()</b> windows may be
       created and used independently.

       NOTE: If you are twiddling a TriD window, the <b>imag2d()</b> windows are active as well.  If you call <b>twiddle()</b>
       the sub, only the <b>imag2d()</b> windows will update correctly.

         $window_id = imag2d($image, $name, $zoom, $x_off, $y_off);

           creates a new image figure window from the input ndarray
           with the given title, zoom factor, and position (if possible)

           $window_id - may be used to refer to the figure window

           $image - 2D image ndarray with at least 2 or 3 dimensions
                    e.g. [M,N], [1,M,N], [2,M,N], [3,M,N], [4,M,N]

           $name - the name to use for the figure window (optional)

           $zoom - desired (float) pixel zoom factor     (optional)

           ($x_off, $y_off) - desired window pixel position (optional)
                              with (0,0) as the top left pixel of the
                              display

         use PDL::Graphics2D;     # imports imag2d() and twiddle()

         $x = sequence(64,48,3);  # make test RGB image
         $x = $x-&gt;mv(2,0);        # color must be <a href="../man0/dim.0.html">dim</a>(0) with size [0..4]
         $x /= $x-&gt;max;           # pixel values in [0.0,1.0]
         $x = sin(10*$x);
         $w1 = imag2d($x);        # with parens...
         $w2 = imag2d $x-&gt;sqrt;   # or without
         $w3 = imag2d $x**2;

   <b>imag2d_update</b>
       Update an existing imag2d window with new ndarray data

         $image = random(3,64,48)/2 + 0.25;  # random pixel image
         $win = imag2d($image);              # create original image display

         imag2d_update($win, $image-&gt;sequence/$image-&gt;nelem);  # update data

       "imag2d_update" allows one to update an "imag2d" display window by replacing the associated image data
       with new contents.  The new image data must be the same type and shape as the previous.

       Eventually, we would like to implement this via some sort of dataflow that would be transparent to the
       user.

   <b>twiddle</b>
       Enable GUI interaction with a FreeGLUT display window.  With an argument, it sets the default value for
       the auto-twiddling state.  0  will disable the automatic twiddling and  1 , or true, will enable
       twiddling.

         twiddle();     # same as twiddle(undef)

           Runs the FreeGLUT event loop so window GUI operations
           such as resize, expose, mouse click,.. work

         <a href="../man0/twiddle.0.html">twiddle</a>(0);  # disables twiddle looping for next twiddle() call
         <a href="../man1/twiddle.1.html">twiddle</a>(1);  # re-enables default twiddle looping for next twiddle() call
