</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       POINTS - draws a marker at each of a series of specified positions in the user coordinate system.  The
       markers can also be connected by drawing lines between them.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       CALL POINTS (PX,PY,NP,IC,IL)

</pre><h4><b>C-BINDING</b> <b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;ncarg/ncargC.h&gt;

       void c_points (float *px, float *py, int np, int ic, int il)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       PX          (an input array of type REAL) defines the X user coordinates where a series of NP markers are
                   to be drawn.

       PY          (an input array of type REAL) defines the Y user coordinates where a series of NP markers are
                   to be drawn.

       NP          (an input expression of type INTEGER) specifies the number of markers to be drawn.

       IC          (an input expression of type INTEGER) describes the type of marker to be drawn, as follows:

                   IC &lt; 0 - draw a GKS polymarker of type -IC, as follows:

                     -1  requests a dot (.),

                     -2  requests a plus (+),

                     -3  requests an asterisk (*),

                     -4  requests a circle (o), and

                     -5  requests a cross (x).

                   The polymarker size and color can be set by calling the GKS routines GSMKSC, GSCR, and GSPMCI
                   before calling POINTS.

                   IC = 0 - draw a dot (.).  Effect is the same as IC = -1.

                   IC &gt; 0 - draw the FORTRAN77 character CHAR(IC).

                   In this case, the GKS routine GTX is used to draw the specified character CHAR(IC) at each of
                   the  NP  points.   Each  character  is  drawn with the horizontal and vertical text alignment
                   centered at the specified point with a call to the GKS routine GSTXAL.   The  horizontal  and
                   vertical  text  alignment  parameters are then restored to their previous values.  Other text
                   attributes such as character orientation, character height, and color, can be set by  calling
                   GKS text attribute setting routines before the call to the routine POINTS.

       IL          (a  input expression of type INTEGER) determines if the markers are to be connected with line
                   segments.

                   IL = 0 - do not connect the markers with line segments.

                   IL .NE. 0 - connect the markers with line segments.

</pre><h4><b>C-BINDING</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The C-binding argument descriptions are the same as the FORTRAN argument descriptions.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       If the routine SET has not been called, or if the last call to SET specified linear mappings in X and  Y,
       and  the  value  of  IC  specifies  a  GKS  polymarker,  then  the  GKS routine GPM is called to draw the
       polymarkers.  If, in addition, IL is non-zero, the GKS routine GPL is called to draw the  line  segments.
       In  all  other  cases,  NCAR  Graphics  routines  are  used to draw the more complicated set of graphical
       objects.

       Since a call to POINTS can result in subsequent calls to the GKS routines GPM or GPL, various  polymarker
       and  polyline  attributes  may need to be set before the routine POINTS is called.  Polymarker attributes
       which can be set are listed above in the DESCRIPTION Section.   Polyline  attributes  which  can  be  set
       include polyline type (call GSLN), polyline line width (call GSLWSC), and color (call GSCR and GSPLCI).

       A  call  to  the routine POINTS causes the SPPS polyline buffer to be flushed.  Refer to the man page for
       the routine PLOTIF.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Use the ncargex command to see the following relevant examples: agex11, cmptra.

</pre><h4><b>ACCESS</b></h4><pre>
       To use POINTS or c_points, load the NCAR Graphics libraries ncarg, ncarg_gks, and ncarg_c, preferably  in
       that order.
