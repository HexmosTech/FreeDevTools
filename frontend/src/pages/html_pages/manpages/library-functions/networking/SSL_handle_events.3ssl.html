</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       SSL_handle_events - advance asynchronous state machine and perform network I/O

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        #include &lt;openssl/ssl.h&gt;

        int SSL_handle_events(SSL *ssl);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>SSL_handle_events()</b> performs any internal processing which is due on an SSL object. The exact operations
       performed by <b>SSL_handle_events()</b> vary depending on what kind of protocol is being used with the given SSL
       object. For example, <b>SSL_handle_events()</b> may handle timeout events which have become due, or may attempt,
       to the extent currently possible, to perform network I/O operations on one of the BIOs underlying the SSL
       object.

       The primary use case for <b>SSL_handle_events()</b> is to allow an application which uses OpenSSL in nonblocking
       mode to give OpenSSL an opportunity to handle timer events, or to respond to the availability of new data
       to be read from an underlying BIO, or to respond to the opportunity to write pending data to an
       underlying BIO.

       <b>SSL_handle_events()</b> can be used only with the following types of SSL object:

       DTLS SSL objects
           Using  <b>SSL_handle_events()</b> on an SSL object being used with a DTLS method allows timeout events to be
           handled properly. This is equivalent to a call to <b><a href="../man3/DTLSv1_handle_timeout.3.html">DTLSv1_handle_timeout</a></b>(3). Since <b>SSL_handle_events()</b>
           handles a superset of the use cases of <b><a href="../man3/DTLSv1_handle_timeout.3.html">DTLSv1_handle_timeout</a></b>(3),  it  should  be  preferred  for  new
           applications which do not require support for OpenSSL 3.1 or older.

           When   using   DTLS,   an  application  must  call  <b>SSL_handle_events()</b>  as  indicated  by  calls  to
           <b><a href="../man3/SSL_get_event_timeout.3.html">SSL_get_event_timeout</a></b>(3); event handling is  not  performed  automatically  by  calls  to  other  SSL
           functions  such  as  <b><a href="../man3/SSL_read.3.html">SSL_read</a></b>(3)  or  <b><a href="../man3/SSL_write.3.html">SSL_write</a></b>(3).  Note  that  this is different to QUIC which also
           performs event handling implicitly; see below.

       QUIC connection SSL objects
           Using <b>SSL_handle_events()</b> on an SSL object which represents a QUIC connection allows  timeout  events
           to be handled properly, as well as incoming network data to be processed, and queued outgoing network
           data to be written, if the underlying BIO has the capacity to accept it.

           Ordinarily,  when  an  application  uses  an  SSL  object  in blocking mode, it does not need to call
           <b>SSL_handle_events()</b> because OpenSSL performs ticking internally on an automatic basis. However, if an
           application uses  a  QUIC  connection  in  nonblocking  mode,  it  must  at  a  minimum  ensure  that
           <b>SSL_handle_events()</b>  is called periodically to allow timeout events to be handled. An application can
           find out when it next needs to call <b>SSL_handle_events()</b> for this  purpose  (if  at  all)  by  calling
           <b><a href="../man3/SSL_get_event_timeout.3.html">SSL_get_event_timeout</a></b>(3).

           Calling  <b>SSL_handle_events()</b>  on  a  QUIC  connection  SSL  object being used in blocking mode is not
           necessary unless no I/O calls (such as <b><a href="../man3/SSL_read.3.html">SSL_read</a></b>(3) or <b><a href="../man3/SSL_write.3.html">SSL_write</a></b>(3)) will be made to the object for  a
           substantial  period of time. So long as at least one call to the SSL object is blocking, no such call
           is needed. However, <b>SSL_handle_events()</b> may optionally  be  used  on  a  QUIC  connection  object  if
           desired.

           With  the  thread-assisted  mode  of operation <b><a href="../man3/OSSL_QUIC_client_thread_method.3.html">OSSL_QUIC_client_thread_method</a></b>(3) it is unnecessary to
           call <b>SSL_handle_events()</b> as the assist thread handles the QUIC connection events.

       Calling <b>SSL_handle_events()</b> on any other kind of SSL object is a no-op.  This  is  considered  a  success
       case.

       Note that <b>SSL_handle_events()</b> supersedes the older <b><a href="../man3/DTLSv1_handle_timeout.3.html">DTLSv1_handle_timeout</a></b>(3) function for all use cases.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUES</b></h4><pre>
       Returns 1 on success and 0 on failure.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>SSL_handle_events()</b> function was added in OpenSSL 3.2.
