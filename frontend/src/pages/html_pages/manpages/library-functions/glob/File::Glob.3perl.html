</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       File::Glob - Perl extension for BSD glob routine

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use File::Glob ':bsd_glob';

         @list = bsd_glob('*.[ch]');
         $homedir = bsd_glob('~gnat', GLOB_TILDE | GLOB_ERR);

         if (GLOB_ERROR) {
           # an error occurred reading $homedir
         }

         ## override the core glob (CORE::glob() does this automatically
         ## by default anyway, since v5.6.0)
         use File::Glob ':globally';
         my @sources = &lt;*.{c,h,y}&gt;;

         ## override the core glob, forcing case sensitivity
         use File::Glob qw(:globally :case);
         my @sources = &lt;*.{c,h,y}&gt;;

         ## override the core glob forcing case insensitivity
         use File::Glob qw(:globally :nocase);
         my @sources = &lt;*.{c,h,y}&gt;;

         ## glob on all files in home directory
         use File::Glob ':globally';
         my @sources = &lt;~gnat/*&gt;;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The glob angle-bracket operator "&lt;&gt;" is a pathname generator that implements the rules for file name
       pattern matching used by Unix-like shells such as the Bourne shell or C shell.

       <b>File::Glob::bsd_glob()</b> implements the FreeBSD <b><a href="../man3/glob.3.html">glob</a></b>(3) routine, which is a superset of the POSIX <b>glob()</b>
       (described in IEEE Std 1003.2 "POSIX.2").  <b>bsd_glob()</b> takes a mandatory "pattern" argument, and an
       optional "flags" argument, and returns a list of filenames matching the pattern, with interpretation of
       the pattern modified by the "flags" variable.

       Since v5.6.0, Perl's <b>CORE::glob()</b> is implemented in terms of <b>bsd_glob()</b>.  Note that they don't share the
       same prototype--<b>CORE::glob()</b> only accepts a single argument.  Due to historical reasons, <b>CORE::glob()</b>
       will also split its argument on whitespace, treating it as multiple patterns, whereas <b>bsd_glob()</b>
       considers them as one pattern.  But see ":bsd_glob" under "EXPORTS", below.

   <b>META</b> <b>CHARACTERS</b>
         \       Quote the next metacharacter
         []      Character class
         {}      Multiple pattern
         *       Match any string of characters
         ?       Match any single character
         ~       User name home directory

       The metanotation "a{b,c,d}e" is a shorthand for "abe ace ade".  Left to right order is preserved, with
       results of matches being sorted separately at a low level to preserve this order.  As a special case "{",
       "}", and "{}" are passed undisturbed.

   <b>EXPORTS</b>
       See also the "POSIX FLAGS" below, which can be exported individually.

       <u>":bsd_glob"</u>

       The ":bsd_glob" export tag exports <b>bsd_glob()</b> and the constants listed below.  It also overrides <b>glob()</b>
       in the calling package with one that behaves like <b>bsd_glob()</b> with regard to spaces (the space is treated
       as part of a file name), but supports iteration in scalar context; i.e., it preserves the core function's
       feature of returning the next item each time it is called.

       <u>":glob"</u>

       The ":glob" tag, now discouraged, is the old version of ":bsd_glob".  It exports the same constants and
       functions, but its <b>glob()</b> override does not support iteration; it returns the last file name in scalar
       context.  That means this will loop forever:

           use File::Glob ':glob';
           while (my $file = &lt;* copy.txt&gt;) {
               ...
           }

       <u>"bsd_glob"</u>

       This function, which is included in the two export tags listed above, takes one or two arguments.  The
       first is the glob pattern.  The second, if given, is a set of flags ORed together.  The available flags
       and the default set of flags are listed below under "POSIX FLAGS".

       Remember that to use the named constants for flags you must import them, for example with ":bsd_glob"
       described above.  If not imported, and "use strict" is not in effect, then the constants will be treated
       as bareword strings, which won't do what you what.

       <u>":nocase"</u> <u>and</u> <u>":case"</u>

       These two export tags globally modify the default flags that <b>bsd_glob()</b> and, except on VMS, Perl's built-
       in "glob" operator use.  "GLOB_NOCASE" is turned on or off, respectively.

       <u>"csh_glob"</u>

       The <b>csh_glob()</b> function can also be exported, but you should not use it directly unless you really know
       what you are doing.  It splits the pattern into words and feeds each one to <b>bsd_glob()</b>.  Perl's own
       <b>glob()</b> function uses this internally.

   <b>POSIX</b> <b>FLAGS</b>
       If no flags argument is given then "GLOB_CSH" is set, and on VMS and Windows systems, "GLOB_NOCASE" too.
       Otherwise the flags to use are determined solely by the flags argument.  The POSIX defined flags are:

       "GLOB_ERR"
           Force  <b>bsd_glob()</b>  to  return  an  error  when  it  encounters  a  directory  it cannot open or read.
           Ordinarily <b>bsd_glob()</b> continues to find matches.

       "GLOB_LIMIT"
           Make <b>bsd_glob()</b> return an error (GLOB_NOSPACE) when the pattern expands to a  size  bigger  than  the
           system constant "ARG_MAX" (usually found in limits.h).  If your system does not define this constant,
           <b>bsd_glob()</b>  uses  sysconf(_SC_ARG_MAX)  or "_POSIX_ARG_MAX" where available (in that order).  You can
           inspect these values using the standard "POSIX" extension.

       "GLOB_MARK"
           Each pathname that is a directory that matches the pattern has a slash appended.

       "GLOB_NOCASE"
           By default, file names are assumed to be case  sensitive;  this  flag  makes  <b>bsd_glob()</b>  treat  case
           differences as not significant.

       "GLOB_NOCHECK"
           If  the  pattern  does  not match any pathname, then <b>bsd_glob()</b> returns a list consisting of only the
           pattern.  If "GLOB_QUOTE" is set, its effect is present in the pattern returned.

       "GLOB_NOSORT"
           By default, the pathnames are sorted in ascending  ASCII  order;  this  flag  prevents  that  sorting
           (speeding up <b>bsd_glob()</b>).

       The FreeBSD extensions to the POSIX standard are the following flags:

       "GLOB_BRACE"
           Pre-process  the  string  to  expand  "{pat,pat,...}"  strings like <b><a href="../man1/csh.1.html">csh</a></b>(1).  The pattern '{}' is left
           unexpanded for historical reasons (and  <b><a href="../man1/csh.1.html">csh</a></b>(1)  does  the  same  thing  to  ease  typing  of  <b><a href="../man1/find.1.html">find</a></b>(1)
           patterns).

       "GLOB_NOMAGIC"
           Same  as  "GLOB_NOCHECK"  but  it  only returns the pattern if it does not contain any of the special
           characters "*", "?" or "[".  "NOMAGIC" is provided  to  simplify  implementing  the  historic  <b><a href="../man1/csh.1.html">csh</a></b>(1)
           globbing behaviour and should probably not be used anywhere else.

       "GLOB_QUOTE"
           Use  the  backslash  ('\')  character  for  quoting:  every  occurrence  of a backslash followed by a
           character in the pattern is replaced by that character, avoiding any special  interpretation  of  the
           character.  (But see below for exceptions on DOSISH systems).

       "GLOB_TILDE"
           Expand patterns that start with '~' to user name home directories.

       "GLOB_CSH"
           For  convenience,  "GLOB_CSH" is a synonym for "GLOB_BRACE | GLOB_NOMAGIC | GLOB_QUOTE | GLOB_TILDE |
           GLOB_ALPHASORT".

       The POSIX provided "GLOB_APPEND",  "GLOB_DOOFFS",  and  the  FreeBSD  extensions  "GLOB_ALTDIRFUNC",  and
       "GLOB_MAGCHAR"  flags  have  not  been  implemented in the Perl version because they involve more complex
       interaction with the underlying C structures.

       The following flag has been added in the Perl implementation for csh compatibility:

       "GLOB_ALPHASORT"
           If "GLOB_NOSORT" is not in effect, sort filenames is alphabetical order (case does not matter) rather
           than in ASCII order.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>bsd_glob()</b>  returns  a  list  of  matching  paths,  possibly  zero  length.   If   an   error   occurred,
       &amp;File::Glob::GLOB_ERROR will be non-zero and $! will be set.  &amp;File::Glob::GLOB_ERROR is guaranteed to be
       zero if no error occurred, or one of the following values otherwise:

       "GLOB_NOSPACE"
           An attempt to allocate memory failed.

       "GLOB_ABEND"
           The glob was stopped because an error was encountered.

       In  the  case  where  <b>bsd_glob()</b>  has  found some matching paths, but is interrupted by an error, it will
       return a list of filenames <b>and</b> set &amp;File::Glob::ERROR.

       Note that <b>bsd_glob()</b> deviates from POSIX and FreeBSD <b><a href="../man3/glob.3.html">glob</a></b>(3) behaviour by not  considering  "ENOENT"  and
       "ENOTDIR"  as  errors  -  <b>bsd_glob()</b> will continue processing despite those errors, unless the "GLOB_ERR"
       flag is set.

       Be aware that all filenames returned from File::Glob are tainted.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       •   If you want to use multiple patterns, e.g. "bsd_glob("a* b*")", you should probably throw them  in  a
           set  as  in  "bsd_glob("{a*,b*}")".   This  is  because the argument to <b>bsd_glob()</b> isn't subjected to
           parsing by the C shell.  Remember that you can use a backslash to escape things.

       •   On DOSISH systems, backslash is a  valid  directory  separator  character.   In  this  case,  use  of
           backslash as a quoting character (via GLOB_QUOTE) interferes with the use of backslash as a directory
           separator.   The  best  (simplest,  most  portable)  solution is to use forward slashes for directory
           separators, and backslashes for quoting.  However, this does not match  "normal  practice"  on  these
           systems.   As  a concession to user expectation, therefore, backslashes (under GLOB_QUOTE) only quote
           the glob metacharacters '[', ']', '{', '}', '-', '~', and backslash itself.   All  other  backslashes
           are passed through unchanged.

       •   Win32  users  should  use  the  real  slash.   If  you really want to use backslashes, consider using
           Sarathy's File::DosGlob, which comes with the standard Perl distribution.
