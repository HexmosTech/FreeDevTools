</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       glob - Return names of files that match patterns

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>glob</b> ?<u>switches</u>? ?<u>pattern</u> <u>...</u>?
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  command  performs  file  name  “globbing”  in a fashion similar to the csh shell or bash shell.  It
       returns a list of the files whose names match any of  the  <u>pattern</u>  arguments.  No  particular  order  is
       guaranteed in the list, so if a sorted list is required the caller should use <b>lsort</b>.

   <b>OPTIONS</b>
       If  the  initial arguments to <b>glob</b> start with <b>-</b> then they are treated as switches. The following switches
       are currently supported:

       <b>-directory</b> <u>directory</u>
              Search for files which match the given patterns starting  in  the  given  <u>directory</u>.  This  allows
              searching  of  directories whose name contains glob-sensitive characters without the need to quote
              such characters explicitly. This option may not be used in conjunction with <b>-path</b>, which  is  used
              to allow searching for complete file paths whose names may contain glob-sensitive characters.

       <b>-join</b>  The remaining pattern arguments, after option processing, are treated as a single pattern obtained
              by joining the arguments with directory separators.

       <b>-nocomplain</b>
              Allows  an  empty  list  to be returned without error; This is the default behavior in Tcl 9.0, so
              this switch has no effect any more.

       <b>-path</b> <u>pathPrefix</u>
              Search for files with the given <u>pathPrefix</u> where the rest of the name matches the given  patterns.
              This  allows  searching  for  files with names similar to a given file (as opposed to a directory)
              even when the names contain glob-sensitive characters. This option may not be used in  conjunction
              with  <b>-directory</b>.  For  example, to find all files with the same root name as $path, but differing
              extensions, you should use “<b>glob</b> <b>-path</b> <b>[file</b> <b>rootname</b> <b>$path]</b> <b>.*</b>”  which will work  even  if  <b>$path</b>
              contains numerous glob-sensitive characters.

       <b>-tails</b> Only  return  the part of each file found which follows the last directory named in any <b>-directory</b>
              or <b>-path</b> path specification.  Thus “<b>glob</b> <b>-tails</b> <b>-directory</b> <b>$dir</b>  <b>*</b>”  is  equivalent  to  “<b>set</b>  <b>pwd</b>
              <b>[pwd];</b>  <b>cd</b>  <b>$dir;</b> <b>glob</b> <b>*;</b> <b>cd</b> <b>$pwd</b>”.  For <b>-path</b> specifications, the returned names will include the
              last path segment, so “<b>glob</b> <b>-tails</b> <b>-path</b> <b>[file</b> <b>rootname</b> <b>/home/fred/foo.tex]</b> <b>.*</b>”  will return paths
              like <b>foo.aux</b> <b>foo.bib</b> <b>foo.tex</b> etc.

       <b>-types</b> <u>typeList</u>
              Only list files or directories which match <u>typeList</u>, where the items in the list have  two  forms.
              The  first  form  is  like  the  -type  option of the Unix find command: <u>b</u> (block special file), <u>c</u>
              (character special file), <u>d</u> (directory), <u>f</u> (plain file), <u>l</u> (symbolic link), <u>p</u> (named pipe),  or  <u>s</u>
              (socket),  where  multiple  types  may be specified in the list.  <b>Glob</b> will return all files which
              match at least one of the types given.  Note that symbolic links will be returned both if <b>-types</b> <b>l</b>
              is given, or if the target of a link matches the requested type. So, a link to a directory will be
              returned if <b>-types</b> <b>d</b> was specified.

              The second form specifies types where all the types given must match.  These are <u>r</u>, <u>w</u>, <u>x</u>  as  file
              permissions,  and  <u>readonly</u>, <u>hidden</u> as special permission cases. On the Macintosh, macOS types and
              creators are also supported, where any item which is four characters long is assumed to be a macOS
              type (e.g. <b>TEXT</b>). Items which are of the form <u>{macintosh</u> <u>type</u> <u>XXXX}</u> or  <u>{macintosh</u>  <u>creator</u>  <u>XXXX}</u>
              will match types or creators respectively. Unrecognized types, or specifications of multiple macOS
              types/creators will signal an error.

              The  two  forms  may be mixed, so <b>-types</b> <b>{d</b> <b>f</b> <b>r</b> <b>w}</b> will find all regular files OR directories that
              have both read AND write permissions.  The following are equivalent:

                     <b>glob</b> <b>-type</b> <b>d</b> <b>*</b>
                     <b>glob</b> <b>*/</b>

              except that the first case doesn't return the trailing “/” and is more platform independent.

       <b>--</b>     Marks the end of switches. The argument following this one will be treated as a <u>pattern</u> even if it
              starts with a <b>-</b>.

   <b>GLOBBING</b> <b>PATTERNS</b>
       The <u>pattern</u> arguments may contain any of the following special characters, which are a superset of  those
       supported by <b>string</b> <b>match</b>:

       <b>?</b>         Matches any single character.

       <b>*</b>         Matches any sequence of zero or more characters.

       <b>[</b><u>chars</u><b>]</b>   Matches  any  single  character in <u>chars</u>. If <u>chars</u> contains a sequence of the form <u>a</u><b>-</b><u>b</u> then any
                 character between <u>a</u> and <u>b</u> (inclusive) will match.

       <b>\</b><u>x</u>        Matches the character <u>x</u>.

       <b>{</b><u>a</u><b>,</b><u>b</u><b>,</b><u>...</u><b>}</b> Matches any of the sub-patterns <u>a</u>, <u>b</u>, etc.

       On Unix, as with csh, a “.” at the beginning of a file's name  or  just  after  a  “/”  must  be  matched
       explicitly  or with a {} construct, unless the <b>-types</b> <b>hidden</b> flag is given (since “.” at the beginning of
       a file's name indicates that it is hidden). On other platforms, files beginning with a “.” are handled no
       differently to any others, except the special directories “.” and “..” which must be  matched  explicitly
       (this is to avoid a recursive pattern like “glob -join * * * *” from recursing up the directory hierarchy
       as well as down). In addition, all “/” characters must be matched explicitly.

       The <b>glob</b> command differs from csh globbing in two ways.  First, it does not sort its result list (use the
       <b>lsort</b>  command  if you want the list sorted).  Second, <b>glob</b> only returns the names of files that actually
       exist; in csh no check for existence is made unless a pattern contains a ?, *, or [] construct.

</pre><h4><b>WINDOWS</b> <b>PORTABILITY</b> <b>ISSUES</b></h4><pre>
       For Windows UNC names, the servername and sharename components of the path may not contain ?,  *,  or  []
       constructs.

       Since the backslash character has a special meaning to the glob command, glob patterns containing Windows
       style path separators need special care. The pattern “<u>C:\\foo\\*</u>” is interpreted as “<u>C:\foo\*</u>” where “<u>\f</u>”
       will  match  the  single  character  “<u>f</u>”  and  “<u>\*</u>”  will  match the single character “<u>*</u>” and will not be
       interpreted as a wildcard character. One solution to this problem is to use the Unix style forward  slash
       as a path separator. Windows style paths can be converted to Unix style paths with the command “<b>file</b> <b>join</b>
       <b>$path</b>” or “<b>file</b> <b>normalize</b> <b>$path</b>”.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Find all the Tcl files in the current directory:

              <b>glob</b> *.tcl

       Find all the Tcl files in the user's home directory, irrespective of what the current directory is:

              <b>glob</b> -directory [file home] *.tcl

       Find all subdirectories of the current directory:

              <b>glob</b> -type d *

       Find all files whose name contains an “a”, a “b” or the sequence “cde”:

              <b>glob</b> -type f *{a,b,cde}*
