       <b>Purpose:</b>

               CHESVXX uses the diagonal pivoting factorization to compute the
               solution to a complex system of linear equations A * X = B, where
               A is an N-by-N Hermitian matrix and X and B are N-by-NRHS
               matrices.

               If requested, both normwise and maximum componentwise error bounds
               are returned. CHESVXX will return a solution with a tiny
               guaranteed error (O(eps) where eps is the working machine
               precision) unless the matrix is very ill-conditioned, in which
               case a warning is returned. Relevant condition numbers also are
               calculated and returned.

               CHESVXX accepts user-provided factorizations and equilibration
               factors; see the definitions of the FACT and EQUED options.
               Solving with refinement and using a factorization from a previous
               CHESVXX call will also produce a solution with either O(eps)
               errors or warnings, but we cannot make that claim for general
               user-provided factorizations and equilibration factors if they
               differ from what CHESVXX would itself produce.

       <b>Description:</b>

               The following steps are performed:

               1. If FACT = 'E', real scaling factors are computed to equilibrate
               the system:

                 diag(S)*A*diag(S)     *inv(diag(S))*X = diag(S)*B

               Whether or not the system will be equilibrated depends on the
               scaling of the matrix A, but if equilibration is used, A is
               overwritten by diag(S)*A*diag(S) and B by diag(S)*B.

               2. If FACT = 'N' or 'E', the LU decomposition is used to factor
               the matrix A (after equilibration if FACT = 'E') as

                  A = U * D * U**T,  if UPLO = 'U', or
                  A = L * D * L**T,  if UPLO = 'L',

               where U (or L) is a product of permutation and unit upper (lower)
               triangular matrices, and D is Hermitian and block diagonal with
               1-by-1 and 2-by-2 diagonal blocks.

               3. If some D(i,i)=0, so that D is exactly singular, then the
               routine returns with INFO = i. Otherwise, the factored form of A
               is used to estimate the condition number of the matrix A (see
               argument RCOND).  If the reciprocal of the condition number is
               less than machine precision, the routine still goes on to solve
               for X and compute error bounds as described below.

               4. The system of equations is solved for X using the factored form
               of A.

               5. By default (unless PARAMS(LA_LINRX_ITREF_I) is set to zero),
               the routine will use iterative refinement to try to get a small
               error and error bounds.  Refinement calculates the residual to at
               least twice the working precision.

               6. If equilibration was used, the matrix X is premultiplied by
               diag(R) so that it solves the original system before
               equilibration.

                Some optional parameters are bundled in the PARAMS array.  These
                settings determine how refinement is performed, but often the
                defaults are acceptable.  If the defaults are acceptable, users
                can pass NPARAMS = 0 which prevents the source code from accessing
                the PARAMS argument.

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>FACT</u>

                     FACT is CHARACTER*1
                Specifies whether or not the factored form of the matrix A is
                supplied on entry, and if not, whether the matrix A should be
                equilibrated before it is factored.
                  = 'F':  On entry, AF and IPIV contain the factored form of A.
                          If EQUED is not 'N', the matrix A has been
                          equilibrated with scaling factors given by S.
                          A, AF, and IPIV are not modified.
                  = 'N':  The matrix A will be copied to AF and factored.
                  = 'E':  The matrix A will be equilibrated if necessary, then
                          copied to AF and factored.

           <u>UPLO</u>

                     UPLO is CHARACTER*1
                  = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;
                  = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.

           <u>N</u>

                     N is INTEGER
                The number of linear equations, i.e., the order of the
                matrix A.  N &gt;= 0.

           <u>NRHS</u>

                     NRHS is INTEGER
                The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns
                of the matrices B and X.  NRHS &gt;= 0.

           <u>A</u>

                     A is COMPLEX array, dimension (LDA,N)
                The Hermitian matrix A.  If UPLO = 'U', the leading N-by-N
                upper triangular part of A contains the upper triangular
                part of the matrix A, and the strictly lower triangular
                part of A is not referenced.  If UPLO = 'L', the leading
                N-by-N lower triangular part of A contains the lower
                triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly upper
                triangular part of A is not referenced.

                On exit, if FACT = 'E' and EQUED = 'Y', A is overwritten by
                diag(S)*A*diag(S).

           <u>LDA</u>

                     LDA is INTEGER
                The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA &gt;= max(1,N).

           <u>AF</u>

                     AF is COMPLEX array, dimension (LDAF,N)
                If FACT = 'F', then AF is an input argument and on entry
                contains the block diagonal matrix D and the multipliers
                used to obtain the factor U or L from the factorization A =
                U*D*U**H or A = L*D*L**H as computed by CHETRF.

                If FACT = 'N', then AF is an output argument and on exit
                returns the block diagonal matrix D and the multipliers
                used to obtain the factor U or L from the factorization A =
                U*D*U**H or A = L*D*L**H.

           <u>LDAF</u>

                     LDAF is INTEGER
                The leading dimension of the array AF.  LDAF &gt;= max(1,N).

           <u>IPIV</u>

                     IPIV is INTEGER array, dimension (N)
                If FACT = 'F', then IPIV is an input argument and on entry
                contains details of the interchanges and the block
                structure of D, as determined by CHETRF.  If IPIV(k) &gt; 0,
                then rows and columns k and IPIV(k) were interchanged and
                D(k,k) is a 1-by-1 diagonal block.  If UPLO = 'U' and
                IPIV(k) = IPIV(k-1) &lt; 0, then rows and columns k-1 and
                -IPIV(k) were interchanged and D(k-1:k,k-1:k) is a 2-by-2
                diagonal block.  If UPLO = 'L' and IPIV(k) = IPIV(k+1) &lt; 0,
                then rows and columns k+1 and -IPIV(k) were interchanged
                and D(k:k+1,k:k+1) is a 2-by-2 diagonal block.

                If FACT = 'N', then IPIV is an output argument and on exit
                contains details of the interchanges and the block
                structure of D, as determined by CHETRF.

           <u>EQUED</u>

                     EQUED is CHARACTER*1
                Specifies the form of equilibration that was done.
                  = 'N':  No equilibration (always true if FACT = 'N').
                  = 'Y':  Both row and column equilibration, i.e., A has been
                          replaced by diag(S) * A * diag(S).
                EQUED is an input argument if FACT = 'F'; otherwise, it is an
                output argument.

           <u>S</u>

                     S is REAL array, dimension (N)
                The scale factors for A.  If EQUED = 'Y', A is multiplied on
                the left and right by diag(S).  S is an input argument if FACT =
                'F'; otherwise, S is an output argument.  If FACT = 'F' and EQUED
                = 'Y', each element of S must be positive.  If S is output, each
                element of S is a power of the radix. If S is input, each element
                of S should be a power of the radix to ensure a reliable solution
                and error estimates. Scaling by powers of the radix does not cause
                rounding errors unless the result underflows or overflows.
                Rounding errors during scaling lead to refining with a matrix that
                is not equivalent to the input matrix, producing error estimates
                that may not be reliable.

           <u>B</u>

                     B is COMPLEX array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
                On entry, the N-by-NRHS right hand side matrix B.
                On exit,
                if EQUED = 'N', B is not modified;
                if EQUED = 'Y', B is overwritten by diag(S)*B;

           <u>LDB</u>

                     LDB is INTEGER
                The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB &gt;= max(1,N).

           <u>X</u>

                     X is COMPLEX array, dimension (LDX,NRHS)
                If INFO = 0, the N-by-NRHS solution matrix X to the original
                system of equations.  Note that A and B are modified on exit if
                EQUED .ne. 'N', and the solution to the equilibrated system is
                inv(diag(S))*X.

           <u>LDX</u>

                     LDX is INTEGER
                The leading dimension of the array X.  LDX &gt;= max(1,N).

           <u>RCOND</u>

                     RCOND is REAL
                Reciprocal scaled condition number.  This is an estimate of the
                reciprocal Skeel condition number of the matrix A after
                equilibration (if done).  If this is less than the machine
                precision (in particular, if it is zero), the matrix is singular
                to working precision.  Note that the error may still be small even
                if this number is very small and the matrix appears ill-
                conditioned.

           <u>RPVGRW</u>

                     RPVGRW is REAL
                Reciprocal pivot growth.  On exit, this contains the reciprocal
                pivot growth factor norm(A)/norm(U). The 'max absolute element'
                norm is used.  If this is much less than 1, then the stability of
                the LU factorization of the (equilibrated) matrix A could be poor.
                This also means that the solution X, estimated condition numbers,
                and error bounds could be unreliable. If factorization fails with
                0&lt;INFO&lt;=N, then this contains the reciprocal pivot growth factor
                for the leading INFO columns of A.

           <u>BERR</u>

                     BERR is REAL array, dimension (NRHS)
                Componentwise relative backward error.  This is the
                componentwise relative backward error of each solution vector X(j)
                (i.e., the smallest relative change in any element of A or B that
                makes X(j) an exact solution).

           <u>N_ERR_BNDS</u>

                     N_ERR_BNDS is INTEGER
                Number of error bounds to return for each right hand side
                and each type (normwise or componentwise).  See ERR_BNDS_NORM and
                ERR_BNDS_COMP below.

           <u>ERR_BNDS_NORM</u>

                     ERR_BNDS_NORM is REAL array, dimension (NRHS, N_ERR_BNDS)
                For each right-hand side, this array contains information about
                various error bounds and condition numbers corresponding to the
                normwise relative error, which is defined as follows:

                Normwise relative error in the ith solution vector:
                        max_j (abs(XTRUE(j,i) - X(j,i)))
                       ------------------------------
                             max_j abs(X(j,i))

                The array is indexed by the type of error information as described
                below. There currently are up to three pieces of information
                returned.

                The first index in ERR_BNDS_NORM(i,:) corresponds to the ith
                right-hand side.

                The second index in ERR_BNDS_NORM(:,err) contains the following
                three fields:
                err = 1 'Trust/don't trust' boolean. Trust the answer if the

           <u>ERR_BNDS_COMP</u>

                     ERR_BNDS_COMP is REAL array, dimension (NRHS, N_ERR_BNDS)
                For each right-hand side, this array contains information about
                various error bounds and condition numbers corresponding to the
                componentwise relative error, which is defined as follows:

                Componentwise relative error in the ith solution vector:
                               abs(XTRUE(j,i) - X(j,i))
                        max_j ----------------------
                                    abs(X(j,i))

                The array is indexed by the right-hand side i (on which the
                componentwise relative error depends), and the type of error
                information as described below. There currently are up to three
                pieces of information returned for each right-hand side. If
                componentwise accuracy is not requested (<a href="../man3/PARAMS.3.html">PARAMS</a>(3) = 0.0), then
                ERR_BNDS_COMP is not accessed.  If N_ERR_BNDS &lt; 3, then at most
                the first (:,N_ERR_BNDS) entries are returned.

                The first index in ERR_BNDS_COMP(i,:) corresponds to the ith
                right-hand side.

                The second index in ERR_BNDS_COMP(:,err) contains the following
                three fields:
                err = 1 'Trust/don't trust' boolean. Trust the answer if the
                         reciprocal condition number is less than the threshold
                         sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon').

                err = 2 'Guaranteed' error bound: The estimated forward error,
                         almost certainly within a factor of 10 of the true error
                         so long as the next entry is greater than the threshold
                         sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon'). This error bound should only
                         be trusted if the previous boolean is true.

                err = 3  Reciprocal condition number: Estimated componentwise
                         reciprocal condition number.  Compared with the threshold
                         sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon') to determine if the error
                         estimate is 'guaranteed'. These reciprocal condition
                         numbers are 1 / (norm(Z^{-1},inf) * norm(Z,inf)) for some
                         appropriately scaled matrix Z.
                         Let Z = S*(A*diag(x)), where x is the solution for the
                         current right-hand side and S scales each row of
                         A*diag(x) by a power of the radix so all absolute row
                         sums of Z are approximately 1.

        <b>CSYSVXX</b> <b>computes</b> <b>the</b> <b>solution</b> <b>to</b> <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>linear</b> <b>equations</b> <b>A</b> <b>*</b> <b>X</b> <b>=</b> <b>B</b> <b>for</b> <b>SY</b> <b>matrices</b>

       <b>Purpose:</b>

               CSYSVXX uses the diagonal pivoting factorization to compute the
               solution to a complex system of linear equations A * X = B, where
               A is an N-by-N symmetric matrix and X and B are N-by-NRHS
               matrices.

               If requested, both normwise and maximum componentwise error bounds
               are returned. CSYSVXX will return a solution with a tiny
               guaranteed error (O(eps) where eps is the working machine
               precision) unless the matrix is very ill-conditioned, in which
               case a warning is returned. Relevant condition numbers also are
               calculated and returned.

               CSYSVXX accepts user-provided factorizations and equilibration
               factors; see the definitions of the FACT and EQUED options.
               Solving with refinement and using a factorization from a previous
               CSYSVXX call will also produce a solution with either O(eps)
               errors or warnings, but we cannot make that claim for general
               user-provided factorizations and equilibration factors if they
               differ from what CSYSVXX would itself produce.

       <b>Description:</b>

               The following steps are performed:

               1. If FACT = 'E', real scaling factors are computed to equilibrate
               the system:

                 diag(S)*A*diag(S)     *inv(diag(S))*X = diag(S)*B

               Whether or not the system will be equilibrated depends on the
               scaling of the matrix A, but if equilibration is used, A is
               overwritten by diag(S)*A*diag(S) and B by diag(S)*B.

               2. If FACT = 'N' or 'E', the LU decomposition is used to factor
               the matrix A (after equilibration if FACT = 'E') as

                  A = U * D * U**T,  if UPLO = 'U', or
                  A = L * D * L**T,  if UPLO = 'L',

               where U (or L) is a product of permutation and unit upper (lower)
               triangular matrices, and D is symmetric and block diagonal with
               1-by-1 and 2-by-2 diagonal blocks.

               3. If some D(i,i)=0, so that D is exactly singular, then the
               routine returns with INFO = i. Otherwise, the factored form of A
               is used to estimate the condition number of the matrix A (see
               argument RCOND).  If the reciprocal of the condition number is
               less than machine precision, the routine still goes on to solve
               for X and compute error bounds as described below.

               4. The system of equations is solved for X using the factored form
               of A.

               5. By default (unless PARAMS(LA_LINRX_ITREF_I) is set to zero),
               the routine will use iterative refinement to try to get a small
               error and error bounds.  Refinement calculates the residual to at
               least twice the working precision.

               6. If equilibration was used, the matrix X is premultiplied by
               diag(R) so that it solves the original system before
               equilibration.

                Some optional parameters are bundled in the PARAMS array.  These
                settings determine how refinement is performed, but often the
                defaults are acceptable.  If the defaults are acceptable, users
                can pass NPARAMS = 0 which prevents the source code from accessing
                the PARAMS argument.

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>FACT</u>

                     FACT is CHARACTER*1
                Specifies whether or not the factored form of the matrix A is
                supplied on entry, and if not, whether the matrix A should be
                equilibrated before it is factored.
                  = 'F':  On entry, AF and IPIV contain the factored form of A.
                          If EQUED is not 'N', the matrix A has been
                          equilibrated with scaling factors given by S.
                          A, AF, and IPIV are not modified.
                  = 'N':  The matrix A will be copied to AF and factored.
                  = 'E':  The matrix A will be equilibrated if necessary, then
                          copied to AF and factored.

           <u>UPLO</u>

                     UPLO is CHARACTER*1
                  = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;
                  = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.

           <u>N</u>

                     N is INTEGER
                The number of linear equations, i.e., the order of the
                matrix A.  N &gt;= 0.

                     NRHS is INTEGER
                The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns
                of the matrices B and X.  NRHS &gt;= 0.

           <u>A</u>

                     A is COMPLEX array, dimension (LDA,N)
                The symmetric matrix A.  If UPLO = 'U', the leading N-by-N
                upper triangular part of A contains the upper triangular
                part of the matrix A, and the strictly lower triangular
                part of A is not referenced.  If UPLO = 'L', the leading
                N-by-N lower triangular part of A contains the lower
                triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly upper
                triangular part of A is not referenced.

                On exit, if FACT = 'E' and EQUED = 'Y', A is overwritten by
                diag(S)*A*diag(S).

           <u>LDA</u>

                     LDA is INTEGER
                The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA &gt;= max(1,N).

           <u>AF</u>

                     AF is COMPLEX array, dimension (LDAF,N)
                If FACT = 'F', then AF is an input argument and on entry
                contains the block diagonal matrix D and the multipliers
                used to obtain the factor U or L from the factorization A =
                U*D*U**T or A = L*D*L**T as computed by CSYTRF.

                If FACT = 'N', then AF is an output argument and on exit
                returns the block diagonal matrix D and the multipliers
                used to obtain the factor U or L from the factorization A =
                U*D*U**T or A = L*D*L**T.

           <u>LDAF</u>

                     LDAF is INTEGER
                The leading dimension of the array AF.  LDAF &gt;= max(1,N).

           <u>IPIV</u>

                     IPIV is INTEGER array, dimension (N)
                If FACT = 'F', then IPIV is an input argument and on entry
                contains details of the interchanges and the block
                structure of D, as determined by CSYTRF.  If IPIV(k) &gt; 0,
                then rows and columns k and IPIV(k) were interchanged and
                D(k,k) is a 1-by-1 diagonal block.  If UPLO = 'U' and
                IPIV(k) = IPIV(k-1) &lt; 0, then rows and columns k-1 and
                -IPIV(k) were interchanged and D(k-1:k,k-1:k) is a 2-by-2
                diagonal block.  If UPLO = 'L' and IPIV(k) = IPIV(k+1) &lt; 0,
                then rows and columns k+1 and -IPIV(k) were interchanged
                and D(k:k+1,k:k+1) is a 2-by-2 diagonal block.

                If FACT = 'N', then IPIV is an output argument and on exit
                contains details of the interchanges and the block
                structure of D, as determined by CSYTRF.

           <u>EQUED</u>

                     EQUED is CHARACTER*1
                Specifies the form of equilibration that was done.
                  = 'N':  No equilibration (always true if FACT = 'N').
                  = 'Y':  Both row and column equilibration, i.e., A has been
                          replaced by diag(S) * A * diag(S).
                EQUED is an input argument if FACT = 'F'; otherwise, it is an
                output argument.

           <u>S</u>

                     S is REAL array, dimension (N)
                The scale factors for A.  If EQUED = 'Y', A is multiplied on
                the left and right by diag(S).  S is an input argument if FACT =
                'F'; otherwise, S is an output argument.  If FACT = 'F' and EQUED
                = 'Y', each element of S must be positive.  If S is output, each
                element of S is a power of the radix. If S is input, each element
                of S should be a power of the radix to ensure a reliable solution
                and error estimates. Scaling by powers of the radix does not cause
                rounding errors unless the result underflows or overflows.
                Rounding errors during scaling lead to refining with a matrix that
                is not equivalent to the input matrix, producing error estimates
                that may not be reliable.

           <u>B</u>

                     B is COMPLEX array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
                On entry, the N-by-NRHS right hand side matrix B.
                On exit,
                if EQUED = 'N', B is not modified;
                if EQUED = 'Y', B is overwritten by diag(S)*B;

           <u>LDB</u>

                     LDB is INTEGER
                The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB &gt;= max(1,N).

           <u>X</u>

                     X is COMPLEX array, dimension (LDX,NRHS)
                If INFO = 0, the N-by-NRHS solution matrix X to the original
                system of equations.  Note that A and B are modified on exit if
                EQUED .ne. 'N', and the solution to the equilibrated system is
                inv(diag(S))*X.

           <u>LDX</u>

                     LDX is INTEGER
                The leading dimension of the array X.  LDX &gt;= max(1,N).

           <u>RCOND</u>

                     RCOND is REAL
                Reciprocal scaled condition number.  This is an estimate of the
                reciprocal Skeel condition number of the matrix A after
                equilibration (if done).  If this is less than the machine
                precision (in particular, if it is zero), the matrix is singular
                to working precision.  Note that the error may still be small even
                if this number is very small and the matrix appears ill-
                conditioned.

           <u>RPVGRW</u>

                     RPVGRW is REAL
                Reciprocal pivot growth.  On exit, this contains the reciprocal
                pivot growth factor norm(A)/norm(U). The 'max absolute element'
                norm is used.  If this is much less than 1, then the stability of
                the LU factorization of the (equilibrated) matrix A could be poor.
                This also means that the solution X, estimated condition numbers,
                and error bounds could be unreliable. If factorization fails with
                0&lt;INFO&lt;=N, then this contains the reciprocal pivot growth factor
                for the leading INFO columns of A.

           <u>BERR</u>

                     BERR is REAL array, dimension (NRHS)
                Componentwise relative backward error.  This is the
                componentwise relative backward error of each solution vector X(j)
                (i.e., the smallest relative change in any element of A or B that
                makes X(j) an exact solution).

           <u>N_ERR_BNDS</u>

                     N_ERR_BNDS is INTEGER
                Number of error bounds to return for each right hand side
                and each type (normwise or componentwise).  See ERR_BNDS_NORM and
                ERR_BNDS_COMP below.

           <u>ERR_BNDS_NORM</u>

                     ERR_BNDS_NORM is REAL array, dimension (NRHS, N_ERR_BNDS)
                For each right-hand side, this array contains information about
                various error bounds and condition numbers corresponding to the
                normwise relative error, which is defined as follows:

                Normwise relative error in the ith solution vector:
                        max_j (abs(XTRUE(j,i) - X(j,i)))
                       ------------------------------
                             max_j abs(X(j,i))

                The array is indexed by the type of error information as described
                below. There currently are up to three pieces of information
                returned.

                The first index in ERR_BNDS_NORM(i,:) corresponds to the ith
                right-hand side.

                The second index in ERR_BNDS_NORM(:,err) contains the following
                three fields:
                err = 1 'Trust/don't trust' boolean. Trust the answer if the
                         reciprocal condition number is less than the threshold
                         sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon').

                err = 2 'Guaranteed' error bound: The estimated forward error,
                         almost certainly within a factor of 10 of the true error
                         so long as the next entry is greater than the threshold
                         sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon'). This error bound should only
                         be trusted if the previous boolean is true.

                err = 3  Reciprocal condition number: Estimated normwise
                         reciprocal condition number.  Compared with the threshold
                         sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon') to determine if the error
                         estimate is 'guaranteed'. These reciprocal condition
                         numbers are 1 / (norm(Z^{-1},inf) * norm(Z,inf)) for some
                         appropriately scaled matrix Z.
                         Let Z = S*A, where S scales each row by a power of the
                         radix so all absolute row sums of Z are approximately 1.

                See Lapack Working Note 165 for further details and extra
                cautions.

           <u>ERR_BNDS_COMP</u>

                     ERR_BNDS_COMP is REAL array, dimension (NRHS, N_ERR_BNDS)
                For each right-hand side, this array contains information about
                various error bounds and condition numbers corresponding to the
                componentwise relative error, which is defined as follows:

                Componentwise relative error in the ith solution vector:
                               abs(XTRUE(j,i) - X(j,i))
                        max_j ----------------------
                                    abs(X(j,i))

                The array is indexed by the right-hand side i (on which the
                componentwise relative error depends), and the type of error
                information as described below. There currently are up to three
                pieces of information returned for each right-hand side. If
                componentwise accuracy is not requested (<a href="../man3/PARAMS.3.html">PARAMS</a>(3) = 0.0), then
                ERR_BNDS_COMP is not accessed.  If N_ERR_BNDS &lt; 3, then at most
                the first (:,N_ERR_BNDS) entries are returned.

                The first index in ERR_BNDS_COMP(i,:) corresponds to the ith
                right-hand side.

                The second index in ERR_BNDS_COMP(:,err) contains the following
                three fields:
                err = 1 'Trust/don't trust' boolean. Trust the answer if the

                err = 2 'Guaranteed' error bound: The estimated forward error,
                         almost certainly within a factor of 10 of the true error
                         so long as the next entry is greater than the threshold

                         be trusted if the previous boolean is true.

                err = 3  Reciprocal condition number: Estimated componentwise
                         reciprocal condition number.  Compared with the threshold

                         Let Z = S*(A*diag(x)), where x is the solution for the
                         current right-hand side and S scales each row of
                         A*diag(x) by a power of the radix so all absolute row
                         sums of Z are approximately 1.

           <u>NPARAMS</u>

                     NPARAMS is INTEGER
                Specifies the number of parameters set in PARAMS.  If &lt;= 0, the
                PARAMS array is never referenced and default values are used.

           <u>PARAMS</u>

                     PARAMS is REAL array, dimension NPARAMS
                Specifies algorithm parameters.  If an entry is &lt; 0.0, then
                that entry will be filled with default value used for that
                parameter.  Only positions up to NPARAMS are accessed; defaults

       <b>DSYSVXX</b>

       <b>Purpose:</b>

               DSYSVXX uses the diagonal pivoting factorization to compute the
               solution to a double precision system of linear equations A * X = B, where A
               is an N-by-N symmetric matrix and X and B are N-by-NRHS matrices.

               If requested, both normwise and maximum componentwise error bounds
               are returned. DSYSVXX will return a solution with a tiny
               guaranteed error (O(eps) where eps is the working machine
               precision) unless the matrix is very ill-conditioned, in which
               case a warning is returned. Relevant condition numbers also are
               calculated and returned.

               DSYSVXX accepts user-provided factorizations and equilibration
               factors; see the definitions of the FACT and EQUED options.
               Solving with refinement and using a factorization from a previous
               DSYSVXX call will also produce a solution with either O(eps)
               errors or warnings, but we cannot make that claim for general
               user-provided factorizations and equilibration factors if they
               differ from what DSYSVXX would itself produce.

       <b>Description:</b>

               The following steps are performed:

               1. If FACT = 'E', double precision scaling factors are computed to equilibrate
               the system:

                 diag(S)*A*diag(S)     *inv(diag(S))*X = diag(S)*B

               Whether or not the system will be equilibrated depends on the
               scaling of the matrix A, but if equilibration is used, A is
               overwritten by diag(S)*A*diag(S) and B by diag(S)*B.

               2. If FACT = 'N' or 'E', the LU decomposition is used to factor
               the matrix A (after equilibration if FACT = 'E') as

                  A = U * D * U**T,  if UPLO = 'U', or
                  A = L * D * L**T,  if UPLO = 'L',

               where U (or L) is a product of permutation and unit upper (lower)
               triangular matrices, and D is symmetric and block diagonal with
               1-by-1 and 2-by-2 diagonal blocks.

               3. If some D(i,i)=0, so that D is exactly singular, then the
               routine returns with INFO = i. Otherwise, the factored form of A
               is used to estimate the condition number of the matrix A (see
               argument RCOND).  If the reciprocal of the condition number is
               less than machine precision, the routine still goes on to solve
               for X and compute error bounds as described below.

               4. The system of equations is solved for X using the factored form
               of A.

               5. By default (unless PARAMS(LA_LINRX_ITREF_I) is set to zero),
               the routine will use iterative refinement to try to get a small
               error and error bounds.  Refinement calculates the residual to at
               least twice the working precision.

               6. If equilibration was used, the matrix X is premultiplied by
               diag(R) so that it solves the original system before
               equilibration.

                Some optional parameters are bundled in the PARAMS array.  These
                settings determine how refinement is performed, but often the
                defaults are acceptable.  If the defaults are acceptable, users
                can pass NPARAMS = 0 which prevents the source code from accessing
                the PARAMS argument.

                     FACT is CHARACTER*1

                The symmetric matrix A.  If UPLO = 'U', the leading N-by-N
                upper triangular part of A contains the upper triangular
                part of the matrix A, and the strictly lower triangular
                part of A is not referenced.  If UPLO = 'L', the leading

                triangular part of A is not referenced.

                On exit, if FACT = 'E' and EQUED = 'Y', A is overwritten by

                     AF is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDAF,N)
                If FACT = 'F', then AF is an input argument and on entry
                contains the block diagonal matrix D and the multipliers
                used to obtain the factor U or L from the factorization A =
                U*D*U**T or A = L*D*L**T as computed by DSYTRF.

                If FACT = 'N', then AF is an output argument and on exit

           <u>IPIV</u>

                     IPIV is INTEGER array, dimension (N)
                If FACT = 'F', then IPIV is an input argument and on entry
                contains details of the interchanges and the block
                structure of D, as determined by DSYTRF.  If IPIV(k) &gt; 0,
                then rows and columns k and IPIV(k) were interchanged and
                D(k,k) is a 1-by-1 diagonal block.  If UPLO = 'U' and
                IPIV(k) = IPIV(k-1) &lt; 0, then rows and columns k-1 and
                -IPIV(k) were interchanged and D(k-1:k,k-1:k) is a 2-by-2
                diagonal block.  If UPLO = 'L' and IPIV(k) = IPIV(k+1) &lt; 0,
                then rows and columns k+1 and -IPIV(k) were interchanged
                and D(k:k+1,k:k+1) is a 2-by-2 diagonal block.

                If FACT = 'N', then IPIV is an output argument and on exit
                contains details of the interchanges and the block
                structure of D, as determined by DSYTRF.

           <u>EQUED</u>

                     EQUED is CHARACTER*1
                Specifies the form of equilibration that was done.
                  = 'N':  No equilibration (always true if FACT = 'N').
                  = 'Y':  Both row and column equilibration, i.e., A has been
                          replaced by diag(S) * A * diag(S).
                EQUED is an input argument if FACT = 'F'; otherwise, it is an
                output argument.

           <u>S</u>

                     S is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
                The scale factors for A.  If EQUED = 'Y', A is multiplied on
                the left and right by diag(S).  S is an input argument if FACT =
                'F'; otherwise, S is an output argument.  If FACT = 'F' and EQUED
                = 'Y', each element of S must be positive.  If S is output, each
                element of S is a power of the radix. If S is input, each element
                of S should be a power of the radix to ensure a reliable solution
                and error estimates. Scaling by powers of the radix does not cause
                rounding errors unless the result underflows or overflows.
                Rounding errors during scaling lead to refining with a matrix that
                is not equivalent to the input matrix, producing error estimates
                that may not be reliable.

           <u>B</u>

                     B is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
                On entry, the N-by-NRHS right hand side matrix B.
                On exit,
                if EQUED = 'N', B is not modified;
                if EQUED = 'Y', B is overwritten by diag(S)*B;

           <u>LDB</u>

                     LDB is INTEGER
                The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB &gt;= max(1,N).

           <u>X</u>

                     X is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDX,NRHS)
                If INFO = 0, the N-by-NRHS solution matrix X to the original
                system of equations.  Note that A and B are modified on exit if
                EQUED .ne. 'N', and the solution to the equilibrated system is
                inv(diag(S))*X.

           <u>LDX</u>

                     LDX is INTEGER
                The leading dimension of the array X.  LDX &gt;= max(1,N).

           <u>RCOND</u>

                     RCOND is DOUBLE PRECISION
                Reciprocal scaled condition number.  This is an estimate of the
                reciprocal Skeel condition number of the matrix A after
                equilibration (if done).  If this is less than the machine
                precision (in particular, if it is zero), the matrix is singular
                to working precision.  Note that the error may still be small even
                if this number is very small and the matrix appears ill-
                conditioned.

           <u>RPVGRW</u>

                     RPVGRW is DOUBLE PRECISION
                Reciprocal pivot growth.  On exit, this contains the reciprocal
                pivot growth factor norm(A)/norm(U). The 'max absolute element'
                norm is used.  If this is much less than 1, then the stability of
                the LU factorization of the (equilibrated) matrix A could be poor.
                This also means that the solution X, estimated condition numbers,
                and error bounds could be unreliable. If factorization fails with
                0&lt;INFO&lt;=N, then this contains the reciprocal pivot growth factor
                for the leading INFO columns of A.

           <u>BERR</u>

                     BERR is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (NRHS)
                Componentwise relative backward error.  This is the
                componentwise relative backward error of each solution vector X(j)
                (i.e., the smallest relative change in any element of A or B that
                makes X(j) an exact solution).

           <u>N_ERR_BNDS</u>

                     N_ERR_BNDS is INTEGER
                Number of error bounds to return for each right hand side
                and each type (normwise or componentwise).  See ERR_BNDS_NORM and
                ERR_BNDS_COMP below.

           <u>ERR_BNDS_NORM</u>

                     ERR_BNDS_NORM is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (NRHS, N_ERR_BNDS)
                For each right-hand side, this array contains information about
                various error bounds and condition numbers corresponding to the
                normwise relative error, which is defined as follows:

                Normwise relative error in the ith solution vector:
                        max_j (abs(XTRUE(j,i) - X(j,i)))
                       ------------------------------
                             max_j abs(X(j,i))

                The array is indexed by the type of error information as described
                below. There currently are up to three pieces of information
                returned.

                The first index in ERR_BNDS_NORM(i,:) corresponds to the ith
                right-hand side.

                The second index in ERR_BNDS_NORM(:,err) contains the following
                three fields:
                err = 1 'Trust/don't trust' boolean. Trust the answer if the
                         reciprocal condition number is less than the threshold
                         sqrt(n) * dlamch('Epsilon').

                err = 2 'Guaranteed' error bound: The estimated forward error,
                         almost certainly within a factor of 10 of the true error
                         so long as the next entry is greater than the threshold
                         sqrt(n) * dlamch('Epsilon'). This error bound should only
                         be trusted if the previous boolean is true.

                err = 3  Reciprocal condition number: Estimated normwise
                         reciprocal condition number.  Compared with the threshold
                         sqrt(n) * dlamch('Epsilon') to determine if the error
                         estimate is 'guaranteed'. These reciprocal condition
                         numbers are 1 / (norm(Z^{-1},inf) * norm(Z,inf)) for some
                         appropriately scaled matrix Z.
                         Let Z = S*A, where S scales each row by a power of the
                         radix so all absolute row sums of Z are approximately 1.

                See Lapack Working Note 165 for further details and extra
                cautions.

           <u>ERR_BNDS_COMP</u>

                     ERR_BNDS_COMP is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (NRHS, N_ERR_BNDS)
                For each right-hand side, this array contains information about
                various error bounds and condition numbers corresponding to the
                componentwise relative error, which is defined as follows:

                Componentwise relative error in the ith solution vector:
                               abs(XTRUE(j,i) - X(j,i))
                        max_j ----------------------
                                    abs(X(j,i))

                The array is indexed by the right-hand side i (on which the
                componentwise relative error depends), and the type of error
                information as described below. There currently are up to three
                pieces of information returned for each right-hand side. If
                componentwise accuracy is not requested (<a href="../man3/PARAMS.3.html">PARAMS</a>(3) = 0.0), then
                ERR_BNDS_COMP is not accessed.  If N_ERR_BNDS &lt; 3, then at most
                the first (:,N_ERR_BNDS) entries are returned.

                The first index in ERR_BNDS_COMP(i,:) corresponds to the ith
                right-hand side.

                The second index in ERR_BNDS_COMP(:,err) contains the following

                         current right-hand side and S scales each row of
                         A*diag(x) by a power of the radix so all absolute row

           <u>NPARAMS</u>

                     NPARAMS is INTEGER
                Specifies the number of parameters set in PARAMS.  If &lt;= 0, the

           <u>PARAMS</u>

                     PARAMS is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (NPARAMS)
                Specifies algorithm parameters.  If an entry is &lt; 0.0, then
                that entry will be filled with default value used for that
                parameter.  Only positions up to NPARAMS are accessed; defaults

       <b>SSYSVXX</b>

       <b>Purpose:</b>

               SSYSVXX uses the diagonal pivoting factorization to compute the
               solution to a real system of linear equations A * X = B, where A
               is an N-by-N symmetric matrix and X and B are N-by-NRHS matrices.

               If requested, both normwise and maximum componentwise error bounds
               are returned. SSYSVXX will return a solution with a tiny
               guaranteed error (O(eps) where eps is the working machine
               precision) unless the matrix is very ill-conditioned, in which
               case a warning is returned. Relevant condition numbers also are
               calculated and returned.

               SSYSVXX accepts user-provided factorizations and equilibration
               factors; see the definitions of the FACT and EQUED options.
               Solving with refinement and using a factorization from a previous
               SSYSVXX call will also produce a solution with either O(eps)
               errors or warnings, but we cannot make that claim for general
               user-provided factorizations and equilibration factors if they
               differ from what SSYSVXX would itself produce.

       <b>Description:</b>

               The following steps are performed:

               1. If FACT = 'E', real scaling factors are computed to equilibrate
               the system:

                 diag(S)*A*diag(S)     *inv(diag(S))*X = diag(S)*B

               Whether or not the system will be equilibrated depends on the
               scaling of the matrix A, but if equilibration is used, A is
               overwritten by diag(S)*A*diag(S) and B by diag(S)*B.

               2. If FACT = 'N' or 'E', the LU decomposition is used to factor
               the matrix A (after equilibration if FACT = 'E') as

                  A = U * D * U**T,  if UPLO = 'U', or
                  A = L * D * L**T,  if UPLO = 'L',

               where U (or L) is a product of permutation and unit upper (lower)
               triangular matrices, and D is symmetric and block diagonal with
               1-by-1 and 2-by-2 diagonal blocks.

               3. If some D(i,i)=0, so that D is exactly singular, then the
               routine returns with INFO = i. Otherwise, the factored form of A
               is used to estimate the condition number of the matrix A (see
               argument RCOND).  If the reciprocal of the condition number is
               less than machine precision, the routine still goes on to solve
               for X and compute error bounds as described below.

               4. The system of equations is solved for X using the factored form
               of A.

               5. By default (unless PARAMS(LA_LINRX_ITREF_I) is set to zero),
               the routine will use iterative refinement to try to get a small
               error and error bounds.  Refinement calculates the residual to at
               least twice the working precision.

               6. If equilibration was used, the matrix X is premultiplied by
               diag(R) so that it solves the original system before
               equilibration.

                Some optional parameters are bundled in the PARAMS array.  These
                settings determine how refinement is performed, but often the
                defaults are acceptable.  If the defaults are acceptable, users
                can pass NPARAMS = 0 which prevents the source code from accessing
                the PARAMS argument.

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>FACT</u>

                     FACT is CHARACTER*1
                Specifies whether or not the factored form of the matrix A is
                supplied on entry, and if not, whether the matrix A should be
                equilibrated before it is factored.
                  = 'F':  On entry, AF and IPIV contain the factored form of A.
                          If EQUED is not 'N', the matrix A has been
                          equilibrated with scaling factors given by S.
                          A, AF, and IPIV are not modified.
                  = 'N':  The matrix A will be copied to AF and factored.
                  = 'E':  The matrix A will be equilibrated if necessary, then
                          copied to AF and factored.

           <u>UPLO</u>

                     UPLO is CHARACTER*1
                  = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;
                  = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.

           <u>N</u>

                     N is INTEGER
                The number of linear equations, i.e., the order of the
                matrix A.  N &gt;= 0.

           <u>NRHS</u>

                     NRHS is INTEGER
                The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns
                of the matrices B and X.  NRHS &gt;= 0.

           <u>A</u>

                     A is REAL array, dimension (LDA,N)
                The symmetric matrix A.  If UPLO = 'U', the leading N-by-N
                upper triangular part of A contains the upper triangular
                part of the matrix A, and the strictly lower triangular
                part of A is not referenced.  If UPLO = 'L', the leading
                N-by-N lower triangular part of A contains the lower
                triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly upper
                triangular part of A is not referenced.

                On exit, if FACT = 'E' and EQUED = 'Y', A is overwritten by
                diag(S)*A*diag(S).

           <u>LDA</u>

                     LDA is INTEGER
                The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA &gt;= max(1,N).

           <u>AF</u>

                     AF is REAL array, dimension (LDAF,N)
                If FACT = 'F', then AF is an input argument and on entry
                contains the block diagonal matrix D and the multipliers
                used to obtain the factor U or L from the factorization A =
                U*D*U**T or A = L*D*L**T as computed by SSYTRF.

                If FACT = 'N', then AF is an output argument and on exit
                returns the block diagonal matrix D and the multipliers
                used to obtain the factor U or L from the factorization A =
                U*D*U**T or A = L*D*L**T.

           <u>LDAF</u>

                     LDAF is INTEGER
                The leading dimension of the array AF.  LDAF &gt;= max(1,N).

           <u>IPIV</u>

                     IPIV is INTEGER array, dimension (N)
                If FACT = 'F', then IPIV is an input argument and on entry
                contains details of the interchanges and the block
                structure of D, as determined by SSYTRF.  If IPIV(k) &gt; 0,
                then rows and columns k and IPIV(k) were interchanged and
                D(k,k) is a 1-by-1 diagonal block.  If UPLO = 'U' and
                IPIV(k) = IPIV(k-1) &lt; 0, then rows and columns k-1 and
                -IPIV(k) were interchanged and D(k-1:k,k-1:k) is a 2-by-2
                diagonal block.  If UPLO = 'L' and IPIV(k) = IPIV(k+1) &lt; 0,
                then rows and columns k+1 and -IPIV(k) were interchanged
                and D(k:k+1,k:k+1) is a 2-by-2 diagonal block.

                If FACT = 'N', then IPIV is an output argument and on exit
                contains details of the interchanges and the block
                structure of D, as determined by SSYTRF.

           <u>EQUED</u>

                     EQUED is CHARACTER*1
                Specifies the form of equilibration that was done.
                  = 'N':  No equilibration (always true if FACT = 'N').
                  = 'Y':  Both row and column equilibration, i.e., A has been
                          replaced by diag(S) * A * diag(S).
                EQUED is an input argument if FACT = 'F'; otherwise, it is an
                output argument.

           <u>S</u>

                     S is REAL array, dimension (N)
                The scale factors for A.  If EQUED = 'Y', A is multiplied on
                the left and right by diag(S).  S is an input argument if FACT =
                'F'; otherwise, S is an output argument.  If FACT = 'F' and EQUED
                = 'Y', each element of S must be positive.  If S is output, each
                element of S is a power of the radix. If S is input, each element
                of S should be a power of the radix to ensure a reliable solution
                and error estimates. Scaling by powers of the radix does not cause
                rounding errors unless the result underflows or overflows.
                Rounding errors during scaling lead to refining with a matrix that
                is not equivalent to the input matrix, producing error estimates
                that may not be reliable.

           <u>B</u>

                     B is REAL array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
                On entry, the N-by-NRHS right hand side matrix B.
                On exit,
                if EQUED = 'N', B is not modified;
                if EQUED = 'Y', B is overwritten by diag(S)*B;

           <u>LDB</u>

                     LDB is INTEGER
                The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB &gt;= max(1,N).

           <u>X</u>

                     X is REAL array, dimension (LDX,NRHS)
                If INFO = 0, the N-by-NRHS solution matrix X to the original
                system of equations.  Note that A and B are modified on exit if
                EQUED .ne. 'N', and the solution to the equilibrated system is
                inv(diag(S))*X.

           <u>LDX</u>

                     LDX is INTEGER
                The leading dimension of the array X.  LDX &gt;= max(1,N).

           <u>RCOND</u>

                     RCOND is REAL
                Reciprocal scaled condition number.  This is an estimate of the
                reciprocal Skeel condition number of the matrix A after
                equilibration (if done).  If this is less than the machine
                precision (in particular, if it is zero), the matrix is singular
                to working precision.  Note that the error may still be small even
                if this number is very small and the matrix appears ill-
                conditioned.

           <u>RPVGRW</u>

                     RPVGRW is REAL
                Reciprocal pivot growth.  On exit, this contains the reciprocal
                pivot growth factor norm(A)/norm(U). The 'max absolute element'
                norm is used.  If this is much less than 1, then the stability of
                the LU factorization of the (equilibrated) matrix A could be poor.
                This also means that the solution X, estimated condition numbers,
                and error bounds could be unreliable. If factorization fails with
                0&lt;INFO&lt;=N, then this contains the reciprocal pivot growth factor
                for the leading INFO columns of A.

           <u>BERR</u>

                     BERR is REAL array, dimension (NRHS)
                Componentwise relative backward error.  This is the
                componentwise relative backward error of each solution vector X(j)
                (i.e., the smallest relative change in any element of A or B that
                makes X(j) an exact solution).

           <u>N_ERR_BNDS</u>

                     N_ERR_BNDS is INTEGER
                Number of error bounds to return for each right hand side
                and each type (normwise or componentwise).  See ERR_BNDS_NORM and
                ERR_BNDS_COMP below.

           <u>ERR_BNDS_NORM</u>

                     ERR_BNDS_NORM is REAL array, dimension (NRHS, N_ERR_BNDS)
                For each right-hand side, this array contains information about
                various error bounds and condition numbers corresponding to the
                normwise relative error, which is defined as follows:

                Normwise relative error in the ith solution vector:
                        max_j (abs(XTRUE(j,i) - X(j,i)))
                       ------------------------------
                             max_j abs(X(j,i))

                The array is indexed by the type of error information as described
                below. There currently are up to three pieces of information
                returned.

                The first index in ERR_BNDS_NORM(i,:) corresponds to the ith
                right-hand side.

                The second index in ERR_BNDS_NORM(:,err) contains the following
                three fields:
                err = 1 'Trust/don't trust' boolean. Trust the answer if the
                         reciprocal condition number is less than the threshold
                         sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon').

                err = 2 'Guaranteed' error bound: The estimated forward error,

           <u>ERR_BNDS_COMP</u>

                     ERR_BNDS_COMP is REAL array, dimension (NRHS, N_ERR_BNDS)
                For each right-hand side, this array contains information about
                various error bounds and condition numbers corresponding to the
                componentwise relative error, which is defined as follows:

                Componentwise relative error in the ith solution vector:
                               abs(XTRUE(j,i) - X(j,i))
                        max_j ----------------------
                                    abs(X(j,i))

                The array is indexed by the right-hand side i (on which the
                componentwise relative error depends), and the type of error
                information as described below. There currently are up to three
                pieces of information returned for each right-hand side. If
                componentwise accuracy is not requested (<a href="../man3/PARAMS.3.html">PARAMS</a>(3) = 0.0), then
                ERR_BNDS_COMP is not accessed.  If N_ERR_BNDS &lt; 3, then at most
                the first (:,N_ERR_BNDS) entries are returned.

                The first index in ERR_BNDS_COMP(i,:) corresponds to the ith
                right-hand side.

                The second index in ERR_BNDS_COMP(:,err) contains the following
                three fields:
                err = 1 'Trust/don't trust' boolean. Trust the answer if the
                         reciprocal condition number is less than the threshold
                         sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon').

                err = 2 'Guaranteed' error bound: The estimated forward error,
                         almost certainly within a factor of 10 of the true error
                         so long as the next entry is greater than the threshold
                         sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon'). This error bound should only
                         be trusted if the previous boolean is true.

                err = 3  Reciprocal condition number: Estimated componentwise
                         reciprocal condition number.  Compared with the threshold
                         sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon') to determine if the error
                         estimate is 'guaranteed'. These reciprocal condition
                         numbers are 1 / (norm(Z^{-1},inf) * norm(Z,inf)) for some
                         appropriately scaled matrix Z.
                         Let Z = S*(A*diag(x)), where x is the solution for the
                         current right-hand side and S scales each row of
                         A*diag(x) by a power of the radix so all absolute row
                         sums of Z are approximately 1.

        <b>ZHESVXX</b> <b>computes</b> <b>the</b> <b>solution</b> <b>to</b> <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>linear</b> <b>equations</b> <b>A</b> <b>*</b> <b>X</b> <b>=</b> <b>B</b> <b>for</b> <b>HE</b> <b>matrices</b>

       <b>Purpose:</b>

               ZHESVXX uses the diagonal pivoting factorization to compute the
               solution to a complex*16 system of linear equations A * X = B, where
               A is an N-by-N Hermitian matrix and X and B are N-by-NRHS
               matrices.

               If requested, both normwise and maximum componentwise error bounds
               are returned. ZHESVXX will return a solution with a tiny
               guaranteed error (O(eps) where eps is the working machine
               precision) unless the matrix is very ill-conditioned, in which
               case a warning is returned. Relevant condition numbers also are
               calculated and returned.

               ZHESVXX accepts user-provided factorizations and equilibration
               factors; see the definitions of the FACT and EQUED options.
               Solving with refinement and using a factorization from a previous
               ZHESVXX call will also produce a solution with either O(eps)
               errors or warnings, but we cannot make that claim for general
               user-provided factorizations and equilibration factors if they
               differ from what ZHESVXX would itself produce.

       <b>Description:</b>

               The following steps are performed:

               1. If FACT = 'E', double precision scaling factors are computed to equilibrate
               the system:

                 diag(S)*A*diag(S)     *inv(diag(S))*X = diag(S)*B

               Whether or not the system will be equilibrated depends on the
               scaling of the matrix A, but if equilibration is used, A is
               overwritten by diag(S)*A*diag(S) and B by diag(S)*B.

               2. If FACT = 'N' or 'E', the LU decomposition is used to factor
               the matrix A (after equilibration if FACT = 'E') as

                  A = U * D * U**T,  if UPLO = 'U', or
                  A = L * D * L**T,  if UPLO = 'L',

               where U (or L) is a product of permutation and unit upper (lower)
               triangular matrices, and D is Hermitian and block diagonal with
               1-by-1 and 2-by-2 diagonal blocks.

               3. If some D(i,i)=0, so that D is exactly singular, then the
               routine returns with INFO = i. Otherwise, the factored form of A
               is used to estimate the condition number of the matrix A (see
               argument RCOND).  If the reciprocal of the condition number is
               less than machine precision, the routine still goes on to solve
               for X and compute error bounds as described below.

               4. The system of equations is solved for X using the factored form
               of A.

               5. By default (unless PARAMS(LA_LINRX_ITREF_I) is set to zero),
               the routine will use iterative refinement to try to get a small
               error and error bounds.  Refinement calculates the residual to at
               least twice the working precision.

               6. If equilibration was used, the matrix X is premultiplied by
               diag(R) so that it solves the original system before
               equilibration.

                Some optional parameters are bundled in the PARAMS array.  These
                settings determine how refinement is performed, but often the
                defaults are acceptable.  If the defaults are acceptable, users
                can pass NPARAMS = 0 which prevents the source code from accessing
                the PARAMS argument.

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>FACT</u>

                     FACT is CHARACTER*1
                Specifies whether or not the factored form of the matrix A is
                supplied on entry, and if not, whether the matrix A should be
                equilibrated before it is factored.
                  = 'F':  On entry, AF and IPIV contain the factored form of A.
                          If EQUED is not 'N', the matrix A has been
                          equilibrated with scaling factors given by S.
                          A, AF, and IPIV are not modified.
                  = 'N':  The matrix A will be copied to AF and factored.
                  = 'E':  The matrix A will be equilibrated if necessary, then
                          copied to AF and factored.

           <u>UPLO</u>

                     UPLO is CHARACTER*1
                  = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;
                  = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.

           <u>N</u>

                     N is INTEGER
                The number of linear equations, i.e., the order of the
                matrix A.  N &gt;= 0.

                     NRHS is INTEGER
                The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns
                of the matrices B and X.  NRHS &gt;= 0.

           <u>A</u>

                     A is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDA,N)
                The Hermitian matrix A.  If UPLO = 'U', the leading N-by-N
                upper triangular part of A contains the upper triangular
                part of the matrix A, and the strictly lower triangular
                part of A is not referenced.  If UPLO = 'L', the leading
                N-by-N lower triangular part of A contains the lower
                triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly upper
                triangular part of A is not referenced.

                On exit, if FACT = 'E' and EQUED = 'Y', A is overwritten by
                diag(S)*A*diag(S).

           <u>LDA</u>

                     LDA is INTEGER
                The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA &gt;= max(1,N).

           <u>AF</u>

                     AF is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDAF,N)
                If FACT = 'F', then AF is an input argument and on entry
                contains the block diagonal matrix D and the multipliers
                used to obtain the factor U or L from the factorization A =
                U*D*U**H or A = L*D*L**H as computed by ZHETRF.

                If FACT = 'N', then AF is an output argument and on exit
                returns the block diagonal matrix D and the multipliers
                used to obtain the factor U or L from the factorization A =
                U*D*U**H or A = L*D*L**H.

           <u>LDAF</u>

                     LDAF is INTEGER
                The leading dimension of the array AF.  LDAF &gt;= max(1,N).

           <u>IPIV</u>

                     IPIV is INTEGER array, dimension (N)
                If FACT = 'F', then IPIV is an input argument and on entry
                contains details of the interchanges and the block
                structure of D, as determined by ZHETRF.  If IPIV(k) &gt; 0,
                then rows and columns k and IPIV(k) were interchanged and
                D(k,k) is a 1-by-1 diagonal block.  If UPLO = 'U' and
                IPIV(k) = IPIV(k-1) &lt; 0, then rows and columns k-1 and
                -IPIV(k) were interchanged and D(k-1:k,k-1:k) is a 2-by-2
                diagonal block.  If UPLO = 'L' and IPIV(k) = IPIV(k+1) &lt; 0,
                then rows and columns k+1 and -IPIV(k) were interchanged
                and D(k:k+1,k:k+1) is a 2-by-2 diagonal block.

                If FACT = 'N', then IPIV is an output argument and on exit
                contains details of the interchanges and the block
                structure of D, as determined by ZHETRF.

           <u>EQUED</u>

                     EQUED is CHARACTER*1
                Specifies the form of equilibration that was done.
                  = 'N':  No equilibration (always true if FACT = 'N').
                  = 'Y':  Both row and column equilibration, i.e., A has been
                          replaced by diag(S) * A * diag(S).
                EQUED is an input argument if FACT = 'F'; otherwise, it is an
                output argument.

           <u>S</u>

                     S is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
                The scale factors for A.  If EQUED = 'Y', A is multiplied on
                the left and right by diag(S).  S is an input argument if FACT =
                'F'; otherwise, S is an output argument.  If FACT = 'F' and EQUED
                = 'Y', each element of S must be positive.  If S is output, each
                element of S is a power of the radix. If S is input, each element
                of S should be a power of the radix to ensure a reliable solution
                and error estimates. Scaling by powers of the radix does not cause
                rounding errors unless the result underflows or overflows.
                Rounding errors during scaling lead to refining with a matrix that
                is not equivalent to the input matrix, producing error estimates
                that may not be reliable.

           <u>B</u>

                     B is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
                On entry, the N-by-NRHS right hand side matrix B.
                On exit,
                if EQUED = 'N', B is not modified;
                if EQUED = 'Y', B is overwritten by diag(S)*B;

           <u>LDB</u>

                     LDB is INTEGER
                The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB &gt;= max(1,N).

           <u>X</u>

                     X is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDX,NRHS)
                If INFO = 0, the N-by-NRHS solution matrix X to the original
                system of equations.  Note that A and B are modified on exit if
                EQUED .ne. 'N', and the solution to the equilibrated system is
                inv(diag(S))*X.

           <u>LDX</u>

                     LDX is INTEGER
                The leading dimension of the array X.  LDX &gt;= max(1,N).

           <u>RCOND</u>

                     RCOND is DOUBLE PRECISION
                Reciprocal scaled condition number.  This is an estimate of the
                reciprocal Skeel condition number of the matrix A after
                equilibration (if done).  If this is less than the machine
                precision (in particular, if it is zero), the matrix is singular
                to working precision.  Note that the error may still be small even
                if this number is very small and the matrix appears ill-
                conditioned.

           <u>RPVGRW</u>

                     RPVGRW is DOUBLE PRECISION
                Reciprocal pivot growth.  On exit, this contains the reciprocal
                pivot growth factor norm(A)/norm(U). The 'max absolute element'
                norm is used.  If this is much less than 1, then the stability of
                the LU factorization of the (equilibrated) matrix A could be poor.
                This also means that the solution X, estimated condition numbers,
                and error bounds could be unreliable. If factorization fails with
                0&lt;INFO&lt;=N, then this contains the reciprocal pivot growth factor
                for the leading INFO columns of A.

           <u>BERR</u>

                     BERR is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (NRHS)
                Componentwise relative backward error.  This is the
                componentwise relative backward error of each solution vector X(j)
                (i.e., the smallest relative change in any element of A or B that
                makes X(j) an exact solution).

           <u>N_ERR_BNDS</u>

                     N_ERR_BNDS is INTEGER
                Number of error bounds to return for each right hand side
                and each type (normwise or componentwise).  See ERR_BNDS_NORM and
                ERR_BNDS_COMP below.

           <u>ERR_BNDS_NORM</u>

                     ERR_BNDS_NORM is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (NRHS, N_ERR_BNDS)
                For each right-hand side, this array contains information about
                various error bounds and condition numbers corresponding to the
                normwise relative error, which is defined as follows:

                Normwise relative error in the ith solution vector:
                        max_j (abs(XTRUE(j,i) - X(j,i)))
                       ------------------------------
                             max_j abs(X(j,i))

                The array is indexed by the type of error information as described
                below. There currently are up to three pieces of information
                returned.

                The first index in ERR_BNDS_NORM(i,:) corresponds to the ith
                right-hand side.

                The second index in ERR_BNDS_NORM(:,err) contains the following
                three fields:
                err = 1 'Trust/don't trust' boolean. Trust the answer if the
                         reciprocal condition number is less than the threshold
                         sqrt(n) * dlamch('Epsilon').

                err = 2 'Guaranteed' error bound: The estimated forward error,
                         almost certainly within a factor of 10 of the true error
                         so long as the next entry is greater than the threshold
                         sqrt(n) * dlamch('Epsilon'). This error bound should only
                         be trusted if the previous boolean is true.

                err = 3  Reciprocal condition number: Estimated normwise
                         reciprocal condition number.  Compared with the threshold
                         sqrt(n) * dlamch('Epsilon') to determine if the error
                         estimate is 'guaranteed'. These reciprocal condition
                         numbers are 1 / (norm(Z^{-1},inf) * norm(Z,inf)) for some
                         appropriately scaled matrix Z.
                         Let Z = S*A, where S scales each row by a power of the
                         radix so all absolute row sums of Z are approximately 1.

                See Lapack Working Note 165 for further details and extra
                cautions.

           <u>ERR_BNDS_COMP</u>

                     ERR_BNDS_COMP is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (NRHS, N_ERR_BNDS)
                For each right-hand side, this array contains information about
                various error bounds and condition numbers corresponding to the
                componentwise relative error, which is defined as follows:

                Componentwise relative error in the ith solution vector:
                               abs(XTRUE(j,i) - X(j,i))
                        max_j ----------------------
                                    abs(X(j,i))

                The array is indexed by the right-hand side i (on which the
                componentwise relative error depends), and the type of error
                information as described below. There currently are up to three
                pieces of information returned for each right-hand side. If
                componentwise accuracy is not requested (<a href="../man3/PARAMS.3.html">PARAMS</a>(3) = 0.0), then
                ERR_BNDS_COMP is not accessed.  If N_ERR_BNDS &lt; 3, then at most
                the first (:,N_ERR_BNDS) entries are returned.

                The first index in ERR_BNDS_COMP(i,:) corresponds to the ith
                right-hand side.

                The second index in ERR_BNDS_COMP(:,err) contains the following
                three fields:
                err = 1 'Trust/don't trust' boolean. Trust the answer if the

                         Let Z = S*(A*diag(x)), where x is the solution for the
                         current right-hand side and S scales each row of
                         A*diag(x) by a power of the radix so all absolute row
                         sums of Z are approximately 1.

           <u>NPARAMS</u>

                     NPARAMS is INTEGER
                Specifies the number of parameters set in PARAMS.  If &lt;= 0, the
                PARAMS array is never referenced and default values are used.

                     PARAMS is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension NPARAMS
                Specifies algorithm parameters.  If an entry is &lt; 0.0, then
                that entry will be filled with default value used for that
                parameter.  Only positions up to NPARAMS are accessed; defaults

        <b>ZSYSVXX</b> <b>computes</b> <b>the</b> <b>solution</b> <b>to</b> <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>linear</b> <b>equations</b> <b>A</b> <b>*</b> <b>X</b> <b>=</b> <b>B</b> <b>for</b> <b>SY</b> <b>matrices</b>

       <b>Purpose:</b>

               ZSYSVXX uses the diagonal pivoting factorization to compute the
               solution to a complex*16 system of linear equations A * X = B, where
               A is an N-by-N symmetric matrix and X and B are N-by-NRHS
               matrices.

               If requested, both normwise and maximum componentwise error bounds
               are returned. ZSYSVXX will return a solution with a tiny
               guaranteed error (O(eps) where eps is the working machine
               precision) unless the matrix is very ill-conditioned, in which
               case a warning is returned. Relevant condition numbers also are
               calculated and returned.

               ZSYSVXX accepts user-provided factorizations and equilibration
               factors; see the definitions of the FACT and EQUED options.
               Solving with refinement and using a factorization from a previous
               ZSYSVXX call will also produce a solution with either O(eps)
               errors or warnings, but we cannot make that claim for general
               user-provided factorizations and equilibration factors if they
               differ from what ZSYSVXX would itself produce.

       <b>Description:</b>

               The following steps are performed:

               1. If FACT = 'E', double precision scaling factors are computed to equilibrate
               the system:

                 diag(S)*A*diag(S)     *inv(diag(S))*X = diag(S)*B

               Whether or not the system will be equilibrated depends on the
               scaling of the matrix A, but if equilibration is used, A is
               overwritten by diag(S)*A*diag(S) and B by diag(S)*B.

               2. If FACT = 'N' or 'E', the LU decomposition is used to factor
               the matrix A (after equilibration if FACT = 'E') as

                  A = U * D * U**T,  if UPLO = 'U', or
                  A = L * D * L**T,  if UPLO = 'L',

               where U (or L) is a product of permutation and unit upper (lower)
               triangular matrices, and D is symmetric and block diagonal with
               1-by-1 and 2-by-2 diagonal blocks.

               3. If some D(i,i)=0, so that D is exactly singular, then the
               routine returns with INFO = i. Otherwise, the factored form of A
               is used to estimate the condition number of the matrix A (see
               argument RCOND).  If the reciprocal of the condition number is
               less than machine precision, the routine still goes on to solve
               for X and compute error bounds as described below.

               4. The system of equations is solved for X using the factored form
               of A.

               5. By default (unless PARAMS(LA_LINRX_ITREF_I) is set to zero),
               the routine will use iterative refinement to try to get a small
               error and error bounds.  Refinement calculates the residual to at
               least twice the working precision.

               6. If equilibration was used, the matrix X is premultiplied by
               diag(R) so that it solves the original system before
               equilibration.

                Some optional parameters are bundled in the PARAMS array.  These
                settings determine how refinement is performed, but often the
                defaults are acceptable.  If the defaults are acceptable, users
                can pass NPARAMS = 0 which prevents the source code from accessing
                the PARAMS argument.

                     FACT is CHARACTER*1

                     A is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDA,N)
                The symmetric matrix A.  If UPLO = 'U', the leading N-by-N
                upper triangular part of A contains the upper triangular
                part of the matrix A, and the strictly lower triangular
                part of A is not referenced.  If UPLO = 'L', the leading

                triangular part of A is not referenced.

                On exit, if FACT = 'E' and EQUED = 'Y', A is overwritten by

                     AF is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDAF,N)
                If FACT = 'F', then AF is an input argument and on entry
                contains the block diagonal matrix D and the multipliers
                used to obtain the factor U or L from the factorization A =
                U*D*U**T or A = L*D*L**T as computed by ZSYTRF.

                If FACT = 'N', then AF is an output argument and on exit

           <u>IPIV</u>

                     IPIV is INTEGER array, dimension (N)
                If FACT = 'F', then IPIV is an input argument and on entry
                contains details of the interchanges and the block
                structure of D, as determined by ZSYTRF.  If IPIV(k) &gt; 0,
                then rows and columns k and IPIV(k) were interchanged and
                D(k,k) is a 1-by-1 diagonal block.  If UPLO = 'U' and
                IPIV(k) = IPIV(k-1) &lt; 0, then rows and columns k-1 and
                -IPIV(k) were interchanged and D(k-1:k,k-1:k) is a 2-by-2
                diagonal block.  If UPLO = 'L' and IPIV(k) = IPIV(k+1) &lt; 0,
                then rows and columns k+1 and -IPIV(k) were interchanged
                and D(k:k+1,k:k+1) is a 2-by-2 diagonal block.

                If FACT = 'N', then IPIV is an output argument and on exit
                contains details of the interchanges and the block
                structure of D, as determined by ZSYTRF.

           <u>EQUED</u>

                     EQUED is CHARACTER*1
                Specifies the form of equilibration that was done.
                  = 'N':  No equilibration (always true if FACT = 'N').
                  = 'Y':  Both row and column equilibration, i.e., A has been
                          replaced by diag(S) * A * diag(S).
                EQUED is an input argument if FACT = 'F'; otherwise, it is an
                output argument.

           <u>S</u>

                     S is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
                The scale factors for A.  If EQUED = 'Y', A is multiplied on
                the left and right by diag(S).  S is an input argument if FACT =
                'F'; otherwise, S is an output argument.  If FACT = 'F' and EQUED
                = 'Y', each element of S must be positive.  If S is output, each
                element of S is a power of the radix. If S is input, each element
                of S should be a power of the radix to ensure a reliable solution
                and error estimates. Scaling by powers of the radix does not cause
                rounding errors unless the result underflows or overflows.
                Rounding errors during scaling lead to refining with a matrix that
                is not equivalent to the input matrix, producing error estimates
                that may not be reliable.

           <u>B</u>

                     B is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
                On entry, the N-by-NRHS right hand side matrix B.
                On exit,
                if EQUED = 'N', B is not modified;
                if EQUED = 'Y', B is overwritten by diag(S)*B;

           <u>LDB</u>

                     LDB is INTEGER
                The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB &gt;= max(1,N).

           <u>X</u>

                     X is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDX,NRHS)
                If INFO = 0, the N-by-NRHS solution matrix X to the original
                system of equations.  Note that A and B are modified on exit if
                EQUED .ne. 'N', and the solution to the equilibrated system is
                inv(diag(S))*X.

           <u>LDX</u>

                     LDX is INTEGER
                The leading dimension of the array X.  LDX &gt;= max(1,N).

           <u>RCOND</u>

                     RCOND is DOUBLE PRECISION
                Reciprocal scaled condition number.  This is an estimate of the
                reciprocal Skeel condition number of the matrix A after
                equilibration (if done).  If this is less than the machine
                precision (in particular, if it is zero), the matrix is singular
                to working precision.  Note that the error may still be small even
                if this number is very small and the matrix appears ill-
                conditioned.

           <u>RPVGRW</u>

                     RPVGRW is DOUBLE PRECISION
                Reciprocal pivot growth.  On exit, this contains the reciprocal
                pivot growth factor norm(A)/norm(U). The 'max absolute element'
                norm is used.  If this is much less than 1, then the stability of
                the LU factorization of the (equilibrated) matrix A could be poor.
                This also means that the solution X, estimated condition numbers,
                and error bounds could be unreliable. If factorization fails with
                0&lt;INFO&lt;=N, then this contains the reciprocal pivot growth factor
                for the leading INFO columns of A.

           <u>BERR</u>

                     BERR is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (NRHS)
                Componentwise relative backward error.  This is the
                componentwise relative backward error of each solution vector X(j)
                (i.e., the smallest relative change in any element of A or B that
                makes X(j) an exact solution).

           <u>N_ERR_BNDS</u>

                     N_ERR_BNDS is INTEGER
                Number of error bounds to return for each right hand side
                and each type (normwise or componentwise).  See ERR_BNDS_NORM and
                ERR_BNDS_COMP below.

           <u>ERR_BNDS_NORM</u>

                     ERR_BNDS_NORM is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (NRHS, N_ERR_BNDS)
                For each right-hand side, this array contains information about
                various error bounds and condition numbers corresponding to the
                normwise relative error, which is defined as follows:

                Normwise relative error in the ith solution vector:
                        max_j (abs(XTRUE(j,i) - X(j,i)))
                       ------------------------------
                             max_j abs(X(j,i))

                The array is indexed by the type of error information as described
                below. There currently are up to three pieces of information
                returned.

                The first index in ERR_BNDS_NORM(i,:) corresponds to the ith
                right-hand side.

                The second index in ERR_BNDS_NORM(:,err) contains the following
                three fields:
                err = 1 'Trust/don't trust' boolean. Trust the answer if the
                         reciprocal condition number is less than the threshold
                         sqrt(n) * dlamch('Epsilon').

                err = 2 'Guaranteed' error bound: The estimated forward error,
                         almost certainly within a factor of 10 of the true error
                         so long as the next entry is greater than the threshold
                         sqrt(n) * dlamch('Epsilon'). This error bound should only
                         be trusted if the previous boolean is true.

                err = 3  Reciprocal condition number: Estimated normwise
                         reciprocal condition number.  Compared with the threshold
                         sqrt(n) * dlamch('Epsilon') to determine if the error
                         estimate is 'guaranteed'. These reciprocal condition
                         numbers are 1 / (norm(Z^{-1},inf) * norm(Z,inf)) for some
                         appropriately scaled matrix Z.
                         Let Z = S*A, where S scales each row by a power of the
                         radix so all absolute row sums of Z are approximately 1.

                See Lapack Working Note 165 for further details and extra
                cautions.

           <u>ERR_BNDS_COMP</u>

                     ERR_BNDS_COMP is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (NRHS, N_ERR_BNDS)
                For each right-hand side, this array contains information about
                various error bounds and condition numbers corresponding to the
                componentwise relative error, which is defined as follows:

                Componentwise relative error in the ith solution vector:
                               abs(XTRUE(j,i) - X(j,i))
                        max_j ----------------------
                                    abs(X(j,i))

                The array is indexed by the right-hand side i (on which the
                componentwise relative error depends), and the type of error
                information as described below. There currently are up to three
                pieces of information returned for each right-hand side. If
                componentwise accuracy is not requested (<a href="../man3/PARAMS.3.html">PARAMS</a>(3) = 0.0), then
                ERR_BNDS_COMP is not accessed.  If N_ERR_BNDS &lt; 3, then at most
                the first (:,N_ERR_BNDS) entries are returned.

                The first index in ERR_BNDS_COMP(i,:) corresponds to the ith
                right-hand side.

                The second index in ERR_BNDS_COMP(:,err) contains the following

                         current right-hand side and S scales each row of
                         A*diag(x) by a power of the radix so all absolute row

           <u>NPARAMS</u>

                     NPARAMS is INTEGER
                Specifies the number of parameters set in PARAMS.  If &lt;= 0, the

                     PARAMS is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension NPARAMS
                Specifies algorithm parameters.  If an entry is &lt; 0.0, then
                that entry will be filled with default value used for that

                                err_bnds_norm and err_bnds_comp may no longer be
                                trustworthy.

                  PARAMS(LA_LINRX_CWISE_I = 3) : Flag determining if the code
                       will attempt to find a solution with small componentwise
                       relative error in the double-precision algorithm.  Positive
                       is true, 0.0 is false.
                    Default: 1.0 (attempt componentwise convergence)

           <u>WORK</u>

                     WORK is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (2*N)

           <u>RWORK</u>

                     RWORK is DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (2*N)

           <u>INFO</u>

                     INFO is INTEGER
                  = 0:  Successful exit. The solution to every right-hand side is
                    guaranteed.
                  &lt; 0:  If INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
                  &gt; 0 and &lt;= N:  U(INFO,INFO) is exactly zero.  The factorization
                    has been completed, but the factor U is exactly singular, so
                    the solution and error bounds could not be computed. RCOND = 0
                    is returned.
                  = N+J: The solution corresponding to the Jth right-hand side is
                    not guaranteed. The solutions corresponding to other right-
                    hand sides K with K &gt; J may not be guaranteed as well, but
                    only the first such right-hand side is reported. If a small
                    componentwise error is not requested (<a href="../man3/PARAMS.3.html">PARAMS</a>(3) = 0.0) then
                    the Jth right-hand side is the first with a normwise error
                    bound that is not guaranteed (the smallest J such
                    that ERR_BNDS_NORM(J,1) = 0.0). By default (<a href="../man3/PARAMS.3.html">PARAMS</a>(3) = 1.0)
                    the Jth right-hand side is the first with either a normwise or
                    componentwise error bound that is not guaranteed (the smallest
                    J such that either ERR_BNDS_NORM(J,1) = 0.0 or
                    ERR_BNDS_COMP(J,1) = 0.0). See the definition of
                    ERR_BNDS_NORM(:,1) and ERR_BNDS_COMP(:,1). To get information
                    about all of the right-hand sides check ERR_BNDS_NORM or
                    ERR_BNDS_COMP.
