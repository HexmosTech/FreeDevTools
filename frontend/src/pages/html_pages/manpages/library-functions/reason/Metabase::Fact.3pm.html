       Metabase::Fact - base class for Metabase Facts

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 0.025

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         # defining the fact class
         package MyFact;
         use Metabase::Fact::Hash;
         our @ISA = qw/Metabase::Fact::Hash/;

         my $fact = TestReport-&gt;new(
           resource   =&gt; 'RJBS/Metabase-Fact-0.001.tar.gz',
           content    =&gt; {
             status =&gt; 'FAIL',

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Metabase is a framework for associating content and metadata with arbitrary resources.  A Metabase can be
       used to store test reports, reviews, coverage analysis reports, reports on static analysis of coding
       style, or anything else for which datatypes are constructed.

       Metabase::Fact is a base class for Facts (really opinions or analyses) that can be sent to or retrieved
       from a Metabase repository.

   <b>Structure</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Fact</b> <b>object</b>
       A Fact object associates a "content" attribute with a "resource" attribute and a "creator" attribute.

       The "resource" attribute must be in a URI format that can be validated via a Metabase::Resource subclass.
       The "content" attribute is an opaque scalar with subclass-specific meaning.  The "creator" attribute is a
       URI with a "metabase:user" scheme and type (see Metabase::Resource::metabase).

       Facts have three sets of metadata associate with them.  Metadata are generally for use in indexing,
       searching and managing Facts.

       •   "core  metadata" describe universal properties of all Facts and are used to submit, store, manage and
           retrieve Facts within the Metabase framework.

       •   "resource metadata" describe index properties derived from the "resource" attribute.  (As  these  can
           be  regenerated from the "resource" -- which is part of "core metadata" -- they are not stored with a
           serialized Fact.)

       •   "content metadata" describe index properties derived from the "content" attribute.  (As these can  be
           regenerated  from  the  "content"  --  which is part of "core metadata" -- they are not stored with a
           serialized Fact.)

       Each of the three metadata sets has an  associated  accessor:  "core_metadata",  "resource_metadata"  and
       "content_metadata".

       Each  of  the  three  sets also has an accessor that returns a hashref with a data type for each possible
       element in the set: "core_metadata_types", "resource_metadata_types" and "content_metadata_types".

       Data types are loosely based on Data::RX.  For example:

         '//str'  -- indicates a value that should be compared stringwise
         '//num'  -- indicates a value that should be compared numerically
         '//bool' -- indicates a valut that is true or false

       When searching on metadata, you must join the set name  to  the  metadata  element  name  with  a  period
       character.  For example:

         core.guid
         core.creator
         core.resource
         resource.scheme
         content.size
         content.score

</pre><h4><b>ATTRIBUTES</b></h4><pre>
       Unless  otherwise  noted,  all  attributes  are  read-only  and  are  either provided as arguments to the
       constructor or are generated during construction.  All attributes (except "content")  are  also  part  of
       "core metadata".

   <b>Arguments</b> <b>provided</b> <b>to</b> <b>new</b>
       <u>content</u> <u>(required)</u>

       A  reference  to the actual information associated with the fact.  The exact form of the content is up to
       each Fact class to determine.

       <u>resource</u> <u>(required)</u>

       The  canonical  resource  (URI)  the  Fact  relates  to.   For  CPAN  distributions,  this  would  be   a
       "cpan:///distfile/..."  URI.   (See  URI::cpan.)   The  associated  accessor returns a Metabase::Resource
       subclass.

       <u>creator</u> <u>(optional)</u>

       A Metabase::User::Profile URI that indicates the creator of the Fact.  If not set during  Fact  creation,
       it  will  be  set  by  the  Metabase  when  a  Fact  is  submitted  based  on the submitter Profile.  The
       "set_creator" mutator may be called to set "creator",  but  only  if  it  is  not  previously  set.   The
       associated accessor returns a Metabase::Resource subclass or "undef" if the creator has not been set.

       <u>guid</u> <u>(optional)</u>

       The  Fact  object's  Globally  Unique  IDentifier.   This  is  generated  automatically  if not provided.
       Generally, users should not provide a "guid" argument, but it is permitted for use in special cases where
       a non-random "guid" is necessary.

   <b>Generated</b> <b>during</b> <b>construction</b>
       These attributes are generated automatically during the call to "new".

       <u>type</u>

       The class name, with double-colons converted to dashes to be more URI-friendly.   e.g.   "Metabase::Fact"
       would be "Metabase-Fact".

       <u>schema_version</u>

       The "schema_version" of the Fact subclass that created the object. This may or may not be the same as the
       current  "schema_version" of the class if newer versions of the class have been released since the object
       was created.

       <u>creation_time</u>

       Fact creation time in UTC expressed in extended ISO 8601 format with a "Z" (Zulu) suffix.  For example:

         2010-01-10T12:34:56Z

       <u>update_time</u>

       When the fact was created, stored or otherwise  updated,  expressed  an  ISO  8601  UTC  format  as  with
       "creation_time".   The  "touch" method may be called at any time to update the value to the current time.
       This attribute generally only has  local  significance  within  a  particular  Metabase  repository.  For
       example, it may be used to sort Facts by when they were stored or changed in a Metabase.

       <u>valid</u>

       A  boolean  value indicating whether the fact is considered valid.  It defaults to true.  The "set_valid"
       method may be called to change the "valid" property, for example, to mark  a  fact  invalid  rather  than
       deleting it.  The value of "valid" is always normalized to return "1" for true and "0" for false.

</pre><h4><b>CONSTRUCTOR</b></h4><pre>
   <b>new</b>
         $fact = MyFact-&gt;new(
           resource =&gt; 'AUTHORID/Foo-Bar-1.23.tar.gz',
           content =&gt; $content_structure,
         );

       Constructs  a new Fact. The "resource" and "content" attributes are required.  No other attributes should
       be provided to "new" except "creator".

</pre><h4><b>CLASS</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>type</b>
         $type = MyFact-&gt;type;

       The "type" accessor may also be called as a class method.

   <b>class_from_type</b>
         $class = MyFact-&gt;class_from_type( $type );

       A utility function to invert the operation of the "type" method.

   <b>upgrade_fact</b>
         MyFact-&gt;upgrade_fact( $struct );

       This method will be called when initializing a fact from a data structure that claims to be of  a  schema
       version other than the schema version reported by the loaded class's "default_schema_version" method.  It
       will  be  passed  the  hashref of args being used to initialized the fact object (generally the output of
       "as_struct" from an older version), and should alter that hash in place.

   <b>default_schema_version</b>
         $version = MyFact-&gt;default_schema_version;

       Defaults to 1.  Subclasses should override this method if they make a  backwards-incompatible  change  to
       the  internals  of  the  content  attribute.   Schema  version numbers should be monotonically-increasing
       integers.  The default schema version is used to set an objects schema_version attribution on creation.

</pre><h4><b>PERSISTENCE</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       The following methods are implemented by Metabase::Fact and  subclasses  generally  should  not  need  to
       override them.

   <b>save</b>
         $fact-&gt;save($filename);

       This method writes out the fact to a file in JSON format.  If the file cannot be written, an exception is
       raised.  If the save is successful, a true value is returned.  Internally, it calls "as_json".

   <b>load</b>
         my $fact = Metabase::Fact-&gt;load($filename);

       This  method  loads  a fact from a JSON format file and returns it.  If the file cannot be read or is not
       valid JSON, and exception is thrown.  Internally, it calls "from_json".

   <b>as_json</b>
       This returns a JSON string containing the serialized object.  Internally, it calls "as_struct".

   <b>from_json</b>
       This method regenerates a fact  from  a  JSON  string  generated  by  "as_json".   Internally,  it  calls
       "from_struct".

   <b>as_struct</b>
       This  returns  a simple data structure that represents the fact and can be used for transmission over the
       wire.  It serializes the content and core metadata, but not other metadata, which should be recomputed by
       the receiving end.

   <b>from_struct</b>
         my $fact = Metabase::Fact-&gt;from_struct( $struct );

       This takes the output of the "as_struct" method and reconstitutes a Fact object.  If the class the struct
       represents is not loaded, "from_struct" will attempt to load the class or will throw an error.

</pre><h4><b>OBJECT</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       The following methods are implemented by Metabase::Fact and  subclasses  generally  should  not  need  to
       override them.

   <b>core_metadata</b>
       This returns a hashref containing the fact's core metadata.  This includes things like the guid, creation
       time, described resource, and so on.

   <b>core_metadata_types</b>
       This returns a hashref of types for each core metadata element

   <b>resource_metadata</b>
       This method returns metadata describing the resource.

   <b>resource_metadata_types</b>
       This returns a hashref of types for each resource metadata element

   <b>set_creator</b>
         $fact-&gt;set_creator($profile_uri);

       This method sets the "creator" core metadata for the core metadata for the fact.  If the fact's "creator"
       is already set, an exception will be thrown.

   <b>set_valid</b>
         $fact-&gt;<a href="../man0/set_valid.0.html">set_valid</a>(0);

       This method sets the "valid" core metadata to a boolean value.

   <b>touch</b>
         $fact-&gt;touch

       This  method  sets the "update_time" core metadata for the core metadata for the fact to the current time
       in ISO 8601 UTC format with a trailing "Z" (Zulu) suffice.

</pre><h4><b>ABSTRACT</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       Methods marked as <u>required</u> must be implemented by a Fact subclass.  (The version in  Metabase::Fact  will
       die with an error if called.)

       In the documentation below, the terms <u>must</u>, <u>must</u> <u>not</u>, <u>should</u>, etc.  have their usual RFC 2119 meanings.

       These methods MUST throw an exception if an error occurs.

   <b>content_as_bytes</b>
       <b>required</b>

         $string = $fact-&gt;content_as_bytes;

       This  method  MUST  serialize  a  Fact's  content  as  bytes  in  a scalar and return it.  The method for
       serialization is up to the individual fact class to determine.  Some common subclasses are  available  to
       handle serialization for common data types.  See Metabase::Fact::Hash and Metabase::Fact::String.

   <b>content_from_bytes</b>
       <b>required</b>

         $content = $fact-&gt;content_from_bytes( $string );
         $content = $fact-&gt;content_from_bytes( \$string );

       Given  a  scalar,  this  method  MUST regenerate and return the original content data structure.  It MUST
       accept either a string or string reference as an argument.  It MUST  NOT  overwrite  the  Fact's  content
       attribute directly.

   <b>content_metadata</b>
       <b>optional</b>

         $content_meta = $fact-&gt;content_metadata;

       If  provided,  this  method MUST return a hash reference with content-specific indexing metadata. The key
       MUST be the name of the field for indexing and SHOULD provide dimensions  to  differentiate  one  set  of
       content from another.  Values MUST be simple scalars, not references.

       Here is a hypothetical example of "content_metadata" for an image fact:

         sub content_metadata {
           my $self = shift;
           return {
             width   =&gt; _compute_width  ( $self-&gt;content ),
             height  =&gt; _compute_height ( $self-&gt;content ),
             caption =&gt; _extract_caption( $self-&gt;content ),
           }
         }

       Field  names  should  be  valid  perl  identifiers, consisting of alphanumeric characters or underscores.
       Hyphens and periods are allowed, but are not recommended.

   <b>content_metadata_types</b>
       <b>optional</b>

         my $typemap = $fact-&gt;content_metadata_types;

       This  method  is  used  to  identify  the  datatypes  of  keys  in  the  data   structure   provided   by
       "content_metadata".  If provided, it MUST return a hash reference.  It SHOULD contain a key for every key
       that could appear in the data structure generated by "content_metadata" and provide a value corresponding
       to  a  datatype  for  each  key.   It  MAY  contain  keys  that  do  not  always  appear in the result of
       "content_metadata".

       Data types are loosely based on Data::RX.  Type SHOULD be one of the following:

         '//str' -- indicates a value that should be compared stringwise
         '//num' -- indicates a value that should be compared numerically
         '//bool' -- indicates a boolean value where "1" is true and "0" is false

       Here is a hypothetical example of "content_metadata_types" for an image fact:

         sub content_metadata_types {
           return {
             width   =&gt; '//num',
             height  =&gt; '//num',
             caption =&gt; '//str',
           }
         }

       Consumers of "content_metadata_types" SHOULD assume that any "content_metadata"  key  not  found  in  the
       result of "content_metadata_types" is a '//str' resource.

   <b>validate_content</b>
       <b>required</b>

        eval { $fact-&gt;validate_content };

       This  method SHOULD check for the validity of content within the Fact.  It MUST throw an exception if the
       fact content is invalid.  (The return value is ignored.)

   <b>validate_resource</b>
       <b>optional</b>

        eval { $fact-&gt;validate_resource };

       This method SHOULD check whether the resource type is relevant for the  Fact  subclass.   It  SHOULD  use
       Metabase::Resource to create a resource object and evaluate the resource object scheme and type.  It MUST
       throw an exception if the resource type is invalid.  Otherwise, it MUST return a valid Metabase::Resource
       subclass.  For example:

         sub validate_resource {
           my ($self) = @_;
           # Metabase::Resource-&gt;new dies if invalid
           my $obj = Metabase::Resource-&gt;new($self-&gt;resource);
           if ($obj-&gt;scheme eq 'cpan' &amp;&amp; $obj-&gt;type eq 'distfile') {
             return $obj;
           }
           else {
             my $fact_type = $self-&gt;type;
             Carp::confess("'$resource' does not apply to '$fact_type'");
           }
         }

       The default "validate_resource" accepts any resource that can initialize a "Metabase::Resource" object.
