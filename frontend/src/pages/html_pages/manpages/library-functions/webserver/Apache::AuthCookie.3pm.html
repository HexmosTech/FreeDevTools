</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Apache::AuthCookie</b> allows you to intercept a user's first unauthenticated access to a protected document.
       The user will be presented with a custom form where they can enter authentication credentials. The
       credentials are posted to the server where AuthCookie verifies them and returns a session key.

       The session key is returned to the user's browser as a cookie. As a cookie, the browser will pass the
       session key on every subsequent accesses. AuthCookie will verify the session key and re-authenticate the
       user.

       All you have to do is write a custom module that inherits from AuthCookie.  Your module is a class which
       implements two methods:

       authen_cred()
           Verify  the  user-supplied credentials and return a session key.  The session key can be any string -
           often you'll use some string containing username, timeout info, and any other information you need to
           determine access to documents, and append a one-way hash of those values together  with  some  secret
           key.

       authen_ses_key()
           Verify  the  session  key (previously generated by authen_cred(), possibly during a previous request)
           and return the user ID.  This user ID will be fed to "$r-&gt;connection-&gt;user()" to set Apache's idea of
           who's logged in.

       By using AuthCookie versus Apache's built-in AuthBasic you can design  your  own  authentication  system.
       There are several benefits.

       1.  The  client  doesn't *have* to pass the user credentials on every subsequent access.  If you're using
           passwords, this means that the password can be  sent  on  the  first  request  only,  and  subsequent
           requests  don't  need  to  send  this (potentially sensitive) information.  This is known as "ticket-
           based" authentication.

       2.  When you determine that the client should stop using the credentials/session key, the server can tell
           the client to delete the cookie.  Letting  users  "log  out"  is  a  notoriously  impossible-to-solve
           problem of AuthBasic.

       3.  AuthBasic dialog boxes are ugly.  You can design your own HTML login forms when you use AuthCookie.

       4.  You  can specify the domain of a cookie using PerlSetVar commands.  For instance, if your AuthName is
           "WhatEver", you can put the command

            PerlSetVar WhatEverDomain .yourhost.com

           into your server setup file and your access cookies will span all hosts ending in ".yourhost.com".

       5.  You can optionally specify the name of your cookie using the "CookieName" directive.   For  instance,
           if your AuthName is "WhatEver", you can put the command

            PerlSetVar WhatEverCookieName MyCustomName

           into  your  server  setup file and your cookies for this AuthCookie realm will be named MyCustomName.
           Default is AuthType_AuthName.

       6.  By default users must satisfy ALL of the "require" directives.  If you want authentication to succeed
           if ANY "require" directives are met, use the "Satisfy" directive.  For instance, if your AuthName  is
           "WhatEver", you can put the command

            PerlSetVar WhatEverSatisfy Any

           into  your server startup file and authentication for this realm will succeed if ANY of the "require"
           directives are met.

       This is the flow of the authentication handler, less the details of the  redirects.  Two  REDIRECT's  are
       used  to  keep the client from displaying the user's credentials in the Location field. They don't really
       change AuthCookie's model, but they do add another round-trip request to the client.

                (---------------------)

        *  The session key that the client gets can be anything you want.  For
           example, encrypted information about the user, a hash of the
           username and password (similar in function to Digest
           authentication), or the user name and password in plain text
           (similar in function to HTTP Basic authentication).

           The only requirement is that the authen_ses_key function that you
           create must be able to determine if this session_key is valid and
           map it back to the originally authenticated user ID.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>authen_cred($r,</b> <b>@credentials)</b>
       You must define this method yourself in your subclass of "Apache::AuthCookie".  Its job is to create  the
       session key that will be preserved in the user's cookie.  The arguments passed to it are:

        sub authen_cred ($$\@) {
          my $self = shift;  # Package name (same as AuthName directive)
          my $r    = shift;  # Apache request object
          my @cred = @_;     # Credentials from login form

          ...blah blah blah, create a session key...
          return $session_key;
        }

       The  only  limitation on the session key is that you should be able to look at it later and determine the
       user's username.  You are responsible for implementing your own session key format.  A typical format  is
       to  make a string that contains the username, an expiration time, whatever else you need, and an MD5 hash
       of all that data together with a secret key.  The hash will ensure that the user doesn't tamper with  the
       session key.  More info in the Eagle book.

   <b>authen_ses_key($r,</b> <b>$session_key)</b>
       You  must  define  this  method yourself in your subclass of Apache::AuthCookie.  Its job is to look at a
       session key and determine whether it is valid.  If so, it returns the username of the authenticated user.

        sub authen_ses_key ($$$) {
          my ($self, $r, $session_key) = @_;
          ...blah blah blah, check whether $session_key is valid...
          return $ok ? $username : undef;
        }

       Optionally, return an array of 2 or more items that will be passed to method  custom_errors.  It  is  the
       responsibility of this method to return the correct response to the main Apache module.

   <b>custom_errors($r,@_)</b>
       Note: this interface is experimental.

       This  method  handles  the server response when you wish to access the Apache custom_response method. Any
       suitable response can be used. this is  particularly  useful  when  implementing  'by  directory'  access
       control using the user authentication information. i.e.

               /restricted
                       /one            user is allowed access here
                       /two            not here
                       /three          AND here

       The  authen_ses_key  method  would  return  a  normal  response when the user attempts to access 'one' or
       'three' but return (NOT_FOUND, 'File not found') if an attempt was made to access subdirectory 'two'. Or,
       in the case of expired credentials, (AUTH_REQUIRED,'Your session has timed out, you must login again').

         example 'custom_errors'

         sub custom_errors {
           my ($self,$r,$CODE,$msg) = @_;
           # return custom message else use the server's standard message
           $r-&gt;custom_response($CODE, $msg) if $msg;
           return($CODE);
         }

         where CODE is a valid code from Apache::Constants

   <b>recognize_user($r)</b>
       If the user has provided a valid session key but the document  isn't  protected,  this  method  will  set
       "$r-&gt;connection-&gt;user" anyway.  Use it as a PerlFixupHandler, unless you have a better idea.

   <b>encoding($r):</b> <b>string</b>
       Return the ${auth_name}Encoding setting that is in effect for this request.

   <b>requires_encoding($r):</b> <b>string</b>
       Return the ${auth_name}RequiresEncoding setting that is in effect for this request.

   <b>decoded_user($r):</b> <b>string</b>
       If you have set ${auth_name}Encoding, then this will return the decoded value of "$r-&gt;connection-&gt;user".

   <b>decoded_requires($r):</b> <b>arrayref</b>
       This   method   returns   the   "$r-&gt;requires"   array,   with   the   "requirement"  values  decoded  if
       "${auth_name}RequiresEncoding" is in effect for this request.

   <b>handle_cache():</b> <b>void</b>
       If "${auth_name}Cache" is defined, this sets up the response so  that  the  client  will  not  cache  the
       result.  This sents "no_cache" in the apache request object and sends the appropriate headers so that the
       client will not cache the response.

   <b>remove_cookie():</b> <b>void</b>
       Adds a "Set-Cookie" header that instructs the client to delete the cookie immediately.

   <b>params($r):</b> <b>Apache::AuthCookie::Params</b>
       Get the params object for this request.

   <b>login($r)</b>
       This  method handles the submission of the login form.  It will call the authen_cred() method, passing it
       $r and all the submitted data with names like "credential_#", where # is a number.  These will be  passed
       in   a  simple  array,  so  the  prototype  is  "$self-&gt;authen_cred($r,  @credentials)".   After  calling
       authen_cred(), we set the user's cookie and redirect to the URL contained in the "destination"  submitted
       form field.

   <b>untaint_destination($uri)</b>
       This method returns a modified version of the destination parameter before embedding it into the response
       header.  Per  default  it escapes CR, LF and TAB characters of the uri to avoid certain types of security
       attacks. You can override it to more limit the allowed destinations, e.g., only allow relative uris, only
       special hosts or only limited set of characters.

   <b>logout($r)</b>
       This is simply a convenience method that unsets the session key for you.  You can call it in your  logout
       scripts.  Usually this looks like "$r-&gt;auth_type-&gt;logout($r);".

   <b>authenticate($r)</b>
       This   method   is   one  you'll  use  in  a  server  config  file  (httpd.conf,  .htaccess,  ...)  as  a
       PerlAuthenHandler.  If the user provided a session key in a cookie, the authen_ses_key() method will  get
       called  to  check  whether  the key is valid.  If not, or if there is no key provided, we redirect to the
       login form.

   <b>login_form()</b>
       This method is responsible for displaying the  login  form.  The  default  implementation  will  make  an
       internal   redirect  and  display  the  URL  you  specified  with  the  "PerlSetVar  WhatEverLoginScript"
       configuration directive. You can overwrite this method to provide your own mechanism.

   <b>login_form_status($r)</b>
       This method returns the HTTP status code that will be returned with the login form response.  The default
       behaviour is to return FORBIDDEN, except for some known browsers which ignore HTML content for  FORBIDDEN
       responses (e.g.: SymbianOS).  You can override this method to return custom codes.

       Note  that  FORBIDDEN  is the most correct code to return as the given request was not authorized to view
       the requested page.  You should only change this if FORBIDDEN does not work.

   <b>get_satisfy():</b> <b>string</b>
       Get the "Satisfy" value for the current request, or "all" if it is not configured.

   <b>authorize($r)</b>
       This will step through the "require" directives you've given for protected documents and  make  sure  the
       user  passes  muster.   The  "require valid-user" and "require user joey-jojo" directives are handled for
       you.  You can implement custom directives, such as "require species hamster", by defining a method called
       species() in your subclass, which will then be called.  The method will  be  called  as  "$r-&gt;species($r,
       $args)",  where  $args  is everything on your "require" line after the word "species".  The method should
       return OK on success and FORBIDDEN on failure.

   <b>send_cookie($session_key)</b>
       By default this method simply sends out the session key you give it.  If you need to change  the  default
       behavior (perhaps to update a timestamp in the key) you can override this method.

   <b>send_p3p():</b> <b>void</b>
       Set  a P3P response header if "${auth_name}P3P" is configured.  The value of the header is whatever is in
       the "${auth_name}P3P" setting.

   <b>cookie_string(%args):</b> <b>string</b>
       Generate a cookie string. %args are:

       •   request

           The Apache request object

       •   key

           The Cookie name

       •   value

           the Cookie value

       •   expires (optional)

           When the cookie expires. See "<b>expires()</b>" in Apache::AuthCookie::Util.  Uses "${auth_name}Expires"  if
           not given.

       All other cookie settings come from "PerlSetVar" settings.

   <b>key()</b>
       This  method  will  return  the  current  session  key,  if  any.  This can be handy inside a method that
       implements a "require" directive check (like the "species" method discussed above) if you put  any  extra
       information like clearances or whatever into the session key.

   <b>get_cookie_path():</b> <b>string</b>
       Returns the value of "PerlSetVar ${auth_name}Path".

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       For  an  example  of  how to use Apache::AuthCookie, you may want to check out the test suite, which runs
       AuthCookie through a few of its paces.  The documents are located in t/eg/, and you may  want  to  peruse
       t/real.t  to see the generated httpd.conf file (at the bottom of real.t) and check out what requests it's
       making of the server (at the top of real.t).

</pre><h4><b>THE</b> <b>LOGIN</b> <b>SCRIPT</b></h4><pre>
       You will need to create a login script (called login.pl above) that generates an HTML form for  the  user
       to  fill out.  You might generate the page using an Apache::Registry script, or an HTML::Mason component,
       or perhaps even using a static HTML page.  It's usually useful to generate it dynamically so that you can
       define the 'destination' field correctly (see below).

       The following fields must be present in the form:

       1.  The ACTION of the form must be /LOGIN (or whatever  you  defined  in  your  server  configuration  as
           handled by the -&gt;<b>login()</b> method - see example in the SYNOPSIS section).

       2.  The   various   user   input  fields  (username,  passwords,  etc.)  must  be  named  'credential_0',
           'credential_1', etc. on the form.  These will get passed to your <b>authen_cred()</b> method.

       3.  You must define a form field called 'destination' that tells AuthCookie where to redirect the request
           after successfully logging in.  Typically this value  is  obtained  from  "$r-&gt;prev-&gt;uri".   See  the
           login.pl script in t/eg/.

       In addition, you might want your login page to be able to tell why the user is being asked to log in.  In
       other words, if the user sent bad credentials, then it might be useful to display an error message saying
       that  the  given  username or password are invalid.  Also, it might be useful to determine the difference
       between a user that sent an invalid auth cookie, and a user that sent no auth cookie  at  all.   To  cope
       with  these  situations,  <b>AuthCookie</b>  will  set  "$r-&gt;subprocess_env('AuthCookieReason')"  to  one of the
       following values.

       <u>no_cookie</u>
           The user presented no cookie at all.  Typically this means the user is trying to log in for the first
           time.

       <u>bad_cookie</u>
           The cookie the user presented is invalid.  Typically this means that the user is not  allowed  access
           to the given page.

       <u>bad_credentials</u>
           The user tried to log in, but the credentials that were passed are invalid.

       You can examine this value in your login form by examining "$r-&gt;prev-&gt;subprocess_env('AuthCookieReason')"
       (because it's a sub-request).

       Of  course,  if  you  want  to  give  more  specific information about why access failed when a cookie is
       present, your authen_ses_key() method can set arbitrary entries in "$r-&gt;subprocess_env".

</pre><h4><b>THE</b> <b>LOGOUT</b> <b>SCRIPT</b></h4><pre>
       If you want to let users log themselves out (something that can't be done using Basic Auth), you need  to
       create  a  logout  script.  For an example, see t/htdocs/docs/logout.pl.  Logout scripts may want to take
       advantage of AuthCookie's logout() method, which will set the proper cookie headers in order to clear the
       user's cookie.  This usually looks like "$r-&gt;auth_type-&gt;logout($r);".

       Note that if you don't necessarily trust your users, you can't count on cookie deletion for logging  out.
       You'll  have  to  expire some server-side login information too.  AuthCookie doesn't do this for you, you
       have to handle it yourself.

</pre><h4><b>ENCODING</b> <b>AND</b> <b>CHARACTER</b> <b>SETS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Encoding</b>
       AuthCookie provides support for decoding POST/GET data if you tell it what the client encoding  is.   You
       do this by setting the "${auth_name}Encoding" setting in "httpd.conf".  E.g.:

        PerlSetVar WhateEverEncoding UTF-8
        # and you also need to arrange for charset=UTF-8 at the end of the
        # Content-Type header with something like:
        AddDefaultCharset UTF-8

       Note  that  you <b>can</b> use charsets other than "UTF-8", however, you need to arrange for the browser to send
       the right encoding back to the server.

       If you have turned on Encoding support by setting "${auth_name}Encoding", this has the following effects:

       •   The internal pure-perl params processing subclass will  be  used,  even  if  libapreq  is  installed.
           libapreq does not handle encoding.

       •   POST/GET  data  intercepted by AuthCookie will be decoded to perl's internal format using "decode" in
           Encode.

       •   The value stored in "$r-&gt;connection-&gt;user" will  be  encoded  as  <b>bytes</b>,  not  characters  using  the
           configured  encoding name.  This is because the value stored by mod_perl is a C API string, and not a
           perl string.  You can use "<b>decoded_user()</b>" to get user string encoded using <b>character</b> semantics.

       This does has some caveats:

       •   your "<b>authen_cred()</b>" and "<b>authen_ses_key()</b>" function is expected to return a decoded username, either
           by passing it through "<b>decode()</b>" in Encode, or, by turning on the UTF8 flag if appropriate.

       •   Due to the way HTTP works, cookies cannot contain non-ASCII characters.  Because of this, if you  are
           including  the  username  in  your  generated  session  key,  you  will  need to escape any non-ascii
           characters in the session key returned by "<b>authen_cred()</b>".

       •   Similarly, you must reverse this escaping process in "<b>authen_ses_key()</b>" and return  a  "<b>decode()</b>"  in
           Encode  decoded username.  If your "<b>authen_cred()</b>" function already only generates ASCII-only session
           keys then you do not need to worry about any of this.

       •   The value stored in "$r-&gt;connection-&gt;user" will be encoded using bytes semantics using the configured
           <b>Encoding</b>.  If you want the decoded user value, use "<b>decoded_user()</b>" instead.

   <b>Requires</b>
       You  can  also  specify  what  the  charset  is  of  the  Apache  "$r-&gt;requires"  data  is   by   setting
       "${auth_name}RequiresEncoding" in httpd.conf.

       E.g.:

        PerlSetVar WhatEverRequiresEncoding UTF-8

       This  will  make  it  so  that  AuthCookie  will  decode  your "requires" directives using the configured
       character set.  You really only need to do this if you have used non-ascii  characters  in  any  of  your
       "requires" directives in httpd.conf.  e.g.:

        requires user programmør

</pre><h4><b>ABOUT</b> <b>SESSION</b> <b>KEYS</b></h4><pre>
       Unlike  the sample AuthCookieHandler, you have you verify the user's login and password in authen_cred(),
       then you do something like:

           my $date = localtime;
           my $ses_key = MD5-&gt;hexhash(join(';', $date, $PID, $PAC));

       save $ses_key along with the user's login, and return $ses_key.

       Now authen_ses_key() looks up the $ses_key passed to it and returns the saved login.   I  use  Oracle  to
       store the session key and retrieve it later, see the ToDo section below for some other ideas.

   <b>TO</b> <b>DO</b>
       •   It  might  be  nice  if  the  logout  method  could accept some parameters that could make it easy to
           redirect the user to another URI, or whatever.  I'd have to think about the options needed  before  I
           implement anything, though.
