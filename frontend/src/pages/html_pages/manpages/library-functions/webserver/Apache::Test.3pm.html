</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Apache::Test - Test.pm wrapper with helpers for testing Apache

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Apache::Test;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Apache::Test</b> is a wrapper around the standard "Test.pm" with helpers for testing an Apache server.

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       plan
           This function is a wrapper around "Test::plan":

               plan tests =&gt; 3;

           just like using Test.pm, plan 3 tests.

           If  the first argument is an object, such as an "Apache::RequestRec" object, "STDOUT" will be tied to
           it. The "Test.pm" global state will also be refreshed by calling "Apache::Test::test_pm_refresh". For
           example:

               plan $r, tests =&gt; 7;

           ties STDOUT to the request object $r.

           If there is a last argument that doesn't belong to "Test::plan" (which expects a balanced hash), it's
           used to decide whether to continue with the test or to skip it all-together. This last  argument  can
           be:

           •   a "SCALAR"

               the test is skipped if the scalar has a false value. For example:

                 plan tests =&gt; 5, 0;

               But this won't hint the reason for skipping therefore it's better to use <b>need()</b>:

                 plan tests =&gt; 5,
                     need 'LWP',
                          { "not Win32" =&gt; sub { $^O eq 'MSWin32'} };

               see need() for more info.

           •   an "ARRAY" reference

               <b>need_module()</b>  is  called  for  each  value  in  this array. The test is skipped if <b>need_module()</b>
               returns false (which happens when at least one C or Perl module from the list cannot be found).

               Watch out for case insensitive file systems or duplicate modules with the same  name.   I.E.   If
               you mean mod_env.c
                  need_module('mod_env.c') Not
                  need_module('env')

           •   a "CODE" reference

               the tests will be skipped if the function returns a false value. For example:

                   plan tests =&gt; 5, need_lwp;

               the test will be skipped if LWP is not available

           All other arguments are passed through to <u>Test::plan</u> as is.

       ok  Same as <u>Test::ok</u>, see <u>Test.pm</u> documentation.

       sok Allows  one  to  skip  a sub-test, controlled from the command line.  The argument to <b>sok()</b> is a CODE
           reference or a BLOCK whose return value will be passed to <b>ok()</b>. By default behaves like <b>ok()</b>. If  all
           sub-tests of the same test are written using <b>sok()</b>, and a test is executed as:

             % ./t/TEST -v skip_subtest 1 3

           only sub-tests 1 and 3 will be run, the rest will be skipped.

       skip
           Same as <u>Test::skip</u>, see <u>Test.pm</u> documentation.

       test_pm_refresh
           Normally  called  by  <u>Apache::Test::plan</u>,  this  function will refresh the global state maintained by
           <u>Test.pm</u>, allowing "plan" and friends to be called more than once per-process.  This function  is  not
           exported.

       Functions  that  can  be  used  as  a  last argument to the extended <b>plan()</b>.  Note that for each "need_*"
       function there is a "have_*" equivalent that performs the exact same function except that it is  designed
       to  be  used  outside of plan().  "need_*" functions have the side effect of generating skip messages, if
       the test is skipped.  "have_*" functions don't have this side effect.  In other words, use  need_apache()
       with plan() to decide whether a test will run, but have_apache() within test logic to adjust expectations
       based on older or newer server versions.

       need_http11
             plan tests =&gt; 5, need_http11;

       need_cache_disk
             plan tests =&gt; 5, need_cache_disk

           Requires mod_cache_disk or mod_disk_cache to be installed.

       need_php
             plan tests =&gt; 5, need_php;

           Requires a PHP module to be installed (version 4 or 5).

       need_php4
             plan tests =&gt; 5, need_php4;

           Requires a PHP version 4 module to be installed.

       need_imagemap
             plan tests =&gt; 5, need_imagemap;

           Requires a mod_imagemap or mod_imap be installed

       need_apache
             plan tests =&gt; 5, need_apache 2;

           Requires Apache 2nd generation httpd-2.x.xx

             plan tests =&gt; 5, need_apache 1;

           Requires Apache 1st generation (apache-1.3.xx)

           See also need_min_apache_version().

       need_min_apache_version
           Used to require a minimum version of Apache.

           For example:

             plan tests =&gt; 5, need_min_apache_version("2.0.40");

           requires Apache 2.0.40 or higher.

       need_apache_version
           Used to require a specific version of Apache.

           For example:

             plan tests =&gt; 5, need_apache_version("2.0.40");

           requires Apache 2.0.40.

       need_min_apache_fix
           Used to require a particular micro version from corresponding minor release

           For example:

             plan tests =&gt; 5, need_min_apache_fix("2.0.40", "2.2.30", "2.4.18");

           requires Apache 2.0.40 or higher.

       need_apache_mpm
           Used to require a specific Apache Multi-Processing Module.

           For example:

             plan tests =&gt; 5, need_apache_mpm('prefork');

           requires the prefork MPM.

       need_perl
             plan tests =&gt; 5, need_perl 'iolayers';
             plan tests =&gt; 5, need_perl 'ithreads';

           Requires a perl extension to be present, or perl compiled with certain capabilities.

           The first example tests whether "PerlIO" is available, the second whether:

             $Config{useithread} eq 'define';

       need_min_perl_version
           Used to require a minimum version of Perl.

           For example:

             plan tests =&gt; 5, need_min_perl_version("5.008001");

           requires Perl 5.8.1 or higher.

       need_fork
           Requires the perl built-in function "fork" to be implemented.

       need_module
             plan tests =&gt; 5, need_module 'CGI';
             plan tests =&gt; 5, need_module qw(CGI Find::File);
             plan tests =&gt; 5, need_module ['CGI', 'Find::File', 'cgid'];

           Requires Apache C and Perl modules. The function accept a list of arguments or a reference to a list.

           In  case  of C modules, depending on how the module name was passed it may pass through the following
           completions:

           1 need_module 'proxy_http.c'
               If there is the <u>.c</u> extension, the module name will be looked up as is, i.e. <u>'proxy_http.c'</u>.

           2 need_module 'mod_cgi'
               The <u>.c</u> extension will be appended before the lookup, turning it into <u>'mod_cgi.c'</u>.

           3 need_module 'cgi'
               The <u>.c</u> extension and <u>mod</u><b>_</b> prefix will be added before the lookup, turning it into <u>'mod_cgi.c'</u>.

       need_min_module_version
           Used to require a minimum version of a module

           For example:

             plan tests =&gt; 5, need_min_module_version(CGI =&gt; 2.81);

           requires "CGI.pm" version 2.81 or higher.

           Currently works only for perl modules.

       need
             plan tests =&gt; 5,
                 need 'LWP',
                      { "perl &gt;= 5.8.0 and w/ithreads is required" =&gt;
                        ($Config{useperlio} &amp;&amp; $] &gt;= 5.008) },
                      { "not Win32"                 =&gt; sub { $^O eq 'MSWin32' },
                        "foo is disabled"           =&gt; \&amp;is_foo_enabled,
                      },
                      'cgid';

           <b>need()</b> is more generic function which can impose multiple requirements at once. All requirements must
           be satisfied.

           <b>need()</b>'s argument is a list of things to test. The list can include  scalars,  which  are  passed  to
           <b>need_module()</b>,  and hash references. If hash references are used, the keys, are strings, containing a
           reason for a failure to satisfy this particular entry,  the  values  are  the  condition,  which  are
           satisfaction  if they return true. If the value is 0 or 1, it used to decide whether the requirements
           very satisfied, so you can mix special "need_*()" functions that return 0 or 1. For example:

             plan tests =&gt; 1, need 'Compress::Zlib', 'deflate',
                 need_min_apache_version("2.0.49");

           If the scalar value is a string, different from 0 or 1, it's passed to <u><b>need_module()</b></u>.  If  the  value
           is  a code reference, it gets executed at the time of check and its return value is used to check the
           condition. If the condition check fails, the provided (in a key) reason is used to tell user why  the
           test was skipped.

           In  the  presented example, we require the presence of the "LWP" Perl module, "mod_cgid", that we run
           under perl &gt;= 5.7.3 on Win32.

           It's possible to put more than one requirement into a single hash reference, but be careful that  the
           keys will be different.

           It's also important to mention to avoid using:

             plan tests =&gt; 1, requirement1 &amp;&amp; requirement2;

           technique. While test-wise that technique is equivalent to:

             plan tests =&gt; 1, need requirement1, requirement2;

           since  the  test will be skipped, unless all the rules are satisfied, it's not equivalent for the end
           users. The second technique, deploying need() and  a  list  of  requirements,  always  runs  all  the
           requirement  checks  and reports all the missing requirements. In the case of the first technique, if
           the first requirement fails, the second is not run, and the missing requirement is not  reported.  So
           let's  say  all the requirements are missing Apache modules, and a user wants to satisfy all of these
           and run the test suite again. If all the unsatisfied requirements are reported at once, she will need
           to rebuild Apache once. If only one requirement is reported at a  time,  she  will  have  to  rebuild
           Apache as many times as there are elements in the "&amp;&amp;" statement.

           Also see <b>plan()</b>.

       under_construction
             plan tests =&gt; 5, under_construction;

           skip all tests, noting that the tests are under construction

       skip_reason
             plan tests =&gt; 5, skip_reason('my custom reason');

           skip  all  tests.   the reason you specify will be given at runtime.  if no reason is given a default
           reason will be used.

</pre><h4><b>Additional</b> <b>Configuration</b> <b>Variables</b></h4><pre>
           basic_config
                 my $basic_cfg = Apache::Test::basic_config();
                 $basic_cfg-&gt;write_perlscript($file, $content);

               basic_config() is similar to config(), but doesn't contain  any  httpd-specific  information  and
               should be used for operations that don't require any httpd-specific knowledge.

           config
                 my $cfg = Apache::Test::config();
                 my $server_rev = $cfg-&gt;{server}-&gt;{rev};
                 ...

               config() gives an access to the configuration object.

           vars
                 my $serverroot = Apache::Test::vars-&gt;{serverroot};
                 my $serverroot = Apache::Test::vars('serverroot');
                 my($top_dir, $t_dir) = Apache::Test::vars(qw(top_dir t_dir));

               vars() gives an access to the configuration variables, otherwise accessible as:

                 $vars = Apache::Test::config()-&gt;{vars};

               If  no  arguments  are  passed,  the  reference to the variables hash is returned. If one or more
               arguments are passed the corresponding values are returned.

</pre><h4><b>Test::More</b> <b>Integration</b></h4><pre>
       There are a few caveats if you want to use <u>Apache::Test</u> with  <u>Test::More</u>  instead  of  the  default  <u>Test</u>
       backend.   The  first is that <u>Test::More</u> requires you to use its own plan() function and not the one that
       ships with <u>Apache::Test</u>.  <u>Test::More</u> also defines ok() and  skip()  functions  that  are  different,  and
       simply "use"ing both modules in your test script will lead to redefined warnings for these subroutines.

       To assist <u>Test::More</u> users we have created a special <u>Apache::Test</u> import tag, ":withtestmore", which will
       export  all  of  the  standard <u>Apache::Test</u> symbols into your namespace except the ones that collide with
       <u>Test::More</u>.

           use Apache::Test qw(:withtestmore);
           use Test::More;

           plan tests =&gt; 1;           # Test::More::plan()

           ok ('yes', 'testing ok');  # Test::More::ok()

       Now, while this works fine for standard client-side  tests  (such  as  "t/basic.t"),  the  more  advanced
       features of <u>Apache::Test</u> require using <u>Test::More</u> as the sole driver behind the scenes.

       Should   you   choose   to   use   <u>Test::More</u>   as   the   backend   for   server-based  tests  (such  as
       "t/response/TestMe/basic.pm") you will need to use the "-withtestmore" action tag:

           use Apache::Test qw(-withtestmore);

           sub handler {

               my $r = shift;

               plan $r, tests =&gt; 1;           # Test::More::plan() with
                                              # Apache::Test features

               ok ('yes', 'testing ok');      # Test::More::ok()
           }

       "-withtestmore" tells <u>Apache::Test</u> to use <u>Test::More</u> instead of <u>Test.pm</u> behind the scenes.  Note that you
       are not required to "use  Test::More"  yourself  with  the  "-withtestmore"  option  and  that  the  "use
       Test::More tests =&gt; 1" syntax may have unexpected results.

       Note  that  <u>Test::More</u>  version  0.49,  available  within  the <u>Test::Simple</u> 0.49 distribution on CPAN, or
       greater is required to use this feature.

       Because <u>Apache:Test</u> was initially developed using <u>Test</u>  as  the  framework  driver,  complete  <u>Test::More</u>
       integration  is  considered  experimental  at  this time - it is supported as best as possible but is not
       guaranteed to be as stable as the default <u>Test</u> interface at this time.

</pre><h4><b>Apache::TestToString</b> <b>Class</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>Apache::TestToString</u> class is used to capture <u>Test.pm</u> output into a string.  Example:

           Apache::TestToString-&gt;start;

           plan tests =&gt; 4;

           ok $data eq 'foo';

           ...

           # $tests will contain the Test.pm output: 1..4\nok 1\n...
           my $tests = Apache::TestToString-&gt;finish;

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       The Apache-Test tutorial: &lt;<a href="http://perl.apache.org/docs/general/testing/testing.html">http://perl.apache.org/docs/general/testing/testing.html</a>&gt;.

       Apache::TestRequest subclasses LWP::UserAgent and exports  a  number  of  useful  functions  for  sending
       request to the Apache test server. You can then test the results of those requests.

       Use Apache::TestMM in your <u>Makefile.PL</u> to set up your distribution for testing.
