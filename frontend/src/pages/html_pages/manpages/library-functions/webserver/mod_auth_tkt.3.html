</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       mod_auth_tkt - apache ticket authentication module

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       mod_auth_tkt is a lightweight cookie-based authentication module, written in C, for apache versions
       1.3.x, 2.0.x, and 2.2.x It implements a single-signon framework that works across multiple apache
       instances, different apache versions, and multiple machines.

       mod_auth_tkt itself is completely repository-agnostic, as the actual authentication is done by a user-
       supplied CGI or script in your language of choice (examples are provided in Perl, with contrib libraries
       for use with python and PHP). This allows authentication against virtually any kind of user repository
       you can imagine (password files, ldap directories, databases, etc.)

       mod_auth_tkt supports inactivity timeouts (including the ability to control how aggressively the ticket
       is refreshed), the ability to include arbitrary user data within the cookie, configurable cookie names
       and domains, token-based access to subsections of a site, and optional 'guest' access for unauthenticated
       users.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       mod_auth_tkt is configured in your apache configuration files using the following set of directives (all
       mod_auth_tkt directives begin with 'TKTAuth'):

   <b>Server</b> <b>Directives</b>
       mod_auth_tkt supports two apache server-level directives, one required - TKTAuthDigest, the shared secret
       used for digest hashing - and one optional - TKTAuthDigestType, the type of digest to use in ticket
       hashes. Both may be global or specific to a virtual host.

       TKTAuthSecret &lt;secret&gt;
           String  -  the  secret  used for digest hashing. This should be kept secret and changed periodically.
           e.g.

             TKTAuthSecret "w b@5b15#664038f.f9d8U19b7e25 664eY9ad2%4393e,a2ef"

       TKTAuthDigestType [ MD5 | SHA256 | SHA512 ]
           String, one of MD5 | SHA256 | SHA512. The digest/hash type to use in tickets.  The  default  is  MD5,
           which  is  faster, but has now been shown to be vulnerable to collision attacks. Such attacks are not
           directly applicable to mod_auth_tkt, which primarily relies on the  security  of  the  shared  secret
           rather  than  the strength of the hashing scheme. More paranoid users will probably prefer to use one
           of the SHA digest types, however.

           The default is likely to change in a future  version,  so  setting  the  digest  type  explicitly  is
           encouraged.

           Note  that  using  one  of  the  SHA  digest  types  with  the perl CGI scripts requires a version of
           Apache::AuthTkt &gt;= 2.1.

   <b>Directory</b> <b>Directives</b>
       All directory-level directives are optional, except that either TKTAuthLoginURL or TKTAuthGuestLogin  (or
       both)  must  be  set to cause mod_auth_tkt to be invoked for a particular directory. As usual, directory-
       level directives may be set in Directory or Location sections, or in .htaccess files.

       AuthType None / require &lt;users&gt;
           mod_auth_tkt  requires  the  following  standard  apache   authentication   directives   to   trigger
           authentication:

             AuthType None
             require valid-user      # or require user1, user2, etc.

       TKTAuthLoginURL &lt;url&gt;
           Standard  URL to which unauthenticated users are redirected.  This is a required directive unless you
           are using guest mode via 'TKTAuthGuestLogin on'. e.g.

             TKTAuthLoginURL https://www.example.com/auth/login.cgi

       TKTAuthTimeoutURL &lt;url&gt;
           URL to which users are redirected in the event their ticket times out. Default: TKTAuthLoginURL. e.g.

             TKTAuthTimeoutURL https://www.example.com/auth/login.cgi?timeout=1

       TKTAuthPostTimeoutURL &lt;url&gt;
           URL to which users are redirected in the event their ticket times out during a POST  operation.  This
           case  is  distinguished  to  allow  you  to  handle such cases specially - you probably don't want to
           redirect back to the referrer after login, for instance.  Default: TKTAuthTImeoutURL. e.g.

             TKTAuthPostTimeoutURL https://www.example.com/auth/login.cgi?posttimeout=1

       TKTAuthUnauthURL &lt;url&gt;
           URL to which users are redirected in the event that they are not authorised  for  a  particular  area
           e.g. incorrect tokens.

             TKTAuthUnauthURL https://www.example.com/auth/login.cgi?unauth=1

       TKTAuthGuestLogin &lt;boolean&gt;
           Flag  to  turn  on  'guest'  mode,  which means that any user without a valid ticket is authenticated
           anyway as the TKTAuthGuestUser user.  This is useful  for  allowing  public  access  for  guests  and
           robots, while allowing more personalised or privileged access for users who login. Default: off. e.g.

             TKTAuthGuestLogin on

       TKTAuthGuestCookie &lt;boolean&gt;
           Flag  to  indicate  whether  or  not  to  issue  a ticket cookie for guest users. Issuing a cookie is
           primarily useful where you are using UUID-ed guest users where you want  them  to  keep  the  initial
           guest username you issue them for tracking purposes. e.g.

             TKTAuthGuestCookie on

           Default  is 'off', unless you use a TKTAuthGuestUser with a UUID (see next), in which case it's 'on'.
           Setting explicitly is recommended, however.

       TKTAuthGuestUser &lt;string&gt;
           Username to be used for the guest user (in the ticket uid, REMOTE_USER environment variable, etc).

           On apache 2.0.x and 2.2.x (but not on apache 1.3.x), the TKTAuthGuestUser may also contain a  special
           sprintf-like  pattern  '%U',  which  is  expanded to 36-character UUID, allowing individualised guest
           usernames. The %U may also include an integer &lt;= 36 to limit the number of  characters  used  in  the
           UUID e.g. %12U, %20U etc.

           Default: 'guest'. Examples:

             TKTAuthGuestUser visitor
             TKTAuthGuestUser guest-%12U

       TKTAuthGuestFallback &lt;boolean&gt;
           Flag  to  indicate  that a timed out user ticket should automatically fallback to 'guest' status, and
           issue a new guest ticket, instead of redirecting to the  TKTAuthTimeoutURL.  Only  makes  sense  with
           TKTAuthGuestLogin on, of course.

           Default: off.

       TKTAuthGuestEmpty &lt;boolean&gt;
           Flag to indicate that the guest username should be an empty string.  Useful for allowing applications
           to  fallback  to  native  authentication  when  REMOTE_USER is empty (NOTE: REMOTE_USER must exist to
           satisfy Require valid-user, but will be empty).  Only  makes  sense  with  TKTAuthGuestLogin  on,  of
           course.

           Default: off.

       TKTAuthTimeout &lt;seconds&gt;
           The  ticket  timeout  period,  in seconds. After this period, the ticket is considered stale, and the
           user is redirected to the TKTAuthTimeoutURL (if set, else to  the  TKTAuthLoginURL).  Note  that  the
           ticket can be automatically refreshed, however, using the next setting.

           The  following  units can also be specified on the timeout (with no spaces between timeout and unit):
           y/years, M/months, w/weeks, d/days, h/hours, m/minutes, and s/seconds.

           This timeout is protected by the  ticket  hashing,  so  cannot  be  trivially  modified,  unlike  the
           TKTAuthCookieExpires setting below.

           Setting  TKTAuthTimeout  to 0 means never timeout, but this is strongly discouraged, as it allows for
           trivial replay attacks. Set it to a week or two if you really don't want timeouts.

           Default: 2h. Examples:

             TKTAuthTimeout 86400
             TKTAuthTimeout 1w
             TKTAuthTimeout 1w 4d 3h

       TKTAuthTimeoutRefresh &lt;decimal&gt;
           A number between 0 and 1 indicating whether and how to  refresh  ticket  timestamps.  0  means  never
           refresh  (hard timeouts). 1 means refresh tickets every time. .33 (for example) means refresh if less
           than .33 of the timeout period remains.

           This is a politeness setting for those paranoid types who have their  browsers  set  to  confirm  all
           cookies - refreshing every time quickly becomes VERY tedious. Default: 0.5. e.g.

             TKTAuthTimeoutRefresh 0.66

       TKTAuthCookieName &lt;name&gt;
           The name used for the ticket cookie. Default: 'auth_tkt'.

       TKTAuthDomain &lt;domain&gt;
           The  domain  to use in ticket cookies, which defines the hosts for which the browser will submit this
           cookie. Default: the apache ServerName (either global or for a specific virtual host).

       TKTAuthCookieExpires &lt;seconds&gt;
           <b>NB:</b> This directive is not currently supported on apache 1.3.x!

           The period until the cookie expires, used to set  the  'expires'  field  on  the  ticket  cookie,  in
           seconds. This is useful if you want cookies to persist across browser sessions (and your login script
           must support it too, of course).

           The  following  units  can  also be specified on the expiry period (with no spaces between period and
           unit): y/years, M/months, w/weeks, d/days, h/hours, m/minutes, and s/seconds.

           Note that his is a <b>client-side</b> setting and is not protected by the  ticket  hashing,  so  you  should
           always  set  a  TKTAuthTimeout  in  addition  to  using an expiry. Cookie expiries are refreshed with
           tickets if TKTAuthTimeoutRefresh is set.

           Default: none (not used).

           e.g.

             TKTAuthCookieExpires 86400
             TKTAuthCookieExpires 1w
             TKTAuthCookieExpires 1w 3d 4h

       TKTAuthBackArgName &lt;name&gt;
           The name used for the back GET parameter. If this is set, mod_auth_tkt will add a  GET  parameter  to
           all  redirect  URLs  containing  a  URI-escaped  version  of  the  current requested page e.g. if the
           requested  page  is  <a href="http://www.example.com/index.html">http://www.example.com/index.html</a>  and  TKTAuthBackArgName  is  set  to  'back',
           mod_auth_tkt will add a parameter like:

             back=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.example.com%2Findex.html

           to  the TKTAuthLoginURL it redirects to, allowing your login script to redirect back to the requested
           page upon successful login.

           To omit altogether, set to the string <b>None</b> i.e.

             TKTAuthBackArgName None

           Default: 'back'.

       TKTAuthBackCookieName &lt;name&gt;
           The cookie name to use for the back cookie. If this is set,  mod_auth_tkt  will  set  a  back  cookie
           containing  a  URI-escaped version of current requested page when redirecting (see TKTAuthBackArgName
           above), instead of using a GET parameter.

           Default: none (not used).

       TKTAuthToken &lt;token&gt;
           String indicating a required token for the given location, implementing a simple form of  token-based
           access  control.  If  the  user's  ticket  does not contain one or more of the required tokens in the
           ticket  token  list  then  mod_auth_tkt  will  redirect  to   the   TKTAuthUnauthURL   location   (or
           TKTAuthLoginURL  if  not  set). Your login script is expected to set the appropriate token list up at
           login time, of course.

           Note that this directive can be repeated, and the semantics are that <b>any</b> of the  required  tokens  is
           sufficient for access i.e. the tokens are ORed.

           Default: none (not used).

           e.g.

             TKTAuthToken finance
             TKTAuthToken admin

       TKTAuthIgnoreIP &lt;boolean&gt;
           Flag indicating that mod_auth_tkt should ignore the client IP address in authenticating tickets (your
           login  script  must  support  this  as well, setting the client IP address to 0.0.0.0). This is often
           required out on the open internet, especially if you are using an HTTPS login page  (as  you  should)
           and are dealing with more than a handful of users (the typical problem being transparent HTTP proxies
           at ISPs).

           Default: 'off' i.e. ticket is only valid from the originating IP address.

           e.g.

             TKTAuthIgnoreIP on

       TKTAuthRequireSSL &lt;boolean&gt;
           Flag  used  to  indicate  that  tickets  should  be  refused  except  in SSL/HTTPS protected contexts
           (redirects to TKTAuthLoginURL if not, which presumably would be using HTTPS). Default:  'off'  (<b>don't</b>
           require SSL). e.g.

             TKTAuthRequireSSL on

           See also TKTAuthCookieSecure below.

       TKTAuthCookieSecure &lt;boolean&gt;
           Flag  used to set the 'secure' flag on all ticket cookies issued, indicating to the browser that they
           should only be sent in SSL/HTTPS protected contexts. Default: 'off' (<b>don't</b> set 'secure' flag). e.g.

             TKTAuthCookieSecure on

           TKTAuthRequireSSL and TKTAuthCookieSecure are normally used together. One case where it  makes  sense
           to use them separately is where you are proxying through a separate SSL-equipped reverse proxy, where
           you  would  want  to  use  TKTAuthCookieSecure by itself (since the proxied request will never be via
           SSL).

       TKTAuthDebug &lt;integer&gt;
           Turn on mod_auth_tkt debug output messages in your error log, with verbosity increasing  with  higher
           integer values. Current range: 1-3.

           Note that you will also require apache 'LogLevel debug' set to see these messages.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Minimal config using logins:

         &lt;Location /secret1&gt;
           AuthType None
           require valid-user
           TKTAuthLoginURL https://www.example.com/auth/login.cgi
         &lt;/Location&gt;

       Minimal config using guest logins (users can still login explicitly, of course):

         &lt;Location /secret2&gt;
           AuthType None
           require valid-user
           TKTAuthGuestLogin on
         &lt;/Location&gt;

       Example internet configuration:

         &lt;Location /secret3&gt;
           AuthType None
           require valid-user
           TKTAuthLoginURL https://www.example.com/auth/login.cgi
           TKTAuthTimeoutURL https://www.example.com/auth/login.cgi?timeout=1
           TKTAuthPostTimeoutURL https://www.example.com/auth/login.cgi?timeout=1&amp;post=1
           TKTAuthIgnoreIP on
           TKTAuthTimeout 2h
           TKTAuthCookieExpires 2h
         &lt;/Location&gt;

       Example intranet configuration:

         &lt;Location /secret4&gt;
           AuthType None
           require valid-user
           TKTAuthGuestLogin on
           TKTAuthLoginURL https://www.example.com/auth/login.cgi
           TKTAuthTimeoutURL https://www.example.com/auth/login.cgi?timeout=1
           TKTAuthPostTimeoutURL https://www.example.com/auth/login.cgi?timeout=1&amp;post=1
           TKTAuthTimeout 4h
           TKTAuthCookieExpires 4h
         &lt;/Location&gt;
