</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Apache::TestUtil - Utility functions for writing tests

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Apache::Test;
         use Apache::TestUtil;

         ok t_cmp("foo", "foo", "sanity check");
         t_write_file("filename", @content);
         my $fh = t_open_file($filename);
         t_mkdir("/foo/bar");
         t_rmtree("/foo/bar");
         t_is_equal($a, $b);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       "Apache::TestUtil" automatically exports a number of functions useful in writing tests.

       All the files and directories created using the functions from this package will be automatically
       destroyed at the end of the program execution (via END block). You should not use these functions other
       than from within tests which should cleanup all the created directories and files at the end of the test.

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>t_cmp()</b>
             t_cmp($received, $expected, $comment);

           <b>t_cmp()</b> prints the values of <u>$comment</u>, <u>$expected</u> and <u>$received</u>. e.g.:

             t_cmp(1, 1, "1 == 1?");

           prints:

             # testing : 1 == 1?
             # expected: 1
             # received: 1

           then  it  returns the result of comparison of the <u>$expected</u> and the <u>$received</u> variables. Usually, the
           return value of this function is fed directly to the <b>ok()</b> function, like this:

             ok t_cmp(1, 1, "1 == 1?");

           the third argument (<u>$comment</u>) is optional, mostly useful for telling what the comparison is trying to
           do.

           It is valid to use "undef" as an expected value. Therefore:

             my $foo;
             t_cmp(undef, $foo, "undef == undef?");

           will return a <u>true</u> value.

           You can compare any two data-structures with <b>t_cmp()</b>. Just make sure that if  you  pass  non-scalars,
           you  have  to  pass  their  references.  The datastructures can be deeply nested. For example you can
           compare:

             t_cmp({1 =&gt; [2..3,{5..8}], 4 =&gt; [5..6]},
                   {1 =&gt; [2..3,{5..8}], 4 =&gt; [5..6]},
                   "hash of array of hashes");

           You can also compare the second argument against the first as a regex. Use the "qr//" function in the
           second argument. For example:

             t_cmp("abcd", qr/^abc/, "regex compare");

           will do:

             "abcd" =~ /^abc/;

           This function is exported by default.

       <b>t_filepath_cmp()</b>
           This function is used to compare two filepaths via <b>t_cmp()</b>.  For non-Win32, it  simply  uses  <b>t_cmp()</b>
           for  the  comparison,  but  for  Win32,  <b>Win32::GetLongPathName()</b> is invoked to convert the first two
           arguments to their DOS long pathname. This is useful when there is a possibility the two paths  being
           compared are not both represented by their long or short pathname.

           This function is exported by default.

       <b>t_debug()</b>
             t_debug("testing feature foo");
             t_debug("test", [1..3], 5, {a=&gt;[1..5]});

           <b>t_debug()</b>  prints  out  any datastructure while prepending "#" at the beginning of each line, to make
           the debug printouts comply with "Test::Harness"'s requirements. This function should be  always  used
           for debug prints, since if in the future the debug printing will change (e.g. redirected into a file)
           your tests won't need to be changed.

           the  special  global variable $Apache::TestUtil::DEBUG_OUTPUT can be used to redirect the output from
           <b>t_debug()</b> and related calls such as <b>t_write_file()</b>.  for example, from a server-side test  you  would
           probably need to redirect it to STDERR:

             sub handler {
               plan $r, tests =&gt; 1;

               local $Apache::TestUtil::DEBUG_OUTPUT = \*STDERR;

               t_write_file('/tmp/foo', 'bar');
               ...
             }

           left  to  its  own devices, <b>t_debug()</b> will collide with the standard HTTP protocol during server-side
           tests, resulting in a situation both confusing difficult  to  debug.   but  STDOUT  is  left  as  the
           default,  since  you probably don't want debug output under normal circumstances unless running under
           verbose mode.

           This function is exported by default.

       <b>t_write_test_lib()</b>
             t_write_test_lib($filename, @lines)

           <b>t_write_test_lib()</b> creates a new file at <u>$filename</u> or overwrites the existing file with  the  content
           passed  in  <u>@lines</u>.   The  file  is  created  in a temporary directory which is added to @INC at test
           configuration time.  It is intended to be used for creating temporary packages for testing which  can
           be modified at run time, see the Apache::Reload unit tests for an example.

       <b>t_write_file()</b>
             t_write_file($filename, @lines);

           <b>t_write_file()</b>  creates  a  new  file  at  <u>$filename</u> or overwrites the existing file with the content
           passed in <u>@lines</u>. If only the <u>$filename</u> is passed, an empty file will be created.

           If parent directories of $filename don't exist they will be automagically created.

           The generated file will be automatically deleted at the end of the program's execution.

           This function is exported by default.

       <b>t_append_file()</b>
             t_append_file($filename, @lines);

           <b>t_append_file()</b> is similar to <b>t_write_file()</b>, but it  doesn't  clobber  existing  files  and  appends
           @lines to the end of the file. If the file doesn't exist it will create it.

           If parent directories of $filename don't exist they will be automagically created.

           The  generated  file  will  be  registered  to  be  automatically deleted at the end of the program's
           execution, only if the file was created by <b>t_append_file()</b>.

           This function is exported by default.

       <b>t_write_shell_script()</b>
             Apache::TestUtil::t_write_shell_script($filename, @lines);

           Similar to <b>t_write_file()</b> but  creates  a  portable  shell/batch  script.  The  created  filename  is
           constructed  from  $filename  and  an  appropriate  extension automatically selected according to the
           platform the code is running under.

           It returns the extension of the created file.

       <b>t_write_perl_script()</b>
             Apache::TestUtil::t_write_perl_script($filename, @lines);

           Similar to <b>t_write_file()</b> but creates a executable Perl script with correctly set shebang line.

       <b>t_open_file()</b>
             my $fh = t_open_file($filename);

           <b>t_open_file()</b> opens a file <u>$filename</u> for writing and returns the file handle to the opened file.

           If parent directories of $filename don't exist they will be automagically created.

           The generated file will be automatically deleted at the end of the program's execution.

           This function is exported by default.

       <b>t_mkdir()</b>
             t_mkdir($dirname);

           <b>t_mkdir()</b> creates a directory <u>$dirname</u>. The operation will  fail  if  the  parent  directory  doesn't
           exist.

           If parent directories of $dirname don't exist they will be automagically created.

           The generated directory will be automatically deleted at the end of the program's execution.

           This function is exported by default.

       <b>t_rmtree()</b>
             t_rmtree(@dirs);

           <b>t_rmtree()</b> deletes the whole directories trees passed in <u>@dirs</u>.

           This function is exported by default.

       <b>t_chown()</b>
             Apache::TestUtil::t_chown($file);

           Change  ownership  of  $file  to  the  test's  <u>User</u>/<u>Group</u>.   This function is noop on platforms where
           <b><a href="../man2/chown.2.html">chown</a></b>(2) is unsupported (e.g. Win32).

       <b>t_is_equal()</b>
             t_is_equal($a, $b);

           <b>t_is_equal()</b> compares any two datastructures and returns 1 if they are exactly the same, otherwise 0.
           The datastructures can be nested hashes, arrays, scalars, undefs or a combination of  any  of  these.
           See <b>t_cmp()</b> for an example.

           If $b is a regex reference, the regex comparison "$a =~ $b" is performed. For example:

             t_is_equal($server_version, qr{^Apache});

           If comparing non-scalars make sure to pass the references to the datastructures.

           This function is exported by default.

       <b>t_server_log_error_is_expected()</b>
           If  the  handler's  execution  results in an error or a warning logged to the <u>error_log</u> file which is
           expected, it's a good idea to have a disclaimer printed before the error itself, so one can tell real
           problems with tests from expected errors. For example when testing  how  the  package  behaves  under
           error conditions the <u>error_log</u> file might be loaded with errors, most of which are expected.

           For example if a handler is about to generate a run-time error, this function can be used as:

             use Apache::TestUtil;
             ...
             sub handler {
                 my $r = shift;
                 ...
                 t_server_log_error_is_expected();
                 die "failed because ...";
             }

           After running this handler the <u>error_log</u> file will include:

             *** The following error entry is expected and harmless ***
             [Tue Apr 01 14:00:21 2003] [error] failed because ...

           When  more than one entry is expected, an optional numerical argument, indicating how many entries to
           expect, can be passed. For example:

             <a href="../man2/t_server_log_error_is_expected.2.html">t_server_log_error_is_expected</a>(2);

           will generate:

             *** The following 2 error entries are expected and harmless ***

           If the error is generated at compile time, the logging must be done in the BEGIN block  at  the  very
           beginning of the file:

             BEGIN {
                 use Apache::TestUtil;
                 t_server_log_error_is_expected();
             }
             use DOES_NOT_exist;

           After attempting to run this handler the <u>error_log</u> file will include:

             *** The following error entry is expected and harmless ***
             [Tue Apr 01 14:04:49 2003] [error] Can't locate "DOES_NOT_exist.pm"
             in @INC (@INC contains: ...

           Also see t_server_log_warn_is_expected() which is similar but used for warnings.

           This function is exported by default.

       <b>t_server_log_warn_is_expected()</b>
           t_server_log_warn_is_expected() generates a disclaimer for expected warnings.

           See the explanation for t_server_log_error_is_expected() for more details.

           This function is exported by default.

       <b>t_client_log_error_is_expected()</b>
           t_client_log_error_is_expected()  generates  a  disclaimer  for  expected  errors. But in contrast to
           t_server_log_error_is_expected() called by the client side of the script.

           See the explanation for t_server_log_error_is_expected() for more details.

           For example the following client script fails to find the handler:

             use Apache::Test;
             use Apache::TestUtil;
             use Apache::TestRequest qw(GET);

             plan tests =&gt; 1;

             t_client_log_error_is_expected();
             my $url = "/error_document/cannot_be_found";
             my $res = GET($url);
             ok t_cmp(404, $res-&gt;code, "test 404");

           After running this test the <u>error_log</u> file will include an entry similar to the following snippet:

             *** The following error entry is expected and harmless ***
             [Tue Apr 01 14:02:55 2003] [error] [client 127.0.0.1]
             File does not exist: /tmp/test/t/htdocs/error

           When more than one entry is expected, an optional numerical argument, indicating how many entries  to
           expect, can be passed. For example:

             <a href="../man2/t_client_log_error_is_expected.2.html">t_client_log_error_is_expected</a>(2);

           will generate:

             *** The following 2 error entries are expected and harmless ***

           This function is exported by default.

       <b>t_client_log_warn_is_expected()</b>
           t_client_log_warn_is_expected() generates a disclaimer for expected warnings on the client side.

           See the explanation for t_client_log_error_is_expected() for more details.

           This function is exported by default.

       t_catfile('a', 'b', 'c')
           This function is essentially "File::Spec-&gt;catfile", but on Win32 will use Win32::GetLongpathName() to
           convert  the  result  to  a  long path name (if the result is an absolute file).  The function is not
           exported by default.

       t_catfile_apache('a', 'b', 'c')
           This   function   is   essentially   "File::Spec::Unix-&gt;catfile",   but    on    Win32    will    use
           Win32::GetLongpathName()  to  convert  the  result  to a long path name (if the result is an absolute
           file).  It is useful when comparing something to that returned by Apache,  which  uses  a  Unix-style
           specification with forward slashes for directory separators. The function is not exported by default.

       <b>t_start_error_log_watch()</b>, <b>t_finish_error_log_watch()</b>
           This  pair  of  functions  provides  an  easy  interface  for checking the presence or absence of any
           particular message or messages in the httpd error_log that were generated by the httpd daemon as part
           of a test suite.   It  is  likely,  that  you  should  proceed  this  with  a  call  to  one  of  the
           t_*<b>_is_expected()</b> functions.

             t_start_error_log_watch();
             do_it;
             ok grep {...} t_finish_error_log_watch();

           Another  usage  case  could be a handler that emits some debugging messages to the error_log. Now, if
           this handler is called in a series of other test cases it can be hard to find the  relevant  messages
           manually. In such cases the following sequence in the test file may help:

             t_start_error_log_watch();
             GET '/this/or/that';
             t_debug t_finish_error_log_watch();

       <b>t_start_file_watch()</b>
             Apache::TestUtil::t_start_file_watch('access_log');

           This  function is similar to t_start_error_log_watch() but allows for other files than "error_log" to
           be watched. It opens the given file and positions the file pointer at its end.  Subsequent  calls  to
           t_read_file_watch() or t_finish_file_watch() will read lines that have been appended after this call.

           A  file  name can be passed as parameter. If omitted or undefined the "error_log" is opened. Relative
           file name are evaluated relative to the directory containing "error_log".

           If the specified file does not exist (yet) no error is returned. It is assumed that  it  will  appear
           soon.  In  this  case  "t_{read,finish}_file_watch()"  will  open the file silently and read from the
           beginning.

       <b>t_read_file_watch()</b>, <b>t_finish_file_watch()</b>
             local $/ = "\n";
             $line1=Apache::TestUtil::t_read_file_watch('access_log');
             $line2=Apache::TestUtil::t_read_file_watch('access_log');

             @lines=Apache::TestUtil::t_finish_file_watch('access_log');

           This pair of functions reads the file opened by t_start_error_log_watch().

           As does the core "readline" function, they return one line if called in scalar context, otherwise all
           lines until end of file.

           Before calling "readline" these functions do not set $/ as does  "t_finish_error_log_watch".  So,  if
           the file has for example a fixed record length use this:

             {
               local $/=\$record_length;
               @lines=t_finish_file_watch($name);
             }

       <b>t_file_watch_for()</b>
             @lines=Apache::TestUtil::t_file_watch_for('access_log',
                                                       qr/condition/,
                                                       $timeout);

           This  function  reads  the  file  from the current position and looks for the first line that matches
           "qr/condition/". If no such line could be found until end of file the  function  pauses  and  retries
           until either such a line is found or the timeout (in seconds) is reached.

           In  scalar  or  void  context  only the matching line is returned. In list context all read lines are
           returned with the matching one in last position.

           The function uses "\n" and end-of-line marker and waits for complete lines.

           The timeout although it can be specified with sub-second precision is not very accurate. It is simply
           multiplied by 10. The result is used as a maximum loop count. For the intented purpose this should be
           good enough.

           Use this function to check for logfile entries when you cannot be sure that they are already  written
           when  the  test  program  reaches  the point, for example to check for messages that are written in a
           PerlCleanupHandler or a PerlLogHandler.

            ok t_file_watch_for 'access_log', qr/expected log entry/, 2;

           This call reads the "access_log" and waits for maximum 2 seconds for the expected entry to appear.
