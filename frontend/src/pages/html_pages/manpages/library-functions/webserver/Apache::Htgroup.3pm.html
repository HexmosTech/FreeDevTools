</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Apache::Htgroup - Manage Apache authentication group files

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Apache::Htgroup;
         $htgroup = Apache::Htgroup-&gt;load($path_to_groupfile);
         &amp;do_something if $htgroup-&gt;ismember($user, $group);
         $htgroup-&gt;adduser($user, $group);
         $htgroup-&gt;deleteuser($user, $group);
         $htgroup-&gt;deletegroup( $group );
         $htgroup-&gt;save;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Manage Apache htgroup files

       Please note that this is <u>not</u> a mod_perl module. Please also note that there is another module that does
       similar things (HTTPD::UserManage) and that this is a more simplistic module, not doing all the things
       that one does.

   <b>METHODS</b>
       The following methods are provided by this module.

   <b>load</b>
           $htgroup = Apache::Htgroup-&gt;load($path_to_groupfile);

       Returns an Apache::Htgroup object.

   <b>new</b>
           $htgroup = Apache::Htgroup-&gt;new();
           $htgroup = Apache::Htgroup-&gt;new( $path_to_groupfile );

       Creates a new, empty group file. If the specified file already exists, loads the contents of that file.
       If no filename is specified, you can create a group file in memory, and save it later.

   <b>adduser</b>
           $htgroup-&gt;adduser( $username, $group );

       Adds the specified user to the specified group.

   <b>deleteuser</b>
           $htgroup-&gt;deleteuser($user, $group);

       Removes the specified user from the group.

   <b>groups</b>
           $groups = $htgroup-&gt;groups;

       Returns a (reference to a) hash of the groups. The key is the name of the group. Each value is a hashref,
       the keys of which are the group members. I suppose there may be some variety of members method in the
       future, if anyone thinks that would be useful.

       It is expected that this method will not be called directly, and it is provided as a convenience only.

       Please see the section below about internals for an example of the data structure.

   <b>reload</b>
            $self-&gt;reload;

       If you have not already called <b>save()</b>, you can call <b>reload()</b> and get back to the state of the object as
       it was loaded from the original file.

   <b>deletegroup</b>
           $self-&gt;deletegroup( 'GroupName' );

       Removes a group from the htgroup file. You will need to call save afterward to commit this change back to
       the file.

   <b>save</b>
           $htgroup-&gt;save;
           $htgroup-&gt;save($file);

       Writes the current contents of the htgroup object back to the file. If you provide a $file argument,
       "save" will attempt to write to that location.

   <b>ismember</b>
           $foo = $htgroup-&gt;ismember($user, $group);

       Returns true if the username is in the group, false otherwise

</pre><h4><b>Internals</b></h4><pre>
       Although this was not the case in earlier versions, the internal data structure of the object looks
       something like the following:

        $obj = { groupfile =&gt; '/path/to/groupfile',
                 groups =&gt; { group1 =&gt; { 'user1' =&gt; 1,
                                         'user2' =&gt; 1,
                                         'user3' =&gt; 1
                                       },
                             group2 =&gt; { 'usera' =&gt; 1,
                                         'userb' =&gt; 1,
                                         'userc' =&gt; 1
                                       },
                           }
               };

       Note that this data structure is subject to change in the future, and is provided mostly so that I can
       remember what the heck I was thinking when I next have to look at this code.

</pre><h4><b>Adding</b> <b>groups</b></h4><pre>
       A number of folks have asked for a method to add a new group. This is unnecessary. To add a new group,
       just start adding users to a new group, and the new group will magically spring into existence.
