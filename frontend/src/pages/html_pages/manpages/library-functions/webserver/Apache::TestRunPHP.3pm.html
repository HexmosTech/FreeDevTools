</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Apache::TestRunPHP - configure and run a PHP-based test suite

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Apache::TestRunPHP;
         Apache::TestRunPHP-&gt;new-&gt;run(@ARGV);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The "Apache::TestRunPHP" package controls the configuration and running of the test suite for PHP-based
       tests.  It's a subclass of "Apache::TestRun" and similar in function to "Apache::TestRunPerl".

       Refer to the "Apache::TestRun" manpage for information on the available API.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       "TestRunPHP" works almost identially to "TestRunPerl", but in case you are new to "Apache-Test" here is a
       quick getting started guide.  be sure to see the links at the end of this document for places to find
       additional details.

       because "Apache-Test" is a Perl-based testing framework we start from a "Makefile.PL", which should have
       the following lines (in addition to the standard "Makefile.PL" parts):

         use Apache::TestMM qw(test clean);
         use Apache::TestRunPHP ();

         Apache::TestMM::filter_args();

         Apache::TestRunPHP-&gt;generate_script();

       generate_script() will create a script named "t/TEST", the gateway to the Perl testing harness and what
       is invoked when you call "make test".  filter_args() accepts some "Apache::Test"-specific arguments and
       passes them along.  for example, to point to a specific "httpd" installation you would invoke
       "Makefile.PL" as follows

         $ perl Makefile.PL -httpd /my/local/apache/bin/httpd

       and "/my/local/apache/bin/httpd" will be propagated throughout the rest of the process.  note that PHP
       needs to be active within Apache prior to configuring the test framework as shown above, either by virtue
       of PHP being compiled into the "httpd" binary statically or through an active "LoadModule" statement
       within the configuration located in "/my/local/apache/conf/httpd.conf".  Other required modules are the
       (very common) mod_alias and mod_env.

       now, like with "Apache::TestRun" and "Apache::TestRunPerl", you can place client-side Perl test scripts
       under "t/", such as "t/01basic.t", and "Apache-Test" will run these scripts when you call "make test".
       however, what makes "Apache::TestRunPHP" unique is some added magic specifically tailored to a PHP
       environment.  here are the mechanics.

       "Apache::TestRunPHP" will look for PHP test scripts in that match the following pattern

         t/response/TestFoo/bar.php

       where "Foo" and "bar" can be anything you like, and "t/response/Test*" is case sensitive.  when this
       format is adhered to, "Apache::TestRunPHP" will create an associated Perl test script called
       "t/foo/bar.t", which will be executed when you call "make test".  all "bar.t" does is issue a simple GET
       to "bar.php", leaving the actual testing to "bar.php".  in essence, you can forget that "bar.t" even
       exists.

       what does "bar.php" look like?  here is an example:

         &lt;?php
           print "1..1\n";
           print "ok 1\n"
         ?&gt;

       if it looks odd, that's ok because it is.  I could explain to you exactly what this means, but it isn't
       important to understand the gory details.  instead, it is sufficient to understand that when
       "Apache::Test" calls "bar.php" it feeds the results directly to "Test::Harness", a module that comes with
       every Perl installation, and "Test::Harness" expects what it receives to be formatted in a very specific
       way.  by itself, all of this is pretty useless, so "Apache::Test" provides PHP testers with something
       much better.  here is a much better example:

         &lt;?php
           # import the Test::More emulation layer
           # see
           #   <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Test-Simple/lib/Test/More.pm">http://search.cpan.org/dist/Test-Simple/lib/Test/More.pm</a>
           # for Perl's documentation - these functions should behave
           # in the same way
           require 'test-more.php';

           # plan() the number of tests
           <a href="../man6/plan.6.html">plan</a>(6);

           # call ok() for each test you plan
           ok ('foo' == 'foo', 'foo is equal to foo');
           ok ('foo' != 'foo', 'foo is not equal to foo');

           # ok() can be other things as well
           is ('bar', 'bar', 'bar is bar');
           is ('baz', 'bar', 'baz is baz');
           isnt ('bar', 'beer', 'bar is not beer');
           like ('bar', '/ar$/', 'bar matches ar$');

           diag("printing some debugging information");

           # whoops! one too many tests.  I wonder what will happen...
           is ('biff', 'biff', 'baz is a baz');
         ?&gt;

       the include library "test-more.php" is automatically generated by "Apache::TestConfigPHP" and
       configurations tweaked in such a a way that your PHP scripts can find it without issue.  the functions
       provided by "test-more.php" are equivalent in name and function to those in "Test::More", a standard Perl
       testing library, so you can see that manpage for details on the syntax and functionality of each.

       at this point, we have enough in place to run some tests from PHP-land - a "Makefile.PL" to configure
       Apache for us, and a PHP script in "t/response/TestFoo/bar.php" to send some results out to the testing
       engine.  issuing "make test" would start Apache, issue the request to "bar.php", generate a report, and
       shut down Apache.  the report would look like something like this after running the tests in verbose mode
       (eg "make test TEST_VERBOSE=1"):

         t/php/bar....1..6
         ok 1 - foo is equal to foo
         not ok 2 - foo is not equal to foo
         #     Failed test (/src/devel/perl-php-test/t/response/TestFoo/bar.php at line 13)
         ok 3 - bar is bar
         not ok 4 - baz is baz
         #     Failed test (/src/devel/perl-php-test/t/response/TestFoo/bar.php at line 17)
         #           got: 'baz'
         #      expected: 'bar'
         ok 5 - bar is not beer
         ok 6 - bar matches ar$
         # printing some debugging information
         ok 7 - baz is a baz
         FAILED tests 2, 4, 7
                 Failed 3/6 tests, 50.00% okay
         Failed Test Stat Wstat Total Fail  Failed  List of Failed
         -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
         t/php/bar.t                6    3  50.00%  2 4 7
         Failed 1/1 test scripts, 0.00% okay. 1/6 subtests failed, 83.33% okay.

       note that the actual test file that was run was "t/php/bar.t".  this file is autogenerated based on the
       "t/response/TestFoo/bar.php" pattern of your PHP script.  "t/php/bar.t" happens to be written in Perl,
       but you really don't need to worry about it too much.

       as an interesting aside, if you are using perl-5.8.3 or later you can actually create your own
       "t/foo.php" client-side scripts and they will be run via php (using our "php.ini").  but more on that
       later...

       the best source of information about using Apache-Test with PHP (at this time) is probably the talk given
       at ApacheCon 2004 (&lt;<a href="http://xrl.us/phpperl">http://xrl.us/phpperl</a>&gt;), as well as the code from the talk
       (&lt;<a href="http://xrl.us/phpperlcode">http://xrl.us/phpperlcode</a>&gt;).  there is also the online tutorial
       &lt;<a href="http://perl.apache.org/docs/general/testing/testing.html">http://perl.apache.org/docs/general/testing/testing.html</a>&gt; which has all of the mod_perl-specific syntax
       and features have been ported to PHP with this class.
