       App::Info::HTTPD::Apache - Information about Apache web server

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use App::Info::HTTPD::Apache;

         my $apache = App::Info::HTTPD::Apache-&gt;new;

         if ($apache-&gt;installed) {
             print "App name: ", $apache-&gt;name, "\n";
             print "Version:  ", $apache-&gt;version, "\n";
             print "Bin dir:  ", $apache-&gt;bin_dir, "\n";
         } else {
             print "Apache is not installed. :-(\n";
         }

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       App::Info::HTTPD::Apache supplies information about the Apache web server installed on the local system.
       It implements all of the methods defined by App::Info::HTTPD. Methods that trigger events will trigger
       them only the first time they're called (See App::Info for documentation on handling events). To start
       over (after, say, someone has installed Apache) construct a new App::Info::HTTPD::Apache object to
       aggregate new meta data.

       Some of the methods trigger the same events. This is due to cross-calling of methods or of functions
       common to methods. However, any one event should be triggered no more than once. For example, although
       the info event "Executing `httpd -v`" is documented for the methods "name()", "version()",
       "major_version()", "minor_version()", and "patch_version()", rest assured that it will only be triggered
       once, by whichever of those four methods is called first.

</pre><h4><b>INTERFACE</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Constructor</b>
       <u>new</u>

         my $apache = App::Info::HTTPD::Apache-&gt;new(@params);

       Returns an App::Info::HTTPD::Apache object. See App::Info for a complete description of argument
       parameters.

       When called, "new()" searches the the directories returned by "search_bin_dirs()" for an executable with
       a name returned by "search_exe_names()". If found, the executable (hereafter referred to as <u>httpd</u>,
       regardless of how it was actually found to be named) will be called by the object methods below to gather
       the data necessary for each. If <u>httpd</u> cannot be found, then Apache is assumed not to be installed, and
       each of the object methods will return "undef".

       In addition to the parameters supported by the parent classes, App::Info and App::Info::HTTPD, this
       class' "new()" method also supports:

       search_conf_names
           An  array  reference  of possible names for Apache configuration files. These will be returned by the
           "search_conf_names()" method before the default names, and may be used by "conf_file()" to search for
           the configuration file.

       search_conf_dirs
           An array reference of possible directories in which to search for Apache configuration  files.  These
           will  be  returned by the "search_conf_dirs()" method before the default directories, and may be used
           by "conf_file()" to search for the configuration file.

       As well as these parameters to specify alternate names for Apache executables (other  than  <u>httpd</u>,  which
       you specify via the "search_exe_names" parameter):

       search_ab_names
       search_apachectl_names
       search_apxs_names
       search_htdigest_names
       search_htpasswd_names
       search_logresolve_names
       search_rotatelogs_names

   <b>Class</b> <b>Method</b>
       <u>key_name</u>

         my $key_name = App::Info::HTTPD::Apache-&gt;key_name;

       Returns the unique key name that describes this class. The value returned is the string "Apache".

   <b>Object</b> <b>Methods</b>
       <u>installed</u>

         print "apache is ", ($apache-&gt;installed ? '' : 'not '),
           "installed.\n";

       Returns true if Apache is installed, and false if it is not.  App::Info::HTTPD::Apache determines whether
       Apache  is  installed  based  on  the presence or absence of the <u>httpd</u> application on the file system, as
       found when "new()" constructed the object. If Apache does not appear to be installed,  then  all  of  the
       other object methods will return empty values.

       <u>name</u>

         my $name = $apache-&gt;name;

       Returns  the  name  of  the  application.  App::Info::HTTPD::Apache  parses the name from the system call

       <u>httpd_root</u>

         my $httpd_root = $apache-&gt;httpd_root;

       Returns the HTTPD root directory path. This path is defined at compile time, and App::Info::HTTPD::Apache
       parses it from the system call "`httpd -V`".

       <b>Events:</b>

       info
           Executing `httpd -V`

       error
           Unable to extract compile settings from `httpd -V`

           Cannot parse HTTPD root from `httpd -V`

       unknown
           Enter a valid HTTPD root

       <u>magic_number</u>

         my $magic_number = $apache-&gt;magic_number;

       Returns  the  "Magic  Number"  for  the  Apache installation. This number is defined at compile time, and
       App::Info::HTTPD::Apache parses it from the system call "`httpd -V`".

       <b>Events:</b>

       info
           Executing `httpd -V`

       error
           Unable to extract compile settings from `httpd -V`

       <u>compile_option</u>

         my $compile_option = $apache-&gt;compile_option($option);

       Returns the value of  the  Apache  compile  option  $option.  The  compile  option  is  looked  up  case-
       insensitively.  All  of  the  Apache compile options are collected from the system call "`httpd -V`". For
       compile  options  that  contain  a  corresponding  value  (such  as  "SUEXEC_BIN"  or  "DEFAULT_PIDLOG"),
       "compile_option()"  returns  the  value of the option if the option exists. For other options, it returns
       true (1) if the option was included, and false("undef") if it was not. Returns "undef" if Apache  is  not
       installed or if the option could not be parsed. See the httpd_root method for a list of possible errors.

       See  the  Apache documentation at &lt;<a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs-project/">http://httpd.apache.org/docs-project/</a>&gt; to learn about all the possible
       compile options.

       unknown
           Enter a valid option

       <u>conf_file</u>

       Returns the full path to the Apache configuration file. "conf_file()" looks for the configuration file in
       a number of locations and under a number of names. First it tries  to  use  the  file  specified  by  the
       "SERVER_CONFIG_FILE"  compile  option  (as  returned  by  a  call to "compile_option()") -- and if it's a
       relative file name, it gets appended to the directory returned by  "httpd_root()".  If  that  file  isn't
       found, "conf_file()" then looks for a file with one of the names returned by "search_conf_names()" in the
       <u>conf</u>  subdirectory  of  the  HTTPD  root  directory.  Failing  that,  it searches for them in each of the
       directories returned by "search_conf_dirs()" until it finds a match.

         my @search_bin_dirs = $apache-&gt;search_bin_dirs;

       Returns  a list of possible directories in which to search an executable. Used by the "new()" constructor
       to find an executable to execute and collect application info. The found directory will also be  returned
       by the "bin_dir" method.

       The  list  of  directories by default consists of the path as defined by "File::Spec-&gt;path" and the value
       returned by "Apache2::BuildConfig-&gt;new-&gt;{APXS_BINDIR}" (if Apache2::BuildConfig is installed), as well as
       the following directories:

       /usr/local/apache/bin
       /usr/local/apache2/bin
       /opt/apache/bin
       /opt/apache2/bin
       <a href="file:/usr/local/bin">/usr/local/bin</a>
       <a href="file:/usr/local/sbin">/usr/local/sbin</a>
       <a href="file:/usr/bin">/usr/bin</a>
       <a href="file:/usr/sbin">/usr/sbin</a>
       <a href="file:/bin">/bin</a>
       /etc/httpd/bin
       /etc/apache/bin
       /etc/apache2/bin
       /home/httpd/bin
       /home/apache/bin
       /home/apache2/bin
       /sw/bin
       /sw/sbin
       /web/httpd

       <u>search_lib_dirs</u>

         my @search_lib_dirs = $apache-&gt;search_lib_dirs;

       Returns a list of possible directories in which to search for Apache libraries. By  default,  it  returns
       this list of directories, each appended to the name of the directory returned by "httpd_root()":

       lib
       modules
       libexec

       <u>search_inc_dirs</u>

         my @search_inc_dirs = $apache-&gt;search_inc_dirs;

       Returns  a  list  of  possible  directories  in  which to search for Apache include files. By default, it
       returns this list of directories, each appended to the name of the directory returned by "httpd_root()":

       include
       inc

       <u>search_conf_names</u>

         my @search_conf_dirs = $apache-&gt;search_conf_dirs;

       Returns a list of possible names for Apache configuration files. These will be used bye the "conf_file()"
       method to search for Apache configuration files.  By Default, the possible configuration file names are:

       <u>httpd.conf</u>
       <u>httpd.conf.default</u>

       <u>search_conf_dirs</u>

         my @search_conf_dirs = $apache-&gt;search_conf_dirs;

       Returns a list of directories in which the "conf_file()" method  will  search  for  Apache  configuration
       files.

       /usr/share/doc/apache-perl
       /etc/httpd

   <b>Other</b> <b>Executable</b> <b>Methods</b>
       These methods return the complete paths to their like-named executables.  Apache comes with a fair number
       of them; we provide these methods to provide a path to a subset of them. Each method, when called, checks
       for an executable in the directory returned by "bin_dir()". The name of the executable must be one of the
       names returned by the corresponding "search_*_names" method.

       The available executable methods are:

       ab
       apachectl
       apxs
       htdigest
       htpasswd
       logresolve
       rotatelogs

       And the corresponding search names methods are:

       search_ab_names
       search_apachectl_names
       search_apxs_names
       search_htdigest_names
       search_htpasswd_names
       search_logresolve_names
       search_rotatelogs_names

       <b>Events:</b>

       info
           Looking for executable

       confirm
           Path to executable?

       unknown
           Path to executable?

</pre><h4><b>KNOWN</b> <b>ISSUES</b></h4><pre>
       It's likely that a lot more can be done to collect data about Apache. The methodology for determining the
       lib,  inc,  bin,  and so_lib directories in particular may be considered rather weak. And the Port number
       can be specified multiple ways (and times!) in an Apache configuration file. Patches from those who  know
       a great deal more about interrogating Apache will be most welcome.

</pre><h4><b>TO</b> <b>DO</b></h4><pre>
       Add  method to return the names of available DSOs. These should either be parsed from the <u>httpd.conf</u> file
       or "glob"bed from the file system.
