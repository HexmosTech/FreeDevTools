</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Apache::TestConfig -- Test Configuration setup module

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Apache::TestConfig;

         my $cfg = Apache::TestConfig-&gt;new(%args)
         my $fh = $cfg-&gt;genfile($file);
         $cfg-&gt;writefile($file, $content);
         $cfg-&gt;gendir($dir);
         ...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       "Apache::TestConfig" is used in creating the "Apache::Test" configuration files.

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>genwarning()</b>
             my $warn = $cfg-&gt;genwarning($filename)

           <b>genwarning()</b>  returns  a warning string as a comment, saying that the file was autogenerated and that
           it's not a good idea to modify this file. After the warning a  perl  trace  of  calls  to  this  this
           function is appended. This trace is useful for finding what code has created the file.

             my $warn = $cfg-&gt;genwarning($filename, $from_filename)

           If $from_filename is specified it'll be used in the warning to tell which file it was generated from.

           <b>genwarning()</b>  automatically recognizes the comment type based on the file extension. If the extension
           is not recognized, the default "#" style is used.

           Currently it support "&lt;!-- --&gt;", "/* ... */" and "#" styles.

       <b>genfile()</b>
             my $fh = $cfg-&gt;genfile($file);

           <b>genfile()</b> creates a new file $file for writing and returns a file handle.

           If parent directories of $file don't exist they will be automagically created.

           The file $file and any created parent directories (if found empty) will be automatically  removed  on
           cleanup.

           A  comment with a warning and calls trace is added to the top of this file. See <b>genwarning()</b> for more
           info about this comment.

             my $fh = $cfg-&gt;genfile($file, $from_file);

           If $from_filename is specified it'll be used in the warning to tell which file it was generated from.

             my $fh = $cfg-&gt;genfile($file, $from_file, $nowarning);

           If $nowarning is true, the warning won't be added. If using this optional argument and  there  is  no
           $from_file you must pass undef as in:

             my $fh = $cfg-&gt;genfile($file, undef, $nowarning);

       <b>writefile()</b>
             $cfg-&gt;writefile($file, $content, [$nowarning]);

           <b>writefile()</b> creates a new file $file with the content of $content.

           A  comment  with  a  warning  and  calls trace is added to the top of this file unless $nowarnings is
           passed and set to a true value. See <b>genwarning()</b> for more info about this comment.

           If parent directories of $file don't exist they will be automagically created.

           The file $file and any created parent directories (if found empty) will be automatically  removed  on
           cleanup.

       <b>write_perlscript()</b>
             $cfg-&gt;write_perlscript($filename, @lines);

           Similar to <b>writefile()</b> but creates an executable Perl script with correctly set shebang line.

       <b>gendir()</b>
             $cfg-&gt;gendir($dir);

           <b>gendir()</b> creates a new directory $dir.

           If parent directories of $dir don't exist they will be automagically created.

           The  directory  $dir  and  any created parent directories will be automatically removed on cleanup if
           found empty.

</pre><h4><b>Environment</b> <b>Variables</b></h4><pre>
       The following environment variables affect the configuration  and  the  run-time  of  the  "Apache::Test"
       framework:

   <b>APACHE_TEST_COLOR</b>
       To aid visual control over the configuration process and the run-time phase, "Apache::Test" uses coloured
       fonts when the environment variable "APACHE_TEST_COLOR" is set to a true value.

   <b>APACHE_TEST_LIVE_DEV</b>
       When  using  "Apache::Test"  during  the  project  development  phase,  it's often convenient to have the
       <u>project/lib</u> (live) directory appearing first in @INC so any changes to the Perl modules, residing in  it,
       immediately  affect  the  server, without a need to rerun "make" to update <u>blib/lib</u>. When the environment
       variable "APACHE_TEST_LIVE_DEV" is set to a true value during the configuration phase ("t/TEST  -config",
       "Apache::Test"  will  automatically  unshift  the  <u>project/lib</u> directory into @INC, via the autogenerated
       <u>t/conf/modperl_inc.pl</u> file.

</pre><h4><b>Special</b> <b>Placeholders</b></h4><pre>
       When  generating  configuration  files  from  the  <u>*.in</u>  templates,  special  placeholder  variables  get
       substituted. To embed a placeholder use the "@foo@" syntax. For example in <u>extra.conf.in</u> you can write:

         Include @ServerRoot@/conf/myconfig.conf

       When <u>extra.conf</u> is generated, "@ServerRoot@" will get replaced with the location of the server root.

       Placeholders are case-insensitive.

       Available placeholders:

   <b>Configuration</b> <b>Options</b>
       All  configuration  variables  that  can  be  passed  to  "t/TEST", such as "MaxClients", "DocumentRoot",
       "ServerRoot", etc. To see the complete list run:

         % t/TEST --help

       and you will find them in the "configuration options" sections.

   <b>NextAvailablePort</b>
       Every time this placeholder is encountered it'll be replaced with the next available port. This  is  very
       useful if you need to allocate a special port, but not hardcode it. Later when running:

         % t/TEST -port=select

       it's possible to run several concurrent test suites on the same machine, w/o having port collisions.
