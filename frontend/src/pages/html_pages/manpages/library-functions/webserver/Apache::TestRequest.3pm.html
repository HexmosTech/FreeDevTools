</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Apache::TestRequest - Send requests to your Apache test server

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Apache::Test qw(ok have_lwp);
         use Apache::TestRequest qw(GET POST);
         use Apache::Constants qw(HTTP_OK);

         plan tests =&gt; 1, have_lwp;

         my $res = GET '/test.html';
         ok $res-&gt;code == HTTP_OK, "Request is ok";

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Apache::TestRequest</b> provides convenience functions to allow you to make requests to your Apache test
       server in your test scripts. It subclasses "LWP::UserAgent", so that you have access to all if its
       methods, but also exports a number of useful functions likely useful for majority of your test requests.
       Users of the old "Apache::test" (or "Apache::testold") module, take note! Herein lie most of the
       functions you'll need to use to replace "Apache::test" in your test suites.

       Each of the functions exported by "Apache::TestRequest" uses an "LWP::UserAgent" object to submit the
       request and retrieve its results. The return value for many of these functions is an HTTP::Response
       object. See HTTP::Response for documentation of its methods, which you can use in your tests. For
       example, use the code() and content() methods to test the response code and content of your request.
       Using "GET", you can perform a couple of tests using these methods like this:

         use Apache::Test qw(ok have_lwp);
         use Apache::TestRequest qw(GET POST);
         use Apache::Constants qw(HTTP_OK);

         plan tests =&gt; 2, have_lwp;

         my $uri = "/test.html?foo=1&amp;bar=2";
         my $res = GET $uri;
         ok $res-&gt;code == HTTP_OK, "Check that the request was OK";
         ok $res-&gt;content eq "foo =&gt; 1, bar =&gt; 2", "Check its content";

       Note that you can also use "Apache::TestRequest" with "Test::Builder" and its derivatives, including
       "Test::More":

         use Test::More;
         # ...
         is $res-&gt;code, HTTP_OK, "Check that the request was OK";
         is $res-&gt;content, "foo =&gt; 1, bar =&gt; 2", "Check its content";

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>FUNCTION</b></h4><pre>
       You can tell "Apache::TestRequest" what kind of "LWP::UserAgent" object to use for its convenience
       functions with user_agent(). This function uses its arguments to construct an internal global
       "LWP::UserAgent" object that will be used for all subsequent requests made by the convenience functions.
       The arguments it takes are the same as for the "LWP::UserAgent" constructor. See the "LWP::UserAgent"
       documentation for a complete list.

       The user_agent() function only creates the internal "LWP::UserAgent" object the first time it is called.
       Since this function is called internally by "Apache::TestRequest", you should always use the "reset"
       parameter to force it to create a new global "LWP::UserAgent" Object:

         Apache::TestRequest::user_agent(reset =&gt; 1, %params);

       user_agent() differs from "LWP::UserAgent-&gt;new" in two additional ways. First, it supports an additional
       parameter, "keep_alive", which enables connection persistence, where the same connection is used to
       process multiple requests (and, according to the "LWP::UserAgent" documentation, has the effect of
       loading and enabling the new experimental HTTP/1.1 protocol module).

       And finally, the semantics of the "requests_redirectable" parameter is different than for
       "LWP::UserAgent" in that you can pass it a boolean value as well as an array for "LWP::UserAgent". To
       force "Apache::TestRequest" not to follow redirects in any of its convenience functions, pass a false
       value to "requests_redirectable":

         Apache::TestRequest::user_agent(reset =&gt; 1,
                                         requests_redirectable =&gt; 0);

       If LWP is not installed, then you can still pass in an array reference as "LWP::UserAgent" expects.
       "Apache::TestRequest" will examine the array and allow redirects if the array contains more than one
       value or if there is only one value and that value is not "POST":

         # Always allow redirection.
         my $redir = have_lwp() ? [qw(GET HEAD POST)] : 1;
         Apache::TestRequest::user_agent(reset =&gt; 1,
                                         requests_redirectable =&gt; $redir);

       But note that redirection will <b>not</b> work with "POST" unless LWP is installed. It's best, therefore, to
       check "have_lwp" before running tests that rely on a redirection from "POST".

       Sometimes it is desirable to have "Apache::TestRequest" remember cookies sent by the pages you are
       testing and send them back to the server on subsequent requests. This is especially necessary when
       testing pages whose functionality relies on sessions or the presence of preferences stored in cookies.

       By default, "LWP::UserAgent" does <b>not</b> remember cookies between requests. You can tell it to remember
       cookies between request by adding:

         Apache::TestRequest::user_agent(cookie_jar =&gt; {});

       before issuing the requests.

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       "Apache::TestRequest" exports a number of functions that will likely prove convenient for use in the
       majority of your request tests.

   <b>Optional</b> <b>Parameters</b>
       Each function also takes a number of optional arguments.

       redirect_ok
           By  default a request will follow redirects retrieved from the server. To prevent this behavior, pass
           a false value to a "redirect_ok" parameter:

             my $res = GET $uri, redirect_ok =&gt; 0;

           Alternately, if all of your tests need to disable redirects, tell  "Apache::TestRequest"  to  use  an
           "LWP::UserAgent" object that disables redirects:

             Apache::TestRequest::user_agent( reset =&gt; 1,
                                              requests_redirectable =&gt; 0 );

       cert
           If  you  need  to  force  an  SSL  request  to use a particular SSL certificate, pass the name of the
           certificate via the "cert" parameter:

             my $res = GET $uri, cert =&gt; 'my_cert';

       content
           If you need to add content to your request, use the "content" parameter:

             my $res = GET $uri, content =&gt; 'hello world!';

       filename
           The name of a local file on the file system to be sent to the Apache test server via UPLOAD() and its
           friends.

   <b>The</b> <b>Functions</b>
       <u>GET</u>

         my $res = GET $uri;

       Sends a simple GET request to the Apache test server. Returns an "HTTP::Response" object.

       You can also supply additional headers to be sent with the request by adding their name/value pairs after
       the "url" parameter, for example:

         my $res = GET $url, 'Accept-Language' =&gt; 'de,en-us,en;q=0.5';

       <u>GET_STR</u>

       A shortcut function for "GET($uri)-&gt;as_string".

       <u>GET_BODY</u>

       A shortcut function for "GET($uri)-&gt;content".

       <u>GET_BODY_ASSERT</u>

       Use this function when your test is outputting content that you need to check, and you want to make  sure
       that  the  request  was  successful  before  comparing  the  contents  of the request. If the request was
       unsuccessful, "GET_BODY_ASSERT" will return an error message. Otherwise it will simply return the content
       of the request just as "GET_BODY" would.

       <u>GET_OK</u>

       A shortcut function for "GET($uri)-&gt;is_success".

       <u>GET_RC</u>

       A shortcut function for "GET($uri)-&gt;code".

       <u>GET_HEAD</u>

       Throws out the content of the request, and returns the string representation of the  request.  Since  the
       body  has been thrown out, the representation will consist solely of the headers. Furthermore, "GET_HEAD"
       inserts a "#" at the beginning of each line of the return string, so that the contents are  suitable  for
       printing to STDERR during your tests without interfering with the workings of "Test::Harness".

       <u>HEAD</u>

         my $res = HEAD $uri;

       Sends a HEAD request to the Apache test server. Returns an "HTTP::Response" object.

       <u>HEAD_STR</u>

       A shortcut function for "HEAD($uri)-&gt;as_string".

       <u>HEAD_BODY</u>

       A shortcut function for "HEAD($uri)-&gt;content". Of course, this means that it will likely return nothing.

       <u>HEAD_BODY_ASSERT</u>

       Use  this function when your test is outputting content that you need to check, and you want to make sure
       that the request was successful before comparing  the  contents  of  the  request.  If  the  request  was
       unsuccessful,  "HEAD_BODY_ASSERT"  will  return  an  error  message.  Otherwise it will simply return the
       content of the request just as "HEAD_BODY" would.

       <u>HEAD_OK</u>

       A shortcut function for "GET($uri)-&gt;is_success".

       <u>HEAD_RC</u>

       A shortcut function for "GET($uri)-&gt;code".

       <u>HEAD_HEAD</u>

       Throws out the content of the request, and returns the string representation of the  request.  Since  the
       body  has been thrown out, the representation will consist solely of the headers. Furthermore, "GET_HEAD"
       inserts a "#" at the beginning of each line of the return string, so that the contents are  suitable  for
       printing to STDERR during your tests without interfering with the workings of "Test::Harness".

       <u>PUT</u>

         my $res = PUT $uri;

       Sends a simple PUT request to the Apache test server. Returns an "HTTP::Response" object.

       <u>PUT_STR</u>

       A shortcut function for "PUT($uri)-&gt;as_string".

       <u>PUT_BODY</u>

       A shortcut function for "PUT($uri)-&gt;content".

       <u>PUT_BODY_ASSERT</u>

       Use  this function when your test is outputting content that you need to check, and you want to make sure
       that the request was successful before comparing  the  contents  of  the  request.  If  the  request  was
       unsuccessful, "PUT_BODY_ASSERT" will return an error message. Otherwise it will simply return the content
       of the request just as "PUT_BODY" would.

       <u>PUT_OK</u>

       A shortcut function for "PUT($uri)-&gt;is_success".

       <u>PUT_RC</u>

       A shortcut function for "PUT($uri)-&gt;code".

       <u>PUT_HEAD</u>

       Throws  out  the  content of the request, and returns the string representation of the request. Since the
       body has been thrown out, the representation will consist solely of the headers. Furthermore,  "PUT_HEAD"
       inserts  a  "#" at the beginning of each line of the return string, so that the contents are suitable for
       printing to STDERR during your tests without interfering with the workings of "Test::Harness".

       <u>POST</u>

         my $res = POST $uri, [ arg =&gt; $val, arg2 =&gt; $val ];

       Sends a POST request to the Apache test server and returns an "HTTP::Response" object. An array reference
       of parameters passed as the second argument will be submitted to the  Apache  test  server  as  the  POST
       content.  Parameters  corresponding  to  those  documented in Optional Parameters can follow the optional
       array reference of parameters, or after $uri.

       To upload a chunk of data, simply use:

         my $res = POST $uri, content =&gt; $data;

       <u>POST_STR</u>

       A shortcut function for "POST($uri, @args)-&gt;content".

       <u>POST_BODY</u>

       A shortcut function for "POST($uri, @args)-&gt;content".

       <u>POST_BODY_ASSERT</u>

       Use this function when your test is outputting content that you need to check, and you want to make  sure
       that  the  request  was  successful  before  comparing  the  contents  of the request. If the request was
       unsuccessful, "POST_BODY_ASSERT" will return an error  message.  Otherwise  it  will  simply  return  the
       content of the request just as "POST_BODY" would.

       <u>POST_OK</u>

       A shortcut function for "POST($uri, @args)-&gt;is_success".

       <u>POST_RC</u>

       A shortcut function for "POST($uri, @args)-&gt;code".

       <u>POST_HEAD</u>

       Throws  out  the  content of the request, and returns the string representation of the request. Since the
       body has been thrown out, the representation will consist solely of the headers. Furthermore, "POST_HEAD"
       inserts a "#" at the beginning of each line of the return string, so that the contents are  suitable  for
       printing to STDERR during your tests without interfering with the workings of "Test::Harness".

       <u>UPLOAD</u>

         my $res = UPLOAD $uri, \@args, filename =&gt; $filename;

       Sends  a  request  to the Apache test server that includes an uploaded file. Other POST parameters can be
       passed as a second argument as an array reference.

       "Apache::TestRequest" will read in the contents of the  file  named  via  the  "filename"  parameter  for
       submission  to  the  server.  If  you'd  rather,  you  can  submit use the "content" parameter instead of
       "filename", and its value will be submitted to the Apache server as file contents:

         my $res = UPLOAD $uri, undef, content =&gt; "This is file content";

       The name of the file sent to the server will simply be "b". Note that in this case, you cannot pass other
       POST arguments to UPLOAD() -- they would be ignored.

       <u>UPLOAD_BODY</u>

       A shortcut function for "UPLOAD($uri, @params)-&gt;content".

       <u>UPLOAD_BODY_ASSERT</u>

       Use this function when your test is outputting content that you need to check, and you want to make  sure
       that  the  request  was  successful  before  comparing  the  contents  of the request. If the request was
       unsuccessful, "UPLOAD_BODY_ASSERT" will return an error message. Otherwise  it  will  simply  return  the
       content of the request just as "UPLOAD_BODY" would.

       <u>OPTIONS</u>

         my $res = OPTIONS $uri;

       Sends  an  "OPTIONS" request to the Apache test server. Returns an "HTTP::Response" object with the <u>Allow</u>
       header, indicating which methods the server supports. Possible methods include "OPTIONS",  "GET",  "HEAD"
       and "POST". This function thus can be useful for testing what options the Apache server supports. Consult
       the HTTPD 1.1 specification, section 9.2, at <u><a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2616.html">http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2616.html</a></u> for more information.

   <b>URL</b> <b>Manipulation</b> <b>Functions</b>
       "Apache::TestRequest"  also  includes  a  few helper functions to aid in the creation of urls used in the
       functions above.

       <u>"module2path"</u>

         $path = Apache::TestRequest::module2path($module_name);

       Convert a module name to a path, safe for use in the various request methods above. e.g.  "::"  can't  be
       used in URLs on win32. For example:

         $path = Apache::TestRequest::module2path('Foo::Bar');

       returns:

         /Foo__Bar

       <u>"module2url"</u>

         $url = Apache::TestRequest::module2url($module);
         $url = Apache::TestRequest::module2url($module, \%options);

       Convert  a  module  name  to  a  full  URL  including the current configurations "hostname:port" and sets
       "module" accordingly.

         $url = Apache::TestRequest::module2url('Foo::Bar');

       returns:

         http://$hostname:$port/Foo__Bar

       The default scheme used is "http". You can override  this  by  passing  your  preferred  scheme  into  an
       optional second param. For example:

         $module = 'MyTestModule::TestHandler';
         $url = Apache::TestRequest::module2url($module, {scheme =&gt; 'https'});

       returns:

         https://$hostname:$port/MyTestModule__TestHandler

       You may also override the default path with a path of your own:

         $module = 'MyTestModule::TestHandler';
         $url = Apache::TestRequest::module2url($module, {path =&gt; '/foo'});

       returns:

         http://$hostname:$port/foo

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following environment variables can affect the behavior of "Apache::TestRequest":

       APACHE_TEST_PRETEND_NO_LWP
           If    the   environment   variable   "APACHE_TEST_PRETEND_NO_LWP"   is   set   to   a   true   value,
           "Apache::TestRequest" will pretend that LWP is not available so one can test whether the  test  suite
           will survive on a system which doesn't have libwww-perl installed.

       APACHE_TEST_HTTP_09_OK
           If  the  environment  variable "APACHE_TEST_HTTP_09_OK" is set to a true value, "Apache::TestRequest"
           will allow HTTP/0.9 responses from the server to proceed.  The default behavior  is  to  die  if  the
           response protocol is not either HTTP/1.0 or HTTP/1.1.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       Apache::Test is the main Apache testing module. Use it to set up your tests, create a plan, and to ensure
       that you have the Apache version and modules you need.

       Use Apache::TestMM in your <u>Makefile.PL</u> to set up your distribution for testing.
