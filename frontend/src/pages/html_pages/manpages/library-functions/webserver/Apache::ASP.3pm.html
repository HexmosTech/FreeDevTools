</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
         Apache::ASP - Active Server Pages for Apache with mod_perl

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         SetHandler  perl-script
         PerlModule  Apache::ASP
         PerlHandler Apache::ASP
         PerlSetVar  Global /tmp/asp

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Apache::ASP provides an Active Server Pages port to the Apache Web Server with Perl scripting only, and
       enables developing of dynamic web applications with session management and embedded Perl code.  There are
       also many powerful extensions, including XML taglibs, XSLT rendering, and new events not originally part
       of the ASP API!

       This module works under the Apache Web Server with the mod_perl module enabled. See <a href="http://www.apache.org">http://www.apache.org</a>
       and <a href="http://perl.apache.org">http://perl.apache.org</a> for further information.

       This is a portable solution, similar to ActiveState's PerlScript for NT/IIS ASP.  Work has been done and
       will continue to make ports to and from this implementation as smooth as possible.

       For Apache::ASP downloading and installation, please read the INSTALL section.  For installation
       troubleshooting check the FAQ and the SUPPORT sections.

       For database access, ActiveX, scripting languages, and other miscellaneous issues please read the FAQ
       section.

</pre><h4><b>WEBSITE</b></h4><pre>
       The Apache::ASP web site is at <a href="http://www.apache-asp.org/">http://www.apache-asp.org/</a> which you can also find in the ./site directory
       of the source distribution.

</pre><h4><b>INSTALL</b></h4><pre>
       The installation process for Apache::ASP is geared towards those with experience with Perl, Apache, and
       unix systems.  For those without this experience, please understand that the learning curve can be
       significant.  But what you have at the end will be a web site running on superior open source software.

       If installing onto a Windows operating system, please see the section titled Win32 Install.

   <b>Need</b> <b>Help</b>
       Often, installing the mod_perl part of the Apache server can be the hardest part.  If this is the case
       for you, check out the FAQ and SUPPORT sections for further help, as well as the "Modern Linux
       Distributions" notes in this section.

       Please also see the mod_perl site at <a href="http://perl.apache.org/">http://perl.apache.org/</a> which one ought to give a good read before
       undertaking a mod_perl project.

   <b>Download</b> <b>and</b> <b>CPAN</b> <b>Install</b>
       You may download the latest Apache::ASP from your nearest CPAN, and also:

         <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Apache-ASP/">http://search.cpan.org/dist/Apache-ASP/</a>
         <a href="http://cpan.org/modules/by-module/Apache/">http://cpan.org/modules/by-module/Apache/</a>

       As a Perl developer, you should make yourself familiar with the CPAN.pm module, and how it may be used to
       install Apache::ASP, and other related modules.  The easiest way to install Apache::ASP for the first
       time from Perl is to fire up the CPAN shell like:

        shell prompt&gt; perl -MCPAN -e shell
         ... configure CPAN ...
         ... then upgrade to latest CPAN ...
        cpan&gt; install CPAN
         ...
        cpan&gt; install Bundle::Apache::ASP

       Installing the Apache::ASP bundle will automatically install all the modules Apache::ASP is dependent on
       as well as Apache::ASP itself.  If you have trouble installing the bundle, then try installing the
       necessary modules one at a time:

        cpan&gt; install MLDBM
        cpan&gt; install MLDBM::Sync
        cpan&gt; install Digest::MD5  *** may not be needed for perl 5.8+ ***
        cpan&gt; install Apache::ASP

       For extra/optional functionality in Apache::ASP 2.31 or greater, like support for FormFill, XSLT, or SSI,
       you can install this bundle via CPAN:

         cpan&gt; install Bundle::Apache::ASP::Extra

   <b>Regular</b> <b>Perl</b> <b>Module</b> <b>Install</b>
       If not doing the CPAN install, download Apache::ASP and install it using the make or nmake commands as
       shown below.  Otherwise, just copy ASP.pm to $PERLLIB/site/Apache

         &gt; perl Makefile.PL
         &gt; make
         &gt; make test
         &gt; make install

         * use nmake for win32

       Please note that you must first have the Apache Web Server &amp; mod_perl installed before using this module
       in a web server environment.  The offline mode for building static html at ./cgi/asp-perl may be used
       with just perl.

   <b>Modern</b> <b>Linux</b> <b>Distributions</b>
       If you have a modern Linux distribution like CentOS or Ubuntu, you will likely have the easiest path by
       using the repository tools to automatically install mod_perl and Apache before installing Apache::ASP via
       CPAN.

       For example for CentOS, this will install mod_perl into your apache httpd, the latter likely being
       installed already by default on your server:

         bash&gt; sudo yum install mod_perl-devel.x86_64

       For Ubuntu this would be done like this:

         bash&gt; sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-perl2

   <b>Quick</b> <b>Start</b>
       Once you have successfully built the Apache Web Server with mod_perl, copy the ./site/eg/ directory from
       the Apache::ASP installation to your Apache document tree and try it out!  You must put "AllowOverride
       All" in your httpd.conf &lt;Directory&gt; config section to let the .htaccess file in the ./site/eg
       installation directory do its work.  If you want a starter config file for Apache::ASP, just look at the
       .htaccess file in the ./site/eg/ directory.

       So, you might add this to your Apache httpd.conf file just to get the scripts in ./site/eg working, where
       $DOCUMENT_ROOT represents the DocumentRoot config for your apache server:

         &lt;Directory $DOCUMENT_ROOT/asp/eg &gt;
           Options FollowSymLinks
           AllowOverride All
         &lt;/Directory&gt;

       To copy the entire site, including the examples, you might do a raw directory copy as in:

         shell&gt; cp -rpd ./site $DOCUMENT_ROOT/asp

       So you could then reference the Apache::ASP docs at /asp/ at your site, and the examples at /asp/eg/ .

       This is not a good production configuration, because it is insecure with the FollowSymLinks, and tells
       Apache to look for .htaccess which is bad for performance but it should be handy for getting started with
       development.

       You will know that Apache::ASP is working normally if you can run the scripts in ./site/eg/ without any
       errors.  Common problems can be found in the FAQ section.

   <b>Build</b> <b>static</b> <b>Apache</b> <b>and</b> <b>mod_perl</b> <b>for</b> <b>Apache</b> <b>1.3.x</b>
       For a quick build of apache, there is a script in the distribution at ./make_httpd/build_httpds.sh that
       can compile a statically linked Apache with mod_ssl and mod_perl.  Just drop the sources into the
       make_httpd directory, configure the environments as appropriate, and execute the script like this:

        make_httpd&gt; ./build_httpds.sh

       You might also find helpful a couple items:

         Stas's mod_perl guide install section
         <a href="http://perl.apache.org/guide/install.html">http://perl.apache.org/guide/install.html</a>

         Apache Toolbox
         <a href="http://www.apachetoolbox.com/">http://www.apachetoolbox.com/</a>

       People have been using Apache Toolbox to automate their complex builds of Apache 1.3.x with great
       success.

   <b>Win32</b> <b>/</b> <b>Windows</b> <b>Install</b>
       If you are on a Win32 platform, like WinNT or Windows 2000, you can download the win32 binaries linked to
       from:

         <a href="http://perl.apache.org/download/binaries.html">http://perl.apache.org/download/binaries.html</a>#Win32

       and install the latest perl-win32-bin-*.exe file.

       Randy Kobes has graciously provided these, which include compiled versions perl, mod_perl, apache,
       mod_ssl, as well as all the modules required by Apache::ASP and Apache::ASP itself.

       After installing this distribution, in Apache2\conf\perl.conf (pulled in via Apache2\conf\httpd.conf)
       there's directives that have Apache::ASP handle files placed under the Apache2\asp\ directory. There
       should be a sample Apache::ASP script there, printenv.html, accessed as
       <a href="http://127.0.0.1/asp/printenv.html">http://127.0.0.1/asp/printenv.html</a> which, if working, will print out your environment variables.

   <b>WinME</b> <b>/</b> <b>98</b> <b>/</b> <b>95</b> <b>flock()</b> <b>workaround</b>
       For those on desktop Windows operation systems, Apache::ASP v2.25 and later needs a special work around
       for the lack of <b>flock()</b> support on these systems.  Please add this to your Apache httpd.conf to fix this
       problem after mod_perl is installed:

         &lt;Perl&gt;
          *CORE::GLOBAL::flock = sub { 1 };
         &lt;/Perl&gt;
         PerlModule  Apache::ASP

       Please be sure to add this configuration before Apache::ASP is loaded via PerlModule, or a PerlRequire
       statement.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIG</b></h4><pre>
       You may use a &lt;Files ...&gt; directive in your httpd.conf Apache configuration file to make Apache::ASP
       start ticking.  Configure the optional settings if you want, the defaults are fine to get started.  The
       settings are documented below.  Make sure Global is set to where your web applications global.asa is if
       you have one!

        PerlModule  Apache::ASP
        &lt;Files ~ (\.asp)&gt;
          SetHandler  perl-script
          PerlHandler Apache::ASP
          PerlSetVar  Global .
          PerlSetVar  StateDir /tmp/asp
        &lt;/Files&gt;

       NOTE: do not use this for the examples in ./site/eg.  To get the examples working, check out the Quick
       Start section of INSTALL

       You may use other Apache configuration tags like &lt;Directory&gt;, &lt;Location&gt;, and &lt;VirtualHost&gt;, to
       separately define ASP configurations, but using the &lt;Files&gt; tag is natural for ASP application building
       because it lends itself naturally to mixed media per directory.  For building many separate ASP sites,
       you might want to use separate .htaccess files, or &lt;Files&gt; tags in &lt;VirtualHost&gt; sections, the latter
       being better for performance.

   <b>Core</b>
       Global
           Global is the nerve center of an Apache::ASP application, in which the global.asa may reside defining
           the web application's event handlers.

           This  directory  is  pushed  onto  @INC,  so  you  will  be able to "use" and "require" files in this
           directory, and perl modules developed for this application may be dropped into  this  directory,  for
           easy use.

           Unless  StateDir  is  configured,  this  directory must be some writable directory by the web server.
           $Session and $Application object state files will be  stored  in  this  directory.   If  StateDir  is
           configured, then ignore this paragraph, as it overrides the Global directory for this purpose.

           Includes,  specified  with &lt;!--#include file=somefile.inc--&gt; or $Response-&gt;<b>Include()</b> syntax, may also
           be in this directory, please see section on includes for more information.

             PerlSetVar Global <a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a>

       GlobalPackage
           Perl package namespace that all scripts,  includes,  &amp;  global.asa  events  are  compiled  into.   By
           default,  GlobalPackage  is  some  obscure  name that is uniquely generated from the file path of the
           Global directory, and global.asa file.  The use of explicitly naming the GlobalPackage  is  to  allow
           scripts access to globals and subs defined in a perl module that is included with commands like:

             in perl script: use Some::Package;
             in apache conf: PerlModule Some::Package

             PerlSetVar GlobalPackage Some::Package

       UniquePackages
           default 0.  Set to 1 to compile each script into its own perl package, so that subroutines defined in
           one script will not collide with another.

           By  default,  ASP  scripts  in  a web application are compiled into the *same* perl package, so these
           scripts, their includes, and the global.asa events all share common globals &amp; subroutines defined  by
           each  other.  The problem for some developers was that they would at times define a subroutine of the
           same name in 2+ scripts, and one subroutine definition would redefine the other one  because  of  the
           namespace collision.

             PerlSetVar UniquePackages 0

       DynamicIncludes
           default  0.  SSI file includes are normally inlined in the calling script, and the text gets compiled
           with the script as a whole.  With this option set to TRUE, file includes are compiled as  a  separate
           subroutine  and  called  when  the script is run.  The advantage of having this turned on is that the
           code compiled from the include can be shared between scripts, which keeps the script sizes smaller in
           memory, and keeps compile times down.

             PerlSetVar DynamicIncludes 0

       IncludesDir
           no defaults.  If set, this directory will also be used to look for includes when  compiling  scripts.
           By default the directory the script is in, and the Global directory are checked for includes.

           This  extension  was  added so that includes could be easily shared between ASP applications, whereas
           placing includes in the Global directory only allows sharing between scripts in an application.

             PerlSetVar IncludesDir .

           Also, multiple includes directories may be set by creating a directory list separated by a  semicolon
           ';' as in

             PerlSetVar IncludesDir ../shared;/usr/local/asp/shared

           Using  IncludesDir  in  this  way  creates  an  includes  search path that would look like ., Global,
           ../shared, /usr/local/asp/shared The current directory of  the  executing  script  is  checked  first
           whenever  an  include  is  specified,  then the Global directory in which the global.asa resides, and
           finally the IncludesDir setting.

       NoCache
           Default 0, if set to 1 will make it so that neither script nor include compilations are cached by the
           server.  Using this configuration will save on memory but will slow down  script  execution.   Please
           see the TUNING section for other strategies on improving site performance.

             PerlSetVar NoCache 0

   <b>State</b> <b>Management</b>
       NoState
           default  0,  if  true, neither the $Application nor $Session objects will be created.  Use this for a
           performance increase.  Please note that this setting takes precedence over the AllowSessionState  and
           AllowApplicationState settings.

             PerlSetVar NoState 0

       AllowSessionState
           Set  to  0  for  no  session  tracking,  1  by default If Session tracking is turned off, performance
           improves, but the $Session object is inaccessible.

             PerlSetVar AllowSessionState 1

           Note that if you want to dissallow session creation for certain non web  browser  user  agents,  like
           search engine spiders, you can use an init handler like:

             PerlInitHandler "sub { $_[0]-&gt;dir_config('AllowSessionState', 0) }"

       AllowApplicationState
           Default  1.   If  you  want  to  leave  $Application undefined, then set this to 0, for a performance
           increase of around 2-3%.  Allowing use of $Application is less expensive than $Session, as  there  is
           more  work  for the StateManager associated with $Session garbage collection so this parameter should
           be only used for extreme tuning.

             PerlSetVar AllowApplicationState 1

       StateDir
           default $Global/.state.  State files for ASP application go to this directory.  Where the state files
           go is the most important determinant in what makes  a  unique  ASP  application.   Different  configs
           pointing to the same StateDir are part of the same ASP application.

           The  default  has  not  changed since implementing this config directive.  The reason for this config
           option is to allow operating systems with caching file  systems  like  Solaris  to  specify  a  state
           directory  separately  from  the Global directory, which contains more permanent files.  This way one
           may point StateDir to /tmp/myaspapp, and make one's ASP application scream with speed.

             PerlSetVar StateDir ./.state

       StateManager
           default 10, this number specifies the numbers of times per SessionTimeout that timed out sessions are
           garbage  collected.   The  bigger  the  number,  the  slower  your  system,  but  the  more   precise
           Session_OnEnd's  will be run from global.asa, which occur when a timed out session is cleaned up, and
           the better able to withstand Session guessing hacking attempts.  The lower the number, the  faster  a
           normal system will run.

           The  defaults of 20 minutes for SessionTimeout and 10 times for StateManager, has dead Sessions being
           cleaned up every 2 minutes.

             PerlSetVar StateManager 10

       StateDB
           default SDBM_File, this is the internal  database  used  for  state  objects  like  $Application  and
           $Session.   Because  an  SDBM_File  %hash has a limit on the size of a record key+value pair, usually
           1024 bytes, you may want to use another tied database like DB_File or MLDBM::Sync::SDBM_File.

           With lightweight $Session and $Application use, you can get away with SDBM_File, but if you  load  it
           up with complex data like
             $Session{key} = { # very large complex object } you might max out the 1024 limit.

           Currently  StateDB  can be: SDBM_File, MLDBM::Sync::SDBM_File, DB_File, and GDBM_File.  Please let me
           know if you would like to add any more to this list.

           As of version .18, you may change this setting in  a  live  production  environment,  and  new  state
           databases  created  will be of this format.  With a prior version if you switch to a new StateDB, you
           would want to delete the old  StateDir,  as  there  will  likely  be  incompatibilities  between  the
           different database formats, including the way garbage collection is handled.

             PerlSetVar StateDB SDBM_File

       StateCache
           Deprecated  as  of  2.23.   There is no equivalent config for the functionality this represented from
           that version on.  The 2.23 release represented a significant rewrite of the state management,  moving
           to MLDBM::Sync for its subsystem.

       StateSerializer
           default  Data::Dumper, you may set this to Storable for faster serialization and storage of data into
           state objects.  This is particularly useful when storing large objects in $Session and  $Application,
           as  the  Storable.pm module has a faster implementation of freezing and thawing data from and to perl
           structures.  Note that if you are storing this much data in your state databases, you may want to use
           DB_File since it does not have the default 1024 byte limit that SDBM_File has on key/value lengths.

           This configuration setting may be changed in production as the state database's  serializer  type  is
           stored in the internal state manager which will always use Data::Dumper &amp; SDBM_File to store data.

             PerlSetVar StateSerializer Data::Dumper

   <b>Sessions</b>
       CookiePath
           URL  root that client responds to by sending the session cookie.  If your asp application falls under
           the server url "/asp", then you would set this variable  to  /asp.   This  then  allows  you  to  run
           different applications on the same server, with different user sessions for each application.

             PerlSetVar CookiePath /

       CookieDomain
           Default  0, this NON-PORTABLE configuration will allow sessions to span multiple web sites that match
           the same domain root.  This is useful if your web sites are hosted on the same machine and can  share
           the same StateDir configuration, and you want to shared the $Session data across web sites.  Whatever
           this is set to, that will add a

             ; domain=$CookieDomain

           part to the Set-Cookie: header set for the session-id cookie.

             PerlSetVar CookieDomain .your.global.domain

       SessionTimeout
           Default  20  minutes,  when  a  user's  session  has  been  inactive  for  this  period  of time, the
           Session_OnEnd event is run, if defined, for that session,  and  the  contents  of  that  session  are
           destroyed.

             PerlSetVar SessionTimeout 20

       SecureSession
           default  0.   Sets the secure tag for the session cookie, so that the cookie will only be transmitted
           by the browser under https transmissions.

             PerlSetVar SecureSession 1

       HTTPOnlySession
           default 0. Sets HttpOnly flag to session cookie to mitigate XSS attacks.  Supported  by  most  modern
           browsers, it only allows access to the session cookie by the server (ie NOT Javascript)

             PerlSetVar HTTPOnlySession 1

       ParanoidSession
           default  0.   When  true,  stores  the  user-agent header of the browser that creates the session and
           validates this against the session cookie presented.  If this check fails,  the  session  is  killed,
           with the rationale that there is a hacking attempt underway.

           This  config  option  was  implemented to be a smooth upgrade, as you can turn it off and on, without
           disrupting current sessions.  Sessions must be created with this turned on for the security  to  take
           effect.

           This  config  option is to help prevent a brute force cookie search from being successful. The number
           of possible cookies is huge, 2^128, thus making such a hacking attempt VERY  unlikely.   However,  on
           the  off  chance  that  such  an attack is successful, the hacker must also present identical browser
           headers to authenticate the session, or the session will be destroyed.  Thus the User-Agent acts as a
           backup to the real session id.  The IP address of the  browser  cannot  be  used,  since  because  of
           proxies, IP addresses may change between requests during a session.

           There are a few browsers that will not present a User-Agent header.  These browsers are considered to
           be browsers of type "Unknown", and this method works the same way for them.

           Most people agree that this level of security is unnecessary, thus it is titled paranoid :)

             PerlSetVar ParanoidSession 0

       SessionSerialize
           default  0, if true, locks $Session for duration of script, which serializes requests to the $Session
           object.  Only one script at a time may run, per user $Session, with sessions allowed.

           Serialized requests to the session object is the Microsoft ASP way, but is dangerous in a  production
           environment,  where  there  is risk of long-running or run-away processes.  If these things happen, a
           session may be locked for an indefinite period of time.  A user STOP button should  safely  quit  the
           session however.

             PerlSetVar SessionSerialize 0

       SessionCount
           default  0,  if  true  enables the $Application-&gt;SessionCount API which returns how many sessions are
           currently active in the application.  This config was created because  there  is  a  performance  hit
           associated with this count tracking, so it is disabled by default.

             PerlSetVar SessionCount 1

   <b>Cookieless</b> <b>Sessions</b>
       SessionQueryParse
           default  0,  if  true, will automatically parse the $Session session id into the query string of each
           local URL found in the $Response buffer.  For this setting  to  work  therefore,  buffering  must  be
           enabled.   This  parsing will only occur when a session cookie has not been sent by a browser, so the
           first script of a session enabled site, and scripts viewed by web browsers that have cookies disabled
           will trigger this behavior.

           Although this runtime parsing method is computationally expensive,  this  cost  should  be  amortized
           across  most  users  that  will  not  need this URL parsing.  This is a lazy programmer's dream.  For
           something more efficient, look  at  the  SessionQuery  setting.   For  more  information  about  this
           solution, please read the SESSIONS section.

             PerlSetVar SessionQueryParse 0

       SessionQueryParseMatch
           default  0,  set  to  a  regexp pattern that matches all URLs that you want to have SessionQueryParse
           parse in session ids.  By default SessionQueryParse only modifies local URLs, but if  you  name  your
           URLs  of  your  site with absolute URLs like <a href="http://localhost">http://localhost</a> then you will need to use this setting.
           So to match <a href="http://localhost">http://localhost</a> URLs, you might set this pattern to  ^<a href="http://localhost">http://localhost</a>.   Note  that  by
           setting this config, you are also setting SessionQueryParse.

             PerlSetVar SessionQueryParseMatch ^https?://localhost

       SessionQuery
           default  0,  if  set,  the session id will be initialized from the $Request-&gt;QueryString if not first
           found as a cookie.  You can use this setting coupled with the

             $Server-&gt;URL($url, \%params)

           API extension to generate local  URLs  with  session  ids  in  their  query  strings,  for  efficient
           cookieless  session support.  Note that if a browser has cookies disabled, every URL to any page that
           needs  access  to  $Session  will  need  to  be  created  by  this  method,  unless  you  are   using
           SessionQueryParse which will do this for you automatically.

             PerlSetVar SessionQuery 0

       SessionQueryMatch
           default  0,  set  to a regexp pattern that will match URLs for $Server-&gt;<b>URL()</b> to add a session id to.
           SessionQuery normally allows $Server-&gt;<b>URL()</b> to add session ids just to local  URLs,  so  if  you  use
           absolute   URL   references   like   <a href="http://localhost/">http://localhost/</a>  for  your  web  site,  then  just  like  with
           SessionQueryParseMatch, you might set this pattern to ^<a href="http://localhost">http://localhost</a>

           If this is set, then you don't need to set SessionQuery, as it will be set automatically.

             PerlSetVar SessionQueryMatch ^<a href="http://localhost">http://localhost</a>

       SessionQueryForce
           default 0, set to 1 if you want to disallow the use of cookies for session id passing, and only allow
           session ids to be passed on the query string via SessionQuery and SessionQueryParse settings.

             PerlSetVar SessionQueryForce 1

   <b>Developer</b> <b>Environment</b>
       UseStrict
           default 0, if set to 1, will compile all scripts, global.asa and includes with "use strict;" inserted
           at the head of the file, saving you from the painful process of strictifying code that was not strict
           to begin with.

           Because of how essential "use strict" programming is in a mod_perl environment, this default might be
           set to 1 one day, but this will be up for discussion before that decision is made.

           Note too that errors triggered by "use strict" are now captured as part  of  the  normal  Apache::ASP
           error  handling  when  this  configuration  is set, otherwise "use strict" errors will not be handled
           properly, so using UseStrict is better than your own "use strict" statements.

           PerlSetVar UseStrict 1

       Debug
           1 for server log debugging, 2 for extra client html output,  3  for  microtimes  logged.  Use  1  for
           production debugging, use 2 or 3 for development.  Turn off if you are not debugging.  These settings
           activate $Response-&gt;<b>Debug()</b>.

             PerlSetVar Debug 2

           If  Debug  3  is  set  and  Time::HiRes  is  installed,  microtimes will show up in the log, and also
           calculate the time between one $Response-&gt;<b>Debug()</b> and another, so good for a quick benchmark when you
           glance at the logs.

             PerlSetVar Debug 3

           If you would like to enable system level debugging, set Debug to a negative  value.   So  for  system
           level debugging, but no output to browser:

             PerlSetVar Debug -1

       DebugBufferLength
           Default  100,  set  this to the number of bytes of the buffered output's tail you want to see when an
           error occurs and Debug 2 or MailErrorsTo is set, and when BufferingOn is enabled.

           With buffering the script output will not naturally show up when the script errors, as  it  has  been
           buffered  by  the  $Response  object.  It helps to see where in the script output an error halted the
           script, so the last bytes of the buffered  output  are  included  with  the  rest  of  the  debugging
           information.

           For a demo of this functionality, try the ./site/eg/syntax_error.asp script, and turn buffering on.

       PodComments
           default  1.  With pod comments turned on, perl pod style comments and documentation are parsed out of
           scripts at compile time.  This make for great documentation and a nice debugging tool,  and  it  lets
           you comment out perl code and html in blocks.  Specifically text like this:

            =pod
            text or perl code here
            =cut

           will get ripped out of the script before compiling.  The =pod and =cut perl directives must be at the
           beginning of the line, and must be followed by the end of the line.

             PerlSetVar PodComments 1

       CollectionItem
           Enables PerlScript syntax like:

             $Request-&gt;Form('var')-&gt;Item;
             $Request-&gt;Form('var')-&gt;<a href="../man1/Item.1.html">Item</a>(1);
             $Request-&gt;Form('var')-&gt;Count;

           Old PerlScript syntax, enabled with

             use Win32::OLE qw(in valof with OVERLOAD);

           is like native syntax

             $Request-&gt;Form('var');

           Only in Apache::ASP, can the above be written as:

             $Request-&gt;{Form}{var};

           which you would do if you _really_ needed the speed.

   <b>XML</b> <b>/</b> <b>XSLT</b>
       XMLSubsMatch
           default  not  defined, set to some regexp pattern that will match all XML and HTML tags that you want
           to have perl subroutines handle.  The is Apache::ASP's custom tag technology,  and  can  be  used  to
           create powerful extensions to your XML and HTML rendering.

           Please see XML/XSLT section for instructions on its use.

             PerlSetVar XMLSubsMatch my:[\w\-]+

       XMLSubsStrict
           default 0, when set XMLSubs will only take arguments that are properly formed XML tag arguments like:

            &lt;my:sub arg1="value" arg2="value" /&gt;

           By default, XMLSubs accept arbitrary perl code as argument values:

            &lt;my:sub arg1=1+1 arg2=&amp;perl_sub()/&gt;

           which is not always wanted or expected.  Set XMLSubsStrict to 1 if this is the case.

             PerlSetVar XMLSubsStrict 1

       XMLSubsPerlArgs
           default  1,  when  set  attribute values will be interpreted as raw perl code so that these all would
           execute as one would expect:

            &lt;my:xmlsubs arg='1' arg2="2" arg3=$value arg4="1 $value" /&gt;

           With the 2.45  release,  0  may  be  set  for  this  configuration  or  a  more  ASP  style  variable
           interpolation:

            &lt;my:xmlsubs arg='1' arg2="2" args3="&lt;%= $value %&gt;" arg4="1 &lt;%= $value %&gt;" /&gt;

           This configuration is being introduced experimentally in version 2.45, as it will become the eventual
           default in the 3.0 release.

             PerlSetVar XMLSubsPerlArgs Off

       XSLT
           default  not  defined,  if  set to a file, ASP scripts will be regarded as XML output and transformed
           with the given XSL file with XML::XSLT.  This XSL file will also be executed as an ASP script  first,
           and its output will be the XSL data used for the transformation.  This XSL file will be executed as a
           dynamic include, so may be located in the current directory, Global, or IncludesDir.

           Please see the XML/XSLT section for an explanation of its use.

             PerlSetVar XSLT template.xsl

       XSLTMatch
           default  .*,  if  XSLT is set by default all ASP scripts will be XSL transformed by the specified XSL
           template.   This  regexp  setting  will  tell  XSLT  which  file  names  to  match  with  doing   XSL
           transformations, so that regular HTML ASP scripts and XML ASP scripts can be configured with the same
           configuration block.  Please see ./site/eg/.htaccess for an example of its use.

             PerlSetVar XSLTMatch \.xml$

       XSLTParser
           default  XML::XSLT, determines which perl module to use for XSLT parsing.  This is a new config as of
           2.11.  Also supported is XML::Sablotron which does not handle XSLT with the exact same output, but is
           about 10 times faster than XML::XSLT.  XML::LibXSLT may also be used as of version 2.29, and seems to
           be about twice again as fast as XML::Sablotron, and a very complete XSLT implementation.

       XSLTCache
           Activate XSLT file based caching through CacheDB,  CacheDir,  and  CacheSize  settings.   This  gives
           cached  XSLT  performance  near  AxKit  and  greater  than Cocoon.  XSLT caches transformations keyed
           uniquely by XML &amp; XSLT inputs.

             PerlSetVar XSLTCache 1

       XSLTCacheSize
           as of version 2.11, this config is no longer supported.

   <b>Caching</b>
       The output caching layer is a file dbm based output cache that runs on top of the MLDBM::Sync so inherits
       its performance characteristics.  With CacheDB set to MLDBM::Sync::SDBM_File, the  cache  layer  is  very
       fast  at  caching  entries  up  to  20K  in size, but for greater cached items, you should set CacheDB to
       another dbm like DB_File or GDBM_File.

       In order for the cache layer to function properly, whether for $Response-&gt;<b>Include()</b> output  caching,  see
       OBJECTS, or XSLT caching, see XML/XSLT, then Apache::ASP must be loaded in the parent httpd like so:

         # httpd.conf
         PerlModule Apache::ASP
           -- or --
         &lt;Perl&gt;
           use Apache::ASP;
         &lt;/Perl&gt;

       The cache layer automatically expires entries upon server restart, but for this to work, a $ServerID must
       be  computed  when  the  Apache::ASP  module gets loaded to store in each cached item.  Without the above
       done, each child httpd process will get its own $ServerID, so caching will not work at all.

       This said, output caching will not work in raw CGI mode, just running under mod_perl.

       CacheDB
           Like StateDB, sets dbm format for caching.  Since SDBM_File only support key/values pairs  of  around
           1K max in length, the default for this is MLDBM::Sync::SDBM_File, which is very fast for &lt; 20K output
           sizes.  For caching larger data than 20K, DB_File or GDBM_File are probably better to use.

             PerlSetVar CacheDB MLDBM::Sync::SDBM_File

           For  your  own benchmarks to test the relative speeds of the various DBMs under MLDBM::Sync, which is
           used by CacheDB, you may run the ./bench/bench_sync.pl script from the  MLDBM::Sync  distribution  on
           your system.

       CacheDir
           By  default,  the  cache directory is at StateDir/cache, but CacheDir can be used to set the StateDir
           value for caching purposes.  One may want the CacheDir separate from StateDir  for  example  StateDir
           might be a centrally network mounted file system, while CacheDir might be a local file cache.

             PerlSetVar CacheDir /tmp/asp_demo

           On  a  system like Solaris where there is a RAM disk mounted on the system like <a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a>, I could put the
           CacheDir there.  On a system like Linux where files are cached pretty well by default, this  is  less
           important.

       CacheSize
           By  default,  this is 10M of data per cache.  When any cache, like the XSLTCache, reaches this limit,
           the cache will be purged by deleting the cached dbm files entirely.  This is  better  for  long  term
           running  of  dbms  than  deleting  individual  records,  because  dbm  formats  will often degrade in
           performance with lots of insert &amp; deletes.

           Units of M, K, and B are supported for megabytes, kilobytes, and bytes, with the default  unit  being
           B, so the following configs all mean the same thing;

             PerlSetVar CacheSize 10M
             PerlSetVar CacheSize 10240K
             PerlSetVar CacheSize 10485760B
             PerlSetVar CacheSize 10485760

           There  are  2  caches currently, the XSLTCache, and the Response cache, the latter which is currently
           invoked for caching output from includes with special syntax.  See $Response-&gt;<b>Include()</b> for more info
           on the Response cache.

   <b>Miscellaneous</b>
       AuthServerVariables
           default 0. If you are using basic auth and would like $Request-&gt;ServerVariables set  like  AUTH_TYPE,
           AUTH_USER, AUTH_NAME, REMOTE_USER, &amp; AUTH_PASSWD, then set this and Apache::ASP will initialize these
           values  from  Apache-&gt;*auth*  commands.   Use of these environment variables keeps applications cross
           platform compatible as other servers set these too when performing basic 401 auth.

             PerlSetVar AuthServerVariables 0

       BufferingOn
           default 1, if true, buffers output through the response object.   $Response  object  will  only  send
           results  to  client  browser  if  a $Response-&gt;<b>Flush()</b> is called, or if the asp script ends.  Lots of
           output will need to be flushed incrementally.

           If false, 0, the output is immediately written to the client, CGI style.  There will be a performance
           hit server side if output is flushed automatically to the client, but is probably small.

           I would leave this on, since error handling is poor, if your asp script  errors  after  sending  only
           some of the output.

             PerlSetVar BufferingOn 1

       InodeNames
           Default  0.  Set  to  1  to uses a <b>stat()</b> call on scripts and includes to derive subroutine namespace
           based on device and inode numbers. In case of multiple symbolic links pointing  to  the  same  script
           this  will result in the script being compiled only once. Use only on unix flavours which support the
           <b>stat()</b> call that know about device and inode numbers.

             PerlSetVar InodeNames 1

       RequestParams
           Default 0, if set creates $Request-&gt;Params object with combined contents of $Request-&gt;QueryString and
           $Request-&gt;Form.  This is for developer convenience similar to CGI.pm's <b>param()</b> method.

             PerlSetVar RequestParams 1

       RequestBinaryRead
           Default On, if set to Off will not read POST data into $Request-&gt;<b>Form()</b>.

           One potential reason for configuring this to Off might be to initialize the Apache::ASP object in  an
           Apache  handler phase earlier than the normal PerlRequestHandler phase, so that it does not interfere
           with normal reading of POST data later in the request.

             PerlSetVar RequestBinaryRead On

       StatINC
           default 0, if true, reloads perl libraries that have changed on disk automatically for  ASP  scripts.
           If false, the www server must be restarted for library changes to take effect.

           A  known  bug  is  that  any  functions that are exported, e.g. confess Carp qw(confess), will not be
           refreshed by StatINC.  To refresh these, you must restart the www server.

           This setting should be used in development only because it is so slow.  For a production  version  of
           StatINC, see StatINCMatch.

             PerlSetVar StatINC 1

       StatINCMatch
           default undef, if defined, it will be used as a regular expression to reload modules that match as in
           StatINC.  This is useful because StatINC has a very high performance penalty in production, so if you
           can  narrow  the  modules that are checked for reloading each script execution to a handful, you will
           only suffer a mild performance penalty.

           The StatINCMatch setting should be a  regular  expression  like:  Struct|LWP  which  would  match  on
           reloading Class/Struct.pm, and all the LWP/.*  libraries.

           If you define StatINCMatch, you do not need to define StatINC.

             PerlSetVar StatINCMatch .*

       StatScripts
           default 1, if set to 0, changed scripts, global.asa, and includes will not be reloaded.  Coupled with
           Apache  mod_perl  startup  and  restart handlers executing Apache::ASP-&gt;<b>Loader()</b> for your application
           this allows your application to  be  frozen,  and  only  reloaded  on  the  next  server  restart  or
           stop/start.

           There  are  a  few  advantages for not reloading scripts and modules in production.  First there is a
           slight performance improvement by not having to <b>stat()</b> the script, its includes  and  the  global.asa
           every request.

           From  an application deployment standpoint, you also gain the ability to deploy your application as a
           snapshot taken when the server starts and restarts.  This provides  you  with  the  reassurance  that
           during  a  production  server  update from development sources, you do not have to worry with sources
           being used for the wrong libraries and such, while they are all being copied over.

           Finally, though you really should not do this, you can work on a live production application, with  a
           test  server  reloading changes, but your production server does see the changes until you restart or
           stop/start it.  This saves your public from syntax errors while you are just doing a quick bug fix.

             PerlSetVar StatScripts 1

       SoftRedirect
           default 0, if true, a $Response-&gt;<b>Redirect()</b> does not end the script.  Normally, when a <b>Redirect()</b>  is
           called,  the  script  is  ended automatically.  SoftRedirect 1, is a standard way of doing redirects,
           allowing for html output after the redirect is specified.

             PerlSetVar SoftRedirect 0

       Filter
           On/Off, default Off.  With filtering enabled, you can take advantage of  full  server  side  includes
           (SSI),  implemented  through  Apache::SSI.   SSI  is  implemented  through  this  mechanism  by using
           Apache::Filter.  A sample configuration for full SSI with filtering  is  in  the  ./site/eg/.htaccess
           file, with a relevant example script ./site/eg/ssi_filter.ssi.

           You  may  only  use  this  option  with  modperl v1.16 or greater installed and PERL_STACKED_HANDLERS
           enabled.  Filtering may be used in conjunction with other handlers that are also "filter aware".   If
           in doubt, try building your mod_perl with

             perl Makefile.PL EVERYTHING=1

           With filtering through Apache::SSI, you should expect near a a 20% performance decrease.

             PerlSetVar Filter Off

       CgiHeaders
           default  0.   When  true, script output that looks like HTTP / CGI headers, will be added to the HTTP
           headers of the request.  So you could add:
             Set-Cookie: test=message

             &lt;html&gt;...
           to the top of your script, and all the headers preceding a newline
           will be added as if with a call to $Response-&gt;AddHeader().  This
           functionality is here for compatibility with raw cgi scripts,
           and those used to this kind of coding.

           When set to 0, CgiHeaders style headers will not be parsed from the script response.

             PerlSetVar CgiHeaders 0

       Clean
           default 0, may be set between 1 and 9.  This setting determine how much text/html  output  should  be
           compressed.   A  setting  of  1  strips  mostly  white  space saving usually 10% in output size, at a
           performance cost of less than 5%.  A setting of 9 goes  much  further  saving  anywhere  25%  to  50%
           typically, but with a performance hit of 50%.

           This  config  option  is  implemented  via  HTML::Clean.  Per script configuration of this setting is
           available via the $Response-&gt;{Clean} property, which may also be set between 0 and 9.

             PerlSetVar Clean 0

       CompressGzip
           default 0, if true will gzip compress HTML output on the fly if Compress::Zlib is installed, and  the
           client  browser supports it.  Depending on the HTML being compressed, the client may see a 50% to 90%
           reduction in HTML output.  I have seen 40K of HTML squeezed down to just under 6K.  This will come at
           a 5%-20% hit to CPU usage per request compressed.

           Note there are some cases when a browser says it will accept gzip encoding, but then  not  render  it
           correctly.   This  behavior has been seen with IE5 when set to use a proxy but not using a proxy, and
           the URL does not end with a .html or .htm.  No work around has yet been found for this case so use at
           your own risk.

             PerlSetVar CompressGzip 1

       FormFill
           default 0, if true will auto fill HTML forms with values from $Request-&gt;<b>Form()</b>.   This  functionality
           is  provided by use of HTML::FillInForm.  For more information please see "perldoc HTML::FillInForm",
           and the example ./site/eg/formfill.asp.

           This feature can be enabled on a per form basis at runtime with $Response-&gt;{FormFill} = 1

             PerlSetVar FormFill 1

       TimeHiRes
           default 0, if set and Time::HiRes is installed, will do sub  second  timing  of  the  time  it  takes
           Apache::ASP  to  process a request.  This will not include the time spent in the session manager, nor
           modperl or Apache, and is only a rough approximation at best.

           If Debug is set also, you will get a comment in your HTML output that indicates the time it  took  to
           process that script.

           If  system  debugging is set with Debug -1 or -2, you will also get this time in the Apache error log
           with the other system messages.

   <b>Mail</b> <b>Administration</b>
       Apache::ASP has some powerful administrative email extensions that let you sleep at night,  knowing  full
       well  that  if  an error occurs at the web site, you will know about it immediately.  With these features
       already enabled, it was also easy to provide the $Server-&gt;Mail(\%mail) API extension which you  can  read
       up about in the OBJECTS section.

       MailHost
           The  mail  host is the smtp server that the below Mail* config directives will use when sending their
           emails.  By default Net::SMTP uses smtp mail hosts configured in Net::Config,  which  is  set  up  at
           install time, but this setting can be used to override this config.

           The  mail hosts specified in the Net::Config file will be used as backup smtp servers to the MailHost
           specified here, should this primary server not be working.

             PerlSetVar MailHost smtp.yourdomain.com.foobar

       MailFrom
           Default NONE, set this to specify the default mail address placed in the From: mail  header  for  the
           $Server-&gt;<b>Mail()</b> API extension, as well as MailErrorsTo and MailAlertTo.

             PerlSetVar MailFrom <a href="mailto:youremail@yourdomain.com.foobar">youremail@yourdomain.com.foobar</a>

       MailErrorsTo
           No default, if set, ASP server errors, error code 500, that result while compiling or running scripts
           under  Apache::ASP  will  automatically  be  emailed  to the email address set for this config.  This
           allows an administrator to have a rapid response to user generated server errors resulting from  bugs
           in production ASP scripts.  Other errors, such as 404 not found will be handled by Apache directly.

           An  easy  way  to  see  this  config  in  action  is to have an ASP script which calls a <b>die()</b>, which
           generates an internal ASP 500 server error.

           The Debug config of value 2 and this setting are mutually exclusive, as  Debug  2  is  a  development
           setting  where  errors are displayed in the browser, and MailErrorsTo is a production setting so that
           errors are silently logged and sent via email to the web admin.

             PerlSetVar MailErrorsTo <a href="mailto:youremail@yourdomain.com">youremail@yourdomain.com</a>

       MailAlertTo
           The address configured will have an email sent on any ASP server error 500, and the message  will  be
           short  enough  to  fit  on  a  text  based  pager.   This  config  setting  would  be used to give an
           administrator a heads up that a www server error occurred, as opposed to MailErrorsTo would  be  used
           for debugging that server error.

           This  config  does not work when Debug 2 is set, as it is a setting for use in production only, where
           Debug 2 is for development use.

             PerlSetVar MailAlertTo <a href="mailto:youremail@yourdomain.com">youremail@yourdomain.com</a>

       MailAlertPeriod
           Default 20 minutes, this config specifies the time in minutes over which there may be only one  alert
           email  generated  by  MailAlertTo.   The  purpose of MailAlertTo is to give the admin a heads up that
           there is an error at the www server.  MailErrorsTo is for to aid in speedy debugging of the incident.

             PerlSetVar MailAlertPeriod 20

   <b>File</b> <b>Uploads</b>
       FileUploadMax
           default 0, if set will limit file uploads to this size in bytes.  This is  currently  implemented  by
           setting  $CGI::POST_MAX  before  handling  the file upload.  Prior to this, a developer would have to
           hardcode a value for $CGI::POST_MAX to get this to work.

             PerlSetVar 100000

       FileUploadTemp
           default 0, if set will leave a temp file on disk  during  the  request,  which  may  be  helpful  for
           processing by other programs, but is also a security risk in that other users on the operating system
           could potentially read this file while the script is running.

           The  path  to  the temp file will be available at $Request-&gt;{FileUpload}{$form_field}{TempFile}.  The
           regular  use  of  file  uploads  remains  the  same  with  the  &lt;$filehandle&gt;  to   the   upload   at
           $Request-&gt;{Form}{$form_field}.   Please see the CGI section for more information on file uploads, and
           the $Request section in OBJECTS.

             PerlSetVar FileUploadTemp 0

</pre><h4><b>SYNTAX</b></h4><pre>
   <b>General</b>
       ASP embedding syntax allows one to embed code in html in 2 simple ways.  The first is the &lt;% xxx  %&gt;  tag
       in  which  xxx is any valid perl code.  The second is &lt;%= xxx %&gt; where xxx is some scalar value that will
       be inserted into the html directly.  An easy print.

         A simple asp page would look like:

         &lt;!-- sample here --&gt;
         &lt;html&gt;
         &lt;body&gt;
         For loop incrementing font size: &lt;p&gt;
         &lt;% for(1..5) { %&gt;
               &lt;!-- iterated html text --&gt;
               &lt;font size="&lt;%=$_%&gt;" &gt; Size = &lt;%=$_%&gt; &lt;/font&gt; &lt;br&gt;
         &lt;% } %&gt;
         &lt;/body&gt;
         &lt;/html&gt;
         &lt;!-- end sample here --&gt;

       Notice that your perl code blocks can span any html.  The for loop above iterates over the  html  without
       any special syntax.

   <b>XMLSubs</b>
       XMLSubs  allows  a  developer to define custom handlers for HTML &amp; XML tags, which can extend the natural
       syntax of the ASP environment.  Configured like:

         PerlSetVar XMLSubsMatch site:\w+

       A simple tag like:

         &lt;site:header title="Page Title" /&gt;

       can be constructed that could translate into:

         sub site::header {
             my $args = shift;
             print "&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;$args-&gt;{title}&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;\n";
             print "&lt;body bgcolor=white&gt;\n";
         }

       Better yet, one can use this functionality to trap and post process embedded HTML &amp; XML like:

         &lt;site:page title="Page Title"&gt;
           ... some HTML here ...
         &lt;/site:page&gt;

       and then:

         sub site::page {
           my($args, $html) = @_;
           &amp;site::header($args);
           $main::Response-&gt;Write($html);
           $main::Response-&gt;Write("&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;");
         }

       Though this could be used to fully render XML documents, it was not built for this purpose,  but  to  add
       powerful  tag  extensions  to HTML development environments.  For full XML rendering, you ought to try an
       XSLT approach, also supported by Apache::ASP.

   <b>Editors</b>
       As Apache::ASP supports a mixing of perl and HTML, any editor which supports development of  one  or  the
       other  would  work  well.   The  following  editors are known to work well for developing Apache::ASP web
       sites:

        * Emacs, in perl or HTML modes.  For a mmm-mode config
          that mixes HTML &amp; perl modes in a single buffer, check
          out the editors/mmm-asp-perl.el file in distribution.

        * Vim, special syntax support with editors/aasp.vim file in distribution.

        * UltraEdit32 ( <a href="http://www.ultraedit.com/">http://www.ultraedit.com/</a> ) has syntax highlighting,
          good macros and a configurable wordlist (so one can have syntax
          highlighting both for Perl and HTML).

       Please feel free to suggest your favorite development environment for this list.

</pre><h4><b>EVENTS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Overview</b>
       The ASP platform allows  developers  to  create  Web  Applications.   In  fulfillment  of  real  software
       requirements,  ASP  allows  event-triggered  actions to be taken, which are defined in a global.asa file.
       The global.asa file resides in the Global directory, defined as a  config  option,  and  may  define  the
       following actions:

               Action                  Event
               ------                  ------
               Script_OnStart *        Beginning of Script execution
               Script_OnEnd *          End of Script execution
               Script_OnFlush *        Before $Response being flushed to client.
               Script_OnParse *        Before script compilation
               Application_OnStart     Beginning of Application
               Application_OnEnd       End of Application
               Session_OnStart         Beginning of user Session.
               Session_OnEnd           End of user Session.

         * These are API extensions that are not portable, but were
           added because they are incredibly useful

       These actions must be defined in the $Global/global.asa file as subroutines, for example:

         sub Session_OnStart {
             $Application-&gt;{$Session-&gt;SessionID()} = started;
         }

       Sessions  are  easy  to  understand.  When visiting a page in a web application, each user has one unique
       $Session.  This session expires, after which the user will have a new $Session upon revisiting.

       A web application starts when the user visits a page in that application, and has a new $Session created.
       Right before the first $Session is created, the $Application is created.  When  the  last  user  $Session
       expires,  that  $Application  expires  also.   For  some  web  applications  that  are  always  busy, the
       Application_OnEnd event may never occur.

   <b>Script_OnStart</b> <b>&amp;</b> <b>Script_OnEnd</b>
       The script events are used to run any code for all scripts in an application  defined  by  a  global.asa.
       Often,  you  would  like  to run the same code for every script, which you would otherwise have to add by
       hand, or add with a file include, but with these events, just add your code to  the  global.asa,  and  it
       will be run.

       There  is  one caveat.  Code in Script_OnEnd is not guaranteed to be run when $Response-&gt;<b>End()</b> is called,
       since the program execution ends immediately at this event.  To always run critical  code,  use  the  API
       extension:

               $Server-&gt;RegisterCleanup()

   <b>Session_OnStart</b>
       Triggered  by  the  beginning  of  a user's session, Session_OnStart gets run before the user's executing
       script, and if the same session recently timed out, after the session's triggered Session_OnEnd.

       The Session_OnStart is particularly useful for caching database  data,  and  avoids  having  the  caching
       handled by clumsy code inserted into each script being executed.

   <b>Session_OnEnd</b>
       Triggered  by  a user session ending, Session_OnEnd can be useful for cleaning up and analyzing user data
       accumulated during a session.

       Sessions end when the session timeout expires, and the StateManager performs session cleanup.  The timing
       of the Session_OnEnd does not occur immediately after the session times out, but when  the  first  script
       runs after the session expires, and the StateManager allows for that session to be cleaned up.

       So  on  a  busy  site  with default SessionTimeout (20 minutes) and StateManager (10 times) settings, the
       Session_OnEnd for a particular session should be run near 22 minutes past the last activity that  Session
       saw.   A  site  infrequently visited will only have the Session_OnEnd run when a subsequent visit occurs,
       and theoretically the last session of an application ever run will never have its Session_OnEnd run.

       Thus I would not put anything mission-critical in the Session_OnEnd, just stuff that would be nice to run
       whenever it gets run.

   <b>Script_OnFlush</b>
       API extension. This event will be called prior to flushing the $Response buffer to the  web  client.   At
       this  time,  the  $Response-&gt;{BinaryRef}  buffer  reference  may be used to modify the buffered output at
       runtime to apply global changes to scripts output without having to modify all the scripts.

        sub Script_OnFlush {
          my $ref = $Response-&gt;{BinaryRef};
          $$ref =~ s/\s+/ /sg; # to strip extra white space
        }

       Check out the ./site/eg/global.asa for an example of its use.

   <b>Script_OnParse</b>
       This event allows one to set up a source filter on the script text, allowing one to change the script  on
       the  fly  before  the compilation stage occurs.  The script text is available in the $Server-&gt;{ScriptRef}
       scalar reference, and can be accessed like so:

        sub Script_OnParse {
          my $code = $Server-&gt;{ScriptRef}
          $$code .= " ADDED SOMETHING ";
        }

   <b>Application_OnStart</b>
       This event marks the beginning of an ASP application, and is run just before the Session_OnStart  of  the
       first  Session  of  an  application.  This event is useful to load up $Application with data that will be
       used in all user sessions.

   <b>Application_OnEnd</b>
       The end of the application is marked by this event, which is run after the last user  session  has  timed
       out for a given ASP application.

   <b>Server_OnStart</b> <b>(</b> <b>pseudo-event</b> <b>)</b>
       Some  might  want  something  like  a Server_OnStart event, where some code gets runs when the web server
       starts.  In mod_perl, this is easy to achieve outside of the scope of an ASP application, by putting some
       initialization code into a &lt;Perl&gt; section in the httpd.conf file.  Initializations that you would like to
       be shared with the child httpds are particularly useful, one such being the Apache::ASP-&gt;<b>Loader()</b> routine
       which you can read more about in the TUNING section - Precompile  Scripts  subsection.  It  is  could  be
       called like:

         # httpd.conf
         &lt;Perl&gt;
            Apache::ASP-&gt;Loader($path, $pattern, %config)
         &lt;/Perl&gt;

       So a &lt;Perl&gt; section is your Server_OnStart routine!

   <b>mod_perl</b> <b>handlers</b>
       If  one  wants to extend one's environment with mod_perl handlers, Apache::ASP does not stop this.  Basic
       use of Apache::ASP in fact only involves the content handler phase of mod_perl's PerlHandler, like

         SetHandler perl-script
         PerlModule Apache::ASP
         PerlHandler Apache::ASP

       But mod_perl allows for direct access to many more Apache  event  stages,  for  full  list  try  "perldoc
       mod_perl" or buy the mod_perl Eagle book.  Some commonly used ones are:

         PerlInitHandler
         PerlTransHandler
         PerlFixupHandler
         PerlHandler
         PerlLogHandler
         PerlCleanupHandler

       For  straight  Apache::ASP  programming,  there are some equivalents, say Script_OnStart event instead of
       Init/Fixup stages, or $Server-&gt;<b>RegisterCleanup()</b> for Log/Cleanup stages, but you can  do  things  in  the
       mod_perl handlers that you cannot do in Apache::ASP, especially if you want to handle all files globally,
       and not just ASP scripts.

       For  many  Apache::*  modules  for  use  with  mod_perl,  of  which  Apache::ASP  is  just one, check out
       <a href="http://perl.apache.org/src/apache-modlist.html">http://perl.apache.org/src/apache-modlist.html</a>

       To gain access to the ASP objects like $Session outside in a non-PerlHandler mod_perl  handler,  you  may
       use this API:

         my $ASP = Apache::ASP-&gt;new($r); # $r is Apache-&gt;request object

       as in this possible Authen handler:

         &lt;Perl&gt;
           use Apache::ASP;
           sub My::Auth::handler {
             my $r = shift;
             my $ASP = Apache::ASP-&gt;new($r)
             my $Session = $ASP-&gt;Session;
           }
         &lt;/Perl&gt;

       Here are some examples of do-it-yourself mod_perl handler programming...

        === Forbid Bad HSlide User Agent ===

        # httpd.conf
        PerlAccessHandler My::Access
        &lt;Perl&gt;
          sub My::Access::handler {
            my $r = shift;
            if($r-&gt;headers_in-&gt;{'USER_AGENT'} =~ /HSlide/) {
                403;
            } else {
                200;
            }
          }
        &lt;/Perl&gt;

        === Runtime Path Parsing ===

       This  example  shows  how  one  might  take  an arbitrary URL path /$path/$file.asp, and turn that into a
       runtime config for your site, so your scripts get executed always in your sites DocumentRoot.

        INPUT URL /SomeCategory/
        OUTPUT
         Script: index.asp
         $Server-&gt;Config('PATH') eq '/SomeCategory'

        INPUT URL /SomeCategory/index.asp
        OUTPUT
         Script: index.asp
         $Server-&gt;Config('PATH') eq '/SomeCategory'

        INPUT URI /index.asp
        OUTPUT
         Script: index.asp
         $Server-&gt;Config('PATH') eq ''

        # httpd.conf
        PerlTransHandler My::Init
        use lib qw( $custom_perllib );

        # $custom_perllib/My/Init.pm
        package My::Init;
        use strict;

</pre><h4><b>OBJECTS</b></h4><pre>
       The beauty of the ASP Object Model is that it takes the burden of CGI  and  Session  Management  off  the
       developer,  and  puts them in objects accessible from any ASP script &amp; include.  For the perl programmer,
       treat these objects as globals accessible from anywhere in your ASP application.

       The Apache::ASP object model supports the following:

         Object         Function
         ------         --------
         $Session      - user session state
         $Response     - output to browser
         $Request      - input from browser
         $Application  - application state
         $Server       - general methods

       These objects, and their methods are further defined in the following sections.

       If you would like to define your own global objects for  use  in  your  scripts  and  includes,  you  can
       initialize them in the global.asa Script_OnStart like:

        use vars qw( $Form $Site ); # declare globals
        sub Script_OnStart {
            $Site = My::Site-&gt;new;  # init $Site object
            $Form = $Request-&gt;Form; # alias form data
            $Server-&gt;RegisterCleanup(sub { # garbage collection
                                         $Site-&gt;DESTROY;
                                         $Site = $Form = undef;
                                     });
        }

       In this way you can create site wide application objects and simple aliases for common functions.

   <b>$Session</b> <b>Object</b>
       The  $Session  object  keeps  track  of  user  and  web  client  state, in a persistent manner, making it
       relatively easy to develop web applications.  The $Session state is stored across  HTTP  connections,  in
       database files in the Global or StateDir directories, and will persist across web server restarts.

       The user session is referenced by a 128 bit / 32 byte MD5 hex hashed cookie, and can be considered secure
       from session id guessing, or session hijacking.  When a hacker fails to guess a session, the system times
       out  for  a  second, and with 2**128 (3.4e38) keys to guess, a hacker will not be guessing an id any time
       soon.

       If an incoming cookie matches a timed out or non-existent session, a new  session  is  created  with  the
       incoming id.  If the id matches a currently active session, the session is tied to it and returned.  This
       is also similar to the Microsoft ASP implementation.

       The $Session reference is a hash ref, and can be used as such to store data as in:

           $Session-&gt;{count}++;        # increment count by one
           %{$Session} = ();   # clear $Session data

       The  $Session object state is implemented through MLDBM, and a user should be aware of the limitations of
       MLDBM.  Basically, you can read complex structures, but not write them, directly:

         $data = $Session-&gt;{complex}{data};     # Read ok.
         $Session-&gt;{complex}{data} = $data;     # Write NOT ok.
         $Session-&gt;{complex} = {data =&gt; $data}; # Write ok, all at once.

       Please see MLDBM for more information on this topic.  $Session can also be used for the following methods
       and properties:

       $Session-&gt;{CodePage}
           Not implemented.  May never be until someone needs it.

       $Session-&gt;{LCID}
           Not implemented.  May never be until someone needs it.

       $Session-&gt;{SessionID}
           SessionID property, returns the id for the current session, which is exchanged between the client and
           the server as a cookie.

       $Session-&gt;{Timeout} [= $minutes]
           Timeout property, if minutes is being assigned, sets this default timeout for the user session,  else
           returns the current session timeout.

           If  a  user session is inactive for the full timeout, the session is destroyed by the system.  No one
           can access the session after it times out, and the system garbage collects it eventually.

       $Session-&gt;<b>Abandon()</b>
           The abandon method times out the session immediately.  All Session data is cleared  in  the  process,
           just as when any session times out.

       $Session-&gt;<b>Lock()</b>
           API extension. If you are about to use $Session for many consecutive reads or writes, you can improve
           performance by explicitly locking $Session, and then unlocking, like:

             $Session-&gt;Lock();
             $Session-&gt;{count}++;
             $Session-&gt;{count}++;
             $Session-&gt;{count}++;
             $Session-&gt;UnLock();

           This  sequence  causes $Session to be locked and unlocked only 1 time, instead of the 6 times that it
           would be locked otherwise, 2 for each increment with one to read and one to write.

           Because of flushing issues with SDBM_File and DB_File databases, each lock actually ties fresh to the
           database, so the performance savings here can be considerable.

           Note that if you have SessionSerialize set, $Session is already locked  for  each  script  invocation
           automatically,  as  if  you  had  called $Session-&gt;<b>Lock()</b> in Script_OnStart.  Thus you do not need to
           worry about $Session locking for performance.  Please read the section on SessionSerialize  for  more
           info.

       $Session-&gt;<b>UnLock()</b>
           API  Extension.  Unlocks the $Session explicitly.  If you do not call this, $Session will be unlocked
           automatically at the end of the script.

   <b>$Response</b> <b>Object</b>
       This object manages the output from the ASP Application and the client web browser.  It  does  not  store
       state information like the $Session object but does have a wide array of methods to call.

       $Response-&gt;{BinaryRef}
           API  extension.  This  is a perl reference to the buffered output of the $Response object, and can be
           used in the Script_OnFlush global.asa event to modify the buffered output at runtime to apply  global
           changes  to scripts output without having to modify all the scripts.  These changes take place before
           content is flushed to the client web browser.

            sub Script_OnFlush {
              my $ref = $Response-&gt;{BinaryRef};
              $$ref =~ s/\s+/ /sg; # to strip extra white space
            }

           Check out the ./site/eg/global.asa for an example of its use.

       $Response-&gt;{Buffer}
           Default 1, when TRUE sends output from script to client only at the end  of  processing  the  script.
           When 0, response is not buffered, and client is sent output as output is generated by the script.

       $Response-&gt;{CacheControl}
           Default  "private",  when  set  to  public  allows  proxy servers to cache the content.  This setting
           controls the value set in the HTTP header Cache-Control

       $Response-&gt;{Charset}
           This  member  when  set  appends  itself  to  the  value  of  the  Content-Type  HTTP   header.    If
           $Response-&gt;{Charset} = 'ISO-LATIN-1' is set, the corresponding header would look like:

             Content-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-LATIN-1

       $Response-&gt;{Clean} = 0-9;
           API  extension.  Set  the  Clean  level,  default  0, on a per script basis.  Clean of 1-9 compresses
           text/html output.  Please see the Clean config option for more information. This setting may also  be
           useful even if using compression to obfuscate HTML.

       $Response-&gt;{ContentType} = "text/html"
           Sets the MIME type for the current response being sent to the client.  Sent as an HTTP header.

       $Response-&gt;{Debug} = 1|0
           API  extension.   Default  set  to  value  of  Debug  config.  May be used to temporarily activate or
           inactivate $Response-&gt;<b>Debug()</b> behavior.  Something like:

            {
              local $Response-&gt;{Debug} = 1;
              $Response-&gt;Debug($values);
            }

           maybe be used to always log something.  The <b>Debug()</b> method can be better than  <b>AppendToLog()</b>  because
           it will log data in data structures one level deep, whereas AppendToLog prints just raw string/scalar
           values.

       $Response-&gt;{Expires} = $time
           Sends  a  response  header to the client indicating the $time in SECONDS in which the document should
           expire.  A time of 0 means immediate expiration.  The header generated is a standard HTTP date  like:
           "Wed, 09 Feb 1994 22:23:32 GMT".

       $Response-&gt;{ExpiresAbsolute} = $date
           Sends  a response header to the client with $date being an absolute time to expire.  Formats accepted
           are all those accepted by <b>HTTP::Date::str2time()</b>, e.g.

            "Wed, 09 Feb 1994 22:23:32 GMT"     -- HTTP format
            "Tuesday, 08-Feb-94 14:15:29 GMT"   -- old rfc850 HTTP format

            "08-Feb-94"       -- old rfc850 HTTP format
            "09 Feb 1994"     -- proposed new HTTP format

            "Feb  3  1994"    -- Unix 'ls -l' format
            "Feb  3 17:03"    -- Unix 'ls -l' format

       $Response-&gt;{FormFill} = 0|1
           If true, HTML forms generated by the script output will be auto filled with data from $Request-&gt;Form.
           This feature requires HTML::FillInForm to be installed.  Please see  the  FormFill  CONFIG  for  more
           information.

           This setting overrides the FormFill config at runtime for the script execution only.

       $Response-&gt;{IsClientConnected}
           1  if  web client is connected, 0 if not.  This value starts set to 1, and will be updated whenever a
           $Response-&gt;<b>Flush()</b> is called.  If BufferingOn is set, by  default  $Response-&gt;<b>Flush()</b>  will  only  be
           called at the end of the HTML output.

           As  of  version  2.23  this value is updated correctly before global.asa Script_OnStart is called, so
           global script termination may be correctly handled during that event, which one might want to do with
           excessive user STOP/RELOADS when the web server is very busy.

           An API extension $Response-&gt;IsClientConnected may be called for refreshed connection  status  without
           calling first a $Response-&gt;Flush

       $Response-&gt;{PICS}
           If  this property has been set, a PICS-Label HTTP header will be sent with its value.  For those that
           do not know, PICS is a header that is useful in rating the internet.   It  stands  for  Platform  for
           Internet Content Selection, and you can find more info about it at: <a href="http://www.w3.org">http://www.w3.org</a>

       $Response-&gt;{Status} = $status
           Sets  the  status code returned by the server.  Can be used to set messages like 500, internal server
           error

       $Response-&gt;AddHeader($name, $value)
           Adds a custom header to a web page.  Headers are sent only before any text  from  the  main  page  is
           sent, so if you want to set a header after some text on a page, you must turn BufferingOn.

       $Response-&gt;AppendToLog($message)
           Adds $message to the server log.  Useful for debugging.

       $Response-&gt;BinaryWrite($data)
           Writes   binary   data   to  the  client.   The  only  difference  from  $Response-&gt;<b>Write()</b>  is  that
           $Response-&gt;<b>Flush()</b> is called internally first, so the data  cannot  be  parsed  as  an  html  header.
           Flushing flushes the header if has not already been written.

           If  you  have  set the $Response-&gt;{ContentType} to something other than text/html, cgi header parsing
           (see CGI notes), will be automatically be turned off,  so  you  will  not  necessarily  need  to  use
           BinaryWrite for writing binary data.

           For an example of BinaryWrite, see the binary_write.htm example in ./site/eg/binary_write.htm

           Please  note that if you are on Win32, you will need to call binmode on a file handle before reading,
           if its data is binary.

       $Response-&gt;<b>Clear()</b>
           Erases buffered ASP output.

       $Response-&gt;Cookies($name, [$key,] $value)
           Sets the key or attribute of cookie with name $name to the value $value.  If $key is not defined, the
           Value of the cookie is set.  ASP CookiePath is assumed to be / in these examples.

            $Response-&gt;Cookies('name', 'value');
             --&gt; Set-Cookie: name=value; path=/

            $Response-&gt;Cookies("Test", "data1", "test value");
            $Response-&gt;Cookies("Test", "data2", "more test");
            $Response-&gt;Cookies(
                   "Test", "Expires",
                   &amp;HTTP::Date::time2str(time+86400)
                   );
            $Response-&gt;Cookies("Test", "Secure", 1);
            $Response-&gt;Cookies("Test", "Path", "/");
            $Response-&gt;Cookies("Test", "Domain", "host.com");
             --&gt;   Set-Cookie:Test=data1=test%20value&amp;data2=more%20test;   \
                           expires=Fri, 23 Apr 1999 07:19:52 GMT;          \
                           path=/; domain=host.com; secure

           The latter use of $key in the cookies not only sets cookie  attributes  such  as  Expires,  but  also
           treats the cookie as a hash of key value pairs which can later be accesses by

            $Request-&gt;Cookies('Test', 'data1');
            $Request-&gt;Cookies('Test', 'data2');

           Because  this  is  perl, you can (NOT PORTABLE) reference the cookies directly through hash notation.
           The same 5 commands above could be compressed to:

            $Response-&gt;{Cookies}{Test} =
                   {
                           Secure  =&gt; 1,
                           Value   =&gt;
                                   {
                                           data1 =&gt; 'test value',
                                           data2 =&gt; 'more test'
                                   },
                           Expires =&gt; 86400, # not portable, see above
                           Domain  =&gt; 'host.com',
                           Path    =&gt; '/'
                   };

           and the first command would be:

            # you don't need to use hash notation when you are only setting
            # a simple value
            $Response-&gt;{Cookies}{'Test Name'} = 'Test Value';

           I prefer the hash notation for cookies, as this looks nice, and is quite  perlish.   It  is  here  to
           stay.   The <b>Cookie()</b> routine is very complex and does its best to allow access to the underlying hash
           structure of the data.  This is the best emulation I could write  trying  to  match  the  Collections
           functionality of cookies in IIS ASP.

           For      more      information     on     Cookies,     please     go     to     the     source     at
           <a href="http://home.netscape.com/newsref/std/cookie_spec.html">http://home.netscape.com/newsref/std/cookie_spec.html</a>

       $Response-&gt;Debug(@args)
           API Extension. If the Debug config option is set greater than 0, this routine will write @args out to
           server error log.  refs in @args will be expanded one level deep, so data in simple  data  structures
           like one-level hash refs and array refs will be displayed.  CODE refs like

            $Response-&gt;Debug(sub { "some value" });

           will  be  executed and their output added to the debug output.  This extension allows the user to tie
           directly into the debugging capabilities of this module.

           While developing an app on a production server, it is often useful to have a separate error  log  for
           the  application  to  catch  debugging output separately.  One way of implementing this is to use the
           Apache ErrorLog configuration directive to create a separate error log for a virtual host.

           If you want further debugging support, like stack traces in your code, consider doing things like:

            $Response-&gt;Debug( sub { Carp::longmess('debug trace') };
            $SIG{__WARN__} = \&amp;Carp::cluck; # then warn() will stack trace

           The only way at present to see exactly where in your script an error occurred is  to  set  the  Debug
           config directive to 2, and match the error line number to perl script generated from your ASP script.

           However,  as  of  version  0.10,  the  perl  script generated from the asp script should match almost
           exactly line by line, except in cases of inlined includes, which add to  the  text  of  the  original
           script,  pod  comments which are entirely yanked out, and &lt;% # comment %&gt; style comments which have a
           \n added to them so they still work.

           If you would like to see  the  HTML  preceding  an  error  while  developing,  consider  setting  the
           BufferingOn config directive to 0.

       $Response-&gt;<b>End()</b>
           Sends  result to client, and immediately exits script.  Automatically called at end of script, if not
           already called.

       $Response-&gt;ErrorDocument($code, $uri)
           API extension that allows for the modification the Apache ErrorDocument at runtime.  $uri may be a on
           site document, off site URL, or string containing the error message.

           This extension is useful if you want to have scripts set error codes  with  $Response-&gt;{Status}  like
           401  for  authentication  failure,  and  to then control from the script what the error message looks
           like.

           For more information on the Apache ErrorDocument mechanism, please  see  ErrorDocument  in  the  CORE
           Apache settings, and the Apache-&gt;<b>custom_response()</b> API, for which this method is a wrapper.

       $Response-&gt;<b>Flush()</b>
           Sends buffered output to client and clears buffer.

       $Response-&gt;Include($filename, @args)
           This API extension calls the routine compiled from asp script in $filename with the args @args.  This
           is a direct translation of the SSI tag

             &lt;!--#include file=$filename args=@args--&gt;

           Please see the SSI section for more on SSI in general.

           This  API  extension  was  created to allow greater modularization of code by allowing includes to be
           called with runtime arguments.  Files included are compiled once, and the  anonymous  code  ref  from
           that  compilation  is  cached,  thus  including  a  file  in  this manner is just like calling a perl
           subroutine.  The @args can be found in @_ in the includes like:

             # include.inc
             &lt;% my @args = @_; %&gt;

           As of 2.23, multiple return values can be returned from an include like:

            my @rv = $Response-&gt;Include($filename, @args);

       $Response-&gt;Include(\%cache_args, @sub_args) *CACHE API*
           As of version 2.23, output from an include may be cached  with  this  API  and  the  CONFIG  settings
           CacheDir  &amp;  CacheDB.   This  can be used to execute expensive includes only rarely where applicable,
           drastically increasing performance in some cases.

           This API extension applies to the entire include family:

             my @rv = $Response-&gt;Include(\%cache_args, @include_args)
             my $html_ref = $Response-&gt;TrapInclude(\%cache_args, @include_args)
             $Server-&gt;Execute(\%cache_args, @include_args)

           For this output cache to work, you must load Apache::ASP in the Apache parent httpd like so:

             # httpd.conf
             PerlModule Apache::ASP

           The cache arguments are shown here

             $Response-&gt;Include({
               File =&gt; 'file.inc',
               Cache =&gt; 1, # to activate cache layer
               Expires =&gt; 3600, # to expire in one hour
               LastModified =&gt; time() - 600, # to expire if cached before 10 minutes ago
               Key =&gt; $Request-&gt;Form, # to cache based on checksum of serialized form data,
               Clear =&gt; 1, # always executes include &amp; cache output
             }, @include_args);

             File - include file to execute, can be file name or \$script
               script data passed in as a string reference.

             Cache - activate caching, will run like normal include without this

             Expires - only cache for this long in seconds

             LastModified - if cached before this time(), expire

             Key - The cache item identity.  Can be $data, \$data, \%data, \@data,
               this data is serialized and combined with the filename &amp; @include_args
               to create a MD5 checksum to fetch from the cache with. If you wanted
               to cache the results of a search page from form data POSTed,
               then this key could be

                 { Key =&gt; $Request-&gt;Form }

             Clear - If set to 1, or boolean true, will always execute the include
               and update the cache entry for it.

           Motivation: If an include takes 1 second to execute because of complex SQL to a database, and you can
           cache the output of this include because it is not realtime data, and the cache  layer  runs  at  .01
           seconds,  then  you  have  a  100  fold  savings on that part of the script.  Site scalability can be
           dramatically increased in this way by intelligently caching bottlenecks in the web application.

           Use Sparingly: If you have a fast include, then it may execute faster than the cache layer  runs,  in
           which  case  you  may  actually slow your site down by using this feature.  Therefore try to use this
           sparingly, and only when sure you  really  need  it.   Apache::ASP  scripts  generally  execute  very
           quickly, so most developers will not need to use this feature at all.

       $Response-&gt;Include(\$script_text, @args)
           Added  in  Apache::ASP  2.11,  this  method  allows  for  executing  ASP  scripts  that are generated
           dynamically by passing in a reference to the script data instead of the file name.  This  works  just
           like  the  normal  $Response-&gt;<b>Include()</b>  API,  except  a  string  reference is passed in instead of a
           filename.  For example:

             &lt;%
               my $script = "&lt;\% print 'TEST'; %\&gt;";
               $Response-&gt;Include(\$script);
             %&gt;

           This include would output TEST.  Note that tokens like &lt;% and %&gt; must be escaped so Apache::ASP  does
           not  try  to  compile  those code blocks directly when compiling the original script.  If the $script
           data were fetched directly from some external resource like a database, then these tokens  would  not
           need to be escaped at all as in:

             &lt;%
               my $script = $dbh-&gt;selectrow_array(
                  "select script_text from scripts where script_id = ?",
                  undef, $script_id
                  );
               $Response-&gt;Include(\$script);
             %&gt;

           This  method could also be used to render other types of dynamic scripts, like XML docs using XMLSubs
           for example, though for complex runtime XML rendering, one should use something  better  suited  like
           XSLT.  See the $Server-&gt;XSLT API for more on this topic.

       $Response-&gt;<b>IsClientConnected()</b>
           API  Extension.   1  for web client still connected, 0 if disconnected which might happen if the user
           hits the stop button.  The original API for this $Response-&gt;{IsClientConnected} is only updated after
           a $Response-&gt;Flush is called, so this method may be called for a refreshed status.

           Note $Response-&gt;Flush calls $Response-&gt;IsClientConnected to update $Response-&gt;{IsClientConnected}  so
           to use this you are going straight to the source!  But if you are doing a loop like:

             while(@data) {
               $Response-&gt;End if ! $Response-&gt;{IsClientConnected};
               my $row = shift @data;
               %&gt; &lt;%= $row %&gt; &lt;%
               $Response-&gt;Flush;
             }

           Then  its more efficient to use the member instead of the method since $Response-&gt;<b>Flush()</b> has already
           updated that value for you.

       $Response-&gt;Redirect($url)
           Sends the client a command to go to a different url $url.  Script immediately ends.

       $Response-&gt;TrapInclude($file, @args)
           Calls $Response-&gt;<b>Include()</b> with same arguments as passed to it, but instead traps the include  output
           buffer  and  returns  it  as  as  a perl string reference.  This allows one to postprocess the output
           buffer before sending to the client.

             my $string_ref = $Response-&gt;TrapInclude('file.inc');
             $$string_ref =~ s/\s+/ /sg; # squash whitespace like Clean 1
             print $$string_ref;

           The data is returned as a referenece to save  on  what  might  be  a  large  string  copy.   You  may
           dereference the data with the $$string_ref notation.

       $Response-&gt;Write($data)
           Write  output  to  the HTML page.  &lt;%=$data%&gt; syntax is shorthand for a $Response-&gt;Write($data).  All
           final output to the client must at some point go through this method.

   <b>$Request</b> <b>Object</b>
       The request object manages the input from the client browser, like posts, query  strings,  cookies,  etc.
       Normal return results are values if an index is specified, or a collection / perl hash ref if no index is
       specified.   WARNING,  the  latter property is not supported in ActiveState PerlScript, so if you use the
       hashes returned by such a technique, it will not be portable.

       A normal use of this feature would be to iterate through the form variables in the form hash...

        $form = $Request-&gt;Form();
        for(keys %{$form}) {
               $Response-&gt;Write("$_: $form-&gt;{$_}&lt;br&gt;\n");
        }

       Please see the ./site/eg/server_variables.htm asp file for this method in action.

       Note that if a form POST or query string contains duplicate values  for  a  key,  those  values  will  be
       returned through normal use of the $Request object:

         @values = $Request-&gt;Form('key');

       but you can also access the internal storage, which is an array reference like so:

         $array_ref = $Request-&gt;{Form}{'key'};
         @values = @{$array_ref};

       Please  read  the  PERLSCRIPT  section  for more information on how things like $Request-&gt;<b>QueryString()</b> &amp;
       $Request-&gt;<b>Form()</b> behave as collections.

       $Request-&gt;{Method}
           API extension.  Returns the client HTTP request method, as in GET or POST.  Added in version 2.31.

       $Request-&gt;{TotalBytes}
           The amount of data sent by the client in the body of the request, usually  the  length  of  the  form
           data.  This is the same value as $Request-&gt;ServerVariables('CONTENT_LENGTH')

       $Request-&gt;BinaryRead([$length])
           Returns  a  string  whose contents are the first $length bytes of the form data, or body, sent by the
           client request.  If $length is not given, will return all of the form data.  This  data  is  the  raw
           data sent by the client, without any parsing done on it by Apache::ASP.

           Note   that   BinaryRead   will   not   return   any   data   for   file  uploads.   Please  see  the
           $Request-&gt;<b>FileUpload()</b> interface for access  to  this  data.   $Request-&gt;<b>Form()</b>  data  will  also  be
           available as normal.

       $Request-&gt;<b>ClientCertificate()</b>
           Not implemented.

       $Request-&gt;Cookies($name [,$key])
           Returns  the value of the Cookie with name $name.  If a $key is specified, then a lookup will be done
           on the cookie as if it were a query string.  So, a cookie set by:

            Set-Cookie: test=data1=1&amp;data2=2

           would have a value of 2 returned by $Request-&gt;Cookies('test','data2').

           If no name is specified, a hash will be returned of cookie names as keys and cookie values as values.
           If the cookie value is a query string, it will automatically be parsed, and the value will be a  hash
           reference to these values.

           When  in  doubt,  try  it  out.   Remember that unless you set the Expires attribute of a cookie with
           $Response-&gt;Cookies('cookie', 'Expires', $xyz), the cookies that you set  will  only  last  until  you
           close  your  browser,  so  you may find your self opening &amp; closing your browser a lot when debugging
           cookies.

           For more information on cookies in ASP, please read $Response-&gt;<b>Cookies()</b>

       $Request-&gt;FileUpload($form_field, $key)
           API  extension.   The  FileUpload  interface  to  file  upload  data  is  stabilized.   The  internal
           representation  of  the  file  uploads  is  a  hash  of hashes, one hash per file upload found in the
           $Request-&gt;<b>Form()</b> collection.  This collection of  collections  may  be  queried  through  the  normal
           interface like so:

             $Request-&gt;FileUpload('upload_file', 'ContentType');
             $Request-&gt;FileUpload('upload_file', 'FileHandle');
             $Request-&gt;FileUpload('upload_file', 'BrowserFile');
             $Request-&gt;FileUpload('upload_file', 'Mime-Header');
             $Request-&gt;FileUpload('upload_file', 'TempFile');

             * note that TempFile must be use with the UploadTempFile
               configuration setting.

           The  above represents the old slow collection interface, but like all collections in Apache::ASP, you
           can reference the internal hash representation more easily.

             my $fileup = $Request-&gt;{FileUpload}{upload_file};
             $fileup-&gt;{ContentType};
             $fileup-&gt;{BrowserFile};
             $fileup-&gt;{FileHandle};
             $fileup-&gt;{Mime-Header};
             $fileup-&gt;{TempFile};

       $Request-&gt;Form($name)
           Returns the value of the input of name $name used in a form  with  POST  method.   If  $name  is  not
           specified,  returns  a  ref  to  a hash of all the form data.  One can use this hash to create a nice
           alias to the form data like:

            # in global.asa
            use vars qw( $Form );
            sub Script_OnStart {
              $Form = $Request-&gt;Form;
            }
            # then in ASP scripts
            &lt;%= $Form-&gt;{var} %&gt;

           File upload data will be loaded into $Request-&gt;Form('file_field'), where the value is the actual file
           name of the file uploaded, and the contents of the file can be found by reading from the file name as
           a file handle as in:

            while(read($Request-&gt;Form('file_field_name'), $data, 1024)) {};

           For more information, please see the CGI / File Upload section, as file uploads are  implemented  via
           the CGI.pm module.  An example can be found in the installation samples ./site/eg/file_upload.asp

       $Request-&gt;Params($name)
           API  extension.  If RequestParams CONFIG is set, the $Request-&gt;Params object is created with combined
           contents of $Request-&gt;QueryString and $Request-&gt;Form.  This is for developer convenience  similar  to
           CGI.pm's <b>param()</b> method.  Just like for $Response-&gt;Form, one could create a nice alias like:

            # in global.asa
            use vars qw( $Params );
            sub Script_OnStart {
              $Params = $Request-&gt;Params;
            }

       $Request-&gt;QueryString($name)
           Returns the value of the input of name $name used in a form with GET method, or passed by appending a
           query  string  to  the  end  of a url as in <a href="http://localhost/">http://localhost/</a>?data=value.  If $name is not specified,
           returns a ref to a hash of all the query string data.

       $Request-&gt;ServerVariables($name)
           Returns the value of the server variable / environment variable with name $name.   If  $name  is  not
           specified,  returns  a  ref  to a hash of all the server / environment variables data.  The following
           would be a common use of this method:

            $env = $Request-&gt;ServerVariables();
            # %{$env} here would be equivalent to the cgi %ENV in perl.

   <b>$Application</b> <b>Object</b>
       Like the $Session object, you may use the $Application object to store data across the entire life of the
       application.  Every page in the ASP application always has access to this object.  So if  you  wanted  to
       keep track of how many visitors there where to the application during its lifetime, you might have a line
       like this:

        $Application-&gt;{num_users}++

       The Lock and Unlock methods are used to prevent simultaneous access to the $Application object.

       $Application-&gt;<b>Lock()</b>
           Locks  the  Application  object  for  the life of the script, or until <b>UnLock()</b> unlocks it, whichever
           comes first.  When $Application is locked, this guarantees that data being read  and  written  to  it
           will not suddenly change on you between the reads and the writes.

           This  and  the $Session object both lock automatically upon every read and every write to ensure data
           integrity.  This lock is useful for concurrent access control purposes.

           Be careful to not be too liberal with this, as you can quickly create  application  bottlenecks  with
           its improper use.

       $Application-&gt;<b>UnLock()</b>
           Unlocks the $Application object.  If already unlocked, does nothing.

       $Application-&gt;GetSession($sess_id)
           This  NON-PORTABLE  API  extension  returns  a  user $Session given a session id.  This allows one to
           easily write a session manager if session ids are stored in $Application during Session_OnStart, with
           full access to these sessions for administrative purposes.

           Be careful not to expose full session ids over the net,  as  they  could  be  used  by  a  hacker  to
           impersonate  another  user.   So  when creating a session manager, for example, you could create some
           other id to reference the SessionID internally, which would allow you to control the sessions.   This
           kind of application would best be served under a secure web server.

           The ./site/eg/global_asa_demo.asp script makes use of this routine to display all the data in current
           user sessions.

       $Application-&gt;<b>SessionCount()</b>
           This  NON-PORTABLE  method  returns  the current number of active sessions in the application, and is
           enabled by the SessionCount configuration setting.  This method is not implemented  as  part  of  the
           original  ASP  object  model,  but  is  implemented  here  because it is useful.  In particular, when
           accessing databases with license requirements, one can monitor usage  effectively  through  accessing
           this value.

   <b>$Server</b> <b>Object</b>
       The  server object is that object that handles everything the other objects do not.  The best part of the
       server object for Win32 users is the CreateObject method which allows developers to create  instances  of
       ActiveX components, like the ADO component.

       $Server-&gt;{ScriptTimeout} = $seconds
           Not  implemented.  May  never  be.   Please  see the Apache Timeout configuration option, normally in
           httpd.conf.

       $Server-&gt;Config($setting)
           API extension.  Allows a developer to read the CONFIG settings, like Global, GlobalPackage, StateDir,
           etc.  Currently implemented as a wrapper around

             Apache-&gt;dir_config($setting)

           May also be invoked as $Server-&gt;<b>Config()</b>, which  will  return  a  hash  ref  of  all  the  PerlSetVar
           settings.

       $Server-&gt;CreateObject($program_id)
           Allows  use  of  ActiveX  objects on Win32.  This routine returns a reference to an Win32::OLE object
           upon success, and nothing upon failure.  It is through this mechanism that a  developer  can  utilize
           ADO.  The equivalent syntax in VBScript is

            Set object = Server.CreateObject(program_id)

           For further information, try 'perldoc Win32::OLE' from your favorite command line.

       $Server-&gt;Execute($file, @args)
           New method from ASP 3.0, this does the same thing as

             $Response-&gt;Include($file, @args)

           and internally is just a wrapper for such.  Seems like we had this important functionality before the
           IIS/ASP camp!

       $Server-&gt;<b>File()</b>
           Returns  the  absolute file path to current executing script.  Same as Apache-&gt;request-&gt;filename when
           running under mod_perl.

           ASP API extension.

       $Server-&gt;<b>GetLastError()</b>
           Not implemented, will likely not ever be because this is dependent on how IIS handles errors  and  is
           not relevant in Apache.

       $Server-&gt;HTMLEncode( $string || \$string )
           Returns an HTML escapes version of $string. &amp;, ", &gt;, &lt;, are each escapes with their HTML equivalents.
           Strings  encoded  in  this  nature  should  be raw text displayed to an end user, as HTML tags become
           escaped with this method.

           As of version 2.23, $Server-&gt;<b>HTMLEncode()</b> may take  a  string  reference  for  an  optimization  when
           encoding a large buffer as an API extension.  Here is how one might use one over the other:

             my $buffer = '&amp;' x 100000;
             $buffer = $Server-&gt;HTMLEncode($buffer);
             print $buffer;
               - or -
             my $buffer = '&amp;' x 100000;
             $Server-&gt;HTMLEncode(\$buffer);
             print $buffer;

           Using  the  reference  passing  method in benchmarks on 100K of data was 5% more efficient, but maybe
           useful for some.  It saves on copying the 100K buffer twice.

       $Server-&gt;MapInclude($include)
           API extension.  Given the include $include, as an absolute or  relative  file  name  to  the  current
           executing  script, this method returns the file path that the include would be found from the include
           search path.  The include search path is  the  current  script  directory,  Global,  and  IncludesDir
           directories.

           If  the  include is not found in the includes search path, then undef, or bool false, is returned. So
           one may do something like this:

             if($Server-&gt;MapInclude('include.inc')) {
               $Response-&gt;Include('include.inc');
             }

           This code demonstrates how one might only try to execute an include if it  exists,  which  is  useful
           since a script will error if it tries to execute an include that does not exist.

       $Server-&gt;MapPath($url);
           Given  the  url  $url, absolute, or relative to the current executing script, this method returns the
           equivalent filename that the server would translate the request to, regardless or whether the request
           would be valid.

           Only a $url that is relative to the host is valid.  Urls like "."  and  "/"  are  fine  arguments  to
           MapPath, but <a href="http://localhost">http://localhost</a> would not be.

           To see this method call in action, check out the sample ./site/eg/server.htm script.

       $Server-&gt;Mail(\%mail, %smtp_args);
           With  the Net::SMTP and Net::Config modules installed, which are part of the perl libnet package, you
           may use this API extension to send email.  The \%mail hash reference  that  you  pass  in  must  have
           values for at least the To, From, and Subject headers, and the Body of the mail message.

           The return value of this routine is 1 for success, 0 for failure.  If the MailHost SMTP server is not
           available, this will have a return value of 0.

           You could send an email like so:

            $Server-&gt;Mail({
                           To =&gt; '<a href="mailto:somebody@yourdomain.com.foobar">somebody@yourdomain.com.foobar</a>',
                           From =&gt; '<a href="mailto:youremail@yourdomain.com.foobar">youremail@yourdomain.com.foobar</a>',
                           Subject =&gt; 'Subject of Email',
                           Body =&gt;
                            'Body of message. '.
                            'You might have a lot to say here!',
                           Organization =&gt; 'Your Organization',
                           CC =&gt; '<a href="mailto:youremailcc@yourdomain.com.foobar">youremailcc@yourdomain.com.foobar</a>',
                           BCC =&gt; '<a href="mailto:youremailbcc@yourdomain.com.foobar">youremailbcc@yourdomain.com.foobar</a>',
                           Debug =&gt; 0 || 1,
                          });

           Any  extra fields specified for the email will be interpreted as headers for the email, so to send an
           HTML email, you could set 'Content-Type' =&gt; 'text/html' in the above example.

           If you have MailFrom configured, this will be the default for the From header  in  your  email.   For
           more configuration options like the MailHost setting, check out the CONFIG section.

           The return value of this method call will be boolean for success of the mail being sent.

           If you would like to specially configure the Net::SMTP object used internally, you may set %smtp_args
           and  they  will  be  passed on when that object is initialized.  "perldoc Net::SMTP" for more into on
           this topic.

           If you would like to include the output of an ASP page as the body of the mail message, you might  do
           something like:

             my $mail_body = $Response-&gt;TrapInclude('mail_body.inc');
             $Server-&gt;Mail({ %mail, Body =&gt; $$mail_body });

       $Server-&gt;RegisterCleanup($sub)
            non-portable extension

           Sets a subroutine reference to be executed after the script ends, whether normally or abnormally, the
           latter  occurring possibly by the user hitting the STOP button, or the web server being killed.  This
           subroutine must be a code reference created like:

            $Server-&gt;RegisterCleanup(sub { $main::Session-&gt;{served}++; });
              or
            sub served { $main::Session-&gt;{served}++; }
            $Server-&gt;RegisterCleanup(\&amp;served);

           The reference to the subroutine passed in will be executed.  Though the subroutine will  be  executed
           in  anonymous  context, instead of the script, all objects will still be defined in main::*, that you
           would reference normally in your script.  Output written to $main::Response will have  no  affect  at
           this stage, as the request to the www client has already completed.

           Check out the ./site/eg/register_cleanup.asp script for an example of this routine in action.

       $Server-&gt;Transfer($file, @args)
           New  method  from  ASP  3.0.   Transfers  control to another script.  The Response buffer will not be
           cleared automatically, so if you want this to serve as a faster $Response-&gt;<b>Redirect()</b>, you will  need
           to call $Response-&gt;<b>Clear()</b> before calling this method.

           This  new  script  will  take  over  current execution and the current script will not continue to be
           executed afterwards.  It differs from <b>Execute()</b> because the original script will not pick up where it
           left off.

           As of Apache::ASP 2.31,  this  method  now  accepts  optional  arguments  like  $Response-&gt;Include  &amp;
           $Server-&gt;Execute.  $Server-&gt;Transfer is now just a wrapper for:

             $Response-&gt;Include($file, @args);
             $Response-&gt;End;

       $Server-&gt;URLEncode($string)
           Returns  the URL-escaped version of the string $string. +'s are substituted in for spaces and special
           characters are escaped to the ascii equivalents.  Strings encoded in this manner are safe to  put  in
           urls... they are especially useful for encoding data used in a query string as in:

            $data = $Server-&gt;URLEncode("test data");
            $url = "<a href="http://localhost">http://localhost</a>?data=$data";

            $url evaluates to <a href="http://localhost">http://localhost</a>?data=test+data, and is a
            valid URL for use in anchor &lt;a&gt; tags and redirects, etc.

       $Server-&gt;URL($url, \%params)
           Will return a URL with %params serialized into a query string like:

             $url = $Server-&gt;URL('test.asp', { test =&gt; value });

           which would give you a URL of test.asp?test=value

           Used  in  conjunction with the SessionQuery* settings, the returned URL will also have the session id
           inserted into the query string, making this a critical part of that method of implementing cookieless
           sessions.  For more information on that topic please read on the setting in the CONFIG  section,  and
           the SESSIONS section too.

       $Server-&gt;XSLT(\$xsl_data, \$xml_data)
            * NON-PORTABLE API EXTENSION *

           This  method  takes  string  references  for XSL and XML data and returns the XSLT output as a string
           reference like:

             my $xslt_data_ref = $Server-&gt;XSLT(\$xsl_data, \$xml_data)
             print $$xslt_data_ref;

           The XSLT parser defaults to XML::XSLT, and is configured with the XSLTParser setting, which can  also
           use XML::Sablotron ( support added in 2.11 ), and XML::LibXSLT ( support added in 2.29 ).  Please see
           the  CONFIG section for more information on the XSLT* settings that drive this API.  The XSLT setting
           itself uses this API internally to do its rendering.

           This API was created to allow developers easy XSLT component rendering without having to  render  the
           entire  ASP  scripts  via  XSLT.   This  will  make  an easy plugin architecture for those looking to
           integrate XML into their existing ASP application frameworks.

           At some point, the API will likely take files as arguments, but not as of the 2.11 release.

</pre><h4><b>SSI</b></h4><pre>
       SSI is great!  One of the main features of server side includes is to include other files in  the  script
       being  requested.   In  Apache::ASP,  this  is implemented in a couple ways, the most crucial of which is
       implemented in the file include.  Formatted as

        &lt;!--#include file=filename.inc--&gt;

       ,the .inc being merely a convention, text from the included file  will  be  inserted  directly  into  the
       script  being  executed  and  the  script will be compiled as a whole.  Whenever the script or any of its
       includes change, the script will be recompiled.

       Includes go a great length to promote good decomposition and code sharing in ASP scripts,  but  they  are
       still  fairly  static.   As  of  version .09, includes may have dynamic runtime execution, as subroutines
       compiled into the global.asa namespace.  The first way to invoke includes dynamically is

        &lt;!--#include file=filename.inc args=@args--&gt;

       If @args is specified, Apache::ASP knows to execute  the  include  at  runtime  instead  of  inlining  it
       directly  into  the  compiled  code  of the script.  It does this by compiling the script at runtime as a
       subroutine, and caching it for future invocations.  Then the compiled  subroutine  is  executed  and  has
       @args passed into its as arguments.

       This  is still might be too static for some, as @args is still hardcoded into the ASP script, so finally,
       one may execute an include at runtime by utilizing this API extension

          $Response-&gt;Include("filename.inc", @args);

       which is a direct translation of the dynamic include above.

       Although inline includes should be a little faster, runtime dynamic includes  represent  great  potential
       savings  in  httpd  memory,  as  includes are shared between scripts keeping the size of each script to a
       minimum.  This can often be significant saving if much of the formatting occurs in an included header  of
       a www page.

       By  default, all includes will be inlined unless called with an args parameter.  However, if you want all
       your includes to be compiled as subs and dynamically executed at runtime, turn the DynamicIncludes config
       option on as documented above.

   <b>Apache::SSI</b> <b>for</b> <b>mod_perl</b> <b>1.3.x</b> <b>only</b>
       One of the things missing above is the

        &lt;!--#include virtual=filename.cgi--&gt;

       tag.  This and many other SSI code extensions are  available  by  filtering  Apache::ASP  output  through
       Apache::SSI  via  the  Apache::Filter and the Filter config options, available in mod_perl 1.3.x / Apache
       1.3.x.  Unfortunately this functionality is not available with mod_perl 2 / Apache 2.

       For more information on how to wire Apache::ASP and Apache::SSI together, please see  the  Filter  config
       option  documented  above.   Also  please  see Apache::SSI for further information on the capabilities it
       offers.

   <b>SSI</b> <b>with</b> <b>mod_filter</b> <b>in</b> <b>Apache</b> <b>2</b>
       Apache 2 offers chained filters.  It may be possible to  chain  filters  to  Apache::ASP  output  through
       mod_filter for SSI processing:

         <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.1/mod/mod_filter.html">http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.1/mod/mod_filter.html</a>

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Use with Apache.  Copy the ./site/eg directory from the ASP installation to your Apache document tree and
       try  it out!  You have to put "AllowOverride All" in your &lt;Directory&gt; config section to let the .htaccess
       file in the ./site/eg installation directory do its work.

       IMPORTANT (FAQ): Make sure that the web server has write access to that directory.  Usually a

        chmod -R 0777 eg

       will do the trick :)

</pre><h4><b>SESSIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Cookies are used by default for user $Session support ( see OBJECTS ).  In order to track a web user  and
       associate  server  side  data with that client, the web server sets, and the web client returns a 32 byte
       session id identifier cookie.  This implementation is very secure  and   may  be  used  in  secure  HTTPS
       transactions,  and  made  stronger  with SecureSession, HTTPOnlySession and ParanoidSession settings (see
       CONFIG ).

       However good cookies are for this kind of persistent state management between HTTP  requests,  they  have
       long been under fire for security risks associated with JavaScript security exploits and privacy abuse by
       large data tracking companies.

       Because  of  these reasons, web users will sometimes turn off their cookies, rendering normal ASP session
       implementations powerless, resulting in a new $Session generated every request.  This is not good for ASP
       style sessions.

   <b>Cookieless</b> <b>Sessions</b>
        *** See WARNING Below ***

       So we now have more ways to track sessions with the SessionQuery*  CONFIG  settings,  that  allow  a  web
       developer  to  embed  the  session  id  in  URL  query  strings  when  use  of  cookies  is  denied.  The
       implementations work such that if a user has cookies turned on, then cookies will be used, but for  those
       users with cookies turned off, the session ids will be parsed into document URLs.

       The  first  and  easiest  method  that  a web developer may use to implement cookieless sessions are with
       SessionQueryParse* directives which enable Apache::ASP to the parse the session id into document URLs  on
       the  fly.   Because  this is resource inefficient, there is also the SessionQuery* directives that may be
       used with the $Server-&gt;URL($url,\%params) method to generate custom URLs with the session id in its query
       string.

       To see an example of these cookieless sessions in action, check out the ./site/eg/session_query_parse.asp
       example.

        *** WARNING ***

       If you do use these methods, then be VERY CAREFUL of linking offsite from a page that was accessed with a
       session id in a query string.  This is because this session id will show up in the HTTP_REFERER  logs  of
       the  linked to site, and a malicious hacker could use this information to compromise the security of your
       site's $Sessions, even if these are run under a secure web server.

       In order to shake a session id off an HTTP_REFERER for a link taking a user offsite, you must point  that
       link to a redirect page that will redirect a user, like so:

        &lt;%
           # "cross site scripting bug" prevention
           my $sanitized_url =
               $Server-&gt;HTMLEncode($Response-&gt;QueryString('OffSiteUrl'));
        %&gt;
        &lt;html&gt;
        &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;meta http-equiv=refresh content='0;URL=&lt;%=$sanitized_url%&gt;'&gt;
        &lt;/head&gt;
        &lt;body&gt;
               Redirecting you offsite to
               &lt;a href=&lt;%=$sanitized_url%&gt; &gt;here&lt;/a&gt;...
        &lt;/body&gt;
        &lt;/html&gt;

       Because  the web browser visits a real page before being redirected with the &lt;meta&gt; tag, the HTTP_REFERER
       will be set to this page.  Just be sure to not link to this page with a session id in its query string.

       Unfortunately a simple $Response-&gt;<b>Redirect()</b> will not work here, because the web browser  will  keep  the
       HTTP_REFERER of the original web page if only a normal redirect is used.

</pre><h4><b>XML/XSLT</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Custom</b> <b>Tags</b> <b>with</b> <b>XMLSubsMatch</b>
       Before  XML, there was the need to make HTML markup smarter.  Apache::ASP gives you the ability to have a
       perl subroutine handle the execution of any predefined tag, taking the  tag  descriptors,  and  the  text
       contained  between,  as  arguments of the subroutine.  This custom tag technology can be used to extend a
       web developer's abilities to add dynamic pieces without having to visibly use &lt;% %&gt; style code entries.

       So, lets say that you have a table that you want to insert for an employee  with  contact  info  and  the
       like, you could set up a tag like:

        &lt;my:new-employee name="Jane" last="Doe" phone="555-2222"&gt;
          Jane Doe has been here since 1998.
        &lt;/my:new-employee&gt;

       To  render  it  with  a  custom  tag,  you  would  tell  the  Apache::ASP parser to render the tag with a
       subroutine:

         PerlSetVar XMLSubsMatch my:new-employee

       Any colons, ':', in the XML custom tag will turn into '::', a perl package separator, so the  my:employee
       tag  would  translate  to the my::employee subroutine, or the employee subroutine in the my package.  Any
       dash "-" will also be translated to an underscore "_", as  dash  is  not  valid  in  the  names  of  perl
       subroutines.

       Then you would create the my::employee subroutine in the my perl package or wherever like so:

         package my;
         sub new_employee {
           my($attributes, $body) = @_;
           $main::Response-&gt;Include('new_employee.inc', $attributes, $body);
         }
         1;

         &lt;!-- # new_employee.inc file somewhere else, maybe in Global directory --&gt;
         &lt;% my($attributes, $body) = @_; %&gt;
         &lt;table&gt;
         &lt;% for('name', 'last', 'phone') { %&gt;
           &lt;tr&gt;
             &lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;%=ucfirst $_ %&gt;&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;/td&gt;
             &lt;td&gt;&lt;%= $attributes-&gt;{$_} %&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
           &lt;/tr&gt;
         &lt;% } %&gt;
         &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=2&gt;&lt;%= $body %&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
         &lt;/table&gt;
         &lt;!-- # end new_employee.inc file --&gt;

       The   $main::Response-&gt;<b>Include()</b>   would   then  delegate  the  rendering  of  the  new-employee  to  the
       new_employee.inc ASP script include.

       Though XML purists would not like this custom tag technology to be related to XML, the reality is that  a
       careful  site  engineer  could  render  full XML documents with this technology, applying all the correct
       styles that one might otherwise do with XSLT.

       Custom tags defined in this way can be used as XML tags are defined with both a body and without as it

         &lt;my:new-employee&gt;...&lt;/my:new-employee&gt;

       and just

         &lt;my:new-employee /&gt;

       These tags are very powerful in that they can also enclose normal ASP logic, like:

         &lt;my:new-employee&gt;
           &lt;!-- normal ASP logic --&gt;
           &lt;% my $birthday = &amp;HTTP::Date::time2str(time - 25 * 86400 * 365); %&gt;

           &lt;!-- ASP inserts --&gt;
           This employee has been online for &lt;%= int(rand()*600)+1 %&gt;
           seconds, and was born near &lt;%= $birthday %&gt;.
         &lt;/my:new-employee&gt;

       For an example of this custom XML tagging in action, please check out the ./site/eg/xml_subs.asp script.

   <b>XSLT</b> <b>Tranformations</b>
       XML is good stuff, but what can you use it for? The principle is that by having data and style  separated
       in  XML and XSL files, you can reformat your data more easily in the future, and you can render your data
       in multiple formats, just as easily as for your web site, so you might render your site to a  PDA,  or  a
       cell  phone just as easily as to a browser, and all you have to do is set up the right XSL stylesheets to
       do the transformation (XSLT).

       With native XML/XSLT support, Apache::ASP scripts may be the  source  of  XML  data  that  the  XSL  file
       transforms,  and  the  XSL  file  itself  will  be  first  executed  as  an  ASP  script  also.  The XSLT
       transformation is handled by XML::XSLT or XML::Sablotron and you can see an example of it  in  action  at
       the ./site/eg/xslt.xml XML script.

       To specify a XSL stylesheet, use the setting:

         PerlSetVar XSLT template.xsl

       where template.xsl could be any file.  By default this will XSLT transform all ASP scripts so configured,
       but you can separate xml scripts from the rest with the setting:

         PerlSetVar XSLTMatch xml$

       where all files with the ending xml would undergo a XSLT transformation.

       Note  that  XSLT  depends  on  the  installation  of  XML::XSLT,  which  in turn depends on XML::DOM, and
       XML::Parser.  As of version 2.11, XML::Sablotron may also be used by setting:

         PerlSetVar XSLTParser XML::Sablotron

       and XML::LibXSLT may be used, as of 2.29, by setting

         PerlSetVar XSLTParser XML::LibXSLT

       If you would like to install XML::Sablotron or XML::LibXSLT, you will first have to install the libraries
       that these perl modules use, which you can get at:

         libxslt - The XSLT C Library for Gnome
         <a href="http://xmlsoft.org/XSLT/">http://xmlsoft.org/XSLT/</a>

         Sablotron - Ginger Alliance
         <a href="http://www.gingerall.com">http://www.gingerall.com</a>

       For more on XML::XSLT, the default XSLT engine that Apache::ASP will use, please see:

         XML::XSLT
         <a href="http://xmlxslt.sourceforge.net/">http://xmlxslt.sourceforge.net/</a>

       XML:XSLT was the first supported XSLT engine as has the benefit of being written in  pure  perl  so  that
       though while it is slower than the other solutions, it is easier to port.

       If you would like to cache XSLT transformations, which is highly recommended, just set:

         PerlSetVar XSLTCache 1

       Please see the Cache settings in the CONFIG section for more about how to configure the XSLTCache.

</pre><h4><b>CGI</b></h4><pre>
       CGI  has  been  the  standard  way  of deploying web applications long before ASP came along.  In the CGI
       gateway world, CGI.pm has been a widely used module in building  CGI  applications,  and  Apache::ASP  is
       compatible with scripts written with CGI.pm.  Also, as of version 2.19, Apache::ASP can run in standalone
       CGI  mode  for the Apache web server without mod_perl being available.  See "Standalone CGI Mode" section
       below.

       Following are some special notes with respect to compatibility with CGI and CGI.pm.  Use of CGI.pm in any
       of these ways was made possible through a great amount of work, and is not guaranteed to be portable with
       other perl ASP implementations, as other ASP implementations will likely be more limited.

       Standalone CGI Mode, without mod_perl
           As of version 2.19, Apache::ASP scripts may be run as standalone CGI scripts without  mod_perl  being
           loaded  into  Apache.   Work  to  date has only been done with mod_cgi scripts under Apache on a Unix
           platform, and it is unlikely to work under other web  servers  or  Win32  operating  systems  without
           further development.

           To  run  the  ./site/eg  scripts  as  CGI  scripts,  you  copy  the ./site directory to some location
           accessible by your web server, in this example  its  /usr/local/apache/htdocs/aspcgi,  then  in  your
           httpd.conf activate Apache::ASP cgi scripts like so:

            Alias /aspcgi/ /usr/local/apache/htdocs/aspcgi/
            &lt;Directory /usr/local/apache/htdocs/aspcgi/eg/ &gt;
              AddType application/x-httpd-cgi .htm
              AddType application/x-httpd-cgi .html
              AddType application/x-httpd-cgi .asp
              AddType application/x-httpd-cgi .xml
              AddType application/x-httpd-cgi .ssi
              AllowOverride None
              Options +ExecCGI +Indexes
            &lt;/Directory&gt;

           Then  install the asp-perl script from the distribution into <a href="file:/usr/bin">/usr/bin</a>, or some other directory.  This
           is so the CGI execution line at the top of those scripts will invoke the asp-perl wrapper like so:

            #!<a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?perl">/usr/bin/perl</a> /usr/bin/asp-perl

           The asp-perl script is a cgi wrapper that sets up the Apache::ASP environment in lieu of  the  normal
           mod_perl handler request.  Because there is no Apache-&gt;<b>dir_config()</b> data available under mod_cgi, the
           asp-perl  script  will load a asp.conf file that may define a hash %Config of data for populating the
           <b>dir_config()</b> data.  An example of a complex asp.conf file is at ./site/eg/asp.conf

           So, a trivial asp.conf file might look like:

            # asp.conf
            %Config = (
              'Global' =&gt; '.',
              'StateDir' =&gt; '/tmp/aspstate',
              'NoState' =&gt; 0,
              'Debug' =&gt; 3,
            );

           The default for NoState is 1 in CGI mode, so one must set NoState to 0 for objects  like  $Session  &amp;
           $Application to be defined.

       CGI.pm
           CGI.pm  is  a  very  useful  module  that  aids developers in the building of these applications, and
           Apache::ASP has been made to be compatible with function calls in CGI.pm.  Please see cgi.htm in  the
           ./site/eg directory for a sample ASP script written almost entirely in CGI.

           As  of  version  0.09,  use  of  CGI.pm  for  both  input  and  output is seamless when working under
           Apache::ASP.  Thus if you would like to port existing cgi scripts over to Apache::ASP, all  you  need
           to  do is wrap &lt;% %&gt; around the script to get going.  This functionality has been implemented so that
           developers may have the best of both worlds when building their web applications.

           For more information about CGI.pm, please see the web site

             <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/CGI/">http://search.cpan.org/dist/CGI/</a>

       Query Object Initialization
           You may create a CGI.pm $query object like so:

                   use CGI;
                   my $query = new CGI;

           As of Apache::ASP version 0.09, form input may be read in by  CGI.pm  upon  initialization.   Before,
           Apache::ASP  would  consume  the form input when reading into $Request-&gt;<b>Form()</b>, but now form input is
           cached, and may be used by CGI.pm input routines.

       CGI headers
           Not only can you use the CGI.pm $query-&gt;<b>header()</b> method to put out headers, but with  the  CgiHeaders
           config  option set to true, you can also print "Header: value\n", and add similar lines to the top of
           your script, like:

            Some-Header: Value
            Some-Other: OtherValue

            &lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt; Script body starts here.

           Once there are no longer any cgi style headers, or the there is a newline, the  body  of  the  script
           begins. So if you just had an asp script like:

               print join(":", %{$Request-&gt;QueryString});

           You  would  likely  end  up  with  no  output, as that line is interpreted as a header because of the
           semicolon.  When doing basic debugging, as long as you start the page with &lt;html&gt; you will avoid this
           problem.

       <b>print()</b>ing CGI
           CGI is notorious for its <b>print()</b> statements, and the functions in CGI.pm usually  return  strings  to
           <b>print()</b>.   You  can  do this under Apache::ASP, since print just aliases to $Response-&gt;<b>Write()</b>.  Note
           that $| has no affect.

                   print $query-&gt;header();
                   print $query-&gt;start_form();

       File Upload
           CGI.pm is used for implementing reading the input from file upload.  You may create the  file  upload
           form  however  you  wish,  and  then  the  data  may  be  recovered  from  the  file  upload by using
           $Request-&gt;<b>Form()</b>.  Data from a file upload gets written to a file handle, that may in  turn  be  read
           from.  The original file name that was uploaded is the name of the file handle.

                   my $filehandle = $Request-&gt;Form('file_upload_field_name');
                   print $filehandle; # will get you the file name
                   my $data;
                   while(read($filehandle, $data, 1024)) {
                           # data from the uploaded file read into $data
                   };

           Please  see  the  docs  on  CGI.pm  (try  perldoc  CGI)  for  more  information  on  this  topic, and
           ./site/eg/file_upload.asp for an example of its use.  Also, for more  details  about  CGI.pm  itself,
           please see the web site:

               <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/CGI/">http://search.cpan.org/dist/CGI/</a>

           Occasionally,  a newer version of CGI.pm will be released which breaks file upload compatibility with
           Apache::ASP.  If you find this to occur, then you might consider downgrading to a version that works.
           For example, one can install a working CGI.pm v2.78 for a working version, and to get old versions of
           this module, one can go to BACKPAN at:

               <a href="http://backpan.cpan.org/modules/by-authors/id/L/LD/LDS/">http://backpan.cpan.org/modules/by-authors/id/L/LD/LDS/</a>

           There is also $Request-&gt;<b>FileUpload()</b> API extension that you can use to get more  data  about  a  file
           upload, so that the following properties are available for querying:

             my $file_upload = $Request-&gt;{FileUpload}{upload_field};
             $file_upload-&gt;{BrowserFile}
             $file_upload-&gt;{FileHandle}
             $file_upload-&gt;{ContentType}

             # only if FileUploadTemp is set
             $file_upload-&gt;{TempFile}

             # whatever mime headers are sent with the file upload
             # just "keys %$file_upload" to find out
             $file_upload-&gt;{?Mime-Header?}

           Please see the $Request section in OBJECTS for more information.

</pre><h4><b>PERLSCRIPT</b></h4><pre>
       Much  work  has  been  done to bring compatibility with ASP applications written in PerlScript under IIS.
       Most of that work revolved around bringing a Win32::OLE Collection interface to many of  the  objects  in
       Apache::ASP, which are natively written as perl hashes.

       New  as  of  version  2.05  is new functionality enabled with the CollectionItem setting, to giver better
       support to more recent PerlScript syntax.  This seems helpful when porting from  an  IIS/PerlScript  code
       base.  Please see the CONFIG section for more info.

       The following objects in Apache::ASP respond as Collections:

               $Application
               $Session
               $Request-&gt;FileUpload *
               $Request-&gt;FileUpload('upload_file') *
               $Request-&gt;Form
               $Request-&gt;QueryString
               $Request-&gt;Cookies
               $Response-&gt;Cookies
               $Response-&gt;Cookies('some_cookie')

         * FileUpload API Extensions

       And as such may be used with the following syntax, as compared with the Apache::ASP native calls.  Please
       note the native Apache::ASP interface is compatible with the deprecated PerlScript interface.

        C = PerlScript Compatibility   N = Native Apache::ASP

        ## Collection-&gt;Contents($name)
        [C] $Application-&gt;Contents('XYZ')
        [N] $Application-&gt;{XYZ}

        ## Collection-&gt;SetProperty($property, $name, $value)
        [C] $Application-&gt;Contents-&gt;SetProperty('Item', 'XYZ', "Fred");
        [N] $Application-&gt;{XYZ} = "Fred"

        ## Collection-&gt;GetProperty($property, $name)
        [C] $Application-&gt;Contents-&gt;GetProperty('Item', 'XYZ')
        [N] $Application-&gt;{XYZ}

        ## Collection-&gt;Item($name)
        [C] print $Request-&gt;QueryString-&gt;Item('message'), "&lt;br&gt;\n\n";
        [N] print $Request-&gt;{QueryString}{'message'}, "&lt;br&gt;\n\n";

        ## Working with Cookies
        [C] $Response-&gt;SetProperty('Cookies', 'Testing', 'Extra');
        [C] $Response-&gt;SetProperty('Cookies', 'Testing', {'Path' =&gt; '/'});
        [C] print $Request-&gt;Cookies(Testing) . "&lt;br&gt;\n";
        [N] $Response-&gt;{Cookies}{Testing} = {Value =&gt; Extra, Path =&gt; '/'};
        [N] print $Request-&gt;{Cookies}{Testing} . "&lt;br&gt;\n";

       Several incompatibilities exist between PerlScript and Apache::ASP:

        &gt; Collection-&gt;{Count} property has not been implemented.
        &gt; VBScript dates may not be used for Expires property of cookies.
        &gt; Win32::OLE::in may not be used.  Use keys() to iterate over.
        &gt; The -&gt;{Item} property does not work, use the -&gt;Item() method.

</pre><h4><b>STYLE</b> <b>GUIDE</b></h4><pre>
       Here  are  some  general  style  guidelines.   Treat  these  as  tips  for  best practices on Apache::ASP
       development if you will.

   <b>UseStrict</b>
       One of perl's blessings is also its bane, variables do not need  to  be  declared,  and  are  by  default
       globally  scoped.  The problem with this in mod_perl is that global variables persist from one request to
       another even if a different web browser is viewing a page.

       To avoid this problem, perl programmers have often been advised to add to the top of their perl scripts:

         use strict;

       In Apache::ASP, you can do this better by setting:

         PerlSetVar UseStrict 1

       which will cover both script &amp; global.asa compilation and will catch "use strict" errors correctly.   For
       perl modules, please continue to add "use strict" to the top of them.

       Because  its  so  essential  in  catching  hard to find errors, this configuration will likely become the
       default in some future release.  For now, keep setting it.

   <b>Do</b> <b>not</b> <b>define</b> <b>subroutines</b> <b>in</b> <b>scripts.</b>
       DO NOT add subroutine declarations in scripts.  Apache::ASP is optimized by compiling  a  script  into  a
       subroutine for faster future invocation.  Adding a subroutine definition to a script then looks like this
       to the compiler:

         sub page_script_sub {
           ...
           ... some HTML ...
           ...
           sub your_sub {
             ...
           }
           ...
         }

       The  biggest  problem  with  subroutines  defined in subroutines is the side effect of creating closures,
       which will not behave as usually desired in a mod_perl environment.  To understand more  about  closures,
       please read up on them &amp; "Nested Subroutines" at:

         <a href="http://perl.apache.org/docs/general/perl_reference/perl_reference.html">http://perl.apache.org/docs/general/perl_reference/perl_reference.html</a>

       Instead  of defining subroutines in scripts, you may add them to your sites global.asa, or you may create
       a perl package or module to share with your scripts.  For more on perl objects &amp; modules, please see:

         <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/perlobj.html">http://perldoc.perl.org/perlobj.html</a>

   <b>Use</b> <b>global.asa's</b> <b>Script_On*</b> <b>Events</b>
       Chances are that you will find yourself doing the same thing repeatedly in each of your web application's
       scripts.  You can use Script_OnStart and Script_OnEnd to automate these routine tasks.  These events  are
       called before and after each script request.

       For  example, let's say you have a header &amp; footer you would like to include in the output of every page,
       then you might:

        # global.asa
        sub Script_OnStart {
          $Response-&gt;Include('header.inc');
        }
        sub Script_OnEnd {
          $Response-&gt;Include('footer.inc');
        }

       Or let's say you want to initialize a global database connection for use in your scripts:

        # global.asa
        use Apache::DBI;   # automatic persistent database connections
        use DBI;

        use vars qw($dbh); # declare global $dbh

        sub Script_OnStart {
          # initialize $dbh
          $dbh = DBI-&gt;connect(...);

          # force you to explicitly commit when you want to save data
          $Server-&gt;RegisterCleanup(sub { $dbh-&gt;rollback; });
        }

        sub Script_OnEnd {
          # not really necessary when using persistent connections, but
          # will free this one object reference at least
          $dbh = undef;
        }

</pre><h4><b>FAQ</b></h4><pre>
       The following are some frequently asked questions about Apache::ASP.

   <b>Installation</b>
       Examples don't work, I see the ASP script in the browser?
           This is most likely that Apache is not configured to execute the Apache::ASP scripts properly.  Check
           the INSTALL QuickStart section for more info on how to quickly set up  Apache  to  execute  your  ASP
           scripts.

       Apache Expat vs. XML perl parsing causing segfaults, what do I do?
           Make   sure  to  compile  apache  with  expat  disabled.   The  ./make_httpd/build_httpds.sh  in  the
           distribution will do this for you, with the --disable-rule=EXPAT in particular:

            cd ../$APACHE
            echo "Building apache =============================="
            ./configure \
               --prefix=/usr/local/apache \
               --activate-module=src/modules/perl/libperl.a \
               --enable-module=ssl \
               --enable-module=proxy \
               --enable-module=so \
               --disable-rule=EXPAT

                              ^^^^^

           keywords: segmentation fault, segfault seg fault

       Why do variables retain their values between requests?
           Unless scoped by <b>my()</b> or <b>local()</b>, perl variables in mod_perl are treated as globals, and  values  set
           may persist from one request to another. This can be seen in as simple a script as this:

             &lt;HTML&gt;&lt;BODY&gt;
               $counter++;
               $Response-&gt;Write("&lt;BR&gt;Counter: $counter");
             &lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;

           The value for $counter++ will remain between requests.  Generally use of globals in this way is a BAD
           IDEA,  and you can spare yourself many headaches if do "use strict" perl programming which forces you
           to explicitly declare globals like:

             use vars qw($counter);

           You can make all your Apache::ASP scripts strict by default by setting:

             PerlSetVar UseStrict 1

       Apache errors on the PerlHandler or PerlModule directives ?
           You get an error message like this:

            Invalid command 'PerlModule', perhaps mis-spelled or defined by a
            module not included in the server configuration.

           You do not have mod_perl correctly installed for Apache.  The PerlHandler and  PerlModule  directives
           in  Apache  *.conf  files  are  extensions  enabled  by mod_perl and will not work if mod_perl is not
           correctly installed.

           Common user errors are not doing a 'make install' for mod_perl,  which  installs  the  perl  side  of
           mod_perl,  and not starting the right httpd after building it.  The latter often occurs when you have
           an old apache server without mod_perl, and you have built a new  one  without  copying  over  to  its
           proper location.

           To get mod_perl, go to <a href="http://perl.apache.org">http://perl.apache.org</a>

       Error: no request object (Apache=SCALAR(0x???????):)
           Your  Apache  +  mod_perl  build is not working properly, and is likely a RedHat Linux RPM DSO build.
           Make sure you statically build your Apache + mod_perl httpd, recompiled fresh from the sources.

       I am getting a tie or MLDBM / state error message, what do I do?
           Make sure the web server or you have write access to the eg directory, or to the directory  specified
           as  Global  in  the config you are using.  Default for Global is the directory the script is in (e.g.
           '.'), but should be set to some directory not under  the  www  server  document  root,  for  security
           reasons, on a production site.

           Usually a

            chmod -R -0777 eg

           will take care of the write access issue for initial testing purposes.

           Failing  write  access being the problem, try upgrading your version of Data::Dumper and MLDBM, which
           are the modules used to write the state files.

   <b>Sessions</b>
       How can I use $Session to store complex data structures.
           Very carefully.  Please read the $Session documentation in the OBJECTS section.  You can  store  very
           complex  objects in $Session, but you have to understand the limits, and the syntax that must be used
           to make this happen.

           In particular, stay away from statements that that have more than one level  of  indirection  on  the
           left side of an assignment like:

             BAD: $Session-&gt;{complex}{object} = $data;

       How can I keep search engine spiders from killing the session manager?
           If  you want to disallow session creation for certain non web browser user agents, like search engine
           spiders, you can use a mod_perl PerlInitHandler like this to set configuration variables at runtime:

            # put the following code into httpd.conf and stop/start apache server
            PerlInitHandler My::InitHandler

            &lt;Perl&gt;

             package My::InitHandler;
             use Apache;

             sub handler {
               my $r = shift; # get the Apache request object

               # if not a Mozilla User Agent, then disable sessions explicitly
               unless($r-&gt;headers_in('User-Agent') =~ /^Mozilla/) {
                  $r-&gt;dir_config('AllowSessionState', 'Off');
               }

               return 200; # return OK mod_perl status code
             }

             1;

            &lt;/Perl&gt;

           This will configure your environment before Apache::ASP executes and sees the configuration settings.
           You can use the mod_perl API in this way to configure Apache::ASP at runtime.

           Note that the Session Manager is very robust on its own, and denial of service attacks of  the  types
           that  spiders  and  other  web  bots  normally  execute  are not likely to affect the Session Manager
           significantly.

       How can I use $Session to store a $dbh database handle ?
           You cannot use $Session to store a $dbh handle.  This can be awkward for those coming from the IIS/NT
           world, where you could store just about anything in $Session, but this boils  down  to  a  difference
           between threads vs. processes.

           Database  handles  often have per process file handles open, which cannot be shared between requests,
           so though you have stored the $dbh data in $Session, all the other initializations are  not  relevant
           in another httpd process.

           All  is  not  lost! Apache::DBI can be used to cache database connections on a per process basis, and
           will work for most cases.

   <b>Development</b>
       VBScript or JScript supported?
           Only Perl scripting is supported with this module.

       How is database connectivity handled?
           Database connectivity is handled through perl's DBI &amp; DBD interfaces.  In the UNIX  world,  it  seems
           most  databases  have  cross  platform  support in perl.  You can find the book on DBI programming at
           <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/perldbi/">http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/perldbi/</a>

           DBD::ODBC is often your ticket  on  Win32.   On  UNIX,  commercial  vendors  like  OpenLink  Software
           (<a href="http://www.openlinksw.com/">http://www.openlinksw.com/</a>) provide the nuts and bolts for ODBC.

           Database connections can be cached per process with Apache::DBI.

       What is the best way to debug an ASP application ?
           There  are  lots  of  perl-ish  tricks  to make your life developing and debugging an ASP application
           easier.  For starters, you will find  some  helpful  hints  by  reading  the  $Response-&gt;<b>Debug()</b>  API
           extension, and the Debug configuration directive.

       How are file uploads handled?
           Please  see  the CGI section.  File uploads are implemented through CGI.pm which is loaded at runtime
           only for this purpose.  This is the only time that  CGI.pm  will  be  loaded  by  Apache::ASP,  which
           implements all other cgi-ish functionality natively.  The rationale for not implementing file uploads
           natively  is that the extra 100K in memory for CGI.pm shouldn't be a big deal if you are working with
           bulky file uploads.

       How do I access the ASP Objects in general?
           All the ASP objects can be referenced through the main package with the following notation:

            $main::Response-&gt;Write("html output");

           This  notation  can  be  used  from  anywhere   in   perl,   including   routines   registered   with
           $Server-&gt;<b>RegisterCleanup()</b>.

           You use the normal notation in your scripts, includes, and global.asa:

            $Response-&gt;Write("html output");

       Can I <b>print()</b> in ASP?
           Yes.   You can <b>print()</b> from anywhere in an ASP script as it aliases to the $Response-&gt;<b>Write()</b> method.
           Using <b>print()</b> is portable with PerlScript when using Win32::ASP in that environment.

       Do I have access to ActiveX objects?
           Only under Win32 will  developers  have  access  to  ActiveX  objects  through  the  perl  Win32::OLE
           interface.   This  will  remain true until there are free COM ports to the UNIX world.  At this time,
           there is no ActiveX for the UNIX world.

   <b>Support</b> <b>and</b> <b>Production</b>
       How do I get things I want done?!
           If you find a problem with the module, or would like a feature added, please mail support, as  listed
           in the SUPPORT section, and your needs will be promptly and seriously considered, then implemented.

       What is the state of Apache::ASP?  Can I publish a web site on it?
           Apache::ASP  has  been  production  ready since v.02.  Work being done on the module is on a per need
           basis, with the goal being to eventually have  the  ASP  API  completed,  with  full  portability  to
           ActiveState  PerlScript  and  MKS PScript.  If you can suggest any changes to facilitate these goals,
           your comments are welcome.

</pre><h4><b>TUNING</b></h4><pre>
       A little tuning can go a long way, and can make the difference between a web site that  gets  by,  and  a
       site  that  screams  with speed.  With Apache::ASP, you can easily take a poorly tuned site running at 10
       hits/second to 50+ hits/second just with the right configuration.

       Documented below are some simple things you can do to make the most of your site.

   <b>Online</b> <b>Resources</b>
       For more tips &amp; tricks on tuning Apache and mod_perl, please see the tuning documents at:

         Stas Bekman's mod_perl guide
         <a href="http://perl.apache.org/guide/">http://perl.apache.org/guide/</a>

       Written in late 1999 this article provides an early look at how to tune your Apache::ASP  web  site.   It
       has since been updated to remain current with Apache::ASP v2.29+

         Apache::ASP Site Tuning
         <a href="http://www.apache-asp.org/articles/perlmonth3_tune.html">http://www.apache-asp.org/articles/perlmonth3_tune.html</a>

   <b>Tuning</b> <b>&amp;</b> <b>Benchmarking</b>
       When  performance  tuning,  it is important to have a tool to measure the impact of your tuning change by
       change.  The program ab, or Apache Bench, provides this functionality well, and is freely included in the
       apache distribution.

       Because performance tuning can be a neverending affair, it is a good idea to establish a threshold  where
       performance is "good enough", that once reached, tuning stops.

   <b>$Application</b> <b>&amp;</b> <b>$Session</b> <b>State</b>
       Use NoState 1 setting if you don't need the $Application or $Session objects. State objects such as these
       tie to files on disk and will incur a performance penalty.

       If  you  need  the  state  objects  $Application  and $Session, and if running an OS that caches files in
       memory, set your "StateDir" directory to a cached file system.  On WinNT, all files may  be  cached,  and
       you  have  no  control  of  this.   On  Solaris,  <a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a> is a RAM disk and would be a good place to set the
       "StateDir" config setting to.  When cached file systems are used there is little performance penalty  for
       using state files.  Linux tends to do a good job caching its file systems, so pick a StateDir for ease of
       system administration.

       On  Win32  systems,  where  mod_perl requests are serialized, you can freely use SessionSerialize to make
       your $Session requests faster, and you can achieve similar performance benefits for $Application  if  you
       call $Application-&gt;<b>Lock()</b> in your global.asa's Script_OnStart.

   <b>Low</b> <b>MaxClients</b>
       Set your MaxClients low, such that if you have that many httpd servers running, which will happen on busy
       site,  your  system will not start swapping to disk because of excessive RAM usage.  Typical settings are
       less than 100 even with 1 gig RAM!  To handle more client connections, look into a dual server, mod_proxy
       front end.

   <b>High</b> <b>MaxRequestsPerChild</b>
       Set your max requests per child thread or process (in httpd.conf) high, so that ASP scripts have a better
       chance being cached, which happens after they are first compiled.  You will also avoid the  process  fork
       penalty  on  UNIX  systems.   Somewhere between 50 - 500 is probably pretty good.  You do not want to set
       this too high though or you will risk  having  your  web  processes  use  too  much  RAM.   One  may  use
       Apache::SizeLimit or Apache::GTopLimit to optimally tune MaxRequestsPerChild at runtime.

   <b>Precompile</b> <b>Modules</b>
       For  those  modules  that your Apache::ASP application uses, make sure that they are loaded in your sites
       startup.pl file, or loaded with PerlModule in your httpd.conf, so that your modules are compiled pre-fork
       in the parent httpd.

   <b>Precompile</b> <b>Scripts</b>
       Precompile your scripts by using the Apache::ASP-&gt;<b>Loader()</b> routine documented below.  This will at  least
       save the first user hitting a script from suffering compile time lag.  On UNIX, precompiling scripts upon
       server  startup allows this code to be shared with forked child www servers, so you reduce overall memory
       usage, and use less CPU compiling scripts for each separate www server process.  These savings  could  be
       significant.   On  a  PII300  Solaris  x86,  it  takes a couple seconds to compile 28 scripts upon server
       startup, with an average of 50K RAM per compiled script, and this savings is passed on to the  ALL  child
       httpd servers, so total savings would be 50Kx28x20(MaxClients)=28M!

       Apache::ASP-&gt;<b>Loader()</b>  can  be  called  to  precompile scripts and even entire ASP applications at server
       startup.  Note also that in modperl, you can precompile modules with  the  PerlModule  config  directive,
       which is highly recommended.

        Apache::ASP-&gt;Loader($path, $pattern, %config)

       This routine takes a file or directory as its first argument.  If a file, that file will be compiled.  If
       a  directory,  that directory will be recursed, and all files in it whose file name matches $pattern will
       be compiled.  $pattern defaults to .*, which says that all scripts in a directory  will  be  compiled  by
       default.

       The  %config  args,  are the config options that you may want set that affect compilation.  These options
       include: Debug, Global, GlobalPackage, DynamicIncludes, IncludesDir,  InodeNames,  PodComments,  StatINC,
       StatINCMatch,  UseStrict, XMLSubsPerlArgs, XMLSubsMatch, and XMLSubsStrict. If your scripts are later run
       with different config options, your scripts may have to be recompiled.

       Here is an example of use in a *.conf file:

        &lt;Perl&gt;
        Apache::ASP-&gt;Loader(
               '/usr/local/proj/site', "(asp|htm)\$",
               'Global' =&gt; '/proj/perllib',
               'Debug' =&gt; -3, # see system output when starting apache

               # OPTIONAL configs if you use them in your apache configuration
               # these settings affect how the scripts are compiled and loaded
               'GlobalPackage' =&gt; 'SomePackageName',
               'DynamicIncludes' =&gt; 1,
               'StatINC' =&gt; 1,
               'StatINCMatch' =&gt; 'My',
               'UseStrict' =&gt; 1,
               'XMLSubsMatch' =&gt; 'my:\w+',
               'XMLSubsStrict' =&gt; 0 || 1,
               );
        &lt;/Perl&gt;

       This config section tells the server to compile all scripts in c:/proj/site that end in asp or  htm,  and
       print  debugging  output  so you can see it work.  It also sets the Global directory to be /proj/perllib,
       which needs to be the same as your real  config  since  scripts  are  cached  uniquely  by  their  Global
       directory.  You will probably want to use this on a production server, unless you cannot afford the extra
       startup time.

       To  see  precompiling  in action, set Debug to 1 for the <b>Loader()</b> and for your application in general and
       watch your error_log for messages indicating scripts being cached.

   <b>No</b> <b>.htaccess</b> <b>or</b> <b>StatINC</b>
       Don't use .htaccess files or the StatINC setting in a production system as  there  are  many  more  files
       touched  per  request  using  these  features.   I've seen performance slow down by half because of using
       these.  For eliminating the .htaccess file, move settings into *.conf Apache files.

       Instead of StatINC, try using the StatINCMatch config, which will check a small subset of perl  libraries
       for  changes.   This  config  is  fine  for a production environment, and if used well might only incur a
       10-20% performance penalty, depending on the number of modules your system loads in all, as  each  module
       needs to be checked for changes on a per request basis.

   <b>Turn</b> <b>off</b> <b>Debugging</b>
       Turn off system debugging by setting Debug to 0-3.  Having the system debug config option on slows things
       down  immensely,  but  can  be  useful  when troubleshooting your application.  System level debugging is
       settings -3 through -1, where user level debugging is 1 to 3.  User level debugging is  much  more  light
       weight  depending  on  how many $Reponse-&gt;<b>Debug()</b> statements you use in your program, and you may want to
       leave it on.

   <b>Memory</b> <b>Sparing,</b> <b>NoCache</b>
       If you have a lot (1000's+) of scripts, and limited memory, set NoCache to 1, so  that  compiled  scripts
       are  not  cached  in memory.  You lose about 10-15% in speed for small scripts, but save at least 10K RAM
       per cached script.  These numbers are very rough and will largely depend on the size of your scripts  and
       includes.

   <b>Resource</b> <b>Limits</b>
       Make  sure  your  web  processes  do  not  use  too  many  resources  like  CPU  or  RAM  with  the handy
       Apache::Resource module.  Such a config might look like:

        PerlModule Apache::Resource
        PerlSetEnv PERL_RLIMIT_CPU  1000
        PerlSetEnv PERL_RLIMIT_DATA 60:60

       If ever a web process should begin to take more than 60M ram or use more than 1000 CPU seconds,  it  will
       be  killed  by  the  OS  this  way.   You  only want to use this configuration to protect against runaway
       processes and web program errors, not for terminating a normally functioning system, so set these  limits
       HIGH!

</pre><h4><b>TESTIMONIALS</b></h4><pre>
       Here are testimonials from those using Apache::ASP.  If you use this software and would like to show your
       support please send your testimonial to Apache::ASP mailing list at asp[at]perl.apache.org  and  indicate
       that we can post it to the web site.

       For a list of sites using Apache::ASP, please see the SITES USING section.

       Red Hat
           We're  using  Apache::ASP on www.redhat.com. We find Apache::ASP very easy to use, and it's quick for
           new developers to get up to speed with it, given that many people have already been  exposed  to  the
           ASP object model that Apache::ASP is based on.

           The documentation is comprehensive and easy to understand, and the community and maintainer have been
           very helpful whenever we've had questions.

       Anime Wallpaper at Anime Cubed
           Your  suite  has  got  our old CGI implementation beat, hands down. Our site is divided into two main
           areas, each run by a separate developer, and the Apache::ASP section runs head  and  shoulders  above
           the  other  side.  Anyone  who  is  still using anything but your product to implement their webpages
           seriously needs to take a look at how versatile and powerful Apache::ASP is. Thanks  again  for  such
           great work!

           I am the web master of <a href="http://www.gutscheinwurst.de">http://www.gutscheinwurst.de</a> , a German voucher community.  We use Apache::Asp
           to  run  our  backend  &amp;  administration  servers for the system. We started using Apache::ASP to see
           whether it is a valid alternative to IIS legacy  systems.  So  far  all  expectations  in  regard  of
           performance, ease of development and integration have been fulfilled or exceeded.  Thank's for such a
           great product :)

       D. L. Fox
           I had programmed in Perl for some time ... but, since I also knew VB, I had switched to VB in IIS-ASP
           for  web  stuff because of its ease of use in embedding code with HTML ...  When I discovered Apache-
           ASP, it was like a dream come true.  I would much rather  code  in  Perl  than  any  other  language.
           Thanks for such a fine product!

       HOSTING 321, LLC.
           After  discontinuing Windows-based hosting due to the high cost of software, our clients are thrilled
           with Apache::ASP and they swear ASP it's faster than before. Installation was a snap on our 25-server
           web farm with a small shell script and everything is running perfectly!  The  documentation  is  very
           comprehensive and everyone has been very helpful during this migration.

           Thank you!

           I would like to say that your ASP module rocks :-) We have practically stopped developing in anything
           else about half a year ago, and are now using Apache::ASP extensively. I just love Perl, and wherever
           we  are  not  "forced" to use JSP, we chose ASP. It is fast, reliable, versatile, documented in a way
           that is the best for professionals - so thank you for writing and maintaining it!

             -- Csongor Fagyal, Concept Online Ltd.

       WebTime
           As we have seen with WebTime, Apache::ASP is not only good  for the development of website, but  also
           for  the  development of webtools. Since I first discoverd it, I made it a must-have in my society by
           taking traditional PHP users to the world of perl afficionados.

           Having the possibility to use Apache::ASP with mod_perl or mod_cgi  make  it  constraintless  to  use
           because of CGI's universality and perl's portability.

             -- Grégoire Lejeune

       David Kulp
           First,  I  just want to say that I am very very impressed with Apache::ASP.  I just want to gush with
           praise after looking at many other implementations of perl embedded code and being very underwhelmed.
           This is so damn slick and clean.  Kudos! ...

           ... I'm very pleased how quickly I've been able to mock up the application.  I've been  writing  Perl
           CGI  off and on since 1993(!)  and I can tell you that Apache::ASP is a pleasure.  (Last year I tried
           Zope and just about threw my computer out the window.)

             -- David Kulp

       MFM Commmunication Software, Inc.
           Working in a team environment where you have HTML coders and perl coders, Apache::ASP makes  it  easy
           for the HTML folks to change the look of the page without knowing perl. Using Apache::ASP (instead of
           another  embedded  perl  solution)  allows  the  HTML  jockeys  to  use  a variety of HTML tools that
           understand ASP, which reduces the amount of code they break when editing the HTML.  Using Apache::ASP
           instead of M$ ASP allows us to use perl (far superior to VBScript) and Apache (far superior to IIS).

           We've been very pleased with Apache::ASP and its support.

       Planet of Music
           Apache::ASP has been a great tool.  Just a little background.... the whole site had been in cgi  flat
           files  when  I started here.  I was looking for a technology that would allow me to write the objects
           and NEVER invoke CGI.pm... I found it and hopefully I will be able to implement this every site I  go
           to.

           When I got here there was a huge argument about needing a game engine and I believe this has been the
           key...  Games  are  approx. 10 time faster than before. The games don't break anylonger. All in all a
           great tool for advancement.

       Cine.gr
           ...we ported our biggest yet ASP site from IIS (well, actually rewrote), Cine.gr and it is  a  killer
           site.   In  some  cases,  the whole thing got almost 25 (no typo) times faster...  None of this would
           ever be possible without Apache::ASP (I do not ever want to write ``print "&lt;HTML&gt;\n";'' again).

   <b>WILL</b> <b>BE</b> <b>DONE</b>
        + Database storage of $Session &amp; $Application, so web clusters
          may scale better than the current NFS/CIFS StateDir implementation
          allows, maybe via Apache::Session.

</pre><h4><b>CHANGES</b></h4><pre>
       Apache::ASP has been in development since 1998, and was production ready since its .02 release.  Releases
       are always used in a production setting before being made publically available.

       In  July  2000,  the  version numbers of releases went from .19 to 1.9 which is more relevant to software
       development outside the perl community.  Where a .10 perl module usually  means  first  production  ready
       release, this would be the equivalent of a 1.0 release for other kinds of software.

        + = improvement   - = bug fix    (d) = documentations

       $VERSION = 2.63; $DATE="03/14/2018"
            + Added section ``raw'' to MailErrors.inc to debug POSTs without
              form fields

            - MailErrorsHTML now uses monospaced fonts for errors. Easier on
              the eyes and more informative

       $VERSION = 2.62; $DATE="08/16/2011"
            - Fixed 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded' for AJAX POSTs post
              Firefox 3.x

            + First sourceforge.net hosted version

            + Incremented version number to actually match SVN branch tag

       $VERSION = 2.61; $DATE="05/24/2008"
            - updated for more recent mod_perl 2 environment to trigger correct loading of modules

            + loads modules in a backwards compatible way for older versions of mod_perl 1.99_07 to 1.99_09

            + license changes from GPL to Perl Artistic License

       $VERSION = 2.59; $DATE="05/23/2005"
            + added "use bytes" to Response object to calculate Content-Length
              correctly for UTF8 data, which should require therefore at least
              perl version 5.6 installed

            + updated to work with latest mod_perl 2.0 module naming convention,
              thanks to Randy Kobes for patch

            + examples now exclude usage of Apache::Filter &amp; Apache::SSI under mod_perl 2.0

       $VERSION = 2.57; $DATE="01/29/2004"
            - $Server-&gt;Transfer will update $0 correctly

            - return 0 for mod_perl handler to work with latest mod_perl 2 release
              when we were returning 200 ( HTTP_OK ) before

            - fixed bug in $Server-&gt;URL when called like $Server-&gt;URL($url)
              without parameters.  Its not clear which perl versions this bug
              affected.

       $VERSION = 2.55; $DATE="08/09/2003"
            - Bug fixes for running on standalone CGI mode on Win32 submitted
              by Francesco Pasqualini

            + Added Apache::ASP::Request::BINMODE for binmode() being
              called on STDIN after STDIN is tied to $Request object

            + New RequestBinaryRead configuration created, may be turned off
              to prevent $Request object from reading POST data

            ++ mod_perl 2 optimizations, there was a large code impact on this,
              as much code was restructured to reduce the differences between
              mod_perl 1 and mod_perl 2, most importantly, Apache::compat is
              no longer used

            + preloaded CGI for file uploads in the mod_perl environment

            - When XSLT config is set, $Response-&gt;Redirect() should work now
              Thanks to Marcus Zoller for pointing problem out

            + Added CookieDomain setting, documented, and added test to cover
              it in t/cookies.t . Setting suggested by Uwe Riehm, who nicely
              submitted some code for this.

       $VERSION = 2.53; $DATE="04/10/2003"
            + XMLSubs tags with "-" in them will have "-" replaced with "_" or underscore, so a
              tag like &lt;my:render-table /&gt; will be translated to &amp;my::render_table() ... tags with
              - in them are common in extended XML syntaxes, but perl subs cannot have - in them only.

            + Clean setting now works on output when $Response-&gt;{ContentType} begins with text/html;
              like "text/html; charset=iso-8859-2" ... before Clean would only work on output marked
              with ContentType text/html.  Thanks to Szymon Juraszczyk for recommending fix.

            --Fixed a bug which would cause Session_OnEnd to be called twice on sessions in a certain case,
              particularly when an old expired session gets reused by and web browser... this bug was
              a result of a incomplete session cleanup method in this case.  Thanks to Oleg Kobyakovskiy
              for reporting this bug.  Added test in t/session_events.t to cover this problem going forward.

            - Compile errors from Apache::ASP-&gt;Loader() were not being reported.  They will
              be reported again now.  Thanks to Thanos Chatziathanassiou for discovering and
              documenting this bug.  Added test in t/load.t to cover this problem going forward.

            + use of chr(hex($1)) to decode URI encoded parameters instead of pack("c",hex($1))
              faster &amp; more correct, thanks to Nikolay Melekhin for pointing out this need.

            (d) Added old perlmonth.com articles to ./site/articles in distribution
              and linked to them from the docs RESOURCES section

            (d) Updated documentation for the $Application-&gt;SessionCount API

            + Scripts with named subroutines, which is warned against in the style guide,
              will not be cached to help prevent my closure problems that often
              hurt new developers working in mod_perl environments.  The downside
              is that these script will have a performance penalty having to be
              recompiled each invocation, but this will kill many closure caching
              bugs that are hard to detect.

            - $Request-&gt;FileUpload('upload_file', 'BrowserFile') would return
              a glob before that would be the file name in scalar form.  However
              this would be interpreted as a reference incorrectly.  The fix
              is to make sure this is always a scalar by stringifying
              this data internally.  Thanks to Richard Curtis for pointing
              out this bug.

       $VERSION = 2.51; $DATE="02/10/2003"
            + added t/session_query_parse.t test to cover use of SessionQueryParse
              and $Server-&gt;URL APIs

            - Fixed duplicate "&amp;" bug associated with using $Server-&gt;URL
              and SessionQueryParse together

            + Patch to allow $Server-&gt;URL() to be called multiple times on the same URL
              as in $Server-&gt;URL($Server-&gt;URL($url, \%params), \%more_params)

            (d) Added new testimonials &amp; sites &amp; created a separate testimonials page.

            - SessionQueryParse will now add to &amp;amp; to the query strings
              embedded in the HTML, instead of &amp; for proper HTML generation.
              Thanks to Peter Galbavy for pointing out and Thanos Chatziathanassiou
              for suggesting the fix.

            - $Response-&gt;{ContentType} set to text/html for developer error reporting,
              in case this was set to something else before the error occurred.
              Thanks to Philip Mak for reporting.

            - Couple of minor bug fixes under PerlWarn use, thanks Peter Galbavy
              for reporting.

            + Added automatic load of "use Apache2" for compat with mod_perl2
              request objects when Apache::ASP is loaded via "PerlModule Apache::ASP"
              Thanks to Richard Curtis for reporting bug &amp; subsequent testing.

            - When GlobalPackage config changes, but global.asa has not, global.asa
              will be recompiled anyway to update the GlobalPackage correctly.
              Changing GlobalPackage before would cause errors if global.asa was
              already compiled.

            ++ For ANY PerlSetVar type config, OFF/Off/off will be assumed
               to have value of 0 for that setting.  Before, only a couple settings
               had this semantics, but they all do now for consistency.

            - Fix for InodeNames config on OpenBSD, or any OS that might have
              a device # of 0 for the file being stat()'d, thanks to Peter Galbavy
              for bug report.

            ++ Total XSLT speedups, 5-10% on large XSLT, 10-15% on small XSLT

            + bypass meta data check like expires for XSLT Cache() API use
              because XSLT transformations don't expire, saves hit to cache dbm
              for meta data

            + use of direct Apache::ASP::State methods like FETCH/STORE
              in Cache() layer so we don't have to go through slower tied interface.
              This will speed up XSLT &amp; and include output caching mostly.

            + minor optimizations for speed &amp; memory usage

       $VERSION = 2.49; $DATE="11/10/2002"
            -- bug introduced in 2.47 cached script compilations for executing
               scripts ( not includes ) of the same name in different directories
               for the same Global/GlobalPackage config for an application.
               Fix was to remove optimization that caused problem, and
               created test case t/same_name.t to cover bug.

       $VERSION = 2.47; $DATE="11/06/2002"
            ++ Runtime speed enhancements for 15-20% improvement including:
              + INTERNAL API ReadFile() now returns scalar ref as memory optimization
              + cache InodeNames config setting in ASP object now for common lookups
              + removed CompileChecksum() INTERNAL API, since it was an unnecessary
                method decomposition along a common code path
              + removed IsChanged() INTERNAL API since compiling of scripts
                is now handled by CompileInclude() which does this functionality already
              + removed unnecessary decomp of IncludesChanged() INTERNAL API, which was along
                critical code path
              + do not call INTERNAL SearchDirs() API when compiling base script
                since we have already validated its path earlier
              + Use stat(_) type shortcut for stat() &amp; -X calls where possible
              + Moved @INC initialization up to handler() &amp; consolidated with $INCDir lib
              + removed useless Apache::ASP::Collection::DESTROY
              + removed useless Apache::ASP::Server::DESTROY
              + removed useless Apache::ASP::GlobalASA::DESTROY
              + removed useless Apache::ASP::Response::DESTROY

            - Default path for $Response-&gt;{Cookies} was from CookiePath
              config, but this was incorrect as CookiePath config is only
              for $Session cookie, so now path for $Response-&gt;{Cookies}
              defaults to /

            - Fixed bug where global.asa events would get undefined with
              StatINC and GlobalPackage set when the GlobalPackage library
              changed &amp; get reloaded.

            (d) Documented long time config NoCache.

            -- Fixed use with Apache::Filter, capable as both source
               and destination filter.  Added ./site/eg/filter.filter example
               to demonstrate these abilities.

            + Use $r-&gt;err_headers_out-&gt;add Apache::Table API for cookies
              now instead of $r-&gt;cgi_header_out.  Added t/cookies.t test to
              cover new code path as well as general $Response-&gt;Cookies API.
              Also make cookies headers sorted by cookie and dictionary key
              while building headers for repeatable behavior, this latter was
              to facilitate testing.

            - fixed $Server-&gt;Mail error_log output when failing to connect
              to SMTP server.

            + added tests to cover UniquePackages &amp; NoCache configs since this
              config logic was updated

            + made deprecated warnings for use of certain $Response-&gt;Member
              calls more loudly write to error_log, so I can remove the AUTOLOAD
              for Response one day

            - Probably fixed behavior in CgiHeaders, at least under perl 5.8.0, and
              added t/cgi_headers.t to cover this config.

            + removed $Apache::ASP::CompressGzip setting ability, used to possibly
              set CompressGzip in the module before, not documented anyway

            + removed $Apache::ASP::Filter setting ability to set Filter globally,
              not documented anyway

            + removed old work around for setting ServerStarting to 0
              at runtime, which was bad for Apache::DBI on win32 a long
              time ago:

               $Apache::ServerStarting and $Apache::ServerStarting = 0;

              If this code is still needed in Apache::ASP-&gt;handler() let
              me know.

            + check to make sure data in internal database is a HASH ref
              before using it for session garbage collection.  This is to
              help prevent against internal database corruption in a
              network share that does not support flock() file locking.

            + For new XMLSubs ASP type &lt;%= %&gt; argument interpolation
              activated with XMLSubsPerlArgs 0, data references can now
              be passed in addition to SCALAR/string references, so one
              can pass an object reference like so:

                &lt;my:tag value="&lt;%= $Object %&gt;" /&gt;

              This will only work as long as the variable interpolation &lt;%= %&gt;
              are flushed against the containing " " or ' ', or else the object
              reference will be stringified when it is concatenated with
              the rest of the data.

              Testing for this feature was added to ./t/xmlsubs_aspargs.t

              This feature is still experimental, and its interface may change.
              However it is slated for the 3.0 release as default method,
              so feedback is appreciated.

            + For new XMLSubs ASP type &lt;%= %&gt; argument interpolation
              activated with XMLSubsPerlArgs 0, &lt;% %&gt; will no longer work,
              just &lt;%= %&gt;, as in

                &lt;my:tag value="some value &lt;%= $value %&gt; more data" /&gt;

              This feature is still experimental, and its interface may change.
              However it is slated for the 3.0 release as default method,
              so feedback is appreciated.

       $VERSION = 2.45; $DATE="10/13/2002"
            ++New XMLSubsPerlArgs config, default 1, indicates how
             XMLSubs arguments have always been parsed.  If set to 0,
             will enable new XMLSubs args that are more ASP like with
             &lt;%= %&gt; for dynamic interpolation, such as:

               &lt;my:xmlsub arg="&lt;%= $data %&gt;" arg2="text &lt;%= $data2 %&gt;" /&gt;

             Settings XMLSubsPerlArgs to 0 is experimental for now, but
             will become the default by Apache::ASP version 3.0

            ++Optimization for static HTML/XML files that are served up
             via Apache::ASP so that they are not compiled into perl subroutines
             first.  This makes especially native XSLT both faster &amp; take
             less memory to serve, before XSL &amp; XML files being transformed
             by XSLT would both be compiled as normal ASP script first, so
             now this will happen if they really are ASP scripts with embedded
             &lt;% %&gt; code blocks &amp; XMLSubs being executed.

            +Consolidate some config data for Apache::ASP-&gt;Loader to use
             globals in @Apache::ASP::CompileChecksumKeys to know which
             config data is important for precompiling ASP scripts.

            +Further streamlined code compilation.  Now both base
             scripts and includes use the internal CompileInclude() API
             to generate code.

            -Fixed runtime HTML error output when Debug is set to -2/2,
             so that script correctly again gets rendered in final perl form.
             Added compile time error output to ./site/eg/syntax_error.asp
             when a special link is clicked for a quick visual test.

            -Cleaned up some bad coding practices in ./site/eg/global.asa
             associated changes in other example files.  Comment example
             global.asa some for the first time reader

            -DemoASP.pm examples module needed "use strict" fix, thanks
             to Allan Vest for bug report

            --$rv = $Response-&gt;Include({ File =&gt; ..., Cache =&gt; 1});
             now works to get the first returned value fetched from
             the cache.  Before, because a list was always returned,
             $rv would have been equal to the number of items returned,
             even if the return value list has just one element.

            (d) added site/robots.txt file with just a comment for
                search engine indexing

            -fixed ./site/eg/binary_write.htm to not use
             $Response-&gt;{ContentLength} because it does not exist.
             Fixed it to use $Response-&gt;AddHeader now instead

       $VERSION = 2.41; $DATE="09/29/2002"
            -Removed CVS Revision tag from Apache::ASP::Date, which
             was causing bad revision numbers in CPAN after CVS integration
             of Apache::ASP

            +removed cgi/asp link to ../asp-perl from distribution.  This
             link was for the deprecated asp script which is now asp-perl

       $VERSION = 2.39; $DATE="09/10/2002"
            -Turn off $^W explicitly before reloading global.asa.  Reloading
             global.asa when $^W is set will trigger subroutine redefinition
             warnings.  Reloading global.asa should occur without any problems
             under normal usage of the system, thus this work around.

             This fix is important to UseStrict functionality because warnings
             automatically become thrown as die() errors with UseStrict enabled,
             so we have to disable normal soft warnings here.

            -$Response-&gt;Include() runtime errors now throw a die() that
             can be trapped.  This was old functionality that has been restored.
             Other compile time errors should still trigger a hard error
             like script compilation, global.asa, or $Response-&gt;Include()
             without an eval()

            +Some better error handling with Debug 3 or -3 set, cleaned
             up developer errors messages somewhat.

       $VERSION = 2.37; $DATE="07/03/2002"
            -Fixed the testing directory structures for t/long_names.t
             so that tar software like Archive::Tar &amp; Solaris tar that
             have problems with long file names will still be able
             to untar distribution successfully.  Now t/long_names.t
             generates its testing directory structures at runtime.

            -Fixes for "make test" to work under perl 5.8.0 RC2,
             courtesy of Manabu Higashida

            +SessionQueryForce setting created for disabling use of cookies
             for $Session session-id passing, rather requiring use of SessionQuery*
             functionality for session-id passing via URL query string.

             By default, even when SessionQuery* options are used, cookies will
             be used if available with SessionQuery* functionality acting only
             as a backup, so this makes it so that cookies will never be used.

            +Escape ' with HTMLEncode() to &amp;#39;

            -Trying to fix t/server_mail.t to work better for platforms
             that it should skip testing on.  Updated t/server.t test case.

            +Remove exit() from Makefile.PL so CPAN.pm's automatic
             follow prereq mechanism works correctly.  Thanks to Slaven Rezic
             for pointing this out.

            +Added Apache::compat loading in mod_perl environment for better
             mod_perl 2.0 support.

       $VERSION = 2.35; $DATE="05/30/2002"
            +Destroy better $Server &amp; $Response objects so that my
             closure references to these to not attempt to work in the future
             against invalid internal data. There was enough data left in these
             old objects to make debugging the my closure problem confusing, where
             it looked like the ASP object state became invalid.

            +Added system debug diagnostics to inspect StateManager group cleanup

            (d) Documentation update about flock() work around for
             Win95/Win98/WinMe systems, confirmed by Rex Arul

            (d) Documentation/site build bug found by Mitsunobu Ozato,
             where &lt;% %&gt; not being escaped correctly with $Server-&gt;HTMLEncode().
             New japanese documentation project started by him
             at <a href="http://sourceforge.jp/projects/apache-asp-jp/">http://sourceforge.jp/projects/apache-asp-jp/</a>

            -InitPackageGlobals() called after new Apache::ASP object created so
             core system templates can be compiled even when there was a runtime
             compilation error of user templates.  Bug fix needed pointed out by
             Eamon Daly

       $VERSION = 2.33; $DATE="04/29/2002"
            - fixed up t/server_mail.t test to skip if a sendmail server
              is not available on localhost.  We only want the test to run
              if there is a server to test against.

            + removed cgi/asp script, just a symlink now to the ./asp-perl script
              which in this way deprecates it.  I had it hard linked, but the
              distribution did not untar very well on win32 platform.

            + Reordered the modules in Bundle::Apache::ASP for a cleaner install.

            - Fixed bug where XMLSubs where removing &lt;?xml version ... ?&gt; tag
              when it was needed in XSLT mode.

            + $Server-&gt;Mail({ CC =&gt; '...', BCC =&gt; '...' }), now works to send
              CC &amp; BCC headers/recipients.

            + Removed $Apache::ASP::Register definition which defined the current
              executing Apache::ASP object.  Only one part of the application was
              using it, and this has been fixed.  This would have been an unsafe
              use of globals for a threaded environment.

            + Decreased latency when doing Application_OnStart, used to <a href="../man1/sleep.1.html">sleep</a>(1)
              for CleanupMaster sync, but this is not necessary for Application_OnStart
              scenario

            + Restructure code / core templates for MailErrorsTo funcationality.
              Wrote test mail_error.t to cover this.  $ENV{REMOTE_USER} will now
              be displayed in the MailErrorsTo message when defined from 401 basic auth.

            + $Server-&gt;RegisterCleanup should be thread safe now, as it no longer relies
              on access to @Apache::ASP::Cleanup for storing the CODE ref stack.

            + test t/inode_names.t for InodeNames and other file tests covering case
              of long file names.

            - Fixed long file name sub identifier bug.  Added test t/long_names.t.

            + CacheDir may now be set independently of StateDir.  It used to default
              to StateDir if it was set.

            ++ Decomposition of modules like Apache::ASP::Session &amp; Apache::ASP::Application
              out of ASP.pm file.  This should make the source more developer friendly.

              This selective code compilation also speeds up CGI requests that do not
              need to load unneeded modules like Apache::ASP::Session, by about 50%,
              so where CGI mode ran at about 2.1 hits/sec before, now for
              light requests that do not load $Session &amp; $Application, requests
              run at 3.4 hits/sec, this is on a dual PIII-450 linux 2.4.x

            - Caching like for XSLTCache now works in CGI mode.
              This was a bug that it did not before.

            + $Server-&gt;File() API added, acts as a wrapper around
              Apache-&gt;request-&gt;filename Added test in t/server.t

            ++  *** EXPERIMENTAL / ALPHA FEATURE NOTE BEGIN ***

              New $PERLLIB/Apache/ASP/Share/ directory created to
              hold system &amp; user contributed components, which will be found
              on the $Server-&gt;MapInclude() path, which helps $Response-&gt;Include
              search '.',Global,IncludesDir, and now Apache::ASP::Share for
              includes to load at runtime.

              The syntax for loading a shared include is to prefix the file
              name with Share:: as in:

               $Response-&gt;TrapInclude('Share::CORE/MailError.inc');

              New test to cover this at t/share.t

              This feature is experimental.  The naming convention may change
              and the feature may disappear altogether, so only use if you
              are interesting in experimenting with this feature &amp; will
              provide feedback about how it works.

              *** EXPERIMENTAL / ALPHA FEATURE NOTE END ***

            + asp-perl script now uses ./asp.conf instead of ./asp.config
              for runtime configuration via %Config defined there.  Update docs
              for running in standalone CGI mode

            + Make use of MANFEST.SKIP to not publish the dev/* files anymore.

            - Script_OnEnd guaranteed to run after $Response-&gt;End, but
              it will not run if there was an error earlier in the request.

            + lots of new test cases covering behaviour of $Response-&gt;End
              and $Response-&gt;Redirect under various conditions like XMLSubs
              and SoftRedirect and global.asa Script_OnStart

            + asp-perl will be installed into the bin executables when
              Apache::ASP is installed.  asp-perl is the command line version
              of Apache::ASP that can also be used to run script in CGI mode.
              Test case covering asp-perl functionality.

            + asp CGI/command line script now called asp-perl.  I picked this
              name because Apache::ASP often has the name asp-perl in distributions
              of the module.

            + Apache::ASP::CGI::Test class now subclass of Apache::ASP::CGI.  To facilitate
              this Apache::ASP::CGI::init() now called OO like Apache::ASP::CGI-&gt;init()
              Fixed up places where the old style was called.  New Test class allows
              a dummy Apache request object to be built which caches header &amp; body output
              for later inspection instead of writing it to STDOUT.

            - $Response-&gt;Redirect() under SoftRedirect 1 will not first Clear() buffer

            - $Response-&gt;Redirect() in an XMLSubs will work now ... behavior
              of $Response-&gt;Flush() being turned off in an XMLSubs was interfering with this.

            + srand() init tracking done better, thanks for patch from Ime Smits

            + Added file/directory being used for precompilation in
              Apache::ASP-&gt;Loader($file, ...) to output like:

               [Mon Feb 04 20:19:22 2002] [error] [asp] 4215 (re)compiled 22 scripts
                 of 22 loaded for $file

              This is so that when precompiling multiple web sites
              each with different directories, one can easier see the
              compile output relevant to the Loader() command being run.

            + better decomp of Apache::ASP site build files at ./build/* files,
              which is good should anyone look at it for ideas.

            + improved test suite to error when unintended output results from
              t/*.t test scripts.

            - () now supported in XMLSubsMatch config, added xmlsubsmatch.t test...
              specifically a config like

                PerlSetVar (aaa|bbb):\w+

              should now work.  Thanks for bug report from David Kulp.

            + Added an early srand() for better $ServerID creation

            + Work around for DSO problems where $r is not always correctly
              defined in Apache::ASP::handler().  Thanks to Tom Lear for patch.

       $VERSION = 2.31; $DATE="01/22/2002";
            + $Server-&gt;MapInclude() API extension created to wrap up Apache::ASP::SearchDirs
              functionality so one may do an conditional check for an include existence before
              executing $Response-&gt;Include().  Added API test to server.t

            + $Server-&gt;Transfer() now allows arguments like $Response-&gt;Include(), and now acts just
              as a wrapper for:

                $Response-&gt;Include($file, @args);
                $Response-&gt;End();

              added test case at t/server_transfer.t

            + Removed dependency of StatINC functionality on Apache::Symbol.  Apache::Symbol
              is no longer required.  Added test of t/stat_inc.t for correct StatINC initialization
              for platforms where Devel::Symdump is present.

            + Better error message when $Request-&gt;Params has not been defined with RequestParams
              config &amp; it gets used in script.  Added test case as t/request_params_none.t

            + Directories cannot now be included as scripts via $Response-&gt;Include(), added
              test case to t/include.t

            - No longer make $Response-&gt;Flush dependent on $Response-&gt;IsClientConnected() to
              be true to write output to client.  There have been spurious errors reported
              about the new ( &gt;= 2.25 ) IsClientConnected code, and this will limit the impact
              of that functionality possibly not working still to those users explicitly using
              that API.

            + $Response-&gt;AddHeader($header_name, $value) now will set $Response members
              for these headers: Content-Type, Cache-Control, Expires.  This is to avoid
              both the application &amp; Apache::ASP sending out duplicate headers.  Added
              test cases for this to t/response.t

            + split up Bundle::Apache::ASP into that, and Bundle::Apache::ASP::Extra
              the former with just the required modules to run, and the latter
              for extra functionality in Apache::ASP

            + new $Request-&gt;{Method} member to return $r-&gt;method of GET or POST that
              client browser is requesting, added t/request.t sub test to cover this member.

       $VERSION = 2.29; $DATE="11/19/2001";
            +Added some extra help text to the ./cgi/asp --help message
             to clarify how to pass arguments to a script from the command line.

            +When using $Server-&gt;Mail() API, if Content-Type header is set,
             and MIME-Version is not, then a "MIME-Version: 1.0" header will be sent
             for the email.  This is correct according to RFC 1521 which specifies
             for the first time the Content-Type: header for email documents.
             Thanks to Philip Mak for pointing out this correct behavior.

            +Made dependent on MLDBM::Sync version .25 to pass the taint_check.t test

            +Improved server_mail.t test to work with mail servers were relaying is denied

            +Added &lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt; tags to MailErrorsTo email

            --Fixed SessionCount / Session_OnEnd bug, where these things were not
             working for $Sessions that never had anything written to them.
             This bug was introduced in 2.23/2.25 release.

             There was an optimization in 2.23/2.25 where a $Session that was never
             used does not write its state lock file &amp; dbm files to disk, only if
             it gets written too like $Session-&gt;{MARK}++.  Tracking of these NULL $Sessions
             then is handled solely in the internal database.  For $Session garbage
             collection though which would fire Session_OnEnd events and update
             SessionCount, the Apache::ASP::State-&gt;GroupMembers() function was just
             looking for state files on disk ... now it looks in the internal database
             too for SessionID records for garbage collection.

             Added a test at ./t/session_events.t for these things.

            +Some optimizations for $Session API use.

            +Added support for XSLT via XML::LibXSLT, patch courtesy of Michael Buschauer

            -Got rid of an warning when recompiling changing includes under perl 5.6.1...
             undef($code) method did not work for this perl version, rather undef(&amp;$code) does.
             Stopped using using Apache::Symbol for this when available.

            -Make Apache::ASP script run under perl taint checking -T for perl 5.6.1...
             $code =~ tr///; does not work to untaint here, so much use the slower:
             $code =~ /^(.*)$/s; $code = $1; method to untaint.

            -Check for inline includes changing, included in a dynamic included
             loaded at runtime via $Response-&gt;Include().  Added test case for
             this at t/include_change.t.  If an inline include of a dynamic include
             changes, the dynamic include should get recompiled now.

            -Make OK to use again with PerlTaintCheck On, with MLDBM::Sync 2.25.
             Fixed in ASP.pm, t/global.asa, and created new t/taint_check.t test script

            +Load more modules when Apache::ASP is loaded so parent will share more
             with children httpd:
              Apache::Symbol
              Devel::Symdump
              Config
              lib
              MLDBM::Sync::SDBM_File

            +When FileUploadMax bytes is exceeded for a file upload, there will not
             be an odd error anymore resulting from $CGI::POST_MAX being triggered,
             instead the file upload input will simply be ignored via $CGI::DISABLE_UPLOADS.
             This gives the developer the opportunity to tell the user the the file upload
             was too big, as demonstrated by the ./site/eg/file_upload.asp example.

             To not let the web client POST a lot of data to your scripts as a form
             of a denial of service attack use the apache config LimitRequestBody for the
             max limits.  You can think of PerlSetVar FileUploadMax as a soft limit, and
             apache's LimitRequestBody as a hard limit.

            --Under certain circumstances with file upload, it seems that IsClientConnected()
             would return an aborted client value from $r-&gt;connection-&gt;aborted, so
             the buffer output data would not be flushed to the client, and
             the HTML page would return to the browser empty.  This would be under
             normal file upload use.  One work-around was to make sure to initialize
             the $Request object before $Response-&gt;IsClientConnected is called,
             then $r-&gt;connection-&gt;aborted returns the right value.

             This problem was probably introduced with IsClientConnected() code changes
             starting in the 2.25 release.

       $VERSION = 2.27; $DATE="10/31/2001";
            + Wrapped call to $r-&gt;connection-&gt;fileno in eval {} so to
              preserve backwards compatibility with older mod_perl versions
              that do not have this method defined.  Thanks to Helmut Zeilinger
              for catching this.

            + removed .<a href="file:/dev">/dev</a> directory from distribution, useless clutter

            + Removed dependency on HTTP::Date by taking code into
              Apache::ASP as Apache::ASP::Date.  This relieves
              the dependency of Apache::ASP on libwww LWP libraries.
              If you were using HTTP::Date functions before without loading
              "use HTTP::Date;" on your own, you will have to do this now.

            + Streamlined code execution.  Especially worked on
              $Response-&gt;IsClientConnected which gets called during
              a normal request execution, and got rid of IO::Select
              dependency. Some function style calls instead of OO style
              calls where private functions were being invokes that one
              would not need to override.

            - Fixed possible bug when flushing a data buffer where there
              is just a '0' in it.

            + Updated docs to note that StateCache config was deprecated
              as of 2.23.  Removed remaining code that referenced the config.

            + Removed references to unused OrderCollections code.

            - Better Cache meta key, lower chance of collision with
              unrelated data since its using the full MD5 keyspace now

            + Optimized some debugging statements that resulted
              from recent development.

            + Tie::TextDir .04 and above is supported for StateDB
              and CacheDB settings with MLDBM::Sync .21. This is good for
              CacheDB where output is larger and there are not many
              versions to cache, like for XSLTCache, where the site is
              mostly static.

            + Better RESOURCES section to web site, especially with adding
              some links to past Apache::ASP articles &amp; presentations.

       $VERSION = 2.25; $DATE="10/11/2001";
            + Improved ./site/apps/search application, for better
              search results at Apache::ASP site.  Also, reengineered
              application better, with more perl code moved to global.asa.
              Make use of MLDBM::Sync::SDBM_File, where search database
              before was engineering around SDBM_File's shortcomings.

            - Fix for SessionSerialize config, which broke in 2.23
              Also, added t/session_serialize.t to test suite to catch
              this problem in the future.

       $VERSION = 2.23; $DATE="10/11/2001";
            +Make sure a couple other small standard modules get loaded
             upon "PerlModule Apache::ASP", like Time::HiRes, Class::Struct,
             and MLDBM::Serializer::Data::Dumper.  If not available
             these modules won't cause errors, but will promote child httpd
             RAM sharing if they are.

            -XMLSubs args parsing fix so an arg like z-index
             does not error under UseStrict.  This is OK now:

              &lt;my:layer z-index=3 top=0 left=0&gt; HTML &lt;/my:layer&gt;

            -Only remove outermost &lt;SCRIPT&gt; tags from global.asa
             for IIS/PerlScript compatibility.  Used to remove
             all &lt;SCRIPT&gt; tags, which hurt when some subs in globa.asa
             would be printing some JavaScript.

            +$Response-&gt;{IsClientConnected} now updated correctly
             before global.asa Script_OnStart.  $Response-&gt;IsClientConnect()
             can be used for accurate accounting, while
             $Response-&gt;{IsClientConnected} only gets updated
             after $Response-&gt;Flush().  Added test cases to response.t

            +$Server-&gt;HTMLEncode(\$data) API extension, now can take
             scalar ref, which can give a 5% improvement in benchmarks
             for data 100K in size.

            -Access to $Application is locked when Application_OnEnd &amp;
             Application_OnStart is called, creating a critical section
             for use of $Application

            ++MLDBM::Sync used now for core DBM support in Apache::ASP::State.
             This drastically simplifies/stabilizes the code in there
             and will make it easier for future SQL database plugins.

            +New API for accessing ASP object information in non content
             handler phases:

               use Apache::ASP;
               sub My::Auth::handler {
                 my $r = shift;
                 my $ASP = Apache::ASP-&gt;new($r)
                 my $Session = $ASP-&gt;Session;
               }

             In the above example, $Session would be the same $Session
             object created later while running the ASP script for this
             same request.

             Added t/asp_object.t test for this.  Fixed global.asa to only
             init StateDir when application.asp starts which is the first
             test script to run.

            -Fixed on Win32 to make Apache::ASP-&gt;new($r) able to create
             multiple master ASP objects per request.  Was not reentrant
             safe before, particularly with state locking for dbms like
             $Application &amp; $Session.

            ++Output caching for includes, built on same layer ( extended )
             as XSLTCache, test suite at t/cache.t.  Enabled with special
             arguments to

               $Response-&gt;Include(\%args, @include_args)
               $Response-&gt;TrapInclude(\%args, @include_args)
               $Server-&gt;Execute(\%args, @include_args)

             where %args = (
               File =&gt; 'file.inc',
               Cache =&gt; 1, # to activate cache layer
               Expires =&gt; 3600, # to expire in one hour
               LastModified =&gt; time() - 600, # to expire if cached before 10 minutes ago
               Key =&gt; $Request-&gt;Form, # to cache based on checksum of serialized form data,
               Clear =&gt; 1, # to not allow fetch from cache this time, will always execute include
             );

             Like the XSLTCache, it uses MLDBM::Sync::SDBM_File
             by default, but can use DB_File or GDBM_File if
             CacheDB is set to these.

             See t/cache.t for API support until this is documented.

            +CacheSize now supports units of M, K, B like

              CacheSize 10M
              CacheSize 10240K
              CacheSize 10000000B
              CacheSize 10000000

            -Better handling of $Session-&gt;Abandon() so multiple
             request to the same session while its being destroyed
             will have the right effect.

            +Optimized XMLSubs parsing.  Scripts with lots lof XMLSubs
             now parse faster for the first time.  One test script with
             almost 200 such tags went from a parse time of around 3 seconds
             to .7 seconds after optimizations.

            +Updated performance tuning docs, particularly for using
             Apache::ASP-&gt;Loader()

            +$Server-&gt;URL($url, \%params) now handles array refs
             in the params values like
               $Server-&gt;URL($url, { key =&gt; [ qw( value1 value2 ) ] })

             This is so that query string data found in
             $Request-&gt;QueryString that gets parsed into this form
             from a string like: ?key=value&amp;key=value2 would be
             able to be reused passed back to $Server-&gt;URL to
             create self referencing URLs more easily.

            -Bug fix where XMLSubs like &lt;s:td /&gt; now works on perl
             5.005xx, thanks to Philip Mak for reporting &amp; fix.

            +When searching for included files, will now join
             the absolute path of the directory of the script
             with the name of the file if its a relative file
             name like ./header.inc.  Before, would just look
             for something like ././header.inc by using '.'
             as the first directory to look for includes in.

             The result of this is that scripts in two directories
             configured with the same Global setting should be able
             to have separate local header.inc files without causing
             a cached namespace collision.

            +$Server-&gt;Config() call will return a hash ref
             to all the config setting for that request, like
             Apache-&gt;dir_config would.

            -StatINC setting with Apache::ASP-&gt;Loader() works again.
             This makes StatINC &amp; StatINCMatch settings viable
             for production &amp; development use when the system has
             very many modules.

            -Cookieless session support with configs like SessionQueryParse
             and SessionQuery now work for URLs with frags in them
             like <a href="http://localhost">http://localhost</a>?arg=value#frag

            +@rv = $Response-&gt;Include() now works where there are
             multiple return values from an include like:
             &lt;% return(1,2); %&gt;

       $VERSION = 2.21; $DATE="8/5/2001";
            +Documented RequestParams config in CONFIG misc section.

            +Documented new XSLT caching directives.

            +Updated ./site/eg/.htaccess XSLT example config
             to use XSLTCache setting.

            +New FAQ section on why perl variables are sticky globals,
             suggested by Mark Seger.

            -push Global directory onto @INC during ASP script execution
             Protect contents of original @INC with local.  This makes
             things compatible with .09 Apache::ASP where we always had
             Global in @INC.  Fixed needed by Henrik Tougaard

            - ; is a valid separator like &amp; for QueryString Parameters
             Fixed wanted by Anders

            -XSMLSubsMatch doc fix in CONFIG section

            +Reduces number of Session groups to 16 from 32, so
             session manager for small user sets will be that much faster.

            +optimizations for internal database, $Application, and $Session
             creation.

            +XSLTCache must be set for XSLT caching to begin using CacheDir

            +CacheDB like StateDB bug sets dbm format for caching, which
             defaults to MLDBM::Sync::SDBM_File, which works well for caching
             output sizes &lt; 50K

            +CacheDir config for XSLT caching ... defaults to StateDir

            +CacheSize in bytes determines whether the caches in CacheDir
             are deleted at the end of the request.  A cache will be
             reset in this way back to 0 bytes. Defaults to 10000000 bytes
             or about 10M.

            +Caching infrastructure work that is being used in XSLT
             can be leveraged later for output caching of includes,
             or arbitrary user caching.

            -t/server_mail.t test now uses valid email for testing
             purposes ... doesn't actually send a mail, but for SMTP
             runtime validation purposes it should be OK.

            +fixed where POST data was read from under MOD_PERL,
             harmless bug this was that just generated the wrong
             system debugging message.

       $VERSION = 2.19; $DATE="7/10/2001";
            +update docs in various parts

            +added ./make_httpd/build_httpds.sh scripts for quick builds
             of apache + mod_perl + mod_ssl

            ++plain CGI mode available for ASP execution.
             cgi/asp script can now be used to execute ASP
             scripts in CGI mode.  See CGI perldoc section for more info.
             The examples in ./site/eg have been set up to run
             in cgi mode if desired.  Configuration in CGI section
             only tested for Apache on Linux.

            -Fixed some faulty or out of date docs in XML/XSLT section.

            +added t/server_mail.t test for $Server-&gt;Mail(), requires
             Net::SMTP to be configured properly to succeed.

            +Net::SMTP debugging not enabled by Debug 1,2,3 configs,
             not only when system debugging is set with Debug -1,-2,-3
             However, a Debug param passed to $Server-&gt;Mail() will
             successfully override the Debug -1,-2,-3 setting even
             when its Debug =&gt; 0

            -Check for undef values during stats for inline includes
             so we don't trigger uninitialized warnings

            +Documented ';' may separate many directories in the IncludesDir
             setting for creating a more flexible includes search path.

       $VERSION = 2.17; $DATE="6/17/2001";
            +Added ASP perl mmm-mode subclass and configuration
             in editors/mmm-asp-perl.el file for better emacs support.
             Updated SYNTAX/Editors documentation.

            +Better debugging error message for Debug 2 or 3 settings
             for global.asa errors.  Limit debug output for lines
             preceding rendered script.

            -In old inline include mode, there should no longer
             be the error "need id for includes" when using
             $Response-&gt;Include() ... if DynamicIncludes were
             enabled, this problem would not have likely occurred
             anyway.  DynamicIncludes are preferable to use so
             that compiled includes can be shared between scripts.
             This bug was likely introduced in version 2.11.

            -Removed logging from $Response-&gt;BinaryWrite() in regular
             debug mode 1 or 2.  Logging still enabled in system Debug mode, -1 or -2

            -Removed other extra system debugging call that is really not
             necessary.

       $VERSION = 2.15; $DATE="06/12/2001";
            -Fix for running under perl 5.6.1 by removing parser optimization
             introduced in 2.11.

            -Now file upload forms, forms with ENCTYPE="multipart/form-data"
             can have multiple check boxes and select items marked for
             @params = $Request-&gt;Form('param_name') functionality.  This
             will be demonstrated via the ./site/eg/file_upload.asp example.

       $VERSION = 2.11; $DATE="05/29/2001";
            +Parser optimization from Dariusz Pietrzak

            -work around for global destruction error message for perl 5.6
             during install

            +$Response-&gt;{IsClientConnected} now will be set
             correctly with ! $r-&gt;connection-&gt;aborted after each
             $Response-&gt;Flush()

            +New XSLTParser config which can be set to XML::XSLT or
             XML::Sablotron.  XML::Sablotron renders 10 times faster,
             but differently.  XML::XSLT is pure perl, so has wider
             platform support than XML::Sablotron.  This config affects
             both the XSLT config and the $Server-&gt;XSLT() method.

            +New $Server-&gt;XSLT(\$xsl_data, \$xml_data) API which
             allows runtime XSLT on components instead of having to process
             the entire ASP output as XSLT.

            -XSLT support for XML::XSL 0.32.  Things broke after .24.

            -XSLTCacheSize config no longer supported.  Was a bad
             Tie::Cache implementation.  Should be file based cache
             to greatly increases cache hit ratio.

            ++$Response-&gt;Include(), $Response-&gt;TrapInclude(),
             and $Server-&gt;Execute() will all take a scalar ref
             or \'asdfdsafa' type code as their first argument to execute
             a raw script instead of a script file name.  At this time,
             compilation of such a script, will not be cached.  It is
             compiled/executed as an anonymous subroutine and will be freed
             when it goes out of scope.

            + -p argument to cgi/asp script to set GlobalPackage
             config for static site builds

            -pod commenting fix where windows clients are used for
             ASP script generation.

            +Some nice performance enhancements, thank to submissions from
             Ime Smits.  Added some 1-2% per request execution speed.

            +Added StateDB MLDBM::Sync::SDBM_File support for faster
             $Session + $Application than DB_File, yet still overcomes
             SDBM_File's 1024 bytes value limitation.  Documented in
             StateDB config, and added Makefile.PL entry.

            +Removed deprecated MD5 use and replace with Digest::MD5 calls

            +PerlSetVar InodeNames 1 config which will compile scripts hashed by
             their device &amp; inode identifiers, from a stat($file)[0,1] call.
             This allows for script directories, the Global directory,
             and IncludesDir directories to be symlinked to without
             recompiling identical scripts.  Likely only works on Unix
             systems.  Thanks to Ime Smits for this one.

            +Streamlined code internally so that includes &amp; scripts were
             compiled by same code.  This is a baby step toward fusing
             include &amp; script code compilation models, leading to being
             able to compile bits of scripts on the fly as ASP subs,
             and being able to garbage collect ASP code subroutines.

            -removed @_ = () in script compilation which would trigger warnings
             under PerlWarn being set, thanks for Carl Lipo for reporting this.

            -StatINC/StatINCMatch fix for not undeffing compiled includes
             and pages in the GlobalPackage namespace

            -Create new HTML::FillInForm object for each FormFill
             done, to avoid potential bug with multiple forms filled
             by same object.  Thanks to Jim Pavlick for the tip.

            +Added PREREQ_PM to Makefile.PL, so CPAN installation will
             pick up the necessary modules correctly, without having
             to use Bundle::Apache::ASP, thanks to Michael Davis.

            + &gt; mode for opening lock files, not &gt;&gt;, since its faster

            +$Response-&gt;Flush() fixed, by giving $| = 1 perl hint
             to $r-&gt;print() and the rest of the perl sub.

            +$Response-&gt;{Cookies}{cookie_name}{Expires} = -86400 * 300;
             works so negative relative time may be used to expire cookies.

            +Count() + Key() Collection class API implementations

            +Added editors/aasp.vim VIM syntax file for Apache::ASP,
             courtesy of Jon Topper.

            ++Better line numbering with #line perl pragma.  Especially
             helps with inline includes.  Lots of work here, &amp; integrated
             with Debug 2 runtime pretty print debugging.

            +$Response-&gt;{Debug} member toggles on/off whether
             $Response-&gt;Debug() is active, overriding the Debug setting
             for this purpose.  Documented.

            -When Filter is on, Content-Length won't be set and compression
             won't be used.  These things would not work with a filtering
             handler after Apache::ASP

       $VERSION = 2.09; $DATE="01/30/2001";
            +Examples in ./site/eg are now UseStrict friendly.
             Also fixed up ./site/eg/ssi_filter.ssi example.

            +Auto purge of old stale session group directories, increasing
             session manager performance when using Sessions when migrating
             to Apache::ASP 2.09+ from older versions.

            +SessionQueryParse now works for all $Response-&gt;{ContentType}
             starting with 'text' ... before just worked with text/html,
             now other text formats like wml will work too.

            +32 groups instead of 64, better inactive site session group purging.

            +Default session-id length back up to 32 hex bytes.
             Better security vs. performance, security more important,
             especially when performance difference was very little.

            +PerlSetVar RequestParams 1 creates $Request-&gt;Params
             object with combined contents of $Request-&gt;QueryString
             and $Request-&gt;Form

            ++FormFill feature via HTML::FillInForm.  Activate with
             $Response-&gt;{FormFill} = 1 or PerlSetVar FormFill 1
             See site/eg/formfill.asp for example.

            ++XMLSubs tags of the same name may be embedded in each other
             recursively now.

            +No umask() use on Win32 as it seems unclear what it would do

            +simpler Apache::ASP::State file handle mode of &gt;&gt; when opening
             lock file.  saves doing a -e $file test.

            +AuthServerVariables config to init $Request-&gt;ServerVariables
             with basic auth data as documented.  This used to be default
             behavior, but triggers "need AuthName" warnings from recent
             versions of Apache when AuthName is not set.

            -Renamed Apache::ASP::Loader class to Apache::ASP::Load
             as it collided with the Apache::ASP-&gt;Loader() function
             namespace.  Class used internally by Apache::ASP-&gt;Loader()
             so no public API changed here.

            +-Read of POST input for $Request-&gt;BinaryRead() even
              if its not from a form.  Only set up $Request-&gt;Form
              if this is from a form POST.

            +faster POST/GET param parsing

       $VERSION = 2.07; $DATE="11/26/2000";
            -+-+ Session Manager
             empty state group directories are not removed, thus alleviating
             one potential race condition.  This impacted performance
             on idle sites severely as there were now 256 directories
             to check, so made many performance enhancements to the
             session manager.  The session manager is built to handle
             up to 20,000 client sessions over a 20 minute period.  It
             will slow the system down as it approaches this capacity.

             One such enhancement was session-ids now being 11 bytes long
             so that its .lock file is only 16 characters in length.
             Supposedly some file systems lookup files 16 characters or
             less in a fast hashed lookup.  This new session-id has
             4.4 x 10^12 possible values.  I try to keep this space as
             large as possible to prevent a brute force attack.

             Another enhancement was to limit the group directories
             to 64 by only allowing the session-id prefix to be [0-3][0-f]
             instead of [0-f][0-f], checking 64 empty directories on an
             idle site takes little time for the session manager, compared
             to 256 which felt significant from the client end, especially
             on Win32 where requests are serialized.

             If upgrading to this version, you would do well to delete
             empty StateDir group directories while your site is idle.
             Upgrading during an idle time will have a similar effect,
             as old Apache::ASP versions would delete empty directories.

            -$Application-&gt;GetSession($session_id) now creates
             an session object that only lasts until the next
             invocation of $Application-&gt;GetSession().  This is
             to avoid opening too many file handles at once,
             where each session requires opening a lock file.

            +added experimental support for Apache::Filter 1.013
             filter_register call

            +make test cases for $Response-&gt;Include() and
             $Response-&gt;TrapInclude()

            +Documented CollectionItem config.

            +New $Request-&gt;QueryString('multiple args')-&gt;Count()
             interface implemented for CollectionItem config.
             Also $Request-&gt;QueryString('multiple args')-&gt;<a href="../man1/Item.1.html">Item</a>(1) method.
             Note ASP collections start counting at 1.

            --fixed race condition, where multiple processes might
             try creating the same state directory at the same time, with
             one winning, and one generating an error.  Now, web process
             will recheck for directory existence and error if
             it doesn't.

            -global.asa compilation will be cached correctly, not
             sure when this broke.  It was getting reloaded every request.

            -StateAllWrite config, when set creates state files
             with a+rw or 0666 permissions, and state directories
             with a+rwx or 0777 permissions.  This allows web servers
             running as different users on the same machine to share a
             common StateDir config.  Also StateGroupWrite config
             with perms 0770 and 0660 respectively.

            -Apache::ASP-&gt;Loader() now won't follow links to
             directories when searching for scripts to load.

            +New RegisterIncludes config which is on by default only
             when using Apache::ASP-&gt;Loader(), for compiling includes
             when precompiling scripts.

            +Apache::ASP::CompileInclude path optimized, which underlies
             $Response-&gt;Include()

            +$Request-&gt;QueryString-&gt;('foo')-&gt;Item() syntax enabled
             with CollectionItem config setting.  Default syntax
             supported is $Request-&gt;QueryString('foo') which is
             in compatible.  Other syntax like $Request-&gt;{Form}{foo}
             and $Request-&gt;Form-&gt;Item('foo') will work in either case.

            +New fix suggested for missing Apache reference in
             Apache::ASP handler startup for RedHat RPMs.  Added
             to error message.

            --Backup flock() unlocking try for QNX will not corrupt the
             normal flock() LOCK_UN usage, after trying to unlock a file
             that doesn't exist.  This bug was uncovered from the below
             group deletion race condition that existed.

            -Session garbage collection will not delete new group
             directories that have just been created but are empty.
             There was a race condition where a new group directory would
             be created, but then deleted by a garbage collector before
             it could be initialized correctly with new state files.

            +Better random session-id checksums for $Session creation.
             per process srand() initialization, because srand()
             may be called once prefork and never called again.
             Call without arguments to rely on perl's decent rand
             seeding.  Then when calling rand() in Secret() we have
             enough random data, that even if someone else calls srand()
             to something fixed, should not mess things up terribly since
             we checksum things like $$ &amp; time, as well as perl memory
             references.

            +XMLSubs installation make test.

             out special characters of the open() call when reading local
             files.

             This bug would allow a malicious user possible writing
             of files in the same directory as the source.asp script.  This
             writing exploit would only have effect if the web server user
             has write permission on those files.

             !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

            -$0 now set to transferred file, when using $Server-&gt;Transfer

            -Fix for XMLSubsMatch parsing on cases with 2 or more args passed
             to tag sub that was standalone like
               &lt;Apps:header type="header" title="Moo" foo="moo" /&gt;

            -sub second timing with Time::HiRes was adding &lt;!-- --&gt;
             comments by HTML by default, which would possibly
             break specific programs looking for precise HTML output.
             Now this behavior must be explicitly turned on with
             the TimeHiRes config setting.

             These comments will only appear in HTML only if
             Debug is enabled as well.

       $VERSION = 1.91; $DATE="07/02/2000";
            +Documented XMLSubsMatch &amp; XSLT* configuration
             settings in CONFIG section.

            +XSLT XSL template is now first executed as an
             ASP script just like the XML scripts.  This is

            +$Server-&gt;Execute and $Server-&gt;Transfer API extensions
             implemented.  Execute is the same as $Request-&gt;Include()
             and $Server-&gt;Transfer is like an apache internal redirect
             but keeps the current ASP objects for the next script.

             Added examples, transfer.htm, and modified dynamic_includes.htm.

            +Better compile time error debugging with Debug 2 or -2.
             Will hilite/link the buggy line for global.asa errors,
             include errors, and XML/XSLT errors just like with
             ASP scripts before.

            +Nice source hiliting when viewing source for the example
             scripts.

            +Runtime string writing optimization for static HTML going
             through $Response.

            +New version numbering just like everyone else.  Starting at 1.91
             since I seem to be off by a factor of 10, last release would have

            +XMLSubsMatch and XSLT* settings documented in
             the XML/XSLT section of the site/README.

            -XMLSubsMatch will strip parens in a pattern match
             so it does not interfere with internal matching use.

            +XSLT integration allowing XML to be rendered by XSLT
             on the fly.  XSLT specifies XSL file to transform XML.
             XSLTMatch is a regexp that matches XML file names, like \.xml$,
             which will be transformed by XSLT setting, default .*

             XSLTCacheSize when specified uses Tie::Cache to cached XML DOMs
             internally and cache XSLT transformations output per XML/XSL
             combination.  XML DOM objects can take a lot of RAM, so use
             this setting judiciously like setting to 100.  Definitely
             experiment with this value.

            +More client info in the error mail feature, including
             client IP, form data, query string, and HTTP_* client headers

            +With Time::HiRes loaded, and Debug set to non 0,
             will add a &lt;!-- Apache::ASP served request in xx.xx seconds --&gt;
             to text/html output, similar to Cocoon, per user request
             Will also add this to the system debug error log output
             when Debug is &lt; 0

            -bug fix on object initialization optimization earlier
             in this release, that was introduced for faster event
             handler execution.

            +Apache::ASP::Parse() takes a file name, scalar, or
             scalar ref for arguments of data to parse for greater
             integration ability with other applications.

            +PodComments optimization, small speed increase at
             compilation time.

            +String optimization on internal rendering that avoids
             unnecessary copying of static html, by using refs.  Should
             make a small difference on sites with large amounts of
             static html.

            +CompressGzip setting which, when Compress::Zlib is installed,
             will compress text/html automatically going out to the web
             browser if the client supports gzip encoding.

            ++Script_OnFlush event handler, and auxiliary work optimizing
             asp events in general.  $Response-&gt;{BinaryRef} created which
             is a reference to outgoing output, which can be used
             to modify the data at runtime before it goes out to the client.

            +Some code optimizations that boost speed from 22 to 24
             hits per second when using Sessions without $Application,
             on a simple hello world benchmark on a WinNT PII300.

            ++Better SessionManagement, more aware of server farms that
             don't have reliable NFS locking.  The key here is to have only
             one process on one server in charge of session garbage collection
             at any one time, and try to create this situation with a snazzy
             CleanupMaster routine.  This is done by having a process register
             itself in the internal database with a server key created at
             apache start time.  If this key gets stale, another process can
             become the master, and this period will not exceed the period
             SessionTimeout / StateManager.

             ** Work on session manager sponsored by LRN, <a href="http://www.lrn.com">http://www.lrn.com</a>.  **
             ** This work was used to deploy a server farm in production with  **
             ** NFS mounted StateDir. Thanks to Craig Samuel for his belief in **
             ** open source. :)                                                **

             Future work for server farm capabilities might include breaking
             up the internal database into one of 256 internal databases
             hashed by the first 2 chars of the session id.  Also on the plate
             is Apache::Session like abilities with locking and/or data storage
             occurring in a SQL database.  The first dbs to be done will include
             MySQL &amp; Oracle.

            +Better session security which will create a new session id for an
             incoming session id that does not match one already seen.  This will
             help for those with Search engines that have bookmarked
             pages with the session ids in the query strings.  This breaks away
             from standard ASP session id implementation which will automatically
             use the session id presented by the browser, now a new session id will
             be returned if the presented one is invalid or expired.

            -$Application-&gt;GetSession will only return a session if
             one already existed.  It would create one before by default.

            +Script_OnFlush global.asa event handler, and $Response-&gt;{BinaryRef}
             member which is a scalar reference to the content about to be flushed.
             See ./site/eg/global.asa for example usage, used in this case to
             insert font tags on the fly into the output.

            +Highlighting and linking of line error when Debug is set to 2 or -2.

            --removed fork() call from flock() backup routine? How did
              that get in there?  Oh right, testing on Win32. :(
              Very painful lesson this one, sorry to whom it may concern.

            +$Application-&gt;SessionCount support turned off by default
             must enable with SessionCount config option.  This feature
             puts an unnecessary load on busy sites, so not default
             behavior now.

            ++XMLSubsMatch setting that allows the developer to
             create custom tags XML style that execute perl subroutines.
             See ./site/eg/xml_subs.asp

            +MailFrom config option that defaults the From: field for
             mails sent via the Mail* configs and $Server-&gt;Mail()

            +$Server-&gt;Mail(\%mail, %smtp_args) API extension

            +MailErrorsTo &amp; MailAlertTo now can take comma
             separated email addresses for multiple recipients.

            -tracking of subroutines defined in scripts and includes so
             StatINC won't undefine them when reloading the GlobalPackage,
             and so an warning will be logged when another script redefines
             the same subroutine name, which has been the bane of at least
             a few developers.

            -Loader() will now recompile dynamic includes that
             have changed, even if main including script has not.
             This is useful if you are using Loader() in a
             PerlRestartHandler, for reloading scripts when
             gracefully restarting apache.

            -Apache::ASP used to always set the status to 200 by
             default explicitly with $r-&gt;status().  This would be
             a problem if a script was being used to as a 404
             ErrorDocument, because it would always return a 200 error
             code, which is just wrong.  $Response-&gt;{Status} is now
             undefined by default and will only be used if set by
             the developer.

             Note that by default a script will still return a 200 status,
             but $Response-&gt;{Status} may be used to override this behavior.

            +$Server-&gt;Config($setting) API extension that allows developer
             to access config settings like Global, StateDir, etc., and is a
             wrapper around Apache-&gt;dir_config($setting)

            +Loader() will log the number of scripts
             recompiled and the number of scripts checked, instead
             of just the number of scripts recompiled, which is
             misleading as it reports 0 for child httpds after
             a parent fork that used Loader() upon startup.

            -Apache::ASP-&gt;Loader() would have a bad error if it didn't load
             any scripts when given a directory, prints "loaded 0 scripts" now

       $VERSION = 0.18; $DATE="02/03/2000";
            +Documented SessionQuery* &amp; $Server-&gt;URL() and
             cleaned up formatting some, as well as redoing
             some of the sections ordering for better readability.
             Document the cookieless session functionality more
             in a new SESSIONS section.  Also documented new
             FileUpload configs and $Request-&gt;FileUpload collection.
             Documented StatScripts.

            +StatScripts setting which if set to 0 will not reload
             includes, global.asa, or scripts when changed.

            +FileUpload file handles cleanup at garbage collection
             time so developer does not have to worry about lazy coding
             and undeffing filehandles used in code.  Also set
             uploaded filehandles to binmode automatically on Win32
             platforms, saving the developer yet more typing.

            +FileUploadTemp setting, default 0, if set will leave
             a temp file on disk during the request, which may be
             helpful for processing by other programs, but is also
             a security risk in that others could potentially read
             this file while the script is running.

             The path to the temp file will be available at
             $Request-&gt;{FileUpload}{$form_field}{TempFile}.
             The regular use of file uploads remains the same
             with the &lt;$filehandle&gt; to the upload at
             $Request-&gt;{Form}{$form_field}.

            +FileUploadMax setting, default 0, currently an
             alias for $CGI::POST_MAX, which determines the
             max size for a file upload in bytes.

            +SessionQueryParse only auto parses session-ids
             into links when a session-id COOKIE is NOT found.
             This feature is only enabled then when a user has
             disabled cookies, so the runtime penalty of this
             feature won't drag down the whole site, since most
             users will have cookies turned on.

            -StatINC &amp; StatINCMatch will not undef Fnctl.pm flock
             functions constants like O_RDWR, because the code references
             are not well trackable.  This would result in sporadic 500 server
             errors when a changed module was reloaded that imported O_* flock
             functions from Fnctl.

            +SessionQueryParse &amp; SessionQueryParseMatch
             settings that enable auto parsing session ids into
             URLs for cookieless sessions.  Will pick up URLs in
             &lt;a href&gt;, &lt;area href&gt;, &lt;form action&gt;, &lt;frame src&gt;,
             &lt;iframe src&gt;, &lt;img src&gt;, &lt;input src&gt;, &lt;link href&gt;
             $Response-&gt;Redirect($URL) and the first URL in
             script tags like &lt;script&gt;*.location.href=$URL&lt;/script&gt;

             These settings require that buffering be enabled, as
             Apache::ASP will parse through the buffer to parse the URLs.

             With SessionQueryParse on, it will just parse non-absolute
             URLs, but with SessionQueryParseMatch set to some server
             url regexp, like ^<a href="http://localhost">http://localhost</a> , will also parse
             in the session id for URLs that match that.

             When testing, the performance hit from this parsing
             a script dropped from 12.5 hits/sec on my WinNT box
             to 11.7 hits per second for 1K of buffered output.
             The difference is .007 of my PII300's processing power
             per second.

             For 10K of output then, my guess is that this speed
             of script, would be slowed to 6.8 hits per second.
             This kind of performance hit would also slow a
             script running at 40 hits per second on a UNIX box
             to 31 hits/sec for 1K, and to 11 hits/sec for 10K parsed.

             Your mileage may vary and you will have to test the difference
             yourself.  Get yourself a valid URL with a session-id in
             it, and run it through ab, or Socrates, with SessionQuery
             turned on, and then with SessionQueryParse set to see
             the difference.  SessionQuery just enables of session id
             setting from the query string but will not auto parse urls.

            -If buffering, Content-Length will again be set.
             It broke, probably while I was tuning in the past
             couple versions.

            +UseStrict setting compiles all scripts including
             global.asa with "use strict" turned on for catching
             more coding errors.  With this setting enabled,
             use strict errors die during compilation forcing
             Apache::ASP to try to recompile the script until
             successful.

            -Object use in includes like $Response-&gt;Write()
             no longer error with "use strict" programming.

            +SessionQuery config setting with $Server-&gt;URL($url, { %params } )
             alpha API extensions to enable cookieless sessions.

            +Debugging not longer produces internal debugging
             by default.  Set to -1,-2 for internal debugging
             for Debug settings 1 &amp; 2.

            +Both StateSerializer &amp; StateDB can be changed
             without affecting a live web site, by storing
             the configurations for $Application &amp; $Session
             in an internal database, so that if $Session was
             created with SDBM_File for the StateDB (default),
             it will keep this StateDB setting until it ends.

            +StateSerializer config setting.  Default Data::Dumper,
             can also be set to Storable.  Controls how data is
             serialized before writing to $Application &amp; $Session.

            +Beefed up the make test suite.

            +Improved the locking, streamlining a bit of the
             $Application / $Session setup process.  Bench is up to
             22 from 21 hits / sec on dev NT box.

            +Cut more fat for faster startup, now on my dev box
             I get 44 hits per sec Apache::ASP vs. 48 Embperl
             vs. 52 CGI via Apache::Registry for the HelloWorld Scripts.

            -Improved linking for the online site documentation,
             where a few links before were bad.

       $VERSION = 0.17; $DATE="11/15/99";
            ++20%+ faster startup script execution, as measured by the
             HelloWorld bench.  I cut a lot of the fat out of
             the code, and is now at least 20% faster on startup
             both with and without state.

             On my dev (NT, apache 1.3.6+mod_perl) machine, I now get:

                   42 hits per sec on Apache::ASP HelloWorld bench
                   46 hits per sec on Embperl (1.2b10) and
                   51 hits per sec for CGI Apache::Registry scripts

             Before Apache::ASP was clocking some 31 hits per sec.
             Apache::ASP also went from 75 to 102 hits per second
             on Solaris.

            +PerlTaintCheck On friendly.  This is mod_perl's way
             of providing -T taint checking.  When Apache::ASP
             is used with state objects like $Session or $Application,
             MLDBM must also be made taint friendly with:

               $MLDBM::RemoveTaint = 1;

             which could be put in the global.asa.  Documented.

            +Added $Response-&gt;ErrorDocument($error_code, $uri_or_string)
             API extension which allows for setting of Apache's error
             document at runtime.  This is really just a wrapper
             for Apache-&gt;custom_response() renamed so it syncs with
             the Apache ErrorDocument config setting.  Updated
             documentation, and added error_document.htm example.

            =OrderCollections setting was added, but then REMOVED
             because it was not going to be used.  It bound
             $Request-&gt;* collections/hashes to Tie::IxHash, so that data
             in those collections would be read in the order the
             browser sent it, when eaching through or with keys.

            -global.asa will be reloaded when changed.  This broke
             when I optimized the modification times with (stat($file))[9]
             rather than "use File::stat; stat($file)-&gt;mtime"

            -Make Apache::ASP-&gt;Loader() PerlRestartHandler safe,
             had some unstrict code that was doing the wrong thing.

            -IncludesDir config now works with DynamicIncludes.

            +DebugBufferLength feature added, giving control to
             how much buffered output gets shown when debugging errors.

            ++Tuning of $Response-&gt;Write(), which processes all
             static html internally, to be almost 50% faster for
             its typical use, when BufferingOn is enabled, and
             CgiHeaders are disabled, both being defaults.

             This can show significant speed improvements for tight
             loops that render ASP output.

            +Auto linking of ./site/eg/ text to example scripts
             at web site.

            +$Application-&gt;GetSession($session_id) API extension, useful
             for managing active user sessions when storing session ids
             in $Application.  Documented.

            -disable use of flock() on Win95/98 where it is unimplemented

            -@array context of $Request-&gt;Form('name') returns
             undef when value for 'name' is undefined.  Put extra
             logic in there to make sure this happens.

       $VERSION = 0.16; $DATE="09/22/99";
            -$Response-&gt;{Buffer} and PerlSetVar BufferingOn
             configs now work when set to 0, to unbuffer output,
             and send it out to the web client as the script generates it.

             Buffering is enabled by default, as it is faster, and
             allows a script to error cleanly in the middle of execution.

            +more bullet proof loading of Apache::Symbol, changed the
             way Apache::ASP loads modules in general.  It used to
             check for the module to load every time, if it hadn't loaded
             successfully before, but now it just tries once per httpd,
             so the web server will have to be restarted to see new installed
             modules.  This is just for modules that Apache::ASP relies on.

             Old modules that are changed or updated with an installation
             are still reloaded with the StatINC settings if so configured.

            +ASP web site wraps &lt;font face="courier new"&gt; around &lt;pre&gt;
             tags now to override the other font used for the text
             areas.  The spacing was all weird in Netscape before
             for &lt;pre&gt; sections.

            -Fixed Content-Length calculation when using the Clean
             option, so that the length is calculated after the HTML
             is clean, not before.  This would cause a browser to
             hang sometimes.

            +Added IncludesDir config option that if set will also be
             used to check for includes, so that includes may easily be
             shared between applications.  By default only Global and
             the directory the script is in are checked for includes.

             Also added IncludesDir as a possible configuration option
             for Apache::ASP-&gt;Loader()

            -Re-enabled the Application_OnStart &amp; OnEnd events, after
             breaking them when implementing the AllowApplicationState
             config setting.

            +Better pre-fork caching ... StatINC &amp; StatINCMatch are now
             args for Apache::ASP-&gt;Loader(), so StatINC symbols loading
             may be done pre-fork and shared between httpds.  This lowers
             the child httpd init cost of StatINC.  Documented.

            +Made Apache::ASP Basic Authorization friendly so authentication
             can be handled by ASP scripts.  If AuthName and AuthType Apache
             config directives are set, and a $Response-&gt;{Status} is set to
             401, a user will be prompted for username/password authentication
             and the entered data will show up in ServerVariables as:
               $env = $Request-&gt;ServerVariables
               $env-&gt;{REMOTE_USER} = $env-&gt;{AUTH_USER} = username
               $env-&gt;{AUTH_PASSWD} = password
               $env-&gt;{AUTH_NAME}   = your realm
               $env-&gt;{AUTH_TYPE}   = 'Basic'

             This is the same place to find auth data as if Apache had some
             authentication handler deal with the auth phase separately.

            -MailErrorsTo should report the right file now that generates
             the error.

       $VERSION = 0.15; $DATE="08/24/1999";
            --State databases like $Session, $Application are
             now tied/untied to every lock/unlock triggered by read/write
             access.  This was necessary for correctness issues, so that
             database file handles are flushed appropriately between writes
             in a highly concurrent multi-process environment.

             This problem raised its ugly head because under high volume,
             a DB_File can become corrupt if not flushed correctly.
             Unfortunately, there is no way to flush SDBM_Files &amp; DB_Files
             consistently other than to tie/untie the databases every access.

             DB_File may be used optionally for StateDB, but the default is
             to use SDBM_File which is much faster, but limited to 1024 byte
             key/value pairs.

             For SDBM_Files before, if there were too many concurrent
             writes to a shared database like $Application, some of the
             writes would not be saved because another process
             might overwrite the changes with its own.

             There is now a 10 fold performance DECREASE associated
             with reading from and writing to files like $Session
             and $Application.  With rough benchmarks I can get about
             100 increments (++) now per second to $Session-&gt;{count}, where
             before I could get 1000 increments / second.

             You can improve this if you have many reads / writes happening
             at the same time, by placing locking code around the group like

                   $Session-&gt;Lock();
                   $Session-&gt;{count}++;
                   $Session-&gt;{count}++;
                   $Session-&gt;{count}++;
                   $Session-&gt;UnLock();

             This method will reduce the number of ties to the $Session database
             from 6 to 1 for this kind of code, and will improve the performance
             dramatically.

             Also, instead of using explicit $Session locking, you can
             create an automatic lock on $Session per script by setting
             SessionSerialize in your config to 1.  The danger here is
             if you have any long running scripts, the user will have
             to wait for it to finish before another script can be run.

             To see the number of lock/unlocks or ties/unties to each database
             during a script execution, look at the last lines of debug output
             to your error log when Debug is set to 1.  This can help you
             performance tweak access to these databases.

            +Updated documentation with new config settings and
             API extensions.

            +Added AllowApplicationState config option which allows
             you to leave $Application undefined, and will not
             execute Application_OnStart or Application_OnEnd.
             This can be a slight performance increase of 2-3% if
             you are not using $Application, but are using $Session.

            +Added $Session-&gt;Lock() / $Session-&gt;UnLock() API routines
             necessary additions since access to session is not
             serialized by default like IIS ASP.  Also prompted
             by change in locking code which retied to SDBM_File
             or DB_File each lock.  If you $Session-&gt;Lock / UnLock
             around many read/writes, you will increase performance.

            +Added StateCache config which, if set will cache
             the file handle locks for $Application and an internal
             database used for tracking $Session info.  This caching can
             make an ASP application perform up to 10% faster,
             at a cost of each web server process holding 2 more
             cached file handles open, per ASP application using
             this configuration.  The data written to or read from
             these state databases is not cached, just the locking
             file handles are held open.

            -Added in much more locking in session manager
             and session garbage collector to help avoid collisions
             between the two.  There were definite windows that the
             two would collide in, during which bad things could
             happen on a high volume site.

            -Fixed some warnings in DESTROY and ParseParams()

       $VERSION = 0.14; $DATE="07/29/1999";
            -CGI &amp; StatINC or StatINCMatch would have bad results
             at times, with StatINC deleting dynamically compiled
             CGI subroutines, that were imported into other scripts
             and modules namespaces.

             A couple tweaks, and now StatINC &amp; CGI play nice again ;)
             StatINCMatch should be safe to use in production with CGI.
             This affects in particular environments that use file upload,
             since CGI is loaded automatically by Apache::ASP to handle
             file uploads.

             This fix should also affect other seemingly random
             times when StatINC or StatINCMatch don't seem to do
             the right thing.

            +use of ASP objects like $Response are now "use strict"
             safe in scripts, while UniquePackages config is set.

            +Better handling of "use strict" errors in ASP scripts.
             The error is detected, and the developer is pointed to the
             Apache error log for the exact error.

             The script with "use strict" errors will be recompiled again.  Its seems
             though that "use strict" will only throw its error once, so that a script
             can be recompiled with the same errors, and work w/o any use strict
             error messaging.

       $VERSION = 0.12; $DATE="07/01/1999";
            -Compiles are now 10 +times faster for scripts with lots of big
             embedded perl blocks &lt;% #perl %&gt;

             Compiles were slow because of an old PerlScript compatibility
             parsing trick where $Request-&gt;QueryString('hi')-&gt;{item}
             would be parsed to $Request-&gt;QueryString('hi') which works.
             I think the regexp that I was using had O(n^2) characteristics
             and it took a really big perl block to 10 +seconds to parse
             to understand there was a problem :(

             I doubt anyone needed this compatibility, I don't even see
             any code that looks like this in the online PerlScript examples,
             so I've commented out this parsing trick for now.  If you
             need me to bring back this functionality, it will be in the
             form of a config setting.

             For information on PerlScript compatibility, see the PerlScript
             section in the ASP docs.

            -Added UniquePackages config option, that if set brings back
             the old method of compiling each ASP script into its own
             separate package.  As of v.10, scripts are compiled by default
             into the same package, so that scripts, dynamic includes &amp; global.asa
             can share globals.  This BROKE scripts in the same ASP Application
             that defined the same sub routines, as their subs would redefine
             each other.

             UniquePackages has scripts compiled into separate perl packages,
             so they may define subs with the same name, w/o fear of overlap.
             Under this settings, scripts will not be able to share globals.

            -Secure field for cookies in $Response-&gt;Cookies() must be TRUE to
             force cookie to be secure.  Before, it just had to be defined,
             which gave wrong behavior for Secure =&gt; 0.

            +$Response-&gt;{IsClientConnected} set to one by default.  Will
             work out a real value when I upgrade to apache 1.3.6.  This
             value has no meaning before, as apache aborts the perl code
             when a client drops its connection in earlier versions.

            +better compile time debugging of dynamic includes, with
             Debug 2 setting

            +"use strict" friendly handling of compiling dynamic includes
             with errors

       $VERSION = 0.11; $DATE="06/24/1999";
            +Lots of documentation updates

            +The MailHost config option is the smtp server used for
             relay emails for the Mail* config options.

            +MailAlertTo config option used for sending a short administrative
             alert for an internal ASP error, server code 500.  This is the
             compliment to MailErrorsTo, but is suited for sending a to a
             small text based pager.  The email sent by MailErrorsTo would
             then be checked by the web admin for quick response &amp; debugging
             for the incident.

             The MailAlertPeriod config specifies the time in minutes during
             which only one alert will be sent, which defaults to 20.

            +MailErrorsTo config options sends the results of a 500 error
             to the email address specified as if Debug were set to 2.
             If Debug 2 is set, this config will not be on, as it is
             for production use only.  Debug settings less than 2 only
             log errors to the apache server error log.

            -StatINCMatch / StatINC can be used in production and work
             even after a server graceful restart, which is essential for
             a production server.

            -Content-Length header is set again, if BufferingOn is set, and
             haven't $Response-&gt;Flush()'d.  This broke when I introduce
             the Script_OnEnd event handler.

            +Optimized reloading of the GlobalPackage perl module upon changes,
             so that scripts and dynamic includes don't have to be recompiled.
             The global.asa will still have to be though.  Since we started
             compiling all routines into a package that can be named with
             GlobalPackage, we've been undeffing compiled scripts and includes
             when the real GlobalPackage changed on disk, as we do a full sweep
             through the namespace.  Now, we skip those subs that we know to
             be includes or scripts.

            -Using Apache::Symbol::undef() to undefine precompiled scripts
             and includes when reloading those scripts.  Doing just an undef()
             would sometimes result in an "active subroutine undef" error.
             This bug came out when I started thrashing the StatINC system
             for production use.

            +StatINCMatch setting created for production use reloading of
             perl modules.  StatINCMatch allows StatINC reloading of a
             subset of all the modules defined in %INC, those that match
             $module =~ /$StatINCMatch/, where module is some module name
             like Class/Struct.pm

            +Reoptimized pod comment parsing.  I slowed it down to sync
             lines numbers in the last version, but found another corner I could cut.

       $VERSION = 0.10; $DATE="05/24/1999";
            += improvement; - = bug fix

            +Added index.html file to ./eg to help people wade through
             the examples.  This one has been long overdue.

            +Clean config option, or setting $Response-&gt;{Clean} to 1 - 9,
             uses HTML::Clean to compress text/html output of ASP scripts.
             I like the Clean 1 setting which is lightweight, stripping
             white space for about 10% compression, at a cost of less than
             a 5% performance penalty.

            +Using pod style commenting no longer confuses the line
             numbering.  ASP script line numbers are almost exactly match
             their compiled perl version, except that normal inline includes
             (not dynamic) insert extra text which can confuse line numbering.
             If you want perl error line numbers to entirely sync with your
             ASP scripts, I would suggest learning how to use dynamic includes,
             as opposed to inline includes.

            -Wrapped StatINC reloading of libs in an eval, and capturing
             error for Debug 2 setting.  This makes changing libs with StatINC
             on a little more friendly when there are errors.

            -$Request-&gt;QueryString() now stores multiple values for the
             same key, just as $Request-&gt;Form() has since v.07.  In
             wantarray() context like @vals = $Request-&gt;QueryString('dupkey'),
             @vals will store whatever values where associated with dupkey
             in the query string like (1,2) from: ?dupkey=1&amp;dupkey=2

            +The GlobalPackage config directive may be defined
             to explicitly set the perl module that all scripts and global.asa
             are compiled into.

            -Dynamic includes may be in the Global directory, just like
             normal includes.

            +Perl script generated from asp scripts should match line
             for line, seen in errors, except when using inline (default)
             includes, pod comments, or &lt;% #comment %&gt; perl comments, which
             will throw off the line counts by adding text, removing
             text, or having an extra newline added, respectively.

            -Script_OnEnd may now send output to the browser.  Before
             $main::Response-&gt;End() was being called at the end of the
             main script preventing further output.

           ++All scripts are compiled as routines in a namespace uniquely
             defined by the global.asa of the ASP application.  Thus,
             scripts, includes, and global.asa routines will share
             all globals defined in the global.asa namespace.   This means
             that globals between scripts will be shared, and globals
             defined in a global.asa will be available to scripts.

             Scripts used to have their own namespace, thus globals
             were not shared between them.

            +a -o $output_dir switch on the ./cgi/asp script allows
             it to execute scripts and write their output to an output
             directory.  Useful for building static html sites, based on
             asp scripts.  An example use would be:

               asp -b -o out *.asp

             Without an output directory, script output is written to STDOUT

       $VERSION = 0.09; $DATE="04/22/1999";
            +Updated Makefile.PL optional modules output for CGI &amp; DB_File

            +Improved docs on $Response-&gt;Cookies() and $Request-&gt;Cookies()

            +Added PERFORMANCE doc to main README, and added sub section
             on precompiling scripts with Apache::ASP-&gt;Loader()

            +Naming of CompileIncludes switched over to DynamicIncludes
             for greater clarity.

            +Dynamic includes can now reference ASP objects like $Session
             w/o the $main::* syntax.  These subs are no longer anonymous
             subs, and are now compiled into the namespace of the global.asa package.

            +Apache::ASP-&gt;Loader() precompiles dynamic includes too. Making this work
             required fixing some subtle bugs / dependencies in the compiling process.

            +Added Apache::ASP-&gt;Loader() similar to Apache::RegistryLoader for
             precompiling ASP scripts.  Precompile a whole site at server
             startup with one function call.

            +Prettied the error messaging with Debug 2.

            +$Response-&gt;Debug(@args) debugging extension, which
             allows a developer to hook into the module's debugging,
             and only have @args be written to error_log when Debug is greater
             than 0.

            -Put write locking code around State writes, like $Session
             and $Application.  I thought I fixed this bug a while ago.

            -API change: converted $Session-&gt;Timeout() and $Session-&gt;SessionID()
             methods into $Session-&gt;{Timeout} and $Session-&gt;{SessionID} properties.
             The use of these properties as methods is deprecated, but
             backwards compatibility will remain.  Updated ./eg/session.asp
             to use these new properties.

            +Implemented $Response-&gt;{PICS} which if set sends out a PICS-Label
             HTTP header, useful for ratings.

            +Implemented $Response-&gt;{CacheControl} and $Response-&gt;{Charset} members.
             By default, CacheControl is 'private', and this value gets sent out
             every request as HTTP header Cache-Control.  Charset appends itself
             onto the content type header.

            +Implemented $Request-&gt;BinaryRead(), $Request-&gt;{TotalBytes},
             documented them, and updated ./eg/form.asp for an example usage.

            +Implemented $Response-&gt;BinaryWrite(), documented, and created
             and example in ./eg/binary_write.htm

            +Implemented $Server-&gt;MapPath() and created example of its use
             in ./eg/server.htm

            -$Request-&gt;Form() now reads file uploads correctly with
             the latest CGI.pm, where $Request-&gt;Form('file_field') returns
             the actual file name uploaded, which can be used as a file handle
             to read in the data.  Before, $Request-&gt;Form('file_field') would
             return a glob that looks like *Fh::filename, so to get the file
             name, you would have to parse it like =~ s/^\*Fh\:\://,
             which you no longer have to do.  As long as parsing was done as
             mentioned, the change should be backwards compatible.

            +Updated  +enhanced documentation on file uploads.  Created extra
             comments about it as an FAQ, and under $Response-&gt;Form(), the latter
             being an obvious place for a developer to look for it.

            +Updated ./eg/file_upload.asp to show use of non file form data,
             with which we had a bug before.

            +Finished retieing *STDIN to cached STDIN contents, so that
             CGI input routines may be used transparently, along side with
             use of $Request-&gt;Form()

            +Cleaned up and optimized $Request code

            +Updated documentation for CGI input &amp; file uploads.  Created
             file upload FAQ.

            +Reworked ./eg/cgi.htm example to use CGI input routines
             after doing a native read of STDIN.

            ++Added dynamic includes with &lt;!--include file=file args=@args--&gt;
             extension.  This style of include is compiled as an anonymous sub &amp;
             cached, and then executed with @args passed to the subroutine for
             execution.  This is include may also be rewritten as a new API
             extension: $Response-&gt;Include('file', @args)

            +Added ./eg/compiled_includes.htm example documenting new dynamic includes.

            +Documented SSI: native file includes, and the rest with filtering
             to Apache::SSI

            +Turned the documentation of Filter config to value of Off so
             people won't cut and paste the On config by default.

            +Added SecureSession config option, which forces session cookie to
             be sent only under https secured www page requests.

            +Added StateDB config option allows use of DB_File for $Session, since
             default use of SDBM_File is limited.  See StateDB in README.

            +file include syntax w/o quotes supported like &lt;!--#include file=test.inc--&gt;

            +Nested includes are supported, with includes including each other.
             Recursive includes are detected and errors out when an include has been
             included 100 times for a script.  Better to quit early than
             have a process spin out of control. (PORTABLE ? probably not)

            +Allow &lt;!--include file=file.inc--&gt; notation w/o quotes around file names

            -PerlSetEnv apache conf setting now get passed through to
             $Request-&gt;ServerVariables. This update has ServerVariables
             getting data from %ENV instead of $r-&gt;cgi_env

             Currently filtering only works in the direction Apache::ASP -&gt; Apache::SSI,
             will not work the other way around, as SSI must come last in a set of filters

            +SSI file includes may reference files in the Global directory, better
             code sharing

            - &lt;% @array... %&gt; no longer dropped from code.

            +perl =pod comments are stripped from script before compiling, and associated
             PodComments configuration options.

            +Command line cgi/asp script takes various options, and allows execution
             of multiple asp scripts at one time.  This script should be used for
             command line debugging.  This is also the beginning of building
             a static site from asp scripts with the -b option, suppressing headers.

            +$Response-&gt;AddHeader('Set-Cookie') works for multiple cookies.

            -$Response-&gt;Cookies('foo', '0') works, was dropping 0 because of boolean test

            -Fixed up some config doc errors.

       $VERSION = 0.07; $DATE="01/20/1999";
            -removed SIG{__WARN__} handler, it was a bad idea.

            -fixes file locking on QNX, work around poor flock porting

            +removed message about Win32::OLE on UNIX platforms from Makefile.PL

            -Better lock garbage collection.  Works with StatINC seamlessly.

            -Multiple select forms now work in array context with $Response-&gt;Form()
                   @values = $Response-&gt;Form('multi');

            -Better CGI.pm compatibility with $r-&gt;header_out('Content-type'),
             improved garbage collection under modperl, esp. w/ file uploads

       $VERSION = 0.06; $DATE="12/21/1998";
            +Application_OnStart &amp; Application_OnEnd event handlers support.

            -Compatible with CGI.pm 2.46 headers()

            -Compatible with CGI.pm $q = new CGI({}), caveat: does not set params

            +use strict; followed by use of objects like $Session is fine.

            -Multiple cookies may be set per script execution.

            +file upload implemented via CGI.pm

            ++global.asa implemented with events Session_OnStart and Session_OnEnd
             working appropriately.

            +StateDir configuration directive implemented.
             StateDir allows the session state directory to be specified separately
             from the Global directory, useful for operating systems with caching file
             systems.

            +StateManager config directive.  StateManager specifies how frequently
             Sessions are cleaned up, with 10 (default) meaning that old Sessions
             will be cleaned up 10 times per SessionTimeout period (default 20 minutes).

            +$Application-&gt;SessionCount() implemented, non-portable method.
                   : returns the number of currently active sessions

            -STOP button fix.  Users may hit STOP button during script
             execution, and Apache::ASP will cleanup with a routine registered
             in Apache's $r-&gt;register_cleanup.  Works well supposedly.

            +PerlScript compatibility work, trying to make ports smoother.
                   : Collection emulator, no -&gt;{Count} property
                   : $.*(.*)-&gt;{Item} parsed automatically,
                     shedding the -&gt;{Item} for Collection support (? better way ?)
                   : No VBScript dates support, just HTTP RFC dates with HTTP::Date
                   : Win32::OLE::in not supported, just use "keys %{$Collection}"

            +./cgi/asp script for testing scripts from the command line
                   : will be upgraded to CGI method of doing asp
                   : is not "correct" in anyway, so not documented for now
                     but still useful

            +strips DOS carriage returns from scripts automatically, so that
             programs like FrontPage can upload pages to UNIX servers
             without perl choking on the extra \r characters.

       $VERSION = 0.05; $DATE="10/19/1998";
            +Added PERFORMANCE doc, which includes benchmarks  +hints.

            +Better installation warnings and errors for other modules required.

            -Turned off StatINC in eg/.htaccess, as not everyone installs Devel::Symdump

            -Fixed AUTOLOAD state bug, which wouldn't let you each through state
             objects, like %{$Session}, or each %$Session, (bug introduced in v.04)

            +Parses ASP white space better.  HTML output matches author's intent
             by better dealing with white space surrounding &lt;% perl blocks %&gt;

            -Scalar insertion code &lt;%=$foo%&gt; can now span many lines.

            +Added include.t test script for includes.

            +Script recompiles when included files change.

            +Files can be included in script with
             SSI &lt;!--#include file="filename"--&gt; syntax, needs to be
             done in ASP module to allow compilation of included code and html
             into script.  Future chaining with Apache::SSI will allow static
             html includes, and other SSI directives

       $VERSION = 0.04; $DATE="10/14/1998";
            +Example script eg/cgi.htm demonstrating CGI.pm use for output.

            +Optimized ASP parsing, faster and more legible executing code
                   : try 'die();' in code with setting PerlSetVar Debug 2

            +Cleaned up code for running with 'use strict'

            -Fixed directory handle leak on Solaris, from not closing after opendir()

            +StatINC overhaul.  StatINC setting now works as it should, with
             the caveat that exported functions will not be refreshed.

            +NoState setting optimization, disallows $Application &amp; $Session

            +$Application-&gt;*Lock() functions implemented

            -SoftRedirect setting for those who want scripts to keep running
             after a Redirect()

            +SessionSerialize setting to lock session while script is running
                   : Microsoft ASP style session locking
                   : For a session, scripts execute one at a time
                   : NOT recommended use, please see note.

            -MLDBM can be used for other things without messing up internal use
                   : before if it was used with different DB's and serializers,
                     internal state could be lost.

            --State file locking.  Corruption worries, and loss of data no more.

            +CGI header support, developer can use CGI.pm for *output*, or just print()
                   : print "Set-Cookie: test=cookie\n", and things will just work
                   : use CGI.pm for output
                   : utilizes $r-&gt;send_cgi_header(), thanks Doug!

            +Improved Cookie implementation, more flexible and complete
                   - Domain cookie key now works
                   : Expire times now taken from time(), and relative time in sec
                   : Request-&gt;Cookies() reading more flexible, with wantarray()
                     on hash cookie values, %hash = $Request-&gt;Cookie('test');

            -make test module naming correction, was t.pm, now T.pm for Unix

            +POD / README cleanup, formatting and HTML friendly.

       $VERSION = 0.03; $DATE="09/14/1998";
            +Installation 'make test' now works

            +ActiveX objects on Win32 implemented with $Server-&gt;CreateObject()

            +Cookies implemented: $Response-&gt;Cookies() &amp; $Request-&gt;Cookies()

            -Fixed $Response object API, converting some methods to object members.
             Deprecated methods, but backwards compatible.

            +Improved error messaging, debug output

            +$, influences $Response-&gt;Write(@strings) behavior

            +perl print() works, sending output to $Response object

            +$Response-&gt;Write() prints scalars, arrays, and hashes.  Before only scalars.

            +Begin implementation of $Server object.

            +Implemented $Response-&gt;{Expires} and $Response-&gt;{ExpiresAbsolute}

            +Added "PerlSetVar StatINC" config option

            +$0 is aliased to current script filename

            +ASP Objects ($Response, etc.) are set in main package
             Thus notation like $main::Response-&gt;Write() can be used anywhere.

       $VERSION = 0.02; $DATE="07/12/1998";
            ++Session Manager, won't break under denial of service attack

            +Fleshed out $Response, $Session objects, almost full implementation.

            +Enormously more documentation.

            -Fixed error handling with Debug = 2.

            -Documentation fixed for pod2man support.  README now more man-like.

            -Stripped \r\n dos characters from installation files

            -755 mode set for session state directory when created

            -Loads Win32/OLE properly, won't break with UNIX

       $VERSION = 0.01; $DATE="06/26/1998";
            Syntax Support
            --------------
            Initial release, could be considered alpha software.
            Allows developers to embed perl in html ASP style.

            &lt;!-- sample here --&gt;
            &lt;html&gt;
            &lt;body&gt;
            &lt;% for(1..10) { %&gt;
                   counting: &lt;%=$_%&gt; &lt;br&gt;
            &lt;% } %&gt;
            &lt;/body&gt;
            &lt;/html&gt;

            ASP Objects
            -----------
            $Session, $Application, $Response, $Request objects available
            for use in asp pages.

            $Session &amp; $Application data is preserved using SDBM files.

            $Session id's are tracked through the use of cookies.

            Security
            --------
            Timeouts any attempt to use a session id that doesn't already
            exist.  Should stop hackers, since there is no wire speed guessing
            cookies.
