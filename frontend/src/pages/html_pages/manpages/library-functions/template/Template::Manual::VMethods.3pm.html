</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Template::Manual::VMethods - Virtual Methods

</pre><h4><b>Scalar</b> <b>Virtual</b> <b>Methods</b></h4><pre>
   <b>chunk(size)</b>
       Splits the value into a list of chunks of a certain size.

           [% ccard_no = "1234567824683579";
              <a href="../man4/ccard_no.chunk.4.html">ccard_no.chunk</a>(4).join
           %]

       Output:

           1234 5678 2468 3579

       If the size is specified as a negative number then the text will be chunked from right-to-left.  This
       gives the correct grouping for numbers, for example.

           [% number = 1234567;
              number.chunk(-3).join(',')
           %]

       Output:

           1,234,567

   <b>collapse</b>
       Returns the text with any leading and trailing whitespace removed and any internal sequences of
       whitespace converted to a single space

           [% text = "  The bird\n  is the word" %]
           [% text.collapse %]       # The bird is the word

   <b>defined</b>
       Returns true if the value is defined.

           [% user = get_user(uid) IF uid.defined %]

   <b>dquote</b>
       Returns the text with any double quote characters escaped with a backslash prefix.  Any newline
       characters in the text will be replaced with "\n".

           [% quote = 'He said "Oh really?"' %]
           [% quote.dquote %]        # He said \"Oh really?\"

   <b>hash</b>
       Return the value as a hash reference containing a single entry with the key "value" indicating the
       original scalar value.  As with the "list" virtual method, this is generally used to help massage data
       into different formats.

   <b>lcfirst</b>
       Returns the text with the first letter converted to lower case.

           [% word = 'BIRD' %]
           [% word.lcfirst %]        # bIRD

   <b>length</b>
       Returns the length of the string representation of the item:

           [% IF password.length &lt; 8 %]
              Password too short, dumbass!
           [% END %]

   <b>empty</b>
       Returns true if the string is empty:

           [% IF details.empty %]
              No details specified
           [% END %]

   <b>list</b>
       Return the value as a single element list.  This can be useful if you have a variable which may contain a
       single item or a list and you want to treat them equally.  The "list" method can be called against a list
       reference and will simply return the original reference, effectively a no-op.

           [% thing.list.size %]     # thing can be a scalar or a list

   <b>lower</b>
       Returns the text in lower case.

           [% word = 'BIRD' %]
           [% word.lower %]          # bird

   <b>match(pattern,</b> <b>global)</b>
       Performs a regular expression match on the string using the pattern passed as an argument.  If the
       pattern matches the string then the method returns a reference to a list of any strings captured within
       parenthesis in the pattern.

           [% name = 'Larry Wall' %]
           [% matches = name.match('(\w+) (\w+)') %]
           [% matches.1 %], [% matches.0 %]    # Wall, Larry

       If the pattern does not match then the method returns false, rather than returning an empty list which
       Perl and the Template Toolkit both consider to be a true value.  This allows you to write expression like
       this.

           [% "We're not worthy!" IF name.match('Larry Wall') %]

           [% IF (matches = name.match('(\w+) (\w+)')) %]
              pattern matches: [% matches.join(', ') %]
           [% ELSE %]
              pattern does not match
           [% END %]

       Any regex modifiers, like "/s", should be added in the regex using the "(?s)" syntax.  For example, to
       modify the regex to disregard whitespace (the "/x" switch), use:

           [% re = '(?x)
                      (\w+)
                      [ ]
                      (\w+)
                    ';
             matches = name.match(re);
           %]

       To perform a global search to match the pattern as many times as it appears in the source string, provide
       a true value for the "global" argument following the pattern.

           [% text = 'bandanna';
              text.match('an+', 1).join(', )      # an, ann
           %]

   <b>repeat(n)</b>
       Repeat the string a specified number of times.

           [% name = 'foo' %]
           [% <a href="../man3/name.repeat.3.html">name.repeat</a>(3) %]                # foofoofoo

   <b>replace(search,</b> <b>replace)</b>
       Outputs the string with all instances of the first argument (specified as a Perl regular expression) with
       the second.

           [% name = 'foo, bar &amp; baz' %]
           [% name.replace('\W+', '_') %]        # foo_bar_baz

       You can use $1, $2, etc., to reference captured parts (in parentheses) in the regular expression.  Just
       be careful to <u>single</u> quote the replacement string.  If you use <u>double</u> quotes then TT will try and
       interpolate the variables before passing the string to the "replace" vmethod.

           [% name = 'FooBarBaz' %]
           [% name.replace('([A-Z])', ' $1') %]  # Foo Bar Baz

   <b>remove(pattern)</b>
       Outputs the string with all instances of the pattern (specified as a Perl regular expression) removed.

           [% name = 'foo, bar &amp; baz' %]
           [% name.remove('\W+') %]    # foobarbaz

   <b>search(pattern)</b>
       Performs a similar function to match but simply returns true if the string matches the regular expression
       pattern passed as an argument.

           [% name = 'foo bar baz' %]
           [% name.search('bar') ? 'bar' : 'no bar' %]     # bar

       This virtual method is now deprecated in favour of match.  Move along now, there's nothing more to see
       here.

   <b>size</b>
       Always returns 1 for scalar values.  This method is provided for consistency with the hash and list size
       methods.

   <b>split(pattern)</b>
       Calls Perl's split() function to split a string into a list of strings.

           [% FOREACH dir IN mypath.split(':') %]
              [% dir %]
           [% END %]

   <b>substr(offset,</b> <b>length,</b> <b>replacement)</b>
       Returns a substring starting at "offset", for "length" characters.

           [% str 'foo bar baz wiz waz woz') %]
           [% str.substr(4, 3) %]    # bar

       If "length" is not specified then it returns everything from the "offset" to the end of the string.

           [% <a href="../man12/str.substr.12.html">str.substr</a>(12) %]      # wiz waz woz

       If both "length" and "replacement" are specified, then the method replaces everything from "offset" for
       "length" characters with $replacement.  The substring removed from the string is then returned.

           [% str.substr(0, 11, 'FOO') %]   # foo bar baz
           [% str %]                        # FOO wiz waz woz

   <b>squote</b>
       Returns the text with any single quote characters escaped with a backslash prefix.

           [% tim = "Tim O'Reilly" %]
           [% tim.squote %]          # Tim O\'Reilly

   <b>trim</b>
       Returns the text with any leading and trailing whitespace removed.

           [% text = '  hello  world  ' %]
           [% text.trim %]           # hello  world

   <b>ucfirst</b>
       Returns the text with the first letter converted to upper case.

           [% word = 'bird' %]
           [% word.ucfirst %]        # Bird

   <b>upper</b>
       Returns the text in upper case.

           [% word = 'bird' %]
           [% word.upper %]          # BIRD

</pre><h4><b>Hash</b> <b>Virtual</b> <b>Methods</b></h4><pre>
   <b>keys</b>
       Returns a list of keys in the hash.  They are not returned in any particular order, but the order is the
       same as for the corresponding values method.

           [% FOREACH key IN hash.keys %]
              * [% key %]
           [% END %]

       If you want the keys in sorted order, use the list "sort" method.

           [% FOREACH key IN hash.keys.sort %]
              * [% key %]
           [% END %]

       Having got the keys in sorted order, you can then use variable interpolation to fetch the value.  This is
       shown in the following example by the use of $key to fetch the item from "hash" whose key is stored in
       the "key" variable.

           [% FOREACH key IN hash.keys.sort %]
              * [% key %] = [% hash.$key %]
           [% END %]

       Alternately, you can use the "pairs" method to get a list of key/value pairs in sorted order.

   <b>values</b>
       Returns a list of the values in the hash.  As with the "keys" method, they are not returned in any
       particular order, although it is the same order that the keys are returned in.

           [% hash.values.join(', ') %]

   <b>items</b>
       Returns a list of both the keys and the values expanded into a single list.

           [% hash = {
                 a = 10
                 b = 20
              };

              hash.items.join(', ')    # a, 10, b, 20
           %]

   <b>each</b>
       This method currently returns the same thing as the "items" method.

       However, please note that this method will change in the next major version of the Template Toolkit (v3)
       to return the same thing as the "pairs" method.  This will be done in an effort to make these virtual
       method more consistent with each other and how Perl works.

       In anticipation of this, we recommend that you stop using "hash.each" and instead use "hash.items".

   <b>pairs</b>
       This method returns a list of key/value pairs.  They are returned in sorted order according to the keys.

           [% FOREACH pair IN product.pairs %]
              * [% pair.key %] is [% pair.value %]
           [% END %]

   <b>list</b>
       Returns the contents of the hash in list form.  An argument can be passed to indicate the desired items
       required in the list: "keys" to return a list of the keys (same as "hash.keys"), "values" to return a
       list of the values (same as "hash.values"), "each" to return as list of key and values (same as
       "hash.each"), or "pairs" to return a list of key/value pairs (same as "hash.pairs").

           [% keys   = hash.list('keys') %]
           [% values = hash.list('values') %]
           [% items  = hash.list('each') %]
           [% pairs  = hash.list('pairs') %]

       When called without an argument it currently returns the same thing as the "pairs" method.  However,
       please note that this method will change in the next major version of the Template Toolkit (v3) to return
       a reference to a list containing the single hash reference (as per the scalar list method).

       In anticipation of this, we recommend that you stop using "hash.list" and instead use "hash.pairs".

   <b>sort,</b> <b>nsort</b>
       Return a list of the keys, sorted alphabetically ("sort") or numerically ("nsort") according to the
       corresponding values in the hash.

           [% FOREACH n IN phones.sort %]
              [% phones.$n %] is [% n %],
           [% END %]

   <b>import</b>
       The "import" method can be called on a hash array to import the contents of another hash array.

           [% hash1 = {
                foo = 'Foo'
                bar = 'Bar'
              }
              hash2 = {
                  wiz = 'Wiz'
                  woz = 'Woz'
              }
           %]

           [% hash1.import(hash2) %]
           [% hash1.wiz %]             # Wiz

       You can also call the import() method by itself to import a hash array into the current namespace hash.

           [% user = { id =&gt; 'lwall', name =&gt; 'Larry Wall' } %]
           [% import(user) %]
           [% id %]: [% name %]        # lwall: Larry Wall

   <b>defined,</b> <b>exists</b>
       Returns a true or false value if an item in the hash denoted by the key passed as an argument is defined
       or exists, respectively.

           [% hash.defined('somekey') ? 'yes' : 'no' %]
           [% hash.exists('somekey') ? 'yes' : 'no' %]

       When called without any argument, "hash.defined" returns true if the hash itself is defined (e.g. the
       same effect as "scalar.defined").

   <b>delete</b>
       Delete one or more items from the hash.

           [% hash.delete('foo', 'bar') %]

   <b>size</b>
       Returns the number of key/value pairs in the hash.

   <b>empty</b>
       Returns true if the hash is empty:

           [% IF config.empty %]
              No configuration available
           [% END %]

   <b>item</b>
       Returns an item from the hash using a key passed as an argument.

           [% hash.item('foo') %]  # same as hash.foo

</pre><h4><b>List</b> <b>Virtual</b> <b>Methods</b></h4><pre>
   <b>first,</b> <b>last</b>
       Returns the first/last item in the list.  The item is not removed from the list.

           [% results.first %] to [% results.last %]

       If either is given a numeric argument "n", they return the first or last "n" elements:

           The first 5 results are [% <a href="../man5/results.first.5.html">results.first</a>(5).join(", ") %].

   <b>size,</b> <b>max</b>
       Returns the size of a list (number of elements) and the maximum index number (size - 1), respectively.

           [% results.size %] search results matched your query

   <b>empty</b>
       Returns true if the list is empty:

           [% IF results.empty %]
              No results found
           [% END %]

   <b>defined</b>
       Returns a true or false value if the item in the list denoted by the argument is defined.

           [% <a href="../man3/list.defined.3.html">list.defined</a>(3) ? 'yes' : 'no' %]

       When called without any argument, "list.defined" returns true if the list itself is defined (e.g. the
       same effect as "scalar.defined").

   <b>reverse</b>
       Returns the items of the list in reverse order.

           [% FOREACH s IN scores.reverse %]
              ...
           [% END %]

   <b>join</b>
       Joins the items in the list into a single string, using Perl's join() function.

           [% items.join(', ') %]

   <b>grep</b>
       Returns a list of the items in the list that match a regular expression pattern.

           [% FOREACH directory.files.grep('\.txt$') %]
              ...
           [% END %]

   <b>sort,</b> <b>nsort</b>
       Returns the items in alpha ("sort") or numerical ("nsort") order.

           [% library = books.sort %]

       An argument can be provided to specify a search key.  Where an item in the list is a hash reference, the
       search key will be used to retrieve a value from the hash which will then be used as the comparison
       value.  Where an item is an object which implements a method of that name, the method will be called to
       return a comparison value.

           [% library = books.sort('author') %]

       In the example, the "books" list can contains hash references with an "author" key or objects with an
       "author" method.

       You can also specify multiple sort keys.

           [% library = books.sort('author', 'title') %]

       In this case the books will be sorted primarily by author.  If two or more books have authors with the
       same name then they will be sorted by title.

   <b>unshift(item),</b> <b>push(item)</b>
       The push() method adds an item or items to the end of list.

           [% mylist.push(foo) %]
           [% mylist.push(foo, bar) %]

       The unshift() method adds an item or items to the start of a list.

           [% mylist.unshift(foo) %]
           [% mylist.push(foo, bar)    %]

   <b>shift,</b> <b>pop</b>
       Removes the first/last item from the list and returns it.

           [% first = mylist.shift %]
           [% last  = mylist.pop   %]

   <b>unique</b>
       Returns a list of the unique elements in a list, in the same order as in the list itself.

           [% mylist = [ 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 1, 4, 3, 4, 5 ] %]
           [% numbers = mylist.unique %]

       While this can be explicitly sorted, it is not required that the list be sorted before the unique
       elements are pulled out (unlike the Unix command line utility).

           [% numbers = mylist.unique.sort %]

   <b>import</b>
       Appends the contents of one or more other lists to the end of the current list.

           [% one   = [ 1 2 3 ];
              two   = [ 4 5 6 ];
              three = [ 7 8 9 ];
              one.import(two, three);
              one.join(', );     # 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
           %]

   <b>merge</b>
       Returns a list composed of zero or more other lists:

           [% list_one = [ 1 2 3 ];
              list_two = [ 4 5 6 ];
              list_three = [ 7 8 9 ];
              list_four = list_one.merge(list_two, list_three);
           %]

       The original lists are not modified.

   <b>slice(from,</b> <b>to)</b>
       Returns a slice of items in the list between the bounds passed as arguments.  If the second argument,
       "to", isn't specified, then it defaults to the last item in the list.  The original list is not modified.

           [% first_three = list.slice(0,2) %]
           [% last_three  = list.slice(-3, -1) %]

   <b>splice(offset,</b> <b>length,</b> <b>list)</b>
       Behaves just like Perl's splice() function allowing you to selectively remove and/or replace elements in
       a list.  It removes "length" items from the list, starting at "offset" and replaces them with the items
       in "list".

           [% play_game = [ 'play', 'scrabble' ];
              ping_pong = [ 'ping', 'pong' ];
              redundant = play_game.splice(1, 1, ping_pong);
              redundant.join;     # scrabble
              play_game.join;     # play ping pong
           %]

       The method returns a list of the items removed by the splice.  You can use the "CALL" directive to ignore
       the output if you're not planning to do anything with it.

           [% CALL play_game.splice(1, 1, ping_pong) %]

       As well as providing a reference to a list of replacement values, you can pass in a list of items.

           [% CALL list.splice(-1, 0, 'foo', 'bar') %]

       Be careful about passing just one item in as a replacement value.  If it is a reference to a list then
       the contents of the list will be used.  If it's not a list, then it will be treated as a single value.
       You can use square brackets around a single item if you need to be explicit:

           [% # push a single item, an_item
              CALL list.splice(-1, 0, an_item);

              # push the items from another_list
              CALL list.splice(-1, 0, another_list);

              # push a reference to another_list
              CALL list.splice(-1, 0, [ another_list ]);
           %]

   <b>hash</b>
       Returns a reference to a hash array comprised of the elements in the list.  The even-numbered elements
       (0, 2, 4, etc) become the keys and the odd-numbered elements (1, 3, 5, etc) the values.

           [% list = ['pi', 3.14, 'e', 2.718] %]
           [% hash = list.hash %]
           [% hash.pi %]               # 3.14
           [% hash.e  %]               # 2.718

       If a numerical argument is provided then the hash returned will have keys generated for each item
       starting at the number specified.

           [% list = ['beer', 'peanuts'] %]
           [% hash = <a href="../man1/list.hash.1.html">list.hash</a>(1) %]
           [% hash.1  %]               # beer
           [% hash.2  %]               # peanuts

</pre><h4><b>Automagic</b> <b>Promotion</b> <b>of</b> <b>Scalar</b> <b>to</b> <b>List</b> <b>for</b> <b>Virtual</b> <b>Methods</b></h4><pre>
       In addition to the scalar virtual methods listed in the previous section, you can also call any list
       virtual method against a scalar.  The item will be automagically promoted to a single element list and
       the appropriate list virtual method will be called.

       One particular benefit of this comes when calling subroutines or object methods that return a list of
       items, rather than the preferred reference to a list of items.  In this case, the Template Toolkit
       automatically folds the items returned into a list.

       The upshot is that you can continue to use existing Perl modules or code that returns lists of items,
       without having to refactor it just to keep the Template Toolkit happy (by returning references to list).
       "Class::DBI" module is just one example of a particularly useful module which returns values this way.

       If only a single item is returned from a subroutine then the Template Toolkit assumes it meant to return
       a single item (rather than a list of 1 item) and leaves it well alone, returning the single value as it
       is.  If you're executing a database query, for example, you might get 1 item returned, or perhaps many
       items which are then folded into a list.

       The "FOREACH" directive will happily accept either a list or a single item which it will treat as a list.
       So it's safe to write directives like this, where we assume that the "something" variable is bound to a
       subroutine which may return one or more items:

           [% FOREACH item IN something %]
              ...
           [% END %]

       The automagic promotion of scalars to single item lists means that you can also use list virtual methods
       safely, even if you only get one item returned.  For example:

           [% something.first   %]
           [% something.join    %]
           [% something.reverse.join(', ') %]

       Note that this is very much a last-ditch behaviour.  If the single item return is an object with a
       "first" method, for example, then that will be called, as expected, in preference to the list virtual
       method.

</pre><h4><b>Defining</b> <b>Custom</b> <b>Virtual</b> <b>Methods</b></h4><pre>
       You can define your own virtual methods for scalars, lists and hash arrays.  The Template::Stash package
       variables $SCALAR_OPS, $LIST_OPS and $HASH_OPS are references to hash arrays that define these virtual
       methods.  "HASH_OPS" and "LIST_OPS" methods are subroutines that accept a hash/list reference as the
       first item. "SCALAR_OPS" are subroutines that accept a scalar value as the first item. Any other
       arguments specified when the method is called will be passed to the subroutine.

           # load Template::Stash to make method tables visible
           use Template::Stash;

           # define list method to return new list of odd numbers only
           $Template::Stash::LIST_OPS-&gt;{ odd } = sub {
               my $list = shift;
               return [ grep { $_ % 2 } @$list ];
           };

       Example template:

           [% primes = [ 2, 3, 5, 7, 9 ] %]
           [% primes.odd.join(', ') %]         # 3, 5, 7, 9
