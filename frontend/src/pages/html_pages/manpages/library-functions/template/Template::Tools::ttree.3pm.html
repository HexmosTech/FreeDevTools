</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Template::Tools::ttree - Process entire directory trees of templates

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           ttree [options] [files]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>ttree</u> script is used to process entire directory trees containing template files.  The resulting
       output from processing each file is then written to a corresponding file in a destination directory.  The
       script compares the modification times of source and destination files (where they already exist) and
       processes only those files that have been modified.  In other words, it is the equivalent of 'make' for
       the Template Toolkit.

       It supports a number of options which can be used to configure behaviour, define locations and set
       Template Toolkit options.  The script first reads the <u>.ttreerc</u> configuration file in the HOME directory,
       or an alternative file specified in the TTREERC environment variable.  Then, it processes any command
       line arguments, including any additional configuration files specified via the "-f" (file) option.

   <b>The</b> <u><b>.ttreerc</b></u> <b>Configuration</b> <b>File</b>
       When you run <u>ttree</u> for the first time it will ask you if you want it to create a <u>.ttreerc</u> file for you.
       This will be created in your home directory.

           $ ttree
           Do you want me to create a sample '.ttreerc' file for you?
           (file: /home/abw/.ttreerc)   [y/n]: y
           /home/abw/.ttreerc created.  Please edit accordingly and re-run ttree

       The purpose of this file is to set any <u>global</u> configuration options that you want applied <u>every</u> time
       <u>ttree</u> is run.  For example, you can use the "ignore" and "copy" option to provide regular expressions
       that specify which files should be ignored and which should be copied rather than being processed as
       templates.  You may also want to set flags like "verbose" and "recurse" according to your preference.

       A minimal <u>.ttreerc</u>:

           # ignore these files
           ignore = \b(CVS|RCS)\b
           ignore = ^#
           ignore = ~$

           # copy these files
           copy   = \.(gif|png|jpg|pdf)$

           # recurse into directories
           recurse

           # provide info about what's going on
           verbose

       In most cases, you'll want to create a different <u>ttree</u> configuration file for each project you're working
       on.  The "cfg" option allows you to specify a directory where <u>ttree</u> can find further configuration files.

           cfg = /home/abw/.ttree

       The "-f" command line option can be used to specify which configuration file should be used.  You can
       specify a filename using an absolute or relative path:

           $ ttree -f /home/abw/web/example/etc/ttree.cfg
           $ ttree -f ./etc/ttree.cfg
           $ ttree -f ../etc/ttree.cfg

       If the configuration file does not begin with "/" or "." or something that looks like a MS-DOS absolute
       path (e.g. "C:\\etc\\ttree.cfg") then <u>ttree</u> will look for it in the directory specified by the "cfg"
       option.

           $ ttree -f test1          # /home/abw/.ttree/test1

       The "cfg" option can only be used in the <u>.ttreerc</u> file.  All the other options can be used in the
       <u>.ttreerc</u> or any other <u>ttree</u> configuration file.  They can all also be specified as command line options.

       Remember that <u>.ttreerc</u> is always processed <u>before</u> any configuration file specified with the "-f" option.
       Certain options like "lib" can be used any number of times and accumulate their values.

       For example, consider the following configuration files:

       <u>/home/abw/.ttreerc</u>:

           cfg = /home/abw/.ttree
           lib = /usr/local/tt2/templates

       <u>/home/abw/.ttree/myconfig</u>:

           lib = /home/abw/web/example/templates/lib

       When <u>ttree</u> is invoked as follows:

           $ ttree -f myconfig

       the "lib" option will be set to the following directories:

           /usr/local/tt2/templates
           /home/abw/web/example/templates/lib

       Any templates located under <u>/usr/local/tt2/templates</u> will be used in preference to those located under
       <u>/home/abw/web/example/templates/lib</u>.  This may be what you want, but then again, it might not.  For this
       reason, it is good practice to keep the <u>.ttreerc</u> as simple as possible and use different configuration
       files for each <u>ttree</u> project.

   <b>Directory</b> <b>Options</b>
       The "src" option is used to define the directory containing the source templates to be processed.  It can
       be provided as a command line option or in a configuration file as shown here:

           src = /home/abw/web/example/templates/src

       Each template in this directory typically corresponds to a single web page or other document.

       The "dest" option is used to specify the destination directory for the generated output.

           dest = /home/abw/web/example/html

       The "lib" option is used to define one or more directories containing additional library templates.
       These templates are not documents in their own right and typically comprise of smaller, modular
       components like headers, footers and menus that are incorporated into pages templates.

           lib = /home/abw/web/example/templates/lib
           lib = /usr/local/tt2/templates

       The "lib" option can be used repeatedly to add further directories to the search path.

       A list of templates can be passed to <u>ttree</u> as command line arguments.

           $ ttree foo.html bar.html

       It looks for these templates in the "src" directory and processes them through the Template Toolkit,
       using any additional template components from the "lib" directories.  The generated output is then
       written to the corresponding file in the "dest" directory.

       If <u>ttree</u> is invoked without explicitly specifying any templates to be processed then it will process
       every file in the "src" directory.  If the "-r" (recurse) option is set then it will additionally iterate
       down through sub-directories and process and other template files it finds therein.

           $ ttree -r

       If a template has been processed previously, <u>ttree</u> will compare the modification times of the source and
       destination files.  If the source template (or one it is dependant on) has not been modified more
       recently than the generated output file then <u>ttree</u> will not process it.  The <u>-a</u> (all) option can be used
       to force <u>ttree</u> to process all files regardless of modification time.

           $ ttree -a

       Any templates explicitly named as command line argument are always processed and the modification time
       checking is bypassed.

   <b>File</b> <b>Options</b>
       The "ignore", "copy" and "accept" options are used to specify Perl regexen to filter file names.  Files
       that match any of the "ignore" options will not be processed.  Remaining files that match any of the
       "copy" regexen will be copied to the destination directory.  Remaining files that then match any of the
       "accept" criteria are then processed via the Template Toolkit.  If no "accept" parameter is specified
       then all files will be accepted for processing if not already copied or ignored.

           # ignore these files
           ignore = \b(CVS|RCS)\b
           ignore = ^#
           ignore = ~$

           # copy these files
           copy   = \.(gif|png|jpg|pdf)$

           # accept only .tt2 templates
           accept = \.tt2$

       The "suffix" option is used to define mappings between the file extensions for source templates and the
       generated output files.  The following example specifies that source templates with a ".tt2" suffix
       should be output as ".html" files:

           suffix tt2=html

       Or on the command line,

           --suffix tt2=html

       You can provide any number of different suffix mappings by repeating this option.

   <b>Template</b> <b>Dependencies</b>
       The "depend" and "depend_file" options allow you to specify how any given template file depends on
       another file or group of files.  The "depend" option is used to express a single dependency.

         $ ttree --depend foo=bar,baz

       This command line example shows the "--depend" option being used to specify that the <u>foo</u> file is
       dependant on the <u>bar</u> and <u>baz</u> templates.  This option can be used many time on the command line:

         $ ttree --depend foo=bar,baz --depend crash=bang,wallop

       or in a configuration file:

         depend foo=bar,baz
         depend crash=bang,wallop

       The file appearing on the left of the "=" is specified relative to the "src" or "lib" directories.  The
       file(s) appearing on the right can be specified relative to any of these directories or as absolute file
       paths.

       For example:

         $ ttree --depend foo=bar,/tmp/baz

       To define a dependency that applies to all files, use "*" on the left of the "=".

         $ ttree --depend *=header,footer

       or in a configuration file:

         depend *=header,footer

       Any templates that are defined in the "pre_process", "post_process", "process" or "wrapper" options will
       automatically be added to the list of global dependencies that apply to all templates.

       The "depend_file" option can be used to specify a file that contains dependency information.

           $ ttree --depend_file=/home/abw/web/example/etc/ttree.dep

       Here is an example of a dependency file:

          # This is a comment. It is ignored.

          index.html: header footer menubar

          header: titlebar hotlinks

          menubar: menuitem

          # spanning multiple lines with the backslash
          another.html: header footer menubar \
          sidebar searchform

       Lines beginning with the "#" character are comments and are ignored.  Blank lines are also ignored.  All
       other lines should provide a filename followed by a colon and then a list of dependant files separated by
       whitespace, commas or both.  Whitespace around the colon is also optional.  Lines ending in the "\"
       character are continued onto the following line.

       Files that contain spaces can be quoted. That is only necessary for files after the colon (':'). The file
       before the colon may be quoted if it contains a colon.

       As with the command line options, the "*" character can be used as a wildcard to specify a dependency for
       all templates.

           * : config,header

   <b>Template</b> <b>Toolkit</b> <b>Options</b>
       <u>ttree</u> also provides access to the usual range of Template Toolkit options.  For example, the
       "--pre_chomp" and "--post_chomp" <u>ttree</u> options correspond to the "PRE_CHOMP" and "POST_CHOMP" options.

       Run "ttree -h" for a summary of the options available.
