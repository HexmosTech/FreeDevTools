       Template::Toolkit - Template Processing System

</pre><h4><b>Introduction</b></h4><pre>
       The Template Toolkit is a collection of Perl modules which implement a fast, flexible, powerful and
       extensible template processing system.

       It is "input-agnostic" and can be used equally well for processing any kind of text documents: HTML, XML,
       CSS, Javascript, Perl code, plain text, and so on.  However, it is most often used for generating static
       and dynamic web content, so that's what we'll focus on here.

       Although the Template Toolkit is written in Perl, you don't need to be a Perl programmer to use it. It
       was designed to allow non-programmers to easily create and maintain template-based web sites without
       having to mess around writing Perl code or going crazy with cut-n-paste.

       However, the Template Toolkit is also designed to be extremely flexible and extensible. If you are a Perl
       programmer, or know someone who is, then you can easily hook the Template Toolkit into your existing
       code, data, databases and web applications. Furthermore, you can easily extend the Template Toolkit
       through the use of its plugin mechanism and other developer APIs.

       Whatever context you use it in, the primary purpose of the Template Toolkit is to allow you to create a
       clear separation between the presentation elements of your web site and everything else.

       If you're generating static web pages, then you can use it to separate the commonly repeated user
       interface elements on each page (headers, menus, footers, etc.) from the core content. If you're
       generating dynamic web pages for the front end of a web application, then you'll also be using it to keep
       the back-end Perl code entirely separate from the front-end HTML templates.  Either way, a <u>clear</u>
       <u>separation</u> <u>of</u> <u>concerns</u> is what allow you to concentrate on one thing at a time without the other things
       getting in your way.  And that's what the Template Toolkit is all about.

</pre><h4><b>Documentation</b></h4><pre>
       The documentation for the Template Toolkit is organised into five sections.

       The Template::Manual contains detailed information about using the Template Toolkit. It gives examples of
       its use and includes a full reference of the template language, configuration options, filters, plugins
       and other component parts.

       The Template::Modules page lists the Perl modules that comprise the Template Toolkit. It gives a brief
       explanation of what each of them does, and provides a link to the complete documentation for each module
       for further information. If you're a Perl programmer looking to use the Template Toolkit from your Perl
       programs then this section is likely to be of interest.

       Most, if not all of the information you need to call the Template Toolkit from Perl is in the
       documentation for the Template module. You only really need to start thinking about the other modules if
       you want to extend or modify the Template Toolkit in some way, or if you're interested in looking under
       the hood to see how it all works.

       The documentation for each module is embedded as POD in each module, so you can always use "perldoc" from
       the command line to read a module's documentation.  e.g.

           $ perldoc Template
           $ perldoc Template::Context
             ...etc...

       It's worth noting that all the other documentation, including the user manual is available as POD.  e.g.

           $ perldoc Template::Manual
           $ perldoc Template::Manual::Config
             ...etc...

       The Template::Tools section contains the documentation for Template::Tools::tpage and
       Template::Tools::ttree.  These are two command line programs that are distributed with the Template
       Toolkit.  tpage is used to process a single template file, ttree for processing entire directories of
       template files.

       The Template::Tutorial section contains two introductory tutorials on using the Template Toolkit. The
       first is Template::Tutorial::Web on generating web content. The second is Template::Tutorial::Datafile on
       using the Template Toolkit to generate other data formats including XML.

       The final section of the manual is Template::FAQ which contains answers to some of the Frequently Asked
       Questions about the Template Toolkit.

       You can read the documentation in HTML format either online at the Template Toolkit web site,
       &lt;<a href="http://template-toolkit.org/">http://template-toolkit.org/</a>&gt;, or by downloading the HTML version of the documentation from
       &lt;<a href="http://template-toolkit.org/download/index.html">http://template-toolkit.org/download/index.html</a>#html_docs&gt; and unpacking it on your local machine.
