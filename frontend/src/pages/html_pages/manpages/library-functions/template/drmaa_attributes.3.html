</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The drmaa_get_attribute_names() function returns into <u>values</u> a DRMAA names string vector  containing  the
       set of supported non-vector DRMAA job template attribute names. The set includes supported DRMAA reserved
       attribute  names  and  Grid  Engine  native  attribute names. The names in the names string vector can be
       extracted using <u><a href="../man3/drmaa_get_next_attr_name.3.html">drmaa_get_next_attr_name</a></u>(3).  The number of names in  the  names  string  vector  can  be
       determined  using  <u><a href="../man3/drmaa_get_num_attr_names.3.html">drmaa_get_num_attr_names</a></u>(3).   Note  that  this  function is only available in the 1.0
       implementation.  The caller is responsible for releasing the names string  vector  returned  into  <u>values</u>
       using <u><a href="../man3/drmaa_release_attr_names.3.html">drmaa_release_attr_names</a></u>(3).  Use <u><a href="../man3/drmaa_set_attribute.3.html">drmaa_set_attribute</a></u>(3) and <u><a href="../man3/drmaa_get_attribute.3.html">drmaa_get_attribute</a></u>(3) for setting and
       inspecting non-vector attributes.

   <b>drmaa_get_vector_attribute_names()</b>
       The  drmaa_get_vector_attribute_names()  function  returns  into  <u>values</u>  a  DRMAA  names  string  vector
       containing the set of supported vector DRMAA job template attribute names.  The  set  includes  supported
       DRMAA  reserved  attribute  names  and  Grid Engine native attribute names. The names in the names string
       vector can be extracted using <u><a href="../man3/drmaa_get_next_attr_name.3.html">drmaa_get_next_attr_name</a></u>(3).  The caller is responsible for  releasing  the
       names     string    vector    returned    into    <u>values</u>    using    <u><a href="../man3/drmaa_release_attr_names.3.html">drmaa_release_attr_names</a></u>(3).     Use
       <u><a href="../man3/drmaa_set_vector_attribute.3.html">drmaa_set_vector_attribute</a></u>(3)  and  <u><a href="../man3/drmaa_get_vector_attribute.3.html">drmaa_get_vector_attribute</a></u>(3)  for  setting  and  inspecting   vector
       attributes.

   <b>drmaa_get_next_attr_name()</b>
       Each  time  drmaa_get_next_attr_name() is called it returns into the buffer, <u>value</u>, up to <u>value_len</u> bytes
       of the next entry stored in the DRMAA names  string  vector,  <u>values</u>.   Once  the  names  list  has  been
       exhausted, DRMAA_ERRNO_NO_MORE_ELEMENTS is returned.

   <b>drmaa_get_num_attr_names()</b>
       The  drmaa_get_num_attr_names() returns into <u>size</u> the number of entries in the DRMAA names string vector.
       This function is only available in the 1.0 implementation.

   <b>drmaa_release_attr_names()</b>
       The drmaa_release_attr_names() function releases all resources associated with  the  DRMAA  names  string
       vector, <u>values</u>.

   <b>Attribute</b> <b>Priorities</b>
       DRMAA job template attributes can be set from six different sources.  In order of precedence, from lowest
       to  highest,  these are: options set by DRMAA automatically by default, options set in the <u><a href="../man5/sge_request.5.html">sge_request</a></u>(5)
       file(s), options set in the script file, options set by the drmaa_job_category attribute, options set  by
       the drmaa_native_specification attribute, and options set through other DRMAA attributes.

       By  default  DRMAA  sets four options for all jobs.  These are "-p 0", "-b yes", "-shell no", and "-w e".
       This means that by default, all jobs will have priority 0, all jobs will be treated as  binary,  i.e.  no
       scripts  args  will  be  parsed,  all  jobs  will be executed without a wrapper shell, and jobs which are
       unschedulable will cause a submit error.

       The <u><a href="../man5/sge_request.5.html">sge_request</a></u>(5) file, found in the $SGE_ROOT/$SGE_CELL/common directory, may  contain  options  to  be
       applied  to  all  jobs.   The .sge_request file found in the user's home directory or the current working
       directory may also contain  options  to  be  applied  to  certain  jobs.   See  <u><a href="../man5/sge_request.5.html">sge_request</a></u>(5)  for  more
       information.

       If  the  <u><a href="../man5/sge_request.5.html">sge_request</a></u>(5)  file  contains "-b no" or if the drmaa_native_specification attribute is set and
       contains "-b no", the script file will be parsed for in-line arguments.  Otherwise, no scripts args  will
       be interpreted.  See <u><a href="../man1/qsub.1.html">qsub</a></u>(1) for more information.

       If  the  drmaa_job_category attribute is set, and the category it points to exists in one of the <u><a href="../man5/qtask.5.html">qtask</a></u>(5)
       files, the options associated with that category will be applied to the job template.  See  <u><a href="../man5/qtask.5.html">qtask</a></u>(5)  and
       the drmaa_job_category attribute below for more information.

       If  the drmaa_native_specification attribute is set, all options contained therein will be applied to the
       job template.  See the drmaa_native_specification below for more information.

       Other DRMAA attributes will override any  previous  settings.   For  example,  if  the  sge_request  file
       contains  "-j y", but the drmaa_join_files attribute is set to "n", the ultimate result is that the input
       and output files will remain separate.

       For various reasons, some options are silently ignored by DRMAA.  Setting any of these options will  have
       no  effect.   The  ignored options are: -cwd, -help, -sync, -t, -verify, -w w, and -w v.  The -cwd option
       can be re-enabled by setting the environment variable, SGE_DRMAA_ALLOW_CWD.  However, the -cwd option  is
       not thread safe and should not be used in a multi-threaded context.

              * See the individual attribute description below

</pre><h4><b>DRMAA</b> <b>JOB</b> <b>TEMPLATE</b> <b>ATTRIBUTES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>drmaa_remote_command</b> <b>-</b> <u><b>remote_command</b></u>
       Specifies  the  remote  command  to execute. The <u>remote_command</u> must be the path of an executable that is
       available at the job's execution host.  If the path is relative, it is assumed  to  be  relative  to  the
       working directory, usually set through the drmaa_wd attribute.  If working directory is not set, the path
       is assumed to be relative to the user's home directory.

       The  file  pointed to by remote_command may either be an executable binary or an executable script.  If a
       script, it must include the path to the shell in a #! line at the beginning of the script.   By  default,
       the  remote  command  will be executed directly, as by <u><a href="../man2/exec.2.html">exec</a></u>(2).  To have the remote command executed in a
       shell, such as to preserve environment settings, use the drmaa_native_specification attribute to  include
       the "-shell yes" option.  Jobs which are executed by a wrapper shell fail differently from jobs which are
       executed directly.  When a job which contains a user error, such as an invalid path to the executable, is
       executed by a wrapper shell, the job will execute successfully, but exit with a return code of 1.  When a
       job  which  contains  such  an  error  is executed directly, it will enter the DRMAA_PS_FAILED state upon
       execution.

   <b>drmaa_js_state</b> <b>-</b> {<b>drmaa_hold</b>|<b>drmaa_active</b>}
       Specifies the job state at submission. The string values 'drmaa_hold' and 'drmaa_active'  are  supported.
       When  'drmaa_active' is used the job is submitted in a runnable state.  When 'drmaa_hold' is used the job
       is submitted in user hold state  (either  DRMAA_PS_USER_ON_HOLD  or  DRMAA_PS_USER_SYSTEM_ON_HOLD).  This
       attribute is largely equivalent to  the <u><a href="../man1/qsub.1.html">qsub</a></u>(1) submit option '-h'.

   <b>drmaa_wd</b> <b>-</b> <u><b>directory_name</b></u>
       Specifies  the  directory  name  where  the  job  will  be executed. A '$drmaa_hd_ph$' placeholder at the
       beginning of the <u>directory_name</u> denotes the remaining string portion as a relative directory name that is
       resolved relative to the job user's home directory at the execution host. When the DRMAA job template  is
       used  for  bulk  job submission (see also <u><a href="../man3/drmaa_run_bulk_job.3.html">drmaa_run_bulk_job</a></u>(3)) the '$drmaa_incr_ph$' placeholder can be
       used at any position within <u>directory_name</u> to cause a substitution with the parametric job's index.   The
       <u>directory_name</u> must be specified in a syntax that is common at the host where the job is executed. If set
       to  a  relative path and no placeholder is used, a path relative to the user's home directory is assumed.
       If not set, the working directory will default to the user's  home  directory.   If  set  and  the  given
       directory does not exist the job will enter the DRMAA_PS_FAILED state when run.

       Note  that  the working directory path is the path on the execution host.  If binary mode is disabled, an
       attempt to find the job script will be made, relative to the working directory path.  That means that the
       path to the script must be the same on both the submission and execution hosts.

   <b>drmaa_job_name</b> <b>-</b> <u><b>job_name</b></u>
       Specifies the job's name. Setting the job name is equivalent to use of <u><a href="../man1/qsub.1.html">qsub</a></u>(1) submit  option  '-N'  with
       <u>job_name</u> as option argument.

   <b>drmaa_input_path</b> <b>-</b> [<u><b>hostname</b></u>]<b>:</b><u><b>file_path</b></u>
       Specifies the standard input of the job. Unless set elsewhere, if not explicitly set in the job template,
       the job is started with an empty input stream. If the standard input is set it specifies the network path
       of the job's input stream file.

       When  the  'drmaa_transfer_files' job template attribute is supported and contains the character 'i', the
       input file will be fetched by Grid Engine from the specified host or from the submit host if no  <u>hostname</u>
       is specified. When the 'drmaa_transfer_files' job template attribute is not supported or does not contain
       the  character 'i', the input file is always expected at the host where the job is executed regardless of
       any <u>hostname</u> specified.

       If the DRMAA job template will be used for bulk job  submission,  (see  also  <u><a href="../man3/drmaa_run_bulk_job.3.html">drmaa_run_bulk_job</a></u>(3))  the
       '$drmaa_incr_ph$'  placeholder  can be used at any position within <u>file_path</u> to cause a substitution with
       the parametric job's index. A '$drmaa_hd_ph$' placeholder at  the  beginning  of  <u>file_path</u>  denotes  the
       remaining  portion  of the <u>file_path</u> as a relative file specification resolved relative to the job user's
       home directory at the host where the file is located. A '$drmaa_wd_ph$' placeholder at the  beginning  of
       <u>file_path</u>  denotes  the  remaining  portion  of  the  <u>file_path</u> as a relative file specification resolved
       relative to the job's working directory at the host where the file is  located.  The  <u>file_path</u>  must  be
       specified  in a syntax that is common at the host where the file is located. If set and the file can't be
       read the job enters the state DRMAA_PS_FAILED.

   <b>drmaa_output_path</b> <b>-</b> [<u><b>hostname</b></u>]<b>:</b><u><b>file_path</b></u>
       Specifies the standard output of the job. If not explicitly set in the job template, the  whereabouts  of
       the  job's  output  stream is not defined. If set, this attribute specifies the network path of the job's
       output stream file.

       When the 'drmaa_transfer_files' job template attribute is supported and contains the character  'o',  the
       output file will be transferred by Grid Engine to the specified host or to the submit host if no <u>hostname</u>
       is specified. When the 'drmaa_transfer_files' job template attribute is not supported or does not contain
       the character 'o', the output file is always kept at the host where the job is executed regardless of any
       <u>hostname</u> specified.

       If  the  DRMAA  job template will be used for of bulk job submission (see also <u><a href="../man3/drmaa_run_bulk_job.3.html">drmaa_run_bulk_job</a></u>(3)) the
       '$drmaa_incr_ph$' placeholder can be used at any position within the <u>file_path</u> to  cause  a  substitution
       with the parametric job's index.  A '$drmaa_hd_ph$' placeholder at the beginning of <u>file_path</u> denotes the
       remaining  portion  of the <u>file_path</u> as a relative file specification resolved relative to the job user's
       home directory at the host where the file is located. A '$drmaa_wd_ph$' placeholder at the  beginning  of
       the  <u>file_path</u>  denotes  the  remaining  portion  of  <u>file_path</u> as a relative file specification resolved
       relative to the job's working directory at the host where the file is  located.  The  <u>file_path</u>  must  be
       specified  in a syntax that is common at the host where the file is located. If set and the file can't be
       written before execution the job enters the state DRMAA_PS_FAILED.

   <b>drmaa_error_path</b> <b>-</b> [<u><b>hostname</b></u>]<b>:</b><u><b>file_path</b></u>
       Specifies the standard error of the job. If not explicitly set in the job template,  the  whereabouts  of
       the  job's  error  stream  is not defined. If set, this attribute specifies the network path of the job's
       error stream file.

       When the 'drmaa_transfer_files' job template attribute is supported and contains the character  'e',  the
       output file will be transferred by Grid Engine to the specified host or to the submit host if no <u>hostname</u>
       is specified. When the 'drmaa_transfer_files' job template attribute is not supported or does not contain
       the  character 'e', the error file is always kept at the host where the job is executed regardless of any
       <u>hostname</u> specified.

       If the DRMAA job template will be used for of bulk job submission (see  also  <u><a href="../man3/drmaa_run_bulk_job.3.html">drmaa_run_bulk_job</a></u>(3))  the
       '$drmaa_incr_ph$'  placeholder  can  be used at any position within the <u>file_path</u> to cause a substitution
       with the parametric job's index.  A '$drmaa_hd_ph$' placeholder at the beginning of the <u>file_path</u> denotes
       the remaining portion of the <u>file_path</u> as a relative file specification  resolved  relative  to  the  job
       user's  home  directory  at  the  host  where  the  file is located. A '$drmaa_wd_ph$' placeholder at the
       beginning of  the  <u>file_path</u>  denotes  the  remaining  portion  of  the  <u>file_path</u>  as  a  relative  file
       specification resolved relative to the job's working directory at the host where the file is located. The
       <u>file_path</u>  must be specified in a syntax that is common at the host where the file is located. If set and
       the file can't be written before execution the job enters the state DRMAA_PS_FAILED. The  attribute  name
       is drmaa_error_path.

   <b>drmaa_join_files</b> <b>-</b> {<b>y</b>|<b>n</b>}
       Specifies  if  the job's error stream should be intermixed with the output stream.  If not explicitly set
       in the job template the attribute defaults to 'n'. Either  'y'  or  'n'  can  be  specified.  If  'y'  is
       specified Grid Engine will ignore the value of the 'drmaa_error_path' job template attribute and intermix
       the standard error stream with the standard output stream as specified with 'drmaa_output_path'.

   <b>drmaa_submit_as_euid</b> <b>-</b> {<b>y</b>|<b>n</b>}
       Specifies whether the jobs submitted using the job template will will run under the authority of the real
       or  the effective user and group ID. If not explicitly set in the job template, the attribute defaults to
       'n'. Either 'y' or 'n' can be specified.  If 'y' is specified Grid Engine will use the effective user and
       group ID, otherwise the real user and group ID is used.

       With MUNGE security the euid is always used.  (See <u><a href="../man5/bootstrap.5.html">bootstrap</a></u>(5) for information on security settings.)

   <b>drmaa_v_argv</b> <b>-</b> <u><b>argv1</b></u> <u><b>argv2</b></u> ...
       Specifies the arguments to the job.

   <b>drmaa_job_category</b> <b>-</b> <u><b>category</b></u>
       Specifies the DRMAA job category. The <u>category</u> string is used by Grid Engine  as  a  reference  into  the
       <u><a href="../man5/qtask.5.html">qtask</a></u>(5)  file.  Certain  <u><a href="../man1/qsub.1.html">qsub</a></u>(1)  options  used in the referenced qtask file line are applied to the job
       template before submission to allow site-specific resolving of resources and/or  policies.   The  cluster
       qtask  file,  the local qtask file, and the user qtask file are searched. Job settings resulting from job
       template category are overridden by settings resulting from the job  template  drmaa_native_specification
       attribute as well as by explicit DRMAA job template settings.

       In  order  to  avoid  collisions  with command names in the qtask files, it is recommended that DRMAA job
       category names take the form: &lt;category_name&gt;.cat.

       The options -help, -sync, -t, -verify, and -w w|v are ignored.  The -cwd option  is  ignored  unless  the
       $SGE_DRMAA_ALLOW_CWD environment variable is set.

   <b>drmaa_native_specification</b> <b>-</b> <u><b>native_specification</b></u>
       Specifies Grid Engine native <u><a href="../man1/qsub.1.html">qsub</a></u>(1) options which will be interpreted as part of the DRMAA job template.
       All  options  available  to  <u><a href="../man1/qsub.1.html">qsub</a></u>(1)  command  may be used in the <u>native_specification</u>, except for -help,
       -sync, -t, -verify, and -w w|v.  The -cwd option may only be used if the SGE_DRMAA_ALLOW_CWD  environment
       variable is set.  This is because the current parsing algorithm for -cwd is not thread-safe.  Options set
       in  the  <u>native</u>  <u>specification</u> will be overridden by the corresponding DRMAA attributes.  See <u><a href="../man1/qsub.1.html">qsub</a></u>(1) for
       more information on qsub options.

   <b>drmaa_v_env</b> <b>-</b> <u><b>name1</b></u><b>=</b><u><b>value1</b></u> <u><b>name2</b></u><b>=</b><u><b>value2</b></u> <b>...</b>
       Specifies the job environment. Each environment <u>value</u> defines the remote environment. The <u>value</u> overrides
       the remote environment values if there is a collision.

   <b>drmaa_v_email</b> <b>-</b> <u><b>email1</b></u> <u><b>email2</b></u> <b>...</b>
       Specifies e-mail addresses that are used to report the job completion and status.

   <b>drmaa_block_email</b> <b>-</b> {<b>0</b>|<b>1</b>}
       Specifies whether e-mail sending shall blocked or not.  By default email is not  sent.   If,  however,  a
       setting  in  a  cluster or user settings file or the 'drmaa_native_specification' or 'drmaa_job_category'
       attribute enables sending email in association with job events, the  'drmaa_block_email'  attribute  will
       override that setting, causing no email to be sent.

   <b>drmaa_start_time</b> <b>-</b> [[[[<u><b>CC</b></u>]<u><b>YY</b></u><b>/</b>]<u><b>MM</b></u><b>/</b>]<u><b>DD</b></u>] <u><b>hh</b></u><b>:</b><u><b>mm</b></u>[<b>:</b><u><b>ss</b></u>] [{<b>-</b>|<b>+</b>}<u><b>UU</b></u>:<u><b>uu</b></u>]
       Specifies the earliest time when the job may be eligible to be run where

              <u>CC</u> is the first two digits of the year (century-1)
              <u>YY</u> is the last two digits of the year
              <u>MM</u> is the two digits of the month [01,12]
              <u>DD</u> is the two digit day of the month [01,31]
              <u>hh</u> is the two digit hour of the day [00,23]
              <u>mm</u> is the two digit minute of the day [00,59]
              <u>ss</u> is the two digit second of the minute [00,61]
              <u>UU</u> is the two digit hours since (before) UTC
              <u>uu</u> is the two digit minutes since (before) UTC

       If  the optional UTC-offset is not specified, the offset associated with the local timezone will be used.
       If the day (DD) is not specified, the current day will  be  used  unless  the  specified  hour:mm:ss  has
       already  elapsed,  in  which  case  the  next day will be used.  Similarly for month (MM), year (YY), and
       century-1 (CC).  Example: The time: Sep 3 4:47:27 PM  PDT  2002,  could  be  represented  as:  2002/09/03
       16:47:27 -07:00.

   <b>drmaa_transfer_files</b> <b>-</b> [<b>i</b>][<b>o</b>][<b>e</b>]
       Specifies,  which  of the standard I/O files (stdin, stdout and stderr) are to be transferred to/from the
       execution host. If not set, defaults to "". Any combination of 'e', 'i' and 'o' may  be  specified.   See
       drmaa_input_path,  drmaa_output_path  and  drmaa_error_path  for  information  about  how  to specify the
       standard input file, standard output file and standard error file.  The file  transfer  mechanism  itself
       must  be configured by the administrator (see <u><a href="../man5/sge_conf.5.html">sge_conf</a></u>(5)).  When it is configured, the administrator has
       to enable drmaa_transfer_files.  If it is not configured, "drmaa_transfer_files" is not enabled and can't
       be used.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENTAL</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>SGE_ROOT</b>       Specifies the location of the Grid Engine standard configuration files.

       <b>SGE_CELL</b>       If set, specifies the default Grid Engine cell to be used. To address a Grid  Engine  cell
                      Grid Engine uses (in the order of precedence):

                             The name of the cell specified in the environment variable SGE_CELL, if it is set.

                             The name of the default cell, i.e. <b>default</b>.

       <b>SGE_QMASTER_PORT</b>
                      If  set,  specifies  the  tcp  port  on  which  <u><a href="../man8/sge_qmaster.8.html">sge_qmaster</a></u>(8)  is  expected to listen for
                      communication requests.  Most installations will use  a  services  map  entry  instead  to
                      define that port.

       <b>SGE_DEBUG_LEVEL</b>
                      If  set,  specifies  that  debug  information should be written to stderr. In addition the
                      level of detail in which debug information is generated is defined.

       <b>SGE_DRMAA_ALLOW_CWD</b>
                      Enables the parsing of the -cwd option from the sge_request file(s), job category,  and/or
                      the  native  specification  attribute.   This  option  is  disabled by default because the
                      algorithm for parsing the -cwd option is not thread-safe.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUES</b></h4><pre>
       Upon  successful   completion,   drmaa_get_attribute_names(),   drmaa_get_vector_attribute_names(),   and
       drmaa_get_next_attr_name()   return   DRMAA_ERRNO_SUCCESS.   Other  values  indicate  an  error.   Up  to
       <u>error_diag_len</u> characters of  error  related  diagnosis  information  is  then  provided  in  the  buffer
       <u>error_diagnosis</u>.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       The   drmaa_get_attribute_names(),   drmaa_get_vector_attribute_names(),  and  drmaa_get_next_attr_name()
       functions will fail if:

   <b>DRMAA_ERRNO_INTERNAL_ERROR</b>
       Unexpected or internal DRMAA error, like system call failure, etc.

   <b>DRMAA_ERRNO_DRM_COMMUNICATION_FAILURE</b>
       Could not contact DRM system for this request.

   <b>DRMAA_ERRNO_AUTH_FAILURE</b>
       The specified request is not processed successfully due to authorization failure.

   <b>DRMAA_ERRNO_INVALID_ARGUMENT</b>
       The input value for an argument is invalid.

   <b>DRMAA_ERRNO_NO_ACTIVE_SESSION</b>
       Failed because there is no active session.

   <b>DRMAA_ERRNO_NO_MEMORY</b>
       Failed allocating memory.

       The drmaa_get_next_attr_name() will fail if:

   <b>DRMAA_ERRNO_INVALID_ATTRIBUTE_VALUE</b>
       When there are no more entries in the vector.
