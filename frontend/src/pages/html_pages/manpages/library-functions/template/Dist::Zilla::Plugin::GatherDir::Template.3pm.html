</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Dist::Zilla::Plugin::GatherDir::Template - gather all the files in a directory and use them as templates

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 6.032

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This is a subclass of the GatherDir plugin.  It works just like its parent class, except that each
       gathered file is processed through Text::Template.

       The variables $plugin and $dist will be provided to the template, set to the GatherDir::Template plugin
       and the Dist::Zilla object, respectively.

       It is meant to be used when minting dists with "dzil new", but could be used in building existing dists,
       too.

</pre><h4><b>PERL</b> <b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This module should work on any version of perl still receiving updates from the Perl 5 Porters.  This
       means it should work on any version of perl released in the last two to three years.  (That is, if the
       most recently released version is v5.40, then this module should work on both v5.40 and v5.38.)

       Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made that the minimum required version
       will not be increased.  The version may be increased for any reason, and there is no promise that patches
       will be accepted to lower the minimum required perl.

</pre><h4><b>ATTRIBUTES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>rename</b>
       Use this to rename files while they are being gathered.  This is a list of key/value pairs, specified
       thus:

           [GatherDir::Template]
           rename.DISTNAME = $dist-&gt;name =~ s/...//r
           rename.DISTVER  = $dist-&gt;version

       This example will replace the tokens "DISTNAME" and "DISTVER" with the expressions they are associated
       with. These expressions will be treated as though they were miniature Text::Template sections, and hence
       will receive the same variables that the file itself receives, i.e. $dist and $plugin.
