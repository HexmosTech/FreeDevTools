</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Net::SIP::Simple::RTP - simple RTP handling for Net::SIP::Simple

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         my $echo_10 = Net::SIP::Simple-&gt;rtp( 'media_recv_echo', 'output.pcmu-8000', 10 );
         my $announce = Net::SIP::Simple-&gt;rtp( 'media_send_recv', 'announce.pcmu-8000', 2 );

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This package handles simple RTP stuff for testing and small applications.  It provides methods for
       receiving PCUM/8000 data and for echoing them back or for sending and receiving PCMU/8000 data.

       It's used from method <b>rtp</b> in Net::SIP::Simple.

</pre><h4><b>SUBROUTINES</b></h4><pre>
       media_recv_echo ( [ OUTPUT, DELAY ] )
           Receives RTP data and echoes them back to the sender.  If OUTPUT is given it will be used as the file
           for saving the received data without the RTP header.

           OUTPUT might also be a callback which gets the payload as argument.

           If  DELAY  is &gt;0 the data will not be echoed back immediately but with a delay of DELAY packets (e.g.
           with DELAY 10 it will send back the first packet after it received the 10th packet).  If DELAY is  &lt;0
           the  data  will  not  be  echoed back.  If DELAY is not given or equal 0 the data will be echoed back
           immediately.

           If no traffic comes in for more then 10 seconds it will hang up the call because of inactivity.

       media_send_recv ( INPUT, [ REPEAT, OUTPUT ] )
           Will read data from file INPUT and send them as RTP to peer.  It will assume that each data block  in
           INPUT  consists of 160 bytes, which is right for PCMU/8000 without RTP header. The RTP header will be
           added to the data.

           If it reaches the end of the file it will stop unless REPEAT is given in which case  it  will  repeat
           the sending REPEAT times (if REPEAT is less 0 it will repeat forever e.g. until the other party hangs
           up).  On  stopping  it  will  invoke  the  callback  <b>cb_rtp_done</b>  from  the connection params for the
           Net::SIP::Simple::Call or if this is not given it will close the call by issuing a BYE.

           INPUT might also be a callback usable by <b>invoke_callback</b> in Net::SIP::Util which returns the data  to
           send. In this case REPEAT is not used.

           Incoming  data  will be written to the optional OUTPUT file like in <b>media_recv_echo</b>. The content from
           OUTPUT has the same format as INPUT or OUTPUT from <b>media_recv_echo</b>.

           OUTPUT might also be a callback which gets the payload as an argument.

           If no traffic comes in for more then 10 seconds it will hang up the call because of inactivity.
