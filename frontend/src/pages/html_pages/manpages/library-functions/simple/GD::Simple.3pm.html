</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       GD::Simple is a subclass of the GD library that shortens many of the long GD method calls by storing
       information about the pen color, size and position in the GD object itself.  It also adds a small number
       of "turtle graphics" style calls for those who prefer to work in polar coordinates.  In addition, the
       library allows you to use symbolic names for colors, such as "chartreuse", and will manage the colors for
       you.

   <b>The</b> <b>Pen</b>
       GD::Simple maintains a "pen" whose settings are used for line- and shape-drawing operations.  The pen has
       the following properties:

       fgcolor
           The pen foreground color is the color of lines and the borders of filled and unfilled shapes.

       bgcolor
           The pen background color is the color of the contents of filled shapes.

       pensize
           The pen size is the width of the pen.  Larger sizes draw thicker lines.

       position
           The pen position is its current position on the canvas in (X,Y) coordinates.

       angle
           When  drawing  in  turtle  mode,  the pen angle determines the current direction of lines of relative
           length.

       turn
           When drawing in turtle mode, the turn determines the clockwise or counterclockwise angle that the pen
           will turn before drawing the next line.

       font
           The font to use when drawing text.  Both built-in bitmapped fonts and TrueType fonts are supported.

       fontsize
           The size of the font to use when drawing with TrueType fonts.

       One sets the position and properties of the pen and then draws.  As the drawing progresses, the  position
       of the pen is updated.

   <b>Methods</b>
       GD::Simple  introduces  a  number of new methods, a few of which have the same name as GD::Image methods,
       and hence change their behavior. In addition to these new methods, GD::Simple objects support all of  the
       GD::Image  methods.  If you make a method call that isn't directly supported by GD::Simple, it refers the
       request to the underlying GD::Image object.  Hence one can load a JPEG image into GD::Simple and  declare
       it to be TrueColor by using this call, which is effectively inherited from GD::Image:

         my $img = GD::Simple-&gt;newFromJpeg('./myimage.jpg',1);

       The rest of this section describes GD::Simple-specific methods.

       $img = GD::Simple-&gt;new($x,$y [,$truecolor])
       $img = GD::Simple-&gt;new($gd)
           Create  a  new GD::Simple object. There are two forms of <b>new()</b>. In the first form, pass the width and
           height of the desired canvas, and optionally a boolean flag to request  a  truecolor  image.  In  the
           second form, pass a previously-created GD::Image object.

       GD::Simple-&gt;class('GD');
       GD::Simple-&gt;class('GD::SVG');
           Select  whether  <b>new()</b>  should use GD or GD::SVG internally. Call GD::Simple-&gt;class('GD::SVG') before
           calling <b>new()</b> if you wish to generate SVG images.

           If future GD subclasses are created, this method will subport them.

       $img-&gt;moveTo($x,$y)
           This call changes the position of the pen without drawing. It moves the pen to  position  ($x,$y)  on
           the drawing canvas.

       $img-&gt;move($dx,$dy)
       $img-&gt;move($dr)
           This  call  changes  the position of the pen without drawing. When called with two arguments it moves
           the pen $dx pixels to the right and $dy pixels downward.  When called with one argument it moves  the
           pen $dr pixels along the vector described by the current pen angle.

       $img-&gt;lineTo($x,$y)
           The  <b>lineTo()</b>  call  simultaneously  draws  and  moves the pen.  It draws a line from the current pen
           position to the position defined by ($x,$y) using the current pen size and color.  After drawing, the
           position of the pen is updated to the new position.

       $img-&gt;line($x1,$y1,$x2,$y2 [,$color])
       $img-&gt;line($dx,$dy)
       $img-&gt;line($dr)
           The <b>line()</b> call simultaneously draws and moves the pen. When called with two  arguments  it  draws  a
           line  from  the  current  position  of the pen to the position $dx pixels to the right and $dy pixels
           down.  When called with one argument, it draws a line $dr pixels long along the angle defined by  the
           current pen angle.

           When called with four or five arguments, <b>line()</b> behaves like GD::Image-&gt;<b>line()</b>.

       $img-&gt;clear
           This method clears the canvas by painting over it with the current background color.

       $img-&gt;rectangle($x1,$y1,$x2,$y2)
           This  method  draws  the rectangle defined by corners ($x1,$y1), ($x2,$y2). The rectangle's edges are
           drawn in the foreground color and its contents are filled with the background color. To draw a  solid
           rectangle  set  bgcolor  equal  to  fgcolor.  To draw an unfilled rectangle (transparent inside), set
           bgcolor to undef.

       $img-&gt;ellipse($width,$height)
           This method draws the ellipse centered at the current location with width $width and height  $height.
           The ellipse's border is drawn in the foreground color and its contents are filled with the background
           color. To draw a solid ellipse set bgcolor equal to fgcolor. To draw an unfilled ellipse (transparent
           inside), set bgcolor to undef.

       $img-&gt;arc([$cx,$cy,] $width,$height,$start,$end [,$style])
           This  method  draws  filled  and  unfilled  arcs, at the current position, with the current fore- and
           background colors.  See GD for a description of the arguments. To draw a solid arc  (such  as  a  pie
           wedge) set bgcolor equal to fgcolor. To draw an unfilled arc, set bgcolor to undef.

       $img-&gt;polygon($poly)
           This  method  draws filled and unfilled polygon using the current settings of fgcolor for the polygon
           border and bgcolor for the polygon fill color.  See GD for a description  of  creating  polygons.  To
           draw a solid polygon set bgcolor equal to fgcolor. To draw an unfilled polygon, set bgcolor to undef.

       $img-&gt;polyline($poly)
           This   method   draws   polygons   without   closing   the   first  and  last  vertices  (similar  to
           GD::Image-&gt;<b>unclosedPolygon()</b>). It uses the fgcolor to draw the line.

       $img-&gt;string($string)
           This method draws the indicated string starting at the current position of the pen. The pen is  moved
           to the end of the drawn string.  Depending on the font selected with the <b>font()</b> method, this will use
           either  a  bitmapped GD font or a TrueType font.  The angle of the pen will be consulted when drawing
           the text. For TrueType fonts, any angle is accepted.  For GD bitmapped fonts, the angle can be either
           0 (draw horizontal) or -90 (draw upwards).

           For consistency between the TrueType and GD font behavior, the string is always  drawn  so  that  the
           current  position of the pen corresponds to the bottom left of the first character of the text.  This
           is different from the GD behavior, in which the first character of bitmapped fonts  hangs  down  from
           the pen point.

           This method returns a polygon indicating the bounding box of the rendered text.  If an error occurred
           (such as invalid font specification) it returns undef and an error message in $@.

       $metrics = $img-&gt;fontMetrics
       ($metrics,$width,$height) = GD::Simple-&gt;fontMetrics($font,$fontsize,$string)
           This  method  returns  information  about  the current font, most commonly a TrueType font. It can be
           invoked as an instance method (on a previously-created GD::Simple object) or as a  class  method  (on
           the 'GD::Simple' class).

           When  called  as  an  instance  method,  <b>fontMetrics()</b>  takes  no arguments and returns a single hash
           reference containing the metrics that describe  the  currently  selected  font  and  size.  The  hash
           reference contains the following information:

             xheight      the base height of the font from the bottom to the top of
                          a lowercase 'm'

             ascent       the length of the upper stem of the lowercase 'd'

             descent      the length of the lower step of the lowercase 'j'

             lineheight   the distance from the bottom of the 'j' to the top of
                          the 'd'

             leading      the distance between two adjacent lines

           This description and code was changed with 2.75.

       ($delta_x,$delta_y)= $img-&gt;stringBounds($string)
           This  method  indicates  the  X  and Y offsets (which may be negative) that will occur when the given
           string is drawn using the current font, fontsize and angle. When the string is drawn horizontally, it
           gives the width and height of the string's bounding box.

       $delta_x = $img-&gt;stringWidth($string)
           This method indicates the width of the string given the current font, fontsize and angle. It  is  the
           same as ($img-&gt;stringBounds($string))[0]

       ($x,$y) = $img-&gt;curPos
           Return the current position of the pen.  Set the current position using <b>moveTo()</b>.

       $font = $img-&gt;font([$newfont] [,$newsize])
           Get  or set the current font.  Fonts can be GD::Font objects, TrueType font file paths, or fontconfig
           font patterns like "Times:italic" (see fontconfig). The latter feature requires  that  you  have  the
           fontconfig library installed and are using libgd version 2.0.33 or higher.

           As  a  shortcut,  you  may  pass  two  arguments to set the font and the fontsize simultaneously. The
           fontsize is only valid when drawing with TrueType fonts.

       $size = $img-&gt;fontsize([$newfontsize])
           Get or set the current font size.  This is only valid for TrueType fonts.

       $size = $img-&gt;penSize([$newpensize])
           Get or set the current pen width for use during line drawing operations.

       $angle = $img-&gt;angle([$newangle])
           Set the current angle for use when calling <b>line()</b> or <b>move()</b> with a single argument.

           Here is an example of using <b>turn()</b> and <b>angle()</b> together to draw an octagon.  The first line drawn  is
           the downward-slanting top right edge.  The last line drawn is the horizontal top of the octagon.

             $img-&gt;moveTo(200,50);
             $img-&gt;<a href="../man0/angle.0.html">angle</a>(0);
             $img-&gt;turn(360/8);
             for (1..8) { $img-&gt;<a href="../man50/line.50.html">line</a>(50) }

       $angle = $img-&gt;turn([$newangle])
           Get  or  set  the current angle to turn prior to drawing lines.  This value is only used when calling
           <b>line()</b> or <b>move()</b> with a single argument.  The turning angle will be applied to each call to <b>line()</b> or
           <b>move()</b> just before the actual drawing occurs.

           Angles are in degrees.  Positive values turn the angle clockwise.

       $color = $img-&gt;fgcolor([$newcolor])
           Get or set the pen's foreground color.  The current pen color can be set  by  (1)  using  an  (r,g,b)
           triple;  (2) using a previously-allocated color from the GD palette; or (3) by using a symbolic color
           name such as "chartreuse."  The list of color names can be obtained using <b>color_names()</b>. The  special
           color name 'transparent' will create a completely transparent color.

       $color = $img-&gt;bgcolor([$newcolor])
           Get  or  set  the  pen's  background color.  The current pen color can be set by (1) using an (r,g,b)
           triple; (2) using a previously-allocated color from the GD palette; or (3) by using a symbolic  color
           name  such as "chartreuse."  The list of color names can be obtained using <b>color_names()</b>. The special
           color name 'transparent' will create a completely transparent color.

       $index = $img-&gt;translate_color(@args)
           Translates a color into a GD palette or TrueColor index.  You may pass either an (r,g,b) triple or  a
           symbolic color name. If you pass a previously-allocated index, the method will return it unchanged.

       $index = $img-&gt;alphaColor(@args,$alpha)
           Creates  an alpha color.  You may pass either an (r,g,b) triple or a symbolic color name, followed by
           an integer indicating its opacity. The opacity value ranges from  0  (fully  opaque)  to  127  (fully
           transparent).

       @names = GD::Simple-&gt;color_names
       $translate_table = GD::Simple-&gt;color_names
           Called  in  a list context, <b>color_names()</b> returns the list of symbolic color names recognized by this
           module.  Called in a scalar context, the method returns a hash reference in which the  keys  are  the
           color names and the values are array references containing [r,g,b] triples.

       $gd = $img-&gt;gd
           Return  the  internal  GD::Image object.  Usually you will not need to call this since all GD methods
           are automatically referred to this object.

       ($red,$green,$blue) = GD::Simple-&gt;HSVtoRGB($hue,$saturation,$value)
           Convert a Hue/Saturation/Value (HSV) color into an RGB triple. The  hue,  saturation  and  value  are
           integers from 0 to 255.

       ($hue,$saturation,$value) = GD::Simple-&gt;RGBtoHSV($red,$green,$blue)
           Convert  a  Red/Green/Blue  (RGB) value into a Hue/Saturation/Value (HSV) triple. The hue, saturation
           and value are integers from 0 to 255.
