</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       HTTP::Server::Simple::CGI - CGI.pm-style version of HTTP::Server::Simple

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       HTTP::Server::Simple was already simple, but some smart-ass pointed out that there is no CGI in HTTP, and
       so this module was born to isolate the CGI.pm-related parts of this handler.

   <b>accept_hook</b>
       The accept_hook in this sub-class clears the environment to the start-up state.

   <b>post_setup_hook</b>
       Initializes the global CGI object, as well as other environment settings.

   <b>cgi_class</b> <b>[Classname]</b>
       Gets or sets the class to use for creating the $cgi object passed to "handle_request".

       Called with a single argument, it sets the coderef. Called with no arguments, it returns this field's
       current value.

       To provide an initialization subroutine to be run in the post_setup_hook, see "cgi_init".

       e.g.

           $server-&gt;cgi_class('CGI');

           $server-&gt;cgi_init(sub {
               require CGI;
               CGI::initialize_globals();
           });

       or, if you want to use CGI::Simple,

           $server-&gt;cgi_class('CGI::Simple');
           $server-&gt;cgi_init(sub {
               require CGI::Simple;
           });

   <b>cgi_init</b> <b>[CODEREF]</b>
       A coderef to run in the post_setup_hook.

       Called with a single argument, it sets the coderef. Called with no arguments, it returns this field's
       current value.

   <b>setup</b>
       This method sets up CGI environment variables based on various meta-headers, like the protocol, remote
       host name, request path, etc.

       See the docs in HTTP::Server::Simple for more detail.

   <b>handle_request</b> <b>CGI</b>
       This routine is called whenever your server gets a request it can handle.

       It's called with a CGI object that's been pre-initialized.  You want to override this method in your
       subclass

   <b>handler</b>
       Handler implemented as part of HTTP::Server::Simple API
