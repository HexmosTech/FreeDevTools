               # only affects clone
               $clone-&gt;set( "Foo", "Buster" );

               # save the config to a single file
               $clone-&gt;save( "configrc" )

               # save the config to a single file, but only with
               # certain directives
               $clone-&gt;save( "configrc" =&gt; [qw(Foo Bar)] )

               # save to multiple configuration files
               $clone-&gt;save(
                       "configrc" =&gt; [qw(Foo Bar)],
                       "global"   =&gt; [qw(Baz Quux)],
                       );

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       "ConfigReader::Simple" reads and parses simple configuration files.  It is designed to be smaller and
       simpler than the "ConfigReader" module and is more suited to simple configuration files.

   <b>The</b> <b>configuration</b> <b>file</b> <b>format</b>
       The configuration file uses a line-oriented format, meaning that the directives do not have containers.
       The values can be split across lines with a continuation character, but for the most part everything ends
       up on the same line.

       The first group of non-whitespace characters is the "directive", or the name of the configuration item.
       The linear whitespace after that separates the directive from the "value", which is the rest of the line,
       including any other whitespace.

       In this example, the directive is "Camel" and the value is "Dromedary".

               Camel Dromedary

       Optionally, you can use a equal sign to separate the directive from the value.

               Camel=Dromedary

       The equal sign can also have whitespace on either or both sides.

               Camel = Dromedary
               Camel= Dromedary

       In the next example, the directive is "Llama" and the value is "Live from Peru"

               Llama Live from Peru

       This is the same, to "ConfigReader::Simple", as the following which has more whitespace between the
       directive and the value.

               Llama     Live from Peru

       You can also enclose the value in single or double quotes.

               Llama "Live from Peru"
               Llama 'Live from Peru'
               Llama='Live from Peru'

       In some cases you may want to split the logical line across two lines, perhaps to see it better in a
       terminal window.  For that, use a \ followed only by whitespace.  To split the last entry across two
       lines, we use the \ at the end of the line. These three entries are the same:

               Llama Live from Peru

               Llama Live from \
               Peru

               Llama Live \
               from \
               Peru

       If a line is only whitespace, or the first non-whitespace character is a #, the Perl comment character,
       "ConfigReader::Simple" ignores the line unless it is the continuation of the previous line.

   <b>Methods</b>
       new ( FILENAME, DIRECTIVES )
           Creates a "ConfigReader::Simple" object.

           "FILENAME"  tells the instance where to look for the configuration file. If FILENAME cannot be found,
           an error message for the file is added to the %ERROR hash with the FILENAME as a key, and a  combined
           error message appears in $ERROR.

           "DIRECTIVES"  is an optional argument and is a reference to an array. Each member of the array should
           contain one valid directive. A directive is the name of a key that must occur  in  the  configuration
           file.  If  it  is  not  found,  the method croaks. The directive list may contain all the keys in the
           configuration file, a sub set of keys or no keys at all.

           The "new" method is really a wrapper around "new_multiple".

       new_multiple( Files =&gt; ARRAY_REF, Keys =&gt; ARRAY_REF )
           Create a configuration object from several files listed in the anonymous array value for the  "Files"
           key.   The  module  reads  the  files  in the same order that they appear in the array.  Later values
           override earlier ones.  This allows you to specify global configurations which you may override  with
           more specific ones:

                   ConfigReader::Simple-&gt;new_multiple(
                           Files =&gt; [ qw( /etc/config /usr/local/etc/config /home/usr/config ) ],
                           );

           This function croaks if the values are not array references.

           If  this  method  cannot read a file, an error message for that file is added to the %ERROR hash with
           the filename as a key, and a combined error message  appears  in  $ERROR.   Processing  the  list  of
           filenames  continues if a file cannot be found, which may produced undesired results. You can disable
           this feature by setting the $ConfigReader::Simple::Die variable to a true value.

       new_string( Strings =&gt; ARRAY_REF, Keys =&gt; ARRAY_REF )
           Create a configuration object from several strings listed  in  the  anonymous  array  value  for  the
           "Strings"  key.  The module reads the strings in the same order that they appear in the array.  Later
           values override earlier ones.  This allows  you  to  specify  global  configurations  which  you  may
           override with more specific ones:

                   ConfigReader::Simple-&gt;new_strings(
                           Strings =&gt; [ \$global, \$local ],
                           );

           This function croaks if the values are not array references.

       add_config_file( FILENAME )
           Parse  another  configuration  file  and  add its directives to the current configuration object. Any
           directives already defined will be replaced with the new values found in FILENAME.

       files
           Return the list of configuration files associated with this object. The order of the return values is
           the order of parsing, so the first value is the first file parsed (and subsequent files may mask it).

       new_from_prototype(
           Create a clone object. This is the same thing as calling <b>clone()</b>.

       parse( FILENAME )
           This does the actual work.

           This is automatically called from new(), although you can reparse the configuration file  by  calling
           parse() again.

       parse_string( SCALAR_REF )
           Parses the string inside the reference SCALAR_REF just as if it found it in a file.

       get( DIRECTIVE )
           Returns  the  parsed  value  for  that  directive.   For directives which did not have a value in the
           configuration file, "get" returns the empty string.

       set( DIRECTIVE, VALUE )
           Sets the value for DIRECTIVE to VALUE.  The  DIRECTIVE  need  not  already  exist.   This  overwrites
           previous values.

           The  VALUE  must  be  a  simple  scalar.  It cannot be a reference.  If the VALUE is a reference, the
           function prints a warning and returns false.

       unset( DIRECTIVE )
           Remove the value from DIRECTIVE, which will still exist.  It's value is undef.  If the DIRECTIVE does
           not exist, it will not be created.  Returns FALSE if the DIRECTIVE does not already exist,  and  TRUE
           otherwise.

       remove( DIRECTIVE )
           Remove the DIRECTIVE. Returns TRUE is DIRECTIVE existed and FALSE otherwise.

       <b>directives()</b>
           Returns  a  list  of  all of the directive names found in the configuration file. The keys are sorted
           ASCII-betically.

       exists( DIRECTIVE )
           Return TRUE if the specified directive exists, and FALSE otherwise.

       clone
           Return a copy of the object.  The new object is distinct from the original so you can make changes to
           the new object without affecting the old one.

       save( FILENAME [ =&gt; ARRAY_REF [, FILENAME =&gt; ARRAY_REF ] ] );
           The save method works in three ways, depending on the argument list.

           With a single argument, the save function attempts to save all of the field-value pairs of the object
           to the file named by the argument.

                   $clone-&gt;save( "configrc" );

           With two arguments, the method expects the second argument to be an array reference which  lists  the
           directives to save in the file.

                   $clone-&gt;save( "configrc" =&gt; [qw(Foo Bar)] );

           With  more  than two arguments, the method expects filename-list pairs.  The method will save in each
           file the values in their respective array references.

                   $clone-&gt;save(
                           "configrc" =&gt; [qw(Foo Bar)],
                           "global"   =&gt; [qw(Baz Quux)],
                           );

           In the last two cases, the method checks that the value for each pair is an array reference before it
           affects any files.  It croaks if any value is not an array reference.

           Once the method starts writing files, it tries to write all of the specified files. Even if it has  a
           problem  with one of them, it continues onto the next one.  The method does not necessarily write the
           files in the order they appear in the argument list, and it does not check if you specified the  same
           file twice.

   <b>Package</b> <b>variables</b>
       $Die - DEPRECATED
           If set to a true value, all errors are fatal.

       $ERROR
           The last error message.

       %ERROR
           The  error  messages  from  unreadable  files.   The  key  is the filename and the value is the error
           message.

       $Warn - DEPRECATED
           If set to a true value, methods may output warnings.

</pre><h4><b>LIMITATIONS/BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Directives are case-sensitive.

       If a directive is repeated, the first instance will silently be ignored.

</pre><h4><b>CREDITS</b></h4><pre>
