</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       PDL can plot through a plethora of external plotting modules.  Each module tends to be less widely
       available than Perl itself, and to require an additional step or two to install.  For simple applications
       ("throw up an image on the screen", or "plot a curve") it is useful to have a subset of all plotting
       capability available in a backend-independent layer.  PDL::Graphics::Simple provides that capability.

       PDL::Graphics::Simple implements all the functionality used in the PDL::Book examples, with identical
       syntax.  It also generalizes that syntax - you can use ::Simple graphics, with slight syntactical
       differences, in the same manner that you would use any of the engine modules.  See the Examples below for
       details.

       The plot you get will always be what you asked for, regardless of which plotting engine you have
       installed on your system.

       Only a small subset of PDL's complete graphics functionality is supported -- each individual plotting
       module has unique advantages and functionality that are beyond what PDL::Graphics::Simple can do.  Only
       2-D plotting is supported.  For 3-D plotting, use PDL::Graphics::Gnuplot or PDL::Graphics::TriD directly.

       When plotting to a file, the file output is not guaranteed to be present until the plot object is
       destroyed (e.g. by being undefed or going out of scope).

</pre><h4><b>STATE</b> <b>OF</b> <b>DEVELOPMENT</b></h4><pre>
       PDL::Graphics::Simple currently supports most of the planned functionality.  It is being released as a
       beta test to determine if it meets users' needs and gain feedback on the API -- so please give feedback!

</pre><h4><b>SUPPORTED</b> <b>GRAPHICS</b> <b>ENGINES</b></h4><pre>
       PDL::Graphics::Simple includes support for the following graphics engines.  Additional driver modules can
       be loaded dynamically; see "register", below.  Each of the engines has unique capabilities and flavor
       that are not captured in PDL::Graphics::Simple - you are encouraged to look at the individual modules for
       more capability!

       •  Gnuplot (via PDL::Graphics::Gnuplot)

          Gnuplot  is  an  extremely richly featured plotting package that offers markup, rich text control, RGB
          color, and 2-D and 3-D plotting.  Its output  is  publication  quality.   It  is  supported  on  POSIX
          systems, MacOS, and Microsoft Windows, and is available from most package managers.

       •  PGPLOT  (via PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT::Window)

          PGPLOT  is  venerable  and  nearly  as fully featured as Gnuplot for 2-D plotting.  It lacks RGB color
          output. It does have rich text control, but uses simple plotter fonts that are  generated  internally.
          It is supported on MacOS and POSIX, but is not as widely available as Gnuplot.

       •  PLplot (via PDL::Graphics::PLplot)

          PLplot is a moderately full featured plotting package that generates publication quality output with a
          simple high-level interface.  It is supported on MacOS and POSIX.

       •  Prima (via PDL::Graphics::Prima)

          Prima  is  based around a widget paradigm that enables complex interaction with data in real-time, and
          it is highly optimized for that application.  It is not as mature as the other platforms, particularly
          for static plot generation to files.  This means that  PDL::Graphics::Simple  does  not  play  to  its
          considerable  strengths,  although  Prima is serviceable and fast in this application.  Please run the
          Prima demo in the perldl shell for a better sample of Prima's capabilities.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       PDL::Graphics::Simple can be called using plot-atomic or curve-atomic plotting  styles,  using  a  pidgin
       form of calls to any of the main modules.  The examples are divided into Book-like (very simple), PGPLOT-
       like (curve-atomic), and Gnuplot-like (plot-atomic) cases.

       There  are  three  main  styles  of  interaction  with  plot objects that PDL::Graphics::Simple supports,
       reflective of the pre-existing modules' styles of interaction.  You can mix-and-match them to match  your
       particular needs and coding style.  Here are examples showing convenient ways to call the code.

   <b>First</b> <b>steps</b> <b>(non-object-oriented)</b>
       For  the very simplest actions there are non-object-oriented shortcuts.  Here are some examples of simple
       tasks, including axis labels and plot titles.  These non-object-oriented shortcuts are useful for display
       with the default window size.  They make use of a package-global plot object.

       The non-object interface will keep using the last plot engine you used successfully.  On first start, you
       can specify an engine with the environment variable "PDL_SIMPLE_ENGINE". As of 1.011, only that  will  be
       tried, but if you didn't specify one, all known engines are tried in alphabetical order until one works.

       The value of "PDL_SIMPLE_ENGINE" should be the "shortname" of the engine, currently:

       "gnuplot"
       "plplot"
       "pgplot"
       "prima"
       •  Load module and create line plots

           use PDL::Graphics::Simple;
           $x = <a href="../man51/xvals.51.html">xvals</a>(51)/5;
           $y = $x**3;

           $y-&gt;line;
           line( $x, $y );
           line( $x, $y, {title=&gt;"My plot", ylabel=&gt; "Ordinate", xlabel=&gt;"Abscissa"} );

       •  Bin plots

           $y-&gt;bins;
           bins($y, {title=&gt;"Bin plot", xl=&gt;"Bin number", yl=&gt;"Count"} );

       •  Point plots

           $y-&gt;points;
           points($y, {title=&gt;"Points plot"});

       •  Logarithmic scaling

           line( $y, { log=&gt;'y' } );    # semilog
           line( $y, { log=&gt;'xy' } );   # log-log

       •  Image display

           $im = 10 * sin(rvals(101,101)) / (10 + rvals(101,101));
           imag $im;          # Display image
           imag $im, 0, 1;    # Set lower/upper color range

       •  Overlays

           points($x, $y, {logx=&gt;1});
           hold;
           line($x, sqrt($y)*10);
           release;

       •  Justify aspect ratio

           imag $im, {justify=&gt;1}
           points($x, $y, {justify=&gt;1});

       •  Erase/delete the plot window

           erase();

   <b>Simple</b> <b>object-oriented</b> <b>plotting</b>
       More  functionality  is  accessible  through direct use of the PDL::Graphics::Simple object.  You can set
       plot size, direct plots to files, and set up multi-panel plots.

       The constructor accepts window configuration options that set the plotting environment,  including  size,
       driving plot engine, output, and multiple panels in a single window.

       For interactive/display plots, the plot is rendered immediately, and lasts until the object is destroyed.
       For file plots, the file is not guaranteed to exist and be correct until the object is destroyed.

       The  basic plotting method is "plot".  "plot" accepts a collection of arguments that describe one or more
       "curves" (or datasets) to plot, followed by an optional plot option hash that affects  the  entire  plot.
       Overplotting  is  implemented  via  plot  option,  via  a  held/released  state (as in PGPLOT), and via a
       convenience method "oplot" that causes the current plot to be overplotted on the previous one.

       Plot style (line/points/bins/etc.) is selected via the "with" curve option.  Several convenience  methods
       exist to create plots in the various styles.

       •  Load module and create basic objects

           use PDL::Graphics::Simple;
           $x = <a href="../man51/xvals.51.html">xvals</a>(51)/5;
           $y = $x**3;

           $win = pgswin();                       # plot to a default-shape window
           $win = pgswin( size=&gt;[4,3] );          # size is given in inches by default
           $win = pgswin( size=&gt;[10,5,'cm'] );    # You can feed in other units too
           $win = pgswin( out=&gt;'plot.ps' );       # Plot to a file (type is via suffix)
           $win = pgswin( engine=&gt;'gnuplot' );    # Pick a particular plotting engine
           $win = pgswin( multi=&gt;[2,2] );         # Set up for a 2x2 4-panel plot

       •  Simple plots with "plot"

           $win-&gt;plot( with=&gt;'line', $x, $y, {title=&gt;"Simple line plot"} );
           $win-&gt;plot( with=&gt;'errorbars', $x, $y, sqrt($y), {title=&gt;"Error bars"} );
           $win-&gt;plot( with=&gt;'circles', $x, $y, sin($x)**2 );

       •  Plot overlays

           # All at once
           $win-&gt;plot( with=&gt;'line', $x, $y,   with=&gt;'circles', $x, $y/2, sqrt($y)  );

           # Using oplot (IDL-style; PLplot-style)
           $win-&gt;plot(  with=&gt;'line', $x, $y );
           $win-&gt;oplot( with=&gt;'circles', $x, $y/2, sqrt($y) );

           # Using object state (PGPLOT-style)
           $win-&gt;line(  $x, $y );
           $win-&gt;hold;
           $win-&gt;circles( $x, $y/2, sqrt($y) );
           $win-&gt;release;

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>show</b>
        PDL::Graphics::Simple::show

       "show" lists the supported engines and a one-line synopsis of each.

   <b>pgswin</b> <b>-</b> <b>exported</b> <b>constructor</b>
        $w = pgswin( %opts );

       "pgswin"  is  a  constructor that is exported by default into the using package. Calling pgswin(%opts) is
       exactly the same as calling "PDL::Graphics::Simple-&gt;new(%opts)".

   <b>new</b>
        $w = PDL::Graphics::Simple-&gt;new( %opts );

       "new" is the main constructor for PDL::Graphics::Simple.  It accepts a list of options about the type  of
       window you want:

       engine
          If  specified,  this  must be one of the supported plotting engines.  You can use a module name or the
          shortened name.  If you don't give one, the constructor will try the last one you used, or  else  scan
          through  existing  modules  and  pick  one  that  seems  to work.  It will first check the environment
          variable "PDL_SIMPLE_ENGINE", and as of 1.011, only that will be tried, but if you didn't specify one,
          all known engines are tried in alphabetical order until one works.

       size
          This is a window size as an ARRAY ref containing [width, height, units].  If no units  are  specified,
          the  default  is  "inches".  Accepted units are "in","pt","px","mm", and "cm". The conversion used for
          pixels is 100 px/inch.

       type
          This describes the kind of plot to create, and should be either "file" or "interactive" - though  only
          the leading character is checked.  If you don't specify either "type" or "output" (below), the default
          is "interactive". If you specify only "output", the default is "file".

       output
          This  should  be  a  window  number or name for interactive plots, or a file name for file plots.  The
          default file name is "plot.png" in the current working directory.   Individual  plotting  modules  all
          support at least '.png', '.pdf', and '.ps' -- via format conversion if necessary.  Most other standard
          file types are supported but are not guaranteed to work.

       multi
          This  enables  plotting  multiple plots on a single screen.  You feed in a single array ref containing
          (nx, ny).  Subsequent calls to plot send graphics to subsequent locations on the window.  The ordering
          is always horizontal first, and left-to-right, top-to-bottom.

          <b>NOTE</b> for multiplotting: "oplot" does not work and will  cause  an  exception.  This  is  a  limitation
          imposed by Gnuplot.

   <b>plot</b>
        $w = PDL::Graphics::Simple-&gt;new( %opts );
        $w-&gt;plot($data);

       "plot"  plots zero or more traces of data on a graph.  It accepts two kinds of options: plot options that
       affect the whole plot, and curve options that affect each curve.  The arguments are divided  into  "curve
       blocks", each of which contains a curve options hash followed by data.

       If  the  last  argument  is  a  hash  ref, it is always treated as plot options.  If the first and second
       arguments are both hash refs, then the first argument is treated as plot options and the second as  curve
       options for the first curve block.

       <u>Plot</u> <u>options:</u>

       oplot
          If this is set, then the plot overplots a previous plot.

       title
          If this is set, it is a title for the plot as a whole.

       xlabel
          If this is set, it is a title for the X axis.

       ylabel
          If this is set, it is a title for the Y axis.

       xrange
          If  this is set, it is a two-element ARRAY ref containing a range for the X axis.  If it is clear, the
          axis is autoscaled.

       yrange
          If this is set, it is a two-element ARRAY ref containing a range for the Y axis.  If it is clear,  the
          axis is autoscaled.

       logaxis
          This  should  be  empty,  "x",  "y",  or  "xy"  (case  and  order insensitive).  Named axes are scaled
          logarithmically.

       crange
          If this is set, it is a two-element ARRAY ref containing a range for color values, full black to  full
          white.  If it is clear, the engine or plot module is responsible for setting the range.

       wedge
          If  this  is  set, then image plots get a scientific colorbar on the right side of the plot.  (You can
          also say "colorbar", "colorbox", or "cb" if you're more familiar with Gnuplot).

       justify
          If this is set to a true value, then the screen aspect ratio is adjusted to keep the Y axis and X axis
          scales equal -- so circles appear circular, and squares appear square.

       legend (EXPERIMENTAL)
          The "legend" plot option is intended for full support but it is currently  experimental:   it  is  not
          fully  implemented  in all the engines, and implementation is more variable than one would like in the
          engines that do support it.

          This controls whether and where a plot legend  should  be  placed.   If  you  set  it,  you  supply  a
          combination  of 't','b','c','l', and 'r': indicating top, bottom, center, left, right position for the
          plot legend.  For example, 'tl' for top left, 'tc' for center top, 'c' or 'cc' for  dead  center.   If
          left  unset,  no legend will be plotted.  If you set it but don't specify a position (or part of one),
          it defaults to top and left.

          If you supply even one 'key' curve option in the curves, legend defaults to the value 'tl' if it isn't
          specified.

       <u>Curve</u> <u>options:</u>

       with
          This names the type of curve to be plotted.  See below for supported curve types.

       key
          This gives a name for the following curve, to be placed in a master plot legend.  If you don't specify
          a name but do call for a legend, the curve will be named with the plot type and number (e.g. "line  3"
          or "points 4").

       width
          This  lets  you  specify the width of the line, as a multiplier on the standard width the engine uses.
          That lets you pick normal-width or extra-bold lines for any given curve.  The option  takes  a  single
          positive natural number.

       style
          You  can  specify  the line style in a very limited way -- as a style number supported by the backend.
          The styles are generally defined by a mix of color and dash pattern, but the particular color and dash
          pattern depend on the engine in use. The first 30 styles are guaranteed to be distinguishable. This is
          useful to produce, e.g., multiple traces with the same style. 0 is a valid value.

       <u>Curve</u> <u>types</u> <u>supported</u>

       points
          This is a simple point plot.  It takes 1 or 2 columns of data.

       lines
          This is a simple line plot. It takes 1 or 2 columns of data.

       bins
          Stepwise line plot, with the steps centered on each X value.  1 or 2 columns.

       errorbars
          Simple points-with-errorbar plot, with centered errorbars.  It takes 2 or  3  columns,  and  the  last
          column is the absolute size of the errorbar (which is centered on the data point).

       limitbars
          Simple  points-with-errorbar  plot,  with asymmetric errorbars.  It takes 3 or 4 columns, and the last
          two columns are the absolute low and high values of the errorbar around each point (specified relative
          to the origin, not relative to the data point value).

       circles
          Plot unfilled circles.  Requires 2 or 3 columns of data; the last column is the radius of each circle.
          The circles are circular in scientific coordinates, not necessarily in screen coordinates (unless  you
          specify the "justify" plot option).

       image
          This is a monochrome or RGB image.  It takes a 2-D or 3-D array of values, as (width x height x color-
          index).   Images  are  displayed  in  a  sepiatone  color  scale  that enhances contrast and preserves
          intensity when converted to grayscale.  If you use the convenience routines ("image" or  "imag"),  the
          "justify"  plot  option  defaults to 1 -- so the image will be displayed with square pixel aspect.  If
          you use "plot(with=&gt;'image' ...)", "justify" defaults to 0 and you will have to set  it  if  you  want
          square pixels.

          For  RGB images, the numerical values need to be in the range 0-255, as they are interpreted as 8 bits
          per plane colour values. E.g.:

            $w = pgswin(); # plot to a default-shape window
            $w-&gt;image( pdl(xvals(9,9),yvals(9,9),rvals(9,9))*20 );

            # or, from an image on disk:
            $image_data = rpic( 'my-image.png' )-&gt;mv(0,-1); # need RGB 3-dim last
            $w-&gt;image( $image_data );

          If you have a 2-D field of values that you would like to see with a heatmap:

            use PDL::Graphics::ColorSpace;
            sub as_heatmap {
              my ($d) = @_;
              my $max = $d-&gt;max;
              die "as_heatmap: can't work if max == 0" if $max == 0;
              $d /= $max; # negative OK
              my $hue   = (1 - $d)*240;
              $d = cat($hue, <a href="../man1/pdl.1.html">pdl</a>(1), <a href="../man1/pdl.1.html">pdl</a>(1));
              (hsv_to_rgb($d-&gt;mv(-1,0)) * 255)-&gt;byte-&gt;mv(0,-1);
            }
            $w-&gt;image( as_heatmap(rvals 300,300) );

       contours
          As of 1.012. Draws contours. Takes a 2-D array of values, as (width x height), and  optionally  a  1-D
          vector of contour values.

       fits
          As of 1.012. Displays an image from an ndarray with a FITS header.  Uses "CUNIT[12]" etc to make X &amp; Y
          axes including labels.

       polylines
          As  of 1.012. Draws polylines, with 2 arguments ($xy, $pen).  The "pen" has value 0 for the last point
          in that polyline.

            use PDL::Transform::Cartography;
            use PDL::Graphics::Simple qw(pgswin);
            $coast = earth_coast()-&gt;glue( 1, scalar graticule(15,1) );
            $w = pgswin();
            $w-&gt;plot(with =&gt; 'polylines', $coast-&gt;clean_lines);

       labels
          This places text annotations on the plot.  It requires three input arguments: the X and Y  location(s)
          as  PDLs,  and  the  label(s)  as  a  list  ref.   The labels are normally left-justified, but you can
          explicitly set the alignment for each one by beginning the label with "&lt;" for left "|" for center, and
          "&gt;" for right justification, or a single " " to denote default justification (left).

   <b>oplot</b>
        $w = PDL::Graphics::Simple-&gt;new( %opts );
        $w-&gt;plot($data);
        $w-&gt;oplot($more_data);

       "oplot" is a convenience interface.  It is exactly equivalent to "plot" except it sets  the  plot  option
       "oplot", so that the plot will be overlain on the previous one.

   <b>line,</b> <b>points,</b> <b>bins,</b> <b>image,</b> <b>imag,</b> <b>cont</b>
        # Object-oriented convenience
        $w = PDL::Graphics::Simple-&gt;new( % opts );
        $w-&gt;line($data);

        # Very Lazy Convenience
        $a = <a href="../man50/xvals.50.html">xvals</a>(50);
        lines $a;
        $im = sin(rvals(100,100)/3);
        imag $im;
        imag $im, 0, 1, {title=&gt;"Bullseye?", j=&gt;1};

       "line",  "points",  and "image" are convenience interfaces.  They are exactly equivalent to "plot" except
       that they set the default "with" curve option to the appropriate plot type.

       "imag" is even more DWIMMy for PGPLOT users or  PDL  Book  readers:  it  accepts  up  to  three  non-hash
       arguments  at  the  start  of  the  argument  list.   The second and third are taken to be values for the
       "crange" plot option.

       "cont" resembles the PGPLOT function.

   <b>erase</b>
        use PDL::Graphics::Simple qw/erase hold release/;
        line <a href="../man10/xvals.10.html">xvals</a>(10), <a href="../man10/xvals.10.html">xvals</a>(10)**2 ;
        sleep 5;
        erase;

       "erase" removes a global plot window.  It should not be called as a method.   To  remove  a  plot  window
       contained in a variable, undefine it.

   <b>hold</b>
        use PDL::Graphics::Simple;
        line <a href="../man10/xvals.10.html">xvals</a>(10);
        hold;
        line <a href="../man10/xvals.10.html">xvals</a>(10)**0.5;

       Causes  subsequent  plots to be overplotted on any existing one.  Called as a function with no arguments,
       "hold" applies to the global object.  Called as an object method, it applies to the object.

   <b>release</b>
        use PDL::Graphics::Simple;
        line <a href="../man10/xvals.10.html">xvals</a>(10);
        hold;
        line <a href="../man10/xvals.10.html">xvals</a>(10)**0.5;
        release;
        line <a href="../man10/xvals.10.html">xvals</a>(10)**0.5;

       Releases a hold placed by "hold".

   <b>register</b>
        PDL::Graphics::Simple::register( \%description );

       This is the registration mechanism for new driver methods for "PDL::Graphics::Simple".  Compliant drivers
       should announce themselves at compile time by calling "register",  passing  a  hash  ref  containing  the
       following keys:

       shortname
           This is the short name of the engine, by which users refer to it colloquially.

       module
           This is the fully qualified package name of the module itself.

       engine
           This is the fully qualified package name of the Perl API for the graphics engine.

       synopsis
           This is a brief string describing the backend

       pgs_api_version
           This  is  a  one-period  version  number  of  PDL::Graphics::Simple against which the module has been
           tested.    A    warning    will    be    thrown    if    the    version    isn't    the    same    as
           $PDL::Graphics::Simple::API_VERSION.

           That  value will only change when the API changes, allowing the modules to be released independently,
           rather than with every version of PDL::Graphics::Simple as up to 1.010.

</pre><h4><b>IMPLEMENTATION</b></h4><pre>
       PDL::Graphics::Simple defines an object that represents a plotting window/interface.  When you  construct
       the  object, you can either specify a backend or allow PDL::Graphics::Simple to find a backend that seems
       to work on your system.  Subsequent plotting commands are translated and passed through to  that  working
       plotting module.

       PDL::Graphics::Simple  calls are dispatched in a two-step process. The main module curries the arguments,
       parsing them into a regularized form and carrying out DWIM optimizations. The regularized  arguments  are
       passed to implementation classes that translate them into the APIs of their respective plot engines.  The
       classes  are  very simple and implement only a few methods, outlined below.  They are intended only to be
       called by the PDL::Graphics::Simple driver, which limits the need for argument processing, currying,  and
       parsing. The classes are thus responsible only for converting the regularized parameters to plot calls in
       the form expected by their corresponding plot modules.

       PDL::Graphics::Simple  works  through  a  call-and-dispatch  system  rather than taking full advantage of
       inheritance.  That is for two reasons: (1) it makes central control mildly easier  going  forward,  since
       calls  are  dispatched through the main module; and (2) it makes the non-object-oriented interface easier
       to implement since the main interface modules are in one place and can access the global object easily.

   <b>Interface</b> <b>class</b> <b>methods</b>
       Each interface module supports the following methods:

       <u>check</u>

       "check" attempts to load the relevant engine module  and  test  that  it  is  working.   In  addition  to
       returning  a  boolean  value  indicating success if true, it registers its success or failure in the main
       $mods hash, under the "ok" flag.  If there is a failure that generates an error  message,  the  error  is
       logged under the "msg" flag.

       "check"  accepts  one  parameter,  "force".   If  it is missing or false, and "ok" is defined, check just
       echoes the prior result.  If it is true, then check actually checks the status  regardless  of  the  "ok"
       flag.

       <u>new</u>

       "new" creates and returns an appropriate plot object, or dies on failure.

       Each   "new"   method   should   accept  the  following  options,  defined  as  in  the  description  for
       PDL::Graphics::Simple::new (above).  There is no need to set default values as all  arguments  should  be
       set to reasonable values by the superclass.

       For  file output, the method should autodetect file type by dot-suffix.  At least ".png" and ".ps" should
       be supported.

       Required options: "size", "type", "output", "multi".

       <u>plot</u>

       "plot" generates a plot.  It should accept a standardized collection  of  options  as  generated  by  the
       PDL::Graphics::Simple  plot  method:  standard  plot  options  as a hash ref, followed by a list of curve
       blocks.  It should render either a full-sized plot that fills the plot window or, if the  object  "multi"
       option  was  set  on construction, the current subwindow.  For interactive plot types it should act as an
       atomic plot operation, displaying the complete plot.  For file plot  types  the  atomicity  is  not  well
       defined, since multiplot grids may be problematic, but the plot should be closed as soon as practical.

       The  plot  options  hash contains the plot options listed under "plot", above, plus one additional flag -
       "oplot" - that indicates the new data is to be overplotted on top of whatever is already present  in  the
       plotting  window.   All  options  are  present in the hash. The "title", "xlabel", "ylabel", and "legend"
       options default to undef, which indicates the corresponding plot feature should  not  be  rendered.   The
       "oplot",  "xrange",  "yrange",  "crange",  "wedge",  and "justify" parameters are always both present and
       defined.

       If the "oplot" plot option is set, then the plot should be overlain on a previous plot,  not  losing  any
       range settings, nor obeying any given.  <b>NOTE</b> that if any data given to the original plot or any overplots
       might  be  changed  before  plot updates happen, it is the user's responsibility to pass in copies, since
       some engines (Prima and Gnuplot) only store data by reference for  performance  reasons.   Otherwise  the
       module should display a fresh plot.

       Each  curve  block  consists  of  an  ARRAY ref with a hash in the 0 element and all required data in the
       following elements, one PDL per (ordinate/abscissa).  For 1-D plot types (like points and lines) the PDLs
       must be 1D.  For image plot types the lone PDL must be 2D (monochrome) or 3D(RGB).

       The hash in the curve block contains the curve options for that particular curve.  They are  all  set  to
       have  reasonable  default  values.  The values passed in are "with" and "key".  If the "legend" option is
       undefined, then the curve should not be placed into a plot legend (if present).

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       Setting some environment variables affects operation of the module:

   <b>PDL_SIMPLE_ENGINE</b>
       See "new".

   <b>PDL_SIMPLE_DEVICE</b>
       If this is a meaningful thing for the given engine, this value will be used instead of the driver  module
       guessing.

   <b>PDL_SIMPLE_OUTPUT</b>
       Overrides  passed-in arguments, to create the given file as output.  If it contains %d, then with Gnuplot
       that will be replaced with an increasing number (an amazing PDL::Graphics::Gnuplot feature).

</pre><h4><b>TO-DO</b></h4><pre>
       Deal with legend generation.  In particular: adding legends with  multi-call  protocols  is  awkward  and
       leads to many edge cases in the internal protocol.  This needs more thought.
