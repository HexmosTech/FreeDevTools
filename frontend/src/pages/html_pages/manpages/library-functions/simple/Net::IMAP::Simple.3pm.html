</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Net::IMAP::Simple - Perl extension for simple IMAP account handling.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use strict;
           use warnings;
           use Net::IMAP::Simple;
           use Email::Simple;

           # Create the object
           my $imap = Net::IMAP::Simple-&gt;new('imap.example.com') ||
              die "Unable to connect to IMAP: $Net::IMAP::Simple::errstr\n";

           # Log on
           if(!$imap-&gt;login('user','pass')){
               print STDERR "Login failed: " . $imap-&gt;errstr . "\n";

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module is a simple way to access IMAP accounts.

</pre><h4><b>OBJECT</b> <b>CREATION</b> <b>METHOD</b></h4><pre>
           my $imap = Net::IMAP::Simple-&gt;new( $server [ :port ]);

           # OR

           my $imap = Net::IMAP::Simple-&gt;new( $server [, option_name =&gt; option_value ] );

   <b>new</b>
       This class method constructs a new Net::IMAP::Simple object. It takes one required parameter which is the
       server to connect to, and additional optional parameters.

       The server parameter may specify just the server, or both the server and port number. To specify an
       alternate port, separate it from the server with a colon (":"), "example.com:5143".

       On success an object is returned. On failure, nothing is returned and an error message is set to
       $Net::IMAP::Simple.

       See "PREAUTH" below for a special hostname invocation that doesn't use Sockets (internally).

       Options are provided as a hash to "new()":

       port =&gt; int
           Assign the port number (default: 143)

       timeout =&gt; int (default: 90)
           Connection timeout in seconds.

       retry =&gt; int (default: 1)
           Attempt to retry the connection attmpt (x) times before giving up

       retry_delay =&gt; int (default: 5)
           Wait (x) seconds before retrying a connection attempt

       use_v6 =&gt; BOOL
           If set to true, attempt to use IPv6 sockets rather than IPv4 sockets.

           This option requires the IO::Socket::INET6 module

       use_ssl =&gt; BOOL
           If set to true, attempt to use IO::Socket::SSL sockets rather than vanilla sockets.

           Note that no attempt is made to check the certificate validity by default.  This is terrible personal
           security but matches the previous behavior of this module.  Please consider using "find_ssl_defaults"
           below.

           This option requires the IO::Socket::SSL module

       ssl_version =&gt; version
           This  should  be  one or more of the following (space separated): SSLv3 SSLv2 TLSv1.  If you specify,
           for example, "SSLv3 SSLv2" then IO::Socket::SSL will attempt auto negotiation.  At the time  of  this
           writing,  the  default  string was v3/v2 auto negotiation -- it may have changed by the time you read
           this.

           Warning: setting this will also set "use_ssl".

       find_ssl_defaults =&gt; []
           Looks in some standard places for CA certificate libraries and  if  found  sets  reasonable  defaults
           along the lines of the following.

               ssl_options =&gt; [ SSL_ca_path =&gt; "<a href="file:/etc/ssl/certs/">/etc/ssl/certs/</a>",
                   SSL_verify_mode =&gt; IO::Socket::SSL::SSL_VERIFY_PEER() ]

           Warning: setting this will also set "use_ssl".

       ssl_options =&gt; []
           You may provide your own IO::Socket::SSL options if you desire to do so.  It is completely overridden
           by "find_ssl_defaults" above.

       bindaddr =&gt; str
           Assign a local address to bind

       use_select_cache =&gt; BOOL
           Enable "select()" caching internally

       select_cache_ttl =&gt; int
           The number of seconds to allow a select cache result live before running "$imap-&gt;select()" again.

       debug =&gt; BOOL | \*HANDLE | warn | file:name
           Enable  debugging  output. If "\*HANDLE" is a valid file handle, debugging will be written to it.  If
           it is the string "warn" then the debugging will be written using the warn command.  If it is a string
           of the form "file:name" then the named file will be opened for append and the debugs written  to  it.
           Otherwise debugging will be written to "STDOUT"

       readline_callback =&gt; CODE
           You  may  choose  to pass a callback function for the purpose of pre-processing lines before they are
           handed to the rest of the Net::IMAP::Simple internals.  This can be handy for animating a spinner  or
           modifying the IMAP behavior.

</pre><h4><b>PREAUTH</b></h4><pre>
       Rather  than  passing  a  port  number  and  issuing  a login, in some situations it may be convenient to
       authenticate with (for example) ssh and simply invoke (for example) dovecot by hand.

       If the server name starts with "cmd:", then Net::IMAP::Simple will issue the command rather than building
       sockets.  This is a typical setup:

           my $cmd = "ssh -C mailhost dovecot --exec-mail imap";
           my $imap = Net::IMAP::Simple-&gt;new("cmd:$cmd");
            # $imap-&gt;login(); ... don't need this

           my $number_of_messages = $imap-&gt;select("INBOX");

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       starttls
               $imap-&gt;starttls;

           If you start an IMAP session and wish to upgrade to SSL later, you can use  this  function  to  start
           TLS.  This function will try to "require" IO::Socket::SSL and Net::SSLeay at runtime.

       login
             my $inbox_msgs = $imap-&gt;login($user, $passwd);

           This  method  takes  two  required  parameters,  a  username and password. This pair is authenticated
           against the server. If authentication is successful TRUE (1) will be returned

           Nothing is returned on failure and the "errstr()" error handler is set with the error message.

       status
               my $num_messages                     = $imap-&gt;status($folder);
               my ($unseen, $recent, $num_messages) = $imap-&gt;status($folder);

           Issue a "STATUS" command.  The "STATUS" command counts messages without altering  the  state  of  the
           named  (optionally)  mailbox.   It  returns  either  the  number of messages, or the number of unseen
           messages, recent, and the total number of messages.

           $folder is an optional argument.  "status()" will use the current mailbox or "INBOX" if  the  $folder
           argument is not provided.

           This method does not use caching.

           This  method  can  also  query  custom status values.  The first argument to the function (if any) is
           assumed to be the folder name, so the folder argument is required when trying to query custom  status
           values.

               my ($f1, $f2) = $imap-&gt;status($folder, qw(f1 f2));
               my $f2        = $imap-&gt;status($folder, qw(f1 f2));

       uidnext
               my $uidnext = $imap-&gt;uidnext($folder);

           Return  the "UIDNEXT" value for a mailbox.  The $folder argument is optional.  This is really just an
           alias for

               my $uidnext = $imap-&gt;status($folder, qw(uidnext));

           with the mild difference that it can compute the folder argument for you

       uidvalidity
               my $uidvalidity = $imap-&gt;uidnext($folder);

           Return the "UIDVALIDITY" value for a mailbox.  The $folder argument is optional.   This  is  also  an
           alias for the status call like "uidnext()" above.

       uid This function is actually an alias for "$imap-&gt;uidsearch($msg_range)".

               my($uid)= $imap-&gt;uid($msgno);
               my @uid = $imap-&gt;uid($msg_range); # eg 4:14  or 15,4,14

           Return  the  "UID"  value(s) for a message.  These unique IDs "<u>must</u>" stay the same during the session
           and "<u>should</u>" stay the same between sessions.  Whether they stay the same depends on the "UIDVALIDITY"
           value; see: above and RFC3501.

           Warning, although you might thing @uid should contain the "UID"s for 15,  then  4,  then  14  in  the
           example  above; most IMAP servers seem to return the UIDs in increasing order.  Normally the sequence
           numbers are in increasing order also, so it all maches up.

               my ($uid4, $uid14, $uid15) = $imap-&gt;uid("15,4,14"); # warning

           One final note, this gives the size of the search match, not the uid like you might expect:

               my $uid_search_result_list_size = $imap-&gt;uid('3'); # probably always 1

       seq
               my $seq = $imap-&gt;seq($uids);
               my @seq = $imap-&gt;seq($uids); # eg 58888:58900

           Rather like "uid()" above, but maps uids to sequence numbers.

       select
               my $num_messages = $imap-&gt;select($folder);

           Selects a folder named in the single required parameter. The number of messages  in  that  folder  is
           returned  on  success.  On failure, nothing is returned  and the "errstr()" error handler is set with
           the error message.

       examine
           This is very nearly a synonym for "select()".  The only real difference is that the  EXAMINE  command
           is  sent  to  the server instead of SELECT.  Net::IMAP::Simple is otherwise unaware of the read-only-
           ness of the mailbox.

       close
               $imap-&gt;close;

           Un-selects the current mailbox, leaving no mailbox selected.

       messages
               print "Messages in Junk Mail -- " . $imap-&gt;messages("INBOX.Junk Mail") .  "\n";

           This method is an alias for "$imap-&gt;select"

       flags
               print "Available server flags: " . join(", ", $imap-&gt;flags) . "\n";

           This method accepts an optional folder name and returns the current available server flags as a list,
           for the selected folder. If no folder name is provided the last  folder  "$imap-&gt;select"'ed  will  be
           used.

           This method uses caching.

       separator
           Returns the folder separator (technically "hierarchy separator", rfc3501§6.3.8) for the server.

       recent
               print "Recent messages value: " . $imap-&gt;recent . "\n";

           This  method accepts an optional folder name and returns the 'RECENT' value provided durning a SELECT
           result set. If no folder name is provided the last folder "$imap-&gt;select"'ed will be used.

           This method uses caching.

           See also: search

       unseen
               print "Unseen messages value: " . $imap-&gt;unseen . "\n";

           This method accepts an optional folder name and returns the 'UNSEEN' value provided during  a  SELECT
           command  result. If no folder name is provided the last folder "$imap-&gt;select"'ed will be used.  If a
           folder name <u>is</u> provided, this will issue a SELECT first.

           This method uses caching.

           If the server does not provide UNSEEN during SELECT -- surprisingly common -- this method  will  fall
           back and use STATUS to determine the unseen count.

           <b>NOTE</b>:  This  is  not  the opposite of seen below.  The UNSEEN value varies from server to server, but
           according to the IMAP specification, it should be the <u>number</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>first</u> <u>unseen</u> <u>message</u>, in the case
           the flag is provided.  (If the flag is not provided, users would have to use the  SEARCH  command  to
           find it.)

           See also: search

       current_box
              print "Current Mail Box folder: " . $imap-&gt;current_box . "\n";

           This method returns the current working mail box folder name.

       top
               my $header = $imap-&gt;top( $message_number ); print for @{$header};

           This  method  accepts a message number as its required parameter. That message will be retrieved from
           the currently selected folder. On success this method returns a list reference containing  the  lines
           of  the header. Nothing is returned on failure and the "errstr()" error handler is set with the error
           message.

       seen
               defined( my $seen = $imap-&gt;seen( $message_number ) )
                   or warn "problem testing for \Seen: "
                         . $imap-&gt;errstr;

               print "msg #$message_number has been \Seen!" if $seen;

           A message number is the only required parameter for this method.  The message's "\Seen" flag will  be
           examined  and  if  the  message  has  been  seen  a true value is returned.  A defined false value is
           returned if the message does not have the "\Seen" flag set.  The undefined value is returned when  an
           error has occurred while checking the flag status.

           <b>NOTE</b>:  This  is not the opposite of unseen above.  This issues a "FETCH" command and checks to see if
           the given message has been "\Seen" before.

       deleted
               defined( my $deleted = $imap-&gt;deleted( $message_number ) )
                   or warn "problem testing for \Deleted: "
                         . $imap-&gt;errstr;

               print "msg #$message_number has been \Deleted!" if $deleted;

           A message number is the only required parameter for this method.  The message's "\Deleted" flag  will
           be  examined  and if the message has been deleted a true value is returned.  A defined false value is
           returned if the message does not have the "\Deleted" flag set.  The undefined value is returned  when
           an error has occurred while checking the flag status.

       list
               my $message_size  = $imap-&gt;list($message_number);
               my $mailbox_sizes = $imap-&gt;list;

           This method returns size information for a message, as indicated in the single optional parameter, or
           all  messages  in  a mailbox. When querying a single message a scalar value is returned. When listing
           the entire mailbox a hash is returned.  On failure, nothing is  returned  and  the  "errstr()"  error
           handler is set with the error message.

       fetch
             my $headers = $imap-&gt;fetch("1:5")

           Fetch the headers for messages 1-5 in the current folder.

             for my $midx ( keys %$headers ) {
                 for my $hdr in ($headers-&gt;{$midx}) {
                     say "$hdr"

                     # In many situations the headers will be parsed and may not be simple
                     # strings (e.g., with the SimpleX RecDescent parse). The simplest
                     # way to get a feel for the output is to use a dumper on it.
                 }
             }

       get
             my $message = $imap-&gt;get( $message_number ) or die $imap-&gt;errstr;
             my @message_lines = $map-&gt;get( $message_number ) or die $imap-&gt;errstr;

             my $part = $imap-&gt;get( $message_number, '1.1' ) or die $imap-&gt;errstr;
             my @part_lines = $imap-&gt;get( $message_number, '1.1' ) or die $imap-&gt;errstr;

           This  method fetches a message and returns its lines as an array or, the actual message.  On failure,
           either an empty list is returned and the "errstr()" error handler is set with the error message.

           Optionally, a part can be specified in order to fetch a specific portion of a message.  This  is  the
           raw,  encoded  body  of  the  message part.  The part number is a set of zero or more part specifiers
           delimited by periods.  Every message has at least one part.  Specifying a part  of  '1'  returns  the
           raw, encoded body.  This is only useful if you know the header information such as encoding.

           Historically,  "get()"  returned  the array of lines as a reference to the array instead of returning
           the message or the array itself.  Please note that it still does this, although it may be  deprecated
           in the future.

           The  scalar  result returned is actually a blessed arrayref with the stringify member overloaded.  If
           you're intending to use the resulting message as a string more than once, it <u>may</u> make sense to  force
           the stringification first.

               my $message = $imap-&gt;<a href="../man1/get.1.html">get</a>(1);
                  $message = "$message"; # force stringification

           It is not normally necessary to do this.

       put
             $imap-&gt;put( $mailbox_name, $message, @flags ) or warn $imap-&gt;errstr;

           Save  a message to the server under the folder named $mailbox_name.  You may optionally specify flags
           for the mail (e.g. "\Seen", "\Answered"), but they must start with a slash.

           If $message is an arrayref, the lines will be printed correctly.

       put_with_date
             $imap-&gt;put_with_date( $mailbox_name, $message, $date, @flags ) or warn $imap-&gt;errstr;

           Save a message to the server under the folder named $mailbox_name just like the put method above, but
           supplying a date will set the IMAP server internal date for the message if  supported  per  RFC  3501
           Section 6.3.11.

           Note  when  using  this  with  Gmail  it  expects the date format to be: DD-Mon-YYYY hh:mm:ss tz  for
           example  31-Dec-2016 12:59:59 -0500

       msg_flags
               my @flags = $imap-&gt;msg_flags( $message_number );
               my $flags = $imap-&gt;msg_flags( $message_number );

               # aught to come out roughly the same
               print "Flags on message #$message_number: @flags\n";
               print "Flags on message #$message_number: $flags\n";

           Detecting errors with this member functions is usually desirable.  In the scalar  context,  detecting
           an error is synonymous with testing for defined.

               if( defined( my $flags = $imap-&gt;msg_flags($num) ) ) {
                   # it has $flags!

               } else {
                   warn "problem listing flags for message #$num: "
                      . $imap-&gt;errstr;
               }

           In list context, you must call waserr() to test for success.

               my @flags = $imap-&gt;msg_flags($num);
               warn "problem listing flags for msg #$num: "
                  . $imap-&gt;errstr if $imap-&gt;waserr;

       getfh
             my $file = $imap-&gt;getfh( $message_number ); print &lt;$file&gt;;

           On  success  this  method  returns  a  file handle pointing to the message identified by the required
           parameter. On failure, nothing is returned and the "errstr()" error handler is  set  with  the  error
           message.

       quit
             $imap-&gt;quit;

             OR

             $imap-&gt;quit(BOOL);

           This method logs out of the IMAP server, expunges the selected mailbox, and closes the connection. No
           error message will ever be returned from this method.

           Optionally if BOOL is TRUE (1) then a hard quit is performed which closes the socket connection. This
           hard  quit  will still issue both EXPUNGE and LOGOUT commands however the response is ignored and the
           socket is closed after issuing the commands.

       logout
             $imap-&gt;logout;

           This method is just like the quit method except that it does not have a hard quit option and it  does
           not expunge the mailbox before it hangs up and closes the socket.

       last
             my $message_number = $imap-&gt;last;

           This  method  returns  the message number of the last message in the selected mailbox, since the last
           time the mailbox was selected. On failure, nothing is returned and the "errstr()"  error  handler  is
           set with the error message.

       delete
             print "Gone!" if $imap-&gt;delete( $message_number );

           This  method sets the "\Deleted" flag on the given message (or messages). On success it returns true,
           false on failure and the "errstr()" error handler is set with the error message.   If  the  flag  was
           already  there,  no error is produced.  I takes either a message number or "sequence set" as the only
           argument.  Note that messages aren't actually deleted until they are expunged (see expunge_mailbox).

       undelete
             print "Resurrected!" if $imap-&gt;undelete( $message_number );

           This method removes the "\Deleted" flag on the given message. On success it returns  true,  false  on
           failure and the "errstr()" error handler is set with the error message.  If the flag wasn't there, no
           error is produced.

       see
             print "You've seen message #$msgno" if $imap-&gt;see( $messageno );

           This  method sets the "\Seen" flag on the given message. On success it returns true, false on failure
           and the "errstr()" error handler is set with the error message.  If the flag was  already  there,  no
           error is produced.

       unsee
             print "You've not seen message #$msgno" if $imap-&gt;unsee( $messageno );

           This  method  removes  the  "\Seen"  flag  on the given message. On success it returns true, false on
           failure and the "errstr()" error handler is set with the error message.  If the flag wasn't there, no
           error is produced.

       add_flags
           delete and see above really just call this function for those flags.

              $imap-&gt;add_flags( $msgno, qw(\Seen \Deleted) )
                   or die $imap-&gt;errstr;

       sub_flags
           unsee above really just calls this function for that flag.

              $imap-&gt;sub_flags( $msgno, '\Seen' ) or die $imap-&gt;errstr;

       mailboxes
             my @boxes   = $imap-&gt;mailboxes;
             my @folders = $imap-&gt;mailboxes("Mail/%");
             my @lists   = $imap-&gt;mailboxes("lists/perl/*", "/Mail/");

           This method returns a list of mailboxes. When called with no arguments it recurses from the IMAP root
           to get all mailboxes. The first optional argument is a mailbox  path  and  the  second  is  the  path
           reference. RFC 3501 section 6.3.8 has more information.

           On failure nothing is returned and the "errstr()" error handler is set with the error message.

       mailboxes_subscribed
             my @boxes   = $imap-&gt;mailboxes_subscribed;
             my @folders = $imap-&gt;mailboxes_subscribed("Mail/%");
             my @lists   = $imap-&gt;mailboxes_subscribed("lists/perl/*", "/Mail/");

           This method returns a list of mailboxes subscribed to. When called with no arguments it recurses from
           the  IMAP  root to get all mailboxes. The first optional argument is a mailbox path and the second is
           the path reference. RFC 3501 has more information.

           On failure nothing is returned and the "errstr()" error handler is set with the error message.

       create_mailbox
             print "Created" if $imap-&gt;create_mailbox( "/Mail/lists/perl/advocacy" );

           This method creates the mailbox named in the required argument. Returns true  on  success,  false  on
           failure and the "errstr()" error handler is set with the error message.

       expunge_mailbox
             my @expunged = $imap-&gt;expunge_mailbox( "/Mail/lists/perl/advocacy" );
             die $imap-&gt;errstr if $imap-&gt;waserr;

             my $expunged = $imap-&gt;expunge_mailbox( "/Mail/lists/perl/advocacy" )
                 or die $imap-&gt;errstr;

           This method removes all mail marked as deleted in the mailbox named in the required argument. Returns
           either  the  number  of  messages that were expunged, or the indexes of those messages -- which has a
           questionable usefulness since it tends to return numbers that don't relate  to  the  message  numbers
           marked with the "\Deleted" flags.

           If  0  messages were expunged without error, the function will return 0E0 so it will still test true,
           but also evaluate to 0.

           In list context, you must call waserr() to test for success.

       delete_mailbox
             print "Deleted" if $imap-&gt;delete_mailbox( "/Mail/lists/perl/advocacy" );

           This method deletes the mailbox named in the required argument. Returns true  on  success,  false  on
           failure and the "errstr()" error handler is set with the error message.

       rename_mailbox
             print "Renamed" if $imap-&gt;rename_mailbox( $old =&gt; $new );

           This  method  renames  the  mailbox in the first required argument to the mailbox named in the second
           required argument. Returns true on success, false on failure and the "errstr()" error handler is  set
           with the error message.

       folder_subscribe
             print "Subscribed" if $imap-&gt;folder_subscribe( "/Mail/lists/perl/advocacy" );

           This  method  subscribes  to the folder. Returns true on success, false on failure and the "errstr()"
           error handler is set with the error message.

       folder_unsubscribe
             print "Unsubscribed" if $imap-&gt;folder_unsubscribe( "/Mail/lists/perl/advocacy" );

           This method un-subscribes to the folder. Returns true on success, false on failure and the "errstr()"
           error handler is set with the error message.

       copy
             print "copied" if $imap-&gt;copy( $message_number, $mailbox );

           This method copies the message number (or "sequence set") in the currently selected  mailbox  to  the
           folder  specified  in  the  second  argument.   Both  arguments are required.  On success this method
           returns true. Returns false on failure and the  "errstr()"  error  handler  is  set  with  the  error
           message.

       uidcopy
             print "copied" if $imap-&gt;uidcopy( $message_uid, $mailbox );

           This  method  is  identical  to  "copy()"  above, except that it uses UID numbers instead of sequence
           numbers.

       noop
             $imap-&gt;noop;

           Performs a null operation.  This may be needed to get updates on a mailbox, or ensure that the server
           does not close the connection as idle.  RFC 3501 states that servers' idle timeouts must not be  less
           than 30 minutes.

       errstr
            print "Login ERROR: " . $imap-&gt;errstr . "\n" if !$imap-&gt;login($user, $pass);

           Return the last error string captured for the last operation which failed.

       waserr
            my @flags = $imap-&gt;<a href="../man14/msg_flags.14.html">msg_flags</a>(14);
            die $imap-&gt;errstr if $imap-&gt;waserr;

           Because  "msg_flags()"  can  optionally  return a list, it's not really possible to detect failure in
           list context.  Therefore, you must call "waserr()" if you wish to detect errors.

           Few of the Net::IMAP::Simple methods use "waserr()".  The ones that do will mention it.

       list2range
           Sometimes you have a long list of sequence numbers which are consecutive and really  want  to  be  an
           IMAP-style range.

               my @list  = (5..9, 13..38, 55,56,57);
               my $short = $imap-&gt;list2range(@list);

               # $short how says: 5:9,13:38,55:57

       range2list
           Pretty much the opposite of "list2range".

               my @list = $imap-&gt;range2list("1,3,5:9");
               # @list is (1,3,5,6,7,8,9);

</pre><h4><b>SEARCHING</b></h4><pre>
       search
           This function returns an array of message numbers (in list context) or the number of matched messages
           (in scalar context).  It takes a single argument: the search.

           IMAP  searching  can be a little confusing and this function makes no attempt to parse your searches.
           If you wish to do searches by hand, please see RFC 3501.

           IMAP sorting (see RFC 5256) is supported via an optional  second  argument.   The  RFC  requires  the
           charset be specified, which can be provided via the optional third argument (defaults to UTF-8).

           Here are a few examples:

               my @ids = $imap-&gt;search("UNSEEN");
               my @ids = $imap-&gt;search('SUBJECT "blarg is \"blarg\""');
               my @ids = $imap-&gt;search('FROM "<a href="mailto:joe@aol.com">joe@aol.com</a>"');
               my @ids = $imap-&gt;search("DELETED");

               # example from RFC 3501, search terms are ANDed together
               my @ids = $imap-&gt;search('FLAGGED SINCE 1-Feb-1994 NOT FROM "Smith"');
               # example from RFC 3501, search terms are ORed together
               my @ids = $imap-&gt;search('OR BODY "blard" SUBJECT "blarg"');

               # flagged and ( since x or !from y ):
               my @ids = $imap-&gt;search('FLAGGED OR SINCE x NOT FROM "y"');
                 # no typo above, see the RFC

               # example from RFC 5256, sorted by subject and reverse date
               my @ids = $imap-&gt;search('BODY "zaphod"', 'SUBJECT REVERSE DATE');

           Since  this  module  is  meant to be simple, Net::IMAP::Simple has a few search helpers.  If you need
           fancy booleans and things, you'll have to learn search.  If  you  need  a  quick  search  for  unseen
           messages, see below.

           These all return an array of messages or count of messages exactly as the search function does.  Some
           of  them  take arguments, some do not.  They do try to grok your arguments slightly, the mechanics of
           this (if any) will be mentioned below.

           search_seen
               Returns numbers of messages that have the \Seen flag.

           search_recent
               Returns numbers of messages that have the \Recent flag.

           search_answered
               Returns numbers of messages that have the \Answered flag.

           search_deleted
               Returns numbers of messages that have the \Deleted flag.

           search_flagged
               Returns numbers of messages that have the \Flagged flag.

           search_draft
               Returns numbers of messages that have the \Draft flag.

           search_unseen
               Returns numbers of messages that do not have the \Seen flag.

           search_old
               Returns numbers of messages that do not have the \Recent flag.

           search_unanswered
               Returns numbers of messages that do not have the \Answered flag.

           search_undeleted
               Returns numbers of messages that do not have the \Deleted flag.

           search_unflagged
               Returns numbers of messages that do not have the \Flagged flag.

           search_smaller
               This function takes a single argument we'll call "&lt;x&gt;" and returns numbers of messages  that  are
               smaller  than  "&lt;x&gt;" octets.  This function will try to force your argument to be a number before
               passing it to the IMAP server.

           search_larger
               This function takes a single argument we'll call "&lt;x&gt;" and returns numbers of messages  that  are
               larger  than  "&lt;x&gt;"  octets.  This function will try to force your argument to be a number before
               passing it to the IMAP server.

           search_from
               This function takes a single argument we'll call "&lt;x&gt;" and returns numbers of messages that  have
               "&lt;x&gt;"  in  the  from  header.   This  function will attempt to force your string into the RFC3501
               quoted-string format.

           search_to
               This function takes a single argument we'll call "&lt;x&gt;" and returns numbers of messages that  have
               "&lt;x&gt;" in the to header.  This function will attempt to force your string into the RFC3501 quoted-
               string format.

           search_cc
               This  function takes a single argument we'll call "&lt;x&gt;" and returns numbers of messages that have
               "&lt;x&gt;" in the cc header.  This function will attempt to force your string into the RFC3501 quoted-
               string format.

           search_bcc
               This function takes a single argument we'll call "&lt;x&gt;" and returns numbers of messages that  have
               "&lt;x&gt;"  in  the  bcc  header.   This  function  will attempt to force your string into the RFC3501
               quoted-string format.

           search_subject
               This function takes a single argument we'll call "&lt;x&gt;" and returns numbers of messages that  have
               "&lt;x&gt;"  in  the  subject header.  This function will attempt to force your string into the RFC3501
               quoted-string format.

           search_body
               This function takes a single argument we'll call "&lt;x&gt;" and returns numbers of messages that  have
               "&lt;x&gt;"  in  the  message  body.   This function will attempt to force your string into the RFC3501
               quoted-string format.

           search_before
               This function takes a single argument we'll call "&lt;x&gt;" and returns numbers of messages that  were
               received  before "&lt;x&gt;".  If you have Date::Manip installed (optional), this function will attempt
               to force the date into the format "%d-%b-%Y" (date-monthName-year) as RFC3501 requires.   If  you
               do not have that module, no attempt will be made to coerce your date into the correct format.

           search_since
               This  function takes a single argument we'll call "&lt;x&gt;" and returns numbers of messages that were
               received after "&lt;x&gt;".  If you have Date::Manip installed (optional), this function  will  attempt
               to  force  the  date into the format "%d-%m-%Y" (date-month-year) as RFC3501 requires.  If you do
               not have that module, no attempt will be made to coerce your date into the correct format.

           search_sent_before
               This function takes a single argument we'll call "&lt;x&gt;" and returns numbers of messages that  have
               a  header  date  before  "&lt;x&gt;".  If you have Date::Manip installed (optional), this function will
               attempt to force the date into the format "%d-%m-%Y" (date-month-year) as RFC3501  requires.   If
               you do not have that module, no attempt will be made to coerce your date into the correct format.

           search_sent_since
               This  function takes a single argument we'll call "&lt;x&gt;" and returns numbers of messages that have
               a header date after "&lt;x&gt;".  If you have Date::Manip  installed  (optional),  this  function  will
               attempt  to  force the date into the format "%d-%m-%Y" (date-month-year) as RFC3501 requires.  If
               you do not have that module, no attempt will be made to coerce your date into the correct format.

       uidsearch
           This function works exactly like "search()" but it returns UIDs instead  of  sequence  numbers.   The
           convenient shortcuts above are not provided for it.

</pre><h4><b>OTHER</b> <b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       sequence set
           Message  numbers  are never checked before being passed to the IMAP server (this is a "simple" module
           after all), so in most places where a message number is  required,  you  can  instead  use  so-called
           <u>sequence</u> <u>sets</u>.  Examples:

               $imap-&gt;copy(   "3,4,9:22", "ANOTHERBOX" ) or die $imap-&gt;errstr;
               $imap-&gt;delete( "3,4,9:22" ) or die $imap-&gt;errstr;
