       Authen::Passphrase::BigCrypt - passphrases using bigcrypt algorithm

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
               use Authen::Passphrase::BigCrypt;

               $ppr = Authen::Passphrase::BigCrypt-&gt;new(
                       salt_base64 =&gt; "qi",
                       hash_base64 =&gt; "yh4XPJGsOZ2MEAyLkfWqeQ");

               $ppr = Authen::Passphrase::BigCrypt-&gt;new(
                       salt_random =&gt; 12,
                       passphrase =&gt; "passphrase");

               $salt = $ppr-&gt;salt;
               $salt_base64 = $ppr-&gt;salt_base64_2;
               $hash = $ppr-&gt;hash;
               $hash_base64 = $ppr-&gt;hash_base64;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       An object of this class encapsulates a passphrase hashed using the "bigcrypt" hash function found in HP-
       UX, Digital Unix, OSF/1, and some other flavours of Unix.  Do not confuse this with the "crypt16" found
       on Ultrix and Tru64 (for which see Authen::Passphrase::Crypt16).  This is a subclass of
       Authen::Passphrase, and this document assumes that the reader is familiar with the documentation for that
       class.

       This is a derivation of the original DES-based crypt function found on all Unices (see
       Authen::Passphrase::DESCrypt).  The first eight bytes of the passphrase are used as a DES key to encrypt
       the all-bits-zero block through 25 rounds of (12-bit) salted DES, just like the original crypt.  Then, if
       the passphrase is longer than eight bytes, the next eight bytes are used as a DES key to encrypt the all-
       bits-zero block through 25 rounds of salted DES, using as salt the first 12 bits of the hash of the first
       section.  Then, if the passphrase is longer than sixteen bytes, the next eight bytes are used, with salt
       consisting of the first 12 bits of the hash of the second section.  This repeats until the entire
       passphrase has been used.  The hashes of all the sections are concatenated to form the final hash.

       A password hash of this scheme is conventionally represented in ASCII using the base 64 encoding of the
       underlying DES-based crypt function.  The first two characters give the salt for the first section, the
       next eleven give the hash of the first section, the next eleven give the hash of the second section, and
       so on.  A hash thus encoded is used as a crypt string, on those systems where the bigcrypt algorithm is
       part of <b>crypt()</b>, but the syntax clashes with that of crypt16.  This module does not treat it as a crypt
       string syntax.

       Because the sections of the passphrase are hashed separately, it is possible to manipulate (e.g., crack)
       a section hash in isolation.  See Authen::Passphrase::DESCrypt for handling of a single section.

       <u>Warning:</u> This is a fatally flawed design, often providing <u>less</u> security than the plain DES scheme alone.
       Do not use seriously.

</pre><h4><b>CONSTRUCTOR</b></h4><pre>
       Authen::Passphrase::BigCrypt-&gt;new(ATTR =&gt; VALUE, ...)
           Generates  a  new  passphrase  recogniser  object  using  the bigcrypt hash algorithm.  The following
           attributes may be given:

           <b>salt</b>
               The salt for the first section, as an integer in the range [0, 4096).

           <b>salt_base64</b>
               The salt for the first section, as a string of two base 64 digits.

           <b>salt_random</b>
               Causes salt for the first section to be generated randomly.  The value given for  this  attribute
               must be 12, indicating generation of 12 bits of salt.  The source of randomness may be controlled
               by the facility described in Data::Entropy.

           <b>hash</b>
               The hash, as a string of bytes.

           <b>hash_base64</b>
               The hash, as a string of base 64 digits.

           <b>passphrase</b>
               A passphrase that will be accepted.

           The salt for the first section must be given, and either the hash or the passphrase.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       $ppr-&gt;salt
           Returns the salt for the first section, as a Perl integer.

       $ppr-&gt;salt_base64_2
           Returns the salt for the first section, as a string of two base 64 digits.

       $ppr-&gt;hash
           Returns the hash value, as a string of bytes.

       $ppr-&gt;hash_base64
           Returns  the  hash  value,  as  a string of base 64 digits.  This is the concatenation of the base 64
           encodings of the section hashes, rather than a base64 encoding of the combined hash.

       $ppr-&gt;sections
           Returns a reference to an  array  of  Authen::Passphrase::DESCrypt  passphrase  recognisers  for  the
           sections of the passphrase.

       $ppr-&gt;match(PASSPHRASE)
           This method is part of the standard Authen::Passphrase interface.
