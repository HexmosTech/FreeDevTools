                       "UOp9SSx6BnpbYzHoE1UceixDITllg==");

               $algorithm = $ppr-&gt;algorithm;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       An object of this class encapsulates a passphrase hashed using a generic digest-algorithm-based scheme.
       This is a subclass of Authen::Passphrase, and this document assumes that the reader is familiar with the
       documentation for that class.

       The salt is an arbitrary string of bytes.  It is appended to passphrase, and the combined string is
       passed through a specified message digest algorithm.  The output of the message digest algorithm is the
       passphrase hash.

       The strength depends entirely on the choice of digest algorithm, so choose according to the level of
       security required.  SHA-1 is suitable for most applications, but recent work has revealed weaknesses in
       the basic structure of MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, and all similar digest algorithms.  A new generation of
       digest algorithms emerged in 2008, centred around NIST's competition to design SHA-3.  Once these
       algorithms have been subjected to sufficient cryptanalysis, the survivors will be preferred over SHA-1
       and its generation.

       Digest algorithms are generally designed to be as efficient to compute as possible for their level of
       cryptographic strength.  An unbroken digest algorithm makes brute force the most efficient way to attack
       it, but makes no effort to resist a brute force attack.  This is a concern in some passphrase-using
       applications.

       The use of this kind of passphrase scheme is generally recommended for new systems.  Choice of digest
       algorithm is important: SHA-1 is suitable for most applications.  If efficiency of brute force attack is
       a concern, see Authen::Passphrase::BlowfishCrypt for an algorithm designed to be expensive to compute.

</pre><h4><b>CONSTRUCTORS</b></h4><pre>
       Authen::Passphrase::SaltedDigest-&gt;new(ATTR =&gt; VALUE, ...)
           Generates  a  new  passphrase  recogniser  object  using  the  generic  salted digest algorithm.  The
           following attributes may be given:

           <b>algorithm</b>
               Specifies the algorithm to use.  If it is a reference to a blessed object, it must be possible to
               call the "new" method on that object to generate a digest context object.

               If it is a string containing the subsequence "::" then it specifies a module  to  use.   A  plain
               package  name  in bareword syntax, optionally preceded by "::" (so that top-level packages can be
               recognised as such), is taken as a class name, on which  the  "new"  method  will  be  called  to
               generate  a  digest  context object.  The package name may optionally be followed by "-" to cause
               automatic loading of the module, and the "-" (if present) may optionally be followed by a version
               number that  will  be  checked  against.   For  example,  "Digest::MD5-1.99_53"  would  load  the
               Digest::MD5 module and check that it is at least version 1.99_53 (which is the first version that
               can be used by this module).

               A  string  not  containing  "::"  and  which  is understood by Digest-&gt;new will be passed to that
               function to generate a digest context object.

               Any other type of algorithm specifier has undefined behaviour.

               The digest context objects must support at least the standard "add" and "digest" methods.

           <b>salt</b>
               The salt, as a raw string of bytes.  Defaults to the empty string, yielding an unsalted scheme.

           <b>salt_hex</b>
               The salt, as a string of hexadecimal digits.  Defaults to the empty string, yielding an  unsalted
               scheme.

           <b>salt_random</b>
               Causes  salt to be generated randomly.  The value given for this attribute must be a non-negative
               integer, giving the number of bytes of salt to  generate.   (The  same  length  as  the  hash  is
               recommended.)   The  source  of  randomness  may  be  controlled  by  the  facility  described in
               Data::Entropy.

           <b>hash</b>
               The hash, as a string of bytes.

           <b>hash_hex</b>
               The hash, as a string of hexadecimal digits.

           <b>passphrase</b>
               A passphrase that will be accepted.

           The digest algorithm must be given, and either the hash or the passphrase.

       Authen::Passphrase::SaltedDigest-&gt;from_rfc2307(USERPASSWORD)
           Generates a salted-digest passphrase recogniser from  the  supplied  RFC2307  encoding.   The  scheme
           identifier  gives  the  digest algorithm and controls whether salt is permitted.  It is followed by a
           base 64 string, using standard MIME base 64, which encodes the concatenation of the hash and salt.

           The scheme identifiers accepted are  "<b>{MD4}</b>"  (unsalted  MD4),  "<b>{MD5}</b>"  (unsalted  MD5),  "<b>{RMD160}</b>"
           (unsalted  RIPEMD-160), "<b>{SHA}</b>" (unsalted SHA-1), "<b>{SMD5}</b>" (salted MD5), and "<b>{SSHA}</b>" (salted SHA-1).
           All scheme identifiers are recognised case-insensitively.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       $ppr-&gt;algorithm
           Returns the digest algorithm, in the same form as supplied to the constructor.

       $ppr-&gt;salt
           Returns the salt, in raw form.

       $ppr-&gt;salt_hex
           Returns the salt, as a string of hexadecimal digits.

       $ppr-&gt;hash
           Returns the hash value, in raw form.

       $ppr-&gt;hash_hex
           Returns the hash value, as a string of hexadecimal digits.

       $ppr-&gt;match(PASSPHRASE)
       $ppr-&gt;as_rfc2307
           These methods are part of the standard Authen::Passphrase  interface.   Only  passphrase  recognisers
           using certain well-known digest algorithms can be represented in RFC 2307 form.
