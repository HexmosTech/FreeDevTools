</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       An object of this class encapsulates a passphrase hashed using one of the Purdy polynomial hash functions
       used in VMS.  This is a subclass of Authen::Passphrase, and this document assumes that the reader is
       familiar with the documentation for that class.

       The core of the Purdy polynomial hashing algorithm transforms one 64-bit number into another 64-bit
       number.  It was developed by George B. Purdy, and described in the paper "A High Security Log-in
       Procedure" which can be found at
       &lt;<a href="http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm">http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm</a>?id=361089&amp;dl=GUIDE&amp;coll=ACM&amp;CFID=15151515&amp;CFTOKEN=6184618&gt;.

       For practical use in passphrase hashing, the Purdy polynomial must be augmented by a procedure to turn a
       variable-length passphrase into the initial 64-bit number to be hashed.  In VMS this pre-hashing phase
       also incorporates the username of the account to which access is being controlled, in order to prevent
       identical passphrases yielding identical hashes.  This is a form of salting.  Another salt parameter, a
       16-bit integer, is also included, this one going under the name "salt".

       There are three variants of the pre-hashing algorithm.  The original version, known as "<b>PURDY</b>" and used
       during field testing of VMS 2.0, truncates or space-pads the username to a fixed length.  The second
       version, known as "<b>PURDY_V</b>" and used from VMS 2.0 up to (but not including) VMS 5.4, properly handles the
       variable-length nature of the username.  The third version, known as "<b>PURDY_S</b>" and used from VMS 5.4
       onwards, performs some extra bit rotations to avoid aliasing problems when pre-hashing long strings.  All
       three versions are supported by this module.

       VMS heavily restricts the composition of both usernames and passphrases.  They may only contain
       alphanumerics, "<b>$</b>", and "<b>_</b>".  Case is insignificant.  Usernames must be between 1 and 31 characters long,
       and passphrases must be between 1 and 32 characters long.  This module enforces these rules.  An invalid
       passphrase is never accepted as matching.

</pre><h4><b>CONSTRUCTORS</b></h4><pre>
       Authen::Passphrase::VMSPurdy-&gt;new(ATTR =&gt; VALUE, ...)
           Generates  a  new  passphrase recogniser object using the VMS Purdy polynomial algorithm family.  The
           following attributes may be given:

           <b>algorithm</b>
               A string indicating which variant of the algorithm is to be used.  Valid values are "<b>PURDY</b>"  (the
               original),  "<b>PURDY_V</b>"  (modified  to  use  full  length  of  the  username), and "<b>PURDY_S</b>" (extra
               rotations to avoid aliasing when processing long strings).  Default "<b>PURDY_S</b>".

           <b>username</b>
               A string to be used as the `username' salt parameter.  It is limited to VMS username syntax.

           <b>salt</b>
               The salt, as an integer in the range [0, 65536).

           <b>salt_hex</b>
               The salt, as a string of four hexadecimal digits.  The first two  digits  must  give  the  least-
               significant  byte  and  the last two give the most-significant byte, with most-significant nybble
               first within each byte.

           <b>salt_random</b>
               Causes salt to be generated randomly.  The value given for this attribute is ignored.  The source
               of randomness may be controlled by the facility described in Data::Entropy.

           <b>hash</b>
               The hash, as a string of eight bytes.

           <b>hash_hex</b>
               The hash, as a string of 16 hexadecimal digits.

           <b>passphrase</b>
               A passphrase that will be accepted.  It is limited to VMS passphrase syntax.

           The username and salt must be given, and either the hash or the passphrase.

       Authen::Passphrase::VMSPurdy-&gt;from_crypt(PASSWD)
           Generates a new passphrase recogniser object using the VMS Purdy polynomial algorithm family, from  a
           crypt  string.  The string must consist of an algorithm identifier, the salt in hexadecimal, the hash
           in hexadecimal, then the username.  The salt must be given as four hexadecimal digits, the first  two
           giving  the  least-significant  byte  and  the  last two giving the most-significant byte, with most-
           significant nybble first within each byte.  The algorithm identifier must be  "<b>$VMS1$</b>"  for  "<b>PURDY</b>",
           "<b>$VMS2$</b>" for "<b>PURDY_V</b>", or "<b>$VMS3$</b>" for "<b>PURDY_S</b>".  The whole crypt string must be uppercase.

       Authen::Passphrase::VMSPurdy-&gt;from_rfc2307(USERPASSWORD)
           Generates a new passphrase recogniser object using the VMS Purdy polynomial algorithm family, from an
           RFC  2307  string.  The string must consist of "<b>{CRYPT}</b>" (case insensitive) followed by an acceptable
           crypt string.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       $ppr-&gt;algorithm
           Returns the algorithm variant identifier  string.   It  may  be  "<b>PURDY</b>"  (the  original),  "<b>PURDY_V</b>"
           (modified  to use full length of the username), and "<b>PURDY_S</b>" (extra rotations to avoid aliasing when
           processing long strings).

       $ppr-&gt;username
           Returns the username string.  All alphabetic characters in it are uppercase, which is  the  canonical
           form.

       $ppr-&gt;salt
           Returns the salt, as an integer.

       $ppr-&gt;salt_hex
           Returns  the  salt,  as  a  string  of four hexadecimal digits.  The first two digits give the least-
           significant byte and the last two give the most-significant byte, with most-significant nybble  first
           within each byte.

       $ppr-&gt;hash
           Returns the hash value, as a string of eight bytes.

       $ppr-&gt;hash_hex
           Returns the hash value, as a string of 16 uppercase hexadecimal digits.

       $ppr-&gt;match(PASSPHRASE)
       $ppr-&gt;as_crypt
       $ppr-&gt;as_rfc2307
           These methods are part of the standard Authen::Passphrase interface.
