</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
               use Authen::Passphrase::MD5Crypt;

               $ppr = Authen::Passphrase::MD5Crypt-&gt;new(

                       '{CRYPT}$1$Vd3f8aG6$GcsdF4YCXb0PM2UmXjIoI1');

               $salt = $ppr-&gt;salt;
               $hash_base64 = $ppr-&gt;hash_base64;

               if($ppr-&gt;match($passphrase)) { ...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       An object of this class encapsulates a passphrase hashed using the MD5-based Unix <b>crypt()</b> hash function.
       This is a subclass of Authen::Passphrase, and this document assumes that the reader is familiar with the
       documentation for that class.

       The <b>crypt()</b> function in a modern Unix actually supports several different passphrase schemes.  This class
       is concerned only with one particular scheme, an MD5-based algorithm designed by Poul-Henning Kamp and
       originally implemented in FreeBSD.  To handle the whole range of passphrase schemes supported by the
       modern <b>crypt()</b>, see the from_crypt constructor and the as_crypt method in Authen::Passphrase.

       The MD5-based <b>crypt()</b> scheme uses the whole passphrase, a salt which can in principle be an arbitrary
       byte string, and the MD5 message digest algorithm.  First the passphrase and salt are hashed together,
       yielding an MD5 message digest.  Then a new digest is constructed, hashing together the passphrase, the
       salt, and the first digest, all in a rather complex form.  Then this digest is passed through a thousand
       iterations of a function which rehashes it together with the passphrase and salt in a manner that varies
       between rounds.  The output of the last of these rounds is the resulting passphrase hash.

       In the <b>crypt()</b> function the raw hash output is then represented in ASCII as a 22-character string using a
       base 64 encoding.  The base 64 digits are "<b>.</b>", "<b>/</b>", "<b>0</b>" to "<b>9</b>", "<b>A</b>" to "<b>Z</b>", "<b>a</b>" to "<b>z</b>" (in ASCII order).
       Because the base 64 encoding can represent 132 bits in 22 digits, more than the 128 required, the last
       digit can only take four of the base 64 digit values.  An additional complication is that the bytes of
       the raw algorithm output are permuted in a bizarre order before being represented in base 64.

       There is no tradition of handling these passphrase hashes in raw binary form.  The textual encoding
       described above, including the final permutation, is used universally, so this class does not support any
       binary format.

       The complex algorithm was designed to be slow to compute, in order to resist brute force attacks.
       However, the complexity is fixed, and the operation of Moore's Law has rendered it far less expensive
       than intended.  If efficiency of a brute force attack is a concern, see
       Authen::Passphrase::BlowfishCrypt.

</pre><h4><b>CONSTRUCTORS</b></h4><pre>
       Authen::Passphrase::MD5Crypt-&gt;new(ATTR =&gt; VALUE, ...)
           Generates  a  new  passphrase recogniser object using the MD5-based <b>crypt()</b> algorithm.  The following
           attributes may be given:

           <b>salt</b>
               The salt, as a raw string.  It may be any byte string, but in <b>crypt()</b> usage it is  conventionally
               limited to zero to eight base 64 digits.

           <b>salt_random</b>
               Causes  salt  to be generated randomly.  The value given for this attribute is ignored.  The salt
               will be a string of eight base 64 digits.  The source of randomness  may  be  controlled  by  the
               facility described in Data::Entropy.

           <b>hash_base64</b>
               The hash, as a string of 22 base 64 digits.  This is the final part of what <b>crypt()</b> outputs.

           <b>passphrase</b>
               A passphrase that will be accepted.

           The salt must be given, and either the hash or the passphrase.

       Authen::Passphrase::MD5Crypt-&gt;from_crypt(PASSWD)
           Generates  a  new  passphrase  recogniser  object using the MD5-based <b>crypt()</b> algorithm, from a crypt
           string.  The crypt string must consist of "<b>$1$</b>", the salt, "<b>$</b>", then 22 base  64  digits  giving  the
           hash.   The  salt may be up to 8 characters long, and cannot contain "<b>$</b>" or any character that cannot
           appear in a crypt string.

       Authen::Passphrase::MD5Crypt-&gt;from_rfc2307(USERPASSWORD)
           Generates a new passphrase recogniser object using the MD5-based <b>crypt()</b> algorithm, from an RFC  2307
           string.   The  string  must  consist  of "<b>{CRYPT}</b>" (case insensitive) followed by an acceptable crypt
           string.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       $ppr-&gt;salt
           Returns the salt, in raw form.

       $ppr-&gt;hash_base64
           Returns the hash value, as a string of 22 base 64 digits.

       $ppr-&gt;match(PASSPHRASE)
       $ppr-&gt;as_crypt
       $ppr-&gt;as_rfc2307
           These methods are part of the standard Authen::Passphrase interface.  Not every passphrase recogniser
           of this type can be represented as a crypt string: the crypt format only allows the salt to be up  to
           eight bytes, and it cannot contain any NUL or "<b>$</b>" characters.
