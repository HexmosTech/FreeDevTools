</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       XML::DOM::Node - Super class of all nodes in XML::DOM

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       XML::DOM::Node is the super class of all nodes in an XML::DOM document.  This means that all nodes that
       subclass XML::DOM::Node also inherit all the methods that XML::DOM::Node implements.

   <b>GLOBAL</b> <b>VARIABLES</b>
       @NodeNames
           The  variable  @XML::DOM::Node::NodeNames  maps  the  node  type constants to strings.  It is used by
           XML::DOM::Node::getNodeTypeName.

   <b>METHODS</b>
       getNodeType
           Return an integer indicating the node type. See XML::DOM constants.

       getNodeName
           Return a property or a hardcoded string, depending on the node  type.   Here  are  the  corresponding
           functions or values:

            Attr                   getName
            AttDef                 getName
            AttlistDecl            getName
            CDATASection           "#cdata-section"
            Comment                "#comment"
            Document               "#document"
            DocumentType           getNodeName
            DocumentFragment       "#document-fragment"
            Element                getTagName
            ElementDecl            getName
            EntityReference        getEntityName
            Entity                 getNotationName
            Notation               getName
            ProcessingInstruction  getTarget
            Text                   "#text"
            XMLDecl                "#xml-declaration"

           <b>Not</b> <b>In</b> <b>DOM</b> <b>Spec</b>: AttDef, AttlistDecl, ElementDecl and XMLDecl were added for completeness.

       getNodeValue and setNodeValue (value)
           Returns  a  string or undef, depending on the node type. This method is provided for completeness. In
           other languages it saves the programmer an upcast.  The value is either  available  thru  some  other
           method  defined  in  the  subclass,  or  else  undef is returned. Here are the corresponding methods:
           Attr::getValue,           Text::getData,           CDATASection::getData,           Comment::getData,
           ProcessingInstruction::getData.

       getParentNode and setParentNode (parentNode)
           The  parent  of  this node. All nodes, except Document, DocumentFragment, and Attr may have a parent.
           However, if a node has just been created and not yet added to the tree, or if  it  has  been  removed
           from the tree, this is undef.

       getChildNodes
           A  NodeList  that  contains  all  children of this node. If there are no children, this is a NodeList
           containing no nodes. The content of the returned NodeList is "live" in the sense that, for  instance,
           changes  to the children of the node object that it was created from are immediately reflected in the
           nodes returned by the NodeList accessors; it is not a static snapshot of the  content  of  the  node.
           This is true for every NodeList, including the ones returned by the getElementsByTagName method.

           NOTE: this implementation does not return a "live" NodeList for getElementsByTagName. See CAVEATS.

           When  this  method  is  called in a list context, it returns a regular perl list containing the child
           nodes. Note that this list is not "live". E.g.

            @list = $node-&gt;getChildNodes;        # returns a perl list
            $nodelist = $node-&gt;getChildNodes;    # returns a NodeList (object reference)
            for my $kid ($node-&gt;getChildNodes)   # iterate over the children of $node

       getFirstChild
           The first child of this node. If there is no such node, this returns undef.

       getLastChild
           The last child of this node. If there is no such node, this returns undef.

       getPreviousSibling
           The node immediately preceding this node. If there is no such node, this returns undef.

       getNextSibling
           The node immediately following this node. If there is no such node, this returns undef.

       getAttributes
           A NamedNodeMap containing the attributes (Attr nodes) of this node (if it is  an  Element)  or  undef
           otherwise.   Note  that  adding/removing  attributes  from  the  returned  object,  also adds/removes
           attributes from the Element node that the NamedNodeMap came from.

       getOwnerDocument
           The Document object associated with this node. This is also the Document object used  to  create  new
           nodes. When this node is a Document this is undef.

       insertBefore (newChild, refChild)
           Inserts  the  node  newChild  before  the  existing child node refChild. If refChild is undef, insert
           newChild at the end of the list of children.

           If newChild is a DocumentFragment object, all of its children are inserted, in the same order, before
           refChild. If the newChild is already in the tree, it is first removed.

           Return Value: The node being inserted.

           DOMExceptions:

           •   HIERARCHY_REQUEST_ERR

               Raised if this node is of a type that does not allow children of the type of the  newChild  node,
               or if the node to insert is one of this node's ancestors.

           •   WRONG_DOCUMENT_ERR

               Raised if newChild was created from a different document than the one that created this node.

           •   NO_MODIFICATION_ALLOWED_ERR

               Raised if this node is readonly.

           •   NOT_FOUND_ERR

               Raised if refChild is not a child of this node.

       replaceChild (newChild, oldChild)
           Replaces  the  child  node  oldChild  with newChild in the list of children, and returns the oldChild
           node. If the newChild is already in the tree, it is first removed.

           Return Value: The node replaced.

           DOMExceptions:

           •   HIERARCHY_REQUEST_ERR

               Raised if this node is of a type that does not allow children of the type of the  newChild  node,
               or it the node to put in is one of this node's ancestors.

           •   WRONG_DOCUMENT_ERR

               Raised if newChild was created from a different document than the one that created this node.

           •   NO_MODIFICATION_ALLOWED_ERR

               Raised if this node is readonly.

           •   NOT_FOUND_ERR

               Raised if oldChild is not a child of this node.

       removeChild (oldChild)
           Removes the child node indicated by oldChild from the list of children, and returns it.

           Return Value: The node removed.

           DOMExceptions:

           •   NO_MODIFICATION_ALLOWED_ERR

               Raised if this node is readonly.

           •   NOT_FOUND_ERR

               Raised if oldChild is not a child of this node.

       appendChild (newChild)
           Adds the node newChild to the end of the list of children of this node. If the newChild is already in
           the  tree,  it  is  first  removed.  If  it  is a DocumentFragment object, the entire contents of the
           document fragment are moved into the child list of this node

           Return Value: The node added.

           DOMExceptions:

           •   HIERARCHY_REQUEST_ERR

               Raised if this node is of a type that does not allow children of the type of the  newChild  node,
               or if the node to append is one of this node's ancestors.

           •   WRONG_DOCUMENT_ERR

               Raised if newChild was created from a different document than the one that created this node.

           •   NO_MODIFICATION_ALLOWED_ERR

               Raised if this node is readonly.

       hasChildNodes
           This is a convenience method to allow easy determination of whether a node has any children.

           Return Value: 1 if the node has any children, 0 otherwise.

       cloneNode (deep)
           Returns a duplicate of this node, i.e., serves as a generic copy constructor for nodes. The duplicate
           node has no parent (parentNode returns undef.).

           Cloning  an  Element  copies  all  attributes  and their values, including those generated by the XML
           processor to represent defaulted attributes, but this method does  not  copy  any  text  it  contains
           unless  it  is a deep clone, since the text is contained in a child Text node. Cloning any other type
           of node simply returns a copy of this node.

           Parameters:
            <u>deep</u>   If true, recursively clone the subtree under the specified node.  If false,  clone  only  the
           node itself (and its attributes, if it is an Element).

           Return Value: The duplicate node.

       normalize
           Puts  all  Text  nodes in the full depth of the sub-tree underneath this Element into a "normal" form
           where only markup  (e.g.,  tags,  comments,  processing  instructions,  CDATA  sections,  and  entity
           references)  separates Text nodes, i.e., there are no adjacent Text nodes. This can be used to ensure
           that the DOM view of a document is the same as if it were saved and re-loaded,  and  is  useful  when
           operations  (such  as XPointer lookups) that depend on a particular document tree structure are to be
           used.

           <b>Not</b> <b>In</b> <b>DOM</b> <b>Spec</b>: In the DOM Spec this method is defined in the Element and Document class  interfaces
           only, but it doesn't hurt to have it here...

       getElementsByTagName (name [, recurse])
           Returns a NodeList of all descendant elements with a given tag name, in the order in which they would
           be encountered in a preorder traversal of the Element tree.

           Parameters:
            <u>name</u>  The name of the tag to match on. The special value "*" matches all tags.
            <u>recurse</u>  Whether it should return only direct child nodes (0) or any descendant that matches the tag
           name (1). This argument is optional and defaults to 1. It is not part of the DOM spec.

           Return Value: A list of matching Element nodes.

           NOTE: this implementation does not return a "live" NodeList for getElementsByTagName. See CAVEATS.

           When  this  method  is called in a list context, it returns a regular perl list containing the result
           nodes. E.g.

            @list = $node-&gt;getElementsByTagName("tag");       # returns a perl list
            $nodelist = $node-&gt;getElementsByTagName("tag");   # returns a NodeList (object ref.)
            for my $elem ($node-&gt;getElementsByTagName("tag")) # iterate over the result nodes

   <b>Additional</b> <b>methods</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>DOM</b> <b>Spec</b>
       getNodeTypeName
           Return the string describing the node type.   E.g.  returns  "ELEMENT_NODE"  if  getNodeType  returns
           ELEMENT_NODE.  It uses @XML::DOM::Node::NodeNames.

       toString
           Returns the entire subtree as a string.

       printToFile (filename)
           Prints the entire subtree to the file with the specified filename.

           Croaks: if the file could not be opened for writing.

       printToFileHandle (handle)
           Prints the entire subtree to the file handle.  E.g. to print to STDOUT:

            $node-&gt;printToFileHandle (\*STDOUT);

       print (obj)
           Prints the entire subtree using the object's print method. E.g to print to a FileHandle object:

            $f = new FileHandle ("file.out", "w");
            $node-&gt;print ($f);

       getChildIndex (child)
           Returns the index of the child node in the list returned by getChildNodes.

           Return Value: the index or -1 if the node is not found.

       getChildAtIndex (index)
           Returns the child node at the specified index or undef.

       addText (text)
           Appends  the specified string to the last child if it is a Text node, or else appends a new Text node
           (with the specified text.)

           Return Value: the last child if it was a Text node or else the new Text node.

       dispose
           Removes all circular references in this node and its descendants so the objects can  be  claimed  for
           garbage collection. The objects should not be used afterwards.

       setOwnerDocument (doc)
           Sets  the  ownerDocument  property  of  this  node  and all its children (and attributes etc.) to the
           specified document.  This allows the user to  cut  and  paste  document  subtrees  between  different
           XML::DOM::Documents.  The  node  should  be  removed from the original document first, before calling
           setOwnerDocument.

           This method does nothing when called on a Document node.

       isAncestor (parent)
           Returns 1 if parent is an ancestor of this node or if it is this node itself.

       expandEntityRefs (str)
           Expands all the entity references in the string and returns the result.  The entity references can be
           character references (e.g. "&amp;#123;" or  "&amp;#x1fc2"),  default  entity  references  ("&amp;quot;",  "&amp;gt;",
           "&amp;lt;",  "&amp;apos;"  and  "&amp;amp;")  or  entity  references  defined  in  Entity  objects as part of the
           DocumentType of the owning Document. Character references are expanded into UTF-8.  Parameter  entity
           references (e.g. %ent;) are not expanded.

       to_sax ( %HANDLERS )
           E.g.

            $node-&gt;to_sax (DocumentHandler =&gt; $my_handler,
                           Handler =&gt; $handler2 );

           %HANDLERS may contain the following handlers:

           •   DocumentHandler

           •   DTDHandler

           •   EntityResolver

           •   Handler

               Default handler when one of the above is not specified

           Each  XML::DOM::Node  generates  the  appropriate  SAX  callbacks  (for the appropriate SAX handler.)
           Different SAX handlers can be plugged in to accomplish  different  things,  e.g.  XML::Checker  would
           check  the  node  (currently  only  Document and Element nodes are supported), XML::Handler::BuildDOM
           would create a new DOM subtree (thereby, in essence, copying  the  Node)  and  in  the  near  future,
           XML::Writer  could print the node.  All Perl SAX related work is still in flux, so this interface may
           change a little.

           See PerlSAX for the description of the SAX interface.

       check ( [$checker] )
           See descriptions for <b>check()</b> in XML::DOM::Document and XML::DOM::Element.

       xql ( @XQL_OPTIONS )
           To use the xql method, you must first <u>use</u> XML::XQL and XML::XQL::DOM.  This  method  is  basically  a
           shortcut for:

            $query = new XML::XQL::Query ( @XQL_OPTIONS );
            return $query-&gt;solve ($node);

           If  the  first parameter in @XQL_OPTIONS is the XQL expression, you can leave off the 'Expr' keyword,
           so:

            $node-&gt;xql ("doc//elem1[@attr]", @other_options);

           is identical to:

            $node-&gt;xql (Expr =&gt; "doc//elem1[@attr]", @other_options);

           See XML::XQL::Query for other available XQL_OPTIONS.  See XML::XQL and  XML::XQL::Tutorial  for  more
           info.

       isHidden ()
           Whether the node is hidden.  See Hidden Nodes for details.
