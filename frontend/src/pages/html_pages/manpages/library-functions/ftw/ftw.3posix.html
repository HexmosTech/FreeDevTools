</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       ftw — traverse (walk) a file tree

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/ftw.h">ftw.h</a>&gt;

       int ftw(const char *<u>path</u>, int (*<u>fn</u>)(const char *,
           const struct stat *<u>ptr</u>, int <u>flag</u>), int <u>ndirs</u>);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>ftw</u>() function shall recursively descend the directory hierarchy rooted in <u>path</u>.  For each object in
       the hierarchy, <u>ftw</u>() shall call the function pointed to by <u>fn</u>, passing it a pointer to a  null-terminated
       character  string containing the name of the object, a pointer to a <b>stat</b> structure containing information
       about the object, filled in as if <u>stat</u>() or <u>lstat</u>() had been called to retrieve the information. Possible
       values of the integer, defined in the <u>&lt;ftw.h&gt;</u> header, are:

       FTW_D     For a directory.

       FTW_DNR   For a directory that cannot be read.

       FTW_F     For a non-directory file.

       FTW_SL    For a symbolic link (but see also FTW_NS below).

       FTW_NS    For an object other than a symbolic link on which <u>stat</u>() could not successfully be executed. If
                 the object is a symbolic link and <u>stat</u>() failed, it is unspecified whether <u>ftw</u>() passes  FTW_SL
                 or FTW_NS to the user-supplied function.

       If  the  integer  is  FTW_DNR,  descendants  of  that directory shall not be processed. If the integer is
       FTW_NS, the <b>stat</b> structure contains undefined values. An example of an object that would cause FTW_NS  to
       be  passed  to the function pointed to by <u>fn</u> would be a file in a directory with read but without execute
       (search) permission.

       The <u>ftw</u>() function shall visit a directory before visiting any of its descendants.

       The <u>ftw</u>() function shall use at most one file descriptor for each level in the tree.

       The argument <u>ndirs</u> should be in the range [1,{OPEN_MAX}].

       The tree traversal shall continue until either the tree is exhausted, an invocation of <u>fn</u> returns a  non-
       zero value, or some error, other than <b>[EACCES]</b>, is detected within <u>ftw</u>().

       The  <u>ndirs</u>  argument  shall  specify  the maximum number of directory streams or file descriptors or both
       available for use by <u>ftw</u>() while traversing the tree. When <u>ftw</u>() returns it  shall  close  any  directory
       streams and file descriptors it uses not counting any opened by the application-supplied <u>fn</u> function.

       The results are unspecified if the application-supplied <u>fn</u> function does not preserve the current working
       directory.

       The <u>ftw</u>() function need not be thread-safe.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       If  the  tree  is  exhausted,  <u>ftw</u>()  shall return 0. If the function pointed to by <u>fn</u> returns a non-zero
       value, <u>ftw</u>() shall stop its tree traversal and return whatever value was returned by the function pointed
       to by <u>fn</u>.  If <u>ftw</u>() detects an error, it shall return -1 and set <u>errno</u> to indicate the error.

       If <u>ftw</u>() encounters an error other than <b>[EACCES]</b> (see FTW_DNR and FTW_NS above), it shall return  -1  and
       set <u>errno</u> to indicate the error. The external variable <u>errno</u> may contain any error value that is possible
       when a directory is opened or when one of the <u>stat</u> functions is executed on a directory or file.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>ftw</u>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EACCES</b> Search permission is denied for any component of <u>path</u> or read permission is denied for <u>path</u>.

       <b>ELOOP</b>  A loop exists in symbolic links encountered during resolution of the <u>path</u> argument.

       <b>ENAMETOOLONG</b>
              The length of a component of a pathname is longer than {NAME_MAX}.

       <b>ENOENT</b> A component of <u>path</u> does not name an existing file or <u>path</u> is an empty string.

       <b>ENOTDIR</b>
              A  component  of  <u>path</u> names an existing file that is neither a directory nor a symbolic link to a
              directory.

       <b>EOVERFLOW</b>
              A field in the  <b>stat</b>  structure  cannot  be  represented  correctly  in  the  current  programming
              environment for one or more files found in the file hierarchy.

       The <u>ftw</u>() function may fail if:

       <b>EINVAL</b> The value of the <u>ndirs</u> argument is invalid.

       <b>ELOOP</b>  More than {SYMLOOP_MAX} symbolic links were encountered during resolution of the <u>path</u> argument.

       <b>ENAMETOOLONG</b>
              The length of a pathname exceeds {PATH_MAX}, or pathname resolution of a symbolic link produced an
              intermediate result with a length that exceeds {PATH_MAX}.

       In addition, if the function pointed to by <u>fn</u> encounters system errors, <u>errno</u> may be set accordingly.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Walking</b> <b>a</b> <b>Directory</b> <b>Structure</b>
       The  following example walks the current directory structure, calling the <u>fn</u> function for every directory
       entry, using at most 10 file descriptors:

           #include &lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/ftw.h">ftw.h</a>&gt;
           ...
           if (ftw(".", fn, 10) != 0) {
               perror("ftw"); <a href="../man2/exit.2.html">exit</a>(2);
           }

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>ftw</u>() function may allocate dynamic storage during its operation. If <u>ftw</u>()  is  forcibly  terminated,
       such  as  by  <u>longjmp</u>()  or  <u>siglongjmp</u>() being executed by the function pointed to by <u>fn</u> or an interrupt
       routine, <u>ftw</u>() does not have a chance to free that storage, so it remains permanently allocated.  A  safe
       way  to  handle  interrupts  is to store the fact that an interrupt has occurred, and arrange to have the
       function pointed to by <u>fn</u> return a non-zero value at its next invocation.

       Applications should use the <u>nftw</u>() function instead of the obsolescent <u>ftw</u>() function.

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>FUTURE</b> <b>DIRECTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>ftw</u>() function may be removed in a future version.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
