       clEnqueueReleaseGLObjects - Release OpenCL memory objects that have been created from OpenGL objects.

       <b>cl_int</b> <b>clEnqueueReleaseGLObjects(cl_command_queue</b> <u>command_queue</u><b>,</b> <b>cl_uint</b> <u>num_objects</u><b>,</b>
                                        <b>const</b> <b>cl_mem</b> <b>*</b><u>mem_objects</u><b>,</b> <b>cl_uint</b> <u>num_events_in_wait_list</u><b>,</b>

</pre><h4><b>PARAMETERS</b></h4><pre>
        <u>command_queue</u>
           A valid command-queue.

        <u>num_objects</u>
           The number of memory objects to be released in <u>mem_objects</u>.

        <u>mem_objects</u>
           A pointer to a list of CL memory objects that correspond to GL objects.

         <u>event_wait_list</u> ,   <u>num_events_in_wait_list</u>
           These parameters specify events that need to complete before this command can be executed. If
           <u>event_wait_list</u> is NULL, then this particular command does not wait on any event to complete. If
           <u>event_wait_list</u> is NULL, <u>num_events_in_wait_list</u> must be 0. If <u>event_wait_list</u> is not NULL, the list
           of events pointed to by <u>event_wait_list</u> must be valid and <u>num_events_in_wait_list</u> must be greater
           than 0. The events specified in <u>event_wait_list</u> act as synchronization points.

        <u>event</u>
           Returns an event object that identifies this particular read/write command and can be used to query
           or queue a wait for the command to complete.  <u>event</u> can be NULL in which case it will not be possible
           for the application to query the status of this command or queue a wait for this command to complete.

           If the <b><a href="../man3clc/cl_khr_gl_sharing.3clc.html">cl_khr_gl_sharing</a></b>(3clc) extension is supported and if an OpenGL context is bound to the
           current thread, then any OpenGL commands which does:

           •    affect or access the contents of a memory object listed in the <u>mem_objects</u> list, and

           •    are issued on that context after the call to <b>clEnqueueReleaseGLObjects</b>.RE

               will not execute until after execution of any OpenCL commands preceding the
               <b>clEnqueueReleaseGLObjects</b> which affect or access any of those memory objects. If a non-NULL <u>event</u>
               object is returned, it will report completion before execution of such OpenGL commands.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Release OpenCL memory objects that have been created from OpenGL objects. These objects need to be
       released before they can be used by OpenGL. The OpenGL objects are released by the OpenCL context
       associated with <u>command_queue</u>.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       In order to ensure data integrity, the application is responsible for synchronizing access to shared
       CL/GL objects by their respective APIs. Failure to provide such synchronization may result in race
       conditions and other undefined behavior including non-portability between implementations.

       Prior to calling <b>clEnqueueAcquireGLObjects</b>, the application must ensure that any pending GL operations
       which access the objects specified in <u>mem_objects</u> have completed. This may be accomplished portably by
       issuing and waiting for completion of a <b>glFinish</b> command on all GL contexts with pending references to
       these objects. Implementations may offer more efficient synchronization methods; for example on some
       platforms calling <b>glFlush</b> may be sufficient, or synchronization may be implicit within a thread, or there
       may be vendor-specific extensions that enable placing a fence in the GL command stream and waiting for
       completion of that fence in the CL command queue. Note that no synchronization methods other than
       <b>glFinish</b> are portable between OpenGL implementations at this time.

       Similarly, after calling <b>clEnqueueReleaseGLObjects</b>, the application is responsible for ensuring that any
       pending OpenCL operations which access the objects specified in <u>mem_objects</u> have completed prior to
       executing subsequent GL commands which reference these objects. This may be accomplished portably by
       calling <b><a href="../man3clc/clWaitForEvents.3clc.html">clWaitForEvents</a></b>(3clc) with the event object returned by <b>clEnqueueReleaseGLObjects</b>, or by calling
       <b><a href="../man3clc/clFinish.3clc.html">clFinish</a></b>(3clc). As above, some implementations may offer more efficient methods.

       The application is responsible for maintaining the proper order of operations if the CL and GL contexts
       are in separate threads.

       If a GL context is bound to a thread other than the one in which <b>clEnqueueReleaseGLObjects</b> is called,
       changes to any of the objects in <u>mem_objects</u> may not be visible to that context without additional steps
       being taken by the application. For an OpenGL 3.1 (or later) context, the requirements are described in
       Appendix D ("Shared Objects and Multiple Contexts") of the OpenGL 3.1 Specification. For prior versions
       of OpenGL, the requirements are implementation-dependent.

       Attempting to access the data store of an OpenGL object after it has been acquired by OpenCL and before
       it has been released will result in undefined behavior. Similarly, attempting to access a shared CL/GL
       object from OpenCL before it has been acquired by the OpenCL command queue, or after it has been
       released, will result in undefined behavior.

       If the <b><a href="../man3clc/cl_khr_gl_event.3clc.html">cl_khr_gl_event</a></b>(3clc) extension is supported, then the OpenCL implementation will ensure that any
       such pending OpenGL operations are complete for an OpenGL context bound to the same thread as the OpenCL
       context. This is referred to as implicit synchronization.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>clEnqueueReleaseGLObjects</b> returns CL_SUCCESS if the function is executed successfully. If <u>num_objects</u> is
       0 and <u>mem_objects</u> is NULL the function does nothing and returns CL_SUCCESS. Otherwise, it returns one of
       the following errors:

       •   CL_INVALID_VALUE if <u>num_objects</u> is zero and <u>mem_objects</u> is not a NULL value or if <u>num_objects</u> &gt; 0 and
           <u>mem_objects</u> is NULL.

       •   CL_INVALID_MEM_OBJECT if memory objects in <u>mem_objects</u> are not valid OpenCL memory objects.

       •   CL_INVALID_COMMAND_QUEUE if <u>command_queue</u> is not a valid command-queue.

       •   CL_INVALID_CONTEXT if context associated with <u>command_queue</u> was not created from an OpenGL context.

       •   CL_INVALID_GL_OBJECT if memory objects in <u>mem_objects</u> have not been created from a GL object(s).

       •   CL_INVALID_EVENT_WAIT_LIST if <u>event_wait_list</u> is NULL and <u>num_events_in_wait_list</u> &gt; 0, or
           <u>event_wait_list</u> is not NULL and <u>num_events_in_wait_list</u> is 0, or if event objects in <u>event_wait_list</u>
           are not valid events.

       •   CL_OUT_OF_RESOURCES if there is a failure to allocate resources required by the OpenCL implementation
           on the device.

       •   CL_OUT_OF_HOST_MEMORY if there is a failure to allocate resources required by the OpenCL
           implementation on the host.
