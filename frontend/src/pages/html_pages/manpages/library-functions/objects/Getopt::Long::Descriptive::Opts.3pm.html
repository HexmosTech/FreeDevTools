</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Getopt::Long::Descriptive::Opts - object representing command line switches

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 0.116

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This class is the base class of all $opt objects returned by Getopt::Long::Descriptive.  In general, you
       do not want to think about this class, look at it, or alter it.  Seriously, it's pretty dumb.

       Every call to "describe_options" will return a object of a new subclass of this class.  It will have a
       method for the canonical name of each option possible given the option specifications.

       Method names beginning with an single underscore are public, and are named that way to avoid conflict
       with automatically generated methods.  Methods with multiple underscores (in case you're reading the
       source) are private.

</pre><h4><b>PERL</b> <b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This library should run on perls released even a long time ago.  It should work on any version of perl
       released in the last five years.

       Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made that the minimum required version
       will not be increased.  The version may be increased for any reason, and there is no promise that patches
       will be accepted to lower the minimum required perl.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Achtung!</b>  All methods beginning with an underscore are experimental as of today, 2009-12-12.  They are
       likely to be formally made permanent soon.

   <b>_specified</b>
       This method returns true if the given name was specified on the command line.

       For example, if @ARGS was ""--foo --bar 10"" and "baz" is defined by a default, "_specified" will return
       true for foo and bar, and false for baz.

   <b>_specified_opts</b>
       This method returns an opt object in which only explicitly specified values are defined.  Values which
       were set by defaults will appear undef.

   <b>_complete_opts</b>
       This method returns the opts object with all values, including those set by defaults.  It is probably not
       going to be very often-used.
