</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Test::MockObject::Extends - mock part of an object or class

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Some::Class;
         use Test::MockObject::Extends;

         # create an object to mock
         my $object      = Some::Class-&gt;new();

         # wrap that same object with a mocking wrapper
         $object         = Test::MockObject::Extends-&gt;new( $object );

         # now chain mock and control calls
         $object-&gt;set_true( 'parent_method' )
                -&gt;set_always( -grandparent_method =&gt; 1 )
                -&gt;clear();

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Test::MockObject::Extends lets you mock one or more methods of an existing object or class. This can be
       very handy when you're testing a well-factored module that does almost exactly what you want. Wouldn't it
       be handy to take control of a method or two to make sure you receive testable results?  Now you can.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       "new( $object | $class )"
           "new()"  takes  one optional argument, the object or class to mock. If you're mocking a method for an
           object that holds internal state, create an appropriate object, then pass  it  to  this  constructor.
           <b>NOTE:</b> this will modify the object in place.

           If  you're mocking an object that does not need state, as in the cases where there's no internal data
           or you'll only be calling class methods, or where you'll be mocking all of  the  access  to  internal
           data, you can pass in the name of the class to mock partially.

           If  you've  not  yet  loaded  the  class, this method will try to load it for you.  This may fail, so
           beware.

           If you pass no arguments, it will assume you really  meant  to  create  a  normal  "Test::MockObject"
           object and will oblige you.

           Note  that if you pass a class, the object returned will appear to be an instance of that class; <u>this</u>
           <u>does</u> <u>not</u> <u>mock</u> <u>the</u> <u>class</u> <u>itself</u>.

       "mock( $methodname, $sub_ref )"
           See the documentation for Test::MockObject for all of the ways to mock methods and to retrieve method
           logging information. These methods return the invocant, so you can chain them.

       "unmock( $methodname )"
           Removes any active mocking of the named method. This means any calls to  that  method  will  hit  the
           method  of  that  name in the class being mocked, if it exists. This method returns the invocant, you
           can chain it.

       "isa( $class )"
           As you'd expect from a mocked object, this will return true for the class it's mocking.

</pre><h4><b>INTERNAL</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       To do its magic, this module uses several internal methods:

       •   "check_class_loaded( $parent_class )"

           This verifies that you have the mockee defined. If not, it attempts to load the corresponding  module
           for you.

       •   "gen_autoload( $extended )"

           Returns  an  AUTOLOAD  subroutine for the mock object that checks that the extended object (or class)
           can perform the requested method, that Test::MockObject can perform it, or that  the  parent  has  an
           appropriate AUTOLOAD of its own. (It should have its own "can()" in that case too though.)

       •   "gen_can( $extended )"

           Returns   a  "can()"  method  for  the  mock  object  that  respects  the  same  execution  order  as
           "gen_autoload()".

       •   "gen_isa( $extended )"

           Returns an "isa()" method for the mock object that claims to be the $extended object appropriately.

       •   "gen_get_parents( $extended )"

           Returns a "__get_parents()" method for the mock  object  that  claims  to  be  the  $extended  object
           appropriately.

       •   "gen_package( $extended )"

           Creates a new unique package for the mock object with the appropriate methods already installed.

       •   "get_class( $invocant )"

           Returns the class name of the invocant, whether it's an object or a class name.

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
       There  may  be some weird corner cases with dynamically generated methods in the mocked class. You really
       should use subroutine declarations though, or at least set "can()" appropriately.

       There are also potential name collisions with methods in this module or "Test::MockObject",  though  this
       should be rare.
