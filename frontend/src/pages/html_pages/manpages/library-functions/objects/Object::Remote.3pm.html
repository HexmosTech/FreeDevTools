</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Object::Remote - Call methods on objects in other processes or on other hosts

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       Creating a connection:

         use Object::Remote;

         my $conn = Object::Remote-&gt;connect('myserver'); # invokes ssh

       Calling a subroutine:

         my $capture = IPC::System::Simple-&gt;can::on($conn, 'capture');

         warn $capture-&gt;('uptime');

       Using an object:

         my $eval = Eval::WithLexicals-&gt;new::on($conn);

         $eval-&gt;eval(q{my $x = `uptime`});

         warn $eval-&gt;eval(q{$x});

       Importantly: 'myserver' only requires perl 5.8+ - no non-core modules need to be installed on the far
       side, Object::Remote takes care of it for you!

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Object::Remote allows you to create an object in another process - usually one running on another machine
       you can connect to via ssh, although there are other connection mechanisms available.

       The idea here is that in many cases one wants to be able to run a piece of code on another machine, or
       perhaps many other machines - but without having to install anything on the far side.

</pre><h4><b>COMPONENTS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Object::Remote</b>
       The "main" API, which provides the "connect" method to create a connection to a remote process/host,
       "new::on" to create an object on a connection, and "can::on" to retrieve a subref over a connection.

   <b>Object::Remote::Connection</b>
       The object representing a connection, which provides the "remote_object" in Object::Remote::Connection
       and "remote_sub" in Object::Remote::Connection methods that are used by "new::on" and "can::on" to return
       proxies for objects and subroutines on the far side.

   <b>Object::Remote::Future</b>
       Code for dealing with asynchronous operations, which provides the "start::method" in
       Object::Remote::Future syntax for calling a possibly asynchronous method without blocking, and
       "await_future" in Object::Remote::Future and "await_all" in Object::Remote::Future to block until an
       asynchronous call completes or fails.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>connect</b>
         my $conn = Object::Remote-&gt;connect('-'); # fork()ed connection

         my $conn = Object::Remote-&gt;connect('myserver'); # connection over ssh

         my $conn = Object::Remote-&gt;connect('user@myserver'); # connection over ssh

         my $conn = Object::Remote-&gt;connect('root@'); # connection over sudo

   <b>new::on</b>
         my $eval = Eval::WithLexicals-&gt;new::on($conn);

         my $eval = Eval::WithLexicals-&gt;new::on('myserver'); # implicit connect

         my $obj = Some::Class-&gt;new::on($conn, %args); # with constructor arguments

   <b>can::on</b>
         my $hostname = Sys::Hostname-&gt;can::on($conn, 'hostname');

         my $hostname = Sys::Hostname-&gt;can::on('myserver', 'hostname');

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       OBJECT_REMOTE_PERL_BIN
           When  starting  a  new Perl interpreter the contents of this environment variable will be used as the
           path to the executable. If the variable is not set the path is 'perl'

       OBJECT_REMOTE_LOG_LEVEL
           Setting this environment variable will enable logging and send all  log  messages  at  the  specified
           level or higher to STDERR. Valid level names are: trace debug verbose info warn error fatal

       OBJECT_REMOTE_LOG_FORMAT
           The format of the logging output is configurable. By setting this environment variable the format can
           be controlled via printf style position variables. See Object::Remote::Logging::Logger.

       OBJECT_REMOTE_LOG_FORWARDING
           Forward  log  events  from  remote connections to the local Perl interpreter. Set to 1 to enable this
           feature which is disabled by default. See Object::Remote::Logging.

       OBJECT_REMOTE_LOG_SELECTIONS
           Space separated list of class names to display logs for if logging output is enabled.  Default  value
           is   "Object::Remote::Logging"   which   selects   all   logs   generated   by  Object::Remote.   See
           Object::Remote::Logging.

</pre><h4><b>KNOWN</b> <b>ISSUES</b></h4><pre>
       Large data structures
           Object::Remote communication is encapsalated with JSON and values passed to remote  objects  will  be
           serialized  with  it.  When  sending  large  data  structures  or  data structures with a lot of deep
           complexity (hashes in arrays in hashes in arrays) the processor  time  and  memory  requirements  for
           serialization  and deserialization can be either painful or unworkable. During times of serialization
           the local or remote nodes will be blocked potentially causing all remote  interpreters  to  block  as
           well under worse case conditions.

           To help deal with this issue it is possible to configure resource ulimits for a Perl interpreter that
           is  executed by Object::Remote. See "Object::Remote::Role::Connector::PerlInterpreter" for details on
           the perl_command attribute.

       User can starve run loop of execution opportunities
           The Object::Remote run loop is responsible for performing I/O and managing timers  in  a  cooperative
           multitasing  way  but  it  can only do these tasks when the user has given control to Object::Remote.
           There are times when Object::Remote must wait for the user to return control  to  the  run  loop  and
           during these times no I/O can be performed and no timers can be executed.

           As  an  end  user  of  Object::Remote  if  you depend on connection timeouts, the watch dog or timely
           results from remote objects then be sure to hand control back to Object::Remote as soon as you can.

       Run loop favors certain filehandles/connections
       High levels of load can starve timers of execution opportunities
           These are issues that only become a problem at large scales. The end result of these  two  issues  is
           quite  similar:  some  remote  objects  may block while the local run loop is either busy servicing a
           different connection or is not executing because control has not yet been returned  to  it.  For  the
           same reasons timers may not get an opportunity to execute in a timely way.

           Internally  Object::Remote uses timers managed by the run loop for control tasks. Under high load the
           timers can be preempted by servicing I/O on the filehandles and execution can  be  severely  delayed.
           This  can  lead  to  connection watchdogs not being updated or connection timeouts taking longer than
           configured.

       Deadlocks
           Deadlocks can  happen  quite  easily  because  of  flaws  in  programs  that  use  Object::Remote  or
           Object::Remote  itself  so  the  "Object::Remote::WatchDog" is available. When used the run loop will
           periodically update the watch dog object on the remote Perl interpreter. If the watch dog goes longer
           than the configured interval with out being updated then it will  terminate  the  Perl  process.  The
           watch dog will terminate the process even if a deadlock condition has occurred.

       Log forwarding at scale can starve timers of execution opportunities
           Currently  log  forwarding  can  be  problematic at large scales. When there is a large amount of log
           events the load produced by log forwarding can be high enough that it  starves  the  timers  and  the
           remote  object  watch  dogs  (if  in use) don't get updated in timely way causing them to erroneously
           terminate the Perl process. If the watch dog is not in use then connection timeouts  can  be  delayed
           but will execute when load settles down enough.

           Because  of  the  load  related  issues  Object::Remote  disables  log  forwarding  by  default.  See
           "Object::Remote::Logging" for information on log forwarding.
