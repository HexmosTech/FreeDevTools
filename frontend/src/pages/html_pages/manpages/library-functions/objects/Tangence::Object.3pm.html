</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       "Tangence::Object" - base class for accessible objects in a "Tangence" server

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This class acts as a base class for the accessible objects in a Tangence server. All the objects actually
       created and made accessible to clients will be subclasses of this one, including internally-created
       objects such as Tangence::Registry.

       These objects are not directly constructed by calling the "new" class method; instead the
       "Tangence::Registry" should be used to construct one.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>destroy</b>
          $obj-&gt;destroy;

       Requests that the object destroy itself, informing all clients that are aware of it. Once they all report
       that they have dropped the object, the object is deconstructed for real.

       Not to be confused with Perl's own "DESTROY" method.

   <b>id</b>
          $id = $obj-&gt;id;

       Returns the object's "Tangence" ID number

   <b>describe</b>
          $description = $obj-&gt;describe;

       Returns a textual description of the object, for internal debugging purposes.  Subclasses are encouraged
       to override this method to return something more descriptive within their domain of interest

   <b>registry</b>
          $registry = $obj-&gt;registry;

       Returns the Tangence::Registry that constructed this object.

   <b>class</b>
          $class = $obj-&gt;class;

       Returns the Tangence::Meta::Class object representing the class of this object.

   <b>can_method</b>
          $method = $obj-&gt;can_method( $name );

       Returns the Tangence::Meta::Method object representing the named method, or "undef" if no such method
       exists.

   <b>can_event</b>
          $event = $obj-&gt;can_event( $name );

       Returns the Tangence::Meta::Event object representing the named event, or "undef" if no such event
       exists.

   <b>can_property</b>
          $property = $obj-&gt;can_property( $name );

       Returns the Tangence::Meta::Property object representing the named property, or "undef" if no such
       property exists.

   <b>fire_event</b>
          $obj-&gt;fire_event( $event, @args );

       Fires the named event on the object. Each event subscription function will be invoked with the given
       arguments.

   <b>subscribe_event</b>
          $id = $obj-&gt;subscribe_event( $event, $callback );

       Subscribes an event-handling callback CODE ref to the named event. When the event is fired by
       "fire_event" this callback will be invoked, being passed the object reference and the event's arguments.

          $callback-&gt;( $obj, @args );

       Returns an opaque ID value that can be used to remove this subscription by calling "unsubscribe_event".

   <b>unsubscribe_event</b>
          $obj-&gt;unsubscribe_event( $event, $id );

       Removes an event-handling callback previously registered with "subscribe_event".

   <b>watch_property</b>
          $id = $obj-&gt;watch_property( $prop, %callbacks );

       Watches a named property for changes, registering a set of callback functions to be invoked when the
       property changes in certain ways. The set of callbacks required depends on the dimension of the property
       being watched.

       For all property types:

          $on_set-&gt;( $obj, $value );

       For hash properties:

          $on_add-&gt;( $obj, $key, $value );
          $on_del-&gt;( $obj, $key );

       For queue properties:

          $on_push-&gt;( $obj, @values );
          $on_shift-&gt;( $obj, $count );

       For array properties:

          $on_push-&gt;( $obj, @values );
          $on_shift-&gt;( $obj, $count );
          $on_splice-&gt;( $obj, $index, $count, @values );
          $on_move-&gt;( $obj, $index, $delta );

       For objset properties:

          $on_add-&gt;( $obj, $added_object );
          $on_del-&gt;( $obj, $deleted_object_id );

       Alternatively, a single callback may be installed that is invoked after any change of the property, being
       passed the new value entirely:

          $on_updated-&gt;( $obj, $value );

       Returns an opaque ID value that can be used to remove this watch by calling "unwatch_property".

   <b>unwatch_property</b>
          $obj-&gt;unwatch_property( $prop, $id );

       Removes the set of callback functions previously registered with "watch_property".
