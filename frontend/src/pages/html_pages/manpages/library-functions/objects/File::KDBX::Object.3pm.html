</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       File::KDBX::Object - A KDBX database object

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 0.906

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       KDBX is an object database. This abstract class represents an object. You should not use this class
       directly but instead use its subclasses:

       •   File::KDBX::Entry

       •   File::KDBX::Group

       There is some functionality shared by both types of objects, and that's what this class provides.

       Each  object can be connected with a File::KDBX database or be disconnected. A disconnected object exists
       in memory but will not be persisted when dumping a database. It is also possible  for  an  object  to  be
       connected  with  a database but not be part of the object tree (i.e. is not the root group or any subroup
       or entry).  A disconnected object or an object not part of the object tree of a database can be added  to
       a database using one of:

       •   "add_entry" in File::KDBX

       •   "add_group" in File::KDBX

       •   "add_entry" in File::KDBX::Group

       •   "add_group" in File::KDBX::Group

       •   "add_historical_entry" in File::KDBX::Entry

       It is possible to copy or move objects between databases, but <b>DO</b> <b>NOT</b> include the same object in more than
       one  database at once or there could be some strange aliasing effects (i.e. changes in one database might
       effect another in unexpected ways). This could lead to difficult-to-debug problems. It is  similarly  not
       safe or valid to add the same object multiple times to the same database. For example:

           my $entry = File::KDBX::Entry-&gt;(title =&gt; 'Whatever');

           # DO NOT DO THIS:
           $kdbx-&gt;add_entry($entry);
           $another_kdbx-&gt;add_entry($entry);

           # DO NOT DO THIS:
           $kdbx-&gt;add_entry($entry);
           $kdbx-&gt;add_entry($entry); # again

       Instead, do this:

           # Copy an entry to multiple databases:
           $kdbx-&gt;add_entry($entry);
           $another_kdbx-&gt;add_entry($entry-&gt;clone);

           # OR move an existing entry from one database to another:
           $another_kdbx-&gt;add_entry($entry-&gt;remove);

</pre><h4><b>ATTRIBUTES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>kdbx</b>
           $kdbx = $object-&gt;kdbx;
           $object-&gt;kdbx($kdbx);

       Get  or  set  the  File::KDBX  instance connected with this object. Throws if the object is disconnected.
       Other object methods might only work if the object is connected to a database  and  so  they  might  also
       throw if the object is disconnected. If you're not sure if an object is connected, try "is_connected".

   <b>uuid</b>
       128-bit UUID identifying the object within the connected database.

   <b>icon_id</b>
       Integer representing a default icon. See ":icon" in File::KDBX::Constants for valid values.

   <b>custom_icon_uuid</b>
       128-bit UUID identifying a custom icon within the connected database.

   <b>tags</b>
       Text string with arbitrary tags which can be used to build a taxonomy.

   <b>previous_parent_group</b>
       128-bit UUID identifying a group within the connected database the previously contained the object.

   <b>last_modification_time</b>
       Date and time when the entry was last modified.

   <b>creation_time</b>
       Date and time when the entry was created.

   <b>last_access_time</b>
       Date and time when the entry was last accessed.

   <b>expiry_time</b>
       Date and time when the entry expired or will expire.

   <b>expires</b>
       Boolean value indicating whether or not an entry is expired.

   <b>usage_count</b>
       The  number of times an entry has been used, which typically means how many times the <b>Password</b> string has
       been accessed.

   <b>location_changed</b>
       Date and time when the entry was last moved to a different parent group.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>new</b>
           $object = File::KDBX::Object-&gt;new;
           $object = File::KDBX::Object-&gt;new(%attributes);
           $object = File::KDBX::Object-&gt;new(\%data);
           $object = File::KDBX::Object-&gt;new(\%data, $kdbx);

       Construct a new KDBX object.

       There is a subtlety to take note of. There is a significant difference between:

           File::KDBX::Entry-&gt;new(username =&gt; 'iambatman');

       and:

           File::KDBX::Entry-&gt;new({username =&gt; 'iambatman'}); # WRONG

       In the first, an empty object is first created and then initialized with whatever <u>attributes</u>  are  given.
       In  the  second,  a  hashref  is blessed and essentially becomes the object. The significance is that the
       hashref key-value pairs will remain as-is so the structure is expected to adhere to the shape  of  a  raw
       <b>Object</b>  (which  varies  based  on the type of object), whereas with the first the attributes will set the
       structure in the correct way (just like using the object accessors / getters / setters).

       The second example isn't <u>generally</u> wrong -- this type of construction is supported for a reason, to allow
       for working with KDBX objects at a low level -- but it is  wrong  in  this  specific  case  only  because
       "{username  =&gt; $str}" isn't a valid raw KDBX entry object. The "username" attribute is really a proxy for
       the "UserName" string, so the equivalent raw entry object should be "{strings =&gt; {UserName =&gt;  {value  =&gt;
       $str}}}". These are roughly equivalent:

           File::KDBX::Entry-&gt;new(username =&gt; 'iambatman');
           File::KDBX::Entry-&gt;new({strings =&gt; {UserName =&gt; {value =&gt; 'iambatman'}}});

       If  this  explanation  went  over  your  head, that's fine. Just stick with the attributes since they are
       typically easier to use correctly and provide the most convenience. If in the future you  think  of  some
       kind  of  KDBX object manipulation you want to do that isn't supported by the accessors and methods, just
       know you <u>can</u> access an object's data directly.

   <b>init</b>
           $object = $object-&gt;init(%attributes);

       Called by the constructor to set attributes. You normally should not call this.

   <b>wrap</b>
           $object = File::KDBX::Object-&gt;wrap($object);

       Ensure that a KDBX object is blessed.

   <b>label</b>
           $label = $object-&gt;label;
           $object-&gt;label($label);

       Get or set the object's label, a text string that can act as a non-unique identifier. For an  entry,  the
       label is its title string. For a group, the label is its name.

   <b>clone</b>
           $object_copy = $object-&gt;clone(%options);
           $object_copy = File::KDBX::Object-&gt;new($object);

       Make  a  clone  of  an object. By default the clone is indeed an exact copy that is connected to the same
       database but not actually included in the object tree (i.e. it has no parent  group).  Some  options  are
       allowed to get different effects:

       •   "new_uuid" - If set, generate a new UUID for the copy (default: false)

       •   "parent" - If set, add the copy to the same parent group, if any (default: false)

       •   "relabel" - If set, append " - Copy" to the object's title or name (default: false)

       •   "entries" - If set, copy child entries, if any (default: true)

       •   "groups" - If set, copy child groups, if any (default: true)

       •   "history" - If set, copy entry history, if any (default: true)

       •   "reference_password"  - Toggle whether or not cloned entry's Password string should be set as a field
           reference to the original entry's Password string (default: false)

       •   "reference_username" - Toggle whether or not cloned entry's UserName string should be set as a  field
           reference to the original entry's UserName string (default: false)

   <b>is_connected</b>
           $bool = $object-&gt;is_connected;

       Determine whether or not an object is connected to a database.

   <b>id</b>
           $string_uuid = $object-&gt;id;
           $string_uuid = $object-&gt;id($delimiter);

       Get the unique identifier for this object as a <b>formatted</b> UUID string, typically for display purposes. You
       could  use  this  to  compare  with  other  identifiers formatted with the same delimiter, but it is more
       efficient to use the raw UUID for that purpose (see "uuid").

       A delimiter can optionally be provided to break  up  the  UUID  string  visually.  See  "format_uuid"  in
       File::KDBX::Util.

   <b>group</b>
           $parent_group = $object-&gt;group;
           $object-&gt;group($parent_group);

       Get or set the parent group to which an object belongs or "undef" if it belongs to no group.

   <b>lineage</b>
           \@lineage = $object-&gt;lineage;
           \@lineage = $object-&gt;lineage($base_group);

       Get  the  direct  line  of ancestors from $base_group (default: the root group) to an object. The lineage
       includes the base group but <u>not</u> the target object. Returns "undef" if the target is not in  the  database
       structure. Returns an empty arrayref is the object itself is a root group.

   <b>remove</b>
           $object = $object-&gt;remove(%options);

       Remove  an  object  from its parent. If the object is a group, all contained objects stay with the object
       and so are removed as well, just like cutting off a branch takes the leafs as well. Options:

       •   "signal" Whether or not to signal the removal to the connected database (default: true)

   <b>recycle</b>
           $object = $object-&gt;recycle;

       Remove an object from its parent and add it to the connected database's recycle bin group.

   <b>recycle_or_remove</b>
           $object = $object-&gt;recycle_or_remove;

       Recycle or remove an object, depending on the connected database's "recycle_bin_enabled"  in  File::KDBX.
       If the object is not connected to a database or is already in the recycle bin, remove it.

   <b>is_recycled</b>
           $bool = $object-&gt;is_recycled;

       Get whether or not an object is in a recycle bin.

   <b>tag_list</b>
           @tags = $entry-&gt;tag_list;

       Get a list of tags, split from "tag" using delimiters ",", ".", ":", ";" and whitespace.

   <b>custom_icon</b>
           $image_data = $object-&gt;custom_icon;
           $image_data = $object-&gt;custom_icon($image_data, %attributes);

       Get  or  set  an  icon  image. Returns "undef" if there is no custom icon set. Setting a custom icon will
       change the "custom_icon_uuid" attribute.

       Custom icon attributes (supported in KDBX4.1 and greater):

       •   "name" - Name of the icon (text)

       •   "last_modification_time" - Just what it says (datetime)

   <b>custom_data</b>
           \%all_data = $object-&gt;custom_data;
           $object-&gt;custom_data(\%all_data);

           \%data = $object-&gt;custom_data($key);
           $object-&gt;custom_data($key =&gt; \%data);
           $object-&gt;custom_data(%data);
           $object-&gt;custom_data(key =&gt; $value, %data);

       Get and set custom data. Custom data is metadata associated with an object. It  is  a  set  of  key-value
       pairs  used to store arbitrary data, usually used by software like plug-ins to keep track of state rather
       than by end users.

       Each data item can have a few attributes associated with it.

       •   "key" - A unique text string identifier used to look up the data item (required)

       •   "value" - A text string value (required)

       •   "last_modification_time" (optional, KDBX4.1+)

   <b>custom_data_value</b>
           $value = $object-&gt;custom_data_value($key);

       Exactly the same as "custom_data" except returns just the custom data's value rather than a structure  of
       attributes. This is a shortcut for:

           my $data = $object-&gt;custom_data($key);
           my $value = defined $data ? $data-&gt;{value} : undef;

   <b>begin_work</b>
           $txn = $object-&gt;begin_work(%options);
           $object-&gt;begin_work(%options);

       Begin a new transaction. Returns a File::KDBX::Transaction object that can be scoped to ensure a rollback
       occurs  if  exceptions  are  thrown.  Alternatively,  if  called  in  void  context,  there  will  be  no
       <b>File::KDBX::Transaction</b> and it  is  instead  your  responsibility  to  call  "commit"  or  "rollback"  as
       appropriate.  It  is  undefined  behavior  to  call  these if a <b>File::KDBX::Transaction</b> exists. Recursive
       transactions are allowed.

       Signals created during a transaction are delayed until all transactions are resolved.  If  the  outermost
       transaction  is  committed,  then  the signals are de-duplicated and delivered. Otherwise the signals are
       dropped.  This means that the KDBX database will not fix broken references or  mark  itself  dirty  until
       after the transaction is committed.

       How it works: With the beginning of a transaction, a snapshot of the object is created. In the event of a
       rollback, the object's data is replaced with data from the snapshot.

       By default, the snapshot is shallow (i.e. does not include subroups, entries or historical entries). This
       means  that  only  modifications  to  the  object  itself  (its  data, fields, strings, etc.) are atomic;
       modifications to subroups etc., including adding or removing items, are auto-committed instantly and will
       persist regardless of the result of the pending transaction. You can override this  for  groups,  entries
       and history independently using options:

       •   "entries" - If set, snapshot entries within a group, deeply (default: false)

       •   "groups" - If set, snapshot subroups within a group, deeply (default: false)

       •   "history" - If set, snapshot historical entries within an entry (default: false)

       For example, if you begin a transaction on a group object using the "entries" option, like this:

           $group-&gt;begin_work(entries =&gt; 1);

       Then  if  you modify any of the group's entries OR add new entries OR delete entries, all of that will be
       undone if the transaction is rolled back. With a  default-configured  transaction,  however,  changes  to
       entries are kept even if the transaction is rolled back.

   <b>commit</b>
           $object-&gt;commit;

       Commit a transaction, making updates to $object permanent. Returns itself to allow method chaining.

   <b>rollback</b>
           $object-&gt;rollback;

       Roll  back  the  most  recent  transaction,  throwing  away  any  updates  to the "object" made since the
       transaction began. Returns itself to allow method chaining.
