</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       UR::Object::Type::AccessorWriter - Helper module for UR::Object::Type responsible for creating accessors
       for properties

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Subroutines within this module actually live in the UR::Object::Type namespace;  this module is just a
       convienent place to collect them.  The class initializer uses these subroutines when it's time to create
       accessor methods for a newly defined class.  Each accessor is implemented by a closure that is then
       assigned a name by Sub::Name and inserted into the defined class's namespace by Sub::Install.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       initialize_direct_accessors
             $classobj-&gt;initialize_direct_accessors();

           This  is the entry point into the accessor writing system.  It inspects each item in the 'has' key of
           the class object's hashref, and creates methods for each property.

       mk_rw_accessor
             $classobj-&gt;mk_rw_accessor($class_name, $accessor_name, $column_name, $property_name, $is_transient);

           Creates a mutable accessor named $accessor_name which stores its value in the $property_name  key  of
           the object's hashref.

       mk_ro_accessor
             $classobj-&gt;mk_ro_accessor($class_name, $accessor_name, $column_name, $property_name);

           Creates a read-only accessor named $accessor_name which retrieves its value in the $property_name key
           of  the object's hashref.  If the method is used as a mutator by passing in a value to the method, it
           will throw an exception with Carp::croak.

       mk_id_based_object_accessor
             $classobj-&gt;mk_id_based_object_accessor($class_name, $accessor_name, $id_by,
                                                    $r_class_name, $where);

           Creates an object accessor named $accessor_name.  It returns objects of type $r_class_name, id-ed  by
           the parameters named in the $id_by arrayref.  $where is an optional  listref of additional filters to
           apply when retrieving objects.

           The behavior of the created accessor depends on the number of parameters passed to it.  For 0 params,
           it  retrieves  the  object  pointed  to by $r_class_name and $id_by.  For 1 param, it looks up the ID
           param values of the passed-in object-parameter, and reassigns value stored in the  $id_by  properties
           of the acted-upon object, effectively acting as a mutator.

           For  more  than  1  param,  the  additional  parameters  are taken as properties/values to filter the
           returned objects on

       mk_indirect_ro_accessor
             $classobj-&gt;mk_indirect_ro_accessor($class_name, $accessor_name, $via, $to, $where);

           Creates a read-only via accessor named $accessor_name.  Its value is obtained by calling  the  object
           accessor  named $via, and then calling the method $to on that object.  The optional $where listref is
           used as additional filters when calling $via.

       mk_indirect_rw_accessor
               $classobj-&gt;mk_indirect_rw_accessor($class_name, $accessor_name, $via, $to,
                                                  $where, $singular_name);

           Creates a via accessor named $accessor_name that is able to change the property it points to with $to
           when called as a mutator.  If the $to property on the remote object is an ID property of  its  class,
           it  deletes  the refered-to object and creates a new one with the appropriate properties.  Otherwise,
           it updates the $to property on the refered-to object.

       mk_calculation_accessor
               $classobj-&gt;mk_calculation_accessor($class_name, $accessor_name, $calculation_src,
                                                  $calculate_from, $params, $is_constant, $column_name);

           Creates a calculated accessor called $accessor_name.  If the $is_constant  flag  is  true,  then  the
           accessor  runs  the calculation once, caches the result, and returns that result for subsequent calls
           to the accessor.

           $calculation_src can be one of: coderef, string containing Perl code, or the name of a  module  under
           UR::Object::Type::AccessorWriter  which  has  a  method  called  "calculate".  If $calculation_src is
           empty, then $accessor_name must be  the  name  of  an  already-existing  subroutine  in  the  class's
           namespace.

       mk_dimension_delegate_accessors
       mk_dimension_identifying_accessor
           These  create  accessors  for  dealing  with  dimension  tables in OLAP-type schemas.  They need more
           documentation.

       mk_rw_class_accessor
             $classobj-&gt;mk_rw_class_accessor($class_name, $accessor_name, $column_name, $is_transient, $variable_value);

           Creates a read-write accessor called $accessor_name which stores its value in a  scalar  captured  by
           the  accessor's  closure.  Since the closure is inserted into the class's namespace, all instances of
           the class share the same closure (and therefore the same scalar), and the property  effectively  acts
           as a class-wide property.

       mk_ro_class_accessor
             $classobj-&gt;mk_ro_class_accessor($class_name, $accessor_name, $column_name, $variable_value);

           Creates  a  read-only accessor called $accessor_name which retrieves its value from a scalar captured
           by the accessor's closure.  The value is initialized to $variable_value.  If called as a mutator,  it
           throws an exception through Carp::croak
