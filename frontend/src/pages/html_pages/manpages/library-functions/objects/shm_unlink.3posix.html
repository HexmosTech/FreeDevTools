</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       shm_unlink — remove a shared memory object (<b>REALTIME</b>)

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;sys/mman.h&gt;

       int shm_unlink(const char *<u>name</u>);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>shm_unlink</u>()  function shall remove the name of the shared memory object named by the string pointed
       to by <u>name</u>.

       If one or more references to the shared memory object exist when the object is unlinked, the  name  shall
       be  removed before <u>shm_unlink</u>() returns, but the removal of the memory object contents shall be postponed
       until all open and map references to the shared memory object have been removed.

       Even if the object continues to exist after the last <u>shm_unlink</u>(), reuse of the name  shall  subsequently
       cause  <u>shm_open</u>()  to  behave as if no shared memory object of this name exists (that is, <u>shm_open</u>() will
       fail if O_CREAT is not set, or will create a new shared memory object if O_CREAT is set).

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       Upon successful completion, a value of zero shall be  returned.   Otherwise,  a  value  of  -1  shall  be
       returned and <u>errno</u> set to indicate the error. If -1 is returned, the named shared memory object shall not
       be changed by this function call.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>shm_unlink</u>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EACCES</b> Permission is denied to unlink the named shared memory object.

       <b>ENOENT</b> The named shared memory object does not exist.

       The <u>shm_unlink</u>() function may fail if:

       <b>ENAMETOOLONG</b>
              The  length  of the <u>name</u> argument exceeds {_POSIX_PATH_MAX} on systems that do not support the XSI
              option or exceeds {_XOPEN_PATH_MAX} on XSI systems, or has a pathname  component  that  is  longer
              than   {_POSIX_NAME_MAX}   on  systems  that  do  not  support  the  XSI  option  or  longer  than
              {_XOPEN_NAME_MAX} on XSI systems.  A call to <u>shm_unlink</u>() with a <u>name</u> argument that  contains  the
              same  shared  memory  object name as was previously used in a successful <u>shm_open</u>() call shall not
              give an <b>[ENAMETOOLONG]</b> error.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       Names of memory objects that were allocated with <u>open</u>() are deleted with <u>unlink</u>() in the  usual  fashion.
       Names of memory objects that were allocated with <u>shm_open</u>() are deleted with <u>shm_unlink</u>().  Note that the
       actual  memory  object  is  not  destroyed  until  the last close and unmap on it have occurred if it was
       already in use.

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>FUTURE</b> <b>DIRECTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       A future version might require the <u>shm_open</u>() and <u>shm_unlink</u>() functions to  have  semantics  similar  to
       normal file system operations.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
