</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       MQdb::DBObject - DESCRIPTION of Object

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       Root class for all objects in MappedQuery toolkit

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Root object for toolkit and all derived subclasses.  All objects in the MappedQuery structure are
       designed to be persisted in a database. Here database is a more broad term and can be considered any
       object persistance systems.  Currently the toolkit works with SQL based systems but object databases or
       custom storage engines are possible.  Provides base common methods used by all objects.

       The rest of the documentation details each of the object methods.  Internal methods are usually preceded
       with a _

   <b>new</b>
         Description: instance creation method
         Returntype : instance of this Class (subclass)
         Exceptions : none

   <b>init</b>
         Description: initialization method which subclasses can extend
         Returntype : $self
         Exceptions : subclass dependent

   <b>copy</b>
         Description: Shallow copy which copies all base attributes of object
                      to new instance of same class
         Returntype : same as calling instance
         Exceptions : subclass dependent

   <b>class</b>
         Description: fixed string symbol for this class. Must be implemented
                      for each subclass and each subclass within toolkit
                      should return a unique name. used by global  methods.
         Returntype : string
         Exceptions : error if subclass does not redefine

   <b>database</b>
         Description: the MQdb::Database where this object is permanently persisted to.
                      Here database is any object persistance system.
         Returntype : MQdb::Database
         Exceptions : die if invalid setter value type is provided

   <b>primary_id</b>
         Description: the unique identifier for this object within database.
         Returntype : scalar or UNDEF
         Exceptions : none

   <b>id</b>
         Description: the unique identifier for this object within database.
                      Returns empty string if not persisted.
         Returntype : scalar or ''
         Exceptions : none

   <b>db_id</b>
         Description: the worldwide unique identifier for this object.
                      A URL-like combination of database, class, and id
         Returntype : string or undef if database is not defined
         Exceptions : none

   <b>display_desc</b>
         Description: general purpose debugging method that returns a nice
                      human readable description of the object instance contents.
                      Each subclass should implement and return a nice string.
         Returntype : string scalar
         Exceptions : none

   <b>display_info</b>
         Description: convenience method which prints the display_desc string
                      with a carriage return to STDOUT. useful for debugging.
         Returntype : none
         Exceptions : none

   <b>xml</b>
         Description: every object in system should be persistable in XML format.
                      returns an XML description of the object and all child objects.
                      Each subclass must implement and return a proper XML string.
                      Best if one implements xml_start() and xml_end() and use here.
         Returntype : string scalar
         Exceptions : none
         Default    : default is a simple xml_start + xml_end

   <b>xml_start</b>
         Description: every object in system should be persistable in XML format.
                      returns an XML description of the object and all child objects.
                      Each subclass should OVERRIDE this method and return a proper XML string.
                      xml_start is the primary XML start tag
         Example    : return sprintf("&lt;feature id='%d' name='%d' ..... &gt;", $id, $name....);
         Returntype : string scalar
         Exceptions : none

   <b>xml_end</b>
         Description: every object in system should be persistable in XML format.
                      returns an XML description of the object and all child objects.
                      Each subclass should OVERRIDE this method and return a proper XML string.
                      xml_end is the primary XML end tag
         Example    : return "&lt;/feature&gt;";
         Returntype : string scalar
         Exceptions : none

   <b>simple_xml</b>
         Description: short hand for xml_start() . xml_end()
                      Can be used when only the primary XML start tag and attributes are needed
                      No need to override if xml_start() and xml_end() are implemented
         Returntype : string scalar
         Exceptions : none
