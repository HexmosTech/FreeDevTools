       MQdb::DBStream - DESCRIPTION of Object

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       A simplified object to manage a collection of information related to streaming data from a database.  at
       least with MYSQL, the perl driver does odd caching so to stream one needs to create a new database
       connection in order to stream

       The rest of the documentation details each of the object methods. Internal methods are labeled.

   <b>set_stream_useresult_behaviour</b>
         Description  : sets a global behaviour for all DBStreams.
                        setting use_result to "on" will leave the results on the database and
                        will keep the database connection open durring streaming.
                        Both methods have similar speed performance, but keeping the results
                        on the database server means the client uses essentially no memory.
                        The risk of turning this on is that the the database connection remains open
                        and there is risk of it timing out if processing takes a long time to stream all data.
                        When turned off, the entire result set is transfered in bulk to the driver (DBD::mysql)
                        and streaming happens from the underlying driver code and the perl code layer.
                        Default is "off" since this is safer but one risks needing lots of memory on the client.
         Parameter[1] : 1 or "y" or "on" turns the use_result on and keeps the database connection open
         Returntype   : none
         Exceptions   : none
         Example      : MQdb::DBStream-&gt;<a href="../man1/set_stream_useresult_behaviour.1.html">set_stream_useresult_behaviour</a>(1);

   <b>next_in_stream</b>
         Description: gets the next object in the stream. If the stream is empty it return undef.
         Returntype : instance of the defined DBStream::stream_class, or undef
         Exceptions : none
         Example    :
                       my $stream = WorldKit::Person-&gt;stream_all_by_country_region($db, "USA", "wisconsin");
                       while(my $person = $stream-&gt;next_in_stream) {
                         #do something
                       }

   <b>as_array</b>
         Description: instantiates all remaining instances in the stream and returns them as an array
         Returntype : reference to array of instances of the defined class of this stream
         Exceptions : none
         Example    :
                       my $stream = WorldKit::Person-&gt;stream_all_by_country_region($db, "USA", "wisconsin");
                       my $all_people = $stream-&gt;as_array;  #because I have a large memory machine and need them all in memory
                       foreach my $person (@$all_people) {
                         #do something
                       }

   <b>stream_database</b>
         Description: this is an internal system method.
                      Needs to have two database connections open, one for the active
                      stream handle, and one for lazy-loading additional data on the returned
                      objects.  This is used to set the database which is the one streaming objects
         Arg (1)    : $database (MQdb::Database) for setting
         Returntype : MQdb::Database
         Exceptions : none
         Callers    :  MQdb::MappedQuery

   <b>stream_class</b>
         Description: this is an internal system method.
                      Set/get the class used for creation of objects on this stream.
                      The class must be a subclass of MQdb::MappedQuery
         Arg (1)    : $class (must be subclass of MQdb::MappedQuery) for setting
         Returntype : a class which is a subclass of  MQdb::MappedQuery
         Exceptions : none
         Callers    :  MQdb::MappedQuery

   <b>prepare</b>
         Description: this is an internal system method.  It is used to set the SQL query used
                      to stream objects out of a database.  Must be have stream_class() set
                      to a subclass of MappedQuery which implements the mapRow() method.
         Returntype : $self
         Exceptions : none
         Callers    :  MQdb::MappedQuery
