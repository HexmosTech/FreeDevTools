       Object::Remote::Role::Connector::PerlInterpreter - Role for connections to a Perl interpreter

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Object::Remote;

         my %opts = (
           perl_command =&gt; [qw(nice -n 10 perl -)],
           watchdog_timeout =&gt; 120, stderr =&gt; \*STDERR,
         );

         my $local_connection = Object::Remote-&gt;connect('-', %opts);
         my $hostname = Sys::Hostname-&gt;can::on($remote, 'hostname');

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This is the role that supports connections to a Perl interpreter that is executed in a different process.
       The new Perl interpreter can be either on the local or a remote machine and is configurable via arguments
       passed to the constructor.

</pre><h4><b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       perl_command
           By  default the Perl interpreter will be executed as "perl -" but this can be changed by providing an
           array reference as the value to the perl_command attribute during construction.

       stderr
           If this value is defined then it will be used as the file handle that receives the output  of  STDERR
           from the Perl interpreter process and I/O will be performed by the run loop in a non-blocking way. If
           the  value is undefined then STDERR of the remote process will be connected directly to STDERR of the
           local process with out the run loop managing I/O. The default value is undefined.

           There are a few ways to use this feature. By default the behavior  is  to  form  one  unified  STDERR
           across all of the Perl interpreters including the local one. For small scale and quick operation this
           offers  a  predictable  and easy to use way to get at error messages generated anywhere. If the local
           Perl interpreter crashes then the remote Perl interpreters still have an  active  STDERR  and  it  is
           possible to still receive output from them. This is generally a good thing but can cause issues.

           When  using  a  file  handle  as  the  output for STDERR once the local Perl interpreter is no longer
           running there is no longer a valid STDERR for the remote interpreters to send  data  to.  This  means
           that it is no longer possible to receive error output from the remote interpreters and that the shell
           will  start  to kill off the child processes. Passing a reference to STDERR for the local interpreter
           (as the SYNOPSIS shows) causes the  run  loop  to  manage  I/O,  one  unified  STDERR  for  all  Perl
           interpreters  that  ends  as  soon  as  the  local interpreter process does, and the shell will start
           killing children when the local interpreter exits.

           It is also possible to pass in a file handle that has been opened for writing. This would  be  useful
           for logging the output of the remote interpreter directly into a dedicated file.

       watchdog_timeout
           If  this value is defined then it will be used as the number of seconds the watchdog will wait for an
           update before it terminates the Perl interpreter process. The default value is undefined and will not
           use the watchdog. See "Object::Remote::Watchdog" for more information.
