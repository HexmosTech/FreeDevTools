</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Object::Declare - Declarative object constructor

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 0.25

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Object::Declare ['MyApp::Column', 'MyApp::Param'];

           my %objects = declare {

           param foo =&gt;
              !is global,
               is immutable,
               valid_values are qw( more values );

           column bar =&gt;
               field1 is 'value',
               field2 is 'some_other_value',
               sub_params are param( is happy ), param ( is sad );

           };

           print $objects{foo}; # a MyApp::Param object
           print $objects{bar}; # a MyApp::Column object

           # Assuming that MyApp::Column::new simply blesses into a hash...
           print $objects{bar}{sub_params}[0]; # a MyApp::Param object
           print $objects{bar}{sub_params}[1]; # a MyApp::Param object

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module exports one function, "declare", for building named objects with a declarative syntax,
       similar to how Jifty::DBI::Schema defines its columns.

       In list context, "declare" returns a list of name/object pairs in the order of declaration (allowing
       duplicates), suitable for putting into a hash.  In scalar context, "declare" returns a hash reference.

       Using a flexible "import" interface, one can change exported helper functions names (<u>declarator</u>), words
       to link labels and values together (<u>copula</u>), and the table of named classes to declare (<u>mapping</u>):

           use Object::Declare
               declarator  =&gt; ['declare'],     # list of declarators
               copula      =&gt; {                # list of words, or a map
                   is  =&gt; '',                  #  from copula to label prefixes,
                   are =&gt; '',                  #  or to callback that e.g. turns
                   has =&gt; sub { has =&gt; @_ },   #  "has X" to "has is X" and
                                               #  "X has 1" to "has is [X =&gt; 1]"
               },
               aliases     =&gt; {                # list of label aliases:
                   more =&gt; 'less',             #  turns "is more" into "is less"
                                               #  and "more is 1" into "less is 1"
               },
               mapping     =&gt; {
                   column =&gt; 'MyApp::Column',  # class name to call -&gt;new to
                   param  =&gt; sub {             # arbitrary coderef also works
                       bless(\@_, 'MyApp::Param');
                   },
               };

       After the declarator block finishes execution, all helper functions are removed from the package.  Same-
       named functions (such as &amp;is and &amp;are) that existed before the declarator's execution are restored
       correctly.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       If you export the declarator to another package via @EXPORT, be sure to export all mapping keys as well.
       For example, this will work for the example above:

           our @EXPORT = qw( declare column param );

       But this will not:

           our @EXPORT = qw( declare );

       The copula are not turned into functions, so there is no need to export them.
