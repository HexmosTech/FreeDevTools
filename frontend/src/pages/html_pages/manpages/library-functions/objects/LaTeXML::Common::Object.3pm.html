</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       "LaTeXML::Common::Object" - abstract base class for most LaTeXML objects.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       "LaTeXML::Common::Object" serves as an abstract base class for all other objects (both the data objects
       and control objects).  It provides for common methods for stringification and comparison operations to
       simplify coding and to beautify error reporting.

   <b>Generic</b> <b>functions</b>
       "$string = Stringify($object);"
           Returns  a  string  identifying $object, for debugging.  Works on any values and objects, but invokes
           the stringify method on blessed objects.  More informative than the  default  perl  conversion  to  a
           string.

       "$string = ToString($object);"
           Converts  $object  to string attempting, when possible, to generate straight text without TeX markup.
           This is most useful for converting Tokens or Boxes to document content or attribute values, or values
           to be used for pathnames, keywords, etc.   Generally, however, it is not possible to convert Whatsits
           generated by Constructors into clean strings, without TeX markup.  Works on any values  and  objects,
           but invokes the toString method on blessed objects.

       "$boolean = Equals($x,$y);"
           Compares  the  two  objects  for  equality.   Works on any values and objects, but invokes the equals
           method on blessed objects, which does a deep comparison of the two objects.

       "$tokens = Revert($object);"
           Returns a Tokens list containing  the  TeX  that  would  create  $object.   Note  that  this  is  not
           necessarily the original TeX code; expansions or other substitutions may have taken place.

   <b>Methods</b>
       "$string = $object-&gt;stringify;"
           Returns a readable representation of $object, useful for debugging.

       "$string = $object-&gt;toString;"
           Returns  the  string  content  of $object; most useful for extracting a clean, usable, Unicode string
           from tokens or boxes that might representing a filename or such.  To the extent possible, this should
           provide a string that can be used as XML content, or attribute values, or for filenames or  whatever.
           However, control sequences defined as Constructors may leave TeX code in the value.

       "$boole = $object-&gt;equals($other);"
           Returns  whether  $object  and  $other  are equal.  Should perform a deep comparison, but the default
           implementation just compares for object identity.

       "$boole = $object-&gt;isaToken;"
           Returns whether $object is an LaTeXML::Core::Token.

       "$boole = $object-&gt;isaBox;"
           Returns whether $object is an LaTeXML::Core::Box.

       "$boole = $object-&gt;isaDefinition;"
           Returns whether $object is an LaTeXML::Core::Definition.

       "$digested = $object-&gt;beDigested;"
           Does whatever is needed to digest the object, and return the digested representation.   Tokens  would
           be digested into boxes; Some objects, such as numbers can just return themselves.

       "$object-&gt;beAbsorbed($document);"
           Do  whatever  is  needed  to absorb the $object into the $document, typically by invoking appropriate
           methods on the $document.
