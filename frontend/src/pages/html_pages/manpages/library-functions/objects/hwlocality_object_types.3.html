   <b>enum</b> <b>hwloc_obj_type_t</b>
       Type of topology object.

       <b>Note</b>
           Do not rely on the ordering or completeness of the values as new ones may be defined in  the  future!
           If you need to compare types, use <b>hwloc_compare_types()</b> instead.

       <b>Enumerator</b>

       <u>HWLOC_OBJ_MACHINE</u>
              Machine.  A  set  of  processors and memory with cache coherency. This type is always used for the
              root object of a topology, and never used anywhere else. Hence its parent is always NULL.

       <u>HWLOC_OBJ_PACKAGE</u>
              Physical package.  The  physical  package  that  usually  gets  inserted  into  a  socket  on  the
              motherboard. A processor package usually contains multiple cores, and possibly some dies.

       <u>HWLOC_OBJ_CORE</u>
              Core. A computation unit (may be shared by several PUs, aka logical processors).

       <u>HWLOC_OBJ_PU</u>
              Processing  Unit,  or  (Logical)  Processor.  An  execution unit (may share a core with some other
              logical processors, e.g. in the case of an SMT core). This is the smallest object representing CPU
              resources, it cannot have any child except Misc objects.

       Objects of this kind are always reported and can thus be used as fallback when others are not.

       <u>HWLOC_OBJ_L1CACHE</u>
              Level 1 Data (or Unified) Cache.

       <u>HWLOC_OBJ_L2CACHE</u>
              Level 2 Data (or Unified) Cache.

       <u>HWLOC_OBJ_L3CACHE</u>
              Level 3 Data (or Unified) Cache.

       <u>HWLOC_OBJ_L4CACHE</u>
              Level 4 Data (or Unified) Cache.

       <u>HWLOC_OBJ_L5CACHE</u>
              Level 5 Data (or Unified) Cache.

       <u>HWLOC_OBJ_L1ICACHE</u>
              Level 1 instruction Cache (filtered out by default).

       <u>HWLOC_OBJ_L2ICACHE</u>
              Level 2 instruction Cache (filtered out by default).

       <u>HWLOC_OBJ_L3ICACHE</u>
              Level 3 instruction Cache (filtered out by default).

       <u>HWLOC_OBJ_GROUP</u>
              Group objects. Objects which do not fit in the above but are detected by hwloc and are  useful  to
              take  into  account  for  affinity.  For  instance,  some operating systems expose their arbitrary
              processors aggregation this way. And hwloc may insert such objects to group NUMA  nodes  according
              to  their  distances.  See  also  <b>What</b>  <b>are</b> <b>these</b> <b>Group</b> <b>objects</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>topology?</b>. These objects are
              removed when they do not bring any structure (see <b>HWLOC_TYPE_FILTER_KEEP_STRUCTURE</b>).

       <u>HWLOC_OBJ_NUMANODE</u>
              NUMA node. An object that contains memory  that  is  directly  and  byte-accessible  to  the  host
              processors.  It  is  usually close to some cores (the corresponding objects are descendants of the
              NUMA node object in the hwloc tree). This is the smallest object representing Memory resources, it
              cannot have any child except Misc objects. However it may have Memory-side cache parents.

       NUMA nodes may correspond to different kinds of memory (DRAM, HBM, CXL-DRAM, etc.). When hwloc is able to
       guess that kind, it is specified in the subtype field of the object. See also <b>Normal</b>  <b>attributes</b>  in  the
       main documentation.

       There is always at least one such object in the topology even if the machine is not NUMA.

       Memory  objects  are  not  listed  in the main children list, but rather in the dedicated Memory children
       list.

       NUMA nodes have a special depth <b>HWLOC_TYPE_DEPTH_NUMANODE</b> instead of  a  normal  depth  just  like  other
       objects in the main tree.

       <u>HWLOC_OBJ_BRIDGE</u>
              Bridge (filtered out by default). Any bridge (or PCI switch) that connects the host or an I/O bus,
              to  another  I/O bus. Bridges are not added to the topology unless their filtering is changed (see
              <b>hwloc_topology_set_type_filter()</b> and <b>hwloc_topology_set_io_types_filter()</b>).

       I/O objects are not listed in the main children list, but rather in the dedicated io children  list.  I/O
       objects have NULL CPU and node sets.

       <u>HWLOC_OBJ_PCI_DEVICE</u>
              PCI  device  (filtered  out  by  default).  PCI devices are not added to the topology unless their
              filtering        is        changed        (see        <b>hwloc_topology_set_type_filter()</b>         and
              <b>hwloc_topology_set_io_types_filter()</b>).

       I/O  objects  are not listed in the main children list, but rather in the dedicated io children list. I/O
       objects have NULL CPU and node sets.

       <u>HWLOC_OBJ_OS_DEVICE</u>
              Operating system device (filtered out by default). OS devices are not added to the topology unless
              their      filtering      is      changed      (see      <b>hwloc_topology_set_type_filter()</b>      and
              <b>hwloc_topology_set_io_types_filter()</b>).

       I/O  objects  are not listed in the main children list, but rather in the dedicated io children list. I/O
       objects have NULL CPU and node sets.

       <u>HWLOC_OBJ_MISC</u>
              Miscellaneous objects (filtered out by default). Objects without particular meaning, that can e.g.
              be added by the application for its own use,  or  by  hwloc  for  miscellaneous  objects  such  as
              MemoryModule  (DIMMs).  They  are not added to the topology unless their filtering is changed (see
              <b>hwloc_topology_set_type_filter()</b>).

       These objects are not listed in the main children list, but rather in the dedicated misc  children  list.
       Misc objects may only have Misc objects as children, and those are in the dedicated misc children list as
       well. Misc objects have NULL CPU and node sets.

       <u>HWLOC_OBJ_MEMCACHE</u>
              Memory-side cache (filtered out by default). A cache in front of a specific NUMA node. This object
              always has at least one NUMA node as a memory child.

       Memory  objects  are  not  listed  in the main children list, but rather in the dedicated Memory children
       list.

       Memory-side cache have a special depth <b>HWLOC_TYPE_DEPTH_MEMCACHE</b> instead of  a  normal  depth  just  like
       other objects in the main tree.

       <u>HWLOC_OBJ_DIE</u>
              Die  within  a  physical package. A subpart of the physical package, that contains multiple cores.
              Some operating systems (e.g. Linux) may expose a single die per package even if the hardware  does
              not  support  dies  at all. To avoid showing such non-existing dies, hwloc will filter them out if
              all   of   them   are   identical   to   packages.   This   is    functionally    equivalent    to
              <b>HWLOC_TYPE_FILTER_KEEP_STRUCTURE</b> being enforced for Dies versus Packages.

</pre><h4><b>Function</b> <b>Documentation</b></h4><pre>
   <b>int</b> <b>hwloc_compare_types</b> <b>(hwloc_obj_type_t</b> <b>type1,</b> <b>hwloc_obj_type_t</b> <b>type2)</b>
       Compare  the  depth of two object types. Types shouldn't be compared as they are, since newer ones may be
       added in the future.

       <b>Returns</b>
           A negative integer if type1 objects usually include type2 objects.

           A positive integer if type1 objects are usually included in type2 objects.

           0 if type1 and type2 objects are the same.

           <b>HWLOC_TYPE_UNORDERED</b> if objects cannot be compared (because  neither  is  usually  contained  in  the
           other).

       <b>Note</b>
           Object  types  containing  CPUs  can  always be compared (usually, a machine contains packages, which
           contain caches, which contain cores, which contain PUs).

           <b>HWLOC_OBJ_PU</b> will always be the deepest, while <b>HWLOC_OBJ_MACHINE</b> is always the highest.

           This does not mean that the actual topology will respect that order: e.g. as of today cores may  also
           contain  caches,  and  packages  may  also  contain nodes. This is thus just to be seen as a fallback
           comparison method.
