       Object::InsideOut::Metadata - Introspection for Object::InsideOut classes

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This document describes Object::InsideOut::Metadata version 4.05

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        package My::Class; {
            use Object::InsideOut;
            use Object::InsideOut::Metadata;

            my @data :Field :Arg('data') :Get('data') :Set('put_data');
            my @misc :Field;

            my %init_args :InitArgs = (
                'INFO' =&gt; '',
            );

            sub _init :Init
            {
                my ($self, $args) = @_;
                if (exists($args-&gt;{'INFO'})) {
                    $misc[$$self] = 'INFO: ' . $args-&gt;{'INFO'};
                }
            }

            sub misc :lvalue :Method
            {
                my $self = shift;
                $misc[$$self];
            }
            add_meta(__PACKAGE__, 'misc', { 'lvalue' =&gt; 1 });
        }

        package main;

        # Obtain a metadata object for a class
        my $meta = My::Class-&gt;meta();

        # ... or obtain a metadata object for an object
        my $obj = My::Class-&gt;new();
        my $meta = $obj-&gt;meta();

        # Obtain the class hierarchy from the metadata object
        my @classes = $meta-&gt;get_classes();

        # Obtain information on the parameters for a class's construction
        my %args = $meta-&gt;get_args();

        # Obtain information on a class's methods
        my %methods = $meta-&gt;get_methods();

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Object::InsideOut provides an introspection API that allows you to obtain metadata on a class's
       hierarchy, constructor parameters, and methods.  This is done through the use of metadata objects that
       are generated by this class.

       In addition, developers can specify metadata data for methods they write for their classes.

</pre><h4><b>METADATA</b> <b>OBJECT</b></h4><pre>
       To obtain metadata on an Object::InsideOut class or object, you must first generate a metadata object for
       that class or object.  Using that metadata object, one can then obtain information on the class
       hierarchy, constructor parameters, and methods.

       my $meta = My::Class-&gt;<b>meta()</b>;
       my $meta = $obj-&gt;<b>meta()</b>;
           The   "-&gt;meta()"   method,  which  is  exported  by  Object::InsideOut  to  each  class,  returns  an
           Object::InsideOut::Metadata object which can then be <u>queried</u> for information about the invoking class
           or invoking object's class.

</pre><h4><b>CLASS</b> <b>HIERARCHY</b></h4><pre>
       Any Object::InsideOut class potentially has four categories of classes associated with it:

       1.  Object::InsideOut
           While the basis for all Object::InsideOut classes it is not an object class per se  because  you  can
           create    objects    from    it    (i.e.,    you   can't   do   "Object::InsideOut-"<b>new()</b>&gt;).    While
           "My::Class-"isa('Object::InsideOut')&gt; will return <u>true</u>, because Object::InsideOut is  not  an  object
           class, it is not considered to be part of a class's hierarchy.

       2.  The class itself
           A class's hierarchy always includes itself.

       3.  Parent classes
           These are all the Object::InsideOut classes up the inheritance tree that a class is derived from.

       4.  Foreign classes
           These are non-Object::InsideOut classes that a class inherits from.  (See "FOREIGN CLASS INHERITANCE"
           in Object::InsideOut.)  Because of implementation details, foreign classes do not appear in a class's
           @ISA  array.   However,  Object::InsideOut  implements  a  version  of "-&gt;isa()" that handles foreign
           classes.

       A class's hierarchy consists of any classes in the latter three categories.

       $meta-&gt;<b>get_classes()</b>;
           When called in an array context, returns a list that constitutes the class hierarchy for the class or
           object used to generate the metadata object.  When called in a scalar context, returns an array ref.

       My::Class-&gt;<b>isa()</b>;
       $obj-&gt;<b>isa()</b>;
           When called in an array context, calling "-&gt;isa()" without  any  arguments  on  an  Object::InsideOut
           class or object returns a list of the classes in the class hierarchy for that class or object, and is
           equivalent to:

            my @classes = $obj-&gt;meta()-&gt;get_classes();

           When called in a scalar context, it returns an array ref containing the classes.

</pre><h4><b>CONSTRUCTOR</b> <b>PARAMETERS</b></h4><pre>
       Constructor parameters are the arguments given to a class's "-&gt;new()" call.

       $meta-&gt;<b>get_args()</b>;
           Returns a hash (hash ref in scalar context) containing information on the parameters that can be used
           to construct an object from the class associated with the metadata object.  Here's an example of such
           a hash:

            {
                'My::Class' =&gt; {
                    'data' =&gt; {
                        'field' =&gt; 1,
                        'type' =&gt; 'numeric',
                    },
                    'misc' =&gt; {
                        'mandatory' =&gt; 1,
                    },
                },
                'My::Parent' =&gt; {
                    'info' =&gt; {
                        'default' =&gt; '&lt;none&gt;',
                    },
                },
            }

           The keys for this hash are the Object::IsideOut classes in the class hierarchy.  These <u>class</u> <u>keys</u> are
           paired with hash refs, the keys of which are the names of the parameters for that class (e.g., 'data'
           and  'misc'  for  My::Class, and 'info' for My::Parent).  The hashes paired to the parameters contain
           information about the parameter:

           field
               The parameter corresponds directly to a class field, and is automatically processed during object
               creation.  See "Field-Specific Parameters" in Object::InsideOut.

           mandatory
               The parameter is required for object creation.  See "Mandatory Parameters" in Object::InsideOut.

           default
               The default value assigned to the parameter if it is not found in  the  arguments  to  "-&gt;new()".
               See "Default Values" in Object::InsideOut.

           preproc
               The  code  ref for the subroutine that is used to <u>preprocess</u> a parameter's value.  See "Parameter
               Preprocessing" in Object::InsideOut

           type
               The form of type checking performed on the parameter.  See "TYPE CHECKING"  in  Object::InsideOut
               for more details.

               'numeric'
                   Parameter takes a numeric value as recognized by <b>Scalar::Util::looks_like_number()</b>.

               'list'
               'list(_subtype_)'
                   Parameter takes a single value (which is then placed in an array ref) or an array ref.

                   When specified, the contents of the resulting array ref must be of the specified subtype:

                   'numeric'
                       Same as for the basic type above.

                   A class name
                       Same as for the basic type below.

                   A reference type
                       Any reference type as returned by <b>ref()</b>).

               'ARRAY(_subtype_)'
                   Parameter takes an array ref with contents of the specified subtype as per the above.

               A class name
                   Parameter  takes  an  object of a specified class, or one of its sub-classes as recognized by
                   "-&gt;isa()".

               Other reference type
                   Parameter takes a reference of the specified type as returned by <b>ref()</b>.

               A code ref
                   Parameter takes a value that is type-checked by the code ref paired to the 'type' key.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b> <b>METADATA</b></h4><pre>
       The methods returned by a metadata object are those that are currently  available  at  the  time  of  the
       "-&gt;get_methods()" call.

       The presence of ":Automethod" subroutines in an Object::InsideOut class, or "AUTOLOAD" in a foreign class
       means that the methods supported by the class may not be determinable.  The presence of "AUTOLOAD" in the
       list  of  methods  for a class should alert the programmer to the fact that more methods may be supported
       than are listed.

       Methods that are excluded are private  and  hidden  methods  (see  "PERMISSIONS"  in  Object::InsideOut),
       methods  that  begin  with  an underscore (which, by convention, means they are private), and subroutines
       named "CLONE", "CLONE_SKIP", and "DESTROY" (which are not methods).  While technically a method, "import"
       is also excluded as it is generally not invoked directly (i.e., it's usually called as part of "use").

       $meta-&gt;<b>get_methods()</b>;
           Returns a hash (hash ref in scalar context) containing information  on  the  methods  for  the  class
           associated with the metadata object.  The keys in the hash are the method names.  Paired to the names
           are hash refs containing metadata about the methods.  Here's an example:

            {
                # Methods exported by Object::InsideOut
                'new' =&gt; {
                   'class' =&gt; 'My::Class',
                   'kind'  =&gt; 'constructor'
                },
                'clone' =&gt; {
                    'class' =&gt; 'My::Class',
                    'kind'  =&gt; 'object'
                },
                'meta'  =&gt; {
                    'class' =&gt; 'My::Class'
                },
                'set' =&gt; {
                    'class' =&gt; 'My::Class',
                    'kind'  =&gt; 'object',
                    'restricted' =&gt; 1
                },
                # Methods provided by Object::InsideOut
                'dump' =&gt; {
                    'class' =&gt; 'Object::InsideOut',
                    'kind'  =&gt; 'object'
                },
                'pump' =&gt; {
                    'class' =&gt; 'Object::InsideOut',
                    'kind'  =&gt; 'class'
                },
                'inherit' =&gt; {
                    'class' =&gt; 'Object::InsideOut',
                    'kind'  =&gt; 'object',
                    'restricted' =&gt; 1
                },
                'heritage' =&gt; {
                    'class' =&gt; 'Object::InsideOut',
                    'kind'  =&gt; 'object',
                    'restricted' =&gt; 1
                },
                'disinherit' =&gt; {
                    'class' =&gt; 'Object::InsideOut',
                    'kind'  =&gt; 'object',
                    'restricted' =&gt; 1
                },
                # Methods generated by Object::InsideOut for My::Class
                'set_data' =&gt; {
                    'class'  =&gt; 'My::Class',
                    'kind'   =&gt; 'set',
                    'type'   =&gt; 'ARRAY',
                    'return' =&gt; 'new'
                },
                'get_data' =&gt; {
                    'class' =&gt; 'My::Class',
                    'kind'  =&gt; 'get'
                }
                # Class method provided by My::Class
                'my_method' =&gt; {
                    'class' =&gt; 'My::Class',
                    'kind'  =&gt; 'class'
                }
            }

           Here are the method metadata that are provided:

           class
               The  class  in whose symbol table the method resides.  The method may reside in the classes code,
               it may be exported by another class, or it may be generated by Object::InsideOut.

               Methods that are overridden in child classes are represented as being associated  with  the  most
               junior class for which they appear.

           kind
               Designation of the <u>characteristic</u> of the method:

               constructor
                   The "-&gt;new()" method, of course.

               get, set or accessor
                   A  <u>get</u>,  <u>set</u>, or <u>combined</u> accessor generated by Object::InsideOut.  See "AcCESSOR GENERATION"
                   in Object::InsideOut.

               cumulative, or cumulative (bottom up)
               chained, or chained (bottom up)
                   A cumulative or chained method.  See "CUMULATIVE METHODS" in Object::InsideOut, and  "CHAINED
                   METHODS"  in  Object::InsideOut.   The class associated with these methods is the most junior
                   class in which they appears.

               class
                   A method that is callable only on a class (e.g., "My::Class-&gt;my_method()").

               object
                   A method that is callable only on a object (e.g. "$obj-&gt;get_data()").

               foreign
                   A subroutine found in a foreign class's symbol table.  Programmers  must  check  the  class's
                   documentation to determine which are actually methods, and what kinds of methods they are.

               overload
                   A  subroutine  used  for  object  coercion.   These may be called as methods, but this is not
                   normally how they are used.

               automethod
                   Associated with an  AUTOLOAD  method  for  an  Object::InsideOut  class  that  implements  an
                   ":Automethod" subroutine.  See "AUTOMETHODS" in Object::InsideOut.

           type
               The   type   checking   that  is  done  on  arguments  to  <u>set/combined</u>  accessors  generated  by
               Object::InsideOut.  See "TYPE CHECKING" in Object::InsideOut

           return
               The value returned by a <u>set/combined</u> accessor generated by Object::InsideOut.  See "<u>Set</u>  Accessor
               Return Value" in Object::InsideOut

           lvalue
               The method is an :lvalue accessor.

           restricted
               The  method is <u>restricted</u> (i.e., callable only from within the class hierarchy; not callable from
               application code).  See "PERMISSIONS" in Object::InsideOut.

       My::Class-&gt;<b>can()</b>;
       $obj-&gt;<b>can()</b>;
           When called in an array context, calling "-&gt;can()" without  any  arguments  on  an  Object::InsideOut
           class or object returns a list of the method names for that class or object, and is equivalent to:

            my %meths = $obj-&gt;meta()-&gt;get_methods();
            my @methods = keys(%meths);

           When called in a scalar context, it returns an array ref containing the method names.

   <b>METADATA</b> <b>ATTRIBUTES</b>
       Class  authors  may add the ":Method" attribute to subroutines in their classes to specifically designate
       them as OO-callable methods.  If a method is only a <u>class</u> method or only an <u>object</u> method,  this  may  be
       added as a parameter to the attribute:

        sub my_method :Method(class)
        {
            ...

       The  <u>class</u>  or  <u>object</u>  parameter  will  appear  in  the  metadata  for  the  method  when  listed  using
       "-&gt;get_methods()".

       <b>CAUTION:</b>  Be sure not to use ":method" (all lowercase) except as appropriate (see  "ARGUMENT  VALIDATION"
       in Object::InsideOut) as this is a Perl reserved attribute.

       The  ":Sub"  attribute  can  be  used  to  designate subroutines that are not OO-callable methods.  These
       subroutines will not show up as part of the methods listed by "-&gt;get_methods()", etc..

       Subroutine names beginning with an underscore are, by convention, considered private, and will  not  show
       up as part of the methods listed by "-&gt;get_methods()", etc..

   <b>ADDING</b> <b>METADATA</b>
       Class  authors  may  add  additional metadata to their methods using the "add_meta()" subroutine which is
       exported by this package.  For example, if the class implements it own ":lvalue" method,  it  should  add
       that metadata so that it is picked up the "-&gt;get_methods()":

        package My::Class; {
            use Object::InsideOut;
            use Object::InsideOut::Metadata;

            sub my_method :lvalue :Method(object)
            {
                ....
            }
            add_meta(__PACKAGE__, 'my_method', 'lvalue', 1);
        }

       The arguments to "add_meta()" are:

       Class name
           This can usually be designated using the special literal C__PACKAGE__&gt;.

       Method name
       Metadata name
           This  can  be  any of the metadata names under "METHODS METADATA", or can be whatever additional name
           the programmer chooses to implement.

       Metadata value

       When adding multiple metadata for a method, they may be enclosed in a single hash ref:

        add_meta(__PACKAGE__, 'my_method', { 'lvalue' =&gt; 1,
                                             'return' =&gt; 'old' });

       If adding metadata for multiple methods, another level of hash may be used:

        add_meta(__PACKAGE__, { 'my_method' =&gt; { 'lvalue' =&gt; 1,
                                                 'return' =&gt; 'old' },
                                'get_info'  =&gt; { 'my_meta' =&gt; 'true' } });
