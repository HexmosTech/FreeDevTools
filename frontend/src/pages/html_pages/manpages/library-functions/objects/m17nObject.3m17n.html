       m17nObject_-_Managed_Ob -  - Objects managed by the reference count

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Data</b> <b>Structures</b>
       struct <b>M17NObjectHead</b>
           The first member of a managed object.

   <b>Functions</b>
       void * <b>m17n_object</b> (int size, void(*freer)(void *))
       int <b>m17n_object_ref</b> (void *object)
           Increment the reference count of a managed object.
       int <b>m17n_object_unref</b> (void *object)
           Decrement the reference count of a managed object.

</pre><h4><b>Detailed</b> <b>Description</b></h4><pre>
       Objects managed by the reference count

       Managed objects are objects managed by the reference count.

       There are some types of m17n objects that are managed by their reference count. Those objects are called
       <u>managed</u> <u>objects</u>. When created, the reference count of a managed object is initialized to one. The
       <b>m17n_object_ref()</b> function increments the reference count of a managed object by one, and the
       <b>m17n_object_unref()</b> function decrements by one. A managed object is automatically freed when its
       reference count becomes zero.

       A property whose key is a managing key can have only a managed object as its value. Some functions, for
       instance <b>msymbol_put()</b> and <b>mplist_put()</b>, pay special attention to such a property.

       In addition to the predefined managed object types, users can define their own managed object types. See
       the documentation of the <b>m17n_object()</b> for more details.
