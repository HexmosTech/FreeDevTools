</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Rose::Object::MixIn - A base class for mix-ins.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         package MyMixInClass;

         use Rose::Object::MixIn(); # Use empty parentheses here
         our @ISA = qw(Rose::Object::MixIn);

         __PACKAGE__-&gt;export_tag(all =&gt; [ qw(my_cool_method my_other_method) ]);

         sub my_cool_method  { ... }
         sub my_other_method { ... }
         ...

         package MyClass;
         # Import methods my_cool_method() and my_other_method()
         use MyMixInClass qw(:all);
         ...

         package MyOtherClass;
         # Import just my_cool_method()
         use MyMixInClass <a href="../manmy_cool_method/qw.my_cool_method.html">qw</a>(my_cool_method);
         ...

         package YetAnotherClass;
         # Import just my_cool_method() as cool()
         use MyMixInClass { my_cool_method =&gt; 'cool' }

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Rose::Object::MixIn is a base class for mix-ins.  A mix-in is a class that exports methods into another
       class.  This export process is controlled with an Exporter-like interface, but Rose::Object::MixIn does
       not inherit from Exporter.

       When you use a Rose::Object::MixIn-derived class, its import method is called at compile time.  In other
       words, this:

           use Rose::Object::MixIn 'a', 'b', { c =&gt; 'd' };

       is the same thing as this:

           BEGIN { Rose::Object::MixIn-&gt;import('a', 'b', { c =&gt; 'd' }) }

       To prevent the import method from being run, put empty parentheses "()" after the package name instead of
       a list of arguments.

           use Rose::Object::MixIn();

       See the synopsis for an example of when this is handy: using Rose::Object::MixIn from within a subclass.
       Note that the empty parenthesis are important.  The following is <u>not</u> equivalent:

           # This is not the same thing as the example above!
           use Rose::Object::MixIn;

       See the documentation for the import method below to learn what arguments it accepts.

</pre><h4><b>CLASS</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>import</b> <b>ARGS</b>
           Import  the  methods  specified  by  ARGS into the package from which this method was called.  If the
           current class can already perform one of these methods, a fatal error will  occur.   To  override  an
           existing method, you must use the "-force" argument (see below).

           Valid formats for ARGS are as follows:

           •   <b>A</b> <b>method</b> <b>name</b>

               Literal method names will be imported as-is.

           •   <b>A</b> <b>tag</b> <b>name</b>

               Tags  names  are indicated with a leading colon.  For example, ":all" specifies the "all" tag.  A
               tag is a stand-in for a list of methods.  See the export_tag method to learn how to create tags.

           •   <b>A</b> <b>reference</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>hash</b>

               Each key/value pair in this hash contains a method name and the name that it will be imported as.
               Use this feature to import methods under  different  names  in  order  to  avoid  conflicts  with
               existing methods.

           •   "-force"

               The special literal argument "-force" will cause the specified methods to be imported even if the
               calling class can already perform one or more of those methods.

           •   "-target_class CLASS"

               The  special  literal  argument "-target-class" followed by a class name will cause the specified
               methods to be imported into CLASS rather than into the calling class.

           See the synopsis for several examples of  the  import  method  in  action.   (Remember,  it's  called
           implicitly  when you use a Rose::Object::MixIn-derived class with anything other than an empty set of
           parenthesis "()" as an argument.)

       <b>clear_export_tags</b>
           Delete the entire list of export tags.

       <b>export_tag</b> <b>NAME</b> <b>[,</b> <b>ARRAYREF]</b>
           Get or set the list of method names associated with a tag.  The tag name  should  <u>not</u>  begin  with  a
           colon.  If ARRAYREF is passed, then the list of methods associated with the specific tag is set.

           Returns a list (in list context) or a reference to an array (in scalar context) of method names.  The
           array  reference  return  value  should  be  treated  as read-only.  If no such tag exists, and if an
           ARRAYREF is not passed, then a fatal error will occur.

       <b>export_tags</b>
           Returns a list (in list context) and a reference to an  array  (in  scalar  context)  containing  the
           complete list of export tags.  The array reference return value should be treated as read-only.
