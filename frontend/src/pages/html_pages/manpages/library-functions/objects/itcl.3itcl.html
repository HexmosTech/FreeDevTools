       itcl - object-oriented extensions to Tcl
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>[incr</b> <b>Tcl]</b> provides object-oriented extensions to Tcl, much as C++ provides object-oriented extensions to
       C.   The  emphasis  of  this  work,  however,  is  not  to create a whiz-bang object-oriented programming
       environment.  Rather, it is to support more structured programming practices in Tcl without changing  the
       flavor  of  the  language.  More than anything else, <b>[incr</b> <b>Tcl]</b> provides a means of encapsulating related
       procedures together with their shared data in a namespace that is hidden  from  the  outside  world.   It
       encourages  better  programming  by  promoting the object-oriented "library" mindset.  It also allows for
       code re-use through inheritance.

</pre><h4><b>CLASSES</b></h4><pre>
       The fundamental construct in <b>[incr</b> <b>Tcl]</b> is the class definition.  Each  class  acts  as  a  template  for
       actual  objects  that  can  be  created.   Each  object has its own unique bundle of data, which contains
       instances of the "variables" defined in the class.  Special  procedures  called  "methods"  are  used  to
       manipulate  individual  objects.   Methods  are  just  like the operations that are used to manipulate Tk
       widgets.  The "<b>button</b>" widget, for example, has methods  such  as  "flash"  and  "invoke"  that  cause  a
       particular button to blink and invoke its command.

       Within the body of a method, the "variables" defined in the class are automatically available.  They need
       not  be  declared  with  anything  like the <b>global</b> command.  Within another class method, a method can be
       invoked like any other command-simply by using its name.  From any other context, the method name must be
       prefaced by an object name, which provides a context for the data that the method can access.

       Each class has its own namespace containing things that are common to all objects  which  belong  to  the
       class.   For  example,  "common"  data  members  are shared by all objects in the class.  They are global
       variables that exist in the class namespace, but since they are included in the  class  definition,  they
       need  not be declared using the <b>global</b> command; they are automatically available to any code executing in
       the class context.  A class can also create ordinary global variables, but these must be  declared  using
       the <b>global</b> command each time they are used.

       Classes  can  also  have ordinary procedures declared as "procs".  Within another class method or proc, a
       proc can be invoked like any other command-simply by  using  its  name.   From  any  other  context,  the
       procedure  name should be qualified with the class namespace like "<u>className</u><b>::</b><u>proc</u>".  Class procs execute
       in the class context, and therefore have automatic access to all "common" data  members.   However,  they
       cannot  access  object-specific  "variables",  since  they  are invoked without reference to any specific
       object.  They are usually used to perform generic operations which affect all objects  belonging  to  the
       class.

       Each  of the elements in a class can be declared "public", "protected" or "private".  Public elements can
       be accessed by the class, by derived classes (other classes that inherit this  class),  and  by  external
       clients  that  use  the  class.  Protected elements can be accessed by the class, and by derived classes.
       Private elements are only accessible in the class where they are defined.

       The "public" elements within a class define its interface to the external world.  Public  methods  define
       the  operations  that  can  be  used  to  manipulate  an  object.   Public  variables  are  recognized as
       configuration options by the "configure" and "cget" methods that are built into each class.   The  public
       interface  says  <u>what</u>  an object will do but not <u>how</u> it will do it.  Protected and private members, along
       with the bodies of  class  methods  and  procs,  provide  the  implementation  details.   Insulating  the
       application  developer  from  these  details  leaves  the class designer free to change them at any time,
       without warning, and  without  affecting  programs  that  rely  on  the  class.   It  is  precisely  this
       encapsulation that makes object-oriented programs easier to understand and maintain.

       The  fact that <b>[incr</b> <b>Tcl]</b> objects look like Tk widgets is no accident.  <b>[incr</b> <b>Tcl]</b> was designed this way,
       to blend naturally into a Tcl/Tk application.  But <b>[incr</b> <b>Tcl]</b> extends the Tk paradigm from  being  merely
       object-based  to  being  fully object-oriented.  An object-oriented system supports inheritance, allowing
       classes to share common behaviors by inheriting them from an ancestor or base class.  Having a base class
       as a common abstraction allows a programmer to treat related classes in a similar manner.  For example, a
       toaster and a blender perform different (specialized) functions, but both share the abstraction of  being
       appliances.   By  abstracting  common behaviors into a base class, code can be <u>shared</u> rather than <u>copied</u>.
       The resulting application is easier to understand and maintain, and derived  classes  (e.g.,  specialized
       appliances) can be added or removed more easily.

       This  description  was  merely  a  brief  overview of object-oriented programming and <b>[incr</b> <b>Tcl]</b>.  A more
       tutorial introduction is presented in the paper included with this distribution.  See the  <b>class</b>  command
       for more details on creating and using classes.

</pre><h4><b>NAMESPACES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>[incr</b> <b>Tcl]</b>  now  includes  a  complete  namespace  facility.  A namespace is a collection of commands and
       global variables that is kept apart from the usual global scope.  This allows Tcl code  libraries  to  be
       packaged  in a well-defined manner, and prevents unwanted interactions with other libraries.  A namespace
       can also have child namespaces within it, so one library can contain its own private copy of  many  other
       libraries.   A namespace can also be used to wrap up a group of related classes.  The global scope (named
       "::") is the root namespace for an interpreter; all other namespaces are contained within it.

       See the <b>namespace</b> command for details on creating and using namespaces.

</pre><h4><b>MEGA-WIDGETS</b></h4><pre>
       Mega-widgets are high-level widgets that are constructed using Tk widgets  as  component  parts,  usually
       without  any  C  code.  A fileselectionbox, for example, may have a few listboxes, some entry widgets and
       some control buttons.  These individual widgets are put together in a way that makes them  act  like  one
       big widget.

       <b>[incr</b> <b>Tk]</b>  is  a framework for building mega-widgets.  It uses <b>[incr</b> <b>Tcl]</b> to support the object paradigm,
       and adds base classes which provide default widget behaviors.  See the <b>itk</b> man page for more details.

       <b>[incr</b> <b>Widgets]</b> is a library of mega-widgets built using <b>[incr</b> <b>Tk]</b>.  It contains more  than  30  different
       widget classes that can be used right out of the box to build Tcl/Tk applications.  Each widget class has
       its own man page describing the features available.
