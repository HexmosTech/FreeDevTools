</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Rose::DB::Object::MakeMethods::Std - Create object methods related to Rose::DB::Object::Std-derived
       objects.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         package Category;
         our @ISA = qw(Rose::DB::Object::Std);
         ...

         package Color;
         our @ISA = qw(Rose::DB::Object::Std);
         ...

         package Product;
         our @ISA = qw(Rose::DB::Object);
         ...

         use Rose::DB::Object::MakeMethods::Std
         (
           object_by_id =&gt;
           [
             color =&gt; { class =&gt; 'Color' },

             category =&gt;
             {
               class     =&gt; 'Category',
               id_method =&gt; 'cat_id',
               share_db  =&gt; 0,
             },
           ],
         );

         ...

         $prod = Product-&gt;new(...);

         $color = $prod-&gt;color;

         # $prod-&gt;color call is roughly equivalent to:
         #
         # $color = Color-&gt;new(id =&gt; $prod-&gt;color_id,
         #                     db =&gt; $prod-&gt;db);
         # $ret = $color-&gt;load;
         # return $ret  unless($ret);
         # return $color;

         $cat = $prod-&gt;category;

         # $prod-&gt;category call is roughly equivalent to:
         #
         # $cat = Category-&gt;new(id =&gt; $prod-&gt;cat_id);
         # $ret = $cat-&gt;load;
         # return $ret  unless($ret);
         # return $cat;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       "Rose::DB::Object::MakeMethods::Std" creates methods related to Rose::DB::Object::Std-derived objects.
       It inherits from Rose::Object::MakeMethods.  See the Rose::Object::MakeMethods documentation to learn
       about the interface.  The method types provided by this module are described below.

       All method types defined by this module are designed to work with objects that are subclasses of (or
       otherwise conform to the interface of) Rose::DB::Object.  In particular, the object is expected to have a
       "db" method that returns a Rose::DB-derived object.  See the Rose::DB::Object::Std documentation for more
       details.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b> <b>TYPES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>object_by_id</b>
           Create  a get/set methods for a single Rose::DB::Object::Std-derived object loaded based on a primary
           key stored in an attribute of the current object.

           Options
               "class"
                   The name of the Rose::DB::Object::Std-derived class of the object to be loaded.  This  option
                   is required.

               "hash_key"
                   The  key  inside the hash-based object to use for the storage of the object.  Defaults to the
                   name of the method.

               "id_method"
                   The name of the method that contains the primary key of the object to be loaded.  Defaults to
                   the method name concatenated with "_id".

               "interface"
                   Choose the interface.  The only current interface is "get_set", which is the default.

               "share_db"
                   If true, the "db" attribute of the current object is shared with the object loaded.  Defaults
                   to true.

           Interfaces
               "get_set"
                   Creates a method that will attempt to create and load a Rose::DB::Object::Std-derived  object
                   based on a primary key stored in an attribute of the current object.

                   If  passed  a  single  argument  of  undef, the "hash_key" used to store the object is set to
                   undef.  Otherwise, the argument is assumed to be an object of type "class" and is assigned to
                   "hash_key" after having its primary key set to the corresponding value in the current object.

                   If called with no arguments and the "hash_key" used to  store  the  object  is  defined,  the
                   object is returned.  Otherwise, the object is created and loaded.

                   The  load  may  fail for several reasons.  The load will not even be attempted if the primary
                   key attribute in the current object is undefined.  Instead, undef will be returned.   If  the
                   call to the newly created object's "load" method returns false, that false value is returned.

                   If the load succeeds, the object is returned.

           Example:

               package Category;
               our @ISA = qw(Rose::DB::Object::Std);
               ...

               package Color;
               our @ISA = qw(Rose::DB::Object::Std);
               ...

               package Product;
               our @ISA = qw(Rose::DB::Object);
               ...

               use Rose::DB::Object::MakeMethods::Std
               (
                 object_by_id =&gt;
                 [
                   color =&gt; { class =&gt; 'Color' },

                   category =&gt;
                   {
                     class     =&gt; 'Category',
                     id_method =&gt; 'cat_id',
                     share_db  =&gt; 0,
                   },
                 ],
               );

               ...

               $prod = Product-&gt;new(...);

               $color = $prod-&gt;color;

               # $prod-&gt;color call is roughly equivalent to:
               #
               # $color = Color-&gt;new(id =&gt; $prod-&gt;color_id,
               #                     db =&gt; $prod-&gt;db);
               # $ret = $color-&gt;load;
               # return $ret  unless($ret);
               # return $color;

               $cat = $prod-&gt;category;

               # $prod-&gt;category call is roughly equivalent to:
               #
               # $cat = Category-&gt;new(id =&gt; $prod-&gt;cat_id);
               # $ret = $cat-&gt;load;
               # return $ret  unless($ret);
               # return $cat;
