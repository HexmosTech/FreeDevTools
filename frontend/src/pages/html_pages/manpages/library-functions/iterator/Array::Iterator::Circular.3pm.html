</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       Version 0.135

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Array::Iterator::Circular;

         # create an instance with a
         # small array
         my $color_iterator = Array::Iterator::Circular-&gt;new(qw(red green blue orange));

         # this is a large list of
         # arbitrary items
         my @long_list_of_items = ( ... );

         # as we loop through the items ...
         foreach my $item (@long_list_of_items) {
             # we assign color from our color
             # iterator, which will keep dispensing
             # as it loops through its set
             $item-&gt;set_color($color_iterator-&gt;next());
         }

         # tell us how many times the set
         # was looped through
         print $color_iterator-&gt;get_loop_count();

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This iterator will loop continuosly as long as "next" or "get_next" is called. The "has_next" method will
       always return true (1), since the list will always loop back. This is useful when you need a list to
       repeat itself, but don't want to (or care to) know that it is doing so.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       This is a subclass of Array::Iterator, only those methods that have been added or altered are documented
       here, refer to the Array::Iterator documentation for more information.

       <b>has_next</b>
           Since we endlessly loop, this will always return true (1).

       <b>next</b>
           This  will  return the next item in the array, and when it reaches the end of the array, it will loop
           back to the beginning again.

       <b>get_next</b>
           This method is now defined in terms of "next", since neither will even stop dispensing  items,  there
           is no need to differentiate.

       <b>is_start</b>
           If  at  anytime  during  your  looping, you want to know if you have arrived back at the start of you
           list, you can ask this method.

       <b>is_end</b>
           If at anytime during your looping, you want to know if you have gotten to the end of  you  list,  you
           can ask this method.

       <b>get_loop_count</b>
           This method will tell you how many times the iterator has looped back to its start.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       This is a subclass of <b>Array::Iterator</b>, please refer to it for more documentation.
