       history - Manipulate the history list

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>history</b> ?<u>option</u>? ?<u>arg</u> <u>arg</u> <u>...</u>?
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>history</b> command performs one of several operations related to recently-executed commands recorded in
       a history list.  Each of these recorded commands is referred to as an “event”.  When specifying an  event
       to the <b>history</b> command, the following forms may be used:

       [1]    A  number:  if positive, it refers to the event with that number (all events are numbered starting
              at 1).  If the number is negative, it selects an event relative to the current event (<b>-1</b> refers to
              the previous event, <b>-2</b> to the one before that, and so on).  Event <b>0</b> refers to the current event.

       [2]    A string:  selects the most recent event that matches the string.  An event is considered to match
              the string either if the string is the same as the first characters of the event, or if the string
              matches the event in the sense of the <b>string</b> <b>match</b> command.

       The <b>history</b> command can take any of the following forms:

       <b>history</b>
              Same as <b>history</b> <b>info</b>, described below.

       <b>history</b> <b>add</b> <u>command</u> ?<b>exec</b>?
              Adds the <u>command</u> argument to the  history  list  as  a  new  event.   If  <b>exec</b>  is  specified  (or
              abbreviated)  then  the  command  is  also  executed  and  its result is returned.  If <b>exec</b> is not
              specified then an empty string is returned as result.

       <b>history</b> <b>change</b> <u>newValue</u> ?<u>event</u>?
              Replaces the value recorded for an event with <u>newValue</u>.  <u>Event</u> specifies the event to replace, and
              defaults to the <u>current</u> event (not event <b>-1</b>).  This command is intended for use in  commands  that
              implement  new  forms of history substitution and wish to replace the current event (which invokes
              the substitution) with the command created through substitution.  The return  value  is  an  empty
              string.

       <b>history</b> <b>clear</b>
              Erase the history list.  The current keep limit is retained.  The history event numbers are reset.

       <b>history</b> <b>event</b> ?<u>event</u>?
              Returns the value of the event given by <u>event</u>.  <u>Event</u> defaults to <b>-1</b>.

       <b>history</b> <b>info</b> ?<u>count</u>?
              Returns  a formatted string (intended for humans to read) giving the event number and contents for
              each of the events in the history list except the current event.  If <u>count</u> is specified then  only
              the most recent <u>count</u> events are returned.

       <b>history</b> <b>keep</b> ?<u>count</u>?
              This  command  may  be used to change the size of the history list to <u>count</u> events.  Initially, 20
              events are retained in the history list.  If <u>count</u> is not specified, the  current  keep  limit  is
              returned.

       <b>history</b> <b>nextid</b>
              Returns  the number of the next event to be recorded in the history list.  It is useful for things
              like printing the event number in command-line prompts.

       <b>history</b> <b>redo</b> ?<u>event</u>?
              Re-executes the command indicated by <u>event</u> and returns its result.  <u>Event</u> defaults  to  <b>-1</b>.   This
              command results in history revision:  see below for details.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b> <b>REVISION</b></h4><pre>
       Pre-8.0 Tcl had a complex history revision mechanism.  The current mechanism is more limited, and the old
       history  operations  <b>substitute</b>  and <b>words</b> have been removed.  (As a consolation, the <b>clear</b> operation was
       added.)

       The history option <b>redo</b> results in much simpler “history revision”.  When this option is invoked then the
       most recent event is modified to eliminate the <b>history</b> command and replace it  with  the  result  of  the
       <b>history</b> command.  If you want to redo an event without modifying history, then use the <b>event</b> operation to
       retrieve some event, and the <b>add</b> operation to add it to history and execute it.
