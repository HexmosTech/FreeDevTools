</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       HTML::FormFu::Plugin - base class for plugins

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 2.07

   <b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       Plugins can be added to a form or any element to modify their behaviour.  Some plugins should only be
       added to either a form, or an element, depending on their design.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       Plugins can override any of the following method stubs.

   <b>process</b>
       Only plugins added to a form or a field element inheriting from HTML::FormFu::Role::Element::Field will
       have their "process" method run.

       For form plugins, is called during "process" in HTML::FormFu, before "process" is called on any elements.

       For field plugins, is called during the field's "process" call.

   <b>pre_process</b>
       For form plugins, is called immediately after "pre_process" is run on the elements.

       For element plugins, is called before "pre_process" is run on form plugins.

   <b>post_process</b>
       For form plugins, is called immediately before "process" in HTML::FormFu returns.

       For element plugins, is called before "post_process" is run on form plugins.

   <b>render</b>
       Only plugins added to a form will have their "render" method run.

       Is called during "render" in HTML::FormFu before the "render_method" in HTML::FormFu is called.

   <b>post_render</b>
       Only plugins added to a form will have their "post_render" method run.

       Is called during "render" in HTML::FormFu immediately before "render" in HTML::FormFu return.

       Is passed a reference to the return value of "render_method" in HTML::FormFu.
