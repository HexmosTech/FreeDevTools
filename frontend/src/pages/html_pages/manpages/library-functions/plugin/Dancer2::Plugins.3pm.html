</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Dancer2::Plugins - Recommended Dancer2 plugins

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 1.1.2

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Dancer2 aims to keep the core as small as possible, but there are a growing number of useful plugins to
       add helpful features.

       This document provides a quick summary of some recommended plugins.

   <b>Plugins</b>
       Dancer2::Plugin::Adapter
           Wrap any simple class as a service for Dancer2.

       Dancer2::Plugin::Ajax
           Provides easy way to add Ajax route handlers.

       Dancer2::Plugin::Auth::Tiny
           Provides  an  extremely  simple  way  of requiring that a user be logged in before allowing access to
           certain routes.

       Dancer2::Plugin::BrowserDetect
           Provides an easy to have info of the browser. keyword within your Dancer application.

       Dancer2::Plugin::Cache::CHI
           Provides caching for generated pages and/or arbitrary data.   Uses  CHI,  so  is  backend-agnostic  -
           caching can be done in memory, to files, using Memcache, in a database, or any other method for which
           there is a CHI::Driver module.

       Dancer2::Plugin::Database
           Provides easy database access via DBI, reading the DB connection details from your app's config file,
           and  taking  care  of  ensuring  the  connection  is  still  valid and reconnecting if not (useful in
           persistent environments).  Just calling the "database" keyword gives  you  a  connected  and  working
           database  handle. It also provides some helpful keywords to make inserting/updating data as simple as
           it should be.

       Dancer2::Plugin::DBIC
           Provides easy access to DBIx::Class database virtualization.

       Dancer2::Plugin::Deferred
           Provides a method for deferring a one-time message across  a  redirect.  It  is  similar  to  "flash"
           messages,  but  without  the  race conditions that can result from multiple tabs in a browser or from
           AJAX requests.

       Dancer2::Plugin::Emailesque
           Provides easy email-sending powered by Email::Send - simply call the "email" keyword.  Email  sending
           settings can be taken from your app's config.

       Dancer2::Plugin::Feed
           Provides an easy way to generate RSS or Atom feed.

       Dancer2::Plugin::Paginator
           Dancer2 plugin for Paginator::Lite.

       Dancer2::Plugin::Queue
           Provides a generic interface to a message queue.

       Dancer2::Plugin::Queue::MongoDB
           A Dancer2::Plugin::Queue using MongoDBx::Queue.

       Dancer2::Plugin::REST
           Makes writing RESTful web services easy.

       Dancer2::Plugin::RoutePodCoverage
           Plugin to verify pod coverage in our app routes.

       Dancer2::Plugin::Syntax::GetPost
           Provides very simple syntactic sugar to define a handler for GET and POST requests.

   <b>Session</b> <b>Engines</b>
       Dancer2::Session::Cookie
           A session factory for Dancer2 that stores session state within a browser cookie.

       More  plugins are appearing on CPAN all the time - just search for "Dancer2::Plugin" to see what may have
       been released since this document was last updated!
