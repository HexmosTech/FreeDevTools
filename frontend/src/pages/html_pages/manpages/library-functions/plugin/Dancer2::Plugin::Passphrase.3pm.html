</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Dancer2::Plugin::Passphrase - Passphrases and Passwords as objects for Dancer2

</pre><h4><b>DEPRECATION</b> <b>WARNING</b></h4><pre>
       <b>NOTE:</b> This module is DEPRECATED, and it is advised that you switch to Dancer2::Plugin::CryptPassphrase if
       possible.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       This plugin manages the hashing of passwords for Dancer2 apps, allowing developers to follow cryptography
       best practices without having to become a cryptography expert.

       It uses the bcrypt algorithm as the default, while also supporting any hashing function provided by
       Digest.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
           package MyWebService;
           use Dancer2;
           use Dancer2::Plugin::Passphrase;

           post '/login' =&gt; sub {
               my $phrase = passphrase( param('my password') )-&gt;generate;

               # $phrase is now an object that contains RFC 2307 representation
               # of the hashed passphrase, along with the salt, and other metadata

               # You should store $phrase-&gt;rfc2307() for use later
           };

           get '/protected' =&gt; sub {
               # Retrieve $stored_rfc_2307_string, like we created above.
               # IT MUST be a valid RFC 2307 string

               if ( passphrase( param('my password') )-&gt;matches( $stored_rfc_2307 ) ) {
                   # Passphrase matches!
               }
           };

           get '/generate_new_password' =&gt; sub {
               return passphrase-&gt;generate_random;
           };

</pre><h4><b>NOTE</b></h4><pre>
       This package does no checking about how secure the password is, minimum length or anything, including a
       length of 0 being valid.  You can add extra checks in your "MyWebService".

</pre><h4><b>AUTO</b> <b>STRINGIFICATION</b> <b>IS</b> <b>REMOVED</b></h4><pre>
       You must use $phrase-&gt;<b>rfc2307()</b> to get a text string.

</pre><h4><b>KEYWORDS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>passphrase</b>
       Given a plaintext password, it returns a Dancer2::Plugin::Passphrase::Core object that you can generate a
       new hash from, or match against a stored hash.

</pre><h4><b>MAIN</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>generate</b>
       Generates an RFC 2307 representation of the hashed passphrase that is suitable for storage in a database.

           my $phrase = passphrase('my passphrase')-&gt;generate;

       It returns a Dancer2::Plugin::Passphrase::Hashed object.

       You should store "$phrase-&gt;rfc_2307()" in your database.

       Accepts a hashref of options to specify what kind of hash should be generated. All options settable in
       the config file are valid.

       If you specify only the algorithm, the default settings for that algorithm will be used.

       A cryptographically random salt is used if salt is not defined.  Only if you specify the empty string
       will an empty salt be used.  This is not recommended, and should only be used to upgrade old insecure
       hashes.

           my $phrase = passphrase('my password')-&gt;generate(
               {
                   algorithm  =&gt; $algo_name,   # override algo from config
                   $algo_name =&gt; {
                       # override options for this algorithm
                       $opt1 =&gt; $value1,
                   },
               }
           );

       So for Bcrypt this might be:

           my $phrase = passphrase('my password')-&gt;generate(
               {
                   algorithm =&gt; 'Bcrypt',
                   Bcrypt   =&gt; {
                       cost =&gt; 14,
                   }
               }
           );

   <b>matches</b>
       Matches a plaintext password against a stored hash.  Returns 1 if the hash of the password matches the
       stored hash.  Returns undef if they don't match or if there was an error Fail-Secure, rather than Fail-
       Safe.

           passphrase('my password')-&gt;matches($stored_rfc_2307_string);

       $stored_rfc_2307_string <b>MUST</b> be a valid RFC 2307 string, as created by <b>generate()</b>

       An RFC 2307 string is made up of a scheme identifier, followed by a base64 encoded string. The base64
       encoded string should contain the password hash and the salt concatenated together - in that order.

           '{'.$scheme.'}'.encode_base64($hash . $salt, '');

       Where $scheme can be any of the following and their unsalted variants, which have the leading S removed.
       CRYPT will be Bcrypt.

           SMD5 SSHA SSHA224 SSHA256 SSHA384 SSHA512 CRYPT

       A complete RFC2307 string looks like this:

           {SSHA}K3LAbIjRL5CpLzOlm3/HzS3qt/hUaGVTYWx0

       This is the format created by <b>generate()</b>

   <b>generate_random</b>
       Generates and returns any number of cryptographically random characters from the url-safe base64
       character set.

           my $rand_pass = passphrase-&gt;generate_random;

       The passwords generated are suitable for use as temporary passwords or one-time authentication tokens.

       You can configure the length and the character set used by passing a hashref of options.

           my $rand_pass = passphrase-&gt;generate_random({
               length  =&gt; 32,
               charset =&gt; ['a'..'z', 'A'..'Z'],
           });

</pre><h4><b>ADDITIONAL</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       The methods are only applicable once you have called "generate"

           passphrase( 'my password' )-&gt;generate-&gt;rfc2307; # CORRECT

           passphrase( 'my password' )-&gt;rfc2307;           # INCORRECT, Returns undef

</pre><h4><b>MORE</b> <b>INFORMATION</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Purpose</b>
       The aim of this module is to help you store new passwords in a secure manner, whilst still being able to
       verify and upgrade older passwords.

       Cryptography is a vast and complex field. Many people try to roll their own methods for securing user
       data, but succeed only in coming up with a system that has little real security.

       This plugin provides a simple way of managing that complexity, allowing developers to follow crypto best
       practice without having to become an expert.

   <b>Rationale</b>
       The module defaults to hashing passwords using the bcrypt algorithm, returning them in RFC 2307 format.

       RFC 2307 describes an encoding system for passphrase hashes, as used in the "userPassword" attribute in
       LDAP databases. It encodes hashes as ASCII text, and supports several passphrase schemes by starting the
       encoding with an alphanumeric scheme identifier enclosed in braces.

       RFC 2307 only specifies the "MD5", and "SHA" schemes - however in real-world usage, schemes that are
       salted are widely supported, and are thus provided by this module.

       Bcrypt is an adaptive hashing algorithm that is designed to resist brute force attacks by including a
       cost (aka work factor). This cost increases the computational effort it takes to compute the hash.

       SHA and MD5 are designed to be fast, and modern machines compute a billion hashes a second. With
       computers getting faster every day, brute forcing SHA hashes is a very real problem that cannot be easily
       solved.

       Increasing the cost of generating a bcrypt hash is a trivial way to make brute forcing ineffective. With
       a low cost setting, bcrypt is just as secure as a more traditional SHA+salt scheme, and just as fast.
       Increasing the cost as computers become more powerful keeps you one step ahead

       For a more detailed description of why bcrypt is preferred, see this article:
       &lt;<a href="http://codahale.com/how-to-safely-store-a-password/">http://codahale.com/how-to-safely-store-a-password/</a>&gt;

   <b>Configuration</b>
       In your applications config file, you can set the default hashing algorithm, and the default settings for
       every supported algorithm. Calls to <b>generate()</b> will use the default settings for that algorithm specified
       in here.

       You can override these defaults when you call <b>generate()</b>.

       If you do no configuration at all, the default is to bcrypt with a cost of 4, and a strong psuedo-random
       salt.

           plugins:
               Passphrase:
                   algorithm: Bcrypt
                   cost: 8

   <b>Storage</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>database</b>
       You should be storing the RFC 2307 string in your database, it's the easiest way to use this module. You
       could store the "raw_salt", "raw_hash", and "scheme" separately, but this strongly discouraged. RFC 2307
       strings are specifically designed for storing hashed passwords, and should be used wherever possible.

       The length of the string produced by <b>generate()</b> can vary dependent on your settings. Below is a table of
       the lengths generated using default settings.

       You will need to make sure your database columns are at least this long.  If the string gets truncated,
       the password can <u>never</u> be validated.

   <b>Common</b> <b>Mistakes</b>
       Common mistakes people make when creating their own solution. If any of these seem familiar, you should
       probably be using this module

       Passwords are stored as plain text for a reason
           There  is  never a valid reason to store a password as plain text.  Passwords should be reset and not
           emailed to customers when they forget.  Support people should be able to  login  as  a  user  without
           knowing  the  users password.  No-one except the user should know the password - that is the point of
           authentication.

       No-one will ever guess our super secret algorithm!
           Unless you're a cryptography  expert  with  many  years  spent  studying  super-complex  maths,  your
           algorithm  is  almost  certainly  not as secure as you think. Just because it's hard for you to break
           doesn't mean it's difficult for a computer.

       Our application-wide salt is "Sup3r_S3cret_L0ng_Word" - No-one will ever guess that.
           This is common misunderstanding of what a salt is meant to do. The purpose of a salt is to make  sure
           the  same password doesn't always generate the same hash.  A fresh salt needs to be created each time
           you hash a password. It isn't meant to be a secret key.

       We generate our random salt using "rand".
           "rand" isn't actually random, it's a non-unform pseudo-random number generator, and not suitable  for
           cryptographic  applications.  Whilst  this  module also defaults to a PRNG, it is better than the one
           provided by "rand". Using a true RNG is a config option away, but is not the default as it  it  could
           potentially block output if the system does not have enough entropy to generate a truly random number

       We use "md5(pass.salt)", and the salt is from "/dev/random"
           MD5  has been broken for many years. Commodity hardware can find a hash collision in seconds, meaning
           an attacker can easily generate the correct MD5 hash without using the correct password.

       We use "sha(pass.salt)", and the salt is from "/dev/random"
           SHA isn't quite as broken as MD5, but it shares the same theoretical weaknesses.  Even  without  hash
           collisions,  it  is  vulnerable to brute forcing.  Modern hardware is so powerful it can try around a
           billion hashes a second.  That means every 7 character password  in  the  range  [A-Za-z0-9]  can  be
           cracked in one hour on your average desktop computer.

       If the only way to break the hash is to brute-force it, it's secure enough
           It is unlikely that your database will be hacked and your hashes brute forced.  However, in the event
           that  it  does  happen,  or  SHA512 is broken, using this module gives you an easy way to change to a
           different algorithm, while still allowing you to validate old passphrases

</pre><h4><b>KNOWN</b> <b>ISSUES</b></h4><pre>
       If you see errors like this

           Wide character in subroutine entry

       or

           Input must contain only octets

       The "MD5", "bcrypt", and "SHA" algorithms can't handle  characters  with  an  ordinal  value  above  255,
       producing  errors  like this if they encounter them.  It is not possible for this plugin to automagically
       work out the correct encoding for a given string.

       If you see errors like this, then you probably need to use the Encode module to encode your text as UTF-8
       (or whatever encoding it is) before giving it to "passphrase".

       Text encoding is a bag of hurt, and errors like this are probably indicitive of  deeper  problems  within
       your app's code.

       You will save yourself a lot of trouble if you read up on the Encode module sooner rather than later.

       For     further     reading     on    UTF-8,    unicode,    and    text    encoding    in    perl,    see
