       Plugin API.

       A plugin is a way to implement application-independent reliability and performance tuning behavior.
       Plugins are written using the API described in this document.

       A plugin is created by defining a globus_ftp_client_plugin_t which contains the function pointers and
       plugin-specific data needed for the plugin's operation. It is recommended that a plugin define a a
       globus_module_descriptor_t and plugin initialization functions, to ensure that the plugin is properly
       initialized.

       The functions pointed to in a plugin are called when significant events in the life of an FTP Client
       operation occur. Note that plugins will only be called when the plugin has the function pointer for both
       the operation (get, put, list, etc), and the event (connect, authenticate, command, etc), are defined.
       The command and response functions are filtered based on the command_mask defined in the plugin
       structure.

       Every plugin must define <b>copy</b>  and <b>destroy</b>  functions. The copy function is called when the plugin is
       added to an attribute set or a handle is initialized with an attribute set containing the plugin. The
       destroy function is called when the handle or attribute set is destroyed.

       <b>globus_ftp_client_handle_t</b> <b>*handle)</b>
       Plugin abort notification callback.

       This callback is used to notify a plugin that an abort is being requested on a client handle. This
       notification happens both when the user aborts a request and when a plugin aborts the currently active
       request.

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>plugin</u> The plugin which is being notified.
           <u>plugin_specific</u> Plugin-specific data.
           <u>handle</u> The handle associated with the request.

       <b>globus_ftp_control_auth_info_t</b> <b>*auth_info)</b>
       Plugin authentication notification callback.

       This callback is used to notify a plugin that an authentication handshake is being done for this client
       handle. This notification can occur when a new request is made or when a hard restart is done by a
       plugin.

       If a response_callback is defined by a plugin, then that will be once the authentication has completed
       (successfully or unsuccessfully).

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>plugin</u> The plugin which is being notified.
           <u>plugin_specific</u> Plugin-specific data.
           <u>handle</u> The handle associated with the connection.
           <u>url</u> The URL of the server to connect to.
           <u>auth_info</u> Authentication and authorization info being used to authenticate with the FTP or GridFTP

       Restart an existing chgrp.

       This function will cause the currently executing chgrp operation to be restarted. When a restart happens,
       the operation will be silently aborted, and then restarted with potentially a new URL and attributes. Any
       data buffers which are currently queued will be cleared and reused once the connection is re-established.

       The  user  will not receive any notification that a restart has happened. Each plugin which is interested
       in chgrp events will receive a chgrp callback with the restart boolean set to GLOBUS_TRUE.

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>handle</u> The handle which is associated with the chgrp.
           <u>url</u> The destination URL of the transfer. This may be different than the original chgrp's URL, if  the

           original URL.
           <u>group</u> The group name or ID to change the file to.
           <u>attr</u> The attributes to use for the new transfer. This may be  a  modified  version  of  the  original
           chgrp's attribute set.
           <u>when</u>  Absolute  time  for when to restart the chgrp. The current control and data connections will be
           stopped immediately. If this completes before <b>when</b>, then the restart will be delayed until that time.
           Otherwise, it will be immediately restarted.

       Restart an existing rmdir.

       This  function  will cause the currently executing operation to be restarted. When a restart happens, the
       operation will be silently aborted, and then restarted with potentially a new  URL  and  attributes.  Any
       data buffers which are currently queued will be cleared and reused once the connection is re-established.

       The  user  will not receive any notification that a restart has happened. Each plugin which is interested
       in rmdir events will receive a rmdir callback with the restart boolean set to GLOBUS_TRUE.

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>handle</u> The handle which is associated with the rmdir.
           <u>url</u> The destination URL of the transfer. This may be different than the original rmdir's URL, if  the
           plugin  decides to redirect to another FTP server due to performance or reliability problems with the
           original URL.
           <u>attr</u> The attributes to use for the new transfer. This may be  a  modified  version  of  the  original
           rmdir's attribute set.
           <u>when</u>  Absolute  time  for when to restart the rmdir. The current control and data connections will be
           stopped immediately. If this completes before <b>when</b>, then the restart will be delayed until that time.

           <u>restart_marker</u>  Plugin-provided  restart marker for resuming at a non-default restart point. This may
           be used to implement a persistent restart across process invocations. The default behavior if this is
           NULL is to use any restart information which has been  received  by  the  ftp  client  library  while
           processing this operation when restarted.
           <u>when</u> Absolute time for when to restart the transfer. The current control and data connections will be
