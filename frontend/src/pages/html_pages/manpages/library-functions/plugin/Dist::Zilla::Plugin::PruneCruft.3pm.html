</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Dist::Zilla::Plugin::PruneCruft - prune stuff that you probably don't mean to include

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 6.032

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       This plugin tries to compensate for the stupid crap that turns up in your working copy, removing it
       before it gets into your dist and screws everything up.

       In your <u>dist.ini</u>:

         [PruneCruft]

       If you would like to exclude certain exclusions, use the "except" option (it can be specified multiple
       times):

         [PruneCruft]
         except = \.gitignore
         except = t/.*/\.keep$

       This plugin is included in the @Basic bundle.

</pre><h4><b>PERL</b> <b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This module should work on any version of perl still receiving updates from the Perl 5 Porters.  This
       means it should work on any version of perl released in the last two to three years.  (That is, if the
       most recently released version is v5.40, then this module should work on both v5.40 and v5.38.)

       Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made that the minimum required version
       will not be increased.  The version may be increased for any reason, and there is no promise that patches
       will be accepted to lower the minimum required perl.
