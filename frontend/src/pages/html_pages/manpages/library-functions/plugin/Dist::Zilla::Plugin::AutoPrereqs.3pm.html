</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Dist::Zilla::Plugin::AutoPrereqs - automatically extract prereqs from your modules

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 6.032

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       In your <u>dist.ini</u>:

         [AutoPrereqs]
         skip = ^Foo|Bar$
         skip = ^Other::Dist

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This plugin will extract loosely your distribution prerequisites from your files using
       Perl::PrereqScanner.

       If some prereqs are not found, you can still add them manually with the Prereqs plugin.

       This plugin will skip the modules shipped within your dist.

       <b>Note</b>, if you have any non-Perl files in your "t/" directory or other directories being scanned, be sure
       to mark those files' encoding as "bytes" with the Encoding plugin so they won't be scanned:

           [Encoding]
           encoding = bytes
           match    = ^t/data/

</pre><h4><b>PERL</b> <b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This module should work on any version of perl still receiving updates from the Perl 5 Porters.  This
       means it should work on any version of perl released in the last two to three years.  (That is, if the
       most recently released version is v5.40, then this module should work on both v5.40 and v5.38.)

       Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made that the minimum required version
       will not be increased.  The version may be increased for any reason, and there is no promise that patches
       will be accepted to lower the minimum required perl.

</pre><h4><b>ATTRIBUTES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>finder</b>
       This is the name of a FileFinder whose files will be scanned to determine runtime prerequisites.  It may
       be specified multiple times.  The default value is ":InstallModules" and ":ExecFiles".

   <b>test_finder</b>
       Just like "finder", but for test-phase prerequisites.  The default value is ":TestFiles".

   <b>configure_finder</b>
       Just like "finder", but for configure-phase prerequisites.  There is no default value; AutoPrereqs will
       not determine configure-phase prerequisites unless you set configure_finder.

   <b>develop_finder</b>
       Just like "finder", but for develop-phase prerequisites.  The default value is ":ExtraTestFiles".

   <b>skips</b>
       This is an arrayref of regular expressions, derived from all the 'skip' lines in the configuration.  Any
       module names matching any of these regexes will not be registered as prerequisites.

   <b>relationship</b>
       The relationship used for the registered prerequisites. The default value is 'requires'; other options
       are 'recommends' and 'suggests'.

   <b>extra_scanners</b>
       This is an arrayref of scanner names (as expected by Perl::PrereqScanner).  It will be passed as the
       "extra_scanners" parameter to Perl::PrereqScanner.

   <b>scanners</b>
       This is an arrayref of scanner names (as expected by Perl::PrereqScanner).  If present, it will be passed
       as the "scanners" parameter to Perl::PrereqScanner, which means that it will replace the default list of
       scanners.
