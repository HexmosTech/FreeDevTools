</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       CGI::Application::Plugin::Authentication::Store - Base module for building storage classes for the
       CGI::Application::Plugin::Authentication plugin

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        package CGI::Application::Plugin::Authentication::Store::MyStore;
        use base qw(CGI::Application::Plugin::Authentication::Store);

         sub fetch {
             my $self   = shift;
             my @params = @_;
             ...
         }

         sub save {
             my $self   = shift;
             my %params = @_;
             ...
         }

         sub delete {
             my $self   = shift;
             my @params = @_;
             ...
         }

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module is a base class for all storage classes for the CGI::Application::Plugin::Authentication
       plugin.  Each storage class is required to provide three methods that fetch, save and delete data from
       the store.  The information that is saved will be text based, so there is no need to flatten any of the
       data that is to be stored.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b> <b>TO</b> <b>OVERRIDE</b></h4><pre>
       The following three (and one optional) methods should be provided by the subclass.

   <b>fetch</b>
       This method accepts a list of parameters and will return a list of values from the store matching those
       parameters.

   <b>save</b>
       This method accepts a hash of parameters and values and will save those parameters in the store.

   <b>delete</b>
       This method accepts a list of parameters and will delete those parameters from the store.

   <b>clear</b>
       A call to this method will remove all information about the current user out of the store (should be
       provided by the subclass, but is not required to be).

</pre><h4><b>OTHER</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       The following methods are also provided by the CGI::Application::Plugin::Authentication::Store base
       class.

   <b>new</b>
       This is a constructor that can create a new Store object.  It requires an Authentication object as its
       first parameter, and any number of other parameters that will be used as options depending on which Store
       object is being created.  You shouldn't need to call this as the Authentication plugin takes care of
       creating Store objects.

   <b>initialize</b>
       This method will be called right after a new Store object is created.  So any startup customizations can
       be dealt with here.

   <b>options</b>
       This will return a list of options that were provided when this store was configured by the user.

   <b>authen</b>
       This will return the underlying CGI::Application::Plugin::Authentication object.  In most cases it will
       not be necessary to access this.
