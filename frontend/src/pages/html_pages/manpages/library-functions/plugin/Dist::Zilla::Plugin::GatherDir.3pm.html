</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Dist::Zilla::Plugin::GatherDir - gather all the files in a directory

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 6.032

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This is a very, very simple FileGatherer plugin.  It looks in the directory named in the "root" attribute
       and adds all the files it finds there.  If the root begins with a tilde, the tilde is passed through
       glob() first.

       Almost every dist will be built with one GatherDir plugin, since it's the easiest way to get files from
       disk into your dist.  Most users just need:

         [GatherDir]
         [PruneCruft]

       ...and this will pick up all the files from the current directory into the dist.  (PruneCruft is needed,
       here, to drop files that might present as build artifacts, but should not be shipped.)  You can use it
       multiple times, as you can any other plugin, by providing a plugin name.  For example, if you want to
       include external specification files into a subdir of your dist, you might write:

         [GatherDir]
         ; this plugin needs no config and gathers most of your files

         [GatherDir / SpecFiles]
         ; this plugin gets all the files in the root dir and adds them under ./spec
         root   = <a href="file:~/projects/my-project/spec">~/projects/my-project/spec</a>
         prefix = spec

</pre><h4><b>PERL</b> <b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This module should work on any version of perl still receiving updates from the Perl 5 Porters.  This
       means it should work on any version of perl released in the last two to three years.  (That is, if the
       most recently released version is v5.40, then this module should work on both v5.40 and v5.38.)

       Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made that the minimum required version
       will not be increased.  The version may be increased for any reason, and there is no promise that patches
       will be accepted to lower the minimum required perl.

</pre><h4><b>ATTRIBUTES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>root</b>
       This is the directory in which to look for files.  If not given, it defaults to the dist root --
       generally, the place where your <u>dist.ini</u> or other configuration file is located.  It may begin with "~"
       (or "~user") to mean your (or some other user's) home directory.  If a relative path, it is relative to
       the dist root.

   <b>prefix</b>
       This parameter can be set to place the gathered files under a particular directory.  See the description
       above for an example.

   <b>include_dotfiles</b>
       By default, files will not be included if they begin with a dot.  This goes both for files and for
       directories relative to the "root".

       In almost all cases, the default value (false) is correct.

   <b>follow_symlinks</b>
       By default, symlinks pointing to directories will not be followed; set "follow_symlinks = 1" to traverse
       these links as if they were normal directories.

       In all followed directories, files which are symlinks are <b>always</b> gathered, with the link turning into a
       normal file.

   <b>exclude_filename</b>
       To exclude certain files from being gathered, use the "exclude_filename" option.  The filename is matched
       exactly, relative to "root".  This may be used multiple times to specify multiple files to exclude.

   <b>exclude_match</b>
       This is just like "exclude_filename" but provides a regular expression pattern.  Filenames matching the
       pattern (relative to "root")  are not gathered.  This may be used multiple times to specify multiple
       patterns to exclude.

   <b>prune_directory</b>
       While traversing, any directory matching the regular expression pattern will not be traversed further.
       This may be used multiple times to specify multiple directories to skip.
