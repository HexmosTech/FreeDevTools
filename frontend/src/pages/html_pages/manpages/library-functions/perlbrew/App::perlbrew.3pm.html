       App::perlbrew - Manage perl installations in your "$HOME"

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           # Installation
           curl -L https://install.perlbrew.pl | bash

           # Initialize
           perlbrew init

           # See what is available
           perlbrew available

           # Install some Perls
           perlbrew install 5.32.1
           perlbrew install perl-5.28.3
           perlbrew install perl-5.33.6

           # See what were installed
           perlbrew list

           # Swith to an installation and set it as default
           perlbrew switch perl-5.32.1

           # Temporarily use another version only in current shell.
           perlbrew use perl-5.28.3
           perl -v

           # Turn it off and go back to the system perl.
           perlbrew off

           # Turn it back on with 'switch', or 'use'
           perlbrew switch perl-5.32.1
           perlbrew use perl-5.32.1

           # Exec something with all perlbrew-ed perls
           perlbrew exec -- perl -E 'say $]'

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       perlbrew is a program to automate the building and installation of perl in an easy way. It provides
       multiple isolated perl environments, and a mechanism for you to switch between them.

       Everything are installed unter "<a href="file:~/perl5/perlbrew">~/perl5/perlbrew</a>". You then need to include a bashrc/cshrc provided by
       perlbrew to tweak the PATH for you. You then can benefit from not having to run "sudo" commands to
       install cpan modules because those are installed inside your "HOME" too.

       For the documentation of perlbrew usage see perlbrew command on MetaCPAN &lt;https://metacpan.org/&gt;, or by
       running "perlbrew help", or by visiting perlbrew's official website &lt;https://perlbrew.pl/&gt;. The following
       documentation features the API of "App::perlbrew" module, and may not be remotely close to what your want
       to read.

</pre><h4><b>INSTALLATION</b></h4><pre>
       It is the simplest to use the perlbrew installer, just paste this statement to your terminal:

           curl -L https://install.perlbrew.pl | bash

       Or this one, if you have "fetch" (default on FreeBSD):

           fetch -o- https://install.perlbrew.pl | sh

       After that, "perlbrew" installs itself to "<a href="file:~/perl5/perlbrew/bin">~/perl5/perlbrew/bin</a>", and you should follow the instruction
       on screen to modify your shell rc file to put it in your PATH.

       The installed perlbrew command is a standalone executable that can be run with system perl. The minimum
       required version of system perl is 5.8.0, which should be good enough for most of the OSes these days.

       A fat-packed version of patchperl is also installed to "<a href="file:~/perl5/perlbrew/bin">~/perl5/perlbrew/bin</a>", which is required to build
       old perls.

       The directory "<a href="file:~/perl5/perlbrew">~/perl5/perlbrew</a>" will contain all install perl executables, libraries, documentations,
       lib, site_libs. In the documentation, that directory is referred as "perlbrew root". If you need to set
       it to somewhere else because, say, your "HOME" has limited quota, you can do that by setting
       "PERLBREW_ROOT" environment variable before running the installer:

           export PERLBREW_ROOT=/opt/perl5
           curl -L https://install.perlbrew.pl | bash

       As a result, different users on the same machine can all share the same perlbrew root directory (although
       only original user that made the installation would have the permission to perform perl installations.)

       If you need to install perlbrew using a Perl that isn't either "<a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?perl">/usr/bin/perl</a>" or "/usr/local/bin/perl",
       set and export the environment variable "PERLBREW_SYSTEM_PERL" and then install as described above. Note
       that you must not use a perlbrew-managed perl.

       You may also install perlbrew from CPAN:

           cpan App::perlbrew

       In this case, the perlbrew command is installed as "/usr/bin/perlbrew" or "/usr/local/bin/perlbrew" or
       others, depending on the location of your system perl installation.

       Please make sure not to run this with one of the perls brewed with perlbrew. It's the best to turn
       perlbrew off before you run that, if you're upgrading.

           perlbrew off
           cpan App::perlbrew

       You should always use system cpan (like <a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?cpan">/usr/bin/cpan</a>) to install "App::perlbrew" because it will be
       installed under a system PATH like "<a href="file:/usr/bin">/usr/bin</a>", which is not affected by perlbrew "switch" or "use"
       command.

       The "self-upgrade" command will not upgrade the perlbrew installed by cpan command, but it is also easy
       to upgrade perlbrew by running "cpan App::perlbrew" again.

       perlbrew project &lt;https://perlbrew.pl/&gt; uses github &lt;https://github.com/gugod/App-perlbrew/issues&gt; for
       issue tracking. Issues sent to these two systems will eventually be reviewed and handled. To participate,
       you need a github account.

       Please briefly read the short instructions about how to get your work released to CPAN:
