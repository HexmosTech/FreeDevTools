</pre><h4><b>Detailed</b> <b>Description</b></h4><pre>
       an onscreen surface

       A surface is a rectangular area that may be displayed on zero or more outputs, and shown any number of
       times at the compositor's discretion. They can present wl_buffers, receive user input, and define a local
       coordinate system.

       The size of a surface (and relative positions on it) is described in surface-local coordinates, which may
       differ from the buffer coordinates of the pixel content, in case a buffer_transform or a buffer_scale is
       used.

       A surface without a 'role' is fairly useless: a compositor does not know where, when or how to present
       it. The role is the purpose of a wl_surface. Examples of roles are a cursor for a pointer (as set by
       wl_pointer.set_cursor), a drag icon (wl_data_device.start_drag), a sub-surface
       (wl_subcompositor.get_subsurface), and a window as defined by a shell protocol (e.g.
       wl_shell.get_shell_surface).

       A surface can have only one role at a time. Initially a wl_surface does not have a role. Once a
       wl_surface is given a role, it is set permanently for the whole lifetime of the wl_surface object. Giving
       the current role again is allowed, unless explicitly forbidden by the relevant interface specification.

       Surface roles are given by requests in other interfaces such as wl_pointer.set_cursor. The request should
       explicitly mention that this request gives a role to a wl_surface. Often, this request also creates a new
       protocol object that represents the role and adds additional functionality to wl_surface. When a client
       wants to destroy a wl_surface, they must destroy this 'role object' before the wl_surface.

       Destroying the role object does not remove the role from the wl_surface, but it may stop the wl_surface
       from 'playing the role'. For instance, if a wl_subsurface object is destroyed, the wl_surface it was
       created for will be unmapped and forget its position and z-order. It is allowed to create a wl_subsurface
       for the same wl_surface again, but it is not allowed to use the wl_surface as a cursor (cursor is a
       different role than sub-surface, and role switching is not allowed).

   <b>enum</b> <b>class</b> <b>wayland::proxy_t::wrapper_type</b> <b>[strong],</b>  <b>[inherited]</b>
       Underlying wl_proxy type and properties of a <b>proxy_t</b> that affect construction, destruction, and event
       handling

       <b>Enumerator</b>

       <u>standard</u>
              C pointer is a standard type compatible with wl_proxy*. Events are dispatched and it is destructed
              when the <b>proxy_t</b> is destructed. User data is set.

       <u>display</u>
              C  pointer  is  a  wl_display*. No events are dispatched, wl_display_disconnect is called when the
              <b>proxy_t</b> is destructed. User data is set.

       <u>foreign</u>
              C pointer is a standard type compatible with wl_proxy*, but another library owns it and it  should
              not  be  touched  in  a  way  that  could affect the operation of the other library. No events are
              dispatched, wl_proxy_destroy is not called when the  <b>proxy_t</b>  is  destructed,  user  data  is  not
              touched.  Consequently,  there is no reference counting for the <b>proxy_t</b>. Lifetime of such wrappers
              should preferably be short to minimize the chance that the owning library decides to  destroy  the
              wl_proxy.

       <u>proxy_wrapper</u>
              C  pointer  is  a  wl_proxy*  that  was  constructed  with  wl_proxy_create_wrapper. No events are
              dispatched, wl_proxy_wrapper_destroy is called when the <b>proxy_t</b> is destroyed.  Reference  counting
              is  active.  A reference to the <b>proxy_t</b> creating this proxy wrapper is held to extend its lifetime
              until after the proxy wrapper is destroyed.

   <b>void</b> <b>surface_t::attach</b> <b>(buffer_t</b> <b>const</b> <b>&amp;</b> <b>buffer,</b> <b>int32_t</b> <b>x,</b> <b>int32_t</b> <b>y)</b>
       set the surface contents

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>buffer</u> buffer of surface contents
           <u>x</u> surface-local x coordinate
           <u>y</u> surface-local y coordinate

       Set a buffer as the content of this surface.

       The new size of the  surface  is  calculated  based  on  the  buffer  size  transformed  by  the  inverse
       buffer_transform  and  the  inverse buffer_scale. This means that at commit time the supplied buffer size
       must be an integer multiple of the buffer_scale. If that's not the case, an invalid_size error is sent.

       The x and y arguments specify the location of the new pending buffer's upper left corner, relative to the
       current buffer's upper left corner, in surface-local coordinates. In other words, the x and  y,  combined
       with  the  new surface size define in which directions the surface's size changes. Setting anything other
       than 0 as x and y arguments is discouraged, and should  instead  be  replaced  with  using  the  separate
       wl_surface.offset request.

       When  the  bound  wl_surface version is 5 or higher, passing any non-zero x or y is a protocol violation,
       and will result in  an  'invalid_offset'  error  being  raised.  To  achieve  equivalent  semantics,  use
       wl_surface.offset.

       Surface contents are double-buffered state, see wl_surface.commit.

       The initial surface contents are void; there is no content. wl_surface.attach assigns the given wl_buffer
       as the pending wl_buffer. wl_surface.commit makes the pending wl_buffer the new surface contents, and the
       size  of  the  surface  becomes the size calculated from the wl_buffer, as described above. After commit,
       there is no pending buffer until the next attach.

       Committing a pending wl_buffer allows the compositor to read the pixels in the wl_buffer. The  compositor
       may  access  the  pixels  at  any  time after the wl_surface.commit request. When the compositor will not
       access  the  pixels  anymore,  it  will  send  the  wl_buffer.release   event.   Only   after   receiving
       wl_buffer.release,  the  client  may  reuse  the  wl_buffer.  A wl_buffer that has been attached and then
       replaced by another attach instead of committed will not receive a release event, and is not used by  the
       compositor.

       If  a pending wl_buffer has been committed to more than one wl_surface, the delivery of wl_buffer.release
       events becomes undefined. A well behaved client should not rely on wl_buffer.release events in this case.
       Alternatively, a client could create multiple wl_buffer objects from the  same  backing  storage  or  use
       wp_linux_buffer_release.

       Destroying  the  wl_buffer  after  wl_buffer.release does not change the surface contents. Destroying the
       wl_buffer before wl_buffer.release is allowed as long as the  underlying  buffer  storage  isn't  re-used
       (this  can  happen  e.g.  on  client  process termination). However, if the client destroys the wl_buffer
       before receiving the wl_buffer.release event and mutates  the  underlying  buffer  storage,  the  surface
       contents become undefined immediately.

       If  wl_surface.attach  is  sent  with  a  NULL wl_buffer, the following wl_surface.commit will remove the
       surface content.

   <b>void</b> <b>surface_t::commit</b> <b>()</b>
       commit pending surface state Surface state (input, opaque, and damage regions, attached buffers, etc.) is
       double-buffered. Protocol requests modify the pending state, as opposed to the current state  in  use  by
       the compositor. A commit request atomically applies all pending state, replacing the current state. After
       commit, the new pending state is as documented for each related request.

       On  commit,  a  pending  wl_buffer  is  applied  first,  and  all other state second. This means that all
       coordinates in double-buffered state are relative to the  new  wl_buffer  coming  into  use,  except  for
       wl_surface.attach  itself.  If there is no pending wl_buffer, the coordinates are relative to the current
       surface contents.

       All requests that need a commit to become effective are documented to affect double-buffered state.

       Other interfaces may add further double-buffered surface state.

       <b>Examples</b>
           <b>egl.cpp</b>, and <b>shm.cpp</b>.

   <b>void</b> <b>surface_t::damage</b> <b>(int32_t</b> <b>x,</b> <b>int32_t</b> <b>y,</b> <b>int32_t</b> <b>width,</b> <b>int32_t</b> <b>height)</b>
       mark part of the surface damaged

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>x</u> surface-local x coordinate
           <u>y</u> surface-local y coordinate
           <u>width</u> width of damage rectangle
           <u>height</u> height of damage rectangle

       This request is used to describe the regions where the pending  buffer  is  different  from  the  current
       surface contents, and where the surface therefore needs to be repainted. The compositor ignores the parts
       of the damage that fall outside of the surface.

       Damage is double-buffered state, see wl_surface.commit.

       The  damage  rectangle  is  specified  in surface-local coordinates, where x and y specify the upper left
       corner of the damage rectangle.

       The initial value for pending damage is empty: no damage. wl_surface.damage adds pending damage: the  new
       pending damage is the union of old pending damage and the given rectangle.

       wl_surface.commit  assigns  pending  damage  as the current damage, and clears pending damage. The server
       will clear the current damage as it repaints the surface.

       Note! New clients should not use this request. Instead damage can be posted with wl_surface.damage_buffer
       which uses buffer coordinates instead of surface coordinates.

       <b>Examples</b>
           <b>egl.cpp</b>, and <b>shm.cpp</b>.

       Definition at line <b>2699</b> of file <b>wayland-client-protocol.cpp</b>.

       mark part of the surface damaged using buffer coordinates

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>x</u> buffer-local x coordinate
           <u>y</u> buffer-local y coordinate
           <u>width</u> width of damage rectangle
           <u>height</u> height of damage rectangle

       This request is used to describe the regions where the pending  buffer  is  different  from  the  current
       surface contents, and where the surface therefore needs to be repainted. The compositor ignores the parts
       of the damage that fall outside of the surface.

       Damage is double-buffered state, see wl_surface.commit.

       The  damage  rectangle is specified in buffer coordinates, where x and y specify the upper left corner of
       the damage rectangle.

       The initial value for pending damage is empty: no damage. wl_surface.damage_buffer adds  pending  damage:
       the new pending damage is the union of old pending damage and the given rectangle.

       wl_surface.commit  assigns  pending  damage  as the current damage, and clears pending damage. The server
       will clear the current damage as it repaints the surface.

       This request differs from wl_surface.damage in only one way -  it  takes  damage  in  buffer  coordinates
       instead of surface-local coordinates. While this generally is more intuitive than surface coordinates, it
       is  especially desirable when using wp_viewport or when a drawing library (like EGL) is unaware of buffer
       scale and buffer transform.

       Note: Because buffer transformation changes and damage  requests  may  be  interleaved  in  the  protocol
       stream,  it  is  impossible  to  determine  the  actual  mapping  between surface and buffer damage until
       wl_surface.commit time. Therefore, compositors wishing to take both kinds of  damage  into  account  will
       have to accumulate damage from the two requests separately and only transform from one to the other after
       receiving the wl_surface.commit.

       Definition at line <b>2752</b> of file <b>wayland-client-protocol.cpp</b>.

   <b>callback_t</b> <b>surface_t::frame</b> <b>()</b>
       request a frame throttling hint

       <b>Returns</b>
           callback object for the frame request

       Request a notification when it is a good time to start drawing a new frame, by creating a frame callback.
       This is useful for throttling redrawing operations, and driving animations.

       When  a  client is animating on a wl_surface, it can use the 'frame' request to get notified when it is a
       good time to draw and commit the next frame of animation. If the client commits an  update  earlier  than
       that, it is likely that some updates will not make it to the display, and the client is wasting resources
       by drawing too often.

       The  frame  request  will take effect on the next wl_surface.commit. The notification will only be posted
       for one frame unless requested again. For a wl_surface, the notifications are posted  in  the  order  the
       frame requests were committed.

       The  server  must  send  the  notifications so that a client will not send excessive updates, while still
       allowing the highest possible update rate for clients that wait for the reply before drawing  again.  The
       server should give some time for the client to draw and commit after sending the frame callback events to
       let it hit the next output refresh.

       A  server  should  avoid signaling the frame callbacks if the surface is not visible in any way, e.g. the
       surface is off-screen, or completely obscured by other opaque surfaces.

       The object returned by this request will be destroyed by the compositor after the callback is  fired  and
       as such the client must not attempt to use it after that point.

       The callback_data passed in the callback is the current time, in milliseconds, with an undefined base.

   <b>void</b> <b>surface_t::offset</b> <b>(int32_t</b> <b>x,</b> <b>int32_t</b> <b>y)</b>
       set the surface contents offset

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>x</u> surface-local x coordinate
           <u>y</u> surface-local y coordinate

       The x and y arguments specify the location of the new pending buffer's upper left corner, relative to the
       current buffer's upper left corner, in surface-local coordinates. In other words, the x and  y,  combined
       with the new surface size define in which directions the surface's size changes.

       Surface location offset is double-buffered state, see wl_surface.commit.

       This   request   is  semantically  equivalent  to  and  the  replaces  the  x  and  y  arguments  in  the
       wl_surface.attach request in wl_surface versions prior to 5. See wl_surface.attach for details.

   <b>std::function&lt;</b> <b>void(output_t)&gt;</b> <b>&amp;</b> <b>surface_t::on_enter</b> <b>()</b>
       surface enters an output

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>output</u> output entered by the surface

       This is emitted whenever a surface's creation, movement, or resizing results in some  part  of  it  being
       within the scanout region of an output.

       Note that a surface may be overlapping with zero or more outputs.

   <b>std::function&lt;</b> <b>void(output_t)&gt;</b> <b>&amp;</b> <b>surface_t::on_leave</b> <b>()</b>
       surface leaves an output

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>output</u> output left by the surface

       This  is  emitted whenever a surface's creation, movement, or resizing results in it no longer having any
       part of it within the scanout region of an output.

       Clients should not use the number of outputs the surface is on for frame throttling purposes. The surface
       might be hidden even if no leave event has been sent, and the compositor might expect new surface content
       updates even if no enter event has been sent. The frame event should be used instead.

   <b>void</b> <b>surface_t::set_buffer_scale</b> <b>(int32_t</b> <b>scale)</b>
       sets the buffer scaling factor

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>scale</u> positive scale for interpreting buffer contents

       This  request sets an optional scaling factor on how the compositor interprets the contents of the buffer
       attached to the window.

       Buffer scale is double-buffered state, see wl_surface.commit.

       A newly created surface has its buffer scale set to 1.

       wl_surface.set_buffer_scale changes the pending buffer scale. wl_surface.commit copies the pending buffer
       scale to the current one. Otherwise, the pending and current values are never changed.

       The purpose of this request is to allow clients to supply higher resolution buffer data for use  on  high
       resolution  outputs.  It  is intended that you pick the same buffer scale as the scale of the output that
       the surface is displayed on. This means the compositor can avoid scaling when rendering  the  surface  on
       that output.

       Note  that if the scale is larger than 1, then you have to attach a buffer that is larger (by a factor of
       scale in each dimension) than the desired surface size.

       If scale is not positive the invalid_scale protocol error is raised.

   <b>void</b> <b>surface_t::set_buffer_transform</b> <b>(output_transform</b> <b>const</b> <b>&amp;</b> <b>transform)</b>
       sets the buffer transformation

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>transform</u> transform for interpreting buffer contents

       This request sets an optional transformation on how the compositor interprets the contents of the  buffer
       attached  to  the  surface.  The  accepted  values  for  the  transform  parameter  are  the  values  for
       wl_output.transform.

       Buffer transform is double-buffered state, see wl_surface.commit.

       A newly created surface has its buffer transformation set to normal.

       wl_surface.set_buffer_transform changes the pending buffer transformation. wl_surface.commit  copies  the
       pending  buffer  transformation  to  the current one. Otherwise, the pending and current values are never
       changed.

       The purpose of this request is to allow clients to render content according to the output transform, thus
       permitting the compositor to use certain optimizations even if the display  is  rotated.  Using  hardware
       overlays  and  scanning  out  a client buffer for fullscreen surfaces are examples of such optimizations.
       Those optimizations are highly dependent on the compositor implementation, so the  use  of  this  request
       should be considered on a case-by-case basis.

       Note  that if the transform value includes 90 or 270 degree rotation, the width of the buffer will become
       the surface height and the height of the buffer will become the surface width.

       If transform is not one of the values from the wl_output.transform enum  the  invalid_transform  protocol
       error is raised.

   <b>void</b> <b>surface_t::set_input_region</b> <b>(region_t</b> <b>const</b> <b>&amp;</b> <b>region)</b>
       set input region

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>region</u> input region of the surface

       This request sets the region of the surface that can receive pointer and touch events.

       Input  events happening outside of this region will try the next surface in the server surface stack. The
       compositor ignores the parts of the input region that fall outside of the surface.

       The input region is specified in surface-local coordinates.

       Input region is double-buffered state, see wl_surface.commit.

       wl_surface.set_input_region changes the pending input region. wl_surface.commit copies the pending region
       to the current region. Otherwise the pending and current regions are never  changed,  except  cursor  and
       icon surfaces are special cases, see wl_pointer.set_cursor and wl_data_device.start_drag.

       The  initial  value  for  an  input  region  is infinite. That means the whole surface will accept input.
       Setting the pending input  region  has  copy  semantics,  and  the  wl_region  object  can  be  destroyed
       immediately. A NULL wl_region causes the input region to be set to infinite.

   <b>void</b> <b>surface_t::set_opaque_region</b> <b>(region_t</b> <b>const</b> <b>&amp;</b> <b>region)</b>
       set opaque region

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>region</u> opaque region of the surface

       This request sets the region of the surface that contains opaque content.

       The  opaque  region  is  an  optimization  hint for the compositor that lets it optimize the redrawing of
       content behind opaque regions. Setting an opaque region  is  not  required  for  correct  behaviour,  but
       marking transparent content as opaque will result in repaint artifacts.

       The opaque region is specified in surface-local coordinates.

       The compositor ignores the parts of the opaque region that fall outside of the surface.

       Opaque region is double-buffered state, see wl_surface.commit.

       wl_surface.set_opaque_region  changes  the  pending  opaque  region. wl_surface.commit copies the pending
       region to the current region. Otherwise, the pending and current regions are never changed.

       The initial value for an opaque region is empty. Setting the pending opaque region  has  copy  semantics,
       and  the wl_region object can be destroyed immediately. A NULL wl_region causes the pending opaque region
       to be set to empty.
