       HTML::Element::traverse - discussion of HTML::Element's traverse method

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This document describes version 5.07 of HTML::Element::traverse, released August 31, 2017 as part of
       HTML-Tree.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         # $element-&gt;traverse is unnecessary and obscure.
         #   Don't use it in new code.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       "HTML::Element" provides a method "traverse" that traverses the tree and calls user-specified callbacks
       for each node, in pre- or post-order.  However, use of the method is quite superfluous: if you want to
       recursively visit every node in the tree, it's almost always simpler to write a subroutine does just
       that, than it is to bundle up the pre- and/or post-order code in callbacks for the "traverse" method.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Suppose you want to traverse at/under a node $tree and give elements an 'id' attribute unless they
       already have one.

       You can use the "traverse" method:

         {
           my $counter = 'x0000';
           $start_node-&gt;traverse(
             [ # Callbacks;
               # pre-order callback:
               sub {
                 my $x = $_[0];
                 $x-&gt;attr('id', $counter++) unless defined $x-&gt;attr('id');
                 return HTML::Element::OK; # keep traversing
               },
               # post-order callback:
               undef
             ],
             1, # don't call the callbacks for text nodes
           );
         }

       or you can just be simple and clear (and not have to understand the calling format for "traverse") by
       writing a sub that traverses the tree by just calling itself:

         {
           my $counter = 'x0000';
           sub give_id {
             my $x = $_[0];
             $x-&gt;attr('id', $counter++) unless defined $x-&gt;attr('id');
             foreach my $c ($x-&gt;content_list) {
               give_id($c) if ref $c; # ignore text nodes
             }
           };
           give_id($start_node);
         }

       See, isn't that nice and clear?

       But, if you really need to know:

</pre><h4><b>THE</b> <b>TRAVERSE</b> <b>METHOD</b></h4><pre>
       The "traverse()" method is a general object-method for traversing a tree or subtree and calling user-
       specified callbacks.  It accepts the following syntaxes:

       $h-&gt;traverse(\&amp;callback)
       or $h-&gt;traverse(\&amp;callback, $ignore_text)
       or $h-&gt;traverse( [\&amp;pre_callback,\&amp;post_callback] , $ignore_text)

       These  all mean to traverse the element and all of its children.  That is, this method starts at node $h,
       "pre-order visits" $h, traverses its children, and then will "post-order  visit"  $h.   "Visiting"  means
       that the callback routine is called, with these arguments:

           $_[0] : the node (element or text segment),
           $_[1] : a startflag, and
           $_[2] : the depth

       If  the  $ignore_text  parameter  is  given and true, then the pre-order call <u>will</u> <u>not</u> be happen for text
       content.

       The startflag is 1 when we enter a node (i.e., in pre-order calls) and 0 when we leave the node (in post-
       order calls).

       Note, however, that post-order calls don't happen for nodes that are text segments or are  elements  that
       are prototypically empty (like "br", "hr", etc.).

       If  we  visit text nodes (i.e., unless $ignore_text is given and true), then when text nodes are visited,
       we will also pass two extra arguments to the callback:

           $_[3] : the element that's the parent
                    of this text node
           $_[4] : the index of this text node
                    in its parent's content list

       Note that you can specify that the pre-order routine can be a different routine from the post-order one:

           $h-&gt;traverse( [\&amp;pre_callback,\&amp;post_callback], ...);

       You can also specify that no post-order calls are to be made, by providing a false  value  as  the  post-
       order routine:

           $h-&gt;traverse([ \&amp;pre_callback,0 ], ...);

       And similarly for suppressing pre-order callbacks:

           $h-&gt;traverse([ 0,\&amp;post_callback ], ...);

       Note that these two syntaxes specify the same operation:

           $h-&gt;traverse([\&amp;foo,\&amp;foo], ...);
           $h-&gt;traverse( \&amp;foo       , ...);

       The return values from calls to your pre- or post-order routines are significant, and are used to control
       recursion into the tree.

       These are the values you can return, listed in descending order of my estimation of their usefulness:

       HTML::Element::OK, 1, or any other true value
           ...to keep on traversing.

           Note  that  "HTML::Element::OK"  et  al are constants.  So if you're running under "use strict" (as I
           hope you are), and you say: "return HTML::Element::PRUEN" the compiler will flag this as an error (an
           unallowable bareword, specifically), whereas if you spell PRUNE  correctly,  the  compiler  will  not
           complain.

       undef, 0, '0', '', or HTML::Element::PRUNE
           ...to  block  traversing  under  the  current element's content.  (This is ignored if received from a
           post-order callback, since by then the recursion has already happened.)  If this  is  returned  by  a
           pre-order  callback,  no  post-order callback for the current node will happen.  (Recall that if your
           callback exits with just "return;", it is  returning  undef  --  at  least  in  scalar  context,  and
           "traverse" always calls your callbacks in scalar context.)

       HTML::Element::ABORT
           ...to  abort  the whole traversal immediately.  This is often useful when you're looking for just the
           first node in the tree that meets some criterion of yours.

       HTML::Element::PRUNE_UP
           ...to abort continued traversal into this node and its parent node.  No post-order callback  for  the
           current or parent node will happen.

       HTML::Element::PRUNE_SOFTLY
           Like PRUNE, except that the post-order call for the current node is not blocked.

       Almost  every  task  to  do with extracting information from a tree can be expressed in terms of traverse
       operations (usually in only one pass, and usually paying attention to only pre-order, or  to  only  post-
       order),  or  operations  based  on  traversing.  (In  fact,  many  of the other methods in this class are
       basically calls to <b>traverse()</b> with particular arguments.)

       The source code for HTML::Element and HTML::TreeBuilder contain  several  examples  of  the  use  of  the
       "traverse" method to gather information about the content of trees and subtrees.

       (Note: you should not change the structure of a tree <u>while</u> you are traversing it.)

       [End of documentation for the "traverse()" method]

   <b>Traversing</b> <b>with</b> <b>Recursive</b> <b>Anonymous</b> <b>Routines</b>
       Now,  if  you've  been reading <u>Structure</u> <u>and</u> <u>Interpretation</u> <u>of</u> <u>Computer</u> <u>Programs</u> too much, maybe you even
       want a recursive lambda.  Go ahead:

         {
           my $counter = 'x0000';
           my $give_id;
           $give_id = sub {
             my $x = $_[0];
             $x-&gt;attr('id', $counter++) unless defined $x-&gt;attr('id');
             foreach my $c ($x-&gt;content_list) {
               $give_id-&gt;($c) if ref $c; # ignore text nodes
             }
           };
           $give_id-&gt;($start_node);
           undef $give_id;
         }

       It's a bit nutty, and it's <u>still</u> more concise than a call to the "traverse" method!

       It is left as an exercise to the reader to figure out how to do the same thing without using  a  $give_id
       symbol at all.

       It  is  also  left  as  an exercise to the reader to figure out why I undefine $give_id, above; and why I
       could achieved the same effect with any of:

           $give_id = 'I like pie!';
          # or...
           $give_id = [];
          # or even;
           $give_id = sub { print "Mmmm pie!\n" };

       But not:

           $give_id = sub { print "I'm $give_id and I like pie!\n" };
          # nor...
           $give_id = \$give_id;
          # nor...
           $give_id = { 'pie' =&gt; \$give_id, 'mode' =&gt; 'a la' };

   <b>Doing</b> <b>Recursive</b> <b>Things</b> <b>Iteratively</b>
       Note that you may at times see an iterative implementation of pre-order traversal, like so:

          {
            my @to_do = ($tree); # start-node
            while(@to_do) {
              my $this = shift @to_do;

              # "Visit" the node:
              $this-&gt;attr('id', $counter++)
               unless defined $this-&gt;attr('id');

              unshift @to_do, grep ref $_, $this-&gt;content_list;
               # Put children on the stack -- they'll be visited next
            }
          }

       This can <u>under</u> <u>certain</u> <u>circumstances</u> be more efficient than just a normal recursive routine, but  at  the
       cost  of  being  rather  obscure.   It gains efficiency by avoiding the overhead of function-calling, but
       since there are several method dispatches however you do it (to "attr" and "content_list"), the  overhead
       for a simple function call is insignificant.

   <b>Pruning</b> <b>and</b> <b>Whatnot</b>
       The  "traverse"  method  does have the fairly neat features of the "ABORT", "PRUNE_UP" and "PRUNE_SOFTLY"
       signals.  None of these can be implemented <u>totally</u> straightforwardly with recursive routines, but  it  is
       quite  possible.   "ABORT"-like  behavior  can  be implemented either with using non-local returning with
       "eval"/"die":

         my $died_on; # if you need to know where...
         sub thing {
           ... visits $_[0]...
           ... maybe set $died_on to $_[0] and die "ABORT_TRAV" ...
           ... else call thing($child) for each child...
           ...any post-order visiting $_[0]...
         }
         eval { thing($node) };
         if($@) {
           if($@ =~ m&lt;^ABORT_TRAV&gt;) {
             ...it died (aborted) on $died_on...
           } else {
             die $@; # some REAL error happened
           }
         }

       or you can just do it with flags:

         my($abort_flag, $died_on);
         sub thing {
           ... visits $_[0]...
           ... maybe set $abort_flag = 1; $died_on = $_[0]; return;
           foreach my $c ($_[0]-&gt;content_list) {
             thing($c);
             return if $abort_flag;
           }
           ...any post-order visiting $_[0]...
           return;
         }

         $abort_flag = $died_on = undef;
         thing($node);
         ...if defined $abort_flag, it died on $died_on
