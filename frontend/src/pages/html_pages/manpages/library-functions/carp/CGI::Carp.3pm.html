</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       CGI::Carp - CGI routines for writing to the HTTPD (or other) error log

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use CGI::Carp;

           croak "We're outta here!";
           confess "It was my fault: $!";
           carp "It was your fault!";
           warn "I'm confused";
           die  "I'm dying.\n";

           use CGI::Carp qw(cluck);
           cluck "I wouldn't do that if I were you";

           use CGI::Carp qw(fatalsToBrowser);
           die "Fatal error messages are now sent to browser";

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       CGI scripts have a nasty habit of leaving warning messages in the error logs that are neither time
       stamped nor fully identified.  Tracking down the script that caused the error is a pain.  This fixes
       that.  Replace the usual

           use Carp;

       with

           use CGI::Carp

       The standard <b>warn()</b>, die (), <b>croak()</b>, <b>confess()</b> and <b>carp()</b> calls will be replaced with functions that
       write time-stamped messages to the HTTP server error log.

       For example:

          [Fri Nov 17 21:40:43 1995] test.pl: I'm confused at test.pl line 3.
          [Fri Nov 17 21:40:43 1995] test.pl: Got an error message: Permission denied.
          [Fri Nov 17 21:40:43 1995] test.pl: I'm dying.

</pre><h4><b>REDIRECTING</b> <b>ERROR</b> <b>MESSAGES</b></h4><pre>
       By default, error messages are sent to STDERR.  Most HTTPD servers direct STDERR to the server's error
       log.  Some applications may wish to keep private error logs, distinct from the server's error log, or
       they may wish to direct error messages to STDOUT so that the browser will receive them.

       The carpout() function is provided for this purpose.  Since <b>carpout()</b> is not exported by default, you
       must import it explicitly by saying

          use CGI::Carp qw(carpout);

       The <b>carpout()</b> function requires one argument, a reference to an open filehandle for writing errors.  It
       should be called in a "BEGIN" block at the top of the CGI application so that compiler errors will be
       caught.  Example:

          BEGIN {
            use CGI::Carp qw(carpout);
            open(LOG, "&gt;&gt;/usr/local/cgi-logs/mycgi-log") or
              die("Unable to open mycgi-log: $!\n");
            carpout(LOG);
          }

       <b>carpout()</b> does not handle file locking on the log for you at this point.  Also, note that <b>carpout()</b> does
       not work with in-memory file handles, although a patch would be welcome to address that.

       The real STDERR is not closed -- it is moved to CGI::Carp::SAVEERR.  Some servers, when dealing with CGI
       scripts, close their connection to the browser when the script closes STDOUT and STDERR.
       CGI::Carp::SAVEERR is there to prevent this from happening prematurely.

       You can pass filehandles to <b>carpout()</b> in a variety of ways.  The "correct" way according to Tom
       Christiansen is to pass a reference to a filehandle GLOB:

           carpout(\*LOG);

       This looks weird to mere mortals however, so the following syntaxes are accepted as well:

           carpout(LOG);
           carpout(main::LOG);
           carpout(main'LOG);
           carpout(\LOG);
           carpout(\'main::LOG');

           ... and so on

       FileHandle and other objects work as well.

       Use of <b>carpout()</b> is not great for performance, so it is recommended for debugging purposes or for
       moderate-use applications.  A future version of this module may delay redirecting STDERR until one of the
       CGI::Carp methods is called to prevent the performance hit.

</pre><h4><b>MAKING</b> <b>PERL</b> <b>ERRORS</b> <b>APPEAR</b> <b>IN</b> <b>THE</b> <b>BROWSER</b> <b>WINDOW</b></h4><pre>
       If you want to send fatal (die, confess) errors to the browser, import the special "fatalsToBrowser"
       subroutine:

           use CGI::Carp qw(fatalsToBrowser);
           die "Bad error here";

       Fatal errors will now be echoed to the browser as well as to the log.  CGI::Carp arranges to send a
       minimal HTTP header to the browser so that even errors that occur in the early compile phase will be
       seen.  Nonfatal errors will still be directed to the log file only (unless redirected with carpout).

       Note that fatalsToBrowser may <b>not</b> work well with mod_perl version 2.0 and higher.

   <b>Changing</b> <b>the</b> <b>default</b> <b>message</b>
       By default, the software error message is followed by a note to contact the Webmaster by e-mail with the
       time and date of the error.  If this message is not to your liking, you can change it using the
       <b>set_message()</b> routine.  This is not imported by default; you should import it on the <b>use()</b> line:

           use CGI::Carp qw(fatalsToBrowser set_message);
           set_message("It's not a bug, it's a feature!");

       You may also pass in a code reference in order to create a custom error message.  At run time, your code
       will be called with the text of the error message that caused the script to die.  Example:

           use CGI::Carp qw(fatalsToBrowser set_message);
           BEGIN {
              sub handle_errors {
                 my $msg = shift;
                 print "&lt;h1&gt;Oh gosh&lt;/h1&gt;";
                 print "&lt;p&gt;Got an error: $msg&lt;/p&gt;";
             }
             set_message(\&amp;handle_errors);
           }

       In order to correctly intercept compile-time errors, you should call <b>set_message()</b> from within a BEGIN{}
       block.

</pre><h4><b>DOING</b> <b>MORE</b> <b>THAN</b> <b>PRINTING</b> <b>A</b> <b>MESSAGE</b> <b>IN</b> <b>THE</b> <b>EVENT</b> <b>OF</b> <b>PERL</b> <b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       If fatalsToBrowser in conjunction with set_message does not provide you with all of the functionality you
       need, you can go one step further by specifying a function to be executed any time a script calls "die",
       has a syntax error, or dies unexpectedly at runtime with a line like "undef-&gt;<b>explode()</b>;".

           use CGI::Carp qw(set_die_handler);
           BEGIN {
              sub handle_errors {
                 my $msg = shift;
                 print "content-type: text/html\n\n";
                 print "&lt;h1&gt;Oh gosh&lt;/h1&gt;";
                 print "&lt;p&gt;Got an error: $msg&lt;/p&gt;";

                 #proceed to send an email to a system administrator,
                 #write a detailed message to the browser and/or a log,
                 #etc....
             }
             set_die_handler(\&amp;handle_errors);
           }

       Notice that if you use <b>set_die_handler()</b>, you must handle sending HTML headers to the browser yourself if
       you are printing a message.

       If you use <b>set_die_handler()</b>, you will most likely interfere with the behavior of fatalsToBrowser, so you
       must use this or that, not both.

       Using <b>set_die_handler()</b> sets SIG{__DIE__} (as does fatalsToBrowser), and there is only one SIG{__DIE__}.
       This means that if you are attempting to set SIG{__DIE__} yourself, you may interfere with this module's
       functionality, or this module may interfere with your module's functionality.

</pre><h4><b>SUPPRESSING</b> <b>PERL</b> <b>ERRORS</b> <b>APPEARING</b> <b>IN</b> <b>THE</b> <b>BROWSER</b> <b>WINDOW</b></h4><pre>
       A problem sometimes encountered when using fatalsToBrowser is when a die() is done inside an "eval" body
       or expression.  Even though the fatalsToBrower support takes precautions to avoid this, you still may get
       the error message printed to STDOUT.  This may have some undesirable effects when the purpose of doing
       the eval is to determine which of several algorithms is to be used.

       By setting $CGI::Carp::TO_BROWSER to 0 you can suppress printing the "die" messages but without all of
       the complexity of using "set_die_handler".  You can localize this effect to inside "eval" bodies if this
       is desirable: For example:

        eval {
          local $CGI::Carp::TO_BROWSER = 0;
          die "Fatal error messages not sent browser"
        }
        # $@ will contain error message

</pre><h4><b>MAKING</b> <b>WARNINGS</b> <b>APPEAR</b> <b>AS</b> <b>HTML</b> <b>COMMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       It is also possible to make non-fatal errors appear as HTML comments embedded in the output of your
       program.  To enable this feature, export the new "warningsToBrowser" subroutine.  Since sending warnings
       to the browser before the HTTP headers have been sent would cause an error, any warnings are stored in an
       internal buffer until you call the <b>warningsToBrowser()</b> subroutine with a true argument:

           use CGI::Carp qw(fatalsToBrowser warningsToBrowser);
           use CGI qw(:standard);
           print header();
           <a href="../man1/warningsToBrowser.1.html">warningsToBrowser</a>(1);

       You may also give a false argument to <b>warningsToBrowser()</b> to prevent warnings from being sent to the
       browser while you are printing some content where HTML comments are not allowed:

           <a href="../man0/warningsToBrowser.0.html">warningsToBrowser</a>(0);    # disable warnings
           print "&lt;script type=\"text/javascript\"&gt;&lt;!--\n";
           print_some_javascript_code();
           print "//--&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n";
           <a href="../man1/warningsToBrowser.1.html">warningsToBrowser</a>(1);    # re-enable warnings

       Note: In this respect <b>warningsToBrowser()</b> differs fundamentally from <b>fatalsToBrowser()</b>, which you should
       never call yourself!

</pre><h4><b>OVERRIDING</b> <b>THE</b> <b>NAME</b> <b>OF</b> <b>THE</b> <b>PROGRAM</b></h4><pre>
       CGI::Carp includes the name of the program that generated the error or warning in the messages written to
       the log and the browser window.  Sometimes, Perl can get confused about what the actual name of the
       executed program was.  In these cases, you can override the program name that CGI::Carp will use for all
       messages.

       The quick way to do that is to tell CGI::Carp the name of the program in its use statement.  You can do
       that by adding "name=cgi_carp_log_name" to your "use" statement.  For example:

           use CGI::Carp qw(name=cgi_carp_log_name);

       .  If you want to change the program name partway through the program, you can use the set_progname()
       function instead.  It is not exported by default, you must import it explicitly by saying

           use CGI::Carp qw(set_progname);

       Once you've done that, you can change the logged name of the program at any time by calling

           set_progname(new_program_name);

       You can set the program back to the default by calling

           set_progname(undef);

       Note that this override doesn't happen until after the program has compiled, so any compile-time errors
       will still show up with the non-overridden program name

</pre><h4><b>TURNING</b> <b>OFF</b> <b>TIMESTAMPS</b> <b>IN</b> <b>MESSAGES</b></h4><pre>
       If your web server automatically adds a timestamp to each log line, you may not need CGI::Carp to add its
       own. You can disable timestamping by importing "noTimestamp":

           use CGI::Carp qw(noTimestamp);

       Alternatively you can set $CGI::Carp::NO_TIMESTAMP to 1.

       Note that the name of the program is still automatically included in the message.

</pre><h4><b>GETTING</b> <b>THE</b> <b>FULL</b> <b>PATH</b> <b>OF</b> <b>THE</b> <b>SCRIPT</b> <b>IN</b> <b>MESSAGES</b></h4><pre>
       Set $CGI::Carp::FULL_PATH to 1.
