</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 2.24

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Travel::Routing::DE::EFA::Route::Part</b> holds one specific connection (without interchanges) between two
       points.  It specifies the start/stop point and time, the train line and its destination, and optional
       additional data.

       It is usually obtained by a call to <b>Travel::Routing::DE::EFA::<a href="../man3pm/Route.3pm.html">Route</a></b>(3pm)'s <b>parts</b> method.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>ACCESSORS</b>
       "Actual" in the description means that the delay (if available) is already included in the calculation,
       "Scheduled" means it isn't.

       $part-&gt;arrival_delay
           arrival delay in minutes, 0 if unknown

       $part-&gt;arrival_stop
           arrival stop (city name plus station name)

       $part-&gt;arrival_platform
           arrival platform (either "Gleis x" or "Bstg. x")

       $part-&gt;arrival_stop_and_platform
           "stop: platform" concatenation

       $part-&gt;arrival_date
           Actual arrival date in DD.MM.YYYY format

       $part-&gt;arrival_time
           Actual arrival time in HH:MM format

       $part-&gt;arrival_sdate
           Scheduled arrival date in DD.MM.YYYY format

       $part-&gt;arrival_stime
           Scheduled arrival time in HH:MM format

       $part-&gt;arrival_routemaps
           List  of  URLs,  may  be  empty.  Each  URL poinst to a transfer map for the arrival station, usually
           outlining how to transfer from this train to the next one (if applicable).

       $part-&gt;arrival_stationmaps
           List of URLs, may be empty. Each URL points to an HTML map of the arrival station.

       $part-&gt;current_notes
           Remarks about unscheduled changes to the line serving this connaction part, such as cancelled  stops.
           Most times, the EFA service does not include this information in its route calculations.

           Returns a list of <b>Travel::Routing::DE::EFA::Route::<a href="../man3pm/Message.3pm.html">Message</a></b>(3pm) objects.

       $part-&gt;delay
           alias for departure_delay

       $part-&gt;departure_delay
           departure delay in minutes, 0 if unknown

       $part-&gt;departure_stop
           departure stop (city name plus station name)

       $part-&gt;departure_platform
           departure platform (either "Gleis x" or "Bstg. x")

       $part-&gt;departure_stop_and_platform
           "stop: platform" concatenation

       $part-&gt;departure_date
           Actual departure date in DD.MM.YYYY format

       $part-&gt;departure_time
           Actual departure time in HH:MM format

       $part-&gt;departure_sdate
           Scheduled departure date in DD.MM.YYYY format

       $part-&gt;departure_stime
           Scheduled departure time in HH:MM format

       $part-&gt;departure_routemaps
           List  of  URLs,  may  be  empty.  Each  URL points to a PDF a transfer map for the departure station,
           usually outlining how to transfer from thep previous train (if applicable) to this one.

       $part-&gt;departure_stationmaps
           List of URLs, may be empty. Each URL poinst to an HTML map of the departure station.

       $part-&gt;footpath_duration
           Walking duration when transferring before / after / during this trip in minutes. The meaning  depends
           on the value of <b>footpath_type</b>.

       $part-&gt;footpath_parts
           Returns a list of [<u>type</u>, <u>level</u>] arrayrefs describing the footpath. For instance, ["ESCALATOR", "UP"],
           ["LEVEL",  "LEVEL"],  ["STAIRS",  "UP"] means first taking an escalator up, then walking a while, and
           then taking a flight of stairs up again.

           The content of <u>type</u> and <u>level</u> comes directly from the EFA  backend.  At  the  moment,  the  following
           values are known:

           type: ESCALATOR, LEVEL, STAIRS
           level: DOWN, LEVEL, UP
       $part-&gt;footpath_type
           type  of  this  footpath, passed through from the EFA backend. The value "AFTER" indicates a footpath
           (transfer) after this route part. The value "IDEST" indicates that  this  route  part  already  is  a
           footpath  (aka  a  walking connection between two stops), so the <b>footpath</b> accessors contain redundant
           information. Other values such as "BEFORE" may also be returned, but this is unknown at this point.

       $part-&gt;is_cancelled
           Returns true if this part of the route has  been  cancelled  (i.e.,  the  entire  route  is  probably
           useless),  false  otherwise.   For  unknown  reasons,  EFA  may sometimes return routes which contain
           cancelled departures.

       $part-&gt;occupancy
           Returns expected occupancy, if available. Values range  from  1  (low  occupancy)  to  3  (very  high
           occupancy).

       $part-&gt;regular_notes
           Remarks    about    the    line    serving    this    connaction    part.    Returns    a   list   of
           <b>Travel::Routing::DE::EFA::Route::<a href="../man3pm/Message.3pm.html">Message</a></b>(3pm) objects.

       $part-&gt;train_destination
           Destination of the line providing the connection. May be empty.

       $part-&gt;train_line
           Name / number of the line. May be empty.

       $part-&gt;train_product
           Usually the prefix of <b>train_line</b>, for instance "U-Bahn" or "Niederflurstrab". However,  it  may  also
           contain special values such as "Fussweg" (for a direct connection without transit vehicles) or "nicht
           umsteigen"  (in case a vehicle changes its line number at a stop).  In those cases, <b>train_destination</b>
           and <b>train_line</b> are usually empty.

       $part-&gt;via
           Returns a list of "[ "DD.MM.YYYY", "HH:MM", stop, platform, delay ]"  arrayrefs  encoding  the  stops
           passed  between  <b>departure_stop</b>  and  <b>arrival_stop</b>, if supported by the backend. Returns nothing / an
           empty list otherwise. Date and time refer to schedule data and do not account for delays.
