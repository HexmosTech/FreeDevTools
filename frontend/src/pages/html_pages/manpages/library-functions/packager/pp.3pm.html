       pp - PAR Packager

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pp</b> [ <b>-ABCEFILMPTSVXacdefghilmnoprsuvxz</b> ] [ <u>parfile</u> | <u>scriptfile</u> ]...

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Note: When running on Microsoft Windows, the <u>a.out</u> below will be replaced by <u>a.exe</u> instead.

           % pp hello.pl               # Pack 'hello.pl' into executable 'a.out'
           % pp -o hello hello.pl      # Pack 'hello.pl' into executable 'hello'
                                       # (or 'hello.exe' on Win32)

           % pp -o foo foo.pl bar.pl   # Pack 'foo.pl' and 'bar.pl' into 'foo'
           % ./foo                     # Run 'foo.pl' inside 'foo'
           % mv foo bar; ./bar         # Run 'bar.pl' inside 'foo'
           % mv bar baz; ./baz         # Error: Can't open perl script "baz"

           % pp -p file                # Creates a PAR file, 'a.par'
           % pp -o hello a.par         # Pack 'a.par' to executable 'hello'
           % pp -S -o hello file       # Combine the two steps above

           % pp -p -o out.par file     # Creates 'out.par' from 'file'
           % pp -B -p -o out.par file  # same as above, but bundles core modules
                                       # and removes any local paths from @INC
           % pp -P -o out.pl file      # Creates 'out.pl' from 'file'
           % pp -B -p -o out.pl file   # same as above, but bundles core modules
                                       # and removes any local paths from @INC
                                       # (-B is assumed when making executables)

           % pp -e "print 123"         # Pack a one-liner into 'a.out'
           % pp -p -e "print 123"      # Creates a PAR file 'a.par'
           % pp -P -e "print 123"      # Creates a perl script 'a.pl'

           % pp -c hello               # Check dependencies from "perl -c hello"
           % pp -x hello               # Check dependencies from "perl hello"
           % pp -n -x hello            # same as above, but skips static scanning

           % pp -I /foo hello          # Extra include paths
           % pp -M Foo::Bar hello      # Extra modules in the include path
           % pp -M abbrev.pl hello     # Extra libraries in the include path
           % pp -X Foo::Bar hello      # Exclude modules
           % pp -a data.txt hello      # Additional data files

           % pp -r hello               # Pack 'hello' into 'a.out', runs 'a.out'
           % pp -r hello a b c         # Pack 'hello' into 'a.out', runs 'a.out'
                                       # with arguments 'a b c'

           % pp hello --log=c          # Pack 'hello' into 'a.out', logs
                                       # messages into 'c'

           # Pack 'hello' into a console-less 'out.exe' (Win32 only)
           % pp --gui -o out.exe hello

           % pp @file hello.pl         # Pack 'hello.pl' but read _additional_
                                       # options from file 'file'

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>pp</u> creates standalone executables from Perl programs, using the compressed packager provided by PAR, and
       dependency detection heuristics offered by Module::ScanDeps.  Source files are compressed verbatim
       without compilation.

       You may think of <u>pp</u> as "<u>perlcc</u> that works without hassle". :-)

       A GUI interface is also available as the <u>tkpp</u> command.

       It does <b>not</b> provide the compilation-step acceleration provided by <u>perlcc</u> (however, see <b>-f</b> below for byte-
       compiled, source-hiding techniques), but makes up for it with better reliability, smaller executable
       size, and full retrieval of original source code.

       When a single input program is specified, the resulting executable will behave identically as that
       program.  However, when multiple programs are packaged, the produced executable will run the one that has
       the same basename as $0 (i.e. the filename used to invoke it).  If nothing matches, it dies with the
       error "Can't open perl script "$0"".

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Options are available in a <u>short</u> form and a <u>long</u> form.  For example, the three lines below are all
       equivalent:

           % pp -o output.exe input.pl
           % pp --output output.exe input.pl
           % pp --output=output.exe input.pl

       Since the command lines can become sufficiently long to reach the limits imposed by some shells, it is
       possible to have <u>pp</u> read some of its options from one or more text files. The basic usage is to just
       include an argument starting with an 'at' (@) sigil. This argument will be interpreted as a file to read
       options from. Mixing ordinary options and @file options is possible. This is implemented using the
       Getopt::ArgvFile module, so read its documentation for advanced usage.  Note that Getopt::ArgvFile is
       used here with parameter "resolveEnvVars=1", i.e. substrings of the form ${<u>FOO</u>"}" in the contents of
       @file are replaced with the value of environment variable <u>FOO</u>.

       <b>-a</b>, <b>--addfile</b>=<u>FILE</u>|<u>DIR</u>
           Add  an  extra  file  into the package.  If the file is a directory, recursively add all files inside
           that directory, with links turned into actual files.

           By default, files are placed under "/" inside  the  package  with  their  original  names.   You  may
           override this by appending the target filename after a ";", like this:

               % pp -a "old_filename.txt;new_filename.txt"
               % pp -a "old_dirname;new_dirname"

           You may specify "-a" multiple times.

       <b>-A</b>, <b>--addlist</b>=<u>FILE</u>
           Read  a  list  of file/directory names from <u>FILE</u>, adding them into the package.  Each line in <u>FILE</u> is
           taken as an argument to <b>-a</b> above.

           You may specify "-A" multiple times.

       <b>-B</b>, <b>--bundle</b>
           Bundle core modules in the resulting package.  This option is enabled by default, except when "-p" or
           "-P" is specified.

           Since PAR version 0.953, this also strips any local paths from the list of module search  paths  @INC
           before running the contained script.

       <b>-C</b>, <b>--clean</b>
           Clean  up  temporary  files  extracted  from the application at runtime.  By default, these files are
           cached in the temporary directory; this allows the program to start up faster next time.

       <b>-c</b>, <b>--compile</b>
           Run "perl -c inputfile" to determine additional run-time dependencies.

       <b>-cd</b>, <b>--cachedeps</b>=<u>FILE</u>
           Use <u>FILE</u> to cache detected dependencies. Creates <u>FILE</u> unless present. This will speed up the scanning
           process on subsequent runs.

       <b>-d</b>, <b>--dependent</b>
           Reduce the executable size by not including a copy of perl interpreter.  Executables built  this  way
           will  need  a separate <u>perl5x.dll</u> or <u>libperl.so</u> to function correctly.  This option is only available
           if perl is built as a shared library.

       <b>-e</b>, <b>--eval</b>=<u>STRING</u>
           Package a one-liner, much the same as "perl -e '...'"

       <b>-E</b>, <b>--evalfeature</b>=<u>STRING</u>
           Behaves just like "-e", except that  it  implicitly  enables  all  optional  features  (in  the  main
           compilation unit) with Perl 5.10 and later.  See feature.

       <b>-x</b>, <b>--execute</b>
           Run "perl inputfile" to determine additional run-time dependencies.

           Using  this  option,  <u>pp</u>  may be able to detect the use of modules that can't be determined by static
           analysis of "inputfile". Examples are stuff  loaded  by  run-time  loaders  like  Module::Runtime  or
           "plugin"  loaders like Module::Loader. Note that which modules are detected depends on which parts of
           your program are exercised when running "inputfile". E.g. if your program immediately terminates when
           run as "perl inputfile" because it lacks mandatory arguments, then this option will probably have  no
           effect. You may use <b>--xargs</b> to supply arguments in this case.

       <b>--xargs</b>=<u>STRING</u>
           If  <b>-x</b> is given, splits the "STRING" using the function "shellwords" from Text::ParseWords and passes
           the result as @ARGV when running "perl inputfile".

       <b>-X</b>, <b>--exclude</b>=<u>MODULE</u>
           Exclude the given module from the dependency search path and from the package. If the given file is a
           zip or par or par executable, all the  files  in  the  given  file  (except  MANIFEST,  META.yml  and
           script/*) will be excluded and the output file will "use" the given file at runtime.

       <b>-f</b>, <b>--filter</b>=<u>FILTER</u>
           Filter source script(s) with a PAR::Filter subclass.  You may specify multiple such filters.

           If you wish to hide the source code from casual prying, this will do:

               % pp -f Bleach source.pl

           If  you  are  more  serious  about  hiding  your  source  code, you should have a look at Steve Hay's
           PAR::Filter::Crypto module. Make sure you understand the Filter::Crypto caveats!

           Note: Most filters are incompatible with "__DATA__" sections in your source.  The  packed  executable
           typically aborts with an error message like

             readline() on unopened filehandle DATA at (eval 13) line 3.

       <b>-g</b>, <b>--gui</b>
           Build  an  executable  that  does  not  have  a console window. This option is ignored on non-MSWin32
           platforms or when "-p" is specified.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Show basic usage information.

       <b>-I</b>, <b>--lib</b>=<u>DIR</u>
           Add the given directory to the perl module search path.  May be specified multiple times.

       <b>-l</b>, <b>--link</b>=<u>FILE</u>|<u>LIBRARY</u>
           Add the given shared library (a.k.a. shared object or DLL) into the packed file.  Also accepts  names
           under  library  paths;  i.e.   "-l  ncurses"  means  the  same  thing  as  "-l  libncurses.so" or "-l
           /usr/local/lib/libncurses.so" in most Unixes.  May be specified multiple times.

       <b>-L</b>, <b>--log</b>=<u>FILE</u>
           Log the output of packaging to a file rather than to stdout.

       <b>-F</b>, <b>--modfilter</b>=<u>FILTER[=REGEX]</u>,
           Filter included perl module(s) with a PAR::Filter subclass.  You may specify multiple such filters.

           By default, the <u>PodStrip</u> filter is applied.  In case that causes trouble, you can turn  this  off  by
           setting the environment variable "PAR_VERBATIM" to 1.

           Since  PAR 0.958, you can use an optional regular expression (<u>REGEX</u> above) to select the files in the
           archive which should be filtered. The regular expression is matched  against  module  names  as  they
           would appear as keys in %INC, e.g. "Foo/Bar.pm" for module "Foo::Bar".  Examples:

             pp -o foo.exe -F 'Bleach=warnings\.pm$' foo.pl

           This  creates  a  binary executable <u>foo.exe</u> from <u>foo.pl</u> packaging all files as usual except for files
           ending in "warnings.pm" which are filtered with PAR::Filter::Bleach.

             pp -o foo.exe -F 'Bleach=^(?!Win32/)' foo.pl

           This "bleaches" all modules <b>except</b> those in the "Win32::" namespace.

           Note: The same restriction on "__DATA__" sections holds as for <b>--filter</b>.

       <b>-M</b>, <b>--module</b>=<u>MODULE</u>
           Add the specified module into the package, along with its dependencies.

           The following variants may be used to add whole module namespaces:

           <b>-M</b> <b>Foo::**</b>
               Add  every  module  in  the  "Foo"  namespace  <b>except</b>  "Foo"  itself,   i.e.    add   "Foo::Bar",
               "Foo::Bar::Quux" etc up to any depth.

           <b>-M</b> <b>Foo::*</b>
               Add  every  module  at  level  1  in  the  "Foo"  namespace,  i.e.   add  "Foo::Bar", but <b>neither</b>
               "Foo::Bar::Quux" <b>nor</b> "Foo".

           <b>-M</b> <b>Foo::</b>
               Shorthand for "-M Foo -M Foo:**": every module in the "Foo" namespace including "Foo" itself.

           Instead of a module name, <u>MODULE</u> may also be specified as a filename relative to the @INC path,  i.e.
           "-M Module/ScanDeps.pm" means the same thing as "-M Module::ScanDeps".

           If  <u>MODULE</u>  has  an extension that is not ".pm"/".ix"/".al", it will not be scanned for dependencies,
           and will be placed under "/" instead of "<a href="file:/lib/">/lib/</a>" inside the PAR  file.   This  use  is  <b>deprecated</b>  --
           consider using the <b>-a</b> option instead.

           You may specify "-M" multiple times.

       <b>-m</b>, <b>--multiarch</b>
           Build a multi-architecture PAR file.  Implies <b>-p</b>.

       <b>-n</b>, <b>--noscan</b>
           Skip the default static scanning altogether, using run-time dependencies from <b>-c</b> or <b>-x</b> exclusively.

       <b>-N</b>, <b>--namespace</b>=<u>NAMESPACE</u>
           Add  all  modules in the namespace into the package, along with their dependencies. If "NAMESPACE" is
           something like "Foo::Bar" then this will add all modules "Foo/Bar/Quux.pm",  "Foo/Bar/Fred/Barnie.pm"
           etc  that can be located in your module search path. It mimics the behaviour of "plugin" loaders like
           Module::Loader.

           This is different from using "-M Foo::Bar::", as the latter  insists  on  adding  "Foo/Bar.pm"  which
           might not exist in the above "plugin" scenario.

           You may specify "-N" multiple times.

       <b>-o</b>, <b>--output</b>=<u>FILE</u>
           File name for the final packaged executable.

       <b>-p</b>, <b>--par</b>
           Create PAR archives only; do not package to a standalone binary.

       <b>-P</b>, <b>--perlscript</b>
           Create stand-alone perl script; do not package to a standalone binary.

       <b>-r</b>, <b>--run</b>
           Run the resulting packaged script after packaging it.

       <b>--reusable</b>
           <b>EXPERIMENTAL</b>

           Make  the  packaged  executable reusable for running arbitrary, external Perl scripts as if they were
           part of the package:

             pp -o myapp --reusable someapp.pl
             ./myapp --par-options --reuse otherapp.pl

           The second line will run <u>otherapp.pl</u> instead of <u>someapp.pl</u>.

       <b>-S</b>, <b>--save</b>
           Do not delete generated PAR file after packaging.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--sign</b>
           Cryptographically sign the generated PAR or binary file using Module::Signature.

       <b>-T</b>, <b>--tempcache</b>
           Set the program unique part of the cache directory name that is used if the program  is  run  without
           -C. If not set, a hash of the executable is used.

           When  the program is run, its contents are extracted to a temporary directory.  On Unix systems, this
           is commonly <u>/tmp/par-USER/cache-XXXXXXX</u>.  <u>USER</u> is replaced by  the  name  of  the  user  running  the
           program, but "spelled" in hex.  <u>XXXXXXX</u> is either a hash of the executable or the value passed to the
           "-T" or "--tempcache" switch.

       <b>-u</b>, <b>--unicode</b>
           Note: This option is ignored for Perl 5.32 and above.

           Package Unicode support (essentially <u>utf8_heavy.pl</u> and everything below the directory <u>unicore</u> in your
           perl library).

           This  option  exists  because  it  is impossible to detect using static analysis whether your program
           needs Unicode support at runtime. (Note: If your program contains "use utf8" this does <b>not</b>  imply  it
           needs Unicode support. It merely says that your program source is written in UTF-8.)

           If your packed program exits with an error message like

             Can't locate utf8_heavy.pl in @INC (@INC contains: ...)

           try to pack it with "-u" (or use "-x").

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>[=<u>NUMBER</u>]
           Increase  verbosity  of output; <u>NUMBER</u> is an integer from 1 to 3, 3 being the most verbose.  Defaults
           to 1 if specified without an argument.  Alternatively, <b>-vv</b> sets verbose level to 2, and <b>-vvv</b> sets  it
           to 3.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
           Display the version number and copyrights of this program.

       <b>-z</b>, <b>--compress</b>=<u>NUMBER</u>
           Set zip compression level; <u>NUMBER</u> is an integer from 0 to 9, 0 = no compression, 9 = max compression.
           Defaults to 6 if <b>-z</b> is not used.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       PP_OPTS
           Command-line  options  (switches).   Switches  in this variable are taken as if they were on every <u>pp</u>
           command line.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       Here are some recipes showing how to utilize <u>pp</u> to bundle <u>source.pl</u> with all its dependencies, on  target
       machines with different expected settings:

       Stone-alone setup:
           To make a stand-alone executable, suitable for running on a machine that doesn't have perl installed:

               % pp -o packed.exe source.pl        # makes packed.exe
               # Now, deploy 'packed.exe' to target machine...
               $ packed.exe                        # run it

       Perl interpreter only, without core modules:
           To  make  a packed .pl file including core modules, suitable for running on a machine that has a perl
           interpreter, but where you want to be sure of the versions of the  core  modules  that  your  program
           uses:

               % pp -B -P -o packed.pl source.pl   # makes packed.pl
               # Now, deploy 'packed.pl' to target machine...
               $ perl packed.pl                    # run it

       Perl with core modules installed:
           To  make a packed .pl file without core modules, relying on the target machine's perl interpreter and
           its core libraries.  This produces a significantly smaller file than the previous version:

               % pp -P -o packed.pl source.pl      # makes packed.pl
               # Now, deploy 'packed.pl' to target machine...
               $ perl packed.pl                    # run it

       Perl with PAR.pm and its dependencies installed:
           Make a separate archive and executable that uses the archive. This relies upon the  perl  interpreter
           and libraries on the target machine.

               % pp -p source.pl                   # makes source.par
               % echo "use PAR 'source.par';" &gt; packed.pl;
               % cat source.pl &gt;&gt; packed.pl;       # makes packed.pl
               # Now, deploy 'source.par' and 'packed.pl' to target machine...
               $ perl packed.pl                    # run it, perl + core modules required

       Note  that even if your perl was built with a shared library, the 'Stand-alone executable' above will <u>not</u>
       need a separate <u>perl5x.dll</u> or <u>libperl.so</u> to function correctly.  But even in this  case,  the  underlying
       system libraries such as <u>libc</u> must be compatible between the host and target machines.  Use "--dependent"
       if  you  are  willing to ship the shared library with the application, which can significantly reduce the
       executable size.
