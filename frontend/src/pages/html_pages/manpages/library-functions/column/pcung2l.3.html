       Notes
       =====

       Each  global  data  object  is  described  by  an  associated description vector.  This vector stores the
       information required to establish the mapping between an object element and its corresponding process and
       memory location.

       Let A be a generic term for any 2D block  cyclicly  distributed  array.   Such  a  global  array  has  an
       associated  description  vector  DESCA.  In the following comments, the character _ should be read as "of
       the global array".

       NOTATION        STORED IN      EXPLANATION
       --------------- -------------- -------------------------------------- DTYPE_A(global) DESCA( DTYPE_  )The
       descriptor type.  In this case,
                                      DTYPE_A = 1.
       CTXT_A (global) DESCA( CTXT_ ) The BLACS context handle, indicating
                                      the BLACS process grid A is distribu-
                                      ted over. The context itself is glo-
                                      bal, but the handle (the integer
                                      value) may vary.
       M_A    (global) DESCA( M_ )    The number of rows in the global
                                      array A.
       N_A    (global) DESCA( N_ )    The number of columns in the global
                                      array A.
       MB_A   (global) DESCA( MB_ )   The blocking factor used to distribute
                                      the rows of the array.
       NB_A   (global) DESCA( NB_ )   The blocking factor used to distribute
                                      the columns of the array.
       RSRC_A (global) DESCA( RSRC_ ) The process row over which the first
                                      row  of  the  array  A is distributed.  CSRC_A (global) DESCA( CSRC_ ) The
       process column over which the
                                      first column of the array A is
                                      distributed.
       LLD_A  (local)  DESCA( LLD_ )  The leading dimension of the local
                                      array.  LLD_A &gt;= MAX(1,LOCr(M_A)).

       Let K be the number of rows or columns of a distributed matrix, and assume  that  its  process  grid  has
       dimension p x q.
       LOCr( K ) denotes the number of elements of K that a process would receive if K were distributed over the
       p processes of its process column.
       Similarly,  LOCc(  K  )  denotes  the  number  of  elements  of  K that a process would receive if K were
       distributed over the q processes of its process row.
       The values of LOCr() and LOCc() may be determined via a call to the ScaLAPACK tool function, NUMROC:
               LOCr( M ) = NUMROC( M, MB_A, MYROW, RSRC_A, NPROW ),
               LOCc( N ) = NUMROC( N, NB_A, MYCOL, CSRC_A, NPCOL ).  An upper bound for these quantities may  be
       computed by:
               LOCr( M ) &lt;= ceil( ceil(M/MB_A)/NPROW )*MB_A
               LOCc( N ) &lt;= ceil( ceil(N/NB_A)/NPCOL )*NB_A

</pre><h4><b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       M       (global input) INTEGER
               The  number of rows to be operated on i.e the number of rows of the distributed submatrix Q. M &gt;=
               0.

       N       (global input) INTEGER
               The number of columns to be operated on i.e the number of columns of the distributed submatrix Q.
               M &gt;= N &gt;= 0.

       K       (global input) INTEGER
               The number of elementary reflectors whose product defines the matrix Q. N &gt;= K &gt;= 0.

       A       (local input/local output) COMPLEX pointer into the
               local memory to an array of dimension (LLD_A,LOCc(JA+N-1)).   On  entry,  the  j-th  column  must
               contain  the  vector  which  defines  the  elementary  reflector  H(j), JA+N-K &lt;= j &lt;= JA+N-1, as
               returned by PCGEQLF in the K columns of its distributed matrix argument A(IA:*,JA+N-K:JA+N-1). On
               exit, this array contains the local pieces of the M-by-N distributed matrix Q.

       IA      (global input) INTEGER
               The row index in the global array A indicating the first row of sub( A ).

       JA      (global input) INTEGER
               The column index in the global array A indicating the first column of sub( A ).

       DESCA   (global and local input) INTEGER array of dimension DLEN_.
               The array descriptor for the distributed matrix A.

       TAU     (local input) COMPLEX, array, dimension LOCc(JA+N-1)
               This array contains the scalar factors TAU(j) of the elementary reflectors H(j)  as  returned  by
               PCGEQLF.  TAU is tied to the distributed matrix A.

       WORK    (local workspace/local output) COMPLEX array,
               dimension (LWORK) On exit, <a href="../man1/WORK.1.html">WORK</a>(1) returns the minimal and optimal LWORK.

       LWORK   (local or global input) INTEGER
               The  dimension of the array WORK.  LWORK is local input and must be at least LWORK &gt;= MpA0 + MAX(
               1, NqA0 ), where

               IROFFA = MOD( IA-1, MB_A ), ICOFFA = MOD( JA-1, NB_A ), IAROW = INDXG2P( IA, MB_A, MYROW, RSRC_A,
               NPROW ), IACOL = INDXG2P( JA, NB_A, MYCOL, CSRC_A, NPCOL ), MpA0 = NUMROC( M+IROFFA, MB_A, MYROW,
               IAROW, NPROW ), NqA0 = NUMROC( N+ICOFFA, NB_A, MYCOL, IACOL, NPCOL ),

               INDXG2P and NUMROC are ScaLAPACK tool functions; MYROW, MYCOL, NPROW and NPCOL can be  determined
               by calling the subroutine BLACS_GRIDINFO.

               If  LWORK  =  -1,  then  LWORK is global input and a workspace query is assumed; the routine only
               calculates the minimum and optimal size for all work arrays. Each of these values is returned  in
               the first entry of the corresponding work array, and no error message is issued by PXERBLA.

       INFO    (local output) INTEGER
               = 0:  successful exit
               &lt;  0:   If  the  i-th  argument  is  an  array  and the j-entry had an illegal value, then INFO =
               -(i*100+j), if the i-th argument is a scalar and had an illegal value, then INFO = -i.
