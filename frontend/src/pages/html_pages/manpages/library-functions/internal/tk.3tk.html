       tk - Manipulate Tk internal state

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>tk</b> <u>option</u> ?<u>arg</u> <u>...</u>?
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>tk</b> command provides access to miscellaneous elements of Tk's internal state.  Most of the information
       manipulated  by  this  command  pertains to the application as a whole, or to a screen or display, rather
       than to a particular window.  The command can take any of a number of different forms  depending  on  the
       <u>option</u> argument.  The legal forms are:

       <b>tk</b> <b>appname</b> ?<u>newName</u>?
              If  <u>newName</u>  is not specified, this command returns the name of the application (the name that may
              be used in <b>send</b> commands to communicate with the application).  If <u>newName</u> is specified, then  the
              name of the application is changed to <u>newName</u>.  If the given name is already in use, then a suffix
              of  the form “ <b>#2</b>” or “ <b>#3</b>” is appended in order to make the name unique.  The command's result is
              the name actually chosen.  <u>newName</u> should not start with a capital letter.   This  will  interfere
              with  option  processing,  since  names  starting  with  capitals are assumed to be classes;  as a
              result, Tk may not be able to find some options for the application.  If sends have been  disabled
              by deleting the <b>send</b> command, this command will reenable them and recreate the <b>send</b> command.

       <b>tk</b> <b>busy</b> <u>subcommand</u> ...
              This  command controls the marking of window hierarchies as “busy”, rendering them non-interactive
              while some other operation is proceeding. For more details see the <b>busy</b> manual page.

       <b>tk</b> <b>caret</b> <u>window</u> ?<b>-x</b> <u>x</u>? ?<b>-y</b> <u>y</u>? ?<b>-height</b> <u>height</u>?
              Sets and queries the caret location for the display of the specified Tk window <u>window</u>.  The  caret
              is the per-display cursor location used for indicating global focus (e.g. to comply with Microsoft
              Accessibility  guidelines),  as well as for location of the over-the-spot XIM (X Input Methods) or
              Windows IME windows.  If no options are specified, the last values used for setting the caret  are
              return  in option-value pair format.  <b>-x</b> and <b>-y</b> represent window-relative coordinates, and <b>-height</b>
              is the height of the current cursor location, or the height of the specified  <u>window</u>  if  none  is
              given.

       <b>tk</b> <b>inactive</b> ?<b>-displayof</b> <u>window</u>? ?<b>reset</b>?
              Returns  a  positive  integer,  the number of milliseconds since the last time the user interacted
              with the system. If the <b>-displayof</b> option is given then the return value refers to the display  of
              <u>window</u>; otherwise it refers to the display of the application's main window.

              <b>tk</b> <b>inactive</b> will return -1, if querying the user inactive time is not supported by the system, and
              in safe interpreters.

              If  the  literal  string <b>reset</b> is given as an additional argument, the timer is reset and an empty
              string is returned. Resetting the inactivity time is forbidden in safe interpreters and will throw
              an error if tried.

       <b>tk</b> <b>fontchooser</b> <u>subcommand</u> ...
              Controls the Tk font selection dialog. For more details see the <b>fontchooser</b> manual page.

       <b>tk</b> <b>print</b> <u>window</u>
              The <b>tk</b> <b>print</b> command posts a dialog that allows users to print output from  the  <b>canvas</b>  and  <b>text</b>
              widgets.  The  printing  will  be done using platform-native APIs and dialogs where available. For
              more details see the <b>print</b> manual page.

       <b>tk</b> <b>scaling</b> ?<b>-displayof</b> <u>window</u>? ?<u>number</u>?
              Sets and queries the current scaling factor used by Tk to  convert  between  physical  units  (for
              example,  points,  inches,  or  millimeters)  and pixels.  The <u>number</u> argument is a floating point
              number that specifies the number of pixels per point on <u>window</u>'s display.  If the <u>window</u>  argument
              is  omitted, it defaults to the main window.  If the <u>number</u> argument is omitted, the current value
              of the scaling factor is returned.

              A “point” is a unit of measurement equal to 1/72 inch.  A scaling factor of 1.0 corresponds  to  1
              pixel per point, which is equivalent to a standard 72 dpi monitor.  A scaling factor of 1.25 would
              mean  1.25 pixels per point, which is the setting for a 90 dpi monitor; setting the scaling factor
              to 1.25 on a 72 dpi monitor would cause everything in the application to be displayed  1.25  times
              as  large as normal.  The initial value for the scaling factor is set when the application starts,
              based on properties of the installed monitor, but it can be changed  at  any  time.   Measurements
              made  after  the  scaling  factor  is changed will use the new scaling factor, but it is undefined
              whether existing widgets will resize themselves dynamically to accommodate the new scaling factor.

       <b>tk</b> <b>sysnotify</b>  <u>title</u>? <u>message</u>?
              The <b>tk</b> <b>sysnotify</b>  command creates a platform-specific system notification alert. Its intent is  to
              provide  a brief, unobtrusive notification to the user by popping up a window that briefly appears
              in a corner of the screen. For more details see the <b>sysnotify</b> manual page.

       <b>tk</b> <b>systray</b> <b>create</b> <u>subcommand...</u>
              The <b>tk</b> <b>systray</b> command creates an icon in the platform-specific tray. For  more  details  see  the
              <b>systray</b> manual page.

       <b>tk</b> <b>useinputmethods</b> ?<b>-displayof</b> <u>window</u>? ?<u>boolean</u>?
              Sets  and  queries  the state of whether Tk should use XIM (X Input Methods) for filtering events.
              The resulting state is returned.  XIM is used in some locales (i.e., Japanese, Korean), to  handle
              special  input  devices.  This feature is only significant on X.  If XIM support is not available,
              this will always return 0.  If the <u>window</u> argument is omitted, it defaults to the main window.  If
              the <u>boolean</u> argument is omitted, the current state is returned.  This is turned on by default  for
              the main display.

       <b>tk</b> <b>windowingsystem</b>
              Returns  the  current  Tk  windowing  system,  one of <b>x11</b> (X11-based), <b>win32</b> (MS Windows), or <b>aqua</b>
              (macOS Aqua).
