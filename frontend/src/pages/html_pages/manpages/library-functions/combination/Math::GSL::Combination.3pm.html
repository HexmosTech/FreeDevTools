       Math::GSL::Combination - Combinations

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Math::GSL qw/:all/;
           use Math::GSL::Combination qw/:all/;

           my $c   = Math::GSL::Combination-&gt;new(6,3);
           print join (" ", $c-&gt;as_list) . "\n";
           $c-&gt;next;
           print join (" ", $c-&gt;as_list) . "\n";

           my $fd = gsl_fopen('combination.dat', 'w');
           gsl_combination_fwrite($fd, $c-&gt;raw);
           gsl_fclose($fd);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Here is a list of all the functions in this module :

       •   "gsl_combination_alloc($n, $k)"

           This  function allocates memory for a new combination with parameters $n, $k.  The combination is not
           initialized and its elements are undefined. Use the function gsl_combination_calloc if  you  want  to
           create a combination which is initialized to the lexicographically first combination.

       •   "gsl_combination_calloc($n, $k)"

           This function allocates memory for a new combination with parameters $n, $k and initializes it to the
           lexicographically first combination.

       •   gsl_combination_init_first($c)

           This  function  initializes  the  combination  $c  to  the  lexicographically first combination, i.e.
           (0,1,2,...,k-1).

       •   gsl_combination_init_last($c)

           This function initializes  the  combination  $c  to  the  lexicographically  last  combination,  i.e.
           (n-k,n-k+1,...,n-1).

       •   gsl_combination_free($c)

           This function frees all the memory used by the combination $c.

       •   "gsl_combination_memcpy($dest, $src)"

           This  function  copies  the  elements  of  the  combination  $src into the combination $dest. The two
           combinations must have the same size.

       •   "gsl_combination_get($c, $i)"

           This function returns the value of the i-th element of the combination $c. If  $i  lies  outside  the
           allowed range of 0 to k-1 then the error handler is invoked and 0 is returned.

       •   "gsl_combination_fwrite($stream, $c)"

           This  function  writes  the  elements  of  the  combination $c to the stream $stream, opened with the
           gsl_fopen function from the Math::GSL module, in binary format.  The function returns $GSL_EFAILED if
           there was a problem writing to the file.  Since the data is written in the native  binary  format  it
           may not be portable between different architectures.

       •   "gsl_combination_fread($stream, $c)"

           This  function  reads  elements from the open stream $stream, opened with the gsl_fopen function from
           the Math::GSL module, into  the  combination  $c  in  binary  format.  The  combination  $c  must  be
           preallocated  with  correct values of n and k since the function uses the size of $c to determine how
           many bytes to read. The function returns $GSL_EFAILED if there was a problem reading from  the  file.
           The data is assumed to have been written in the native binary format on the same architecture.

       •   "gsl_combination_fprintf($stream, $c, $format)"

           This  function  writes  the elements of the combination $c line-by-line to the stream $stream, opened
           with the gsl_fopen function from the Math::GSL module, using  the  format  specifier  $format,  which
           should be suitable for a type of size_t. In ISO C99 the type modifier z represents size_t, so "%zu\n"
           is a suitable format. The function returns $GSL_EFAILED if there was a problem writing to the file.

       •   "gsl_combination_fscanf($stream, $c)"

           This  function  reads formatted data from the stream $stream into the combination $c. The combination
           $c must be preallocated with correct values of n and k since the function uses  the  size  of  $c  to
           determine how many numbers to read.  The function returns $GSL_EFAILED if there was a problem reading
           from the file.

       •   gsl_combination_n($c)

           This function returns the range (n) of the combination $c.

       •   gsl_combination_k($c)

           This function returns the number of elements (k) in the combination $c.

       •   gsl_combination_data($c)

           This function returns a pointer to the array of elements in the combination $c.

       •   gsl_combination_valid($c)

           This  function  checks  that the combination $c is valid. The k elements should lie in the range 0 to
           n-1, with each value occurring once at most and in increasing order.

       •   gsl_combination_next($c)

           This function advances the combination $c to the next combination in lexicographic order and  returns
           $GSL_SUCCESS.  If  no  further  combinations  are  available  it  returns  $GSL_FAILURE and leaves $c
           unmodified. Starting with the first combination and repeatedly applying this  function  will  iterate
           through all possible combinations of a given order.

       •   gsl_combination_prev($c)

           This  function  steps  backwards from the combination $c to the previous combination in lexicographic
           order, returning $GSL_SUCCESS. If no previous combination is available it  returns  $GSL_FAILURE  and
           leaves $c unmodified.
