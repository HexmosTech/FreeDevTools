</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       curl_global_trace - log configuration

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;curl/curl.h&gt;

       CURLcode curl_global_trace(const char *config);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  function  configures  the  logging  behavior to make some parts of curl more verbose or silent than
       others.

       This function may be called during the initialization phase of a program. It does not have to be. It  can
       be called several times even, possibly overwriting settings of previous calls.

       Calling  this function after transfers have been started is undefined. On some platforms/architectures it
       might take effect, on others not.

       This function is thread-safe since libcurl 8.3.0 if <u><a href="../man3/curl_version_info.3.html">curl_version_info</a>(3)</u> has the  CURL_VERSION_THREADSAFE
       feature bit set (most platforms).

       If  this is not thread-safe, you must not call this function when any other thread in the program (i.e. a
       thread sharing the same memory) is running. This does not  just  mean  no  other  thread  that  is  using
       libcurl.  Because  <u><a href="../man3/curl_global_init.3.html">curl_global_init</a>(3)</u>  may  call  functions of other libraries that are similarly thread
       unsafe, it could conflict with any other thread that uses these other libraries.

       If you are initializing libcurl from a Windows DLL you should not initialize it from <u>DllMain</u> or a  static
       initializer because Windows holds the loader lock during that time and it could cause a deadlock.

       The  <u>config</u>  string  is a list of comma-separated component names. Names are case-insensitive and unknown
       names are ignored. The special name "all" applies to all components. Names may be prefixed  with  '+'  or
       '-' to enable or disable detailed logging for a component.

       The  list  of component names is not part of curl's public API. Names may be added or disappear in future
       versions of libcurl. Since unknown names are silently ignored, outdated log configurations does not cause
       errors when upgrading libcurl. Given that, some names can be expected to be fairly stable and are  listed
       below for easy reference.

       Note   that   log   configuration  applies  only  to  transfers  where  debug  logging  is  enabled.  See
       <u><a href="../man3/CURLOPT_VERBOSE.3.html">CURLOPT_VERBOSE</a>(3)</u> or <u><a href="../man3/CURLOPT_DEBUGFUNCTION.3.html">CURLOPT_DEBUGFUNCTION</a>(3)</u> on how to control that.

</pre><h4><b>TRACE</b> <b>COMPONENTS</b></h4><pre>
       tcp    Tracing of TCP socket handling: connect, sends, receives.

       ssl    Tracing of SSL/TLS operations, whichever SSL backend is used in your build.

       ftp    Tracing of FTP operations when this protocol is enabled in your build.

       http/2 Details about HTTP/2 handling: frames, events, I/O, etc.

       http/3 Details about HTTP/3 handling: connect, frames, events, I/O etc.

       http-proxy
              Involved when transfers are tunneled through an HTTP proxy.  "h1-proxy"  or  "h2-proxy"  are  also
              involved, depending on the HTTP version negotiated with the proxy.

              In  order to find out all components involved in a transfer, run it with "all" configured. You can
              then see all names involved in your libcurl version in the trace.

       dns    Tracing of DNS operations to resolve hostnames and HTTPS records.

       lib-ids
              Adds transfer and connection identifiers as prefix to every call to <u><a href="../man3/CURLOPT_DEBUGFUNCTION.3.html">CURLOPT_DEBUGFUNCTION</a>(3)</u>.  The
              format  is  <u>[n-m]</u>  where  <u>n</u>  is  the  identifier  of  the  transfer and <u>m</u> is the identifier of the
              connection. A literal <u>x</u> is used for internal transfers or when no connection is assigned.

              For example, <u>[5-x]</u> is the prefix for transfer 5 that has no  connection.  The  command  line  tool
              <u>curl</u>uses the same format for its <u>--trace-ids</u> option.

              <u>lib-ids</u> is intended for libcurl applications that handle multiple transfers but have no own way to
              identify in trace output which transfer a trace event is connected to.

       doh    Former name for DNS-over-HTTP operations. Now an alias for <u>dns</u>.

       multi  Traces multi operations managing transfers' state changes and sockets poll states.

       read   Traces reading of upload data from the application in order to send it to the server.

       ssls   Tracing of SSL Session handling, e.g. caching/import/export.

       smtp   Tracing of SMTP operations when this protocol is enabled in your build.

       write  Traces writing of download data, received from the server, to the application.

       ws     Tracing of WebSocket operations when this protocol is enabled in your build.

</pre><h4><b>TRACE</b> <b>GROUPS</b></h4><pre>
       Besides the specific component names there are the following group names defined:

       all

       network
              All components involved in bare network I/O, including the SSL layer.

              All components that your libcurl is built with.

       protocol
              All components involved in transfer protocols, such as 'ftp' and 'http/2'.

       proxy  All components involved in use of proxies.

</pre><h4><b>PROTOCOLS</b></h4><pre>
       This functionality affects all supported protocols

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       int main(void)
       {
         /* log details of HTTP/2 and SSL handling */
         curl_global_trace("http/2,ssl");

         /* log all details, except SSL handling */
         curl_global_trace("all,-ssl");
       }

       Below  is  a trace sample where "http/2" was configured. The trace output of an enabled component appears
       at the beginning in brackets.
       * [HTTP/2] [h2sid=1] cf_send(len=96) submit https://example.com/
       ...
       * [HTTP/2] [h2sid=1] FRAME[HEADERS]
       * [HTTP/2] [h2sid=1] 249 header bytes
       ...

</pre><h4><b>AVAILABILITY</b></h4><pre>
       Added in curl 8.3.0

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       If this function returns non-zero, something went wrong and the configuration may not have any effects or
       may only been applied partially.
