</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       XMLTV::Configure - Configuration file handling for XMLTV grabbers

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Utility library that helps grabbers read from configuration files and implement a configuration method
       that can be run from the command-line.

</pre><h4><b>EXPORTED</b> <b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       All these functions are exported on demand.

       LoadConfig
           Takes the name of the configuration file to load as a parameter.

           Returns  a  hashref  with  configuration  fieldnames  as  keys.  Note that the values of the hash are
           references to an array of values.

           Example:
             {
               username =&gt; [ 'mattias' ],
               password =&gt; [ 'xxx' ],
               channel =&gt; [ 'svt1.svt.se', 'kanal5.se' ],
               no_channel =&gt; ['svt2.svt.se' ],
             }

           Note that unselected options from a selectmany are collected in an entry named after the key  with  a
           prefix  of  'no_'.  See  the  channel  and  no_channel entry in the example. They are the result of a
           selectmany with id=channel.

           The configuration file must be in the format described in the file "ConfigurationFiles.txt".  If  the
           file does not exist or if the format is wrong, LoadConfig returns undef.

       SaveConfig
           Write  a  configuration  hash  in the format returned by LoadConfig to a file that can be loaded with
           LoadConfig. Takes two parameters, a reference to a configuration hash and a filename.

           Note that a grabber should normally never have to call SaveConfig. This is  done  by  the  Configure-
           method.

       Configure
           Generates a configuration file for the grabber.

           Takes three parameters: stagesub, listsub and the name of the configuration file.

           stagesub  shall  be  a  coderef  that  takes  a  stage-name or undef and a configuration hashref as a
           parameter and returns an xml-string that describes the configuration necessary for that  stage.   The
           xml-string shall follow the xmltv-configuration.dtd.

           listsub  shall  be  a  coderef that takes a configuration hash as returned by LoadConfig as the first
           parameter and an option hash as returned by ParseOptions as the second parameter and returns an  xml-
           string containing a list of all the channels that the grabber can deliver data for using the supplied
           configuration. Note that the listsub shall not use any channel-configuration from the hashref.
