       Config::JSON - A JSON based config file system.

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 1.5202

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        use Config::JSON;

        my $config = Config::JSON-&gt;create($pathToFile);
        my $config = Config::JSON-&gt;new($pathToFile);
        my $config = Config::JSON-&gt;new(pathToFile=&gt;$pathToFile);

        my $element = $config-&gt;get($directive);

        $config-&gt;set($directive,$value);

        $config-&gt;delete($directive);
        $config-&gt;deleteFromHash($directive, $key);
        $config-&gt;deleteFromArray($directive, $value);

        $config-&gt;addToHash($directive, $key, $value);
        $config-&gt;addToArray($directive, $value);

        my $path = $config-&gt;pathToFile;
        my $filename = $config-&gt;getFilename;

   <b>Example</b> <b>Config</b> <b>File</b>
        # config-file-type: JSON 1
        {
           "dsn" : "DBI:mysql:test",
           "user" : "tester",
           "password" : "xxxxxx",

           # some colors to choose from
           "colors" : [ "red", "green", "blue" ],

           # some statistics
           "stats" : {
                   "health" : 32,
                   "vitality" : 11
           },

           # including another file
           "includes" : ["macros.conf"]
        }

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This package parses the config files written in JSON. It also does some non-JSON stuff, like allowing for
       comments in the files.

       If you want to see it in action, it is used as the config file system in WebGUI &lt;<a href="http://www.webgui.org/">http://www.webgui.org/</a>&gt;.

   <b>Why?</b>
       Why build yet another config file system? Well there are a number of reasons: We used to use other config
       file parsers, but we kept running into limitations. We already use JSON in our app, so using JSON to
       store config files means using less memory because we already have the JSON parser in memory. In
       addition, with JSON we can have any number of hierarchcal data structures represented in the config file,
       whereas most config files will give you only one level of hierarchy, if any at all. JSON parses faster
       than XML and YAML.  JSON is easier to read and edit than XML. Many other config file systems allow you to
       read a config file, but they don't provide any mechanism or utilities to write back to it. JSON is taint
       safe.  JSON is easily parsed by languages other than Perl when we need to do that.

   <b>Multi-level</b> <b>Directives</b>
       You may of course access a directive called "foo", but since the config is basically a hash you can
       traverse multiple elements of the hash when specifying a directive name by simply delimiting each level
       with a slash, like "foo/bar". For example you may:

        my $vitality = $config-&gt;get("stats/vitality");
        $config-&gt;set("stats/vitality", 15);

       You may do this wherever you specify a directive name.

   <b>Comments</b>
       You can put comments in the config file as long as # is the first non-space character on the line.
       However, if you use this API to write to the config file, your comments will be eliminated.

   <b>Includes</b>
       There is a special directive called "includes", which is an array of include files that may be brought in
       to the config. Even the files you include can have an "includes" directive, so you can do hierarchical
       includes.

       Any directive in the main file will take precedence over the directives in the includes. Likewise the
       files listed first in the "includes" directive will have precedence over the files that come after it.
       When writing to the files, the same precedence is followed.

       If you're setting a new directive that doesn't currently exist, it will only be written to the main file.

       If a directive is deleted, it will be deleted from all files, including the includes.

</pre><h4><b>INTERFACE</b></h4><pre>
   <b>addToArray</b> <b>(</b> <b>directive,</b> <b>value</b> <b>)</b>

       <u>insertBefore</u>

   <b>addToArrayAfter</b> <b>(</b> <b>directive,</b> <b>insertAfter,</b> <b>value</b> <b>)</b>
       Inserts a value into an array immediately after another item.  If that item can't be found, inserts at

       The value to insert.

   <b>addToHash</b> <b>(</b> <b>directive,</b> <b>key,</b> <b>value</b> <b>)</b>
       Adds a value to a hash directive in the config file. <b>NOTE:</b> This is really the same as
       $config-&gt;set("directive/key", $value);

       <u>directive</u>

       The name of the hash.

       <u>key</u>

       The key to add.

   <b>create</b> <b>(</b> <b>pathToFile</b> <b>)</b>

       <u>pathToFile</u>

       The path and filename of the file to create.

   <b>delete</b> <b>(</b> <b>directive</b> <b>)</b>
       Deletes a key from the config file.

       <u>directive</u>

       The name of the directive to delete.

   <b>deleteFromArray</b> <b>(</b> <b>directive,</b> <b>value</b> <b>)</b>
       Deletes a value from an array directive in the config file.

       <u>directive</u>

       The name of the array.

       <u>value</u>

       The value to delete.

   <b>deleteFromHash</b> <b>(</b> <b>directive,</b> <b>key</b> <b>)</b>
       Delete a key from a hash directive in the config file. <b>NOTE:</b> This is really just the same as doing
       $config-&gt;delete("directive/key");

       <u>directive</u>

       The name of the hash.

       <u>key</u>

       The key to delete.

   <b>get</b> <b>(</b> <b>directive</b> <b>)</b>
       Returns the value of a particular directive from the config file.

       <u>directive</u>

       The name of the directive to return.

   <b>getFilename</b> <b>(</b> <b>)</b>
       Returns the filename for this config.

   <b>pathToFile</b> <b>(</b> <b>)</b>
       Returns the filename and path for this config. May also be called as "getFilePath" for backward
       campatibility sake.

   <b>includes</b> <b>(</b> <b>)</b>
       Returns an array reference of Config::JSON objects that are files included by this config. May also be
       called as "getIncludes" for backward compatibility sake.

   <b>new</b> <b>(</b> <b>pathToFile</b> <b>)</b>
       Constructor. Builds an object around a config file.

       <u>pathToFile</u>

       A string representing a path such as "/etc/my-cool-config.conf".

   <b>set</b> <b>(</b> <b>directive,</b> <b>value</b> <b>)</b>
       Creates a new or updates an existing directive in the config file.

       <u>directive</u>

       A directive name.

       <u>value</u>

       The value to set the paraemter to. Can be a scalar, hash reference, or array reference.

   <b>splitKeyParts</b> <b>(</b> <b>key</b> <b>)</b>
       Returns an array of key parts.

       <u>key</u>

       A key string. Could be 'foo' (simple key), 'foo/bar' (a multilevel key referring to the bar key as a
       child of foo), or 'foo\/bar' (a simple key that contains a slash in the key). Don't forget to double
       escape in your perl code if you have a slash in your key parts like this:

        $config-&gt;get('foo\\/bar');

   <b>write</b> <b>(</b> <b>)</b>
       Writes the file to the filesystem. Normally you'd never need to call this as it's called automatically by
       the other methods when a change occurs.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       "Couldn't parse JSON in config file"
           This  means  that  the  config  file  does not appear to be formatted properly as a JSON file. Common
           mistakes are missing commas or trailing commas on the end of a list.

       "Cannot read config file"
           We couldn't read the config file. This usually means that the path specified in  the  constructor  is
           incorrect.

       "Can't write to config file"
           We  couldn't  write  to the config file. This usually means that the file system is full, or the that
           the file is write protected.
