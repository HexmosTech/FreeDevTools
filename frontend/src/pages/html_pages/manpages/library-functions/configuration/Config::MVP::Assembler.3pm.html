</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Config::MVP::Assembler - multivalue-property config-loading state machine

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 2.200013

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       First, you should probably read the example of using Config::MVP.  If you already know how it works, keep
       going.

       Config::MVP::Assembler is a helper for constructing a Config::MVP::Sequence object.  It's a very simple
       state machine that lets you signal what kind of events you've encountered while reading configuration.

</pre><h4><b>PERL</b> <b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This module should work on any version of perl still receiving updates from the Perl 5 Porters.  This
       means it should work on any version of perl released in the last two to three years.  (That is, if the
       most recently released version is v5.40, then this module should work on both v5.40 and v5.38.)

       Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made that the minimum required version
       will not be increased.  The version may be increased for any reason, and there is no promise that patches
       will be accepted to lower the minimum required perl.

</pre><h4><b>ATTRIBUTES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>sequence_class</b>
       This attribute stores the name of the class to be used for the assembler's sequence.  It defaults to
       Config::MVP::Sequence.

   <b>section_class</b>
       This attribute stores the name of the class to be used for sections created by the assembler.  It
       defaults to Config::MVP::Section.

   <b>sequence</b>
       This is the sequence that the assembler is assembling.  It defaults to a new instance of the assembler's
       "sequence_class".

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>begin_section</b>
         $assembler-&gt;begin_section($package_moniker, $name);

         $assembler-&gt;begin_section($package_moniker);

         $assembler-&gt;begin_section( \$package );

       This method tells the assembler that it should begin work on a new section with the given identifier.  If
       it is already working on a section, an error will be raised.  See "change_section" for a method to begin
       a new section, ending the current one if needed.

       The package moniker is expanded by the "expand_package" method.  The name, if not given, defaults to the
       package moniker.  These data are used to create a new section and the section is added to the end of the
       sequence.  If the package argument is a reference, it is used as the literal value for the package, and
       no expansion is performed.  If it is a reference to undef, a section with no package is created.

   <b>end_section</b>
         $assembler-&gt;end_section;

       This ends the current section.  If there is no current section, an exception is raised.

   <b>change_section</b>
         $assembler-&gt;change_section($package_moniker, $name);

         $assembler-&gt;change_section($package_moniker);

       This method calls "begin_section", first calling "end_section" if needed.

   <b>add_value</b>
         $assembler-&gt;add_value( $name =&gt; $value );

       This method tells the assembler that it has encountered a named value and should add it to the current
       section.  If there is no current section, an exception is raised.  (If this is not the first time we've
       seen the name in the section and it's not a multivalue property, the section class will raise an
       exception on its own.)

   <b>expand_package</b>
       This method is passed a short identifier for a package and is expected to return the full name of the
       module to load and package to interrogate.  By default it simply returns the name it was passed, meaning
       that package names must be given whole to the "change_section" method.

   <b>current_section</b>
       This returns the section object onto which the assembler is currently adding values.  If no section has
       yet been created, this method will return false.

</pre><h4><b>TYPICAL</b> <b>USE</b></h4><pre>
         my $assembler = Config::MVP::Assembler-&gt;new;

         # Maybe you want a starting section:
         my $starting_section = $assembler-&gt;section_class-&gt;new({ name =&gt; '_' });
         $assembler-&gt;sequence-&gt;add_section($section_starting);

         # We'll add some values, which will go to the starting section:
         $assembler-&gt;add_value(x =&gt; 10);
         $assembler-&gt;add_value(y =&gt; 20);

         # Change to a new section...
         $assembler-&gt;change_section($moniker);

         # ...and add values to that section.
         $assembler-&gt;add_value(x =&gt; 100);
         $assembler-&gt;add_value(y =&gt; 200);

       The code above creates an assembler and populates it step by step.  In the end, to get values, you could
       do something like this:

         my @output;

         for my $section ($assembler-&gt;sequence-&gt;sections) {
           push @output, [ $section-&gt;name, $section-&gt;package, $section-&gt;payload ];
         }

       When changing sections, the given section "moniker" is used for the new section name.  The result of
       passing that moniker to the assembler's "expand_package" method is used as the section's package name.
       (By default, this method does nothing.)  The new section's "multivalue_args" and "aliases" are determined
       by calling the "mvp_multivalue_args" and "mvp_aliases" methods on the package.
