</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Config::MVP::Reader - object to read config from storage into an assembler

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 2.200013

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Config::MVP::Reader::YAML; # this doesn't really exist

         my $reader   = Config::MVP::Reader::YAML-&gt;new;

         my $sequence = $reader-&gt;read_config('/etc/foobar.yml');

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       A Config::MVP::Reader exists to read configuration data from storage (like a file) and convert that data
       into instructions to a Config::MVP::Assembler, which will in turn convert them into a
       Config::MVP::Sequence, the final product.

</pre><h4><b>PERL</b> <b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This module should work on any version of perl still receiving updates from the Perl 5 Porters.  This
       means it should work on any version of perl released in the last two to three years.  (That is, if the
       most recently released version is v5.40, then this module should work on both v5.40 and v5.38.)

       Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made that the minimum required version
       will not be increased.  The version may be increased for any reason, and there is no promise that patches
       will be accepted to lower the minimum required perl.

</pre><h4><b>ATTRIBUTES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>add_cwd_to_lib</b>
       If true (which it is by default) then the current working directly will be locally added to @INC during
       config loading.  This helps deal with changes made in Perl v5.26.1.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>read_config</b>
         my $sequence = $reader-&gt;read_config($location, \%arg);

       This method is passed a location, which has no set meaning, but should be the mechanism by which the
       Reader is told how to locate configuration.  It might be a file name, a hashref of parameters, a DBH, or
       anything else, depending on the needs of the specific Reader subclass.

       It is also passed a hashref of arguments, of which there is only one valid argument:

        assembler - the Assembler object into which to read the config

       If no assembler argument is passed, one will be constructed by calling the Reader's "build_assembler"
       method.

       Subclasses should generally not override "read_config", but should instead implement a
       "read_into_assembler" method, described below.  If a subclass <u>does</u> override "read_config" it should take
       care to respect the "add_cwd_to_lib" attribute, above.

   <b>read_into_assembler</b>
       This method should not be called directly.  It is called by "read_config" with the following parameters:

         my $sequence = $reader-&gt;read_into_assembler( $location, $assembler );

       The method should read the configuration found at $location and use it to instruct the $assembler (a
       Config::MVP::Assembler) what configuration to perform.

       The default implementation of this method will throw an exception complaining that it should have been
       implemented by a subclass.

   <b>build_assembler</b>
       If no Assembler is provided to "read_config"'s "assembler" parameter, this method will be called on the
       Reader to construct one.

       It must return a Config::MVP::Assembler object, and by default will return an entirely generic one.
