</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module lets you define attributes which can come from a configuration file. It also adds a role to
       your class which allows you to write a configuration file.

       It is based on using a simple INI-style configuration file, which contains sections and keys:

         key1 = value
         key2 = 42

         [section]
         key3 = 2

</pre><h4><b>ATTRIBUTE</b> <b>API</b></h4><pre>
       Simply using this module in your class changes your class's attribute metaclass to add support for
       defining attributes as configuration items.

       There are two new parameters you can pass when defining an attribute, "section" and "key". These tell the
       module how to find the attribute's value in the configuration file. The "section" parameter is optional.
       If you don't set it, but <u>do</u> provide a key, then the section defaults to "_", which is the main section of
       the config file.

       If you pass a "section" you must also pass a "key".

       Defining an attribute as a configuration item has several effects. First, it changes the default value
       for the attribute. Before looking at a "default" or "builder" you define, the attribute will first look
       in the config file for a corresponding value. If one exists, it will use that, otherwise it will fall
       back to using a default you supply.

       If you do supply a default, it must be a string (or number), not a reference or undefined value.

       All configuration attributes are lazy. This is necessary because the configuration file needs to be
       loaded and parsed before looking up values.

       The "documentation" string is used when generating a configuration file. See below for details.

</pre><h4><b>CLASS</b> <b>API</b></h4><pre>
       Your config class will do the MooseX::Configuration::Trait::Object role. This adds several attributes and
       methods to your class.

   <b>config_file</b> <b>attribute</b>
       The "config_file" attribute defines the location of the configuration file. The role supplies a builder
       method that you can replace, "_build_config_file". It should return a string or Path::Class::File object
       pointing to the configuration file. It can also return "undef".

       If you <u>don't</u> provide your own builder, then the "config_file" will default to "undef".

   <b>$config-&gt;_raw_config()</b>
       This returns the raw hash reference as read by Config::INI::Reader. If no config file was defined, then
       this simply returns an empty hash reference.

   <b>$config-&gt;write_config_file(</b> <b>...</b> <b>)</b>
       This method can be used to write a configuration file. It accepts several parameters:

       •   file

           This can be either a path or an open filehandle. The configuration text will be written to this file.
           This  defaults  to  the value of "$self-&gt;config_file()". If no file is provided or already set in the
           object, this method will die.

       •   generated_by

           If this parameter is passed, it will be included as a comment at the top of the generated file.

       •   values

           This should be a hash reference of attribute names and values to write to  the  config  file.  It  is
           optional.

       When  writing  the  configuration  file,  any  configuration  item that was set in the configuration file
       originally will be set in the new file, as will any value passed in the "values" key. An attribute  value
       set in the constructor or by a default will <u>not</u> be included in the generated file.

       Keys without a value will still be included in the file as a comment.

       If  an  attribute includes a documentation string, that string will appear as a comment above the key. If
       the attribute defines a simple scalar default, that will also be included  in  the  comment,  unless  the
       default  is  the  empty  string.  Finally,  if  the  attribute is required, that is also mentioned in the
       comment.

</pre><h4><b>DONATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       If you'd like to thank me for the work I've done on this module, please consider making a  "donation"  to
       me  via PayPal. I spend a lot of free time creating free software, and would appreciate any support you'd
       care to offer.

       Please note that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> in order for me to continue  working  on  this
       particular  software.  I  will  continue  to  do  so,  inasmuch  as I have in the past, for as long as it
       interests me.

       Similarly, a donation made in this way will probably not make me work on this software much more,  unless
       I  get  so many donations that I can consider working on free software full time, which seems unlikely at
       best.

       To donate, log into PayPal  and  send  money  to  <a href="mailto:autarch@urth.org">autarch@urth.org</a>  or  use  the  button  on  this  page:

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Please  report any bugs or feature requests to "<a href="mailto:bug-moosex-configuration@rt.cpan.org">bug-moosex-configuration@rt.cpan.org</a>", or through the web
       interface at &lt;<a href="http://rt.cpan.org">http://rt.cpan.org</a>&gt;.  I will be notified, and then  you'll  automatically  be  notified  of
       progress on your bug as I make changes.
