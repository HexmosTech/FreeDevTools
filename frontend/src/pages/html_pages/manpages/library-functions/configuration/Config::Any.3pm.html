       Config::Any - Load configuration from different file formats, transparently

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Config::Any;

           my $cfg = Config::Any-&gt;load_stems({stems =&gt; \@filepath_stems, ... });
           # or
           my $cfg = Config::Any-&gt;load_files({files =&gt; \@filepaths, ... });

           for (@$cfg) {
               my ($filename, $config) = %$_;
               $class-&gt;config($config);
               warn "loaded config from file: $filename";
           }

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Config::Any provides a facility for Perl applications and libraries to load configuration data from
       multiple different file formats. It supports XML, YAML, JSON, Apache-style configuration, Windows INI
       files, and even Perl code.

       The rationale for this module is as follows: Perl programs are deployed on many different platforms and
       integrated with many different systems. Systems administrators and end users may prefer different
       configuration formats than the developers. The flexibility inherent in a multiple format configuration
       loader allows different users to make different choices, without generating extra work for the
       developers. As a developer you only need to learn a single interface to be able to use the power of
       different configuration formats.

</pre><h4><b>INTERFACE</b></h4><pre>
   <b>load_files(</b> <b>\%args</b> <b>)</b>
           Config::Any-&gt;load_files( { files =&gt; \@files } );
           Config::Any-&gt;load_files( { files =&gt; \@files, filter  =&gt; \&amp;filter } );
           Config::Any-&gt;load_files( { files =&gt; \@files, use_ext =&gt; 1 } );
           Config::Any-&gt;load_files( { files =&gt; \@files, flatten_to_hash =&gt; 1 } );

       "load_files()" attempts to load configuration from the list of files passed in the "files" parameter, if
       the file exists.

       If the "filter" parameter is set, it is used as a callback to modify the configuration data before it is
       returned. It will be passed a single hash-reference parameter which it should modify in-place.

       If the "use_ext" parameter is defined, the loader will attempt to parse the file extension from each
       filename and will skip the file unless it matches a standard extension for the loading plugins. Only
       plugins whose standard extensions match the file extension will be used. For efficiency reasons, its use
       is encouraged, but be aware that you will lose flexibility -- for example, a file called "myapp.cfg"
       containing YAML data will not be offered to the YAML plugin, whereas "myapp.yml" or "myapp.yaml" would
       be.

       When the "flatten_to_hash" parameter is defined, the loader will return a hash keyed on the file names,
       as opposed to the usual list of single-key hashes.

       "load_files()" also supports a 'force_plugins' parameter, whose value should be an arrayref of plugin
       names like "Config::Any::INI". Its intended use is to allow the use of a non-standard file extension
       while forcing it to be offered to a particular parser.  It is not compatible with 'use_ext'.

       You can supply a "driver_args" hashref to pass special options to a particular parser object. Example:

           Config::Any-&gt;load_files( { files =&gt; \@files, driver_args =&gt; {
               General =&gt; { -LowerCaseNames =&gt; 1 }
           } )

   <b>load_stems(</b> <b>\%args</b> <b>)</b>
           Config::Any-&gt;load_stems( { stems =&gt; \@stems } );
           Config::Any-&gt;load_stems( { stems =&gt; \@stems, filter  =&gt; \&amp;filter } );
           Config::Any-&gt;load_stems( { stems =&gt; \@stems, use_ext =&gt; 1 } );
           Config::Any-&gt;load_stems( { stems =&gt; \@stems, flatten_to_hash =&gt; 1 } );

       "load_stems()" attempts to load configuration from a list of files which it generates by combining the
       filename stems list passed in the "stems" parameter with the potential filename extensions from each
       loader, which you can check with the "extensions()" classmethod described below. Once this list of
       possible filenames is built it is treated exactly as in "load_files()" above, as which it takes the same
       parameters. Please read the "load_files()" documentation before using this method.

   <b>finder(</b> <b>)</b>
       The "finder()" classmethod returns the Module::Pluggable::Object object which is used to load the
       plugins. See the documentation for that module for more information.

   <b>plugins(</b> <b>)</b>
       The "plugins()" classmethod returns the names of configuration loading plugins as found by
       Module::Pluggable::Object.

   <b>extensions(</b> <b>)</b>
       The "extensions()" classmethod returns the possible file extensions which can be loaded by "load_stems()"
       and "load_files()". This may be useful if you set the "use_ext" parameter to those methods.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       "No files specified!" or "No stems specified!"
           The "load_files()" and "load_stems()" methods will issue this warning if called with an empty list of
           files/stems to load.

       "_load requires a arrayref of file paths"
           This  fatal error will be thrown by the internal "_load" method. It should not occur but is specified
           here for completeness. If your code dies with this error, please email a failing  test  case  to  the
           authors below.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>AND</b> <b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       Config::Any requires no configuration files or environment variables.

</pre><h4><b>DEPENDENCIES</b></h4><pre>
       Module::Pluggable::Object

       And at least one of the following for each file type to be supported:

       •   For ".cnf", ".conf" files: Config::General

       •   For ".ini" files: Config::Tiny

       •   For  ".json",  ".jsn"  files:  Cpanel::JSON::XS,  JSON::MaybeXS,  JSON::DWIW,  JSON::XS,  JSON::Syck,
           JSON::PP, JSON

       •   For ".pl", ".perl" files: no additional requirements

       •   For ".xml" files: XML::Simple

       •   For ".yml", ".yaml" files: YAML::XS, YAML::Syck, YAML

       Additionally, other file types are supported by third-party plugins  in  the  "Config::Any::"  namespace,
       installed separately.
