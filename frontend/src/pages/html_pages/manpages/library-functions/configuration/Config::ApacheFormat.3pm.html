</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Config::ApacheFormat - use Apache format config files

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       Config files used with this module are in Apache's format:

         # comment here
         RootDir /path/foo
         LogDir  /path/foo/log
         Colors red green orange blue \
                black teal

         &lt;Directory /path/foo&gt;
            # override Colors inside block
            Colors red blue black
         &lt;/Directory&gt;

       Code to use this config file might look like:

         use Config::ApacheFormat;

         # load a conf file
         my $config = Config::ApacheFormat-&gt;new();
         $config-&gt;read("my.conf");

         # access some parameters
         $root_dir = $config-&gt;get("RootDir");
         $log_dir  = $config-&gt;get("LogDir");
         @colors   = $config-&gt;get("colors");

         # using the autoloaded methods
         $config-&gt;<a href="../man1/autoload_support.1.html">autoload_support</a>(1);
         $root_dir = $config-&gt;RootDir;
         $log_dir  = $config-&gt;logdir;

         # access parameters inside a block
         my $block = $config-&gt;block(Directory =&gt; "/path/foo");
         @colors = $block-&gt;get("colors");
         $root_dir = $block-&gt;get("root_dir");

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module is designed to parse a configuration file in the same syntax used by the Apache web server
       (see <a href="http://httpd.apache.org">http://httpd.apache.org</a> for details).  This allows you to build applications which can be easily
       managed by experienced Apache admins.  Also, by using this module, you'll benefit from the support for
       nested blocks with built-in parameter inheritance.  This can greatly reduce the amount or repeated
       information in your configuration files.

       A good reference to the Apache configuration file format can be found here:

         <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/configuring.html">http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/configuring.html</a>

       To quote from that document, concerning directive syntax:

        Apache configuration files contain one directive per line. The
        back-slash "\" may be used as the last character on a line to
        indicate that the directive continues onto the next line. There must
        be no other characters or white space between the back-slash and the
        end of the line.

        Directives in the configuration files are case-insensitive, but
        arguments to directives are often case sensitive. Lines that begin
        with the hash character "#" are considered comments, and are
        ignored. Comments may not be included on a line after a configuration
        directive. Blank lines and white space occurring before a directive
        are ignored, so you may indent directives for clarity.

       And block notation:

        Directives placed in the main configuration files apply to the entire
        server. If you wish to change the configuration for only a part of the
        server, you can scope your directives by placing them in &lt;Directory&gt;,
        &lt;DirectoryMatch&gt;, &lt;Files&gt;, &lt;FilesMatch&gt;, &lt;Location&gt;, and
        &lt;LocationMatch&gt; sections. These sections limit the application of the
        directives which they enclose to particular filesystem locations or
        URLs. They can also be nested, allowing for very fine grained
        configuration.

       This module will parse actual Apache configuration files, but you will need to set some options to non-
       default values.  See "Parsing a Real Apache Config File".

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       $config = Config::ApacheFormat-&gt;new(opt =&gt; "value")
           This method creates an object that can then be used to read configuration files. It does not actually
           read  any  files;  for  that,  use  the  "read()"  method  below.  The  object supports the following
           attributes, all of which may be set through "new()":

           inheritance_support
               Set this to 0 to turn off  the  inheritance  feature.  Block  inheritance  means  that  variables
               declared outside a block are available from inside the block unless overridden.  Defaults to 1.

           include_support
               When  this is set to 1, the directive "Include" will be treated specially by the parser.  It will
               cause the value to be treated as a filename and that filename  will  be  read  in.   If  you  use
               "Include" with a directory, every file in that directory will be included.  This matches Apache's
               behavior and allows users to break up configuration files into multiple, possibly shared, pieces.
               Defaults to 1.

           autoload_support
               Set this to 1 and all your directives will be available as object methods.  So instead of:

                 $config-&gt;get("foo");

               You can write:

                 $config-&gt;foo;

               Defaults to 0.

           case_sensitive
               Set this to 1 to preserve the case of directive names.  Otherwise, all names will be "lc()"ed and
               matched case-insensitively.  Defaults to 0.

           fix_booleans
               If set to 1, then during parsing, the strings "Yes", "On", and "True" will be converted to 1, and
               the  strings  "No", "Off", and "False" will be converted to 0. This allows you to more easily use
               "get()" in conditional statements.

               For example:

                 # httpd.conf
                 UseCanonicalName  On

               Then in Perl:

                 $config = Config::ApacheFormat-&gt;new(fix_booleans =&gt; 1);
                 $config-&gt;read("httpd.conf");

                 if ($config-&gt;get("UseCanonicalName")) {
                     # this will get executed if set to Yes/On/True
                 }

               This option defaults to 0.

           expand_vars
               If set, then you can use variable expansion in your config file by prefixing  directives  with  a
               "$". Hopefully this seems logical to you:

                 Website     <a href="http://my.own.dom">http://my.own.dom</a>
                 JScript     $Website/js
                 Images      $Website/images

               Undefined  variables  in  your  config file will result in an error. To use a literal "$", simply
               prefix it with a "\" (backslash). Like in Perl, you can use brackets  to  delimit  the  variables
               more precisely:

                 Nickname    Rob
                 Fullname    ${Nickname}ert

               Since only scalars are supported, if you use a multi-value, you will only get back the first one:

                 Options     Plus Minus "About the Same"
                 Values      $Options

               In  this  examples, "Values" will become "Plus". This is seldom a limitation since in most cases,
               variable subsitution is used like the first example shows. This option defaults to 0.

           setenv_vars
               If this is set to 1, then the special "SetEnv" directive will be set values  in  the  environment
               via %ENV.  Also, the special "UnSetEnv" directive will delete environment variables.

               For example:

                 # $ENV{PATH} = "<a href="file:/usr/sbin">/usr/sbin</a>:<a href="file:/usr/bin">/usr/bin</a>"
                 SetEnv PATH "<a href="file:/usr/sbin">/usr/sbin</a>:<a href="file:/usr/bin">/usr/bin</a>"

                 # $ENV{MY_SPECIAL_VAR} = 10
                 SetEnv MY_SPECIAL_VAR 10

                 # delete $ENV{THIS}
                 UnsetEnv THIS

               This option defaults to 0.

           valid_directives
               If  you  provide  an array of directive names then syntax errors will be generated during parsing
               for invalid directives.  Otherwise, any directive name will be accepted.  For  example,  to  only
               allow directives called "Bar" and "Bif":

                 $config = Config::ApacheFormat-&gt;new(
                                     valid_directives =&gt; [qw(Bar Bif)],
                                                    );

           valid_blocks
               If  you  provide  an array of block names then syntax errors will be generated during parsing for
               invalid blocks.  Otherwise, any block  name  will  be  accepted.   For  example,  to  only  allow
               "Directory" and "Location" blocks in your config file:

                 $config = Config::ApacheFormat-&gt;new(
                                     valid_blocks =&gt; [qw(Directory Location)],
                                                    );

           include_directives
               This  directive  controls the name of the include directive.  By default it is "['Include']", but
               you can set it to any list of directive names.

           root_directive
               This controls what the root directive is, if any.  If you set this to the name of a directive  it
               will  be  used  as  a  base  directory  for  "Include"  processing.   This mimics the behavior of
               "ServerRoot" in real Apache config files, and as such you'll want to set it to 'ServerRoot'  when
               parsing an Apache config.  The default is "undef".

           hash_directives
               This  determines which directives (if any) should be parsed so that the first value is actually a
               key into the remaining values. For example, "AddHandler" is such a directive.

                 AddHandler cgi-script .cgi .sh
                 AddHandler server-parsed .shtml

               To parse this correctly, use:

                 $config = Config::ApacheFormat-&gt;new(
                                     hash_directives =&gt; [qw(AddHandler PerlSetVar)]
                                                    );

               Then, use the two-argument form of "get()":

                 @values = $config-&gt;get(AddHandler =&gt; 'cgi-script');

               This allows you to access each directive  individually,  which  is  needed  to  correctly  handle
               certain special-case Apache settings.

           duplicate_directives
               This  option controls how duplicate directives are handled. By default, if multiple directives of
               the same name are encountered, the last one wins:

                 Port 8080
                 # ...
                 Port 5053

               In this case, the directive "Port" would be set to the last value, 5053.  This is useful  because
               it allows you to include other config files, which you can then override:

                 # default setup
                 Include /my/app/defaults.conf

                 # override port
                 Port 5053

               In addition to this default behavior, "Config::ApacheFormat" also supports the following modes:

                 last     -  the value from the last one is kept (default)
                 error    -  duplicate directives result in an error
                 combine  -  combine values of duplicate directives together

               These  should be self-explanatory. If set to "error", any duplicates will result in an error.  If
               set to "last" (the default), the last value wins. If set to "combine", then duplicate  directives
               are combined together, just like they had been specified on the same line.

           All of the above attributes are also available as accessor methods.  Thus, this:

             $config = Config::ApacheFormat-&gt;new(inheritance_support =&gt; 0,
                                                 include_support =&gt; 1);

           Is equivalent to:

             $config = Config::ApacheFormat-&gt;new();
             $config-&gt;<a href="../man0/inheritance_support.0.html">inheritance_support</a>(0);
             $config-&gt;<a href="../man1/include_support.1.html">include_support</a>(1);

       $config-&gt;read("my.conf");
       $config-&gt;read(\*FILE);
           Reads  a  configuration file into the config object.  You must pass either the path of the file to be
           read or a reference to an open filehandle.  If an error is encountered while reading the  file,  this
           method will <b>die()</b>.

           Calling  <b>read()</b> more than once will add the new configuration values from another source, overwriting
           any conflicting values.  Call <b>clear()</b> first if you want to read a new set from scratch.

       "$value = $config-&gt;get("var_name")"
       "@vals = $config-&gt;get("list_name")"
       "$value = $config-&gt;get("hash_var_name", "key")"
           Returns values from the configuration file.  If the directive contains a single  value,  it  will  be
           returned.   If  the directive contains a list of values then they will be returned as a list.  If the
           directive does not exist in the configuration file then nothing will be  returned  (undef  in  scalar
           context, empty list in list context).

           For example, given this confiuration file:

             Foo 1
             Bar bif baz bop

           The following code would work as expected:

             my $foo = $config-&gt;get("Foo");   # $foo = 1
             my @bar = $config-&gt;get("Bar");   # @bar = ("bif", "baz", "bop")

           If  the  name  is  the  name  of a block tag in the configuration file then a list of available block
           specifiers will be returned.  For example, given this configuration file:

             &lt;Site big&gt;
                Size 10
             &lt;/Site&gt;

             &lt;Site small&gt;
                Size 1
             &lt;/Site&gt;

           This call:

             @sites = $config-&gt;get("Site");

           Will return "([ Site =" "big"], [ Site =&gt; "small" ])&gt;.  These  arrays  can  then  be  used  with  the
           <b>block()</b> method described below.

           If the directive was included in the file but did not have a value, 1 is returned by <b>get()</b>.

           Calling <b>get()</b> with no arguments will return the names of all available directives.

           Directives declared in "hash_directives" require a key value:

             $handler = $config-&gt;get("AddHandler", "cgi-script");

           "directive()" is available as an alias for "get()".

       $block = $config-&gt;block("BlockName")
       $block = $config-&gt;block(Directory =&gt; "/foo/bar")
       $block = $config-&gt;block(Directory =&gt; "~" =&gt; "^.*/bar")
           This  method  returns  a  Config::ApacheFormat  object  used  to  access  the  values inside a block.
           Parameters specified within the block will be available.  Also, if  inheritance  is  turned  on  (the
           default),  values  set  outside  the  block  that  are  not overwritten inside the block will also be
           available.  For example, given this file:

             MaxSize 100

             &lt;Site "big"&gt;
                Size 10
             &lt;/Site&gt;

             &lt;Site "small"&gt;
                Size 1
             &lt;/Site&gt;

           this code:

             print "Max: ", $config-&gt;get("MaxSize"), "\n";

             $block = $config-&gt;block(Site =&gt; "big");
             print "Big: ", $block-&gt;get("Size"), " / ",
                            $block-&gt;get("MaxSize"), "\n";

             $block = $config-&gt;block(Site =&gt; "small");
             print "Small: ", $block-&gt;get("Size"), " / ",
                              $block-&gt;get("MaxSize"), "\n";

           will print:

             Max: 100
             Big: 10 / 100
             Small: 1 / 100

           Note that "block()" does not require any particular number of parameters.  Any number will  work,  as
           long as they uniquely identify a block in the configuration file.  To get a list of available blocks,
           use <b>get()</b> with the name of the block tag.

           This method will <b>die()</b> if no block can be found matching the specifier passed in.

       $config-&gt;<b>clear()</b>
           Clears out all data in $config.  Call before re-calling $config-&gt;<b>read()</b> for a fresh read.

       $config-&gt;<b>dump()</b>
           This  returns  a  dumped copy of the current configuration. It can be used on a block object as well.
           Since it returns a string, you should say:

               print $config-&gt;dump;

           Or:

               for ($config-&gt;block(VirtualHost =&gt; '10.1.65.1')) {
                   print $_-&gt;dump;
               }

           If you want to see any output.

</pre><h4><b>Parsing</b> <b>a</b> <b>Real</b> <b>Apache</b> <b>Config</b> <b>File</b></h4><pre>
       To parse a real Apache config file (ex. "httpd.conf")  you'll  need  to  use  some  non-default  options.
       Here's a reasonable starting point:

         $config = Config::ApacheFormat-&gt;new(
                     root_directive     =&gt; 'ServerRoot',
                     hash_directives    =&gt; [ 'AddHandler' ],
                     include_directives =&gt; [ 'Include',
                                             'AccessConfig',
                                             'ResourceConfig' ],
                     setenv_vars        =&gt; 1,
                     fix_booleans       =&gt; 1);

</pre><h4><b>TODO</b></h4><pre>
       Some possible ideas for future development:

       •   Add a <b>set()</b> method.  (useless?)

       •   Add a <b>write()</b> method to create a new configuration file.  (useless?)

       Include  the  version  of  the  module  you're  using  and  a  small  piece  of code that I can run which
       demonstrates the problem.
