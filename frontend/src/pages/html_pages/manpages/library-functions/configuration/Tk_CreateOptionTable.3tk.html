</pre><h4><b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Tcl_Interp <u>*interp</u> (in)                     A  Tcl  interpreter.   Most  procedures  use  this  only  for
                                                   returning error  messages;  if  it  is  NULL  then  no  error
                                                   messages  are  returned.   For <b>Tk_CreateOptionTable</b> the value
                                                   cannot be NULL; it gives the interpreter in which the  option
                                                   table will be used.

                                                   are stored; fields of this record are modified by  procedures
                                                   such   as  <b>Tk_SetOptions</b>  and  read  by  procedures  such  as

                                                   the  window in which the option will be used.  If <u>optionTable</u>
                                                   uses no window-dependent options, then a NULL  value  may  be

                                                   modified  and  old  values  are  restored automatically if an
                                                   error occurs in <b>Tk_SetOptions</b>.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       These  procedures  handle  most  of  the  details  of  parsing configuration options such as those for Tk
       widgets.  Given a description of what options are supported, these procedures handle all the  details  of
       parsing  options  and  storing  their values into a C structure associated with the widget or object. The
       procedures were designed primarily for widgets in Tk, but they can  also  be  used  for  other  kinds  of
       objects  that have configuration options.  In the rest of this manual page “widget” will be used to refer
       to the object whose options are being managed; in practice the object may not actually be a widget.   The
       term  “widget  record”  is used to refer to the C-level structure in which information about a particular
       widget or object is stored.

       Note that the easiest way to learn how to use these procedures is to look at a working example.   In  Tk,
       the  simplest  example  is the code that implements the button family of widgets, which is in <b>tkButton.c</b>.
       Other examples are in <b>tkSquare.c</b> and <b>tkMenu.c</b>.

       In order to use these procedures, the code that implements the widget must  contain  a  static  array  of
       Tk_OptionSpec  structures.  This is a template that describes the various options supported by that class
       of widget; there is a separate template for each kind of widget.  The template contains information  such
       as  the  name of each option, its type, its default value, and where the value of the option is stored in
       the widget record.  See TEMPLATES below for more detail.

       In order to process configuration options  efficiently,  the  static  template  must  be  augmented  with
       additional  information  that  is  available only at runtime.  The procedure <b>Tk_CreateOptionTable</b> creates
       this dynamic information from the template and returns a Tk_OptionTable token  that  describes  both  the
       static   and  dynamic  information.   All  of  the  other  procedures,  such  as  <b>Tk_SetOptions</b>,  take  a
       Tk_OptionTable token as argument.  Typically, <b>Tk_CreateOptionTable</b> is called the first time that a widget
       of a particular class is created and the resulting Tk_OptionTable is used in the future for  all  widgets
       of  that  class.  A Tk_OptionTable may be used only in a single interpreter, given by the <u>interp</u> argument
       to <b>Tk_CreateOptionTable</b>.  When an option table is no longer needed <b>Tk_DeleteOptionTable</b> should be  called
       to  free all of its resources.  All of the option tables for a Tcl interpreter are freed automatically if
       the interpreter is deleted.

       <b>Tk_InitOptions</b> is invoked when a new widget is created to set  the  default  values.   <b>Tk_InitOptions</b>  is
       passed  a  token for an option table (<u>optionTable</u>) and a pointer to a widget record (<u>recordPtr</u>), which is
       the C structure that holds information about this widget.  <b>Tk_InitOptions</b> uses  the  information  in  the
       option  table to choose an appropriate default for each option, then it stores the default value directly
       into the widget record, overwriting any information that  was  already  present  in  the  widget  record.
       <b>Tk_InitOptions</b>  normally  returns  <b>TCL_OK</b>.   If an error occurred while setting the default values (e.g.,
       because a default value was erroneous) then <b>TCL_ERROR</b> is  returned  and  an  error  message  is  left  in
       <u>interp</u>'s   result   if   <u>interp</u>   is   not   NULL.   For  any  widget's  configuration  option  that  has
       <b>TK_OPTION_DONT_SET_DEFAULT</b> set in its <u>flags</u> field, the above initialization is fully skipped, see below.

       <b>Tk_SetOptions</b> is invoked to modify configuration options based on information specified in a Tcl command.
       The command might be one that creates a new widget, or a command that modifies  options  on  an  existing
       widget.   The  <u>objc</u>  and  <u>objv</u> arguments describe the values of the arguments from the Tcl command.  <u>Objv</u>
       must contain an even number of objects: the first object of each pair gives the name of an option and the
       second object gives the new value for that option.  <b>Tk_SetOptions</b> looks  up  each  name  in  <u>optionTable</u>,
       checks  that the new value of the option conforms to the type in <u>optionTable</u>, and stores the value of the
       option into the widget record given by <u>recordPtr</u>.  <b>Tk_SetOptions</b> normally returns <b>TCL_OK</b>.   If  an  error
       occurred  (such  as  an unknown option name or an illegal option value) then <b>TCL_ERROR</b> is returned and an
       error message is left in <u>interp</u>'s result if <u>interp</u> is not NULL.

       <b>Tk_SetOptions</b> has two additional features.  First, if the <u>maskPtr</u> argument is not NULL then it points  to
       an  integer  value  that  is  filled  in with information about the options that were modified.  For each
       option in the template passed to <b>Tk_CreateOptionTable</b> there is a <u>typeMask</u> field.  The bits of this  field
       are  defined  by  the  code  that  implements  the  widget;  for  example, each bit might correspond to a
       particular configuration option.  Alternatively, bits might be used functionally.  For example,  one  bit
       might  be used for redisplay: all options that affect the widget's display, such that changing the option
       requires the widget to be redisplayed, might have that bit set.  Another  bit  might  indicate  that  the
       geometry  of  the  widget must be recomputed, and so on.  <b>Tk_SetOptions</b> OR's together the <u>typeMask</u> fields
       from all the options that were modified and returns this value at *<u>maskPtr</u>; the caller can then use  this
       information  to  optimize  itself  so that, for example, it does not redisplay the widget if the modified
       options do not affect the widget's appearance.

       The second additional feature of <b>Tk_SetOptions</b> has to do with error recovery.  If an error  occurs  while
       processing configuration options, this feature makes it possible to restore all the configuration options
       to  their previous values.  Errors can occur either while processing options in <b>Tk_SetOptions</b> or later in
       the caller.  In many cases the  caller  does  additional  processing  after  <b>Tk_SetOptions</b>  returns;  for
       example,  it  might  use  an  option  value  to  set a trace on a variable and may detect an error if the
       variable is an array instead of a scalar.  Error recovery is enabled by passing in a non-NULL  value  for
       the  <u>savePtr</u>  argument  to  <b>Tk_SetOptions</b>;  this  should be a pointer to an uninitialized Tk_SavedOptions
       structure on the caller's stack.  <b>Tk_SetOptions</b> overwrites the  structure  pointed  to  by  <u>savePtr</u>  with
       information  about  the  old  values  of any options modified by the procedure.  If <b>Tk_SetOptions</b> returns
       successfully, the caller uses the structure in one of two ways.  If the caller completes  its  processing
       of the new options without any errors, then it must pass the structure to <b>Tk_FreeSavedOptions</b> so that the
       old  values  can  be freed.  If the caller detects an error in its processing of the new options, then it
       should pass the structure to <b>Tk_RestoreSavedOptions</b>, which will copy the old values back into the  widget
       record  and  free  the  new values.  If <b>Tk_SetOptions</b> detects an error then it automatically restores any
       options that had already been modified and leaves *<u>savePtr</u> in an empty state: the caller  need  not  call
       either  <b>Tk_FreeSavedOptions</b>  or <b>Tk_RestoreSavedOptions</b>.  If the <u>savePtr</u> argument to <b>Tk_SetOptions</b> is NULL
       then <b>Tk_SetOptions</b> frees each old option value immediately when it sets a new value for the  option.   In
       this  case,  if  an  error occurs in the third option, the old values for the first two options cannot be
       restored.

       <b>Tk_GetOptionValue</b> returns the current value of a configuration  option  for  a  particular  widget.   The
       <u>namePtr</u>  argument contains the name of an option; <b>Tk_GetOptionValue</b> uses <u>optionTable</u> to lookup the option
       and extract its value from the widget  record  pointed  to  by  <u>recordPtr</u>,  then  it  returns  an  object
       containing  that  value.  If an error occurs (e.g., because <u>namePtr</u> contains an unknown option name) then
       NULL is returned and an error message is left in <u>interp</u>'s result unless <u>interp</u> is NULL.

       <b>Tk_GetOptionInfo</b> returns information about configuration options in a form suitable for <b>configure</b>  widget
       commands.   If  the  <u>namePtr</u>  argument  is  not  NULL,  it  points  to an object that gives the name of a
       configuration option; <b>Tk_GetOptionInfo</b> returns an object containing a list with five elements, which  are
       the  name of the option, the name and class used for the option in the option database, the default value
       for the option, and  the  current  value  for  the  option.   If  the  <u>namePtr</u>  argument  is  NULL,  then
       <b>Tk_GetOptionInfo</b>  returns  information  about  all  options  in the form of a list of lists; each sublist
       describes one option.  Synonym options are handled differently depending on whether <u>namePtr</u> is  NULL:  if
       <u>namePtr</u> is NULL then the sublist for each synonym option has only two elements, which are the name of the
       option  and  the  name  of the other option that it refers to; if <u>namePtr</u> is non-NULL and names a synonym
       option then the object returned is the five-element list for the other option that the synonym refers to.
       If an error occurs (e.g., because <u>namePtr</u> contains an unknown option name) then NULL is returned  and  an
       error message is left in <u>interp</u>'s result unless <u>interp</u> is NULL.

       <b>Tk_FreeConfigOptions</b>  must be invoked when a widget is deleted.  It frees all of the resources associated
       with any of the configuration options defined in <u>recordPtr</u> by <u>optionTable</u>.

</pre><h4><b>TEMPLATES</b></h4><pre>
       The array of Tk_OptionSpec  structures  passed  to  <b>Tk_CreateOptionTable</b>  via  its  <u>templatePtr</u>  argument
       describes the configuration options supported by a particular class of widgets.  Each structure specifies
       one configuration option and has the following fields:
              typedef struct {
                  Tk_OptionType <u>type</u>;
                  const char *<u>optionName</u>;
                  const char *<u>dbName</u>;
                  const char *<u>dbClass</u>;
                  const char *<u>defValue</u>;
                  Tcl_Size <u>objOffset</u>;
                  Tcl_Size <u>internalOffset</u>;
                  int <u>flags</u>;
                  const void *<u>clientData</u>;
                  int <u>typeMask</u>;
              } <b>Tk_OptionSpec</b>;
       The  <u>type</u>  field  indicates  what  kind of configuration option this is (e.g. <b>TK_OPTION_COLOR</b> for a color
       value, or <b>TK_OPTION_INT</b> for an integer value).  <u>Type</u> determines how the value of  the  option  is  parsed
       (more on this below).  The <u>optionName</u> field is a string such as <b>-font</b> or <b>-bg</b>; it is the name used for the
       option  in  Tcl  commands  and  passed  to  procedures via the <u>objc</u> or <u>namePtr</u> arguments.  The <u>dbName</u> and
       <u>dbClass</u> fields are used by <b>Tk_InitOptions</b> to look up a default  value  for  this  option  in  the  option
       database;  if <u>dbName</u> is NULL then the option database is not used by <b>Tk_InitOptions</b> for this option.  The
       <u>defValue</u> field specifies a default value for this configuration option if no value is  specified  in  the
       option  database.   The  <u>objOffset</u>  and  <u>internalOffset</u>  fields indicate where to store the value of this
       option in widget records (more on this below); values for the <u>objOffset</u> and <u>internalOffset</u> fields  should
       always  be generated with the <b>offsetof</b> macro.  The <u>flags</u> field contains additional information to control
       the processing of this configuration option (see below  for  details).   <u>ClientData</u>  provides  additional
       type-specific  data  needed  by  certain types.  For instance, for <b>TK_OPTION_COLOR</b> types, <u>clientData</u> is a
       string giving the default value to use on monochrome displays.  See the  descriptions  of  the  different
       types  below for details.  The last field, <u>typeMask</u>, is used by <b>Tk_SetOptions</b> to return information about
       which options were modified; see the description of <b>Tk_SetOptions</b> above for details.

       When <b>Tk_InitOptions</b> and <b>Tk_SetOptions</b> store the value of an option into the widget record, they can do it
       in either of two ways.  If the <u>objOffset</u> field of the Tk_OptionSpec is greater than  or  equal  to  zero,
       then  the  value  of  the option is stored as a (Tcl_Obj *) at the location in the widget record given by
       <u>objOffset</u>.  If the <u>internalOffset</u> field of the Tk_OptionSpec is greater than or equal to zero,  then  the
       value of the option is stored in a type-specific internal form at the location in the widget record given
       by  <u>internalOffset</u>.   For  example,  if  the  option's type is <b>TK_OPTION_INT</b> then the internal form is an
       integer.  If the <u>objOffset</u> or <u>internalOffset</u> field is negative then the value is not stored in that form.
       At least one of the offsets must be greater than or equal to zero.

       The <u>flags</u> field consists of one or more bits ORed together. The following flags are supported:

       <b>TK_OPTION_NULL_OK</b>
              If this bit is set for an option then an empty string will be accepted as the value for the option
              and the resulting internal form will be a NULL pointer, a zero value, or <b>None</b>,  depending  on  the
              type  of  the  option.   If  the  flag  is  not  set  then  empty  strings  will result in errors.
              <b>TK_OPTION_NULL_OK</b> is typically used to allow a feature to be  turned  off  entirely,  e.g.  set  a
              cursor  value  to <b>None</b> so that a window simply inherits its parent's cursor.  Not all option types
              support the <b>TK_OPTION_NULL_OK</b> flag; for those that do, there is an  explicit  indication  of  that
              fact in the descriptions below.

       <b>TK_OPTION_DONT_SET_DEFAULT</b>
              If  this  bit  is  set  for an option then no default value will be set in <b>Tk_InitOptions</b> for this
              option. Neither the option database, nor any system default value, nor  <u>optionTable</u>  are  used  to
              give  a default value to this option. Instead it is assumed that the caller has already supplied a
              default value in the widget code.

       <b>TK_OPTION_ENUM_VAR</b>
              If this value is set for an option, then it indicates the the internalOffset  points  to  an  enum
              variable  in  stead  of  an int variable.  Only useful in combination with <b>TK_OPTION_STRING_TABLE</b>,
              <b>TK_OPTION_BOOLEAN</b>, <b>TK_OPTION_ANCHOR</b>, <b>TK_OPTION_JUSTIFY</b>, or <b>TK_OPTION_ANCHOR</b>.

       <b>TK_OPTION_VAR(</b><u>type</u><b>)</b>
              If this value is set for an option, then it indicates the the  internalOffset  points  to  a  <u>type</u>
              variable  in  stead of an int variable.  Only useful in combination with <b>TK_OPTION_STRING_TABLE</b> or
              <b>TK_OPTION_BOOLEAN</b>, or as <b>TK_OPTION_VAR(Tcl_Size)</b> with <b>TK_OPTION_INT</b>

              The <u>type</u> field of each  Tk_OptionSpec  structure  determines  how  to  parse  the  value  of  that
              configuration  option.  The  legal  value  for  <u>type</u>, and the corresponding actions, are described
              below.  If the type requires a <u>tkwin</u> value to be passed into procedures like <b>Tk_SetOptions</b>, or  if
              it  uses  the  <u>clientData</u>  field  of  the  Tk_OptionSpec,  then it is indicated explicitly; if not
              mentioned, the type requires neither <u>tkwin</u> nor <u>clientData</u>.

       <b>TK_OPTION_ANCHOR</b>
              The value must be a standard anchor position such as  <b>ne</b>  or  <b>center</b>.   The  internal  form  is  a
              Tk_Anchor  value  like  the  ones  returned by <b>Tk_GetAnchorFromObj</b>.  This option type supports the
              <b>TK_OPTION_NULL_OK</b> flag; if the empty string is specified as the value for the option, the  integer
              relief value is set to <b>TK_ANCHOR_NULL</b>.

       <b>TK_OPTION_BITMAP</b>
              The  value  must  be  a standard Tk bitmap name. The internal form is a Pixmap token like the ones
              returned by <b>Tk_AllocBitmapFromObj</b>.  This option type requires <u>tkwin</u> to be supplied  to  procedures
              such as <b>Tk_SetOptions</b>, and it supports the <b>TK_OPTION_NULL_OK</b> flag.

       <b>TK_OPTION_BOOLEAN</b>
              The  value  must  be a standard boolean value such as <b>true</b> or <b>no</b>.  The internal form is an integer
              with value 0 or 1.  Note that if the <u>objOffset</u> field is not used, information about  the  original
              value  of  this  option  will be lost.  This option type supports the <b>TK_OPTION_NULL_OK</b> flag; if a
              NULL value is set, the internal representation is set to -1.

       <b>TK_OPTION_BORDER</b>
              The value must be a standard color  name  such  as  <b>red</b>  or  <b>#ff8080</b>.   The  internal  form  is  a
              Tk_3DBorder  token  like  the ones returned by <b>Tk_Alloc3DBorderFromObj</b>.  This option type requires
              <u>tkwin</u> to be supplied to procedures such as <b>Tk_SetOptions</b>, and it  supports  the  <b>TK_OPTION_NULL_OK</b>
              flag.

       <b>TK_OPTION_COLOR</b>
              The  value  must be a standard color name such as <b>red</b> or <b>#ff8080</b>.  The internal form is an (XColor
              *) token like the ones returned by <b>Tk_AllocColorFromObj</b>.  This option type requires  <u>tkwin</u>  to  be
              supplied to procedures such as <b>Tk_SetOptions</b>, and it supports the <b>TK_OPTION_NULL_OK</b> flag.

       <b>TK_OPTION_CURSOR</b>
              The  value must be a standard cursor name such as <b>cross</b> or <b>@foo</b>.  The internal form is a Tk_Cursor
              token like the ones returned by <b>Tk_AllocCursorFromObj</b>.  This option  type  requires  <u>tkwin</u>  to  be
              supplied to procedures such as <b>Tk_SetOptions</b>, and when the option is set the cursor for the window
              is changed by calling <b>XDefineCursor</b>.  This option type also supports the <b>TK_OPTION_NULL_OK</b> flag.

       <b>TK_OPTION_CUSTOM</b>
              This  option  allows  applications  to define new option types.  The clientData field of the entry
              points to a structure defining the new option type.  See the section <b>CUSTOM</b> <b>OPTION</b> <b>TYPES</b> below for
              details.

       <b>TK_OPTION_DOUBLE</b>
              The string value must be a floating-point number in the format accepted by <b>strtol</b>.   The  internal
              form  is  a C <b>double</b> value.  This option type supports the <b>TK_OPTION_NULL_OK</b> flag; if a NULL value
              is set, the internal representation is set to NaN.

       <b>TK_OPTION_END</b>
              Marks the end of the template.  There must be a Tk_OptionSpec structure with <u>type</u> <b>TK_OPTION_END</b> at
              the end of each template.  If the <u>clientData</u> field of this structure is not NULL, then  it  points
              to  an  additional  array  of Tk_OptionSpec's, which is itself terminated by another <b>TK_OPTION_END</b>
              entry.  Templates may be chained arbitrarily deeply.  This feature allows  common  options  to  be
              shared by several widget classes.

       <b>TK_OPTION_FONT</b>
              The  value  must  be a standard font name such as <b>Times</b> <b>16</b>.  The internal form is a Tk_Font handle
              like the ones returned by <b>Tk_AllocFontFromObj</b>.  This option type requires <u>tkwin</u> to be supplied  to
              procedures such as <b>Tk_SetOptions</b>, and it supports the <b>TK_OPTION_NULL_OK</b> flag.

       <b>TK_OPTION_INT</b>
              The  string  value must be an integer in the format accepted by <b>strtol</b> (e.g. <b>0</b> and <b>0x</b> prefixes may
              be used to specify octal or hexadecimal numbers, respectively).  The internal  form  is  a  C  <b>int</b>
              value.  This option type supports the <b>TK_OPTION_NULL_OK</b> flag; if a NULL value is set, the internal
              representation is set to INT_MIN.

       <b>TK_OPTION_INDEX</b>
              The  string  value  must  be  an index in the format accepted by <b>Tcl_GetIntForIndex()</b> or the empty
              string.  The internal form is  a  C  <b>int</b>  value.  If  the  string  starts  with  <b>-</b>,  the  internal
              representation will be set to INT_MIN. If the string has the form <b>end-???</b>, then the result will be
              a  negative  number:  <b>-1</b> stands for <b>end</b>, <b>-2</b> stands for <b>end-1</b> and so on.  This option type supports
              the <b>TK_OPTION_NULL_OK</b> flag; if a NULL value is set, the internal representation is set to INT_MIN.

       <b>TK_OPTION_JUSTIFY</b>
              The value must be a standard justification value such as <b>left</b>.  The internal form is a  Tk_Justify
              like the values returned by <b>Tk_GetJustifyFromObj</b>.  This option type supports the <b>TK_OPTION_NULL_OK</b>
              flag;  if  the  empty string is specified as the value for the option, the integer relief value is
              set to <b>TK_JUSTIFY_NULL</b>.

       <b>TK_OPTION_PIXELS</b>
              The value must specify a screen distance such as <b>2i</b> or <b>6.4</b>.  The internal form is an integer value
              giving a distance in pixels, like the values returned by <b>Tk_GetPixelsFromObj</b>.  Note  that  if  the
              <u>objOffset</u>  field  is  not  used, information about the original value of this option will be lost.
              See  <b>OBJOFFSET</b>  <b>VS.</b>  <b>INTERNALOFFSET</b>  below  for  details.    This   option   type   supports   the
              <b>TK_OPTION_NULL_OK</b> flag; if a NULL value is set, the internal representation is set to INT_MIN.

       <b>TK_OPTION_RELIEF</b>
              The  value  must  be standard relief such as <b>raised</b>.  The internal form is an integer relief value
              such as <b>TK_RELIEF_RAISED</b>.  This option type supports the <b>TK_OPTION_NULL_OK</b> flag; if a  NULL  value
              is set, the internal representation is set to <b>TK_RELIEF_NULL</b>.

       <b>TK_OPTION_STRING</b>
              The value may be any string.  The internal form is a (char *) pointer that points to a dynamically
              allocated copy of the value.  This option type supports the <b>TK_OPTION_NULL_OK</b> flag.

       <b>TK_OPTION_STRING_TABLE</b>
              For  this  type,  <u>clientData</u>  is  a  pointer  to  an  array  of  strings  suitable  for passing to
              <b>Tcl_GetIndexFromObj</b>.  The value must be one of the strings in the table, or a unique  abbreviation
              of  one  of  the  strings.  The internal form is an integer giving the index into the table of the
              matching string, like the return value from <b>Tcl_GetStringFromObj</b>.  This option type  supports  the
              <b>TK_OPTION_NULL_OK</b> flag; if a NULL value is set, the internal representation is set to -1.

       <b>TK_OPTION_SYNONYM</b>
              This  type is used to provide alternative names for an option (for example, <b>-bg</b> is often used as a
              synonym for <b>-background</b>).  The <b>clientData</b> field is a string that gives the name of another  option
              in  the  same  table.   Whenever the synonym option is used, the information from the other option
              will be used instead.

       <b>TK_OPTION_WINDOW</b>
              The value must be a window path name.  The internal form is a  <b>Tk_Window</b>  token  for  the  window.
              This  option  type  requires <u>tkwin</u> to be supplied to procedures such as <b>Tk_SetOptions</b> (in order to
              identify the application), and it supports the <b>TK_OPTION_NULL_OK</b> flag.

</pre><h4><b>STORAGE</b> <b>MANAGEMENT</b> <b>ISSUES</b></h4><pre>
       If a field of a widget record has its offset stored  in  the  <u>objOffset</u>  or  <u>internalOffset</u>  field  of  a
       Tk_OptionSpec  structure then the procedures described here will handle all of the storage allocation and
       resource management issues associated  with  the  field.   When  the  value  of  an  option  is  changed,
       <b>Tk_SetOptions</b>  (or  <b>Tk_FreeSavedOptions</b>)  will  automatically  free any resources associated with the old
       value, such as Tk_Fonts for <b>TK_OPTION_FONT</b> options or dynamically allocated memory  for  <b>TK_OPTION_STRING</b>
       options.   For  an  option  stored  as an object using the <u>objOffset</u> field of a Tk_OptionSpec, the widget
       record shares the object pointed to by the <u>objv</u> value from the  call  to  <b>Tk_SetOptions</b>.   The  reference
       count  for this object is incremented when a pointer to it is stored in the widget record and decremented
       when the option is modified.  When the widget is deleted <b>Tk_FreeConfigOptions</b> should be invoked; it  will
       free the resources associated with all options and decrement reference counts for any objects.

       However,  the  widget code is responsible for storing NULL or <b>None</b> in all pointer and token fields before
       invoking <b>Tk_InitOptions</b>.  This is needed to allow proper cleanup in the rare case where an  error  occurs
       in <b>Tk_InitOptions</b>.

</pre><h4><b>OBJOFFSET</b> <b>VS.</b> <b>INTERNALOFFSET</b></h4><pre>
       In  most  cases  it  is simplest to use the <u>internalOffset</u> field of a Tk_OptionSpec structure and not the
       <u>objOffset</u> field.  This makes the internal form of the value immediately available to the widget  code  so
       the  value  does  not  have  to be extracted from an object each time it is used.  However, there are two
       cases where the <u>objOffset</u> field is useful.  The first case is  for  <b>TK_OPTION_PIXELS</b>  options.   In  this
       case,  the  internal  form  is an integer pixel value that is valid only for a particular screen.  If the
       value of the option is retrieved, it will be returned as a simple number.  For example, after the command
       <b>.b</b> <b>configure</b> <b>-borderwidth</b> <b>2m</b>, the command <b>.b</b> <b>configure</b> <b>-borderwidth</b> might return 7, which is the  integer
       pixel  value  corresponding to <b>2m</b>.  Unfortunately, this loses the original screen-independent value. Thus
       for <b>TK_OPTION_PIXELS</b> options it is better to use the <u>objOffset</u> field.  In this case the original value of
       the option is retained in the object and can be returned when the option is  retrieved.   It  might  seem
       convenient  to  use  the <u>internalOffset</u> field as well, so that the integer value is immediately available
       for use in the widget code. But if scaling is  involved,  <u>internalOffset</u>  won't  change  value  when  the
       scaling  changes.  Therefore  it is better always to use <b>Tk_GetPixelsFromObj</b> to extract the integer value
       from the object whenever it is needed.  Note: the problem of losing information on retrievals exists only
       for <b>TK_OPTION_PIXELS</b> options.

       The second reason to use the <u>objOffset</u> field is in order to implement new types of options not  supported
       by  these procedures.  To implement a new type of option, you can use <b>TK_OPTION_STRING</b> as the type in the
       Tk_OptionSpec structure and set the <u>objOffset</u> field  but  not  the  <u>internalOffset</u>  field.   Then,  after
       calling <b>Tk_SetOptions</b>, convert the object to internal form yourself.

       Ttk  widgets do not support the <u>internalOffset</u> machinery.  Option values of Ttk widgets are always stored
       as (Tcl_Obj *), meaning that the <u>objOffset</u> field must be used.

</pre><h4><b>CUSTOM</b> <b>OPTION</b> <b>TYPES</b></h4><pre>
       Applications can extend the built-in configuration types with additional configuration types  by  writing
       procedures  to parse, print, free, and restore saved copies of the type and creating a structure pointing
       to those procedures:
              typedef struct {
                  const char *<u>name</u>;
                  Tk_CustomOptionSetProc *<u>setProc</u>;
                  Tk_CustomOptionGetProc *<u>getProc</u>;
                  Tk_CustomOptionRestoreProc *<u>restoreProc</u>;
                  Tk_CustomOptionFreeProc *<u>freeProc</u>;
                  void *<u>clientData</u>;
              } <b>Tk_ObjCustomOption</b>;

              typedef int <b>Tk_CustomOptionSetProc</b>(
                  void *<u>clientData</u>,
                  Tcl_Interp *<u>interp</u>,
                  Tk_Window <u>tkwin</u>,
                  Tcl_Obj **<u>valuePtr</u>,
                  char *<u>recordPtr</u>,
                  int <u>internalOffset</u>,
                  char *<u>saveInternalPtr</u>,
                  int <u>flags</u>);

              typedef Tcl_Obj *<b>Tk_CustomOptionGetProc</b>(
                  void *<u>clientData</u>,
                  Tk_Window <u>tkwin</u>,
                  char *<u>recordPtr</u>,
                  int <u>internalOffset</u>);

              typedef void <b>Tk_CustomOptionRestoreProc</b>(
                  void *<u>clientData</u>,
                  Tk_Window <u>tkwin</u>,
                  char *<u>internalPtr</u>,
                  char *<u>saveInternalPtr</u>);

              typedef void <b>Tk_CustomOptionFreeProc</b>(
                  void *<u>clientData</u>,
                  Tk_Window <u>tkwin</u>,
                  char *<u>internalPtr</u>);

       The Tk_ObjCustomOption structure contains six fields: a name for the custom option type; pointers to  the
       four  procedures;  and  a  <u>clientData</u>  value to be passed to those procedures when they are invoked.  The
       <u>clientData</u> value typically points to a structure containing information that is needed by the  procedures
       when  they  are  parsing  and printing options.  <u>RestoreProc</u> and <u>freeProc</u> may be NULL, indicating that no
       function should be called for those operations.

       The <u>setProc</u> procedure is invoked by <b>Tk_SetOptions</b> to convert a Tcl_Obj into  an  internal  representation
       and store the resulting value in the widget record.  The arguments are:

              <u>clientData</u>
                     A copy of the <u>clientData</u> field in the Tk_ObjCustomOption structure.

              <u>interp</u> A pointer to a Tcl interpreter, used for error reporting.

              <u>Tkwin</u>  A copy of the <u>tkwin</u> argument to <b>Tk_SetOptions</b>

              <u>valuePtr</u>
                     A  pointer  to  a  reference to a Tcl_Obj describing the new value for the option; it could
                     have been specified explicitly in the call to <b>Tk_SetOptions</b>  or  it  could  come  from  the
                     option  database or a default.  If the objOffset for the option is non-negative (the option
                     value is stored as a (Tcl_Obj *) in the widget record), the Tcl_Obj pointer  referenced  by
                     <u>valuePtr</u>  is  the pointer that will be stored at the objOffset for the option.  <u>SetProc</u> may
                     modify the value if necessary; for example, <u>setProc</u> may change the value to NULL to support
                     the <b>TK_OPTION_NULL_OK</b> flag.

              <u>recordPtr</u>
                     A pointer to the start of the widget record to modify.

              <u>internalOffset</u>
                     Offset in bytes from the start of the widget record to  the  location  where  the  internal
                     representation of the option value is to be placed.

              <u>saveInternalPtr</u>
                     A   pointer   to  storage  allocated  in  a  Tk_SavedOptions  structure  for  the  internal
                     representation of the original option value.  Before setting the option to its  new  value,
                     <u>setProc</u>  should  set  the  value referenced by <u>saveInternalPtr</u> to the original value of the
                     option in order to support <b>Tk_RestoreSavedOptions</b>.

              <u>flags</u>  A copy of the <u>flags</u> field in the Tk_OptionSpec structure for the option

       <u>SetProc</u> returns a standard Tcl result: <b>TCL_OK</b> to indicate successful processing, or <b>TCL_ERROR</b> to indicate
       a failure of any kind.  An error message may be left in the Tcl interpreter given by <u>interp</u> in  the  case
       of an error.

       The  <u>getProc</u>  procedure  is  invoked  by  <b>Tk_GetOptionValue</b>  and  <b>Tk_GetOptionInfo</b>  to retrieve a Tcl_Obj
       representation of the internal representation of an option.  The <u>clientData</u> argument is  a  copy  of  the
       <u>clientData</u>  field  in  the  Tk_ObjCustomOption  structure.   <u>Tkwin</u>  is  a  copy  of the <u>tkwin</u> argument to
       <b>Tk_GetOptionValue</b> or <b>Tk_GetOptionInfo</b>.  <u>RecordPtr</u> is a pointer to the beginning of the widget  record  to
       query.   <u>InternalOffset</u>  is  the  offset in bytes from the beginning of the widget record to the location
       where the internal representation of the option value is stored.  <u>GetProc</u> must  return  a  pointer  to  a
       Tcl_Obj representing the value of the option.

       The  <u>restoreProc</u>  procedure  is  invoked by <b>Tk_RestoreSavedOptions</b> to restore a previously saved internal
       representation of a custom option value.  The <u>clientData</u> argument is a copy of the  <u>clientData</u>  field  in
       the  Tk_ObjCustomOption  structure.   <u>Tkwin</u>  is  a  copy  of  the  <u>tkwin</u> argument to <b>Tk_GetOptionValue</b> or
       <b>Tk_GetOptionInfo</b>.  <u>InternalPtr</u> is a pointer to the location where internal representation of  the  option
       value  is stored.  <u>SaveInternalPtr</u> is a pointer to the saved value.  <u>RestoreProc</u> must copy the value from
       <u>saveInternalPtr</u> to <u>internalPtr</u> to restore the value.  <u>RestoreProc</u> need not  free  any  memory  associated
       with  either  <u>internalPtr</u>  or <u>saveInternalPtr</u>; <u>freeProc</u> will be invoked to free that memory if necessary.
       <u>RestoreProc</u> has no return value.

       The <u>freeProc</u> procedure is invoked by <b>Tk_SetOptions</b> and <b>Tk_FreeSavedOptions</b> to free any storage  allocated
       for  the internal representation of a custom option.  The <u>clientData</u> argument is a copy of the <u>clientData</u>
       field in the Tk_ObjCustomOption structure.  <u>Tkwin</u> is a copy of the <u>tkwin</u> argument to <b>Tk_GetOptionValue</b> or
       <b>Tk_GetOptionInfo</b>.  <u>InternalPtr</u> is a pointer to the location where  the  internal  representation  of  the
       option  value is stored.  The <u>freeProc</u> must free any storage associated with the option.  <u>FreeProc</u> has no
       return value.
