       sqitch-configuration - Hierarchical engine and target configuration

</pre><h4><b>Description</b></h4><pre>
       The specification of database targets is core to Sqitch database change management. A target consists of
       a database connection URI &lt;https://github.com/libwww-perl/uri-db&gt;, a plan file, change script
       directories, a registry schema or database name, and the path to a database engine command-line client.
       Sqitch determines the values for these attributes via a hierarchical evaluation of the runtime
       configuration, examining and selecting from these values:

       1.  Command-line options

       2.  Target-specific configuration

       3.  Engine-specific configuration

       4.  Core configuration

       5.  A reasonable default

       This  document  explains  how  this  evaluation works, and how to use the "init", "config", "engine", and
       "target" commands to configure these values for various deployment scenarios.

</pre><h4><b>Project</b> <b>Initialization</b></h4><pre>
       Typically, the first thing you do with Sqitch is use the "init" command to start a new project. Now,  the
       most important thing Sqitch needs to know is what database engine you'll be managing, so it's best to use
       "--engine"  to  configure  the  engine  right  up  front to start off on the right foot. Here, we start a
       project called "widgets" to manage PostgreSQL databases:

         &gt; sqitch init widgets --engine pg
         Created sqitch.conf
         Created sqitch.plan
         Created deploy/
         Created revert/
         Created verify/

       This creates a very simple configuration file with most of the settings commented out, like so:

         &gt; cat sqitch.conf
         [core]
           engine = pg
           # plan_file = sqitch.plan
           # top_dir = .
         # [engine "pg"]
           # target = db:pg:
           # registry = sqitch
           # client = psql

       The "[core]" section contains default configurations, the most important of which is the default  engine,
       "pg".  Of  course,  it's the <u>only</u> engine this project supports, and the values of the other configuration
       variables are reasonable for a single-engine project. If your Sqitch project never needs to  manage  more
       than  one  database engine, this might be all you need: the current directory is the top directory of the
       project, and it's here you'll find the plan file as  well  as  the  deploy,  revert,  and  verify  script
       directories.  Once  you  start using the "add" command to add changes, and the "deploy" command to deploy
       changes to a database, these variables will be used extensively.

       The "[engine "pg"]" section houses the variables specific to the engine. The "target" defines the default
       database URI &lt;https://github.com/libwww-perl/uri-db&gt; for connecting to a PostgreSQL database. As you  can
       see  there isn't much here, but if you were to distribute this project, it's likely that your users would
       specify a target URI when deploying to their own databases. The "registry" determines where  Sqitch  will
       store its own metadata when managing a database; generally the default, "sqitch", is fine.

       More  interesting,  perhaps,  is  the "client" setting, which defaults to the appropriate engine-specific
       client name appropriate for your OS. In this example, sqitch will assume it can find <u>psql</u> in your path.

</pre><h4><b>Global</b> <b>Configuration</b></h4><pre>
       But sometimes that's not the case. Let's say that the "psql" client on your system is not  in  the  path,
       but  instead  in  <u>/usr/local/pgsql/bin/psql</u>.  You  could  set  its  location  right  here  in the project
       configuration file, but that won't do if you end up distributing the project to  other  users  who  might
       have their client somewhere else. For that use case, the default path-specific value is probably best.

       A  better  idea is to tell Sqitch where to find <u>psql</u> for <u>all</u> of your projects. Use the "config" command's
       "--user" option to set that configuration for yourself:

         &gt; sqitch config --user engine.pg.client /usr/local/pgsql/bin/psql

       This won't change the project configuration file at all, but  add  the  value  to  <u><a href="file:~/.sqitch/sqitch.conf">~/.sqitch/sqitch.conf</a></u>,
       which  is your personal cross-project Sqitch configuration. In other words, it sets the PostgreSQL client
       for all Sqitch projects you manage on this host. In fact, it can be a good idea to configure clients  not
       in the path first thing whenever you start working on a new host:

         &gt; sqitch config --user user.name 'Marge N. O’Vera'
         &gt; sqitch config --user user.email '<a href="mailto:marge@example.com">marge@example.com</a>'
         &gt; sqitch config --user engine.pg.client /usr/local/pgsql/bin/psql
         &gt; sqitch config --user engine.mysql.client /usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql
         &gt; sqitch config --user engine.sqlite.client /sbin/sqlite3

       If  you'd  like to make the configuration global to all accounts on your host, use the "--system" option,
       instead:

         &gt; sudo sqitch config --system engine.pg.client /usr/local/pgsql/bin/psql
         &gt; sudo sqitch config --system engine.mysql.client /usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql
         &gt; sudo sqitch config --system engine.sqlite.client /sbin/sqlite3

       That  will  put  the  values  into  the  global  Sqitch  configuration  file,  which   is   in   "`sqitch
       --etc-path`/sqitch.conf".

</pre><h4><b>Engine</b> <b>Configuration</b></h4><pre>
       So  you've  got  the  widgets  project  well  developed,  and now you've been asked to port it to SQLite.
       Fundamentally, that means porting all of your deploy, revert, and verify scripts.  The  simplest  way  to
       organize  files  for  this configuration is with top-level directories for each engine. First, let's move
       the existing PostgreSQL stuff to a subdirectory.

         &gt; mkdir pg
         &gt; mv deploy revert verify sqitch.plan pg
         &gt; ls  pg
         deploy/ revert/ sqitch.plan verify/

       Now we need to tell Sqitch where things are. To create an engine-specific configuration, use the "engine"
       command's "add" action:

         sqitch engine add pg --top-dir pg

       The "add" action adds the "pg" engine to the configuration, setting  the  top  directory  to  our  newly-
       created "pg" directory. The configuration looks like this (with comments removed for clarity):

         [core]
           engine = pg
         [engine "pg"]
           target = db:pg:
           top_dir = pg

       Curious about all the other settings for the engine? Let "sqitch engine show" show you:

         &gt; sqitch engine show pg
         * pg
             Target:        db:pg:
             Registry:      sqitch
             Client:        psql
             Top Directory: pg
             Plan File:     pg/sqitch.plan
             Extension:     sql
             Script Directories:
               Deploy:      pg/deploy
               Revert:      pg/revert
               Verify:      pg/verify
             Reworked Script Directories:
               Reworked:    pg
               Deploy:      pg/deploy
               Revert:      pg/revert
               Verify:      pg/verify
             No Variables

       The  "show"  action nicely presents the result of the fully-evaluated configuration, even though only the
       top directory and client have been set.  Nice, right?

       Now, to add the SQLite support. There are two basic ways to go  about  it.  We'll  start  with  the  more
       obvious one.

   <b>Separate</b> <b>Plans</b>
       The  first  approach  is  to create an entirely independent SQLite project with its own plan and scripts.
       This is <u>almost</u> like starting from scratch: just create a new directory and add the Sqitch engine using it
       for its top directory: add initialize it as a new Sqitch project:

         &gt; sqitch engine add sqlite --top-dir sqlite
         Created sqlite/
         Created sqlite/sqitch.plan
         Created sqlite/deploy/
         Created sqlite/revert/
         Created sqlite/verify/

       Note the creation of a new <u>sqlite/sqitch.conf</u> file. It will have copied the project name and URI from the
       existing plan file. The SQLite configuration is now added to the configuration file:

         &gt; sqitch engine show sqlite
         * sqlite
             Target:        db:sqlite:
             Registry:      sqitch
             Client:        sqlite3
             Top Directory: sqlite
             Plan File:     sqlite/sqitch.plan
             Extension:     sql
             Script Directories:
               Deploy:      sqlite/deploy
               Revert:      sqlite/revert
               Verify:      sqlite/verify
             Reworked Script Directories:
               Reworked:    sqlite
               Deploy:      sqlite/deploy
               Revert:      sqlite/revert
               Verify:      sqlite/verify
             No Variables

       Good, everything's in the right place. Start adding changes to the SQLite plan by passing the engine name
       to the "add" command:

         &gt; sqitch add users sqlite -m 'Creates users table.'
         Created sqlite/deploy/users.sql
         Created sqlite/revert/users.sql
         Created sqlite/verify/users.sql
         Added "users" to sqlite/sqitch.plan

       Pass "pg" when adding PostgreSQL changes, or omit it, in which case Sqitch will fall back on the  default
       engine,  defined  by the "core.engine" variable set when we created the PostgreSQL project. Want to add a
       change with the same name to both engines? Simply pass them both, or use the "--all" option:

         &gt; sqitch add users --all -m 'Creates users table.'
         Created pg/deploy/users.sql
         Created pg/revert/users.sql
         Created pg/test/users.sql
         Created pg/verify/users.sql
         Added "users" to pg/sqitch.plan
         Created sqlite/deploy/users.sql
         Created sqlite/revert/users.sql
         Created sqlite/test/users.sql
         Created sqlite/verify/users.sql
         Added "users" to sqlite/sqitch.plan

   <b>Shared</b> <b>Plan</b>
       The other approach is to have both the PostgreSQL and the SQLite projects share the same  plan.  In  that
       case, we should move the plan file out of the PostgreSQL directory:

         &gt; mv pg/sqitch.plan .
         &gt; sqitch engine alter pg --plan-file sqitch.plan
         &gt; sqitch engine show pg
         * pg
             Target:        db:pg:
             Registry:      sqitch
             Client:        psql
             Top Directory: pg
             Plan File:     sqitch.plan
             Extension:     sql
             Script Directories:
               Deploy:      pg/deploy
               Revert:      pg/revert
               Verify:      pg/verify
             Reworked Script Directories:
               Reworked:    pg
               Deploy:      pg/deploy
               Revert:      pg/revert
               Verify:      pg/verify
             No Variables

       Good,  it's  now  using  <u>./sqitch.plan</u>. Now let's start the SQLite project.  Since we're going to use the
       same plan, we'll need to port all the scripts from PostgreSQL. Let's just copy them, and  then  configure
       the SQLite engine to use the shared plan file:

         &gt; cp -rf pg sqlite
         &gt; sqitch engine add sqlite --plan-file sqitch.plan --top-dir sqlite
         &gt; sqitch engine show sqlite
         * sqlite
             Target:           db:sqlite:
             Registry:         sqitch
             Client:           sqlite3
             Top Directory:    sqlite
             Plan File:        sqitch.plan
             Extension:        sql
             Script Directories:
               Deploy:      sqlite/deploy
               Revert:      sqlite/revert
               Verify:      sqlite/verify
             Reworked Script Directories:
               Reworked:    sqlite
               Deploy:      sqlite/deploy
               Revert:      sqlite/revert
               Verify:      sqlite/verify
             No Variables

       Looks  good!  Now port all the scripts in the <u>sqlite</u> directory from PostgreSQL to SQLite and you're ready
       to go.

       Later, when you want to add a new change to both projects, just pass the  "--all"  option  to  the  "add"
       command:

         &gt; sqitch add users --all -n 'Creates users table.'
         Created pg/deploy/users.sql
         Created pg/revert/users.sql
         Created pg/verify/users.sql
         Created sqlite/deploy/users.sql
         Created sqlite/revert/users.sql
         Created sqlite/verify/users.sql
         Added "users" to sqitch.plan

       This option also works for the "tag", "rework", and "bundle" commands. If you know you always want to act
       on all plans, set the "all" configuration variable for each command:

         sqitch config --bool add.all 1
         sqitch config --bool tag.all 1
         sqitch config --bool rework.all 1
         sqitch config --bool bundle.all 1

   <b>Database</b> <b>Interactions</b>
       With  either of these two approaches, you can manage database interactions by passing an engine name or a
       database URI &lt;https://github.com/libwww-perl/uri-db&gt; to the database commands. For example, to deploy  to
       a PostgreSQL database to the default PostgreSQL database:

         sqitch deploy pg

       You  usually  won't  want  to  use the default database in production, though.  Here's how to deploy to a
       PostgreSQL database named "widgets" on host "db.example.com":

         sqitch deploy db:pg://db.example.com/widgets

       Sqitch is smart enough to pick out the proper engine from the URI. If  you  pass  a  "db:pg:"  URI,  rest
       assured  that  Sqitch  won't try to deploy the SQLite changes. Use a "db:sqlite:" URI to interact with an
       SQLite database:

         sqitch log db:sqlite:/var/db/widgets.db

       The commands that take engine and target URI arguments include:

       •   "status"

       •   "log"

       •   "deploy"

       •   "revert"

       •   "rebase"

       •   "checkout"

       •   "verify"

       •   "upgrade"

</pre><h4><b>Target</b> <b>Configuration</b></h4><pre>
       Great, now we can easily manage changes for multiple database engines. But what about multiple  databases
       for  the  same  engine?  For  example,  you  might  want  to  deploy  your  database  to  two  hosts in a
       primary/standby configuration. To make things as simple as possible for  your  IT  organization,  set  up
       named targets for those servers:

         &gt; sqitch target add prod-primary db:pg://<a href="mailto:sqitch@db1.example.com">sqitch@db1.example.com</a>/widgets
         &gt; sqitch target add prod-standby db:pg://<a href="mailto:sqitch@db2.example.com">sqitch@db2.example.com</a>/widgets

       Targets  inherit  configuration  from  engines,  based  on  the  engine  specified  in  the URI. Thus the
       configuration all comes together:

         &gt; sqitch target show prod-primary prod-standby
         * prod-primary
             URI:           db:pg://<a href="mailto:sqitch@db1.example.com">sqitch@db1.example.com</a>/widgets
             Registry:      sqitch
             Client:        psql
             Top Directory: pg
             Plan File:     sqitch.plan
             Extension:     sql
             Script Directories:
               Deploy:      pg/deploy
               Revert:      pg/revert
               Verify:      pg/verify
             Reworked Script Directories:
               Reworked:    pg
               Deploy:      pg/deploy
               Revert:      pg/revert
               Verify:      pg/verify
             No Variables
         * prod-standby
             URI:           db:pg://<a href="mailto:sqitch@db2.example.com">sqitch@db2.example.com</a>/widgets
             Registry:      sqitch
             Client:        psql
             Top Directory: pg
             Plan File:     sqitch.plan
             Extension:     sql
             Script Directories:
               Deploy:      pg/deploy
               Revert:      pg/revert
               Verify:      pg/verify
             Reworked Script Directories:
               Reworked:    pg
               Deploy:      pg/deploy
               Revert:      pg/revert
               Verify:      pg/verify
             No Variables

       Note the use of the shared plan and the <u>pg</u> directory for scripts. We can add  a  target  for  our  SQLite
       database, too. Maybe it's used for development?

         &gt; sqitch target add dev-sqlite db:sqlite:/var/db/widgets_dev.db
         &gt; sqitch target show dev-sqlite
         * dev-sqlite
             URI:           db:sqlite:/var/db/widgets_dev.db
             Registry:      sqitch
             Client:        sqlite3
             Top Directory: sqlite
             Plan File:     sqitch.plan
             Extension:     sql
             Script Directories:
               Deploy:      sqlite/deploy
               Revert:      sqlite/revert
               Verify:      sqlite/verify
             Reworked Script Directories:
               Reworked:    sqlite
               Deploy:      sqlite/deploy
               Revert:      sqlite/revert
               Verify:      sqlite/verify
             No Variables

       Now  deploying  any  of  these  databases  is  as simple as specifying the target name when executing the
       "deploy" command (assuming the  "sqitch"  user  is  configured  to  authenticate  to  PostgreSQL  without
       prompting for a password):

         &gt; sqitch deploy prod-primary
         &gt; sqitch deploy prod-standby

       Want them all? Just query the targets and pass each in turn:

         for target in `sqitch target | grep prod-`; do
             sqitch deploy $target
         done

       The  commands that accept a target name are identical to those that take an engine name or target URI, as
       described in "Database Interactions".

   <b>Different</b> <b>Target,</b> <b>Different</b> <b>Plan</b>
       What about a project that manages different -- but related -- schemas on the same  engine?  For  example,
       say  you have two plans for PostgreSQL, one for a canonical data store, and one for a read-only copy that
       will have a subset of data replicated to it. Maybe your billing database just needs an up-to-date copy of
       the "customers" and "users" tables.

       Targets can help us here, too. Just create the new plan file. It  might  use  some  of  the  same  change
       scripts  as  the canonical plan, or its own scripts, or some of each. Just be sure all of its scripts are
       in the same top directory.  Then add targets for the specific servers and plans:

         &gt; sqitch target add prod-primary db:pg://db1.example.com/widgets
         &gt; sqitch target add prod-billing db:pg://cpa.example.com/billing --plan-file target.plan
         &gt; sqitch target show prod-billing
         * prod-billing
             URI:           db:pg://cpa.example.com/billing
             Registry:      sqitch
             Client:        psql
             Top Directory: pg
             Plan File:     target.plan
             Extension:     sql
             Script Directories:
               Deploy:      pg/deploy
               Revert:      pg/revert
               Verify:      pg/verify
             Reworked Script Directories:
               Reworked:    pg
               Deploy:      pg/deploy
               Revert:      pg/revert
               Verify:      pg/verify
             No Variables

       Now, any management of the "prod-billing" target will use the <u>target.plan</u> plan file. Want to add  changes
       to that plan? specify the plan file. Here's an example that re-uses the existing change scripts:

         &gt; sqitch add users target.plan -n 'Creates users table.'
         Skipped pg/deploy/users.sql: already exists
         Skipped pg/revert/users.sql: already exists
         Skipped pg/test/users.sql: already exists
         Skipped pg/verify/users.sql: already exists
         Added "users" to target.plan

</pre><h4><b>Overworked</b></h4><pre>
       Say  you've  been  working  on  your  project  for  some  time, and now you have a slew of changes you've
       reworked. (You really only do that with procedures and views,  right?  Because  it's  silly  to  use  for
       "ALTER"  statements;  just  add new changes in those cases.) As a result, your deploy, revert, and verify
       directories are full of files representing older versions of the changes, all containing the "@"  symbol,
       and  they're  starting to get in the way (in general you'll never modify them). Here's an example adapted
       from a real project:

       Ugh. Wouldn't it be nice to move them out of the way? Of course it would! So let's do that. We  want  all
       of  the  PostgreSQL engine's reworked scripts all to go into to a new directory named "reworked", so tell
       Sqitch where to find them:

         &gt; sqitch engine alter pg --dir reworked=pg/reworked
         Created pg/reworked/deploy/
         Created pg/reworked/revert/
         Created pg/reworked/verify/

       Great, it created the new directories. Note that if you wanted the directories to have different names or
       locations, you can use the "reworked_deploy", "reworked_revert", and "reworked_verify" options.

       Now all we have to do is move the files:

         cd pg
         for file in `find . -name '*@*'`
         do
             mkdir -p reworked/`dirname $file`
             mv $file reworked/`dirname $file`
         done
         cd ..

       Now all the  reworked  deploy  files  are  in  <u>pg/reworked/deploy</u>,  the  reworked  revert  files  are  in
       <u>pg/reworked/revert</u>,  and the reworked verify files are in <u>pg/reworked/verify</u>. And you're good to go! From
       here on in Sqitch always knows to find the reworked scripts when doing a deploy, revert, or  bundle.  And
       meanwhile, they're tucked out of the way, less likely to break your brain or your IDE.

</pre><h4><b>Other</b> <b>Options</b></h4><pre>
       You can see by the output of the "init", "engine", and "target" commands that there are quite a few other
       properties that can be set on a per-engine or per-target database. To determine the value of each, Sqitch
       looks  at  a  combination  of  command-line  options and configuration variables. Here's a complete list,
       including specification of their values and how to set them.

       "target"
           The target database. May be a database URI &lt;https://github.com/libwww-perl/uri-db&gt; or a named  target
           managed  by the "target" commands. On each run, its value will be determined by examining each of the
           following in turn:

           Command target argument or option
                 sqitch deploy $target
                 sqitch revert --target $target

           $SQITCH_TARGET environment variable
                 env SQITCH_TARGET=$target sqitch deploy
                 env SQITCH_TARGET=$target sqitch revert

           "engine.$engine.target"
                 sqitch init $project --engine $engine --target $target
                 sqitch engine add $engine --target $target
                 sqitch engine alter $engine --target target

           "core.target"
                 sqitch config core.target $target

       "uri"
           The database URI &lt;https://github.com/libwww-perl/uri-db&gt; to which to connect. May only  be  specified
           as a target argument or via a named target:

           Command target argument or option
                 sqitch deploy $uri
                 sqitch revert --target $uri

           $SQITCH_TARGET environment variable
                 env SQITCH_TARGET=$uri sqitch deploy
                 env SQITCH_TARGET=$uri sqitch revert

           "target.$target.uri"
                 sqitch init $project --engine $engine --target $uri
                 sqitch target add $target --uri $uri
                 sqitch target alter $target --uri $uri

       "client"
           The  path to the engine client. The default is engine- and OS-specific, which will generally work for
           clients in the path. If you need a custom client, you can specify it via the following:

           "--client"
                 sqitch deploy --client $client

           "target.$target.client"
                 sqitch target add $target --client $client
                 sqitch target alter $target --client $client
                 sqitch config --user target.$target.client $client

           "engine.$engine.client"
                 sqitch init $project --engine $engine --client client
                 sqitch engine add $engine --client $client
                 sqitch engine alter $engine --client $client
                 sqitch config --user engine.$engine.client $client

           "core.client"
                 sqitch config core.client $client
                 sqitch config --user core.client $client

       "registry"
           The name of the Sqitch registry schema or database. The default is "sqitch", which  should  work  for
           most uses. If you need a custom registry, specify it via the following:

           "--registry"
                 sqitch deploy --registry $registry

           "target.$target.registry"
                 sqitch target add $target --registry $registry
                 sqitch target alter $target --registry $registry

           "engine.$engine.registry"
                 sqitch init $project --engine $engine --registry $registry
                 sqitch engine add $engine --registry $registry
                 sqitch engine alter $engine --registry $registry

           "core.registry"
                 sqitch config core.registry $registry

       "top_dir"
           The  directory  in  which  project  files an subdirectories can be found, including the plan file and
           script directories. The default is the current directory. If you need a custom directory, specify  it
           via the following:

           "target.$target.top_dir"
                 sqitch target add $target --top-dir $top_dir
                 sqitch target alter $target --top-dir $top_dir

           "engine.$engine.top_dir"
                 sqitch engine add $engine --top-dir $top_dir
                 sqitch engine alter $engine --top-dir $top_dir

           "core.top_dir"
                 sqitch init $project --top-dir $top_dir
                 sqitch config core.top_dir $top_dir

       "plan_file"
           The  project deployment plan file, which defaults to <u>"$top_dir/sqitch.plan"</u>.  If you need a different
           file, specify it via the following:

           "--plan-file"
           "-f"
                 sqitch $command --plan-file $plan_file

           "target.$target.plan_file"
                 sqitch target add $target --plan-file $plan_file
                 sqitch target alter $target --plan-file $plan_file

           "engine.$engine.plan_file"
                 sqitch engine add $engine --plan-file $plan_file
                 sqitch engine alter $engine --plan-file $plan_file

           "core.plan_file"
                 sqitch init $project --plan-file $plan_file
                 sqitch config core.plan_file $plan_file

       "extension"
           The file name extension to append to change names for change script file names. Defaults to "sql". If
           you need a custom extension, specify it via the following:

           "target.$target.extension"
                 sqitch target add $target --extension $extension
                 sqitch target alter $target --extension $extension

           "engine.$engine.extension"
                 sqitch engine add $engine --extension $extension
                 sqitch engine alter $engine --extension $extension

           "core.extension"
                 sqitch init $project --extension $extension
                 sqitch config core.extension $extension

       "variables"
           Database client variables. Useful if your database engine supports  variables  in  scripts,  such  as
           PostgreSQL's "psql" variables &lt;https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/app-psql.html#APP-PSQL-
           INTERPOLATION&gt;,                     Vertica's                     "vsql"                    variables
           &lt;https://my.vertica.com/docs/7.1.x/HTML/index.htm#Authoring/ConnectingToHPVertica/vsql/Variables.htm&gt;
           MySQL's  user  variables  &lt;https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/user-variables.html&gt;,   SQL*Plus's
           "DEFINE"    variables    &lt;https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B19306_01/server.102/b14357/ch12017.htm&gt;,    and
           Snowflake's   SnowSQL   variables   &lt;https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/snowsql-use.html#using-
           variables&gt;.  To set variables, specify them via the following:

           Command variable option
                 sqitch deploy --set $key=$val -s $key2=$val2
                 sqitch revert --set $key=$val -s $key2=$val2
                 sqitch verify --set $key=$val -s $key2=$val2

           "target.$target.variables"
                 sqitch target add $target --set $key=$val -s $key2=$val2

                 sqitch config revert.variables.$key $val
                 sqitch config verify.variables.$key $val

           "core.variables"
                 sqitch init $project --set $key=$val -s $key2=$val2
                 sqitch config core.variables.$key $val
                 sqitch config core.variables.$key2 $val2

       "deploy_dir"
           The  directory  in  which  project deploy scripts can be found. Defaults to <u>"$top_dir/deploy"</u>. If you
           need a different directory, specify it via the following:

           "target.$target.deploy_dir"
                 sqitch target add $target --dir deploy=$deploy_dir
                 sqitch target alter $target --dir deploy=$deploy_dir

           "engine.$engine.deploy_dir"
                 sqitch engine add $engine --dir deploy=$deploy_dir
                 sqitch engine alter --dir deploy=$deploy_dir

           "core.deploy_dir"
                 sqitch init $project --dir deploy=$deploy_dir
                 sqitch config core.deploy_dir $deploy_dir

       "revert_dir"
       <u>"$top_dir/deploy"</u>
           The directory in which project revert scripts can be found. Defaults  to  <u>"$top_dir/revert"</u>.  If  you
           need a different directory, specify it via the following:

           "target.$target.revert_dir"
                 sqitch target add $target --dir revert=$revert_dir
                 sqitch target alter $target --dir revert=$revert_dir

           "engine.$engine.revert_dir"
                 sqitch engine add $engine --dir revert=$revert_dir
                 sqitch engine alter --dir revert=$revert_dir

           "core.revert_dir"
                 sqitch init $project --dir revert=$revert_dir
                 sqitch config core.revert_dir $revert_dir

       "verify_dir"
