</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Config::Model::models::Systemd::Section::Service - Configuration class Systemd::Section::Service

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Configuration classes used by Config::Model

       A unit configuration file whose name ends in ".service" encodes information about a process controlled
       and supervised by systemd.

       This man page lists the configuration options specific to this unit type. See <b><a href="../man5/systemd.unit.5.html">systemd.unit</a></b>(5) for the
       common options of all unit configuration files. The common configuration items are configured in the
       generic [Unit] and [Install] sections. The service specific configuration options are configured in the
       [Service] section.

       Additional options are listed in <b><a href="../man5/systemd.exec.5.html">systemd.exec</a></b>(5), which define the execution environment the commands are
       executed in, and in <b><a href="../man5/systemd.kill.5.html">systemd.kill</a></b>(5), which define the way the processes of the service are terminated,
       and in <b><a href="../man5/systemd.resource-control.5.html">systemd.resource-control</a></b>(5), which configure resource control settings for the processes of the
       service.

       If SysV init compat is enabled, systemd automatically creates service units that wrap SysV init scripts
       (the service name is the same as the name of the script, with a ".service" suffix added); see
       <b><a href="../man8/systemd-sysv-generator.8.html">systemd-sysv-generator</a></b>(8).

       The <b><a href="../man1/systemd-run.1.html">systemd-run</a></b>(1) command allows creating ".service" and ".scope" units dynamically and transiently from
       the command line.  This configuration class was generated from systemd documentation.  by parse-man.pl

</pre><h4><b>Elements</b></h4><pre>
   <b>CPUAccounting</b>
       Turn on CPU usage accounting for this unit. Takes a boolean argument. Note that turning on CPU accounting
       for one unit will also implicitly turn it on for all units contained in the same slice and for all its
       parent slices and the units contained therein. The system default for this setting may be controlled with
       "DefaultCPUAccounting" in <b><a href="../man5/systemd-system.conf.5.html">systemd-system.conf</a></b>(5).

       Under the unified cgroup hierarchy, CPU accounting is available for all units and this setting has no
       effect.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>boolean.</u>

   <b>CPUWeight</b>
       These settings control the "cpu" controller in the unified hierarchy.

       These options accept an integer value or the special string "idle":

       While "StartupCPUWeight" applies to the startup and shutdown phases of the system, "CPUWeight" applies to
       normal runtime of the system, and if the former is not set also to the startup and shutdown phases. Using
       "StartupCPUWeight" allows prioritizing specific services at boot-up and shutdown differently than during
       normal runtime.

       In addition to the resource allocation performed by the "cpu" controller, the kernel may automatically
       divide resources based on session-id grouping, see "The autogroup feature" in <b><a href="../man7/sched.7.html">sched</a></b>(7).  The effect of
       this feature is similar to the "cpu" controller with no explicit configuration, so users should be
       careful to not mistake one for the other.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>StartupCPUWeight</b>
       These settings control the "cpu" controller in the unified hierarchy.

       These options accept an integer value or the special string "idle":

       While "StartupCPUWeight" applies to the startup and shutdown phases of the system, "CPUWeight" applies to
       normal runtime of the system, and if the former is not set also to the startup and shutdown phases. Using
       "StartupCPUWeight" allows prioritizing specific services at boot-up and shutdown differently than during
       normal runtime.

       In addition to the resource allocation performed by the "cpu" controller, the kernel may automatically
       divide resources based on session-id grouping, see "The autogroup feature" in <b><a href="../man7/sched.7.html">sched</a></b>(7).  The effect of
       this feature is similar to the "cpu" controller with no explicit configuration, so users should be
       careful to not mistake one for the other.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>CPUQuota</b>
       This setting controls the "cpu" controller in the unified hierarchy.

       Assign the specified CPU time quota to the processes executed. Takes a percentage value, suffixed with
       "%". The percentage specifies how much CPU time the unit shall get at maximum, relative to the total CPU
       time available on one CPU. Use values &gt; 100% for allotting CPU time on more than one CPU. This controls
       the "cpu.max" attribute on the unified control group hierarchy and "cpu.cfs_quota_us" on legacy. For
       details about these control group attributes, see Control Groups v2 &lt;https://docs.kernel.org/admin-
       guide/cgroup-v2.html&gt; and CFS Bandwidth Control &lt;https://docs.kernel.org/scheduler/sched-bwc.html&gt;.
       Setting "CPUQuota" to an empty value unsets the quota.

       Example: "CPUQuota=20%" ensures that the executed processes will never get more than 20% CPU time on one
       CPU.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>CPUQuotaPeriodSec</b>
       This setting controls the "cpu" controller in the unified hierarchy.

       Assign the duration over which the CPU time quota specified by "CPUQuota" is measured.  Takes a time
       duration value in seconds, with an optional suffix such as "ms" for milliseconds (or "s" for seconds.)
       The default setting is 100ms. The period is clamped to the range supported by the kernel, which is [1ms,
       1000ms].  Additionally, the period is adjusted up so that the quota interval is also at least 1ms.
       Setting "CPUQuotaPeriodSec" to an empty value resets it to the default.

       This controls the second field of "cpu.max" attribute on the unified control group hierarchy and
       "cpu.cfs_period_us" on legacy. For details about these control group attributes, see Control Groups v2
       &lt;https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/cgroup-v2.html&gt; and CFS Scheduler
       &lt;https://docs.kernel.org/scheduler/sched-design-CFS.html&gt;.

       Example: "CPUQuotaPeriodSec=10ms" to request that the CPU quota is measured in periods of 10ms.
       <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>AllowedCPUs</b>
       This setting controls the "cpuset" controller in the unified hierarchy.

       Restrict processes to be executed on specific CPUs. Takes a list of CPU indices or ranges separated by
       either whitespace or commas. CPU ranges are specified by the lower and upper CPU indices separated by a
       dash.

       Setting "AllowedCPUs" or "StartupAllowedCPUs" doesn't guarantee that all of the CPUs will be used by the
       processes as it may be limited by parent units. The effective configuration is reported as
       "EffectiveCPUs".

       While "StartupAllowedCPUs" applies to the startup and shutdown phases of the system, "AllowedCPUs"
       applies to normal runtime of the system, and if the former is not set also to the startup and shutdown
       phases. Using "StartupAllowedCPUs" allows prioritizing specific services at boot-up and shutdown
       differently than during normal runtime.

       This setting is supported only with the unified control group hierarchy.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>StartupAllowedCPUs</b>
       This setting controls the "cpuset" controller in the unified hierarchy.

       Restrict processes to be executed on specific CPUs. Takes a list of CPU indices or ranges separated by
       either whitespace or commas. CPU ranges are specified by the lower and upper CPU indices separated by a
       dash.

       Setting "AllowedCPUs" or "StartupAllowedCPUs" doesn't guarantee that all of the CPUs will be used by the
       processes as it may be limited by parent units. The effective configuration is reported as
       "EffectiveCPUs".

       While "StartupAllowedCPUs" applies to the startup and shutdown phases of the system, "AllowedCPUs"
       applies to normal runtime of the system, and if the former is not set also to the startup and shutdown
       phases. Using "StartupAllowedCPUs" allows prioritizing specific services at boot-up and shutdown
       differently than during normal runtime.

       This setting is supported only with the unified control group hierarchy.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>MemoryAccounting</b>
       This setting controls the "memory" controller in the unified hierarchy.

       Turn on process and kernel memory accounting for this unit. Takes a boolean argument. Note that turning
       on memory accounting for one unit will also implicitly turn it on for all units contained in the same
       slice and for all its parent slices and the units contained therein. The system default for this setting
       may be controlled with "DefaultMemoryAccounting" in <b><a href="../man5/systemd-system.conf.5.html">systemd-system.conf</a></b>(5).  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>boolean.</u>

   <b>MemoryMin</b>
       These settings control the "memory" controller in the unified hierarchy.

       Specify the memory usage protection of the executed processes in this unit.  When reclaiming memory, the
       unit is treated as if it was using less memory resulting in memory to be preferentially reclaimed from
       unprotected units.  Using "MemoryLow" results in a weaker protection where memory may still be reclaimed
       to avoid invoking the OOM killer in case there is no other reclaimable memory.

       For a protection to be effective, it is generally required to set a corresponding allocation on all
       ancestors, which is then distributed between children (with the exception of the root slice).  Any
       "MemoryMin" or "MemoryLow" allocation that is not explicitly distributed to specific children is used to
       create a shared protection for all children.  As this is a shared protection, the children will freely
       compete for the memory.

       Takes a memory size in bytes. If the value is suffixed with K, M, G or T, the specified memory size is
       parsed as Kilobytes, Megabytes, Gigabytes, or Terabytes (with the base 1024), respectively.
       Alternatively, a percentage value may be specified, which is taken relative to the installed physical
       memory on the system. If assigned the special value "infinity", all available memory is protected, which
       may be useful in order to always inherit all of the protection afforded by ancestors.  This controls the
       "memory.min" or "memory.low" control group attribute.  For details about this control group attribute,
       see Memory Interface Files &lt;https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/cgroup-v2.html#memory-interface-files&gt;.

       Units may have their children use a default "memory.min" or "memory.low" value by specifying
       "DefaultMemoryMin" or "DefaultMemoryLow", which has the same semantics as "MemoryMin" and "MemoryLow", or
       "DefaultStartupMemoryLow" which has the same semantics as "StartupMemoryLow".  This setting does not
       affect "memory.min" or "memory.low" in the unit itself.  Using it to set a default child allocation is
       only useful on kernels older than 5.7, which do not support the "memory_recursiveprot" cgroup2 mount
       option.

       While "StartupMemoryLow" applies to the startup and shutdown phases of the system, "MemoryMin" applies to
       normal runtime of the system, and if the former is not set also to the startup and shutdown phases. Using
       "StartupMemoryLow" allows prioritizing specific services at boot-up and shutdown differently than during
       normal runtime.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>StartupMemoryLow</b>
       These settings control the "memory" controller in the unified hierarchy.

       Specify the memory usage protection of the executed processes in this unit.  When reclaiming memory, the
       unit is treated as if it was using less memory resulting in memory to be preferentially reclaimed from
       unprotected units.  Using "MemoryLow" results in a weaker protection where memory may still be reclaimed
       to avoid invoking the OOM killer in case there is no other reclaimable memory.

       ancestors, which is then distributed between children (with the exception of the root slice).  Any
       "MemoryMin" or "MemoryLow" allocation that is not explicitly distributed to specific children is used to
       create a shared protection for all children.  As this is a shared protection, the children will freely
       compete for the memory.

       Takes a memory size in bytes. If the value is suffixed with K, M, G or T, the specified memory size is
       parsed as Kilobytes, Megabytes, Gigabytes, or Terabytes (with the base 1024), respectively.
       Alternatively, a percentage value may be specified, which is taken relative to the installed physical
       memory on the system. If assigned the special value "infinity", all available memory is protected, which
       may be useful in order to always inherit all of the protection afforded by ancestors.  This controls the
       "memory.min" or "memory.low" control group attribute.  For details about this control group attribute,
       see Memory Interface Files &lt;https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/cgroup-v2.html#memory-interface-files&gt;.

       Units may have their children use a default "memory.min" or "memory.low" value by specifying
       "DefaultMemoryMin" or "DefaultMemoryLow", which has the same semantics as "MemoryMin" and "MemoryLow", or
       "DefaultStartupMemoryLow" which has the same semantics as "StartupMemoryLow".  This setting does not
       affect "memory.min" or "memory.low" in the unit itself.  Using it to set a default child allocation is
       only useful on kernels older than 5.7, which do not support the "memory_recursiveprot" cgroup2 mount
       option.

       While "StartupMemoryLow" applies to the startup and shutdown phases of the system, "MemoryMin" applies to
       normal runtime of the system, and if the former is not set also to the startup and shutdown phases. Using
       "StartupMemoryLow" allows prioritizing specific services at boot-up and shutdown differently than during
       normal runtime.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>MemoryHigh</b>
       These settings control the "memory" controller in the unified hierarchy.

       Specify the throttling limit on memory usage of the executed processes in this unit. Memory usage may go
       above the limit if unavoidable, but the processes are heavily slowed down and memory is taken away
       aggressively in such cases. This is the main mechanism to control memory usage of a unit.

       Takes a memory size in bytes. If the value is suffixed with K, M, G or T, the specified memory size is
       parsed as Kilobytes, Megabytes, Gigabytes, or Terabytes (with the base 1024), respectively.
       Alternatively, a percentage value may be specified, which is taken relative to the installed physical
       memory on the system. If assigned the special value "infinity", no memory throttling is applied. This
       controls the "memory.high" control group attribute. For details about this control group attribute, see
       Memory Interface Files &lt;https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/cgroup-v2.html#memory-interface-files&gt;.  The
       effective configuration is reported as "EffectiveMemoryHigh" (see also "EffectiveMemoryMax").

       While "StartupMemoryHigh" applies to the startup and shutdown phases of the system, "MemoryHigh" applies
       to normal runtime of the system, and if the former is not set also to the startup and shutdown phases.
       Using "StartupMemoryHigh" allows prioritizing specific services at boot-up and shutdown differently than
       during normal runtime.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>StartupMemoryHigh</b>

   <b>MemoryMax</b>
       These settings control the "memory" controller in the unified hierarchy.

       Specify the absolute limit on memory usage of the executed processes in this unit. If memory usage cannot
       be contained under the limit, out-of-memory killer is invoked inside the unit. It is recommended to use
       "MemoryHigh" as the main control mechanism and use "MemoryMax" as the last line of defense.

       Takes a memory size in bytes. If the value is suffixed with K, M, G or T, the specified memory size is
       parsed as Kilobytes, Megabytes, Gigabytes, or Terabytes (with the base 1024), respectively.
       Alternatively, a percentage value may be specified, which is taken relative to the installed physical
       memory on the system. If assigned the special value "infinity", no memory limit is applied. This controls
       the "memory.max" control group attribute. For details about this control group attribute, see Memory
       Interface Files &lt;https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/cgroup-v2.html#memory-interface-files&gt;.  The
       effective configuration is reported as "EffectiveMemoryMax" (the value is the most stringent limit of the
       unit and parent slices and it is capped by physical memory).

       While "StartupMemoryMax" applies to the startup and shutdown phases of the system, "MemoryMax" applies to
       normal runtime of the system, and if the former is not set also to the startup and shutdown phases. Using
       "StartupMemoryMax" allows prioritizing specific services at boot-up and shutdown differently than during

   <b>MemorySwapMax</b>
       These settings control the "memory" controller in the unified hierarchy.

       Specify the absolute limit on swap usage of the executed processes in this unit.

       Takes a swap size in bytes. If the value is suffixed with K, M, G or T, the specified swap size is parsed
       as Kilobytes, Megabytes, Gigabytes, or Terabytes (with the base 1024), respectively. Alternatively, a
       percentage value may be specified, which is taken relative to the specified swap size on the system. If

   <b>MemoryZSwapMax</b>
       These settings control the "memory" controller in the unified hierarchy.

       Specify the absolute limit on zswap usage of the processes in this unit. Zswap is a lightweight
       compressed cache for swap pages. It takes pages that are in the process of being swapped out and attempts
       to compress them into a dynamically allocated RAM-based memory pool. If the limit specified is hit, no
       entries from this unit will be stored in the pool until existing entries are faulted back or written out

       &lt;https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/cgroup-v2.html#memory-interface-files&gt;.

       While "StartupMemoryZSwapMax" applies to the startup and shutdown phases of the system, "MemoryZSwapMax"
       applies to normal runtime of the system, and if the former is not set also to the startup and shutdown
       phases. Using "StartupMemoryZSwapMax" allows prioritizing specific services at boot-up and shutdown
       differently than during normal runtime.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>MemoryZSwapWriteback</b>
       This setting controls the "memory" controller in the unified hierarchy.

       Takes a boolean argument. When true, pages stored in the Zswap cache are permitted to be written to the
       backing storage, false otherwise. Defaults to true. This allows disabling writeback of swap pages for IO-
       intensive applications, while retaining the ability to store compressed pages in Zswap. See the kernel's
       Zswap &lt;https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/mm/zswap.html&gt; documentation for more details.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u>
       <u>boolean.</u>

   <b>AllowedMemoryNodes</b>
       These settings control the "cpuset" controller in the unified hierarchy.

       Restrict processes to be executed on specific memory NUMA nodes. Takes a list of memory NUMA nodes
       indices or ranges separated by either whitespace or commas. Memory NUMA nodes ranges are specified by the
       lower and upper NUMA nodes indices separated by a dash.

       Setting "AllowedMemoryNodes" or "StartupAllowedMemoryNodes" doesn't guarantee that all of the memory NUMA
       nodes will be used by the processes as it may be limited by parent units.  The effective configuration is
       reported as "EffectiveMemoryNodes".

       While "StartupAllowedMemoryNodes" applies to the startup and shutdown phases of the system,
       "AllowedMemoryNodes" applies to normal runtime of the system, and if the former is not set also to the
       startup and shutdown phases. Using "StartupAllowedMemoryNodes" allows prioritizing specific services at
       boot-up and shutdown differently than during normal runtime.

       This setting is supported only with the unified control group hierarchy.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>StartupAllowedMemoryNodes</b>
       These settings control the "cpuset" controller in the unified hierarchy.

   <b>TasksAccounting</b>
       This setting controls the "pids" controller in the unified hierarchy.

       Turn on task accounting for this unit. Takes a boolean argument. If enabled, the kernel will keep track
       of the total number of tasks in the unit and its children. This number includes both kernel threads and
       userspace processes, with each thread counted individually. Note that turning on tasks accounting for one
       unit will also implicitly turn it on for all units contained in the same slice and for all its parent
       slices and the units contained therein. The system default for this setting may be controlled with
       "DefaultTasksAccounting" in <b><a href="../man5/systemd-system.conf.5.html">systemd-system.conf</a></b>(5).  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>boolean.</u>

   <b>TasksMax</b>
       This setting controls the "pids" controller in the unified hierarchy.

       Specify the maximum number of tasks that may be created in the unit. This ensures that the number of
       tasks accounted for the unit (see above) stays below a specific limit. This either takes an absolute
       number of tasks or a percentage value that is taken relative to the configured maximum number of tasks on
       the system. If assigned the special value "infinity", no tasks limit is applied. This controls the
       "pids.max" control group attribute. For details about this control group attribute, the pids controller
       &lt;https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/cgroup-v2.html#pid&gt;.  The effective configuration is reported as

       <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>IOAccounting</b>
       This setting controls the "io" controller in the unified hierarchy.

       Turn on Block I/O accounting for this unit, if the unified control group hierarchy is used on the system.
       Takes a boolean argument. Note that turning on block I/O accounting for one unit will also implicitly
       turn it on for all units contained in the same slice and all for its parent slices and the units
       contained therein. The system default for this setting may be controlled with "DefaultIOAccounting" in
       <b><a href="../man5/systemd-system.conf.5.html">systemd-system.conf</a></b>(5).  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>boolean.</u>

   <b>IOWeight</b>
       These settings control the "io" controller in the unified hierarchy.

       Set the default overall block I/O weight for the executed processes, if the unified control group
       hierarchy is used on the system. Takes a single weight value (between 1 and 10000) to set the default
       block I/O weight. This controls the "io.weight" control group attribute, which defaults to 100. For
       details about this control group attribute, see IO Interface Files &lt;https://docs.kernel.org/admin-
       guide/cgroup-v2.html#io-interface-files&gt;.  The available I/O bandwidth is split up among all units within
       one slice relative to their block I/O weight. A higher weight means more I/O bandwidth, a lower weight
       means less.

       While "StartupIOWeight" applies to the startup and shutdown phases of the system, "IOWeight" applies to
       the later runtime of the system, and if the former is not set also to the startup and shutdown phases.
       This allows prioritizing specific services at boot-up and shutdown differently than during runtime.

       These settings control the "io" controller in the unified hierarchy.

       Set the default overall block I/O weight for the executed processes, if the unified control group
       hierarchy is used on the system. Takes a single weight value (between 1 and 10000) to set the default
       block I/O weight. This controls the "io.weight" control group attribute, which defaults to 100. For

   <b>IODeviceWeight</b>
       This setting controls the "io" controller in the unified hierarchy.

       Set the per-device overall block I/O weight for the executed processes, if the unified control group
       hierarchy is used on the system. Takes a space-separated pair of a file path and a weight value to
       specify the device specific weight value, between 1 and 10000. (Example: "/dev/sda 1000"). The file path
       may be specified as path to a block device node or as any other file, in which case the backing block
       device of the file system of the file is determined. This controls the "io.weight" control group
       attribute, which defaults to 100. Use this option multiple times to set weights for multiple devices.
       For details about this control group attribute, see IO Interface Files &lt;https://docs.kernel.org/admin-
       guide/cgroup-v2.html#io-interface-files&gt;.

       The specified device node should reference a block device that has an I/O scheduler associated, i.e.
       should not refer to partition or loopback block devices, but to the originating, physical device. When a
       path to a regular file or directory is specified it is attempted to discover the correct originating
       device backing the file system of the specified path. This works correctly only for simpler cases, where
       the file system is directly placed on a partition or physical block device, or where simple 1:1
       encryption using dm-crypt/LUKS is used. This discovery does not cover complex storage and in particular
       RAID and volume management storage devices.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>IOReadBandwidthMax</b>
       These settings control the "io" controller in the unified hierarchy.

       Set the per-device overall block I/O bandwidth maximum limit for the executed processes, if the unified
       control group hierarchy is used on the system. This limit is not work-conserving and the executed
       processes are not allowed to use more even if the device has idle capacity.  Takes a space-separated pair
       of a file path and a bandwidth value (in bytes per second) to specify the device specific bandwidth. The
       file path may be a path to a block device node, or as any other file in which case the backing block
       device of the file system of the file is used. If the bandwidth is suffixed with K, M, G, or T, the
       specified bandwidth is parsed as Kilobytes, Megabytes, Gigabytes, or Terabytes, respectively, to the base
       of 1000. (Example: "/dev/disk/by-path/pci-0000:00:1f.2-scsi-0:0:0:0 5M"). This controls the "io.max"
       control group attributes. Use this option multiple times to set bandwidth limits for multiple devices.

   <b>IOReadIOPSMax</b>
       These settings control the "io" controller in the unified hierarchy.

       Set the per-device overall block I/O IOs-Per-Second maximum limit for the executed processes, if the
       unified control group hierarchy is used on the system. This limit is not work-conserving and the executed
       processes are not allowed to use more even if the device has idle capacity.  Takes a space-separated pair
       of a file path and an IOPS value to specify the device specific IOPS. The file path may be a path to a
       block device node, or as any other file in which case the backing block device of the file system of the
       file is used. If the IOPS is suffixed with K, M, G, or T, the specified IOPS is parsed as KiloIOPS,
       MegaIOPS, GigaIOPS, or TeraIOPS, respectively, to the base of 1000. (Example:
       "/dev/disk/by-path/pci-0000:00:1f.2-scsi-0:0:0:0 1K"). This controls the "io.max" control group

   <b>IODeviceLatencyTargetSec</b>
       This setting controls the "io" controller in the unified hierarchy.

       Set the per-device average target I/O latency for the executed processes, if the unified control group
       hierarchy is used on the system. Takes a file path and a timespan separated by a space to specify the
       device specific latency target. (Example: "/dev/sda 25ms"). The file path may be specified as path to a
       block device node or as any other file, in which case the backing block device of the file system of the

   <b>IPAccounting</b>
       Takes a boolean argument. If true, turns on IPv4 and IPv6 network traffic accounting for packets sent or
       received by the unit. When this option is turned on, all IPv4 and IPv6 sockets created by any process of
       the unit are accounted for.

       When this option is used in socket units, it applies to all IPv4 and IPv6 sockets associated with it
       (including both listening and connection sockets where this applies). Note that for socket-activated
       services, this configuration setting and the accounting data of the service unit and the socket unit are
       kept separate, and displayed separately. No propagation of the setting and the collected statistics is
       done, in either direction. Moreover, any traffic sent or received on any of the socket unit's sockets is
       accounted to the socket unit — and never to the service unit it might have activated, even if the socket
       is used by it.

       The system default for this setting may be controlled with "DefaultIPAccounting" in
       <b><a href="../man5/systemd-system.conf.5.html">systemd-system.conf</a></b>(5).

       Note that this functionality is currently only available for system services, not for per-user services.
       <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>boolean.</u>

   <b>IPAddressAllow</b>
       Turn on network traffic filtering for IP packets sent and received over "AF_INET" and "AF_INET6" sockets.
       Both directives take a space separated list of IPv4 or IPv6 addresses, each optionally suffixed with an
       address prefix length in bits after a "/" character. If the suffix is omitted, the address is considered
       a host address, i.e. the filter covers the whole address (32 bits for IPv4, 128 bits for IPv6).

       The access lists configured with this option are applied to all sockets created by processes of this unit
       (or in the case of socket units, associated with it). The lists are implicitly combined with any lists
       configured for any of the parent slice units this unit might be a member of. By default both access lists
       are empty. Both ingress and egress traffic is filtered by these settings. In case of ingress traffic the
       source IP address is checked against these access lists, in case of egress traffic the destination IP
       address is checked. The following rules are applied in turn:

       In order to implement an allow-listing IP firewall, it is recommended to use a "IPAddressDeny"="any"
       setting on an upper-level slice unit (such as the root slice "-.slice" or the slice containing all system
       services "system.slice" – see <b><a href="../man7/systemd.special.7.html">systemd.special</a></b>(7) for details on these slice units), plus individual per-
       service "IPAddressAllow" lines permitting network access to relevant services, and only them.

       Note that for socket-activated services, the IP access list configured on the socket unit applies to all
       sockets associated with it directly, but not to any sockets created by the ultimately activated services
       for it. Conversely, the IP access list configured for the service is not applied to any sockets passed
       into the service via socket activation. Thus, it is usually a good idea to replicate the IP access lists
       on both the socket and the service unit. Nevertheless, it may make sense to maintain one list more open
       and the other one more restricted, depending on the use case.

       If these settings are used multiple times in the same unit the specified lists are combined. If an empty
       string is assigned to these settings the specific access list is reset and all previous settings undone.

       In place of explicit IPv4 or IPv6 address and prefix length specifications a small set of symbolic names
       may be used. The following names are defined:

       Note that these settings might not be supported on some systems (for example if eBPF control group
       support is not enabled in the underlying kernel or container manager). These settings will have no effect
       in that case. If compatibility with such systems is desired it is hence recommended to not exclusively
       rely on them for IP security.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>IPAddressDeny</b>
       Turn on network traffic filtering for IP packets sent and received over "AF_INET" and "AF_INET6" sockets.
       Both directives take a space separated list of IPv4 or IPv6 addresses, each optionally suffixed with an
       address prefix length in bits after a "/" character. If the suffix is omitted, the address is considered
       a host address, i.e. the filter covers the whole address (32 bits for IPv4, 128 bits for IPv6).

   <b>SocketBindAllow</b>
       Configures restrictions on the ability of unit processes to invoke <b><a href="../man2/bind.2.html">bind</a></b>(2) on a socket. Both allow and
       deny rules to be defined that restrict which addresses a socket may be bound to.

       bind-rule describes socket properties such as address-family, transport-protocol and ip-ports.

       bind-rule := { [address-family":"][transport-protocol":"][ip-ports] | "any" }

       address-family := { "ipv4" | "ipv6" }

       transport-protocol := { "tcp" | "udp" }

       ip-ports := { ip-port | ip-port-range }

       An optional address-family expects "ipv4" or "ipv6" values.  If not specified, a rule will be matched for
       both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses and applied depending on other socket fields, e.g. transport-protocol, ip-
       port.

       An optional transport-protocol expects "tcp" or "udp" transport protocol names.  If not specified, a rule
       will be matched for any transport protocol.

       An optional ip-port value must lie within 1…65535 interval inclusively, i.e.  dynamic port 0 is not
       allowed. A range of sequential ports is described by ip-port-range := ip-port-low"-"ip-port-high, where
       ip-port-low is smaller than or equal to ip-port-high and both are within 1…65535 inclusively.

       A special value "any" can be used to apply a rule to any address family, transport protocol and any port
       with a positive value.

       To allow multiple rules assign "SocketBindAllow" or "SocketBindDeny" multiple times.  To clear the
       existing assignments pass an empty "SocketBindAllow" or "SocketBindDeny" assignment.

       For each of "SocketBindAllow" and "SocketBindDeny", maximum allowed number of assignments is 128.

       The feature is implemented with "cgroup/bind4" and "cgroup/bind6" cgroup-bpf hooks.

       Note that these settings apply to any <b><a href="../man2/bind.2.html">bind</a></b>(2) system call invocation by the unit processes, regardless in
       which network namespace they are placed. Or in other words: changing the network namespace is not a
       suitable mechanism for escaping these restrictions on <b>bind()</b>.

   <b>SocketBindDeny</b>
       Configures restrictions on the ability of unit processes to invoke <b><a href="../man2/bind.2.html">bind</a></b>(2) on a socket. Both allow and
       deny rules to be defined that restrict which addresses a socket may be bound to.

       bind-rule describes socket properties such as address-family, transport-protocol and ip-ports.

       bind-rule := { [address-family":"][transport-protocol":"][ip-ports] | "any" }

       address-family := { "ipv4" | "ipv6" }

       transport-protocol := { "tcp" | "udp" }

       ip-ports := { ip-port | ip-port-range }

       An optional address-family expects "ipv4" or "ipv6" values.  If not specified, a rule will be matched for
       both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses and applied depending on other socket fields, e.g. transport-protocol, ip-
       port.

       An optional transport-protocol expects "tcp" or "udp" transport protocol names.  If not specified, a rule
       will be matched for any transport protocol.

       An optional ip-port value must lie within 1…65535 interval inclusively, i.e.  dynamic port 0 is not
       allowed. A range of sequential ports is described by ip-port-range := ip-port-low"-"ip-port-high, where
       ip-port-low is smaller than or equal to ip-port-high and both are within 1…65535 inclusively.

       A special value "any" can be used to apply a rule to any address family, transport protocol and any port
       with a positive value.

       To allow multiple rules assign "SocketBindAllow" or "SocketBindDeny" multiple times.  To clear the
       existing assignments pass an empty "SocketBindAllow" or "SocketBindDeny" assignment.

       For each of "SocketBindAllow" and "SocketBindDeny", maximum allowed number of assignments is 128.

       The feature is implemented with "cgroup/bind4" and "cgroup/bind6" cgroup-bpf hooks.

       Note that these settings apply to any <b><a href="../man2/bind.2.html">bind</a></b>(2) system call invocation by the unit processes, regardless in
       which network namespace they are placed. Or in other words: changing the network namespace is not a
       suitable mechanism for escaping these restrictions on <b>bind()</b>.

       Examples:
           …
           # Allow binding IPv6 socket addresses with a port greater than or equal to 10000.
           [Service]
           SocketBindAllow=ipv6:10000-65535
           SocketBindDeny=any

           …  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>RestrictNetworkInterfaces</b>
       Takes a list of space-separated network interface names. This option restricts the network interfaces
       that processes of this unit can use. By default processes can only use the network interfaces listed
       (allow-list). If the first character of the rule is "~", the effect is inverted: the processes can only
       use network interfaces not listed (deny-list).

       This option can appear multiple times, in which case the network interface names are merged. If the empty
       string is assigned the set is reset, all prior assignments will have not effect.

       If you specify both types of this option (i.e. allow-listing and deny-listing), the first encountered
       will take precedence and will dictate the default action (allow vs deny). Then the next occurrences of
       this option will add or delete the listed network interface names from the set, depending of its type and
       the default action.

       The loopback interface ("lo") is not treated in any special way, you have to configure it explicitly in
       the unit file.

       Example 1: allow-list

           RestrictNetworkInterfaces=eth1
           RestrictNetworkInterfaces=eth2

       Programs in the unit will be only able to use the eth1 and eth2 network interfaces.

       Example 2: deny-list

           RestrictNetworkInterfaces=~eth1 eth2

       Programs in the unit will be able to use any network interface but eth1 and eth2.

       Example 3: mixed

           RestrictNetworkInterfaces=eth1 eth2
           RestrictNetworkInterfaces=~eth1

       Programs in the unit will be only able to use the eth2 network interface.   <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>NFTSet</b>
       This setting provides a method for integrating dynamic cgroup, user and group IDs into firewall rules
       with NFT &lt;https://netfilter.org/projects/nftables/index.html&gt; sets. The benefit of using this setting is
       to be able to use the IDs as selectors in firewall rules easily and this in turn allows more fine grained
       filtering. NFT rules for cgroup matching use numeric cgroup IDs, which change every time a service is
       restarted, making them hard to use in systemd environment otherwise. Dynamic and random IDs used by
       "DynamicUser" can be also integrated with this setting.

       This option expects a whitespace separated list of NFT set definitions. Each definition consists of a
       colon-separated tuple of source type (one of "cgroup", "user" or "group"), NFT address family (one of
       "arp", "bridge", "inet", "ip", "ip6", or "netdev"), table name and set name. The names of tables and sets
       must conform to lexical restrictions of NFT table names. The type of the element used in the NFT filter
       must match the type implied by the directive ("cgroup", "user" or "group") as shown in the table below.
       When a control group or a unit is realized, the corresponding ID will be appended to the NFT sets and it
       will be be removed when the control group or unit is removed. systemd only inserts elements to (or
       removes from) the sets, so the related NFT rules, tables and sets must be prepared elsewhere in advance.
       Failures to manage the sets will be ignored.

       If the firewall rules are reinstalled so that the contents of NFT sets are destroyed, command systemctl
       daemon-reload can be used to refill the sets.

       Example:

           [Unit]
           NFTSet=cgroup:inet:filter:my_service user:inet:filter:serviceuser

       Corresponding NFT rules:

           table inet filter {
           set my_service {
           type cgroupsv2
           }
           set serviceuser {
           typeof meta skuid
           }
           chain x {
           socket cgroupv2 level 2 @my_service accept
           drop
           }
           chain y {
           meta skuid @serviceuser accept
           drop
           }
           }
       I&lt; Optional. Type uniline.  &gt;

   <b>IPIngressFilterPath</b>
       Add custom network traffic filters implemented as BPF programs, applying to all IP packets sent and
       received over "AF_INET" and "AF_INET6" sockets.  Takes an absolute path to a pinned BPF program in the
       BPF virtual filesystem ("<a href="file:/sys/fs/bpf/">/sys/fs/bpf/</a>").

       The filters configured with this option are applied to all sockets created by processes of this unit (or
       in the case of socket units, associated with it). The filters are loaded in addition to filters any of
       the parent slice units this unit might be a member of as well as any "IPAddressAllow" and "IPAddressDeny"
       filters in any of these units.  By default there are no filters specified.

       If these settings are used multiple times in the same unit all the specified programs are attached. If an
       empty string is assigned to these settings the program list is reset and all previous specified programs
       ignored.

       If the path BPF_FS_PROGRAM_PATH in "IPIngressFilterPath" assignment is already being handled by
       "BPFProgram" ingress hook, e.g.  "BPFProgram"="ingress":BPF_FS_PROGRAM_PATH, the assignment will be still
       considered valid and the program will be attached to a cgroup. Same for "IPEgressFilterPath" path and
       "egress" hook.

       Note that for socket-activated services, the IP filter programs configured on the socket unit apply to
       all sockets associated with it directly, but not to any sockets created by the ultimately activated
       services for it. Conversely, the IP filter programs configured for the service are not applied to any
       sockets passed into the service via socket activation. Thus, it is usually a good idea, to replicate the
       IP filter programs on both the socket and the service unit, however it often makes sense to maintain one
       configuration more open and the other one more restricted, depending on the use case.

       Note that these settings might not be supported on some systems (for example if eBPF control group
       support is not enabled in the underlying kernel or container manager). These settings will fail the
       service in that case. If compatibility with such systems is desired it is hence recommended to attach
       your filter manually (requires "Delegate"="yes") instead of using this setting.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>IPEgressFilterPath</b>
       Add custom network traffic filters implemented as BPF programs, applying to all IP packets sent and
       received over "AF_INET" and "AF_INET6" sockets.  Takes an absolute path to a pinned BPF program in the
       BPF virtual filesystem ("<a href="file:/sys/fs/bpf/">/sys/fs/bpf/</a>").

       your filter manually (requires "Delegate"="yes") instead of using this setting.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>BPFProgram</b>
       "BPFProgram" allows attaching custom BPF programs to the cgroup of a unit. (This generalizes the
       functionality exposed via "IPEgressFilterPath" and "IPIngressFilterPath" for other hooks.)  Cgroup-bpf
       hooks in the form of BPF programs loaded to the BPF filesystem are attached with cgroup-bpf attach flags
       determined by the unit. For details about attachment types and flags see "bpf.h"
       &lt;https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/plain/include/uapi/linux/bpf.h&gt;. Also
       refer to the general BPF documentation &lt;https://docs.kernel.org/bpf/&gt;.

       The specification of BPF program consists of a pair of BPF program type and program path in the file
       system, with ":" as the separator: type:program-path.

       The BPF program type is equivalent to the BPF attach type used in <b><a href="../man8/bpftool.8.html">bpftool</a></b>(8) It may be one of "egress",
       "ingress", "sock_create", "sock_ops", "device", "bind4", "bind6", "connect4", "connect6", "post_bind4",
       "post_bind6", "sendmsg4", "sendmsg6", "sysctl", "recvmsg4", "recvmsg6", "getsockopt", or "setsockopt".

       The specified program path must be an absolute path referencing a BPF program inode in the bpffs file
       system (which generally means it must begin with "<a href="file:/sys/fs/bpf/">/sys/fs/bpf/</a>"). If a specified program does not exist
       (i.e. has not been uploaded to the BPF subsystem of the kernel yet), it will not be installed but unit
       activation will continue (a warning will be printed to the logs).

       Setting "BPFProgram" to an empty value makes previous assignments ineffective.

       Multiple assignments of the same program type/path pair have the same effect as a single assignment: the
       program will be attached just once.

       If BPF "egress" pinned to program-path path is already being handled by "IPEgressFilterPath",
       "BPFProgram" assignment will be considered valid and "BPFProgram" will be attached to a cgroup.
       Similarly for "ingress" hook and "IPIngressFilterPath" assignment.

       BPF programs passed with "BPFProgram" are attached to the cgroup of a unit with BPF attach flag "multi",
       that allows further attachments of the same type within cgroup hierarchy topped by the unit cgroup.

       Examples:
           BPFProgram=egress:/sys/fs/bpf/egress-hook
           BPFProgram=bind6:/sys/fs/bpf/sock-addr-hook .  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>DeviceAllow</b>
       Control access to specific device nodes by the executed processes. Takes two space-separated strings: a
       device node specifier followed by a combination of "r", "w", "m" to control reading, writing, or creation
       of the specific device nodes by the unit (mknod), respectively. This functionality is implemented using
       eBPF filtering.

       When access to all physical devices should be disallowed, "PrivateDevices" may be used instead. See
       <b><a href="../man5/systemd.exec.5.html">systemd.exec</a></b>(5).

       The device node specifier is either a path to a device node in the file system, starting with "<a href="file:/dev/">/dev/</a>", or
       a string starting with either "char-" or "block-" followed by a device group name, as listed in
       "<a href="file:/proc/devices">/proc/devices</a>". The latter is useful to allow-list all current and future devices belonging to a
       specific device group at once. The device group is matched according to filename globbing rules, you may
       hence use the "*" and "?"  wildcards. (Note that such globbing wildcards are not available for device
       node path specifications!) In order to match device nodes by numeric major/minor, use device node paths
       in the "<a href="file:/dev/char/">/dev/char/</a>" and "<a href="file:/dev/block/">/dev/block/</a>" directories. However, matching devices by major/minor is generally
       not recommended as assignments are neither stable nor portable between systems or different kernel
       versions.

       Examples: "/dev/sda5" is a path to a device node, referring to an ATA or SCSI block device. "char-pts"
       and "char-alsa" are specifiers for all pseudo TTYs and all ALSA sound devices, respectively. "char-cpu/*"
       is a specifier matching all CPU related device groups.

       Note that allow lists defined this way should only reference device groups which are resolvable at the
       time the unit is started. Any device groups not resolvable then are not added to the device allow list.
       In order to work around this limitation, consider extending service units with a pair of
       After=<a href="mailto:modprobe@xyz.service">modprobe@xyz.service</a> and Wants=<a href="mailto:modprobe@xyz.service">modprobe@xyz.service</a> lines that load the necessary kernel module
       implementing the device group if missing.  Example:
           …
           [Unit]
           Wants=<a href="mailto:modprobe@loop.service">modprobe@loop.service</a>
           After=<a href="mailto:modprobe@loop.service">modprobe@loop.service</a>
           [Service]
           DeviceAllow=block-loop
           DeviceAllow=/dev/loop-control
           …  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>list</u> <u>of</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>DevicePolicy</b>
       Control the policy for allowing device access:  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>enum.</u> <u>choice:</u> <u>'auto',</u> <u>'closed',</u> <u>'strict'.</u>

   <b>Slice</b>
       The name of the slice unit to place the unit in. Defaults to "system.slice" for all non-instantiated
       units of all unit types (except for slice units themselves see below). Instance units are by default
       placed in a subslice of "system.slice" that is named after the template name.

       This option may be used to arrange systemd units in a hierarchy of slices each of which might have
       resource settings applied.

       For units of type slice, the only accepted value for this setting is the parent slice. Since the name of
       a slice unit implies the parent slice, it is hence redundant to ever set this parameter directly for
       slice units.

       Special care should be taken when relying on the default slice assignment in templated service units that
       have "DefaultDependencies=no" set, see <b><a href="../man5/systemd.service.5.html">systemd.service</a></b>(5), section "Default Dependencies" for details.
       <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>Delegate</b>
       Turns on delegation of further resource control partitioning to processes of the unit. Units where this
       is enabled may create and manage their own private subhierarchy of control groups below the control group
       of the unit itself. For unprivileged services (i.e. those using the "User" setting) the unit's control
       group will be made accessible to the relevant user.

       When enabled the service manager will refrain from manipulating control groups or moving processes below
       the unit's control group, so that a clear concept of ownership is established: the control group tree at
       the level of the unit's control group and above (i.e. towards the root control group) is owned and
       managed by the service manager of the host, while the control group tree below the unit's control group
       is owned and managed by the unit itself.

       Takes either a boolean argument or a (possibly empty) list of control group controller names.  If true,
       delegation is turned on, and all supported controllers are enabled for the unit, making them available to
       the unit's processes for management. If false, delegation is turned off entirely (and no additional
       controllers are enabled). If set to a list of controllers, delegation is turned on, and the specified
       controllers are enabled for the unit. Assigning the empty string will enable delegation, but reset the
       list of controllers, and all assignments prior to this will have no effect. Note that additional
       controllers other than the ones specified might be made available as well, depending on configuration of
       the containing slice unit or other units contained in it.  Defaults to false.

       Note that controller delegation to less privileged code is only safe on the unified control group
       hierarchy. Accordingly, access to the specified controllers will not be granted to unprivileged services
       on the legacy hierarchy, even when requested.

       Not all of these controllers are available on all kernels however, and some are specific to the unified
       hierarchy while others are specific to the legacy hierarchy. Also note that the kernel might support
       further controllers, which aren't covered here yet as delegation is either not supported at all for them
       or not defined cleanly.

       Note that because of the hierarchical nature of cgroup hierarchy, any controllers that are delegated will
       be enabled for the parent and sibling units of the unit with delegation.

       For further details on the delegation model consult Control Group APIs and Delegation
       &lt;https://systemd.io/CGROUP_DELEGATION&gt;.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>DelegateSubgroup</b>
       Place unit processes in the specified subgroup of the unit's control group. Takes a valid control group
       name (not a path!) as parameter, or an empty string to turn this feature off. Defaults to off. The
       control group name must be usable as filename and avoid conflicts with the kernel's control group
       attribute files (i.e. "cgroup.procs" is not an acceptable name, since the kernel exposes a native control
       group attribute file by that name). This option has no effect unless control group delegation is turned
       on via "Delegate", see above. Note that this setting only applies to "main" processes of a unit, i.e. for
       services to "ExecStart", but not for "ExecReload" and similar. If delegation is enabled, the latter are
       always placed inside a subgroup named ".control". The specified subgroup is automatically created (and
       potentially ownership is passed to the unit's configured user/group) when a process is started in it.

       This option is useful to avoid manually moving the invoked process into a subgroup after it has been
       started. Since no processes should live in inner nodes of the control group tree it's almost always
       necessary to run the main ("supervising") process of a unit that has delegation turned on in a subgroup.
       <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>DisableControllers</b>
       Disables controllers from being enabled for a unit's children. If a controller listed is already in use
       in its subtree, the controller will be removed from the subtree. This can be used to avoid configuration
       in child units from being able to implicitly or explicitly enable a controller.  Defaults to empty.

       Multiple controllers may be specified, separated by spaces. You may also pass "DisableControllers"
       multiple times, in which case each new instance adds another controller to disable. Passing
       "DisableControllers" by itself with no controller name present resets the disabled controller list.

       It may not be possible to disable a controller after units have been started, if the unit or any child of
       the unit in question delegates controllers to its children, as any delegated subtree of the cgroup
       hierarchy is unmanaged by systemd.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>ManagedOOMSwap</b>
       Specifies how <b><a href="../man8/systemd-oomd.service.8.html">systemd-oomd.service</a></b>(8) will act on this unit's cgroups. Defaults to "auto".

       When set to "kill", the unit becomes a candidate for monitoring by systemd-oomd. If the cgroup passes the

   <b>ManagedOOMMemoryPressureLimit</b>
       Overrides the default memory pressure limit set by <b><a href="../man5/oomd.conf.5.html">oomd.conf</a></b>(5) for the cgroup of this unit. Takes a
       percentage value between 0% and 100%, inclusive. Defaults to 0%, which means to use the default set by
       <b><a href="../man5/oomd.conf.5.html">oomd.conf</a></b>(5).  This property is ignored unless "ManagedOOMMemoryPressure"="kill".   <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u>
       <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>ManagedOOMMemoryPressureDurationSec</b>
       Overrides the default memory pressure duration set by <b><a href="../man5/oomd.conf.5.html">oomd.conf</a></b>(5) for the cgroup of this unit. The
       specified value supports a time unit such as "ms" or "μs", see <b><a href="../man7/systemd.time.7.html">systemd.time</a></b>(7) for details on the
       permitted syntax. Must be set to either empty or a value of at least 1s. Defaults to empty, which means
       to use the default set by <b><a href="../man5/oomd.conf.5.html">oomd.conf</a></b>(5).  This property is ignored unless
       "ManagedOOMMemoryPressure"="kill".   <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>ManagedOOMPreference</b>
       Allows deprioritizing or omitting this unit's cgroup as a candidate when systemd-oomd needs to act.
       Requires support for extended attributes (see <b><a href="../man7/xattr.7.html">xattr</a></b>(7)) in order to use "avoid" or "omit".

       When calculating candidates to relieve swap usage, systemd-oomd will only respect these extended
       attributes if the unit's cgroup is owned by root.

       When calculating candidates to relieve memory pressure, systemd-oomd will only respect these extended
       attributes if the unit's cgroup is owned by root, or if the unit's cgroup owner, and the owner of the
       monitored ancestor cgroup are the same. For example, if systemd-oomd is calculating candidates for
       "-.slice", then extended attributes set on descendants of
       "/user.slice/user-1000.slice/<a href="mailto:user@1000.service">user@1000.service</a>/" will be ignored because the descendants are owned by UID
       1000, and "-.slice" is owned by UID 0. But, if calculating candidates for
       "/user.slice/user-1000.slice/<a href="mailto:user@1000.service">user@1000.service</a>/", then extended attributes set on the descendants would
       be respected.

       If this property is set to "avoid", the service manager will convey this to systemd-oomd, which will only
       select this cgroup if there are no other viable candidates.

       If this property is set to "omit", the service manager will convey this to systemd-oomd, which will
       ignore this cgroup as a candidate and will not perform any actions on it.

       It is recommended to use "avoid" and "omit" sparingly, as it can adversely affect systemd-oomd's kill
       behavior. Also note that these extended attributes are not applied recursively to cgroups under this
       unit's cgroup.

       Defaults to "none" which means systemd-oomd will rank this unit's cgroup as defined in
       <b><a href="../man8/systemd-oomd.service.8.html">systemd-oomd.service</a></b>(8) and <b><a href="../man5/oomd.conf.5.html">oomd.conf</a></b>(5).   <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>enum.</u> <u>choice:</u> <u>'avoid',</u> <u>'none',</u> <u>'omit'.</u>

   <b>MemoryPressureWatch</b>
       Controls memory pressure monitoring for invoked processes. Takes a boolean or one of "auto" and "skip".
       If "no", tells the service not to watch for memory pressure events, by setting the $MEMORY_PRESSURE_WATCH
       environment variable to the literal string "/dev/null". If "yes", tells the service to watch for memory
       pressure events. This enables memory accounting for the service, and ensures the "memory.pressure" cgroup
       attribute file is accessible for reading and writing by the service's user. It then sets the
       $MEMORY_PRESSURE_WATCH environment variable for processes invoked by the unit to the file system path to
       this file. The threshold information configured with "MemoryPressureThresholdSec" is encoded in the
       $MEMORY_PRESSURE_WRITE environment variable. If the "auto" value is set the protocol is enabled if memory
       accounting is anyway enabled for the unit, and disabled otherwise. If set to "skip" the logic is neither
       enabled, nor disabled and the two environment variables are not set.

       Note that services are free to use the two environment variables, but it's unproblematic if they ignore
       them. Memory pressure handling must be implemented individually in each service, and usually means
       different things for different software. For further details on memory pressure handling see Memory
       Pressure Handling in systemd &lt;https://systemd.io/MEMORY_PRESSURE&gt;.

       Services implemented using <b><a href="../man3/sd-event.3.html">sd-event</a></b>(3) may use <b><a href="../man3/sd_event_add_memory_pressure.3.html">sd_event_add_memory_pressure</a></b>(3) to watch for and handle
       memory pressure events.

       If not explicit set, defaults to the "DefaultMemoryPressureWatch" setting in <b><a href="../man5/systemd-system.conf.5.html">systemd-system.conf</a></b>(5).
       <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>enum.</u> <u>choice:</u> <u>'auto',</u> <u>'no',</u> <u>'skip',</u> <u>'yes'.</u>

   <b>MemoryPressureThresholdSec</b>
       Sets the memory pressure threshold time for memory pressure monitor as configured via
       "MemoryPressureWatch". Specifies the maximum allocation latency before a memory pressure event is
       signalled to the service, per 2s window. If not specified defaults to the
       "DefaultMemoryPressureThresholdSec" setting in <b><a href="../man5/systemd-system.conf.5.html">systemd-system.conf</a></b>(5) (which in turn defaults to 200ms).
       The specified value expects a time unit such as "ms" or "μs", see <b><a href="../man7/systemd.time.7.html">systemd.time</a></b>(7) for details on the
       permitted syntax.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>CoredumpReceive</b>
       Takes a boolean argument. This setting is used to enable coredump forwarding for containers that belong
       to this unit's cgroup. Units with "CoredumpReceive=yes" must also be configured with "Delegate=yes".
       Defaults to false.

       When systemd-coredump is handling a coredump for a process from a container, if the container's leader
       process is a descendant of a cgroup with "CoredumpReceive=yes" and "Delegate=yes", then systemd-coredump
       will attempt to forward the coredump to systemd-coredump within the container. See also
       <b><a href="../man8/systemd-coredump.8.html">systemd-coredump</a></b>(8).  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>boolean.</u>

   <b>ExecSearchPath</b>
       Takes a colon separated list of absolute paths relative to which the executable used by the "Exec*="
       (e.g. "ExecStart", "ExecStop", etc.) properties can be found. "ExecSearchPath" overrides $PATH if $PATH
       is not supplied by the user through "Environment", "EnvironmentFile" or "PassEnvironment". Assigning an
       empty string removes previous assignments and setting "ExecSearchPath" to a value multiple times will
       append to the previous setting.   <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>list</u> <u>of</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>WorkingDirectory</b>
       Takes a directory path relative to the service's root directory specified by "RootDirectory", or the
       special value "~". Sets the working directory for executed processes. If set to "~", the home directory
       of the user specified in "User" is used. If not set, defaults to the root directory when systemd is
       running as a system instance and the respective user's home directory if run as user. If the setting is
       prefixed with the "-" character, a missing working directory is not considered fatal. If
       "RootDirectory"/"RootImage" is not set, then "WorkingDirectory" is relative to the root of the system
       running the service manager. Note that setting this parameter might result in additional dependencies to
       be added to the unit (see above).  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>RootDirectory</b>
       Takes a directory path relative to the host's root directory (i.e. the root of the system running the
       service manager). Sets the root directory for executed processes, with the <b><a href="../man2/pivot_root.2.html">pivot_root</a></b>(2) or <b><a href="../man2/chroot.2.html">chroot</a></b>(2)
       system call. If this is used, it must be ensured that the process binary and all its auxiliary files are
       available in the new root. Note that setting this parameter might result in additional dependencies to be
       added to the unit (see above).

       The "MountAPIVFS" and "PrivateUsers" settings are particularly useful in conjunction with
       "RootDirectory". For details, see below.

       If "RootDirectory"/"RootImage" are used together with "NotifyAccess" the notification socket is
       automatically mounted from the host into the root environment, to ensure the notification interface can
       work correctly.

       Note that services using "RootDirectory"/"RootImage" will not be able to log via the syslog or journal
       protocols to the host logging infrastructure, unless the relevant sockets are mounted from the host,
       specifically:

       The host's <b><a href="../man5/os-release.5.html">os-release</a></b>(5) file will be made available for the service (read-only) as
       "/run/host/os-release".  It will be updated automatically on soft reboot (see:
       <b><a href="../man8/systemd-soft-reboot.service.8.html">systemd-soft-reboot.service</a></b>(8)), in case the service is configured to survive it.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u>
       <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>RootImage</b>
       Takes a path to a block device node or regular file as argument. This call is similar to "RootDirectory"
       however mounts a file system hierarchy from a block device node or loopback file instead of a directory.
       The device node or file system image file needs to contain a file system without a partition table, or a
       file system within an MBR/MS-DOS or GPT partition table with only a single Linux-compatible partition, or
       a set of file systems within a GPT partition table that follows the Discoverable Partitions Specification
       &lt;https://uapi-group.org/specifications/specs/discoverable_partitions_specification&gt;.

       When "DevicePolicy" is set to "closed" or "strict", or set to "auto" and "DeviceAllow" is set, then this
       setting adds "/dev/loop-control" with "rw" mode, "block-loop" and "block-blkext" with "rwm" mode to
       "DeviceAllow". See <b><a href="../man5/systemd.resource-control.5.html">systemd.resource-control</a></b>(5) for the details about "DevicePolicy" or "DeviceAllow".
       Also, see "PrivateDevices" below, as it may change the setting of "DevicePolicy".

       Units making use of "RootImage" automatically gain an "After" dependency on "systemd-udevd.service".

       The host's <b><a href="../man5/os-release.5.html">os-release</a></b>(5) file will be made available for the service (read-only) as
       "/run/host/os-release".  It will be updated automatically on soft reboot (see:
       <b><a href="../man8/systemd-soft-reboot.service.8.html">systemd-soft-reboot.service</a></b>(8)), in case the service is configured to survive it.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u>
       <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>RootImageOptions</b>
       Takes a comma-separated list of mount options that will be used on disk images specified by "RootImage".
       Optionally a partition name can be prefixed, followed by colon, in case the image has multiple
       partitions, otherwise partition name "root" is implied.  Options for multiple partitions can be specified
       in a single line with space separators. Assigning an empty string removes previous assignments.
       Duplicated options are ignored. For a list of valid mount options, please refer to <b><a href="../man8/mount.8.html">mount</a></b>(8).

       Valid partition names follow the Discoverable Partitions Specification &lt;https://uapi-
       group.org/specifications/specs/discoverable_partitions_specification&gt;: "root", "usr", "home", "srv",
       "esp", "xbootldr", "tmp", "var".  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>RootEphemeral</b>
       Takes a boolean argument. If enabled, executed processes will run in an ephemeral copy of the root
       directory or root image. The ephemeral copy is placed in "<a href="file:/var/lib/systemd/ephemeral-trees/">/var/lib/systemd/ephemeral-trees/</a>" while the
       service is active and is cleaned up when the service is stopped or restarted. If "RootDirectory" is used
       and the root directory is a subvolume, the ephemeral copy will be created by making a snapshot of the
       subvolume.

       To make sure making ephemeral copies can be made efficiently, the root directory or root image should be
       located on the same filesystem as "<a href="file:/var/lib/systemd/ephemeral-trees/">/var/lib/systemd/ephemeral-trees/</a>".  When using "RootEphemeral" with
       root directories, <b><a href="../man5/btrfs.5.html">btrfs</a></b>(5) should be used as the filesystem and the root directory should ideally be a
       subvolume which systemd can snapshot to make the ephemeral copy. For root images, a filesystem with
       support for reflinks should be used to ensure an efficient ephemeral copy.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>boolean.</u>

   <b>RootHash</b>
       Takes a data integrity (dm-verity) root hash specified in hexadecimal, or the path to a file containing a
       root hash in ASCII hexadecimal format. This option enables data integrity checks using dm-verity, if the
       used image contains the appropriate integrity data (see above) or if "RootVerity" is used.  The specified
       hash must match the root hash of integrity data, and is usually at least 256 bits (and hence 64 formatted
       hexadecimal characters) long (in case of SHA256 for example). If this option is not specified, but the
       image file carries the "user.verity.roothash" extended file attribute (see <b><a href="../man7/xattr.7.html">xattr</a></b>(7)), then the root hash
       is read from it, also as formatted hexadecimal characters. If the extended file attribute is not found
       (or is not supported by the underlying file system), but a file with the ".roothash" suffix is found next
       to the image file, bearing otherwise the same name (except if the image has the ".raw" suffix, in which
       case the root hash file must not have it in its name), the root hash is read from it and automatically
       used, also as formatted hexadecimal characters.

       If the disk image contains a separate "<a href="file:/usr/">/usr/</a>" partition it may also be Verity protected, in which case
       the root hash may configured via an extended attribute "user.verity.usrhash" or a ".usrhash" file
       adjacent to the disk image. There's currently no option to configure the root hash for the "<a href="file:/usr/">/usr/</a>" file
       system via the unit file directly.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>RootHashSignature</b>
       Takes a PKCS7 signature of the "RootHash" option as a path to a DER-encoded signature file, or as an
       ASCII base64 string encoding of a DER-encoded signature prefixed by "base64:". The dm-verity volume will
       only be opened if the signature of the root hash is valid and signed by a public key present in the
       kernel keyring. If this option is not specified, but a file with the ".roothash.p7s" suffix is found next
       to the image file, bearing otherwise the same name (except if the image has the ".raw" suffix, in which
       case the signature file must not have it in its name), the signature is read from it and automatically
       used.

       If the disk image contains a separate "<a href="file:/usr/">/usr/</a>" partition it may also be Verity protected, in which case
       the signature for the root hash may configured via a ".usrhash.p7s" file adjacent to the disk image.
       There's currently no option to configure the root hash signature for the "<a href="file:/usr/">/usr/</a>" via the unit file
       directly.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>RootVerity</b>
       Takes the path to a data integrity (dm-verity) file. This option enables data integrity checks using dm-
       verity, if "RootImage" is used and a root-hash is passed and if the used image itself does not contain
       the integrity data. The integrity data must be matched by the root hash. If this option is not specified,
       but a file with the ".verity" suffix is found next to the image file, bearing otherwise the same name
       (except if the image has the ".raw" suffix, in which case the verity data file must not have it in its
       name), the verity data is read from it and automatically used.

       This option is supported only for disk images that contain a single file system, without an enveloping
       partition table. Images that contain a GPT partition table should instead include both root file system
       and matching Verity data in the same image, implementing the Discoverable Partitions Specification
       &lt;https://uapi-group.org/specifications/specs/discoverable_partitions_specification&gt;.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u>
       <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>RootImagePolicy</b>
       Takes an image policy string as per <b><a href="../man7/systemd.image-policy.7.html">systemd.image-policy</a></b>(7) to use when mounting the disk images (DDI)
       specified in "RootImage", "MountImage", "ExtensionImage", respectively. If not specified the following
       policy string is the default for "RootImagePolicy" and "MountImagePolicy":

       . I&lt; Optional. Type uniline.  &gt;

   <b>MountImagePolicy</b>
       Takes an image policy string as per <b><a href="../man7/systemd.image-policy.7.html">systemd.image-policy</a></b>(7) to use when mounting the disk images (DDI)
       specified in "RootImage", "MountImage", "ExtensionImage", respectively. If not specified the following

       . I&lt; Optional. Type uniline.  &gt;

   <b>ExtensionImagePolicy</b>
       Takes an image policy string as per <b><a href="../man7/systemd.image-policy.7.html">systemd.image-policy</a></b>(7) to use when mounting the disk images (DDI)
       specified in "RootImage", "MountImage", "ExtensionImage", respectively. If not specified the following

       . I&lt; Optional. Type uniline.  &gt;

   <b>MountAPIVFS</b>
       Takes a boolean argument. If on, a private mount namespace for the unit's processes is created and the
       API file systems "<a href="file:/proc/">/proc/</a>", "<a href="file:/sys/">/sys/</a>", "<a href="file:/dev/">/dev/</a>" and "<a href="file:/run/">/run/</a>" (as an empty "tmpfs") are mounted inside of it,
       unless they are already mounted. Note that this option has no effect unless used in conjunction with
       "RootDirectory"/"RootImage" as these four mounts are generally mounted in the host anyway, and unless the
       root directory is changed, the private mount namespace will be a 1:1 copy of the host's, and include
       these four mounts. Note that the "<a href="file:/dev/">/dev/</a>" file system of the host is bind mounted if this option is used
       without "PrivateDevices". To run the service with a private, minimal version of "<a href="file:/dev/">/dev/</a>", combine this
       option with "PrivateDevices".

       In order to allow propagating mounts at runtime in a safe manner, "<a href="file:/run/systemd/propagate/">/run/systemd/propagate/</a>" on the host
       will be used to set up new mounts, and "/run/host/incoming/" in the private namespace will be used as an
       intermediate step to store them before being moved to the final mount point.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>boolean.</u>

   <b>BindLogSockets</b>
       Takes a boolean argument. If true, sockets from <b><a href="../man8/systemd-journald.socket.8.html">systemd-journald.socket</a></b>(8) will be bind mounted into the
       mount namespace. This is particularly useful when a different instance of "<a href="file:/run/">/run/</a>" is employed, to make
       sure processes running in the namespace can still make use of <b><a href="../man3/sd-journal.3.html">sd-journal</a></b>(3).

       This option is implied when "LogNamespace" is used, when "MountAPIVFS=yes", or when "PrivateDevices=yes"
       is used in conjunction with either "RootDirectory" or "RootImage".  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>boolean.</u>

   <b>ProtectProc</b>
       Takes one of "noaccess", "invisible", "ptraceable" or "default" (which it defaults to). When set, this
       controls the "hidepid=" mount option of the "procfs" instance for the unit that controls which
       directories with process metainformation ("/proc/PID") are visible and accessible: when set to "noaccess"
       the ability to access most of other users' process metadata in "<a href="file:/proc/">/proc/</a>" is taken away for processes of
       the service. When set to "invisible" processes owned by other users are hidden from "<a href="file:/proc/">/proc/</a>". If
       "ptraceable" all processes that cannot be <b>ptrace()</b>'ed by a process are hidden to it. If "default" no
       restrictions on "<a href="file:/proc/">/proc/</a>" access or visibility are made. For further details see The <a href="file:/proc">/proc</a> Filesystem
       &lt;https://docs.kernel.org/filesystems/proc.html#mount-options&gt;. It is generally recommended to run most
       system services with this option set to "invisible". This option is implemented via file system
       namespacing, and thus cannot be used with services that shall be able to install mount points in the host
       file system hierarchy. Note that the root user is unaffected by this option, so to be effective it has to
       be used together with "User" or "DynamicUser=yes", and also without the "CAP_SYS_PTRACE" capability,
       which also allows a process to bypass this feature. It cannot be used for services that need to access
       metainformation about other users' processes. This option implies "MountAPIVFS".

       If the kernel doesn't support per-mount point "hidepid=" mount options this setting remains without
       effect, and the unit's processes will be able to access and see other process as if the option was not
       used.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>enum.</u> <u>choice:</u> <u>'default',</u> <u>'invisible',</u> <u>'noaccess',</u> <u>'ptraceable'.</u>

   <b>ProcSubset</b>
       Takes one of "all" (the default) and "pid". If "pid", all files and directories not directly associated
       with process management and introspection are made invisible in the "<a href="file:/proc/">/proc/</a>" file system configured for
       the unit's processes. This controls the "subset=" mount option of the "procfs" instance for the unit. For
       further details see The <a href="file:/proc">/proc</a> Filesystem &lt;https://docs.kernel.org/filesystems/proc.html#mount-options&gt;.
       Note that Linux exposes various kernel APIs via "<a href="file:/proc/">/proc/</a>", which are made unavailable with this setting.
       Since these APIs are used frequently this option is useful only in a few, specific cases, and is not
       suitable for most non-trivial programs.

       Much like "ProtectProc" above, this is implemented via file system mount namespacing, and hence the same
       restrictions apply: it is only available to system services, it disables mount propagation to the host
       mount table, and it implies "MountAPIVFS". Also, like "ProtectProc" this setting is gracefully disabled
       if the used kernel does not support the "subset=" mount option of "procfs".  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>enum.</u> <u>choice:</u>
       <u>'all',</u> <u>'pid'.</u>

   <b>BindPaths</b>
       Configures unit-specific bind mounts. A bind mount makes a particular file or directory available at an
       additional place in the unit's view of the file system. Any bind mounts created with this option are
       specific to the unit, and are not visible in the host's mount table. This option expects a whitespace
       separated list of bind mount definitions. Each definition consists of a colon-separated triple of source
       path, destination path and option string, where the latter two are optional. If only a source path is
       specified the source and destination is taken to be the same. The option string may be either "rbind" or
       "norbind" for configuring a recursive or non-recursive bind mount. If the destination path is omitted,
       the option string must be omitted too.  Each bind mount definition may be prefixed with "-", in which
       case it will be ignored when its source path does not exist.

       "BindPaths" creates regular writable bind mounts (unless the source file system mount is already marked
       read-only), while "BindReadOnlyPaths" creates read-only bind mounts. These settings may be used more than
       once, each usage appends to the unit's list of bind mounts. If the empty string is assigned to either of
       these two options the entire list of bind mounts defined prior to this is reset. Note that in this case
       both read-only and regular bind mounts are reset, regardless which of the two settings is used.

       Using this option implies that a mount namespace is allocated for the unit, i.e. it implies the effect of
       "PrivateMounts" (see below).

       This option is particularly useful when "RootDirectory"/"RootImage" is used. In this case the source path
       refers to a path on the host file system, while the destination path refers to a path below the root
       directory of the unit.

       Note that the destination directory must exist or systemd must be able to create it. Thus, it is not
       possible to use those options for mount points nested underneath paths specified in "InaccessiblePaths",
       or under "<a href="file:/home/">/home/</a>" and other protected directories if "ProtectHome=yes" is specified.
       "TemporaryFileSystem" with ":ro" or "ProtectHome=tmpfs" should be used instead.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>list</u> <u>of</u>
       <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>BindReadOnlyPaths</b>
       Configures unit-specific bind mounts. A bind mount makes a particular file or directory available at an
       additional place in the unit's view of the file system. Any bind mounts created with this option are
       specific to the unit, and are not visible in the host's mount table. This option expects a whitespace
       separated list of bind mount definitions. Each definition consists of a colon-separated triple of source
       path, destination path and option string, where the latter two are optional. If only a source path is
       specified the source and destination is taken to be the same. The option string may be either "rbind" or
       "norbind" for configuring a recursive or non-recursive bind mount. If the destination path is omitted,
       the option string must be omitted too.  Each bind mount definition may be prefixed with "-", in which
       case it will be ignored when its source path does not exist.

       "BindPaths" creates regular writable bind mounts (unless the source file system mount is already marked
       read-only), while "BindReadOnlyPaths" creates read-only bind mounts. These settings may be used more than
       once, each usage appends to the unit's list of bind mounts. If the empty string is assigned to either of
       these two options the entire list of bind mounts defined prior to this is reset. Note that in this case
       both read-only and regular bind mounts are reset, regardless which of the two settings is used.

       Using this option implies that a mount namespace is allocated for the unit, i.e. it implies the effect of
       "PrivateMounts" (see below).

       This option is particularly useful when "RootDirectory"/"RootImage" is used. In this case the source path
       refers to a path on the host file system, while the destination path refers to a path below the root
       directory of the unit.

       Note that the destination directory must exist or systemd must be able to create it. Thus, it is not
       possible to use those options for mount points nested underneath paths specified in "InaccessiblePaths",
       or under "<a href="file:/home/">/home/</a>" and other protected directories if "ProtectHome=yes" is specified.
       "TemporaryFileSystem" with ":ro" or "ProtectHome=tmpfs" should be used instead.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>list</u> <u>of</u>
       <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>MountImages</b>
       This setting is similar to "RootImage" in that it mounts a file system hierarchy from a block device node
       or loopback file, but the destination directory can be specified as well as mount options. This option
       expects a whitespace separated list of mount definitions. Each definition consists of a colon-separated
       tuple of source path and destination definitions, optionally followed by another colon and a list of
       mount options.

       Mount options may be defined as a single comma-separated list of options, in which case they will be
       implicitly applied to the root partition on the image, or a series of colon-separated tuples of partition
       name and mount options. Valid partition names and mount options are the same as for "RootImageOptions"
       setting described above.

       Each mount definition may be prefixed with "-", in which case it will be ignored when its source path
       does not exist. The source argument is a path to a block device node or regular file. If source or
       destination contain a ":", it needs to be escaped as "\:". The device node or file system image file
       needs to follow the same rules as specified for "RootImage". Any mounts created with this option are
       specific to the unit, and are not visible in the host's mount table.

       These settings may be used more than once, each usage appends to the unit's list of mount paths. If the
       empty string is assigned, the entire list of mount paths defined prior to this is reset.

       Note that the destination directory must exist or systemd must be able to create it. Thus, it is not
       possible to use those options for mount points nested underneath paths specified in "InaccessiblePaths",
       or under "<a href="file:/home/">/home/</a>" and other protected directories if "ProtectHome=yes" is specified.

       When "DevicePolicy" is set to "closed" or "strict", or set to "auto" and "DeviceAllow" is set, then this
       setting adds "/dev/loop-control" with "rw" mode, "block-loop" and "block-blkext" with "rwm" mode to
       "DeviceAllow". See <b><a href="../man5/systemd.resource-control.5.html">systemd.resource-control</a></b>(5) for the details about "DevicePolicy" or "DeviceAllow".
       Also, see "PrivateDevices" below, as it may change the setting of "DevicePolicy".  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>list</u> <u>of</u>
       <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>ExtensionImages</b>
       This setting is similar to "MountImages" in that it mounts a file system hierarchy from a block device
       node or loopback file, but instead of providing a destination path, an overlay will be set up. This
       option expects a whitespace separated list of mount definitions. Each definition consists of a source
       path, optionally followed by a colon and a list of mount options.

       A read-only OverlayFS will be set up on top of "<a href="file:/usr/">/usr/</a>" and "<a href="file:/opt/">/opt/</a>" hierarchies for sysext images and
       "<a href="file:/etc/">/etc/</a>" hierarchy for confext images. The order in which the images are listed will determine the order
       in which the overlay is laid down: images specified first to last will result in overlayfs layers bottom
       to top.

       Mount options may be defined as a single comma-separated list of options, in which case they will be
       implicitly applied to the root partition on the image, or a series of colon-separated tuples of partition
       name and mount options. Valid partition names and mount options are the same as for "RootImageOptions"
       setting described above.

       Each mount definition may be prefixed with "-", in which case it will be ignored when its source path
       does not exist. The source argument is a path to a block device node or regular file. If the source path
       contains a ":", it needs to be escaped as "\:". The device node or file system image file needs to follow
       the same rules as specified for "RootImage". Any mounts created with this option are specific to the
       unit, and are not visible in the host's mount table.

       These settings may be used more than once, each usage appends to the unit's list of image paths. If the
       empty string is assigned, the entire list of mount paths defined prior to this is reset.

       Each sysext image must carry a "/usr/lib/extension-release.d/extension-release.IMAGE" file while each
       confext image must carry a "/etc/extension-release.d/extension-release.IMAGE" file, with the appropriate
       metadata which matches "RootImage"/"RootDirectory" or the host. See: <b><a href="../man5/os-release.5.html">os-release</a></b>(5).  To disable the
       safety check that the extension-release file name matches the image file name, the
       "x-systemd.relax-extension-release-check" mount option may be appended.

       When "DevicePolicy" is set to "closed" or "strict", or set to "auto" and "DeviceAllow" is set, then this
       setting adds "/dev/loop-control" with "rw" mode, "block-loop" and "block-blkext" with "rwm" mode to
       "DeviceAllow". See <b><a href="../man5/systemd.resource-control.5.html">systemd.resource-control</a></b>(5) for the details about "DevicePolicy" or "DeviceAllow".
       Also, see "PrivateDevices" below, as it may change the setting of "DevicePolicy".  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>list</u> <u>of</u>
       <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>ExtensionDirectories</b>
       This setting is similar to "BindReadOnlyPaths" in that it mounts a file system hierarchy from a
       directory, but instead of providing a destination path, an overlay will be set up. This option expects a
       whitespace separated list of source directories.

       A read-only OverlayFS will be set up on top of "<a href="file:/usr/">/usr/</a>" and "<a href="file:/opt/">/opt/</a>" hierarchies for sysext images and
       "<a href="file:/etc/">/etc/</a>" hierarchy for confext images. The order in which the directories are listed will determine the
       order in which the overlay is laid down: directories specified first to last will result in overlayfs
       layers bottom to top.

       Each directory listed in "ExtensionDirectories" may be prefixed with "-", in which case it will be
       ignored when its source path does not exist. Any mounts created with this option are specific to the
       unit, and are not visible in the host's mount table.

       These settings may be used more than once, each usage appends to the unit's list of directories paths. If
       the empty string is assigned, the entire list of mount paths defined prior to this is reset.

       Each sysext directory must contain a "/usr/lib/extension-release.d/extension-release.IMAGE" file while
       each confext directory must carry a "/etc/extension-release.d/extension-release.IMAGE" file, with the
       appropriate metadata which matches "RootImage"/"RootDirectory" or the host. See: <b><a href="../man5/os-release.5.html">os-release</a></b>(5).

       Note that usage from user units requires overlayfs support in unprivileged user namespaces, which was
       first introduced in kernel v5.11.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>list</u> <u>of</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>User</b>
       Set the UNIX user or group that the processes are executed as, respectively. Takes a single user or group
       name, or a numeric ID as argument. For system services (services run by the system service manager, i.e.
       managed by PID 1) and for user services of the root user (services managed by root's instance of systemd
       --user), the default is "root", but "User" may be used to specify a different user. For user services of
       any other user, switching user identity is not permitted, hence the only valid setting is the same user
       the user's service manager is running as. If no group is set, the default group of the user is used. This
       setting does not affect commands whose command line is prefixed with "+".

       Note that this enforces only weak restrictions on the user/group name syntax, but will generate warnings
       in many cases where user/group names do not adhere to the following rules: the specified name should
       consist only of the characters a-z, A-Z, 0-9, "_" and "-", except for the first character which must be
       one of a-z, A-Z and "_" (i.e. digits and "-" are not permitted as first character). The user/group name
       must have at least one character, and at most 31. These restrictions are made in order to avoid
       ambiguities and to ensure user/group names and unit files remain portable among Linux systems. For
       further details on the names accepted and the names warned about see User/Group Name Syntax
       &lt;https://systemd.io/USER_NAMES&gt;.

       When used in conjunction with "DynamicUser" the user/group name specified is dynamically allocated at the
       time the service is started, and released at the time the service is stopped — unless it is already
       allocated statically (see below). If "DynamicUser" is not used the specified user and group must have
       been created statically in the user database no later than the moment the service is started, for example
       using the <b><a href="../man5/sysusers.d.5.html">sysusers.d</a></b>(5) facility, which is applied at boot or package install time. If the user does not
       exist by then program invocation will fail.

       If the "User" setting is used the supplementary group list is initialized from the specified user's
       default group list, as defined in the system's user and group database. Additional groups may be
       configured through the "SupplementaryGroups" setting (see below).  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>Group</b>
       Set the UNIX user or group that the processes are executed as, respectively. Takes a single user or group
       name, or a numeric ID as argument. For system services (services run by the system service manager, i.e.
       managed by PID 1) and for user services of the root user (services managed by root's instance of systemd
       --user), the default is "root", but "User" may be used to specify a different user. For user services of
       any other user, switching user identity is not permitted, hence the only valid setting is the same user
       the user's service manager is running as. If no group is set, the default group of the user is used. This
       setting does not affect commands whose command line is prefixed with "+".

       Note that this enforces only weak restrictions on the user/group name syntax, but will generate warnings
       in many cases where user/group names do not adhere to the following rules: the specified name should
       consist only of the characters a-z, A-Z, 0-9, "_" and "-", except for the first character which must be
       one of a-z, A-Z and "_" (i.e. digits and "-" are not permitted as first character). The user/group name
       must have at least one character, and at most 31. These restrictions are made in order to avoid
       ambiguities and to ensure user/group names and unit files remain portable among Linux systems. For
       further details on the names accepted and the names warned about see User/Group Name Syntax
       &lt;https://systemd.io/USER_NAMES&gt;.

       When used in conjunction with "DynamicUser" the user/group name specified is dynamically allocated at the
       time the service is started, and released at the time the service is stopped — unless it is already
       allocated statically (see below). If "DynamicUser" is not used the specified user and group must have
       been created statically in the user database no later than the moment the service is started, for example
       using the <b><a href="../man5/sysusers.d.5.html">sysusers.d</a></b>(5) facility, which is applied at boot or package install time. If the user does not
       exist by then program invocation will fail.

       If the "User" setting is used the supplementary group list is initialized from the specified user's
       default group list, as defined in the system's user and group database. Additional groups may be
       configured through the "SupplementaryGroups" setting (see below).  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>DynamicUser</b>
       Takes a boolean parameter. If set, a UNIX user and group pair is allocated dynamically when the unit is
       started, and released as soon as it is stopped. The user and group will not be added to "<a href="file:/etc/passwd">/etc/passwd</a>" or
       "<a href="file:/etc/group">/etc/group</a>", but are managed transiently during runtime. The <b><a href="../man8/nss-systemd.8.html">nss-systemd</a></b>(8) glibc NSS module provides
       integration of these dynamic users/groups into the system's user and group databases. The user and group
       name to use may be configured via "User" and "Group" (see above). If these options are not used and
       dynamic user/group allocation is enabled for a unit, the name of the dynamic user/group is implicitly
       derived from the unit name. If the unit name without the type suffix qualifies as valid user name it is
       used directly, otherwise a name incorporating a hash of it is used. If a statically allocated user or
       group of the configured name already exists, it is used and no dynamic user/group is allocated. Note that
       if "User" is specified and the static group with the name exists, then it is required that the static
       user with the name already exists. Similarly, if "Group" is specified and the static user with the name
       exists, then it is required that the static group with the name already exists. Dynamic users/groups are
       allocated from the UID/GID range 61184…65519. It is recommended to avoid this range for regular system or
       login users. At any point in time each UID/GID from this range is only assigned to zero or one
       dynamically allocated users/groups in use. However, UID/GIDs are recycled after a unit is terminated.
       Care should be taken that any processes running as part of a unit for which dynamic users/groups are
       enabled do not leave files or directories owned by these users/groups around, as a different unit might
       get the same UID/GID assigned later on, and thus gain access to these files or directories. If
       "DynamicUser" is enabled, "RemoveIPC" is implied (and cannot be turned off). This ensures that the
       lifetime of IPC objects and temporary files created by the executed processes is bound to the runtime of
       the service, and hence the lifetime of the dynamic user/group. Since "<a href="file:/tmp/">/tmp/</a>" and "<a href="file:/var/tmp/">/var/tmp/</a>" are usually
       the only world-writable directories on a system, unless "PrivateTmp" is manually set to "true",
       "disconnected" would be implied. This ensures that a unit making use of dynamic user/group allocation
       cannot leave files around after unit termination. Furthermore "NoNewPrivileges" and "RestrictSUIDSGID"
       are implicitly enabled (and cannot be disabled), to ensure that processes invoked cannot take benefit or
       create SUID/SGID files or directories. Moreover "ProtectSystem=strict" and "ProtectHome=read-only" are
       implied, thus prohibiting the service to write to arbitrary file system locations. In order to allow the
       service to write to certain directories, they have to be allow-listed using "ReadWritePaths", but care
       must be taken so that UID/GID recycling doesn't create security issues involving files created by the
       service. Use "RuntimeDirectory" (see below) in order to assign a writable runtime directory to a service,
       owned by the dynamic user/group and removed automatically when the unit is terminated. Use
       "StateDirectory", "CacheDirectory" and "LogsDirectory" in order to assign a set of writable directories
       for specific purposes to the service in a way that they are protected from vulnerabilities due to UID
       reuse (see below). If this option is enabled, care should be taken that the unit's processes do not get
       access to directories outside of these explicitly configured and managed ones. Specifically, do not use
       "BindPaths" and be careful with "AF_UNIX" file descriptor passing for directory file descriptors, as this
       would permit processes to create files or directories owned by the dynamic user/group that are not
       subject to the lifecycle and access guarantees of the service. Note that this option is currently
       incompatible with D-Bus policies, thus a service using this option may currently not allocate a D-Bus
       service name (note that this does not affect calling into other D-Bus services). Defaults to off.
       <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>boolean.</u>

   <b>SupplementaryGroups</b>
       Sets the supplementary Unix groups the processes are executed as. This takes a space-separated list of
       group names or IDs. This option may be specified more than once, in which case all listed groups are set
       as supplementary groups. When the empty string is assigned, the list of supplementary groups is reset,
       and all assignments prior to this one will have no effect. In any way, this option does not override, but
       extends the list of supplementary groups configured in the system group database for the user. This does
       not affect commands prefixed with "+".  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>list</u> <u>of</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>SetLoginEnvironment</b>
       Takes a boolean parameter that controls whether to set the $HOME, $LOGNAME, and $SHELL environment
       variables. If not set, this defaults to true if "User", "DynamicUser" or "PAMName" are set, false
       otherwise. If set to true, the variables will always be set for system services, i.e. even when the
       default user "root" is used. If set to false, the mentioned variables are not set by the service manager,
       no matter whether "User", "DynamicUser", or "PAMName" are used or not. This option normally has no effect
       on services of the per-user service manager, since in that case these variables are typically inherited
       from user manager's own environment anyway.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>boolean.</u>

   <b>PAMName</b>
       Sets the PAM service name to set up a session as. If set, the executed process will be registered as a
       PAM session under the specified service name. This is only useful in conjunction with the "User" setting,
       and is otherwise ignored. If not set, no PAM session will be opened for the executed processes. See
       <b><a href="../man8/pam.8.html">pam</a></b>(8) for details.

       Note that for each unit making use of this option a PAM session handler process will be maintained as
       part of the unit and stays around as long as the unit is active, to ensure that appropriate actions can
       be taken when the unit and hence the PAM session terminates. This process is named "(sd-pam)" and is an
       immediate child process of the unit's main process.

       Note that when this option is used for a unit it is very likely (depending on PAM configuration) that the
       main unit process will be migrated to its own session scope unit when it is activated. This process will
       hence be associated with two units: the unit it was originally started from (and for which "PAMName" was
       configured), and the session scope unit. Any child processes of that process will however be associated
       with the session scope unit only. This has implications when used in combination with
       "NotifyAccess"="all", as these child processes will not be able to affect changes in the original unit
       through notification messages. These messages will be considered belonging to the session scope unit and
       not the original unit. It is hence not recommended to use "PAMName" in combination with
       "NotifyAccess"="all".  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>CapabilityBoundingSet</b>
       Controls which capabilities to include in the capability bounding set for the executed process. See
       <b><a href="../man7/capabilities.7.html">capabilities</a></b>(7) for details. Takes a whitespace-separated list of capability names, e.g. "CAP_SYS_ADMIN",
       "CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE", "CAP_SYS_PTRACE". Capabilities listed will be included in the bounding set, all
       others are removed. If the list of capabilities is prefixed with "~", all but the listed capabilities
       will be included, the effect of the assignment inverted. Note that this option also affects the
       respective capabilities in the effective, permitted and inheritable capability sets. If this option is
       not used, the capability bounding set is not modified on process execution, hence no limits on the
       capabilities of the process are enforced. This option may appear more than once, in which case the
       bounding sets are merged by "OR", or by "AND" if the lines are prefixed with "~" (see below). If the
       empty string is assigned to this option, the bounding set is reset to the empty capability set, and all
       prior settings have no effect. If set to "~" (without any further argument), the bounding set is reset to
       the full set of available capabilities, also undoing any previous settings. This does not affect commands
       prefixed with "+".

       Use <b><a href="../man1/systemd-analyze.1.html">systemd-analyze</a></b>(1)'s capability command to retrieve a list of capabilities defined on the local
       system.

       Example: if a unit has the following,

           CapabilityBoundingSet=CAP_A CAP_B
           CapabilityBoundingSet=CAP_B CAP_C

       then "CAP_A", "CAP_B", and "CAP_C" are set. If the second line is prefixed with "~", e.g.,

           CapabilityBoundingSet=CAP_A CAP_B
           CapabilityBoundingSet=~CAP_B CAP_C

       then, only "CAP_A" is set.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>AmbientCapabilities</b>
       Controls which capabilities to include in the ambient capability set for the executed process. Takes a
       whitespace-separated list of capability names, e.g. "CAP_SYS_ADMIN", "CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE",
       "CAP_SYS_PTRACE". This option may appear more than once, in which case the ambient capability sets are
       merged (see the above examples in "CapabilityBoundingSet"). If the list of capabilities is prefixed with
       "~", all but the listed capabilities will be included, the effect of the assignment inverted. If the
       empty string is assigned to this option, the ambient capability set is reset to the empty capability set,
       and all prior settings have no effect. If set to "~" (without any further argument), the ambient
       capability set is reset to the full set of available capabilities, also undoing any previous settings.
       Note that adding capabilities to the ambient capability set adds them to the process's inherited
       capability set.

       Ambient capability sets are useful if you want to execute a process as a non-privileged user but still
       want to give it some capabilities. Note that in this case option "keep-caps" is automatically added to
       "SecureBits" to retain the capabilities over the user change. "AmbientCapabilities" does not affect
       commands prefixed with "+".  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>NoNewPrivileges</b>
       Takes a boolean argument. If true, ensures that the service process and all its children can never gain
       new privileges through <b>execve()</b> (e.g. via setuid or setgid bits, or filesystem capabilities). This is the
       simplest and most effective way to ensure that a process and its children can never elevate privileges
       again. Defaults to false. In case the service will be run in a new mount namespace anyway and SELinux is
       disabled, all file systems are mounted with "MS_NOSUID" flag. Also see No New Privileges Flag
       &lt;https://docs.kernel.org/userspace-api/no_new_privs.html&gt;.

       Note that this setting only has an effect on the unit's processes themselves (or any processes directly
       or indirectly forked off them). It has no effect on processes potentially invoked on request of them
       through tools such as <b><a href="../man1/at.1.html">at</a></b>(1), <b><a href="../man1/crontab.1.html">crontab</a></b>(1), <b><a href="../man1/systemd-run.1.html">systemd-run</a></b>(1), or arbitrary IPC services.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u>
       <u>boolean.</u>

   <b>SecureBits</b>
       Controls the secure bits set for the executed process. Takes a space-separated combination of options
       from the following list: "keep-caps", "keep-caps-locked", "no-setuid-fixup", "no-setuid-fixup-locked",
       "noroot", and "noroot-locked". This option may appear more than once, in which case the secure bits are
       ORed. If the empty string is assigned to this option, the bits are reset to 0. This does not affect
       commands prefixed with "+". See <b><a href="../man7/capabilities.7.html">capabilities</a></b>(7) for details.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>SELinuxContext</b>
       Set the SELinux security context of the executed process. If set, this will override the automated domain
       transition. However, the policy still needs to authorize the transition. This directive is ignored if
       SELinux is disabled. If prefixed by "-", failing to set the SELinux security context will be ignored, but
       it's still possible that the subsequent <b>execve()</b> may fail if the policy doesn't allow the transition for
       the non-overridden context. This does not affect commands prefixed with "+". See <b><a href="../man3/setexeccon.3.html">setexeccon</a></b>(3) for
       details.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>AppArmorProfile</b>
       Takes a profile name as argument. The process executed by the unit will switch to this profile when
       started. Profiles must already be loaded in the kernel, or the unit will fail. If prefixed by "-", all
       errors will be ignored. This setting has no effect if AppArmor is not enabled. This setting does not
       affect commands prefixed with "+".  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>SmackProcessLabel</b>
       Takes a "SMACK64" security label as argument. The process executed by the unit will be started under this
       label and SMACK will decide whether the process is allowed to run or not, based on it. The process will
       continue to run under the label specified here unless the executable has its own "SMACK64EXEC" label, in
       which case the process will transition to run under that label. When not specified, the label that
       systemd is running under is used. This directive is ignored if SMACK is disabled.

       The value may be prefixed by "-", in which case all errors will be ignored. An empty value may be
       specified to unset previous assignments. This does not affect commands prefixed with "+".  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u>
       <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>LimitCPU</b>
       Set soft and hard limits on various resources for executed processes. See <b><a href="../man2/setrlimit.2.html">setrlimit</a></b>(2) for details on the
       process resource limit concept. Process resource limits may be specified in two formats: either as single
       value to set a specific soft and hard limit to the same value, or as colon-separated pair "soft:hard" to
       set both limits individually (e.g. "LimitAS=4G:16G").  Use the string "infinity" to configure no limit on
       a specific resource. The multiplicative suffixes K, M, G, T, P and E (to the base 1024) may be used for
       resource limits measured in bytes (e.g. "LimitAS=16G"). For the limits referring to time values, the
       usual time units ms, s, min, h and so on may be used (see <b><a href="../man7/systemd.time.7.html">systemd.time</a></b>(7) for details). Note that if no
       time unit is specified for "LimitCPU" the default unit of seconds is implied, while for "LimitRTTIME" the
       default unit of microseconds is implied. Also, note that the effective granularity of the limits might
       influence their enforcement. For example, time limits specified for "LimitCPU" will be rounded up
       implicitly to multiples of 1s. For "LimitNICE" the value may be specified in two syntaxes: if prefixed
       with "+" or "-", the value is understood as regular Linux nice value in the range -20…19. If not prefixed
       like this the value is understood as raw resource limit parameter in the range 0…40 (with 0 being
       equivalent to 1).

       Note that most process resource limits configured with these options are per-process, and processes may
       fork in order to acquire a new set of resources that are accounted independently of the original process,
       and may thus escape limits set. Also note that "LimitRSS" is not implemented on Linux, and setting it has
       no effect. Often it is advisable to prefer the resource controls listed in <b><a href="../man5/systemd.resource-control.5.html">systemd.resource-control</a></b>(5)
       over these per-process limits, as they apply to services as a whole, may be altered dynamically at
       runtime, and are generally more expressive. For example, "MemoryMax" is a more powerful (and working)
       replacement for "LimitRSS".

       Note that "LimitNPROC" will limit the number of processes from one (real) UID and not the number of
       processes started (forked) by the service. Therefore the limit is cumulative for all processes running
       under the same UID. Please also note that the "LimitNPROC" will not be enforced if the service is running
       as root (and not dropping privileges). Due to these limitations, "TasksMax" (see
       <b><a href="../man5/systemd.resource-control.5.html">systemd.resource-control</a></b>(5)) is typically a better choice than "LimitNPROC".

       Resource limits not configured explicitly for a unit default to the value configured in the various
       "DefaultLimitCPU", "DefaultLimitFSIZE", … options available in <b><a href="../man5/systemd-system.conf.5.html">systemd-system.conf</a></b>(5), and – if not
       configured there – the kernel or per-user defaults, as defined by the OS (the latter only for user
       services, see below).

       For system units these resource limits may be chosen freely. When these settings are configured in a user
       service (i.e. a service run by the per-user instance of the service manager) they cannot be used to raise
       the limits above those set for the user manager itself when it was first invoked, as the user's service
       manager generally lacks the privileges to do so. In user context these configuration options are hence
       only useful to lower the limits passed in or to raise the soft limit to the maximum of the hard limit as
       configured for the user. To raise the user's limits further, the available configuration mechanisms
       differ between operating systems, but typically require privileges. In most cases it is possible to
       configure higher per-user resource limits via PAM or by setting limits on the system service
       encapsulating the user's service manager, i.e. the user's instance of "user@.service". After making such
       changes, make sure to restart the user's service manager.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>LimitFSIZE</b>

       For system units these resource limits may be chosen freely. When these settings are configured in a user
       service (i.e. a service run by the per-user instance of the service manager) they cannot be used to raise

       only useful to lower the limits passed in or to raise the soft limit to the maximum of the hard limit as
       configured for the user. To raise the user's limits further, the available configuration mechanisms
       differ between operating systems, but typically require privileges. In most cases it is possible to
       configure higher per-user resource limits via PAM or by setting limits on the system service

   <b>LimitRSS</b>
       Set soft and hard limits on various resources for executed processes. See <b><a href="../man2/setrlimit.2.html">setrlimit</a></b>(2) for details on the
       process resource limit concept. Process resource limits may be specified in two formats: either as single
       value to set a specific soft and hard limit to the same value, or as colon-separated pair "soft:hard" to
       set both limits individually (e.g. "LimitAS=4G:16G").  Use the string "infinity" to configure no limit on
       a specific resource. The multiplicative suffixes K, M, G, T, P and E (to the base 1024) may be used for
       resource limits measured in bytes (e.g. "LimitAS=16G"). For the limits referring to time values, the
       usual time units ms, s, min, h and so on may be used (see <b><a href="../man7/systemd.time.7.html">systemd.time</a></b>(7) for details). Note that if no
       time unit is specified for "LimitCPU" the default unit of seconds is implied, while for "LimitRTTIME" the
       default unit of microseconds is implied. Also, note that the effective granularity of the limits might
       influence their enforcement. For example, time limits specified for "LimitCPU" will be rounded up
       implicitly to multiples of 1s. For "LimitNICE" the value may be specified in two syntaxes: if prefixed
       with "+" or "-", the value is understood as regular Linux nice value in the range -20…19. If not prefixed
       like this the value is understood as raw resource limit parameter in the range 0…40 (with 0 being
       equivalent to 1).

       Note that most process resource limits configured with these options are per-process, and processes may
       fork in order to acquire a new set of resources that are accounted independently of the original process,
       and may thus escape limits set. Also note that "LimitRSS" is not implemented on Linux, and setting it has
       no effect. Often it is advisable to prefer the resource controls listed in <b><a href="../man5/systemd.resource-control.5.html">systemd.resource-control</a></b>(5)
       over these per-process limits, as they apply to services as a whole, may be altered dynamically at

   <b>LimitSIGPENDING</b>
       Set soft and hard limits on various resources for executed processes. See <b><a href="../man2/setrlimit.2.html">setrlimit</a></b>(2) for details on the
       process resource limit concept. Process resource limits may be specified in two formats: either as single
       value to set a specific soft and hard limit to the same value, or as colon-separated pair "soft:hard" to
       set both limits individually (e.g. "LimitAS=4G:16G").  Use the string "infinity" to configure no limit on
       a specific resource. The multiplicative suffixes K, M, G, T, P and E (to the base 1024) may be used for
       resource limits measured in bytes (e.g. "LimitAS=16G"). For the limits referring to time values, the
       usual time units ms, s, min, h and so on may be used (see <b><a href="../man7/systemd.time.7.html">systemd.time</a></b>(7) for details). Note that if no
       time unit is specified for "LimitCPU" the default unit of seconds is implied, while for "LimitRTTIME" the
       default unit of microseconds is implied. Also, note that the effective granularity of the limits might
       influence their enforcement. For example, time limits specified for "LimitCPU" will be rounded up
       implicitly to multiples of 1s. For "LimitNICE" the value may be specified in two syntaxes: if prefixed
       with "+" or "-", the value is understood as regular Linux nice value in the range -20…19. If not prefixed
       like this the value is understood as raw resource limit parameter in the range 0…40 (with 0 being
       equivalent to 1).

       Note that most process resource limits configured with these options are per-process, and processes may
       fork in order to acquire a new set of resources that are accounted independently of the original process,
       and may thus escape limits set. Also note that "LimitRSS" is not implemented on Linux, and setting it has
       no effect. Often it is advisable to prefer the resource controls listed in <b><a href="../man5/systemd.resource-control.5.html">systemd.resource-control</a></b>(5)
       over these per-process limits, as they apply to services as a whole, may be altered dynamically at
       runtime, and are generally more expressive. For example, "MemoryMax" is a more powerful (and working)
       replacement for "LimitRSS".

       Note that "LimitNPROC" will limit the number of processes from one (real) UID and not the number of
       processes started (forked) by the service. Therefore the limit is cumulative for all processes running
       under the same UID. Please also note that the "LimitNPROC" will not be enforced if the service is running
       as root (and not dropping privileges). Due to these limitations, "TasksMax" (see
       <b><a href="../man5/systemd.resource-control.5.html">systemd.resource-control</a></b>(5)) is typically a better choice than "LimitNPROC".

   <b>UMask</b>
       Controls the file mode creation mask. Takes an access mode in octal notation. See <b><a href="../man2/umask.2.html">umask</a></b>(2) for details.
       Defaults to 0022 for system units. For user units the default value is inherited from the per-user
       service manager (whose default is in turn inherited from the system service manager, and thus typically
       also is 0022 — unless overridden by a PAM module). In order to change the per-user mask for all user
       services, consider setting the "UMask" setting of the user's "user@.service" system service instance. The
       per-user umask may also be set via the "umask" field of a user's JSON User Record
       &lt;https://systemd.io/USER_RECORD&gt; (for users managed by <b><a href="../man8/systemd-homed.service.8.html">systemd-homed.service</a></b>(8) this field may be
       controlled via homectl --umask=). It may also be set via a PAM module, such as <b><a href="../man8/pam_umask.8.html">pam_umask</a></b>(8).  <u>Optional.</u>
       <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>CoredumpFilter</b>
       Controls which types of memory mappings will be saved if the process dumps core (using the
       "/proc/pid/coredump_filter" file). Takes a whitespace-separated combination of mapping type names or
       numbers (with the default base 16). Mapping type names are "private-anonymous", "shared-anonymous",
       "private-file-backed", "shared-file-backed", "elf-headers", "private-huge", "shared-huge", "private-dax",
       "shared-dax", and the special values "all" (all types) and "default" (the kernel default of
       "private-anonymous""shared-anonymous" "elf-headers""private-huge"). See <b><a href="../man5/core.5.html">core</a></b>(5) for the meaning of the
       mapping types. When specified multiple times, all specified masks are ORed. When not set, or if the empty
       value is assigned, the inherited value is not changed.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>KeyringMode</b>
       Controls how the kernel session keyring is set up for the service (see <b><a href="../man7/session-keyring.7.html">session-keyring</a></b>(7) for details on
       the session keyring). Takes one of "inherit", "private", "shared". If set to "inherit" no special keyring
       setup is done, and the kernel's default behaviour is applied. If "private" is used a new session keyring
       is allocated when a service process is invoked, and it is not linked up with any user keyring. This is
       the recommended setting for system services, as this ensures that multiple services running under the
       same system user ID (in particular the root user) do not share their key material among each other. If
       "shared" is used a new session keyring is allocated as for "private", but the user keyring of the user
       configured with "User" is linked into it, so that keys assigned to the user may be requested by the
       unit's processes. In this mode multiple units running processes under the same user ID may share key
       material. Unless "inherit" is selected the unique invocation ID for the unit (see below) is added as a
       protected key by the name "invocation_id" to the newly created session keyring. Defaults to "private" for
       services of the system service manager and to "inherit" for non-service units and for services of the
       user service manager.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>enum.</u> <u>choice:</u> <u>'inherit',</u> <u>'private',</u> <u>'shared'.</u>

   <b>OOMScoreAdjust</b>
       Sets the adjustment value for the Linux kernel's Out-Of-Memory (OOM) killer score for executed processes.
       Takes an integer between -1000 (to disable OOM killing of processes of this unit) and 1000 (to make
       killing of processes of this unit under memory pressure very likely). See The <a href="file:/proc">/proc</a> Filesystem
       &lt;https://docs.kernel.org/filesystems/proc.html&gt; for details. If not specified defaults to the OOM score
       adjustment level of the service manager itself, which is normally at 0.

       Use the "OOMPolicy" setting of service units to configure how the service manager shall react to the
       kernel OOM killer or systemd-oomd terminating a process of the service. See <b><a href="../man5/systemd.service.5.html">systemd.service</a></b>(5) for
       details.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>integer.</u>

   <b>TimerSlackNSec</b>
       Sets the timer slack in nanoseconds for the executed processes. The timer slack controls the accuracy of
       wake-ups triggered by timers. See <b><a href="../man2/prctl.2.html">prctl</a></b>(2) for more information. Note that in contrast to most other time
       span definitions this parameter takes an integer value in nano-seconds if no unit is specified. The usual
       time units are understood too.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>Personality</b>
       Controls which kernel architecture <b><a href="../man2/uname.2.html">uname</a></b>(2) shall report, when invoked by unit processes. Takes one of
       the architecture identifiers "arm64", "arm64-be", "arm", "arm-be", "x86", "x86-64", "ppc", "ppc-le",
       "ppc64", "ppc64-le", "s390" or "s390x". Which personality architectures are supported depends on the
       kernel's native architecture. Usually the 64-bit versions of the various system architectures support
       their immediate 32-bit personality architecture counterpart, but no others. For example, "x86-64" systems
       support the "x86-64" and "x86" personalities but no others. The personality feature is useful when
       running 32-bit services on a 64-bit host system. If not specified, the personality is left unmodified and
       thus reflects the personality of the host system's kernel. This option is not useful on architectures for
       which only one native word width was ever available, such as "m68k" (32-bit only) or "alpha" (64-bit
       only).  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>enum.</u> <u>choice:</u> <u>'arm',</u> <u>'arm-be',</u> <u>'arm64',</u> <u>'arm64-be',</u> <u>'ppc',</u> <u>'ppc-le',</u> <u>'ppc64',</u>
       <u>'ppc64-le',</u> <u>'s390',</u> <u>'s390x',</u> <u>'x86',</u> <u>'x86-64'.</u>

   <b>IgnoreSIGPIPE</b>
       Takes a boolean argument. If true, "SIGPIPE" is ignored in the executed process. Defaults to true since
       "SIGPIPE" is generally only useful in shell pipelines.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>boolean.</u>

   <b>Nice</b>
       Sets the default nice level (scheduling priority) for executed processes. Takes an integer between -20
       (highest priority) and 19 (lowest priority). In case of resource contention, smaller values mean more
       resources will be made available to the unit's processes, larger values mean less resources will be made
       available. See <b><a href="../man2/setpriority.2.html">setpriority</a></b>(2) for details.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>integer.</u>

   <b>CPUSchedulingPolicy</b>
       Sets the CPU scheduling policy for executed processes. Takes one of "other", "batch", "idle", "fifo" or
       "rr". See <b><a href="../man2/sched_setscheduler.2.html">sched_setscheduler</a></b>(2) for details.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>enum.</u> <u>choice:</u> <u>'batch',</u> <u>'fifo',</u> <u>'idle',</u>
       <u>'other',</u> <u>'rr'.</u>

   <b>CPUSchedulingPriority</b>
       Sets the CPU scheduling priority for executed processes. The available priority range depends on the
       selected CPU scheduling policy (see above). For real-time scheduling policies an integer between 1
       (lowest priority) and 99 (highest priority) can be used. In case of CPU resource contention, smaller
       values mean less CPU time is made available to the service, larger values mean more. See
       <b><a href="../man2/sched_setscheduler.2.html">sched_setscheduler</a></b>(2) for details.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>CPUSchedulingResetOnFork</b>
       Takes a boolean argument. If true, elevated CPU scheduling priorities and policies will be reset when the
       executed processes call <b><a href="../man2/fork.2.html">fork</a></b>(2), and can hence not leak into child processes. See <b><a href="../man2/sched_setscheduler.2.html">sched_setscheduler</a></b>(2)
       for details. Defaults to false.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>boolean.</u>

   <b>CPUAffinity</b>
       Controls the CPU affinity of the executed processes. Takes a list of CPU indices or ranges separated by
       either whitespace or commas. Alternatively, takes a special "numa" value in which case systemd
       automatically derives allowed CPU range based on the value of "NUMAMask" option. CPU ranges are specified
       by the lower and upper CPU indices separated by a dash. This option may be specified more than once, in
       which case the specified CPU affinity masks are merged. If the empty string is assigned, the mask is
       reset, all assignments prior to this will have no effect. See <b><a href="../man2/sched_setaffinity.2.html">sched_setaffinity</a></b>(2) for details.
       <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>list</u> <u>of</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>NUMAPolicy</b>
       Controls the NUMA memory policy of the executed processes. Takes a policy type, one of: "default",
       "preferred", "bind", "interleave" and "local". A list of NUMA nodes that should be associated with the
       policy must be specified in "NUMAMask". For more details on each policy please see, <b><a href="../man2/set_mempolicy.2.html">set_mempolicy</a></b>(2). For
       overall overview of NUMA support in Linux see, <b><a href="../man7/numa.7.html">numa</a></b>(7).   <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>NUMAMask</b>
       Controls the NUMA node list which will be applied alongside with selected NUMA policy.  Takes a list of
       NUMA nodes and has the same syntax as a list of CPUs for "CPUAffinity" option or special "all" value
       which will include all available NUMA nodes in the mask. Note that the list of NUMA nodes is not required
       for "default" and "local" policies and for "preferred" policy we expect a single NUMA node.  <u>Optional.</u>
       <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>IOSchedulingClass</b>
       Sets the I/O scheduling class for executed processes. Takes one of the strings "realtime", "best-effort"
       or "idle". The kernel's default scheduling class is "best-effort" at a priority of 4. If the empty string
       is assigned to this option, all prior assignments to both "IOSchedulingClass" and "IOSchedulingPriority"
       have no effect. See <b><a href="../man2/ioprio_set.2.html">ioprio_set</a></b>(2) for details.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>enum.</u> <u>choice:</u> <u>'0',</u> <u>'1',</u> <u>'2',</u> <u>'3',</u> <u>'none',</u>
       <u>'realtime',</u> <u>'best-effort',</u> <u>'idle'.</u>

   <b>IOSchedulingPriority</b>
       Sets the I/O scheduling priority for executed processes. Takes an integer between 0 (highest priority)
       and 7 (lowest priority). In case of I/O contention, smaller values mean more I/O bandwidth is made
       available to the unit's processes, larger values mean less bandwidth. The available priorities depend on
       the selected I/O scheduling class (see above). If the empty string is assigned to this option, all prior
       assignments to both "IOSchedulingClass" and "IOSchedulingPriority" have no effect. For the kernel's
       default scheduling class ("best-effort") this defaults to 4. See <b><a href="../man2/ioprio_set.2.html">ioprio_set</a></b>(2) for details.  <u>Optional.</u>
       <u>Type</u> <u>integer.</u>

       upstream_default value :
           4

   <b>ProtectSystem</b>
       Takes  a  boolean  argument or the special values "full" or "strict". If true, mounts the "<a href="file:/usr/">/usr/</a>" and the
       boot loader directories ("<a href="file:/boot">/boot</a>" and "/efi") read-only for processes invoked by  this  unit.  If  set  to
       "full",  the  "<a href="file:/etc/">/etc/</a>"  directory  is  mounted  read-only,  too. If set to "strict" the entire file system
       hierarchy is mounted read-only, except for the API file system subtrees  "<a href="file:/dev/">/dev/</a>",  "<a href="file:/proc/">/proc/</a>"  and  "<a href="file:/sys/">/sys/</a>"
       (protect these directories using "PrivateDevices", "ProtectKernelTunables", "ProtectControlGroups"). This
       setting  ensures  that  any  modification  of  the  vendor-supplied  operating system (and optionally its
       configuration, and local mounts) is prohibited for the service. It is recommended to enable this  setting
       for  all  long-running  services,  unless  they  are  involved  with system updates or need to modify the
       operating system in other ways. If this option is used, "ReadWritePaths" may be used to exclude  specific
       directories  from  being  made  read-only.  Similar,  "StateDirectory",  "LogsDirectory",  …  and related
       directory settings (see below) also exclude the specific directories from the effect of  "ProtectSystem".
       This  setting  is implied if "DynamicUser" is set. This setting cannot ensure protection in all cases. In
       general it has the same limitations as "ReadOnlyPaths", see below. Defaults to off.

       Note that if "ProtectSystem" is set to "strict" and "PrivateTmp" is enabled, then "<a href="file:/tmp/">/tmp/</a>" and "<a href="file:/var/tmp/">/var/tmp/</a>"
       will be writable.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>enum.</u> <u>choice:</u> <u>'full',</u> <u>'no',</u> <u>'strict',</u> <u>'yes'.</u>

   <b>ProtectHome</b>
       Takes a boolean argument or the special values "read-only" or "tmpfs". If true, the directories "<a href="file:/home/">/home/</a>",
       "<a href="file:/root">/root</a>", and "<a href="file:/run/user">/run/user</a>" are made inaccessible and empty for processes invoked by this unit.  If  set  to
       "read-only",  the three directories are made read-only instead. If set to "tmpfs", temporary file systems
       are mounted on the three directories in read-only  mode.  The  value  "tmpfs"  is  useful  to  hide  home
       directories not relevant to the processes invoked by the unit, while still allowing necessary directories
       to be made visible when listed in "BindPaths" or "BindReadOnlyPaths".

       Setting  this  to  "yes"  is  mostly  equivalent to setting the three directories in "InaccessiblePaths".
       Similarly, "read-only" is mostly equivalent to "ReadOnlyPaths",  and  "tmpfs"  is  mostly  equivalent  to
       "TemporaryFileSystem" with ":ro".

       It  is  recommended  to  enable  this setting for all long-running services (in particular network-facing
       ones), to ensure they cannot get access to private user data, unless the services actually require access
       to the user's private data. This setting is implied if "DynamicUser" is set. This setting  cannot  ensure
       protection in all cases. In general it has the same limitations as "ReadOnlyPaths", see below.  <u>Optional.</u>
       <u>Type</u> <u>enum.</u> <u>choice:</u> <u>'no',</u> <u>'read-only',</u> <u>'tmpfs',</u> <u>'yes'.</u>

   <b>RuntimeDirectory</b>
       These  options take a whitespace-separated list of directory names. The specified directory names must be
       relative, and may not include "..". If set, when the unit is started, one  or  more  directories  by  the
       specified  names  will  be created (including their parents) below the locations defined in the following
       table. Also, the corresponding  environment  variable  will  be  defined  with  the  full  paths  of  the
       directories. If multiple directories are set, then in the environment variable the paths are concatenated
       with colon (":").

       If    "DynamicUser"    is    used,    and    if    the   kernel   version   supports   id-mapped   mounts
       &lt;https://lwn.net/Articles/896255/&gt;, the specified directories will be  owned  by  "nobody"  in  the  host
       namespace  and  will  be mapped to (and will be owned by) the service's UID/GID in its own namespace. For
       backward compatibility, existing directories created without id-mapped mounts will be kept untouched.

       In case of "RuntimeDirectory" the innermost subdirectories are removed when the unit is  stopped.  It  is
       possible  to  preserve the specified directories in this case if "RuntimeDirectoryPreserve" is configured
       to "restart" or "yes" (see below). The directories  specified  with  "StateDirectory",  "CacheDirectory",
       "LogsDirectory", "ConfigurationDirectory" are not removed when the unit is stopped.

       Except in case of "ConfigurationDirectory", the innermost specified directories will be owned by the user
       and  group  specified  in "User" and "Group". If the specified directories already exist and their owning
       user or group do not match the configured ones, all files and directories below the specified directories
       as well as the directories themselves will have their file ownership recursively changed to match what is
       configured. As an optimization, if the specified directories are already owned  by  the  right  user  and
       group,  files  and directories below of them are left as-is, even if they do not match what is requested.
       The innermost specified directories will have their access mode adjusted to  the  what  is  specified  in
       "RuntimeDirectoryMode",     "StateDirectoryMode",     "CacheDirectoryMode",    "LogsDirectoryMode"    and
       "ConfigurationDirectoryMode".

       These options  imply  "BindPaths"  for  the  specified  paths.  When  combined  with  "RootDirectory"  or
       "RootImage"  these paths always reside on the host and are mounted from there into the unit's file system
       namespace.

       If "DynamicUser" is used,  the  logic  for  "CacheDirectory",  "LogsDirectory"  and  "StateDirectory"  is
       slightly  altered:  the  directories  are  created  below  "<a href="file:/var/cache/private">/var/cache/private</a>",  "<a href="file:/var/log/private">/var/log/private</a>"  and
       "<a href="file:/var/lib/private">/var/lib/private</a>", respectively, which are host directories made  inaccessible  to  unprivileged  users,
       which  ensures  that  access  to  these  directories  cannot be gained through dynamic user ID recycling.
       Symbolic links are created to hide this difference in behaviour. Both from perspective of  the  host  and
       from  inside  the  unit,  the  relevant  directories  hence  always  appear  directly below "<a href="file:/var/cache">/var/cache</a>",
       "<a href="file:/var/log">/var/log</a>" and "<a href="file:/var/lib">/var/lib</a>".

       Use "RuntimeDirectory" to manage one or more runtime directories for the unit and bind their lifetime  to
       the  daemon  runtime.  This  is  particularly  useful for unprivileged daemons that cannot create runtime
       directories in "<a href="file:/run/">/run/</a>" due to lack of privileges, and to make sure the runtime directory  is  cleaned  up
       automatically  after use. For runtime directories that require more complex or different configuration or
       lifetime guarantees, please consider using <b><a href="../man5/tmpfiles.d.5.html">tmpfiles.d</a></b>(5).

       "RuntimeDirectory", "StateDirectory", "CacheDirectory" and "LogsDirectory"    optionally support two more
       parameters, separated by ":". The second parameter will be interpreted as a destination path that will be
       created as a  symlink  to  the  directory.  The  symlinks  will  be  created  after  any  "BindPaths"  or
       "TemporaryFileSystem"  options  have  been set up, to make ephemeral symlinking possible. The same source
       can have multiple symlinks, by using the same first parameter, but  a  different  second  parameter.  The
       third parameter is a flags field, and since v257 can take a value of "ro" to make the directory read only
       for  the  service.  This is also supported for "ConfigurationDirectory". If multiple symlinks are set up,
       the directory will be read only if at least one is configured to be read only. To pass a flag  without  a
       destination symlink, the second parameter can be empty, for example:

           ConfigurationDirectory=foo::ro

       The  directories  defined  by  these  options are always created under the standard paths used by systemd
       ("<a href="file:/var/">/var/</a>", "<a href="file:/run/">/run/</a>", "<a href="file:/etc/">/etc/</a>", …). If the service needs directories in a  different  location,  a  different
       mechanism has to be used to create them.

       <b><a href="../man5/tmpfiles.d.5.html">tmpfiles.d</a></b>(5)   provides  functionality  that  overlaps  with  these  options.  Using  these  options  is
       recommended, because the lifetime of the directories is tied directly to the lifetime of the unit, and it
       is not necessary to ensure that the "tmpfiles.d" configuration is executed before the unit is started.

       To remove any of the directories created by these settings, use the systemctl  clean  …  command  on  the
       relevant units, see <b><a href="../man1/systemctl.1.html">systemctl</a></b>(1) for details.

       Example: if a system service unit has the following,

           RuntimeDirectory=foo/bar baz

       the  service  manager  creates  "/run/foo"  (if  it  does not exist), "/run/foo/bar", and "/run/baz". The
       directories "/run/foo/bar" and "/run/baz" except "/run/foo" are owned by the user and group specified  in
       "User" and "Group", and removed when the service is stopped.

       Example: if a system service unit has the following,

           RuntimeDirectory=foo/bar
           StateDirectory=aaa/bbb ccc

       then  the  environment  variable "RUNTIME_DIRECTORY" is set with "/run/foo/bar", and "STATE_DIRECTORY" is
       set with "/var/lib/aaa/bbb:/var/lib/ccc".

       Example: if a system service unit has the following,

           RuntimeDirectory=foo:bar foo:baz

       the service manager creates "/run/foo" (if it does not exist), and "/run/bar" plus "/run/baz" as symlinks
       to "/run/foo".  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>StateDirectory</b>
       These options take a whitespace-separated list of directory names. The specified directory names must  be
       relative,  and  may  not  include  "..". If set, when the unit is started, one or more directories by the
       specified names will be created (including their parents) below the locations defined  in  the  following
       table.  Also,  the  corresponding  environment  variable  will  be  defined  with  the  full paths of the
       directories. If multiple directories are set, then in the environment variable the paths are concatenated
       with colon (":").

       If   "DynamicUser"   is   used,   and   if    the    kernel    version    supports    id-mapped    mounts
       &lt;https://lwn.net/Articles/896255/&gt;,  the  specified  directories  will  be  owned by "nobody" in the host
       namespace and will be mapped to (and will be owned by) the service's UID/GID in its  own  namespace.  For
       backward compatibility, existing directories created without id-mapped mounts will be kept untouched.

       In  case  of  "RuntimeDirectory" the innermost subdirectories are removed when the unit is stopped. It is
       possible to preserve the specified directories in this case if "RuntimeDirectoryPreserve"  is  configured
       to  "restart"  or  "yes"  (see below). The directories specified with "StateDirectory", "CacheDirectory",
       "LogsDirectory", "ConfigurationDirectory" are not removed when the unit is stopped.

       Except in case of "ConfigurationDirectory", the innermost specified directories will be owned by the user
       and group specified in "User" and "Group". If the specified directories already exist  and  their  owning
       user or group do not match the configured ones, all files and directories below the specified directories

       The  innermost  specified  directories  will  have their access mode adjusted to the what is specified in
       "RuntimeDirectoryMode",    "StateDirectoryMode",    "CacheDirectoryMode",     "LogsDirectoryMode"     and
       "ConfigurationDirectoryMode".

       These  options  imply  "BindPaths"  for  the  specified  paths.  When  combined  with  "RootDirectory" or
       "RootImage" these paths always reside on the host and are mounted from there into the unit's file  system
       namespace.

       If  "DynamicUser"  is  used,  the  logic  for  "CacheDirectory",  "LogsDirectory" and "StateDirectory" is
       slightly  altered:  the  directories  are  created  below  "<a href="file:/var/cache/private">/var/cache/private</a>",  "<a href="file:/var/log/private">/var/log/private</a>"  and
       "<a href="file:/var/lib/private">/var/lib/private</a>",  respectively,  which  are  host directories made inaccessible to unprivileged users,
       which ensures that access to these directories cannot  be  gained  through  dynamic  user  ID  recycling.
       Symbolic  links  are  created to hide this difference in behaviour. Both from perspective of the host and

       "<a href="file:/var/log">/var/log</a>" and "<a href="file:/var/lib">/var/lib</a>".

       Use  "RuntimeDirectory" to manage one or more runtime directories for the unit and bind their lifetime to
       the daemon runtime. This is particularly useful for  unprivileged  daemons  that  cannot  create  runtime
       directories  in  "<a href="file:/run/">/run/</a>"  due to lack of privileges, and to make sure the runtime directory is cleaned up
       automatically after use. For runtime directories that require more complex or different configuration  or
       lifetime guarantees, please consider using <b><a href="../man5/tmpfiles.d.5.html">tmpfiles.d</a></b>(5).

       "RuntimeDirectory", "StateDirectory", "CacheDirectory" and "LogsDirectory"    optionally support two more
       parameters, separated by ":". The second parameter will be interpreted as a destination path that will be
       created  as  a  symlink  to  the  directory.  The  symlinks  will  be  created  after  any "BindPaths" or
       "TemporaryFileSystem" options have been set up, to make ephemeral symlinking possible.  The  same  source
       can  have  multiple  symlinks,  by  using the same first parameter, but a different second parameter. The
       third parameter is a flags field, and since v257 can take a value of "ro" to make the directory read only
       for the service. This is also supported for "ConfigurationDirectory". If multiple symlinks  are  set  up,
       the  directory  will be read only if at least one is configured to be read only. To pass a flag without a
       destination symlink, the second parameter can be empty, for example:

           ConfigurationDirectory=foo::ro

       The directories defined by these options are always created under the  standard  paths  used  by  systemd
       ("<a href="file:/var/">/var/</a>",  "<a href="file:/run/">/run/</a>",  "<a href="file:/etc/">/etc/</a>",  …).  If the service needs directories in a different location, a different
       mechanism has to be used to create them.

       <b><a href="../man5/tmpfiles.d.5.html">tmpfiles.d</a></b>(5)  provides  functionality  that  overlaps  with  these  options.  Using  these  options   is
       recommended, because the lifetime of the directories is tied directly to the lifetime of the unit, and it
       is not necessary to ensure that the "tmpfiles.d" configuration is executed before the unit is started.

       To  remove  any  of  the  directories created by these settings, use the systemctl clean … command on the
       relevant units, see <b><a href="../man1/systemctl.1.html">systemctl</a></b>(1) for details.

       Example: if a system service unit has the following,

           RuntimeDirectory=foo/bar baz

       the service manager creates "/run/foo" (if it  does  not  exist),  "/run/foo/bar",  and  "/run/baz".  The
       directories  "/run/foo/bar" and "/run/baz" except "/run/foo" are owned by the user and group specified in
       "User" and "Group", and removed when the service is stopped.

       Example: if a system service unit has the following,

           RuntimeDirectory=foo/bar
           StateDirectory=aaa/bbb ccc

       then the environment variable "RUNTIME_DIRECTORY" is set with "/run/foo/bar",  and  "STATE_DIRECTORY"  is
       set with "/var/lib/aaa/bbb:/var/lib/ccc".

       Example: if a system service unit has the following,

           RuntimeDirectory=foo:bar foo:baz

       the service manager creates "/run/foo" (if it does not exist), and "/run/bar" plus "/run/baz" as symlinks
       to "/run/foo".  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

       These  options take a whitespace-separated list of directory names. The specified directory names must be
       relative, and may not include "..". If set, when the unit is started, one  or  more  directories  by  the
       specified  names  will  be created (including their parents) below the locations defined in the following
       table. Also, the corresponding  environment  variable  will  be  defined  with  the  full  paths  of  the
       directories. If multiple directories are set, then in the environment variable the paths are concatenated
       with colon (":").

       If    "DynamicUser"    is    used,    and    if    the   kernel   version   supports   id-mapped   mounts
       &lt;https://lwn.net/Articles/896255/&gt;, the specified directories will be  owned  by  "nobody"  in  the  host
       namespace  and  will  be mapped to (and will be owned by) the service's UID/GID in its own namespace. For
       backward compatibility, existing directories created without id-mapped mounts will be kept untouched.

       In case of "RuntimeDirectory" the innermost subdirectories are removed when the unit is  stopped.  It  is
       possible  to  preserve the specified directories in this case if "RuntimeDirectoryPreserve" is configured
       to "restart" or "yes" (see below). The directories  specified  with  "StateDirectory",  "CacheDirectory",
       "LogsDirectory", "ConfigurationDirectory" are not removed when the unit is stopped.

       Except in case of "ConfigurationDirectory", the innermost specified directories will be owned by the user
       and  group  specified  in "User" and "Group". If the specified directories already exist and their owning
       user or group do not match the configured ones, all files and directories below the specified directories
       as well as the directories themselves will have their file ownership recursively changed to match what is
       configured. As an optimization, if the specified directories are already owned  by  the  right  user  and
       group,  files  and directories below of them are left as-is, even if they do not match what is requested.
       The innermost specified directories will have their access mode adjusted to  the  what  is  specified  in
       "RuntimeDirectoryMode",     "StateDirectoryMode",     "CacheDirectoryMode",    "LogsDirectoryMode"    and
       "ConfigurationDirectoryMode".

       These options  imply  "BindPaths"  for  the  specified  paths.  When  combined  with  "RootDirectory"  or
       "RootImage"  these paths always reside on the host and are mounted from there into the unit's file system
       namespace.

       If "DynamicUser" is used,  the  logic  for  "CacheDirectory",  "LogsDirectory"  and  "StateDirectory"  is
       slightly  altered:  the  directories  are  created  below  "<a href="file:/var/cache/private">/var/cache/private</a>",  "<a href="file:/var/log/private">/var/log/private</a>"  and
       "<a href="file:/var/lib/private">/var/lib/private</a>", respectively, which are host directories made  inaccessible  to  unprivileged  users,
       which  ensures  that  access  to  these  directories  cannot be gained through dynamic user ID recycling.
       Symbolic links are created to hide this difference in behaviour. Both from perspective of  the  host  and
       from  inside  the  unit,  the  relevant  directories  hence  always  appear  directly below "<a href="file:/var/cache">/var/cache</a>",
       "<a href="file:/var/log">/var/log</a>" and "<a href="file:/var/lib">/var/lib</a>".

       Use "RuntimeDirectory" to manage one or more runtime directories for the unit and bind their lifetime  to
       the  daemon  runtime.  This  is  particularly  useful for unprivileged daemons that cannot create runtime
       directories in "<a href="file:/run/">/run/</a>" due to lack of privileges, and to make sure the runtime directory  is  cleaned  up
       automatically  after use. For runtime directories that require more complex or different configuration or
       lifetime guarantees, please consider using <b><a href="../man5/tmpfiles.d.5.html">tmpfiles.d</a></b>(5).

       "RuntimeDirectory", "StateDirectory", "CacheDirectory" and "LogsDirectory"    optionally support two more
       parameters, separated by ":". The second parameter will be interpreted as a destination path that will be
       created as a  symlink  to  the  directory.  The  symlinks  will  be  created  after  any  "BindPaths"  or
       "TemporaryFileSystem"  options  have  been set up, to make ephemeral symlinking possible. The same source
       can have multiple symlinks, by using the same first parameter, but  a  different  second  parameter.  The
       third parameter is a flags field, and since v257 can take a value of "ro" to make the directory read only
       for  the  service.  This is also supported for "ConfigurationDirectory". If multiple symlinks are set up,
       the directory will be read only if at least one is configured to be read only. To pass a flag  without  a
       destination symlink, the second parameter can be empty, for example:

           ConfigurationDirectory=foo::ro

       The  directories  defined  by  these  options are always created under the standard paths used by systemd
       ("<a href="file:/var/">/var/</a>", "<a href="file:/run/">/run/</a>", "<a href="file:/etc/">/etc/</a>", …). If the service needs directories in a  different  location,  a  different
       mechanism has to be used to create them.

       <b><a href="../man5/tmpfiles.d.5.html">tmpfiles.d</a></b>(5)   provides  functionality  that  overlaps  with  these  options.  Using  these  options  is
       recommended, because the lifetime of the directories is tied directly to the lifetime of the unit, and it
       is not necessary to ensure that the "tmpfiles.d" configuration is executed before the unit is started.

       To remove any of the directories created by these settings, use the systemctl  clean  …  command  on  the
       relevant units, see <b><a href="../man1/systemctl.1.html">systemctl</a></b>(1) for details.

       Example: if a system service unit has the following,

           RuntimeDirectory=foo/bar baz

       the  service  manager  creates  "/run/foo"  (if  it  does not exist), "/run/foo/bar", and "/run/baz". The
       directories "/run/foo/bar" and "/run/baz" except "/run/foo" are owned by the user and group specified  in
       "User" and "Group", and removed when the service is stopped.

       Example: if a system service unit has the following,

           RuntimeDirectory=foo/bar
           StateDirectory=aaa/bbb ccc

       then  the  environment  variable "RUNTIME_DIRECTORY" is set with "/run/foo/bar", and "STATE_DIRECTORY" is
       set with "/var/lib/aaa/bbb:/var/lib/ccc".

       Example: if a system service unit has the following,

           RuntimeDirectory=foo:bar foo:baz

       the service manager creates "/run/foo" (if it does not exist), and "/run/bar" plus "/run/baz" as symlinks
       to "/run/foo".  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>LogsDirectory</b>
       These options take a whitespace-separated list of directory names. The specified directory names must  be
       relative,  and  may  not  include  "..". If set, when the unit is started, one or more directories by the
       specified names will be created (including their parents) below the locations defined  in  the  following
       table.  Also,  the  corresponding  environment  variable  will  be  defined  with  the  full paths of the

   <b>ReadWritePaths</b>
       Sets  up  a new file system namespace for executed processes. These options may be used to limit access a

       root directory (i.e. the system running the service manager). Note that if paths contain  symlinks,  they
       are resolved relative to the root directory set with "RootDirectory"/"RootImage".

       Paths  listed  in "ReadWritePaths" are accessible from within the namespace with the same access modes as
       from outside of it. Paths listed in "ReadOnlyPaths" are accessible for  reading  only,  writing  will  be
       refused  even  if  the  usual  file  access  controls  would permit this. Nest "ReadWritePaths" inside of
       "ReadOnlyPaths"  in  order  to  provide  writable  subdirectories  within  read-only   directories.   Use
       "ReadWritePaths"  in  order  to  allow-list  specific paths for write access if "ProtectSystem=strict" is
       used. Note that "ReadWritePaths" cannot be used to gain write access to a file system whose superblock is
       mounted read-only. On Linux, for each mount point write access is granted only if the mount point  itself
       and  the  file  system superblock backing it are not marked read-only. "ReadWritePaths" only controls the
       former, not the latter, hence a read-only file system superblock remains protected.

       Paths listed in "InaccessiblePaths" will be made inaccessible for processes inside  the  namespace  along
       with  everything  below  them  in  the  file system hierarchy. This may be more restrictive than desired,
       because it is not possible to nest "ReadWritePaths", "ReadOnlyPaths", "BindPaths", or "BindReadOnlyPaths"
       inside it. For a more flexible option, see "TemporaryFileSystem".

       Content in paths listed in "NoExecPaths" are not executable even if the usual file access controls  would
       permit  this. Nest "ExecPaths" inside of "NoExecPaths" in order to provide executable content within non-
       executable directories.

       Non-directory paths may be specified as well. These options may be specified more  than  once,  in  which
       case all paths listed will have limited access from within the namespace. If the empty string is assigned
       to this option, the specific list is reset, and all prior assignments have no effect.

       Paths  in  "ReadWritePaths",  "ReadOnlyPaths",  "InaccessiblePaths", "ExecPaths" and "NoExecPaths" may be
       prefixed with "-", in which case they will be ignored when they do not exist. If prefixed  with  "+"  the
       paths    are   taken   relative   to   the   root   directory   of   the   unit,   as   configured   with
       "RootDirectory"/"RootImage", instead of relative to the root directory of  the  host  (see  above).  When
       combining "-" and "+" on the same path make sure to specify "-" first, and "+" second.

       Note  that  these  settings  will disconnect propagation of mounts from the unit's processes to the host.
       This means that this setting may not be used for services which shall be able to install mount points  in
       the main mount namespace. For "ReadWritePaths" and "ReadOnlyPaths", propagation in the other direction is
       not  affected,  i.e.  mounts  created  on the host generally appear in the unit processes' namespace, and
       mounts removed on the host also disappear there too. In particular, note that mount propagation from host
       to unit will result in unmodified mounts to be created in the  unit's  namespace,  i.e.  writable  mounts
       appearing  on  the  host  will be writable in the unit's namespace too, even when propagated below a path
       marked with "ReadOnlyPaths"! Restricting access with these options hence does not extend to submounts  of
       a  directory that are created later on. This means the lock-down offered by that setting is not complete,
       and does not offer full protection.

       Note that the effect of these settings may be undone by privileged processes.  In  order  to  set  up  an
       effective  sandboxed  environment for a unit it is thus recommended to combine these settings with either
       "CapabilityBoundingSet=~CAP_SYS_ADMIN" or "SystemCallFilter=~@mount".

       Please be extra careful when applying these options to API file systems (a list of them could be found in
       "MountAPIVPS"), since they may be required for basic system functionalities.  Moreover, "<a href="file:/run/">/run/</a>" needs  to
       be writable for setting up mount namespace and propagation.

   <b>ReadOnlyPaths</b>
       Sets  up  a new file system namespace for executed processes. These options may be used to limit access a

   <b>TemporaryFileSystem</b>
       Takes  a  space-separated  list  of  mount  points for temporary file systems (tmpfs). If set, a new file

       point.   This option may be specified more than once, in which case temporary file systems are mounted on
       all listed mount points. If the empty string is assigned to this option, the list is reset, and all prior
       assignments have no effect.  Each mount point may optionally be suffixed with a  colon  (":")  and  mount
       options   such  as  "size=10%"  or  "ro".  By  default,  each  temporary  file  system  is  mounted  with
       "nodev,strictatime,mode=0755". These can be disabled by explicitly  specifying  the  corresponding  mount
       options, e.g., "dev" or "nostrictatime".

       This  is  useful  to  hide  files or directories not relevant to the processes invoked by the unit, while
       necessary  files  or  directories  can   be   still   accessed   by   combining   with   "BindPaths"   or
       "BindReadOnlyPaths":

           TemporaryFileSystem=<a href="file:/var">/var</a>:ro
           BindReadOnlyPaths=<a href="file:/var/lib/systemd">/var/lib/systemd</a>

       then  the  invoked  processes  by  the  unit cannot see any files or directories under "<a href="file:/var/">/var/</a>" except for
       "<a href="file:/var/lib/systemd">/var/lib/systemd</a>" or its contents.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>list</u> <u>of</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>PrivateTmp</b>
       Takes a boolean argument, or "disconnected". If enabled, a new file system namespace will be set  up  for
       the  executed  processes, and "<a href="file:/tmp/">/tmp/</a>" and "<a href="file:/var/tmp/">/var/tmp/</a>" directories inside it are not shared with processes
       outside of the namespace, plus all temporary files created by a service  in  these  directories  will  be
       removed after the service is stopped. If "true", the backing storage of the private temporary directories
       will  remain  on the host's "<a href="file:/tmp/">/tmp/</a>" and "<a href="file:/var/tmp/">/var/tmp/</a>" directories.  If "disconnected", the directories will
       be backed by a completely new tmpfs instance, meaning that the storage is  fully  disconnected  from  the
       host namespace. Defaults to false.

       This  setting  is  useful  to  secure access to temporary files of the process, but makes sharing between
       processes via "<a href="file:/tmp/">/tmp/</a>" or "<a href="file:/var/tmp/">/var/tmp/</a>" impossible.  If not set to "disconnected", it is possible to run two
       or more units within the same private "<a href="file:/tmp/">/tmp/</a>" and "<a href="file:/var/tmp/">/var/tmp/</a>" namespace by using  the  "JoinsNamespaceOf"
       directive,  see  <b><a href="../man5/systemd.unit.5.html">systemd.unit</a></b>(5)  for  details. This setting is implied if "DynamicUser" is set. For this
       setting, the same restrictions regarding mount propagation and privileges apply  as  for  "ReadOnlyPaths"
       and  related  calls, see above. If set to "true" (as opposed to "disconnected"), this has the side effect
       of adding "Requires" and "After" dependencies  on  all  mount  units  necessary  to  access  "<a href="file:/tmp/">/tmp/</a>"  and
       "<a href="file:/var/tmp/">/var/tmp/</a>"  on the host. Moreover an implicitly "After" ordering on <b><a href="../man8/systemd-tmpfiles-setup.service.8.html">systemd-tmpfiles-setup.service</a></b>(8) is
       added.

       Note that the implementation of this setting might be impossible (for example if mount namespaces are not
       available), and the unit should be written in a way that  does  not  solely  rely  on  this  setting  for
       security.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>boolean.</u>

   <b>PrivateDevices</b>
       Takes  a  boolean argument. If true, sets up a new "<a href="file:/dev/">/dev/</a>" mount for the executed processes and only adds
       API pseudo devices such as  "/dev/null",  "/dev/zero"  or  "/dev/random"  (as  well  as  the  pseudo  TTY
       subsystem)  to  it,  but  no  physical devices such as "/dev/sda", system memory "/dev/mem", system ports
       "/dev/port" and others. This is useful to turn off  physical  device  access  by  the  executed  process.
       Defaults to false.

       Enabling  this  option  will  install  a  system call filter to block low-level I/O system calls that are
       grouped in the "@raw-io" set, remove "CAP_MKNOD" and "CAP_SYS_RAWIO" from the capability bounding set for
       the unit, and set "DevicePolicy=closed" (see <b><a href="../man5/systemd.resource-control.5.html">systemd.resource-control</a></b>(5) for details).  Note  that  using
       this  setting  will  disconnect  propagation  of  mounts from the service to the host (propagation in the
       opposite direction continues to work). This means that this setting may not be used  for  services  which
       shall  be able to install mount points in the main mount namespace. The new "<a href="file:/dev/">/dev/</a>" will be mounted read-
       only and 'noexec'. The latter may break old programs which try to  set  up  executable  memory  by  using
       <b><a href="../man2/mmap.2.html">mmap</a></b>(2)  of  "/dev/zero"  instead  of  using "MAP_ANON". For this setting the same restrictions regarding
       mount propagation and privileges apply as for "ReadOnlyPaths" and related calls, see above.

       Note that the implementation of this setting might be impossible (for example if mount namespaces are not
       available), and the unit should be written in a way that  does  not  solely  rely  on  this  setting  for
       security.

       When  access  to  some  but  not  all  devices  must be possible, the "DeviceAllow" setting might be used
       instead. See <b><a href="../man5/systemd.resource-control.5.html">systemd.resource-control</a></b>(5).   <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>boolean.</u>

   <b>PrivateNetwork</b>
       Takes a boolean argument. If true, sets up a  new  network  namespace  for  the  executed  processes  and
       configures only the loopback network device "lo" inside it. No other network devices will be available to
       the  executed  process.  This  is useful to turn off network access by the executed process.  Defaults to
       false. It is possible to run two or more units within the same private network  namespace  by  using  the
       "JoinsNamespaceOf"  directive, see <b><a href="../man5/systemd.unit.5.html">systemd.unit</a></b>(5) for details. Note that this option will disconnect all
       socket families from the host, including "AF_NETLINK" and "AF_UNIX". Effectively, for  "AF_NETLINK"  this
       means  that  device  configuration events received from <b><a href="../man8/systemd-udevd.service.8.html">systemd-udevd.service</a></b>(8) are not delivered to the
       unit's processes. And for "AF_UNIX" this has the effect that "AF_UNIX" sockets  in  the  abstract  socket
       namespace of the host will become unavailable to the unit's processes (however, those located in the file
       system will continue to be accessible).

       Note  that  the implementation of this setting might be impossible (for example if network namespaces are
       not available), and the unit should be written in a way that does not solely rely  on  this  setting  for
       security.

       When this option is enabled, "PrivateMounts" is implied unless it is explicitly disabled, and "<a href="file:/sys">/sys</a>" will
       be remounted to associate it with the new network namespace.

       When this option is used on a socket unit any sockets bound on behalf of this unit will be bound within a
       private  network  namespace.  This may be combined with "JoinsNamespaceOf" to listen on sockets inside of
       network namespaces of other services.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>boolean.</u>

   <b>NetworkNamespacePath</b>
       Takes an absolute file system path referring to a Linux network namespace pseudo-file (i.e. a  file  like
       "<a href="file:/proc/">/proc/</a>$PID/ns/net"  or  a bind mount or symlink to one). When set the invoked processes are added to the
       network namespace referenced by that path. The path has to point to a valid namespace file at the  moment
       the  processes  are  forked off. If this option is used "PrivateNetwork" has no effect. If this option is
       used together with "JoinsNamespaceOf" then it only has an effect if this unit is started  before  any  of
       the  listed  units  that  have  "PrivateNetwork"  or  "NetworkNamespacePath" configured, as otherwise the
       network namespace of those units is reused.

       When this option is enabled, "PrivateMounts" is implied unless it is explicitly disabled, and "<a href="file:/sys">/sys</a>" will
       be remounted to associate it with the new network namespace.

       When this option is used on a socket unit any sockets bound on behalf of this unit will be  bound  within
       the specified network namespace.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>PrivateIPC</b>
       Takes  a  boolean  argument.  If  true, sets up a new IPC namespace for the executed processes.  Each IPC
       namespace has its own set of System V IPC identifiers and its own POSIX message queue file system.   This
       is  useful  to  avoid name clash of IPC identifiers. Defaults to false. It is possible to run two or more
       units  within  the  same  private  IPC  namespace  by  using  the   "JoinsNamespaceOf"   directive,   see
       <b><a href="../man5/systemd.unit.5.html">systemd.unit</a></b>(5) for details.

       Note that IPC namespacing does not have an effect on "AF_UNIX" sockets, which are the most common form of
       IPC  used  on  Linux. Instead, "AF_UNIX" sockets in the file system are subject to mount namespacing, and
       those in the abstract namespace are subject to network namespacing.  IPC namespacing only has  an  effect
       on   SysV   IPC   (which   is   mostly   legacy)   as   well   as   POSIX   message   queues  (for  which
       "AF_UNIX"/"SOCK_SEQPACKET" sockets are typically a better  replacement).  IPC  namespacing  also  has  no
       effect  on  POSIX shared memory (which is subject to mount namespacing) either. See <b><a href="../man7/ipc_namespaces.7.html">ipc_namespaces</a></b>(7) for
       the details.

       Note that the implementation of this setting might be impossible (for example if IPC namespaces  are  not
       available),  and  the  unit  should  be  written  in  a way that does not solely rely on this setting for
       security.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>boolean.</u>

   <b>IPCNamespacePath</b>
       Takes an absolute file system path referring to a Linux IPC  namespace  pseudo-file  (i.e.  a  file  like
       "<a href="file:/proc/">/proc/</a>$PID/ns/ipc"  or  a bind mount or symlink to one). When set the invoked processes are added to the
       network namespace referenced by that path. The path has to point to a valid namespace file at the  moment
       the  processes  are forked off. If this option is used "PrivateIPC" has no effect. If this option is used
       together with "JoinsNamespaceOf" then it only has an effect if this unit is started  before  any  of  the
       listed  units that have "PrivateIPC" or "IPCNamespacePath" configured, as otherwise the network namespace
       of those units is reused.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>MemoryKSM</b>
       Takes a boolean argument. When set, it enables KSM (kernel samepage merging) for the processes. KSM is  a
       memory-saving  de-duplication feature. Anonymous memory pages with identical content can be replaced by a
       single write-protected page. This feature should only be enabled for jobs that share  the  same  security
       domain. For details, see Kernel Samepage Merging &lt;https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/mm/ksm.html&gt; in the
       kernel documentation.

       Note that this functionality might not be available, for example if KSM is disabled in the kernel, or the
       kernel doesn't support controlling KSM at the process level through <b><a href="../man2/prctl.2.html">prctl</a></b>(2).  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>boolean.</u>

   <b>PrivatePIDs</b>
       Takes  a  boolean  argument.  Defaults to false. If enabled, sets up a new PID namespace for the executed
       processes. Each executed process is now PID 1 - the init process - in the  new  namespace.   "<a href="file:/proc/">/proc/</a>"  is
       mounted  such  that  only  processes  in  the  PID  namespace  are  visible.   If  "PrivatePIDs"  is set,
       "MountAPIVFS=yes" is implied.

       "PrivatePIDs" is only supported for service units. This setting  is  not  supported  with  "Type=forking"
       since the kernel will kill all processes in the PID namespace if the init process terminates.

       This setting will be ignored if the kernel does not support PID namespaces.

       Note unprivileged user services (i.e. a service run by the per-user instance of the service manager) will
       fail  with  "PrivatePIDs=yes"  if "<a href="file:/proc/">/proc/</a>" is masked (i.e. "<a href="file:/proc/kmsg">/proc/kmsg</a>" is over-mounted with "tmpfs" like
       <b><a href="../man1/systemd-nspawn.1.html">systemd-nspawn</a></b>(1) does).  This is due to a kernel restriction not allowing unprivileged  user  namespaces
       to mount a less restrictive instance of "<a href="file:/proc/">/proc/</a>".  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>boolean.</u>

   <b>PrivateUsers</b>
       Takes  a  boolean  argument  or one of "self" or "identity". Defaults to false. If enabled, sets up a new
       user namespace for the executed processes and configures a user and group mapping. If set to a true value
       or "self", a minimal user and group mapping is configured that maps the "root" user and group as well  as
       the  unit's  own user and group to themselves and everything else to the "nobody" user and group. This is
       useful to securely detach the user and group databases used by the unit from the rest of the system,  and
       thus to create an effective sandbox environment. All files, directories, processes, IPC objects and other
       resources  owned  by users/groups not equaling "root" or the unit's own will stay visible from within the
       unit but appear owned by the "nobody" user and group.

       If the parameter is "identity", user namespacing is set up with an identity mapping for the  first  65536
       UIDs/GIDs.  Any  UIDs/GIDs above 65536 will be mapped to the "nobody" user and group, respectively. While
       this does not provide UID/GID isolation, since all UIDs/GIDs  are  chosen  identically  it  does  provide
       process  capability  isolation, and hence is often a good choice if proper user namespacing with distinct
       UID maps is not appropriate.

       If this mode is enabled, all unit processes are  run  without  privileges  in  the  host  user  namespace
       (regardless if the unit's own user/group is "root" or not). Specifically this means that the process will
       have  zero  process capabilities on the host's user namespace, but full capabilities within the service's
       user namespace. Settings such as "CapabilityBoundingSet" will affect only the latter, and there's no  way
       to acquire additional capabilities in the host's user namespace.

       When this setting is set up by a per-user instance of the service manager, the mapping of the "root" user
       and group to itself is omitted (unless the user manager is root).  Additionally, in the per-user instance
       manager  case,  the user namespace will be set up before most other namespaces. This means that combining
       "PrivateUsers"="true" with other namespaces will enable use of features not  normally  supported  by  the
       per-user instances of the service manager.

       This  setting  is  particularly  useful  in  conjunction with "RootDirectory"/"RootImage", as the need to
       synchronize the user and group databases in the root directory and on the host is reduced,  as  the  only
       users and groups who need to be matched are "root", "nobody" and the unit's own user and group.

       Note  that the implementation of this setting might be impossible (for example if user namespaces are not
       available), and the unit should be written in a way that  does  not  solely  rely  on  this  setting  for
       security.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>enum.</u> <u>choice:</u> <u>'identity',</u> <u>'no',</u> <u>'self',</u> <u>'yes'.</u>

   <b>ProtectHostname</b>
       Takes  a boolean argument. When set, sets up a new UTS namespace for the executed processes. In addition,
       changing hostname or domainname is prevented. Defaults to off.

       Note that the implementation of this setting might be impossible (for example if UTS namespaces  are  not
       available),  and  the  unit  should  be  written  in  a way that does not solely rely on this setting for
       security.

       Note that when this option is enabled for a service hostname changes no longer propagate from the  system
       into  the  service,  it  is  hence  not suitable for services that need to take notice of system hostname
       changes dynamically.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>boolean.</u>

   <b>ProtectClock</b>
       Takes a boolean argument. If set, writes to the hardware clock or system clock will be  denied.  Defaults
       to off. Enabling this option removes "CAP_SYS_TIME" and "CAP_WAKE_ALARM" from the capability bounding set
       for   this   unit,  installs  a  system  call  filter  to  block  calls  that  can  set  the  clock,  and
       "DeviceAllow=char-rtc r" is implied. Note that the system calls are blocked altogether, the  filter  does
       not  take  into  account  that  some of the calls can be used to read the clock state with some parameter
       combinations.  Effectively, "/dev/rtc0", "/dev/rtc1",  etc.  are  made  read-only  to  the  service.  See
       <b><a href="../man5/systemd.resource-control.5.html">systemd.resource-control</a></b>(5) for the details about "DeviceAllow".

       It is recommended to turn this on for most services that do not need modify the clock or check its state.
       <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>boolean.</u>

   <b>ProtectKernelTunables</b>
       Takes   a  boolean  argument.  If  true,  kernel  variables  accessible  through  "<a href="file:/proc/sys/">/proc/sys/</a>",  "<a href="file:/sys/">/sys/</a>",
       "<a href="file:/proc/sysrq-trigger">/proc/sysrq-trigger</a>",   "<a href="file:/proc/latency_stats">/proc/latency_stats</a>",   "<a href="file:/proc/acpi">/proc/acpi</a>",   "/proc/timer_stats",   "<a href="file:/proc/fs">/proc/fs</a>"   and
       "<a href="file:/proc/irq">/proc/irq</a>"  will be made read-only and "<a href="file:/proc/kallsyms">/proc/kallsyms</a>" as well as "<a href="file:/proc/kcore">/proc/kcore</a>" will be inaccessible to
       all processes of the unit.  Usually, tunable kernel variables should be initialized  only  at  boot-time,
       for  example  with the <b><a href="../man5/sysctl.d.5.html">sysctl.d</a></b>(5) mechanism. Few services need to write to these at runtime; it is hence
       recommended to turn this on for most services. For this setting the  same  restrictions  regarding  mount
       propagation  and  privileges  apply as for "ReadOnlyPaths" and related calls, see above. Defaults to off.
       Note that this option does not prevent indirect changes to kernel tunables effected by IPC calls to other
       processes.  However,  "InaccessiblePaths"  may  be  used  to  make  relevant  IPC  file  system   objects
       inaccessible. If "ProtectKernelTunables" is set, "MountAPIVFS=yes" is implied.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>boolean.</u>

   <b>ProtectKernelModules</b>
       Takes  a  boolean  argument. If true, explicit module loading will be denied. This allows module load and
       unload operations to be turned off on modular kernels. It  is  recommended  to  turn  this  on  for  most
       services that do not need special file systems or extra kernel modules to work. Defaults to off. Enabling
       this option removes "CAP_SYS_MODULE" from the capability bounding set for the unit, and installs a system
       call  filter to block module system calls, also "<a href="file:/usr/lib/modules">/usr/lib/modules</a>" is made inaccessible. For this setting
       the same restrictions regarding mount propagation and privileges apply as for "ReadOnlyPaths" and related
       calls, see above. Note that limited automatic module loading due to user configuration or kernel  mapping
       tables  might still happen as side effect of requested user operations, both privileged and unprivileged.
       To disable  module  auto-load  feature  please  see  <b><a href="../man5/sysctl.d.5.html">sysctl.d</a></b>(5)"kernel.modules_disabled"  mechanism  and
       "<a href="file:/proc/sys/kernel/modules_disabled">/proc/sys/kernel/modules_disabled</a>" documentation.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>boolean.</u>

   <b>ProtectKernelLogs</b>
       Takes a boolean argument. If true, access to the kernel log ring buffer will be denied. It is recommended
       to  turn  this on for most services that do not need to read from or write to the kernel log ring buffer.
       Enabling this option removes "CAP_SYSLOG" from the capability bounding set for this unit, and installs  a
       system call filter to block the <b><a href="../man2/syslog.2.html">syslog</a></b>(2) system call (not to be confused with the libc API <b><a href="../man3/syslog.3.html">syslog</a></b>(3) for
       userspace  logging).  The kernel exposes its log buffer to userspace via "/dev/kmsg" and "<a href="file:/proc/kmsg">/proc/kmsg</a>". If
       enabled, these are made inaccessible to all the processes in the unit.   <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>boolean.</u>

   <b>ProtectControlGroups</b>
       Takes a boolean argument or the special values "private" or "strict". If true, the Linux  Control  Groups
       (<b><a href="../man7/cgroups.7.html">cgroups</a></b>(7))  hierarchies accessible through "<a href="file:/sys/fs/cgroup/">/sys/fs/cgroup/</a>" will be made read-only to all processes of
       the unit. If set to "private", the unit will run in a cgroup namespace with a private writable  mount  of
       "<a href="file:/sys/fs/cgroup/">/sys/fs/cgroup/</a>".  If  set to "strict", the unit will run in a cgroup namespace with a private read-only
       mount of "<a href="file:/sys/fs/cgroup/">/sys/fs/cgroup/</a>".  Defaults to off. If  "ProtectControlGroups"  is  set,  "MountAPIVFS=yes"  is
       implied.  Note  "private" and "strict" are downgraded to false and true respectively unless the system is
       using the unified control group hierarchy and the kernel supports cgroup namespaces.

       Except for container managers no services should require write access to the control groups  hierarchies;
       it  is  hence  recommended  to set "ProtectControlGroups" to true or "strict" for most services. For this
       setting the same restrictions regarding mount propagation and privileges apply as for "ReadOnlyPaths" and
       related settings, see above.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>enum.</u> <u>choice:</u> <u>'no',</u> <u>'private',</u> <u>'strict',</u> <u>'yes'.</u>

   <b>RestrictAddressFamilies</b>
       Restricts the set of socket address families accessible to the processes of this unit. Takes "none", or a
       space-separated list of address family names to allow-list, such as "AF_UNIX", "AF_INET"  or  "AF_INET6".
       When  "none"  is  specified,  then all address families will be denied. When prefixed with "~" the listed
       address families will be applied as deny list, otherwise as allow list. Note that this  restricts  access
       to  the <b><a href="../man2/socket.2.html">socket</a></b>(2) system call only. Sockets passed into the process by other means (for example, by using
       socket activation with socket units, see <b><a href="../man5/systemd.socket.5.html">systemd.socket</a></b>(5)) are unaffected. Also,  sockets  created  with
       <b>socketpair()</b>  (which creates connected AF_UNIX sockets only) are unaffected. Note that this option has no
       effect on 32-bit x86, s390, s390x, mips, mips-le, ppc, ppc-le, ppc64, ppc64-le and is ignored (but  works
       correctly  on  other  ABIs,  including  x86-64).  Note  that on systems supporting multiple ABIs (such as
       x86/x86-64) it is recommended to turn off alternative ABIs for services, so that they cannot be  used  to
       circumvent  the  restrictions of this option. Specifically, it is recommended to combine this option with
       "SystemCallArchitectures=native" or similar. By default, no restrictions apply, all address families  are
       accessible  to  processes.  If assigned the empty string, any previous address family restriction changes
       are undone. This setting does not affect commands prefixed with "+".

       Use this option to limit exposure of processes to remote access, in particular via exotic  and  sensitive
       network  protocols,  such  as  "AF_PACKET".  Note  that in most cases, the local "AF_UNIX" address family
       should be included in the configured allow list  as  it  is  frequently  used  for  local  communication,
       including for <b><a href="../man2/syslog.2.html">syslog</a></b>(2) logging.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>RestrictFileSystems</b>
       Restricts  the  set of filesystems processes of this unit can open files on. Takes a space-separated list
       of filesystem names. Any filesystem listed  is  made  accessible  to  the  unit's  processes,  access  to
       filesystem types not listed is prohibited (allow-listing). If the first character of the list is "~", the
       effect is inverted: access to the filesystems listed is prohibited (deny-listing). If the empty string is
       assigned, access to filesystems is not restricted.

       If  you  specify  both  types of this option (i.e. allow-listing and deny-listing), the first encountered
       will take precedence and will dictate the default action (allow access to the  filesystem  or  deny  it).
       Then  the  next  occurrences of this option will add or delete the listed filesystems from the set of the
       restricted filesystems, depending on its type and the default action.

       Example: if a unit has the following,

           RestrictFileSystems=ext4 tmpfs
           RestrictFileSystems=ext2 ext4

       then access to "ext4", "tmpfs", and "ext2" is allowed and access to other filesystems is denied.

       Example: if a unit has the following,

           RestrictFileSystems=ext4 tmpfs
           RestrictFileSystems=~ext4

       then only access "tmpfs" is allowed.

       Example: if a unit has the following,

           RestrictFileSystems=~ext4 tmpfs
           RestrictFileSystems=ext4

       then only access to "tmpfs" is denied.

       As the number of possible filesystems is large, predefined sets of filesystems are provided. A set starts
       with "@" character, followed by name of the set.

       Use <b><a href="../man1/systemd-analyze.1.html">systemd-analyze</a></b>(1)'s filesystems command to retrieve a list  of  filesystems  defined  on  the  local
       system.

       Note  that  this  setting might not be supported on some systems (for example if the LSM eBPF hook is not
       enabled in the underlying kernel or if not using the unified control group hierarchy). In that case  this
       setting has no effect.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>RestrictNamespaces</b>
       Restricts access to Linux namespace functionality for the processes of this unit. For details about Linux
       namespaces,  see  <b><a href="../man7/namespaces.7.html">namespaces</a></b>(7).  Either takes a boolean argument, or a space-separated list of namespace
       type identifiers. If false (the default), no restrictions on namespace creation and switching  are  made.
       If  true, access to any kind of namespacing is prohibited. Otherwise, a space-separated list of namespace
       type identifiers must be specified, consisting of any combination  of:  "cgroup",  "ipc",  "net",  "mnt",
       "pid",  "user" and "uts". Any namespace type listed is made accessible to the unit's processes, access to
       namespace types not listed is prohibited (allow-listing). By prepending the  list  with  a  single  tilde
       character  ("~")  the  effect may be inverted: only the listed namespace types will be made inaccessible,
       all unlisted ones are permitted (deny-listing). If the empty string is assigned,  the  default  namespace
       restrictions  are  applied, which is equivalent to false. This option may appear more than once, in which
       case the namespace types are merged by "OR", or by "AND" if the lines are prefixed with "~" (see examples
       below). Internally, this setting limits access to the <b><a href="../man2/unshare.2.html">unshare</a></b>(2), <b><a href="../man2/clone.2.html">clone</a></b>(2)  and  <b><a href="../man2/setns.2.html">setns</a></b>(2)  system  calls,
       taking  the  specified flags parameters into account. Note that — if this option is used — in addition to
       restricting creation and switching of the specified types of namespaces (or all of them, if true)  access
       to  the  <b>setns()</b> system call with a zero flags parameter is prohibited. This setting is only supported on
       x86, x86-64, mips, mips-le, mips64, mips64-le,  mips64-n32,  mips64-le-n32,  ppc64,  ppc64-le,  s390  and
       s390x, and enforces no restrictions on other architectures.

       Example: if a unit has the following,

           RestrictNamespaces=cgroup ipc
           RestrictNamespaces=cgroup net

       then "cgroup", "ipc", and "net" are set.  If the second line is prefixed with "~", e.g.,

           RestrictNamespaces=cgroup ipc
           RestrictNamespaces=~cgroup net

       then, only "ipc" is set.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>LockPersonality</b>
       Takes  a boolean argument. If set, locks down the <b><a href="../man2/personality.2.html">personality</a></b>(2) system call so that the kernel execution
       domain may not be changed from the default or the personality selected with "Personality" directive. This
       may be useful to improve security, because odd personality emulations may be poorly tested and source  of
       vulnerabilities.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>boolean.</u>

   <b>MemoryDenyWriteExecute</b>
       Takes  a boolean argument. If set, attempts to create memory mappings that are writable and executable at
       the same time, or to change existing memory mappings to  become  executable,  or  mapping  shared  memory
       segments  as  executable,  are prohibited. Specifically, a system call filter is added (or preferably, an
       equivalent kernel check is enabled with <b><a href="../man2/prctl.2.html">prctl</a></b>(2)) that rejects <b><a href="../man2/mmap.2.html">mmap</a></b>(2) system calls with both "PROT_EXEC"
       and "PROT_WRITE" set, <b><a href="../man2/mprotect.2.html">mprotect</a></b>(2) or <b><a href="../man2/pkey_mprotect.2.html">pkey_mprotect</a></b>(2) system calls  with  "PROT_EXEC"  set  and  <b><a href="../man2/shmat.2.html">shmat</a></b>(2)
       system  calls with "SHM_EXEC" set. Note that this option is incompatible with programs and libraries that
       generate program code dynamically at runtime, including JIT execution  engines,  executable  stacks,  and
       code  "trampoline"  feature  of  various  C compilers. This option improves service security, as it makes
       harder for software exploits  to  change  running  code  dynamically.  However,  the  protection  can  be
       circumvented,  if  the  service  can  write  to a filesystem, which is not mounted with "noexec" (such as
       "<a href="file:/dev/shm">/dev/shm</a>"), or it can use <b>memfd_create()</b>. This can be prevented by making such file systems inaccessible
       to  the  service  (e.g.  "InaccessiblePaths=<a href="file:/dev/shm">/dev/shm</a>")  and  installing  further  system   call   filters
       ("SystemCallFilter=~memfd_create"). Note that this feature is fully available on x86-64, and partially on
       x86.  Specifically,  the  <b>shmat()</b>  protection  is  not  available on x86. Note that on systems supporting
       multiple ABIs (such as x86/x86-64) it is recommended to turn off alternative ABIs for services,  so  that
       they  cannot  be  used  to circumvent the restrictions of this option. Specifically, it is recommended to
       combine this option with "SystemCallArchitectures=native" or similar.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>boolean.</u>

   <b>RestrictRealtime</b>
       Takes a boolean argument. If set, any attempts to enable realtime scheduling in a process of the unit are
       refused. This restricts access to realtime task scheduling policies such as "SCHED_FIFO",  "SCHED_RR"  or
       "SCHED_DEADLINE".  See <b><a href="../man7/sched.7.html">sched</a></b>(7) for details about these scheduling policies. Realtime scheduling policies
       may be used to monopolize CPU time for longer periods of time, and may  hence  be  used  to  lock  up  or
       otherwise  trigger Denial-of-Service situations on the system. It is hence recommended to restrict access
       to realtime scheduling to the few programs that actually require them. Defaults to off.   <u>Optional.</u>  <u>Type</u>
       <u>boolean.</u>

   <b>RestrictSUIDSGID</b>
       Takes  a boolean argument. If set, any attempts to set the set-user-ID (SUID) or set-group-ID (SGID) bits
       on files or directories will be denied (for details on these bits see <b><a href="../man7/inode.7.html">inode</a></b>(7)).  As the  SUID/SGID  bits
       are  mechanisms  to  elevate  privileges,  and  allow users to acquire the identity of other users, it is
       recommended to restrict creation of SUID/SGID files to the few programs that actually require them.  Note
       that  this  restricts  marking  of any type of file system object with these bits, including both regular
       files and directories (where the SGID is a different meaning than for  files,  see  documentation).  This
       option is implied if "DynamicUser" is enabled. Defaults to off.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>boolean.</u>

   <b>RemoveIPC</b>
       Takes  a  boolean  parameter.  If set, all System V and POSIX IPC objects owned by the user and group the
       processes of this unit are run as are removed when the unit is stopped. This setting only has  an  effect
       if  at  least one of "User", "Group" and "DynamicUser" are used. It has no effect on IPC objects owned by
       the root user. Specifically, this removes System V semaphores, as well  as  System  V  and  POSIX  shared
       memory  segments  and  message  queues.  If multiple units use the same user or group the IPC objects are
       removed when the last of these units is stopped.  This  setting  is  implied  if  "DynamicUser"  is  set.
       <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>boolean.</u>

   <b>PrivateMounts</b>
       Takes  a  boolean  parameter.  If  set,  the processes of this unit will be run in their own private file
       system (mount) namespace with all mount propagation from the  processes  towards  the  host's  main  file
       system namespace turned off. This means any file system mount points established or removed by the unit's
       processes  will  be  private  to  them  and not be visible to the host. However, file system mount points
       established or removed on the host will be propagated to the unit's  processes.  See  <b><a href="../man7/mount_namespaces.7.html">mount_namespaces</a></b>(7)
       for details on file system namespaces. Defaults to off.

       When turned on, this executes three operations for each invoked process: a new "CLONE_NEWNS" namespace is
       created,  after  which  all  existing  mounts are remounted to "MS_SLAVE" to disable propagation from the
       unit's processes to the host (but leaving propagation in the opposite direction in effect). Finally,  the
       mounts are remounted again to the propagation mode configured with "MountFlags", see below.

       File system namespaces are set up individually for each process forked off by the service manager. Mounts
       established  in  the  namespace  of  the  process  created  by  "ExecStartPre"  will  hence be cleaned up
       automatically as soon as that process exits and will not be available to subsequent processes forked  off
       for  "ExecStart"  (and  similar  applies  to the various other commands configured for units). Similarly,
       "JoinsNamespaceOf" does not permit sharing kernel mount namespaces between units, it only enables sharing
       of the "<a href="file:/tmp/">/tmp/</a>" and "<a href="file:/var/tmp/">/var/tmp/</a>" directories.

       Other  file  system  namespace  unit  settings   —   "PrivateTmp",   "PrivateDevices",   "ProtectSystem",
       "ProtectHome",  "ReadOnlyPaths", "InaccessiblePaths", "ReadWritePaths", "BindPaths", "BindReadOnlyPaths",
       … — also enable file system namespacing in a fashion equivalent to this option.  Hence  it  is  primarily
       useful  to  explicitly  request  this  behaviour  if none of the other settings are used.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u>
       <u>boolean.</u>

   <b>MountFlags</b>
       Takes a mount propagation setting: "shared", "slave" or "private", which  controls  whether  file  system
       mount  points  in  the  file system namespaces set up for this unit's processes will receive or propagate
       mounts and unmounts from other file system namespaces. See <b><a href="../man2/mount.2.html">mount</a></b>(2) for details on mount propagation, and
       the three propagation flags in particular.

       This setting only controls the final propagation setting in effect on all mount points of the file system
       namespace created for each process of this unit. Other file system namespacing  unit  settings  (see  the
       discussion  in  "PrivateMounts"  above)  will  implicitly  disable mount and unmount propagation from the
       unit's processes towards the host by changing the propagation setting of all mount points in  the  unit's
       file  system namespace to "slave" first. Setting this option to "shared" does not reestablish propagation
       in that case.

       If not set – but file system namespaces are enabled through another file system namespace unit setting  –
       "shared"  mount  propagation  is used, but — as mentioned — as "slave" is applied first, propagation from
       the unit's processes to the host is still turned off.

       It is not recommended to use "private" mount propagation for units, as this means temporary mounts  (such
       as  removable media) of the host will stay mounted and thus indefinitely busy in forked off processes, as
       unmount propagation events won't be received by the file system namespace of the unit.

       Usually, it is best to leave this setting unmodified,  and  use  higher  level  file  system  namespacing
       options instead, in particular "PrivateMounts", see above.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>SystemCallFilter</b>
       Takes  a space-separated list of system call names. If this setting is used, all system calls executed by
       the unit processes except for the listed ones will result  in  immediate  process  termination  with  the
       "SIGSYS"  signal (allow-listing). (See "SystemCallErrorNumber" below for changing the default action). If
       the first character of the list is "~", the effect is inverted: only the listed system calls will  result
       in  immediate  process  termination  (deny-listing).  Deny-listed system calls and system call groups may
       optionally be suffixed with a colon (":") and "errno" error number (between 0 and  4095)  or  errno  name
       such as "EPERM", "EACCES" or "EUCLEAN" (see <b><a href="../man3/errno.3.html">errno</a></b>(3) for a full list). This value will be returned when a
       deny-listed  system  call is triggered, instead of terminating the processes immediately. Special setting
       "kill" can be used to explicitly specify killing. This value takes  precedence  over  the  one  given  in
       "SystemCallErrorNumber",  see  below. This feature makes use of the Secure Computing Mode 2 interfaces of
       the kernel ('seccomp filtering') and is useful for enforcing a minimal sandboxing environment.  Note that
       the <b>execve()</b>, <b>exit()</b>, <b>exit_group()</b>, <b>getrlimit()</b>, <b>rt_sigreturn()</b>, <b>sigreturn()</b> system calls and the  system
       calls for querying time and sleeping are implicitly allow-listed and do not need to be listed explicitly.
       This  option  may  be  specified  more than once, in which case the filter masks are merged. If the empty
       string is assigned, the filter is reset, all prior assignments will have no effect. This does not  affect
       commands prefixed with "+".

       Note  that  on  systems  supporting  multiple  ABIs  (such  as  x86/x86-64) it is recommended to turn off
       alternative ABIs for services, so that they cannot be used to circumvent the restrictions of this option.
       Specifically, it is recommended to combine this option with "SystemCallArchitectures=native" or similar.

       Note that strict system call filters may impact execution and error handling code paths  of  the  service
       invocation. Specifically, access to the <b>execve()</b> system call is required for the execution of the service
       binary  —  if  it  is blocked service invocation will necessarily fail. Also, if execution of the service
       binary fails for some reason (for example: missing service executable), the error  handling  logic  might
       require  access  to an additional set of system calls in order to process and log this failure correctly.
       It might be necessary to temporarily disable system call filters in order to simplify debugging  of  such
       failures.

       If  you  specify  both  types of this option (i.e. allow-listing and deny-listing), the first encountered
       will take precedence and will dictate the default action (termination or approval of a system call). Then
       the next occurrences of this option will add or delete the listed  system  calls  from  the  set  of  the
       filtered  system  calls,  depending of its type and the default action. (For example, if you have started
       with an allow list rule for <b>read()</b> and <b>write()</b>, and right after it add a deny list rule for <b>write()</b>, then
       <b>write()</b> will be removed from the set.)

       As the number of possible system calls is large, predefined sets of system  calls  are  provided.  A  set
       starts   with   "@"   character,  followed  by  name  of  the  set.   Currently  predefined  system  call

       special purpose calls. This is the recommended starting point for allow-listing system calls  for  system
       services,  as  it  contains  what  is  typically  needed by system services, but excludes overly specific
       interfaces. For example, the following APIs are excluded:  @clock,  @mount,  @swap,  @reboot.@timerSystem
       calls  for  scheduling operations by time (<b><a href="../man2/alarm.2.html">alarm</a></b>(2), <b><a href="../man2/timer_create.2.html">timer_create</a></b>(2), …)@knownAll system calls defined by
       the kernel. This list is defined statically in systemd based on a kernel version that was available  when
       this  systemd  version  was  released.  It  will  become  progressively more out-of-date as the kernel is
       updated.  Note, that as new system calls are added to the kernel, additional system calls might be  added
       to the groups above. Contents of the sets may also change between systemd versions. In addition, the list
       of  system  calls  depends  on  the  kernel  version and architecture for which systemd was compiled. Use
       systemd-analyze syscall-filter to list the actual list of system calls in each filter.

       Generally, allow-listing system calls (rather than deny-listing) is the safer mode of  operation.  It  is
       recommended  to  enforce  system call allow lists for all long-running system services. Specifically, the
       following lines are a relatively safe basic choice for the majority of system services:

           [Service]
           SystemCallFilter=@system-service
           SystemCallErrorNumber=EPERM

       Note that various kernel system calls are defined  redundantly:  there  are  multiple  system  calls  for
       executing  the  same  operation.  For example, the <b>pidfd_send_signal()</b> system call may be used to execute
       operations similar to what can be done with the older <b>kill()</b>  system  call,  hence  blocking  the  latter
       without  the  former  only  provides  weak  protection. Since new system calls are added regularly to the
       kernel as development progresses, keeping system call deny lists comprehensive requires constant work. It
       is thus recommended to use allow-listing instead, which offers the benefit that new system calls  are  by
       default implicitly blocked until the allow list is updated.

       Also note that a number of system calls are required to be accessible for the dynamic linker to work. The
       dynamic  linker  is  required  for running most regular programs (specifically: all dynamic ELF binaries,
       which is how most distributions build packaged programs). This means that  blocking  these  system  calls
       (which  include  <b>open()</b>,  <b>openat()</b>  or  <b>mmap()</b>)  will  make  most programs typically shipped with generic
       distributions unusable.

       It is recommended to combine the file system namespacing related options with "SystemCallFilter=~@mount",
       in order to prohibit the unit's processes to undo  the  mappings.  Specifically  these  are  the  options
       "PrivateTmp",      "PrivateDevices",     "ProtectSystem",     "ProtectHome",     "ProtectKernelTunables",
       "ProtectControlGroups", "ProtectKernelLogs",  "ProtectClock",  "ReadOnlyPaths",  "InaccessiblePaths"  and
       "ReadWritePaths".  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>list</u> <u>of</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>SystemCallErrorNumber</b>
       Takes  an "errno" error number (between 1 and 4095) or errno name such as "EPERM", "EACCES" or "EUCLEAN",
       to return when the system call  filter  configured  with  "SystemCallFilter"  is  triggered,  instead  of
       terminating  the  process  immediately. See <b><a href="../man3/errno.3.html">errno</a></b>(3) for a full list of error codes. When this setting is
       not used, or when the empty string or the special  setting  "kill"  is  assigned,  the  process  will  be
       terminated immediately when the filter is triggered.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>SystemCallArchitectures</b>
       Takes  a space-separated list of architecture identifiers to include in the system call filter. The known
       architecture identifiers are the same as for "ConditionArchitecture"  described  in  <b><a href="../man5/systemd.unit.5.html">systemd.unit</a></b>(5),  as
       well as "x32", "mips64-n32", "mips64-le-n32", and the special identifier "native". The special identifier
       "native" implicitly maps to the native architecture of the system (or more precisely: to the architecture
       the  system manager is compiled for). By default, this option is set to the empty list, i.e. no filtering
       is applied.

       If this setting is used, processes of this unit will only be permitted to call native system  calls,  and
       system  calls  of  the  specified architectures. For the purposes of this option, the x32 architecture is
       treated as including x86-64 system calls. However, this setting still fulfills its purpose, as  explained
       below, on x32.

       System  call  filtering  is  not equally effective on all architectures. For example, on x86 filtering of
       network socket-related calls is not possible, due to ABI limitations — a limitation that x86-64 does  not
       have,  however.  On  systems supporting multiple ABIs at the same time — such as x86/x86-64 — it is hence
       recommended to limit the set of permitted system call architectures so that secondary  ABIs  may  not  be
       used  to  circumvent  the  restrictions  applied  to the native ABI of the system. In particular, setting
       "SystemCallArchitectures=native" is a good choice for disabling non-native ABIs.

       System call architectures may also be restricted system-wide via the "SystemCallArchitectures" option  in
       the global configuration. See <b><a href="../man5/systemd-system.conf.5.html">systemd-system.conf</a></b>(5) for details.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>SystemCallLog</b>
       Takes  a space-separated list of system call names. If this setting is used, all system calls executed by
       the unit processes for the listed ones will be logged. If the first character of the  list  is  "~",  the
       effect  is  inverted:  all system calls except the listed system calls will be logged. This feature makes
       use of the Secure Computing Mode 2 interfaces of the kernel  ('seccomp  filtering')  and  is  useful  for
       auditing  or setting up a minimal sandboxing environment. This option may be specified more than once, in
       which case the filter masks are merged.  If the empty string is assigned, the filter is reset, all  prior
       assignments  will  have no effect.  This does not affect commands prefixed with "+".  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>list</u>
       <u>of</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>Environment</b>
       Sets environment variables for executed processes. Each line is unquoted using  the  rules  described  in
       "Quoting"  section in <b><a href="../man7/systemd.syntax.7.html">systemd.syntax</a></b>(7) and becomes a list of variable assignments. If you need to assign
       a value containing spaces or the equals sign to a variable,  put  quotes  around  the  whole  assignment.
       Variable  expansion  is  not  performed  inside the strings and the "$" character has no special meaning.
       Specifier expansion is performed, see the "Specifiers" section in <b><a href="../man5/systemd.unit.5.html">systemd.unit</a></b>(5).

       This option may be specified more than once, in which case all listed variables will be set. If the  same
       variable  is  listed  twice,  the later setting will override the earlier setting. If the empty string is
       assigned to this option, the list of environment variables  is  reset,  all  prior  assignments  have  no
       effect.

       The  names  of  the  variables can contain ASCII letters, digits, and the underscore character.  Variable
       names cannot be empty or start with a digit. In variable values, most characters are  allowed,  but  non-
       printable characters are currently rejected.

       Example:

           Environment="VAR1=word1 word2" VAR2=word3 "VAR3=$word 5 6"

       gives three variables "VAR1", "VAR2", "VAR3" with the values "word1 word2", "word3", "$word 5 6".

       See <b><a href="../man7/environ.7.html">environ</a></b>(7) for details about environment variables.

       Note that environment variables are not suitable for passing secrets (such as passwords, key material, …)
       to  service processes. Environment variables set for a unit are exposed to unprivileged clients via D-Bus
       IPC, and generally not understood as being data that requires protection. Moreover, environment variables
       are propagated down the process  tree,  including  across  security  boundaries  (such  as  setuid/setgid
       executables),  and  hence  might  leak  to  processes that should not have access to the secret data. Use
       "LoadCredential", "LoadCredentialEncrypted" or "SetCredentialEncrypted" (see below) to pass data to  unit
       processes securely.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>list</u> <u>of</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>EnvironmentFile</b>
       Similar  to  "Environment",  but  reads  the environment variables from a text file. The text file should
       contain newline-separated variable assignments. Empty lines, lines without an  "="  separator,  or  lines
       starting with ";" or "#" will be ignored, which may be used for commenting. The file must be encoded with
       UTF-8.           Valid           characters          are          unicode          scalar          values
       &lt;https://www.unicode.org/glossary/#unicode_scalar_value&gt;     other     than     unicode     noncharacters
       &lt;https://www.unicode.org/glossary/#noncharacter&gt;,  "U+0000"  "NUL",  and  "U+FEFF"unicode byte order mark
       &lt;https://www.unicode.org/glossary/#byte_order_mark&gt;.  Control codes other than "NUL" are allowed.

       In the file, an unquoted value after the "=" is parsed with the  same  backslash-escape  rules  as  POSIX
       shell                                            unquoted                                            text
       &lt;https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/V3_chap02.html#tag_18_02_01&gt;, but unlike in a
       shell, interior whitespace  is  preserved  and  quotes  after  the  first  non-whitespace  character  are
       preserved.  Leading  and  trailing  whitespace  (space,  tab, carriage return) is discarded, but interior
       whitespace within the line is preserved verbatim. A line ending with a backslash will be continued to the
       following one, with the newline itself discarded. A backslash "\" followed by any  character  other  than
       newline will preserve the following character, so that "\\" will become the value "\".

       In  the file, a "'"-quoted value after the "=" can span multiple lines and contain any character verbatim
       other      than      single      quote,       like       POSIX       shell       single-quoted       text
       &lt;https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/V3_chap02.html#tag_18_02_02&gt;.  No  backslash-
       escape sequences are recognized. Leading  and  trailing  whitespace  outside  of  the  single  quotes  is
       discarded.

       In  the file, a """-quoted value after the "=" can span multiple lines, and the same escape sequences are
       recognized          as          in           POSIX           shell           double-quoted           text
       &lt;https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/V3_chap02.html#tag_18_02_03&gt;.       Backslash
       ("\") followed by any of ""\`$" will preserve that character. A backslash followed by newline is  a  line
       continuation,  and  the  newline  itself  is  discarded.  A  backslash followed by any other character is
       ignored; both the backslash and the following character are  preserved  verbatim.  Leading  and  trailing
       whitespace outside of the double quotes is discarded.

       The  argument passed should be an absolute filename or wildcard expression, optionally prefixed with "-",
       which indicates that if the file does not exist, it will not be read and no error or warning  message  is
       logged.  This  option  may be specified more than once in which case all specified files are read. If the
       empty string is assigned to this option, the list of file to read is reset, all prior assignments have no
       effect.

       The files listed with this  directive  will  be  read  shortly  before  the  process  is  executed  (more
       specifically,  after  all  processes  from  a previous unit state terminated. This means you can generate
       these files in one unit state, and read it with this option in the next. The files are read from the file
       system of the service manager, before any file system changes like bind mounts take place).

       Settings from these files override settings made with "Environment". If the same variable  is  set  twice
       from  these  files,  the  files  will  be read in the order they are specified and the later setting will
       override the earlier setting.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>list</u> <u>of</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>PassEnvironment</b>
       Pass environment variables set for the system service manager  to  executed  processes.  Takes  a  space-
       separated  list  of variable names. This option may be specified more than once, in which case all listed
       variables will be passed. If the empty string is  assigned  to  this  option,  the  list  of  environment
       variables  to  pass  is reset, all prior assignments have no effect. Variables specified that are not set
       for the system manager will not be passed and will be silently ignored. Note that  this  option  is  only
       relevant  for  the system service manager, as system services by default do not automatically inherit any
       environment variables set for the service manager itself. However, in case of the  user  service  manager
       all  environment  variables  are  passed  to  the executed processes anyway, hence this option is without
       effect for the user service manager.

       Variables set for invoked processes due to  this  setting  are  subject  to  being  overridden  by  those
       configured with "Environment" or "EnvironmentFile".

       Example:

           PassEnvironment=VAR1 VAR2 VAR3

       passes three variables "VAR1", "VAR2", "VAR3" with the values set for those variables in PID1.

       See <b><a href="../man7/environ.7.html">environ</a></b>(7) for details about environment variables.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>list</u> <u>of</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>UnsetEnvironment</b>
       Explicitly  unset environment variable assignments that would normally be passed from the service manager
       to invoked processes  of  this  unit.  Takes  a  space-separated  list  of  variable  names  or  variable
       assignments.  This option may be specified more than once, in which case all listed variables/assignments
       will  be  unset.  If  the  empty  string  is  assigned  to  this  option,   the   list   of   environment
       variables/assignments to unset is reset. If a variable assignment is specified (that is: a variable name,
       followed  by  "=", followed by its value), then any environment variable matching this precise assignment
       is removed. If a variable name is specified (that is a variable name without any following "=" or value),
       then any assignment matching the variable name, regardless of its value is removed. Note that the  effect
       of  "UnsetEnvironment" is applied as final step when the environment list passed to executed processes is
       compiled. That means it may undo assignments from any configuration source,  including  assignments  made
       through "Environment" or "EnvironmentFile", inherited from the system manager's global set of environment
       variables, inherited via "PassEnvironment", set by the service manager itself (such as $NOTIFY_SOCKET and
       such), or set by a PAM module (in case "PAMName" is used).

       See "Environment Variables in Spawned Processes" below for a description of how those settings combine to
       form  the  inherited  environment.  See  <b><a href="../man7/environ.7.html">environ</a></b>(7)  for general information about environment variables.
       <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>list</u> <u>of</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>StandardInput</b>
       Controls where file descriptor 0 (STDIN) of the executed processes is connected to. Takes one of  "null",
       "tty", "tty-force", "tty-fail", "data", "file:path", "socket" or "fd:name".

       If  "null"  is  selected,  standard input will be connected to "/dev/null", i.e. all read attempts by the
       process will result in immediate EOF.

       If "tty" is selected, standard input is connected to a TTY (as configured by "TTYPath",  see  below)  and
       the  executed  process  becomes the controlling process of the terminal. If the terminal is already being
       controlled by another process, the executed process waits until the current controlling process  releases
       the terminal.

       "tty-force"  is  similar  to  "tty",  but  the  executed  process  is forcefully and immediately made the
       controlling process of the  terminal,  potentially  removing  previous  controlling  processes  from  the
       terminal.

       "tty-fail"  is  similar  to  "tty", but if the terminal already has a controlling process start-up of the
       executed process fails.

       The "data" option may be used to configure arbitrary textual or binary data to pass via standard input to
       the executed process. The data to pass is  configured  via  "StandardInputText"/"StandardInputData"  (see
       below).  Note that the actual file descriptor type passed (memory file, regular file, UNIX pipe, …) might
       depend on the kernel and available privileges. In any case, the file descriptor is  read-only,  and  when
       read returns the specified data followed by EOF.

       The  "file:path"  option  may  be  used  to  connect  a specific file system object to standard input. An
       absolute path following the ":" character is expected, which may refer to  a  regular  file,  a  FIFO  or
       special file. If an "AF_UNIX" socket in the file system is specified, a stream socket is connected to it.
       The latter is useful for connecting standard input of processes to arbitrary system services.

       The  "socket"  option  is  valid in socket-activated services only, and requires the relevant socket unit
       file (see <b><a href="../man5/systemd.socket.5.html">systemd.socket</a></b>(5) for details) to have "Accept=yes" set, or to specify a single socket only. If
       this option is set, standard input will be connected to the socket the service was activated from,  which
       is  primarily useful for compatibility with daemons designed for use with the traditional <b><a href="../man8/inetd.8.html">inetd</a></b>(8) socket
       activation daemon ($LISTEN_FDS (and related) environment variables are not passed when "socket" value  is
       configured).

       The  "fd:name"  option  connects standard input to a specific, named file descriptor provided by a socket
       unit. The name may be specified as part of this option, following a ":" character (e.g. "fd:foobar").  If
       no  name is specified, the name "stdin" is implied (i.e. "fd" is equivalent to "fd:stdin").  At least one
       socket unit defining the specified name  must  be  provided  via  the  "Sockets"  option,  and  the  file
       descriptor  name  may  differ from the name of its containing socket unit. If multiple matches are found,
       the first one will be used. See "FileDescriptorName" in <b><a href="../man5/systemd.socket.5.html">systemd.socket</a></b>(5) for more  details  about  named
       file descriptors and their ordering.

       This setting defaults to "null", unless "StandardInputText"/"StandardInputData" are set, in which case it
       defaults  to  "data".   <u>Optional.</u>  <u>Type</u>  <u>enum.</u>  <u>choice:</u>  <u>'data',</u>  <u>'null',</u>  <u>'socket',</u>  <u>'tty',</u>  <u>'tty-fail',</u>
       <u>'tty-force'.</u>

   <b>StandardOutput</b>
       Controls where file descriptor 1 (stdout) of the  executed  processes  is  connected  to.  Takes  one  of
       "inherit",   "null",   "tty",   "journal",   "kmsg",   "journal+console",   "kmsg+console",  "file:path",
       "append:path", "truncate:path", "socket" or "fd:name".

       "inherit" duplicates the file descriptor of standard input for standard output.

       "null" connects standard output to "/dev/null", i.e. everything written to it will be lost.

       "tty" connects standard output to a tty (as configured via "TTYPath", see below). If the TTY is used  for
       output  only,  the executed process will not become the controlling process of the terminal, and will not
       fail or wait for other processes to release the terminal. Note: if a unit tries to print  multiple  lines
       to  a  TTY  during bootup or shutdown, then there's a chance that those lines will be broken up by status
       messages. <b>SetShowStatus()</b> can be used  to  prevent  this  problem.  See  <b><a href="../man5/org.freedesktop.systemd1.5.html">org.freedesktop.systemd1</a></b>(5)  for
       details.

       "journal"  connects  standard  output  with the journal, which is accessible via <b><a href="../man1/journalctl.1.html">journalctl</a></b>(1). Note that
       everything that is written to kmsg (see below) is implicitly stored in the journal as well, the  specific
       option  listed  below  is  hence  a superset of this one. (Also note that any external, additional syslog
       daemons receive their log data from the journal, too, hence this is the option to use when logging  shall
       be processed with such a daemon.)

       "kmsg"  connects standard output with the kernel log buffer which is accessible via <b><a href="../man1/dmesg.1.html">dmesg</a></b>(1), in addition
       to the journal. The journal daemon might be configured to send all logs to kmsg  anyway,  in  which  case
       this option is no different from "journal".

       "journal+console"  and  "kmsg+console" work in a similar way as the two options above but copy the output
       to the system console as well.

       The "file:path" option may be used to connect a specific file  system  object  to  standard  output.  The
       semantics  are similar to the same option of "StandardInput", see above. If path refers to a regular file
       on the filesystem, it is opened (created if it doesn't exist yet using privileges of the  user  executing
       the  systemd  process)  for writing at the beginning of the file, but without truncating it.  If standard
       input and output are directed to the same file path, it is opened only once —  for  reading  as  well  as
       writing  —  and  duplicated.  This  is particularly useful when the specified path refers to an "AF_UNIX"
       socket in the file system, as in that case only a single stream connection is created for both input  and
       output.

       "append:path" is similar to "file:path" above, but it opens the file in append mode.

       "truncate:path"  is  similar  to  "file:path" above, but it truncates the file when opening it. For units
       with multiple command lines, e.g. "Type=oneshot" services with multiple  "ExecStart",  or  services  with
       "ExecCondition",  "ExecStartPre"  or  "ExecStartPost",  the  output  file  is  reopened and therefore re-
       truncated for each command line. If the output file is truncated while another process still has the file
       open, e.g. by an "ExecReload" running concurrently with an "ExecStart", and the other  process  continues
       writing  to  the  file  without adjusting its offset, then the space between the file pointers of the two
       processes may be filled with "NUL" bytes, producing a sparse file.  Thus,  "truncate:path"  is  typically
       only  useful  for units where only one process runs at a time, such as services with a single "ExecStart"
       and no "ExecStartPost", "ExecReload", "ExecStop" or similar.

       "socket" connects standard output to a socket acquired via socket activation. The semantics  are  similar
       to the same option of "StandardInput", see above.

       The  "fd:name"  option connects standard output to a specific, named file descriptor provided by a socket
       unit. A name may be specified as part of this option, following a ":" character (e.g. "fd:foobar"). If no
       name is specified, the name "stdout" is implied (i.e. "fd" is equivalent to "fd:stdout").  At  least  one
       socket  unit  defining  the  specified  name  must  be  provided  via  the "Sockets" option, and the file
       descriptor name may differ from the name of its containing socket unit. If multiple  matches  are  found,
       the  first  one  will be used. See "FileDescriptorName" in <b><a href="../man5/systemd.socket.5.html">systemd.socket</a></b>(5) for more details about named
       descriptors and their ordering.

       If the standard output (or error output, see below) of a unit is connected to the journal or  the  kernel
       log buffer, the unit will implicitly gain a dependency of type "After" on "systemd-journald.socket" (also
       see the "Implicit Dependencies" section above). Also note that in this case stdout (or stderr, see below)
       will  be  an  "AF_UNIX"  stream  socket,  and  not  a  pipe or FIFO that can be reopened. This means when
       executing shell scripts the construct echo "hello" &gt; /dev/stderr for writing  text  to  stderr  will  not
       work.  To mitigate this use the construct echo "hello" &gt;&amp;2 instead, which is mostly equivalent and avoids
       this pitfall.

       If "StandardInput" is set to one of "tty", "tty-force", "tty-fail", "socket", or "fd:name", this  setting
       defaults to "inherit".

       In   other   cases,   this   setting   defaults   to   the  value  set  with  "DefaultStandardOutput"  in
       <b><a href="../man5/systemd-system.conf.5.html">systemd-system.conf</a></b>(5), which defaults to "journal". Note that setting this  parameter  might  result  in
       additional  dependencies  to  be  added to the unit (see above).  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>enum.</u> <u>choice:</u> <u>'inherit',</u>
       <u>'journal',</u> <u>'journal+console',</u> <u>'kmsg',</u> <u>'kmsg+console',</u> <u>'null',</u> <u>'socket',</u> <u>'tty'.</u>

   <b>StandardError</b>
       Controls where file descriptor 2 (stderr) of the  executed  processes  is  connected  to.  The  available
       options  are  identical  to those of "StandardOutput", with some exceptions: if set to "inherit" the file
       descriptor used for standard output is duplicated for standard error, while "fd:name" will use a  default
       file descriptor name of "stderr".

       This  setting  defaults  to  the  value  set with "DefaultStandardError" in <b><a href="../man5/systemd-system.conf.5.html">systemd-system.conf</a></b>(5), which
       defaults to "inherit". Note that setting this parameter might result in  additional  dependencies  to  be
       added to the unit (see above).  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>StandardInputText</b>
       Configures  arbitrary  textual  or  binary  data  to  pass  via file descriptor 0 (STDIN) to the executed
       processes. These settings have no effect unless "StandardInput" is set to "data" (which is the default if
       "StandardInput" is not set otherwise, but "StandardInputText"/"StandardInputData" is). Use this option to
       embed process input data directly in the unit file.

       "StandardInputText" accepts arbitrary textual data. C-style escapes for special characters as well as the
       usual "%"-specifiers are resolved. Each time this setting is used the specified text is appended  to  the
       per-unit  data  buffer,  followed by a newline character (thus every use appends a new line to the end of
       the buffer). Note that leading and trailing whitespace of lines configured with this option  is  removed.
       If  an  empty  line  is  specified the buffer is cleared (hence, in order to insert an empty line, add an
       additional "\n" to the end or beginning of a line).

       "StandardInputData"      accepts      arbitrary      binary      data,      encoded       in       Base64
       &lt;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2045#section-6.8&gt;.  No  escape  sequences or specifiers are resolved. Any
       whitespace in the encoded version is ignored during decoding.

       Note that "StandardInputText" and "StandardInputData" operate on the same data buffer, and may  be  mixed
       in  order to configure both binary and textual data for the same input stream. The textual or binary data
       is joined strictly in the order the settings appear in the unit file. Assigning an empty string to either
       will reset the data buffer.

       Please keep in mind that in order to maintain readability long unit  file  settings  may  be  split  into
       multiple  lines,  by  suffixing each line (except for the last) with a "\" character (see <b><a href="../man5/systemd.unit.5.html">systemd.unit</a></b>(5)
       for details). This is particularly useful for large data configured with these two options. Example:

   <b>StandardInputData</b>
       Configures arbitrary textual or binary data to pass  via  file  descriptor  0  (STDIN)  to  the  executed
       processes. These settings have no effect unless "StandardInput" is set to "data" (which is the default if
       "StandardInput" is not set otherwise, but "StandardInputText"/"StandardInputData" is). Use this option to

   <b>LogLevelMax</b>
       Configures  filtering  by log level of log messages generated by this unit. Takes a syslog log level, one
       of "emerg" (lowest log level,  only  highest  priority  messages),  "alert",  "crit",  "err",  "warning",
       "notice",  "info", "debug" (highest log level, also lowest priority messages). See <b><a href="../man3/syslog.3.html">syslog</a></b>(3) for details.
       By default no filtering is applied (i.e. the default maximum log level is "debug"). Use  this  option  to
       configure  the  logging  system to drop log messages of a specific service above the specified level. For
       example, set "LogLevelMax"="info" in order to turn off debug logging of a particularly chatty unit.  Note
       that  the  configured  level  is applied to any log messages written by any of the processes belonging to
       this unit, as well as any log messages written by the system manager process (PID 1) in reference to this
       unit, sent via any supported logging protocol. The filtering is applied early in  the  logging  pipeline,
       before  any  kind  of  further  processing  is  done.  Moreover,  messages which pass through this filter
       successfully might still be dropped by filters applied at a later stage in  the  logging  subsystem.  For
       example,  "MaxLevelStore"  configured in <b><a href="../man5/journald.conf.5.html">journald.conf</a></b>(5) might prohibit messages of higher log levels to
       be stored on disk, even though the per-unit "LogLevelMax" permitted it to be processed.   <u>Optional.</u>  <u>Type</u>
       <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>LogExtraFields</b>
       Configures additional log metadata fields to include in all log records generated by processes associated
       with this unit, including systemd. This setting takes one or more journal field assignments in the format
       "FIELD=VALUE"  separated  by  whitespace.  See <b><a href="../man7/systemd.journal-fields.7.html">systemd.journal-fields</a></b>(7) for details on the journal field
       concept. Even though the underlying journal implementation permits  binary  field  values,  this  setting
       accepts  only  valid  UTF-8  values.  To  include  space characters in a journal field value, enclose the
       assignment in double quotes (").  The usual specifiers are expanded in all assignments (see below).  Note
       that  this  setting  is  not  only useful for attaching additional metadata to log records of a unit, but
       given that all fields and values are indexed  may  also  be  used  to  implement  cross-unit  log  record
       matching. Assign an empty string to reset the list.

       Note  that  this  functionality is currently only available in system services, not in per-user services.
       <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>LogRateLimitIntervalSec</b>
       Configures the rate limiting that is applied to log messages generated by this unit.   If,  in  the  time
       interval  defined  by  "LogRateLimitIntervalSec", more messages than specified in "LogRateLimitBurst" are
       logged by a service, all further messages within the interval are dropped until the interval is  over.  A
       message   about   the   number   of   dropped   messages   is   generated.  The  time  specification  for
       "LogRateLimitIntervalSec" may be specified in the following units:  "s",  "min",  "h",  "ms",  "us".  See
       <b><a href="../man7/systemd.time.7.html">systemd.time</a></b>(7)  for details. The default settings are set by "RateLimitIntervalSec" and "RateLimitBurst"
       configured in <b><a href="../man5/journald.conf.5.html">journald.conf</a></b>(5).  Note that this only applies to log messages that are  processed  by  the
       logging  subsystem,  i.e.  by  <b><a href="../man8/systemd-journald.service.8.html">systemd-journald.service</a></b>(8).   This  means that if you connect a service's
       stderr directly to a file via "StandardOutput=file:…" or a similar setting, the rate limiting will not be
       applied to messages written that way (but it will be enforced for messages generated  via  <b><a href="../man3/syslog.3.html">syslog</a></b>(3)  and
       similar functions).  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>LogRateLimitBurst</b>
       Configures  the  rate  limiting  that is applied to log messages generated by this unit.  If, in the time
       interval defined by "LogRateLimitIntervalSec", more messages than specified  in  "LogRateLimitBurst"  are
       logged  by  a service, all further messages within the interval are dropped until the interval is over. A
       message  about  the  number  of   dropped   messages   is   generated.   The   time   specification   for
       "LogRateLimitIntervalSec"  may  be  specified  in  the  following units: "s", "min", "h", "ms", "us". See
       <b><a href="../man7/systemd.time.7.html">systemd.time</a></b>(7) for details. The default settings are set by "RateLimitIntervalSec" and  "RateLimitBurst"
       configured  in  <b><a href="../man5/journald.conf.5.html">journald.conf</a></b>(5).   Note that this only applies to log messages that are processed by the
       logging subsystem, i.e. by <b><a href="../man8/systemd-journald.service.8.html">systemd-journald.service</a></b>(8).  This means  that  if  you  connect  a  service's
       stderr directly to a file via "StandardOutput=file:…" or a similar setting, the rate limiting will not be
       applied  to  messages  written that way (but it will be enforced for messages generated via <b><a href="../man3/syslog.3.html">syslog</a></b>(3) and
       similar functions).  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>LogFilterPatterns</b>
       Define an extended regular expression to filter  log  messages  based  on  the  "MESSAGE"  field  of  the
       structured message. If the first character of the pattern is "~", log entries matching the pattern should
       be  discarded. This option takes a single pattern as an argument but can be used multiple times to create
       a list of allowed and denied patterns.  If the empty string is assigned, the filter  is  reset,  and  all
       prior assignments will have no effect.

       Because  the  "~" character is used to define denied patterns, it must be replaced with "\x7e" to allow a
       message starting with "~". For example, "~foobar" would add a pattern matching "foobar" to the deny list,
       while "\x7efoobar" would add a pattern matching "~foobar" to the allow list.

       Log messages are tested against denied patterns (if any), then against allowed patterns (if  any).  If  a
       log  message  matches any of the denied patterns, it is discarded immediately without considering allowed
       patterns. Remaining log messages are tested against allowed patterns. Messages matching against  none  of
       the  allowed  pattern  are discarded. If no allowed patterns are defined, then all messages are processed
       directly after going through denied filters.

       Filtering is based on the unit for which "LogFilterPatterns" is defined, meaning log messages coming from
       <b><a href="../man1/systemd.1.html">systemd</a></b>(1) about the unit are not taken into  account.  Filtered  log  messages  won't  be  forwarded  to
       traditional  syslog  daemons, the kernel log buffer (kmsg), the systemd console, or sent as wall messages
       to all logged-in users.

       Note that this functionality is currently only available in system services, not  in  per-user  services.
       <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>LogNamespace</b>
       Run  the  unit's  processes  in  the  specified  journal  namespace.  Expects a short user-defined string
       identifying the namespace. If not used the processes of the  service  are  run  in  the  default  journal
       namespace, i.e. their log stream is collected and processed by "systemd-journald.service". If this option
       is  used any log data generated by processes of this unit (regardless if via the <b>syslog()</b>, journal native
       logging  or   stdout/stderr   logging)   is   collected   and   processed   by   an   instance   of   the
       "systemd-journald@.service"  template unit, which manages the specified namespace. The log data is stored
       in a data store independent from the default log namespace's data store. See  <b><a href="../man8/systemd-journald.service.8.html">systemd-journald.service</a></b>(8)
       for details about journal namespaces.

       Internally,  journal  namespaces  are  implemented  through Linux mount namespacing and over-mounting the
       directory that contains the relevant "AF_UNIX" sockets used for logging in the  unit's  mount  namespace.
       Since  mount namespaces are used this setting disconnects propagation of mounts from the unit's processes
       to the host, similarly  to  how  "ReadOnlyPaths"  and  similar  settings  describe  above  work.  Journal
       namespaces may hence not be used for services that need to establish mount points on the host.

       When  this  option  is used the unit will automatically gain ordering and requirement dependencies on the
       two socket units associated with the "systemd-journald@.service" instance so that they are  automatically
       established  prior to the unit starting up. Note that when this option is used log output of this service
       does not appear in the regular <b><a href="../man1/journalctl.1.html">journalctl</a></b>(1) output, unless the "--namespace=" option is used.  <u>Optional.</u>
       <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>SyslogIdentifier</b>
       Sets the process name ("syslog tag") to prefix log lines sent to the logging system  or  the  kernel  log
       buffer with. If not set, defaults to the process name of the executed process. This option is only useful
       when  "StandardOutput"  or  "StandardError"  are  set  to "journal" or "kmsg" (or to the same settings in
       combination with "+console") and only applies to log messages written to  stdout  or  stderr.   <u>Optional.</u>
       <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>SyslogFacility</b>
       Sets the syslog facility identifier to use when logging. One of "kern", "user", "mail", "daemon", "auth",
       "syslog",  "lpr",  "news",  "uucp",  "cron",  "authpriv",  "ftp", "local0", "local1", "local2", "local3",
       "local4", "local5", "local6" or "local7". See <b><a href="../man3/syslog.3.html">syslog</a></b>(3) for details. This  option  is  only  useful  when
       "StandardOutput"  or  "StandardError"  are  set  to  "journal"  or  "kmsg"  (or  to  the same settings in
       combination with "+console"), and only applies to log messages written to stdout or stderr.  Defaults  to
       "daemon".  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>SyslogLevel</b>
       The  default  syslog log level to use when logging to the logging system or the kernel log buffer. One of
       "emerg", "alert", "crit", "err", "warning", "notice", "info", "debug". See <b><a href="../man3/syslog.3.html">syslog</a></b>(3)  for  details.  This
       option  is only useful when "StandardOutput" or "StandardError" are set to "journal" or "kmsg" (or to the
       same settings in combination with "+console"), and only applies to log  messages  written  to  stdout  or
       stderr.  Note  that  individual  lines  output by executed processes may be prefixed with a different log
       level which can be used to override the default log level specified here.  The  interpretation  of  these
       prefixes may be disabled with "SyslogLevelPrefix", see below. For details, see <b><a href="../man3/sd-daemon.3.html">sd-daemon</a></b>(3).  Defaults to
       "info".  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>SyslogLevelPrefix</b>
       Takes  a boolean argument. If true and "StandardOutput" or "StandardError" are set to "journal" or "kmsg"
       (or to the same settings in combination with "+console"), log lines written by the executed process  that
       are prefixed with a log level will be processed with this log level set but the prefix removed. If set to
       false,  the  interpretation  of these prefixes is disabled and the logged lines are passed on as-is. This
       only applies to log messages  written  to  stdout  or  stderr.  For  details  about  this  prefixing  see
       <b><a href="../man3/sd-daemon.3.html">sd-daemon</a></b>(3).  Defaults to true.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>boolean.</u>

   <b>TTYPath</b>
       Sets  the  terminal  device  node  to use if standard input, output, or error are connected to a TTY (see
       above). Defaults to "/dev/console".  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>TTYReset</b>
       Reset the terminal device specified with "TTYPath" before and after execution. This does  not  erase  the
       screen (see "TTYVTDisallocate" below for that). Defaults to "no".  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>TTYVHangup</b>
       Disconnect  all  clients  which have opened the terminal device specified with "TTYPath" before and after
       execution. Defaults to "no".  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>TTYColumns</b>
       Configure the size of the TTY specified with "TTYPath". If unset or  set  to  the  empty  string,  it  is
       attempted  to  retrieve  the  dimensions of the terminal screen via ANSI sequences, and if that fails the
       kernel defaults (typically 80x24) are used.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>TTYRows</b>
       Configure the size of the TTY specified with "TTYPath". If unset or  set  to  the  empty  string,  it  is
       attempted  to  retrieve  the  dimensions of the terminal screen via ANSI sequences, and if that fails the
       kernel defaults (typically 80x24) are used.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>TTYVTDisallocate</b>
       If the terminal device specified with "TTYPath" is a virtual console terminal, try to deallocate the  TTY
       before  and  after  execution.  This  ensures  that  the  screen and scrollback buffer is cleared. If the
       terminal device is of any other type of TTY an attempt is made to clear the screen  via  ANSI  sequences.
       Defaults to "no".  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>LoadCredential</b>
       Pass  a credential to the unit. Credentials are limited-size binary or textual objects that may be passed
       to unit processes. They are primarily used for passing cryptographic keys (both public  and  private)  or
       certificates,  user  account  information  or  identity  information  from  host to services. The data is
       accessible from the unit's processes via the file system, at a read-only location that (if  possible  and
       permitted) is backed by non-swappable memory. The data is only accessible to the user associated with the
       unit,  via  the "User"/"DynamicUser" settings (as well as the superuser). When available, the location of
       credentials is exported as the $CREDENTIALS_DIRECTORY environment variable to the unit's processes.

       The "LoadCredential" setting takes a textual ID to use as name for a credential plus a file system  path,
       separated by a colon. The ID must be a short ASCII string suitable as filename in the filesystem, and may
       be  chosen  freely  by  the  user. If the specified path is absolute it is opened as regular file and the
       credential data is read from it. If the absolute path refers to an "AF_UNIX" stream socket  in  the  file
       system  a  connection  is  made  to it (only once at unit start-up) and the credential data read from the
       connection, providing an easy IPC integration point for dynamically transferring credentials  from  other
       services.

       If the specified path is not absolute and itself qualifies as valid credential identifier it is attempted
       to  find  a  credential  that the service manager itself received under the specified name — which may be
       used to propagate credentials from an invoking environment (e.g. a container  manager  that  invoked  the
       service   manager)  into  a  service.  If  no  matching  system  credential  is  found,  the  directories
       "<a href="file:/etc/credstore/">/etc/credstore/</a>",  "/run/credstore/"  and  "/usr/lib/credstore/"  are  searched  for  files  under   the
       credential's   name   —   which  hence  are  recommended  locations  for  credential  data  on  disk.  If
       "LoadCredentialEncrypted"   is   used   "/run/credstore.encrypted/",   "<a href="file:/etc/credstore.encrypted/">/etc/credstore.encrypted/</a>",   and
       "/usr/lib/credstore.encrypted/" are searched as well.

       If  the  file  system path is omitted it is chosen identical to the credential name, i.e. this is a terse
       way to declare credentials to inherit from the service manager into a service. This option  may  be  used
       multiple times, each time defining an additional credential to pass to the unit.

       Note  that if the path is not specified or a valid credential identifier is given, i.e.  in the above two
       cases, a missing credential is not considered fatal.

       If an absolute path referring to a directory is specified, every file  in  that  directory  (recursively)
       will be loaded as a separate credential. The ID for each credential will be the provided ID suffixed with
       "_$FILENAME" (e.g., "Key_file1"). When loading from a directory, symlinks will be ignored.

       The contents of the file/socket may be arbitrary binary or textual data, including newline characters and
       "NUL" bytes.

       The  "LoadCredentialEncrypted"  setting is identical to "LoadCredential", except that the credential data
       is decrypted and authenticated before being passed  on  to  the  executed  processes.  Specifically,  the
       referenced  path  should  refer  to  a  file  or  socket  with an encrypted credential, as implemented by
       <b><a href="../man1/systemd-creds.1.html">systemd-creds</a></b>(1). This credential is loaded, decrypted, authenticated and then passed to the  application
       in  plaintext  form,  in  the  same  way  a regular credential specified via "LoadCredential" would be. A
       credential configured this way may be symmetrically encrypted/authenticated with  a  secret  key  derived
       from     the    system's    TPM2    security    chip,    or    with    a    secret    key    stored    in
       "/var/lib/systemd/credentials.secret", or  with  both.  Using  encrypted  and  authenticated  credentials
       improves  security  as  credentials are not stored in plaintext and only authenticated and decrypted into
       plaintext the moment a service requiring them is started. Moreover, credentials may be bound to the local
       hardware and installations, so that they cannot easily be analyzed offline, or be  generated  externally.
       When  "DevicePolicy"  is  set  to  "closed"  or  "strict",  or set to "auto" and "DeviceAllow" is set, or
       "PrivateDevices" is set, then this setting adds  "/dev/tpmrm0"  with  "rw"  mode  to  "DeviceAllow".  See
       <b><a href="../man5/systemd.resource-control.5.html">systemd.resource-control</a></b>(5) for the details about "DevicePolicy" or "DeviceAllow".

       Note  that  encrypted credentials targeted for services of the per-user service manager must be encrypted
       with systemd-creds encrypt --user, and those for the system service manager without the "--user"  switch.
       Encrypted  credentials are always targeted to a specific user or the system as a whole, and it is ensured
       that per-user service managers cannot decrypt secrets intended for the system or for other users.

       The credential files/IPC sockets must be accessible to the service manager, but don't have to be directly
       accessible to the unit's processes: the credential data is  read  and  copied  into  separate,  read-only
       copies  for  the  unit  that  are  accessible to appropriately privileged processes. This is particularly
       useful in combination with "DynamicUser" as this way privileged data can be made available  to  processes
       running  under  a  dynamic  UID (i.e. not a previously known one) without having to open up access to all
       users.

       In order to reference the path a credential may be read  from  within  a  "ExecStart"  command  line  use
       "${CREDENTIALS_DIRECTORY}/mycred",  e.g.  "ExecStart=cat  ${CREDENTIALS_DIRECTORY}/mycred".  In  order to
       reference the path a credential may be read from  within  a  "Environment"  line  use  "%d/mycred",  e.g.
       "Environment=MYCREDPATH=%d/mycred".   For   system   services   the   path  may  also  be  referenced  as
       "/run/credentials/UNITNAME" in cases where no interpolation is  possible,  e.g.  configuration  files  of
       software that does not yet support credentials natively. $CREDENTIALS_DIRECTORY is considered the primary
       interface to look for credentials, though, since it also works for user services.

       Currently, an accumulated credential size limit of 1 MB per unit is enforced.

       The  service  manager  itself  may  receive  system credentials that can be propagated to services from a
       hosting    container    manager     or     VM     hypervisor.     See     the     Container     Interface
       &lt;https://systemd.io/CONTAINER_INTERFACE&gt; documentation for details about the former. For the latter, pass
       DMI/SMBIOS &lt;https://www.dmtf.org/standards/smbios&gt; OEM string table entries (field type 11) with a prefix
       of  "io.systemd.credential:" or "io.systemd.credential.binary:". In both cases a key/value pair separated
       by "=" is expected, in the latter case the right-hand side is Base64 decoded when parsed (thus permitting
       binary data to be passed in). Example qemu  &lt;https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/system/index.html&gt;  switch:
       "-smbios               type=11,value=io.systemd.credential:xx=yy",               or              "-smbios
       type=11,value=io.systemd.credential.binary:rick=TmV2ZXIgR29ubmEgR2l2ZSBZb3UgVXA=". Alternatively, use the
       qemu    "fw_cfg"    node     "opt/io.systemd.credentials/".     Example     qemu     switch:     "-fw_cfg
       name=opt/io.systemd.credentials/mycred,string=supersecret".  They  may  also  be  passed  from  the  UEFI
       firmware environment via <b><a href="../man7/systemd-stub.7.html">systemd-stub</a></b>(7), from the initrd (see <b><a href="../man1/systemd.1.html">systemd</a></b>(1)), or be specified on the kernel
       command line using  the  "systemd.set_credential="  and  "systemd.set_credential_binary="  switches  (see
       <b><a href="../man1/systemd.1.html">systemd</a></b>(1) – this is not recommended since unprivileged userspace can read the kernel command line).

       If  referencing  an "AF_UNIX" stream socket to connect to, the connection will originate from an abstract
       namespace socket, that includes information about the unit and the credential ID in its socket name.  Use
       <b><a href="../man2/getpeername.2.html">getpeername</a></b>(2)  to  query this information. The returned socket name is formatted as "NUL"RANDOM "/unit/"
       UNIT"/" ID, i.e. a "NUL" byte (as required for abstract namespace socket names),  followed  by  a  random
       string  (consisting of alphadecimal characters), followed by the literal string "/unit/", followed by the
       requesting unit name, followed by the literal character  "/",  followed  by  the  textual  credential  ID
       requested.  Example:  "\0adf9d86b6eda275e/unit/foobar.service/credx"  in  case  the credential "credx" is
       requested for a unit "foobar.service". This functionality is useful for using a single  listening  socket
       to serve credentials to multiple consumers.

   <b>LoadCredentialEncrypted</b>
       Pass a credential to the unit. Credentials are limited-size binary or textual objects that may be  passed
       to  unit  processes.  They are primarily used for passing cryptographic keys (both public and private) or
       certificates, user account information or identity  information  from  host  to  services.  The  data  is
       accessible  from  the unit's processes via the file system, at a read-only location that (if possible and
       permitted) is backed by non-swappable memory. The data is only accessible to the user associated with the
       unit, via the "User"/"DynamicUser" settings (as well as the superuser). When available, the  location  of
       credentials is exported as the $CREDENTIALS_DIRECTORY environment variable to the unit's processes.

       The  "LoadCredential" setting takes a textual ID to use as name for a credential plus a file system path,
       separated by a colon. The ID must be a short ASCII string suitable as filename in the filesystem, and may
       be chosen freely by the user. If the specified path is absolute it is opened  as  regular  file  and  the
       credential  data  is  read from it. If the absolute path refers to an "AF_UNIX" stream socket in the file
       system a connection is made to it (only once at unit start-up) and the  credential  data  read  from  the
       connection,  providing  an easy IPC integration point for dynamically transferring credentials from other
       services.

       If the specified path is not absolute and itself qualifies as valid credential identifier it is attempted
       to find a credential that the service manager itself received under the specified name  —  which  may  be
       used  to  propagate  credentials  from an invoking environment (e.g. a container manager that invoked the
       service  manager)  into  a  service.  If  no  matching  system  credential  is  found,  the   directories
       "<a href="file:/etc/credstore/">/etc/credstore/</a>",   "/run/credstore/"  and  "/usr/lib/credstore/"  are  searched  for  files  under  the
       credential's  name  —  which  hence  are  recommended  locations  for  credential  data   on   disk.   If
       "LoadCredentialEncrypted"   is   used   "/run/credstore.encrypted/",   "<a href="file:/etc/credstore.encrypted/">/etc/credstore.encrypted/</a>",   and
       "/usr/lib/credstore.encrypted/" are searched as well.

       If the file system path is omitted it is chosen identical to the credential name, i.e. this  is  a  terse
       way  to  declare  credentials to inherit from the service manager into a service. This option may be used
       multiple times, each time defining an additional credential to pass to the unit.

       Note that if the path is not specified or a valid credential identifier is given, i.e.  in the above  two
       cases, a missing credential is not considered fatal.

       If  an  absolute  path  referring to a directory is specified, every file in that directory (recursively)
       will be loaded as a separate credential. The ID for each credential will be the provided ID suffixed with
       "_$FILENAME" (e.g., "Key_file1"). When loading from a directory, symlinks will be ignored.

       The contents of the file/socket may be arbitrary binary or textual data, including newline characters and
       "NUL" bytes.

       The "LoadCredentialEncrypted" setting is identical to "LoadCredential", except that the  credential  data
       is  decrypted  and  authenticated  before  being  passed  on to the executed processes. Specifically, the
       referenced path should refer to a file  or  socket  with  an  encrypted  credential,  as  implemented  by
       <b><a href="../man1/systemd-creds.1.html">systemd-creds</a></b>(1).  This credential is loaded, decrypted, authenticated and then passed to the application
       in plaintext form, in the same way a regular  credential  specified  via  "LoadCredential"  would  be.  A
       credential  configured  this  way  may be symmetrically encrypted/authenticated with a secret key derived
       from    the    system's    TPM2    security    chip,    or    with    a    secret    key    stored     in
       "/var/lib/systemd/credentials.secret",  or  with  both.  Using  encrypted  and  authenticated credentials
       improves security as credentials are not stored in plaintext and only authenticated  and  decrypted  into
       plaintext the moment a service requiring them is started. Moreover, credentials may be bound to the local
       hardware  and  installations, so that they cannot easily be analyzed offline, or be generated externally.
       When "DevicePolicy" is set to "closed" or "strict", or  set  to  "auto"  and  "DeviceAllow"  is  set,  or
       "PrivateDevices"  is  set,  then  this  setting  adds  "/dev/tpmrm0" with "rw" mode to "DeviceAllow". See
       <b><a href="../man5/systemd.resource-control.5.html">systemd.resource-control</a></b>(5) for the details about "DevicePolicy" or "DeviceAllow".

       Note that encrypted credentials targeted for services of the per-user service manager must  be  encrypted
       with  systemd-creds encrypt --user, and those for the system service manager without the "--user" switch.
       Encrypted credentials are always targeted to a specific user or the system as a whole, and it is  ensured

       name=opt/io.systemd.credentials/mycred,string=supersecret".  They  may  also  be  passed  from  the  UEFI
       firmware environment via <b><a href="../man7/systemd-stub.7.html">systemd-stub</a></b>(7), from the initrd (see <b><a href="../man1/systemd.1.html">systemd</a></b>(1)), or be specified on the kernel

       documentation.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>ImportCredential</b>
       Pass  one  or  more  credentials  to  the unit. Takes a credential name for which we'll attempt to find a
       credential that the service manager itself received under the specified name  —  which  may  be  used  to
       propagate  credentials  from  an  invoking environment (e.g. a container manager that invoked the service
       manager) into a service. If the credential name is a glob, all credentials matching the glob  are  passed
       to  the  unit.  Matching  credentials  are  searched  for in the system credentials, the encrypted system
       credentials,     and     under     "<a href="file:/etc/credstore/">/etc/credstore/</a>",      "/run/credstore/",      "/usr/lib/credstore/",
       "/run/credstore.encrypted/",  "<a href="file:/etc/credstore.encrypted/">/etc/credstore.encrypted/</a>",  and  "/usr/lib/credstore.encrypted/"  in that
       order. When multiple credentials of the same name are found, the first one found is used.

       The globbing expression implements a restrictive subset of <b><a href="../man7/glob.7.html">glob</a></b>(7): only a single trailing  "*"  wildcard
       may be specified. Both "?" and "[]" wildcards are not permitted, nor are "*" wildcards anywhere except at
       the end of the glob expression.

       Optionally,  the  credential  name  or  glob may be followed by a colon followed by a rename pattern.  If
       specified, all credentials matching the credential name or  glob  are  renamed  according  to  the  given
       pattern.  For  example,  if "ImportCredential=my.original.cred:my.renamed.cred" is specified, the service
       manager will read the "my.original.cred" credential  and  make  it  available  as  the  "my.renamed.cred"
       credential  to  the service. Similarly, if "ImportCredential=my.original.*:my.renamed." is specified, the
       service manager will read all credentials  starting  with  "my.original."  and  make  them  available  as
       "my.renamed.xxx" to the service.

       If  "ImportCredential"  is  specified  multiple  times and multiple credentials end up with the same name
       after renaming, the first one is kept and later ones are dropped.

       When multiple credentials of  the  same  name  are  found,  credentials  found  by  "LoadCredential"  and
       "LoadCredentialEncrypted"  take  priority  over  credentials found by "ImportCredential".  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u>
       <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>SetCredential</b>
       The "SetCredential" setting is similar to "LoadCredential" but accepts a literal value to use as data for
       the credential, instead of a file system path to read the data from. Do not use this option for data that
       is supposed to be secret, as it is accessible to unprivileged processes via IPC. It's only  safe  to  use
       this  for  user  IDs,  public  key  material  and  similar  non-sensitive  data.  For everything else use
       "LoadCredential". In order to embed binary data into the credential data use C-style escaping (i.e.  "\n"
       to embed a newline, or "\x00" to embed a "NUL" byte).

       The  "SetCredentialEncrypted" setting is identical to "SetCredential" but expects an encrypted credential
       in literal form as value. This allows embedding confidential credentials securely directly in unit files.
       Use <b><a href="../man1/systemd-creds.1.html">systemd-creds</a></b>(1)' "-p" switch to  generate  suitable  "SetCredentialEncrypted"  lines  directly  from
       plaintext credentials. For further details see "LoadCredentialEncrypted" above.

       When   multiple  credentials  of  the  same  name  are  found,  credentials  found  by  "LoadCredential",
       "LoadCredentialEncrypted" and "ImportCredential" take priority over credentials found by "SetCredential".
       As such, "SetCredential" will act as default if no credentials are found by any of the  former.  In  this
       case  not  being  able  to  retrieve  the  credential  from  the  path  specified  in "LoadCredential" or
       "LoadCredentialEncrypted" is not considered fatal.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>UtmpIdentifier</b>
       Takes a four character identifier string for an <b><a href="../man5/utmp.5.html">utmp</a></b>(5) and wtmp entry for this service. This should only
       be set for services such as getty implementations (such as <b><a href="../man8/agetty.8.html">agetty</a></b>(8)) where  utmp/wtmp  entries  must  be
       created  and  cleared  before and after execution, or for services that shall be executed as if they were
       run by a getty process (see below). If the configured string  is  longer  than  four  characters,  it  is
       truncated  and  the  terminal  four  characters  are  used.  This  setting  interprets  %I  style  string
       replacements. This setting is unset by default, i.e. no utmp/wtmp entries are created or cleaned  up  for
       this service.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>UtmpMode</b>
       Takes  one  of "init", "login" or "user". If "UtmpIdentifier" is set, controls which type of <b><a href="../man5/utmp.5.html">utmp</a></b>(5)/wtmp
       entries for this service are generated. This setting has no effect unless "UtmpIdentifier" is set too. If
       "init" is set, only an "INIT_PROCESS" entry is generated and the invoked process must implement a  getty-
       compatible   utmp/wtmp  logic.  If  "login"  is  set,  first  an  "INIT_PROCESS"  entry,  followed  by  a
       "LOGIN_PROCESS"  entry  is  generated.  In  this   case,   the   invoked   process   must   implement   a
       <b><a href="../man1/login.1.html">login</a></b>(1)-compatible   utmp/wtmp  logic.  If  "user"  is  set,  first  an  "INIT_PROCESS"  entry,  then  a
       "LOGIN_PROCESS" entry and finally a "USER_PROCESS" entry is generated. In this case, the invoked  process
       may  be  any  process  that  is suitable to be run as session leader. Defaults to "init".  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u>
       <u>enum.</u> <u>choice:</u> <u>'init',</u> <u>'login',</u> <u>'user'.</u>

   <b>KillMode</b>
       Specifies how processes of this unit shall be killed. One of "control-group", "mixed", "process", "none".

       If set to "control-group", all remaining processes in the control group of this unit will  be  killed  on
       unit  stop  (for  services: after the stop command is executed, as configured with "ExecStop"). If set to
       "mixed", the "SIGTERM" signal (see below) is sent to the main  process  while  the  subsequent  "SIGKILL"
       signal  (see  below) is sent to all remaining processes of the unit's control group. If set to "process",
       only the main process itself is killed (not recommended!).  If  set  to  "none",  no  process  is  killed
       (strongly  recommended  against!). In this case, only the stop command will be executed on unit stop, but
       no process will be killed otherwise.  Processes remaining alive after stop  are  left  in  their  control
       group and the control group continues to exist after stop unless empty.

       Note  that  it is not recommended to set "KillMode" to "process" or even "none", as this allows processes
       to escape the service manager's lifecycle and resource management, and to remain running even while their
       service is considered stopped and is assumed to not consume any resources.

       Processes will first be terminated via "SIGTERM" (unless the signal to send is changed  via  "KillSignal"
       or  "RestartKillSignal").  Optionally,  this  is  immediately  followed  by  a  "SIGHUP" (if enabled with
       "SendSIGHUP"). If processes still remain after: the main  process  of  a  unit  has  exited  (applies  to
       "KillMode":  "mixed")the  delay  configured  via  the "TimeoutStopSec" has passed (applies to "KillMode":
       "control-group", "mixed", "process") the termination request is repeated with the "SIGKILL" signal or the
       signal specified via "FinalKillSignal" (unless this  is  disabled  via  the  "SendSIGKILL"  option).  See
       <b><a href="../man2/kill.2.html">kill</a></b>(2) for more information.

       Defaults to "control-group".  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>KillSignal</b>
       Specifies  which  signal  to  use when stopping a service. This controls the signal that is sent as first
       step of shutting down a unit (see above), and is usually followed by "SIGKILL" (see above and below). For
       a list of valid signals, see <b><a href="../man7/signal.7.html">signal</a></b>(7).  Defaults to "SIGTERM".

       Note that, right after sending the signal specified in this setting, systemd will always send  "SIGCONT",
       to ensure that even suspended tasks can be terminated cleanly.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>RestartKillSignal</b>
       Specifies  which  signal to use when restarting a service. The same as "KillSignal" described above, with
       the exception that this setting is used in  a  restart  job.  Not  set  by  default,  and  the  value  of
       "KillSignal" is used.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>SendSIGHUP</b>
       Specifies whether to send "SIGHUP" to remaining processes immediately after sending the signal configured
       with "KillSignal". This is useful to indicate to shells and shell-like programs that their connection has
       been severed. Takes a boolean value. Defaults to "no".   <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>boolean.</u>

   <b>SendSIGKILL</b>
       Specifies whether to send "SIGKILL" (or the signal specified by "FinalKillSignal") to remaining processes
       after  a timeout, if the normal shutdown procedure left processes of the service around. When disabled, a
       "KillMode" of "control-group" or "mixed" service will not restart if processes from prior services  exist
       within the control group.  Takes a boolean value. Defaults to "yes".   <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>boolean.</u>

   <b>FinalKillSignal</b>
       Specifies  which  signal  to send to remaining processes after a timeout if "SendSIGKILL" is enabled. The
       signal configured here should be one that is not typically caught and processed by services ("SIGTERM" is
       not suitable). Developers can find it useful to use this to generate a coredump  to  troubleshoot  why  a
       service  did  not  terminate  upon  receiving  the  initial  "SIGTERM"  signal.  This  can be achieved by
       configuring "LimitCORE" and setting "FinalKillSignal" to either  "SIGQUIT"  or  "SIGABRT".   Defaults  to
       "SIGKILL".   <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>WatchdogSignal</b>
       Specifies which signal to use to terminate the service when the watchdog timeout expires (enabled through
       "WatchdogSec"). Defaults to "SIGABRT".   <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>Type</b>
       Configures  the  mechanism  via  which  the  service  notifies  the manager that the service start-up has
       finished. One of "simple", "exec", "forking", "oneshot", "dbus", "notify", "notify-reload", or "idle":

       It is recommended to use "Type"="exec" for long-running services, as it ensures that process setup errors
       (e.g. errors such as a missing service executable, or missing user) are  properly  tracked.  However,  as
       this  service type won't propagate the failures in the service's own startup code (as opposed to failures
       in the preparatory steps the service manager executes before <b>execve()</b>)  and  doesn't  allow  ordering  of
       other  units against completion of initialization of the service code itself (which for example is useful
       if clients need to connect to the service through  some  form  of  IPC,  and  the  IPC  channel  is  only
       established  by  the  service  itself  —  in  contrast  to doing this ahead of time through socket or bus
       activation or similar), it might not be sufficient for many cases. If so, "notify",  "notify-reload",  or
       "dbus" (the latter only in case the service provides a D-Bus interface) are the preferred options as they
       allow service program code to precisely schedule when to consider the service started up successfully and
       when to proceed with follow-up units. The "notify"/"notify-reload" service types require explicit support
       in  the  service  codebase (as <b>sd_notify()</b> or an equivalent API needs to be invoked by the service at the
       appropriate time) — if it's not supported, then "forking" is an alternative: it supports the  traditional
       heavy-weight UNIX service start-up protocol. Note that using any type other than "simple" possibly delays
       the  boot  process,  as  the  service  manager  needs to wait for at least some service initialization to
       complete. (Also note it is generally  not  recommended  to  use  "idle"  or  "oneshot"  for  long-running
       services.)

       Note  that  various  service  settings  (e.g.  "User", "Group" through libc NSS) might result in "hidden"
       blocking IPC calls to other services when used. Sometimes it might  be  advisable  to  use  the  "simple"
       service  type  to ensure that the service manager's transaction logic is not affected by such potentially
       slow operations and hidden dependencies, as this is the only service type where the service manager  will
       not  wait  for  such  service  execution  setup operations to complete before proceeding.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u>
       <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>ExitType</b>
       Specifies when the manager should consider the service to be finished. One of "main" or "cgroup":

       It is generally recommended to use "ExitType"="main" when a service has a known forking model and a  main
       process  can reliably be determined. "ExitType"="cgroup" is meant for applications whose forking model is
       not known ahead of time and which might not have a specific main process. It is well suited for transient
       or automatically generated services, such as graphical applications  inside  of  a  desktop  environment.
       <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>RemainAfterExit</b>
       Takes  a  boolean  value  that specifies whether the service shall be considered active even when all its
       processes exited. Defaults to "no".  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>boolean.</u>

   <b>GuessMainPID</b>
       Takes a boolean value that specifies whether systemd should try to guess the main PID of a service if  it
       cannot be determined reliably. This option is ignored unless "Type=forking" is set and "PIDFile" is unset
       because  for the other types or with an explicitly configured PID file, the main PID is always known. The
       guessing algorithm might come to incorrect conclusions if a daemon consists of more than one process.  If
       the  main PID cannot be determined, failure detection and automatic restarting of a service will not work
       reliably.  Defaults to "yes".  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>boolean.</u>

   <b>PIDFile</b>
       Takes a path referring to the PID file of the service. Usage of this option is recommended  for  services
       where  "Type"  is  set  to  "forking".  The path specified typically points to a file below "<a href="file:/run/">/run/</a>". If a
       relative path is specified it is hence prefixed with "<a href="file:/run/">/run/</a>". The service manager will read  the  PID  of
       the  main  process  of the service from this file after start-up of the service. The service manager will
       not write to the file configured here, although it will remove the file after the service has  shut  down
       if it still exists. The PID file does not need to be owned by a privileged user, but if it is owned by an
       unprivileged  user  additional  safety restrictions are enforced: the file may not be a symlink to a file
       owned by a different user (neither directly nor indirectly), and the PID file must  refer  to  a  process
       already belonging to the service.

       Note  that  PID  files  should  be avoided in modern projects. Use "Type=notify", "Type=notify-reload" or
       "Type=simple" where possible, which does not require use of PID files to determine the main process of  a
       service and avoids needless forking.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>BusName</b>
       Takes  a  D-Bus destination name that this service shall use. This option is mandatory for services where
       "Type" is set to "dbus". It is recommended to always set this property if known to make it  easy  to  map
       the service name to the D-Bus destination.  In particular, systemctl service-log-level/service-log-target
       verbs make use of this.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>ExecStart</b>
       Commands that are executed when this service is started.

       Unless  "Type" is "oneshot", exactly one command must be given. When "Type=oneshot" is used, this setting
       may be used multiple times to define multiple commands to execute. If the empty  string  is  assigned  to
       this  option,  the  list  of  commands  to  start is reset, prior assignments of this option will have no
       effect. If no "ExecStart" is specified, then the service must have "RemainAfterExit=yes" and at least one
       "ExecStop" line set. (Services lacking both "ExecStart" and "ExecStop" are not valid.)

       If more than one command is configured, the commands are invoked sequentially in the order they appear in
       the unit file. If one of the commands fails (and is not prefixed with "-"), other lines are not executed,
       and the unit is considered failed.

       Unless "Type=forking" is set, the process started via this command  line  will  be  considered  the  main
       process of the daemon.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>list</u> <u>of</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>ExecStartPre</b>
       Additional commands that are executed before or after the command in "ExecStart", respectively. Syntax is
       the  same  as  for "ExecStart".  Multiple command lines are allowed, regardless of the service type (i.e.
       "Type"), and the commands are executed one after the other, serially.

       If any of those commands (not prefixed with "-") fail,  the  rest  are  not  executed  and  the  unit  is
       considered failed.

       "ExecStart"  commands  are  only  run after all "ExecStartPre" commands that were not prefixed with a "-"
       exit successfully.

       "ExecStartPost" commands are only run after the commands  specified  in  "ExecStart"  have  been  invoked
       successfully,  as  determined  by  "Type"  (i.e.  the  process  has  been  started  for  "Type=simple" or
       "Type=idle", the last "ExecStart" process exited successfully for  "Type=oneshot",  the  initial  process
       exited  successfully for "Type=forking", "READY=1" is sent for "Type=notify"/"Type=notify-reload", or the
       "BusName" has been taken for "Type=dbus").

       Note that "ExecStartPre" may not be used to start long-running processes. All  processes  forked  off  by
       processes invoked via "ExecStartPre" will be killed before the next service process is run.

       Note  that  if any of the commands specified in "ExecStartPre", "ExecStart", or "ExecStartPost" fail (and
       are not prefixed with "-", see above) or time out before the service is  fully  up,  execution  continues
       with commands specified in "ExecStopPost", the commands in "ExecStop" are skipped.

       Note  that  the  execution  of  "ExecStartPost" is taken into account for the purpose of "Before"/"After"
       ordering constraints.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>list</u> <u>of</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>ExecStartPost</b>
       Additional commands that are executed before or after the command in "ExecStart", respectively. Syntax is
       the same as for "ExecStart".  Multiple command lines are allowed, regardless of the  service  type  (i.e.
       "Type"), and the commands are executed one after the other, serially.

       If  any  of  those  commands  (not  prefixed  with  "-")  fail, the rest are not executed and the unit is
       considered failed.

       "ExecStart" commands are only run after all "ExecStartPre" commands that were not  prefixed  with  a  "-"
       exit successfully.

       "ExecStartPost"  commands  are  only  run  after  the commands specified in "ExecStart" have been invoked
       successfully, as  determined  by  "Type"  (i.e.  the  process  has  been  started  for  "Type=simple"  or
       "Type=idle",  the  last  "ExecStart"  process exited successfully for "Type=oneshot", the initial process
       exited successfully for "Type=forking", "READY=1" is sent for "Type=notify"/"Type=notify-reload", or  the
       "BusName" has been taken for "Type=dbus").

       Note  that  "ExecStartPre"  may  not be used to start long-running processes. All processes forked off by
       processes invoked via "ExecStartPre" will be killed before the next service process is run.

       Note that if any of the commands specified in "ExecStartPre", "ExecStart", or "ExecStartPost"  fail  (and
       are  not  prefixed  with  "-", see above) or time out before the service is fully up, execution continues
       with commands specified in "ExecStopPost", the commands in "ExecStop" are skipped.

       Note that the execution of "ExecStartPost" is taken into account  for  the  purpose  of  "Before"/"After"
       ordering constraints.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>list</u> <u>of</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>ExecCondition</b>
       Optional  commands  that  are  executed  before the commands in "ExecStartPre". Syntax is the same as for
       "ExecStart". Multiple command lines are allowed, regardless of the service type (i.e.  "Type"),  and  the
       commands are executed one after the other, serially.

       The  behavior is like an "ExecStartPre" and condition check hybrid: when an "ExecCondition" command exits
       with exit code 1 through 254 (inclusive), the remaining commands are skipped and the unit is  not  marked
       as failed. However, if an "ExecCondition" command exits with 255 or abnormally (e.g. timeout, killed by a
       signal,  etc.), the unit will be considered failed (and remaining commands will be skipped). Exit code of
       0 or those matching "SuccessExitStatus" will continue execution to the next commands.

       The same recommendations about not running long-running  processes  in  "ExecStartPre"  also  applies  to
       "ExecCondition".  "ExecCondition"  will  also run the commands in "ExecStopPost", as part of stopping the
       service, in the case of any non-zero or abnormal exits, like the ones described  above.   <u>Optional.</u>  <u>Type</u>
       <u>list</u> <u>of</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>ExecReload</b>
       Commands  to  execute  to  trigger  a  configuration  reload in the service. This argument takes multiple
       command lines, following the same scheme as described for "ExecStart"  above.  Use  of  this  setting  is
       optional.  Specifier and environment variable substitution is supported here following the same scheme as
       for "ExecStart".

       One additional, special environment variable is set: if known, $MAINPID is set to the main process of the
       daemon, and may be used for command lines like the following:

           ExecReload=kill -HUP $MAINPID

       Note however that reloading a daemon by enqueuing a signal (as with the example line  above)  is  usually
       not a good choice, because this is an asynchronous operation and hence not suitable when ordering reloads
       of   multiple   services   against   each   other.   It  is  thus  strongly  recommended  to  either  use
       "Type"="notify-reload" in place of "ExecReload", or to set  "ExecReload"  to  a  command  that  not  only
       triggers  a  configuration  reload  of  the  daemon, but also synchronously waits for it to complete. For
       example, <b><a href="../man1/dbus-broker.1.html">dbus-broker</a></b>(1) uses the following:

           ExecReload=busctl call org.freedesktop.DBus \
           /org/freedesktop/DBus org.freedesktop.DBus \
           ReloadConfig
       . I&lt; Optional. Type list of uniline.  &gt;

   <b>ExecStop</b>
       Commands to execute to stop the service started via "ExecStart". This  argument  takes  multiple  command
       lines,  following  the  same  scheme as described for "ExecStart" above. Use of this setting is optional.
       After the commands configured in this option are run, it is implied that the service is stopped, and  any
       processes  remaining for it are terminated according to the "KillMode" setting (see <b><a href="../man5/systemd.kill.5.html">systemd.kill</a></b>(5)).  If
       this option is not specified, the process is terminated by sending the signal specified  in  "KillSignal"
       or "RestartKillSignal" when service stop is requested. Specifier and environment variable substitution is
       supported (including $MAINPID, see above).

       Note  that  it is usually not sufficient to specify a command for this setting that only asks the service
       to terminate (for example, by sending some form of termination signal to it), but does not wait for it to
       do so. Since the remaining processes of the services are killed according to "KillMode" and  "KillSignal"
       or  "RestartKillSignal" as described above immediately after the command exited, this may not result in a
       clean stop. The specified command should hence be a synchronous operation, not an asynchronous one.

       Note that the commands specified in "ExecStop" are only executed when the  service  started  successfully
       first.  They are not invoked if the service was never started at all, or in case its start-up failed, for
       example because any of the commands specified in "ExecStart", "ExecStartPre"  or  "ExecStartPost"  failed
       (and  weren't  prefixed  with  "-", see above) or timed out. Use "ExecStopPost" to invoke commands when a
       service failed to start up correctly and is shut down again. Also note that the stop operation is  always
       performed  if  the service started successfully, even if the processes in the service terminated on their
       own or were killed. The stop commands must be prepared to deal with that case. $MAINPID will be unset  if
       systemd knows that the main process exited by the time the stop commands are called.

       Service restart requests are implemented as stop operations followed by start operations. This means that
       "ExecStop" and "ExecStopPost" are executed during a service restart operation.

       It  is  recommended  to  use this setting for commands that communicate with the service requesting clean
       termination. For post-mortem clean-up steps use "ExecStopPost" instead.   <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>list</u> <u>of</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>ExecStopPost</b>
       Additional commands that are executed after the  service  is  stopped.  This  includes  cases  where  the
       commands  configured  in "ExecStop" were used, where the service does not have any "ExecStop" defined, or
       where the service exited unexpectedly. This argument takes multiple command  lines,  following  the  same
       scheme  as  described  for  "ExecStart".  Use  of  these  settings is optional. Specifier and environment
       variable substitution is supported. Note that – unlike "ExecStop" – commands specified with this  setting
       are invoked when a service failed to start up correctly and is shut down again.

       It  is  recommended  to  use  this  setting  for clean-up operations that shall be executed even when the
       service failed to start up correctly. Commands configured with this setting need to be  able  to  operate
       even  if  the  service  failed starting up half-way and left incompletely initialized data around. As the
       service's processes have likely exited already when the commands specified with this setting are executed
       they should not attempt to communicate with them.

       Note that all commands that are configured with this setting are invoked with  the  result  code  of  the
       service,  as  well  as the main process' exit code and status, set in the $SERVICE_RESULT, $EXIT_CODE and
       $EXIT_STATUS environment variables, see <b><a href="../man5/systemd.exec.5.html">systemd.exec</a></b>(5) for details.

       Note that the execution of "ExecStopPost" is taken into  account  for  the  purpose  of  "Before"/"After"
       ordering constraints.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>list</u> <u>of</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>RestartSec</b>
       Configures  the  time to sleep before restarting a service (as configured with "Restart").  Takes a unit-
       less value in seconds, or a time span value such as  "5min  20s".  Defaults  to  100ms.   <u>Optional.</u>  <u>Type</u>
       <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>RestartSteps</b>
       Configures  the  number  of  steps to take to increase the interval of auto-restarts from "RestartSec" to
       "RestartMaxDelaySec".  Takes a positive integer or 0 to disable it. Defaults to 0.

       This setting is effective only if "RestartMaxDelaySec" is also set.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>RestartMaxDelaySec</b>
       Configures the longest time  to  sleep  before  restarting  a  service  as  the  interval  goes  up  with
       "RestartSteps".  Takes  a value in the same format as "RestartSec", or "infinity" to disable the setting.
       Defaults to "infinity".

       This setting is effective only if "RestartSteps" is also set.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>TimeoutStartSec</b>
       Configures the time to wait for start-up. If a daemon service does not signal start-up completion  within
       the  configured  time,  the  service  will  be considered failed and will be shut down again. The precise
       action depends on the "TimeoutStartFailureMode" option. Takes a unit-less value in  seconds,  or  a  time
       span   value   such   as  "5min  20s".  Pass  "infinity"  to  disable  the  timeout  logic.  Defaults  to
       "DefaultTimeoutStartSec" set in the manager, except when  "Type=oneshot"  is  used,  in  which  case  the
       timeout is disabled by default (see <b><a href="../man5/systemd-system.conf.5.html">systemd-system.conf</a></b>(5)).

       If  a  service  of  "Type=notify"/"Type=notify-reload"  sends "EXTEND_TIMEOUT_USEC=…", this may cause the
       start time to be extended beyond "TimeoutStartSec". The first receipt of this message must  occur  before
       "TimeoutStartSec" is exceeded, and once the start time has extended beyond "TimeoutStartSec", the service
       manager will allow the service to continue to start, provided the service repeats "EXTEND_TIMEOUT_USEC=…"
       within  the  interval  specified  until  the  service  startup  status  is  finished  by  "READY=1". (see
       <b><a href="../man3/sd_notify.3.html">sd_notify</a></b>(3)).

       Note that the start timeout is also  applied  to  service  reloads,  regardless  if  implemented  through
       "ExecReload"  or  via the reload logic enabled via "Type=notify-reload".  If the reload does not complete
       within the configured time, the reload will be considered failed and the service  will  continue  running
       with  the  old configuration. This will not affect the running service, but will be logged and will cause
       e.g. systemctl reload to fail.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>TimeoutStopSec</b>
       This option serves two purposes. First, it configures the time to wait for each  "ExecStop"  command.  If
       any  of  them times out, subsequent "ExecStop" commands are skipped and the service will be terminated by
       "SIGTERM". If no "ExecStop" commands are specified, the service  gets  the  "SIGTERM"  immediately.  This
       default behavior can be changed by the "TimeoutStopFailureMode" option. Second, it configures the time to
       wait  for  the service itself to stop. If it doesn't terminate in the specified time, it will be forcibly
       terminated by "SIGKILL" (see "KillMode" in <b><a href="../man5/systemd.kill.5.html">systemd.kill</a></b>(5)).  Takes a unit-less value in  seconds,  or  a
       time  span  value  such  as  "5min  20s".  Pass  "infinity"  to  disable  the  timeout logic. Defaults to
       "DefaultTimeoutStopSec" from the manager configuration file (see <b><a href="../man5/systemd-system.conf.5.html">systemd-system.conf</a></b>(5)).

       If a service of "Type=notify"/"Type=notify-reload" sends "EXTEND_TIMEOUT_USEC=…", this may cause the stop
       time to be extended beyond "TimeoutStopSec".  The  first  receipt  of  this  message  must  occur  before
       "TimeoutStopSec"  is  exceeded,  and once the stop time has extended beyond "TimeoutStopSec", the service
       manager will allow the service to continue to stop, provided the service repeats  "EXTEND_TIMEOUT_USEC=…"
       within the interval specified, or terminates itself (see <b><a href="../man3/sd_notify.3.html">sd_notify</a></b>(3)).   <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>TimeoutAbortSec</b>
       This  option  configures  the  time  to  wait  for  the service to terminate when it was aborted due to a
       watchdog timeout (see "WatchdogSec"). If the service has a short "TimeoutStopSec" this option can be used
       to give the system more time to write a core dump of the service. Upon expiration  the  service  will  be
       forcibly  terminated by "SIGKILL" (see "KillMode" in <b><a href="../man5/systemd.kill.5.html">systemd.kill</a></b>(5)). The core file will be truncated in
       this case. Use "TimeoutAbortSec" to set a sensible timeout for the core dumping per service that is large
       enough to write all expected data while also being short enough to handle  the  service  failure  in  due
       time.

       Takes  a unit-less value in seconds, or a time span value such as "5min 20s". Pass an empty value to skip
       the dedicated watchdog abort timeout handling and fall back "TimeoutStopSec". Pass "infinity" to  disable
       the  timeout  logic.  Defaults  to  "DefaultTimeoutAbortSec"  from  the  manager  configuration file (see
       <b><a href="../man5/systemd-system.conf.5.html">systemd-system.conf</a></b>(5)).

       If a service of "Type=notify"/"Type=notify-reload" handles "SIGABRT" itself (instead of  relying  on  the
       kernel  to  write  a  core  dump)  it  can send "EXTEND_TIMEOUT_USEC=…" to extended the abort time beyond
       "TimeoutAbortSec". The first receipt of this message must occur before "TimeoutAbortSec" is exceeded, and
       once the abort time has extended beyond "TimeoutAbortSec", the service manager will allow the service  to
       continue to abort, provided the service repeats "EXTEND_TIMEOUT_USEC=…" within the interval specified, or
       terminates itself (see <b><a href="../man3/sd_notify.3.html">sd_notify</a></b>(3)).   <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>TimeoutSec</b>
       A  shorthand  for  configuring  both  "TimeoutStartSec"  and  "TimeoutStopSec"  to the specified value.
       <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>TimeoutStartFailureMode</b>
       These options configure the action that is taken in case a daemon service does not signal start-up within
       its configured "TimeoutStartSec", respectively if it does not stop within "TimeoutStopSec". Takes one  of
       "terminate", "abort" and "kill". Both options default to "terminate".

       If  "terminate"  is  set  the  service  will  be gracefully terminated by sending the signal specified in
       "KillSignal" (defaults to "SIGTERM",  see  <b><a href="../man5/systemd.kill.5.html">systemd.kill</a></b>(5)).  If  the  service  does  not  terminate  the
       "FinalKillSignal" is sent after "TimeoutStopSec". If "abort" is set, "WatchdogSignal" is sent instead and
       "TimeoutAbortSec" applies before sending "FinalKillSignal".  This setting may be used to analyze services
       that fail to start-up or shut-down intermittently.  By using "kill" the service is immediately terminated
       by  sending  "FinalKillSignal"  without  any  further  timeout.  This setting can be used to expedite the
       shutdown of failing services.   <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>enum.</u> <u>choice:</u> <u>'abort',</u> <u>'kill',</u> <u>'terminate'.</u>

   <b>TimeoutStopFailureMode</b>
       These options configure the action that is taken in case a daemon service does not signal start-up within
       its configured "TimeoutStartSec", respectively if it does not stop within "TimeoutStopSec". Takes one  of
       "terminate", "abort" and "kill". Both options default to "terminate".

       If  "terminate"  is  set  the  service  will  be gracefully terminated by sending the signal specified in
       "KillSignal" (defaults to "SIGTERM",  see  <b><a href="../man5/systemd.kill.5.html">systemd.kill</a></b>(5)).  If  the  service  does  not  terminate  the
       "FinalKillSignal" is sent after "TimeoutStopSec". If "abort" is set, "WatchdogSignal" is sent instead and
       "TimeoutAbortSec" applies before sending "FinalKillSignal".  This setting may be used to analyze services
       that fail to start-up or shut-down intermittently.  By using "kill" the service is immediately terminated
       by  sending  "FinalKillSignal"  without  any  further  timeout.  This setting can be used to expedite the
       shutdown of failing services.   <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>enum.</u> <u>choice:</u> <u>'abort',</u> <u>'kill',</u> <u>'terminate'.</u>

   <b>RuntimeMaxSec</b>
       Configures a maximum time for the service to run. If this is used and the service  has  been  active  for
       longer than the specified time it is terminated and put into a failure state. Note that this setting does
       not  have any effect on "Type=oneshot" services, as they terminate immediately after activation completed
       (use "TimeoutStartSec" to limit their activation).  Pass "infinity" (the default) to configure no runtime
       limit.

       If a service of "Type=notify"/"Type=notify-reload" sends  "EXTEND_TIMEOUT_USEC=…",  this  may  cause  the
       runtime  to  be  extended  beyond  "RuntimeMaxSec".  The  first receipt of this message must occur before
       "RuntimeMaxSec" is exceeded, and once the  runtime  has  extended  beyond  "RuntimeMaxSec",  the  service
       manager  will  allow the service to continue to run, provided the service repeats "EXTEND_TIMEOUT_USEC=…"
       within the interval specified until the service shutdown is achieved by  "STOPPING=1"  (or  termination).
       (see <b><a href="../man3/sd_notify.3.html">sd_notify</a></b>(3)).   <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>RuntimeRandomizedExtraSec</b>
       This  option modifies "RuntimeMaxSec" by increasing the maximum runtime by an evenly distributed duration
       between 0 and the specified value (in seconds). If "RuntimeMaxSec" is unspecified, then this feature will
       be disabled.   <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>WatchdogSec</b>
       Configures the watchdog timeout for a service.  The watchdog is activated when the start-up is completed.
       The service must call <b><a href="../man3/sd_notify.3.html">sd_notify</a></b>(3) regularly with "WATCHDOG=1" (i.e. the "keep-alive ping"). If the  time
       between  two  such calls is larger than the configured time, then the service is placed in a failed state
       and it will be terminated with "SIGABRT" (or  the  signal  specified  by  "WatchdogSignal").  By  setting
       "Restart"  to  "on-failure",  "on-watchdog", "on-abnormal" or "always", the service will be automatically
       restarted. The time configured here will be passed to the executed service process in the "WATCHDOG_USEC"
       environment variable. This allows daemons  to  automatically  enable  the  keep-alive  pinging  logic  if
       watchdog support is enabled for the service. If this option is used, "NotifyAccess" (see below) should be
       set  to open access to the notification socket provided by systemd. If "NotifyAccess" is not set, it will
       be implicitly set to "main".  Defaults to 0, which disables this feature. The service can  check  whether
       the  service  manager  expects watchdog keep-alive notifications. See <b><a href="../man3/sd_watchdog_enabled.3.html">sd_watchdog_enabled</a></b>(3) for details.
       <b><a href="../man3/sd_event_set_watchdog.3.html">sd_event_set_watchdog</a></b>(3) may be used to enable automatic watchdog notification support.   <u>Optional.</u>  <u>Type</u>
       <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>Restart</b>
       Configures whether the service shall be restarted when the service process exits, is killed, or a timeout
       is  reached. The service process may be the main service process, but it may also be one of the processes
       specified with "ExecStartPre", "ExecStartPost", "ExecStop", "ExecStopPost",  or  "ExecReload".  When  the
       death  of  the  process is a result of systemd operation (e.g. service stop or restart), the service will
       not be restarted. Timeouts include missing the watchdog "keep-alive ping" deadline and a  service  start,
       reload, and stop operation timeouts.

       Takes  one of "no", "on-success", "on-failure", "on-abnormal", "on-watchdog", "on-abort", or "always". If
       set to "no" (the default), the service will not be  restarted.   If  set  to  "on-success",  it  will  be
       restarted  only  when  the service process exits cleanly.  In this context, a clean exit means any of the
       following: exit code of 0;for types other than "Type=oneshot", one of  the  signals  "SIGHUP",  "SIGINT",
       "SIGTERM",  or  "SIGPIPE";  exit  statuses  and  signals  specified  in  "SuccessExitStatus".   If set to
       "on-failure", the service will be restarted when  the  process  exits  with  a  non-zero  exit  code,  is
       terminated  by  a signal (including on core dump, but excluding the aforementioned four signals), when an
       operation (such as service reload) times out, and when the configured watchdog timeout is  triggered.  If
       set to "on-abnormal", the service will be restarted when the process is terminated by a signal (including
       on  core  dump,  excluding  the  aforementioned  four  signals), when an operation times out, or when the
       watchdog timeout is triggered. If set to "on-abort", the service will be restarted only  if  the  service
       process  exits  due  to an uncaught signal not specified as a clean exit status. If set to "on-watchdog",
       the service will be restarted only if the watchdog timeout for the service expires. If set  to  "always",
       the  service  will be restarted regardless of whether it exited cleanly or not, got terminated abnormally
       by a signal, or hit a timeout. Note that "Type=oneshot" services will never be restarted on a clean  exit
       status, i.e. "always" and "on-success" are rejected for them.

       As  exceptions  to  the  setting  above,  the service will not be restarted if the exit code or signal is
       specified in "RestartPreventExitStatus" (see below) or the service is stopped with systemctl stop  or  an
       equivalent operation. Also, the services will always be restarted if the exit code or signal is specified
       in "RestartForceExitStatus" (see below).

       Note  that service restart is subject to unit start rate limiting configured with "StartLimitIntervalSec"
       and "StartLimitBurst", see <b><a href="../man5/systemd.unit.5.html">systemd.unit</a></b>(5) for details.

       Setting this to "on-failure" is the recommended choice for long-running services, in  order  to  increase
       reliability by attempting automatic recovery from errors. For services that shall be able to terminate on
       their  own  choice  (and  avoid immediate restarting), "on-abnormal" is an alternative choice.  <u>Optional.</u>
       <u>Type</u> <u>enum.</u> <u>choice:</u> <u>'always',</u> <u>'no',</u> <u>'on-abnormal',</u> <u>'on-abort',</u> <u>'on-failure',</u> <u>'on-success',</u> <u>'on-watchdog'.</u>

   <b>RestartMode</b>
       Takes a string value that specifies how a service should restart: If set to "normal" (the  default),  the
       service  restarts by going through a failed/inactive state.If set to "direct", the service transitions to
       the activating state directly during auto-restart, skipping  failed/inactive  state.   "ExecStopPost"  is
       still invoked.  "OnSuccess" and "OnFailure" are skipped.This option is useful in cases where a dependency
       can  fail  temporarily  but  we  don't  want  these  temporary failures to make the dependent units fail.
       Dependent units are not notified of these temporary failures.If set to "debug", the service manager  will
       log  messages  that are related to this unit at debug level while automated restarts are attempted, until
       either the service hits the rate limit or it succeeds, and the "$DEBUG_INVOCATION=1" environment variable
       will be set for the unit. This is useful to be able to get additional information when a service fails to
       start, without needing to proactively or permanently enable debug level logging in systemd, which is very
       verbose. This is otherwise equivalent to "normal" mode.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>SuccessExitStatus</b>
       Takes a list of exit status definitions that,  when  returned  by  the  main  service  process,  will  be
       considered  successful  termination,  in  addition to the normal successful exit status 0 and, except for
       "Type=oneshot", the signals "SIGHUP", "SIGINT", "SIGTERM", and "SIGPIPE". Exit status definitions can  be
       numeric termination statuses, termination status names, or termination signal names, separated by spaces.
       See  the  Process  Exit Codes section in <b><a href="../man5/systemd.exec.5.html">systemd.exec</a></b>(5) for a list of termination status names (for this
       setting only the part without the "EXIT_" or "EX_" prefix should be used). See <b><a href="../man7/signal.7.html">signal</a></b>(7) for  a  list  of
       signal names.

       Note  that  this  setting does not change the mapping between numeric exit statuses and their names, i.e.
       regardless how this setting is used 0 will still be mapped to "SUCCESS"  (and  thus  typically  shown  as
       "0/SUCCESS"  in tool outputs) and 1 to "FAILURE" (and thus typically shown as "1/FAILURE"), and so on. It
       only controls what happens as effect of these exit statuses, and how it propagates to the  state  of  the
       service as a whole.

       This  option  may appear more than once, in which case the list of successful exit statuses is merged. If
       the empty string is assigned to this option, the list is reset, all prior assignments of this option will
       have no effect.

       Note: systemd-analyze exit-status may be used to list  exit  statuses  and  translate  between  numerical
       status values and names.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>RestartPreventExitStatus</b>
       Takes  a  list  of  exit status definitions that, when returned by the main service process, will prevent
       automatic service restarts, regardless of the restart setting  configured  with  "Restart".  Exit  status
       definitions  can  be numeric termination statuses, termination status names, or termination signal names,
       separated by spaces. Defaults to the empty list, so that, by default, no exit status is excluded from the
       configured restart logic.  A service with the "RestartPreventExitStatus" setting
           RestartPreventExitStatus=TEMPFAIL 250 SIGKILL Exit status 75 ("TEMPFAIL"), 250, and  the  termination
       signal "SIGKILL" will not result in automatic service restarting.  This option may appear more than once,
       in which case the list of restart-preventing statuses is merged.  If the empty string is assigned to this
       option, the list is reset and all prior assignments of this option will have no effect.

       Note  that  this  setting  has  no  effect  on  processes configured via "ExecStartPre", "ExecStartPost",
       "ExecStop", "ExecStopPost" or "ExecReload", but only on the main service process,  i.e.  either  the  one
       invoked  by  "ExecStart"  or  (depending  on "Type", "PIDFile", …) the otherwise configured main process.
       <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>RestartForceExitStatus</b>
       Takes a list of exit status definitions that, when returned by  the  main  service  process,  will  force
       automatic  service  restarts,  regardless  of the restart setting configured with "Restart". The argument
       format is similar to "RestartPreventExitStatus".

       Note that for "Type=oneshot" services, a success exit status will prevent them from  auto-restarting,  no
       matter whether the corresponding exit statuses are listed in this option or not.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>RootDirectoryStartOnly</b>
       Takes a boolean argument. If true, the root directory, as configured with the "RootDirectory" option (see
       <b><a href="../man5/systemd.exec.5.html">systemd.exec</a></b>(5)  for  more information), is only applied to the process started with "ExecStart", and not
       to the various  other  "ExecStartPre",  "ExecStartPost",  "ExecReload",  "ExecStop",  and  "ExecStopPost"
       commands.  If  false, the setting is applied to all configured commands the same way.  Defaults to false.
       <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>boolean.</u>

   <b>NonBlocking</b>
       Set the "O_NONBLOCK" flag for all file descriptors passed via socket-based activation. If true, all  file
       descriptors  &gt;=  3  (i.e.  all  except  stdin,  stdout,  stderr),  excluding those passed in via the file
       descriptor storage logic (see "FileDescriptorStoreMax" for details), will have the "O_NONBLOCK" flag  set
       and  hence  are  in  non-blocking  mode. This option is only useful in conjunction with a socket unit, as
       described in <b><a href="../man5/systemd.socket.5.html">systemd.socket</a></b>(5) and has no effect on file descriptors which were previously saved  in  the
       file-descriptor store for example.  Defaults to false.

       Note that if the same socket unit is configured to be passed to multiple service units (via the "Sockets"
       setting, see below), and these services have different "NonBlocking" configurations, the precise state of
       "O_NONBLOCK"  depends  on  the  order in which these services are invoked, and will possibly change after
       service code already took possession of the socket file descriptor, simply because the "O_NONBLOCK" state
       of a socket is shared by all file descriptors referencing it. Hence it is  essential  that  all  services
       sharing  the  same socket use the same "NonBlocking" configuration, and do not change the flag in service
       code either.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>NotifyAccess</b>
       Controls access to the service status notification socket, as accessible via the <b><a href="../man3/sd_notify.3.html">sd_notify</a></b>(3) call. Takes
       one of "none" (the default), "main", "exec" or "all". If "none", no daemon status  updates  are  accepted
       from  the service processes, all status update messages are ignored. If "main", only service updates sent
       from the main process of the service are accepted. If "exec", only service updates sent from any  of  the
       main  or  control  processes  originating  from  one of the "Exec*=" commands are accepted. If "all", all
       services updates from all members of the service's control group are accepted. This option should be  set
       to  open access to the notification socket when using "Type=notify"/"Type=notify-reload" or "WatchdogSec"
       (see above). If those options are used but "NotifyAccess" is not configured, it will be implicitly set to
       "main".

       Note that <b>sd_notify()</b> notifications may be attributed to units  correctly  only  if  either  the  sending
       process  is still around at the time PID 1 processes the message, or if the sending process is explicitly
       runtime-tracked by the service manager. The latter is the case if the service manager  originally  forked
       off  the  process, i.e. on all processes that match "main" or "exec". Conversely, if an auxiliary process
       of the unit sends an <b>sd_notify()</b> message and immediately exits, the service manager might not be able  to
       properly  attribute the message to the unit, and thus will ignore it, even if "NotifyAccess"="all" is set
       for it.

       Hence, to eliminate all race conditions  involving  lookup  of  the  client's  unit  and  attribution  of
       notifications  to  units  correctly, <b>sd_notify_barrier()</b> may be used. This call acts as a synchronization
       point and ensures all notifications sent before this call have been picked up by the service manager when
       it returns successfully. Use of <b>sd_notify_barrier()</b> is needed for clients which are not  invoked  by  the
       service manager, otherwise this synchronization mechanism is unnecessary for attribution of notifications
       to the unit.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>enum.</u> <u>choice:</u> <u>'all',</u> <u>'exec',</u> <u>'main',</u> <u>'none'.</u>

   <b>Sockets</b>
       Specifies  the  name of the socket units this service shall inherit socket file descriptors from when the
       service is started. Normally, it should not be  necessary  to  use  this  setting,  as  all  socket  file
       descriptors  whose unit shares the same name as the service (subject to the different unit name suffix of
       course) are passed to the spawned process.

       Note that the same socket file descriptors may be passed to multiple processes simultaneously. Also  note
       that  a  different  service  may be activated on incoming socket traffic than the one which is ultimately
       configured to inherit the socket file descriptors. Or, in other words: the "Service" setting of ".socket"
       units does not have to match the inverse of the "Sockets" setting of the ".service" it refers to.

       This option may appear more than once, in which case the list of socket units is merged. Note  that  once
       set,  clearing  the  list of sockets again (for example, by assigning the empty string to this option) is
       not supported.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>FileDescriptorStoreMax</b>
       Configure how many file descriptors  may  be  stored  in  the  service  manager  for  the  service  using
       <b><a href="../man3/sd_pid_notify_with_fds.3.html">sd_pid_notify_with_fds</a></b>(3)'s  "FDSTORE=1"  messages.  This  is  useful  for implementing services that can
       restart after an explicit request or a crash without losing  state.  Any  open  sockets  and  other  file
       descriptors  which  should not be closed during the restart may be stored this way. Application state can
       either be serialized to a file  in  "RuntimeDirectory",  or  stored  in  a  <b><a href="../man2/memfd_create.2.html">memfd_create</a></b>(2)  memory  file
       descriptor.  Defaults  to  0,  i.e.  no  file  descriptors may be stored in the service manager. All file
       descriptors passed to the service manager from a specific service are passed back to the  service's  main
       process on the next service restart (see <b><a href="../man3/sd_listen_fds.3.html">sd_listen_fds</a></b>(3) for details about the precise protocol used and
       the  order  in which the file descriptors are passed). Any file descriptors passed to the service manager
       are automatically closed when "POLLHUP" or "POLLERR" is seen on  them,  or  when  the  service  is  fully
       stopped   and   no   job   is  queued  or  being  executed  for  it  (the  latter  can  be  tweaked  with
       "FileDescriptorStorePreserve", see below). If this option is used, "NotifyAccess" (see above)  should  be
       set  to open access to the notification socket provided by systemd. If "NotifyAccess" is not set, it will
       be implicitly set to "main".

       The fdstore command of <b><a href="../man1/systemd-analyze.1.html">systemd-analyze</a></b>(1) may be used to list the current contents of  a  service's  file
       descriptor store.

       Note  that  the service manager will only pass file descriptors contained in the file descriptor store to
       the service's own processes, never  to  other  clients  via  IPC  or  similar.  However,  it  does  allow
       unprivileged  clients  to  query the list of currently open file descriptors of a service. Sensitive data
       may hence be safely placed inside the referenced files, but should not be attached to the metadata  (e.g.
       included in filenames) of the stored file descriptors.

       If  this  option  is  set to a non-zero value the $FDSTORE environment variable will be set for processes
       invoked for this service. See <b><a href="../man5/systemd.exec.5.html">systemd.exec</a></b>(5) for details.

       For  further   information   on   the   file   descriptor   store   see   the   File   Descriptor   Store
       &lt;https://systemd.io/FILE_DESCRIPTOR_STORE&gt; overview.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>FileDescriptorStorePreserve</b>
       Takes  one  of  "no",  "yes",  "restart" and controls when to release the service's file descriptor store
       (i.e. when to close the contained file descriptors, if any). If set to "no" the file descriptor store  is
       automatically  released when the service is stopped; if "restart" (the default) it is kept around as long
       as the unit is neither inactive nor failed, or a job is  queued  for  the  service,  or  the  service  is
       expected  to  be  restarted.  If "yes" the file descriptor store is kept around until the unit is removed
       from memory (i.e. is not referenced anymore and inactive). The latter is useful to keep  entries  in  the
       file descriptor store pinned until the service manager exits.

       Use  systemctl  clean  --what=fdstore  … to release the file descriptor store explicitly.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u>
       <u>enum.</u> <u>choice:</u> <u>'no',</u> <u>'restart',</u> <u>'yes'.</u>

   <b>USBFunctionDescriptors</b>
       Configure the location of a file containing USB FunctionFS  &lt;https://docs.kernel.org/usb/functionfs.html&gt;
       descriptors,  for  implementation of USB gadget functions. This is used only in conjunction with a socket
       unit with "ListenUSBFunction" configured. The contents of this file are written to the "ep0"  file  after
       it is opened.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>USBFunctionStrings</b>
       Configure   the  location  of  a  file  containing  USB  FunctionFS  strings.   Behavior  is  similar  to
       "USBFunctionDescriptors" above.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>OOMPolicy</b>
       Configure  the  out-of-memory  (OOM)  killing  policy  for  the  kernel  and  the  userspace  OOM  killer
       <b><a href="../man8/systemd-oomd.service.8.html">systemd-oomd.service</a></b>(8).   On  Linux, when memory becomes scarce to the point that the kernel has trouble
       allocating memory for itself, it might decide to kill a running process in order to free  up  memory  and
       reduce memory pressure. Note that "systemd-oomd.service" is a more flexible solution that aims to prevent
       out-of-memory  situations for the userspace too, not just the kernel, by attempting to terminate services
       earlier, before the kernel would have to act.

       This setting takes one of "continue", "stop" or "kill". If set to "continue" and a process in the unit is
       killed by the OOM killer, this is logged but the unit continues running. If set to "stop"  the  event  is
       logged  but the unit is terminated cleanly by the service manager. If set to "kill" and one of the unit's
       processes is killed by the OOM killer the kernel is instructed to kill all  remaining  processes  of  the
       unit  too,  by  setting  the  "memory.oom.group"  attribute  to  1; also see kernel page Control Group v2
       &lt;https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/cgroup-v2.html&gt;.

       Defaults to the setting "DefaultOOMPolicy" in <b><a href="../man5/systemd-system.conf.5.html">systemd-system.conf</a></b>(5) is set to, except  for  units  where
       "Delegate" is turned on, where it defaults to "continue".

       Use the "OOMScoreAdjust" setting to configure whether processes of the unit shall be considered preferred
       or  less  preferred candidates for process termination by the Linux OOM killer logic. See <b><a href="../man5/systemd.exec.5.html">systemd.exec</a></b>(5)
       for details.

       This setting also applies to <b><a href="../man8/systemd-oomd.service.8.html">systemd-oomd.service</a></b>(8).  Similarly to the kernel OOM kills performed by the
       kernel, this setting determines the state of the unit after systemd-oomd kills a cgroup  associated  with
       it.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>OpenFile</b>
       Takes  an  argument of the form "path:fd-name:options", where: "path" is a path to a file or an "AF_UNIX"
       socket in the file system;"fd-name" is a name that will be associated with the file descriptor; the  name
       may  contain  any  ASCII  character, but must exclude control characters and ":", and must be at most 255
       characters in length; it is optional and, if not provided, defaults  to  the  file  name;"options"  is  a
       comma-separated   list  of  access  options;  possible  values  are  "read-only",  "append",  "truncate",
       "graceful"; if not specified, files will be opened in "rw"  mode;  if  "graceful"  is  specified,  errors
       during file/socket opening are ignored.  Specifying the same option several times is treated as an error.
       The file or socket is opened by the service manager and the file descriptor is passed to the service.  If
       the  path is a socket, we call <b>connect()</b> on it.  See <b><a href="../man3/sd_listen_fds.3.html">sd_listen_fds</a></b>(3) for more details on how to retrieve
       these file descriptors.

       This setting is useful to allow services to access files/sockets that they can't access  themselves  (due
       to running in a separate mount namespace, not having privileges, ...).

       This  setting  can  be specified multiple times, in which case all the specified paths are opened and the
       file descriptors passed to the service.  If the empty string is assigned, the entire list of  open  files
       defined prior to this is reset.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>ReloadSignal</b>
       Configures  the  UNIX  process  signal  to  send  to  the service's main process when asked to reload the
       service's configuration. Defaults to "SIGHUP". This option has no effect unless "Type"="notify-reload" is
       used, see above.  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>FailureAction</b>
       <b>Deprecated</b>  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>SuccessAction</b>
       <b>Deprecated</b>  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>StartLimitBurst</b>
       <b>Deprecated</b>  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>StartLimitInterval</b>
       <b>Deprecated</b>  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>

   <b>RebootArgument</b>
       <b>Deprecated</b>  <u>Optional.</u> <u>Type</u> <u>uniline.</u>
