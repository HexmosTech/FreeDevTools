</pre><h4><b>Detailed</b> <b>Description</b></h4><pre>
       Several functions can optionally be called between <b>hwloc_topology_init()</b> and <b>hwloc_topology_load()</b> to
       configure how the detection should be performed, e.g. to ignore some objects types, define a synthetic
       topology, etc.

</pre><h4><b>Enumeration</b> <b>Type</b> <b>Documentation</b></h4><pre>
   <b>enum</b> <b>hwloc_topology_flags_e</b>
       Flags to be set onto a topology context before load. Flags should be given to <b>hwloc_topology_set_flags()</b>.
       They may also be returned by <b>hwloc_topology_get_flags()</b>.

       <b>Enumerator</b>

       <u>HWLOC_TOPOLOGY_FLAG_INCLUDE_DISALLOWED</u>
              Detect  the  whole  system,  ignore  reservations,  include  disallowed objects. Gather all online
              resources,  even  if  some  were  disabled  by  the  administrator.  For  instance,  ignore  Linux
              Cgroup/Cpusets  and gather all processors and memory nodes. However offline PUs and NUMA nodes are
              still ignored.

       When this flag is not set, PUs and NUMA nodes that are disallowed are not added to the  topology.  Parent
       objects  (package,  core, cache, etc.) are added only if some of their children are allowed. All existing
       PUs  and  NUMA   nodes   in   the   topology   are   allowed.   <b>hwloc_topology_get_allowed_cpuset()</b>   and
       <b>hwloc_topology_get_allowed_nodeset()</b> are equal to the root object cpuset and nodeset.

       When   this   flag   is   set,   the   actual   sets   of  allowed  PUs  and  NUMA  nodes  are  given  by
       <b>hwloc_topology_get_allowed_cpuset()</b> and <b>hwloc_topology_get_allowed_nodeset()</b>. They may  be  smaller  than
       the root object cpuset and nodeset.

       If  the  current  topology  is exported to XML and reimported later, this flag should be set again in the
       reimported topology so that disallowed resources are reimported as well.

       <u>HWLOC_TOPOLOGY_FLAG_IS_THISSYSTEM</u>
              Assume that the selected backend provides the topology for the system on  which  we  are  running.
              This  forces <b>hwloc_topology_is_thissystem()</b> to return 1, i.e. makes hwloc assume that the selected
              backend provides the topology for the system on which we are running, even if it is  not  the  OS-
              specific  backend  but  the  XML  backend  for  instance.  This means making the binding functions
              actually call the OS-specific system calls and really do binding,  while  the  XML  backend  would
              otherwise provide empty hooks just returning success.

       Setting the environment variable HWLOC_THISSYSTEM may also result in the same behavior.

       This  can  be  used for efficiency reasons to first detect the topology once, save it to an XML file, and
       quickly reload it later through the XML backend, but still having binding functions actually do bind.

       <u>HWLOC_TOPOLOGY_FLAG_THISSYSTEM_ALLOWED_RESOURCES</u>
              Get the set of allowed resources from the local operating system even if the topology  was  loaded
              from XML or synthetic description. If the topology was loaded from XML or from a synthetic string,
              restrict it by applying the current process restrictions such as Linux Cgroup/Cpuset.

       This  is  useful  when  the  topology is not loaded directly from the local machine (e.g. for performance
       reason) and it comes with all resources, while the running process is restricted to  only  parts  of  the
       machine.

       This  flag is ignored unless <b>HWLOC_TOPOLOGY_FLAG_IS_THISSYSTEM</b> is also set since the loaded topology must
       match the underlying machine where restrictions will be gathered from.

       Setting the environment variable HWLOC_THISSYSTEM_ALLOWED_RESOURCES would result in the same behavior.

       <u>HWLOC_TOPOLOGY_FLAG_IMPORT_SUPPORT</u>
              Import support from the imported topology. When importing a XML topology from  a  remote  machine,
              binding  is  disabled  by  default (see <b>HWLOC_TOPOLOGY_FLAG_IS_THISSYSTEM</b>). This disabling is also
              marked  by  putting  zeroes  in   the   corresponding   supported   feature   bits   reported   by
              <b>hwloc_topology_get_support()</b>.

       The  flag  <b>HWLOC_TOPOLOGY_FLAG_IMPORT_SUPPORT</b>  actually  imports support bits from the remote machine. It
       also sets the flag imported_support in the struct <b>hwloc_topology_misc_support</b> array. If the imported  XML
       did not contain any support information (exporter hwloc is too old), this flag is not set.

       Note  that  these  supported features are only relevant for the hwloc installation that actually exported
       the XML topology (it may vary with the operating system, or with how hwloc was compiled).

       Note that setting this flag however does not enable binding for the locally imported hwloc  topology,  it
       only reports what the remote hwloc and machine support.

       <u>HWLOC_TOPOLOGY_FLAG_RESTRICT_TO_CPUBINDING</u>
              Do  not  consider  resources  outside of the process CPU binding. If the binding of the process is
              limited to a subset of cores, ignore the other cores during discovery.

       The resulting topology is identical to what a call to <b>hwloc_topology_restrict()</b> would generate, but  this
       flag also prevents hwloc from ever touching other resources during the discovery.

       This  flag  especially  tells  the x86 backend to never temporarily rebind a thread on any excluded core.
       This is useful on Windows because such temporary rebinding can change the process binding.  Another  use-
       case  is  to  avoid cores that would not be able to perform the hwloc discovery anytime soon because they
       are busy executing some high-priority real-time tasks.

       If process CPU binding is not supported, the thread CPU binding is considered instead  if  supported,  or
       the flag is ignored.

       This flag requires <b>HWLOC_TOPOLOGY_FLAG_IS_THISSYSTEM</b> as well since binding support is required.

       <u>HWLOC_TOPOLOGY_FLAG_RESTRICT_TO_MEMBINDING</u>
              Do  not consider resources outside of the process memory binding. If the binding of the process is
              limited to a subset of NUMA nodes, ignore the other NUMA nodes during discovery.

       The resulting topology is identical to what a call to <b>hwloc_topology_restrict()</b> would generate, but  this
       flag also prevents hwloc from ever touching other resources during the discovery.

       This  flag  is  meant to be used together with <b>HWLOC_TOPOLOGY_FLAG_RESTRICT_TO_CPUBINDING</b> when both cores
       and NUMA nodes should be ignored outside of the process binding.

       If process memory binding is not supported, the thread memory binding is considered instead if supported,
       or the flag is ignored.

       This flag requires <b>HWLOC_TOPOLOGY_FLAG_IS_THISSYSTEM</b> as well since binding support is required.

       <u>HWLOC_TOPOLOGY_FLAG_DONT_CHANGE_BINDING</u>
              Do not ever modify the process or thread binding during discovery. This flag  disables  all  hwloc
              discovery  steps  that  require  a  change  of  the process or thread binding. This currently only
              affects the x86 backend which gets entirely disabled.

       This is useful when <b>hwloc_topology_load()</b> is called while the application also creates additional threads
       or modifies the binding.

       This flag is also a strict way to make sure the process binding will not change  to  due  thread  binding
       changes on Windows (see <b>HWLOC_TOPOLOGY_FLAG_RESTRICT_TO_CPUBINDING</b>).

       <u>HWLOC_TOPOLOGY_FLAG_NO_DISTANCES</u>
              Ignore  distances. Ignore distance information from the operating systems (and from XML) and hence
              do not use distances for grouping.

       <u>HWLOC_TOPOLOGY_FLAG_NO_MEMATTRS</u>
              Ignore memory attributes and tiers. Ignore memory attribues from the operating systems  (and  from
              XML) Hence also do not try to build memory tiers.

       <u>HWLOC_TOPOLOGY_FLAG_NO_CPUKINDS</u>
              Ignore CPU Kinds. Ignore CPU kind information from the operating systems (and from XML).

   <b>enum</b> <b>hwloc_type_filter_e</b>
       Type filtering flags. By default, most objects are kept (<b>HWLOC_TYPE_FILTER_KEEP_ALL</b>). Instruction caches,
       memory-side  caches,  I/O  and  Misc  objects are ignored by default (<b>HWLOC_TYPE_FILTER_KEEP_NONE</b>). Group
       levels are ignored unless they bring structure (<b>HWLOC_TYPE_FILTER_KEEP_STRUCTURE</b>).

       Note that group objects are also ignored individually (without the entire level) when they do  not  bring
       structure.

       <b>Enumerator</b>

       <u>HWLOC_TYPE_FILTER_KEEP_ALL</u>
              Keep  all objects of this type. Cannot be set for <b>HWLOC_OBJ_GROUP</b> (groups are designed only to add
              more structure to the topology).

       <u>HWLOC_TYPE_FILTER_KEEP_NONE</u>
              Ignore all objects of this type. The bottom-level type <b>HWLOC_OBJ_PU</b>, the <b>HWLOC_OBJ_NUMANODE</b>  type,
              and the top-level type <b>HWLOC_OBJ_MACHINE</b> may not be ignored.

       <u>HWLOC_TYPE_FILTER_KEEP_STRUCTURE</u>
              Only  ignore  objects if their entire level does not bring any structure. Keep the entire level of
              objects if at least one of these  objects  adds  structure  to  the  topology.  An  object  brings
              structure when it has multiple children and it is not the only child of its parent.

       If  all  objects  in  the  level  are  the  only  child of their parent, and if none of them has multiple
       children, the entire level is removed.

       Cannot be set for I/O and Misc objects since the topology structure does not matter there.

       <u>HWLOC_TYPE_FILTER_KEEP_IMPORTANT</u>
              Only keep likely-important objects of the given type. It is only useful for I/O object types.  For
              <b>HWLOC_OBJ_PCI_DEVICE</b> and <b>HWLOC_OBJ_OS_DEVICE</b>, it means that only objects of major/common kinds are
              kept  (storage,  network,  OpenFabrics,  CUDA,  OpenCL,  RSMI,  NVML, and displays). Also, only OS
              devices directly attached on PCI (e.g. no USB) are reported. For <b>HWLOC_OBJ_BRIDGE</b>, it  means  that
              bridges are kept only if they have children.

       This  flag  equivalent  to  <b>HWLOC_TYPE_FILTER_KEEP_ALL</b>  for  Normal, Memory and Misc types since they are
       likely important.

</pre><h4><b>Function</b> <b>Documentation</b></h4><pre>
   <b>unsigned</b> <b>long</b> <b>hwloc_topology_get_flags</b> <b>(hwloc_topology_t</b> <b>topology)</b>
       Get OR'ed flags of a topology. Get the OR'ed set of <b>hwloc_topology_flags_e</b> of a topology.

       If <b>hwloc_topology_set_flags()</b> was not called earlier, no flags are set (0 is returned).

       <b>Returns</b>
           the flags previously set with <b>hwloc_topology_set_flags()</b>.

       <b>Note</b>
           This function may also be called after <b>hwloc_topology_load()</b>.

   <b>const</b> <b>struct</b> <b>hwloc_topology_support</b> <b>*</b> <b>hwloc_topology_get_support</b> <b>(hwloc_topology_t</b> <b>restrict</b> <b>topology)</b>
       Retrieve the topology support. Each flag indicates whether a feature is  supported.  If  set  to  0,  the
       feature  is  not  supported.  If set to 1, the feature is supported, but the corresponding call may still
       fail in some corner cases.

       These features are also listed by hwloc-info --support

       The reported features are what the current topology supports on the current machine. If the topology  was
       exported  to  XML from another machine and later imported here, support still describes what is supported
       for this imported topology after import. By default, binding will be reported as unsupported in this case
       (see <b>HWLOC_TOPOLOGY_FLAG_IS_THISSYSTEM</b>).

       Topology flag <b>HWLOC_TOPOLOGY_FLAG_IMPORT_SUPPORT</b> may be used to report  the  supported  features  of  the
       original  remote  machine  instead.  If it was successfully imported, imported_support will be set in the
       struct <b>hwloc_topology_misc_support</b> array.

       <b>Returns</b>
           A pointer to a support structure.

       <b>Note</b>
           The function cannot return NULL.

           The returned pointer should not be freed, it belongs to the hwloc library.

           This function may be called before or after <b>hwloc_topology_load()</b>  but  the  support  structure  only
           contains valid information after.

   <b>int</b>     <b>hwloc_topology_get_type_filter</b>    <b>(hwloc_topology_t</b>    <b>topology,</b>    <b>hwloc_obj_type_t</b>    <b>type,</b>    <b>enum</b>
       <b>hwloc_type_filter_e</b> <b>*</b> <b>filter)</b>
       Get the current filtering for the given object type.

       <b>Returns</b>
           0 on success, -1 on error.

   <b>void</b> <b>*</b> <b>hwloc_topology_get_userdata</b> <b>(hwloc_topology_t</b> <b>topology)</b>
       Retrieve the topology-specific userdata pointer. Retrieve the application-given private data pointer that
       was previously set with <b>hwloc_topology_set_userdata()</b>.

       <b>Returns</b>
           A pointer to the private-data if any.

           NULL if no private-data was previoulsy set.

   <b>int</b> <b>hwloc_topology_is_thissystem</b> <b>(hwloc_topology_t</b> <b>restrict</b> <b>topology)</b>
       Does the topology context come from this system?

       <b>Returns</b>
           1 if this topology context was built using the system running this program.

           0 instead (for instance if using another file-system root,  a  XML  topology  file,  or  a  synthetic
           topology).

       <b>Note</b>
           This function may also be called after <b>hwloc_topology_load()</b>.

   <b>int</b> <b>hwloc_topology_set_all_types_filter</b> <b>(hwloc_topology_t</b> <b>topology,</b> <b>enum</b> <b>hwloc_type_filter_e</b> <b>filter)</b>
       Set  the  filtering  for all object types. If some types do not support this filtering, they are silently
       ignored.

       <b>Returns</b>
           0 on success, -1 on error.

   <b>int</b> <b>hwloc_topology_set_cache_types_filter</b> <b>(hwloc_topology_t</b> <b>topology,</b> <b>enum</b> <b>hwloc_type_filter_e</b> <b>filter)</b>
       Set the filtering for all CPU cache object types. Memory-side caches are not involved since they are  not
       CPU caches.

       <b>Returns</b>
           0 on success, -1 on error.

   <b>int</b> <b>hwloc_topology_set_flags</b> <b>(hwloc_topology_t</b> <b>topology,</b> <b>unsigned</b> <b>long</b> <b>flags)</b>
       Set  OR'ed  flags  to  non-yet-loaded topology. Set a OR'ed set of <b>hwloc_topology_flags_e</b> onto a topology
       that was not yet loaded.

       If this function is called multiple times, the last invocation will erase and replace the  set  of  flags
       that was previously set.

       By default, no flags are set (0).

       The flags set in a topology may be retrieved with <b>hwloc_topology_get_flags()</b>.

       <b>Returns</b>
           0 on success.

           -1 on error, for instance if flags are invalid.

   <b>int</b> <b>hwloc_topology_set_icache_types_filter</b> <b>(hwloc_topology_t</b> <b>topology,</b> <b>enum</b> <b>hwloc_type_filter_e</b> <b>filter)</b>
       Set  the  filtering for all CPU instruction cache object types. Memory-side caches are not involved since
       they are not CPU caches.

       <b>Returns</b>
           0 on success, -1 on error.

   <b>int</b> <b>hwloc_topology_set_io_types_filter</b> <b>(hwloc_topology_t</b> <b>topology,</b> <b>enum</b> <b>hwloc_type_filter_e</b> <b>filter)</b>
       Set the filtering for all I/O object types.

       <b>Returns</b>
           0 on success, -1 on error.

   <b>int</b>    <b>hwloc_topology_set_type_filter</b>    <b>(hwloc_topology_t</b>    <b>topology,</b>    <b>hwloc_obj_type_t</b>    <b>type,</b>     <b>enum</b>
       <b>hwloc_type_filter_e</b> <b>filter)</b>
       Set the filtering for the given object type.

       <b>Returns</b>
           0 on success, -1 on error.

   <b>void</b> <b>hwloc_topology_set_userdata</b> <b>(hwloc_topology_t</b> <b>topology,</b> <b>const</b> <b>void</b> <b>*</b> <b>userdata)</b>
       Set  the  topology-specific  userdata pointer. Each topology may store one application-given private data
       pointer. It is initialized to NULL. hwloc will never modify it.

       Use it as you wish, after <b>hwloc_topology_init()</b> and until hwloc_topolog_destroy().

       This pointer is not exported to XML.
