</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Config::IniFiles - A module for reading .ini-style configuration files.

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 3.000003

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Config::IniFiles;
         my $cfg = Config::IniFiles-&gt;new( -file =&gt; "/path/configfile.ini" );
         print "The value is " . $cfg-&gt;val( 'Section', 'Parameter' ) . "."
           if $cfg-&gt;val( 'Section', 'Parameter' );

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Config::IniFiles provides a way to have readable configuration files outside your Perl script.
       Configurations can be imported (inherited, stacked,...), sections can be grouped, and settings can be
       accessed from a tied hash.

</pre><h4><b>FILE</b> <b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
       INI files consist of a number of sections, each preceded with the section name in square brackets,
       followed by parameter names and their values.

         [a section]
         Parameter=Value

         [section 2]
         AnotherParameter=Some value
         Setting=Something else
         Parameter=Different scope than the one in the first section

       The first non-blank character of the line indicating a section must be a left bracket and the last non-
       blank character of a line indicating a section must be a right bracket. The characters making up the
       section name can be any symbols at all. However section names must be unique.

       Parameters are specified in each section as Name=Value.  Any spaces around the equals sign will be
       ignored, and the value extends to the end of the line (including any whitespace at the end of the line.
       Parameter names are localized to the namespace of the section, but must be unique within a section.

       Both the hash mark (#) and the semicolon (;) are comment characters.  by default (this can be changed by
       configuration). Lines that begin with either of these characters will be ignored. Any amount of
       whitespace may precede the comment character.

       Multi-line or multi-valued parameters may also be defined ala UNIX "here document" syntax:

         Parameter=&lt;&lt;EOT
         value/line 1
         value/line 2
         EOT

       You may use any string you want in place of "EOT". Note that whatever follows the "&lt;&lt;" and what appears
       at the end of the text MUST match exactly, including any trailing whitespace.

       Alternately, as a configuration option (default is off), continuation lines can be allowed:

         [Section]
         Parameter=this parameter \
           spreads across \
           a few lines

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b> <b>--</b> <b>Object</b> <b>Interface</b></h4><pre>
       Get a new Config::IniFiles object with the <u>new</u> method:

         $cfg = Config::IniFiles-&gt;new( -file =&gt; "/path/config_file.ini" );
         $cfg = new Config::IniFiles -file =&gt; "/path/config_file.ini";

       Optional named parameters may be specified after the configuration file name. See the <u>new</u> in the <b>METHODS</b>
       section, below.

       Values from the config file are fetched with the val method:

         $value = $cfg-&gt;val('Section', 'Parameter');

       If you want a multi-line/value field returned as an array, just specify an array as the receiver:

         @values = $cfg-&gt;val('Section', 'Parameter');

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>new</b> <b>(</b> <b>[-option=&gt;value</b> <b>...]</b> <b>)</b>
       Returns a new configuration object (or "undef" if the configuration file has an error, in which case
       check the global @Config::IniFiles::errors array for reasons why). One Config::IniFiles object is
       required per configuration file. The following named parameters are available:

       <u>-file</u>  filename
                 Specifies  a file to load the parameters from. This 'file' may actually be any of the following
                 things:

                   1) the pathname of a file

                     $cfg = Config::IniFiles-&gt;new( -file =&gt; "/path/to/config_file.ini" );

                   2) a simple filehandle

                     $cfg = Config::IniFiles-&gt;new( -file =&gt; STDIN );

                   3) a filehandle glob

                     open( CONFIG, "/path/to/config_file.ini" );
                     $cfg = Config::IniFiles-&gt;new( -file =&gt; *CONFIG );

                   4) a reference to a glob

                     open( CONFIG, "/path/to/config_file.ini" );
                     $cfg = Config::IniFiles-&gt;new( -file =&gt; \*CONFIG );

                   5) an IO::File object

                     $io = IO::File-&gt;new( "/path/to/config_file.ini" );
                     $cfg = Config::IniFiles-&gt;new( -file =&gt; $io );

                   or

                     open my $fh, '&lt;', "/path/to/config_file.ini" or die $!;
                     $cfg = Config::IniFiles-&gt;new( -file =&gt; $fh );

                   6) A reference to a scalar (requires newer versions of IO::Scalar)

                     $ini_file_contents = &lt;&lt;EOT
                     [section name]
                     Parameter=A value
                     Setting=Another value
                     EOT

                     $cfg = Config::IniFiles-&gt;new( -file =&gt; \$ini_file_contents );

                 If this option is not specified, (i.e. you are creating a config file from  scratch)  you  must
                 specify a target file using SetFileName in order to save the parameters.

       <u>-default</u> section
                 Specifies  a section to be used for default values. For example, in the following configuration
                 file, if you look up the "permissions" parameter in the "joe" section, there is none.

                    [all]
                    permissions=Nothing

                    [jane]
                    name=Jane
                    permissions=Open files

                    [joe]
                    name=Joseph

                 If you create your Config::IniFiles object with a default section of "all" like this:

                    $cfg = Config::IniFiles-&gt;new( -file =&gt; "file.ini", -default =&gt; "all" );

                 Then requesting a value for a "permissions" in the [joe] section will check for  a  value  from
                 [all] before returning undef.

                    $permissions = $cfg-&gt;val( "joe", "permissions");   // returns "Nothing"

       <u>-fallback</u> section
                 Specifies  a  section  to  be  used for parameters outside a section. Default is none.  Without
                 -fallback specified (which is the default), reading a configuration file which has a  parameter
                 outside a section will fail. With this set to, say, "GENERAL", this configuration:

                    wrong=wronger

                    [joe]
                    name=Joseph

                 will be assumed as:

                    [GENERAL]
                    wrong=wronger

                    [joe]
                    name=Joseph

                 Note  that  Config::IniFiles  will  also  omit the fallback section header when outputting such
                 configuration.

       <u>-nocase</u> 0|1
                 Set -nocase =&gt; 1 to handle the config file in a case-insensitive  manner  (case  in  values  is
                 preserved, however).  By default, config files are case-sensitive (i.e., a section named 'Test'
                 is  not  the same as a section named 'test').  Note that there is an added overhead for turning
                 off case sensitivity.

       <u>-import</u> object
                 This allows you to import or inherit existing setting  from  another  Config::IniFiles  object.
                 When  importing  settings  from  another object, sections with the same name will be merged and
                 parameters that are defined in both the imported object and the <u>-file</u> will take  the  value  of
                 given in the <u>-file</u>.

                 If  a <u>-default</u> section is also given on this call, and it does not coincide with the default of
                 the imported object, the new default section will be used instead. If no  <u>-default</u>  section  is
                 given, then the default of the imported object will be used.

       <u>-allowcontinue</u> 0|1
                 Set  -allowcontinue  =&gt; 1 to enable continuation lines in the config file.  i.e. if a line ends
                 with a backslash "\", then the following line is appended to the parameter value, dropping  the
                 backslash and the newline character(s).

                 Default  behavior  is  to  keep  a  trailing  backslash  "\"  as  a  parameter value. Note that
                 continuation cannot be mixed with the "here" value syntax.

       <u>-allowempty</u> 0|1
                 If set to 1, then empty files are allowed at ReadConfig time. If set to  0  (the  default),  an
                 empty configuration file is considered an error.

       <u>-negativedeltas</u> 0|1
                 If set to 1 (the default if importing this object from another one), parses and honors lines of
                 the following form in the configuration file:

                   ; [somesection] is deleted

                 or

                   [inthissection]
                   ; thisparameter is deleted

                 If set to 0 (the default if not importing), these comments are treated like ordinary ones.

                 The  WriteConfig1)&gt;  form will output such comments to indicate deleted sections or parameters.
                 This way, reloading a delta file using the same imported object produces the  same  results  in
                 memory again. See " DELTA FEATURES" in IMPORT  for more details.

       <u>-commentchar</u> 'char'
                 The  default comment character is "#". You may change this by specifying this option to another
                 character. This can be any character except alphanumeric characters,  square  brackets  or  the
                 "equal" sign.

       <u>-allowedcommentchars</u> 'chars'
                 Allowed  default  comment  characters are "#" and ";". By specifying this option you may change
                 the range of characters that are used to denote a comment line to include any set of characters

                 Note: that the character specified by <b>-commentchar</b> (see above) is <u>always</u> part  of  the  allowed
                 comment characters.

                 Note  2:  The given string is evaluated as a regular expression character class, so '\' must be
                 escaped if you wish to use it.

       <u>-reloadwarn</u> 0|1
                 Set -reloadwarn =&gt; 1 to enable a warning message (output to STDERR) whenever the config file is
                 reloaded.  The reload message is of the form:

                   PID &lt;PID&gt; reloading config file &lt;file&gt; at YYYY.MM.DD HH:MM:SS

                 Default behavior is to not warn (i.e. -reloadwarn =&gt; 0).

                 This is generally only useful when using Config::IniFiles in a server  or  daemon  application.
                 The application is still responsible for determining when the object is to be reloaded.

       <u>-nomultiline</u> 0|1
                 Set -nomultiline =&gt; 1 to output multi-valued parameter as:

                  param=value1
                  param=value2

                 instead of the default:

                  param=&lt;&lt;EOT
                  value1
                  value2
                  EOT

                 As the latter might not be compatible with all applications.

       <u>-handle_trailing_comment</u> 0|1
                 Set -handle_trailing_comment =&gt; 1 to enable support of parameter trailing comments.

                 For example, if we have a parameter line like this:

                  param1=value1;comment1

                 by  default,  handle_trailing_comment  will be set to <b>0</b>, and we will get <u>value1;comment1</u> as the
                 value of <u>param1</u>. If we have -handle_trailing_comment set to <b>1</b>, then we will get <u>value1</u>  as  the
                 value for <u>param1</u>, and <u>comment1</u> as the trailing comment of <u>param1</u>.

                 Set  and  get  methods  for trailing comments are provided as "SetParameterTrailingComment" and
                 "GetParameterTrailingComment".

       <u>-php_compat</u> 0|1
                 Set -php_compat =&gt; 1 to enable support for PHP like configfiles.

                 The differences between parse_ini_file and Config::IniFiles are:

                  # parse_ini_file
                  [group]
                  val1="value"
                  val2[]=1
                  val2[]=2

                  vs

                  # Config::IniFiles
                  [group]
                  val1=value
                  val2=1
                  val2=2

                 This option only affect parsing, not writing new configfiles.

                 Some features from parse_ini_file are not compatible:

                  [group]
                  val1="val"'ue'
                  val1[key]=1

   <b>val</b> <b>($section,</b> <b>$parameter</b> <b>[,</b> <b>$default]</b> <b>)</b>
       Returns the value of the specified parameter ($parameter) in section $section, returns undef (or $default
       if specified) if no section or no parameter for the given section exists.

       If you want a multi-line/value field returned as an array, just specify an array as the receiver:

         @values = $cfg-&gt;val('Section', 'Parameter');

       A multi-line/value field that is returned in a scalar context will  be  joined  using  $/  (input  record
       separator, default is \n) if defined, otherwise the values will be joined using \n.

   <b>exists($section,</b> <b>$parameter)</b>
       True  if  and  only  if there exists a section $section, with a parameter $parameter inside, not counting
       default values.

   <b>push</b> <b>($section,</b> <b>$parameter,</b> <b>$value,</b> <b>[</b> <b>$value2,</b> <b>...])</b>
       Pushes new values at the end of existing value(s) of parameter $parameter in section $section.  See below
       for methods to write the new configuration back out to a file.

       You may not set a parameter that didn't exist in the original configuration file.  <b>push</b> will return <u>undef</u>
       if this is attempted. See <b>newval</b> below to do this. Otherwise, it returns 1.

   <b>setval</b> <b>($section,</b> <b>$parameter,</b> <b>$value,</b> <b>[</b> <b>$value2,</b> <b>...</b> <b>])</b>
       Sets the value of parameter $parameter in section $section to $value (or to a set of values).  See  below
       for methods to write the new configuration back out to a file.

       You  may  not  set  a parameter that didn't exist in the original configuration file.  <b>setval</b> will return
       <u>undef</u> if this is attempted. See <b>newval</b> below to do this. Otherwise, it returns 1.

   <b>newval($section,</b> <b>$parameter,</b> <b>$value</b> <b>[,</b> <b>$value2,</b> <b>...])</b>
       Assigns a new value, $value (or set of values) to the parameter $parameter in  section  $section  in  the
       configuration file.

   <b>delval($section,</b> <b>$parameter)</b>
       Deletes the specified parameter from the configuration file

   <b>ReadConfig</b>
       Forces the configuration file to be re-read. Returns undef if the file can not be opened, no filename was
       defined (with the "-file" option) when the object was constructed, or an error occurred while reading.

       If  an  error occurs while parsing the INI file the @Config::IniFiles::errors array will contain messages
       that might help you figure out where the problem is in the file.

   <b>Sections</b>
       Returns an array containing section names in the configuration file.  If the <u>nocase</u> option was turned  on
       when the config object was created, the section names will be returned in lowercase.

   <b>SectionExists</b> <b>(</b> <b>$sect_name</b> <b>)</b>
       Returns  1 if the specified section exists in the INI file, 0 otherwise (undefined if section_name is not
       defined).

   <b>AddSection</b> <b>(</b> <b>$sect_name</b> <b>)</b>
       Ensures that the named section exists in the INI file. If the section already exists, nothing is done. In
       this case, the "new" section will possibly contain data already.

       If you really need to have a new section with no parameters in it, check that the name that you're adding
       isn't in the list of sections already.

   <b>DeleteSection</b> <b>(</b> <b>$sect_name</b> <b>)</b>
       Completely removes the entire section from the configuration.

   <b>RenameSection</b> <b>(</b> <b>$old_section_name,</b> <b>$new_section_name,</b> <b>$include_groupmembers)</b>
       Renames a section if it does not already exist, optionally including groupmembers

   <b>CopySection</b> <b>(</b> <b>$old_section_name,</b> <b>$new_section_name,</b> <b>$include_groupmembers)</b>
       Copies one section to another optionally including groupmembers

   <b>Parameters</b> <b>($sect_name)</b>
       Returns an array containing the parameters contained in the specified section.

   <b>Groups</b>
       Returns an array containing the names of available groups.

       Groups are specified in the config file as new sections of the form

         [GroupName MemberName]

       This is useful for building up lists.  Note that parameters within  a  "member"  section  are  referenced
       normally  (i.e.,  the section name is still "Groupname Membername", including the space) - the concept of
       Groups is to aid people building more complex configuration files.

   <b>SetGroupMember</b> <b>(</b> <b>$sect</b> <b>)</b>
       Makes sure that the specified section is a member of the appropriate group.

       Only intended for use in newval.

   <b>RemoveGroupMember</b> <b>(</b> <b>$sect</b> <b>)</b>
       Makes sure that the specified section is no longer a member of the appropriate group. Only  intended  for
       use in DeleteSection.

   <b>GroupMembers</b> <b>($group)</b>
       Returns an array containing the members of specified $group. Each element of the array is a section name.
       For example, given the sections

         [Group Element 1]
         ...

         [Group Element 2]
         ...

       GroupMembers would return ("Group Element 1", "Group Element 2").

   <b>SetWriteMode</b> <b>($mode)</b>
       Sets the mode (permissions) to use when writing the INI file.

       $mode must be a string representation of the octal mode.

   <b>GetWriteMode</b> <b>($mode)</b>
       Gets the current mode (permissions) to use when writing the INI file.

       $mode is a string representation of the octal mode.

   <b>WriteConfig</b> <b>($filename</b> <b>[,</b> <b>%options])</b>
       Writes out a new copy of the configuration file.  A temporary file is written out and then renamed to the
       specified filename.  Also see <b>BUGS</b> below.

       If  "-delta"  is  set to a true value in %options, and this object was imported from another (see "new"),
       only the differences between this object and the imported one will be recorded. Negative deltas  will  be
       encoded  into  comments,  so that a subsequent invocation of <u><b>new()</b></u> with the same imported object produces
       the same results (see the <u>-negativedeltas</u> option in "new").

       %options is not required.

       Returns true on success, "undef" on failure.

   <b>RewriteConfig</b>
       Same as WriteConfig, but specifies that the original configuration file should be rewritten.

   <b>GetFileName</b>
       Returns the filename associated with this INI file.

       If no filename has been specified, returns undef.

   <b>SetFileName</b> <b>($filename)</b>
       If you created the Config::IniFiles object without initialising from a file,  or  if  you  just  want  to
       change the name of the file to use for ReadConfig/RewriteConfig from now on, use this method.

       Returns $filename if that was a valid name, undef otherwise.

   <b>$ini-&gt;OutputConfigToFileHandle($fh,</b> <b>$delta)</b>
       Writes  OutputConfig  to the $fh filehandle. $delta should be set to 1 1 if writing only delta. This is a
       newer and safer version of OutputConfig() and one is encouraged to use it instead.

   <b>$ini-&gt;OutputConfig($delta)</b>
       Writes OutputConfig to STDOUT. Use <b>select()</b> to redirect STDOUT to the output target before  calling  this
       function. Optional argument should be set to 1 if writing only a delta. Also see OutputConfigToFileHandle

   <b>SetSectionComment($section,</b> <b>@comment)</b>
       Sets the comment for section $section to the lines contained in @comment.

       Each  comment  line  will  be prepended with the comment character (default is "#") if it doesn't already
       have a comment character (ie: if the line does not start with whitespace followed by an  allowed  comment
       character, default is "#" and ";").

       To clear a section comment, use DeleteSectionComment ($section)

   <b>GetSectionComment</b> <b>($section)</b>
       Returns  a  list  of  lines, being the comment attached to section $section. In scalar context, returns a
       string containing the lines of the comment separated by newlines.

       The lines are presented as-is, with whatever comment character was originally used on that line.

   <b>DeleteSectionComment</b> <b>($section)</b>
       Removes the comment for the specified section.

   <b>SetParameterComment</b> <b>($section,</b> <b>$parameter,</b> <b>@comment)</b>
       Sets the comment attached to a particular parameter.

       Any line of  @comment  that  does  not  have  a  comment  character  will  be  prepended  with  one.  See
       "SetSectionComment($section, @comment)" above

   <b>GetParameterComment</b> <b>($section,</b> <b>$parameter)</b>
       Gets  the  comment  attached  to  a  parameter.  In list context returns all comments - in scalar context
       returns them joined by newlines.

   <b>DeleteParameterComment</b> <b>($section,</b> <b>$parameter)</b>
       Deletes the comment attached to a parameter.

   <b>GetParameterEOT</b> <b>($section,</b> <b>$parameter)</b>
       Accessor method for the EOT text (in fact, style) of the specified parameter. If any text is used  as  an
       EOT  mark,  this  will  be  returned.  If the parameter was not recorded using HERE style multiple lines,
       GetParameterEOT returns undef.

   <b>$cfg-&gt;SetParameterEOT</b> <b>($section,</b> <b>$parameter,</b> <b>$EOT)</b>
       Accessor method for the EOT text for the specified parameter. Sets the HERE  style  marker  text  to  the
       value $EOT. Once the EOT text is set, that parameter will be saved in HERE style.

       To un-set the EOT text, use DeleteParameterEOT ($section, $parameter).

   <b>DeleteParameterEOT</b> <b>($section,</b> <b>$parameter)</b>
       Removes the EOT marker for the given section and parameter.  When writing a configuration file, if no EOT
       marker is defined then "EOT" is used.

   <b>SetParameterTrailingComment</b> <b>($section,</b> <b>$parameter,</b> <b>$cmt)</b>
       Set  the  end  trailing  comment  for the given section and parameter.  If there is a old comment for the
       parameter, it will be overwritten by the new one.

       If there is a new parameter trailing comment to be added, the value should be added first.

   <b>GetParameterTrailingComment</b> <b>($section,</b> <b>$parameter)</b>
       An accessor method to read the trailing comment after  the  parameter.   The  trailing  comment  will  be
       returned  if there is one. A null string will be returned if the parameter exists but there is no comment
       for it.  otherwise, undef will be returned.

   <b>Delete</b>
       Deletes the entire configuration file in memory.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b> <b>--</b> <b>Tied</b> <b>Hash</b></h4><pre>
   <b>tie</b> <b>%ini,</b> <b>'Config::IniFiles',</b> <b>(-file=&gt;$filename,</b> <b>[-option=&gt;value</b> <b>...]</b> <b>)</b>
       Using "tie", you can tie a hash to a <b>Config::IniFiles</b> object. This creates a new  object  which  you  can
       access  through  your  hash,  so  you use this instead of the <b>new</b> method. This actually creates a hash of
       hashes to access the values in the INI file. The options you provide through "tie" are the same as  given
       for the <b>new</b> method, above.

       Here's an example:

         use Config::IniFiles;

         my %ini;
         tie %ini, 'Config::IniFiles', ( -file =&gt; "/path/configfile.ini" );

         print "We have $ini{Section}{Parameter}." if $ini{Section}{Parameter};

       Accessing  and using the hash works just like accessing a regular hash and many of the object methods are
       made available through the hash interface.

       For those methods that do not coincide with the hash paradigm, you can use the Perl  "tied"  function  to
       get  at the underlying object tied to the hash and call methods on that object. For example, to write the
       hash out to a new ini file, you would do something like this:

         tied( %ini )-&gt;WriteConfig( "/newpath/newconfig.ini" ) ||
           die "Could not write settings to new file.";

   <b>$val</b> <b>=</b> <b>$ini{$section}{$parameter}</b>
       Returns the value of $parameter in $section.

       Multiline values accessed through a hash will be returned as a list in list context  and  a  concatenated
       value in scalar context.

   <b>$ini{$section}{$parameter}</b> <b>=</b> <b>$value;</b>
       Sets the value of $parameter in $section to $value.

       To set a multiline or multi-value parameter just assign an array reference to the hash entry, like this:

        $ini{$section}{$parameter} = [$value1, $value2, ...];

       If  the  parameter did not exist in the original file, it will be created. However, Perl does not seem to
       extend autovivification to tied hashes. That means that if you try to say

         $ini{new_section}{new_paramters} = $val;

       and the section 'new_section' does not exist, then Perl won't properly create it. In order to work around
       this you will need to create a hash reference in that  section  and  then  assign  the  parameter  value.
       Something like this should do nicely:

         $ini{new_section} = {};
         $ini{new_section}{new_paramters} = $val;

   <b>%hash</b> <b>=</b> <b>%{$ini{$section}}</b>
       Using  the  tie  interface, you can copy whole sections of the ini file into another hash. Note that this
       makes a copy of the entire section. The new hash in no longer tied to the ini file, In  particular,  this
       means -default and -nocase settings will not apply to %hash.

   <b>$ini{$section}</b> <b>=</b> <b>{};</b> <b>%{$ini{$section}}</b> <b>=</b> <b>%parameters;</b>
       Through  the  hash  interface,  you  have  the  ability  to  replace the entire section with a new set of
       parameters. This call will fail, however, if the argument passed in NOT a hash reference.  You  must  use
       both lines, as shown above so that Perl recognizes the section as a hash reference context before COPYing
       over the values from your %parameters hash.

   <b>delete</b> <b>$ini{$section}{$parameter}</b>
       When  tied  to  a  hash,  you  can use the Perl "delete" function to completely remove a parameter from a
       section.

   <b>delete</b> <b>$ini{$section}</b>
       The tied interface also allows you to delete an entire section from the ini file using the Perl  "delete"
       function.

   <b>%ini</b> <b>=</b> <b>();</b>
       If you really want to delete <b>all</b> the items in the ini file, this will do it. Of course, the changes won't
       be written to the actual file unless you call <b>RewriteConfig</b> on the object tied to the hash.

   <b>Parameter</b> <b>names</b>
       my @keys = keys %{$ini{$section}}
       while (($k, $v) = each %{$ini{$section}}) {...}
       if( exists %{$ini{$section}}, $parameter ) {...}

       When  tied  to  a  hash,  you use the Perl "keys" and "each" functions to iteratively list the parameters
       ("keys") or parameters and their values ("each") in a given section.

       You can also use the Perl "exists" function to see if a parameter is defined in a given section.

       Note that none of these will return parameter names that are  part  of  the  default  section  (if  set),
       although  accessing  an  unknown  parameter in the specified section will return a value from the default
       section if there is one.

   <b>Section</b> <b>names</b>
       foreach( keys %ini ) {...}
       while (($k, $v) = each %ini) {...}
       if( exists %ini, $section ) {...}

       When tied to a hash, you use the Perl "keys" and "each" functions to iteratively list the sections in the
       ini file.

       You can also use the Perl "exists" function to see if a section is defined in the file.

</pre><h4><b>IMPORT</b> <b>/</b> <b>DELTA</b> <b>FEATURES</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>-import</u> option to "new" allows one to stack one <u>Config::IniFiles</u> object  on  top  of  another  (which
       might  be  itself  stacked  in  turn and so on recursively, but this is beyond the point). The effect, as
       briefly explained in "new", is that the fields appearing in the composite object will be a  superposition
       of  those  coming  from  the  ``original''  one  and  the  lines  coming from the file, the latter taking
       precedence. For example, let's say that $master and "overlay" were created like this:

          my $master  = Config::IniFiles-&gt;new(-file =&gt; "master.ini");
          my $overlay = Config::IniFiles-&gt;new(-file =&gt; "overlay.ini",
                   -import =&gt; $master);

       If the contents of "master.ini" and "overlay.ini" are respectively

          ; master.ini
          [section1]
          arg0=unchanged from master.ini
          arg1=val1

          [section2]
          arg2=val2

       and

          ; overlay.ini
          [section1]
          arg1=overridden

       Then "$overlay-&gt;val("section1", "arg1")" is "overridden", while  "$overlay-&gt;val("section1",  "arg0")"  is
       "unchanged from master.ini".

       This  feature  may  be used to ship a ``global defaults'' configuration file for a Perl application, that
       can be overridden piecewise by a much shorter, per-site  configuration  file.  Assuming  UNIX-style  path
       names, this would be done like this:

          my $defaultconfig = Config::IniFiles-&gt;new
              (-file =&gt; "/usr/share/myapp/myapp.ini.default");
          my $config = Config::IniFiles-&gt;new
              (-file =&gt; "/etc/myapp.ini", -import =&gt; $defaultconfig);
          # Now use $config and forget about $defaultconfig in the rest of
          # the program

       Starting  with  version  2.39,  <u>Config::IniFiles</u>  also provides features to keep the importing / per-site
       configuration file small, by only saving those options that were modified by the  running  program.  That
       is, if one calls

          $overlay-&gt;setval("section1", "arg1", "anotherval");
          $overlay-&gt;newval("section3", "arg3", "val3");
          $overlay-&gt;WriteConfig('overlay.ini', -delta=&gt;1);

       "overlay.ini" would now contain

          ; overlay.ini
          [section1]
          arg1=anotherval

          [section3]
          arg3=val3

       This is called a <u>delta</u> <u>file</u> (see "WriteConfig"). The untouched [section2] and arg0 do not appear, and the
       config file is therefore shorter; while of course, reloading the configuration into $master and $overlay,
       either  through  "$overlay-&gt;ReadConfig()"  or  through  the  same  code  as  above (e.g. when application
       restarts), would yield exactly the same result had the overlay object been saved in  whole  to  the  file
       system.

       The  only  problem  with  this  delta  technique  is  one cannot delete the default values in the overlay
       configuration file, only change them. This  is  solved  by  a  file  format  extension,  enabled  by  the
       <u>-negativedeltas</u> option to "new": if, say, one would delete parameters like this,

          $overlay-&gt;DeleteSection("section2");
          $overlay-&gt;delval("section1", "arg0");
          $overlay-&gt;WriteConfig('overlay.ini', -delta=&gt;1);

       The <u>overlay.ini</u> file would now read:

          ; overlay.ini
          [section1]
          ; arg0 is deleted
          arg1=anotherval

          ; [section2] is deleted

          [section3]
          arg3=val3

       Assuming  $overlay was later re-read with "-negativedeltas =&gt; 1", the parser would interpret the deletion
       comments to yield the correct result, that is, [section2] and arg0 would cease to exist in  the  $overlay
       object.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>@Config::IniFiles::errors</b>
       Contains  a  list  of errors encountered while parsing the configuration file.  If the <u>new</u> method returns
       <b>undef</b>, check the value of this to find out what's wrong.  This value is reset each time a config file  is
       read.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       •  The  output  from [Re]WriteConfig/OutputConfig might not be as pretty as it can be.  Comments are tied
          to whatever was immediately below them.  And case is not preserved for Section and Parameter names  if
          the -nocase option was used.

       •  No  locking  is  done  by  [Re]WriteConfig.  When writing servers, take care that only the parent ever
          calls this, and consider making your own backup.

</pre><h4><b>Data</b> <b>Structure</b></h4><pre>
