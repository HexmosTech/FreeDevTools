</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Config - access Perl configuration information

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Config;
           if ($Config{usethreads}) {
               print "has thread support\n"
           }

           use Config qw(myconfig config_sh config_vars config_re);

           print myconfig();

           print config_sh();

           print config_re();

           config_vars(qw(osname archname));

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The Config module contains all the information that was available to the <u>Configure</u> program at Perl build
       time (over 900 values).

       Shell variables from the <u>config.sh</u> file (written by Configure) are stored in the readonly-variable
       %Config, indexed by their names.

       Values stored in config.sh as 'undef' are returned as undefined values.  The perl "exists" function can
       be used to check if a named variable exists.

       For a description of the variables, please have a look at the Glossary file, as written in the Porting
       folder, or use the url: https://github.com/Perl/perl5/blob/blead/Porting/Glossary

       <b>myconfig()</b>
           Returns  a  textual  summary  of  the  major  perl  configuration  values.  See also "-V" in "Command
           Switches" in perlrun.

       <b>config_sh()</b>
           Returns the entire perl configuration information  in  the  form  of  the  original  config.sh  shell
           variable assignment script.

       config_re($regex)
           Like <b>config_sh()</b> but returns, as a list, only the config entries who's names match the $regex.

       config_vars(@names)
           Prints  to  STDOUT the values of the named configuration variable. Each is printed on a separate line
           in the form:

             name='value';

           Names which are unknown are output as "name='UNKNOWN';".  See also "-V:name" in "Command Switches" in
           perlrun.

       <b>bincompat_options()</b>
           Returns a list of C pre-processor options used when compiling this  <u>perl</u>  binary,  which  affect  its
           binary  compatibility  with  extensions.   bincompat_options()  and non_bincompat_options() are shown
           together in the output of "perl -V" as <u>Compile-time</u> <u>options</u>.

       <b>non_bincompat_options()</b>
           Returns a list of C pre-processor options used when compiling this <u>perl</u> binary, which do  not  affect
           binary compatibility with extensions.

       <b>compile_date()</b>
           Returns the compile date (as a string), equivalent to what is shown by "perl -V"

       <b>local_patches()</b>
           Returns a list of the names of locally applied patches, equivalent to what is shown by "perl -V".

       <b>header_files()</b>
           Returns  a list of the header files that should be used as dependencies for XS code, for this version
           of Perl on this platform.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       Here's a more sophisticated example of using %Config:

           use Config;
           use strict;

           my %sig_num;
           my @sig_name;
           unless($Config{sig_name} &amp;&amp; $Config{sig_num}) {
               die "No sigs?";
           } else {
               my @names = split ' ', $Config{sig_name};
               @sig_num{@names} = split ' ', $Config{sig_num};
               foreach (@names) {
                   $sig_name[$sig_num{$_}] ||= $_;
               }
           }

           print "signal #17 = $sig_name[17]\n";
           if ($sig_num{ALRM}) {
               print "SIGALRM is $sig_num{ALRM}\n";
           }

</pre><h4><b>WARNING</b></h4><pre>
       Because this information is not stored within the perl executable itself it is  possible  (but  unlikely)
       that the information does not relate to the actual perl binary which is being used to access it.

       The   Config   module  is  installed  into  the  architecture  and  version  specific  library  directory
       ($Config{installarchlib}) and it checks the perl version number when loaded.

       The values stored in config.sh may be either single-quoted or double-quoted.  Double-quoted  strings  are
       handy  for  those  cases  where  you  need  to  include escape sequences in the strings. To avoid runtime
       variable interpolation, any "$" and "@" characters are replaced by  "\$"  and  "\@",  respectively.  This
       isn't foolproof, of course, so don't embed "\$" or "\@" in double-quoted strings unless you're willing to
       deal  with  the  consequences.  (The slashes will end up escaped and the "$" or "@" will trigger variable
       interpolation)

</pre><h4><b>GLOSSARY</b></h4><pre>
       Most "Config" variables are determined by the "Configure" script on platforms supported by it  (which  is
       most  UNIX platforms).  Some platforms have custom-made "Config" variables, and may thus not have some of
       the variables described below, or may have extraneous variables specific to that  particular  port.   See
       the port specific documentation in such cases.

   <b>P</b>
       "PERL_API_REVISION"
           From <u>patchlevel.h</u>:

           This  number  describes  the  earliest compatible "PERL_REVISION" of Perl ("compatibility" here being
           defined as sufficient <u>binary/"API"</u> compatibility to run "XS" code  built  with  the  older  version).
           Normally this does not change across maintenance releases.  Please read the comment in <u>patchlevel.h</u>.

       "PERL_API_SUBVERSION"
           From <u>patchlevel.h</u>:

           This  number  describes the earliest compatible "PERL_SUBVERSION" of Perl ("compatibility" here being
           defined as sufficient <u>binary/"API"</u> compatibility to run "XS" code  built  with  the  older  version).
           Normally this does not change across maintenance releases.  Please read the comment in <u>patchlevel.h</u>.

       "PERL_API_VERSION"
           From <u>patchlevel.h</u>:

           This  number  describes  the  earliest  compatible "PERL_VERSION" of Perl ("compatibility" here being
           defined as sufficient <u>binary/"API"</u> compatibility to run "XS" code  built  with  the  older  version).
           Normally this does not change across maintenance releases.  Please read the comment in <u>patchlevel.h</u>.

       "PERL_CONFIG_SH"
           From <u>Oldsyms.U</u>:

           This  is set to "true" in <u>config.sh</u> so that a shell script sourcing <u>config.sh</u> can tell if it has been
           sourced already.

       "PERL_PATCHLEVEL"
           From <u>Oldsyms.U</u>:

           This symbol reflects the patchlevel, if available. Will usually come from the <u>.patch</u> file,  which  is
           available when the perl source tree was fetched with rsync.

       "PERL_REVISION"
           From <u>Oldsyms.U</u>:

           In a Perl version number such as 5.6.2, this is the 5.  This value is manually set in <u>patchlevel.h</u>

       "PERL_SUBVERSION"
           From <u>Oldsyms.U</u>:

           In  a Perl version number such as 5.6.2, this is the 2.  Values greater than 50 represent potentially
           unstable development subversions.  This value is manually set in <u>patchlevel.h</u>

       "PERL_VERSION"
           From <u>Oldsyms.U</u>:

           In a Perl version number such as 5.6.2, this is the 6.  This value is manually set in <u>patchlevel.h</u>

   <b>_</b>
       "_a"
           From <u>Unix.U</u>:

           This variable defines the extension used for ordinary library files.  For unix, it is <u>.a</u>.  The  <u>.</u>  is
           included.  Other possible values include <u>.lib</u>.

       "_exe"
           From <u>Unix.U</u>:

           This  variable  defines  the extension used for executable files.  "DJGPP", Cygwin and <u>OS/2</u> use <u>.exe</u>.
           Stratus "VOS" uses <u>.pm</u>.  On  operating  systems  which  do  not  require  a  specific  extension  for
           executable files, this variable is empty.

       "_o"
           From <u>Unix.U</u>:

           This  variable  defines the extension used for object files.  For unix, it is <u>.o</u>.  The <u>.</u> is included.
           Other possible values include <u>.obj</u>.

   <b>a</b>
       "afs"
           From <u>afs.U</u>:

           This variable is set to "true" if  "AFS"  (Andrew  File  System)  is  used  on  the  system,  "false"
           otherwise.   It  is  possible  to  override  this with a hint value or command line option, but you'd
           better know what you are doing.

       "afsroot"
           From <u>afs.U</u>:

           This variable is by default set to <u>/afs</u>. In the unlikely case this is not the  correct  root,  it  is
           possible  to override this with a hint value or command line option.  This will be used in subsequent
           tests for AFSness in the configure and test process.

       "alignbytes"
           From <u>alignbytes.U</u>:

           This variable holds the number of  bytes  required  to  align  a  double--  or  a  long  double  when
           applicable. Usual values are 2, 4 and 8.  The default is eight, for safety.

       "aphostname"
           From <u>d_gethname.U</u>:

           This  variable  contains the command which can be used to compute the host name. The command is fully
           qualified by its absolute path, to make it safe when used by a process with super-user privileges.

       "api_revision"
           From <u>patchlevel.U</u>:

           The three variables, api_revision, api_version, and api_subversion, specify the version of the oldest
           perl binary compatible with the present perl.  In a full version string such as  <u>5.6.1</u>,  api_revision
           is the 5.  Prior to 5.5.640, the format was a floating point number, like 5.00563.

           <u>perl.c</u>:<b>incpush()</b>  and  <u>lib/lib.pm</u> will automatically search in <u>$sitelib/.</u>. for older directories back
           to the limit specified by these api_ variables.  This is only useful  if  you  have  a  perl  library
           directory  tree  structured  like  the default one.  See "INSTALL" for how this works.  The versioned
           site_perl directory was introduced in 5.005, so that is the lowest possible value.  The version  list
           appropriate for the current system is determined in <u>inc_version_list.U</u>.

           "XXX"  To  do:   Since compatibility can depend on compile time options (such as bincompat, longlong,
           etc.) it should (perhaps) be set by Configure, but currently it isn't.  Currently, we  read  a  hard-
           wired  value  from  <u>patchlevel.h</u>.   Perhaps  what  we  ought  to do is take the hard-wired value from
           <u>patchlevel.h</u> but then modify it if the current Configure options warrant.   <u>patchlevel.h</u>  then  would
           use an #ifdef guard.

       "api_subversion"
           From <u>patchlevel.U</u>:

           The three variables, api_revision, api_version, and api_subversion, specify the version of the oldest
           perl binary compatible with the present perl.  In a full version string such as <u>5.6.1</u>, api_subversion
           is the 1.  See api_revision for full details.

       "api_version"
           From <u>patchlevel.U</u>:

           The three variables, api_revision, api_version, and api_subversion, specify the version of the oldest
           perl binary compatible with the present perl.  In a full version string such as <u>5.6.1</u>, api_version is
           the  6.  See api_revision for full details.  As a special case, 5.5.0 is rendered in the old-style as
           5.005.  (In the 5.005_0x maintenance series, this was the only versioned directory in $sitelib.)

       "api_versionstring"
           From <u>patchlevel.U</u>:

           This variable combines api_revision, api_version, and api_subversion in a format such  as  5.6.1  (or
           5_6_1) suitable for use as a directory name.  This is filesystem dependent.

       "ar"
           From <u>Loc.U</u>:

           This  variable  is  used  internally  by  Configure to determine the full pathname (if any) of the ar
           program.  After Configure runs, the value is reset to a plain "ar" and is not useful.

       "archlib"
           From <u>archlib.U</u>:

           This variable holds the name of the directory in which the user wants to  put  architecture-dependent
           public  library  files  for  $package.   It  is  most often a local directory such as <u><a href="file:/usr/local/lib">/usr/local/lib</a></u>.
           Programs using this variable must be prepared to deal with filename expansion.

       "archlibexp"
           From <u>archlib.U</u>:

           This variable is the same as the archlib variable, but is filename expanded  at  configuration  time,
           for convenient use.

       "archname"
           From <u>archname.U</u>:

           This  variable  is  a  short  name  to  characterize  the current architecture.  It is used mainly to
           construct the default archlib.

       "archname64"
           From <u>use64bits.U</u>:

           This variable is used for the 64-bitness part of $archname.

       "archobjs"
           From <u>Unix.U</u>:

           This variable defines any additional objects that  must  be  linked  in  with  the  program  on  this
           architecture.   On  unix,  it  is  usually empty.  It is typically used to include emulations of unix
           calls or other facilities.  For perl on <u>OS/2</u>, for example, this would include <u>os2/os2.obj</u>.

       "asctime_r_proto"
           From <u>d_asctime_r.U</u>:

           This variable encodes the prototype of asctime_r.  It is zero if d_asctime_r is undef, and one of the
           "REENTRANT_PROTO_T_ABC" macros of <u>reentr.h</u> if d_asctime_r is defined.

       "awk"
           From <u>Loc.U</u>:

           This variable is used internally by Configure to determine the full pathname  (if  any)  of  the  awk
           program.  After Configure runs, the value is reset to a plain "awk" and is not useful.

   <b>b</b>
       "baserev"
           From <u>baserev.U</u>:

           The base revision level of this package, from the <u>.package</u> file.

       "bash"
           From <u>Loc.U</u>:

           This variable is defined but not used by Configure.  The value is the empty string and is not useful.

       "bin"
           From <u>bin.U</u>:

           This  variable  holds  the  name  of the directory in which the user wants to put publicly executable
           images for the package in question.  It is most often  a  local  directory  such  as  <u><a href="file:/usr/local/bin">/usr/local/bin</a></u>.
           Programs using this variable must be prepared to deal with <u>~name</u> substitution.

       "bin_ELF"
           From <u>dlsrc.U</u>:

           This  variable saves the result from configure if generated binaries are in "ELF" format. Only set to
           defined when the test has actually been performed, and the result was positive.

       "binexp"
           From <u>bin.U</u>:

           This is the same as the bin variable, but is filename expanded at configuration time, for use in your
           makefiles.

       "bison"
           From <u>Loc.U</u>:

           This variable is used internally by Configure to determine the full pathname (if any)  of  the  bison
           program.  After Configure runs, the value is reset to a plain "bison" and is not useful.

       "byacc"
           From <u>Loc.U</u>:

           This  variable  is  used internally by Configure to determine the full pathname (if any) of the byacc
           program.  After Configure runs, the value is reset to a plain "byacc" and is not useful.

       "byteorder"
           From <u>byteorder.U</u>:

           This variable holds the byte order  in  a  "UV".  In  the  following,  larger  digits  indicate  more
           significance.   The  variable  byteorder is either 4321 on a big-endian machine, or 1234 on a little-
           endian, or 87654321 on a Cray ... or 3412 with weird order !

   <b>c</b>
       "c" From <u>n.U</u>:

           This variable contains the \c string if that is what causes the echo  command  to  suppress  newline.
           Otherwise it is null.  Correct usage is $echo $n "prompt for a question: $c".

       "castflags"
           From <u>d_castneg.U</u>:

           This  variable contains a flag that precise difficulties the compiler has casting odd floating values
           to unsigned long: 0 = ok 1 = couldn't cast &lt; 0 2 = couldn't cast &gt;= 0x80000000 4 = couldn't  cast  in
           argument expression list

       "cat"
           From <u>Loc.U</u>:

           This  variable  is  used  internally  by Configure to determine the full pathname (if any) of the cat
           program.  After Configure runs, the value is reset to a plain "cat" and is not useful.

       "cc"
           From <u>cc.U</u>:

           This variable holds the name of a command to execute a C compiler which can resolve  multiple  global
           references  that  happen  to  have  the  same name.  Usual values are "cc" and "gcc".  Fervent "ANSI"
           compilers may be called "c89".  "AIX" has xlc.

       "cccdlflags"
           From <u>dlsrc.U</u>:

           This variable contains any special flags that might need to be passed with "cc -c" to compile modules
           to be used to create a shared library that will be used for dynamic loading.  For hpux,  this  should
           be +z.  It is up to the makefile to use it.

       "ccdlflags"
           From <u>dlsrc.U</u>:

           This  variable  contains  any  special flags that might need to be passed to cc to link with a shared
           library for dynamic loading.  It is up to the makefile to use it.  For sunos 4.1, it should be empty.

       "ccflags"
           From <u>ccflags.U</u>:

           This variable contains any additional C compiler flags desired by the user.  It is up to the Makefile
           to use this.

       "ccflags_uselargefiles"
           From <u>uselfs.U</u>:

           This variable contains the compiler flags needed by large file builds and added to ccflags  by  hints
           files.

       "ccname"
           From <u>Checkcc.U</u>:

           This  can  set either by hints files or by Configure.  If using gcc, this is gcc, and if not, usually
           equal to cc, unimpressive, no?  Some platforms, however, make good use of this by storing the  flavor
           of  the  C  compiler  being  used  here.  For example if using the Sun WorkShop suite, ccname will be
           "workshop".

       "ccsymbols"
           From <u>Cppsym.U</u>:

           The variable contains the symbols defined by the C compiler alone.  The symbols defined by cpp or  by
           cc  when  it  calls  cpp are not in this list, see cppsymbols and cppccsymbols.  The list is a space-
           separated list of symbol=value tokens.

       "ccversion"
           From <u>Checkcc.U</u>:

           This can set either by hints files or by Configure.  If using a (non-gcc) vendor  cc,  this  variable
           may contain a version for the compiler.

       "cf_by"
           From <u>cf_who.U</u>:

           Login name of the person who ran the Configure script and answered the questions. This is used to tag
           both <u>config.sh</u> and <u>config_h.SH</u>.

       "cf_email"

       "d_Gconvert"
           From <u>d_gconvert.U</u>:

           This variable holds what Gconvert is defined as to convert floating point numbers into  strings.   By
           default,  Configure  sets  "this"  macro  to  use  the  first of gconvert, gcvt, or sprintf that pass
           sprintf-%g-like behavior tests.  If perl is using long doubles, the  macro  uses  the  first  of  the
           following  functions  that  pass  Configure's  tests:  qgcvt, sprintf (if Configure knows how to make
           sprintf format long doubles--see sPRIgldbl), gconvert, gcvt, and sprintf (casting  to  double).   The
           gconvert_preference   and   gconvert_ld_preference   variables  can  be  used  to  alter  Configure's
           preferences, for doubles and long doubles, respectively.  If present, they contain a  space-separated
           list of one or more of the above function names in the order they should be tried.

           d_Gconvert  may  be  set  to override Configure with a platform- specific function.  If this function
           expects a double, a different value may need to be set by the  <u>uselongdouble.cbu</u>  call-back  unit  so
           that long doubles can be formatted without loss of precision.

           From <u>inc_version_list.U</u>:

           This variable holds the same list as inc_version_list, but each item is enclosed in double quotes and
           separated by commas, suitable for use in the "PERL_INC_VERSION_LIST" initialization.

       "incpath"
           From <u>usrinc.U</u>:

           This  variable  must precede the normal include path to get the right one, as in <u>$incpath/usr/include</u>

       "initialinstalllocation"
           From <u>bin.U</u>:

           When  userelocatableinc  is  true, this variable holds the location that make install should copy the
           perl binary to, with all the run-time relocatable paths calculated from this at install  time.   When
           used, it is initialized to the original value of binexp, and then binexp is set to <u>.../</u>, as the other
           binaries are found relative to the perl binary.

       "installarchlib"
           From <u>archlib.U</u>:

           This variable is really the same as archlibexp but may differ on those systems using "AFS". For extra
           portability, only this variable should be used in makefiles.

       "installbin"
           From <u>bin.U</u>:

           This  variable  is  the  same  as binexp unless "AFS" is running in which case the user is explicitly

           the  read/write  location  whereas man3direxp only points to the read-only access location. For extra
           portability, you should only use this variable within your makefiles.

       "installprefix"
           From <u>installprefix.U</u>:

           This variable holds the name of the directory below which "make install" will  install  the  package.
           For most users, this is the same as prefix.  However, it is useful for installing the software into a
           different  (usually  temporary)  location  after  which it can be bundled up and moved somehow to the
           final location specified by prefix.

       "installprefixexp"
           From <u>installprefix.U</u>:

           This variable holds the full absolute path of installprefix with all <u>~</u>-expansion done.

           From <u>sitehtml1dir.U</u>:

           This variable is really the same as sitehtml1direxp, unless you are using  "AFS"  in  which  case  it
           points  to  the read/write location whereas html1direxp only points to the read-only access location.

       "installsitescript"
           From <u>sitescript.U</u>:

           This variable is usually the same as sitescriptexp, unless you are on  a  system  running  "AFS",  in
           which  case  they  may differ slightly. You should always use this variable within your makefiles for
           portability.

       "installstyle"
           From <u>installstyle.U</u>:

           This variable describes the "style" of the perl installation.  This is  intended  to  be  useful  for
           tools  that  need  to manipulate entire perl distributions.  Perl itself doesn't use this to find its
           libraries -- the library directories are stored directly in <u>Config.pm</u>.  Currently, there are only two
           styles:  "lib" and <u>lib/perl5</u>.  The default library  locations  (e.g.  privlib,  sitelib)  are  either
           <u>$prefix/lib</u>  or  <u>$prefix/lib/perl5</u>.  The former is useful if $prefix is a directory dedicated to perl
           (e.g. <u>/opt/perl</u>), while the latter is  useful  if  $prefix  is  shared  by  many  packages,  e.g.  if
           $prefix=<u><a href="file:/usr/local">/usr/local</a></u>.

           Unfortunately,  while  this  "style"  variable  is  used  to  set  defaults  for  all three directory
           hierarchies (core, vendor, and site),  there  is  no  guarantee  that  the  same  style  is  actually
           appropriate  for  all  those  directories.   For example, $prefix might be <u>/opt/perl</u>, but $siteprefix
           might be <u><a href="file:/usr/local">/usr/local</a></u>.  (Perhaps, in retrospect, the "lib" style should never have been supported,  but
           it did seem like a nice idea at the time.)

           The  situation  is even less clear for tools such as MakeMaker that can be used to install additional
           modules into non-standard places.  For example, if a user intends to install a module into a  private
           directory  (perhaps  by setting "PREFIX" on the <u>Makefile.PL</u> command line), then there is no reason to
           assume that the Configure-time $installstyle setting will be relevant for that "PREFIX".

           This may later be extended to include other information, so be careful with pattern-matching  on  the
           results.

           For  compatibility with <u>perl5.005</u> and earlier, the default setting is based on whether or not $prefix
           contains the string "perl".

       "installusrbinperl"
           From <u>instubperl.U</u>:

           This variable  tells  whether  Perl  should  be  installed  also  as  <u><a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?perl">/usr/bin/perl</a></u>  in  addition  to
           <u>$installbin/perl</u>

       "installvendorarch"
           From <u>vendorarch.U</u>:

       "installvendorman3dir"
           From <u>vendorman3dir.U</u>:

           This variable is really the same as vendorman3direxp but may differ on those systems using "AFS". For

   <b>k</b>
       "known_extensions"
           From <u>Extensions.U</u>:

           This  variable  holds  a list of all extensions (both "XS" and non-xs) included in the package source
           distribution.  This information is only really of use during the Perl build, as  the  list  makes  no
           distinction  between  extensions  which  were  build  and  installed, and those which where not.  See
           "extensions" for the list of extensions actually built and available.

       "ksh"
           From <u>Loc.U</u>:

           This variable is defined but not used by Configure.  The value is the empty string and is not useful.

       "ld"
           From <u>dlsrc.U</u>:

           This variable indicates the program to be used to  link  libraries  for  dynamic  loading.   On  some
           systems, it is "ld".  On "ELF" systems, it should be $cc.  Mostly, we'll try to respect the hint file
           setting.

       "ld_can_script"
           From <u>dlsrc.U</u>:

           This variable shows if the loader accepts scripts in the form of -Wl,--version-script=<u>ld.script</u>. This
           is currently only supported for "GNU" ld on "ELF" in dynamic loading builds.

       "lddlflags"
           From <u>dlsrc.U</u>:

           This  variable  contains  any  special  flags  that might need to be passed to $ld to create a shared
           library suitable for dynamic loading.  It is up to the makefile to use it.  For hpux,  it  should  be
           "-b".  For sunos 4.1, it is empty.

       "ldflags"
           From <u>ccflags.U</u>:

           This  variable  contains any additional C loader flags desired by the user.  It is up to the Makefile

           This variable is used internally by Configure to determine the full pathname (if  any)  of  the  less
           program.  After Configure runs, the value is reset to a plain "less" and is not useful.

       "lib_ext"
           From <u>Unix.U</u>:

           This is an old synonym for _a.

       "libc"
           From <u>libc.U</u>:

       "libperl"
           From <u>libperl.U</u>:

           The  perl  executable  is obtained by linking <u>perlmain.c</u> with libperl, any static extensions (usually
           just DynaLoader), and any other libraries needed on this system.  libperl is usually  <u>libperl.a</u>,  but
           can also be <u>libperl.so.xxx</u> if the user wishes to build a perl executable with a shared library.

       "libpth"
           From <u>libpth.U</u>:

           This  variable  holds the general path (space-separated) used to find libraries. It is intended to be

       "libs"
           From <u>libs.U</u>:

           This variable holds the additional libraries we want to use.  It is up to the Makefile to  deal  with
           it.  The list can be empty.

       "libswanted"
           From <u>Myinit.U</u>:

           This variable holds a list of all the libraries we want to search.  The order is chosen  to  pick  up
           the c library ahead of ucb or bsd libraries for SVR4.

       "libswanted_uselargefiles"
           From <u>uselfs.U</u>:

           This variable contains the libraries needed by large file builds and added to ldflags by hints files.

       "lkflags"
           From <u>ccflags.U</u>:

           This variable contains any additional C partial linker flags desired by the user.  It is  up  to  the
           Makefile to use this.

       "ln"
           From <u>Loc.U</u>:

           This  variable  is  used  internally  by  Configure to determine the full pathname (if any) of the ln
           program.  After Configure runs, the value is reset to a plain "ln" and is not useful.

       "lns"
           From <u>lns.U</u>:

           This variable holds the name of the command to make symbolic links (if they are supported).   It  can
           be used in the Makefile. It is either "ln -s" or "ln"

       "localtime_r_proto"
           From <u>d_localtime_r.U</u>:

           This variable encodes the prototype of localtime_r.  It is zero if d_localtime_r is undef, and one of
           the "REENTRANT_PROTO_T_ABC" macros of <u>reentr.h</u> if d_localtime_r is defined.

       "locincpth"
           From <u>ccflags.U</u>:

           This  variable  contains  a  list  of  additional  directories  to  be searched by the compiler.  The
           appropriate "-I" directives will be added to ccflags.  This is intended  to  simplify  setting  local
           directories  from the Configure command line.  It's not much, but it parallels the loclibpth stuff in
           <u>libpth.U</u>.

       "loclibpth"
           From <u>libpth.U</u>:

           This variable holds the paths (space-separated) used to find local libraries.   It  is  prepended  to
           libpth, and is intended to be easily set from the command line.

       "longdblinfbytes"
           From <u>infnan.U</u>:

           This  variable  contains  comma-separated  list  of  hexadecimal  bytes for the long double precision
           infinity.

       "longdblkind"
           From <u>d_longdbl.U</u>:

           This variable, if defined, encodes the type of a long double: 0 = double,  1  =  "IEEE"  754  128-bit
           little  endian,  2  = "IEEE" 754 128-bit big endian, 3 = x86 80-bit little endian, 4 = x86 80-bit big
           endian, 5 = double-double 128-bit little endian, 6 = double-double 128-bit big endian,  7  =  128-bit
           mixed-endian  double-double  (64-bit LEs in "BE"), 8 = 128-bit mixed-endian double-double (64-bit BEs
           in "LE"), 9 = 128-bit "PDP"-style mixed-endian long doubles, -1 = unknown format.

       "longdblmantbits"
           From <u>mantbits.U</u>:

           This symbol, if defined, tells how many mantissa bits there are in  long  double  precision  floating
           point format.  Note that this can be "LDBL_MANT_DIG" minus one, since "LDBL_MANT_DIG" can include the
           "IEEE" 754 implicit bit.  The common x86-style 80-bit long double does not have an implicit bit.

       "longdblnanbytes"
           From <u>infnan.U</u>:

           This variable contains comma-separated list of hexadecimal bytes for the long double precision not-a-

           This variable is defined but not used by Configure.  The value is the empty string and is not useful.

       "ls"
           From <u>Loc.U</u>:

           This  variable  is  used  internally  by  Configure to determine the full pathname (if any) of the ls
           program.  After Configure runs, the value is reset to a plain "ls" and is not useful.

       "lseeksize"
           From <u>lseektype.U</u>:

           This variable defines lseektype to be something like off_t, long, or whatever type is used to declare
           lseek offset's type in the kernel (which also appears to be lseek's return type).

       "lseektype"
           From <u>lseektype.U</u>:

           This variable defines lseektype to be something like off_t, long, or whatever type is used to declare

       "make_set_make"
           From <u>make.U</u>:

           Some  versions  of "make" set the variable "MAKE".  Others do not.  This variable contains the string
           to be included in <u>Makefile.SH</u> so that "MAKE" is set if needed,  and  not  if  not  needed.   Possible
           values are:

           make_set_make="#"        # If your make program handles this for you,

           make_set_make="MAKE=$make"    # if it doesn't.

           This  uses a comment character so that we can distinguish a "set" value (from a previous <u>config.sh</u> or
           Configure "-D" option) from an uncomputed value.

       "mallocobj"
           From <u>mallocsrc.U</u>:

           This variable contains the name of the <u>malloc.o</u> that this package  generates,  if  that  <u>malloc.o</u>  is

           From <u>mallocsrc.U</u>:

           This variable contains the name of the <u>malloc.c</u> that comes with the  package,  if  that  <u>malloc.c</u>  is
           preferred  over  the  system  malloc.   Otherwise  the  value is null.  This variable is intended for
           generating Makefiles.

       "malloctype"
           From <u>mallocsrc.U</u>:

           This variable contains the kind of ptr returned by malloc and realloc.

       "man1dir"
           From <u>man1dir.U</u>:

           This variable contains the name of the directory in which manual source pages are to be put.   It  is
           the  responsibility of the <u>Makefile.SH</u> to get the value of this into the proper command.  You must be
           prepared to do the <u>~name</u> expansion yourself.

       "man1direxp"
           From <u>man1dir.U</u>:

           This variable is the same as the man1dir variable, but is filename expanded  at  configuration  time,
           for convenient use in makefiles.

       "man1ext"
           From <u>man1dir.U</u>:

           From <u>man3dir.U</u>:

           This variable contains the name of the directory in which manual source pages are to be put.   It  is
           the  responsibility of the <u>Makefile.SH</u> to get the value of this into the proper command.  You must be
           prepared to do the <u>~name</u> expansion yourself.

       "man3direxp"
           From <u>man3dir.U</u>:

           This variable is the same as the man3dir variable, but is filename expanded  at  configuration  time,

           This variable holds the environment type for the mips system.  Possible  values  are  "BSD  4.3"  and
           "System V".

       "mistrustnm"
           From <u>Csym.U</u>:

           This  variable  can be used to establish a fallthrough for the cases where nm fails to find a symbol.
           If usenm is false or usenm is true and mistrustnm is false, this variable has no effect.  If usenm is
           true and mistrustnm is "compile", a test program will be compiled to try  to  find  any  symbol  that
           can't  be  located  via  nm  lookup.  If mistrustnm is "run", the test program will be run as well as
           being compiled.

       "mkdir"
           From <u>Loc.U</u>:

           This variable is used internally by Configure to determine the full pathname (if any)  of  the  mkdir
           program.  After Configure runs, the value is reset to a plain "mkdir" and is not useful.

       "mmaptype"
           From <u>d_mmap.U</u>:

           This symbol contains the type of pointer returned by <b>mmap()</b> (and simultaneously the type of the first
           argument).  It can be "void *" or "caddr_t".

           This  variable defines modetype to be something like mode_t, int, unsigned short, or whatever type is
           used to declare file modes for system calls.

       "more"
           From <u>Loc.U</u>:

           This variable is used internally by Configure to determine the full pathname (if  any)  of  the  more
           program.  After Configure runs, the value is reset to a plain "more" and is not useful.

       "multiarch"
           From <u>multiarch.U</u>:

           This  variable  conditionally  defines  the  "MULTIARCH"  symbol  which  signifies  the  presence  of
           multiplatform files.  This is normally set by hints files.

       "mv"
           From <u>Loc.U</u>:

           This variable is defined but not used by Configure.  The value is the empty string and is not useful.

       "myarchname"
           From <u>archname.U</u>:

           This variable holds the architecture name computed by Configure in a previous run. It is not intended
           to be perused by any user and should never be set in a hint file.

       "mydomain"
           From <u>myhostname.U</u>:

           This variable contains the eventual value of the "MYDOMAIN" symbol, which is the domain of  the  host
           the  program  is  going to run on.  The domain must be appended to myhostname to form a complete host
           name.  The dot comes with mydomain, and need not be supplied by the program.

       "myhostname"
           From <u>myhostname.U</u>:

           This variable contains the eventual value of the "MYHOSTNAME" symbol, which is the name of  the  host
           the  program  is  going  to  run  on.   The domain is not kept with hostname, but must be gotten from
           mydomain.  The dot comes with mydomain, and need not be supplied by the program.

       "myuname"
           From <u>Oldconfig.U</u>:

           The output of "uname -a" if available, otherwise the hostname.  The whole thing is  then  lower-cased
           and slashes and single quotes are removed.

   <b>n</b>
       "n" From <u>n.U</u>:

           This  variable  contains  the  "-n" flag if that is what causes the echo command to suppress newline.
           Otherwise it is null.  Correct usage is $echo $n "prompt for a question: $c".

       "need_va_copy"
           From <u>need_va_copy.U</u>:

           This symbol, if defined, indicates that the  system  stores  the  variable  argument  list  datatype,
           va_list,  in  a  format  that cannot be copied by simple assignment, so that some other means must be
           used when copying is required.  As such systems vary in their provision (or non-provision) of copying
           mechanisms, <u>handy.h</u> defines a platform- "independent" macro, Perl_va_copy(src, dst), to do the job.

       "netdb_hlen_type"
           From <u>netdbtype.U</u>:

           This variable holds the type used for the 2nd argument to <b>gethostbyaddr()</b>.  Usually, this is  int  or
           size_t or unsigned.  This is only useful if you have <b>gethostbyaddr()</b>, naturally.

           <b>gethostbyaddr()</b>, naturally.

       "netdb_name_type"
           From <u>netdbtype.U</u>:

           This  variable  holds  the type used for the argument to <b>gethostbyname()</b>.  Usually, this is char * or
           const char *.  This is only useful if you have <b>gethostbyname()</b>, naturally.

       "netdb_net_type"
           From <u>netdbtype.U</u>:

           This variable holds the type used for the 1st argument to <b>getnetbyaddr()</b>.  Usually, this  is  int  or

           This  variable  is  used  internally  by  Configure to determine the full pathname (if any) of the nm
           program.  After Configure runs, the value is reset to a plain "nm" and is not useful.

       "nm_opt"
           From <u>usenm.U</u>:

           This variable holds the options that may be necessary for nm.

           From <u>usenm.U</u>:

           This variable holds the options that may be necessary for nm to work on a shared library but that can
           not be used on an archive library.  Currently, this is only used by  Linux,  where  nm  --dynamic  is
           *required*  to get symbols from an "ELF" library which has been stripped, but nm --dynamic is *fatal*
           on an archive library.  Maybe Linux should just always set usenm=false.

       "nonxs_ext"
           From <u>Extensions.U</u>:

           This variable holds a list of all non-xs extensions built and installed by the package.  By  default,
           all  non-xs  extensions distributed will be built, with the exception of platform-specific extensions
           (currently only one "VMS" specific extension).

       "nroff"
           From <u>Loc.U</u>:

           This variable is used internally by Configure to determine the full pathname (if any)  of  the  nroff

           This  variable bears the symbol value to be used during <b>open()</b> or <b>fcntl()</b> to turn on non-blocking I/O
           for a file descriptor. If you  wish  to  switch  between  blocking  and  non-blocking,  you  may  try
           ioctl("FIOSNBIO") instead, but that is only supported by some devices.

       "obj_ext"
           From <u>Unix.U</u>:

           This is an old synonym for _o.

       "old_pthread_create_joinable"
           From <u>d_pthrattrj.U</u>:

           This variable defines the constant to use for creating joinable (aka undetached) pthreads.  Unused if
           <u>pthread.h</u>     defines     "PTHREAD_CREATE_JOINABLE".      If     used,     possible     values    are
           "PTHREAD_CREATE_UNDETACHED" and "__UNDETACHED".

           From <u>ccflags.U</u>:

           This variable contains any <u>optimizer/debugger</u> flag that should be used.  It is up to the Makefile  to
           use it.

       "orderlib"
           From <u>orderlib.U</u>:

           This  variable  is  "true"  if the components of libraries must be ordered (with `lorder $* | tsort`)

           From <u>Oldconfig.U</u>:

           This variable contains the operating system name (e.g. sunos, solaris, hpux, etc.).  It can be useful
           later on for setting defaults.  Any spaces are replaced with underscores.  It is set to a null string
           if we can't figure it out.

       "osvers"
           From <u>Oldconfig.U</u>:

           This variable contains the operating system version (e.g.  4.1.3, 5.2, etc.).  It is  primarily  used
           for helping select an appropriate hints file, but might be useful elsewhere for setting defaults.  It
           is  set  to '' if we can't figure it out.  We try to be flexible about how much of the version number
           to keep, e.g. if 4.1.1, 4.1.2, and 4.1.3 are essentially the same for this package, hints files might
           just be <u>os_4.0</u> or <u>os_4.1</u>, etc., not keeping separate files for each little release.

       "otherlibdirs"
           From <u>otherlibdirs.U</u>:

           This variable contains a colon-separated set of paths for the perl binary to  search  for  additional
           library  files  or  modules.   These  directories  will  be  tacked  to the end of @"INC".  Perl will
           automatically search below  each  path  for  version-  and  architecture-specific  directories.   See
           inc_version_list  for  more  details.  A value of " " means "none" and is used to preserve this value
           for the next run through Configure.

   <b>p</b>
       "package"
           From <u>package.U</u>:

           This variable contains the name of the package being constructed.  It is primarily intended  for  the

           From <u>nis.U</u>:

           This variable contains a command that produces the text of the <u><a href="file:/etc/passwd">/etc/passwd</a></u> file.   This  is  normally
           "cat  <u><a href="file:/etc/passwd">/etc/passwd</a></u>",  but  can  be "ypcat passwd" when "NIS" is used.  On some systems, such as os390,
           there may be no equivalent command, in which case this variable is unset.

       "patchlevel"
           From <u>patchlevel.U</u>:

           The patchlevel level of this package.  The value of patchlevel comes from the <u>patchlevel.h</u> file.   In
           a  version  number  such  as  5.6.1,  this  is  the  6.   In  <u>patchlevel.h</u>,  this  is  referred to as
           "PERL_VERSION".

       "path_sep"
           From <u>Unix.U</u>:

           This is an old synonym for p_ in <u>Head.U</u>, the character used to separate elements in the command shell
           search "PATH".

       "perl"
           From <u>Loc.U</u>:

           This variable is used internally by Configure to determine the full pathname (if  any)  of  the  perl
           program.  After Configure runs, the value is reset to a plain "perl" and is not useful.

       "perl5"
           From <u>perl5.U</u>:

           This  variable  contains the full path (if any) to a previously installed <u>perl5.005</u> or later suitable

       "perl_lc_all_category_positions_init"
           From <u>disparate_lc_all.U</u>:

           This symbol, when defined, gives the C initializer for an  array  whose  element  [0]  is  the  first
           category  in the string returned by setlocale("LC_ALL", "NULL") when not all categories are the same,
           on systems that use a positional notation.  After element [0]  is  $lc_all_separator_init,  then  the
           category given by element [1], and so on.

       "perl_lc_all_separator"
           From <u>disparate_lc_all.U</u>:

           This  symbol,  when defined, gives the substring used to separate categories in the aggregated string
           returned by setlocale("LC_ALL", "NULL") when not all categories are in the same locale.  This is  for
           systems that use a positional notation as opposed to "name=value" pairs.

       "perl_patchlevel"
           From <u>patchlevel.U</u>:

           This  is  the  Perl  patch  level,  a  numeric change identifier, as defined by whichever source code
           maintenance system is used to maintain the patches; currently Perforce.  It does not  correlate  with
           the  Perl  version  numbers  or  the  maintenance  versus  development dichotomy except by also being
           increasing.

           able  to find the installed <u>libperl.so</u>.  One way to do this on some systems is to set the environment
           variable "LD_RUN_PATH" to the directory that will be the final location  of  the  shared  <u>libperl.so</u>.
           The  makefile  can  use  this  with something like $shrpenv $("CC") -o perl <u>perlmain.o</u> $libperl $libs
           Typical values are shrpenv="env "LD_RUN_PATH"=<u>$archlibexp/"CORE"</u>" or shrpenv=''  See  the  main  perl
           <u>Makefile.SH</u> for actual working usage.

           Alternatively,  we might be able to use a command line option such as -R <u>$archlibexp/"CORE"</u> (Solaris)

       "vendorlibexp"
           From <u>vendorlib.U</u>:

           This variable is the <u>~name</u> expanded version of  vendorlib,  so  that  you  may  use  it  directly  in
           Makefiles or shell scripts.

       "vendorman1dir"
           From <u>vendorman1dir.U</u>:

           This  variable contains the name of the directory for man1 pages.  It may have a <u>~</u> on the front.  The
           standard distribution will put nothing in this directory.  Vendors who distribute perl  may  wish  to
           place  their  own  man1  pages  in  this directory with MakeMaker <u>Makefile.PL</u> "INSTALLDIRS"=vendor or
           equivalent.  See "INSTALL" for details.

       "vendorman1direxp"
           From <u>vendorman1dir.U</u>:

           This variable is the <u>~name</u> expanded version of vendorman1dir, so that you  may  use  it  directly  in
           Makefiles or shell scripts.

       "vendorman3dir"
           From <u>vendorman3dir.U</u>:

           This  variable contains the name of the directory for man3 pages.  It may have a <u>~</u> on the front.  The
           standard distribution will put nothing in this directory.  Vendors who distribute perl  may  wish  to
           place  their  own  man3  pages  in  this directory with MakeMaker <u>Makefile.PL</u> "INSTALLDIRS"=vendor or
           equivalent.  See "INSTALL" for details.

       "vendorman3direxp"
           From <u>vendorman3dir.U</u>:

           This variable is the <u>~name</u> expanded version of vendorman3dir, so that you  may  use  it  directly  in
           Makefiles or shell scripts.

       "vendorprefix"
           From <u>vendorprefix.U</u>:

           This  variable holds the full absolute path of the directory below which the vendor will install add-
           on packages.  See "INSTALL" for usage and examples.

       "vendorprefixexp"
           From <u>vendorprefix.U</u>:

           This variable holds the full absolute path of the directory below which the vendor will install  add-
           on packages.  Derived from vendorprefix.

       "vendorscript"
           From <u>vendorscript.U</u>:

           This  variable  contains  the  eventual  value  of the "VENDORSCRIPT" symbol.  It may have a <u>~</u> on the
           front.  The standard distribution will put nothing in this directory.  Vendors  who  distribute  perl
           may  wish  to  place  additional  executable  scripts  in  this  directory with MakeMaker <u>Makefile.PL</u>
           "INSTALLDIRS"=vendor or equivalent.  See "INSTALL" for details.

       "vendorscriptexp"
           From <u>vendorscript.U</u>:

           This variable is the <u>~name</u> expanded version of vendorscript, so that  you  may  use  it  directly  in
           Makefiles or shell scripts.

       "version"
           From <u>patchlevel.U</u>:

           The  full  version  number  of  this  package,  such  as  5.6.1  (or 5_6_1).  This combines revision,
           patchlevel, and subversion to get the full version number, including any possible subversions.   This
           is suitable for use as a directory name, and hence is filesystem dependent.

       "version_patchlevel_string"
           From <u>patchlevel.U</u>:

           This  is a string combining version, subversion and perl_patchlevel (if perl_patchlevel is non-zero).
           It is typically something like 'version 7 subversion 1'  or 'version 7 subversion 1 patchlevel 11224'
           It is computed here to avoid duplication of code in <u>myconfig.SH</u> and <u>lib/Config.pm</u>.

       "versiononly"
           From <u>versiononly.U</u>:

           If set, this symbol indicates that only the version-specific components of a perl installation should
           be installed.  This may be useful for making a test installation of a new version without  disturbing
           the existing installation.  Setting versiononly is equivalent to setting installperl's -v option.  In
           particular,  the  non-versioned  scripts and programs such as a2p, c2ph, h2xs, pod2*, and perldoc are
           not installed (see "INSTALL" for a more complete list).  Nor are the man pages  installed.   Usually,
           this is undef.

       "vi"
           From <u>Loc.U</u>:

           This variable is defined but not used by Configure.  The value is the empty string and is not useful.

   <b>x</b>
       "xlibpth"
           From <u>libpth.U</u>:

           This variable holds extra path (space-separated) used to find libraries on this platform, for example
           "CPU"-specific libraries (on multi-"CPU" platforms) may be listed here.

       "xlocale_needed"
           From <u>d_newlocale.U</u>:

           This  symbol,  if defined, indicates that the C program should include &lt;xlocale.h&gt; to get <b>newlocale()</b>
           and its friends.

   <b>y</b>
       "yacc"
           From <u>yacc.U</u>:

           This variable holds the name of the compiler compiler we want to use in the Makefile. It can be yacc,
           byacc, or bison -y.

       "yaccflags"
           From <u>yacc.U</u>:

           This variable contains any additional yacc flags desired by the user.  It is up to  the  Makefile  to
           use this.

   <b>z</b>
       "zcat"
           From <u>Loc.U</u>:

           This variable is defined but not used by Configure.  The value is the empty string and is not useful.

       "zip"
           From <u>Loc.U</u>:

           This  variable  is  used  internally  by Configure to determine the full pathname (if any) of the zip
           program.  After Configure runs, the value is reset to a plain "zip" and is not useful.

</pre><h4><b>GIT</b> <b>DATA</b></h4><pre>
       Information on the git commit from which the current perl  binary  was  compiled  can  be  found  in  the
       variable $Config::Git_Data.  The variable is a structured string that looks something like this:

         git_commit_id='ea0c2dbd5f5ac6845ecc7ec6696415bf8e27bd52'
         git_describe='GitLive-blead-1076-gea0c2db'
         git_branch='smartmatch'
         git_uncommitted_changes=''
         git_commit_id_title='Commit id:'
         git_commit_date='2009-05-09 17:47:31 +0200'

       Its format is not guaranteed not to change over time.

</pre><h4><b>NOTE</b></h4><pre>
       This  module contains a good example of how to use tie to implement a cache and an example of how to make
       a tied variable readonly to those outside of it.
