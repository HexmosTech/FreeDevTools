</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       SSL_CONF_cmd_value_type, SSL_CONF_cmd - send configuration command

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        #include &lt;openssl/ssl.h&gt;

        int SSL_CONF_cmd(SSL_CONF_CTX *ctx, const char *option, const char *value);
        int SSL_CONF_cmd_value_type(SSL_CONF_CTX *ctx, const char *option);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The function <b>SSL_CONF_cmd()</b> performs configuration operation <b>option</b> with optional parameter <b>value</b> on <b>ctx</b>.
       Its purpose is to simplify application configuration of <b>SSL_CTX</b> or <b>SSL</b> structures by providing a common
       framework for command line options or configuration files.

       <b>SSL_CONF_cmd_value_type()</b> returns the type of value that <b>option</b> refers to.

</pre><h4><b>SUPPORTED</b> <b>COMMAND</b> <b>LINE</b> <b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       Currently supported <b>option</b> names for command lines (i.e. when the flag <b>SSL_CONF_FLAG_CMDLINE</b> is set) are
       listed below. Note: all <b>option</b> names are case sensitive. Unless otherwise stated commands can be used by
       both clients and servers and the <b>value</b> parameter is not used. The default prefix for command line
       commands is <b>-</b> and that is reflected below.

       <b>-bugs</b>
           Various bug workarounds are set, same as setting <b>SSL_OP_ALL</b>.

       <b>-no_comp</b>
           Disables  support  for  SSL/TLS  compression,  same  as setting <b>SSL_OP_NO_COMPRESSION</b>.  As of OpenSSL
           1.1.0, compression is off by default.

       <b>-comp</b>
           Enables support for SSL/TLS compression, same as clearing <b>SSL_OP_NO_COMPRESSION</b>.   This  command  was
           introduced in OpenSSL 1.1.0.  As of OpenSSL 1.1.0, compression is off by default. TLS compression can
           only be used in security level 1 or lower. From OpenSSL 3.2.0 and above the default security level is
           2,   so   this   option   will  have  no  effect  without  also  changing  the  security  level.  See
           <b><a href="../man3/SSL_CTX_set_security_level.3.html">SSL_CTX_set_security_level</a></b>(3).

       <b>-no_ticket</b>
           Disables support for session tickets, same as setting <b>SSL_OP_NO_TICKET</b>.

       <b>-serverpref</b>
           Use server and not client preference order when determining which cipher suite,  signature  algorithm
           or  elliptic curve to use for an incoming connection.  Equivalent to <b>SSL_OP_CIPHER_SERVER_PREFERENCE</b>.
           Only used by servers.

       <b>-client_renegotiation</b>
           Allows   servers    to    accept    client-initiated    renegotiation.    Equivalent    to    setting
           <b>SSL_OP_ALLOW_CLIENT_RENEGOTIATION</b>.  Only used by servers.

       <b>-legacy_renegotiation</b>
           Permits     the     use     of     unsafe     legacy    renegotiation.    Equivalent    to    setting
           <b>SSL_OP_ALLOW_UNSAFE_LEGACY_RENEGOTIATION</b>.

       <b>-no_renegotiation</b>
           Disables   all   attempts   at   renegotiation   in   TLSv1.2   and   earlier,   same   as    setting
           <b>SSL_OP_NO_RENEGOTIATION</b>.

       <b>-no_resumption_on_reneg</b>
           Sets <b>SSL_OP_NO_SESSION_RESUMPTION_ON_RENEGOTIATION</b>. Only used by servers.

       <b>-legacy_server_connect</b>, <b>-no_legacy_server_connect</b>
           Permits  or  prohibits the use of unsafe legacy renegotiation for OpenSSL clients only. Equivalent to
           setting or clearing <b>SSL_OP_LEGACY_SERVER_CONNECT</b>.

       <b>-prioritize_chacha</b>
           Prioritize ChaCha ciphers when the client has a ChaCha20 cipher at the top of  its  preference  list.
           This usually indicates a client without AES hardware acceleration (e.g. mobile) is in use. Equivalent
           to <b>SSL_OP_PRIORITIZE_CHACHA</b>.  Only used by servers. Requires <b>-serverpref</b>.

       <b>-allow_no_dhe_kex</b>
           In  TLSv1.3  allow a non-(ec)dhe based key exchange mode on resumption. This means that there will be
           no forward secrecy for the resumed session.

       <b>-prefer_no_dhe_kex</b>
           In TLSv1.3, on resumption let the server prefer a non-(ec)dhe based key exchange mode over an (ec)dhe
           based one. Requires <b>-allow_no_dhe_kex</b>.  Equivalent to <b>SSL_OP_PREFER_NO_DHE_KEX</b>. Only used by servers.

       <b>-strict</b>
           Enables strict mode protocol handling. Equivalent to setting <b>SSL_CERT_FLAG_TLS_STRICT</b>.

       <b>-sigalgs</b> <u>algs</u>
           This sets the supported signature algorithms for TLSv1.2 and TLSv1.3.  For clients this value is used
           directly for the supported signature algorithms extension. For servers it is used to determine  which
           signature algorithms to support.

           The  <b>algs</b>  argument  should  be a colon separated list of signature algorithms in order of decreasing
           preference of the form <b>algorithm+hash</b> or <b>signature_scheme</b>. For the  default  providers  shipped  with
           OpenSSL,  <b>algorithm</b> is one of <b>RSA</b>, <b>DSA</b> or <b>ECDSA</b> and <b>hash</b> is a supported algorithm OID short name such
           as <b>SHA1</b>, <b>SHA224</b>, <b>SHA256</b>, <b>SHA384</b> or <b>SHA512</b>.  <b>signature_scheme</b> is one of the signature schemes  defined
           in   TLSv1.3,   specified   using   the   IETF   name,   e.g.,  <b>ecdsa_secp256r1_sha256</b>,  <b>ed25519</b>,  or
           <b>rsa_pss_pss_sha256</b>. Additional providers may make available further  algorithms  via  the  TLS-SIGALG
           capability.   Signature  scheme  names and public key algorithm names (but not the hash names) in the
           <b>algorithm+hash</b> form are case-insensitive.  See <b><a href="../man7/provider-base.7.html">provider-base</a></b>(7).

           If this option is not set then all signature algorithms supported  by  all  activated  providers  are
           permissible.

           Note:  algorithms  which specify a PKCS#1 v1.5 signature scheme (either by using <b>RSA</b> as the <b>algorithm</b>
           or by using one of the <b>rsa_pkcs1_*</b> identifiers) are ignored in TLSv1.3 and will not be negotiated.

       <b>-client_sigalgs</b> <u>algs</u>
           This sets the supported signature algorithms associated with client authentication  for  TLSv1.2  and
           TLSv1.3.   For  servers  the  <b>algs</b>  is used in the <b>signature_algorithms</b> field of a <b>CertificateRequest</b>
           message.  For clients it is used to determine which  signature  algorithm  to  use  with  the  client
           certificate.  If a server does not request a certificate this option has no effect.

           The syntax of <b>algs</b> is identical to <b>-sigalgs</b>. If not set, then the value set for <b>-sigalgs</b> will be used
           instead.

       <b>-groups</b> <u>groups</u>
           This  sets  the  supported  groups.  For  clients,  the  groups  are  sent using the supported groups
           extension. For servers, it is used to determine which group to use. This setting affects groups  used
           for signatures (in TLSv1.2 and earlier) and key exchange.

           In  its  simplest  form the <u>groups</u> argument is a colon separated list of groups.  The preferred names
           are  those  listed  in  the  IANA   TLS   Supported   Groups   &lt;https://www.iana.org/assignments/tls-
           parameters/tls-parameters.xhtml#tls-parameters-8&gt; registry.

           For  some  groups,  OpenSSL  supports  additional  aliases.  Such an alias could be a <b>NIST</b> name (e.g.
           <b>P-256</b>), an OpenSSL OID name (e.g. <b>prime256v1</b>), or some other commonly used  name.   Group  names  are
           case-insensitive  in  OpenSSL 3.5 and later.  The list should be in order of preference with the most
           preferred group first.

           The first group listed will also be used for the <b>key_share</b> sent by a client in a TLSv1.3 <b>ClientHello</b>.

           The commands below list the IANA names for TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3, respectively:

               $ openssl list -tls1_2 -tls-groups
               $ openssl list -tls1_3 -tls-groups

           The recommended groups (in order of decreasing performance) for TLS 1.3 are presently:

           <b>x25519</b>, <b>secp256r1</b>, <b>x448</b>, and <b>secp384r1</b>.

           The stronger security margins of the last two, come at a significant performance penalty.

           An enriched alternative syntax, that enables clients to send multiple keyshares and allows servers to
           prioritise some groups over others, is described in <b><a href="../man3/SSL_CTX_set1_groups_list.3.html">SSL_CTX_set1_groups_list</a></b>(3).  Since TLS  1.2  has
           neither  keyshares  nor  a  hello  retry  mechanism,  with  TLS 1.2 the enriched syntax is ultimately
           equivalent to just a simple ordered list of groups, as with the simple form above.

       <b>-curves</b> <u>groups</u>
           This is a synonym for the <b>-groups</b> command.

       <b>-named_curve</b> <u>curve</u>
           This sets the temporary curve used for ephemeral ECDH modes.  This is only applicable in TLS 1.0  and
           1.1, and should not be used with later protocol versions.

           The  <u>curve</u>  argument is a curve name or the special value <b>auto</b> which picks an appropriate curve based
           on client and server preferences. The curve can be either the <b>NIST</b> name (e.g. <b>P-256</b>)  or  an  OpenSSL
           OID  name  (e.g.  <b>prime256v1</b>).   Even  with  TLS 1.0 and 1.1, the default value of "auto" is strongly
           recommended over choosing a specific curve.  Curve names are  case-insensitive  in  OpenSSL  3.5  and
           later.

       <b>-tx_cert_comp</b>
           Enables support for sending TLSv1.3 compressed certificates.

       <b>-no_tx_cert_comp</b>
           Disables support for sending TLSv1.3 compressed certificates.

       <b>-rx_cert_comp</b>
           Enables support for receiving TLSv1.3 compressed certificates.

       <b>-no_rx_cert_comp</b>
           Disables support for receiving TLSv1.3 compressed certificates.

       <b>-comp</b>
       <b>-cipher</b> <u>ciphers</u>
           Sets  the  TLSv1.2  and  below  ciphersuite  list  to  <b>ciphers</b>.  This  list will be combined with any
           configured TLSv1.3 ciphersuites. Note: syntax checking of <b>ciphers</b> is currently not performed unless a
           <b>SSL</b> or <b>SSL_CTX</b> structure is associated with <b>ctx</b>.

       <b>-ciphersuites</b> <u>1.3ciphers</u>
           Sets the available ciphersuites for TLSv1.3 to value. This  is  a  colon-separated  list  of  TLSv1.3
           ciphersuite names in order of preference. This list will be combined any configured TLSv1.2 and below
           ciphersuites.  See <b><a href="../man1/openssl-ciphers.1.html">openssl-ciphers</a></b>(1) for more information.

       <b>-min_protocol</b> <u>minprot</u>, <b>-max_protocol</b> <u>maxprot</u>
           Sets  the  minimum  and  maximum  supported protocol.  Currently supported protocol values are <b>SSLv3</b>,
           <b>TLSv1</b>, <b>TLSv1.1</b>, <b>TLSv1.2</b>, <b>TLSv1.3</b> for TLS; <b>DTLSv1</b>, <b>DTLSv1.2</b> for DTLS,  and  <b>None</b>  for  no  limit.   If
           either the lower or upper bound is not specified then only the other bound applies, if specified.  If
           your  application  supports both TLS and DTLS you can specify any of these options twice, once with a
           bound for TLS and again with an appropriate bound for  DTLS.   To  restrict  the  supported  protocol
           versions use these commands rather than the deprecated alternative commands below.

       <b>-record_padding</b> <u>padding</u>
           Controls  use  of  TLSv1.3  record  layer padding.  <b>padding</b> is a string of the form "number[,number]"
           where the (required) first number is the padding block size (in octets) for application data, and the
           optional second number is the padding block size for handshake and alert messages.  If  the  optional
           second number is omitted, the same padding will be applied to all messages.

           Padding  attempts  to  pad  TLSv1.3  records so that they are a multiple of the set length on send. A
           value of 0 or 1 turns off padding as relevant. Otherwise, the values must be &gt;1 or &lt;=16384.

       <b>-debug_broken_protocol</b>
           Ignored.

       <b>-no_middlebox</b>
           Turn off "middlebox compatibility", as described below.

   <b>Additional</b> <b>Options</b>
       The following options are accepted by <b>SSL_CONF_cmd()</b>, but are not processed by the OpenSSL commands.

       <b>-cert</b> <u>file</u>
           Attempts  to  use  <b>file</b>  as  the  certificate  for  the  appropriate  context.  It   currently   uses
           <b>SSL_CTX_use_certificate_chain_file()</b>  if  an  <b>SSL_CTX</b>  structure is set or <b>SSL_use_certificate_file()</b>
           with filetype PEM if an <b>SSL</b> structure is set. This option is only supported if certificate operations
           are permitted.

       <b>-key</b> <u>file</u>
           Attempts to use <b>file</b> as the private key for the appropriate context. This option is only supported if
           certificate operations are permitted. Note: if no <b>-key</b> option is set then a private key is not loaded
           unless the flag <b>SSL_CONF_FLAG_REQUIRE_PRIVATE</b> is set.

       <b>-dhparam</b> <u>file</u>
           Attempts to use <b>file</b> as the set of temporary DH parameters for the appropriate context.  This  option
           is only supported if certificate operations are permitted.

       <b>-no_ssl3</b>, <b>-no_tls1</b>, <b>-no_tls1_1</b>, <b>-no_tls1_2</b>, <b>-no_tls1_3</b>
           Disables   protocol  support  for  SSLv3,  TLSv1.0,  TLSv1.1,  TLSv1.2  or  TLSv1.3  by  setting  the
           corresponding options  <b>SSL_OP_NO_SSLv3</b>,  <b>SSL_OP_NO_TLSv1</b>,  <b>SSL_OP_NO_TLSv1_1</b>,  <b>SSL_OP_NO_TLSv1_2</b>  and
           <b>SSL_OP_NO_TLSv1_3</b>  respectively.  These  options  are deprecated, use <b>-min_protocol</b> and <b>-max_protocol</b>
           instead.

       <b>-anti_replay</b>, <b>-no_anti_replay</b>
           Switches replay protection,  on  or  off  respectively.  With  replay  protection  on,  OpenSSL  will
           automatically  detect  if a session ticket has been used more than once, TLSv1.3 has been negotiated,
           and early data is enabled on the server. A full handshake is forced if a session  ticket  is  used  a
           second or subsequent time. Anti-Replay is on by default unless overridden by a configuration file and
           is  only  used  by  servers.  Anti-replay  measures  are  required  for  compliance  with the TLSv1.3
           specification. Some applications may be able to mitigate the replay risks in other ways and  in  such
           cases  the built-in OpenSSL functionality is not required. Switching off anti-replay is equivalent to
           <b>SSL_OP_NO_ANTI_REPLAY</b>.

</pre><h4><b>SUPPORTED</b> <b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>FILE</b> <b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       Currently supported <b>option</b> names for configuration files (i.e., when the flag <b>SSL_CONF_FLAG_FILE</b> is  set)
       are  listed  below.  All  configuration  file <b>option</b> names are case insensitive so <b>signaturealgorithms</b> is
       recognised as well as <b>SignatureAlgorithms</b>.  Unless  otherwise  stated  the  <b>value</b>  names  are  also  case
       insensitive.

       Note: the command prefix (if set) alters the recognised <b>option</b> values.

       <b>CipherString</b>
           Sets  the  ciphersuite  list  for  TLSv1.2  and  below  to <b>value</b>. This list will be combined with any
           configured TLSv1.3 ciphersuites. Note: syntax checking of <b>value</b> is currently not performed unless  an
           <b>SSL</b> or <b>SSL_CTX</b> structure is associated with <b>ctx</b>.

       <b>Ciphersuites</b>
           Sets  the  available  ciphersuites  for  TLSv1.3  to <b>value</b>. This is a colon-separated list of TLSv1.3
           ciphersuite names in order of preference. This list will be combined any configured TLSv1.2 and below
           ciphersuites.  See <b><a href="../man1/openssl-ciphers.1.html">openssl-ciphers</a></b>(1) for more information.

       <b>Certificate</b>
           Attempts to use the file <b>value</b> as the certificate for the  appropriate  context.  It  currently  uses
           <b>SSL_CTX_use_certificate_chain_file()</b>  if  an  <b>SSL_CTX</b>  structure is set or <b>SSL_use_certificate_file()</b>
           with filetype PEM if an <b>SSL</b> structure is set. This option is only supported if certificate operations
           are permitted.

       <b>PrivateKey</b>
           Attempts to use the file <b>value</b> as the private key for the appropriate context. This  option  is  only
           supported  if  certificate  operations  are  permitted.  Note:  if no <b>PrivateKey</b> option is set then a
           private key is not loaded unless the <b>SSL_CONF_FLAG_REQUIRE_PRIVATE</b> is set.

       <b>ChainCAFile</b>, <b>ChainCAPath</b>, <b>VerifyCAFile</b>, <b>VerifyCAPath</b>
           These options indicate a file  or  directory  used  for  building  certificate  chains  or  verifying
           certificate chains. These options are only supported if certificate operations are permitted.

       <b>RequestCAFile</b>
           This  option indicates a file containing a set of certificates in PEM form.  The subject names of the
           certificates are sent  to  the  peer  in  the  <b>certificate_authorities</b>  extension  for  TLS  1.3  (in
           ClientHello or CertificateRequest) or in a certificate request for previous versions or TLS.

       <b>ServerInfoFile</b>
           Attempts   to   use   the   file   <b>value</b>   in   the   "serverinfo"   extension   using  the  function
           SSL_CTX_use_serverinfo_file.

       <b>DHParameters</b>
           Attempts to use the file <b>value</b> as the set of temporary DH parameters  for  the  appropriate  context.
           This option is only supported if certificate operations are permitted.

       <b>RecordPadding</b>
           Controls  use of TLSv1.3 record layer padding.  <b>value</b> is a string of the form "number[,number]" where
           the (required) first number is the padding block size (in  octets)  for  application  data,  and  the
           optional  second  number is the padding block size for handshake and alert messages.  If the optional
           second number is omitted, the same padding will be applied to all messages.

           Padding attempts to pad TLSv1.3 records so that they are a multiple of the  set  length  on  send.  A
           value of 0 or 1 turns off padding as relevant. Otherwise, the values must be &gt;1 or &lt;=16384.

       <b>SignatureAlgorithms</b>
           This sets the supported signature algorithms for TLSv1.2 and TLSv1.3.  For clients this value is used
           directly  for the supported signature algorithms extension. For servers it is used to determine which
           signature algorithms to support.

           The <b>value</b> argument should be a colon separated list of signature algorithms in  order  of  decreasing
           preference  of  the  form  <b>algorithm+hash</b> or <b>signature_scheme</b>. For the default providers shipped with
           OpenSSL, <b>algorithm</b> is one of <b>RSA</b>, <b>DSA</b> or <b>ECDSA</b> and <b>hash</b> is a supported algorithm OID short name  such
           as  <b>SHA1</b>, <b>SHA224</b>, <b>SHA256</b>, <b>SHA384</b> or <b>SHA512</b>.  <b>signature_scheme</b> is one of the signature schemes defined
           in  TLSv1.3,  specified  using   the   IANA   name,   e.g.,   <b>ecdsa_secp256r1_sha256</b>,   <b>ed25519</b>,   or
           <b>rsa_pss_pss_sha256</b>.   Signature  scheme names and public key algorithm names (but not the hash names)
           in the <b>algorithm+hash</b> form are case-insensitive.  Additional providers  may  make  available  further
           signature schemes via the TLS_SIGALG capability. See "CAPABILITIES" in <b><a href="../man7/provider-base.7.html">provider-base</a></b>(7).

           If  this  option  is  not  set then all signature algorithms supported by all activated providers are
           permissible.

           Note: algorithms which specify a PKCS#1 v1.5 signature scheme (either by using <b>RSA</b> as  the  <b>algorithm</b>
           or by using one of the <b>rsa_pkcs1_*</b> identifiers) are ignored in TLSv1.3 and will not be negotiated.

       <b>ClientSignatureAlgorithms</b>
           This  sets  the  supported signature algorithms associated with client authentication for TLSv1.2 and
           TLSv1.3.  For servers the value is used in the <b>signature_algorithms</b>  field  of  a  <b>CertificateRequest</b>
           message.   For  clients  it  is  used  to  determine which signature algorithm to use with the client
           certificate.  If a server does not request a certificate this option has no effect.

           The syntax of <b>value</b> is  identical  to  <b>SignatureAlgorithms</b>.  If  not  set  then  the  value  set  for
           <b>SignatureAlgorithms</b> will be used instead.

       <b>Groups</b>
           This  sets  the  supported  groups.  For  clients,  the  groups  are  sent using the supported groups
           extension. For servers, it is used to determine which group to use. This setting affects groups  used
           for  signatures  (in  TLSv1.2 and earlier) and key exchange. The first group listed will also be used
           for the <b>key_share</b> sent by a client in a TLSv1.3 <b>ClientHello</b>.

           The <b>groups</b> argument is a colon separated list of groups.  The preferred names are those listed in the
           IANA TLS Supported Groups  &lt;https://www.iana.org/assignments/tls-parameters/tls-parameters.xhtml#tls-
           parameters-8&gt;  registry.   For some groups, OpenSSL supports additional aliases.  Such an alias could
           be a <b>NIST</b> name (e.g. <b>P-256</b>), an OpenSSL OID name (e.g. <b>prime256v1</b>), or some other commonly used name.
           Group names are case-insensitive in OpenSSL 3.5 and later.  The list should be in order of preference
           with the most preferred group first.

           The commands below list the available groups for TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3, respectively:

               $ openssl list -tls1_2 -tls-groups
               $ openssl list -tls1_3 -tls-groups

           An enriched alternative syntax, that enables clients to send multiple keyshares and allows servers to
           prioritise some groups over others, is described in <b><a href="../man3/SSL_CTX_set1_groups_list.3.html">SSL_CTX_set1_groups_list</a></b>(3).  Since TLS  1.2  has
           neither  keyshares  nor  a  hello  retry  mechanism,  with  TLS 1.2 the enriched syntax is ultimately
           equivalent to just a simple ordered list of groups, as with the simple form above.

       <b>Curves</b>
           This is a synonym for the "Groups" command.

       <b>MinProtocol</b>
           This sets the minimum supported SSL, TLS or DTLS version.

           Currently supported protocol values are <b>SSLv3</b>, <b>TLSv1</b>, <b>TLSv1.1</b>, <b>TLSv1.2</b>, <b>TLSv1.3</b>, <b>DTLSv1</b> and <b>DTLSv1.2</b>.
           The SSL and TLS bounds apply only to TLS-based contexts, while the DTLS bounds apply  only  to  DTLS-
           based  contexts.   The  command  can be repeated with one instance setting a TLS bound, and the other
           setting a DTLS bound.  The value <b>None</b> applies to both types of contexts and disables the limits.

       <b>MaxProtocol</b>
           This sets the maximum supported SSL, TLS or DTLS version.

           Currently supported protocol values are <b>SSLv3</b>, <b>TLSv1</b>, <b>TLSv1.1</b>, <b>TLSv1.2</b>, <b>TLSv1.3</b>, <b>DTLSv1</b> and <b>DTLSv1.2</b>.
           The SSL and TLS bounds apply only to TLS-based contexts, while the DTLS bounds apply  only  to  DTLS-
           based  contexts.   The  command  can be repeated with one instance setting a TLS bound, and the other
           setting a DTLS bound.  The value <b>None</b> applies to both types of contexts and disables the limits.

       <b>Protocol</b>
           This can be used to enable or disable certain versions of the SSL, TLS or DTLS protocol.

           The <b>value</b> argument is a comma separated list of supported protocols  to  enable  or  disable.   If  a
           protocol is preceded by <b>-</b> that version is disabled.

           All  protocol versions are enabled by default.  You need to disable at least one protocol version for
           this setting have any effect.  Only enabling some  protocol  versions  does  not  disable  the  other
           protocol versions.

           Currently supported protocol values are <b>SSLv3</b>, <b>TLSv1</b>, <b>TLSv1.1</b>, <b>TLSv1.2</b>, <b>TLSv1.3</b>, <b>DTLSv1</b> and <b>DTLSv1.2</b>.
           The special value <b>ALL</b> refers to all supported versions.

           This  can't  enable  protocols  that  are  disabled using <b>MinProtocol</b> or <b>MaxProtocol</b>, but can disable
           protocols that are still allowed by them.

           The <b>Protocol</b> command is fragile and deprecated; do not  use  it.   Use  <b>MinProtocol</b>  and  <b>MaxProtocol</b>
           instead.   If  you  do  use  <b>Protocol</b>, make sure that the resulting range of enabled protocols has no
           "holes", e.g. if TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.2 are both enabled, make sure to also leave TLS 1.1 enabled.

       <b>Options</b>
           The <b>value</b> argument is a comma separated list of various flags to set.  If a flag string is preceded <b>-</b>
           it is disabled.  See the <b><a href="../man3/SSL_CTX_set_options.3.html">SSL_CTX_set_options</a></b>(3) function for more details of individual options.

           Each option is listed below. Where an operation is enabled by default the <b>-flag</b> syntax is  needed  to
           disable it.

           <b>SessionTicket</b>:  session  ticket  support,  enabled  by  default. Inverse of <b>SSL_OP_NO_TICKET</b>: that is
           <b>-SessionTicket</b> is the same as setting <b>SSL_OP_NO_TICKET</b>.

           <b>Compression</b>: SSL/TLS compression support, disabled by default. Inverse of <b>SSL_OP_NO_COMPRESSION</b>.

           <b>EmptyFragments</b>: use  empty  fragments  as  a  countermeasure  against  a  SSL  3.0/TLS  1.0  protocol
           vulnerability     affecting     CBC    ciphers.    It    is    set    by    default.    Inverse    of
           <b>SSL_OP_DONT_INSERT_EMPTY_FRAGMENTS</b>.

           <b>Bugs</b>: enable various bug workarounds. Same as <b>SSL_OP_ALL</b>.

           <b>DHSingle</b>: enable single use DH keys, set by  default.  Inverse  of  <b>SSL_OP_DH_SINGLE</b>.  Only  used  by
           servers.

           <b>ECDHSingle</b>:  enable single use ECDH keys, set by default. Inverse of <b>SSL_OP_ECDH_SINGLE</b>. Only used by
           servers.

           <b>ServerPreference</b>: use server and not client preference order when  determining  which  cipher  suite,
           signature   algorithm   or  elliptic  curve  to  use  for  an  incoming  connection.   Equivalent  to
           <b>SSL_OP_CIPHER_SERVER_PREFERENCE</b>. Only used by servers.

           <b>PrioritizeChaCha</b>: prioritizes ChaCha ciphers when the client has a ChaCha20 cipher at the top of  its
           preference   list.   This   usually   indicates   a   mobile   client   is   in  use.  Equivalent  to
           <b>SSL_OP_PRIORITIZE_CHACHA</b>.  Only used by servers.

           <b>NoResumptionOnRenegotiation</b>: set <b>SSL_OP_NO_SESSION_RESUMPTION_ON_RENEGOTIATION</b>  flag.  Only  used  by
           servers.

           <b>NoRenegotiation</b>:  disables  all  attempts  at  renegotiation  in TLSv1.2 and earlier, same as setting
           <b>SSL_OP_NO_RENEGOTIATION</b>.

           <b>UnsafeLegacyRenegotiation</b>:  permits  the  use  of  unsafe  legacy   renegotiation.    Equivalent   to
           <b>SSL_OP_ALLOW_UNSAFE_LEGACY_RENEGOTIATION</b>.

           <b>UnsafeLegacyServerConnect</b>:  permits  the use of unsafe legacy renegotiation for OpenSSL clients only.
           Equivalent to <b>SSL_OP_LEGACY_SERVER_CONNECT</b>.

           <b>EncryptThenMac</b>:   use    encrypt-then-mac    extension,    enabled    by    default.    Inverse    of
           <b>SSL_OP_NO_ENCRYPT_THEN_MAC</b>:     that     is,    <b>-EncryptThenMac</b>    is    the    same    as    setting
           <b>SSL_OP_NO_ENCRYPT_THEN_MAC</b>.

           <b>AllowNoDHEKEX</b>: In TLSv1.3 allow a non-(ec)dhe based key exchange mode on resumption. This means  that
           there will be no forward secrecy for the resumed session. Equivalent to <b>SSL_OP_ALLOW_NO_DHE_KEX</b>.

           <b>PreferNoDHEKEX</b>: In TLSv1.3, on resumption let the server prefer a non-(ec)dhe based key exchange mode
           over  an (ec)dhe based one. Requires <b>AllowNoDHEKEX</b>. Equivalent to <b>SSL_OP_PREFER_NO_DHE_KEX</b>. Only used
           by servers.

           <b>MiddleboxCompat</b>: If set then dummy Change Cipher Spec (CCS) messages are sent in  TLSv1.3.  This  has
           the  effect  of  making  TLSv1.3  look  more  like TLSv1.2 so that middleboxes that do not understand
           TLSv1.3 will not drop the connection. This option is set by default. A future version of OpenSSL  may
           not set this by default. Equivalent to <b>SSL_OP_ENABLE_MIDDLEBOX_COMPAT</b>.

           <b>AntiReplay</b>: If set then OpenSSL will automatically detect if a session ticket has been used more than
           once,  TLSv1.3  has  been  negotiated,  and  early data is enabled on the server. A full handshake is
           forced if a session ticket is used a second or subsequent time. This option is set by default and  is
           only  used  by  servers.  Anti-replay measures are required to comply with the TLSv1.3 specification.
           Some applications may be able to mitigate the replay risks in other ways and in such cases the built-
           in  OpenSSL  functionality  is  not  required.   Disabling  anti-replay  is  equivalent  to   setting
           <b>SSL_OP_NO_ANTI_REPLAY</b>.

           <b>ExtendedMasterSecret</b>:   use  extended  master  secret  extension,  enabled  by  default.  Inverse  of
           <b>SSL_OP_NO_EXTENDED_MASTER_SECRET</b>:  that  is,   <b>-ExtendedMasterSecret</b>   is   the   same   as   setting
           <b>SSL_OP_NO_EXTENDED_MASTER_SECRET</b>.

           <b>CANames</b>:  use CA names extension, enabled by default. Inverse of <b>SSL_OP_DISABLE_TLSEXT_CA_NAMES</b>: that
           is, <b>-CANames</b> is the same as setting <b>SSL_OP_DISABLE_TLSEXT_CA_NAMES</b>.

           <b>KTLS</b>: Enables kernel TLS if support has been compiled in, and  it  is  supported  by  the  negotiated
           ciphersuites and extensions. Equivalent to <b>SSL_OP_ENABLE_KTLS</b>.

           <b>StrictCertCheck</b>:  Enable  strict certificate checking. Equivalent to setting <b>SSL_CERT_FLAG_TLS_STRICT</b>
           with <b>SSL_CTX_set_cert_flags()</b>.

           <b>TxCertificateCompression</b>: support sending compressed certificates, enabled  by  default.  Inverse  of
           <b>SSL_OP_NO_TX_CERTIFICATE_COMPRESSION</b>:  that  is,  <b>-TxCertificateCompression</b>  is  the  same as setting
           <b>SSL_OP_NO_TX_CERTIFICATE_COMPRESSION</b>.

           <b>RxCertificateCompression</b>: support receiving compressed certificates, enabled by default.  Inverse  of
           <b>SSL_OP_NO_RX_CERTIFICATE_COMPRESSION</b>:  that  is,  <b>-RxCertificateCompression</b>  is  the  same as setting
           <b>SSL_OP_NO_RX_CERTIFICATE_COMPRESSION</b>.

           <b>KTLSTxZerocopySendfile</b>: use the zerocopy TX mode of <b>sendfile()</b>, which gives a performance boost  when
           used  with  KTLS  hardware offload. Note that invalid TLS records might be transmitted if the file is
           changed while being sent.  This  option  has  no  effect  if  <b>KTLS</b>  is  not  enabled.  Equivalent  to
           <b>SSL_OP_ENABLE_KTLS_TX_ZEROCOPY_SENDFILE</b>. This option only applies to Linux.  KTLS sendfile on FreeBSD
           doesn't offer an option to disable zerocopy and always runs in this mode.

           <b>IgnoreUnexpectedEOF</b>:  Equivalent to <b>SSL_OP_IGNORE_UNEXPECTED_EOF</b>.  You should only enable this option
           if the protocol running over TLS can detect a truncation attack itself, and that the  application  is
           checking for that truncation attack.

       <b>VerifyMode</b>
           The <b>value</b> argument is a comma separated list of flags to set.

           <b>Peer</b> enables peer verification: for clients only.

           <b>Request</b> requests but does not require a certificate from the client.  Servers only.

           <b>Require</b>  requests  and requires a certificate from the client: an error occurs if the client does not
           present a certificate. Servers only.

           <b>Once</b> requests a certificate from a client only on the initial  connection:  not  when  renegotiating.
           Servers only.

           <b>RequestPostHandshake</b> configures the connection to support requests but does not require a certificate
           from the client post-handshake. A certificate will not be requested during the initial handshake. The
           server  application  must  provide a mechanism to request a certificate post-handshake. Servers only.
           TLSv1.3 only.

           <b>RequiresPostHandshake</b> configures the connection to support requests and requires a  certificate  from
           the  client  post-handshake:  an  error  occurs  if  the  client  does  not  present a certificate. A
           certificate will not be requested during the initial handshake. The server application must provide a
           mechanism to request a certificate post-handshake. Servers only. TLSv1.3 only.

       <b>ClientCAFile</b>, <b>ClientCAPath</b>
           A file or directory of certificates in PEM format whose names are used as the set of acceptable names
           for client CAs. Servers only. This option is only supported if certificate operations are permitted.

</pre><h4><b>SUPPORTED</b> <b>COMMAND</b> <b>TYPES</b></h4><pre>
       The function <b>SSL_CONF_cmd_value_type()</b> currently returns one of the following types:

       <b>SSL_CONF_TYPE_UNKNOWN</b>
           The <b>option</b> string is unrecognised, this return value can be use to flag syntax errors.

       <b>SSL_CONF_TYPE_STRING</b>
           The value is a string without any specific structure.

       <b>SSL_CONF_TYPE_FILE</b>
           The value is a filename.

       <b>SSL_CONF_TYPE_DIR</b>
           The value is a directory name.

       <b>SSL_CONF_TYPE_NONE</b>
           The value string is not used e.g. a command line option which doesn't take an argument.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       The order of operations is significant. This can be used to set either defaults or values which cannot be
       overridden. For example if an application calls:

        SSL_CONF_cmd(ctx, "Protocol", "-SSLv3");
        SSL_CONF_cmd(ctx, userparam, uservalue);

       it will disable SSLv3 support by default but the user can override it. If however the call sequence is:

        SSL_CONF_cmd(ctx, userparam, uservalue);
        SSL_CONF_cmd(ctx, "Protocol", "-SSLv3");

       SSLv3 is <b>always</b> disabled and attempt to override this by the user are ignored.

       By checking the return code of <b>SSL_CONF_cmd()</b> it is possible to query if a given  <b>option</b>  is  recognised,
       this is useful if <b>SSL_CONF_cmd()</b> values are mixed with additional application specific operations.

       For example an application might call <b>SSL_CONF_cmd()</b> and if it returns -2 (unrecognised command) continue
       with processing of application specific commands.

       Applications  can  also  use  <b>SSL_CONF_cmd()</b>  to  process  command  lines  though  the  utility  function
       <b>SSL_CONF_cmd_argv()</b> is normally used instead. One way to do this is to set the prefix to  an  appropriate
       value using <b>SSL_CONF_CTX_set1_prefix()</b>, pass the current argument to <b>option</b> and the following argument to
       <b>value</b> (which may be NULL).

       In  this  case  if  the return value is positive then it is used to skip that number of arguments as they
       have been processed by <b>SSL_CONF_cmd()</b>. If -2 is returned then <b>option</b> is not  recognised  and  application
       specific  arguments can be checked instead. If -3 is returned a required argument is missing and an error
       is indicated. If 0 is returned some other error occurred and this can be reported back to the user.

       The function <b>SSL_CONF_cmd_value_type()</b> can be used by applications  to  check  for  the  existence  of  a
       command  or to perform additional syntax checking or translation of the command value. For example if the
       return value is <b>SSL_CONF_TYPE_FILE</b> an application could translate a  relative  pathname  to  an  absolute
       pathname.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>SSL_CONF_cmd()</b>  returns 1 if the value of <b>option</b> is recognised and <b>value</b> is <b>NOT</b> used and 2 if both <b>option</b>
       and <b>value</b> are used. In other words it returns the number of arguments  processed.  This  is  useful  when
       processing command lines.

       A return value of -2 means <b>option</b> is not recognised.

       A return value of -3 means <b>option</b> is recognised and the command requires a value but <b>value</b> is NULL.

       A  return  code  of  0 indicates that both <b>option</b> and <b>value</b> are valid but an error occurred attempting to
       perform the operation: for example due to an error in the syntax of <b>value</b> in this case  the  error  queue
       may provide additional information.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Set supported signature algorithms:

        SSL_CONF_cmd(ctx, "SignatureAlgorithms", "ECDSA+SHA256:RSA+SHA256:DSA+SHA256");

       There are various ways to select the supported protocols.

       This  set  the  minimum protocol version to TLSv1, and so disables SSLv3.  This is the recommended way to
       disable protocols.

        SSL_CONF_cmd(ctx, "MinProtocol", "TLSv1");

       The following also disables SSLv3:

        SSL_CONF_cmd(ctx, "Protocol", "-SSLv3");

       The following will first enable all protocols, and then disable SSLv3.   If  no  protocol  versions  were
       disabled  before  this  has the same effect as "-SSLv3", but if some versions were disables this will re-
       enable them before disabling SSLv3.

        SSL_CONF_cmd(ctx, "Protocol", "ALL,-SSLv3");

       Only enable TLSv1.2:

        SSL_CONF_cmd(ctx, "MinProtocol", "TLSv1.2");
        SSL_CONF_cmd(ctx, "MaxProtocol", "TLSv1.2");

       This also only enables TLSv1.2:

        SSL_CONF_cmd(ctx, "Protocol", "-ALL,TLSv1.2");

       Disable TLS session tickets:

        SSL_CONF_cmd(ctx, "Options", "-SessionTicket");

       Enable compression:

        SSL_CONF_cmd(ctx, "Options", "Compression");

       Set supported curves to P-256, P-384:

        SSL_CONF_cmd(ctx, "Curves", "P-256:P-384");

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>SSL_CONF_cmd()</b> function was added in OpenSSL 1.0.2.

       The  <b>SSL_OP_NO_SSL2</b>  option  doesn't  have  effect  since  1.1.0, but the macro is retained for backwards
       compatibility.

       The <b>SSL_CONF_TYPE_NONE</b> was added in OpenSSL 1.1.0. In earlier versions of OpenSSL passing a command which
       didn't take an argument would return <b>SSL_CONF_TYPE_UNKNOWN</b>.

       <b>MinProtocol</b> and <b>MaxProtocol</b> where added in OpenSSL 1.1.0.

       <b>AllowNoDHEKEX</b> and <b>PrioritizeChaCha</b> were added in OpenSSL 1.1.1.

       The <b>UnsafeLegacyServerConnect</b> option is no longer set by default from OpenSSL 3.0.

       The <b>TxCertificateCompression</b> and <b>RxCertificateCompression</b> options were added in OpenSSL 3.2.

       <b>PreferNoDHEKEX</b> was added in OpenSSL 3.3.

       OpenSSL 3.5 introduces support for post-quantum (PQ) TLS key exchange  via  the  <b>MLKEM512</b>,  <b>MLKEM768</b>  and
       <b>MLKEM1024</b>  TLS  groups.   These  are  based  on  the  underlying  <b>ML-KEM-512</b>,  <b>ML-KEM-768</b> and <b>ML-KEM-1024</b>
       algorithms from FIPS 203.

       OpenSSL 3.5 also introduces support for three <b>hybrid</b> ECDH PQ key  exchange  TLS  groups:  <b>X25519MLKEM768</b>,
       <b>SecP256r1MLKEM768</b>  and  <b>SecP384r1MLKEM1024</b>.  They offer CPU performance comparable to the associated ECDH
       group,  though  at  the  cost  of  significantly  larger  key  exchange  messages.   The   third   group,
       <b>SecP384r1MLKEM1024</b>  is substantially more CPU-intensive, largely as a result of the high CPU cost of ECDH
       for the underlying <b>P-384</b> group.  Also its key exchange messages at close to 1700 bytes  are  larger  than
       the roughly 1200 bytes for the first two groups.

       As of OpenSSL 3.5 key exchange group names are case-insensitive.
