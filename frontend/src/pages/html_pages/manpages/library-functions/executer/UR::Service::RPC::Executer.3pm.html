</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       UR::Service::RPC::Executer - Base class for modules implementing RPC executers

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This class is an abstract base class used to implement RPC executers.  That is, modules meant to have
       their methods called from another process, and have the results passed back to the original caller.  The
       communication happens over a read-write filehandle such as a socket by passing UR::Service::RPC::Message
       objects back and forth.

       Executors are subordinate to a UR::Service::RPC::Server object which handles decoding the message passed
       over the socket, calling the method on the correct executor in the right context, and returning the
       result back through the file handle.

</pre><h4><b>PROPERTIES</b></h4><pre>
       fh =&gt; IO::Handle
           File handle messages are received on and responses are sent to

       use_sigio =&gt; Boolean
           If  true,  the Server will set up a callback on the IO signal to handle execution, so the Server does
           not need to block in <b>loop()</b>.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       authenticate
             $bool = $exec-&gt;authenticate($msg);

           This is called by <b>execute()</b> after the message  object  is  deserialized  from  the  filehandle.   The
           default   implementation   just   returns   true.   Subclasses  can  override  this  to  examine  the
           UR::Service::RPC::Message object and return  true  or  fale  whether  it  should  allow  or  disallow
           execution.   If  authentication  fails, the Executor should modify the Message object in-place with a
           proper return value and exception.

       execute
             $exec-&gt;execute();

           Called when the Server detects data is available to read on its file  handle.   It  deserializes  the
           message  and  calls  authenticate.  If authentication fails, it immediately passes the message object
           back to the caller.

           If authentication succeeds, it calls the appropriate method in the Executor package,  and  creates  a
           new Message object with the return value to pass back to the caller.

       close_connection
             $exec-&gt;close_connection();

           Called by <b>execute()</b> when it detects that the file handle has closed.

       Derived classes should define additional methods that then become callable by <b>execute()</b>.
