</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Log::Trace - provides a unified approach to tracing

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
               # The tracing targets
               use Log::Trace; # No output
               use Log::Trace 'print'; # print to STDOUT
               use Log::Trace log =&gt; '/var/log/foo.log'; # Output to log file
               use Log::Trace print =&gt; { Level =&gt; 3 };

               # Switch on/off logging with a constant
               use Log::Trace;
               import Log::Trace ('log' =&gt; LOGFILE) if TRACING;

               # Set up tracing for all packages that advertise TRACE
               use Foo;
               use Bar;
               use Log::Trace warn =&gt; { Deep =&gt; 1 };

               # Sets up tracing in all subpackages excluding Foo
               use Log::Trace warn =&gt; {Deep =&gt; 1, 'Exclude' =&gt; 'Foo'};

               # Exported functions
               TRACE("Record this...");
               TRACE({Level =&gt; 2}, "Only shown if tracing level is 2 or higher");
               TRACEF("A la printf: %d-%.2f", 1, 2.9999);
               TRACE_HERE();           # Record where we are (file, line, sub, args)
               DUMP(\@loh, \%hoh);     # Trace out via Data::Dumper
               DUMP("Title", \@loh);   # Trace out via Data::Dumper
               my $dump = DUMP(@args); # Dump is returned without being traced

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       A module to provide a unified approach to tracing. A script can "use Log::Trace qw( &lt; mode &gt; )" to set
       the behaviour of the TRACE function.

       By default, the trace functions are exported to the calling package only. You can export the trace
       functions to other packages with the "Deep" option. See "OPTIONS" for more information.

       All exports are in uppercase (to minimise collisions with "real" functions).

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       TRACE(@args)
           Output  a  message.  Where  the  message  actually  goes  depends on how you imported Log::Trace (See
           "enabling Log::Trace"" in "Importing)

           The first argument is an optional hashref of options:

                   TRACE('A simple message');

           vs:

                   TRACE({ Level =&gt; 2.1 }, 'A message at a specified trace level');

       TRACEF($format, @args)
           "printf()" equivalent of TRACE. Also accepts an optional hashref:

                   TRACEF('%d items', scalar @items);
                   TRACEF({ Level =&gt; 5 }, '$%1.2d', $value);

       DUMP([$message,] @args)
           Serialises each of @args, optionally prepended with $message. If called in a non-void  context,  DUMP
           will  return  the  serialised  data  rather  than  TRACE  it.  This  is  useful if you want to DUMP a
           datastructure at a specific tracing level.

                   DUMP('colours', [qw(red green blue)]);             # outputs via TRACE
                   my $dump = DUMP('colours', [qw(red green blue)]);  # output returned

       <b>TRACE_HERE()</b>
           TRACEs the current position on the call stack (file, line number, subroutine name, subroutine args).

                   TRACE_HERE();
                   TRACE_HERE({Level =&gt; 99});

</pre><h4><b>Importing/enabling</b> <b>Log::Trace</b></h4><pre>
       import($target, [$arg], [\%params])
           Controls  where  TRACE  messages  go.  This  method  is  called  automatically  when  you  call  'use
           Log::Trace;', but you may explicitly call this method at runtime. Compare the following:

                   use Log::Trace 'print';

           which is the same as

                   BEGIN {
                           require Log::Trace;
                           Log::Trace-&gt;import('print');
                   }

           Valid combinations of $target and "arg" are:

           print =&gt; $filehandle
               Prints  trace  messages  to  the  supplied $filehandle. Defaults to "STDOUT" if no file handle is
               specified.

           warn
               Prints trace messages via "warn()"s to "STDERR".

           buffer =&gt; \$buffer
               Appends trace messages to a string reference.

           file =&gt; $filename
               Append trace messages to a file. If the file doesn't exist, it will be created.

           log =&gt; $filename
               This is equivalent to:

                       use Log::Trace file =&gt; $filename, {Verbose =&gt; 2};

           syslog =&gt; $priority
               Logs trace messages to syslog via "Sys::Syslog", if available.

               You should consult your syslog configuration before using this option.

               The default $priority is '"debug"', and the "ident" is set to "Log::Trace". You can configure the
               "priority", but beyond that, you can implement your own syslogging via the "custom" trace target.

           custom =&gt; \&amp;custom_trace_sub
               Trace messages are processed by a custom subroutine. E.g.

                       use Log::Trace custom =&gt; \&amp;mylogger;

                       sub mylogger {
                               my @messages = @_;
                               foreach (@messages) {
                                       # highly sensitive trace messages!
                                       tr/a-zA-Z/n-za-mN-ZA-M/;
                                       print;
                               }
                       }

           The import "\%params" are optional. These two statements are functionally the same:

                   import Log::Trace print =&gt; {Level =&gt; undef};
                   import Log::Trace 'print';

           See "OPTIONS" for more information.

           <b>Note:</b> If you use the "custom" tracing option, you should be  careful  about  supplying  a  subroutine
           named "TRACE".

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       AllSubs =&gt; BOOL
           Attaches  a  "TRACE"  statement  to  all  subroutines  in  the package. This can be used to track the
           execution path of your code. It is particularly useful when  used  in  conjunction  with  "Deep"  and
           "Everywhere" options.

           <b>Note:</b> Anonymous subroutines and "AUTOLOAD" are not "TRACE"d.

       AutoImport =&gt; BOOL
           By  default, "Log::Trace" will only set up "TRACE" routines in modules that have already been loaded.
           This option overrides "require()" so that modules loaded after "Log::Trace" can automatically be  set
           up for tracing.

           <b>Note</b>:  This  is  an  experimental  feature. See the ENVIRONMENT NOTES for information about behaviour
           under different versions of perl.

           This option has no effect on perl &lt; 5.6

       Deep =&gt; BOOL
           Attaches "Log::Trace" to all packages (that define a TRACE function). Any TRACEF, DUMP and TRACE_HERE
           routines will also be overridden in these packages.

       Dumper =&gt; Data::Serializer backend
           Specify a serialiser to be used for DUMPing data structures.

           This should either be a string naming a Data::Serializer  backend  (e.g.  "YAML")  or  a  hashref  of
           parameters which will be passed to Data::Serializer, e.g.

                   {
                           serializer =&gt; 'XML::Dumper',
                           options =&gt; {
                                   dtd =&gt; 'path/to/my.dtd'
                           }
                   }

           Note  that  the  <b>raw_serialise()</b>  method  of Data::Serializer is used.  See Data::Serializer for more
           information.

           If  you  do  not  have  "Data::Serializer"  installed,  leave  this  option  undefined  to  use   the
           "Data::Dumper" natively.

           Default: undef (use standalone Data::Dumper)

       Everywhere =&gt; BOOL
           When  used  in  conjunction  with  the "Deep" option, it will override the standard behaviour of only
           enabling tracing in packages that define "TRACE" stubs.

           Default: false

       Exclude =&gt; STRING|ARRAY
           Exclude a module or list of modules from tracing.

       Level =&gt; NUMBER|LIST|CODE
           Specifies which trace levels to display.

           If no "Level" is defined, all TRACE statements will be output.

           If the value is numeric, only TRACEs that are at the specified level or below will be output.

           If the value is a list of numbers, only TRACEs that match the specified levels are output.

           The level may also be a code reference which is passed the package name and the TRACE level.  It  mst
           return a true value if the TRACE is to be output.

           Default: undef

       Match =&gt; REGEX
           Exports  trace  functions  to  packages  that  match  the supplied regular expression. Can be used in
           conjunction with  "Exclude". You can also use "Match" as  an  exclusion  method  if  you  give  it  a
           negative look-ahead.

           For example:

                   Match =&gt; qr/^(?!Acme::)/  # will exclude every module beginning with Acme::

           and

                   Match =&gt; qr/^Acme::/      # does the reverse

           Default: '.' # everything

       Verbose =&gt; 0|1|2
           You  can  use  this  option  to prepend extra information to each trace message. The levels represent
           increasing levels of verbosity:

                   0: the default*, don't add anything
                   1: adds subroutine name and line number to the trace output
                   2: As [1], plus a filename and timestamp (in ISO 8601 : 2000 format)

           This setting has no effect on the "custom" or "log" targets.

           * <u>the</u> <u>log</u> <u>target</u> <u>uses</u> <u>'Verbose'</u> <u>level</u> <u>2</u>

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       The AutoImport feature overrides "CORE::require()" which requires perl 5.6, but you  may  see  unexpected
       errors if you aren't using at least perl 5.8. The AutoImport option has no effect on perl &lt; 5.6.

       In  mod_perl  or  other persistent interpreter environments, different applications could trample on each
       other's "TRACE" routines if they use Deep (or Everywhere) option.  For example application A could  route
       all  the  trace  output  from Package::Foo into "appA.log" and then application B could import Log::Trace
       over the top, re-routing all the trace output from Package::Foo to  "appB.log"  for  evermore.   One  way
       around  this  is to ensure you always import Log::Trace on every run in a persistent environment from all
       your applications that use the Deep option.  We may provide some more tools to  work  around  this  in  a
       later version of "Log::Trace".

       "Log::Trace" has not been tested in a multi-threaded application.

</pre><h4><b>DEPENDENCIES</b></h4><pre>
               Carp
               Time::HiRes      (used if available)
               Data::Dumper     (used if available - necessary for meaningful DUMP output)
               Data::Serializer (optional - to customise DUMP output)
               Sys::Syslog      (loaded on demand)

</pre><h4><b>RELATED</b> <b>MODULES</b></h4><pre>
       Log::TraceMessages
           "Log::TraceMessages"  is  similar  in  design and purpose to "Log::Trace".  However, it only offers a
           subset of this module's functionality. Most notably, it doesn't offer  a  mechanism  to  control  the
           tracing  output  of  an  entire  application  -  tracing must be enabled on a module-by-module basis.
           "Log::Trace" also offers control over the output with the  trace  levels  and  supports  more  output
           targets.

       Log::Agent
           "Log::Agent"   offers  a  procedural  interface  to  logging.  It  strikes  a  good  balance  between
           configurability and ease of use. It differs to "Log::Trace" in a number of ways. "Log::Agent"  has  a
           concept of channels and priorities, while "Log::Trace" only offers levels. "Log::Trace" also supports
           tracing  code  execution  path  and the "Deep" import option. "Log::Trace" trades a certain amount of
           configurability for increased ease-of use.

       Log::Log4Perl
           A feature rich perl port of the popular "log4j" library for Java. It is object-oriented and comprised
           of more than 30 modules. It has an impressive feature set, but some people may be frightened  of  its
           complexity.  In  contrast,  to use "Log::Trace" you need only remember up to 4 simple functions and a
           handful of configuration options.
