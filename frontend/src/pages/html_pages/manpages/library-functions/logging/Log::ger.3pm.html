</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Log::ger - A lightweight, flexible logging framework

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 0.042

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Producing</b> <b>logs</b>
       In your module (producer):

        package MyModule;

        # this will install some logger routines. by default: log_trace, log_debug,
        # log_info, log_warn, log_error, and log_fatal. level checker routines are also
        # installed: log_is_trace, log_is_debug, and so on.
        use Log::ger;

        sub foo {
            ...
            # produce some logs. no need to configure output or level. by default
            # output goes nowhere.
            log_error "an error occured: %03d - %s", $errcode, $errmsg;
            ...

            # the logging routines (log_*) can automatically dump data structures
            log_debug "http response: %s", $http;

            # log_fatal does not die by default, if you want to then die() explicitly.
            # but there are plugins that let you do this or provide log_die etc.
            if (blah) { log_fatal "..."; die }

            # use the level checker routines (log_is_*) to avoid doing unnecessary
            # heavy calculation
            if (log_is_trace) {
                my $res = some_heavy_calculation();
                log_trace "The result is %s", $res;
            }

        }
        1;

   <b>Consuming</b> <b>logs</b>
       <u>Choosing</u> <u>an</u> <u>output</u>

       In your application (consumer/listener):

        use MyModule;
        use Log::ger::Output 'Screen'; # configure output
        # level is by default 'warn'
        foo(); # the error message is shown, but debug/trace messages are not.

       <u>Choosing</u> <u>multiple</u> <u>outputs</u>

       Instead of screen, you can output to multiple outputs (including multiple files):

        use Log::ger::Output 'Composite' =&gt; (
            outputs =&gt; {
                Screen =&gt; {},
                File   =&gt; [
                    {conf=&gt;{path=&gt;'/path/to/app.log'}},
                    ...
                ],
                ...
            },
        );

       See Log::ger::Manual::Tutorial::481_Output_Composite for more examples.

       There is also Log::ger::App that wraps this in a simple interface so you just need to do:

        # In your application or script:
        use Log::ger::App;
        use MyModule;

       <u>Choosing</u> <u>level</u>

       One way to set level:

        use Log::ger::Util;
        Log::ger::Util::set_level('debug'); # be more verbose
        foo(); # the error message as well as debug message are now shown, but the trace is not

       There are better ways, e.g. letting users configure log level via configuration file or command-line
       option. See Log::ger::Manual::Tutorial::300_Level for more details.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Log::ger is yet another logging framework with the following features:

       •   Separation of producers and consumers/listeners

           Like  Log::Any,  this  offers  a  very  easy  way  for modules to produce some logs without having to
           configure  anything.  Configuring  output,  level,  etc  can  be  done  in  the  application  as  log
           consumers/listeners.  To  read more about this, see the documentation of Log::Any or Log::ger::Manual
           (but nevertheless see Log::ger::Manual on why you might prefer Log::ger to Log::Any).

       •   Lightweight and fast

           <b>Slim</b>  <b>distribution.</b>  No  non-core  dependencies,  extra  functionalities  are  provided  in  separate
           distributions to be pulled as needed.

           <b>Low</b>  <b>startup</b>  <b>overhead.</b>  Only  ~0.5-1ms.  For  comparison, strict ~0.2-0.5ms, warnings ~2ms, Log::Any
           (v0.15) ~2-3ms, Log::Any (v1.049) ~8-10ms, Log::Log4perl ~35ms. This is measured on  a  2014-2015  PC
           and  before  doing any output configuration. I strive to make "use Log::ger;" statement to be roughly
           as light as "use strict;" or "use warnings;" so the impact of adding the statement is really  minimal
           and  you  can  just add logging without much thought to most of your modules. This is important to me
           because I want logging to be pervasive.

           To test for yourself, try e.g. with bencher-code:

            % bencher-code 'use Log::ger' 'use Log::Any' --startup

           <b>Fast</b>. Low null-/stealth-logging overhead, about 1.5x faster than Log::Any, 3x faster  than  Log4perl,
           5x faster than Log::Fast, ~40x faster than Log::Contextual, and ~100x faster than Log::Dispatch.

           For more benchmarks, see Bencher::Scenarios::Log::ger.

           <b>Conditional</b>  <b>compilation.</b>  There  is  a  plugin  to  optimize  away unneeded logging statements, like
           assertion/conditional   compilation,   so   they   have   zero   runtime   performance   cost.    See
           Log::ger::Plugin::OptAway.

           Being  lightweight means the module can be used more universally, from CLI to long-running daemons to
           inside routines with tight loops.

       •   Flexible

           <b>Customizable</b> <b>levels</b> <b>and</b> <b>routine/method</b> <b>names.</b> Can be used in a procedural or OO style.  Log::ger  can
           mimic  the  interface  of  Log::Any,  Log::Contextual,  Log::Log4perl,  or some other popular logging
           frameworks, to ease migration or adjust with your personal style.

           <b>Per-package</b> <b>settings.</b> Each importer package can use its own format/layout,  output.  For  example,  a
           module that is migrated from Log::Any uses Log::Any-style logging, while another uses native Log::ger
           style,  and  yet some other uses block formatting like Log::Contextual. This eases code migration and
           teamwork. Each module author can preserve her own logging style, if wanted, and all the modules still
           use the same framework.

           <b>Dynamic.</b> Outputs and levels can be changed anytime  during  run-time  and  logger  routines  will  be
           updated  automatically.  This  is useful in situation like a long-running server application: you can
           turn on tracing logs temporarily to debug problems, then turn them off again, without restarting your
           server.

           <b>Interoperability.</b> There are modules to interop with  Log::Any,  either  consume  Log::Any  logs  (see
           Log::Any::Adapter::LogGer) or produce logs to be consumed by Log::Any (see Log::ger::Output::LogAny).

           <b>Many</b>    <b>output</b>    <b>modules</b>    <b>and</b>    <b>plugins.</b>    See   "Log::ger::Output::*",   "Log::ger::Format::*",
           "Log::ger::Layout::*", "Log::ger::Plugin::*". Writing an output module in  Log::ger  is  easier  than
           writing a Log::Any::Adapter::*.

       For more documentation, start with Log::ger::Manual.

       Some   other   popular  logging  frameworks:  Log::Any,  Log::Contextual,  Log::Log4perl,  Log::Dispatch,
       Log::Dispatchouli.

       If you still prefer debugging using the good old print(), there's Debug::Print.
