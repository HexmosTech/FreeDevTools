       Log::Log4perl::Appender::File - Log to file

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Log::Log4perl::Appender::File;

           my $app = Log::Log4perl::Appender::File-&gt;new(
             filename  =&gt; 'file.log',
             mode      =&gt; 'append',
             autoflush =&gt; 1,
             umask     =&gt; 0222,
           );

           $file-&gt;log(message =&gt; "Log me\n");

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This is a simple appender for writing to a file.

       The "log()" method takes a single scalar. If a newline character should terminate the message, it has to
       be added explicitly.

       Upon destruction of the object, the filehandle to access the file is flushed and closed.

       If you want to switch over to a different logfile, use the "file_switch($newfile)" method which will
       first close the old file handle and then open a one to the new file specified.

   <b>OPTIONS</b>
       filename
           Name of the log file.

       mode
           Messages  will be append to the file if $mode is set to the string "append". Will clobber the file if
           set to "clobber". If it is "pipe", the file will be understood  as  executable  to  pipe  output  to.
           Default mode is "append".

       autoflush
           "autoflush",  if  set  to  a  true value, triggers flushing the data out to the file on every call to
           "log()". "autoflush" is on by default.

       syswrite
           "syswrite", if set to a true value, makes sure that the appender uses <b>syswrite()</b> instead  of  <b>print()</b>
           to  log the message. "syswrite()" usually maps to the operating system's "write()" function and makes
           sure that no other process writes to the same log file while "write()" is busy.  Might safe you  from
           having to use other synchronisation measures like semaphores (see: Synchronized appender).

       umask
           Specifies  the "umask" to use when creating the file, determining the file's permission settings.  If
           set to 0022 (default), new files will be created with "rw-r--r--" permissions.  If set to  0000,  new
           files will be created with "rw-rw-rw-" permissions.

       owner
           If set, specifies that the owner of the newly created log file should be different from the effective
           user  id of the running process.  Only makes sense if the process is running as root.  Both numerical
           user ids and user names are acceptable.  Log4perl  does  not  attempt  to  change  the  ownership  of
           <u>existing</u> files.

       group
           If set, specifies that the group of the newly created log file should be different from the effective
           group id of the running process.  Only makes sense if the process is running as root.  Both numerical
           group  ids  and group names are acceptable.  Log4perl does not attempt to change the group membership
           of <u>existing</u> files.

       utf8
           If you're printing out Unicode strings, the output filehandle needs to be set into ":utf8" mode:

               my $app = Log::Log4perl::Appender::File-&gt;new(
                 filename  =&gt; 'file.log',
                 mode      =&gt; 'append',
                 utf8      =&gt; 1,
               );

       binmode
           To manipulate the output filehandle via "binmode()", use the binmode parameter:

               my $app = Log::Log4perl::Appender::File-&gt;new(
                 filename  =&gt; 'file.log',
                 mode      =&gt; 'append',
                 binmode   =&gt; ":utf8",
               );

           A setting of ":utf8" for "binmode" is equivalent to specifying the "utf8" option (see above).

       recreate
           Normally, if a file appender logs to a file and the file gets moved to a different location (e.g. via
           "mv"), the appender's open file handle will automatically follow the file to the new location.

           This may be undesirable. When using an external logfile rotator, for  example,  the  appender  should
           create  a new file under the old name and start logging into it. If the "recreate" option is set to a
           true value, "Log::Log4perl::Appender::File" will do exactly that. It defaults  to  false.  Check  the
           "recreate_check_interval" option for performance optimizations with this feature.

       recreate_check_interval
           In  "recreate"  mode, the appender has to continuously check if the file it is logging to is still in
           the same location. This check is fairly expensive, since it has to call "stat" on the file  name  and
           figure  out  if  its  inode  has  changed.  Doing  this with every call to "log" can be prohibitively
           expensive. Setting it to a positive integer value N will only check the  file  every  N  seconds.  It
           defaults to 30.

           This  obviously  means  that  the appender will continue writing to a moved file until the next check
           occurs, in the worst case this will happen "recreate_check_interval" seconds after the file has  been
           moved  or  deleted.  If  this  is  undesirable,  setting "recreate_check_interval" to 0 will have the
           appender check the file with <u>every</u> call to "log()".

       recreate_check_signal
           In "recreate" mode, if this option is set to a signal name (e.g. "USR1"), the appender will  recreate
           a  missing  logfile  when  it  receives the signal. It uses less resources than constant polling. The
           usual limitation with perl's signal handling apply.  Check the FAQ for using this option with the log
           rotating utility "newsyslog".

       recreate_pid_write
           The popular log rotating utility "newsyslog" expects a pid file in order to send  the  application  a
           signal  when  its  logs  have been rotated. This option expects a path to a file where the pid of the
           currently running application gets written to.  Check the FAQ for using  this  option  with  the  log
           rotating utility "newsyslog".

       create_at_logtime
           The  file appender typically creates its logfile in its constructor, i.e.  at Log4perl "init()" time.
           This is desirable for most use cases, because  it  makes  sure  that  file  permission  problems  get
           detected right away, and not after days/weeks/months of operation when the appender suddenly needs to
           log something and fails because of a problem that was obvious at startup.

           However, there are rare use cases where the file shouldn't be created at Log4perl "init()" time, e.g.
           if  the  appender can't be used by the current user although it is defined in the configuration file.
           If you set "create_at_logtime" to a true value, the file appender will try to create the file at  log
           time.  Note  that this setting lets permission problems sit undetected until log time, which might be
           undesirable.

       header_text
           If you want Log4perl to  print  a  header  into  every  newly  opened  (or  re-opened)  logfile,  set
           "header_text"  to  either  a string or a subroutine returning a string. If the message doesn't have a
           newline, a newline at the end of the header will be provided.

       mkpath
           If this this option is set to true, the directory path will be created if it does not exist yet.

       mkpath_umask
           Specifies the "umask" to use when creating the  directory,  determining  the  directory's  permission
           settings.   If set to 0022 (default), new directory will be created with "rwxr-xr-x" permissions.  If
           set to 0000, new directory will be created with "rwxrwxrwx" permissions.

       Design and implementation of this module has been  greatly  inspired  by  Dave  Rolsky's  "Log::Dispatch"
       appender framework.
