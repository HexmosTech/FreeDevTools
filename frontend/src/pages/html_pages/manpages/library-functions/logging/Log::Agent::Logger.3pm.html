</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Log::Agent::Logger - a logging interface

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        require Log::Agent::Logger;

        my $log = Log::Agent::Logger-&gt;make(
            -channel    =&gt; $chan,
            -max_prio   =&gt; 'info',
            -min_prio   =&gt; 'emerg',
        );

        $log-&gt;error("can't open file %s: $!", $file);
        $log-&gt;warning("can't open file: $!");

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The "Log::Agent::Logger" class defines a generic interface for application logging.  It must not be
       confused with the interface provided by Log::Agent, which is meant to be used by re-usable modules that
       do not wish to commit on a particular logging method, so that they remain true building blocks.

       By contrast, "Log::Agent::Logger" explicitly requests an object to be used, and that object must commit
       upon the logging channel to be used, at creation time.

       Optionally, minimum and maximum priority levels may be defined (and changed dynamically) to limit the
       messages to effectively log, depending on the advertised priority.  The standard <b><a href="../man3/syslog.3.html">syslog</a></b>(3) priorities are
       used.

</pre><h4><b>CHANNEL</b> <b>LIST</b></h4><pre>
       The following channels are available:

   <b>Standard</b> <b>Log::Agent</b> <b>Channels</b>
       Those channels are documented in Log::Agent::Channel.

   <b>Other</b> <b>Channels</b>
       Future "Log::Agent::Logger" extension will extend the set of available channels.

</pre><h4><b>INTERFACE</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Creation</b> <b>Routine</b>
       The creation routine is called "make" and takes the following switches:

       "-caller" =&gt; [ <u>parameters</u> ]
           Request  that caller information (relative to the -&gt;<b>log()</b> call) be part of the log message. The given
           <u>parameters</u> are handed off to the creation routine of  "Log::Agent::Tag::Caller"  and  are  documented
           there.

           I usually say something like:

            -caller =&gt; [ -display =&gt; '($sub/$line)', -postfix =&gt; 1 ]

           which  I  find  informative  enough.  On  occasion, I found myself using more complex sequences.  See
           Log::Agent::Tag::Caller.

       "-channel"
           This defines the "Log::Agent::Channel" to be used for logging.  Please refer  to  Log::Agent::Channel
           for details, and in particular to get a list of pre-defined logging channels.

       "-min_prio"
           Defines the minimum priority to be logged (included).  Defaults to "emerg".

       "-max_prio"
           Defines the maximum priority to be logged (included).  Defaults to "debug".

       "-priority" =&gt; [ <u>parameters</u> ]
           Request  that  message  priority  information  be  part of the log message.  The given <u>parameters</u> are
           handed off to the creation routine of "Log::Agent::Tag::Priority" and are documented there.

           I usually say something like:

                   -priority =&gt; [ -display =&gt; '[$priority]' ]

           which will display the whole priority name at the beginning of the messages, e.g. "[warning]"  for  a
           <b>warn()</b> or "[error]" for <b>error()</b>.  See Log::Agent::Tag::Priority and Log::Agent::Priorities.

       "-tags" =&gt; [ <u>list</u> <u>of</u> <u>"Log::Agent::Tag"</u> <u>objects</u> ]
           Specifies  user-defined  tags  to be added to each message.  The objects given here must inherit from
           "Log::Agent::Tag" and conform to its interface.  See Log::Agent::Tag for details.

           At runtime, well after the creation of the logging object, it may be desirable to add (or  remove)  a
           user  tag.   Use  the  "tags"  attribute  to  retrieve  the  tag list object and interact with it, as
           explained in Log::Agent::Tag_List.

   <b>Logging</b> <b>Interface</b>
       Each routine is documented to take a single string, but you may also supply a code reference as the first
       argument, followed by extra arguments.  That routine will be called, along with the extra  arguments,  to
       generate the message to be logged.  If that sounds crazy, think about the CPU time we save by NOT calling
       the routine.  If nothing is returned by the routine, nothing is logged.

       If more than one argument is given, and the first argument is not a code reference, then it is taken as a
       <b>printf()</b> format, and the remaining arguments are used to fill the various "%" placeholders in the format.
       The special "%m" placeholder does not make use of any extra argument and is replaced by a stringification
       of the error message contained in $!, aka "errno".

       There  is  a  logging  routine  defined for each <b><a href="../man3/syslog.3.html">syslog</a></b>(3) priority, along with aliases for some of them.
       Here is an exhaustive table, sorted by decreasing priority.

           Syslog     Alias
           --------   ---------
           emerg      emergency
           alert
           crit       critical
           err        error
           warning    warn
           notice
           info
           debug

       We shall document only one routine for a given level: for instance, we document "warn" but you could also
       use the standard "warning" to achieve exactly the same funciton.

       "emergency($str)"
           Log at the "emerg" level, usually just before panicing.  Something terribly bad  has  been  detected,
           and the program might crash soon after logging this.

       "alert($str)"
           Log  at  the  "alert"  level,  to  signal  a  problem  requiring  immediate attention.  Usually, some
           functionality will be missing until the condition is fixed.

       "critical($str)"
           Log at the "crit" level, to signal a severe error that prevents fulfilling some activity.

       "error($str)"
           Log at the "err" level, to signal a regular error.

       "warn($str)"
           Log at the "warning" level, which is an indication that something unusual occurred.

       "notice($str)"
           Log at the "notice" level, indicating something that is fully handled by the applicaiton,  but  which
           is not the norm.  A significant condition, as they say.

       "info($str)"
           Log at the "info" level, for their amusement.

       "debug($str)"
           Log at the "debug" level, to further confuse them.

   <b>Closing</b> <b>Channel</b>
       "close"
           This  routine  closes  the  channel.   Further logging to the logger is permitted, but will be simply
           discarded without notice.

   <b>Attribute</b> <b>Access</b>
       The following access routines are defined:

       "channel"
           The defined logging channel.  Cannot be changed.

       "max_prio" and "max_prio_str"
           Returns the maximum priority  recorded,  either  as  a  numeric  value  or  as  a  string.   For  the
           correspondance between the two, see Log::Agent::Priorities.

       "min_prio" and "min_prio_str"
           Returns  the  minimum  priority  recorded,  either  as  a  numeric  value  or  as  a string.  For the
           correspondance between the two, see Log::Agent::Priorities.

       "set_caller_info" <u>list</u>
           Dynamically change the caller information formatting in the logs.   The  <u>list</u>  given  supersedes  the
           initial  settings  done  via the "-caller" argument, if any, and is passed to the creation routine of
           the "Log::Agent::Tag::Caller" class.  Note that a plain list must be given, not a list ref.  An empty
           list removes caller information from subsequent logs.

           Please see Log::Agent::Tag::Caller to get the allowed parameters for <u>list</u>.

       "set_max_prio($prio)" and "set_min_prio($prio)"
           Used to modify the maximum/minimum priorities.  You can use either the string value or the  numerical
           equivalent, as documented in Log::Agent::Priorities.

       "set_priority_info" <u>list</u>
           Dynamically  change  the  priority information formatting in the logs.  The <u>list</u> given supersedes the
           initial settings done via the "-priority" argument, if any, and is passed to the creation routine  of
           the  "Log::Agent::Tag::Priority"  class.   Note  that a plain list must be given, not a list ref.  An
           empty list removes priority information from subsequent logs.

           Please see Log::Agent::Tag::Priority to get the allowed parameters for <u>list</u>.

       "tags"
           Returns a "Log::Agent::Tag_List" object, which holds all user-defined tags that are to  be  added  to
           each log message.

           The  initial  list  of tags is normally supplied by the application at creation time, via the "-tags"
           argument.  See Log::Agent::Tag_List for the operations that can be performed on that object.
