       Log::Log4perl::FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions on Log::Log4perl

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This FAQ shows a wide variety of commonly encountered logging tasks and how to solve them in the most
       elegant way with Log::Log4perl. Most of the time, this will be just a matter of smartly configuring your
       Log::Log4perl configuration files.

   <b>Why</b> <b>use</b> <b>Log::Log4perl</b> <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>logging</b> <b>module</b> <b>on</b> <b>CPAN?</b>
       That's a good question. There's dozens of logging modules on CPAN.  When it comes to logging, people
       typically think: "Aha. Writing out debug and error messages. Debug is lower than error. Easy. I'm gonna
       write my own." Writing a logging module is like a rite of passage for every Perl programmer, just like
       writing your own templating system.

       Of course, after getting the basics right, features need to be added. You'd like to write a timestamp
       with every message. Then timestamps with microseconds. Then messages need to be written to both the
       screen and a log file.

       And, as your application grows in size you might wonder: Why doesn't my logging system scale along with
       it? You would like to switch on logging in selected parts of the application, and not all across the
       board, because this kills performance. This is when people turn to Log::Log4perl, because it handles all
       of that.

       Avoid this costly switch.

       Use "Log::Log4perl" right from the start. "Log::Log4perl"'s ":easy" mode supports easy logging in simple
       scripts:

           use Log::Log4perl qw(:easy);
           Log::Log4perl-&gt;easy_init($DEBUG);

           DEBUG "A low-level message";
           ERROR "Won't make it until level gets increased to ERROR";

       And when your application inevitably grows, your logging system grows with it without you having to
       change any code.

       Please, don't re-invent logging. "Log::Log4perl" is here, it's easy to use, it scales, and covers many
       areas you haven't thought of yet, but will enter soon.

   <b>What's</b> <b>the</b> <b>easiest</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>Log4perl?</b>
       If you just want to get all the comfort of logging, without much overhead, use <u>Stealth</u> <u>Loggers</u>. If you
       use Log::Log4perl in ":easy" mode like

           use Log::Log4perl qw(:easy);

       you'll have the following functions available in the current package:

           DEBUG("message");
           INFO("message");
           WARN("message");
           ERROR("message");
           FATAL("message");

       Just make sure that every package of your code where you're using them in pulls in "use Log::Log4perl
       qw(:easy)" first, then you're set.  Every stealth logger's category will be equivalent to the name of the
       package it's located in.

       These stealth loggers will be absolutely silent until you initialize Log::Log4perl in your main program
       with either

               # Define any Log4perl behavior
           Log::Log4perl-&gt;init("foo.conf");

       (using a full-blown Log4perl config file) or the super-easy method

               # Just log to STDERR
           Log::Log4perl-&gt;easy_init($DEBUG);

       or the parameter-style method with a complexity somewhat in between:

               # Append to a log file
           Log::Log4perl-&gt;easy_init( { level   =&gt; $DEBUG,
                                       file    =&gt; "&gt;&gt;test.log" } );

       For more info, please check out "Stealth Loggers" in Log::Log4perl.

   <b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>simply</b> <b>log</b> <b>all</b> <b>my</b> <b>ERROR</b> <b>messages</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>file?</b>
       After pulling in the "Log::Log4perl" module, just initialize its behavior by passing in a configuration
       to its "init" method as a string reference. Then, obtain a logger instance and write out a message with
       its "error()" method:

           use Log::Log4perl qw(get_logger);

               # Define configuration
           my $conf = q(
               log4perl.logger                    = ERROR, FileApp
               log4perl.appender.FileApp          = Log::Log4perl::Appender::File
               log4perl.appender.FileApp.filename = test.log
               log4perl.appender.FileApp.layout   = PatternLayout
               log4perl.appender.FileApp.layout.ConversionPattern = %d&gt; %m%n
           );

               # Initialize logging behavior
           Log::Log4perl-&gt;init( \$conf );

               # Obtain a logger instance
           my $logger = get_logger("Bar::Twix");
           $logger-&gt;error("Oh my, a dreadful error!");
           $logger-&gt;warn("Oh my, a dreadful warning!");

       This will append something like

           2002/10/29 20:11:55&gt; Oh my, a dreadful error!

       to the log file "test.log". How does this all work?

       While the Log::Log4perl "init()" method typically takes the name of a configuration file as its input
       parameter like in

           Log::Log4perl-&gt;init( "/path/mylog.conf" );

       the example above shows how to pass in a configuration as text in a scalar reference.

       The configuration as shown defines a logger of the root category, which has an appender of type
       "Log::Log4perl::Appender::File" attached. The line

           log4perl.logger = ERROR, FileApp

       doesn't list a category, defining a root logger. Compare that with

           log4perl.logger.Bar.Twix = ERROR, FileApp

       which would define a logger for the category "Bar::Twix", showing probably different behavior. "FileApp"
       on the right side of the assignment is an arbitrarily defined variable name, which is only used to
       somehow reference an appender defined later on.

       Appender settings in the configuration are defined as follows:

           log4perl.appender.FileApp          = Log::Log4perl::Appender::File
           log4perl.appender.FileApp.filename = test.log

       It selects the file appender of the "Log::Log4perl::Appender" hierarchy, which will append to the file
       "test.log" if it already exists. If we wanted to overwrite a potentially existing file, we would have to
       explicitly set the appropriate "Log::Log4perl::Appender::File" parameter "mode":

           log4perl.appender.FileApp          = Log::Log4perl::Appender::File
           log4perl.appender.FileApp.filename = test.log
           log4perl.appender.FileApp.mode     = write

       Also, the configuration defines a PatternLayout format, adding the nicely formatted current date and
       time, an arrow (&gt;) and a space before the messages, which is then followed by a newline:

           log4perl.appender.FileApp.layout   = PatternLayout
           log4perl.appender.FileApp.layout.ConversionPattern = %d&gt; %m%n

       Obtaining a logger instance and actually logging something is typically done in a different system part
       as the Log::Log4perl initialisation section, but in this example, it's just done right after init for the
       sake of compactness:

               # Obtain a logger instance
           my $logger = get_logger("Bar::Twix");
           $logger-&gt;error("Oh my, a dreadful error!");

       This retrieves an instance of the logger of the category "Bar::Twix", which, as all other categories,
       inherits behavior from the root logger if no other loggers are defined in the initialization section.

       The "error()" method fires up a message, which the root logger catches. Its priority is equal to or
       higher than the root logger's priority (ERROR), which causes the root logger to forward it to its
       attached appender. By contrast, the following

           $logger-&gt;warn("Oh my, a dreadful warning!");

       doesn't make it through, because the root logger sports a higher setting (ERROR and up) than the WARN
       priority of the message.

   <b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>install</b> <b>Log::Log4perl</b> <b>on</b> <b>Microsoft</b> <b>Windows?</b>
       You can install Log::Log4perl using the CPAN client.

       Alternatively you can install it using

           ppm install Log-Log4perl

       if you're using ActiveState perl.

       That's it! Afterwards, just create a Perl script like

           use Log::Log4perl qw(:easy);
           Log::Log4perl-&gt;easy_init($DEBUG);

           my $logger = get_logger("Twix::Bar");
           $logger-&gt;debug("Watch me!");

       and run it. It should print something like

           2002/11/06 01:22:05 Watch me!

       If you find that something doesn't work, please let us know at <a href="mailto:log4perl-devel@lists.sourceforge.net">log4perl-devel@lists.sourceforge.net</a> --
       we'll appreciate it. Have fun!

   <b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>include</b> <b>global</b> <b>(thread-specific)</b> <b>data</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>log</b> <b>messages?</b>
       Say, you're writing a web application and want all your log messages to include the current client's IP
       address. Most certainly, you don't want to include it in each and every log message like in

           $logger-&gt;debug( $r-&gt;connection-&gt;remote_ip,
                           " Retrieving user data from DB" );

       do you? Instead, you want to set it in a global data structure and have Log::Log4perl include it
       automatically via a PatternLayout setting in the configuration file:

           log4perl.appender.FileApp.layout.ConversionPattern = %X{ip} %m%n

       The conversion specifier %X{ip} references an entry under the key "ip" in the global "MDC" (mapped
       diagnostic context) table, which you've set once via

           Log::Log4perl::MDC-&gt;put("ip", $r-&gt;connection-&gt;remote_ip);

       at the start of the request handler. Note that this is a <u>static</u> (class) method, there's no logger object
       involved.  You can use this method with as many key/value pairs as you like as long as you reference them
       under different names.

       The mappings are stored in a global hash table within Log::Log4perl.  Luckily, because the thread model
       in 5.8.0 doesn't share global variables between threads unless they're explicitly marked as such, there's
       no problem with multi-threaded environments.

       For more details on the MDC, please refer to "Mapped Diagnostic Context (MDC)" in Log::Log4perl and
       Log::Log4perl::MDC.

   <b>My</b> <b>application</b> <b>is</b> <b>already</b> <b>logging</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>file.</b> <b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>duplicate</b> <b>all</b> <b>messages</b> <b>to</b> <b>also</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen?</b>
       Assuming that you already have a Log4perl configuration file like

           log4perl.logger                    = DEBUG, FileApp

           log4perl.appender.FileApp          = Log::Log4perl::Appender::File
           log4perl.appender.FileApp.filename = test.log
           log4perl.appender.FileApp.layout   = PatternLayout
           log4perl.appender.FileApp.layout.ConversionPattern = %d&gt; %m%n

       and log statements all over your code, it's very easy with Log4perl to have the same messages both
       printed to the logfile and the screen. No reason to change your code, of course, just add another
       appender to the configuration file and you're done:

           log4perl.logger                    = DEBUG, FileApp, ScreenApp

           log4perl.appender.FileApp          = Log::Log4perl::Appender::File
           log4perl.appender.FileApp.filename = test.log
           log4perl.appender.FileApp.layout   = PatternLayout
           log4perl.appender.FileApp.layout.ConversionPattern = %d&gt; %m%n

           log4perl.appender.ScreenApp          = Log::Log4perl::Appender::Screen
           log4perl.appender.ScreenApp.stderr   = 0
           log4perl.appender.ScreenApp.layout   = PatternLayout
           log4perl.appender.ScreenApp.layout.ConversionPattern = %d&gt; %m%n

       The configuration file above is assuming that both appenders are active in the same logger hierarchy, in
       this case the "root" category.  But even if you've got file loggers defined in several parts of your
       system, belonging to different logger categories, each logging to different files, you can gobble up all
       logged messages by defining a root logger with a screen appender, which would duplicate messages from all
       your file loggers to the screen due to Log4perl's appender inheritance. Check

       for details. Have fun!

   <b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>my</b> <b>application</b> <b>logs</b> <b>a</b> <b>message</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>dies</b> <b>unexpectedly?</b>
       Whenever you encounter a fatal error in your application, instead of saying something like

           open FILE, "&lt;blah" or die "Can't open blah -- bailing out!";

       just use Log::Log4perl's fatal functions instead:

           my $log = get_logger("Some::Package");
           open FILE, "&lt;blah" or $log-&gt;logdie("Can't open blah -- bailing out!");

       This will both log the message with priority FATAL according to your current Log::Log4perl configuration
       and then call Perl's "die()" afterwards to terminate the program. It works the same with stealth loggers
       (see "Stealth Loggers" in Log::Log4perl), all you need to do is call

           use Log::Log4perl qw(:easy);
           open FILE, "&lt;blah" or LOGDIE "Can't open blah -- bailing out!";

       What can you do if you're using some library which doesn't use Log::Log4perl and calls "die()" internally
       if something goes wrong? Use a $SIG{__DIE__} pseudo signal handler

           use Log::Log4perl qw(get_logger);

           $SIG{__DIE__} = sub {
               if($^S) {
                   # We're in an eval {} and don't want log
                   # this message but catch it later
                   return;
               }
               local $Log::Log4perl::caller_depth =
                     $Log::Log4perl::caller_depth + 1;
               my $logger = get_logger("");
               $logger-&gt;fatal(@_);
               die @_; # Now terminate really
           };

       This will catch every "die()"-Exception of your application or the modules it uses. In case you want to
       It will fetch a root logger and pass on the "die()"-Message to it.  If you make sure you've configured
       with a root logger like this:

           Log::Log4perl-&gt;init(\q{
               log4perl.category         = FATAL, Logfile
               log4perl.appender.Logfile = Log::Log4perl::Appender::File
               log4perl.appender.Logfile.filename = fatal_errors.log
               log4perl.appender.Logfile.layout = \
                          Log::Log4perl::Layout::PatternLayout
               log4perl.appender.Logfile.layout.ConversionPattern = %F{1}-%L (%M)&gt; %m%n
           });

       then all "die()" messages will be routed to a file properly. The line

            local $Log::Log4perl::caller_depth =
                  $Log::Log4perl::caller_depth + 1;

       in the pseudo signal handler above merits a more detailed explanation. With the setup above, if a module
       calls "die()" in one of its functions, the fatal message will be logged in the signal handler and not in
       the original function -- which will cause the %F, %L and %M placeholders in the pattern layout to be
       replaced by the filename, the line number and the function/method name of the signal handler, not the
       error-throwing module. To adjust this, Log::Log4perl has the $caller_depth variable, which defaults to 0,
       but can be set to positive integer values to offset the caller level. Increasing it by one will cause it
       to log the calling function's parameters, not the ones of the signal handler.  See "Using Log::Log4perl
       from wrapper classes" in Log::Log4perl for more details.

   <b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>hook</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>LWP</b> <b>library</b> <b>with</b> <b>Log::Log4perl?</b>
       Or, to put it more generally: How can you utilize a third-party library's embedded logging and debug
       statements in Log::Log4perl?  How can you make them print to configurable appenders, turn them on and
       off, just as if they were regular Log::Log4perl logging statements?

       The easiest solution is to map the third-party library logging statements to Log::Log4perl's stealth
       loggers via a typeglob assignment.

       As an example, let's take LWP, one of the most popular Perl modules, which makes handling WWW requests
       and responses a breeze.  Internally, LWP uses its own logging and debugging system, utilizing the
       following calls inside the LWP code (from the LWP::Debug man page):

               # Function tracing
           LWP::Debug::trace('send()');

               # High-granular state in functions
           LWP::Debug::debug('url ok');

               # Data going over the wire
           LWP::Debug::conns("read $n bytes: $data");

       First, let's assign Log::Log4perl priorities to these functions: I'd suggest that "debug()" messages have
       priority "INFO", "trace()" uses "DEBUG" and "conns()" also logs with "DEBUG" -- although your mileage may
       certainly vary.

       Now, in order to transparently hook up LWP::Debug with Log::Log4perl, all we have to do is say

           package LWP::Debug;
           use Log::Log4perl qw(:easy);

           *trace = *INFO;
           *conns = *DEBUG;
           *debug = *DEBUG;

           package main;
           # ... go on with your regular program ...

       at the beginning of our program. In this way, every time the, say, "LWP::UserAgent" module calls
       "LWP::Debug::trace()", it will implicitly call <b>INFO()</b>, which is the "info()" method of a stealth logger
       defined for the Log::Log4perl category "LWP::Debug". Is this cool or what?

       Here's a complete program:

           use LWP::UserAgent;
           use HTTP::Request::Common;
           use Log::Log4perl qw(:easy);

           Log::Log4perl-&gt;easy_init(
               { category =&gt; "LWP::Debug",
                 level    =&gt; $DEBUG,
                 layout   =&gt; "%r %p %M-%L %m%n",
               });

           package LWP::Debug;
           use Log::Log4perl qw(:easy);
           *trace = *INFO;
           *conns = *DEBUG;
           *debug = *DEBUG;

           package main;
           my $ua = LWP::UserAgent-&gt;new();
           my $resp = $ua-&gt;request(GET "<a href="http://amazon.com">http://amazon.com</a>");

           if($resp-&gt;is_success()) {
               print "Success: Received ",
                     length($resp-&gt;content()), "\n";
           } else {
               print "Error: ", $resp-&gt;code(), "\n";
           }

       This will generate the following output on STDERR:

       Of course, in this way, the embedded logging and debug statements within LWP can be utilized in any
       Log::Log4perl way you can think of. You can have them sent to different appenders, block them based on
       the category and everything else Log::Log4perl has to offer.

       Only drawback of this method: Steering logging behavior via category is always based on the "LWP::Debug"
       package. Although the logging statements reflect the package name of the issuing module properly, the
       stealth loggers in "LWP::Debug" are all of the category "LWP::Debug".  This implies that you can't
       control the logging behavior based on the package that's <u>initiating</u> a log request (e.g. LWP::UserAgent)
       but only based on the package that's actually <u>executing</u> the logging statement, "LWP::Debug" in this case.

       To work around this conundrum, we need to write a wrapper function and plant it into the "LWP::Debug"
       package. It will determine the caller and create a logger bound to a category with the same name as the
       caller's package:

           package LWP::Debug;

           use Log::Log4perl qw(:levels get_logger);

           sub l4p_wrapper {
               my($prio, @message) = @_;
               $Log::Log4perl::caller_depth += 2;
               get_logger(scalar <a href="../man1/caller.1.html">caller</a>(1))-&gt;log($prio, @message);
               $Log::Log4perl::caller_depth -= 2;
           }

           no warnings 'redefine';
           *trace = sub { l4p_wrapper($INFO, @_); };
           *debug = *conns = sub { l4p_wrapper($DEBUG, @_); };

           package main;
           # ... go on with your main program ...

       This is less performant than the previous approach, because every log request will request a reference to
       a logger first, then call the wrapper, which will in turn call the appropriate log function.

       This hierarchy shift has to be compensated for by increasing $Log::Log4perl::caller_depth by 2 before
       calling the log function and decreasing it by 2 right afterwards. Also, the "l4p_wrapper" function shown
       above calls <a href="../man1/caller.1.html">caller</a>(1) which determines the name of the package <u>two</u> levels down the calling hierarchy (and
       therefore compensates for both the wrapper function and the anonymous subroutine calling it).

       "no warnings 'redefine'" suppresses a warning Perl would generate otherwise upon redefining
       "LWP::Debug"'s "trace()", "debug()" and "conns()" functions. In case you use a perl prior to 5.6.x, you
       need to manipulate $^W instead.

       To make things easy for you when dealing with LWP, Log::Log4perl 0.47 introduces
       "Log::Log4perl-&gt;infiltrate_lwp()" which does exactly the above.

   <b>What</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>need</b> <b>dynamic</b> <b>values</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>static</b> <b>Log4perl</b> <b>configuration</b> <b>file?</b>
       Say, your application uses Log::Log4perl for logging and therefore comes with a Log4perl configuration
       file, specifying the logging behavior.  But, you also want it to take command line parameters to set
       values like the name of the log file.  How can you have both a static Log4perl configuration file and a
       dynamic command line interface?

       As of Log::Log4perl 0.28, every value in the configuration file can be specified as a <u>Perl</u> <u>hook</u>. So,
       instead of saying

           log4perl.appender.Logfile.filename = test.log

       you could just as well have a Perl subroutine deliver the value dynamically:

           log4perl.appender.Logfile.filename = sub { logfile(); };

       given that "logfile()" is a valid function in your "main" package returning a string containing the path
       to the log file.

       Or, think about using the value of an environment variable:

           log4perl.appender.DBI.user = sub { $ENV{USERNAME} };

       When "Log::Log4perl-&gt;init()" parses the configuration file, it will notice the assignment above because
       of its "sub {...}" pattern and treat it in a special way: It will evaluate the subroutine (which can
       contain arbitrary Perl code) and take its return value as the right side of the assignment.

       A typical application would be called like this on the command line:

           app                # log file is "test.log"
           app -l mylog.txt   # log file is "mylog.txt"

       Here's some sample code implementing the command line interface above:

           use Log::Log4perl qw(get_logger);
           use Getopt::Std;

           getopt('l:', \our %OPTS);

           my $conf = q(
           log4perl.category.Bar.Twix         = WARN, Logfile
           log4perl.appender.Logfile          = Log::Log4perl::Appender::File
           log4perl.appender.Logfile.filename = sub { logfile(); };
           log4perl.appender.Logfile.layout   = SimpleLayout
           );

           Log::Log4perl::init(\$conf);

           my $logger = get_logger("Bar::Twix");
           $logger-&gt;error("Blah");

           ###########################################
           sub logfile {
           ###########################################
               if(exists $OPTS{l}) {
                   return $OPTS{l};
               } else {
                   return "test.log";
               }
           }

       Every Perl hook may contain arbitrary perl code, just make sure to fully qualify eventual variable names
       (e.g. %main::OPTS instead of %OPTS).

       <b>SECURITY</b> <b>NOTE</b>: this feature means arbitrary perl code can be embedded in the config file.  In the rare
       case where the people who have access to your config file are different from the people who write your
       code and shouldn't have execute rights, you might want to call

           $Log::Log4perl::Config-&gt;<a href="../man0/allow_code.0.html">allow_code</a>(0);

       before you call <b>init()</b>. This will prevent Log::Log4perl from executing <u>any</u> Perl code in the config file
       (including code for custom conversion specifiers (see "Custom cspecs" in
       Log::Log4perl::Layout::PatternLayout).

   <b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>roll</b> <b>over</b> <b>my</b> <b>logfiles</b> <b>automatically</b> <b>at</b> <b>midnight?</b>
       Long-running applications tend to produce ever-increasing logfiles.  For backup and cleanup purposes,
       however, it is often desirable to move the current logfile to a different location from time to time and
       start writing a new one.

       This is a non-trivial task, because it has to happen in sync with the logging system in order not to lose
       any messages in the process.

       Luckily, <u>Mark</u> <u>Pfeiffer</u>'s "Log::Dispatch::FileRotate" appender works well with Log::Log4perl to rotate
       your logfiles in a variety of ways.

       Note, however, that having the application deal with rotating a log file is not cheap. Among other
       things, it requires locking the log file with every write to avoid race conditions.  There are good
       reasons to use external rotators like "newsyslog" instead.  See the entry "How can I rotate a logfile
       with newsyslog?" in the FAQ for more information on how to configure it.

       When using "Log::Dispatch::FileRotate", all you have to do is specify it in your Log::Log4perl
       configuration file and your logfiles will be rotated automatically.

       You can choose between rolling based on a maximum size ("roll if greater than 10 MB") or based on a date
       pattern ("roll everyday at midnight").  In both cases, "Log::Dispatch::FileRotate" allows you to define a
       number "max" of saved files to keep around until it starts overwriting the oldest ones. If you set the
       "max" parameter to 2 and the name of your logfile is "test.log", "Log::Dispatch::FileRotate" will move
       "test.log" to "test.log.1" on the first rollover. On the second rollover, it will move "test.log.1" to
       "test.log.2" and then "test.log" to "test.log.1". On the third rollover, it will move "test.log.1" to
       "test.log.2" (therefore discarding the old "test.log.2") and "test.log" to "test.log.1". And so forth.
       This way, there's always going to be a maximum of 2 saved log files around.

       Here's an example of a Log::Log4perl configuration file, defining a daily rollover at midnight (date
       pattern "yyyy-MM-dd"), keeping a maximum of 5 saved logfiles around:

           log4perl.category         = WARN, Logfile
           log4perl.appender.Logfile = Log::Dispatch::FileRotate
           log4perl.appender.Logfile.filename    = test.log
           log4perl.appender.Logfile.max         = 5
           log4perl.appender.Logfile.DatePattern = yyyy-MM-dd
           log4perl.appender.Logfile.TZ          = PST
           log4perl.appender.Logfile.layout = \
               Log::Log4perl::Layout::PatternLayout
           log4perl.appender.Logfile.layout.ConversionPattern = %d %m %n

       Please see the "Log::Dispatch::FileRotate" documentation for details.  "Log::Dispatch::FileRotate" is
       available on CPAN.

   <b>What's</b> <b>the</b> <b>easiest</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>off</b> <b>all</b> <b>logging,</b> <b>even</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>lengthy</b> <b>Log4perl</b> <b>configuration</b> <b>file?</b>
       In addition to category-based levels and appender thresholds, Log::Log4perl supports system-wide logging
       thresholds. This is the minimum level the system will require of any logging events in order for them to
       make it through to any configured appenders.

       For example, putting the line

           log4perl.threshold = ERROR

       anywhere in your configuration file will limit any output to any appender to events with priority of
       ERROR or higher (ERROR or FATAL that is).

       However, in order to suppress all logging entirely, you need to use a priority that's higher than FATAL:
       It is simply called "OFF", and it is never used by any logger. By definition, it is higher than the
       highest defined logger level.

       Therefore, if you keep the line

           log4perl.threshold = OFF

       somewhere in your Log::Log4perl configuration, the system will be quiet as a graveyard. If you deactivate
       the line (e.g. by commenting it out), the system will, upon config reload, snap back to normal operation,
       providing logging messages according to the rest of the configuration file again.

   <b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>log</b> <b>DEBUG</b> <b>and</b> <b>above</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>and</b> <b>INFO</b> <b>and</b> <b>above</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>file?</b>
       You need one logger with two appenders attached to it:

           log4perl.logger = DEBUG, Screen, File

           log4perl.appender.Screen   = Log::Log4perl::Appender::Screen
           log4perl.appender.Screen.layout = SimpleLayout

           log4perl.appender.File   = Log::Log4perl::Appender::File
           log4perl.appender.File.filename = test.log
           log4perl.appender.File.layout = SimpleLayout
           log4perl.appender.Screen.Threshold = INFO

       Since the file logger isn't supposed to get any messages with a priority less than INFO, the appender's
       "Threshold" setting blocks those out, although the logger forwards them.

       It's a common mistake to think you can define two loggers for this, but it won't work unless those two
       loggers have different categories. If you wanted to log all DEBUG and above messages from the Foo::Bar
       module to a file and all INFO and above messages from the Quack::Schmack module to the screen, then you
       could have defined two loggers with different levels "log4perl.logger.Foo.Bar" (level INFO) and
       "log4perl.logger.Quack.Schmack" (level DEBUG) and assigned the file appender to the former and the screen
       appender to the latter. But what we wanted to accomplish was to route all messages, regardless of which
       module (or category) they came from, to both appenders. The only way to accomplish this is to define the
       root logger with the lower level (DEBUG), assign both appenders to it, and block unwanted messages at the
       file appender ("Threshold" set to INFO).

   <b>I</b> <b>keep</b> <b>getting</b> <b>duplicate</b> <b>log</b> <b>messages!</b> <b>What's</b> <b>wrong?</b>
       Having several settings for related categories in the Log4perl configuration file sometimes leads to a
       phenomenon called "message duplication". It can be very confusing at first, but if thought through
       properly, it turns out that Log4perl behaves as advertised. But, don't despair, of course there's a
       number of ways to avoid message duplication in your logs.

       Here's a sample Log4perl configuration file that produces the phenomenon:

           log4perl.logger.Cat        = ERROR, Screen
           log4perl.logger.Cat.Subcat = WARN, Screen

           log4perl.appender.Screen   = Log::Log4perl::Appender::Screen
           log4perl.appender.Screen.layout = SimpleLayout

       It defines two loggers, one for category "Cat" and one for "Cat::Subcat", which is obviously a
       subcategory of "Cat".  The parent logger has a priority setting of ERROR, the child is set to the lower
       "WARN" level.

       Now imagine the following code in your program:

           my $logger = get_logger("Cat.Subcat");
           $logger-&gt;warn("Warning!");

       What do you think will happen? An unexperienced Log4perl user might think: "Well, the message is being
       sent with level WARN, so the "Cat::Subcat" logger will accept it and forward it to the attached "Screen"
       appender. Then, the message will percolate up the logger hierarchy, find the "Cat" logger, which will
       suppress the message because of its ERROR setting."  But, perhaps surprisingly, what you'll get with the
       code snippet above is not one but two log messages written to the screen:

           WARN - Warning!
           WARN - Warning!

       What happened? The culprit is that once the logger "Cat::Subcat" decides to fire, it will forward the
       message <u>unconditionally</u> to all directly or indirectly attached appenders. The "Cat" logger will never be
       asked if it wants the message or not -- the message will just be pushed through to the appender attached
       to "Cat".

       One way to prevent the message from bubbling up the logger hierarchy is to set the "additivity" flag of
       the subordinate logger to 0:

           log4perl.logger.Cat            = ERROR, Screen
           log4perl.logger.Cat.Subcat     = WARN, Screen
           log4perl.additivity.Cat.Subcat = 0

           log4perl.appender.Screen   = Log::Log4perl::Appender::Screen
           log4perl.appender.Screen.layout = SimpleLayout

       The message will now be accepted by the "Cat::Subcat" logger, forwarded to its appender, but then
       "Cat::Subcat" will suppress any further action. While this setting avoids duplicate messages as seen
       before, it is often not the desired behavior. Messages percolating up the hierarchy are a useful Log4perl
       feature.

       If you're defining <u>different</u> appenders for the two loggers, one other option is to define an appender
       threshold for the higher-level appender. Typically it is set to be equal to the logger's level setting:

           log4perl.logger.Cat           = ERROR, Screen1
           log4perl.logger.Cat.Subcat    = WARN, Screen2

           log4perl.appender.Screen1   = Log::Log4perl::Appender::Screen
           log4perl.appender.Screen1.layout = SimpleLayout
           log4perl.appender.Screen1.Threshold = ERROR

           log4perl.appender.Screen2   = Log::Log4perl::Appender::Screen
           log4perl.appender.Screen2.layout = SimpleLayout

       Since the "Screen1" appender now blocks every message with a priority less than ERROR, even if the logger
       in charge lets it through, the message percolating up the hierarchy is being blocked at the last minute
       and <u>not</u> appended to "Screen1".

       So far, we've been operating well within the boundaries of the Log4j standard, which Log4perl adheres to.
       However, if you would really, really like to use a single appender and keep the message percolation
       intact without having to deal with message duplication, there's a non-standard solution for you:

           log4perl.logger.Cat        = ERROR, Screen
           log4perl.logger.Cat.Subcat = WARN, Screen

           log4perl.appender.Screen   = Log::Log4perl::Appender::Screen
           log4perl.appender.Screen.layout = SimpleLayout

           log4perl.oneMessagePerAppender = 1

       The "oneMessagePerAppender" flag will suppress duplicate messages to the same appender. Again, that's
       non-standard. But way cool :).

   <b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>configure</b> <b>Log::Log4perl</b> <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>me</b> <b>email</b> <b>if</b> <b>something</b> <b>happens?</b>
       Some incidents require immediate action. You can't wait until someone checks the log files, you need to
       get notified on your pager right away.

       The easiest way to do that is by using the "Log::Dispatch::Email::MailSend" module as an appender. It
       comes with the "Log::Dispatch" bundle and allows you to specify recipient and subject of outgoing emails
       in the Log4perl configuration file:

           log4perl.category = FATAL, Mailer
           log4perl.appender.Mailer         = Log::Dispatch::Email::MailSend
           log4perl.appender.Mailer.to      = <a href="mailto:drone@pageme.net">drone@pageme.net</a>
           log4perl.appender.Mailer.subject = Something's broken!
           log4perl.appender.Mailer.layout  = SimpleLayout

       The message of every log incident this appender gets will then be forwarded to the given email address.
       Check the "Log::Dispatch::Email::MailSend" documentation for details. And please make sure there's not a
       flood of email messages sent out by your application, filling up the recipient's inbox.

       There's one caveat you need to know about: The "Log::Dispatch::Email" hierarchy of appenders turns on
       <u>buffering</u> by default. This means that the appender will not send out messages right away but wait until a
       certain threshold has been reached. If you'd rather have your alerts sent out immediately, use

           log4perl.appender.Mailer.buffered = 0

       to turn buffering off.

   <b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>write</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>appender?</b>
       First off, Log::Log4perl comes with a set of standard appenders. Then, there's a lot of
       Log4perl-compatible appenders already available on CPAN: Just run a search for "Log::Dispatch" on
       <a href="http://search.cpan.org">http://search.cpan.org</a> and chances are that what you're looking for has already been developed, debugged
       and been used successfully in production -- no need for you to reinvent the wheel.

       Also, Log::Log4perl ships with a nifty database appender named Log::Log4perl::Appender::DBI -- check it
       out if talking to databases is your desire.

       But if you're up for a truly exotic task, you might have to write an appender yourself. That's very easy
       -- it takes no longer than a couple of minutes.

       Say, we wanted to create an appender of the class "ColorScreenAppender", which logs messages to the
       screen in a configurable color. Just create a new class in "ColorScreenAppender.pm":

           package ColorScreenAppender;

       Now let's assume that your Log::Log4perl configuration file "test.conf" looks like this:

           log4perl.logger = INFO, ColorApp

           log4perl.appender.ColorApp=ColorScreenAppender
           log4perl.appender.ColorApp.color=blue

           log4perl.appender.ColorApp.layout = PatternLayout
           log4perl.appender.ColorApp.layout.ConversionPattern=%d %m %n

       This will cause Log::Log4perl on "init()" to look for a class ColorScreenAppender and call its
       constructor <b>new()</b>. Let's add <b>new()</b> to ColorScreenAppender.pm:

           sub new {
               my($class, %options) = @_;

               my $self = { %options };
               bless $self, $class;

               return $self;
           }

       To initialize this appender, Log::Log4perl will call and pass all attributes of the appender as defined
       in the configuration file to the constructor as name/value pairs (in this case just one):

           ColorScreenAppender-&gt;new(color =&gt; "blue");

       The <b>new()</b> method listed above stores the contents of the %options hash in the object's instance data hash
       (referred to by $self).  That's all for initializing a new appender with Log::Log4perl.

       Second, ColorScreenAppender needs to expose a "log()" method, which will be called by Log::Log4perl every
       time it thinks the appender should fire. Along with the object reference (as usual in Perl's object
       world), <b>log()</b> will receive a list of name/value pairs, of which only the one under the key "message"
       shall be of interest for now since it is the message string to be logged. At this point, Log::Log4perl
       has already taken care of joining the message to be a single string.

       For our special appender ColorScreenAppender, we're using the Term::ANSIColor module to colorize the
       output:

           use Term::ANSIColor;

           sub log {
               my($self, %params) = @_;

               print colored($params{message},
                             $self-&gt;{color});
           }

       The color (as configured in the Log::Log4perl configuration file) is available as $self-&gt;{color} in the
       appender object. Don't forget to return

           1;

       at the end of ColorScreenAppender.pm and you're done. Install the new appender somewhere where perl can
       find it and try it with a test script like

           use Log::Log4perl qw(:easy);
           Log::Log4perl-&gt;init("test.conf");
           ERROR("blah");

       to see the new colored output. Is this cool or what?

       And it gets even better: You can write dynamically generated appender classes using the
       "Class::Prototyped" module. Here's an example of an appender prepending every outgoing message with a
       configurable number of bullets:

           use Class::Prototyped;

           my $class = Class::Prototyped-&gt;newPackage(
             "MyAppenders::Bulletizer",
             bullets =&gt; 1,
             log     =&gt; sub {
               my($self, %params) = @_;
               print "*" x $self-&gt;bullets(),
                     $params{message};
             },
           );

           use Log::Log4perl qw(:easy);

           Log::Log4perl-&gt;init(\ q{
             log4perl.logger = INFO, Bully

             log4perl.appender.Bully=MyAppenders::Bulletizer
             log4perl.appender.Bully.bullets=3

             log4perl.appender.Bully.layout = PatternLayout
             log4perl.appender.Bully.layout.ConversionPattern=%m %n
           });

               # ... prints: "***Boo!\n";
           INFO "Boo!";

   <b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>drill</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>references</b> <b>before</b> <b>logging</b> <b>them?</b>
       If you've got a reference to a nested structure or object, then you probably don't want to log it as
       "<a href="../man0x81141d4/HASH.0x81141d4.html">HASH</a>(0x81141d4)" but rather dump it as something like

           $VAR1 = {
                     'a' =&gt; 'b',
                     'd' =&gt; 'e'
                   };

       via a module like Data::Dumper. While it's syntactically correct to say

           $logger-&gt;debug(Data::Dumper::Dumper($ref));

       this call imposes a huge performance penalty on your application if the message is suppressed by
       Log::Log4perl, because Data::Dumper will perform its expensive operations in any case, because it doesn't
       know that its output will be thrown away immediately.

       As of Log::Log4perl 0.28, there's a better way: Use the message output filter format as in

           $logger-&gt;debug( {filter =&gt; \&amp;Data::Dumper::Dumper,
                            value  =&gt; $ref} );

       and Log::Log4perl won't call the filter function unless the message really gets written out to an
       appender. Just make sure to pass the whole slew as a reference to a hash specifying a filter function (as
       a sub reference) under the key "filter" and the value to be passed to the filter function in "value").
       When it comes to logging, Log::Log4perl will call the filter function, pass the "value" as an argument
       and log the return value.  Saves you serious cycles.

   <b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>collect</b> <b>all</b> <b>FATAL</b> <b>messages</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>extra</b> <b>log</b> <b>file?</b>
       Suppose you have employed Log4perl all over your system and you've already activated logging in various
       subsystems. On top of that, without disrupting any other settings, how can you collect all FATAL messages
       all over the system and send them to a separate log file?

       If you define a root logger like this:

           log4perl.logger                  = FATAL, File
           log4perl.appender.File           = Log::Log4perl::Appender::File
           log4perl.appender.File.filename  = /tmp/fatal.txt
           log4perl.appender.File.layout    = PatternLayout
           log4perl.appender.File.layout.ConversionPattern= %d %m %n
               # !!! Something's missing ...

       you'll be surprised to not only receive all FATAL messages issued anywhere in the system, but also
       everything else -- gazillions of ERROR, WARN, INFO and even DEBUG messages will end up in your fatal.txt
       logfile!  Reason for this is Log4perl's (or better: Log4j's) appender additivity.  Once a lower-level
       logger decides to fire, the message is going to be forwarded to all appenders upstream -- without further
       priority checks with their attached loggers.

       There's a way to prevent this, however: If your appender defines a minimum threshold, only messages of
       this priority or higher are going to be logged. So, just add

           log4perl.appender.File.Threshold = FATAL

       to the configuration above, and you'll get what you wanted in the first place: An overall system FATAL
       message collector.

   <b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>bundle</b> <b>several</b> <b>log</b> <b>messages</b> <b>into</b> <b>one?</b>
       Would you like to tally the messages arriving at your appender and dump out a summary once they're
       exceeding a certain threshold?  So that something like

           $logger-&gt;error("Blah");
           $logger-&gt;error("Blah");
           $logger-&gt;error("Blah");

       won't be logged as

           Blah
           Blah
           Blah

       but as

           [3] Blah

       instead? If you'd like to hold off on logging a message until it has been sent a couple of times, you can
       roll that out by creating a buffered appender.

       Let's define a new appender like

           package TallyAppender;

           sub new {
               my($class, %options) = @_;

               my $self = { maxcount =&gt; 5,
                            %options
                          };

               bless $self, $class;

               $self-&gt;{last_message}        = "";
               $self-&gt;{last_message_count}  = 0;

               return $self;
           }

       with two additional instance variables "last_message" and "last_message_count", storing the content of
       the last message sent and a counter of how many times this has happened. Also, it features a
       configuration parameter "maxcount" which defaults to 5 in the snippet above but can be set in the
       Log4perl configuration file like this:

           log4perl.logger = INFO, A
           log4perl.appender.A=TallyAppender
           log4perl.appender.A.maxcount = 3

       The main tallying logic lies in the appender's "log" method, which is called every time Log4perl thinks a
       message needs to get logged by our appender:

           sub log {
               my($self, %params) = @_;

                   # Message changed? Print buffer.
               if($self-&gt;{last_message} and
                  $params{message} ne $self-&gt;{last_message}) {
                   print "[$self-&gt;{last_message_count}]: " .
                         "$self-&gt;{last_message}";
                   $self-&gt;{last_message_count} = 1;
                   $self-&gt;{last_message} = $params{message};
                   return;
               }

               $self-&gt;{last_message_count}++;
               $self-&gt;{last_message} = $params{message};

                   # Threshold exceeded? Print, reset counter
               if($self-&gt;{last_message_count} &gt;=
                  $self-&gt;{maxcount}) {
                   print "[$self-&gt;{last_message_count}]: " .
                         "$params{message}";
                   $self-&gt;{last_message_count} = 0;
                   $self-&gt;{last_message}       = "";
                   return;
               }
           }

       We basically just check if the oncoming message in $param{message} is equal to what we've saved before in
       the "last_message" instance variable. If so, we're increasing "last_message_count".  We print the message
       in two cases: If the new message is different than the buffered one, because then we need to dump the old
       stuff and store the new. Or, if the counter exceeds the threshold, as defined by the "maxcount"
       configuration parameter.

       Please note that the appender always gets the fully rendered message and just compares it as a whole --
       so if there's a date/timestamp in there, that might confuse your logic. You can work around this by
       specifying %m %n as a layout and add the date later on in the appender. Or, make the comparison smart
       enough to omit the date.

       At last, don't forget what happens if the program is being shut down.  If there's still messages in the
       buffer, they should be printed out at that point. That's easy to do in the appender's DESTROY method,
       which gets called at object destruction time:

           sub DESTROY {
               my($self) = @_;

               if($self-&gt;{last_message_count}) {
                   print "[$self-&gt;{last_message_count}]: " .
                         "$self-&gt;{last_message}";
                   return;
               }
           }

       This will ensure that none of the buffered messages are lost.  Happy buffering!

   <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>log</b> <b>ERROR</b> <b>and</b> <b>WARN</b> <b>messages</b> <b>to</b> <b>different</b> <b>files!</b> <b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>that?</b>
       Let's assume you wanted to have each logging statement written to a different file, based on the
       statement's priority. Messages with priority "WARN" are supposed to go to "/tmp/app.warn", events
       prioritized as "ERROR" should end up in "/tmp/app.error".

       Now, if you define two appenders "AppWarn" and "AppError" and assign them both to the root logger,
       messages bubbling up from any loggers below will be logged by both appenders because of Log4perl's
       message propagation feature. If you limit their exposure via the appender threshold mechanism and set
       "AppWarn"'s threshold to "WARN" and "AppError"'s to "ERROR", you'll still get "ERROR" messages in
       "AppWarn", because "AppWarn"'s "WARN" setting will just filter out messages with a <u>lower</u> priority than
       "WARN" -- "ERROR" is higher and will be allowed to pass through.

       What we need for this is a Log4perl <u>Custom</u> <u>Filter</u>, available with Log::Log4perl 0.30.

       Both appenders need to verify that the priority of the oncoming messages exactly <u>matches</u> the priority the
       appender is supposed to log messages of. To accomplish this task, let's define two custom filters,
       "MatchError" and "MatchWarn", which, when attached to their appenders, will limit messages passed on to
       them to those matching a given priority:

           log4perl.logger = WARN, AppWarn, AppError

               # Filter to match level ERROR
           log4perl.filter.MatchError = Log::Log4perl::Filter::LevelMatch
           log4perl.filter.MatchError.LevelToMatch  = ERROR
           log4perl.filter.MatchError.AcceptOnMatch = true

               # Filter to match level WARN
           log4perl.filter.MatchWarn  = Log::Log4perl::Filter::LevelMatch
           log4perl.filter.MatchWarn.LevelToMatch  = WARN
           log4perl.filter.MatchWarn.AcceptOnMatch = true

               # Error appender
           log4perl.appender.AppError = Log::Log4perl::Appender::File
           log4perl.appender.AppError.filename = /tmp/app.err
           log4perl.appender.AppError.layout   = SimpleLayout
           log4perl.appender.AppError.Filter   = MatchError

               # Warning appender
           log4perl.appender.AppWarn = Log::Log4perl::Appender::File
           log4perl.appender.AppWarn.filename = /tmp/app.warn
           log4perl.appender.AppWarn.layout   = SimpleLayout
           log4perl.appender.AppWarn.Filter   = MatchWarn

       The appenders "AppWarn" and "AppError" defined above are logging to "/tmp/app.warn" and "/tmp/app.err"
       respectively and have the custom filters "MatchWarn" and "MatchError" attached.  This setup will direct
       all WARN messages, issued anywhere in the system, to /tmp/app.warn (and ERROR messages to /tmp/app.error)
       -- without any overlaps.

   <b>On</b> <b>our</b> <b>server</b> <b>farm,</b> <b>Log::Log4perl</b> <b>configuration</b> <b>files</b> <b>differ</b> <b>slightly</b> <b>from</b> <b>host</b> <b>to</b> <b>host.</b> <b>Can</b> <b>I</b> <b>roll</b> <b>them</b> <b>all</b>
       <b>into</b> <b>one?</b>
       You sure can, because Log::Log4perl allows you to specify attribute values dynamically. Let's say that
       one of your appenders expects the host's IP address as one of its attributes. Now, you could certainly
       roll out different configuration files for every host and specify the value like

           log4perl.appender.MyAppender    = Log::Log4perl::Appender::SomeAppender
           log4perl.appender.MyAppender.ip = 10.0.0.127

       but that's a maintenance nightmare. Instead, you can have Log::Log4perl figure out the IP address at
       configuration time and set the appender's value correctly:

               # Set the IP address dynamically
           log4perl.appender.MyAppender    = Log::Log4perl::Appender::SomeAppender
           log4perl.appender.MyAppender.ip = sub { \
              use Sys::Hostname; \
              use Socket; \
              return inet_ntoa(scalar gethostbyname hostname); \
           }

       If Log::Log4perl detects that an attribute value starts with something like "sub {...", it will interpret
       it as a perl subroutine which is to be executed once at configuration time (not runtime!) and its return
       value is to be used as the attribute value. This comes in handy for rolling out applications where
       Log::Log4perl configuration files show small host-specific differences, because you can deploy the
       unmodified application distribution on all instances of the server farm.

   <b>Log4perl</b> <b>doesn't</b> <b>interpret</b> <b>my</b> <b>backslashes</b> <b>correctly!</b>
       If you're using Log4perl's feature to specify the configuration as a string in your program (as opposed
       to a separate configuration file), chances are that you've written it like this:

           # *** WRONG! ***

           Log::Log4perl-&gt;init( \ &lt;&lt;END_HERE);
               log4perl.logger = WARN, A1
               log4perl.appender.A1 = Log::Log4perl::Appender::Screen
               log4perl.appender.A1.layout = \
                   Log::Log4perl::Layout::PatternLayout
               log4perl.appender.A1.layout.ConversionPattern = %m%n
           END_HERE

           # *** WRONG! ***

       and you're getting the following error message:

           Layout not specified for appender A1 at .../Config.pm line 342.

       What's wrong? The problem is that you're using a here-document with substitution enabled ("&lt;&lt;END_HERE")
       and that Perl won't interpret backslashes at line-ends as continuation characters but will essentially
       throw them out. So, in the code above, the layout line will look like

           log4perl.appender.A1.layout =

       to Log::Log4perl which causes it to report an error. To interpret the backslash at the end of the line
       correctly as a line-continuation character, use the non-interpreting mode of the here-document like in

           # *** RIGHT! ***

           Log::Log4perl-&gt;init( \ &lt;&lt;'END_HERE');
               log4perl.logger = WARN, A1
               log4perl.appender.A1 = Log::Log4perl::Appender::Screen
               log4perl.appender.A1.layout = \
                   Log::Log4perl::Layout::PatternLayout
               log4perl.appender.A1.layout.ConversionPattern = %m%n
           END_HERE

           # *** RIGHT! ***

       (note the single quotes around 'END_HERE') or use "q{...}" instead of a here-document and Perl will treat
       the backslashes at line-end as intended.

   <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>suppress</b> <b>certain</b> <b>messages</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>content!</b>
       Let's assume you've plastered all your functions with Log4perl statements like

           sub some_func {

               INFO("Begin of function");

               # ... Stuff happens here ...

               INFO("End of function");
           }

       to issue two log messages, one at the beginning and one at the end of each function. Now you want to
       suppress the message at the beginning and only keep the one at the end, what can you do? You can't use
       the category mechanism, because both messages are issued from the same package.

       Log::Log4perl's custom filters (0.30 or better) provide an interface for the Log4perl user to step in
       right before a message gets logged and decide if it should be written out or suppressed, based on the
       message content or other parameters:

           use Log::Log4perl qw(:easy);

           Log::Log4perl::init( \ &lt;&lt;'EOT' );
               log4perl.logger             = INFO, A1
               log4perl.appender.A1        = Log::Log4perl::Appender::Screen
               log4perl.appender.A1.layout = \
                   Log::Log4perl::Layout::PatternLayout
               log4perl.appender.A1.layout.ConversionPattern = %m%n

               log4perl.filter.M1 = Log::Log4perl::Filter::StringMatch
               log4perl.filter.M1.StringToMatch = Begin
               log4perl.filter.M1.AcceptOnMatch = false

               log4perl.appender.A1.Filter = M1
       EOT

       The last four statements in the configuration above are defining a custom filter "M1" of type
       "Log::Log4perl::Filter::StringMatch", which comes with Log4perl right out of the box and allows you to
       define a text pattern to match (as a perl regular expression) and a flag "AcceptOnMatch" indicating if a
       match is supposed to suppress the message or let it pass through.

       The last line then assigns this filter to the "A1" appender, which will call it every time it receives a
       message to be logged and throw all messages out <u>not</u> matching the regular expression "Begin".

       Instead of using the standard "Log::Log4perl::Filter::StringMatch" filter, you can define your own,
       simply using a perl subroutine:

           log4perl.filter.ExcludeBegin  = sub { !/Begin/ }
           log4perl.appender.A1.Filter   = ExcludeBegin

       For details on custom filters, check Log::Log4perl::Filter.

   <b>My</b> <b>new</b> <b>module</b> <b>uses</b> <b>Log4perl</b> <b>--</b> <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>calling</b> <b>program</b> <b>didn't</b> <b>configure</b> <b>it?</b>
       If a Perl module uses Log::Log4perl, it will typically rely on the calling program to initialize it. If
       it is using Log::Log4perl in ":easy" mode, like in

           package MyMod;
           use Log::Log4perl qw(:easy);

           sub foo {
               DEBUG("In foo");
           }

           1;

       and the calling program doesn't initialize Log::Log4perl at all (e.g. because it has no clue that it's
       available), Log::Log4perl will silently ignore all logging messages. However, if the module is using
       Log::Log4perl in regular mode like in

           package MyMod;
           use Log::Log4perl qw(get_logger);

           sub foo {
               my $logger = get_logger("");
               $logger-&gt;debug("blah");
           }

           1;

       and the main program is just using the module like in

           use MyMode;
           MyMode::foo();

       then Log::Log4perl will also ignore all logging messages but issue a warning like

           Log4perl: Seems like no initialization happened.
           Forgot to call init()?

       (only once!) to remind novice users to not forget to initialize the logging system before using it.
       However, if you want to suppress this message, just add the ":nowarn" target to the module's "use
       Log::Log4perl" call:

           use Log::Log4perl qw(get_logger :nowarn);

       This will have Log::Log4perl silently ignore all logging statements if no initialization has taken place.
       If, instead of using <b>init()</b>, you're using Log4perl's API to define loggers and appenders, the same
       notification happens if no call to <b>add_appenders()</b> is made, i.e. no appenders are defined.

       If the module wants to figure out if some other program part has already initialized Log::Log4perl, it
       can do so by calling

           Log::Log4perl::initialized()

       which will return a true value in case Log::Log4perl has been initialized and a false value if not.

   <b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>synchronize</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>appender?</b>
       If you're using the same instance of an appender in multiple processes, and each process is passing on
       messages to the appender in parallel, you might end up with overlapping log entries.

       Typical scenarios include a file appender that you create in the main program, and which will then be
       shared between the parent and a forked child process. Or two separate processes, each initializing a
       Log4perl file appender on the same logfile.

       Log::Log4perl won't synchronize access to the shared logfile by default. Depending on your operating
       system's flush mechanism, buffer size and the size of your messages, there's a small chance of an
       overlap.

       The easiest way to prevent overlapping messages in logfiles written to by multiple processes is setting
       the file appender's "syswrite" flag along with a file write mode of "append".  This makes sure that
       "Log::Log4perl::Appender::File" uses "syswrite()" (which is guaranteed to run uninterrupted) instead of
       "print()" which might buffer the message or get interrupted by the OS while it is writing. And in
       "append" mode, the OS kernel ensures that multiple processes share one end-of-file marker, ensuring that
       each process writes to the <u>real</u> end of the file. (The value of "append" for the "mode" parameter is the
       default setting in Log4perl's file appender so you don't have to set it explicitly.)

             # Guarantees atomic writes

           log4perl.category.Bar.Twix          = WARN, Logfile

           log4perl.appender.Logfile           = Log::Log4perl::Appender::File
           log4perl.appender.Logfile.mode      = append
           log4perl.appender.Logfile.syswrite  = 1
           log4perl.appender.Logfile.filename  = test.log
           log4perl.appender.Logfile.layout    = SimpleLayout

       Another guaranteed way of having messages separated with any kind of appender is putting a
       Log::Log4perl::Appender::Synchronized composite appender in between Log::Log4perl and the real appender.
       It will make sure to let messages pass through this virtual gate one by one only.

       Here's a sample configuration to synchronize access to a file appender:

           log4perl.category.Bar.Twix          = WARN, Syncer

           log4perl.appender.Logfile           = Log::Log4perl::Appender::File
           log4perl.appender.Logfile.autoflush = 1
           log4perl.appender.Logfile.filename  = test.log
           log4perl.appender.Logfile.layout    = SimpleLayout

           log4perl.appender.Syncer            = Log::Log4perl::Appender::Synchronized
           log4perl.appender.Syncer.appender   = Logfile

       "Log::Log4perl::Appender::Synchronized" uses the "IPC::Shareable" module and its semaphores, which will
       slow down writing the log messages, but ensures sequential access featuring atomic checks.  Check
       Log::Log4perl::Appender::Synchronized for details.

   <b>Can</b> <b>I</b> <b>use</b> <b>Log::Log4perl</b> <b>with</b> <b>log4j's</b> <b>Chainsaw?</b>
       Yes, Log::Log4perl can be configured to send its events to log4j's graphical log UI <u>Chainsaw</u>.

       Here's how it works:

       •   Get  Guido  Carls'  &lt;<a href="mailto:gcarls@cpan.org">gcarls@cpan.org</a>&gt; Log::Log4perl extension "Log::Log4perl::Layout::XMLLayout" from
           CPAN and install it:

               perl -MCPAN -eshell
               cpan&gt; install Log::Log4perl::Layout::XMLLayout

       •   Install  and   start   Chainsaw,   which   is   part   of   the   "log4j"   distribution   now   (see
           <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/log4j">http://jakarta.apache.org/log4j</a> ). Create a configuration file like

             &lt;log4j:configuration debug="true"&gt;
               &lt;plugin name="XMLSocketReceiver"
                       class="org.apache.log4j.net.XMLSocketReceiver"&gt;
                 &lt;param name="decoder" value="org.apache.log4j.xml.XMLDecoder"/&gt;
                 &lt;param name="Port" value="4445"/&gt;
               &lt;/plugin&gt;
               &lt;root&gt; &lt;level value="debug"/&gt; &lt;<a href="file:/root">/root</a>&gt;
             &lt;/log4j:configuration&gt;

           and name it e.g. "config.xml". Then start Chainsaw like

             java -Dlog4j.debug=true -Dlog4j.configuration=config.xml \
               -classpath ".:log4j-1.3alpha.jar:log4j-chainsaw-1.3alpha.jar" \
               org.apache.log4j.chainsaw.LogUI

           and watch the GUI coming up.

       •   Configure  Log::Log4perl  to use a socket appender with an XMLLayout, pointing to the host/port where
           Chainsaw (as configured above) is waiting with its XMLSocketReceiver:

             use Log::Log4perl qw(get_logger);
             use Log::Log4perl::Layout::XMLLayout;

             my $conf = q(
               log4perl.category.Bar.Twix          = WARN, Appender
               log4perl.appender.Appender          = Log::Log4perl::Appender::Socket
               log4perl.appender.Appender.PeerAddr = localhost
               log4perl.appender.Appender.PeerPort = 4445
               log4perl.appender.Appender.layout   = Log::Log4perl::Layout::XMLLayout
             );

             Log::Log4perl::init(\$conf);

               # Nasty hack to suppress encoding header
             my $app = Log::Log4perl::appenders-&gt;{"Appender"};
             $app-&gt;layout()-&gt;{enc_set} = 1;

             my $logger = get_logger("Bar.Twix");
             $logger-&gt;error("One");

           The nasty hack shown in the code  snippet  above  is  currently  (October  2003)  necessary,  because
           Chainsaw expects XML messages to arrive in a format like

             &lt;log4j:event logger="Bar.Twix"
                          timestamp="1066794904310"
                          level="ERROR"
                          thread="10567"&gt;
               &lt;log4j:message&gt;&lt;![CDATA[Two]]&gt;&lt;/log4j:message&gt;
               &lt;log4j:NDC&gt;&lt;![CDATA[undef]]&gt;&lt;/log4j:NDC&gt;
               &lt;log4j:locationInfo class="main"
                 method="main"
                 file="./t"
                 line="32"&gt;
               &lt;/log4j:locationInfo&gt;
             &lt;/log4j:event&gt;

           without a preceding

             &lt;?xml version = "1.0" encoding = "iso8859-1"?&gt;

           which Log::Log4perl::Layout::XMLLayout applies to the first event sent over the socket.

       See figure 1 for a screenshot of Chainsaw in action, receiving events from the Perl script shown above.

       Many thanks to Chainsaw's Scott Deboy &lt;<a href="mailto:sdeboy@comotivsystems.com">sdeboy@comotivsystems.com</a>&gt; for his support!

   <b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>run</b> <b>Log::Log4perl</b> <b>under</b> <b>mod_perl?</b>
       In  persistent  environments it's important to play by the rules outlined in section "Initialize once and
       only once" in Log::Log4perl.  If you haven't read this yet, please go ahead and read it right  now.  It's
       very important.

       And no matter if you use a startup handler to <b>init()</b> Log::Log4perl or use the <b>init_once()</b> strategy (added
       in 0.42), either way you're very likely to have unsynchronized writes to logfiles.

       If  Log::Log4perl  is  configured  with a log file appender, and it is initialized via the Apache startup
       handler, the file handle created initially will be shared among all Apache processes. Similarly, with the
       <b>init_once()</b> approach: although every process has a separate L4p configuration, processes are gonna  share
       the appender file <u>names</u> instead, effectively opening several different file handles on the same file.

       Now,  having several appenders using the same file handle or having several appenders logging to the same
       file unsynchronized, this might result in overlapping messages. Sometimes, this is  acceptable.  If  it's
       not, here's two strategies:

       •   Use  the Log::Log4perl::Appender::Synchronized appender to connect to your file appenders. Here's the
           writeup: <a href="http://log4perl.sourceforge.net/releases/Log-Log4perl/docs/html/Log/Log4perl/FAQ.html">http://log4perl.sourceforge.net/releases/Log-Log4perl/docs/html/Log/Log4perl/FAQ.html</a>#23804

       •   Use a different logfile for every process like in

                #log4perl.conf
                ...
                log4perl.appender.A1.filename = sub { "mylog.$$.log" }

   <b>My</b> <b>program</b> <b>already</b> <b>uses</b> <b>warn()</b> <b>and</b> <b>die().</b> <b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>switch</b> <b>to</b> <b>Log4perl?</b>
       If your program already uses Perl's "warn()" function to spew  out  error  messages  and  you'd  like  to
       channel  those  into  the  Log4perl  world, just define a "__WARN__" handler where your program or module
       resides:

           use Log::Log4perl qw(:easy);

           $SIG{__WARN__} = sub {
               local $Log::Log4perl::caller_depth =
                   $Log::Log4perl::caller_depth + 1;
               WARN @_;
           };

       Why the "local"  setting  of  $Log::Log4perl::caller_depth?   If  you  leave  that  out,  "PatternLayout"
       conversion specifiers like %M or %F (printing the current function/method and source filename) will refer
       to  where  the  __WARN__  handler  resides, not the environment Perl's "warn()" function was issued from.
       Increasing "caller_depth" adjusts for this offset. Having it "local", makes sure the level gets set  back
       after the handler exits.

       Once done, if your program does something like

           sub some_func {
               warn "Here's a warning";
           }

       you'll get (depending on your Log::Log4perl configuration) something like

           2004/02/19 20:41:02-main::some_func: Here's a warning at ./t line 25.

       in  the  appropriate  appender instead of having a screen full of STDERR messages. It also works with the
       "Carp" module and its "carp()" and "cluck()" functions.

       If, on the other hand, catching "die()" and friends is required, a "__DIE__" handler is appropriate:

           $SIG{__DIE__} = sub {
               if($^S) {
                   # We're in an eval {} and don't want log
                   # this message but catch it later
                   return;
               }
               local $Log::Log4perl::caller_depth =
                   $Log::Log4perl::caller_depth + 1;
               LOGDIE @_;
           };

       This will call Log4perl's "LOGDIE()" function,  which  will  log  a  fatal  error  and  then  call  <b>die()</b>
       internally,  causing  the  program  to  exit.  Works equally well with "Carp"'s "croak()" and "confess()"
       functions.

   <b>Some</b> <b>module</b> <b>prints</b> <b>messages</b> <b>to</b> <b>STDERR.</b> <b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>funnel</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>Log::Log4perl?</b>
       If a module you're using doesn't use Log::Log4perl but prints logging messages to STDERR instead, like

           ########################################
           package IgnorantModule;
           ########################################

           sub some_method {
               print STDERR "Parbleu! An error!\n";
           }

           1;

       there's still a way to capture these messages and funnel them into Log::Log4perl, even  without  touching
       the module. What you need is a trapper module like

           ########################################
           package Trapper;
           ########################################

           use Log::Log4perl qw(:easy);

           sub TIEHANDLE {
               my $class = shift;
               bless [], $class;
           }

           sub PRINT {
               my $self = shift;
               $Log::Log4perl::caller_depth++;
               DEBUG @_;
               $Log::Log4perl::caller_depth--;
           }

           1;

       and  a  "tie"  command  in  the  main  program  to  tie  STDERR  to the trapper module along with regular
       Log::Log4perl initialization:

           ########################################
           package main;
           ########################################

           use Log::Log4perl qw(:easy);

           Log::Log4perl-&gt;easy_init(
               {level  =&gt; $DEBUG,
                file   =&gt; 'stdout',   # make sure not to use stderr here!
                layout =&gt; "%d %M: %m%n",
               });

           tie *STDERR, "Trapper";

       Make sure not to use STDERR as Log::Log4perl's file appender here (which would be the default in  ":easy"
       mode), because it would end up in an endless recursion.

       Now, calling

           IgnorantModule::some_method();

       will result in the desired output

           2004/05/06 11:13:04 IgnorantModule::some_method: Parbleu! An error!

   <b>How</b>  <b>come</b> <b>PAR</b> <b>(Perl</b> <b>Archive</b> <b>Toolkit)</b> <b>creates</b> <b>executables</b> <b>which</b> <b>then</b> <b>can't</b> <b>find</b> <b>their</b> <b>Log::Log4perl</b> <b>appenders?</b>

       If not instructed  otherwise,  "Log::Log4perl"  dynamically  pulls  in  appender  classes  found  in  its
       configuration. If you specify

           #!<a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?perl">/usr/bin/perl</a>
           # mytest.pl

           use Log::Log4perl qw(get_logger);

           my $conf = q(
             log4perl.category.Bar.Twix = WARN, Logfile
             log4perl.appender.Logfile  = Log::Log4perl::Appender::Screen
             log4perl.appender.Logfile.layout = SimpleLayout
           );

           Log::Log4perl::init(\$conf);
           my $logger = get_logger("Bar::Twix");
           $logger-&gt;error("Blah");

       then  "Log::Log4perl::Appender::Screen" will be pulled in while the program runs, not at compile time. If
       you have PAR compile the script above to an executable binary via

           pp -o mytest mytest.pl

       and then run "mytest" on a machine without having Log::Log4perl installed, you'll get  an  error  message
       like

           ERROR: can't load appenderclass 'Log::Log4perl::Appender::Screen'
           Can't locate Log/Log4perl/Appender/Screen.pm in @INC ...

       Why? At compile time, "pp" didn't realize that "Log::Log4perl::Appender::Screen" would be needed later on
       and    didn't   wrap   it   into   the   executable   created.   To   avoid   this,   either   say   "use
       Log::Log4perl::Appender::Screen" in the script explicitly or compile it with

           pp -o mytest -M Log::Log4perl::Appender::Screen mytest.pl

       to make sure the appender class gets included.

   <b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>access</b> <b>a</b> <b>custom</b> <b>appender</b> <b>defined</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>configuration?</b>
       Any appender defined in the configuration file or somewhere  in  the  code  can  be  accessed  later  via
       "Log::Log4perl-&gt;appender_by_name("appender_name")", which returns a reference of the appender object.

       Once  you've got a hold of the object, it can be queried or modified to your liking. For example, see the
       custom "IndentAppender" defined below: After calling  "init()"  to  define  the  Log4perl  settings,  the
       appender  object  is  retrieved  to  call  its  "indent_more()"  and  "indent_less()"  methods to control
       indentation of messages:

           package IndentAppender;

           sub new {
               bless { indent =&gt; 0 }, $_[0];
           }

           sub indent_more  { $_[0]-&gt;{indent}++ }
           sub indent_less  { $_[0]-&gt;{indent}-- }

           sub log {
               my($self, %params) = @_;
               print " " x $self-&gt;{indent}, $params{message};
           }

           package main;

           use Log::Log4perl qw(:easy);

           my $conf = q(
           log4perl.category          = DEBUG, Indented
           log4perl.appender.Indented = IndentAppender
           log4perl.appender.Indented.layout = Log::Log4perl::Layout::SimpleLayout
           );

           Log::Log4perl::init(\$conf);

           my $appender = Log::Log4perl-&gt;appender_by_name("Indented");

           DEBUG "No indentation";
           $appender-&gt;indent_more();
           DEBUG "One more";
           $appender-&gt;indent_more();
           DEBUG "Two more";
           $appender-&gt;indent_less();
           DEBUG "One less";

       As you would expect, this will print

           DEBUG - No indentation
            DEBUG - One more
             DEBUG - Two more
            DEBUG - One less

       because the very appender used by Log4perl is modified dynamically at runtime.

   <b>I</b> <b>don't</b> <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>Log::Log4perl</b> <b>is</b> <b>installed.</b> <b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>prepare</b> <b>my</b> <b>script?</b>
       In case your script needs to be prepared  for  environments  that  may  or  may  not  have  Log::Log4perl
       installed, there's a trick.

       If  you  put  the  following  BEGIN  blocks at the top of the program, you'll be able to use the <b>DEBUG()</b>,
       <b>INFO()</b>, etc. macros in Log::Log4perl's ":easy"  mode.   If  Log::Log4perl  is  installed  in  the  target
       environment,  the  regular  Log::Log4perl rules apply. If not, all of <b>DEBUG()</b>, <b>INFO()</b>, etc. are "stubbed"
       out, i.e. they turn into no-ops:

           use warnings;
           use strict;

           BEGIN {
               eval { require Log::Log4perl; };

               if($@) {
                   print "Log::Log4perl not installed - stubbing.\n";
                   no strict qw(refs);
                   *{"main::$_"} = sub { } for qw(DEBUG INFO WARN ERROR FATAL);
               } else {
                   no warnings;
                   print "Log::Log4perl installed - life is good.\n";
                   require Log::Log4perl::Level;
                   Log::Log4perl::Level-&gt;import(__PACKAGE__);
                   Log::Log4perl-&gt;import(qw(:easy));
                   Log::Log4perl-&gt;easy_init($main::DEBUG);
               }
           }

               # The regular script begins ...
           DEBUG "Hey now!";

       This snippet will first probe for Log::Log4perl, and if it can't be found, it will alias <b>DEBUG()</b>, <b>INFO()</b>,
       with empty subroutines via typeglobs.  If Log::Log4perl is  available,  its  level  constants  are  first
       imported ($DEBUG, $INFO, etc.) and then "easy_init()" gets called to initialize the logging system.

   <b>Can</b> <b>file</b> <b>appenders</b> <b>create</b> <b>files</b> <b>with</b> <b>different</b> <b>permissions?</b>
       Typically,  when  "Log::Log4perl::Appender::File"  creates  a  new  file,  its  permissions  are  set  to
       "rw-r--r--". Why? Because your environment's <u>umask</u> most likely defaults  to  0022,  that's  the  standard
       setting.

       What's  a  <u>umask</u>,  you're  asking? It's a template that's applied to the permissions of all newly created
       files. While calls like "open(FILE, "&gt;foo")" will always try to create files in "rw-rw-rw-  "  mode,  the
       system  will  apply  the current <u>umask</u> template to determine the final permission setting. <u>umask</u> is a bit
       mask that's inverted and then applied to the requested permission setting, using a bitwise AND:

           $request_permission &amp;~ $umask

       So, a <u>umask</u> setting of 0000 (the leading 0  simply  indicates  an  octal  value)  will  create  files  in
       "rw-rw-rw-" mode, a setting of 0277 will use "r--------", and the standard 0022 will use "rw-r--r--".

       As an example, if you want your log files to be created with "rw-r--rw-" permissions, use a <u>umask</u> of 0020
       before calling Log::Log4perl-&gt;<b>init()</b>:

           use Log::Log4perl;

           umask 0020;
               # Creates log.out in rw-r--rw mode
           Log::Log4perl-&gt;init(\ q{
               log4perl.logger = WARN, File
               log4perl.appender.File = Log::Log4perl::Appender::File
               log4perl.appender.File.filename = log.out
               log4perl.appender.File.layout = SimpleLayout
           });

   <b>Using</b> <b>Log4perl</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>END</b> <b>block</b> <b>causes</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem!</b>
       It's not easy to get to this error, but if you write something like

           END { Log::Log4perl::get_logger()-&gt;debug("Hey there."); }

           use Log::Log4perl qw(:easy);
           Log::Log4perl-&gt;easy_init($DEBUG);

       it  won't  work.  The reason is that "Log::Log4perl" defines an END block that cleans up all loggers. And
       perl will run END blocks in the reverse order as they're encountered in the  compile  phase,  so  in  the
       scenario above, the END block will run <u>after</u> Log4perl has cleaned up its loggers.

       Placing END blocks using Log4perl <u>after</u> a "use Log::Log4perl" statement fixes the problem:

           use Log::Log4perl qw(:easy);
           Log::Log4perl-&gt;easy_init($DEBUG);

           END { Log::Log4perl::get_logger()-&gt;debug("Hey there."); }

       In this scenario, the shown END block is executed <u>before</u> Log4perl cleans up and the debug message will be
       processed properly.

   <b>Help!</b> <b>My</b> <b>appender</b> <b>is</b> <b>throwing</b> <b>a</b> <b>"Wide</b> <b>character</b> <b>in</b> <b>print"</b> <b>warning!</b>
       This  warning shows up when Unicode strings are printed without precautions. The warning goes away if the
       complaining appender is set to utf-8 mode:

             # Either in the log4perl configuration file:
         log4perl.appender.Logfile.filename = test.log
         log4perl.appender.Logfile.utf8     = 1

             # Or, in easy mode:
         Log::Log4perl-&gt;easy_init( {
           level =&gt; $DEBUG,
           file  =&gt; ":utf8&gt; test.log"
         } );

       If the complaining appender is a screen appender, set its "utf8" option:

             log4perl.appender.Screen.stderr = 1
             log4perl.appender.Screen.utf8   = 1

       Alternatively, "binmode" does the trick:

             # Either STDOUT ...
           binmode(STDOUT, ":utf8);

             # ... or STDERR.
           binmode(STDERR, ":utf8);

       Some background on this: Perl's strings are either byte strings or Unicode  strings.  "Mike"  is  a  byte
       string.   "\x{30DE}\x{30A4}\x{30AF}"  is  a  Unicode string. Unicode strings are marked specially and are
       UTF-8 encoded internally.

       If you print a byte string to STDOUT, all is well, because  STDOUT  is  by  default  set  to  byte  mode.
       However,  if  you  print a Unicode string to STDOUT without precautions, "perl" will try to transform the
       Unicode string back to a byte string before printing it out. This is troublesome if  the  Unicode  string
       contains 'wide' characters which can't be represented in Latin-1.

       For example, if you create a Unicode string with three japanese Katakana characters as in

           perl -le 'print "\x{30DE}\x{30A4}\x{30AF}"'

       (coincidentally pronounced Ma-i-ku, the japanese pronunciation of "Mike"), STDOUT is in byte mode and the
       warning

           Wide character in print at ./script.pl line 14.

       appears. Setting STDOUT to UTF-8 mode as in

           perl -le 'binmode(STDOUT, ":utf8"); print "\x{30DE}\x{30A4}\x{30AF}"'

       will  silently  print the Unicode string to STDOUT in UTF-8. To see the characters printed, you'll need a
       UTF-8 terminal with a font including japanese Katakana characters.

   <b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>send</b> <b>errors</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen,</b> <b>and</b> <b>debug</b> <b>messages</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>file?</b>
       Let's assume you want to maintain a detailed DEBUG output in a file and only messages of level ERROR  and
       higher should be printed on the screen. Often times, developers come up with something like this:

            # Wrong!!!
           log4perl.logger = DEBUG, FileApp
           log4perl.logger = ERROR, ScreenApp
            # Wrong!!!

       This won't work, however. Logger definitions aren't additive, and the second statement will overwrite the
       first  one.  Log4perl  versions  below  1.04 were silently accepting this, leaving people confused why it
       wouldn't work as expected.  As of 1.04, this will throw a <u>fatal</u> <u>error</u> to notify the user of the problem.

       What you want to do instead, is this:

           log4perl.logger                    = DEBUG, FileApp, ScreenApp

           log4perl.appender.FileApp          = Log::Log4perl::Appender::File
           log4perl.appender.FileApp.filename = test.log
           log4perl.appender.FileApp.layout   = SimpleLayout

           log4perl.appender.ScreenApp          = Log::Log4perl::Appender::Screen
           log4perl.appender.ScreenApp.stderr   = 0
           log4perl.appender.ScreenApp.layout   = SimpleLayout
              ### limiting output to ERROR messages
           log4perl.appender.ScreenApp.Threshold = ERROR
              ###

       Note that without the second appender's "Threshold" setting, both appenders would  receive  all  messages
       prioritized  DEBUG  and  higher.  With  the  threshold  set to ERROR, the second appender will filter the
       messages as required.

   <b>Where</b> <b>should</b> <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> <b>logfiles?</b>
       Your log files may go anywhere you want them, but the effective user id of the calling process must  have
       write access.

       If  the  log  file  doesn't exist at program start, Log4perl's file appender will create it. For this, it
       needs write access to the directory where the new file will be located in. If the log file already exists
       at startup, the process simply needs write access to the file. Note that it will need write access to the
       file's directory if you're encountering situations where the logfile  gets  recreated,  e.g.  during  log
       rotation.

       If  Log::Log4perl  is  used  by  a  web  server  application (e.g. in a CGI script or mod_perl), then the
       webserver's user (usually "nobody" or "www") must have the permissions mentioned above.

       To prepare your web server to use log4perl, we'd recommend:

           webserver:~$ su -
           webserver:~# mkdir /var/log/cgiapps
           webserver:~# chown nobody:root /var/log/cgiapps/
           webserver:~# chown nobody:root -R /var/log/cgiapps/
           webserver:~# chmod 02755 -R /var/log/cgiapps/

       Then set your /etc/log4perl.conf file to include:

           log4perl.appender.FileAppndr1.filename =
               /var/log/cgiapps/&lt;app-name&gt;.log

   <b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>my</b> <b>file</b> <b>appender</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>disappearing</b> <b>log</b> <b>files?</b>
       The file appender that comes with Log4perl, Log::Log4perl::Appender::File, will open a specified log file
       at initialization time and will keep writing to it via a file handle.

       In case the associated file goes way, messages written by a long-running process will still be written to
       the file handle. In case the file has been moved to a different location on the  same  file  system,  the
       writer  will  keep  writing to it under the new filename. In case the file has been removed from the file
       system, the log messages will end up in nowhere land. This is not a bug in Log4perl,  this  is  how  Unix
       works. There is no error message in this case, because the writer has no idea that the file handle is not
       associated with a visible file.

       To prevent the loss of log messages when log files disappear, the file appender's "recreate" option needs
       to be set to a true value:

           log4perl.appender.Logfile.recreate = 1

       This  will instruct the file appender to check in regular intervals (default: 30 seconds) if the log file
       is still there. If it finds out that the file is missing, it will recreate it.

       Continuously checking if the log file still exists is fairly  expensive.  For  this  reason  it  is  only
       performed  every  30 seconds. To change this interval, the option "recreate_check_interval" can be set to
       the number of seconds between checks. In the extreme case where the  check  should  be  performed  before
       every write, it can even be set to 0:

           log4perl.appender.Logfile.recreate = 1
           log4perl.appender.Logfile.recreate_check_interval = 0

       To avoid having to check the file system so frequently, a signal handler can be set up:

           log4perl.appender.Logfile.recreate = 1
           log4perl.appender.Logfile.recreate_check_signal = USR1

       This  will  install  a signal handler which will recreate a missing log file immediately when it receives
       the defined signal.

       Note that the <b>init_and_watch()</b> method for Log4perl's initialization can also be instructed to  install  a
       signal handler, usually using the HUP signal. Make sure to use a different signal if you're using both of
       them at the same time.

   <b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>rotate</b> <b>a</b> <b>logfile</b> <b>with</b> <b>newsyslog?</b>
       Here's  a  few  things  that  need  to  be taken care of when using the popular log file rotating utility
       "newsyslog" (<a href="http://www.courtesan.com/newsyslog">http://www.courtesan.com/newsyslog</a>) with Log4perl's file appender in long-running processes.

       For example, with a newsyslog configuration like

           # newsyslog.conf
           /tmp/test.log 666  12  5  *  B

       and a call to

           # newsyslog -f /path/to/newsyslog.conf

       "newsyslog" will take action if "/tmp/test.log" is larger than the specified 5K in size. It will move the
       current log file "/tmp/test.log" to "/tmp/test.log.0" and create a new and empty "/tmp/test.log" with the
       specified  permissions  (this  is  why  "newsyslog"  needs  to  run  as  root).   An   already   existing
       "/tmp/test.log.0"  would  be  moved  to "/tmp/test.log.1", "/tmp/test.log.1" to "/tmp/test.log.2", and so
       forth,  for  every  one  of  a  max  number  of  12  archived  logfiles  that  have  been  configured  in
       "newsyslog.conf".

       Although  a  new  file  has  been  created,  from  Log4perl's appender's point of view, this situation is
       identical to the one described in the previous FAQ entry, labeled "How can my  file  appender  deal  with
       disappearing log files".

       To  make  sure  that log messages are written to the new log file and not to an archived one or end up in
       nowhere land, the appender's "recreate" and "recreate_check_interval" have to be configured to deal  with
       the 'disappearing' log file.

       The  situation gets interesting when "newsyslog"'s option to compress archived log files is enabled. This
       causes the original log file not to be moved, but to disappear. If the file appender isn't configured  to
       recreate  the  logfile  in  this situation, log messages will actually be lost without warning. This also
       applies for the short time frame of "recreate_check_interval" seconds in  between  the  recreator's  file
       checks.

       To make sure that no messages get lost, one option is to set the interval to

           log4perl.appender.Logfile.recreate_check_interval = 0

       However, this is fairly expensive. A better approach is to define a signal handler:

           log4perl.appender.Logfile.recreate = 1
           log4perl.appender.Logfile.recreate_check_signal  = USR1
           log4perl.appender.Logfile.recreate_pid_write = /tmp/myappid

       As  a service for "newsyslog" users, Log4perl's file appender writes the current process ID to a PID file
       specified by the "recreate_pid_write" option.  "newsyslog" then needs to be configured as in

           # newsyslog.conf configuration for compressing archive files and
           # sending a signal to the Log4perl-enabled application
           /tmp/test.log 666  12  5  *  B /tmp/myappid 30

       to send the defined signal (30, which is USR1 on FreeBSD) to the application process  at  rotation  time.
       Note  that  the  signal  number  is  different on Linux, where USR1 denotes as 10. Check "man signal" for
       details.

   <b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>a</b> <b>process</b> <b>under</b> <b>user</b> <b>id</b> <b>A</b> <b>log</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>file</b> <b>under</b> <b>user</b> <b>id</b> <b>B?</b>
       This scenario often occurs in configurations where processes run under various user IDs but need to write
       to a log file under a fixed, but different user id.

       With a traditional file appender, the log file will probably be created under one user's id and  appended
       to  under  a  different user's id. With a typical umask of 0002, the file will be created with -rw-rw-r--
       permissions. If a user who's not in the first user's group subsequently appends to the log file, it  will
       fail because of a permission problem.

       Two potential solutions come to mind:

       •   Creating  the  file  with  a umask of 0000 will allow all users to append to the log file. Log4perl's
           file appender "Log::Log4perl::Appender::File" has an "umask" option that can be set to support this:

               log4perl.appender.File = Log::Log4perl::Appender::File
               log4perl.appender.File.umask = sub { 0000 };

           This way, the log file will be created with -rw-rw-rw- permissions  and  therefore  has  world  write
           permissions. This might open up the logfile for unwanted manipulations by arbitrary users, though.

       •   Running  the  process under an effective user id of "root" will allow it to write to the log file, no
           matter who started the process.  However, this is not a good idea, because of security concerns.

       Luckily, under Unix, there's the syslog daemon which runs as  root  and  takes  log  requests  from  user
       processes over a socket and writes them to log files as configured in "/etc/syslog.conf".

       By modifying "/etc/syslog.conf" and HUPing the syslog daemon, you can configure new log files:

           # /etc/syslog.conf
           ...
           user.* /some/path/file.log

       Using  the  "Log::Dispatch::Syslog"  appender, which comes with the "Log::Log4perl" distribution, you can
       then send messages via syslog:

           use Log::Log4perl qw(:easy);

           Log::Log4perl-&gt;init(\&lt;&lt;EOT);
               log4perl.logger = DEBUG, app
               log4perl.appender.app=Log::Dispatch::Syslog
               log4perl.appender.app.Facility=user
               log4perl.appender.app.layout=SimpleLayout
           EOT

               # Writes to /some/path/file.log
           ERROR "Message!";

       This way, the syslog daemon will solve the permission problem.

       Note that while it is possible to use <b>syslog()</b>  without  Log4perl  (syslog  supports  log  levels,  too),
       traditional syslog setups have a significant drawback.

       Without  Log4perl's  ability to activate logging in only specific parts of a system, complex systems will
       trigger log events all over the place and slow down execution to a crawl at high debug levels.

       Remote-controlling logging in the hierarchical parts of an application via Log4perl's categories  is  one
       of  its most distinguished features.  It allows for enabling high debug levels in specified areas without
       noticeable performance impact.

   <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>UTC</b> <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>local</b> <b>time!</b>
       If a layout defines a date, Log::Log4perl uses local time to populate it.  If you want UTC instead, set

           log4perl.utcDateTimes = 1

       in your configuration. Alternatively, you can set

           $Log::Log4perl::DateFormat::GMTIME = 1;

       in your program before the first log statement.

   <b>Can</b> <b>Log4perl</b> <b>intercept</b> <b>messages</b> <b>written</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>filehandle?</b>
       You have a function that prints to a filehandle. You want to tie into that  filehandle  and  forward  all
       arriving messages to a Log4perl logger.

       First, let's write a package that ties a file handle and forwards it to a Log4perl logger:

           package FileHandleLogger;
           use Log::Log4perl qw(:levels get_logger);

           sub TIEHANDLE {
              my($class, %options) = @_;

              my $self = {
                  level    =&gt; $DEBUG,
                  category =&gt; '',
                  %options
              };

              $self-&gt;{logger} = get_logger($self-&gt;{category}),
              bless $self, $class;
           }

           sub PRINT {
               my($self, @rest) = @_;
               $Log::Log4perl::caller_depth++;
               $self-&gt;{logger}-&gt;log($self-&gt;{level}, @rest);
               $Log::Log4perl::caller_depth--;
           }

           sub PRINTF {
               my($self, $fmt, @rest) = @_;
               $Log::Log4perl::caller_depth++;
               $self-&gt;PRINT(sprintf($fmt, @rest));
               $Log::Log4perl::caller_depth--;
           }

           1;

       Now, if you have a function like

           sub function_printing_to_fh {
               my($fh) = @_;
               printf $fh "Hi there!\n";
           }

       which takes a filehandle and prints something to it, it can be used with Log4perl:

           use Log::Log4perl qw(:easy);
           usa FileHandleLogger;

           Log::Log4perl-&gt;easy_init($DEBUG);

           tie *SOMEHANDLE, 'FileHandleLogger' or
               die "tie failed ($!)";

           function_printing_to_fh(*SOMEHANDLE);
               # prints "2007/03/22 21:43:30 Hi there!"

       If you want, you can even specify a different log level or category:

           tie *SOMEHANDLE, 'FileHandleLogger',

   <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>multiline</b> <b>messages</b> <b>rendered</b> <b>line-by-line!</b>
       With the standard "PatternLayout", if you send a multiline message to an appender as in

           use Log::Log4perl qw(:easy);
           Log

       it gets rendered this way:

           2007/04/04 23:23:39 multi
           line
           message

       If    you    want    each    line   to   be   rendered   separately   according   to   the   layout   use
       "Log::Log4perl::Layout::PatternLayout::Multiline":

           use Log::Log4perl qw(:easy);

           Log::Log4perl-&gt;init(\&lt;&lt;EOT);
             log4perl.category         = DEBUG, Screen
             log4perl.appender.Screen = Log::Log4perl::Appender::Screen
             log4perl.appender.Screen.layout = \\
               Log::Log4perl::Layout::PatternLayout::Multiline
             log4perl.appender.Screen.layout.ConversionPattern = %d %m %n
           EOT

           DEBUG "some\nmultiline\nmessage";

       and you'll get

           2007/04/04 23:23:39 some
           2007/04/04 23:23:39 multiline
           2007/04/04 23:23:39 message

       instead.

   <b>I'm</b> <b>on</b> <b>Windows</b> <b>and</b> <b>I'm</b> <b>getting</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>'redefined'</b> <b>messages!</b>
       If you're on Windows and are getting warning messages like

         Constant subroutine Log::Log4perl::_INTERNAL_DEBUG redefined at
           C:/Programme/Perl/lib/constant.pm line 103.
         Subroutine import redefined at
           C:/Programme/Perl/site/lib/Log/Log4Perl.pm line 69.
         Subroutine initialized redefined at
           C:/Programme/Perl/site/lib/Log/Log4Perl.pm line 207.

       then chances  are  that  you're  using  'Log::Log4Perl'  (wrong  uppercase  P)  instead  of  the  correct
       'Log::Log4perl'. Perl on Windows doesn't handle this error well and spits out a slew of confusing warning
       messages. But now you know, just use the correct module name and you'll be fine.

   <b>Log4perl</b> <b>complains</b> <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>initialization</b> <b>happened</b> <b>during</b> <b>shutdown!</b>
       If  you're  using  Log4perl  log  commands  in  DESTROY  methods of your objects, you might see confusing
       messages like

           Log4perl: Seems like no initialization happened. Forgot to call init()?
           Use of uninitialized value in subroutine entry at
           /home/y/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.6.1/Log/Log4perl.pm line 134 during global
           destruction. (in cleanup) Undefined subroutine &amp;main:: called at
           /home/y/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.6.1/Log/Log4perl.pm line 134 during global
           destruction.

       when the program shuts down. What's going on?

       This phenomenon happens if you have circular references in your objects, which perl can't clean  up  when
       an  object  goes out of scope but waits until global destruction instead. At this time, however, Log4perl
       has already shut down, so you can't use it anymore.

       For example, here's a simple class which uses a logger in its DESTROY method:

           package A;
           use Log::Log4perl qw(:easy);
           sub new { bless {}, shift }
           sub DESTROY { DEBUG "Waaah!"; }

       Now, if the main program creates a self-referencing object, like in

           package main;
           use Log::Log4perl qw(:easy);
           Log::Log4perl-&gt;easy_init($DEBUG);

           my $a = A-&gt;new();
           $a-&gt;{selfref} = $a;

       then you'll see the error message shown above during global destruction.  How to tackle this problem?

       First, you should clean up your circular references before global destruction. They will not  only  cause
       objects  to  be  destroyed  in  an order that's hard to predict, but also eat up memory until the program
       shuts down.

       So, the program above could easily be fixed by putting

           $a-&gt;{selfref} = undef;

       at the end or in an END handler. If that's hard to do, use weak references:

           package main;
           use Scalar::Util qw(weaken);
           use Log::Log4perl qw(:easy);
           Log::Log4perl-&gt;easy_init($DEBUG);

           my $a = A-&gt;new();
           $a-&gt;{selfref} = weaken $a;

       This allows perl to clean up the circular reference when the object goes out of scope, and  doesn't  wait
       until global destruction.

   <b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>access</b> <b>POE</b> <b>heap</b> <b>values</b> <b>from</b> <b>Log4perl's</b> <b>layout?</b>
       POE is a framework for creating multitasked applications running in a single process and a single thread.
       POE's  threads  equivalents  are  'sessions'  and  since  they  run  quasi-simultaneously,  you can't use
       Log4perl's global NDC/MDC to hold session-specific data.

       However, POE already maintains a data store for every session. It is called 'heap' and  is  just  a  hash
       storing  session-specific  data in key-value pairs.  To access this per-session heap data from a Log4perl
       layout, define a custom cspec and reference it with the newly defined pattern in the layout:

           use strict;
           use POE;
           use Log::Log4perl qw(:easy);

           Log::Log4perl-&gt;init( \ q{
               log4perl.logger = DEBUG, Screen
               log4perl.appender.Screen = Log::Log4perl::Appender::Screen
               log4perl.appender.Screen.layout = PatternLayout
               log4perl.appender.Screen.layout.ConversionPattern = %U %m%n
               log4perl.PatternLayout.cspec.U = \
                   sub { POE::Kernel-&gt;get_active_session-&gt;get_heap()-&gt;{ user } }
           } );

           for (qw( Huey Lewey Dewey )) {
               POE::Session-&gt;create(
                   inline_states =&gt; {
                       _start    =&gt; sub {
                           $_[HEAP]-&gt;{user} = $_;
                           POE::Kernel-&gt;yield('hello');
                       },
                       hello     =&gt; sub {
                           DEBUG "I'm here now";
                       }
                   }
               );
           }

           POE::Kernel-&gt;run();
           exit;

       The code snippet above defines a new layout placeholder (called 'cspec' in Log4perl)  %U  which  calls  a
       subroutine, retrieves the active session, gets its heap and looks up the entry specified ('user').

       Starting with Log::Log4perl 1.20, cspecs also support parameters in curly braces, so you can say

           log4perl.appender.Screen.layout.ConversionPattern = %U{user} %U{id} %m%n
           log4perl.PatternLayout.cspec.U = \
                   sub { POE::Kernel-&gt;get_active_session-&gt; \
                         get_heap()-&gt;{ $_[0]-&gt;{curlies} } }

       and  print  the  POE  session heap entries 'user' and 'id' with every logged message. For more details on
       cpecs, read the PatternLayout manual.

   <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>print</b> <b>something</b> <b>unconditionally!</b>
       Sometimes it's a script that's supposed to log messages regardless if Log4perl has  been  initialized  or
       not.  Or  there's  a  logging statement that's not going to be suppressed under any circumstances -- many
       people want to have the final word, make the executive decision, because it seems like the  only  logical
       choice.

       But  think  about  it: First off, if a messages is supposed to be printed, where is it supposed to end up
       at? STDOUT? STDERR? And are you sure you want to set in stone that this  message  needs  to  be  printed,
       while someone else might find it annoying and wants to get rid of it?

       The  truth  is,  there's  always  going  to  be someone who wants to log a messages at all cost, but also
       another person who wants to suppress it with equal vigilance. There's no good  way  to  serve  these  two
       conflicting desires, someone will always want to win at the cost of leaving the other party disappointed.

       So, the best Log4perl offers is the ALWAYS level for a message that even fires if the system log level is
       set to $OFF:

           use Log::Log4perl qw(:easy);

           Log::Log4perl-&gt;easy_init( $OFF );
           ALWAYS "This gets logged always. Well, almost always";

       The  logger  won't  fire,  though, if Log4perl hasn't been initialized or if someone defines a custom log
       hurdle that's higher than $OFF.

       Bottom line: Leave the setting of the logging level to the  initial  Perl  script  --  let  their  owners
       decided what they want, no matter how tempting it may be to decide it for them.

   <b>Why</b> <b>doesn't</b> <b>my</b> <b>END</b> <b>handler</b> <b>remove</b> <b>my</b> <b>log</b> <b>file</b> <b>on</b> <b>Win32?</b>
       If you have code like

           use Log::Log4perl qw( :easy );
           Log::Log4perl-&gt;easy_init( { level =&gt; $DEBUG, file =&gt; "my.log" } );
           END { unlink "my.log" or die };

       then you might be in for a surprise when you're running it on Windows, because the "unlink()" call in the
       END handler will complain that the file is still in use.

       What happens in Perl if you have something like

           END { print "first end in main\n"; }
           use Module;
           END { print "second end in main\n"; }

       and

           package Module;
           END { print "end in module\n"; }
           1;

       is that you get

           second end in main
           end in module
           first end in main

       because perl stacks the END handlers in reverse order in which it encounters them in the compile phase.

       Log4perl defines an END handler that cleans up left-over appenders (e.g.  file appenders which still hold
       files open), because those appenders have circular references and therefore aren't cleaned up otherwise.

       Now  if  you define an END handler after "use Log::Log4perl", it'll trigger before Log4perl gets a chance
       to clean up, which isn't a problem on Unix where you can delete a file even if some process has a  handle
       to it open, but it's a problem on Win32, where the OS won't let you do that.

       The solution is easy, just place the END handler <u>before</u> Log4perl gets loaded, like in

           END { unlink "my.log" or die };
           use Log::Log4perl qw( :easy );
           Log::Log4perl-&gt;easy_init( { level =&gt; $DEBUG, file =&gt; "my.log" } );

       which will call the END handlers in the intended order.
