       Perl6::Say - "print()", but no newline needed

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           # Perl 5 code...

           use Perl6::Say;

           say 'boo';             # same as:  print 'boo', "\n"

           say STDERR 'boo';      # same as:  print STDERR 'boo', "\n"

           STDERR-&gt;say('boo');    # same as:  print STDERR 'boo', \n"

           $fh-&gt;say('boo');       # same as:  print $fh 'boo', "\n";

           say();                 # same as:  print "$_\n";

           say undef;             # same as:  print "\n";

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Note</b> <b>for</b> <b>Users</b> <b>of</b> <b>Perl</b> <b>5.10</b>
       You don't need this module.  The Perl 6 "say" function is available in Perl 5.10 by saying "use feature
       'say';".  Hence, this module is of interest only to users of Perl 5.6 and 5.8.

       If you have Perl 5.10 installed, see the <u>510/</u> directory in this distribution for some elementary examples
       of "say" taken from "perldoc feature".

   <b>General</b>
       Implements a close simulation of the "say" function in Perl 6, which acts like "print" but automatically
       appends a newline.

       Use it just like "print" (except that it only supports the indirect object syntax when the stream is a
       bareword). That is, assuming the relevant filehandles are open for output, you can use any of these:

           say @data;
           say FH @data;
           FH-&gt;say(@data);
           *FH-&gt;say(@data);
           (\*FH)-&gt;say(@data);
           say $fh, @data;
           $fh-&gt;say(@data);

       but not any of these:

           say {FH} @data;
           say {*FH} @data;
           say {\*FH} @data;
           say $fh @data;
           say {$fh} @data;

   <b>Additional</b> <b>Permitted</b> <b>Usages</b>
       As demonstrated in the test suite accompanying this distribution, "Perl6::Say::say()" can be used in all
       the following situations.

           $string = q{};
           open FH, "&gt;", \$string;
           say FH qq{Hello World};            # print to a string
           close FH;                          # requires Perl 5.8.0 or later

           use FileHandle;
           $fh = FileHandle-&gt;new($file, 'w');
           if (defined $fh) {
               say $fh, qq{Hello World};
               $fh-&gt;close;
           }

           use IO::File;
           $fh = IO::File-&gt;new($file, 'w');
           if (defined $fh) {
               say $fh, qq{Hello World};
               $fh-&gt;close;
           }

           $string = q{};
           open FH, "&gt;", \$string;             # requires Perl 5.8.0 or later
           select(FH);
           say qq{Hello World};
           close FH;

   <b>Interaction</b> <b>with</b> <b>Output</b> <b>Record</b> <b>Separator</b>
       In Perl 6, "say @stuff" is exactly equivalent to "Core::print @stuff, "\n"".

       That means that a call to "say" appends any output record separator (ORS) <u>after</u> the added newline (though
       in Perl 6, the ORS is an attribute of the filehandle being used, rather than a global $/ variable).

   <b>"IO::Handle::say()"</b>
       IO::Handle version 1.27 or later (which, confusingly, is found in IO distribution 1.23 and later) also
       implements a "say" method.   Perl6::Say provides its own "say" method to IO::Handle if "IO::Handle::say"
       is not available.

   <b>Usage</b> <b>with</b> <b>Older</b> <b>Perls</b>
       As noted above, some aspects of "Perl6::Say::say()" will not work with versions of Perl earlier than
       5.8.0.  This is not due to any problem with this module; it is simply that Perl did not support printing
       to an in-memory file ("print \$string, "\n";") prior to that point.  (Thanks to a CPAN testers report
       from David Cantrell for identifying this limitation.)

</pre><h4><b>WARNING</b></h4><pre>
       The syntax and semantics of Perl 6 is still being finalized and consequently is at any time subject to
       change. That means the same caveat applies to this module.

</pre><h4><b>DEPENDENCIES</b></h4><pre>
       No dependencies other than on modules included with the Perl core as of version 5.8.0.

       Some of the files in the test suite accompanying this distribution use non-core CPAN module
       IO::Capture::Stdout.  Tests calling IO::Capture::Stdout methods are enclosed in "SKIP" blocks and so
       should pose no obstacle to installation of the distribution on systems lacking IO::Capture.  (However,
       the maintainer strongly recommends IO::Capture for developers who write a lot of test code.  So please
       consider installing it!)

       documentation.  Thanks to CPAN tester Jost Krieger for reporting an error in my SKIP block count in one
       test file.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>IRRITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       As far as we can determine, Perl 5 doesn't allow us to create a subroutine that truly acts like "print".
       That is, one that can simultaneously be used like so:

           say @data;

       and like so:

           say {$fh} @data;

       Comments, suggestions, and patches welcome.
