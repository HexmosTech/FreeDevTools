</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Net::IP::XS - IPv4/IPv6 address library

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Net::IP::XS;

         my $ip = new Net::IP::XS ('193.0.1/24') or die (Net::IP::XS::Error());
         print ("IP  : ".$ip-&gt;ip()."\n");
         print ("Sho : ".$ip-&gt;short()."\n");
         print ("Bin : ".$ip-&gt;binip()."\n");
         print ("Int : ".$ip-&gt;intip()."\n");
         print ("Mask: ".$ip-&gt;mask()."\n");
         print ("Last: ".$ip-&gt;last_ip()."\n");
         print ("Len : ".$ip-&gt;prefixlen()."\n");
         print ("Size: ".$ip-&gt;size()."\n");
         print ("Type: ".$ip-&gt;iptype()."\n");
         print ("Rev:  ".$ip-&gt;reverse_ip()."\n");

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       An XS (C) implementation of Net::IP. See Net::IP's documentation (as at version 1.25) for the functions
       and methods that are available.

</pre><h4><b>DIFFERENCES</b> <b>BETWEEN</b> <b>NET::IP</b> <b>AND</b> <b>NET::IP::XS</b></h4><pre>
       Exports
           Nothing is exported by default.

       Error messages
           In  some  instances this won't set error codes or messages where "Net::IP" would, though it should be
           mostly the same.

       Object-oriented interface
           The object-oriented  interface  uses  function  calls  and  hashref  lookups  internally,  such  that
           subclassing "Net::IP::XS" will not have the same effect as it does with "Net::IP".

       ip_auth
           Returns "undef" on failure, instead of dying.

       ip_binadd
           Returns "undef" if either of the bitstring arguments is more than 128 characters in length.

           Any  character  of  the  bitstring  that  is not a 0 is treated as a 1. The "Net::IP" version returns
           different results for different digits, and treats non-digits as 0.

       ip_bintoint
           The integer returned will be at most ((1 &lt;&lt; 128) - 1)  (i.e.  the  largest  possible  IPv6  address).
           "Net::IP" handles bitstrings of arbitrary length.

       ip_compress_address
           Returns "undef" if the IPv6 address argument is invalid.

       ip_compress_v4_prefix
           Returns "undef" if the "len" argument is negative or greater than 32.

       ip_expand_address
           Does not set "Error" or "Errno" where there is a problem with an embedded IPv4 address within an IPv6
           address.

           Returns the zero IP address if the empty string is provided. The "Net::IP" version returns "undef".

           Returns    a    full   IPv6   address   if   a   partial   address   is   provided   (e.g.    returns
           'ffff:ffff:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000' if 'ffff:ffff' is provided).  The "Net::IP" version returns
           the partial address.

           Returns "undef" on an invalid IPv4/IPv6 address. The "Net::IP" version returns the zero  address  for
           IPv4 and whatever was provided for IPv6.

       ip_get_mask
           The  mask  returned  will  always  have  a  length  equal  to the number of bits in an address of the
           specified IP version (e.g. an IPv4 mask will always comprise 32 characters).  The  "Net::IP"  version
           will  return a longer mask when the "len" argument is larger than the number of bits in the specified
           IP version.

           If a negative "len" is provided, it will be treated as zero.

       ip_inttobin
           The bitstring returned will always be either 32 or 128 characters in length, and it  returns  "undef"
           if  the  integer  argument  would require more than 128 characters to represent as a bitstring. If an
           invalid version is provided, the returned bitstring will be 128 characters in length.  The  "Net::IP"
           version  handles  arbitrary  integers  and  expands  to accommodate those integers, regardless of the
           version argument.  Also, if an invalid version is provided, the returned bitstring is only as long as
           is necessary to accommodate the bitstring.

       ip_iptobin
           Returns "undef" on an invalid IPv4/IPv6 address.

       ip_last_address_bin
           Returns an empty string if an invalid version (i.e. not  4  or  6)  is  provided.  If  the  bitstring
           provided  is longer than the number of bits in the specified version, then only the first 32/128 bits
           will be used in determining the last address. If the "len" provided is invalid (negative or more than
           32/128 depending on the version), it will be treated as the maximum length of the specified version.

       ip_normalize
           For the 'plus' style of string (e.g. '1.0.0.0 + 255'), whitespace between the plus character and  the
           parts  before  and  after  it  is optional. In the "Net::IP" version, there has to be some whitespace
           before and after the plus character. Also, "undef" will be returned if the part after the  plus  sign
           is not a number. The "Net::IP" version will return two copies of the single address in this instance.

           For the 'prefix range' style of string (e.g. '1.0.0.0/8'), the part after the slash must be a number.
           If  it  is  not, "undef" will be returned. The "Net::IP" version will return two copies of the single
           address in this instance.

       ip_range_to_prefix
           Returns "undef" if the version argument is invalid.

       ip_reverse
           The "len" argument determines the length  of  the  reverse  domain  -  e.g.,  if  the  arguments  are
           '127.0.0.1',  '16'  and  '4', the reverse domain will be '0.127.in-addr.arpa.'. The "Net::IP" version
           does not take the "len" argument into account for IPv4 addresses. For IPv6 addresses, a compressed IP
           address string may be provided.

       ip_splitprefix
           Returns "undef" unless the first component of the string is less than or equal to  64  characters  in
           length. The "Net::IP" version handles strings of arbitrary length.

       prefix
           Returns  a  string with a prefix length of zero (e.g. '127.0.0.1/0') where "prefixlen" is not defined
           in the object. The "Net::IP" version will not include any prefix length in the returned string  (e.g.
           '127.0.0.1/').
