</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Data::Faker - Perl extension for generating fake data

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Data::Faker;

         my $faker = Data::Faker-&gt;new();

         print "Name:    ".$faker-&gt;name."\n";
         print "Company: ".$faker-&gt;company."\n";
         print "Address: ".$faker-&gt;street_address."\n";
         print "         ".$faker-&gt;city.", ".$faker-&gt;us_state_abbr." ".$faker-&gt;us_zip_code."\n";

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module creates fake (but reasonable) data that can be used for things such as filling databases with
       fake information during development of database related applications.

</pre><h4><b>OBJECT</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>new()</b>
           Object  constructor.   As a shortcut, you can pass names of plugin modules to load to <b>new()</b>, although
           this does not actually restrict the functions available to the object, it just causes  those  plugins
           to  be  loaded  if they haven't been loaded already. All Data::Faker objects in one interpreter share
           the plugin data, so that multiple objects don't multiply the memory requirements.

       <b>methods()</b>;
           Return a list of the methods that have been provided by all of the loaded plugins.

       <b>register_plugin()</b>;
           Plugin modules call <b>register_plugin()</b> to provide data  methods.   See  any  of  the  included  plugin
           modules for examples.

</pre><h4><b>LOADING</b> <b>PLUGINS</b></h4><pre>
       You  can  specify which plugins to load by including just the base part of their name as an argument when
       loading the module with 'use'.  For example if you only wanted to use  data  from  the  Data::Faker::Name
       module, you would load Data::Faker like this:

         use Data::Faker qw(Name);

       By  default  any  modules  matching Data::Faker::* in any directory in @INC will be loaded.  You can also
       pass plugin names when calling the <b>new()</b> method, and they will be loaded if not already in  memory.   See
       <b>new()</b>.

</pre><h4><b>WRITING</b> <b>PLUGINS</b></h4><pre>
       Writing  a  plugin  to  provide  new  kinds  of data is easy, all you have to do is create a module named
       Data::Faker::SomeModuleName that inherits from Data::Faker.

       To provide data, the plugin merely needs to call the register_plugin function with one or more  pairs  of
       function name and function data, like this:

         #!<a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?perl">/usr/bin/perl</a> -w
         use strict;
         use warnings;
         use Data::Faker;

         my $faker = Data::Faker-&gt;new();
         print "My fake data is ".$faker-&gt;some_data_function."\n";

         package Data::Faker::SomeData;
         use base 'Data::Faker';

         __PACKAGE__-&gt;register_plugin(
           some_data_function =&gt; [qw(foo bar baz gazonk)],
           another_data_item =&gt; sub { return '$some_data_function' },
         );

       The first argument is the method that will be made available to your object, the second is a data source.
       If the data source is not a reference, it will simply be returned as the data, if it is a reference to an
       array,  a  random  element  from  the  array  will  be returned, and if it is a subroutine reference, the
       subroutine will be run and the results will be returned.  The data that  your  data  source  provides  is
       checked for two things, tokens (that look like perl variables, starting with a $), and numeric indicators
       (#).   Any  tokens  found will be replaced with their values, and any numeric indicators will be replaced
       with random numbers.  You can include a literal $ or # by prefacing it with a  backslash.   If  you  load
       more  than  one  module  that  defines the same function, it has an additive effect, when the function is
       called one of the data sources provided will be selected at random and then it will be called  to  get  a
       piece of data.

       Some data source examples:

         __PACKAGE__-&gt;register_plugin(
           age              =&gt; ['#','##'],
           monetary_amount  =&gt; ['\$####.##','\$###.##', '\$##.##', '\$#.##'],
           adult_age        =&gt; sub { int(<a href="../man70/rand.70.html">rand</a>(70)+18) },
         );

       If  your  data  source  is a code reference, it will receive the calling object as an argument so you can
       build data out of other data if you need to.  See Data::Faker::DateTime for some examples of this.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>KNOWN</b> <b>ISSUES</b></h4><pre>
       There is no way to selectively remove data sources from a plugin that was loaded, even if you didn't load
       it.
