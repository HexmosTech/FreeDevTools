       Locale::SubCountry - Convert state, province, county etc. names to/from ISO 3166-2 codes, get all states

           my %all_country_keyed_by_code   = $world-&gt;code_full_name_hash;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module allows you to convert the full name for a country's administrative region to the code
       commonly used for postal addressing. The reverse look up can also be done.

       Lists of sub country codes are useful for web applications that require a valid state, county etc to be
       entered as part of a users location.

       Sub countries are termed as states in the US and Australia, provinces in Canada and counties in the UK
       and Ireland. Other terms include region, department, city and territory. Countries such as France have
       several levels of sub countries, such as Metropolitan department, Metropolitan region etc.

       Names and ISO 3166-2 codes for all sub countries in a country can be returned as either a hash or an
       array.

       Names and ISO 3166-1 codes for all countries in the world can be returned as either a hash or an array.
       This in turn can be used to fetch every sub country from every country (see examples/demo.pl).

       Sub country codes are defined in "ISO 3166-2, Codes for the representation of names of countries and
       their subdivisions".

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       Note that the following methods duplicate some of the functionality of the Locale::Country module (part
       of the Locale::Codes bundle). They are provided here because you may need to first access the list of
       countries and ISO 3166-1 codes, before fetching their sub country data. If you only need access to
       country data, then Locale::Country should be used.

       Note also the following method names are also used for sub country objects.  (interface polymorphism for
       the technically minded). To avoid confusion, make sure that your chosen method is acting on the correct
       type of object.

           all_codes
           all_full_names
           code_full_name_hash
           full_name_code_hash

   <b>Locale::SubCountry::World-&gt;new()</b>
       The "new" method creates an instance of a world country object. This must be called before any of the
       following methods are invoked. The method takes no arguments.

   <b>full_name_code_hash</b> <b>(for</b> <b>world</b> <b>objects)</b>
       Given a world object, returns a hash of full name/code pairs for every country, keyed by country name.

   <b>code_full_name_hash</b>  <b>for</b> <b>world</b> <b>objects)</b>
       Given a world object, returns a hash of full name/code pairs for every country, keyed by country code.

   <b>all_full_names</b> <b>(for</b> <b>world</b> <b>objects)</b>
       Given a world object, returns an array of all country full names, sorted alphabetically.

   <b>all_codes</b> <b>(for</b> <b>world</b> <b>objects)</b>
       Given a world object, returns an array of all country ISO 3166-1 codes, sorted alphabetically.

   <b>Locale::SubCountry-&gt;new()</b>
       The "new" method creates an instance of a sub country object. This must be called before any of the
       following methods are invoked. The method takes a single argument, the name of the country that contains
       the sub country that you want to work with. It may be specified either by the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2  code or
       the full name. For example:

           AF - Afghanistan
           AL - Albania
           DZ - Algeria
           AO - Angola
           AR - Argentina
           AM - Armenia
           AU - Australia
           AT - Austria

       If the code is specified, such as 'AU'  the format may be in capitals or lower case If the full name is
       specified, such as 'Australia', the format must be in title case If a country name or code is specified
       that the module doesn't recognised, it will issue a warning.

   <b>country</b>
       Returns the current country name of a sub country object. The format is in title case, such as 'United
       Kingdom'

   <b>country_code</b>
       Given a sub country object, returns the alpha-2 ISO 3166-1 code of the country, such as 'GB'

   <b>code</b>
       Given a sub country object, the "code" method takes the full name of a sub country and returns the sub
       country's alpha-2 ISO 3166-2 code. The full name can appear in mixed case. All white space and non
       alphabetic characters are ignored, except the single space used to separate sub country names such as
       "New South Wales".  The code is returned as a capitalised string, or "unknown" if no match is found.

   <b>full_name</b>
       Given a sub country object, the "full_name" method takes the alpha-2 ISO 3166-2 code of a sub country and
       returns the sub country's full name. The code can appear in mixed case. All white space and non
       alphabetic characters are ignored. The full name is returned as a title cased string, such as "South
       Australia".

       If an optional argument is supplied and set to a true value, the full name is returned as an upper cased
       string.

   <b>level</b>
       Given a sub country object, the "level" method takes the alpha-2 ISO 3166-2 code of a sub country and
       returns the sub country's level . Examples are city, province,state and district, and usually relates to
       the a regions size.  The level is returned as a  string, or "unknown" if no match is found.

   <b>has_sub_countries</b>
       Given a sub country object, the "has_sub_countries" method returns 1 if the current country has sub
       countries, or 0 if it does not. Some small countries such as New Caledonia" do not have sub countries.

   <b>full_name_code_hash</b>  <b>(for</b> <b>sub</b> <b>country</b> <b>objects)</b>
       Given a sub country object, returns a hash of all full name/code pairs, keyed by sub country name. If the
       country has no sub countries, returns undef.

   <b>code_full_name_hash</b>  <b>(for</b> <b>sub</b> <b>country</b> <b>objects)</b>
       Given a sub country object, returns a hash of all code/full name pairs, keyed by sub country code. If the
       country has no sub countries, returns undef.

   <b>all_full_names</b>  <b>(for</b> <b>sub</b> <b>country</b> <b>objects)</b>
       Given a sub country object, returns an array of all sub country full names, sorted alphabetically. If the
       country has no sub countries, returns undef.

   <b>all_codes</b>  <b>(for</b> <b>sub</b> <b>country</b> <b>objects)</b>
       Given a sub country object, returns an array of all sub country alpha-2 ISO 3166-2 codes.  If the country
       has no sub countries, returns undef.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       All codes have been downloaded from the latest version of the Debian Salsa project
       &lt;https://salsa.debian.org/iso-codes-team/iso-codes/&gt; and then files iso_3166-1.json, iso_3166-2.json

       Locale::Country,Lingua::EN::AddressParse, Geo::StreetAddress::US,Geo::PostalAddress,Geo::IP
       WWW::Scraper::Wikipedia::ISO3166 for obtaining ISO 3166-2 data

       ISO 3166-1 Codes for the representation of names of countries and their subdivisions - Part 1: Country
       codes

       ISO 3166-2 Codes for the representation of names of countries and their subdivisions - Part 2: Country
       subdivision code

</pre><h4><b>LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The ISO 3166-2 standard romanizes the names of provinces and regions in non-latin script areas, such as
       Russia and South Korea. One Romanisation is given for each province name. For Russia, the BGN (1947)
       Romanization is used.

       Several sub country names have more than one code, and may not return the correct code for that sub
       country. These entries are usually duplicated because the name represents two different types of sub
       country, such as a province and a geographical unit. Examples are:

           AZERBAIJAN : Lankaran; LA (the Municipality), LAN (the Rayon) [see note]
           AZERBAIJAN : Saki; SA,SAK [see note]
           AZERBAIJAN : Susa; SS,SUS
           AZERBAIJAN : Yevlax; YE,YEV
           LAOS       : Vientiane VI the Vientiane, VT the Prefecture
           MOZAMBIQUE : Maputo; MPM (City),L (Province)

       Note: these names are spelt with  diacrtic characters (such as two dots above some of the 'a'
       characters). This causes utf8 errors on some versions of Perl, so they are omitted here. See the
       Locale::SubCountry::Codes module for correct spelling
