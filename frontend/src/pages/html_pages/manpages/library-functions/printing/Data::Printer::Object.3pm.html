</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Data::Printer::Object - underlying object for Data::Printer

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       Unless you're writing a plugin, or looking for some configuration property details the documentation you
       want is probably on Data::Printer. Seriously!

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module implements the underlying object used by Data::Printer to parse, format and print Perl data
       structures.

       It is passed to plugins so they can rely on contextual information from the caller like colors, spacing
       and other options.

</pre><h4><b>COMMON</b> <b>PROPERTIES</b> <b>/</b> <b>ATTRIBUTES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Scalar</b> <b>Options</b>
       <u>show_tainted</u>

       When set, will detect and let you know of any tainted data (default: 1) Note that this is a no-op unless
       your script is in taint mode, meaning it's running with different real and effective user/group IDs, or
       with the -T flag. See perlsec for extra information.

       <u>show_unicode</u>

       Whether to label data that has the unicode flag set. (default: 1)

       <u>show_dualvar</u>

       Perl can interpret strings as numbers and vice-versa, but that doesn't mean it always gets it right. When
       this option is set to "lax", Data::Printer will show both values if they differ. If set to "strict", it
       will always show both values, and when set to "off" it will never show the second value. (default: lax)

       <u>show_lvalue</u>

       Lets you know whenever a value is an lvalue (default: 1)

       <u>string_max</u>

       The maximum number of characters to display in a string. If the string is bigger than that, Data::Printer
       will trim a part of the string (set by string_preserve) and replace it with the message set on
       string_overflow. Set "string_max" to 0 to show all characters (default: 4096)

       <u>string_overflow</u>

       Message to display once string_max is reached. Defaults to <u>"(...skipping</u> <b>__</b><u>SKIPPED</u><b>__</b> <u>chars...)"</u>.

       <u>string_preserve</u>

       When the string has more characters than string_max, this option defines which part of the string to
       preserve. Can be set to 'begin', 'middle' or 'end'. (default: 'begin')

       <u>scalar_quotes</u>

       Which quotation character to use when printing strings (default: ")

       <u>escape_chars</u>

       Use this to escape certain characters from strings, which could be useful if your terminal is in a
       different encoding than the data being printed. Can be set to 'nonascii', 'nonlatin1', 'all' or 'none'
       (default: none).

       <u>unicode_charnames</u>

       whether to use the character's names when escaping unicode (e.g. SNOWMAN instead of \x{2603}) (default:
       0)

       <u>print_escapes</u>

       Whether to print invisible characters in strings, like \b, \n and \t (default: 0)

       <u>resolve_scalar_refs</u>

       If a reference to a scalar value is found more than once, print the resolved value. For example, you may
       have an object that you reuse to represent 'true' or 'false'. If you have more than one of those in your
       data, Data::Printer will by default print the second one as a circular reference. When this option is set
       to true, it will instead resolve the scalar value and keep going. (default: false)

   <b>Array</b> <b>Options</b>
       <u>array_max</u>

       The maximum number of array elements to show. If the array is bigger than that, Data::Printer will trim
       the offending slice (set by array_preserve) and replace it with the message set on array_overflow. Set
       "array_max" to 0 to show all elements in the array, regardless of array size (default: 100)

       <u>array_overflow</u>

       Message to display once array_max is reached. Defaults to "(...skipping __SKIPPED__ items...)".

       <u>array_preserve</u>

       When an array has more elements than array_max, this option defines which part of the array to preserve.
       Can be set to 'begin', 'middle' or 'end'. (default: 'begin')

       <u>index</u>

       When set, shows the index number before each array element. (default: 1)

   <b>Hash</b> <b>Options</b>
       <u>align_hash</u>

       If this option is set, hash keys  will be vertically aligned by the length of the longest key.

       This is better explained with an example, so consider the hash "my %h = ( a =&gt; 123, aaaaaa =&gt; 456 )".
       This would be an unaligned output:

           a =&gt; 123,
           aaaaaa =&gt; 456

       and this is what it looks like with "align_hash = 1":

           a      =&gt; 123,
           aaaaaa =&gt; 456

       (default: 1)

       <u>hash_max</u>

       The maximum number of hash key/value pairs to show. If the hash is bigger than that, Data::Printer will
       trim the offending slice (set by hash_preserve) and replace it with the message set on hash_overflow. Set
       "hash_max" to 0 to show all elements in the hash, regardless of the total keys. (default: 100)

       <u>hash_overflow</u>

       Message to display once hash_max is reached. Defaults to "(...skipping __SKIPPED__ keys...)".

       <u>hash_preserve</u>

       When a hash has more elements than hash_max, this option defines which part of the hash to preserve. Can
       be set to 'begin', 'middle' or 'end'. Note that Perl makes no promises regarding key order, so this
       option only makes sense if keys are sorted. In other words, if you have disabled sort_keys, expect random
       keys to be shown regardless of which part was preserved. (default: 'begin')

       <u>hash_separator</u>

       What to use to separate keys from values. Default is '   ' (three spaces)

       <u>sort_keys</u>

       Whether to sort keys when printing the contents of a hash (default: 1)

       <u>quote_keys</u>

       Whether to quote hash keys or not. Can be set to 1 (always quote), 0 (never quote) or 'auto' to quote
       only when a key contains spaces or linebreaks. (default: 'auto')

   <b>Caller</b> <b>Information</b>
       Data::Printer can add an informational message to every call to p() or np() if you enable "caller_info".
       So for example if you write:

           my $var = "meep!";
           p $var, caller_info =&gt; 1;

       this will output something like:

           Printing in line 2 of myapp.pl:
           "meep!"

       The following options let you customize the message and how it is displayed.

       <u>caller_info</u>

       Set this option to a true value to display a message next to the data being printed. (default: 0)

       <u>caller_message</u>

       What message to print when caller_info is true.

       Defaults to ""Printing in line __LINE__ of __FILENAME__"".

       If the special strings "__LINE__", "__FILENAME__" or "__PACKAGE__" are present in the message, they'll be
       interpolated into their according value so you can customize the message at will:

           caller_message = "[__PACKAGE__:__LINE__]"

       <u>caller_message_newline</u>

       When true, skips a line when printing caller_message.  When false, only a single space is added between
       the message and the data.  (default: 1)

       <u>caller_message_position</u>

       This option controls where the caller_message will appear in relation to the code being printed. Can be
       set to 'before' or 'after'. A line is always skipped between the message and the data (either before or
       after), unless you set caller_message_newline to 0.  (default: 'before')

   <b>General</b> <b>Options</b>
       <u>arrows</u>

       Data::Printer shows circular references as a data path, indicating where in the data that reference
       points to. You may use this option to control if/when should it print reference arrows. Possible values
       are 'all' (e.g "var-&gt;{x}-&gt;[y]-&gt;[z]"), 'first' ("var-&gt;{x}[y][z]") or 'none' ("var{x}[y][z]"). Default is
       'none'.

       <u>colored</u>

       Whether to colorize the output or not. Can be set to 1 (always colorize), 0 (never colorize) or 'auto'.
       Default is 'auto', meaning it will colorize only when printing to STDOUT or STDERR, never to a file or to
       a variable. The 'auto' setting also respects the "ANSI_COLORS_DISABLED" environment variable.

       <u>deparse</u>

       If the data structure contains a subroutine reference (coderef), this option can be set to deparse it and
       print the underlying code, which hopefully resembles the original source code. (default: 0)

       <u>coderef_stub</u>

       If the data structure contains a subroutine reference (coderef) and the 'deparse' option above is set to
       false, Data::Printer will print this instead. (default: '"sub { ... }"')

       <u>coderef_undefined</u>

       If the data structure contains a subroutine reference (coderef) that has not actually been defined at the
       time of inspection, Data::Printer will print this instead. Set it to '0' to disable this check, in which
       case Data::Printer will use whatever value you set on coderef_stub above. (default: '&lt;undefined
       coderef&gt;').

       <u>end_separator</u>

       When set, the last item on an array or hash will always contain a trailing separator. (default: 0)

       <u>show_memsize</u>

       Set to true and Data::Printer will show the estimate memory size of the data structure being printed.
       Requires Devel::Size. (default: 0)

       <u>memsize_unit</u>

       If show_memsize is on, this option lets you specify the unit in which to show the memory size. Can be set
       to "b" to show size in bytes, "k" for kilobytes, "m" for megabytes or "auto", which will use the biggest
       unit that makes sense. (default: auto)

       <u>output</u>

       Where you want the output to be printed. Can be set to the following values:

       •   'stderr' - outputs to the standard error handle.

       •   'stdout' - outputs to the standard output handle.

       •   reference to a scalar (e.g. "\$string") - outputs to the scalar reference.

       •   file handle - any open file handle:

               open my $fh, '&gt;&gt;', '/path/to/some/file.log' or die $!;
               p @{[ 1,2,3 ]}, output =&gt; $fh;

       •   file  path  -  if  you  pass a non-empty string that is not 'stderr' nor 'stdout', Data::Printer will
           consider it to be a file path and create/append to it automatically for you. So you can  do  this  in
           your ".dataprinter":

               output = /path/to/some/file.log

           By default, Data::Printer will print to the standard error (stderr).

       <u>max_depth</u>

       This setting controls how far inside the data structure we should go (default: 0 for no depth limit)

       <u>return_value</u>

       Whether  the  user  wants  the  return  value  to be a pass-through of the source data ('pass'), the dump
       content itself ('dump') or nothing at all ('void').

       Defaults to 'pass' since version 0.36. <b>NOTE</b>: if you set it  to  'dump',  make  sure  it's  not  the  last
       statement of a subroutine or that, if it is, the sub is only called in void context.

       <u>separator</u>

       The separator character(s) to use for arrays and hashes. The default is the comma ",".

       <u>show_readonly</u>

       When this option is set, Data::Printer will let you know whenever a value is read-only. (default: 1)

       <u>show_refcount</u>

       Whether to show data refcount it's above 1 (default: 0)

       <u>show_weak</u>

       When this option is set, Data::Printer will let you know whenever it finds a weak reference (default: 1)

       <u>show_tied</u>

       When  set  to true, this option will let you know whenever a tied variable is detected, including what is
       tied to it (default: 1)

       <u>theme</u>

           theme = Monokai

       This setting gets/sets the current color theme module. The default theme is Material. Data::Printer ships
       with several themes for you to choose, and you can create your own theme or use any other from CPAN.

       <u>warnings</u>

       If something goes wrong when parsing your data or printing it to the selected  output,  Data::Printer  by
       default  shows  you  a  warning  from  the standpoint of the actual call to p() or np(). To silence those
       warnings, set this option to 0.

   <b>Class</b> <b>/</b> <b>Object</b> <b>Options</b>
       <u>class_method</u>

       When Data::Printer is printing an object, it first looks for a method named ""_data_printer"" and, if one
       is found, we call it instead of actually parsing the structure.

       This way, module authors can control how Data::Printer outputs their objects the  best  possible  way  by
       simply adding a private method instead of having to write a full filter or even adding Data::Printer as a
       dependency.

       To  disable this behavior, simply set this option to false or an empty string.  You can also change it to
       a different name and Data::Printer will look for that instead.

       <u>class</u> <u>-</u> <u>class</u> <u>properties</u> <u>to</u> <u>override.</u>

       This "namespace" gets/sets all class properties that are used by the standard  class  filter  that  ships
       with  Data::Printer.  Note that, if you are using a specific filter for that object, most (if not all) of
       the settings below will not apply.

       In your ".dataprinter" file, the defaults would look like this:

           class.parents            = 1
           class.linear_isa         = auto
           class.universal          = 0
           class.expand             = 1
           class.stringify          = 1
           class.show_reftype       = 0
           class.show_overloads     = 1
           class.show_methods       = all
           class.sort_methods       = 1
           class.inherited          = public
           class.format_inheritance = lines
           class.parent_filters     = 1
           class.internals          = 1

       In code, you should use the "class" namespace as a key to a hash reference:

           use Data::Printer class =&gt; {
               parents            =&gt; 1,
               linear_isa         =&gt; 'auto',
               universal          =&gt; 0,
               expand             =&gt; 1,
               stringify          =&gt; 1,
               show_reftype       =&gt; 0,
               show_overloads     =&gt; 1,
               show_methods       =&gt; 'all',
               sort_methods       =&gt; 1,
               inherited          =&gt; 'public',
               format_inheritance =&gt; 'lines',
               parent_filters     =&gt; 1,
               internals          =&gt; 1,
           };

       Or inline:

           p $some_object, class =&gt; { internals =&gt; 1,  ... };

       parents

       When set, shows all superclasses of the object being printed. (default: 1)

       linear_isa

       This setting controls whether to show the linearized @ISA, which is the order of preference in which  the
       object's methods and attributes are resolved according to its inheritance. Can be set to 1 (always show),
       0  (never  show)  or  'auto',  which  shows only when the object has more than one superclass.  (default:
       'auto')

       universal

       Set this option to 1 to include UNIVERSAL methods to the list of public methods (like "can"  and  "isa").
       (default: 0)

       expand

       Sets  how  many  levels to descend when printing classes, in case their internals point to other classes.
       Set this to 0 to never expand any objects, just show their name. Set  to  any  integer  number  and  when
       Data::Printer  reaches  that  depth,  only  the class name will be printed. Set to 'all' to always expand
       objects found inside your object. (default: 1)

       stringify

       When this option is set, Data::Printer will check if the object being printed contains any methods  named
       "as_string",  "to_string"  or  "stringify".  If it does, Data::Printer will use it as the object's output
       instead of the generic class plugin. (default: 1)

       show_reftype

       If set to a true value, Data::Printer will show the internal reference type of the object. (default: 0)

       show_overloads

       This option includes a list of all overloads implemented by the object.  (default: 1)

       show_methods

       Controls which of the object's direct methods to  show.  Can  be  set  to  'none',  'all',  'private'  or
       'public'. When applicable (Moo, Moose) it will also show attributes and roles. (default: 'all')

       sort_methods

       When  listing  methods,  attributes and roles, this option will order them alphabetically, rather than on
       whatever order the list of methods returned.  (default: 1)

       inherited

       Controls which of the object's parent methods to  show.  Can  be  set  to  'none',  'all',  'private'  or
       'public'. (default: 'public')

       format_inheritance

       This  option controls how to format the list of methods set by a parent class (and not the class itself).
       Setting it to 'lines' it will print one line for each parent, like so:

           public methods (5):
               foo, bar
               Parent::Class:
                   baz, meep
               Other::Parent:
                   moop

       Setting it to 'string', it will put all methods on the same line:

           public methods (5): foo, bar, baz (Parent::Class), meep (Parent::CLass), moop (Other::Parent)

       Default is: 'lines'.

       parent_filters

       If there is no filter for the given object's class, there may still be a filter for  one  of  its  parent
       classes.  When  this option is set, Data::Printer will traverse the object's superclass and use the first
       filter it finds, if one is present. (default: 1)

       internals

       Shows the object's internal data structure. (default: 1)

   <b>"Shortcuts"</b>
       Some options are so often used together we have created shortcuts for them.

       <u>as</u>

           p $somevar, as =&gt; 'is this right?';

       The ""as"" shortcut activates caller_info and sets caller_message to whatever you set it to. It's  really
       useful to quickly differentiate between sequential uses of p().

       <u>multiline</u>

           p $somevar, multiline =&gt; 0;

       When  set  to  0, disables array index and linebreaks, uses ':' as hash separator and '(...)' as overflow
       for hashes, arrays and strings, and also disables 'caller_message_newline' so any caller message is shown
       on the same line as the variable being printed. If this is set  on  a  global  configuration  or  on  the
       ".dataprinter" file, Can be "undone" by setting it to "1".

       <u>fulldump</u>

           p $somevar, fulldump =&gt; 1;

       By  default,  Data::Printer  limits the size of string/array/hash dumps to a (hopefully) reasonable size.
       Still, sometimes you really need to see everything. To completely disable  such  limits,  just  set  this
       option to true.

   <b>Methods</b> <b>and</b> <b>Accessors</b> <b>for</b> <b>Filter</b> <b>Writers</b>
       The  following  attributes could be useful if you're writing your own custom filters or maybe even a non-
       obvious profile. Otherwise, no need to worry about any of them ;)

       And make sure to check out the current filter list for real usage examples!

       <u>indent</u>

       <u>outdent</u>

       <u>newline</u>

       These methods are used to control the indentation level of the string being  created  to  represent  your
       data.  While  "indent"  and "outdent" respectively increase and decrease the indentation level, "newline"
       will add a linebreak and position the "cursor" where you are expected to continue your dump string:

           my $output = $ddp-&gt;newline . 'this is a new line';
           $ddp-&gt;indent;
           $output .= $ddp-&gt;newline . 'this is indented';
           $ddp-&gt;outdent;
           $output .= $ddp-&gt;newline . 'back to our previous indentation!';

       Unless multiline was set to 0, the code above should print something like:

           this is a new line
               this is indented
           back to our previous indentation

       <u>extra_config</u>

       Data::Printer will read and pass-through any unrecognized settings in either your ".dataprinter" file  or
       your inline arguments inside this structure.  This is useful to create custom settings for your filters.

       While  any and all unknown settings will be readable here, we recommend you prepend them with a namespace
       like "filter_xxx" as those are reserved for filters and thus guaranteed  not  to  colide  with  any  core
       Data::Printer settings now or in the future.

       For  example, on the Web filter we have the "expand_headers" option, and even though Data::Printer itself
       doesn't have this option, we prepend everything with the "filter_web" namespace,  either  in  the  config
       file:

           filter_web.expand_headers = 1

       or inline:

           p $http_response, filters =&gt; ['Web'], filter_web =&gt; { expand_headers =&gt; 1 };

       <u>maybe_colorize(</u> <u>$string,</u> <u>$label</u> <u>)</u>

       <u>maybe_colorize(</u> <u>$string,</u> <u>$label,</u> <u>$default_color</u> <u>)</u>

           my $output = $ddp-&gt;maybe_colorize( 12.3, 'number');

       Instead of simply adding raw content to your dump string, you should wrap it with this method, as it will
       look  up  colors  on the current theme and print them (or not, depending on whether the terminal supports
       color or the user has explicitly turned them off).

       If you are writing a custom filter and don't want to use the core labels to colorize  your  content,  you
       may want to set your own label and pass a default color. For example:

           my $output = $ddp-&gt;maybe_colorize( $data, 'filter_myclass', '#ffccb3' );

       In  the  code above, if the user has "colors.filter_myclass" set either on the ".dataprinter" file or the
       runtime hashref, that one will be used. Otherwise, Data::Printer will use '#ffccb3'.

       <u>current_depth</u>

       Shows the current depth level, from 0 onwards.

       <u>current_name</u>

       Gets/sets the name for the current posistion, to be printed when the parser visits that data again.  E.g.
       "var[0]{abc}[2]".

       <u>parse(</u> <u>$data_ref</u> <u>)</u>

       <u>parse(</u> <u>$data_ref,</u> <u>%options</u> <u>)</u>

       This  method  receives  a  reference to a data structure to parse, and returns the parsed string. It will
       call each filter and colorize the output accordingly.

       Use this inside filters whenever you want to use the result of a parsed data strucure.

           my $output = $ddp-&gt;parse( [3,2,1] );

       An optional set of parameters may be passed:

       •   "force_type =&gt; $type" - forces data to be treated as that type, where $type is the name of  the  Perl
           data  strucuture as returned by Scalar::Util::reftype (e.g. 'HASH', 'ARRAY' etc). This is used when a
           filter wants to show the internals of blessed data. Otherwise parse would just call the  same  filter
           over and over again.

       •   "seen_override  =&gt;  1"  -  Data::Printer::Object  tries  to  remember  if  it has already seen a data
           structure before, so it can show the circular  reference  instead  of  entenring  an  infinite  loop.
           However, there are cases when you want to print the same data structure twice, like when you're doing
           a second pass on a blessed object to print its internals, or if you're using the same object over and
           over  again.  This setting overrides the internal counter and prints the same data again. Check unsee
           below for another way to achieve this.

       <u>parse_as(</u> <u>$type,</u> <u>$data_ref</u> <u>)</u>

       This is a convenience method to force some data to be interpreted as a particular type. It  is  the  same
       as:

           $ddp-&gt;parse( $data, force_type =&gt; $type, seen_override =&gt; 1 );

   <b>unsee(</b> <b>$data</b> <b>)</b>
       Sometimes  you  are  writing  a  filter  for data that you know will be repeated several times, like JSON
       Boolean objects. To prevent Data::Printer from showing this content as repeated, you can use the  "unsee"
       method to make the current object forget about having ever visited this data.

</pre><h4><b>OBJECT</b> <b>CONSTRUCTION</b></h4><pre>
       You'll most like never need this unless you're planning on extending Data::Printer itself.

   <b>new(</b> <b>%options</b> <b>)</b>
       Creates  a  new Data::Printer::Object instance. It may (optionally) receive a hash or hash reference with
       custom settings for any of its properties.
