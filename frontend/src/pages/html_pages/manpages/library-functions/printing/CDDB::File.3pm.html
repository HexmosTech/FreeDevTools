</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       CDDB::File - Parse a CDDB/freedb data file

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         my $disc = CDDB::File-&gt;new("rock/f4109511");

         print $disc-&gt;id, $disc-&gt;all_ids;
         print $disc-&gt;artist, $disc-&gt;title;
         print $disc-&gt;year, $disc-&gt;genre, $disc-&gt;extd;
         print $disc-&gt;length, $disc-&gt;track_count;

         print $disc-&gt;revision, $disc-&gt;submitted_via, $disc-&gt;processed_by;

         foreach my $track ($disc-&gt;tracks) {
           print $track-&gt;number, $track-&gt;title, $track-&gt;artist;
           print $track-&gt;length, $track-&gt;extd;
         }

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module provides an interface for extracting data from CDDB-format data files, as used by freedb.

       It does not read data from your CD, or submit information to freedb.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>new</b>
         my $disc = CDDB::File-&gt;new("rock/f4109511");

       This will create a new object representing the data in the file name specified.

   <b>id</b> <b>/</b> <b>all_ids</b>
         my $discid = $disc-&gt;id;
         my @discid = $disc-&gt;all_ids;

       Due to how freedb works, one CD may have several IDs associated with it. 'id' will return the first of
       these (not necessarily related to the filename from which this was read), whilst 'all_ids' will return
       all of them.

   <b>title</b> <b>/</b> <b>artist</b>
       The title and artist of this CD. For eponymous CDs these will be identical, even if the data file leaves
       the artist field blank.

   <b>year</b>
       The (4-digit) year of release.

   <b>genre</b>
       The genre of this CD. This is the genre as stored in the data file itself, which is not related to the 11
       main freedb genres.

   <b>extd</b>
       The "extended data" for the CD. This is used for storing miscellaneous information which has no better
       storage place, and can be of any length.

   <b>length</b>
       The run time of the CD in seconds.

   <b>track_count</b>
       The number of tracks on the CD.

   <b>revision</b>
       Each time information regarding the CD is updated this revision number is incremented. This returns the
       revision number of this version.

   <b>processed_by</b> <b>/</b> <b>submitted_via</b>
       The software which submitted this information to freedb and which processed it at the other end.

   <b>tracks</b>
         foreach my $track ($disc-&gt;tracks) {
           print $track-&gt;number, $track-&gt;title, $track-&gt;artist;
           print $track-&gt;length, $track-&gt;extd;
         }

       Returns a list of Track objects, each of which knows its number (numering from 1), title, length (in
       seconds), offset, and may also have extended track data.

       Tracks may also contain an 'artist' field. If this is not set the artist method will return the artist of
       the CD.
