</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Declare::Constraints::Simple - Declarative Validation of Data Structures

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Declare::Constraints::Simple-All;

         my $profile = IsHashRef(
                           -keys   =&gt; HasLength,
                           -values =&gt; IsArrayRef( IsObject ));

         my $result1 = $profile-&gt;(undef);
         print $result1-&gt;message, "\n";    # 'Not a HashRef'

         my $result2 = $profile-&gt;({foo =&gt; [23]});

         print $result2-&gt;message, "\n";    # 'Not an Object'

         print $result2-&gt;path, "\n";
                           # 'IsHashRef[val foo].IsArrayRef[0].IsObject'

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The main purpose of this module is to provide an easy way to build a profile to validate a data
       structure. It does this by giving you a set of declarative keywords in the importing namespace.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       This is just a brief intro. For details read the documents mentioned in "SEE ALSO".

   <b>Constraint</b> <b>Import</b>
         use Declare::Constraints::Simple-All;

       The above command imports all constraint generators in the library into the current namespace. If you
       want only a selection, use "only":

         use Declare::Constraints::Simple
             Only =&gt; qw(IsInt Matches And);

       You can find all constraints (and constraint-like generators, like operators. In fact, "And" above is an
       operator. They're both implemented equally, so the distinction is a merely philosophical one) documented
       in the Declare::Constraints::Simple::Library pod. In that document you will also find the exact
       parameters for their usage, so this here is just a brief Intro and not a coverage of all possibilities.

   <b>Building</b> <b>a</b> <b>Profile</b>
       You can use these constraints by building a tree that describes what data structure you expect. Every
       constraint can be used as sub-constraint, as parent, if it accepts other constraints, or stand-alone. If
       you'd just say

         my $check = IsInt;
         print "yes!\n" if $check-&gt;(23);

       it will work too. This also allows predefining tree segments, and nesting them:

         my $id_to_objects = IsArrayRef(IsObject);

       Here $id_to_objects would give it's OK on an array reference containing a list of objects. But what if we
       now decide that we actually want a hashref containing two lists of objects? Behold:

         my $object_lists =
           IsHashRef( HasAllKeys( qw(good bad) ),
                      OnHashKeys( good =&gt; $id_to_objects,
                                  bad  =&gt; $id_to_objects ));

       As you can see, constraints like "IsArrayRef" and "IsHashRef" allow you to apply constraints to their
       keys and values. With this, you can step down in the data structure.

   <b>Applying</b> <b>a</b> <b>Profile</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>Data</b> <b>Structure</b>
       Constraints return just code references that can be applied to one value (and only one value) like this:

         my $result = $object_lists-&gt;($value);

       After this call $result contains a Declare::Constraints::Simple::Result object. The first think one wants
       to know is if the validation succeeded:

         if ($result-&gt;is_valid) { ... }

       This is pretty straight forward. To shorten things the result object also overloads it's "bool"ean
       context. This means you can alternatively just say

         if ($result) { ... }

       However, if the result indicates a invalid data structure, we have a few options to find out what went
       wrong. There's a human parsable message in the "message" accessor. You can override these by forcing it
       to a message in a subtree with the "Message" declaration. The "stack" contains the name of the chain of
       constraints up to the point of failure.

       You can use the "path" accessor for a joined string path representing the stack.

   <b>Creating</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>Libraries</b>
       You can declare a package as a library with

         use Declare::Constraints::Simple-Library;

       which will install the base class and helper methods to define constraints. For a complete list read the
       documentation in Declare::Constraints::Simple::Library::Base. You can use other libraries as base classes
       to include their constraints in your export possibilities. This means that with a package setup like

         package MyLibrary;
         use warnings;
         use strict;

         use Declare::Constraints::Simple-Library;
         use base 'Declare::Constraints::Simple::Library';

         constraint 'MyConstraint',
           sub { return _result(($_[0] &gt;= 12), 'Value too small') };

         1;

       you can do

         use MyLibrary-All;

       and have all constraints, from the default library and yours from above, installed into your requesting
       namespace. You can override a constraint just by redeclaring it in a subclass.

   <b>Scoping</b>
       Sometimes you want to validate parts of a data structure depending on another part of it. As of version
       2.0 you can declare scopes and store results in them. Here is a complete example:

         my $constraint =
           Scope('foo',
             And(
               HasAllKeys( qw(cmd data) ),
               OnHashKeys(
                 cmd =&gt; Or( SetResult('foo', 'cmd_a',
                              IsEq('FOO_A')),
                            SetResult('foo', 'cmd_b',
                              IsEq('FOO_B')) ),
                 data =&gt; Or( And( IsValid('foo', 'cmd_a'),
                                  IsArrayRef( IsInt )),
                             And( IsValid('foo', 'cmd_b'),
                                  IsRegex )) )));

       This profile would accept a hash references with the keys "cmd" and "data". If "cmd" is set to "FOO_A",
       then "data" has to be an array ref of integers. But if "cmd" is set to "FOO_B", a regular expression is
       expected.

</pre><h4><b>REQUIRES</b></h4><pre>
       Carp::Clan, aliased, Class::Inspector, Scalar::Util, overload and Test::More (for build).

</pre><h4><b>TODO</b></h4><pre>
       •   Examples.

       •   A list of questions that might come up, together with their answers.

       •   A "Custom" constraint that takes a code reference.

       •   Create stack objects that stringify to the current form, but can hold more data.

       •   Give  the "Message" constraint the ability to get the generated constraint inserted in the message. A
           possibility would be to replace __Value__ and __Message__. It  might  also  accept  code  references,
           which return strings.

       •   Allow the "IsCodeRef" constraint to accept further constraints. One might like to check, for example,
           the refaddr of a closure.

       •   A "Captures" constraint that takes a regex and can apply other constraints to the matches.

       •   ???

       •   Profit.
