</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The "Math::VectorReal" package defines a 3D mathematical "vector", in a way that is compatible with the
       previous CPAN module "Math::MatrixReal". However it provides a more vector oriented set of mathematical
       functions and overload operators, to the "MatrixReal" package.  For example the normal perl string
       functions "x" and "." have been overloaded to allow vector cross and dot product operations. Vector math
       formula thus looks like vector math formula in perl programs using this package.

       While this package is compatible with Math::MatrixReal, you DO NOT need to have that package to perform
       purely vector orientated calculations. You will need it however if you wish to do matrix operations with
       these vectors. The interface has been designed with this package flexibility in mind.

       The vectors are defined in the same way as a "row" "Math::MatrixReal" matrix, instead of that packages
       choice of "column" definition for vector operations.  Such vectors are multiplied to matices with the
       vector on the left and the matrix on the right. EG:   v * M -&gt; 'v

       Not only is this the way I prefer to handle vectors, but it is the way most graphics books use vectors.
       As a bonus it results in no overload conflicts between this package and that of Math::MatrixReal, (the
       left objects overload operator is called to do the mathematics). It also is a lot simpler than
       "MatrixReal" column vector methods, which were designed for equation solving rather than 3D geometry
       operations.

       The  <b>vector_matrix()</b>  function provided, simplifies the creation a "MatrixReal" object from 3 (usually
       orthogonal) vectors. This with its vector orientated math operators makes it very easy to define
       orthogonal rotation matrices from "Math::VectorReal" objects.  See a rough example in the synopsis above,
       or in the file "matrix_test" in the packages source.

       NOTE: the 6th element the "Math::MatrixReal" array object is used to hold the length of the vector so
       that it can be re-used without needing to be re-calculated all the time. This means the expensive <b>sqrt()</b>
       function, need not be called unless nessary.  This usage should not effect the direct use of these
       objects in the "Math::MatrixReal" functions.

</pre><h4><b>CONSTANTS</b></h4><pre>
       Four constant vectors are available for export (using an ":all" tag).  these are

           0 = [ 0 0 0 ]   the zero vector or origin
           X = [ 1 0 0 ]   |
           Y = [ 0 1 0 ]    &gt; Unit axis vectors
           Z = [ 0 0 1 ]   |

</pre><h4><b>CONSTRUCTORS</b></h4><pre>
       new(x,y,z)
           Create a new vector with the values of "x", "y", "z" returning the appropriate object.

       vector(x,y,z)
           As  "new"  but  is  a  exported  function  which  does  not  require  a package reference to create a
           "Math::VectorReal" object.

       <b>clone()</b>
           Return a completely new copy of the referring "Math::VectorReal" object.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>array()</b>
           Return the x,y,z elements of the referring vector are an array of values.

       x() Return the x element of the referring vector.

       y() Return the y element of the referring vector.

       z() Return the z element of the referring vector.

       stringify( [ FORMAT ] )
           Return the referring verctor as a string. The "FORMAT" if given is used to sprintf format the vector.
           This is used for all VectorReal to String conversions.

           By default this format is the same as it would  be  for  a  "Math::MatrixReal"  object,  "[  %#19.12E
           %#19.12E %#19.12E ]\n".  Note that this includes a newline character!.

           However  unlike "Math::MatrixReal" you can assign a new default sprintf format by assigning it to the
           packages $FORMAT variable. For Example

              $Math::VectorReal::FORMAT = "{ %g, %g, %g }"

           Which is a good format to output vectors for use by the  POVray  (Persistence  of  Vision  Raytracer)
           program.

       <b>length()</b>
           Return  the length of the given vector. As a side effect the length is saved into that vectors object
           to avoid the use of the expensive <b>sqrt()</b> function.

       <b>norm()</b>
           Normalise the Vector. That is scalar divide the vector by its length, so that it  becomes  of  length
           one.   Normal  vectors  are  commonly  use to define directions, without scale, or orientation of a 3
           dimensional plane.

       plane( v1, v2, v3 )
           Given three points defined counter clockwise on a plane, return an array in which the  first  element
           is  the  planes  normal  unit vector, and the second its distance from the origin, along that vector.
           NOTE: the distance may be negitive, in which case the origon is above the defined plane in 3d space.

       vector_matrix( nx, ny, nz )
           Given the new location for the X, Y and Z vectors, concatanate them together (row wise) to  create  a
           "Math::MatrixReal"  translation matrix. For example if the 3 vectors are othogonal to each other, the
           matrix created will be a rotation matrix to rotate the X, Y and Z axis  to  the  given  vectors.  See
           above for an example.

</pre><h4><b>VECTOR/MATRIX</b> <b>CONVERSION</b></h4><pre>
       The following functions provide links between the "Math::VectorReal" and "Math::MatrixReal" packages.

       NOTE:  While this package is closely related to "Math::MatrixReal", it does NOT require that that package
       to be installed unless you actually want to perform matrix operations.

       Also the overload operations will automatically handle vector/matrix mathematics (See below).

   <b>Vector</b> <b>to</b> <b>Matrix</b> <b>Conversion</b>
       vector2matrix_row( [CLASS] )
       vector2matrix_col( [CLASS] )
           Convert "Math::VectorReal" objects to a "Math::MatrixReal" objects.  Optional  argument  defines  the
           object class to be returned (defaults to "Math::MatrixReal").

           Note  that  as  a  "Math::VectorReal"  is  internally  equivelent to a "Math::MatrixReal" row matrix,
           "vector2matrix_row" is essentually just a  bless  operation,  which  is  NOT  required  to  use  with
           "Math::MatrixReal" functions.

           The "vector2matrix_col" performs the required transpose to convert the "Math::VectorReal" object into
           a "Math::MatrixReal" version of a vector (a column matrix).

   <b>Matrix</b> <b>to</b> <b>Vector</b> <b>Conversion</b>
       matrix_row2vector( [ROW] )
       matrix_col2vector( [COLUMN] )
           When  referred  to  by a "Math::MatrixReal" object, extracts the vector from the matrix. the optional
           argument defines which row or column of the matrix is to be extracted as a "Math::VectorReal" vector.

</pre><h4><b>OPERATOR</b> <b>OVERLOADING</b></h4><pre>
       Overload operations are provided to perform the usual string  conversion,  addition,  subtraction,  unary
       minus,  scalar  multiplation  &amp; division.  On top of this however the multiply have been expanded to look
       for and execute "MatrixReal" multiplation.

       The Main purpose of this package however was to  provide  the  special  vector  product  operations:  dot
       product "." and cross product "x".  In perl these operations are normally used for string operations, but
       if  either  argument  is  a  "VectorReal"  object,  the operation will attempt the approprate vector math
       operation instead.

       Note however that if one side of the dot "." operator is already  a  string,  then  the  vector  will  be
       converted  to  a  sting  and  a  string  concatantion will be performed. The cross operator "x" will just
       <b>croak()</b> as it is non-sensical to either repeat the string conversion of a vector, OR to repeat a  string,
       vector, times!

       Overloaded operator summery...
           neg     unary minus - multiply vector by -1
            ""     automatic string conversion using <b>stringify()</b> function
             +     vector addition
             -     vector subtraction
             /     scalar division (left argument must be the vector)
             *     scalar multiplication OR MatrixReal multiplication
             x     vector/cross product of two vectors
             .     dot product of two vectors OR vector/string concatanation

       Possible  future  addition    '~'   to transpose a "VectorReal" into a "MatrixReal" column vector (as per
       that operator on "MatrixReal" objects).  It was not added as it just did not seem to be needed.
