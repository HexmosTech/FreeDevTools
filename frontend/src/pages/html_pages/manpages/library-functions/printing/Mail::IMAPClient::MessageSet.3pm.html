       Mail::IMAPClient::MessageSet - ranges of message sequence numbers

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        my @msgs = $imap-&gt;search("SUBJECT","Virus"); # returns 1,3,4,5,6,9,10
        my $msgset = Mail::IMAPClient::MessageSet-&gt;new(@msgs);
        print $msgset;  # prints "1,3:6,9:10"

        # add message 14 to the set:
        $msgset += 14;
        print $msgset;  # prints "1,3:6,9:10,14"

        # add messages 16,17,18,19, and 20 to the set:
        $msgset .= "16,17,18:20";
        print $msgset;  # prints "1,3:6,9:10,14,16:20"

        # Hey, I didn't really want message 17 in there; let's take it out:
        $msgset -= 17;
        print $msgset;  # prints "1,3:6,9:10,14,16,18:20"

        # Now let's iterate over each message:
        for my $msg (@$msgset)
        {  print "$msg\n";  # Prints: "1\n3\n4\n5\n6..16\n18\n19\n20\n"
        }
        print join("\n", @$msgset)."\n";     # same simpler
        local $" = "\n"; print "@$msgset\n"; # even more simple

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>Mail::IMAPClient::MessageSet</b> module is designed to make life easier for programmers who need to
       manipulate potentially large sets of IMAP message UID's or sequence numbers.

       This module presents an object-oriented interface into handling your message sets. The object reference
       returned by the new method is an overloaded reference to a scalar variable that contains the message
       set's compact RFC2060 representation. The object is overloaded so that using it like a string returns
       this compact message set representation. You can also add messages to the set (using either a '.='
       operator or a '+=' operator) or remove messages (with the '-=' operator). And if you use it as an array
       reference, it will humor you and act like one by calling unfold for you.

       RFC2060 specifies that multiple messages can be provided to certain IMAP commands by separating them with
       commas. For example, "1,2,3,4,5" would specify messages 1, 2, 3, 4, and (you guessed it!) 5. However, if
       you are performing an operation on lots of messages, this string can get quite long.  So long that it may
       slow down your transaction, and perhaps even cause the server to reject it. So RFC2060 also permits you
       to specify a range of messages, so that messages 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 can also be specified as "1:5".

       This is where <b>Mail::IMAPClient::MessageSet</b> comes in. It will convert your message set into the shortest
       correct syntax. This could potentially save you tons of network I/O, as in the case where you want to
       fetch the flags for all messages in a 10000 message folder, where the messages are all numbered
       sequentially. Delimited as commas, and making the best-case assumption that the first message is message
       "1", it would take 48893 bytes to specify the whole message set using the comma-delimited method. To
       specify it as a range, it takes just seven bytes (1:10000).

       Note that the Mail::IMAPClient <b>Range</b> method can be used as a short-cut to specifying
       "Mail::IMAPClient::MessageSet-&gt;new(@etc)".)

</pre><h4><b>CLASS</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       The only class method you need to worry about is <b>new</b>. And if you create your <b>Mail::IMAPClient::MessageSet</b>
       objects via Mail::IMAPClient's <b>Range</b> method then you don't even need to worry about <b>new</b>.

   <b>new</b>
       Example:

        my $msgset = Mail::IMAPClient::MessageSet-&gt;new(@msgs);

       The <b>new</b> method requires at least one argument. That argument can be either a message, a comma-separated
       list of messages, a colon-separated range of messages, or a combination of comma-separated messages and
       colon-separated ranges. It can also be a reference to an array of messages, comma-separated message
       lists, and colon separated ranges.

       If more then one argument is supplied to <b>new</b>, then those arguments should be more message numbers, lists,
       and ranges (or references to arrays of them) just as in the first argument.

       The message numbers passed to <b>new</b> can really be any kind of number at all but to be useful in a
       Mail::IMAPClient session they should be either message UID's (if your <u>Uid</u> parameter is true) or message
       sequence numbers.

       The <b>new</b> method will return a reference to a <b>Mail::IMAPClient::MessageSet</b> object. That object, when double
       quoted, will act just like a string whose value is the message set expressed in the shortest possible
       way, with the message numbers sorted in ascending order and with duplicates removed.

</pre><h4><b>OBJECT</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       The only object method currently available to a <b>Mail::IMAPClient::MessageSet</b> object is the unfold method.

   <b>unfold</b>
       Example:

           my $msgset = $imap-&gt;Range( $imap-&gt;messages ) ;
           my @all_messages = $msgset-&gt;unfold;

       The <b>unfold</b> method returns an array of messages that belong to the message set. If called in a scalar
       context it returns a reference to the array instead.

</pre><h4><b>OVERRIDDEN</b> <b>OPERATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Mail::IMAPClient::MessageSet</b> overrides a number of operators in order to make manipulating your message
       sets easier. The overridden operations are:

   <b>stringify</b>
       Attempts to stringify a <b>Mail::IMAPClient::MessageSet</b> object will result in the compact message
       specification being returned, which is almost certainly what you will want.

   <b>Auto-increment</b>
       Attempts to autoincrement a <b>Mail::IMAPClient::MessageSet</b> object will result in a message (or messages)
       being added to the object's message set.

       Example:

           $msgset += 34;
           # Message #34 is now in the message set

   <b>Concatenate</b>
       Attempts to concatenate to a <b>Mail::IMAPClient::MessageSet</b> object will result in a message (or messages)
       being added to the object's message set.

       Example:

           $msgset .= "34,35,36,40:45";
           # Messages 34,35,36,40,41,42,43,44,and 45 are now in the message set

       The ".=" operator and the "+=" operator can be used interchangeably, but as you can see by looking at the
       examples there are times when use of one has an aesthetic advantage over use of the other.

   <b>Autodecrement</b>
       Attempts to autodecrement a <b>Mail::IMAPClient::MessageSet</b> object will result in a message being removed
       from the object's message set.

       Examples:

           $msgset -= 34;
           # Message #34 is no longer in the message set
           $msgset -= "1:10";
           # Messages 1 through 10 are no longer in the message set

       If you attempt to remove a message that was not in the original message set then your resulting message
       set will be the same as the original, only more expensive. However, if you attempt to remove several
       messages from the message set and some of those messages were in the message set and some were not, the
       additional overhead of checking for the messages that were not there is negligible. In either case you
       get back the message set you want regardless of whether it was already like that or not.
