           # for older Perls, import into current package:
           use bignum qw/hex oct/;
           print hex("0x1234567890123490");
           print oct("01234567890123490");

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Literal</b> <b>numeric</b> <b>constants</b>
       By default, every literal integer becomes a Math::BigInt object, and literal non-integer becomes a
       Math::BigFloat object. Whether a numeric literal is considered an integer or non-integers depends only on
       the value of the constant, not on how it is represented. For instance, the constants 3.14e2 and 0x1.3ap8
       become Math::BigInt objects, because they both represent the integer value decimal 314.

       The default "use bignum;" is equivalent to

           use bignum downgrade =&gt; "Math::BigInt", upgrade =&gt; "Math::BigFloat";

       The classes used for integers and non-integers can be set at compile time with the "downgrade" and
       "upgrade" options, for example

           # use Math::BigInt for integers and Math::BigRat for non-integers
           use bignum upgrade =&gt; "Math::BigRat";

       Note that disabling downgrading and upgrading does not affect how numeric literals are converted to
       objects

           # disable both downgrading and upgrading
           use bignum downgrade =&gt; undef, upgrade =&gt; undef;
           $x = 2.4;       # becomes 2.4 as a Math::BigFloat
           $y = 2;         # becomes 2 as a Math::BigInt

   <b>Upgrading</b> <b>and</b> <b>downgrading</b>
       By default, when the result of a computation is an integer, an Inf, or a NaN, the result is downgraded
       even when all the operands are instances of the upgrade class.

           use bignum;
           $x = 2.4;       # becomes 2.4 as a Math::BigFloat
           $y = 1.2;       # becomes 1.2 as a Math::BigFloat
           $z = $x / $y;   # becomes 2 as a Math::BigInt due to downgrading

       Equivalently, by default, when the result of a computation is a finite non-integer, the result is
       upgraded even when all the operands are instances of the downgrade class.

           use bignum;
           $x = 7;         # becomes 7 as a Math::BigInt
           $y = 2;         # becomes 2 as a Math::BigInt
           $z = $x / $y;   # becomes 3.5 as a Math::BigFloat due to upgrading

       The classes used for downgrading and upgrading can be set at runtime with the "<b>downgrade()</b>" and
       "<b>upgrade()</b>" methods, but see "CAVEATS" below.

       The upgrade and downgrade classes don't have to be Math::BigInt and Math::BigFloat. For example, to use
       Math::BigRat as the upgrade class, use

           use bignum upgrade =&gt; "Math::BigRat";
           $x = 2;         # becomes 2 as a Math::BigInt
           $y = 3.6;       # becomes 18/5 as a Math::BigRat

       The upgrade and downgrade classes can be modified at runtime

           use bignum;
           $x = 3;         # becomes 3 as a Math::BigInt
           $y = 2;         # becomes 2 as a Math::BigInt
           $z = $x / $y;   # becomes 1.5 as a Math::BigFlaot

           bignum -&gt; upgrade("Math::BigRat");
           $w = $x / $y;   # becomes 3/2 as a Math::BigRat

       Disabling downgrading doesn't change the fact that literal constant integers are converted to the
       downgrade class, it only prevents downgrading as a result of a computation. E.g.,

           use bignum downgrade =&gt; undef;
           $x = 2;         # becomes 2 as a Math::BigInt
           $y = 2.4;       # becomes 2.4 as a Math::BigFloat
           $z = 1.2;       # becomes 1.2 as a Math::BigFloat
           $w = $x / $y;   # becomes 2 as a Math::BigFloat due to no downgrading

       If you want all numeric literals, both integers and non-integers, to become Math::BigFloat objects, use
       the bigfloat pragma.

       Equivalently, disabling upgrading doesn't change the fact that literal constant non-integers are
       converted to the upgrade class, it only prevents upgrading as a result of a computation. E.g.,

           use bignum upgrade =&gt; undef;
           $x = 2.5;       # becomes 2.5 as a Math::BigFloat
           $y = 7;         # becomes 7 as a Math::BigInt
           $z = 2;         # becomes 2 as a Math::BigInt
           $w = $x / $y;   # becomes 3 as a Math::BigInt due to no upgrading

       If you want all numeric literals, both integers and non-integers, to become Math::BigInt objects, use the
       bigint pragma.

       You can even do

           use bignum upgrade =&gt; "Math::BigRat", upgrade =&gt; undef;

       which converts all integer literals to Math::BigInt objects and all non-integer literals to Math::BigRat
       objects. However, when the result of a computation involving two Math::BigInt objects results in a non-
       integer (e.g., 7/2), the result will be truncted to a Math::BigInt rather than being upgraded to a
       Math::BigRat, since upgrading is disabled.

   <b>Overloading</b>
       Since all numeric literals become objects, you can call all the usual methods from Math::BigInt and
       Math::BigFloat on them. This even works to some extent on expressions:

           perl -Mbignum -le '$x = 1234; print $x-&gt;bdec()'
           perl -Mbignum -le 'print 1234-&gt;copy()-&gt;binc();'
           perl -Mbignum -le 'print 1234-&gt;copy()-&gt;binc()-&gt;<a href="../man6/badd.6.html">badd</a>(6);'

   <b>Options</b>
       "bignum" recognizes some options that can be passed while loading it via via "use". The following options
       exist:

       a or accuracy
           This  sets  the accuracy for all math operations. The argument must be greater than or equal to zero.
           See Math::BigInt's <b>bround()</b> method for details.

               perl -Mbignum=a,50 -le 'print <a href="../man20/sqrt.20.html">sqrt</a>(20)'

           Note that setting precision and accuracy at the same time is not possible.

       p or precision
           This sets the precision for all math operations. The argument can be  any  integer.  Negative  values
           mean  a  fixed  number of digits after the dot, while a positive value rounds to this digit left from
           the dot. 0 means round to integer.  See Math::BigInt's <b>bfround()</b> method for details.

               perl -Mbignum=p,-50 -le 'print <a href="../man20/sqrt.20.html">sqrt</a>(20)'

           Note that setting precision and accuracy at the same time is not possible.

       l, lib, try, or only
           Load a different math lib, see "Math Library".

               perl -Mbignum=l,GMP -e 'print 2 ** 512'
               perl -Mbignum=lib,GMP -e 'print 2 ** 512'
               perl -Mbignum=try,GMP -e 'print 2 ** 512'
               perl -Mbignum=only,GMP -e 'print 2 ** 512'

       hex Override the built-in <b>hex()</b> method with a version that can handle big numbers.  This overrides it  by
           exporting  it  to  the  current  package. Under Perl v5.10.0 and higher, this is not so necessary, as
           <b>hex()</b> is lexically overridden in the current scope whenever the "bignum" pragma is active.

       oct Override the built-in <b>oct()</b> method with a version that can handle big numbers.  This overrides it  by
           exporting  it  to  the  current  package. Under Perl v5.10.0 and higher, this is not so necessary, as
           <b>oct()</b> is lexically overridden in the current scope whenever the "bignum" pragma is active.

       v or version
           this prints out the name and version of the modules and then exits.

               perl -Mbignum=v

   <b>Math</b> <b>Library</b>
       Math with the numbers is done (by default) by a backend library  module  called  Math::BigInt::Calc.  The
       default is equivalent to saying:

           use bignum lib =&gt; 'Calc';

       you can change this by using:

           use bignum lib =&gt; 'GMP';

       The  following would first try to find Math::BigInt::Foo, then Math::BigInt::Bar, and if this also fails,
       revert to Math::BigInt::Calc:

           use bignum lib =&gt; 'Foo,Math::BigInt::Bar';

       Using c&lt;lib&gt; warns if none of the specified libraries can be found and  Math::BigInt  and  Math::BigFloat
       fell back to one of the default libraries. To suppress this warning, use "try" instead:

           use bignum try =&gt; 'GMP';

       If you want the code to die instead of falling back, use "only" instead:

           use bignum only =&gt; 'GMP';

       Please see respective module documentation for further details.

   <b>Method</b> <b>calls</b>
       Since  all  numbers  are  now  objects,  you  can  use  the methods that are part of the Math::BigInt and
       Math::BigFloat API.

       But a warning is in order. When using the following to make a copy of a number, only a shallow copy  will
       be made.

           $x = 9; $y = $x;
           $x = $y = 7;

       Using the copy or the original with overloaded math is okay, e.g., the following work:

           $x = 9; $y = $x;
           print $x + 1, " ", $y,"\n";     # prints 10 9

       but  calling  any  method that modifies the number directly will result in <b>both</b> the original and the copy
       being destroyed:

           $x = 9; $y = $x;
           print $x-&gt;<a href="../man1/badd.1.html">badd</a>(1), " ", $y,"\n";        # prints 10 10

           $x = 9; $y = $x;
           print $x-&gt;<a href="../man1/binc.1.html">binc</a>(1), " ", $y,"\n";        # prints 10 10

           $x = 9; $y = $x;
           print $x-&gt;<a href="../man2/bmul.2.html">bmul</a>(2), " ", $y,"\n";        # prints 18 18

       Using methods that do not modify, but test that the contents works:

           $x = 9; $y = $x;
           $z = 9 if $x-&gt;is_zero();                # works fine

       See the documentation about the copy constructor and "=" in overload, as well  as  the  documentation  in
       Math::BigFloat for further details.

   <b>Methods</b>
       <b>inf()</b>
           A  shortcut  to  return "inf" as an object. Useful because Perl does not always handle bareword "inf"
           properly.

       <b>NaN()</b>
           A shortcut to return "NaN" as an object. Useful because Perl does not always  handle  bareword  "NaN"
           properly.

       e
               # perl -Mbignum=e -wle 'print e'

           Returns Euler's number "e", aka <b><a href="../man1/exp.1.html">exp</a></b>(1) (= 2.7182818284...).

       PI
               # perl -Mbignum=PI -wle 'print PI'

           Returns PI (= 3.1415926532..).

       <b>bexp()</b>
               bexp($power, $accuracy);

           Returns Euler's number "e" raised to the appropriate power, to the wanted accuracy.

           Example:

               # perl -Mbignum=bexp -wle 'print bexp(1,80)'

       <b>bpi()</b>
               bpi($accuracy);

           Returns PI to the wanted accuracy.

           Example:

               # perl -Mbignum=bpi -wle 'print <a href="../man80/bpi.80.html">bpi</a>(80)'

       <b>accuracy()</b>
           Set or get the accuracy.

       <b>precision()</b>
           Set or get the precision.

       <b>round_mode()</b>
           Set or get the rounding mode.

       <b>div_scale()</b>
           Set or get the division scale.

       <b>upgrade()</b>
           Set  or  get the class that the downgrade class upgrades to, if any. Set the upgrade class to "undef"
           to disable upgrading. See "/CAVEATS" below.

       <b>downgrade()</b>
           Set or get the class that the upgrade class downgrades to, if any. Set the downgrade class to "undef"
           to disable upgrading. See "CAVEATS" below.

       <b>in_effect()</b>
               use bignum;

               print "in effect\n" if bignum::in_effect;       # true
               {
                   no bignum;
                   print "in effect\n" if bignum::in_effect;   # false
               }

           Returns true or false if "bignum" is in effect in the current scope.

           This method only works on Perl v5.9.4 or later.

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>upgrade()</b> and <b>downgrade()</b> methods
           Note that setting both the upgrade  and  downgrade  classes  at  runtime  with  the  "<b>upgrade()</b>"  and
           "<b>downgrade()</b>" methods, might not do what you expect:

               # Assuming that downgrading and upgrading hasn't been modified so far, so
               # the downgrade and upgrade classes are Math::BigInt and Math::BigFloat,
               # respectively, the following sets the upgrade class to Math::BigRat, i.e.,
               # makes Math::BigInt upgrade to Math::BigRat:

               bignum -&gt; upgrade("Math::BigRat");

               # The following sets the downgrade class to Math::BigInt::Lite, i.e., makes
               # the new upgrade class Math::BigRat downgrade to Math::BigInt::Lite

               bignum -&gt; downgrade("Math::BigInt::Lite");

               # Note that at this point, it is still Math::BigInt, not Math::BigInt::Lite,
               # that upgrades to Math::BigRat, so to get Math::BigInt::Lite to upgrade to
               # Math::BigRat, we need to do the following (again):

               bignum -&gt; upgrade("Math::BigRat");

           A simpler way to do this at runtime is to use <b>import()</b>,

               bignum -&gt; import(upgrade =&gt; "Math::BigRat",
                                downgrade =&gt; "Math::BigInt::Lite");

       Hexadecimal, octal, and binary floating point literals
           Perl  (and  this module) accepts hexadecimal, octal, and binary floating point literals, but use them
           with care with Perl versions before v5.32.0, because some versions of Perl silently  give  the  wrong
           result.

       Operator vs literal overloading
           "bigrat"  works  by  overloading  handling of integer and floating point literals, converting them to
           Math::BigRat objects.

           This means that arithmetic involving only string values or string literals are performed using Perl's
           built-in operators.

           For example:

               use bigrat;
               my $x = "900000000000000009";
               my $y = "900000000000000007";
               print $x - $y;

           outputs 0 on default 32-bit builds, since "bignum" never sees the  string  literals.  To  ensure  the
           expression is all treated as "Math::BigFloat" objects, use a literal number in the expression:

               print +(0+$x) - $y;

       Ranges
           Perl  does  not  allow  overloading  of  ranges,  so  you can neither safely use ranges with "bignum"
           endpoints, nor is the iterator variable a "Math::BigFloat".

               use 5.010;
               for my $i (12..13) {
                 for my $j (20..21) {
                   say $i ** $j;  # produces a floating-point number,
                                  # not an object
                 }
               }

       <b>in_effect()</b>
           This method only works on Perl v5.9.4 or later.

       <b>hex()</b>/<b>oct()</b>
           "bignum" overrides these routines with versions that can also handle big integer values.  Under  Perl
           prior  to  version  v5.9.4, however, this will not happen unless you specifically ask for it with the
           two import tags "hex" and "oct" - and then it will be global and cannot be disabled  inside  a  scope
           with "no bignum":

               use bignum qw/hex oct/;

               print hex("0x1234567890123456");
               {
                   no bignum;
                   print hex("0x1234567890123456");
               }

           The second call to <b>hex()</b> will warn about a non-portable constant.

           Compare this to:

               use bignum;

               # will warn only under Perl older than v5.9.4
               print hex("0x1234567890123456");
