</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module provides an object oriented perl interface to the Internet Route Registry.  The interface
       uses the RIPE/RPSL Tool Query Language as defined in Appendix B of the IRRd User Guide.  The guide can be
       found at <a href="http://www.irrd.net/">http://www.irrd.net/</a>, however an understanding of the query language is not required to use this
       module.

       Net::IRR supports IRRd's multiple-command mode.  Multiple-command mode is good for intensive queries
       since only one TCP connection needs to be made for multiple queries.  The interface also allows for
       additional queries that aren't supported by standard UNIX <u>whois</u> utitilies.

       Hopefully this module will stimulate development of new Route Registry tools written in Perl.  An example
       of Route Registry tools can be found by googling for RAToolset which is now known as the IRRToolset.  The
       RAToolset was originally developed by ISI, <a href="http://www.isi.edu/">http://www.isi.edu/</a>, and is now maintained by RIPE,
       <a href="http://www.ripe.net/">http://www.ripe.net/</a>.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       Net::IRR-&gt;connect( host =&gt; $hostname, port =&gt; $port_number )
           This  class  method  is  used to connect to a route registry server.  Net::IRR-&gt;<b>connect()</b> is also the
           constructor for the Net::IRR class.  The constructor returns a Net::IRR object upon connection to the
           IRR server or undef upon failure.

       $whois-&gt;<b>disconnect()</b>
           This method closes the connection to the route registry server.

       $whois-&gt;<b>quit()</b>
           Same as $whois-&gt;<b>disconnect()</b>.

       $whois-&gt;get_routes_by_origin('AS5650')
           Get routes with a specified origin AS.  This method takes an autonomous system number and returns the
           set of routes it originates.  Upon success this method returns a list of routes in list context or  a
           string of space separated routes. undef is returned upon failure.

       $whois-&gt;get_ipv6_routes_by_origin('AS5650')
           Same as $whois-&gt;<b>get_routes_by_origin()</b>, but returns IPv6 instead of IPv4 routes.

       $whois-&gt;get_routes_by_community($community_name)
           This method is for RIPE-181 only.  It is not supported by RPSL.  This method takes a community object
           name  and returns the set of routes it originates.  Upon success this method returns a list of routes
           in list context or a string of space separated routes.  undef is returned upon failure.

       $whois-&gt;<b>get_sync_info()</b>
           This method provides database synchronization information.  This makes it possible to view the mirror
           status of a database.  This method optionally takes the name of a  database  such  as  RADB.   If  no
           argument  is  given  the  method  will  return  information  about all databases originating from and
           mirrored by the registry server.  If the optional argument is given the database  specified  will  be
           checked  and  it's  status returned.  This method returns undef if no database exists or if access is
           denied.

       $whois-&gt;get_as_set("AS-ELI", 1)
           This method takes an AS-SET object name and returns the ASNs registered for the AS-SET  object.   The
           method  takes  an  optional  second  argument  which enables AS-SET key expansion since an AS-SET can
           contain both ASNs and AS-SET keys.  undef is returned upon failure.

       $whois-&gt;get_route_set("ROUTES-ELI", 1)
           This method takes an ROUTE-SET object name and  returns  the  ROUTEs  registered  for  the  ROUTE-SET
           object.   The  method takes an optional second argument which enables ROUTE-SET key expansion since a
           ROUTE-SET can contain both ROUTEs and ROUTE-SET keys.  undef is returned upon failure.

       $whois-&gt;match('aut-num', 'AS5650'); - get RPSL objects registered in the database
           The example above will retrieve the aut-num object with the key AS5650.  This method will return  the
           first  RPSL  object  matching  the  object  type and name specified as parameters to $whois-&gt;<b>match()</b>.
           undef is returned upon failure.

       $whois-&gt;<b>get_irrd_version()</b>
           This methods takes no arguments and returns the version of the IRRd server that was specified as  the
           hostname to the <b>connect()</b> method.

       $whois-&gt;route_search("208.186.0.0/15", EXACT_MATCH)
           The  method  is  used  to  search  for route objects.  The method takes two arguments, a route and an
           optional flag.   The  flag  can  be  one  of  four  values:  EXACT_MATCH,  LEVEL_ONE,  LESS_SPECIFIC,
           MORE_SPECIFIC.   These  constants  can  be  imported  into your namespace by using the :all or :route
           export tag when importing the Net::IRR module.

               use Net::IRR qw( :route );

               print "EXACT_MATCH = " . EXACT_MATCH . "\n";

       $whois-&gt;<b>sources()</b>
           This method is used to both get and set the databases used for Internet Route Registry queries.   The
           $whois-&gt;<b>sources()</b>  method  accepts  a  list of databases in the order they should be searched.  If no
           arguments are given the method will return a list of all the databases mirrored by the route registry
           you are connected to.

       $whois-&gt;update($database, 'ADD', $rpsl_rr_object)
           This method is used to add or delete a database object.  This  method  takes  three  arguments.   The
           first  argument  is  the  database  to update.  The second argument is the action which can be either
           "ADD" or "DEL".  The third and final required argument is a route object in RPSL format.

       $whois-&gt;<b>error()</b>
           Most Net::IRR methods set an error message when errors occur.  These errors can only be  accessed  by
           using the <b>error()</b> method.
