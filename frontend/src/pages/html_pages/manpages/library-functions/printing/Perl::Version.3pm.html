           use Perl::Version;

           # Init from string
           my $version = Perl::Version-&gt;new( '1.2.3' );

           # Stringification preserves original format
           print "$version\n";                 # prints '1.2.3'

           # Normalised
           print $version-&gt;normal, "\n";       # prints 'v1.2.3'

           # Numified
           print $version-&gt;numify, "\n";       # prints '1.002003'

           # Explicitly stringified
           print $version-&gt;stringify, "\n";    # prints '1.2.3'

           # Increment the subversion (the third component)

           # Normalised
           print $version-&gt;normal, "\n";       # prints 'v1.2.4'

           # Numified
           print $version-&gt;numify, "\n";       # prints '1.002004'

           # Refer to subversion component by position ( zero based )
           $version-&gt;increment( 2 );

           print "$version\n";                 # prints '1.2.5'

           # Increment the version (second component) which sets all
           # components to the right of it to zero.
           $version-&gt;inc_version;

           print "$version\n";                 # prints '1.3.0'

           # Increment the revision (main version number)
           $version-&gt;inc_revision;

           print "$version\n";                 # prints '2.0.0'

           # Increment the alpha number
           $version-&gt;inc_alpha;

           print "$version\n";                 # prints '2.0.0_001'

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Perl::Version provides a simple interface for parsing, manipulating and formatting Perl version strings.

       Unlike version.pm (which concentrates on parsing and comparing version strings) Perl::Version is designed
       for cases where you'd like to parse a version, modify it and get back the modified version formatted like
       the original.

       For example:

           my $version = Perl::Version-&gt;new( '1.2.3' );
           $version-&gt;inc_version;
           print "$version\n";

       prints

           1.3.0

       whereas

           my $version = Perl::Version-&gt;new( 'v1.02.03' );
           $version-&gt;inc_version;
           print "$version\n";

       prints

           v1.03.00

       Both are representations of the same version and they'd compare equal but their formatting is different.

       Perl::Version tries hard to guess and recreate the format of the original version and in most cases it
       succeeds. In rare cases the formatting is ambiguous. Consider

           1.10.03

       Do you suppose that second component '10' is zero padded like the third component? Perl::Version will
       assume that it is:

           my $version = Perl::Version-&gt;new( '1.10.03' );
           $version-&gt;inc_revision;
           print "$version\n";

       will print

           2.00.00

       If all of the components after the first are the same length (two characters in this case) and any of
       them begins with a zero Perl::Version will assume that they're all zero padded to the same length.

       The first component and any alpha suffix are handled separately. In each case if either of them starts
       with a zero they will be zero padded to the same length when stringifying the version.

   <b>Version</b> <b>Formats</b>
       Perl::Version supports a few different version string formats.

        1, 1.2
           Versions that look like a number. If you pass a numeric value its string equivalent will be parsed:

               my $version = Perl::Version-&gt;new( 1.2 );
               print "$version\n";

           prints

               1.2

           In  fact  there is no special treatment for versions that resemble decimal numbers. This is worthy of
           comment only because it differs from version.pm which treats actual numbers used  as  versions  as  a
           special case and performs various transformations on the stored version.

        1.2.3, 1.2.3.4
           Simple versions with three or more components.

        v1.2.3
           Versions with a leading 'v'.

        5.8, 5.08, 5.008006
           Fielded  numeric  versions.  If  a  version  string has a single decimal point, it extracts digits in
           groups of three after the decimal point.  If there are fewer than three digits in  the  final  group,
           the  field is left-padded with zeros to make it three digits (for example, 5.8 becomes 5.008 and 5.08
           becomes 5.008 too). This is opposite of how Perl and CPAN has historically treated versions by  right
           padding groups of three on.

           For example

               my $version = Perl::Version-&gt;new( 1.002003004005006 );
               print $version-&gt;normal;

           prints

               v1.2.3.4.5.6

       vstring
           Perls  later  than  5.8.1  support  vstring  format. A vstring looks like a number with more than one
           decimal point and (optionally) a leading 'v'. The 'v' is mandatory for vstrings containing fewer than
           two decimal points.

           Perl::Version will successfully parse vstrings

               my $version = Perl::Version-&gt;new( v1.2 );
               print "$version\n";

           prints

               v1.2

           Note that stringifying a Perl::Version constructed from a vstring will result in  a  regular  string.
           Because  it  has  no way of knowing whether the vstring constant had a 'v' prefix it always generates
           one when stringifying back to a version string.

       CVS version
           A common idiom for users of CVS is to use keyword replacement to  generate  a  version  automatically
           like this:

               $VERSION = version-&gt;new( qw$Revision: 2.7 $ );

           Perl::Version does the right thing with such versions so that

               my $version = Perl::Version-&gt;new( qw$Revision: 2.7 $ );
               $version-&gt;inc_revision;
               print "$version\n";

           prints

               Revision: 3.0

       <u>Real</u> <u>Numbers</u>

       Real  numbers are stringified before parsing. This has two implications: trailing zeros after the decimal
       point will be lost and any underscore characters in the number are discarded.

       Perl allows underscores anywhere in numeric constants as an aid to formatting. These are  discarded  when
       Perl converts the number into its internal format. This means that

           # Numeric version
           print Perl::Version-&gt;new( 1.001_001 )-&gt;stringify;

       prints

           1.001001

       but

           # String version
           print Perl::Version-&gt;new( '1.001_001' )-&gt;stringify;

       prints

           1.001_001

       as expected.

       In general you should probably avoid versions expressed either as decimal numbers or vstrings. The safest
       option is to pass a regular string to Perl::Version-&gt;<b>new()</b>.

       <u>Alpha</u> <u>Versions</u>

       By  convention  if  a  version  string  has suffix that consists of an underscore followed by one or more
       digits it represents an alpha or developer  release.  CPAN  treats  modules  with  such  version  strings
       specially to reflect their alpha status.

       This  alpha  notation  is one reason why using decimal numbers as versions is a bad idea. Underscore is a
       valid character in numeric constants which is discarded by Perl when a program's source is parsed so  any
       intended alpha suffix will become part of the version number.

       To be considered alpha a version must have a non-zero alpha component like this

           3.0.4_001

       Generally the alpha component will be formatted with leading zeros but this is not a requirement.

   <b>Component</b> <b>Naming</b>
       A  version  number  consists of a series of components. By Perl convention the first three components are
       named 'revision', 'version' and 'subversion':

           $ perl -V
           Summary of my perl5 (revision 5 version 8 subversion 6) configuration:

           (etc)

       Perl::Version follows that convention. Any component may be accessed by passing a number from 0 to N-1 to
       the component or increment but for convenience the  first  three  components  are  aliased  as  revision,
       version and subversion.

           $version-&gt;increment( 0 );

       is the same as

           $version-&gt;inc_revision;

       and

           my $subv = $version-&gt;subversion;

       is the same as

           my $subv = $version-&gt;component( 2 );

       The alpha component is named 'alpha'.

   <b>Comparison</b> <b>with</b> <b>version.pm</b>
       If you're familiar with version.pm you'll notice that there's a certain amount of overlap between what it
       does  and  this  module.  I  originally  created  this module as a mutable subclass of version.pm but the
       requirement to be able to reformat a modified version to match the formatting of the original didn't  sit
       well with version.pm's internals.

       As a result this module is not dependent or based on version.pm.

</pre><h4><b>INTERFACE</b></h4><pre>
       "new"
           Create  a  new  Perl::Version  by  parsing a version string. As discussed above a number of different
           version formats are supported. Along with the value of the version formatting information is captured
           so that the version can be modified and the updated  value  retrieved  in  the  same  format  as  the
           original.

               my @version = (
                   '1.3.0',    'v1.03.00',     '1.10.03', '2.00.00',
                   '1.2',      'v1.2.3.4.5.6', 'v1.2',    'Revision: 3.0',
                   '1.001001', '1.001_001',    '3.0.4_001',
               );

               for my $v ( @version ) {
                   my $version = Perl::Version-&gt;new( $v );
                   $version-&gt;inc_version;
                   print "$version\n";
               }

           prints

               1.4.0
               v1.04.00
               1.11.00
               2.01.00
               1.3
               v1.3.0.0.0.0
               v1.3
               Revision: 3.1
               1.002000
               1.002
               3.1.0

           In each case the incremented version is formatted in the same way as the original.

           If no arguments are passed an empty version intialised to 'v0' will be constructed.

           In order to support CVS version syntax

               my $version = Perl::Version-&gt;new( qw$Revision: 2.7 $ );

           "new"  may  be  passed an array in which case it concatenates all of its arguments with spaces before
           parsing the result.

           If the string can't be parsed as a version "new" will croak with a suitable  error.  See  DIAGNOSTICS
           for more information.

   <b>Accessors</b>
       "component"
           Set or get one of the components of a version.

               # Set the subversion
               $version-&gt;component( 2, 17 );

               # Get the revision
               my $rev = $version-&gt;component( 0 );

           Instead of a component number you may pass a name: 'revision', 'version', 'subversion' or 'alpha':

               my $rev = $version-&gt;component( 'revision' );

       "components"
           Get or set all of the components of a version.

               # Set the number of components
               $version-&gt;components( 4 );

               # Get the number of components
               my $parts = $version-&gt;components;

               # Get the individual components as an array
               my @parts = $version-&gt;components;

               # Set the components from an array
               $version-&gt;components( [ 5, 9, 2 ] );

           Hmm. That's a lot of interface for one subroutine. Sorry about that.

       "revision"
           Alias for component( 0 ). Gets or sets the revision component.

       "version"
           Alias for component( 1 ). Gets or sets the version component.

       "subversion"
           Alias for component( 2 ). Gets or sets the subversion component.

       "alpha"
           Get or set the alpha component of a version. Returns 0 for versions with no alpha.

               # Set alpha
               $version-&gt;alpha( 12 );

               # Get alpha
               my $alp = $version-&gt;alpha;

       "is_alpha"
           Return true if a version has a non-zero alpha component.

       "set"
           Set the version to match another version preserving the formatting of this version.

               $version-&gt;set( $other_version );

           You may also set the version from a literal string:

               $version-&gt;set( '1.2.3' );

           The  version  will  be  updated  to  the  value  of  the  version  string but will retain its current
           formatting.

   <b>Incrementing</b>
       "increment"
           Increment a component of a version.

               my $version = Perl::Version-&gt;new( '3.1.4' );
               $version-&gt;increment( 1 );
               print "$version\n";

           prints

               3.2.0

           Components to the right of the incremented component will be set to zero as will any alpha component.

           As an alternative to passing a component number one of the  predefined  component  names  'revision',
           'version', 'subversion' or 'alpha' may be passed.

       "inc_alpha"
           Increment a version's alpha component.

       "inc_revision"
           Increment a version's revision component.

       "inc_subversion"
           Increment a version's subversion component.

       "inc_version"
           Increment a version's version component.

   <b>Formatting</b>
       "normal"
           Return a normalised representation of a version.

               my $version = Perl::Version-&gt;new( '5.008007_01' );
               print $version-&gt;normal, "\n";

           prints

               v5.8.7_01

       "numify"
           Return  a  numeric representation of a version. The numeric form is most frequently used for versions
           of Perl itself.

               my $version = Perl::Version-&gt;new( '5.8.7_1' );
               print $version-&gt;numify, "\n";

           prints

               5.008007_001

       "stringify"
           Return the version formatted as closely as possible to the version from which it was initialised.

               my $version = Perl::Version-&gt;new( '5.008007_01' );
               $version-&gt;inc_alpha;
               print $version-&gt;stringify, "\n";

           prints

               5.008007_02

           and

               my $version = Perl::Version-&gt;new( '5.8.7_1' );
               $version-&gt;inc_alpha;
               print $version-&gt;stringify, "\n";

           prints

               5.8.7_2

   <b>Comparison</b>
       "vcmp"
           Perform 'spaceship' comparison between two version and return -1, 0 or 1 depending on their ordering.
           Comparisons are semantically correct so that

               my $v1 = Perl::Version-&gt;new( '1.002001' );
               my $v2 = Perl::Version-&gt;new( '1.1.3' );

               print ($v1-&gt;vcmp( $v2 ) &gt; 0 ? 'yes' : 'no'), "\n";

           prints

               yes

   <b>Overloaded</b> <b>Operators</b>
       "&lt;=&gt;" and "cmp"
           The "&lt;=&gt;" and "cmp" operators are overloaded  (by  the  vcmp  method)  so  that  comparisons  between
           versions  work  as  expected.  This means that the other numeric and string comparison operators also
           work as expected.

               my $v1 = Perl::Version-&gt;new( '1.002001' );
               my $v2 = Perl::Version-&gt;new( '1.1.3' );

               print "OK!\n" if $v1 &gt; $v2;

           prints

               OK!

       "" (stringification)
           Perl::Version objects are converted to strings by calling the stringify method. This usually  results
           in formatting close to that of the original version string.

   <b>Constants</b>
       "REGEX"
           An  unanchored regular expression that matches any of the version formats supported by Perl::Version.
           Three captures get the prefix part, the main body of the version and any alpha suffix respectively.

               my $version = 'v1.2.3.4_5';
               my ($prefix, $main, $suffix) = ($version =~ Perl::Version::REGEX);
               print "$prefix\n$main\n$suffix\n";

           prints

               v
               1.2.3.4
               _5

       "MATCH"
           An anchored regular expression that matches a correctly formatted version string. Five  captures  get
           any  leading  whitespace,  the  prefix  part,  the main body of the version, any alpha suffix and any
           trailing spaces respectively.

   <b>Error</b> <b>messages</b>
       "Illegal version string: %s"
           The version string supplied to "new" can't be parsed as a valid version. Valid  versions  match  this
           regex:

               qr/ ( (?i: Revision: \s+ ) | v | )
                     ( \d+ (?: [.] \d+)* )
                     ( (?: _ \d+ )? ) /x;

       "new must be called as a class or object method"
           "new" can't be called as a normal subroutine. Use

               $version_object-&gt;new( '1.2.3' );

           or

               Perl::Version-&gt;new( '1.2.3' );

           instead of

               Perl::Version::new( '1.2.3' );

       "Unknown component name: %s"
           You've  attempted  to  access a component by name using a name that isn't recognised. Valid component
           names are 'revision', 'version', 'subversion' and 'alpha'. Case is not significant.

       "Can't compare with %s"
           You've tried to compare a Perl::Version with something other than  a  version  string,  a  number  or
           another Perl::Version.

       "Can't set the number of components to 0"
           Versions must have at least one component.

       "You must specify a component number"
           You've  called  component  or  increment  without specifying the number (or name) of the component to
           access.

       "Component %s is out of range 0..%s"
           You've attempted to increment a component of a version but you've specified a component that  doesn't
           exist within the version:

               # Fails
               my $version = Perl::Version-&gt;new( '1.4' );
               $version-&gt;increment( 2 );

           Slightly confusingly you'll see this message even if you specified the component number implicitly by
           using one of the named convenience accessors.
