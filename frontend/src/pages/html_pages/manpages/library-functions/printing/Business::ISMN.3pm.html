</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Methods</b>
       new($ismn)
           The constructor accepts a scalar representing the ISMN.

           The  string representing the ISMN may contain characters other than "[0-9mM]", although these will be
           removed in the internal representation.  The resulting string must look like  an  ISMN  -  the  first
           character is an 'M' and the following nine characters must be digits.

           The  constructor attempts to determine the country code and the publisher code.  If these data cannot
           be determined, the constructor sets "$obj-&gt;is_valid" to something other than "GOOD_ISMN".  An  object
           is still returned and it is up to the program to check "$obj-&gt;is_valid" for one of five values (which
           may  be  exported on demand). The actual values of these symbolic versions are the same as those from
           previous versions of this module which used literal values.

                   Business::ISMN::INVALID_PUBLISHER_CODE
                   Business::ISMN::BAD_CHECKSUM
                   Business::ISMN::GOOD_ISMN
                   Business::ISMN::BAD_ISMN

           The string passed as the ISMN need not be a valid ISMN as long as it superficially  looks  like  one.
           This  allows  one to use the fix_checksum() method.  Despite the disclaimer in the discussion of that
           method, the author has found it extremely useful.  One should check the validity  of  the  ISMN  with
           is_valid()  rather  than  relying  on the return value of the constructor.  If all one wants to do is
           check  the  validity  of  an  ISMN,  one  can  skip  the  object-oriented  interface  and   use   the
           is_valid_checksum() function which is exportable on demand.

           If  the  constructor  decides  it cannot create an object, it returns "undef".  It may do this if the
           string passed as the ISMN cannot be munged to the internal format meaning that it does not even  come
           close to looking like an ISMN.

       ismn
           Returns the ISMN as a string

       country
       publisher
           Returns  the  country associated with the publisher code. This method was formerly called "publisher"
           (and that still works), but it's really returns a two letter country code.

       publisher_code
           Returns the publisher code or "undef" if no publisher code was found.

       article_code
           Returns the article code or "undef" if no article code was found.

       checksum
           Returns the checksum or "undef" if no publisher code was found.

       hyphen_positions
           Returns the list of hyphen positions as  determined  from  the  country  and  publisher  codes.   the
           "as_string"  method  provides  a  way to temporarily override these positions and to even forego them
           altogether.

       <b>as_string()</b>,  as_string([])
           Return the ISMN as a string.  This function takes an optional anonymous array  (or  array  reference)
           that  specifies  the  placement of hyphens in the string.  An empty anonymous array produces a string
           with no hyphens. An empty argument list automatically hyphenates the ISMN  based  on  the  discovered
           publisher code.  An ISMN that is not valid may produce strange results.

           The  positions  specified  in  the passed anonymous array are only used for one method use and do not
           replace the values specified by the constructor. The method assumes that you know what you are  doing
           and  will  attempt  to  use  the  least three positions specified.  If you pass an anonymous array of
           several positions, the list will be sorted and the lowest three positions will  be  used.   Positions
           less than 1 and greater than 9 are silently ignored.

       is_valid
           Returns  "Business::ISMN::GOOD_ISMN" if the checksum is valid and the country and publisher codes are
           defined.

           Returns "Business::ISMN::BAD_CHECKSUM" if the ISMN does not pass the checksum test.  The  constructor
           accepts invalid ISMN's so that they might be fixed with "fix_checksum".

           Returns "Business::ISMN::INVALID_PUBLISHER_CODE" if a publisher code could not be determined.

           Returns "Business::ISMN::BAD_ISMN" if the string has no hope of ever looking like a valid ISMN.  This
           might include strings such as "abc", "123456", and so on.

       is_valid_country_code
       is_valid_publisher_code
           Returns true if the country code is valid, and false otherwise.

           This method was formerly called "is_valid_publisher_code". That's deprecated but still there.

       <b>fix_checksum()</b>
           Replace the tenth character with the checksum the corresponds to the previous nine digits.  This does
           not  guarantee  that  the  ISMN  corresponds  to  the  product  one  thinks it does, or that the ISMN
           corresponds to any product at all.  It only produces a string that passes the checksum  routine.   If
           the  ISMN  passed  to the constructor was invalid, the error might have been in any of the other nine
           positions.

       $obj-&gt;<b>as_ean()</b>
           Converts the ISMN to the equivalent EAN (European Article Number).  No pricing  extension  is  added.
           Returns  the EAN as a string.  This method can also be used as an exportable function since it checks
           its argument list to determine what to do.

       <b>png_barcode()</b>
           Creates a PNG image of the EAN13 barcode which corresponds to  the  ISMN.  Returns  the  image  as  a
           string.

   <b>EXPORTABLE</b> <b>FUNCTIONS</b>
       Some  functions  can be used without the object interface.  These do not use object technology behind the
       scenes.

       is_valid_checksum('M021765430')
           Takes  the  ISMN  string  and  runs  it   through   the   checksum   comparison   routine.    Returns
           "Business::ISMN::GOOD_ISMN"  if the ISMN is valid, "Business::ISMN::BAD_CHECKSUM" if the string looks
           like an ISMN but has an invalid checksum, and "Business::ISMN::BAD_ISMN" if the string does not  look
           like an ISMN.

       ismn_to_ean('M021765430')
           Takes the ISMN string and converts it to the equivalent EAN string.  This function checks for a valid
           ISMN  and will return undef for invalid ISMNs, otherwise it returns the EAN as a string.  Uses as_ean
           internally, which checks its arguments to determine what to do.

       ean_to_ismn('9790021765439')
           Takes the EAN string and converts it to the equivalent ISMN string.  This function checks for a valid
           ISMN and will return undef for invalid ISMNs, otherwise it returns the EAN as a string.  Uses  as_ean
           internally, which checks its arguments to determine what to do.
