</pre><h4><b>EVENT</b> <b>HANDLER</b> <b>CALLBACKS</b></h4><pre>
       The  Aqua/macOS  application  environment  defines a number of additional events that applications should
       respond to. These events are mapped by Tk to  calls  to  commands  in  the  <b>::tk::mac</b>  namespace;  unless
       otherwise noted, if the command is absent, no action will be taken.

       <b>::tk::mac::DoScriptFile</b>
              The  default  Apple  Event handler for AEDoScriptHandler. This command executes a Tcl file when an
              AppleScript sends a “do script” command to Wish with a file path as a parameter.

       <b>::tk::mac::DoScriptText</b>
              The default Apple Event handler for AEDoScriptHandler. This command  executes  Tcl  code  when  an
              AppleScript sends a “do script” command to Wish with Tcl code or a Tcl procedure as a parameter.

       <b>::tk::mac::ShowPreferences</b>
              The   default   Apple   Event  handler  for  kAEShowPreferences,  “pref”.   The  application  menu
              “Preferences” menu item is only enabled when this proc is defined. Typically this command is  used
              to wrap a specific own preferences command, which pops up a preferences window. Something like:

                     proc ::tk::mac::ShowPreferences {} {
                         setPref
                     }

       <b>::tk::mac::OpenApplication</b>
              If  a proc of this name is defined, this proc fill fire when your application is initially opened.
              It is the default Apple Event handler for kAEOpenApplication, “oapp”.

       <b>::tk::mac::ReopenApplication</b>
              If a proc of this name is defined it is the default Apple Event handler for  kAEReopenApplication,
              “rapp”,  the  Apple Event sent when your application is opened when it is already running (e.g. by
              clicking its icon in the Dock). Here is a sample that raises a minimized window when the Dock icon
              is clicked:

                     proc ::tk::mac::ReopenApplication {} {
                         if {[wm state .] eq "withdrawn"} {
                             wm state . normal
                         } else {
                             wm deiconify .
                         }
                         raise .
                     }

       <b>::tk::mac::OpenDocument</b> <u>file...</u>
              If a proc of this name is defined it is the default  Apple  Event  handler  for  kAEOpenDocuments,
              “odoc”,  the  Apple Event sent when your application is asked to open one or more documents (e.g.,
              by drag &amp; drop onto the app or by opening a document of a type associated to the  app).  The  proc
              should take as arguments paths to the files to be opened, like so:

                     proc ::tk::mac::OpenDocument {args} {
                         foreach f $args {my_open_document $f}
                     }

       <b>::tk::mac::PrintDocument</b> <u>file...</u>
              If  a  proc  of  this name is defined it is the default Apple Event handler for kAEPrintDocuments,
              “pdoc”, the Apple Event sent when your application is asked to  print  a  document.   It  takes  a
              single absolute file path as an argument.

       <b>::tk::mac::Quit</b>
              If  a  proc  of this name is defined it is the default Apple Event handler for kAEQuitApplication,
              “quit”, the Apple Event sent when your application is asked to be quit, e.g.  via  the  quit  menu
              item   in   the   application   menu,   the  quit  menu  item  in  the  Dock  menu,  or  during  a
              logout/restart/shutdown etc. If this is not defined, <b>exit</b> is called instead.

       <b>::tk::mac::OnHide</b>
              If defined, this is called when your application receives a kEventAppHidden event,  e.g.  via  the
              hide menu item in the application or Dock menus.

       <b>::tk::mac::OnShow</b>
              If  defined,  this  is  called when your application receives a kEventAppShown event, e.g. via the
              show all menu item in the application menu, or by clicking the Dock icon of a hidden application.

       <b>::tk::mac::ShowHelp</b>
              Customizes behavior of Apple Help menu; if this procedure is not  defined,  the  platform-specific
              standard  Help menu item “YourApp Help” performs the default Cocoa action of showing the Help Book
              configured in the application's Info.plist (or displaying an alert if no Help Book is set).

       <b>::tk::mac::PerformService</b>
              Executes a Tcl procedure called from the macOS “Services” menu in the Application menu  item.  The
              “Services”  menu  item allows for inter-application communication; data from one application, such
              as selected text, can be sent to another application for processing, for example to  Safari  as  a
              search  item for Google, or to TextEdit to be appended to a file. An example of the proc is below,
              and should be rewritten in an application script for customization:

                     proc ::tk::mac::PerformService {} {
                         set data [clipboard get]
                         $w insert end $data
                     }
       Note that the mechanism for retrieving the data is from the clipboard; there is no other supported way to
       obtain the data.  If the Services process is not desired, the NSServices keys can  be  deleted  from  the
       application's  Info.plist  file.  The underlying code supporting this command also allows the text, entry
       and ttk::entry widgets to access services from other applications via the Services menu.  The  NSPortName
       key  in  Wish's  Info.plist file is currently set as “Wish” ; if a developer changes the name of the Wish
       executable to something
         else, this key should be modified with the same name.

       <b>::tk::mac::LaunchURL</b> <u>URL...</u>
              If defined, launches a URL within Tk. This would be used if a Tk application wants to handle a URL
              itself, such as displaying data from an RSS feed, rather than launching a default  application  to
              handle  the  URL,  although it can defined as such. Wish includes a stub URL scheme of “foo://” in
              the CFBundleURLSchemes key of its Info.plist file; this should be customized for the specific  URL
              scheme the developer wants to support.

       <b>::tk::mac::GetAppPath</b>
              Returns the current applications's file path.

</pre><h4><b>ADDITIONAL</b> <b>DIALOGS</b></h4><pre>
       Aqua/macOS defines additional dialogs that applications should support.

       <b>::tk::mac::standardAboutPanel</b>
              Brings the standard Cocoa about panel to the front with information filled in from the application
              bundle  files. The panel displays the application icon and the values associated to the info.plist
              keys    named    CFBundleName,    CFBundleShortVersionString,    NSAboutPanelOptionVersion     and
              NSHumanReadableCopyright.   If  a  file  named  <u>Credits.html</u> or <u>Credits.rtf</u> exists in the bundle's
              Resources directory then its contents will be displayed in a scrolling text box at the  bottom  of
              the  dialog.  See  the documentation for -[NSApplication orderFrontStandardAboutPanelWithOptions:]
              for more details. A hook is also provided for  a  custom  About  dialog.   If  a  Tcl  proc  named
              tkAboutDialog  is  defined  in  the main interpreter then that procedure will be called instead of
              opening the standardAboutPanel.

</pre><h4><b>SYSTEM</b> <b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       There are a number of additional global configuration options that control the details of how Tk  renders
       by default.

       <b>::tk::mac::useCompatibilityMetrics</b> <u>boolean</u>
              Preserves compatibility with older Tk/Aqua metrics; set to <b>false</b> for more native spacing.

       <b>::tk::mac::CGAntialiasLimit</b> <u>limit</u>
              Sets the antialiasing limit; lines thinner that <u>limit</u> pixels will not be antialiased. Integer, set
              to 0 by default, making all lines be antialiased.

       <b>::tk::mac::antialiasedtext</b> <u>number</u>
              Sets  anti-aliased  text.  Controls text antialiasing, possible values for <u>number</u> are -1 (default,
              use system default for text AA), 0 (no text AA), 1 (use text AA).

       <b>::tk::mac::useThemedToplevel</b> <u>boolean</u>
              Sets toplevel windows to draw with the modern grayish/ pinstripe  Mac  background.  Equivalent  to
              configuring   the   toplevel  with  “<b>-background</b>  <b>systemWindowHeaderBackground</b>”,  or  to  using  a
              <b>ttk::frame</b>.

</pre><h4><b>SUPPORT</b> <b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>::tk::mac::iconBitmap</b> <u>name</u> <u>width</u> <u>height</u> <u>-kind</u> <u>value</u>
              Renders native icons and bitmaps  in  Tk  applications  (including  any  image  file  readable  by
              NSImage). A native bitmap name is interpreted as follows (in order):

              •  predefined builtin 32x32 icon name (<b>stop</b>, <b>caution</b>, <b>document</b>, etc.)

              •  <u>name</u>, as defined by <b>tk::mac::iconBitmap</b>

              •  NSImage named image name

              •  NSImage url string

              •  4-char OSType of IconServices icon

              The  <u>width</u>  and  <u>height</u>  arguments  to  <b>tk::mac::iconBitmap</b>  define the dimensions of the image to
              create, and <u>-kind</u> must be one of:

              <b>-file</b>  icon of file at given path

              <b>-fileType</b>
                     icon of given file type

              <b>-osType</b>
                     icon of given 4-char OSType file type

              <b>-systemType</b>
                     icon for given IconServices 4-char OSType

              <b>-namedImage</b>
                     named NSImage for given name

              <b>-imageFile</b>
                     image at given path
