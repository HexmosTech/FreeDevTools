</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Net::IRC::Event - A class for passing event data between subroutines

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       None yet. These docs are under construction.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This documentation is a subset of the main Net::IRC documentation. If you haven't already, please
       "perldoc Net::IRC" before continuing.

       Net::IRC::Event defines a standard interface to the salient information for just about any event your
       client may witness on IRC. It's about as close as we can get in Perl to a struct, with a few extra nifty
       features thrown in.

</pre><h4><b>METHOD</b> <b>DESCRIPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       This section is under construction, but hopefully will be finally written up by the next release. Please
       see the "irctest" script and the source for details about this module.

</pre><h4><b>LIST</b> <b>OF</b> <b>EVENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Net::IRC is an entirely event-based system, which takes some getting used to at first. To interact with
       the IRC server, you tell Net::IRC's server connection to listen for certain events and activate your own
       subroutines when they occur. Problem is, this doesn't help you much if you don't know what to tell it to
       look for. Below is a list of the possible events you can pass to Net::IRC, along with brief descriptions
       of each... hope this helps.

   <b>Common</b> <b>events</b>
       •   nick

           The  "nick"  event  is  triggered  when the client receives a NICK message, meaning that someone on a
           channel with the client has changed eir nickname.

       •   quit

           The "quit" event is triggered upon receipt of a QUIT message, which means that someone on  a  channel
           with the client has disconnected.

       •   join

           The  "join" event is triggered upon receipt of a JOIN message, which means that someone has entered a
           channel that the client is on.

       •   part

           The "part" event is triggered upon receipt of a PART message, which means that  someone  has  left  a
           channel that the client is on.

       •   mode

           The  "mode"  event is triggered upon receipt of a MODE message, which means that someone on a channel
           with the client has changed the channel's parameters.

       •   topic

           The "topic" event is triggered upon receipt of a TOPIC message, which means that someone on a channel
           with the client has changed the channel's topic.

       •   kick

           The "kick" event is triggered upon receipt of a KICK message, which means that someone on  a  channel
           with the client (or possibly the client itself!) has been forcibly ejected.

       •   public

           The  "public"  event is triggered upon receipt of a PRIVMSG message to an entire channel, which means
           that someone on a channel with the client has said something aloud.

       •   msg

           The "msg" event is triggered upon receipt of a PRIVMSG message which is  addressed  to  one  or  more
           clients, which means that someone is sending the client a private message. (Duh. :-)

       •   notice

           The  "notice"  event is triggered upon receipt of a NOTICE message, which means that someone has sent
           the client a public or private notice. (Is that sufficiently vague?)

       •   ping

           The "ping" event is triggered upon receipt of a PING message, which means  that  the  IRC  server  is
           querying the client to see if it's alive. Don't confuse this with CTCP PINGs, explained later.

       •   other

           The  "other"  event is triggered upon receipt of any number of unclassifiable miscellaneous messages,
           but you're not likely to see it often.

       •   invite

           The "invite" event is triggered upon receipt of an  INVITE  message,  which  means  that  someone  is
           permitting the client's entry into a +i channel.

       •   kill

           The  "kill"  event  is triggered upon receipt of a KILL message, which means that an IRC operator has
           just booted your sorry arse offline. Seeya!

       •   disconnect

           The "disconnect" event is triggered when the client loses its  connection  to  the  IRC  server  it's
           talking to. Don't confuse it with the "leaving" event. (See below.)

       •   leaving

           The  "leaving"  event  is triggered just before the client deliberately closes a connection to an IRC
           server, in case you want to do anything special before you sign off.

       •   umode

           The "umode" event is triggered when the client changes its personal mode flags.

       •   error

           The "error" event is triggered when the IRC server complains to you about anything. Sort of the  evil
           twin to the "other" event, actually.

   <b>CTCP</b> <b>Requests</b>
       •   cping

           The  "cping"  event  is triggered when the client receives a CTCP PING request from another user. See
           the irctest script for an example of how to properly respond to this common request.

       •   cversion

           The "cversion" event is triggered when the client  receives  a  CTCP  VERSION  request  from  another
           client, asking for version info about its IRC client program.

       •   csource

           The  "csource" event is triggered when the client receives a CTCP SOURCE request from another client,
           asking where it can find the source to its IRC client program.

       •   ctime

           The "ctime" event is triggered when the client receives a CTCP  TIME  request  from  another  client,
           asking for the local time at its end.

       •   cdcc

           The "cdcc" event is triggered when the client receives a DCC request of any sort from another client,
           attempting to establish a DCC connection.

       •   cuserinfo

           The  "cuserinfo"  event  is  triggered  when the client receives a CTCP USERINFO request from another
           client, asking for personal information from the client's user.

       •   cclientinfo

           The "cclientinfo" event is triggered when the client receives a CTCP CLIENTINFO request from  another
           client, asking for whatever the hell "clientinfo" means.

       •   cerrmsg

           The  "cerrmsg" event is triggered when the client receives a CTCP ERRMSG request from another client,
           notifying it of a protocol error in a preceding CTCP communication.

       •   cfinger

           The "cfinger" event is triggered when the client receives a CTCP FINGER request from another  client.
           How to respond to this should best be left up to your own moral stance.

       •   caction

           The  "caction" event is triggered when the client receives a CTCP ACTION message from another client.
           I should hope you're getting the hang of how Net::IRC handles CTCP requests by now...

   <b>CTCP</b> <b>Responses</b>
       •   crping

           The "crping" event is triggered when the client receives a CTCP PING response from another user.  See
           the irctest script for an example of how to properly respond to this common event.

       •   crversion

           The  "crversion"  event  is  triggered  when the client receives a CTCP VERSION response from another
           client.

       •   crsource

           The "crsource" event is triggered when the client  receives  a  CTCP  SOURCE  response  from  another
           client.

       •   crtime

           The "crtime" event is triggered when the client receives a CTCP TIME response from another client.

       •   cruserinfo

           The  "cruserinfo"  event  is triggered when the client receives a CTCP USERINFO response from another
           client.

       •   crclientinfo

           The "crclientinfo" event is triggered when the  client  receives  a  CTCP  CLIENTINFO  response  from
           another client.

       •   crfinger

           The  "crfinger"  event  is  triggered  when  the  client receives a CTCP FINGER response from another
           client. I'm not even going to consider making a joke about this one.

   <b>DCC</b> <b>Events</b>
       •   dcc_open

           The "dcc_open" event is triggered when a DCC connection is established between the client and another
           client.

       •   dcc_update

           The "dcc_update" event is triggered when any data flows over a  DCC  connection.   Useful  for  doing
           things like monitoring file transfer progress, for instance.

       •   dcc_close

           The  "dcc_close"  event  is  triggered  when  a  DCC connection closes, whether from an error or from
           natural causes.

       •   chat

           The "chat" event is triggered when the person on the other end of a DCC CHAT connection sends  you  a
           message. Think of it as the private equivalent of "msg", if you will.

   <b>Numeric</b> <b>Events</b>
       •   There's  a  whole lot of them, and they're well-described elsewhere. Please see the IRC RFC (1495, at
           <a href="http://cs-ftp.bu.edu/pub/irc/support/IRC_RFC">http://cs-ftp.bu.edu/pub/irc/support/IRC_RFC</a> ) for a detailed description, or the  Net::IRC::Event.pm
           source code for a quick list.
