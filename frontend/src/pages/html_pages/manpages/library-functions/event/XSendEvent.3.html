</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       XSendEvent,  XDisplayMotionBufferSize,  XGetMotionEvents,  XTimeCoord  -  send  events and pointer motion
       history structure

</pre><h4><b>SYNTAX</b></h4><pre>

       Status XSendEvent(Display *<u>display</u>, Window <u>w</u>, Bool <u>propagate</u>, long <u>event_mask</u>, XEvent *<u>event_send</u>);

       unsigned long XDisplayMotionBufferSize(Display *<u>display</u>);

       XTimeCoord *XGetMotionEvents(Display *<u>display</u>, Window <u>w</u>, Time <u>start</u>, Time <u>stop</u>, int *<u>nevents_return</u>);

</pre><h4><b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>display</u>   Specifies the connection to the X server.

       <u>event_mask</u>
                 Specifies the event mask.

       <u>event_send</u>
                 Specifies the event that is to be sent.

       <u>nevents_return</u>
                 Returns the number of events from the motion history buffer.

       <u>propagate</u> Specifies a Boolean value.

       <u>start</u>
       <u>stop</u>      Specify the time interval in which the events are returned from the motion history buffer.  You
                 can pass a timestamp or <b>CurrentTime</b>.  <b>PointerWindow</b>, or <b>InputFocus</b>.

       <u>w</u>         Specifies the window the window the event is to be sent to.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>XSendEvent</b> function identifies the destination window, determines which clients  should  receive  the
       specified events, and ignores any active grabs.  This function requires you to pass an event mask.  For a
       discussion  of  the  valid  event  mask  names,  see  section 10.3.  This function uses the w argument to
       identify the destination window as follows:

       •    If w is <b>PointerWindow</b>, the destination window is the window that contains the pointer.

       •    If w is <b>InputFocus</b> and if the focus window contains the  pointer,  the  destination  window  is  the
            window that contains the pointer; otherwise, the destination window is the focus window.

       To determine which clients should receive the specified events, <b>XSendEvent</b> uses the propagate argument as
       follows:

       •    If event_mask is the empty set, the event is sent to the client that created the destination window.
            If that client no longer exists, no event is sent.

       •    If  propagate  is <b>False</b>, the event is sent to every client selecting on destination any of the event
            types in the event_mask argument.

       •    If propagate is <b>True</b> and no clients have selected on destination any of the event  types  in  event-
            mask, the destination is replaced with the closest ancestor of destination for which some client has
            selected  a  type  in  event-mask  and  for which no intervening window has that type in its do-not-
            propagate-mask.  If no such window exists or if the window is an ancestor of the  focus  window  and
            <b>InputFocus</b>  was  originally  specified  as  the  destination,  the event is not sent to any clients.
            Otherwise, the event is reported to every client selecting on the final destination any of the types
            specified in event_mask.

       The event in the <b>XEvent</b> structure must be one of the core events or one  of  the  events  defined  by  an
       extension  (or  a  <b>BadValue</b>  error  results) so that the X server can correctly byte-swap the contents as
       necessary.  The contents of the event are otherwise unaltered and unchecked by the  X  server  except  to
       force  send_event  to  <b>True</b>  in  the forwarded event and to set the serial number in the event correctly;
       therefore these fields and the display field are ignored by <b>XSendEvent</b>.

       <b>XSendEvent</b> returns zero if the conversion to wire protocol format failed and returns  nonzero  otherwise.
       <b>XSendEvent</b> can generate <b>BadValue</b> and <b>BadWindow</b> errors.

       The  server  may retain the recent history of the pointer motion and do so to a finer granularity than is
       reported by <b>MotionNotify</b> events.  The <b>XGetMotionEvents</b> function makes this history available.

       The <b>XGetMotionEvents</b> function returns all events in the motion  history  buffer  that  fall  between  the
       specified start and stop times, inclusive, and that have coordinates that lie within the specified window
       (including  its borders) at its present placement.  If the server does not support motion history, if the
       start time is later than the stop time, or if the start time is in the future, no  events  are  returned;
       <b>XGetMotionEvents</b>  returns  NULL.   If  the  stop  time  is  in the future, it is equivalent to specifying
       <b>CurrentTime</b>.  <b>XGetMotionEvents</b> can generate a <b>BadWindow</b> error.

</pre><h4><b>STRUCTURES</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>XTimeCoord</b> structure contains:

       typedef struct {
               Time time;
               short x, y;
       } XTimeCoord;

       The time member is set to the time, in milliseconds.  The x and y members are set to the  coordinates  of
       the pointer and are reported relative to the origin of the specified window.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>BadValue</b>  Some  numeric  value  falls  outside  the  range  of  values accepted by the request.  Unless a
                 specific range is specified for an argument, the full range defined by the argument's  type  is
                 accepted.  Any argument defined as a set of alternatives can generate this error.

       <b>BadWindow</b> A value for a Window argument does not name a defined Window.
