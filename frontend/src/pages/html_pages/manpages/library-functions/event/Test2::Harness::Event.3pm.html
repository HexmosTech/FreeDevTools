</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Test2::Harness::Event - Subclass of Test2::Event used by Test2::Harness under the hood.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Test2 tests produce a sequence of events objects Test2::Event. This is a subclass of those events for use
       in Test2::Harness. Event non-test tests which produce TAP output will have the output parsed into these
       types of events.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       In normal usage ou will never need to create one fo these events yourself. This documentation assumes you
       are operating on an existing event $event that the harness exposed to you via a plugin or similar.

           my $facet_data = $event-&gt;facet_data;
           my $run_id     = $event-&gt;run_id;
           my $job_id     = $event-&gt;job_id;
           my $job_try    = $event-&gt;job_try;
           my $event_id   = $event-&gt;event_id;

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       See Test2::Event for methods provided by the base class.

       $hashref = $event-&gt;TO_JSON
           Used for json serialization.

       $json_string = $event-&gt;as_json
           This  will  return a json representation of the event. Note that this is a lossy conversion with some
           harness specific state removed by design. This may even be a cached copy of the json string that  was
           decoded to produce the original object. If the string was not cached before it will be cached for all
           future calls ignoring any state change to the event.

           The  lossy/cached  conversion  is  intended  so  that  events get passed through the harness pipeline
           without modifications from one step translating to another. If you need something extra to go through
           you need to either replace the event or create an additional one.

       $string = $event-&gt;event_id
           Usually a UUID, but not always!

       i$hashref = $event-&gt;facet_data
           Get the event facet data, this is the meat of the event that hold all the state.

       $string = $event-&gt;job_id
           Usually a UUID, but not always!

       $int = $event-&gt;job_try
           Integer, 0 or greater. Some jobs are run additional times if they fail, this says which  attempt  the
           event is for. The counter starts at 0.

       $bool = $event-&gt;processed
           This  will  be  true  if  the  event  has been process by the harness. Note that this attibute is not
           serialized by "TO_JSON" or "as_json".

       $string = $event-&gt;run_id
           The run id. This is usually a UUID, but not always!

       $ts = $event-&gt;stamp
           A unix timestamp for when the event was created.

       $id = $event-&gt;stream_id
           This is an implementation detail of Test2::Formatter::Stream, do not rely on  it.  This  is  used  to
           prevent  parsing  errors when stream output is nested in other stream output, which can happen if you
           are writing tests for the stream formatter itself.

       $trace = $event-&gt;trace
           This si  a  shortcut  for  "$event-&gt;facet_data-&gt;{trace}".  The  trace  data  is  essential  and  used
           everywhere.
