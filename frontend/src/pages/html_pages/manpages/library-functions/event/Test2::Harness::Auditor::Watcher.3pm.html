</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Test2::Harness::Auditor::Watcher - Class to monitor events for a single job and pass judgement on the
       result.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module represents a per-job state tracker. This module sees every event and manages the state
       produced. In the end this tracker determines if a test job passed or failed, and why.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Test2::Harness::Auditor::Watcher;

           my $watcher = Test2::Harness::Auditor::Watcher-&gt;new();

           for my $event (@events) {
               $watcher-&gt;process($event);
           }

           print "Pass!" if $watcher-&gt;pass;
           print "Fail!" if $watcher-&gt;fail;

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       $int = $watcher-&gt;<b>assertion_count()</b>
           Number of assertions that have been seen.

       $exit = $watcher-&gt;<b>exit()</b>
           If  the  job  has exited this will return the exit value (integer, 0 or greater).  If the job has not
           exited yet (or at least if the watcher has not seen the exit event yet) this will return undef.

       $bool = $watcher-&gt;<b>fail()</b>
           Returns true if the job has failed/is failing.

       @error_facets = $watcher-&gt;fail_error_facet_list
           Used internally to get a list of 'error' facets to inject into the harness_job_exit event.

       $file = $watcher-&gt;file
           If the test file is known this will return it (string). This will return undef if the file is not yet
           known.

       $string = $watcher-&gt;halt
           If the test was halted (bail-out) this will contain the human readible reason.

       $bool = $watcher-&gt;has_exit
           Check if the exit value is known.

       $bool = $watcher-&gt;has_plan
           Check if a plan has been seen.

       $job = $watcher-&gt;job
           If the job is known this will return the detailed structure of the job.

       $int = $watcher-&gt;nested
           If this watcher represents a subtest this will be an integer greater than 0, the top-level test is 0.

       $hash = $watcher-&gt;numbers
           This is an internal state tracking what test numbers have been seen. This is really  only  applicable
           in tests that produced TAP.

       $bool = $watcher-&gt;pass
           Check if the test job is passing.

       $plan_facet = $watcher-&gt;<b>plan()</b>
           If the plan facet has been seen this will return it.

       $watcher-&gt;process($event);
           Modify the state based on the provided event.

       $watcher-&gt;subtest_fail_error_facet_list
           Used internally to get a list of 'error' facets to inject into the harness_job_exit event.

       $times = $watcher-&gt;<b>times()</b>
           Retuns the Test2::Harness::Auditor::TimeTracker instance.

       $int = $watcher-&gt;<b>try()</b>
           Sometimes  a  job  is  run  more  than  once,  in  those cases this will be an integer greater than 0
           representing the try. 0 is used for the first try.
