       pfm_get_os_event_encoding - get event encoding for a specific operating system

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;perfmon/pfmlib.h&gt;</b>

       <b>int</b> <b>pfm_get_os_event_encoding(const</b> <b>char</b> <b>*</b><u>str</u><b>,</b> <b>int</b> <u>dfl_plm</u><b>,</b> <b>pfm_os_t</b> <u>os</u><b>,</b>  <b>void</b> <b>*</b><u>arg</u><b>);</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  is the key function to retrieve the encoding of an event for a specific operating system interface.
       The event string passed in <b>str</b> is parsed and encoded for the operating system specified by <b>os</b>.  Only  one
       event  per  call  can  be  encoded.  As  such, <b>str</b> can contain only one symbolic event name. The event is
       encoded to monitor at the privilege levels specified by the <b>dfl_plm</b> mask, if  supported,  otherwise  this
       parameter is ignored. The operating system specific input and output arguments are passed in <b>arg</b>.

       The  event  string, <b>str</b>, may contains sub-event masks (umask) and any other supported modifiers. Only one
       event is parsed from the string. For convenience, it is possible to pass a comma-separated list of events
       in <b>str</b> but only the first event is encoded.

       The following values are supported for <b>os</b>:

       <b>PFM_OS_NONE</b>
              This value causes the event to be encoded purely  as  specified  by  the  PMU  hardware.  The  <b>arg</b>
              argument must be a pointer to a <b>pfm_pmu_encode_arg_t</b> structure which is defined as follows:

              typedef struct {
                  uint64_t    *codes;
                  char        **fstr;
                  size_t      size;
                  int         count;
                  int         idx;
              } pfm_pmu_encode_arg_t;

              The fields are defined as follows:

              <b>codes</b>  A  pointer  to  an  array  of  64-bit  values. On input, if <b>codes</b> is NULL, then the library
                     allocates whatever is necessary to store the encoding of the event. If <b>codes</b> is not NULL on
                     input, then <b>count</b> must reflect its actual number of elements. If <b>count</b> is big  enough,  the
                     library stores the encoding at the address provided.  Otherwise, an error is returned.

              <b>count</b>  On  input,  the  field  contains  the  maximum  number of elements in the array <b>codes</b>. Upon
                     return, it contains the number of actual entries in <b>codes</b>. If <b>codes</b>  is  NULL,  then  count
                     must be zero.

              <b>fstr</b>   If  the  caller is interested in retrieving the fully qualified event string where all used
                     unit masks and all modifiers are spelled out, this field must be set to a non-null  address
                     of  a  pointer  to  a string (char **).  Upon return, if <b>fstr</b> was not NULL, then the string
                     pointer passed on entry points to the event string. The string is dynamically allocated and
                     <b>must</b> eventually be freed by the caller. If <b>fstr</b> was NULL on entry, then nothing is returned
                     in this field. The typical calling sequence looks as follows:
                        char *fstr = NULL
                        pfm_pmu_encode_arg_t arg;
                        arg.fstr = &amp;fstr;
                        ret = pfm_get_os_event_encoding("event",
                                                        PFM_PLM0|PFM_PLM3,
                                                        PFM_OS_NONE,
                                                        &amp;e);
                        if (ret == PFM_SUCCESS) {
                           printf("fstr=%s\n", fstr);
                           free(fstr);
                        }

              <b>size</b>   This field contains the size of the struct passed.  This  field  is  used  to  provide  for
                     extensibility  of the struct without compromising backward compatibility.  The value should
                     be set to <b>sizeof(pfm_pmu_encode_arg_t)</b>. If instead, a value of <b>0</b> is specified, the  library
                     assumes   the  struct  passed  is  identical  to  the  first  ABI  version  which  size  is
                     <b>PFM_RAW_ENCODE_ABI0</b>. Thus, if fields were added after the first ABI, they will not  be  set
                     by the library. The library does check that bytes beyond what is implemented are zeroes.

              <b>idx</b>    Upon  return,  this  field contains the opaque unique identifier for the event described in
                     <b>str</b>.   This  index  can  be  used  to  retrieve   information   about   the   event   using
                     <b>pfm_get_event_info()</b>, for instance.

       <b>PFM_OS_PERF_EVENT,</b> <b>PFM_OS_PERF_EVENT_EXT</b>
              This  value  causes  the  event to be encoded for the perf_event Linux kernel interface (available
              since  2.6.31).   The  <b>arg</b>  must  be  a  pointer  to  a   <b>pfm_perf_encode_arg_t</b>   structure.   The
              PFM_OS_PERF_EVENT  layer  provides  the modifiers exported by the underlying PMU hardware, some of
              which may actually be overridden by the perf_event interface, such  as  the  monitoring  privilege
              levels.  The  <b>PFM_OS_PERF_EVENT_EXT</b>  extends <b>PFM_OS_PERF_EVENT</b> to add modifiers controlled only by
              the perf_event interface, such  as  sampling  period  (<b>period</b>),  frequency  (<b>freq</b>)  and  exclusive
              resource access (<b>excl</b>).

              typedef struct {
                  struct perf_event_attr *attr;
                  char **fstr;
                  size_t size;
                  int idx;
                  int cpu;
                  int flags;
              } pfm_perf_encode_arg_t;
              The fields are defined as follows:

              <b>attr</b>   A pointer to a struct perf_event_attr as defined in perf_event.h. This field cannot be NULL
                     on  entry.  The struct is not completely overwritten by the call. The library only modifies
                     the fields it knows about, thereby allowing perf_event  ABI  mismatch  between  caller  and
                     library.

              <b>fstr</b>   Same behavior as is described for PFM_OS_NONE above.

              <b>size</b>   This  field  contains  the  size  of  the  struct passed. This field is used to provide for
                     extensibility of the struct without compromising backward compatibility.  The value  should
                     be set to <b>sizeof(pfm_perf_encode_arg_t)</b>. If instead, a value of <b>0</b> is specified, the library
                     assumes   the  struct  passed  is  identical  to  the  first  ABI  version  which  size  is
                     <b>PFM_PERF_ENCODE_ABI0</b>. Thus, if fields were added after the first ABI, they will not be  set
                     by the library. The library does check that bytes beyond what is implemented are zeroes.

              <b>idx</b>    Upon  return,  this  field contains the opaque unique identifier for the event described in
                     <b>str</b>.   This  index  can  be  used  to  retrieve   information   about   the   event   using
                     <b>pfm_get_event_info()</b>, for instance.

              <b>cpu</b>    Not used yet.

              <b>flags</b>  Not used yet.

       Here is a example of how this function could be used with PFM_OS_NONE:
       #include &lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/inttypes.h">inttypes.h</a>&gt;
       #include &lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/err.h">err.h</a>&gt;
       #include &lt;perfmon/pfmlib.h&gt;
       int main(int argc, char **argv)
       {
          pfm_pmu_encode_arg_t arg;
          int i, ret;

          ret = pfm_initialize();
          if (ret != PFM_SUCCESS)
             errx(1, "cannot initialize library %s", pfm_strerror(ret));

          memset(&amp;arg, 0, sizeof(arg));

          ret = pfm_get_os_event_encoding("RETIRED_INSTRUCTIONS", PFM_PLM3, PFM_OS_NONE, &amp;arg);
          if (ret != PFM_SUCCESS)
             err(1, "cannot get encoding %s", pfm_strerror(ret));

          for(i = 0; i &lt; arg.count; i++)
             printf("count[%d]=0x%"PRIx64"\n", i, arg.codes[i]);

          free(arg.codes);
          return 0;
       }

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b></h4><pre>
       The function returns in <b>arg</b> the encoding of the event for the os passed in <b>os</b>. The content of <b>arg</b> depends
       on the <b>os</b> argument. Upon success, <b>PFM_SUCCESS</b> is returned otherwise a specific error code is returned.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>PFM_ERR_TOOSMALL</b>
              The <b>code</b> argument is too small for the encoding.

       <b>PFM_ERR_INVAL</b>
              The <b>code</b> or <b>count</b> argument is <b>NULL</b> or the <b>str</b> contains more than one symbolic event.

       <b>PFM_ERR_NOMEM</b>
              Not enough memory.

       <b>PFM_ERR_NOTFOUND</b>
              Event not found.

       <b>PFM_ERR_ATTR</b>
              Invalid event attribute (unit mask or modifier)

       <b>PFM_ERR_ATTR_VAL</b>
              Invalid modifier value.

       <b>PFM_ERR_ATTR_SET</b>
              attribute already set, cannot be changed.

       <b>PFM_ERR_ATTR_UMASK</b>
              Missing unit mask.

       <b>PFM_ERR_ATTR_FEATCOMB</b>
              Unit masks or features cannot be combined into a single event.
