       Tk_RestrictEvents - filter and selectively delay X events

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;tk.h&gt;</b>

       Tk_RestrictProc *
       <b>Tk_RestrictEvents</b>(<u>proc,</u> <u>arg,</u> <u>prevArgPtr</u>)

</pre><h4><b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Tk_RestrictProc <u>*proc</u> (in)                 Predicate procedure to call to filter incoming X events.  NULL
                                                  means do not restrict events at all.

       void <u>*arg</u> (in)                             Arbitrary argument to pass to <u>proc</u>.

       void <u>**prevArgPtr</u> (out)                    Pointer  to  place  to  save  argument  to  previous  restrict
                                                  procedure.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This procedure is useful in certain situations where applications are only prepared to receive certain  X
       events.   After  <b>Tk_RestrictEvents</b>  is called, <b>Tcl_DoOneEvent</b> (and hence <b>Tk_MainLoop</b>) will filter X input
       events through <u>proc</u>.  <u>Proc</u> indicates whether a given event is to be processed immediately, deferred until
       some later time (e.g. when the event restriction is lifted), or discarded.   <u>Proc</u>  is  a  procedure  with
       arguments and result that match the type <b>Tk_RestrictProc</b>:
              typedef Tk_RestrictAction <b>Tk_RestrictProc</b>(
                      void *<u>arg</u>,
                      XEvent *<u>eventPtr</u>);
       The  <u>arg</u>  argument  is a copy of the <u>arg</u> passed to <b>Tk_RestrictEvents</b>; it may be used to provide <u>proc</u> with
       information it needs to filter events.  The <u>eventPtr</u>  points  to  an  event  under  consideration.   <u>Proc</u>
       returns  a  restrict action (enumerated type <b>Tk_RestrictAction</b>) that indicates what <b>Tcl_DoOneEvent</b> should
       do with the event.  If the return value is <b>TK_PROCESS_EVENT</b>, then the event will be handled  immediately.
       If  the  return  value  is  <b>TK_DEFER_EVENT</b>,  then  the  event  will  be left on the event queue for later
       processing.  If the return value is <b>TK_DISCARD_EVENT</b>, then the event will be removed from the event queue
       and discarded without being processed.

       <b>Tk_RestrictEvents</b> uses its return value and <u>prevArgPtr</u> to return  information  about  the  current  event
       restriction  procedure (a NULL return value means there are currently no restrictions).  These values may
       be used to restore the previous restriction state when there is  no  longer  any  need  for  the  current
       restriction.

       There  are  very  few  places where <b>Tk_RestrictEvents</b> is needed.  In most cases, the best way to restrict
       events is by changing the bindings with the <b>bind</b> Tcl command  or  by  calling  <b>Tk_CreateEventHandler</b>  and
       <b>Tk_DeleteEventHandler</b>  from  C.   The  main place where <b>Tk_RestrictEvents</b> must be used is when performing
       synchronous actions (for example, if you need to wait for a particular event to  occur  on  a  particular
       window but you do not want to invoke any handlers for any other events).  The “obvious” solution in these
       situations  is  to  call <b>XNextEvent</b> or <b>XWindowEvent</b>, but these procedures cannot be used because Tk keeps
       its own event queue that is separate from the X event queue.  Instead, call <b>Tk_RestrictEvents</b> to set up a
       filter, then call <b>Tcl_DoOneEvent</b> to retrieve the desired event(s).
