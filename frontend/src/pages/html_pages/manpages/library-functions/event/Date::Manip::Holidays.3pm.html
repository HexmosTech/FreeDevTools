</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Date::Manip::Holidays - describes holidays and events

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       This describes the Holidays and Events sections of the config file, and how they are used.

       Holidays and events are specific days that are named. Holidays are used in business mode calculations,
       events are not. Events may be used for other calendaring operations.

</pre><h4><b>HOLIDAYS</b></h4><pre>
       The holiday section of the config file is used to define holidays.  Each line is of the form:

          STRING = HOLIDAY

       HOLIDAY is the name of the holiday or it can be blank.

       If HOLIDAY is blank, the holiday is unnamed, but still treated as a holiday.  For example, in the US, the
       day after Thanksgiving is often a work holiday though it is not named.

       HOLIDAY should be unique in most cases.  The only exception is if the holiday definition is complex
       enough that it is impossible to describe it with one STRING.  In this case, multiple lines may be given
       with different values of STRING but the same value for HOLIDAY, and in these cases, the first STRING that
       matches a given year will be used.  This situation is described in more detail below.

       NOTE: It is not allowed to have unnamed holidays that require multiple definitions, so a name will have
       to be assigned in that case.

       STRING is a string which can be parsed to give a valid date. It can be any of the following forms:

       <b>A</b> <b>full</b> <b>date</b>
           Specific holidays can be set which occur only a single time.

              May 5, 2000                     = A one-time-only holiday

           Any format parseable by "Date::Manip::Date::parse_date" can be used.

           There  is  one  caveat to using a full date.  Date::Manip assumes that most holidays will appear once
           per year, so if you were to explicitly defined New Years (observed) as:

              2004-12-31                      = New Year's Day

           then it would assume that it had found the occurrence of New Year's for 2004 when in  fact,  this  is
           the 2005 occurrence.

           Full  date  specifications  should  only  be  used  as  a  last resort, and probably only if you will
           explicitly specify all occurrence of the holiday.

       <b>A</b> <b>date</b> <b>without</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b>
           Some holidays occur every year on the same day. These can be defined using the simple lines:

              Jan 1                           = New Year's Day
              Jul 4th                         = Independence Day
              fourth Thu in Nov               = Thanksgiving

           These dates must be written in a form which can be parsed as a full date by simply adding the year to
           the end of the string. Please refer to the Date::Manip::Date documentation to  see  what  forms  will
           work. ISO 8601 dates will not work since the year comes first.

           Any format parseable by "Date::Manip::Date::parse_date" which allows the year to be at the end can be
           used.

       <b>Recurrence</b>
           The dates can be specified using recurrences:

              1*0:0:0:0:0:0*EASTER            = Easter
              1*11:0:11:0:0:0*DWD             = Veteran's Day
              1*11:4:4:0:0:0                  = Thanksgiving
              1*11:4:4:0:0:0*FD1              = Day after Thanksgiving

           In  cases where you are interested in business type calculations, you'll want to define most holidays
           using recurrences, since they can define when a holiday is celebrated in the  financial  world.   For
           example, Christmas might be defined as:

              Dec 25               = Christmas

           but  if  it  falls  on  a  weekend, there won't be a business holiday associated with it. It could be
           defined using a recurrence:

              1*12:0:24:0:0:0*DWD  = Christmas

           so that if Christmas falls on a weekend, a holiday will be taken on the Friday before or  the  Monday
           after the weekend.

           You can use the fully specified format of a recurrence:

             1*2:0:1:0:0:0***Jan 1 1999*Dec 31 2002 = Feb 2 from 1999-2002

</pre><h4><b>OTHER</b> <b>HOLIDAY</b> <b>CONSIDERATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Recurrences</b> <b>which</b> <b>change</b> <b>years</b>
           It  is  now  valid  to  have  a recurrence defined for New Year's day which pushes the holiday to the
           previous year.

           For example, the most useful definition of New Year's day is:

              1*1:0:1:0:0:0*DWD               = New Year's Day

           which means to choose the closest working day to observe the holiday, even  though  this  might  mean
           that the holiday is observed on the previous year.

       <b>Order</b> <b>of</b> <b>definitions</b> <b>is</b> <b>preserved</b>
           The  order  of the definitions is preserved. In other words, when looking at the holidays for a year,
           previously defined holidays (in the order given in the config file) are correctly handled.

           As an example, if you wanted to define both Christmas and  Boxing  days  (Boxing  is  the  day  after
           Christmas,  and is celebrated in some parts of the world), and you wanted to celebrate Christmas on a
           business day on or after Dec 25, and Boxing day as the following work day, you could do it in one  of
           the following ways:

              1*12:0:25:0:0:0*NWD  = Christmas
              1*12:0:26:0:0:0*NWD  = Boxing

           or

              1*12:0:25:0:0:0*NWD  = Christmas
              1*12:0:25:0:0:0*NWD  = Boxing

           Holidays  go into affect the minute they are parsed which is why the second example works (though for
           clarity, the first one is preferable).  The first recurrence defined the first  business  day  on  or
           after  Dec  25  as Christmas.  The second one then defines the business day after that as Boxing day.
           Since the definitions are stored as a list (NOT a hash as they were in Date::Manip 5.xx),  using  the
           same recurrence twice does not cause a problem.

       <b>Multiple</b> <b>holidays</b>
           Having multiple holidays on a single day is allowed. As an example, you may want to look at New Years
           day as both the observed and actual holidays, so you might have:

              1*1:0:1:0:0:0*DWD               = New Year's Day (observed)
              Jan 1                           = New Year's Day

           Most of the time, both will fall on the same day, but sometimes they may differ.  In this example, it
           is important that the observed holiday be listed first.  Otherwise, Jan 1 will be marked as a holiday
           and  then  the  observed  date  will check Jan 1, but where it is not a business day, it will move to
           another day (due to the DWD modifier).

           Likewise, the two holidays:

              3rd Sunday in June              = Father's Day
              Jun 17                          = Bunker Hill Day

           sometimes fall on  the  same  day.   Using  the  "Date::Manip::Date::list_holidays"  method  (or  the
           "Date_IsHoliday" function), you can get a list of all names that the date contains.

       <b>Complex</b> <b>holiday</b> <b>descriptions</b>
           Occasionally, you cannot describe a holiday using a single line.  For example, the US Federal Reserve
           banks use a complex holiday description where:

              For holidays falling on Saturday, Federal Reserve Banks
              and Branches will be open the preceding Friday. For holidays
              falling on Sunday, all Federal Reserve Banks and Branches
              will be closed the following Monday.

           Since  Saturday  is  not  a business day, the DWD modifier will not work.  For these, you need a more
           complicated definition.

           The following definitions both work:

              # Saturday
              1*1:0:1:0:0:0*NBD,BD1,IBD,FD1   = New Year's Day
              # Sunday (observed Monday)
              1*1:0:1:0:0:0*NBD,BD1,NBD,FD2   = New Year's Day
              # M-F
              1*1:0:1:0:0:0*IBD               = New Year's Day

           and

              # Saturday
              1*1:0:1:0:0:0*IW6               = New Year's Day
              # Sunday (observed Monday)
              1*1:0:1:0:0:0*IW7,FD1           = New Year's Day
              # M-F
              1*1:0:1:0:0:0*IBD               = New Year's Day

</pre><h4><b>EVENTS</b></h4><pre>
       The Events section of the config file is similar to the Holiday section.  It is used to name certain days
       or times, but there are a few important differences:

       <b>Events</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>assigned</b> <b>to</b> <b>any</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>duration</b>
           All holidays are exactly 1 day long.  They are  assigned  to  a  period  of  time  from  midnight  to
           midnight.

           Events can be based at any time of the day, and may be of any duration.

       <b>Events</b> <b>don't</b> <b>affect</b> <b>business</b> <b>mode</b> <b>calculations</b>
           Unlike holidays, events are completely ignored when doing business mode calculations.

       Whereas  holidays  were  added  with  business  mode  math  in  mind, events were added with calendar and
       scheduling applications in mind.

       Every line in the events section is of the form:

          EVENT = NAME

       where NAME is the name of the event, and EVENT defines when it occurs and its duration.  An EVENT can  be
       defined in the following ways:

          Date
          YMD
          YM
          Recur

          Date  ; Date
          YMD   ; YMD
          YM    ; YM
          Date  ; Delta
          Recur ; Delta

       Date refers to a full date/time (and is any string that can be parsed by "Date::Manip::Date::parse"). YMD
       is  any  string  which  can  be  parsed by "Date::Manip::Date::parse_date". YM is any string which can be
       parsed by the parse_date method to give a date in the current year. Recur is a partial or fully specified
       recurrence. Delta is any string that can be parsed to form a delta.

       With the "Date" form, or the "Recur" form, the event starts at the time (or times) specified by the  date
       or  recurrence,  and last 1 hour long.  With the "YMD" and "YM" forms, the event occurs on the given day,
       and lasts all day.

       With all of the two part forms ("Date;Date", "YM;YM", etc.), the event starts at the first date and  goes
       to the second date, or goes an amount of time specified by the delta.

       The "YMD;YMD" and "YM;YM" forms means that the event lasts from the start of the first date to the end of
       the  second.  In  the Date;Date form, the event goes from the first date to the second date inclusive. In
       other words, both dates are in the event. In the "Date;Delta" and "Recur;Delta" forms,  the  Delta  tells
       the length of the event. Also, in the Date;Date form, the second date may NOT be expressed as a delta.

       Currently, having an event longer than 1 year is NOT supported, but no checking is done for this.
