</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Test2::Util::Grabber - Object used to temporarily intercept all events.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Once created this object will intercept and stash all events sent to the shared Test2::Hub object. Once
       the object is destroyed, events will once again be sent to the shared hub.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Test2 qw/Core Grab/;

           my $grab = grab();

           # Generate some events, they are intercepted.
           ok(1, "pass");
           ok(0, "fail");

           my $events_a = $grab-&gt;flush;

           # Generate some more events, they are intercepted.
           ok(1, "pass");
           ok(0, "fail");

           # Same as flush, except it destroys the grab object.
           my $events_b = $grab-&gt;finish;

       After calling finish() the grab object is destroyed and $grab is set to undef. $events_a is an arrayref
       with the first two events. $events_b is an arrayref with the second two events.

</pre><h4><b>EXPORTS</b></h4><pre>
       $grab = <b>grab()</b>
           This  lets you intercept all events for a section of code without adding anything to your call stack.
           This is useful for things that are sensitive to changes in the stack depth.

               my $grab = grab();
                   ok(1, 'foo');
                   ok(0, 'bar');

               # $grab is magically undef after this.
               my $events = $grab-&gt;finish;

               is(@$events, 2, "grabbed two events.");

           When you call finish() the $grab object will automagically undef itself, but only for  the  reference
           used  in  the  method  call. If you have other references to the $grab object they will not be set to
           undef.

           If the $grab object is destroyed without calling finish(),  it  will  automatically  clean  up  after
           itself and restore the parent hub.

               {
                   my $grab = grab();
                   # Things are grabbed
               }
               # Things are back to normal

           By  default  the  hub used has "no_ending" set to true. This will prevent the hub from enforcing that
           you issued a plan and ran at least one test. You can turn enforcement back one like this:

               $grab-&gt;hub-&gt;<a href="../man0/set_no_ending.0.html">set_no_ending</a>(0);

           With "no_ending" turned off, "finish" will run the post-test checks to  enforce  the  plan  and  that
           tests were run. In many cases this will result in additional events in your events array.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       $grab = $class-&gt;<b>new()</b>
           Create a new grab object, immediately starts intercepting events.

       $ar = $grab-&gt;<b>flush()</b>
           Get an arrayref of all the events so far, clearing the grab objects internal list.

       $ar = $grab-&gt;<b>events()</b>
           Get an arrayref of all events so far. Does not clear the internal list.

       $ar = $grab-&gt;<b>finish()</b>
           Get an arrayref of all the events, then destroy the grab object.

       $hub = $grab-&gt;<b>hub()</b>
           Get the hub that is used by the grab event.

</pre><h4><b>ENDING</b> <b>BEHAVIOR</b></h4><pre>
       By  default  the  hub used has "no_ending" set to true. This will prevent the hub from enforcing that you
       issued a plan and ran at least one test. You can turn enforcement back one like this:

           $grab-&gt;hub-&gt;<a href="../man0/set_no_ending.0.html">set_no_ending</a>(0);

       With "no_ending" turned off, "finish" will run the post-test checks to enforce the plan  and  that  tests
       were run. In many cases this will result in additional events in your events array.
