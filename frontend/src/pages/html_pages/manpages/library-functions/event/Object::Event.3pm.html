</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Object::Event - A class that provides an event callback interface

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       Version 1.23

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
          package foo;
          use Object::Event;

          our @ISA = qw/Object::Event/;

          package main;
          my $o = foo-&gt;new;

          my $regguard = $o-&gt;reg_cb (foo =&gt; sub {
             print "I got an event, with these args: $_[1], $_[2], $_[3]\n";
          });

          $o-&gt;event (foo =&gt; 1, 2, 3);

          $o-&gt;unreg_cb ($regguard);
          # or just:
          $regguard = undef;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module was mainly written for AnyEvent::XMPP, AnyEvent::IRC, AnyEvent::HTTPD and BK to provide a
       consistent API for registering and emitting events.  Even though I originally wrote it for those modules
       I released it separately in case anyone may find this module useful.

       For more comprehensive event handling see also Glib and POE.

       This class provides a simple way to extend a class, by inheriting from this class, with an event callback
       interface.

       You will be able to register callbacks for events, identified by their names (a string) and call them
       later by invoking the "event" method with the event name and some arguments.

       There is even a syntactic sugar which allows one to call methods on the instances of
       Object::Event-derived classes, to invoke events.  For this feature see the "EVENT METHODS" section of
       this document.

</pre><h4><b>PERFORMANCE</b></h4><pre>
       In the first version as presented here no special performance optimisations have been applied. So take
       care that it is fast enough for your purposes.  At least for modules like AnyEvent::XMPP the overhead is
       probably not noticeable, as other technologies like XML already waste a lot more CPU cycles.  Also I/O
       usually introduces _much_ larger/longer overheads than this simple event interface.

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Object::Event::register_priority_alias ($alias, $priority)
           This  package  function  will  add  a global priority alias.  If $priority is undef the alias will be
           removed.

           There are 4 predefined aliases:

              before     =&gt;  1000
              ext_before =&gt;   500
              ext_after  =&gt;  -500
              after      =&gt; -1000

           See also the "reg_cb" method for more information about aliases.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       Object::Event-&gt;new (%args)
       Your::Subclass::Of::Object::Event-&gt;new (%args)
           This is the constructor for Object::Event, it will create a blessed hash reference  initialized  with
           %args.

       $obj-&gt;init_object_events ()
           This  method  should  only be called if you are not able to call the "new" constructor of this class.
           Then you need to call this method to initialize the event system.

       $obj-&gt;set_exception_cb ($cb-&gt;($exception, $eventname))
           This method installs a callback that  will  be  called  when  some  other  event  callback  threw  an
           exception. The first argument to $cb will be the exception and the second the event name.

       $guard = $obj-&gt;reg_cb ($eventname =&gt; $cb-&gt;($obj, @args), ...)
       $guard = $obj-&gt;reg_cb ($eventname =&gt; $prio, $cb-&gt;($obj, @args), ...)
           This  method  registers  a  callback  $cb1 for the event with the name $eventname1. You can also pass
           multiple of these eventname =&gt; callback pairs.

           The return value $guard will be a guard that represents the set of callbacks you have installed.  You
           can  either  just "forget" the contents of $guard to unregister the callbacks or call "unreg_cb" with
           that ID to remove those callbacks again. If "reg_cb" is called in a void context no guard is returned
           and you have no chance to unregister the registered callbacks.

           The first argument for callbacks registered with the "reg_cb" function  will  always  be  the  master
           object $obj.

           The  return value of the callbacks are ignored. If you need to pass any information from a handler to
           the caller of the event you have to establish your own "protocol" to do this. I recommend to pass  an
           array reference to the handlers:

              $obj-&gt;reg_cb (event_foobar =&gt; sub {
                 my ($self, $results) = @_;
                 push @$results, time / 30;
              });

              my @results;
              $obj-&gt;event (event_foobar =&gt; \@results);
              for (@results) {
                 # ...
              }

           The  order  of  the callbacks in the call chain of the event depends on their priority. If you didn't
           specify any priority (see below) they get the default priority of 0, and are appended  to  the  other
           priority  0  callbacks.  The higher the priority number, the earlier the callbacks gets called in the
           chain.

           If $eventname1 starts with 'before_' the callback gets a priority of 1000,  and  if  it  starts  with
           'ext_before_' it gets the priority 500.  'after_' is mapped to the priority -1000 and 'ext_after_' to
           -500.

           If you want more fine grained control you can pass an array reference instead of the event name:

              ($eventname1, $prio) = ('test_abc', 100);
              $obj-&gt;reg_cb ([$eventname1, $prio] =&gt; sub {
                 ...
              });

       $obj-&gt;unreg_cb ($cb)
           Removes the callback $cb from the set of registered callbacks.

       my $handled = $obj-&gt;event ($eventname, @args)
           Emits the event $eventname and passes the arguments @args to the callbacks. The return value $handled
           is a true value in case some handler was found and run. It returns false if no handler was found (see
           also the "handles" method below). Basically: It returns the same value as the "handles" method.

           Please note that an event can be stopped and reinvoked while it is being handled.

           See also the specification of the before and after events in "reg_cb" above.

           NOTE:  Whenever  an  event  is  emitted the current set of callbacks registered to that event will be
           used. So, if you register another event callback for the same event that is executed at  the  moment,
           it will be called the <b>next</b> time when the event is emitted. Example:

              $obj-&gt;reg_cb (event_test =&gt; sub {
                 my ($obj) = @_;

                 print "Test1\n";
                 $obj-&gt;unreg_me;

                 $obj-&gt;reg_cb (event_test =&gt; sub {
                    my ($obj) = @_;
                    print "Test2\n";
                    $obj-&gt;unreg_me;
                 });
              });

              $obj-&gt;event ('event_test'); # prints "Test1"
              $obj-&gt;event ('event_test'); # prints "Test2"

       my $bool = $obj-&gt;handles ($eventname)
           This method returns true if any event handler has been setup for the event $eventname.

           It returns false if that is not the case.

       $obj-&gt;event_name
           Returns the name of the currently executed event.

       $obj-&gt;unreg_me
           Unregisters the currently executed callback.

       $continue_cb = $obj-&gt;stop_event
           This  method stops the execution of callbacks of the current event, and returns (in non-void context)
           a callback that will let you continue the execution.

       $obj-&gt;add_forward ($obj, $cb)
           <b>DEPRECATED:</b> <b>Don't</b> <b>use</b> <b>it!</b> Just for backward compatibility for AnyEvent::XMPP version 0.4.

       $obj-&gt;remove_forward ($obj)
           <b>DEPRECATED:</b> <b>Don't</b> <b>use</b> <b>it!</b> Just for backward compatibility for AnyEvent::XMPP version 0.4.

       $obj-&gt;remove_all_callbacks ()
           This method removes all registered event callbacks from this object.

       $obj-&gt;events_as_string_dump ()
           This method returns a string dump of all  registered  event  callbacks.   This  method  is  only  for
           debugging purposes.

</pre><h4><b>EVENT</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       You  can  define  static  methods  in  a package that act as event handler.  This is done by using Perl's
       attributes functionality. To make a method act as event handler you need to add the "event_cb"  attribute
       to it.

       <b>NOTE:</b>  Please  note that for this to work the methods need to be defined at compile time. This means that
       you are not able to add event handles using "AUTOLOAD"!

       <b>NOTE:</b> Perl's attributes have a very basic syntax, you have to take care to not insert any whitespace, the
       attribute must be a single string that contains no whitespace. That means: "event_cb (1)" is not the same
       as <a href="../man1/event_cb.1.html">event_cb</a>(1)!

       Here is an example:

          package foo;
          use base qw/Object::Event/;

          sub test : event_cb { print "test event handler!\n" }

          package main;
          my $o = foo-&gt;new;
          $o-&gt;test ();        # prints 'test event handler!'
          $o-&gt;event ('test'); # also prints 'test event handler!'!

       In case you want to set a priority use this syntax:

          sub test : event_cb(-1000) { ... }

       Or:

          sub test : event_cb(after) { ... }

       You may want to have a look at the tests of the Object::Event distribution for more examples.

   <b>ALIASES</b>
       If you want to define multiple event handlers as package method you can use the "event_cb" attribute with
       an additional argument:

          package foo;
          use base qw/Object::Event/;

          sub test : event_cb { # default prio is always 0
             print "middle\n";
          }

          sub test_last : event_cb(-1,test) {
             print "after\n";
          }

          sub test_first : event_cb(1,test) {
             print "before\n";
          }

          package main;
          my $o = foo-&gt;new;
          $o-&gt;test ();        # prints "after\n" "middle\n" "before\n"
          $o-&gt;event ('test'); # prints the same
          $o-&gt;test_first ();  # also prints the same

       <b>NOTE:</b> Please note that if you don't provide any order the methods are sorted <u>alphabetically</u>:

          package foo;
          use base qw/Object::Event/;

          sub test : event_cb { # default prio is always 0
             print "middle\n";
          }

          sub x : event_cb(, test) { # please note the empty element before the ','!
             print "after\n";
          }

          sub a : event_cb(, test) {
             print "before\n";
          }

          package main;
          my $o = foo-&gt;new;
          $o-&gt;test ();        # prints "after\n" "middle\n" "before\n"
          $o-&gt;event ('test'); # prints the same
          $o-&gt;x ();           # also prints the same

   <b>ALIAS</b> <b>ORDERING</b>
       The ordering of how the methods event handlers are called if they are all defined for the same  event  is
       strictly defined:

       1.  Ordering  of  the  methods for the same event in the inheritance hierarchy is always dominated by the
           priority of the event callback.

       2.  Then if there are multiple methods with the same priority the  place  in  the  inheritance  hierarchy
           defines  in  which  order  the methods are executed. The higher up in the hierarchy the class is, the
           earlier it will be called.

       3.  Inside a class the name of the method for the event decides which event is executed  first.  (All  if
           the priorities are the same)

</pre><h4><b>DEBUGGING</b></h4><pre>
       There exists a package global variable called $DEBUG that control debugging capabilities.

       Set it to 1 to produce a slightly extended "events_as_string_dump" output.

       Set it to 2 and all events will be dumped in a tree of event invocations.

       You can set the variable either in your main program:

          $Object::Event::DEBUG = 2;

       Or use the environment variable "PERL_OBJECT_EVENT_DEBUG":

          export PERL_OBJECT_EVENT_DEBUG=2
