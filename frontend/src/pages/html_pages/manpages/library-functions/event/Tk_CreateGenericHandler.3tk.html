       Tk_CreateGenericHandler, Tk_DeleteGenericHandler - associate procedure callback with all X events

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;tk.h&gt;</b>

       <b>Tk_CreateGenericHandler</b>(<u>proc,</u> <u>clientData</u>)

       <b>Tk_DeleteGenericHandler</b>(<u>proc,</u> <u>clientData</u>)

</pre><h4><b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Tk_GenericProc <u>*proc</u> (in)               Procedure to invoke whenever any X event occurs on any display.

       void <u>*clientData</u> (in)                   Arbitrary one-word value to pass to <u>proc</u>.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Tk_CreateGenericHandler</b>  arranges for <u>proc</u> to be invoked in the future whenever any X event occurs.  This
       mechanism is  <u>not</u>  intended  for  dispatching  X  events  on  windows  managed  by  Tk  (you  should  use
       <b>Tk_CreateEventHandler</b> for this purpose).  <b>Tk_CreateGenericHandler</b> is intended for other purposes, such as
       tracing  X  events, monitoring events on windows not owned by Tk, accessing X-related libraries that were
       not originally designed for use with Tk, and so on.

       The callback to <u>proc</u> will be made by <b>Tk_HandleEvent</b>; this mechanism only works in programs that  dispatch
       events  through  <b>Tk_HandleEvent</b>  (or  through  other  Tk  procedures  that  call  <b>Tk_HandleEvent</b>, such as
       <b>Tcl_DoOneEvent</b> or <b>Tk_MainLoop</b>).

       <u>Proc</u> should have arguments and result that match the type <b>Tk_GenericProc</b>:
              typedef int <b>Tk_GenericProc</b>(
                      void *<u>clientData</u>,
                      XEvent *<u>eventPtr</u>);
       The <u>clientData</u> parameter to <u>proc</u> is a copy of the <u>clientData</u> argument  given  to  <b>Tk_CreateGenericHandler</b>
       when  the callback was created.  Typically, <u>clientData</u> points to a data structure containing application-
       specific information about how to handle events.  <u>EventPtr</u> is a pointer to the X event.

       Whenever an X event is processed by <b>Tk_HandleEvent</b>, <u>proc</u> is  called.   The  return  value  from  <u>proc</u>  is
       normally 0.  A non-zero return value indicates that the event is not to be handled further; that is, <u>proc</u>
       has done all processing that is to be allowed for the event.

       If  there  are  multiple generic event handlers, each one is called for each event, in the order in which
       they were established.

       <b>Tk_DeleteGenericHandler</b> may be called to delete a previously-created generic event handler:   it  deletes
       each  handler  it  finds that matches the <u>proc</u> and <u>clientData</u> arguments.  If no such handler exists, then
       <b>Tk_DeleteGenericHandler</b> returns without doing anything.  Although Tk supports it,  it's  probably  a  bad
       idea to have more than one callback with the same <u>proc</u> and <u>clientData</u> arguments.

       Establishing  a generic event handler does nothing to ensure that the process will actually receive the X
       events that the handler wants to process.  For example, it  is  the  caller's  responsibility  to  invoke
       <b>XSelectInput</b> to select the desired events, if that is necessary.
