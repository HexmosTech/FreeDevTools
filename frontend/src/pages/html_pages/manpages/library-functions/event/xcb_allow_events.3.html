       xcb_allow_events - release queued events

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;xcb/xproto.h&gt;</b>

   <b>Request</b> <b>function</b>

       xcb_void_cookie_t <b>xcb_allow_events</b>(xcb_connection_t *<u>conn</u>, uint8_t <u>mode</u>, xcb_timestamp_t <u>time</u>);

</pre><h4><b>REQUEST</b> <b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>conn</u>      The XCB connection to X11.

       <u>mode</u>      One of the following values:

                 <u>XCB_ALLOW_ASYNC_POINTER</u>
                           For  AsyncPointer,  if  the pointer is frozen by the client, pointer event processing
                           continues normally. If the pointer is frozen twice by the client  on  behalf  of  two
                           separate grabs, AsyncPointer thaws for both. AsyncPointer has no effect if the point‐
                           er is not frozen by the client, but the pointer need not be grabbed by the client.

                           TODO: rewrite this in more understandable terms.

                 <u>XCB_ALLOW_SYNC_POINTER</u>
                           For SyncPointer, if the pointer is frozen and actively grabbed by the client, pointer
                           event processing continues normally until the next ButtonPress or ButtonRelease event
                           is  reported to the client, at which time the pointer again appears to freeze. Howev‐
                           er, if the reported event causes the pointer grab to be released,  then  the  pointer
                           does not freeze. SyncPointer has no effect if the pointer is not frozen by the client
                           or if the pointer is not grabbed by the client.

                 <u>XCB_ALLOW_REPLAY_POINTER</u>
                           For  ReplayPointer, if the pointer is actively grabbed by the client and is frozen as
                           the result of an event having been sent to the client (either from the activation  of
                           a  GrabButton  or  from  a  previous AllowEvents with mode SyncPointer but not from a
                           GrabPointer), then the pointer grab is released and  that  event  is  completely  re‐
                           processed,  this  time  ignoring any passive grabs at or above (towards the root) the
                           grab-window of the grab just released. The request has no effect if  the  pointer  is
                           not grabbed by the client or if the pointer is not frozen as the result of an event.

                 <u>XCB_ALLOW_ASYNC_KEYBOARD</u>
                           For AsyncKeyboard, if the keyboard is frozen by the client, keyboard event processing
                           continues  normally.  If  the keyboard is frozen twice by the client on behalf of two
                           separate grabs, AsyncKeyboard thaws for both. AsyncKeyboard has no effect if the key‐
                           board is not frozen by the client, but the  keyboard  need  not  be  grabbed  by  the
                           client.

                 <u>XCB_ALLOW_SYNC_KEYBOARD</u>
                           For  SyncKeyboard, if the keyboard is frozen and actively grabbed by the client, key‐
                           board event processing continues normally until the next KeyPress or KeyRelease event
                           is reported to the client, at which time the keyboard again appears to freeze. Howev‐
                           er, if the reported event causes the keyboard grab to be released, then the  keyboard
                           does  not  freeze.  SyncKeyboard  has  no effect if the keyboard is not frozen by the
                           client or if the keyboard is not grabbed by the client.

                 <u>XCB_ALLOW_REPLAY_KEYBOARD</u>
                           For ReplayKeyboard, if the keyboard is actively grabbed by the client and  is  frozen
                           as  the result of an event having been sent to the client (either from the activation
                           of a GrabKey or from a previous AllowEvents with mode SyncKeyboard  but  not  from  a
                           GrabKeyboard),  then  the  keyboard grab is released and that event is completely re‐
                           processed, this time ignoring any passive grabs at or above (towards  the  root)  the
                           grab-window  of  the grab just released. The request has no effect if the keyboard is
                           not grabbed by the client or if the keyboard is not frozen as the result of an event.

                 <u>XCB_ALLOW_ASYNC_BOTH</u>
                           For AsyncBoth, if the pointer and the keyboard are frozen by the client,  event  pro‐
                           cessing  for  both  devices  continues  normally.  If a device is frozen twice by the
                           client on behalf of two separate grabs, AsyncBoth thaws for both.  AsyncBoth  has  no
                           effect unless both pointer and keyboard are frozen by the client.

                 <u>XCB_ALLOW_SYNC_BOTH</u>
                           For SyncBoth, if both pointer and keyboard are frozen by the client, event processing
                           (for both devices) continues normally until the next ButtonPress, ButtonRelease, Key‐
                           Press,  or  KeyRelease  event  is reported to the client for a grabbed device (button
                           event for the pointer, key event for the keyboard), at which time the  devices  again
                           appear to freeze. However, if the reported event causes the grab to be released, then
                           the  devices  do  not freeze (but if the other device is still grabbed, then a subse‐
                           quent event for it will still cause both devices to freeze). SyncBoth has  no  effect
                           unless both pointer and keyboard are frozen by the client. If the pointer or keyboard
                           is  frozen  twice  by  the client on behalf of two separate grabs, SyncBoth thaws for
                           both (but a subsequent freeze for SyncBoth will only freeze each device once).

       <u>time</u>      Timestamp to avoid race conditions when running X over the network.

                 The special value <u>XCB_CURRENT_TIME</u> will be replaced with the current server time.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Releases queued events if the client has caused a device (pointer/keyboard) to freeze due to grabbing  it
       actively. This request has no effect if <u>time</u> is earlier than the last-grab time of the most recent active
       grab for this client or if <u>time</u> is later than the current X server time.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       Returns an <u>xcb_void_cookie_t</u>. Errors (if any) have to be handled in the event loop.

       If  you  want to handle errors directly with <u>xcb_request_check</u> instead, use <u>xcb_allow_events_checked</u>. See
       <b><a href="../man3/xcb-requests.3.html">xcb-requests</a>(3)</b> for details.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>xcb_value_error_t</u>
                 You specified an invalid <u>mode</u>.
