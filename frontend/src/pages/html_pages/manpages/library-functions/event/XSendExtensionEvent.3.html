       XSendExtensionEvent - send input extension events to a client

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;X11/extensions/XInput.h&gt;

       Status XSendExtensionEvent( Display *display,
                                   XDevice *device,
                                   Window destination,
                                   Bool propagate,
                                   int event_count,
                                   XEventClass *event_list,
                                   XEvent *event_send);

       display
              Specifies the connection to the X server.

       device
              Specifies the device from which the events are to be
              sent.

       destination
              Specifies the window the event is to be sent to. You can
              pass window id, PointerWindow, or InputFocus.

       propagate
              Specifies a Boolean value that is either True or False.

       event_count
              Specifies the count of XEventClasses in event_list.

       event_list
              Specifies the list of event selections to be used.

       event_send
              Specifies a pointer to the event that is to be sent.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
           The XSendExtensionEvent request identifies the destination
           window, determines which clients should receive the specified
           events, and ignores any active grabs. This request requires you
           to pass an event class list. For a discussion of the valid
           event class names, see <a href="../man3/XOpenDevice.3.html">XOpenDevice</a>(3) This
           request uses the w argument to identify the destination window
           as follows:
             * If w is PointerWindow, the destination window is the window
               that contains the pointer.
             * If w is InputFocus and if the focus window contains the
               pointer, the destination window is the window that contains
               the pointer; otherwise, the destination window is the focus
               window.

           To determine which clients should receive the specified events,
           XSendExtensionEvent uses the propagate argument as follows:
             * If event_list is the empty set, the event is sent to the
               client that created the destination window. If that client
               no longer exists, no event is sent.
             * If propagate is False, the event is sent to every client
               selecting on destination any of the event types specified by
               the event_list array.
             * If propagate is True and no clients have selected on
               destination any of the events specified by the event_list
               array, the destination is replaced with the closest ancestor
               of destination for which some client has selected a type
               specified by the event-list array and for which no
               intervening window has that type in
               its do-not-propagate-mask. If no such window exists or if
               the window is an ancestor of the focus window and
               InputFocus was originally specified as the destination, the
               event is not sent to any clients. Otherwise, the event is
               reported to every client selecting on the final destination
               any of the events specified in the event_list array.

           The event in the XEvent structure must be one of the events
           defined by the input extension (or a BadValue error results) so
           that the X server can correctly byte-swap the contents as
           necessary. The contents of the event are otherwise unaltered and
           unchecked by the X server except to force send_event to True in
           the forwarded event and to set the serial number in the event
           correctly.

           XSendExtensionEvent returns zero if the conversion to wire
           protocol format failed and returns nonzero
           otherwise. XSendExtensionEvent can generate BadClass, BadDevice,
           BadValue, and BadWindow errors.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
           BadDevice
                  An invalid device was specified. The specified device
                  does not exist or has not been opened by this client via
                  XOpenInputDevice. This error may also occur if the
                  specified device is the X keyboard or X pointer device.

           BadValue
                  Some numeric value falls outside the range of values
                  accepted by the request. Unless a specific range is
                  specified for an argument, the full range defined by the
                  argument's type is accepted. Any argument defined as a
                  set of alternatives can generate this error.

           BadWindow
                  A value for a Window argument does not name a defined
                  window.
