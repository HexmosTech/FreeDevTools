</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       rdma_get_cm_event - Retrieves the next pending communication event.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;rdma/rdma_cma.h&gt;</b>

       <b>int</b> <b>rdma_get_cm_event</b> <b>(struct</b> <b>rdma_event_channel</b> <b>*</b><u>channel</u><b>,</b> <b>struct</b> <b>rdma_cm_event</b> <b>**</b><u>event</u><b>);</b>

</pre><h4><b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       channel     Event channel to check for events.

       event       Allocated information about the next communication event.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Retrieves  a  communication  event.   If  no events are pending, by default, the call will block until an
       event is received.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       Returns 0 on success, or -1 on error.  If an error occurs, errno will be  set  to  indicate  the  failure
       reason.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       The  default  synchronous  behavior  of  this  routine  can  be  changed by modifying the file descriptor
       associated with the given channel.  All  events  that  are  reported  must  be  acknowledged  by  calling
       rdma_ack_cm_event.  Destruction of an rdma_cm_id will block until related events have been acknowledged.

</pre><h4><b>EVENT</b> <b>DATA</b></h4><pre>
       Communication  event details are returned in the rdma_cm_event structure.  This structure is allocated by
       the rdma_cm and released by the rdma_ack_cm_event routine.  Details of the  rdma_cm_event  structure  are
       given below.

       id          The   rdma_cm   identifier   associated   with   the   event.    If   the   event   type   is
                   RDMA_CM_EVENT_CONNECT_REQUEST, then this references a new id for that communication.

       listen_id   For RDMA_CM_EVENT_CONNECT_REQUEST event types, this references  the  corresponding  listening
                   request identifier.

       event       Specifies the type of communication event which occurred.  See EVENT TYPES below.

       status      Returns  any  asynchronous error information associated with an event.  The status is zero if
                   the operation was successful, otherwise the status value is non-zero and is either set  to  a
                   negative  errno  or  a  transport  specific  value.  For details on transport specific status
                   values, see the event type information below.

       param       Provides additional details based on the type of event.  Users should select the conn  or  ud
                   subfields  based  on the rdma_port_space of the rdma_cm_id associated with the event.  See UD
                   EVENT DATA and CONN EVENT DATA below.

</pre><h4><b>UD</b> <b>EVENT</b> <b>DATA</b></h4><pre>
       Event parameters related to unreliable datagram (UD) services: RDMA_PS_UDP  and  RDMA_PS_IPOIB.   The  UD
       event  data is valid for RDMA_CM_EVENT_ESTABLISHED and RDMA_CM_EVENT_MULTICAST_JOIN events, unless stated
       otherwise.

       private_data
                   References  any  user-specified  data  associated   with   RDMA_CM_EVENT_CONNECT_REQUEST   or
                   RDMA_CM_EVENT_ESTABLISHED  events.   The data referenced by this field matches that specified
                   by the remote side when calling rdma_connect or rdma_accept.  This field is NULL if the event
                   does not include private data.  The buffer referenced by this  pointer  is  deallocated  when
                   calling rdma_ack_cm_event.

       private_data_len
                   The  size  of  the  private data buffer.  Users should note that the size of the private data
                   buffer may be larger than the amount of private data sent by the remote side.  Any additional
                   space in the buffer will be zeroed out.

       ah_attr     Address information needed to send data to the remote endpoint(s).   Users  should  use  this
                   structure when allocating their address handle.

       qp_num      QP number of the remote endpoint or multicast group.

       qkey        QKey needed to send data to the remote endpoint(s).

</pre><h4><b>CONN</b> <b>EVENT</b> <b>DATA</b></h4><pre>
       Event  parameters  related  to  connected QP services: RDMA_PS_TCP.  The connection related event data is
       valid for RDMA_CM_EVENT_CONNECT_REQUEST and RDMA_CM_EVENT_ESTABLISHED events, unless stated otherwise.

       private_data
                   References any user-specified data associated with the event.  The data  referenced  by  this
                   field  matches  that  specified  by the remote side when calling rdma_connect or rdma_accept.
                   This field is NULL if the event does not include private data.  The buffer referenced by this
                   pointer is deallocated when calling rdma_ack_cm_event.

       private_data_len
                   The size of the private data buffer.  Users should note that the size  of  the  private  data
                   buffer may be larger than the amount of private data sent by the remote side.  Any additional
                   space in the buffer will be zeroed out.

       responder_resources
                   The  number  of  responder  resources  requested  of  the  recipient.  This field matches the
                   initiator depth specified by the remote node when calling rdma_connect and rdma_accept.

       initiator_depth
                   The maximum number of outstanding RDMA read/atomic operations that  the  recipient  may  have
                   outstanding.   This  field  matches the responder resources specified by the remote node when
                   calling rdma_connect and rdma_accept.

       flow_control
                   Indicates if hardware level flow control is provided by the sender.

       retry_count For RDMA_CM_EVENT_CONNECT_REQUEST events  only,  indicates  the  number  of  times  that  the
                   recipient should retry send operations.

       rnr_retry_count
                   The number of times that the recipient should retry receiver not ready (RNR) NACK errors.

       srq         Specifies if the sender is using a shared-receive queue.

       qp_num      Indicates the remote QP number for the connection.

</pre><h4><b>EVENT</b> <b>TYPES</b></h4><pre>
       The following types of communication events may be reported.

       RDMA_CM_EVENT_ADDR_RESOLVED
              Address resolution (rdma_resolve_addr) completed successfully.

       RDMA_CM_EVENT_ADDR_ERROR
              Address resolution (rdma_resolve_addr) failed.

       RDMA_CM_EVENT_ROUTE_RESOLVED
              Route resolution (rdma_resolve_route) completed successfully.

       RDMA_CM_EVENT_ROUTE_ERROR
              Route resolution (rdma_resolve_route) failed.

       RDMA_CM_EVENT_CONNECT_REQUEST
              Generated on the passive side to notify the user of a new connection request.

       RDMA_CM_EVENT_CONNECT_RESPONSE
              Generated  on the active side to notify the user of a successful response to a connection request.
              It is only generated on rdma_cm_id's that do not have a QP associated with them.

       RDMA_CM_EVENT_CONNECT_ERROR
              Indicates that an error has occurred trying to establish or a connection.  May be generated on the
              active or passive side of a connection.

       RDMA_CM_EVENT_UNREACHABLE
              Generated on the active side to notify the user that the remote server is not reachable or  unable
              to  respond to a connection request.  If this event is generated in response to a UD QP resolution
              request over InfiniBand, the event status field will contain an errno, if negative, or the  status
              result carried in the IB CM SIDR REP message.

       RDMA_CM_EVENT_REJECTED
              Indicates  that  a connection request or response was rejected by the remote end point.  The event
              status field will contain the transport specific reject reason if  available.   Under  InfiniBand,
              this is the reject reason carried in the IB CM REJ message.

       RDMA_CM_EVENT_ESTABLISHED
              Indicates that a connection has been established with the remote end point.

       RDMA_CM_EVENT_DISCONNECTED
              The connection has been disconnected.

       RDMA_CM_EVENT_DEVICE_REMOVAL
              The local RDMA device associated with the rdma_cm_id has been removed.  Upon receiving this event,
              the user must destroy the related rdma_cm_id.

       RDMA_CM_EVENT_MULTICAST_JOIN
              The multicast join operation (rdma_join_multicast) completed successfully.

       RDMA_CM_EVENT_MULTICAST_ERROR
              An  error  either occurred joining a multicast group, or, if the group had already been joined, on
              an existing group.  The specified multicast group is no longer accessible and should be  rejoined,
              if desired.

       RDMA_CM_EVENT_ADDR_CHANGE
              The  network  device associated with this ID through address resolution changed its HW address, eg
              following of bonding failover. This event can serve as a hint for applications who want the  links
              used for their RDMA sessions to align with the network stack.

       RDMA_CM_EVENT_TIMEWAIT_EXIT
              The  QP associated with a connection has exited its timewait state and is now ready to be re-used.
              After a QP has been disconnected, it is maintained in a timewait state  to  allow  any  in  flight
              packets to exit the network.  After the timewait state has completed, the rdma_cm will report this
              event.
