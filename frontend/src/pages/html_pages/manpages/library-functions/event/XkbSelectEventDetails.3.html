       XkbSelectEventDetails  -   Selects or deselects for a specific Xkb event and optionally places conditions
       on when events of that type are reported to your client

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>Bool</b> <b>XkbSelectEventDetails</b> <b>(Display</b> <b>*</b><u>display</u><b>,</b> <b>unsigned</b> <b>int</b> <u>device_spec</u><b>,</b> <b>unsigned</b> <b>int</b> <u>event_type</u><b>,</b> <b>unsigned</b>
              <b>long</b> <b>int</b> <u>bits_to_change</u><b>,</b> <b>unsigned</b> <b>long</b> <b>int</b> <u>values_for_bits</u><b>);</b>

</pre><h4><b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>display</u>
              connection to the X server

       <u>device_spec</u>
              device ID, or XkbUseCoreKbd

       <u>event_type</u>
              Xkb event type of interest

       <u>bits_to_change</u>
              determines events to be selected / deselected

       <u>values_for_bits</u>
              1=&gt;select, 0-&gt;deselect; for events in bits_to_change

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Xkb events are selected using an event mask, much the same as normal core X events are selected. However,
       unlike selecting core X events, where you must specify the selection status (on or off) for all  possible
       event  types  whenever  you  wish  to  change the selection criteria for any one event, Xkb allows you to
       restrict the specification to only the event types you wish to change. This means that you do not need to
       remember the event selection values for all possible types each time you want to change one of them.

       Many Xkb event types are generated under several different circumstances. When selecting  to  receive  an
       Xkb event, you may specify either that you want it delivered under all circumstances, or that you want it
       delivered only for a subset of the possible circumstances.

       You can also deselect an event type that was previously selected for, using the same granularity.

       Xkb  provides two functions to select and deselect delivery of Xkb events.  <u>XkbSelectEvents</u> allows you to
       select  or  deselect  delivery  of  more  than  one  Xkb  event  type  at  once.  Events  selected  using
       <u>XkbSelectEvents</u>  are  delivered  to  your  program  under all circumstances that generate the events.  To
       restrict  delivery  of  an  event  to  a  subset  of  the  conditions  under   which   it   occurs,   use
       <u>XkbSelectEventDetails.</u>  <u>XkbSelectEventDetails</u>  only  allows  you to change the selection conditions for a
       single event at a time, but it provides a means of fine-tuning the conditions under which  the  event  is
       delivered.

       To  select  or  deselect  for a specific Xkb event and optionally place conditions on when events of that
       type are reported to your client, use  <u>XkbSelectEventDetails.</u>   This  allows  you  to  exercise  a  finer
       granularity of control over delivery of Xkb events with <u>XkbSelectEvents.</u>

       While  <u>XkbSelectEvents</u> allows multiple events to be selected, <u>XkbSelectEventDetails</u> changes the selection
       criteria for a single type of Xkb event. The interpretation of  the  <u>bits_to_change</u>  and  <u>values_for_bits</u>
       masks depends on the event type in question.

       <u>XkbSelectEventDetails</u>  changes the Xkb event selection mask for the keyboard specified by <u>device_spec</u> and
       the Xkb event specified by <u>event_type.</u>  To turn on event selection for an event detail, set the  bit  for
       the  detail  in  the  <u>bits_to_change</u>  parameter  and  set  the  corresponding  bit in the <u>values_for_bits</u>
       parameter. To turn off event detail  selection  for  a  detail,  set  the  bit  for  the  detail  in  the
       <u>bits_to_change</u> parameter and do not set the corresponding bit in the <u>values_for_bits</u> parameter.

       If  an  invalid  event  type  is specified, a BadValue protocol error results. If a bit is not set in the
       <u>bits_to_change</u> parameter, but the corresponding bit is set in the <u>values_for_bits</u> parameter,  a  BadMatch
       protocol  error  results.  If an undefined bit is set in either the <u>bits_to_change</u> or the <u>values_for_bits</u>
       parameter, a BadValue protocol error results.

       For each type of Xkb event, the legal event details that you can  specify  in  the  <u>XkbSelectEventDetails</u>
       request are listed in the chapters that describe each event in detail.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       BadMatch       A  compatible  version  of  Xkb was not available in the server or an argument has correct
                      type and range, but is otherwise invalid

       BadValue       An argument is out of range
