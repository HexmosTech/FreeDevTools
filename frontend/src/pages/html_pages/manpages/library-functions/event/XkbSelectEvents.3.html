       XkbSelectEvents  -   Selects  and  /  or  deselects  for  delivery of one or more Xkb events and has them
       delivered under all conditions

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>Bool</b> <b>XkbSelectEvents</b> <b>(Display</b> <b>*</b><u>display</u><b>,</b> <b>unsigned</b>  <b>int</b>  <u>device_spec</u><b>,</b>  <b>unsigned</b>  <b>long</b>  <b>int</b>  <u>bits_to_change</u><b>,</b>
              <b>unsigned</b> <b>long</b> <b>int</b> <u>values_for_bits</u><b>);</b>

</pre><h4><b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>display</u>
              connection to the X server

       <u>device_spec</u>
              device ID, or XkbUseCoreKbd

       <u>bits_to_change</u>
              determines events to be selected / deselected

       <u>values_for_bits</u>
              1=&gt;select, 0-&gt;deselect; for events in bits_to_change

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Xkb events are selected using an event mask, much the same as normal core X events are selected. However,
       unlike  selecting core X events, where you must specify the selection status (on or off) for all possible
       event types whenever you wish to change the selection criteria for any  one  event,  Xkb  allows  you  to
       restrict the specification to only the event types you wish to change. This means that you do not need to
       remember the event selection values for all possible types each time you want to change one of them.

       Many  Xkb  event  types are generated under several different circumstances. When selecting to receive an
       Xkb event, you may specify either that you want it delivered under all circumstances, or that you want it
       delivered only for a subset of the possible circumstances.

       You can also deselect an event type that was previously selected for, using the same granularity.

       Xkb provides two functions to select and deselect delivery of Xkb events.  <u>XkbSelectEvents</u> allows you  to
       select  or  deselect  delivery  of  more  than  one  Xkb  event  type  at  once.  Events  selected  using
       <u>XkbSelectEvents</u> are delivered to your program under all  circumstances  that  generate  the  events.   To
       restrict   delivery   of   an   event  to  a  subset  of  the  conditions  under  which  it  occurs,  use
       <u>XkbSelectEventDetails.</u> <u>XkbSelectEventDetails</u> only allows you to change the  selection  conditions  for  a
       single  event  at  a time, but it provides a means of fine-tuning the conditions under which the event is
       delivered.

       This request changes the Xkb event selection mask for the keyboard specified by <u>device_spec.</u>

       Each Xkb event that can be selected is represented by a bit in  the  <u>bits_to_change</u>  and  <u>values_for_bits</u>
       masks.  Only  the  event  selection  bits  specified  by  the  <u>bits_to_change</u> parameter are affected; any
       unspecified bits are left unchanged. To turn on event selection for an event, set the bit for  the  event
       in  the  <u>bits_to_change</u> parameter and set the corresponding bit in the <u>values_for_bits</u> parameter. To turn
       off event selection for an event, set the bit for the event in the <u>bits_to_change</u> parameter  and  do  not
       set the corresponding bit in the <u>values_for_bits</u> parameter. The valid values for both of these parameters
       are  an inclusive bitwise OR of the masks shown in Table 1. There is no interface to return your client's
       current event selection mask. Clients cannot set other clients' event selection masks.

       The X server reports the events defined by Xkb to your client application only if you have requested them
       via a call to <u>XkbSelectEvents</u> or <u>XkbSelectEventDetails.</u>   Specify  the  event  types  in  which  you  are
       interested in a mask.

       Table  1  lists  the  event mask constants that can be specified with the <u>XkbSelectEvents</u> request and the
       circumstances in which the mask should be specified.

                        Table 1 XkbSelectEvents Mask Constants
       ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
       Event Mask                     Value      Notification Wanted
       ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
       XkbNewKeyboardNotifyMask       (1L&lt;&lt;0)    Keyboard geometry change
       XkbMapNotifyMask               (1L&lt;&lt;1)    Keyboard mapping change
       XkbStateNotifyMask             (1L&lt;&lt;2)    Keyboard state change
       XkbControlsNotifyMask          (1L&lt;&lt;3)    Keyboard control change
       XkbIndicatorStateNotifyMask    (1L&lt;&lt;4)    Keyboard indicator state change
       XkbIndicatorMapNotifyMask      (1L&lt;&lt;5)    Keyboard indicator map change
       XkbNamesNotifyMask             (1L&lt;&lt;6)    Keyboard name change
       XkbCompatMapNotifyMask         (1L&lt;&lt;7)    Keyboard compat map change
       XkbBellNotifyMask              (1L&lt;&lt;8)    Bell
       XkbActionMessageMask           (1L&lt;&lt;9)    Action message
       XkbAccessXNotifyMask           (1L&lt;&lt;10)   AccessX features
       XkbExtensionDeviceNotifyMask   (1L&lt;&lt;11)   Extension device
       XkbAllEventsMask               (0xFFF)    All Xkb events

       If a bit is not  set  in  the  <u>bits_to_change</u>  parameter,  but  the  corresponding  bit  is  set  in  the
       <u>values_for_bits</u>  parameter,  a  BadMatch protocol error results. If an undefined bit is set in either the
       <u>bits_to_change</u> or the <u>values_for_bits</u> parameter, a BadValue protocol error results.

       All event selection bits are initially zero for clients using the Xkb extension.  Once you set some bits,
       they remain set for your client until you clear them via another call to <u>XkbSelectEvents.</u>

       <u>XkbSelectEvents</u> returns False if the Xkb extension has not been initialized and True otherwise.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUES</b></h4><pre>
       True           The <u>XkbSelectEvents</u> function returns True if the Xkb extension has been initialized.

       False          The <u>XkbSelectEvents</u> function returns False if the Xkb extension has not been initialized.
