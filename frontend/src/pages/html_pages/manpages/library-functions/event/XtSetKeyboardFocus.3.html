       XtSetKeyboardFocus - focus events on a child widget

</pre><h4><b>SYNTAX</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;X11/Intrinsic.h&gt;

       void XtSetKeyboardFocus(Widget <u>subtree</u>, Widget <u>descendant</u>);

</pre><h4><b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>subtree</u>   Specifies either the widget in the subtree structure which is to receive the keyboard event, or
                 <b>None</b>.  Note that it is not an error to specify <b>None</b> when no input focus was previously set.

       <u>descendant</u>
                 Specifies the widget for which the keyboard focus is to be set.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       If  a  future <b>KeyPress</b> or <b>KeyRelease</b> event occurs within the specified subtree, <b>XtSetKeyboardFocus</b> causes
       <b>XtDispatchEvent</b> to remap and send the event to the specified descendant widget.

       When there is no modal cascade, keyboard events can occur within a widget W in one of three ways:

       •    W has the X input focus.

       •    W has the keyboard focus of one of its ancestors, and the event occurs within the ancestor or one of
            the ancestor's descendants.

       •    No ancestor of W has a descendant within the keyboard focus, and the pointer is within W.

       When there is a modal cascade, a widget W receives keyboard events if an ancestor of W is in  the  active
       subset of the modal cascade and one or more of the previous conditions is <b>True</b>.

       When  subtree  or one of its descendants acquires the X input focus or the pointer moves into the subtree
       such that keyboard events would now be delivered to  subtree,  a  <b>FocusIn</b>  event  is  generated  for  the
       descendant  if  <b>FocusNotify</b>  events  have been selected by the descendant.  Similarly, when W loses the X
       input focus or the keyboard focus for one of its ancestors, a <b>FocusOut</b> event is generated for  descendant
       if <b>FocusNotify</b> events have been selected by the descendant.
