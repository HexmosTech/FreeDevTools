       Tcl_DoOneEvent - wait for events and invoke event handlers

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;tcl.h&gt;</b>

       int
       <b>Tcl_DoOneEvent</b>(<u>flags</u>)

</pre><h4><b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       int <u>flags</u> (in)          This  parameter  is  normally zero.  It may be an OR-ed combination of any of the
                               following  flag  bits:  <b>TCL_WINDOW_EVENTS</b>,   <b>TCL_FILE_EVENTS</b>,   <b>TCL_TIMER_EVENTS</b>,
                               <b>TCL_IDLE_EVENTS</b>, <b>TCL_ALL_EVENTS</b>, or <b>TCL_DONT_WAIT</b>.
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  procedure  is  the  entry  point  to Tcl's event loop; it is responsible for waiting for events and
       dispatching event handlers created with procedures such as <b>Tk_CreateEventHandler</b>,  <b>Tcl_CreateFileHandler</b>,
       <b>Tcl_CreateTimerHandler</b>,  and  <b>Tcl_DoWhenIdle</b>.  <b>Tcl_DoOneEvent</b> checks to see if events are already present
       on the Tcl event queue; if so, it calls the handler(s) for the first (oldest) event, removes it from  the
       queue,  and  returns.   If  there  are  no events ready to be handled, then <b>Tcl_DoOneEvent</b> checks for new
       events from all possible sources.  If any are found, it puts all of them  on  Tcl's  event  queue,  calls
       handlers  for  the  first event on the queue, and returns.  If no events are found, <b>Tcl_DoOneEvent</b> checks
       for <b>Tcl_DoWhenIdle</b> callbacks; if any are found, it invokes all of  them  and  returns.   Finally,  if  no
       events  or idle callbacks have been found, then <b>Tcl_DoOneEvent</b> sleeps until an event occurs; then it adds
       any new events to the Tcl event queue, calls handlers for the  first  event,  and  returns.   The  normal
       return value is 1 to signify that some event was processed (see below for other alternatives).

       If  the  <u>flags</u>  argument  to  <b>Tcl_DoOneEvent</b>  is  non-zero, it restricts the kinds of events that will be
       processed by <b>Tcl_DoOneEvent</b>.  <u>Flags</u> may be an OR-ed combination of any of the following bits:

       <b>TCL_WINDOW_EVENTS</b>
              Process window system events.

       <b>TCL_FILE_EVENTS</b>
              Process file events.

       <b>TCL_TIMER_EVENTS</b>
              Process timer events.

       <b>TCL_IDLE_EVENTS</b>
              Process idle callbacks.

       <b>TCL_ALL_EVENTS</b>
              Process all kinds of events:  equivalent to OR-ing together all of the above flags  or  specifying
              none of them.

       <b>TCL_DONT_WAIT</b>
              Do not sleep:  process only events that are ready at the time of the call.

       If any of the flags <b>TCL_WINDOW_EVENTS</b>, <b>TCL_FILE_EVENTS</b>, <b>TCL_TIMER_EVENTS</b>, or <b>TCL_IDLE_EVENTS</b> is set, then
       the  only  events that will be considered are those for which flags are set.  Setting none of these flags
       is equivalent to the value <b>TCL_ALL_EVENTS</b>,  which  causes  all  event  types  to  be  processed.   If  an
       application  has defined additional event sources with <b>Tcl_CreateEventSource</b>, then additional <u>flag</u> values
       may also be valid, depending on those event sources.

       The <b>TCL_DONT_WAIT</b> flag causes <b>Tcl_DoOneEvent</b> not to put the process to sleep:  it will check  for  events
       but  if  none are found then it returns immediately with a return value of 0 to indicate that no work was
       done.  <b>Tcl_DoOneEvent</b> will also return 0 without doing anything if  the  only  alternative  is  to  block
       forever  (this  can  happen,  for  example,  if  <u>flags</u> is <b>TCL_IDLE_EVENTS</b> and there are no <b>Tcl_DoWhenIdle</b>
       callbacks pending, or if no event handlers or timer handlers exist).

       <b>Tcl_DoOneEvent</b> may be invoked  recursively.   For  example,  it  is  possible  to  invoke  <b>Tcl_DoOneEvent</b>
       recursively  from  a  handler  called  by <b>Tcl_DoOneEvent</b>.  This sort of operation is useful in some modal
       situations, such as when a notification dialog has been popped up and an application wishes to  wait  for
       the user to click a button in the dialog before doing anything else.
