</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Event::RPC::Loop - Mainloop Abstraction layer for Event::RPC

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Event::RPC::Server;
         use Event::RPC::Loop::Glib;

         my $server = Event::RPC::Server-&gt;new (
             ...
             loop =&gt; Event::RPC::Loop::Glib-&gt;new(),
             ...
         );

         $server-&gt;start;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This modules defines the interface of Event::RPC's mainloop abstraction layer. It's a virtual class all
       mainloop modules should inherit from.

</pre><h4><b>INTERFACE</b></h4><pre>
       The following methods need to be implemented:

       $loop-&gt;<b>enter</b> ()
           Enter resp. start a mainloop.

       $loop-&gt;<b>leave</b> ()
           Leave the mainloop, which was started with the <b>enter()</b> method.

       $watcher = $loop-&gt;<b>add_io_watcher</b> ( %options )
           Add an I/O watcher. Options are passed as a hash of key/value pairs. The following options are known:

           <b>fh</b>  The filehandle to be watched.

           <b>cb</b>  This callback is called, without any parameters, if an event occurred on the filehandle above.

           <b>desc</b>
               A description of the watcher. Not necessarily implemented by all modules, so it may be ignored.

           <b>poll</b>
               Either 'r', if your program reads from the filehandle, or 'w' if it writes to it.

           A  watcher  object  is  returned. What this exactly is depends on the implementation, so you can't do
           anything useful with it besides passing it back to <b>del_io_watcher()</b>.

       $loop-&gt;<b>del_io_watcher</b> ( $watcher )
           Deletes an I/O watcher which was added with $loop-&gt;<b>add_io_watcher()</b>.

       $timer = $loop-&gt;<b>add_timer</b> ( %options )
           This sets a timer, a subroutine called after a specific timeout or on a regularly basis with a  fixed
           time interval.

           Options are passed as a hash of key/value pairs. The following options are known:

           <b>interval</b>
               A time interval in seconds, may be fractional.

           <b>after</b>
               Callback is called once after this amount of seconds, may be fractional.

           <b>cb</b>  The callback.

           <b>desc</b>
               A description of the timer. Not necessarily implemented by all modules, so it may be ignored.

           A  timer  object  is  returned.  What  this exactly is depends on the implementation, so you can't do
           anything useful with it besides passing it back to <b>del_io_timer()</b>.

       $loop-&gt;<b>del_timer</b> ( $timer )
           Deletes a timer which was added with $loop-&gt;<b>add_timer()</b>.

</pre><h4><b>DIRECT</b> <b>USAGE</b> <b>IN</b> <b>YOUR</b> <b>SERVER</b></h4><pre>
       You may use the methods of Event::RPC::Loop by  yourself  if  you  like.  This  way  your  program  keeps
       independent  of  the  actual  mainloop  module in use, if the simplified interface of Event::RPC::Loop is
       sufficient for you.

       In your server program you access the actual mainloop object this way:

         my $loop = Event::RPC::Server-&gt;instance-&gt;get_loop;

       Naturally  nothing  speaks  against  making  your  program  to  work  only  with  a   specific   mainloop
       implementation,  if  you need its features. In that case you may use the corresponding API directly (e.g.
       of Event or Glib), no need to access it through Event::RPC::Loop.
