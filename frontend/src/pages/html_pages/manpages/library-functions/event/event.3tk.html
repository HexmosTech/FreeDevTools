       event - Miscellaneous event facilities: define virtual events and generate events

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>event</b> <u>option</u> ?<u>arg</u> <u>...</u>?
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>event</b>  command  provides  several facilities for dealing with window system events, such as defining
       virtual events and synthesizing events.  The command has several different forms, determined by the first
       argument.  The following forms are currently supported:

       <b>event</b> <b>add</b> <b>&lt;&lt;</b><u>virtual</u><b>&gt;&gt;</b> <u>sequence</u> ?<u>sequence</u> <u>...</u>?
              Associates the virtual event <u>virtual</u> with the physical event sequence(s)  given  by  the  <u>sequence</u>
              arguments,  so  that  the  virtual  event  will  trigger whenever any one of the <u>sequence</u>s occurs.
              <u>Virtual</u> may be any string value and <u>sequence</u> may have any of the values allowed for  the  <u>sequence</u>
              argument to the <b>bind</b> command.  If <u>virtual</u> is already defined, the new physical event sequences add
              to the existing sequences for the event.

       <b>event</b> <b>delete</b> <b>&lt;&lt;</b><u>virtual</u><b>&gt;&gt;</b> ?<u>sequence</u> <u>sequence</u> <u>...</u>?
              Deletes  each  of  the  <u>sequence</u>s  from  those associated with the virtual event given by <u>virtual</u>.
              <u>Virtual</u> may be any string value and <u>sequence</u> may have any of the values allowed for  the  <u>sequence</u>
              argument  to  the  <b>bind</b> command.  Any <u>sequence</u>s not currently associated with <u>virtual</u> are ignored.
              If no <u>sequence</u> argument is provided, all physical event sequences are removed for <u>virtual</u>, so that
              the virtual event will not trigger anymore.

       <b>event</b> <b>generate</b> <u>window</u> <u>event</u> ?<u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>...</u>?
              Generates a window event and arranges for it to be processed just as  if  it  had  come  from  the
              window system.  <u>Window</u> gives the path name of the window for which the event will be generated; it
              may  also  be  an  identifier  (such as returned by <b>winfo</b> <b>id</b>) as long as it is for a window in the
              current application.  <u>Event</u> provides a basic description of the event, such as <b>&lt;Shift-Button-2&gt;</b> or
              <b>&lt;&lt;Paste&gt;&gt;</b>.  If <u>Window</u> is empty the whole screen is meant, and  coordinates  are  relative  to  the
              screen.   <u>Event</u>  may  have  any of the forms allowed for the <u>sequence</u> argument of the <b>bind</b> command
              except that it must consist of a single event pattern, not a sequence.  <u>Option-value</u> pairs may  be
              used to specify additional attributes of the event, such as the x and y mouse position;  see <b>EVENT</b>
              <b>FIELDS</b>  below.   If the <b>-when</b> option is not specified, the event is processed immediately:  all of
              the handlers for the event will complete before the <b>event</b> <b>generate</b> command returns.  If the  <b>-when</b>
              option  is  specified then it determines when the event is processed.  Certain events, such as key
              events, require that the window has focus to receive the event properly.

       <b>event</b> <b>info</b> ?<b>&lt;&lt;</b><u>virtual</u><b>&gt;&gt;</b>?
              Returns information about virtual events.  If the <b>&lt;&lt;</b><u>virtual</u><b>&gt;&gt;</b>  argument  is  omitted,  the  return
              value is a list of all the virtual events that are currently defined.  If <b>&lt;&lt;</b><u>virtual</u><b>&gt;&gt;</b> is specified
              then  the return value is a list whose elements are the physical event sequences currently defined
              for the given virtual event;  if the virtual  event  is  not  defined  then  an  empty  string  is
              returned.

              Note  that virtual events that are not bound to physical event sequences are <u>not</u> returned by <b>event</b>
              <b>info</b>.

</pre><h4><b>EVENT</b> <b>FIELDS</b></h4><pre>
       The following options are supported for  the  <b>event</b>  <b>generate</b>  command.   These  correspond  to  the  “%”
       expansions allowed in binding scripts for the <b>bind</b> command.

       <b>-above</b> <u>window</u>
              <u>Window</u>  specifies  the  <u>above</u>  field  for the event, either as a window path name or as an integer
              window id.  Valid for <b>Configure</b> events.  Corresponds to the <b>%a</b> substitution for binding scripts.

       <b>-borderwidth</b> <u>size</u>
              <u>Size</u> must be a screen distance;  it specifies the <u>border_width</u> field for  the  event.   Valid  for
              <b>Configure</b> events.  Corresponds to the <b>%B</b> substitution for binding scripts.

       <b>-button</b> <u>number</u>
              <u>Number</u>  must  be  an  integer;  it specifies the <u>detail</u> field for a <b>Button</b> or <b>ButtonRelease</b> event,
              overriding any button  number provided  in  the  base  <u>event</u>  argument.   Corresponds  to  the  <b>%b</b>
              substitution for binding scripts.

       <b>-count</b> <u>number</u>
              <u>Number</u>  must be an integer;  it specifies the <u>count</u> field for the event.  Valid for <b>Expose</b> events.
              Corresponds to the <b>%c</b> substitution for binding scripts.

       <b>-data</b> <u>string</u>
              <u>String</u> may be any value; it specifies the <u>user_data</u> field for the event.  Only valid  for  virtual
              events.  Corresponds to the <b>%d</b> substitution for virtual events in binding scripts.

       <b>-delta</b> <u>number</u>
              <u>Number</u>  must  be  an  integer;   it specifies the <u>delta</u> field for the <b>MouseWheel</b> event.  The <u>delta</u>
              refers to the direction and magnitude the mouse wheel was rotated.  Note the value is not a screen
              distance but are units of motion in the mouse wheel.  Typically these values are multiples of 120.
              For example, 120 should scroll the text widget up 4 lines and -240 would scroll  the  text  widget
              down  8  lines.   Of  course, other widgets may define different behaviors for mouse wheel motion.
              This field corresponds to the <b>%D</b> substitution for binding scripts.

       <b>-detail</b> <u>detail</u>
              <u>Detail</u> specifies the <u>detail</u> field for the event and must be one of the following:

       <b>-keysym</b> <u>name</u>
              <u>Name</u> must be the name of a valid keysym, such as <b>g</b>, <b>space</b>, or <b>Return</b>;  its  corresponding  keycode
              value  is  used  as the <u>keycode</u> field for event, overriding any detail specified in the base <u>event</u>
              argument.  Valid for <b>Key</b> and <b>KeyRelease</b> events.  Corresponds to the <b>%K</b>  substitution  for  binding
              scripts.

       <b>-mode</b> <u>notify</u>
              <u>Notify</u>  specifies  the  <u>mode</u>  field  for  the  event  and must be one of <b>NotifyNormal</b>, <b>NotifyGrab</b>,

              Corresponds to the <b>%#</b> substitution for binding scripts.

       <b>-state</b> <u>state</u>
              <u>State</u>  specifies  the  <u>state</u>  field  for  the event.  For <b>Key</b>, <b>KeyRelease</b>, <b>Buttons</b>, <b>ButtonRelease</b>,
              <b>Enter</b>, <b>Leave</b>, and <b>Motion</b> events it must be an integer value.  For <b>Visibility</b> events it must be one
              of <b>VisibilityUnobscured</b>, <b>VisibilityPartiallyObscured</b>,  or  <b>VisibilityFullyObscured</b>.   This  option
              overrides  any  modifiers such as <b>Meta</b> or <b>Control</b> specified in the base <u>event</u>.  Corresponds to the
              <b>%s</b> substitution for binding scripts.

       <b>-subwindow</b> <u>window</u>

              integer window identifier.  Valid for <b>Key</b>, <b>KeyRelease</b>, <b>Button</b>, <b>ButtonRelease</b>,  <b>Enter</b>,  <b>Leave</b>,  and
              <b>Motion</b> events.  Similar to <b>%S</b> substitution for binding scripts.

       <b>-time</b> <u>integer</u>
              <u>Integer</u>  must  be  an integer value;  it specifies the <u>time</u> field for the event. Additionally, the
              special value <b>current</b> is allowed; this value will be substituted by the current event time.  Valid
              for  <b>Key</b>,  <b>KeyRelease</b>,  <b>Button</b>,  <b>ButtonRelease</b>,  <b>Enter</b>,  <b>Leave</b>,  <b>Motion</b>,  and   <b>Property</b>   events.
              Corresponds to the <b>%t</b> substitution for binding scripts.

       <b>-when</b> <u>when</u>
              <u>When</u> determines when the event will be processed;  it must have one of the following values:

              <b>now</b>       Process  the  event  immediately,  before the command returns.  This also happens if the
                        <b>-when</b> option is omitted.

              <b>tail</b>      Place the event on  Tcl's  event  queue  behind  any  events  already  queued  for  this
                        application.

              <b>head</b>      Place the event at the front of Tcl's event queue, so that it will be handled before any
                        other events already queued.

              <b>mark</b>      Place  the  event  at the front of Tcl's event queue but behind any other events already
                        queued with <b>-when</b> <b>mark</b>.  This option is useful when generating a series of  events  that
                        should be processed in order but at the front of the queue.

       <b>-x</b> <u>coord</u>
              <u>Coord</u>  must  be  a  screen  distance;   it  specifies  the  <u>x</u> field for the event.  Valid for <b>Key</b>,
              <b>KeyRelease</b>, <b>Button</b>, <b>ButtonRelease</b>, <b>Motion</b>, <b>Enter</b>, <b>Leave</b>, <b>Expose</b>, <b>Configure</b>, <b>Gravity</b>, and  <b>Reparent</b>
              events.   Corresponds  to  the  <b>%x</b>  substitution  for  binding  scripts.   If  <u>Window</u> is empty the
              coordinate is relative to the screen, and this option  corresponds  to  the  <b>%X</b>  substitution  for
              binding scripts.

       <b>-y</b> <u>coord</u>
              <u>Coord</u>  must  be  a  screen  distance;   it  specifies  the  <u>y</u> field for the event.  Valid for <b>Key</b>,
              <b>KeyRelease</b>, <b>Button</b>, <b>ButtonRelease</b>, <b>Motion</b>, <b>Enter</b>, <b>Leave</b>, <b>Expose</b>, <b>Configure</b>, <b>Gravity</b>, and  <b>Reparent</b>
              events.   Corresponds  to  the  <b>%y</b>  substitution  for  binding  scripts.   If  <u>Window</u> is empty the
              coordinate is relative to the screen, and this option  corresponds  to  the  <b>%Y</b>  substitution  for
              binding scripts.

       Any  options  that  are  not  specified  when generating an event are filled with the value 0, except for
       <u>serial</u>, which is filled with the next X event serial number.

</pre><h4><b>PREDEFINED</b> <b>VIRTUAL</b> <b>EVENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Tk defines the following virtual events for the purposes of notification:

       <b>&lt;&lt;AltUnderlined&gt;&gt;</b>
              This is sent to widget to notify  it  that  the  letter  it  has  underlined  (as  an  accelerator
              indicator)  with the <b>-underline</b> option has been pressed in combination with the Alt key. The usual
              response to this is to either focus into the widget (or some related  widget)  or  to  invoke  the
              widget.

       <b>&lt;&lt;Invoke&gt;&gt;</b>
              This can be sent to some widgets (e.g. button, listbox, menu) as an alternative to &lt;space&gt;.

       <b>&lt;&lt;ListboxSelect&gt;&gt;</b>
              This is sent to a listbox when the set of selected item(s) in the listbox is updated.

       <b>&lt;&lt;MenuSelect&gt;&gt;</b>
              This  is  sent  to a menu when the currently selected item in the menu changes. It is intended for
              use with context-sensitive help systems.

       <b>&lt;&lt;Modified&gt;&gt;</b>
              This is sent to a text widget when the contents of the widget are changed.

       <b>&lt;&lt;Selection&gt;&gt;</b>
              This is sent to a text widget when the selection in the widget is changed.

       <b>&lt;&lt;ThemeChanged&gt;&gt;</b>
              This is sent to all widgets when the ttk theme changed. The ttk widgets listen to this  event  and
              redisplay themselves when it fires.  The legacy widgets ignore this event.

       <b>&lt;&lt;TkWorldChanged&gt;&gt;</b>
              This  event  is  sent  to  all  widgets  when  a font is changed, for example, by the use of [font
              configure].  The user_data field (%d) will have the value "FontChanged".  For  other  system  wide
              changes,  this  event will be sent to all widgets, and the user_data field will indicate the cause
              of the change.  NOTE: all tk and ttk widgets already handle this event internally.

       <b>&lt;&lt;TraverseIn&gt;&gt;</b>
              This is sent to a widget when the focus enters the widget because of a user-driven “tab to widget”
              action.

       <b>&lt;&lt;TraverseOut&gt;&gt;</b>
              This is sent to a widget when the focus leaves the widget because of a user-driven “tab to widget”
              action.

       <b>&lt;&lt;UndoStack&gt;&gt;</b>
              This is sent to a text widget when its undo stack or redo stack becomes empty or unempty.

       <b>&lt;&lt;WidgetViewSync&gt;&gt;</b>
              This is sent to a text widget when its  internal  data  become  obsolete,  and  again  when  these
              internal  data are back in sync with the widget view. The detail field (%d substitution) is either
              true (when the widget is in sync) or false (when it is not).

       Tk defines the following virtual events for the purposes of unifying bindings across multiple  platforms.
       Users expect them to behave in the following way:

       <b>&lt;&lt;Clear&gt;&gt;</b>
              Delete the currently selected widget contents.

       <b>&lt;&lt;Copy&gt;&gt;</b>
              Copy the currently selected widget contents to the clipboard.

       <b>&lt;&lt;Cut&gt;&gt;</b>
              Move the currently selected widget contents to the clipboard.

       <b>&lt;&lt;LineEnd&gt;&gt;</b>
              Move to the end of the line in the current widget while deselecting any selected contents.

       <b>&lt;&lt;LineStart&gt;&gt;</b>
              Move to the start of the line in the current widget while deselecting any selected contents.

       <b>&lt;&lt;NextChar&gt;&gt;</b>
              Move  to  the  next  item  (i.e.,  visible  character) in the current widget while deselecting any
              selected contents.

       <b>&lt;&lt;NextLine&gt;&gt;</b>
              Move to the next line in the current widget while deselecting any selected contents.

       <b>&lt;&lt;NextPara&gt;&gt;</b>
              Move to the next paragraph in the current widget while deselecting any selected contents.

       <b>&lt;&lt;NextWord&gt;&gt;</b>
              Move to the next group of items (i.e., visible word) in the current widget while  deselecting  any
              selected contents.

       <b>&lt;&lt;Paste&gt;&gt;</b>
              Replace the currently selected widget contents with the contents of the clipboard.

       <b>&lt;&lt;PasteSelection&gt;&gt;</b>
              Insert  the  contents of the selection at the mouse location. (This event has meaningful <b>%x</b> and <b>%y</b>

   <b>MAPPING</b> <b>KEYS</b> <b>TO</b> <b>VIRTUAL</b> <b>EVENTS</b>
       In order for a virtual event binding to trigger, two things must happen.  First, the virtual  event  must
       be  defined with the <b>event</b> <b>add</b> command.  Second, a binding must be created for the virtual event with the
       <b>bind</b> command.  Consider the following virtual event definitions:

              <b>event</b> <b>add</b> &lt;&lt;Paste&gt;&gt; &lt;Control-y&gt;
              <b>event</b> <b>add</b> &lt;&lt;Paste&gt;&gt; &lt;Button-2&gt;
              <b>event</b> <b>add</b> &lt;&lt;Save&gt;&gt; &lt;Control-X&gt;&lt;Control-S&gt;
              <b>event</b> <b>add</b> &lt;&lt;Save&gt;&gt; &lt;Shift-F12&gt;
              if {[tk windowingsystem] eq "aqua"} {
                  <b>event</b> <b>add</b> &lt;&lt;Save&gt;&gt; &lt;Command-s&gt;
              }

       In the <b>bind</b> command, a virtual event can be bound like any other builtin event type as follows:

              bind Entry &lt;&lt;Paste&gt;&gt; {%W insert [selection get]}

       The double angle brackets are used to specify that a virtual event is being bound.   If  the  user  types
       Control-y  or  presses button 2, or if a <b>&lt;&lt;Paste&gt;&gt;</b> virtual event is synthesized with <b>event</b> <b>generate</b>, then
       the <b>&lt;&lt;Paste&gt;&gt;</b> binding will be invoked.

       If a virtual binding has the exact same sequence as  a  separate  physical  binding,  then  the  physical
       binding will take precedence.  Consider the following example:

              <b>event</b> <b>add</b> &lt;&lt;Paste&gt;&gt; &lt;Control-y&gt; &lt;Meta-Control-y&gt;
              bind Entry &lt;Control-y&gt; {puts Control-y}
              bind Entry &lt;&lt;Paste&gt;&gt; {puts Paste}

       When  the  user  types  Control-y  the  <b>&lt;Control-y&gt;</b>  binding will be invoked, because a physical event is
       considered more specific than a virtual event, all other things being  equal.   However,  when  the  user
       types  Meta-Control-y  the  <b>&lt;&lt;Paste&gt;&gt;</b>  binding will be invoked, because the <b>Meta</b> modifier in the physical
       pattern associated with the virtual binding is more  specific  than  the  <b>&lt;Control-y</b>&gt;  sequence  for  the
       physical event.

       Bindings  on  a  virtual event may be created before the virtual event exists.  Indeed, the virtual event
       never actually needs to be defined, for instance, on platforms where the specific virtual event would  be
       meaningless or ungeneratable.

       When a definition of a virtual event changes at run time, all windows will respond immediately to the new
       definition.  Starting from the preceding example, if the following code is executed:

              bind Entry &lt;Control-y&gt; {}
              <b>event</b> <b>add</b> &lt;&lt;Paste&gt;&gt; &lt;F6&gt;

       the  behavior  will  change such in two ways.  First, the shadowed <b>&lt;&lt;Paste&gt;&gt;</b> binding will emerge.  Typing
       Control-y will no longer invoke the <b>&lt;Control-y&gt;</b> binding, but instead invoke the virtual event  <b>&lt;&lt;Paste&gt;&gt;</b>.
       Second, pressing the F6 key will now also invoke the <b>&lt;&lt;Paste&gt;&gt;</b> binding.

   <b>MOVING</b> <b>THE</b> <b>MOUSE</b> <b>POINTER</b>
       Sometimes  it  is  useful  to  be  able  to  really move the mouse pointer. For example, if you have some
       software that is capable of demonstrating directly to the user how to use the program. To  do  this,  you
       need to “warp” the mouse around by using <b>event</b> <b>generate</b>, like this:

              for {set xy 0} {$xy &lt; 200} {incr xy} {
                  <b>event</b> <b>generate</b> . &lt;Motion&gt; -x $xy -y $xy -warp 1
                  update
                  after 50
              }

       Note  that  it  is usually considered bad style to move the mouse pointer for the user because it removes
       control from them. Therefore this technique should be used  with  caution.  Also  note  that  it  is  not
       guaranteed to function on all platforms.
