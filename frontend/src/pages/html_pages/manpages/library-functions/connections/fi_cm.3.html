</pre><h4><b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>ep</u> <u>/</u> <u>pep</u>
              Fabric endpoint on which to change connection state.

       <u>fid</u> Active or passive endpoint to get/set address.

       <u>addr</u>   Buffer to address.  On a set call, the endpoint will be assigned the specified address.  On a get,
              the local address will be copied into the buffer, up to the space provided.  For connect, this pa‐
              rameter  indicates the peer address to connect to.  The address must be in the same format as that
              specified using fi_info: addr_format when the endpoint was created.

       <u>addrlen</u>
              On input, specifies size of addr buffer.  On output,  stores  number  of  bytes  written  to  addr
              buffer.

       <u>param</u>  User-specified data exchanged as part of the connection exchange.

       <u>paramlen</u>
              Size of param buffer.

       <u>info</u>   Fabric information associated with a connection request.

       <u>mc</u>     Multicast group associated with an endpoint.

       <u>flags</u>  Additional flags for controlling connection operation.

       <u>context</u>
              User context associated with the request.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Connection management functions are used to connect an connection-oriented (FI_EP_MSG) endpoint to a lis‐
       tening peer.

   <b>fi_listen</b>
       The fi_listen call indicates that the specified endpoint should be transitioned into a passive connection
       state,  allowing it to accept incoming connection requests.  Connection requests against a listening end‐
       point are reported asynchronously to the user through a bound CM event queue using the  FI_CONNREQ  event
       type.   The number of outstanding connection requests that can be queued at an endpoint is limited by the
       listening endpoint’s backlog parameter.  The backlog is initialized based on administrative configuration
       values, but may be adjusted through the fi_control call.

   <b>fi_connect</b>
       The fi_connect call initiates a connection request on a connection-oriented endpoint to  the  destination
       address.  fi_connect may only be called on an endpoint once in its lifetime.

   <b>fi_accept</b> <b>/</b> <b>fi_reject</b>
       The  fi_accept  and fi_reject calls are used on the passive (listening) side of a connection to accept or
       reject a connection request, respectively.  To accept a connection, the listening application first waits
       for a connection request event (FI_CONNREQ).  After receiving such an event, the application allocates  a
       new endpoint to accept the connection.  This endpoint must be allocated using an fi_info structure refer‐
       encing  the  handle  from this FI_CONNREQ event.  fi_accept is then invoked with the newly allocated end‐
       point.  If the listening application wishes to reject a connection request, it calls fi_reject  with  the
       listening endpoint and a reference to the connection request.

       A  successfully  accepted  connection  request  will result in the active (connecting) endpoint seeing an
       FI_CONNECTED event on its associated event queue.  A rejected or failed connection request will  generate
       an error event.  The error entry will provide additional details describing the reason for the failed at‐
       tempt.

       An FI_CONNECTED event will also be generated on the passive side for the accepting endpoint once the con‐
       nection  has  been  properly established.  The fid of the FI_CONNECTED event will be that of the endpoint
       passed to fi_accept as opposed to the listening passive endpoint.  Outbound data transfers cannot be ini‐
       tiated on a connection-oriented endpoint until an FI_CONNECTED event has been  generated.   However,  re‐
       ceive buffers may be associated with an endpoint anytime.

   <b>fi_shutdown</b>
       The  fi_shutdown call is used to gracefully disconnect an endpoint from its peer.  The flags parameter is
       reserved and must be 0.

       Outstanding operations posted to the endpoint when fi_shutdown is called will be canceled  or  discarded.
       Notification  of  canceled  operations  will  be reported by the provider to the corresponding completion
       queue(s).  Discarded operations will silently be dropped, with no completions generated.  The  choice  of
       canceling,  versus  discarding operations, is provider dependent.  However, all canceled completions will
       be written before fi_shutdown returns.

       When called, fi_shutdown does not affect completions already written to a completion queue.   Any  queued
       completions  associated  with  asynchronous operations posted to the endpoint may still be retrieved from
       the corresponding completion queue(s) after an endpoint has been shutdown.

       An FI_SHUTDOWN event will be generated for an endpoint when the remote peer  issues  a  disconnect  using
       fi_shutdown  or  abruptly  closes the endpoint.  Note that in the abrupt close case, an FI_SHUTDOWN event
       will only be generated if the peer system is reachable and a service or kernel agent on the  peer  system
       is able to notify the local endpoint that the connection has been aborted.

   <b>fi_close</b>
       Fi_close  is  used  to disassociate an endpoint from a multicast group and close all resources associated
       with the group.  Fi_close must be called on all multicast groups that an endpoint joins.

   <b>fi_setname</b>
       The fi_setname call may be used to modify or assign the address of the local endpoint.  It is conceptual‐
       ly similar to the socket bind operation.  An endpoint may be assigned an address on its creation, through
       the fi_info structure.  The fi_setname call allows an endpoint to be  created  without  being  associated
       with  a specific service (e.g., port number) and/or node (e.g., network) address, with the addressing as‐
       signed dynamically.  The format of the specified addressing data must match that  specified  through  the
       fi_info structure when the endpoint was created.

       If  no service address is specified and a service address has not yet been assigned to the endpoint, then
       the provider will allocate a service address and assign it to the endpoint.  If a node or service address
       is specified, then, upon successful completion of fi_setname, the endpoint will be assigned the given ad‐
       dressing.  If an address cannot be assigned, or the endpoint address cannot be modified,  an  appropriate
       fabric error number is returned.

   <b>fi_getname</b> <b>/</b> <b>fi_getpeer</b>
       The  fi_getname  and fi_getpeer calls may be used to retrieve the local or peer endpoint address, respec‐
       tively.  On input, the addrlen parameter should indicate the size of the addr buffer.  If the actual  ad‐
       dress  is  larger  than  what can fit into the buffer, it will be truncated and -FI_ETOOSMALL will be re‐
       turned.  On output, addrlen is set to the size of the buffer needed to store the address,  which  may  be
       larger than the input value.

       fi_getname is not guaranteed to return a valid source address until after the specified endpoint has been
       enabled  or has had an address assigned.  An endpoint may be enabled explicitly through fi_enable, or im‐
       plicitly, such as through fi_connect or fi_listen.  An address may be assigned using fi_setname.  fi_get‐
       peer is not guaranteed to return a valid peer address until an endpoint has been completely  connected  –
       an FI_CONNECTED event has been generated.

   <b>fi_join</b>
       This  call attaches an endpoint to a multicast group.  By default, the endpoint will join the group based
       on the data transfer capabilities of the endpoint.  For example, if the endpoint has been  configured  to
       both  send and receive data, then the endpoint will be able to initiate and receive transfers to and from
       the multicast group.  The fi_join flags may be used to restrict access to the multicast group, subject to
       endpoint capability limitations.

       Multicast join operations complete asynchronously.  An endpoint must be bound to an event queue prior  to
       calling  fi_join.   The  result  of  the join operation will be reported to the EQ as an FI_JOIN_COMPLETE
       event.  Applications cannot issue multicast transfers until receiving notification that the  join  opera‐
       tion  has completed.  Note that an endpoint may begin receiving messages from the multicast group as soon
       as the join completes, which can occur prior to the FI_JOIN_COMPLETE event being generated.

       Applications must call fi_close on the multicast group to disconnect the endpoint from the group.   After
       a  join  operation has completed, the fi_mc_addr call may be used to retrieve the address associated with
       the multicast group.

   <b>fi_mc_addr</b>
       Returns the fi_addr_t address associated with a multicast group.  This address must be used  when  trans‐
       mitting data to a multicast group and paired with the FI_MULTICAST operation flag.

</pre><h4><b>FLAGS</b></h4><pre>
       Except in functions noted below, flags are reserved and must be 0.

       <u>FI_SEND</u>
              Applies  to  fi_join.   This flag indicates that the endpoint should join the multicast group as a
              send only member.  The endpoint must be configured for transmit operations to use this flag, or an
              error will occur.

       <u>FI_RECV</u>
              Applies to fi_join.  This flag indicates that the endpoint should join the  multicast  group  with
              receive  permissions  only.   The  endpoint  must be configured for receive operations to use this
              flag, or an error will occur.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       Returns 0 on success.  On error, a negative value corresponding to fabric errno is returned.  Fabric  er‐
       rno values are defined in <b>rdma/fi_errno.h</b>.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       For  connection-oriented endpoints, the buffer referenced by param will be sent as part of the connection
       request or response, subject to the constraints of the underlying connection protocol.  Applications  may
       use fi_getopt with the FI_OPT_CM_DATA_SIZE endpoint option to determine the size of application data that
       may  be  exchanged as part of a connection request or response.  The fi_connect, fi_accept, and fi_reject
       calls will silently truncate any application data which cannot fit  into  underlying  protocol  messages.
       User  data  exchanged as part of the connection process is available as part of the fi_eq_cm_entry struc‐
       ture, for FI_CONNREQ and FI_CONNECTED events, or as additional err_data to fi_eq_err_entry, in  the  case
       of a rejected connection.
