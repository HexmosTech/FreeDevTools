</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       POE::Component::Connection::Keepalive - a wheel wrapper around a kept-alive socket

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 0.272

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         See the SYNOPSIS for POE::Component::Client::Keepalive for a
         complete working example.

         my $connection = $response-&gt;{connection};
         $heap-&gt;{connection} = $connection;

         $connection-&gt;start( InputEvent =&gt; "got_input" );

         delete $heap-&gt;{connection};  # When done with it.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       POE::Component::Connection::Keepalive is a helper class for POE::Component::Client::Keepalive.  It wraps
       managed sockets, providing a few extra features.

       Connection objects free their underlying sockets when they are DESTROYed.  This eliminates the need to
       explicitly free sockets when you are done with them.

       Connection objects manage POE::Wheel::ReadWrite objects internally, saving a bit of effort.

       new
         Creates  a  new  POE::Component::Connection::Keepalive  instance.   It accepts two parameters: A socket
         handle (socket) and a reference to a POE::Component::Client::Keepalive object to manage the socket when
         the connection is destroyed.

           my $conn = POE::Component::Connection::Keepalive-&gt;new(
             socket  =&gt; $socket_handle,
             manager =&gt; $poe_component_client_keepalive,
           );

         <b>new()</b> is usually called by a POE::Component::Client::Keepalive object.

       start
         Starts a POE::Wheel::ReadWrite object.  All parameters except Handle for <b>start()</b> are passed directly to
         POE::Wheel::ReadWrite's constructor.  Handle is provided by the connection object.  <b>start()</b>  returns  a
         reference  to  the  new  POE::Wheel::ReadWrite  object,  but it is not necessary to save a copy of that
         wheel.  The connection object keeps a copy of the reference internally, so the wheel  will  persist  as
         long  as  the  connection does.  The POE::Wheel::ReadWrite object will be DESTROYed when the connection
         object is.

           # Asynchronous connection from Client::Keepalive.
           sub handle_connection {
             my $connection_info = $_[ARG0];
             $_[HEAP]-&gt;{connection} = $connection_info-&gt;{connection};

             $heap-&gt;{connection}-&gt;start(
               InputEvent =&gt; "got_input",
               ErrorEvent =&gt; "got_error",
             );
           }

           # Stop the connection (and the wheel) when an error occurs.
           sub handle_error {
             delete $_[HEAP]-&gt;{connection};
           }

       wheel
         Returns a reference to the internal POE::Wheel::ReadWrite object, so that methods may  be  called  upon
         it.

           $heap-&gt;{connection}-&gt;wheel()-&gt;pause_input();

       close
         Closes the connection immediately. Calls <b>shutdown_input()</b> and <b>shutdown_output()</b> on the wheel also.
