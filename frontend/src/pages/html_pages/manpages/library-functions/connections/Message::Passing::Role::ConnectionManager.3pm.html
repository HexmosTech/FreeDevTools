</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Message::Passing::Role::ConnectionManager - A simple manager for inputs and outputs that need to make
       network connections.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This role is for components which make network connections, and need to handle the connection not
       starting, timeouts, disconnects etc.

       It provides a simple abstraction for multiple other classes to be able to use the same connection
       manager, and a notifies

</pre><h4><b>REQUIRED</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>_build_connection</b>
       Build and return the connection we're managing, start the connection process.

       Your connection should use the API as documented below to achieve notification of connect and disconnect
       events.

</pre><h4><b>API</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>CONNECTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>_set_connected</b> <b>(1)</b>
       Notify clients that the connection is now ready for use.

   <b>_set_connected</b> <b>(0)</b>
       Notify clients that the connection is no longer ready for use.

       Will cause the connection to be terminated and retried.

</pre><h4><b>API</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>CLIENTS</b></h4><pre>
       To use a connection manager, you should register yourself like this:

           $manager-&gt;subscribe_to_connect($self);

       The manager will call "$self-&gt;connected($connection)" and "$self-&gt;disconnected()" when appropriate.

       If the manager is already connected when you subscribe, it will immediately call back into your
       "connected" method, if it is not already connected then this will happen at a later point once the
       connection is established.

       See Message::Passing::Role::HasAConnection for a role to help with dealing with a connection manager.

</pre><h4><b>ATTRIBUTES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>connected</b>
       A Boolean indicating if the connection is currently considered fully connected

   <b>connection</b>
       The connection object (if we are connected, or connecting currently) - can be undefined if we are during
       a reconnect timeout.

   <b>timeout</b>
       Connections will be timed out and aborted after this time if they haven't successfully connected.

       Defaults to 30s

   <b>reconnect_after</b>
       The number of seconds to wait before starting a reconnect after a connection has timed out or been
       aborted.

       Defaults to 2s

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>subscribe_to_connect</b> <b>($subscriber)</b>
       This is called by your Input or Output, as "$self-&gt;connection_manager-&gt;subscribe_to_connect($self)".

       This is done for you by Message::Passing::Role::HasAConnection usually..

       This arranges to store a weak reference to your component, allowing the connection manager to call the
       "-&gt;connect" or "-&gt;disconnect" methods for any components registered when a connection is established or
       destroyed.

       Note that if the connection manager is already connected, it will <b>immediately</b> call the "-&gt;connect"
       method.
