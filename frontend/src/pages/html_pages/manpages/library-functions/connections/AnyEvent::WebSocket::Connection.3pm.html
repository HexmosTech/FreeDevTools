</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       AnyEvent::WebSocket::Connection - WebSocket connection for AnyEvent

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 0.55

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        # send a message through the websocket...
        $connection-&gt;send('a message');

        # receive message from the websocket...
        $connection-&gt;on(each_message =&gt; sub {
          # $connection is the same connection object
          # $message isa AnyEvent::WebSocket::Message
          my($connection, $message) = @_;
          ...
        });

        # handle a closed connection...
        $connection-&gt;on(finish =&gt; sub {
          # $connection is the same connection object
          my($connection) = @_;
          ...
        });

        # close an opened connection
        # (can do this either inside or outside of
        # a callback)
        $connection-&gt;close;

       (See AnyEvent::WebSocket::Client or AnyEvent::WebSocket::Server on how to create a connection)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This class represents a WebSocket connection with a remote server or a client.

       If the connection object falls out of scope then the connection will be closed gracefully.

       This class was created for a client to connect to a server via AnyEvent::WebSocket::Client, and was later
       extended to work on the server side via AnyEvent::WebSocket::Server.  Once a WebSocket connection is
       established, the API for both client and server is identical.

</pre><h4><b>ATTRIBUTES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>handle</b>
       The underlying AnyEvent::Handle object used for the connection.  WebSocket handshake MUST be already
       completed using this handle.  You should not use the handle directly after creating
       AnyEvent::WebSocket::Connection object.

       Usually only useful for creating server connections, see below.

   <b>masked</b>
       If set to true, it masks outgoing frames. The default is false.

   <b>subprotocol</b>
       The subprotocol returned by the server.  If no subprotocol was requested, it may be "undef".

   <b>max_payload_size</b>
       The maximum payload size for received frames.  Currently defaults to whatever Protocol::WebSocket
       defaults to.

   <b>max_fragments</b>
       The maximum number of fragments for received frames.  Currently defaults to whatever Protocol::WebSocket
       defaults to.

   <b>close_code</b>
       If provided by the other side, the code that was provided when the connection was closed.

   <b>close_reason</b>
       If provided by the other side, the reason for closing the connection.

   <b>close_error</b>
       If the connection is closed due to a network error, this will hold the message.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>send</b>
        $connection-&gt;send($message);

       Send a message to the other side.  $message may either be a string (in which case a text message will be
       sent), or an instance of AnyEvent::WebSocket::Message.

   <b>on</b>
        $connection-&gt;on(each_message =&gt; $cb);
        $connection-&gt;on(each_message =&gt; $cb);
        $connection-&gt;on(finish =&gt; $cb);

       Register a callback to a particular event.

       For each event $connection is the AnyEvent::WebSocket::Connection and and $message is an
       AnyEvent::WebSocket::Message (if available).

       Returns a coderef that unregisters the callback when invoked.

        my $cancel = $connection-&gt;on( each_message =&gt; sub { ...  });

        # later on...
        $cancel-&gt;();

       <u>each_message</u>

        $cb-&gt;($connection, $message, $unregister)

       Called each time a message is received from the WebSocket.  $unregister is a coderef that removes this
       callback from the active listeners when invoked.

       <u>next_message</u>

        $cb-&gt;($connection, $message)

       Called only for the next message received from the WebSocket.

       [0.49]

       Adding a next_message callback from within a next_message callback will result in a callback called on
       the next message instead of the current one. There was a bug in previous versions where the callback
       would be called immediately after current set of callbacks with the same message.

       <u>parse_error</u>

        $cb-&gt;($connection, $text_error_message)

       Called if there is an error parsing a message sent from the remote end.  After this callback is called,
       the connection will be closed.  Among other possible errors, this event will trigger if a frame has a
       payload which is larger that "max_payload_size".

       <u>finish</u>

        $cb-&gt;($connection, $message)

       Called when the connection is terminated.  If the connection is terminated due to an error, the message
       will be provided as the second argument.  On a cleanly closed connection this will be `undef`.

   <b>close</b>
        $connection-&gt;close;
        $connection-&gt;close($code);
        $connection-&gt;close($code, $reason);

       Close the connection.  You may optionally provide a code and a reason.  See section 5.5.1
       &lt;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455#section-5.5.1&gt; and section 7.4.1
       &lt;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455#section-7.4.1&gt; of RFC6455.

       The code is a 16-bit unsigned integer value that indicates why you close the connection. By default the
       code is 1000.

       The reason is a character string (not an octet string) that further describes why you close the
       connection. By default the reason is an empty string.

</pre><h4><b>SERVER</b> <b>CONNECTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Although written originally to work with AnyEvent::WebSocket::Client, this class was designed to be used
       for either client or server WebSocket connections.  For details, contact the author and/or take a look at
       the source for AnyEvent::WebSocket::Client and the examples that come with Protocol::WebSocket.
