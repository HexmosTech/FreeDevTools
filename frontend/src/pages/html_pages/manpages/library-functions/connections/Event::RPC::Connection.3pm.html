</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Event::RPC::Connection - Represents a RPC connection

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       Note: you never create instances of this class in your own code, it's only used internally by
       Event::RPC::Server. But you may request connection objects using the <b>connection_hook</b> of
       Event::RPC::Server and then having some read access on them.

         my $connection = Event::RPC::Server::Connection-&gt;new (
             $rpc_server, $client_socket
         );

       As well you can get the currently active connection from your Event::RPC::Server object:

         my $server     = Event::RPC::Server-&gt;instance;
         my $connection = $server-&gt;get_active_connection;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Objects of this class represents a connection from an Event::RPC::Client to an Event::RPC::Server
       instance. They live inside the server and the whole Client/Server protocol is implemented here.

</pre><h4><b>READ</b> <b>ONLY</b> <b>ATTRIBUTES</b></h4><pre>
       The following attributes may be read using the corresponding get_ATTRIBUTE accessors:

       <b>cid</b> The connection ID of this connection. A number which is unique for this server instance.

       <b>server</b>
           The Event::RPC::Server instance this connection belongs to.

       <b>is_authenticated</b>
           This  boolean  value reflects whether the connection is authenticated resp. whether the client passed
           correct credentials.

       <b>auth_user</b>
           This is the name of the user who was authenticated successfully for this connection.

       <b>client_oids</b>
           This is a hash reference of object id's which are in use by the client of this connection.  Keys  are
           the object ids, value is always 1.  You can get the corresponding objects by using the

             $connection-&gt;get_client_object($oid)

           method.

           Don't  change  anything  in this hash, in particular don't delete or add entries. Event::RPC does all
           the necessary garbage collection transparently, no need to mess with that.
