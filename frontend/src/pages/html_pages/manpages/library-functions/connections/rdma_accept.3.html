</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       rdma_accept - Called to accept a connection request.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;rdma/rdma_cma.h&gt;</b>

       <b>int</b> <b>rdma_accept</b> <b>(struct</b> <b>rdma_cm_id</b> <b>*</b><u>id</u><b>,</b> <b>struct</b> <b>rdma_conn_param</b> <b>*</b><u>conn_param</u><b>);</b>

</pre><h4><b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       id          Connection identifier associated with the request.

       conn_param  Information needed to establish the connection.  See CONNECTION PROPERTIES below for details.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Called from the listening side to accept a connection or datagram service lookup request.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       Returns  0  on  success,  or  -1 on error.  If an error occurs, errno will be set to indicate the failure
       reason.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       Unlike the socket accept routine, rdma_accept is not called on a listening  rdma_cm_id.   Instead,  after
       calling  rdma_listen,  the  user  waits  for an RDMA_CM_EVENT_CONNECT_REQUEST event to occur.  Connection
       request events give the user a newly created rdma_cm_id, similar to a new socket, but the  rdma_cm_id  is
       bound to a specific RDMA device.  rdma_accept is called on the new rdma_cm_id.

</pre><h4><b>CONNECTION</b> <b>PROPERTIES</b></h4><pre>
       The  following  properties  are  used  to  configure  the  communication  and specified by the conn_param
       parameter when  accepting  a  connection  or  datagram  communication  request.   Users  should  use  the
       rdma_conn_param values reported in the connection request event to determine appropriate values for these
       fields  when  accepting.   Users  may  reference  the  rdma_conn_param  structure in the connection event
       directly, or can reference their own structure.  If  the  rdma_conn_param  structure  from  an  event  is
       referenced, the event must not be acked until after this call returns.

       If  the  conn_param  parameter  is  NULL,  the  values reported in the connection request event are used,
       adjusted down based on local hardware restrictions.

       private_data
              References a user-controlled data buffer.  The contents of the buffer are copied and transparently
              passed to the remote side as part of the communication request.  May be NULL  if  private_data  is
              not required.

       private_data_len
              Specifies  the  size  of  the  user-controlled  data  buffer.  Note that the actual amount of data
              transferred to the remote side is transport dependent and may be larger than that requested.

       responder_resources
              The maximum number of outstanding RDMA read and atomic operations that the local side will  accept
              from  the remote side.  Applies only to RDMA_PS_TCP.  This value must be less than or equal to the
              local RDMA  device  attribute  max_qp_rd_atom,  but  preferably  greater  than  or  equal  to  the
              responder_resources value reported in the connect request event.

       initiator_depth
              The maximum number of outstanding RDMA read and atomic operations that the local side will have to
              the remote side.  Applies only to RDMA_PS_TCP.  This value must be less than or equal to the local
              RDMA  device  attribute  max_qp_init_rd_atom and the initiator_depth value reported in the connect
              request event.

       flow_control
              Specifies if hardware flow control is available.  This value is exchanged with the remote peer and
              is not used to configure the QP.  Applies only to RDMA_PS_TCP.

       retry_count
              This value is ignored.

       rnr_retry_count
              The maximum number of times that a send operation from the remote peer  should  be  retried  on  a
              connection after receiving a receiver not ready (RNR) error.  RNR errors are generated when a send
              request  arrives  before  a  buffer has been posted to receive the incoming data.  Applies only to
              RDMA_PS_TCP.

       srq    Specifies if the QP associated with the connection is using a shared receive queue.  This field is
              ignored by the library if a QP has been created on the rdma_cm_id.  Applies only to RDMA_PS_TCP.

       qp_num Specifies the QP number associated with the connection.  This field is ignored by the library if a
              QP has been created on the rdma_cm_id.

</pre><h4><b>INFINIBAND</b> <b>SPECIFIC</b></h4><pre>
       In addition to the connection properties defined above, InfiniBand QPs are configured  with  minimum  RNR
       NAK  timer and local ACK timeout values.  The minimum RNR NAK timer value is set to 0, for a delay of 655
       ms.  The local ACK timeout is calculated based on the packet lifetime  and  local  HCA  ACK  delay.   The
       packet  lifetime  is  determined  by  the  InfiniBand Subnet Administrator and is part of the route (path
       record) information obtained by the active side of the connection.  The HCA ACK delay is  a  property  of
       the locally used HCA.

       The RNR retry count is a 3-bit value.

       The length of the private data provided by the user is limited to 196 bytes for RDMA_PS_TCP, or 136 bytes
       for RDMA_PS_UDP.
