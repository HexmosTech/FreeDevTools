</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       POE::Component::Client::MPD::Connection - module handling the tcp connection with mpd

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 2.001

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module will spawn a poe session responsible for low-level communication with mpd. It is written as a
       POE::Component::Client::TCP, which is taking care of everything needed.

       Note that you're <b>not</b> supposed to use this class directly: it's one of the helper class for
       POE::Component::Client::MPD.

</pre><h4><b>ATTRIBUTES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>host</b>
       The hostname of the mpd server. Mandatory, no default.

   <b>port</b>
       The port of the mpd server. Mandatory, no default.

   <b>id</b>
       The POE session id of the peer to dialog with. Mandatory, no default.

   <b>max_retries</b>
       How much time to attempt reconnection before giving up. Defaults to 5.

   <b>retry_wait</b>
       How much time to wait (in seconds) before attempting socket reconnection. Defaults to 2.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>my</b> <b>$id</b> <b>=</b> <b>POE::Component::Client::MPD::Connection-&gt;spawn(</b> <b>\%params</b> <b>);</b>
       This method will create a POE::Component::Client::TCP session responsible for low-level communication
       with mpd.

       It will return the poe id of the session newly created.

</pre><h4><b>PUBLIC</b> <b>EVENTS</b> <b>ACCEPTED</b></h4><pre>
   <b>disconnect(</b> <b>)</b>
       Request the pococm-connection to be shutdown. This does <b>not</b> shut down the MPD server. No argument.

   <b>send(</b> <b>$message</b> <b>)</b>
       Request pococm-conn to send the $message over the wires. Note that this request is a
       POE::Component::Client::MPD::Message object properly filled up, and that the _commands() attribute should
       <b>not</b> be newline terminated.

</pre><h4><b>PUBLIC</b> <b>EVENTS</b> <b>FIRED</b></h4><pre>
       The following events are fired from the spawned session.

   <b>mpd_connected(</b> <b>$version</b> <b>)</b>
       Fired when the session is connected to a mpd server. This event isn't fired when the socket connection
       takes place, but when the session has checked that remote peer is a real mpd server. $version is the
       advertised mpd server version.

   <b>mpd_connect_error_fatal(</b> <b>$errstr</b> <b>)</b>
       Fired when the session encounters a fatal error. This happens either when the session is connected to a
       server which happens to be something else than a mpd server, or if there was more than "max_retries" (see
       spawn() params) connection retries in a row. $errstr will contain the problem encountered. No retries
       will be done.

   <b>mpd_connect_error_retriable(</b> <b>$errstr</b> <b>)</b>
       Fired when the session has troubles connecting to the server. $errstr will point the faulty syscall that
       failed. Re-connection will be tried after $retry_wait seconds (see spawn() params).

   <b>mpd_data(</b> <b>$msg</b> <b>)</b>
       Fired when $msg has been sent over the wires, and mpd server has answered with success. The actual output
       should be looked up in "$msg-"_data&gt;.

   <b>mpd_disconnected(</b> <b>)</b>
       Fired when the socket has been disconnected for whatever reason. Note that this event is <b>not</b> fired in the
       case of a programmed shutdown (see disconnect() event above). A reconnection will be automatically re-
       tried after $retry_wait (see spawn() params).

   <b>mpd_error(</b> <b>$msg,</b> <b>$errstr</b> <b>)</b>
       Fired when $msg has been sent over the wires, and mpd server has answered with the error message $errstr.
