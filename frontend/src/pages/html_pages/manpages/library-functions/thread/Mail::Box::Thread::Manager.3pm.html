       Mail::Box::Thread::Manager - maintain threads within a set of folders

</pre><h4><b>INHERITANCE</b></h4><pre>
        Mail::Box::Thread::Manager
          is a Mail::Reporter

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        my $mgr     = Mail::Box::Manager-&gt;new;
        my $folder  = $mgr-&gt;open(folder =&gt; '/tmp/inbox');

        my $threads = $mgr-&gt;threads();
        $threads-&gt;includeFolder($folder);

        my $threads = $msg-&gt;threads(folder =&gt; $folder);

        foreach my $thread ($threads-&gt;all) {
            $thread-&gt;print;
        }

        $threads-&gt;removeFolder($folder);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       A (message-)<u>thread</u> is a message with links to messages which followed in reply of that message.  And then
       the messages with replied to the messages, which replied the original message.  And so on.  Some threads
       are only one message long (never replied to), some threads are very long.

       The "Mail::Box::Thread::Manager" is very powerful.  Not only is it able to do a descent job on MH-like
       folders (makes a trade-off between perfection and speed), it also can maintain threads from messages
       residing in different opened folders.  Both facilities are rare for mail-agents.  The manager creates
       flexible trees with Mail::Box::Thread::Node objects.

       Mail::Box::Thread::Manager-&gt;<b>new</b>(%options)
           A  "Mail::Box::Thread::Manager"  object  is usually created by a Mail::Box::Manager.  One manager can
           produce more than one of these objects.  One thread manager  can  combine  messages  from  a  set  of
           folders, which may be partially overlapping with other objects of the same type.

             window                        10

           dummy_type =&gt; CLASS
             The type of dummy messages.  Dummy messages are used to fill holes in detected threads: referred to
             by messages found in the folder, but itself not in the folder.

           folder =&gt; FOLDER | REF-ARRAY-FOLDERS
             Specifies  which  folders  are  to  be  covered  by  the threads.  You can specify one or more open
             folders.  When you close a folder, the manager will  automatically  remove  the  messages  of  that
             folder from your threads.

           folders =&gt; FOLDER | REF-ARRAY-FOLDERS
             Equivalent to the "folder" option.

           log =&gt; LEVEL
           thread_body =&gt; BOOLEAN
             May  thread-detection  be  based  on  the  content  of  a  message?  This has a serious performance
             implication when there are many messages without "In-Reply-To"  and  "References"  headers  in  the
             folder, because it will cause many messages to be parsed. NOT IMPLEMENTED YET.

           thread_type =&gt; CLASS
             Type of the thread nodes.

           timespan =&gt; TIME | 'EVER'
             Specify  how  fast threads usually work: the amount of time between an answer and a reply.  This is
             used in combination with the "window" option to determine when to  give-up  filling  the  holes  in
             threads.

             See  <b>Mail::Box::timespan2seconds()</b>  for  the  possibilities  for TIME.  With 'EVER', the search for
             messages in a thread will only be limited by the window-size.

           trace =&gt; LEVEL
           window =&gt; INTEGER|'ALL'
             The thread-window describes how many messages should be checked  at  maximum  to  fill  `holes'  in
             threads for folder which use delay-loading of message headers.

             The  constant  'ALL'  will  cause  thread-detection  not to stop trying to fill holes, but continue
             looking until the first message of the folder is reached.  Gives the best quality results, but  may
             perform bad.

           example:

            use Mail::Box::Manager;
            my $mgr     = Mail::Box::Manager-&gt;new;
            my $inbox   = $mgr-&gt;open(folder =&gt; $ENV{MAIL});
            my $read    = $mgr-&gt;open(folder =&gt; 'Mail/read');
            my $threads = $mgr-&gt;threads(folders =&gt; [$inbox, $read]);

            # longer alternative for last line:
            my $threads = $mgr-&gt;threads;
            $threads-&gt;includeFolder($inbox);
            $threads-&gt;includeFolder($read);

   <b>Grouping</b> <b>Folders</b>
       $obj-&gt;<b>folders</b>()
           Returns the folders as managed by this threader.

       $obj-&gt;<b>includeFolder</b>($folders)
           Add one or more folders to the list of folders whose messages are organized in the threads maintained
           by this object.  Duplicated inclusions will not cause any problems.

           From  the  folders,  the  messages  which  have  their  header lines parsed (see Mail::Box about lazy
           extracting) will be immediately scanned.  Messages of which the header is known only later will  have
           to report this (see <b>toBeThreaded()</b>).

           example:

            $threads-&gt;includeFolder($inbox, $draft);

       $obj-&gt;<b>removeFolder</b>($folders)
           Remove  one  or  more  folders  from  the list of folders whose messages are organized in the threads
           maintained by this object.

           example:

            $threads-&gt;removeFolder($draft);

   <b>The</b> <b>Threads</b>
       $obj-&gt;<b>all</b>()
           Returns all messages which start a thread.  The list may contain dummy messages  and  messages  which
           are scheduled for deletion.

           To  be  able to return all threads, thread construction on each message is performed first, which may
           be slow for some folder-types because is will enforce parsing of message-bodies.

       $obj-&gt;<b>known</b>()
           Returns the list of all messages which are known to be the start of  a  thread.   Threads  containing
           messages  which  where not read from their folder (like often happens MH-folder messages) are not yet
           known, and hence will not be returned.

           The list may contain dummy messages, and messages which are  scheduled  for  deletion.   Threads  are
           detected based on explicitly calling <b>inThread()</b> and <b>thread()</b> with a messages from the folder.

           Be  warned  that,  each time a message's header is read from the folder, the return of the method can
           change.

       $obj-&gt;<b>sortedAll</b>( [$prepare, [$compare]] )
           Returns <b>all()</b> the threads by default, but sorted on timestamp.

       $obj-&gt;<b>sortedKnown</b>( [$prepare, [$compare]] )
           Returns all <b>known()</b> threads, in sorted order.  By default, the threads will be sorted  on  timestamp,
           But a different $compare method can be specified.

       $obj-&gt;<b>thread</b>($message)
           Returns  the  thread  where this $message is the start of.  However, there is a possibility that this
           message is a reply itself.

           Usually, all messages which are in reply of this message are dated later than the specified one.  All
           headers of messages later than this one are getting parsed first, for each folder  in  this  threads-
           object.

           example:

            my $threads = $mgr-&gt;threads(folder =&gt; $inbox);
            my $thread  = $threads-&gt;thread($inbox-&gt;<a href="../man3/message.3.html">message</a>(3));
            print $thread-&gt;string;

       $obj-&gt;<b>threadStart</b>($message)
           Based  on  a  message, and facts from previously detected threads, try to build solid knowledge about
           the thread where this message is in.

   <b>Internals</b>
       $obj-&gt;<b>createDummy</b>($message_id)
           Get a replacement message to be used in threads.  Be warned that a dummy  is  not  a  member  of  any
           folder,  so  the  program  working with threads must test with <b>Mail::Message::isDummy()</b> before trying
           things only available to real messages.

       $obj-&gt;<b>inThread</b>($message)
           Collect the thread-information of one message.  The `In-Reply-To' and `Reference'  header-fields  are
           processed.   If  this  method  is called on a message whose header was not read yet (as usual for MH-
           folders, for instance) the reading of that header will be triggered here.

       $obj-&gt;<b>outThread</b>($message)
           Remove the message from the thread-infrastructure.  A message is replaced by a dummy.

       $obj-&gt;<b>toBeThreaded</b>($folder, @messages)
           Include the specified messages in/from the  threads  managed  by  this  object,  if  this  folder  is
           maintained by this thread-manager.

       $obj-&gt;<b>toBeUnthreaded</b>($folder, @messages)
           Remove  the  specified  @messages  in/from  the  threads  managed  by  this object, if this folder is
           maintained by this thread-manager.

</pre><h4><b>DETAILS</b></h4><pre>
       This module implements thread-detection on a folder.  Messages created by the better mailers will include
       "In-Reply-To" and "References" lines, which are used to figure out how  messages  are  related.   If  you
       prefer  a  better  thread  detection,  they are implementable, but there may be a serious performance hit
       (depends on the type of folder used).

   <b>Maintaining</b> <b>threads</b>
       A    "Mail::Box::Thread::Manager"    object    is    created    by    the    Mail::Box::Manager,    using
       <b>Mail::Box::Manager::threads()</b>.   Each  object can monitor the thread-relations between messages in one or
       more folders.  When more than one folder is specified, the messages are merged while reading the threads,
       although nothing changes in  the  folder-structure.   Adding  and  removing  folders  which  have  to  be
       maintained is permitted at any moment, although may be quite costly in performance.

       An  example of the maintained structure is shown below.  The Mail::Box::Manager has two open folders, and
       a thread-builder which monitors them both.  The combined folders have two threads, the second is two long
       (msg3 is a reply on msg2).  Msg2 is in two folders at once.

               |       `-----msg2-'/        /
               |                  /        /
               `-----folder2     /        /
                       |        /        /
                       `-----msg2       /
                       `-----msg3------'

   <b>Delayed</b> <b>thread</b> <b>detection</b>
       With <b>all()</b> you get the start-messages of each thread of this folder.  When that message was not found  in
       the  folder  (not  saved  or  already  removed),  you  get  a  message  of  the dummy-type.  These thread
       descriptions are in perfect state: all messages of the folder are included somewhere,  and  each  missing
       message of the threads (<u>holes</u>) are filled by dummies.

       However,  to  be  able to detect all threads it is required to have the headers of all messages, which is
       very slow for some types of folders, especially MH and IMAP folders.

       For interactive mail-readers, it is preferred to detect  threads  only  on  messages  which  are  in  the
       viewport  of  the user.  This may be sloppy in some situations, but everything is preferable over reading
       an MH mailbox with 10k e-mails to read only the see most recent messages.

       In this object, we take special care not to cause unnecessary parsing  (loading)  of  messages.   Threads
       will only be detected on command, and by default only the message headers are used.

       The following reports the Mail::Box::Thread::Node which is related to a message:

        my $thread = $message-&gt;thread;

       When  the message was not put in a thread yet, it is done now.  But, more work is done to return the best
       thread.  Based on various parameters, which where specified when the folder was created, the method walks
       through the folder to fill the holes which are in this thread.

       Walking from back to front (recently arrived messages are usually in the back  of  the  folder),  message
       after message are triggered to be included in their thread.  At a certain moment, the whole thread of the
       requested  method  is found, a certain maximum number of messages was tried, but that didn't help (search
       window bound reached), or the messages within the folder  are  getting  too  old.   Then  the  search  to
       complete the thread will end, although more messages of them might have been in the folder: we don't scan
       the whole folder for performance reasons.

       Finally,  for  each  message  where the head is known, for instance for all messages in mbox-folders, the
       correct thread is determined immediately.  Also, all messages  where  the  head  get  loaded  later,  are
       automatically included.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       Error: Package $package does not implement $method.
           Fatal  error:  the specific package (or one of its superclasses) does not implement this method where
           it should. This message means that some other related classes do implement this  method  however  the
           class  at  hand does not.  Probably you should investigate this and probably inform the author of the
           package.
