</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       SDL_CreateThreadWithProperties - Create a new thread with with the specified properties.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;SDL3/SDL_thread.h&gt;</b>

       <b>SDL_Thread</b> <b>*</b> <b>SDL_CreateThreadWithProperties(SDL_PropertiesID</b> <b>props);</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       These are the supported properties:

       •  <b>SDL_PROP_THREAD_CREATE_ENTRY_FUNCTION_POINTER</b>:  an <b>SDL_ThreadFunction</b> value that will be called at the
       start of the new thread's life. Required.

       • <b>SDL_PROP_THREAD_CREATE_NAME_STRING</b>: the name of the new thread, which might be available to  debuggers.
       Optional, defaults to NULL.

       • <b>SDL_PROP_THREAD_CREATE_USERDATA_POINTER</b>: an arbitrary app-defined pointer, which is passed to the entry
       function on the new thread, as its only parameter. Optional, defaults to NULL.

       •  <b>SDL_PROP_THREAD_CREATE_STACKSIZE_NUMBER</b>:  the  size,  in  bytes,  of the new thread's stack. Optional,
       defaults to 0 (system-defined default).

       SDL makes an attempt to report <b>SDL_PROP_THREAD_CREATE_NAME_STRING</b> to the system, so  that  debuggers  can
       display it. Not all platforms support this.

       Thread  naming  is a little complicated: Most systems have very small limits for the string length (Haiku
       has 32 bytes, Linux currently has 16, Visual C++ 6.0 has _nine_!), and possibly  other  arbitrary  rules.
       You'll  have  to  see  what  happens with your system's debugger. The name should be UTF-8 (but using the
       naming limits of C identifiers is a better bet). There are no requirements for thread naming conventions,
       so long as the string is null-terminated UTF-8, but these guidelines are helpful in choosing a name:

       https://stackoverflow.com/questions/149932/naming-conventions-for-threads

       If a system imposes requirements, SDL will try to munge the  string  for  it  (truncate,  etc),  but  the
       original string contents will be available from <b>SDL_GetThreadName</b>().

       The size (in bytes) of the new stack can be specified with <b>SDL_PROP_THREAD_CREATE_STACKSIZE_NUMBER</b>.  Zero
       means  "use  the  system  default" which might be wildly different between platforms. x86 Linux generally
       defaults to eight megabytes, an embedded device might be a few kilobytes instead. You generally  need  to
       specify  a  stack  that  is a multiple of the system's page size (in many cases, this is 4 kilobytes, but
       check your system documentation).

       Note that this "function" is actually a macro that calls an internal function with two  extra  parameters
       not listed here; they are hidden through preprocessor macros and are needed to support various C runtimes
       at  the  point  of the function call. Language bindings that aren't using the C headers will need to deal
       with this.

       The actual symbol in SDL is <b>SDL_CreateThreadWithPropertiesRuntime</b>, so  there  is  no  symbol  clash,  but
       trying to load an SDL shared library and look for "<b>SDL_CreateThreadWithProperties</b>" will fail.

       Usually,  apps  should just call this function the same way on every platform and let the macros hide the
       details.

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTION</b> <b>PARAMETERS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>props</u>  the properties to use.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       Returns an opaque pointer to the new thread object on success, NULL  if  the  new  thread  could  not  be
       created; call <b>SDL_GetError</b>() for more information.

</pre><h4><b>AVAILABILITY</b></h4><pre>
       This function is available since SDL 3.2.0.
