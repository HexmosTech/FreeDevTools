</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       pthread_setschedprio — dynamic thread scheduling parameters access (<b>REALTIME</b> <b>THREADS</b>)

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/pthread.h">pthread.h</a>&gt;

       int pthread_setschedprio(pthread_t <u>thread</u>, int <u>prio</u>);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>pthread_setschedprio</u>()  function shall set the scheduling priority for the thread whose thread ID is
       given by <u>thread</u> to the value given by <u>prio</u>.  See <u>Scheduling</u>  <u>Policies</u>  for  a  description  on  how  this
       function call affects the ordering of the thread in the thread list for its new priority.

       If  the  <u>pthread_setschedprio</u>() function fails, the scheduling priority of the target thread shall not be
       changed.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       If successful, the <u>pthread_setschedprio</u>() function shall return zero; otherwise, an error number shall be
       returned to indicate the error.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>pthread_setschedprio</u>() function may fail if:

       <b>EINVAL</b> The value of <u>prio</u> is invalid for the scheduling policy of the specified thread.

       <b>EPERM</b>  The caller does not have appropriate privileges to set the scheduling priority  of  the  specified
              thread.

       The <u>pthread_setschedprio</u>() function shall not return an error code of <b>[EINTR]</b>.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>pthread_setschedprio</u>()  function provides a way for an application to temporarily raise its priority
       and then lower it again, without having the undesired side-effect of yielding to  other  threads  of  the
       same  priority.  This  is  necessary  if  the application is to implement its own strategies for bounding
       priority inversion, such as priority inheritance or priority  ceilings.  This  capability  is  especially
       important  if  the  implementation  does  not  support  the Thread Priority Protection or Thread Priority
       Inheritance options, but even if those options are supported it is needed if the application is to  bound
       priority inheritance for other resources, such as semaphores.

       The  standard  developers considered that while it might be preferable conceptually to solve this problem
       by modifying the specification of <u>pthread_setschedparam</u>(), it was too late to  make  such  a  change,  as
       there may be implementations that would need to be changed. Therefore, this new function was introduced.

       If an implementation detects use of a thread ID after the end of its lifetime, it is recommended that the
       function should fail and report an <b>[ESRCH]</b> error.

</pre><h4><b>FUTURE</b> <b>DIRECTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       None.
