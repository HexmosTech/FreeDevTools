       SDL_DetachThread - Let a thread clean up on exit without intervention.

</pre><h4><b>HEADER</b> <b>FILE</b></h4><pre>
       Defined in SDL3/SDL_thread.h

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>#include</b> <b>"SDL3/SDL.h"</b>

       <b>void</b> <b>SDL_DetachThread(SDL_Thread</b> <b>*thread);</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       A  thread  may  be  "detached"  to  signify  that  it  should  not remain until another thread has called
       <b>SDL_WaitThread</b> () on it.  Detaching a thread is useful for long-running threads  that  nothing  needs  to
       synchronize with or further manage. When a detached thread is done, it simply goes away.

       There  is  no  way  to  recover  the return code of a detached thread. If you need this, don't detach the
       thread and instead use

       <b>SDL_WaitThread</b> ().

       Once a thread is detached, you should usually assume the

       <b>SDL_Thread</b>
        isn't safe to reference again, as it will become invalid immediately upon the  detached  thread's  exit,
       instead  of  remaining  until someone has called <b>SDL_WaitThread</b> () to finally clean it up. As such, don't
       detach the same thread more than once.

       If a thread has already exited when passed to

       <b>SDL_DetachThread</b> (), it will stop waiting for a call to

       <b>SDL_WaitThread</b> () and clean up immediately. It is not safe to detach a thread that might be used with

       <b>SDL_WaitThread</b> ().

       You may not call <b>SDL_WaitThread</b> () on a thread that has been detached. Use either that function  or  this
       one, but not both, or behavior is undefined.

       It is safe to pass NULL to this function; it is a no-op.

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTION</b> <b>PARAMETERS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>thread</u> the <b>SDL_Thread</b>
               pointer that was returned from the <b>SDL_CreateThread</b> () call that started this thread.

</pre><h4><b>AVAILABILITY</b></h4><pre>
       This function is available since SDL 3.2.0.
