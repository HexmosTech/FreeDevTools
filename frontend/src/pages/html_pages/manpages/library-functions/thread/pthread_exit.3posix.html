</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       pthread_exit — thread termination

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/pthread.h">pthread.h</a>&gt;

       void pthread_exit(void *<u>value_ptr</u>);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>pthread_exit</u>() function shall terminate the calling thread and make the value <u>value_ptr</u> available to
       any successful join with the terminating thread. Any cancellation cleanup handlers that have been  pushed
       and  not  yet  popped shall be popped in the reverse order that they were pushed and then executed. After
       all cancellation cleanup handlers have been  executed,  if  the  thread  has  any  thread-specific  data,
       appropriate  destructor  functions  shall  be called in an unspecified order. Thread termination does not
       release any application visible process resources, including,  but  not  limited  to,  mutexes  and  file
       descriptors,  nor  does  it  perform  any  process-level  cleanup actions, including, but not limited to,
       calling any <u>atexit</u>() routines that may exist.

       An implicit call to <u>pthread_exit</u>() is made when a thread other than the thread in which <u>main</u>() was  first
       invoked  returns  from  the  start  routine that was used to create it. The function's return value shall
       serve as the thread's exit status.

       The behavior of <u>pthread_exit</u>() is undefined if called from a cancellation cleanup handler  or  destructor
       function that was invoked as a result of either an implicit or explicit call to <u>pthread_exit</u>().

       After a thread has terminated, the result of access to local (auto) variables of the thread is undefined.
       Thus,  references  to  local  variables  of  the exiting thread should not be used for the <u>pthread_exit</u>()
       <u>value_ptr</u> parameter value.

       The process shall exit with an exit status of 0 after the last thread has been terminated.  The  behavior
       shall be as if the implementation called <u>exit</u>() with a zero argument at thread termination time.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>pthread_exit</u>() function cannot return to its caller.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       No errors are defined.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       The normal mechanism by which a thread terminates is to return from the routine that was specified in the
       <u>pthread_create</u>()  call  that started it. The <u>pthread_exit</u>() function provides the capability for a thread
       to terminate without requiring a return from the start  routine  of  that  thread,  thereby  providing  a
       function analogous to <u>exit</u>().

       Regardless  of  the method of thread termination, any cancellation cleanup handlers that have been pushed
       and not yet popped are executed, and the destructors for any existing thread-specific data are  executed.
       This  volume  of  POSIX.1‐2017 requires that cancellation cleanup handlers be popped and called in order.
       After all cancellation cleanup handlers have been executed, thread-specific data destructors are  called,
       in  an  unspecified order, for each item of thread-specific data that exists in the thread. This ordering
       is necessary because cancellation cleanup handlers may rely on thread-specific data.

       As the meaning of the status is determined by the application (except when the thread has been  canceled,
       in  which  case  it is PTHREAD_CANCELED), the implementation has no idea what an illegal status value is,
       which is why no address error checking is done.

</pre><h4><b>FUTURE</b> <b>DIRECTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       None.
