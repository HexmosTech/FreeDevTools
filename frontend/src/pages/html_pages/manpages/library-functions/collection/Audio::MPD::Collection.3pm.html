</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Audio::MPD::Collection - class to query MPD's collection

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 2.004

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           my @songs = $mpd-&gt;collection-&gt;all_songs;
           # and lots of other methods

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Audio::MPD::Collection is a class meant to access &amp; query MPD's collection. You will be able to use those
       high-level methods instead of using the low-level methods provided by mpd itself.

       Note that you're not supposed to call the constructor yourself, an Audio::MPD::Collection is
       automatically created for you during the creation of an Audio::MPD object - it can then be used with the
       "collection()" accessor.
