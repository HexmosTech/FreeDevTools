       CGI::Application::Plugin::Redirect - Easy external redirects in CGI::Application

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        package My::App;

        use CGI::Application::Plugin::Redirect;

        sub cgiapp_prerun {
            my $self = shift;

            if ( &lt;&lt; not logged in &gt;&gt; ) {
                return $self-&gt;redirect('login.html');
            }
        }

        sub byebye {
            my $self = shift;

            return $self-&gt;redirect('<a href="http://www.example.com/">http://www.example.com/</a>', '301 Moved Permanently');
        }

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This plugin provides an easy way to do external redirects in CGI::Application.  You don't have to worry
       about setting headers or worrying about return types, as that is all handled for you.

       "redirect" does an external redirect, which means that the browser will receive a command to load a new
       page, and a fresh request will come in.  If you just want to display the results of another runmode
       within the same module, then it is often sufficient to use the "forward" method in
       CGI::Application::Plugin::Forward instead.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>redirect($url,</b> <b>$status)</b>
       Interrupt the current request, and redirect to an external URL.  If you happen to be inside a prerun
       method when you call this, the current runmode will automatically be short circuited so that it will not
       execute.  As soon as all prerun method have finished, the redirect will happen without the runmode being
       executed.

       The $status parameter is optional as the CGI module will default to something suitable.

         return $self-&gt;redirect('<a href="http://www.example.com/">http://www.example.com/</a>');

         - or -

         return $self-&gt;redirect('<a href="http://www.example.com/">http://www.example.com/</a>', '301 Moved Permanently');
