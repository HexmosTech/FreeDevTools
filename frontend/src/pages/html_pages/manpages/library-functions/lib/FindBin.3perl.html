       FindBin - Locate directory of original Perl script

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        use FindBin;
        use lib "$FindBin::Bin/..<a href="file:/lib">/lib</a>";

        use FindBin qw($Bin);
        use lib "$Bin/..<a href="file:/lib">/lib</a>";

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Locates the full path to the script bin directory to allow the use of paths relative to the bin
       directory.

       This allows a user to setup a directory tree for some software with directories "&lt;root&gt;<a href="file:/bin">/bin</a>" and
       "&lt;root&gt;<a href="file:/lib">/lib</a>", and then the above example will allow the use of modules in the lib directory without
       knowing where the software tree is installed.

       If "perl" is invoked using the "-e" option or the Perl script is read from "STDIN", then "FindBin" sets
       both $Bin and $RealBin to the current directory.

</pre><h4><b>EXPORTABLE</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       $Bin or $Dir
           Path to the bin <b>directory</b> from where script was invoked

       $Script
           <b>Basename</b> of the script from which "perl" was invoked

       $RealBin or $RealDir
           $Bin with all links resolved

       $RealScript
           $Script with all links resolved

       You can also use the "ALL" tag to export all of the above variables together:

         use FindBin ':ALL';

</pre><h4><b>KNOWN</b> <b>ISSUES</b></h4><pre>
       If  there  are  two  modules  using "FindBin" from different directories under the same interpreter, this
       won't work. Since "FindBin" uses a "BEGIN" block, it'll be executed only once, and only the first  caller
       will  get  it right. This is a problem under "mod_perl" and other persistent Perl environments, where you
       shouldn't use this module. Which also means that you should avoid using "FindBin"  in  modules  that  you
       plan to put on CPAN. Call the "again" function to make sure that "FindBin" will work:

         use FindBin;
         FindBin::again(); # or FindBin-&gt;again;

       In  former  versions of "FindBin" there was no "again" function.  The workaround was to force the "BEGIN"
       block to be executed again:

         delete $INC{'FindBin.pm'};
         require FindBin;

</pre><h4><b>AUTHORS</b></h4><pre>
       "FindBin"  is  supported  as  part  of  the  core  perl  distribution.   Please  submit  bug  reports  at
       &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues&gt;.
