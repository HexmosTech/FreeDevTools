</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       local::lib - create and use a local lib/ for perl modules with PERL5LIB

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       In code -

         use local::lib; # sets up a local lib at <a href="file:~/perl5">~/perl5</a>

         use local::lib '<a href="file:~/foo">~/foo</a>'; # same, but <a href="file:~/foo">~/foo</a>

         # Or...
         use FindBin;
         use local::lib "$FindBin::Bin/../support";  # app-local support library

       From the shell -

         # Install LWP and its missing dependencies to the '<a href="file:~/perl5">~/perl5</a>' directory
         perl -MCPAN -Mlocal::lib -e 'CPAN::install(LWP)'

         # Just print out useful shell commands
         $ perl -Mlocal::lib
         PERL_MB_OPT='--install_base /home/username/perl5'; export PERL_MB_OPT;
         PERL_MM_OPT='INSTALL_BASE=/home/username/perl5'; export PERL_MM_OPT;
         PERL5LIB="/home/username/perl5/lib/perl5"; export PERL5LIB;
         PATH="/home/username/perl5/bin:$PATH"; export PATH;
         PERL_LOCAL_LIB_ROOT="/home/usename/perl5:$PERL_LOCAL_LIB_ROOT"; export PERL_LOCAL_LIB_ROOT;

       From a <u>.bash_profile</u> or <u>.bashrc</u> file -

         eval "$(perl -I$HOME/perl5/lib/perl5 -Mlocal::lib)"

   <b>The</b> <b>bootstrapping</b> <b>technique</b>
       A typical way to install local::lib is using what is known as the "bootstrapping" technique.  You would
       do this if your system administrator hasn't already installed local::lib.  In this case, you'll need to
       install local::lib in your home directory.

       Even if you do have administrative privileges, you will still want to set up your environment variables,
       as discussed in step 4. Without this, you would still install the modules into the system CPAN
       installation and also your Perl scripts will not use the lib/ path you bootstrapped with local::lib.

       By default local::lib installs itself and the CPAN modules into <a href="file:~/perl5.">~/perl5.</a>

       Windows users must also see "Differences when using this module under Win32".

       1.  Download  and  unpack  the local::lib tarball from CPAN (search for "Download" on the CPAN page about
           local::lib).  Do this as an ordinary user, not as root or administrator.  Unpack  the  file  in  your
           home directory or in any other convenient location.

       2.  Run this:

             perl Makefile.PL --bootstrap

           If  the  system  asks  you  whether  it should automatically configure as much as possible, you would
           typically answer yes.

       3.  Run this: (local::lib assumes you have make installed on your system)

             make test &amp;&amp; make install

       4.  Now we need to setup the appropriate environment variables, so  that  Perl  starts  using  our  newly
           generated  lib/ directory. If you are using bash or any other Bourne shells, you can add this to your
           shell startup script this way:

             echo 'eval "$(perl -I$HOME/perl5/lib/perl5 -Mlocal::lib)"' &gt;&gt;<a href="file:~/.bashrc">~/.bashrc</a>

           If you are using C shell, you can do this as follows:

             % echo $SHELL
             /bin/csh
             $ echo 'eval `perl -I$HOME/perl5/lib/perl5 -Mlocal::lib`' &gt;&gt; <a href="file:~/.cshrc">~/.cshrc</a>

           After writing your shell configuration file, be sure to re-read it to get the changed  settings  into
           your  current  shell's  environment.  Bourne  shells use ". <a href="file:~/.bashrc">~/.bashrc</a>" for this, whereas C shells use
           "source <a href="file:~/.cshrc">~/.cshrc</a>".

       <u>Bootstrapping</u> <u>into</u> <u>an</u> <u>alternate</u> <u>directory</u>

       In order to install local::lib into a directory other than the default, you need to specify the  name  of
       the  directory  when  you call bootstrap.  Then, when setting up the environment variables, both perl and
       local::lib must be told the location of the  bootstrap  directory.   The  setup  process  would  look  as
       follows:

         perl Makefile.PL --bootstrap=<a href="file:~/foo">~/foo</a>
         make test &amp;&amp; make install
         echo 'eval "$(perl -I$HOME/foo/lib/perl5 -Mlocal::lib=$HOME/foo)"' &gt;&gt;<a href="file:~/.bashrc">~/.bashrc</a>
         . <a href="file:~/.bashrc">~/.bashrc</a>

       <u>Other</u> <u>bootstrapping</u> <u>options</u>

       If  you're  on a slower machine, or are operating under draconian disk space limitations, you can disable
       the automatic generation of manpages from POD  when  installing  modules  by  using  the  "--no-manpages"
       argument when bootstrapping:

         perl Makefile.PL --bootstrap --no-manpages

       To avoid doing several bootstrap for several Perl module environments on the same account, for example if
       you  use  it  for  several  different  deployed  applications independently, you can use one bootstrapped
       local::lib installation to install modules in different directories directly this way:

         cd <a href="file:~/mydir1">~/mydir1</a>
         perl -Mlocal::lib=./
         eval $(perl -Mlocal::lib=./)  ### To set the environment for this shell alone
         printenv                      ### You will see that <a href="file:~/mydir1">~/mydir1</a> is in the PERL5LIB
         perl -MCPAN -e install ...    ### whatever modules you want
         cd ../mydir2
         ... REPEAT ...

       If you use <u>.bashrc</u> to activate a local::lib automatically, the local::lib will be re-enabled in any  sub-
       shells  used,  overriding  adjustments  you  may  have  made in the parent shell.  To avoid this, you can
       initialize the local::lib in <u>.bash_profile</u> rather than <u>.bashrc</u>, or protect the local::lib invocation with
       a $SHLVL check:

         [ $SHLVL -eq 1 ] &amp;&amp; eval "$(perl -I$HOME/perl5/lib/perl5 -Mlocal::lib)"

       If you are working with several "local::lib" environments, you may want to remove some of them  from  the
       current  environment  without disturbing the others.  You can deactivate one environment like this (using
       bourne sh):

         eval $(perl -Mlocal::lib=--deactivate,<a href="file:~/path">~/path</a>)

       which will generate and run the commands needed to  remove  "<a href="file:~/path">~/path</a>"  from  your  various  search  paths.
       Whichever  environment  was <b>activated</b> <b>most</b> <b>recently</b> will remain the target for module installations. That
       is, if you activate "<a href="file:~/path_A">~/path_A</a>" and then you activate "<a href="file:~/path_B">~/path_B</a>", new  modules  you  install  will  go  in
       "<a href="file:~/path_B">~/path_B</a>".  If  you  deactivate  "<a href="file:~/path_B">~/path_B</a>"  then modules will be installed into "<a href="file:~/pathA">~/pathA</a>" -- but if you
       deactivate "<a href="file:~/path_A">~/path_A</a>" then they will still be installed in "<a href="file:~/pathB">~/pathB</a>" because pathB was activated later.

       You can also ask "local::lib" to clean itself completely out of the current shell's environment with  the
       "--deactivate-all"  option.   For  multiple  environments  for  multiple  apps  you may need to include a
       modified version of the "use FindBin" instructions in the "In code" sample above.  If you  did  something
       like  the  above,  you  have  a  set  of  Perl  modules  at  "<a href="file:~/mydir1/lib">~/mydir1/lib</a>".  If  you  have  a  script at
       "<a href="file:~/mydir1/scripts/myscript.pl">~/mydir1/scripts/myscript.pl</a>", you need to tell it where to find the modules you  installed  for  it  at
       "<a href="file:~/mydir1/lib">~/mydir1/lib</a>".

       In "<a href="file:~/mydir1/scripts/myscript.pl">~/mydir1/scripts/myscript.pl</a>":

         use strict;
         use warnings;
         use local::lib "$FindBin::Bin/..";  ### points to <a href="file:~/mydir1">~/mydir1</a> and local::lib finds lib
         use lib "$FindBin::Bin/..<a href="file:/lib">/lib</a>";     ### points to <a href="file:~/mydir1/lib">~/mydir1/lib</a>

       Put this before any BEGIN { ... } blocks that require the modules you installed.

   <b>Differences</b> <b>when</b> <b>using</b> <b>this</b> <b>module</b> <b>under</b> <b>Win32</b>
       To set up the proper environment variables for your current session of "CMD.exe", you can use this:

         C:\&gt;perl -Mlocal::lib
         set PERL_MB_OPT=--install_base C:\DOCUME~1\ADMINI~1\perl5
         set PERL_MM_OPT=INSTALL_BASE=C:\DOCUME~1\ADMINI~1\perl5
         set PERL5LIB=C:\DOCUME~1\ADMINI~1\perl5\lib\perl5
         set PATH=C:\DOCUME~1\ADMINI~1\perl5\bin;%PATH%

         ### To set the environment for this shell alone
         C:\&gt;perl -Mlocal::lib &gt; %TEMP%\tmp.bat &amp;&amp; %TEMP%\tmp.bat &amp;&amp; del %TEMP%\tmp.bat
         ### instead of $(perl -Mlocal::lib=./)

       If  you  want  the  environment entries to persist, you'll need to add them to the Control Panel's System
       applet yourself or use App::local::lib::Win32Helper.

       The "~" is translated to the user's profile directory (the directory named for the user under  "Documents
       and  Settings"  (Windows  XP  or  earlier) or "Users" (Windows Vista or later)) unless $ENV{HOME} exists.
       After that, the home directory is translated to a short name (which means the directory must  exist)  and
       the subdirectories are created.

       <u>PowerShell</u>

       local::lib also supports PowerShell, and can be used with the "Invoke-Expression" cmdlet.

         Invoke-Expression "$(perl -Mlocal::lib)"

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       The  version  of  a Perl package on your machine is not always the version you need.  Obviously, the best
       thing to do would be to update to the version you need.  However, you  might  be  in  a  situation  where
       you're prevented from doing this.  Perhaps you don't have system administrator privileges; or perhaps you
       are  using  a  package management system such as Debian, and nobody has yet gotten around to packaging up
       the version you need.

       local::lib solves this problem by allowing you to create your own directory of Perl  packages  downloaded
       from CPAN (in a multi-user system, this would typically be within your own home directory).  The existing
       system  Perl  installation is not affected; you simply invoke Perl with special options so that Perl uses
       the packages in your own local package directory rather than the system  packages.   local::lib  arranges
       things  so  that  your  locally  installed  version of the Perl packages takes precedence over the system
       installation.

       If you are using a package management system (such as Debian), you don't need to worry about  Debian  and
       CPAN  stepping  on  each other's toes.  Your local version of the packages will be written to an entirely
       separate directory from those installed by Debian.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module provides a quick, convenient way of bootstrapping a user-local Perl  module  library  located
       within  the user's home directory. It also constructs and prints out for the user the list of environment
       variables using the syntax appropriate for  the  user's  current  shell  (as  specified  by  the  "SHELL"
       environment variable), suitable for directly adding to one's shell configuration file.

       More  generally, local::lib allows for the bootstrapping and usage of a directory containing Perl modules
       outside of Perl's @INC. This makes it easier to ship an application with an app-specific copy of  a  Perl
       module, or collection of modules. Useful in cases like when an upstream maintainer hasn't applied a patch
       to a module of theirs that you need for your application.

       On import, local::lib sets the following environment variables to appropriate values:

       PERL_MB_OPT
       PERL_MM_OPT
       PERL5LIB
       PATH
       PERL_LOCAL_LIB_ROOT

       When possible, these will be appended to instead of overwritten entirely.

       These values are then available for reference by any code after import.

</pre><h4><b>CREATING</b> <b>A</b> <b>SELF-CONTAINED</b> <b>SET</b> <b>OF</b> <b>MODULES</b></h4><pre>
       See  lib::core::only  for  one way to do this - but note that there are a number of caveats, and the best
       approach is always to perform a build against a clean perl (i.e. site and vendor as  close  to  empty  as
       possible).

</pre><h4><b>IMPORT</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Options  are  values that can be passed to the "local::lib" import besides the directory to use. They are
       specified as "use local::lib '--option'[, path];" or "perl -Mlocal::lib=--option[,path]".

   <b>--deactivate</b>
       Remove the chosen path (or  the  default  path)  from  the  module  search  paths  if  it  was  added  by
       "local::lib", instead of adding it.

   <b>--deactivate-all</b>
       Remove all directories that were added to search paths by "local::lib" from the search paths.

   <b>--quiet</b>
       Don't output any messages about directories being created.

   <b>--always</b>
       Always add directories to environment variables, ignoring if they are already included.

   <b>--shelltype</b>
       Specify  the  shell  type  to  use  for  output.   By  default,  the  shell will be detected based on the
       environment.  Should be one of: "bourne", "csh", "cmd", or "powershell".

   <b>--no-create</b>
       Prevents "local::lib" from creating directories when activating dirs.  This is likely to cause issues  on
       Win32 systems.

</pre><h4><b>A</b> <b>WARNING</b> <b>ABOUT</b> <b>UNINST=1</b></h4><pre>
       Be careful about using local::lib in combination with "make install UNINST=1".  The idea of this  feature
       is  that will uninstall an old version of a module before installing a new one. However it lacks a safety
       check that the old version and the new version will go in the same directory. Used  in  combination  with
       local::lib, you can potentially delete a globally accessible version of a module while installing the new
       version  in  a  local  place. Only combine "make install UNINST=1" and local::lib if you understand these
       possible consequences.

</pre><h4><b>LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       •   Directory names with spaces in them are not well supported by the perl toolchain and the programs  it
           uses.   Pure-perl  distributions  should support spaces, but problems are more likely with dists that
           require compilation. A workaround you can do is moving your local::lib to  a  directory  with  spaces
           <b>after</b>  you installed all modules inside your local::lib bootstrap. But be aware that you can't update
           or install CPAN modules after the move.

       •   Rather basic shell detection. Right now anything with csh in its name is assumed to be a C  shell  or
           something  compatible,  and  everything else is assumed to be Bourne, except on Win32 systems. If the
           "SHELL" environment variable is not set, a Bourne-compatible shell is assumed.

       •   Kills any existing PERL_MM_OPT or PERL_MB_OPT.

       •   Should probably auto-fixup CPAN config if not already done.

       •   On VMS and MacOS Classic (pre-OS X), local::lib loads File::Spec.  This means any File::Spec  version
           installed  in  the  local::lib will be ignored by scripts using local::lib.  A workaround for this is
           using "use lib "$local_lib/lib/perl5";" instead of using "local::lib" directly.

       •   Conflicts with ExtUtils::MakeMaker's "PREFIX" option.  "local::lib" uses the  "INSTALL_BASE"  option,
           as  it has more predictable and sane behavior.  If something attempts to use the "PREFIX" option when
           running a <u>Makefile.PL</u>, ExtUtils::MakeMaker will refuse to run, as the two options conflict.  This can
           be worked around by temporarily unsetting the "PERL_MM_OPT" environment variable.

       •   Conflicts with Module::Build's "--prefix" option.   Similar  to  the  previous  limitation,  but  any
           "--prefix"  option specified will be ignored.  This can be worked around by temporarily unsetting the
           "PERL_MB_OPT" environment variable.

       Patches very much welcome for any of the above.

       •   On Win32 systems, does not have a way to write the created environment variables to the registry,  so
           that they can persist through a reboot.

</pre><h4><b>TROUBLESHOOTING</b></h4><pre>
       If  you've configured local::lib to install CPAN modules somewhere in to your home directory, and at some
       point later you try to install a module with "cpan -i  Foo::Bar",  but  it  fails  with  an  error  like:
       "Warning:  You  do  not have permissions to install into /usr/lib64/perl5/site_perl/5.8.8/x86_64-linux at
       /usr/lib64/perl5/5.8.8/Foo/Bar.pm" and buried within the install log is an error  saying  "'INSTALL_BASE'
       is  not  a  known  MakeMaker  parameter  name", then you've somehow lost your updated ExtUtils::MakeMaker
       module.

       To remedy this situation, rerun the bootstrapping procedure documented above.

       Then, run "rm -r <a href="file:~/.cpan/build/Foo-Bar">~/.cpan/build/Foo-Bar</a>*"

       Finally, re-run "cpan -i Foo::Bar" and it should install without problems.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       SHELL
       COMSPEC
           local::lib looks at the user's "SHELL" environment variable when printing out commands to add to  the
           shell configuration file.

           On Win32 systems, "COMSPEC" is also examined.
