</pre><h4><b>Name</b></h4><pre>
       sqitch-bundle - Bundle a Sqitch project for distribution

</pre><h4><b>Synopsis</b></h4><pre>
         sqitch bundle [options]
         sqitch bundle --dest-dir widgets-1.0.0
         sqitch bundle --all
         sqitch bundle pg mysql

</pre><h4><b>Description</b></h4><pre>
       This command bundles up a sqitch project for distribution. At its simplest, it copies the project
       configuration file, plan files, and all of the change scripts to a directory. This directory can then be
       packaged up for distribution (as a tarball, RPM, etc.).

       By default, the "bundle" command will bundle the plan and scripts for the default plan and top directory,
       as defined by the core configuration and command-line options. Pass the "--all" option to have it iterate
       over all known plans and top directories (as specified for engines and targets) and bundle them all. This
       works well for creating a a single bundle with all plans and scripts.

       To specify which plans an top directories to bundle, pass the target, engine, or plan file names as
       arguments. See "Examples" for examples.

       •   Engine names

       •   Target names

       •   Plan file names

       The bundle command also allows you to limit bundled changes to a subset of those in a plan. When bundling
       a  single  plan,  use  the  "--from" and/or "--to" options to do the limiting. When using multiple plans,
       specify the changes after each target argument. In either case, the changes can be specified in  any  way
       documented on sqitchchanges. See "Examples" for examples.

</pre><h4><b>Options</b></h4><pre>
       "--dest-dir"
       "--dir"
           The  name  of the directory in which to bundle the project. The configuration file will be created in
           this directory, and all top, deploy, revert, and verify directories will be created relative  to  it.
           Defaults to <u>bundle</u>.

       "--from"
           The  change from which to start bundling. If you need to bundle up only a subset of a plan, specify a
           change (using a supported change specification from which to start the bundling via this option. This
           option is probably only useful when bundling a single plan.

       "--to"
           The change to which to end bundling. If you need to bundle up only a subset  of  a  plan,  specify  a
           change  (using  a supported change specification that should be the last change to be included in the
           bundle. This option is probably only useful when bundling a single plan.

       "-a"
       "--all"
           Bundle all the project plans and their associated scripts. Cannot be mixed with  target,  engine,  or
           plan  file  name  arguments;  doing  so  will result in an error. Useful for multi-plan projects that
           should have all the plans bundled together. Overrides the value of  the  "bundle.all"  configuration;
           use "--no-all" to override a true "bundle.all" configuration.

       "--plan-file"
       "-f"
           Path  to  the deployment plan file. Overrides target, engine, and core configuration values. Defaults
           to <u>$top_dir/sqitch.plan</u>.

</pre><h4><b>Configuration</b> <b>Variables</b></h4><pre>
       "bundle.dest_dir"
           The name of the directory in which to bundle the project.

</pre><h4><b>Examples</b></h4><pre>
       Bundle a Sqitch project with the default plan and scripts into <u>bundle</u>:

         sqitch bundle

       Bundle a Sqitch project with all plans and scripts into <u>bundle</u>:

         sqitch bundle --all

       Bundle a Sqitch project into <u>BUILDROOT/MyProj</u>:

         sqitch bundle --dest-dir BUILDROOT/MyProj

       Bundle a project including changes "adduser" through "@v1.0":

         sqitch bundle --from adduser --to @v1.0

       Bundle a the "pg" engine plans with changes "adduser" through  "@v1.0",  and  the  "sqlite"  engine  with
       changes from the start of the plan up to "widgets":

         sqitch bundle pg adduser @v1.0 sqlite @ROOT wigets

       Bundle just the files necessary to execute the plan for the "pg" engine:

         sqitch bundle pg

       Bundle the files necessary for two plan files:

         sqitch bundle sqlite/sqitch.plan mysql/sqitch.plan
