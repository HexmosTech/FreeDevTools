       Object::Remote::Logging - Logging subsystem for Object::Remote

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Object::Remote::Logging qw( :log :dlog arg_levels router );

         $levels = [qw( trace debug verbose info warn error fatal )];
         $levels = arg_levels(); #same result

         $ENV{OBJECT_REMOTE_LOG_LEVEL} = 'trace'; #or other level name
         $ENV{OBJECT_REMOTE_LOG_FORMAT} = '%l %t: %p::%m %s'; #and more
         #Output logs from two specific logging packages
         $ENV{OBJECT_REMOTE_LOG_SELECTIONS} = 'Object::Remote::Logging Some::Other::Package';
         #Output all log messages except those generated by Object::Remote
         $ENV{OBJECT_REMOTE_LOG_SELECTIONS} = '* -Object::Remote::Logging';
         $ENV{OBJECT_REMOTE_LOG_FORWARDING} = 1; #default 0

         log_info { 'Trace log event' };
         Dlog_verbose { "Debug event with Data::Dumper::Concise: $_" } { foo =&gt; 'bar' };

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This is the logging framework for Object::Remote implemented as an extension of Log::Contextual with a
       slightly incompatible API. This system allows developers using Object::Remote and end users of that
       software to control Object::Remote logging so operation can be tracked if needed. This is also the API
       used to generate log messages inside the Object::Remote source code.

       The rest of the logging system comes from Object::Remote::Logging::Logger which implements log rendering
       and output and Object::Remote::Logging::Router which delivers log events to the loggers.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       Object::Remote logging output is not enabled by default. If you need to immediately start debugging set
       the OBJECT_REMOTE_LOG_LEVEL environment variable to either 'trace' or 'debug'. This will enable logging
       to STDERR on the local and all remote Perl interpreters. By default STDERR for all remote interpreters is
       passed through unmodified so this is sufficient to receive logs generated anywhere Object::Remote is
       running.

       Every time the local interpreter creates a new Object::Remote::Connection the connection is given an id
       that is unique to that connection on the local interpreter. The connection id and other metadata is
       available in the log output via a log format string that can be set via the OBJECT_REMOTE_LOG_FORMAT
       environment variable. The format string and available metadata is documented in
       Object::Remote::Logging::Logger. Setting this environment variable on the local interpreter will cause it
       to be propagated to the remote interpreter so all logs will be formatted the same way.

       This system is designed so any module can create their own logging packages using it.  With out any
       additional configuration the consumers of this logging system will automatically be enabled via
       OBJECT_REMOTE_LOG_LEVEL and formatted with OBJECT_REMOTE_LOG_FORMAT but those additional log messages are
       not sent to STDERR.  By setting the OBJECT_REMOTE_LOG_SELECTIONS environment variable to a list of
       logging package names separated by spaces then logs generated using those packages will be sent to
       STDERR. If the asterisk character (*) is used in the place of a package name then all package names will
       be selected by default instead of ignored. An individual package name can be turned off by prefixing the
       name with a hyphen character (-). This is also a configuration item that is forwarded to the remote
       interpreters so all logging is consistent.

       Regardless of OBJECT_REMOTE_LOG_LEVEL the logging system is still active and loggers can access the
       stream of log messages to format and output them. Internally OBJECT_REMOTE_LOG_LEVEL causes an
       Object::Remote::Logging::Logger to be built and connected to the Object::Remote::Logging::Router
       instance. It is also possible to manually build a logger instance and connect it to the router. See the
       Object::Remote::Logging documentation for more information.

       The logging system also supports a method of forwarding log messages from remote interpreters to the
       local interpreter. Forwarded log messages are generated in the remote interpreter and the logger for the
       message is invoked in the local interpreter.  Packages using or extending Object::Remote::Logging will
       have log messages forwarded automatically.  Loggers receive forwarded log messages exactly the same way
       as non-forwarded messages except a forwarded message includes extra metadata about the remote connection.
       Log forwarding is disabled by default because it comes with a performance hit; to enable it set the
       OBJECT_REMOTE_LOG_FORWARDING environment variable to 1.

</pre><h4><b>EXPORTABLE</b> <b>SUBROUTINES</b></h4><pre>
       arg_levels
           Returns  an  array  reference that contains the ordered list of level names with the lowest log level
           first and the highest log level last.

       router
           Returns the instance of Object::Remote::Logging::Router that is in use. The router instance  is  used
           in  combination  with  Object::Remote::Logging::Logger  objects  to select then render and output log
           messages.

       log_&lt;level&gt; and Dlog_&lt;level&gt;
           These methods come direct from Log::Contextual; see that documentation for a complete reference.  For
           each  of  the log level names there are subroutines with the log_ and Dlog_ prefix that will generate
           the log message. The first argument is a code block that returns the log  message  contents  and  the
           optional  further  arguments  are both passed to the block as the argument list and returned from the
           log method as a list.

             log_trace { "A fine log message $_[0] " } 'if I do say so myself';
             %hash = Dlog_trace { "Very handy: $_" } ( foo =&gt; 'bar' );

       logS_&lt;level&gt; and DlogS_&lt;level&gt;
           Works just like log_ and Dlog_ except returns only the first argument as a scalar value.

             my $beverage = logS_info { "Customer ordered $_[0]" } 'Coffee';

</pre><h4><b>LEVEL</b> <b>NAMES</b></h4><pre>
       Object::Remote uses an ordered list of log level names with the lowest level first and the highest  level
       last.  The  list  of  level  names  can  be accessed via the arg_levels method which is exportable to the
       consumer of this class. The log level names are:

       trace
           As much information about operation as possible including  multiple  line  dumps  of  large  content.
           Tripple verbose operation (-v -v -v).

       debug
           Messages  about  operations  that  could  hang as well as internal state changes, results from method
           invocations, and information useful when looking for faults.  Double verbose operation (-v -v).

       verbose
           Additional optional messages to the user that can be enabled at their will. Single verbose  operation
           (-v).

       info
           Messages  from  normal operation that are intended to be displayed to the end user if quiet operation
           is not indicated and more verbose operation is not in effect.

       warn
           Something wasn't supposed to happen but did. Operation was not impacted but otherwise  the  event  is
           noteworthy. Single quiet operation (-q).

       error
           Something  went  wrong.  Operation  of the system may continue but some operation has most definitely
           failed. Double quiet operation (-q -q).

       fatal
           Something went wrong and recovery is not possible. The  system  should  stop  operating  as  soon  as
           possible. Tripple quiet operation (-q -q -q).
