       XtOwnSelection, XtOwnSelectionIncremental, XtDisownSelection - set selection owner

       #include &lt;X11/Intrinsic.h&gt;

       Boolean   XtOwnSelection(Widget  <u>w</u>,  Atom  <u>selection</u>,  Time  <u>time</u>,  XtConvertSelectionProc  <u>convert_proc</u>,
              XtLoseSelectionProc <u>lose_selection</u>, XtSelectionDoneProc <u>done_proc</u>);

       Boolean  XtOwnSelectionIncremental(Widget  <u>w</u>,  Atom  <u>selection</u>,  Time  <u>time</u>,   XtConvertSelectionIncrProc
              <u>convert_callback</u>,  XtLoseSelectionIncrProc  <u>lose_callback</u>,  XtSelectionDoneIncrProc <u>done_callback</u>,
              XtCancelConvertSelectionProc <u>cancel_callback</u>, XtPointer <u>client_data</u>);

       void XtDisownSelection(Widget <u>w</u>, Atom <u>selection</u>, Time <u>time</u>);

</pre><h4><b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>convert_proc</u>
                 Specifies the procedure that is to be called whenever someone requests the current value of the
                 selection.

       <u>done_proc</u> Specifies the procedure that is called after the requestor has received the selection  or  NULL
                 if the owner is not interested in being called back.

       <u>lose_selection</u>
                 Specifies  the  procedure that is to be called whenever the widget has lost selection ownership
                 or NULL if the owner is not interested in being called back.

       <u>selection</u> Specifies an  atom  that  describes  the  type  of  the  selection  (for  example,  <b>XA_PRIMARY</b>,
                 <b>XA_SECONDARY</b>, or <b>XA_CLIPBOARD</b>).

       <u>time</u>      Specifies the timestamp that indicates when the selection ownership should commence or is to be
                 relinquished.

       <u>w</u>         Specifies the widget that wishes to become the owner or to relinquish ownership.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>XtOwnSelection</b>  function informs the Intrinsics selection mechanism that a widget believes it owns a
       selection.  It returns <b>True</b> if the widget has successfully become the owner  and  <b>False</b>  otherwise.   The
       widget may fail to become the owner if some other widget has asserted ownership at a time later than this
       widget.   Note  that  widgets  can  lose  selection  ownership either because someone else asserted later
       ownership of the selection or because the widget voluntarily gave up ownership of  the  selection.   Also
       note that the lose_selection procedure is not called if the widget fails to obtain selection ownership in
       the first place.

       The  <b>XtOwnSelectionIncremental</b>  procedure informs the Intrinsics incremental selection mechanism that the
       specified widget wishes to own the selection.  It returns  <b>True</b>  if  the  specified  widget  successfully
       becomes  the selection owner or <b>False</b> otherwise.  For more information about <u>selection</u>, <u>target</u>, and <u>time</u>,
       see Section 2.6 of the <u>Inter-Client</u> <u>Communication</u> <u>Conventions</u> <u>Manual</u>.

       A widget that becomes the selection owner using <b>XtOwnSelectionIncremental</b> may  use  <b>XtDisownSelection</b>  to
       relinquish selection ownership.

       The <b>XtDisownSelection</b> function informs the Intrinsics selection mechanism that the specified widget is to
       lose  ownership  of  the selection.  If the widget does not currently own the selection either because it
       lost the selection or because it never had the selection to begin with, <b>XtDisownSelection</b> does nothing.

       After a widget has called <b>XtDisownSelection</b>, its convert procedure  is  not  called  even  if  a  request
       arrives later with a timestamp during the period that this widget owned the selection.  However, its done
       procedure will be called if a conversion that started before the call to <b>XtDisownSelection</b> finishes after
       the call to <b>XtDisownSelection</b>.
