       unknown - Handle attempts to use non-existent commands

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>unknown</b> <u>cmdName</u> ?<u>arg</u> <u>arg</u> <u>...</u>?
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  command is invoked by the Tcl interpreter whenever a script tries to invoke a command that does not
       exist.  The default implementation of <b>unknown</b> is a library procedure  defined  when  Tcl  initializes  an
       interpreter.  You can override the default <b>unknown</b> to change its functionality, or you can register a new
       handler  for  individual  namespaces  using the <b>namespace</b> <b>unknown</b> command.  Note that there is no default
       implementation of <b>unknown</b> in a safe interpreter.

       If the Tcl interpreter encounters a command name for which there is not a defined command (in either  the
       current  namespace, or the global namespace), then Tcl checks for the existence of an unknown handler for
       the current namespace. By default, this handler is a command  named  <b>::unknown</b>.   If  there  is  no  such
       command, then the interpreter returns an error.  If the <b>unknown</b> command exists (or a new handler has been
       registered  for  the  current  namespace),  then  it  is  invoked with arguments consisting of the fully-
       substituted name and arguments for the original non-existent command.  The <b>unknown</b> command typically does
       things like searching through library directories for a command  procedure  with  the  name  <u>cmdName</u>,  or
       expanding  abbreviated  command names to full-length, or automatically executing unknown commands as sub-
       processes.  In some cases (such as expanding abbreviations) <b>unknown</b>  will  change  the  original  command
       slightly  and  then  (re-)execute  it.   The  result of the <b>unknown</b> command is used as the result for the
       original non-existent command.

       The default implementation of <b>unknown</b> behaves as follows.  It first calls the <b>auto_load</b> library procedure
       to load the command.  If this  succeeds,  then  it  executes  the  original  command  with  its  original
       arguments.   If the auto-load fails and Tcl is run interactively then <b>unknown</b> calls <b>auto_execok</b> to see if
       there is an executable file by the name <u>cmd</u>.  If so, it invokes the Tcl <b>exec</b> command with <u>cmd</u> and all the
       <u>args</u> as arguments.  If <u>cmd</u> cannot be auto-executed, <b>unknown</b> checks to see if the command was  invoked  at
       top-level  and outside of any script.  If so, then <b>unknown</b> takes two additional steps.  First, it sees if
       <u>cmd</u> has one of the following three forms: <b>!!</b>, <b>!</b><u>event</u>, or <b>^</b><u>old</u><b>^</b><u>new</u>?<b>^</b>?.  If so, then  <b>unknown</b>  carries  out
       history substitution in the same way that <b>csh</b> would for these constructs.  Finally, <b>unknown</b> checks to see
       if  <u>cmd</u>  is  a  unique  abbreviation for an existing Tcl command.  If so, it expands the command name and
       executes the command with the original arguments.  If none of the above efforts has been able to  execute
       the  command, <b>unknown</b> generates an error return.  If the global variable <b>auto_noload</b> is defined, then the
       auto-load step is skipped.  If the global variable <b>auto_noexec</b> is defined  then  the  auto-exec  step  is
       skipped.   Under  normal circumstances the return value from <b>unknown</b> is the return value from the command
       that was eventually executed.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       Arrange for the <b>unknown</b> command to have its standard behavior except for first logging the  fact  that  a
       command was not found:

              # Save the original one so we can chain to it
              rename <b>unknown</b> _original_unknown

              # Provide our own implementation
              proc <b>unknown</b> args {
                  puts stderr "WARNING: unknown command: $args"
                  uplevel 1 [list _original_unknown {*}$args]
              }
