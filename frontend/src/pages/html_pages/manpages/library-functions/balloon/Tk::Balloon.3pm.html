                                        ],
                     );

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Balloon</b> provides the framework to create and attach help balloons to various widgets so that when the
       mouse pauses over the widget for more than a specified amount of time, a help balloon is popped up.

   <b>Balloons</b> <b>and</b> <b>Menus</b> <b>or</b> <b>Listboxes</b>
       If the balloon is attached to a <b>Menu</b> or <b>Listbox</b> widget and the message arguments are array references,
       then each element in the array will be the message corresponding to a menu entry or listbox element.  The
       balloon message will then be shown for the entry which the mouse pauses over. Otherwise it is assumed
       that the balloon is to be attached to the <b>Menu</b> or <b>Listbox</b> as a whole. You can have separate status and
       balloon messages just like normal balloons.

   <b>Balloons</b> <b>and</b> <b>Canvases</b>
       If the balloon is attached to a <b>Canvas</b> widget and the message arguments are hash references, then each
       hash key should correspond to a canvas item ID or tag and the associated value will correspond to the
       message for that canvas item. The balloon message will then be shown for the current item (the one at the
       position of the mouse). Otherwise it is assumed that the balloon is to be attached to the <b>Canvas</b> as a
       whole.  You can have separate status and balloon messages just like normal balloons.

   <b>Balloons</b> <b>and</b> <b>HLists</b>
       If the balloon is attached to a <b>HList</b> widget and the message arguments are hash references, then each
       hash key should correspond to a HList path and the associated value will correspond to the message for
       that HList item. The balloon message will then be shown for the current item (the one at the position of
       the mouse). Otherwise it is assumed that the balloon is to be attached to the <b>HList</b> as a whole.  You can
       have separate status and balloon messages just like normal balloons.

   <b>Balloon</b> <b>Position</b>
       By default, the balloon pops up at the lower right side of the client.  If it would extend outside the
       lower screen border, it's positioned at the upper right side. If it would extend outside the right screen
       border it's shown on the lower left side of the client. If it would extend outside both the lower and the
       right screen border, it's positioned at the upper left side of the client. Thus, the little arrow always
       points to the attached client.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Balloon</b> accepts all of the options that the <b>Frame</b> widget accepts. In addition, the following options are
       also recognized.

       <b>-initwait</b>
           Specifies  the amount of time to wait without activity before popping up a help balloon. Specified in
           milliseconds. Defaults to 350 milliseconds. This applies to both the popped up balloon and the status
           bar message.

       <b>-state</b>
           Can be one of <b>'balloon'</b>, <b>'status'</b>, <b>'both'</b> or <b>'none'</b> indicating that  the  help  balloon,  status  bar
           help,  both  or  none  respectively should be activated when the mouse pauses over the client widget.
           Default is <b>'both'</b>.

       <b>-statusbar</b>
           Specifies the widget used to display the status message. This widget should accept the  <b>-text</b>  option
           and  is  typically a <b>Label</b>. If the widget accepts the <b>-textvariable</b> option and that option is defined
           then it is used instead of the <b>-text</b> option.

       <b>-balloonposition</b>
           Can be one of <b>'widget'</b> or <b>'mouse'</b>. It controls where the  balloon  will  popup.  <b>'widget'</b>  makes  the
           balloon appear at the lower right corner of the widget it is attached to (default), and <b>'mouse'</b> makes
           the balloon appear below and to the right of the current mouse position.

       <b>-postcommand</b>
           This  option  takes a <b>CODE</b> reference which will be executed before the balloon and statusbar messages
           are displayed and should return a true or false value to indicate whether you want the balloon to  be
           displayed  or  not.  This  also  lets you control where the balloon is positioned by returning a true
           value that looks like <u>X,Y</u> (matches this regular expression: "/^(\d+),(\d+)$/").  If  the  postcommand
           returns  a value that matches that re then those coordinates will be used as the position to post the
           balloon. <u>Warning:</u> this subroutine should return quickly or the balloon response will appear slow.

       <b>-cancelcommand</b>
           This option takes a <b>CODE</b> reference which will be executed before the balloon and  statusbar  messages
           are  canceled  and should return a true or false value to indicate whether you want the balloon to be
           canceled or not. <u>Warning:</u> this subroutine should return quickly or the balloon response  will  appear
           slow.

       <b>-motioncommand</b>
           This  option  takes  a <b>CODE</b> reference which will be executed for any motion event and should return a
           true or false  value  to  indicate  whether  the  currently  displayed  balloon  should  be  canceled
           (deactivated).   If it returns true then the balloon will definitely be canceled, if it returns false
           then it may still be canceled depending the internal rules.  <u>Note:</u> a new balloon may be posted  after
           the  <b>-initwait</b>  time  interval,  use  the <b>-postcommand</b> option to control that behavior.  <u>Warning:</u> the
           subroutine should be extremely fast or the balloon response will appear slow and consume a lot of CPU
           time (it is executed every time the mouse moves over the widgets the balloon is attached to).

       <b>-numscreens</b>
           This option accepts an integer 1 or greater. This option should be used to avoid disjointed  balloons
           across  multiple  screens  in  single  logical  sceen  (SLS)  mode.  This only currently works in the
           horizontal direction.  Example: If you are running dual screens in SLS mode then you would  set  this
           value to 2. Default value is 1.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>Balloon</b> widget supports only three non-standard methods:

   <b>attach(</b><u><b>widget</b></u><b>,</b> <u><b>options</b></u><b>)</b>
       Attaches the widget indicated by <u>widget</u> to the help system. The allowed options are:

       <b>-statusmsg</b>
           The  argument is the message to be shown on the status bar when the mouse pauses over this client. If
           this is not specified, but <b>-msg</b> is specified then the message displayed on the status bar is the same
           as the argument for <b>-msg</b>. If you give it a scalar reference then  it  is  dereferenced  before  being
           displayed. Useful if the postcommand is used to change the message.

       <b>-balloonmsg</b>
           The  argument  is  the  message  to be displayed in the balloon that will be popped up when the mouse
           pauses over this client. As with <b>-statusmsg</b> if this is not specified, then it takes  its  value  from
           the  <b>-msg</b>  specification if any. If neither <b>-balloonmsg</b> nor <b>-msg</b> are specified, or they are the empty
           string then no balloon is popped up instead of an empty balloon. If you give it  a  scalar  reference
           then  it  is  dereferenced  before  being  displayed. Useful if the postcommand is used to change the
           message.

       <b>-msg</b>
           The catch-all for <b>-statusmsg</b> and <b>-balloonmsg</b>. This is a convenient way of specifying the same message
           to be displayed in both the balloon and the status bar for the client.

       <b>-initwait</b>
       <b>-state</b>
       <b>-statusbar</b>
       <b>-balloonposition</b>
       <b>-postcommand</b>
       <b>-cancelcommand</b>
       <b>-motioncommand</b>
           These options allow you to override the balloon's default value for those  option  for  some  of  the
           widgets  it  is  attached  to.  It accepts the same values as above and will default to the <b>Balloon</b>'s
           value.

   <b>detach(</b><u><b>widget</b></u><b>)</b>
       Detaches the specified <u>widget</u> from the help system.

   <b>destroy</b>
       Destroys the specified balloon.

</pre><h4><b>ADVERTISED</b> <b>SUBWIDGETS</b></h4><pre>
       The balloon label is advertised as "message".

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       See the balloon demo included with the widget demo script that came with the distribution for examples on
       various ways to use balloons.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       Because of the overhead associated with each balloon you create (from tracking the mouse movement to know
       when to activate and deactivate them) you will see the best performance  (low  CPU  consumption)  if  you
       create  as few balloons as possible and attach them to as many widgets as you can.  In other words, don't
       create a balloon for each widget you want to attach one to.

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
       Pressing any button will deactivate (cancel) the current balloon, if one exists. You can usually make the
       balloon reappear by moving the mouse a little. Creative use of the 3 command options  can  help  you  out
       also.  If  the  mouse  is over the balloon when a menu is unposted then the balloon will remain until you
       move off of it.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       If using balloons attached to listbox entries or canvas items in a scrolled widget,  then  the  subwidget
       have to be used:

           $balloon-&gt;attach($w-&gt;Subwidget("scrolled"), -msg =&gt; ...);
