</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Data::Fake::CPAN - a Data::Fake plugin for CPAN data and distributions

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 0.027

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Data::Fake qw(CPAN);

         my $dist = fake_cpan_distribution()-&gt;();

         my $archive = $dist-&gt;make_archive({ dir =&gt; '.' });
         say "Produced archive as $archive (cpan author: " . $dist-&gt;cpan_author . ")";
         say "- $_" for sort map {; $_-&gt;name } $dist-&gt;packages;

       This is a Data::Fake plugin for generating CPAN distributions.  Right now, it can't be configured in any
       way, but future revisions might add some options.  You can use this to generate libraries to test your
       CPAN-related tooling, to test PAUSE &lt;https://pause.perl.org&gt;.  Make 10,000 and host your own competing
       CPAN.  The possibilities are endless.

       All the "fake_..." functions exported by Data::Fake::CPAN are exported by default, and you're meant to
       use them via "use Data::Fake".  Like the rest of Data::Fake generators, they return subroutines that you
       must call to get the actual faked data.

</pre><h4><b>PERL</b> <b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This module should work on any version of perl still receiving updates from the Perl 5 Porters.  This
       means it should work on any version of perl released in the last two to three years.  (That is, if the
       most recently released version is v5.40, then this module should work on both v5.40 and v5.38.)

       Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made that the minimum required version
       will not be increased.  The version may be increased for any reason, and there is no promise that patches
       will be accepted to lower the minimum required perl.

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>fake_cpan_author</b>
       This generator generates objects representing CPAN authors.  These methods are provided

       •   given_name - a first name from Data::Fake::Names

       •   surname - a surname from Data::Fake::Names

       •   full_name - given name, space, surname

       •   pauseid - an all caps PAUSE user id

       •   email_address - an email address

       •   name_and_email - a string in the form "full_name &lt;email_address&gt;"

       If you call this generator many times, you might get duplicated data, but the odds are not high.

   <b>fake_cpan_distribution</b>
       This  creates an entire CPAN distribution, as a Module::Faker::Dist object.  It will contain at least one
       package, and possibly several.

   <b>fake_license</b>
       This generator will spit out license values  for  a  CPAN::Meta  file,  like  "perl_5"  or  "openssl"  or
       "unknown".

   <b>fake_package_names</b>
         my $generator = fake_package_names($n);

       The  constructed  generator  will return <u>n</u> package names.  The first package name will be a prefix of all
       the rest of the package names.

   <b>fake_prereqs</b>
       This generator will produce a reference to a hash that can be used as the "prereqs" entry in a CPAN::Meta
       file.  Various type and phase combinations will be produced with unevenly distributed probabilities.  All
       package names will be faked with "fake_package_names".
