       memcached_behavior_get, memcached_behavior_set - Manipulate behavior

</pre><h4><b>LIBRARY</b></h4><pre>
       C Client Library for memcached (libmemcached, -lmemcached)

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         #include &lt;memcached.h&gt;

         uint64_t
           memcached_behavior_get (memcached_st *ptr,
                                   memcached_behavior flag);

         memcached_return_t
           memcached_behavior_set (memcached_st *ptr,
                                   memcached_behavior flag,
                                   uint64_t data);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b><a href="../man3/libmemcached.3.html">libmemcached</a></b>(3) behavior can be modified by use <b>memcached_behavior_set()</b>.  Default behavior is the
       library strives to be quick and accurate. Some behavior, while being faster, can also result in not
       entirely accurate behavior (for instance, <b>memcached_set()</b> will always respond with "MEMCACHED_SUCCESS").

       <b>memcached_behavior_get()</b> takes a behavior flag and returns whether or not that behavior is currently
       enabled in the client.

       <b>memcached_behavior_set()</b> changes the value of a particular option of the client. It takes both a flag
       (listed below) and a value. For simple on or off options you just need to pass in a value of 1. Calls to
       <b>memcached_behavior_set()</b> will flush and reset all connections.

       MEMCACHED_BEHAVIOR_USE_UDP
           Causes  <b><a href="../man3/libmemcached.3.html">libmemcached</a></b>(3)  to use the UDP transport when communicating with a memcached server. Not all
           I/O operations are supported when this behavior is enababled. The following  operations  will  return
           "MEMCACHED_NOT_SUPPORTED"    when    executed    with    the    MEMCACHED_BEHAVIOR_USE_UDP   enabled:
           <b>memcached_version()</b>,  <b>memcached_stat()</b>,  <b>memcached_get()</b>,  <b>memcached_get_by_key()</b>,  <b>memcached_mget()</b>,
           <b>memcached_mget_by_key()</b>, <b>memcached_fetch()</b>, <b>memcached_fetch_result()</b>, <b>memcached_value_fetch()</b>.

           All  other  operations  are supported but are executed in a 'fire-and-forget' mode, in which once the
           client has executed the operation, no attempt will be made to ensure the operation has been  received
           and acted on by the server.

           <b><a href="../man3/libmemcached.3.html">libmemcached</a></b>(3) does not allow TCP and UDP servers to be shared within the same <b><a href="../man3/libmemached.3.html">libmemached</a></b>(3) client
           'instance'.  An  attempt  to  add  a  TCP  server  when  this  behavior  is  enabled will result in a
           "MEMCACHED_INVALID_HOST_PROTOCOL", as will attempting to add a UDP server when this behavior has  not
           been enabled.

       MEMCACHED_BEHAVIOR_NO_BLOCK
           Causes  <b><a href="../man3/libmemcached.3.html">libmemcached</a></b>(3)  to  use  asychronous IO. This is the fastest transport available for storage
           functions.

       MEMCACHED_BEHAVIOR_SND_TIMEOUT
           This sets the microsecond behavior of the socket against the SO_SNDTIMEO flag.  In  cases  where  you
           cannot use non-blocking IO this will allow you to still have timeouts on the sending of data.

       MEMCACHED_BEHAVIOR_RCV_TIMEOUT
           This  sets  the  microsecond behavior of the socket against the SO_RCVTIMEO flag.  In cases where you
           cannot use non-blocking IO this will allow you to still have timeouts on the reading of data.

       MEMCACHED_BEHAVIOR_TCP_NODELAY
           Turns on the no-delay feature for connecting sockets (may be faster in some environments).

       MEMCACHED_BEHAVIOR_HASH
           Makes  the  default  hashing  algorithm  for  keys  use  MD5.  The  value  can  be  set   to   either
           MEMCACHED_HASH_DEFAULT,      MEMCACHED_HASH_MD5,      MEMCACHED_HASH_CRC,     MEMCACHED_HASH_FNV1_64,
           MEMCACHED_HASH_FNV1A_64,  MEMCACHED_HASH_FNV1_32,  MEMCACHED_HASH_FNV1A_32,   MEMCACHED_HASH_JENKINS,
           MEMCACHED_HASH_HSIEH,  and MEMCACHED_HASH_MURMUR.  Each hash has it's advantages and it's weaknesses.
           If you don't know or don't care, just go with the default.  Support  for  MEMCACHED_HASH_HSIEH  is  a
           compile  time  option  that  is  disabled  by  default. To enable support for this hashing algorithm,
           configure and build libmemcached with the --enable-hash_hsieh.

       MEMCACHED_BEHAVIOR_DISTRIBUTION
           Using this you can enable different means of distributing values to servers.  The default  method  is
           MEMCACHED_DISTRIBUTION_MODULA.     You     can     enable     consistent     hashing    by    setting
           MEMCACHED_DISTRIBUTION_CONSISTENT.   Consistent  hashing  delivers  better  distribution  and  allows
           servers    to    be    added    to    the    cluster    with    minimal   cache   losses.   Currently
           MEMCACHED_DISTRIBUTION_CONSISTENT is an alias for the value MEMCACHED_DISTRIBUTION_CONSISTENT_KETAMA.

       MEMCACHED_BEHAVIOR_CACHE_LOOKUPS
           Memcached can cache named lookups so that DNS lookups are made only once.

       MEMCACHED_BEHAVIOR_SUPPORT_CAS
           Support CAS operations (this is not enabled by default at this point in the server since it imposes a
           slight performance penalty).

       MEMCACHED_BEHAVIOR_KETAMA
           Sets  the  default  distribution  to  MEMCACHED_DISTRIBUTION_CONSISTENT_KETAMA  and   the   hash   to
           MEMCACHED_HASH_MD5.

       MEMCACHED_BEHAVIOR_KETAMA_WEIGHTED
           Sets  the default distribution to MEMCACHED_DISTRIBUTION_CONSISTENT_KETAMA with the weighted support.
           and the hash to MEMCACHED_HASH_MD5.

       MEMCACHED_BEHAVIOR_KETAMA_HASH
           Sets the hashing  algorithm  for  host  mapping  on  continuum.  The  value  can  be  set  to  either
           MEMCACHED_HASH_DEFAULT,      MEMCACHED_HASH_MD5,      MEMCACHED_HASH_CRC,     MEMCACHED_HASH_FNV1_64,
           MEMCACHED_HASH_FNV1A_64, MEMCACHED_HASH_FNV1_32, and MEMCACHED_HASH_FNV1A_32.

       MEMCACHED_BEHAVIOR_KETAMA_COMPAT
           Sets the compatibility mode. The value can  be  set  to  either  MEMCACHED_KETAMA_COMPAT_LIBMEMCACHED
           (this  is  the default) or MEMCACHED_KETAMA_COMPAT_SPY to be compatible with the SPY Memcached client
           for Java.

       MEMCACHED_BEHAVIOR_POLL_TIMEOUT
           Modify the timeout value that is used by <b>poll()</b>. The default value is -1. An signed int pointer  must
           be passed to <b>memcached_behavior_set()</b> to change this value. For <b>memcached_behavior_get()</b> a signed int
           value will be cast and returned as the unsigned long long.

       MEMCACHED_BEHAVIOR_USER_DATA
           This  allows  you to store a pointer to a specifc piece of data. This can be retrieved from inside of
           <b>memcached_fetch_execute()</b>. Cloning a memcached_st

           will  copy  the   pointer   to   the   clone.   This   was   deprecated   in   0.14   in   favor   of
           <b><a href="../man3/memcached_callback_set.3.html">memcached_callback_set</a></b>(3). This will be removed in 0.15.

       MEMCACHED_BEHAVIOR_BUFFER_REQUESTS
           Enabling  buffered  IO  causes  commands to "buffer" instead of being sent. Any action that gets data
           causes this buffer to be be sent to the remote connection. Quiting the connection or closing down the
           connection will also cause the buffered data to be pushed to the remote connection.

       MEMCACHED_BEHAVIOR_VERIFY_KEY
           Enabling this will cause <b><a href="../man3/libmemcached.3.html">libmemcached</a></b>(3) to test all keys to verify that they are valid keys.

       MEMCACHED_BEHAVIOR_SORT_HOSTS
           Enabling this will cause hosts that are added to be placed in the host list  in  sorted  order.  This
           will defeat consisten hashing.

       MEMCACHED_BEHAVIOR_CONNECT_TIMEOUT
           In non-blocking mode this changes the value of the timeout during socket connection.

       MEMCACHED_BEHAVIOR_BINARY_PROTOCOL
           Enable  the  use  of  the  binary  protocol.  Please note that you cannot toggle this flag on an open
           connection.

       MEMCACHED_BEHAVIOR_SERVER_FAILURE_LIMIT
           Set    this    value     to     enable     the     server     be     removed     after     continuous
           MEMCACHED_BEHAVIOR_SERVER_FAILURE_LIMIT times connection failure.

       MEMCACHED_BEHAVIOR_IO_MSG_WATERMARK
           Set  this  value  to tune the number of messages that may be sent before libmemcached should start to
           automatically drain the input queue. Setting this value to high, may cause libmemcached  to  deadlock
           (trying to send data, but the send will block because the input buffer in the kernel is full).

       MEMCACHED_BEHAVIOR_IO_BYTES_WATERMARK
           Set  this  value  to  tune  the  number of bytes that may be sent before libmemcached should start to
           automatically drain the input queue (need at least 10 IO requests  sent  without  reading  the  input
           buffer). Setting this value to high, may cause libmemcached to deadlock (trying to send data, but the
           send will block because the input buffer in the kernel is full).

       MEMCACHED_BEHAVIOR_IO_KEY_PREFETCH
           The binary protocol works a bit different than the textual protocol in that a multiget is implemented
           as  a  pipe  of single get-operations which are sent to the server in a chunk. If you are using large
           multigets from your application, you may improve the latency of the gets by setting this value so you
           send out the first chunk of requests when you hit the specified limit.   It  allows  the  servers  to
           start  processing  the  requests to send the data back while the rest of the requests are created and
           sent to the server.

       MEMCACHED_BEHAVIOR_NOREPLY
           Set this value to specify that you really don't care about the  result  from  your  storage  commands
           (set, add, replace, append, prepend).

       MEMCACHED_BEHAVIOR_NUMBER_OF_REPLICAS
           If  you just want "a poor mans HA", you may specify the numbers of replicas libmemcached should store
           of each item (on different servers).  This replication does not dedicate certain memcached servers to
           store the replicas in, but instead it will store the replicas together with all of the other  objects
           (on the 'n' next servers specified in your server list).

       MEMCACHED_BEHAVIOR_RANDOMIZE_REPLICA_READ
           Allows  randomizing  the  replica reads starting point. Normally the read is done from primary server
           and in case of miss the read is done from primary + 1, then primary + 2 all the way to 'n'  replicas.
           If  this  option is set on the starting point of the replica reads is randomized between the servers.
           This allows distributing read load to multiple servers with the expense of more write traffic.

       MEMCACHED_BEHAVIOR_CORK
           Enable TCP_CORK behavior. This is  only  available  as  an  option  Linux.   MEMCACHED_NO_SERVERS  is
           returned  if  no  servers are available to test with.  MEMCACHED_NOT_SUPPORTED is returned if we were
           not able to determine if support was available. All other responses then MEMCACHED_SUCCESS report  an
           error of some sort. This behavior also enables MEMCACHED_BEHAVIOR_TCP_NODELAY when set.

       MEMCACHED_BEHAVIOR_KEEPALIVE
           Enable TCP_KEEPALIVE behavior.

       MEMCACHED_BEHAVIOR_KEEPALIVE_IDLE
           Specify time, in seconds, to mark a connection as idle. This is only available as an option Linux.

       MEMCACHED_BEHAVIOR_SOCKET_SEND_SIZE
           Find  the  current  size  of  SO_SNDBUF. A value of 0 means either an error occurred or no hosts were
           available. It is safe to assume system default if this occurs.

       MEMCACHED_BEHAVIOR_SOCKET_RECV_SIZE
           Find the current size of SO_RCVBUF. A value of 0 means either an error  occurred  or  no  hosts  were
           available. It is safe to assume system default if this occurs.

       MEMCACHED_BEHAVIOR_SERVER_FAILURE_LIMIT
           This number of times a host can have an error before it is disabled.

       MEMCACHED_BEHAVIOR_AUTO_EJECT_HOSTS
           If  enabled any hosts which have been flagged as disabled will be removed from the list of servers in
           the     memcached_st     structure.     This     must     be     used     in     combination     with
           MEMCACHED_BEHAVIOR_SERVER_FAILURE_LIMIT.

       MEMCACHED_BEHAVIOR_RETRY_TIMEOUT
           When  enabled  a host which is problematic will only be checked for usage based on the amount of time
           set by this behavior.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b></h4><pre>
       <b>memcached_behavior_get()</b> returns either the current value of the get, or 0 or 1 on simple flag  behaviors
       (1 being enabled). <b>memcached_behavior_set()</b> returns failure or success.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>memcached_behavior_set()</b>  in  version  .17  was  changed from taking a pointer to data value, to taking a
       uin64_t.
