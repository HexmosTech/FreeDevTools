       CURLOPT_SSL_OPTIONS - SSL behavior options

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;curl/curl.h&gt;

       CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_SSL_OPTIONS, long bitmask);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Pass a long with a bitmask to tell libcurl about specific SSL behaviors. Available bits:

       CURLSSLOPT_ALLOW_BEAST
              Tells  libcurl  to  not  attempt to use any workarounds for a security flaw in the SSL3 and TLS1.0
              protocols. If this option is not used or this bit is set to 0, the SSL layer libcurl uses may  use
              a  work-around  for  this flaw although it might cause interoperability problems with some (older)
              SSL implementations.  WARNING: avoiding this work-around lessens the security, and by setting this
              option to 1 you ask for exactly that. This option is  only  supported  for  Secure  Transport  and
              OpenSSL.

       CURLSSLOPT_NO_REVOKE
              Tells  libcurl to disable certificate revocation checks for those SSL backends where such behavior
              is present. This option is only supported for Schannel (the native Windows SSL library),  with  an
              exception  in  the  case  of  Windows'  Untrusted  Publishers  block list which it seems cannot be
              bypassed. (Added in 7.44.0)

       CURLSSLOPT_NO_PARTIALCHAIN
              Tells libcurl to not accept "partial" certificate chains, which it otherwise does by default. This
              option is only supported for OpenSSL and fails the certificate verification if the chain ends with
              an intermediate certificate and not with a root cert. (Added in 7.68.0)

       CURLSSLOPT_REVOKE_BEST_EFFORT
              Tells libcurl to ignore certificate revocation checks in case of missing or  offline  distribution
              points  for  those  SSL backends where such behavior is present. This option is only supported for
              Schannel (the native Windows SSL library). If combined with <u>CURLSSLOPT_NO_REVOKE</u>, the latter takes
              precedence. (Added in 7.70.0)

       CURLSSLOPT_NATIVE_CA
              Tell libcurl to use the operating system's native CA  store  for  certificate  verification.  This
              option  is  independent  of  other  CA  certificate locations set at run time or build time. Those
              locations are searched in addition to the native CA store.

              Works with wolfSSL on Windows, Linux (Debian, Ubuntu, Gentoo, Fedora, RHEL),  macOS,  Android  and
              iOS  (added  in  8.3.0);  with  GnuTLS  (added in 8.5.0) and with OpenSSL and its forks (LibreSSL,
              BoringSSL, etc) on Windows (Added in 7.71.0).

              This works with rustls on Windows, macOS, Android and iOS. On Linux it is equivalent to using  the
              Mozilla  CA certificate bundle. When used with rustls _only_ the native CA store is consulted, not
              other locations set at run time or build time. (Added in 8.13.0)

       CURLSSLOPT_AUTO_CLIENT_CERT
              Tell libcurl to automatically locate  and  use  a  client  certificate  for  authentication,  when
              requested  by  the  server.  This  option  is  only supported for Schannel (the native Windows SSL
              library). Prior to 7.77.0 this was the default behavior in libcurl with Schannel. Since the server
              can request any certificate that supports client authentication in the  OS  certificate  store  it
              could be a privacy violation and unexpected.  (Added in 7.77.0)

       CURLSSLOPT_EARLYDATA
              Tell  libcurl  to  try sending application data as TLS1.3 early data. This option is supported for
              GnuTLS, wolfSSL, quictls and OpenSSL (but not BoringSSL or AWS-LC).  It  works  on  TCP  and  QUIC
              connections  using  ngtcp2.   This  option  works  on a best effort basis, in cases when it wasn't
              possible to send early data the request is resent normally post-handshake.  This option  does  not
              work when using QUIC.  (Added in 8.11.0 for GnuTLS and 8.13.0 for wolfSSL, quictls and OpenSSL)

</pre><h4><b>DEFAULT</b></h4><pre>
       0

</pre><h4><b>PROTOCOLS</b></h4><pre>
       This functionality affects all TLS based protocols: HTTPS, FTPS, IMAPS, POP3S, SMTPS etc.

       All TLS backends support this option.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       int main(void)
       {
         CURL *curl = curl_easy_init();
         if(curl) {
           CURLcode res;
           curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "https://example.com/");
           /* weaken TLS only for use with silly servers */
           curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_SSL_OPTIONS, (long)CURLSSLOPT_ALLOW_BEAST |
                            CURLSSLOPT_NO_REVOKE);
           res = curl_easy_perform(curl);
           curl_easy_cleanup(curl);
         }
       }

</pre><h4><b>AVAILABILITY</b></h4><pre>
       Added in curl 7.25.0

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       <u><a href="../man3/curl_easy_setopt.3.html">curl_easy_setopt</a>(3)</u> returns a CURLcode indicating success or error.

       CURLE_OK (0) means everything was OK, non-zero means an error occurred, see <u><a href="../man3/libcurl-errors.3.html">libcurl-errors</a>(3)</u>.
