</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  package  provides  a  class  whose  instances  handle  the  editing of a quadrilateral on a canvas.
       Instances can be configured with regard to the visual appearance (regular,  and  highlighted)  of  vertex
       markers.  Note  that  instances  do not store the edited quadrilateral themselves, but delegate this to a
       configurable object.

</pre><h4><b>CLASS</b> <b>API</b></h4><pre>
       <b>::canvas::edit</b> <b>quadrilateral</b> <u>objectName</u> <u>canvas</u> <u>options</u>...
              This, the class command, creates and configures a new instance of a  quadrilateral  editor,  named
              <u>objectName</u>. The instance will be connected to the specified <u>canvas</u> widget.

              The result of the command is the fully qualified name of the instance command.

              The options accepted here, and their values, are explained in the section <b>Options</b>.

</pre><h4><b>INSTANCE</b> <b>API</b></h4><pre>
       Instances of the quadrilateral editors provide the following API:

       <b>objectName</b> <b>destroy</b>
              This method destroys the quadrilateral editor and releases all its internal resources.

              Note that this operation does not destroy the items the editor managed on the attached canvas, nor
              the canvas itself.

              The result of the method is an empty string.

       <b>objectName</b> <b>enable</b>
              This  method  activates  editing  of  the  quadrilateral  on the canvas. This is the default after
              instance creation. A call is ignored if the editor is already active.

              The result of the method is an empty string.

              The complementary method is <b>disable</b>. The interogatory method for the current state is <b>active</b>.

       <b>objectName</b> <b>disable</b>
              This method disables editing of the quadrilateral on the canvas. A call is ignored if  the  editor
              is already disabled.

              The result of the method is an empty string.

              The complementary method is <b>enable</b>. The interogatory method for the current state is <b>active</b>.

       <b>objectName</b> <b>active</b>
              This method queries the editor state.

              The  result  of  the method is a boolean value, <b>true</b> if the editor is active, and <b>false</b> otherwise,
              i.e. disabled.

              The methods to change the state are <b>enable</b> and <b>disable</b>.

       <b>objectName</b> <b>add</b> <u>x</u> <u>y</u>
              This method programmatically adds a vertex at the specified location to the quadrilateral.

              The result of the method is an empty string.

              Note that this method goes through the whole set of callbacks invoked when the user  interactively
              creates a vertex, i.e.  <b>-create-cmd</b>, and, more importantly, <b>-data-cmd</b>.

              This  is  the  method  through  which to load the vertices of a pre-existing quadrilateral into an
              editor instance.

              Note that at most 4 vertices can  be  specified,  and  at  least  4  must  be  specified  for  the
              quadrilateral to be complete.

       <b>objectName</b> <b>clear</b>
              This method programmatically unset the quadrilateral in the editor.

              The result of the method is an empty string.

              Note that this method goes through the same callback invoked when the user interactively removes a
              vertex, i.e. <b>-data-cmd</b>.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The class command accepts the following options

       <b>-convex</b> <u>boolean</u>
              The  value  of  this  option  is  a boolean flag. When the flag is set the editor will accept only
              convex quadrilaterals and reject all operations which would result in a violation of convexity.

              This option can only be set at construction time.

              If not specified it defaults to <b>false</b>, i.e. acceptance of any quadrilateral.

       <b>-tag</b> <u>string</u>
              The value of this option is the name of the canvas tag with which to identify  all  items  of  all
              quadrilateral managed by the editor.

              This option can only be set at construction time.

              If not specified it defaults to <b>QUADRILATERAL</b>

       <b>-create-cmd</b> <u>command-prefix</u>
              The  value  of  this option is a command prefix the editor will invoke when it has to create a new
              vertex.

              This option can only be set at construction time.

              If not specified it defaults to a command which will create a black-bordered blue circle of radius
              3 centered on the location of the new point.

              The signature of this command prefix is

              <b>createCmd</b> <u>canvas</u> <u>x</u> <u>y</u>
                     The result of the command prefix <u>must</u> be a list of the canvas items it created to represent
                     the marker. Note here that the visual representation of a "vertex" may consist of  multiple
                     canvas items in an arbitrary shape.

       <b>-highlight-cmd</b> <u>command-prefix</u>
              The value of this option is a command prefix the editor will invoke when it has to (un)highlight a
              vertex.

              This option can only be set at construction time.

              If  not  specified  it defaults to a command which will re-color the item to highlight in red (and
              restores the color for unhighlighting).

              The two signatures of this command prefix are

              <b>highlightCmd</b> <b>on</b> <u>canvas</u> <u>item</u>

                     This method of the command prefix has to perform whatever is needed to highlight the vertex
                     the <u>item</u> is a  part  of  (remember  the  note  above  about  quadrilateral  allowed  to  be
                     constructed from multiple canvas items).

                     The result of the command can be anything and will be passed as is as argument <u>state</u> to the
                     <b>off</b> method.

              <b>highlightCmd</b> <b>off</b> <u>canvas</u> <u>state</u>

                     This  method  is  invoked  to  unhighlight  a  vertex  described by the <u>state</u>, which is the
                     unchanged result of the <b>on</b> method of the command prefix.  The  result  of  this  method  is
                     ignored.

                     Note  any  interaction between dragging and highlighting of quadrilateral is handled within
                     the editor, and that the callback bears no responsibility for doing such.

       <b>-data-cmd</b> <u>command-prefix</u>
              The value of this option is a command prefix the editor will invoke  when  the  quadrilateral  was
              edited  in  some  way.  This  is  how  the  editor  delegates  the actual storage of quadrilateral
              information to an outside object.

              This option can only be set at construction time.

              If not specified it defaults to an empty string and is ignored by the editor, i.e. not invoked.

              The signatures of this command prefix are

              <b>dataCmd</b> <u>editorObj</u> <u>coordinates</u>
                     This callback is invoked  when  the  quarilateral  was  changed  either  interactively,  or
                     programmatically.  See instance method <b>add</b> for the latter.

                     The  <u>editorObj</u> identifies the instance invoking the callback, whereas <u>coordinates</u> is a list
                     of vertex locations, with each location a pair of x- and y-coordinates.

                     The result of this method is ignored.
