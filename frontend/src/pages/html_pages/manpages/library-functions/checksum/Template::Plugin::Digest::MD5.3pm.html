</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Template::Plugin::Digest::MD5 - TT2 interface to the MD5 Algorithm

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         [% USE Digest.MD5 -%]
         [% checksum = content FILTER md5 -%]
         [% checksum = content FILTER md5_hex -%]
         [% checksum = content FILTER md5_base64 -%]
         [% checksum = content.md5 -%]
         [% checksum = content.md5_hex -%]
         [% checksum = content.md5_base64 -%]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>Digest.MD5</u> Template Toolkit plugin provides access to the MD5 algorithm via the "Digest::MD5" module.
       It is used like a plugin but installs filters and vmethods into the current context.

       When you invoke

           [% USE Digest.MD5 %]

       the following filters (and vmethods of the same name) are installed into the current context:

       "md5"
           Calculate  the MD5 digest of the input, and return it in binary form.  The returned string will be 16
           bytes long.

       "md5_hex"
           Same as "md5", but will return the digest in hexadecimal form. The length of the returned string will
           be 32 and it will only contain characters from this set: '0'..'9' and 'a'..'f'.

       "md5_base64"
           Same as "md5", but will return the digest as a base64 encoded string.  The  length  of  the  returned
           string  will  be  22 and it will only contain characters from this set: 'A'..'Z', 'a'..'z', '0'..'9',
           '+' and '/'.

           Note that the base64 encoded string returned is not padded to be a multiple of 4 bytes long.  If  you
           want  interoperability  with  other base64 encoded md5 digests you might want to append the redundant
           string "==" to the result.

       As the filters are also available as vmethods the following are all equivalent:

           FILTER md5_hex; content; END;
           content FILTER md5_hex;
           content.md5_base64;

</pre><h4><b>WARNING</b></h4><pre>
       The Digest::MD5 man page notes that the MD5 algorithm is not as strong as it used to be.   It  has  since
       2005  been  easy to generate different messages that produce the same MD5 digest.  It still seems hard to
       generate messages that produce a given digest, but it is probably wise to move to stronger algorithms for
       applications that depend on the digest to uniquely identify a message.

</pre><h4><b>DEDICATION</b></h4><pre>
       This distribution was originally created by Andrew Ford. Sadly in early 2014, Andrew was  diagnosed  with
       Pancreatic Cancer and passed away peacfully at home on 25th April 2014.

       One  of  his  wishes  was for his OpenSource work to continue. At his funeral, many of his colleagues and
       friends, spoke of how he felt like a person of the world, and how he embrace the idea of OpenSource being
       for the benefit of the world.

       Anyone wishing to donate in memory of Andrew, please consider the following charities:
