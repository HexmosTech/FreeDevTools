</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Convert::PEM::CBC - Cipher Block Chaining Mode implementation

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Convert::PEM::CBC;
           my $cbc = Convert::PEM::CBC-&gt;new(
                                Cipher     =&gt; 'Crypt::DES_EDE3',
                                Passphrase =&gt; 'foo'
                  );

           my $plaintext = 'foo bar baz';
           $cbc-&gt;encrypt($plaintext);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Convert::PEM::CBC</u> implements the CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) mode for encryption/decryption ciphers; the
       CBC is designed for compatibility with OpenSSL and may not be compatible with other implementations (such
       as SSH).

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
   <b>$cbc</b> <b>=</b> <b>Convert::PEM::CBC-&gt;new(%args)</b>
       Creates a new <u>Convert::PEM::CBC</u> object and initializes it.  Returns the new object.

       <u>%args</u> can contain:

       •   Cipher

           Either  the  name  of  an encryption cipher class (eg. <u>Crypt::DES</u>), or an object already blessed into
           such a class. The class must support the <u>keysize</u>, <u>blocksize</u>, <u>encrypt</u>, and  <u>decrypt</u>  methods.  If  the
           value is a blessed object, it is assumed that the object has already been initialized with a key.

           This argument is mandatory.

       •   Passphrase

           A  passphrase  to  encrypt/decrypt the content. This is different in implementation from a key (<u>Key</u>),
           because it is assumed that a passphrase comes directly from a user,  and  must  be  munged  into  the
           correct form for a key. This "munging" is done by repeatedly computing an MD5 hash of the passphrase,
           the  IV,  and  the  existing  hash, until the generated key is longer than the keysize for the cipher
           (<u>Cipher</u>).

           Because of this "munging", this argument can be any length (even an empty string).

           If you give the <u>Cipher</u> argument an object, this argument is ignored. If  the  <u>Cipher</u>  argument  is  a
           cipher class, either this argument or <u>Key</u> must be provided.

       •   Key

           A  raw  key,  to  be passed directly to the new cipher object. Because this is passed directly to the
           cipher itself, the length of the key must be equal to or greater than the keysize for the <u>Cipher</u>.

           As with the <u>Passphrase</u> argument, if you  give  the  <u>Cipher</u>  argument  an  already-constructed  cipher
           object,  this  argument is ignored. If the <u>Cipher</u> argument is a cipher class, either this argument or
           <u>Passphrase</u> must be provided.

       •   IV

           The initialization vector for CBC mode.

           This argument is optional; if not provided, a random IV  will  be  generated.  Obviously,  if  you're
           decrypting  data,  you  should  provide  this  argument,  because your IV should match the IV used to
           encrypt the data.

   <b>$cbc-&gt;encrypt($plaintext)</b>
       Encrypts the plaintext <u>$plaintext</u> using the underlying cipher implementation in CBC mode, and returns the
       ciphertext.

       If any errors occur, returns <u>undef</u>, and you should check the <u>errstr</u> method to find out what went wrong.

   <b>$cbc-&gt;decrypt($ciphertext)</b>
       Decrypts the ciphertext <u>$ciphertext</u> using the underlying cipher implementation in CBC mode,  and  returns
       the plaintext.

       If any errors occur, returns <u>undef</u>, and you should check the <u>errstr</u> method to find out what went wrong.

   <b>$cbc-&gt;iv</b>
       Returns  the current initialization vector. One use for this might be to grab the initial value of the IV
       if it's created randomly (ie.  you haven't provided an <u>IV</u> argument to <u>new</u>):

           my $cbc = Convert::PEM::CBC-&gt;new( Cipher =&gt; $cipher );
           my $iv = $cbc-&gt;iv;   ## Generated randomly in 'new'.

       <u>Convert::PEM</u> uses this to write the IV to the PEM file when encrypting, so that  it  can  be  known  when
       trying to decrypt the file.

   <b>$cbc-&gt;errstr</b>
       Returns  the value of the last error that occurred. This should only be considered meaningful when you've
       received <u>undef</u> from one of the functions above; in all other cases its relevance is undefined.
