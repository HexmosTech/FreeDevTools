</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Net::CLI::Interact::Transport::Telnet - TELNET based CLI connection

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module provides a wrapped instance of a TELNET client for use by Net::CLI::Interact.

</pre><h4><b>INTERFACE</b></h4><pre>
   <b>app</b>
       On Windows platforms you <b>must</b> download the "plink.exe" program, and pass its location to the library in
       this parameter. On other platforms, this defaults to "telnet".

   <b>runtime_options</b>
       Based on the "connect_options" hash provided to Net::CLI::Interact on construction, selects and formats
       parameters to provide to "app" on the command line. Supported attributes:

       host (required)
           Host name or IP address of the host to which the TELNET application is to connect.

       port
           Port number on the host which is listening for the TELNET connection.  Defaults to 23.

       opts
           If  you  want to pass any other options to the Telnet application, then use this option, which should
           be an array reference.

           On Windows platforms, each item on the list will be passed to the "plink.exe" application,  separated
           by  a single space character. On Unix platforms, if depends whether you have IO::Pty installed (which
           in turn depends on a compiler).  Typically, the Net::Telnet library is used for  TELNET  connections,
           so  the  list  can  be  any  options  taken  by its "new()" constructor. Otherwise the local "telnet"
           application is used.

       reap
           Only used on Unix platforms, this installs a signal handler which attempts to reap  the  "ssh"  child
           process.  Pass a true value to enable this feature only if you notice zombie processes are being left
           behind after use.
