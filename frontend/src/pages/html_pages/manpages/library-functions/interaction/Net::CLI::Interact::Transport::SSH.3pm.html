</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Net::CLI::Interact::Transport::SSH - SSH based CLI connection

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module provides a wrapped instance of an SSH client for use by Net::CLI::Interact.

</pre><h4><b>INTERFACE</b></h4><pre>
   <b>app</b>
       On Windows platforms you <b>must</b> download the "plink.exe" program, and pass its location to the library in
       this parameter. On other platforms, this defaults to "ssh" (openssh).

   <b>runtime_options</b>
       Based on the "connect_options" hash provided to Net::CLI::Interact on construction, selects and formats
       parameters to provide to "app" on the command line. Supported attributes:

       host (required)
           Host name or IP address of the host to which the SSH application is to connect. Alternatively you can
           pass  a  value  of  the  form  "user@host",  but  it's probably better to use the separate "username"
           parameter instead.

       username
           Optionally pass in the username for the SSH connection, otherwise the  SSH  client  defaults  to  the
           current  user's  username.  When  using  this option, you should obviously <u>only</u> pass the host name to
           "host".

       ignore_host_checks
           Under normal interactive use "openssh" tracks the identity of  connected  hosts  and  verifies  these
           identities  upon  each  connection.  In  automation  this  behaviour  can be irritating because it is
           interactive.

           This option, enabled by default, causes "openssh" to skip or ignore this host identity  verification.
           This  means the default setting is less secure, but also less likely to trip you up. It is equivalent
           to the following:

            StrictHostKeyChecking=no
            UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null
            CheckHostIP=no

           Pass a false value to this option to disable the above and return "openssh" to its default configured
           settings.

       opts
           If you want to pass any other options to openssh on its command line, then  use  this  option,  which
           should  be  an  array  reference.  Each  item in the list will be passed to "openssh", separated by a
           single space character. For example:

            $s-&gt;new({
                # ...other parameters to new()...
                connect_options =&gt; {
                    opts =&gt; [
                        '-p', '222',            # connect to non-standard port on remote host
                        '-o', 'CheckHostIP=no', # don't check host IP in known_hosts file
                    ],
                },
            });

       reap
           Only used on Unix platforms, this installs a signal handler which attempts to reap  the  "ssh"  child
           process.  Pass a true value to enable this feature only if you notice zombie processes are being left
           behind after use.
