</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       File::Copy::Recursive::Reduced - Recursive copying of files and directories within Perl 5 toolchain

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use File::Copy::Recursive::Reduced qw(fcopy dircopy);

           fcopy($orig,$new) or die $!;

           dircopy($orig,$new) or die $!;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This library is intended as a not-quite-drop-in replacement for certain functionality provided by CPAN
       distribution File-Copy-Recursive &lt;<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/File-Copy-Recursive/">http://search.cpan.org/dist/File-Copy-Recursive/</a>&gt;.  The library
       provides methods similar enough to that distribution's fcopy(), dircopy() and rcopy() functions to be
       usable in those CPAN distributions often described as being part of the Perl toolchain.

   <b>Rationale</b>
       <u>File::Copy::Recursive</u> (hereinafter referred to as <b>FCR</b>) is heavily used in other CPAN libraries.  Out of
       over 30,000 other CPAN distributions studied in early 2018, it ranks by one calculation as the 129th
       highest distribution in terms of its total direct and indirect reverse dependencies.  In current
       parlance, it sits "high upstream on the CPAN river."  Hence, it ought to work correctly and be
       installable on all operating systems where Perl is well supported.

       However, as of early April 2018, FCR version 0.40 wass failing to pass its tests against either Perl 5.26
       or Perl 5 blead on important operating systems including Windows, FreeBSD and NetBSD
       (&lt;<a href="http://fast-matrix.cpantesters.org/">http://fast-matrix.cpantesters.org/</a>?dist=File-Copy-Recursive%200.40&gt;).  As a consequence, CPAN
       installers such as <u>cpan</u> and <u>cpanm</u> were failing to install it (unless one resorted to the "--force"
       option).  This prevented distributions dependent (directly or indirectly) on FCR from being installed as
       well.

       Some patches had been provided to the FCR bug tracker &lt;https://rt.cpan.org/Dist/Display.html?Name=File-
       Copy-Recursive&gt; for this problem.  However, as late as April 18 2018 those patches had not yet been
       applied.  This posed a critical problem for the ability to assess the impact of the soon-to-be-released
       perl-5.28.0 on CPAN distributions (the so-called "Blead Breaks CPAN" ("BBC") problem) on platforms other
       than Linux.

       <u>File::Copy::Recursive::Reduced</u> (hereinafter referred to as <b>FCR2</b>) is intended to provide a minimal subset
       of FCR's functionality -- just enough to get the Perl toolchain working on the platforms where FCR is
       currently failing.  Functions will be added to FCR2 only insofar as investigation shows that they can
       replace usage of FCR functions in toolchain and other heavily used modules.  No attempt will be made to
       reproduce all the functionality currently provided or claimed to be provided by FCR.

       On April 19 2018, FCR's author, Daniel Muey, released version 0.41 to CPAN.  This version included a
       patch submitted by Tom Hukins which corrected the problem addressed by FCR2.  FCR once again built and
       tested correctly on FreeBSD.  That meant that its 6000-plus reverse dependencies can once again be
       reached by <u>cpan</u> and other installers.  That in turn means that we can conduct exhaustive BBC
       investigations on FreeBSD and other platforms.

       With that correction in FCR, the original rationale for FCR2 has been superseded.  I will continue to
       maintain the code and respond to bug reports, but am suspending active development.  I now deem FCR2
       feature-complete.

</pre><h4><b>SUBROUTINES</b></h4><pre>
       The current version of FCR2 provides three exportable and publicly supported subroutines partially
       equivalent to the similarly named subroutines exported by FCR.

   <b>fcopy()</b>
       •   Purpose

           A stripped-down replacement for File::Copy::Recursive::fcopy().

           Copies  a  file  to  a  new  location,  recursively  creating  directories  as needed.  Does not copy
           directories.  Unlike File::Copy::copy(), fcopy() attempts to preserve the mode of the original file.

       •   Arguments

               fcopy($orig, $new) or die $!;

           List of two required arguments:

           •   Absolute path to the file being copied; and

           •   Absolute path to the location to which the file is being copied.

           Four cases should be noted:

           1 Create copy within same directory but new basename
                   fcopy('/path/to/filename', '/path/to/newfile');

               The second argument must be the absolute path to the new  file.   (Otherwise  the  file  will  be
               created in the current working directory, which is almost certainly what you do not want.)

           2 Create copy within different, already <b>existing</b> directory, same basename
                   fcopy('/path/to/filename', '/path/to/existing/directory');

               The   second   argument   can  be  merely  the  path  to  the  existing  directory;  will  create
               <u>/path/to/existing/directory/filename</u>.

           3 Create copy within different, not yet existing directory, same basename
                   fcopy('/path/to/filename', '/path/not/yet/existing/directory/filename');

               The second argument will be interpreted as the complete path to  the  newly  created  file.   The
               basename  must  be  included  even  if  it  is  the  same  as in the first argument.  Will create
               <u>/path/not/yet/existing/directory/filename</u>.

           4 Create copy within different, not yet existing directory, different basename
                   fcopy('/path/to/filename', '/path/not/yet/existing/directory/newfile');

               The second argument will be interpreted as the complete path to the  newly  created  file.   Will
               create <u>/path/not/yet/existing/directory/newfile</u>.

       •   Return Value

           Returns  1 upon success; 0 upon failure.  Returns an undefined value if, for example, function cannot
           validate arguments.

       •   Comment

           Since fcopy() internally uses File::Copy::copy() to perform the copying, the arguments are subject to
           the same qualifications as that function's arguments.  Call  <u>perldoc</u>  <u>File::Copy</u>  for  discussion  of
           those arguments.

   <b>dircopy()</b>
       •   Purpose

           A stripped-down replacement for File::Copy::Recursive::dircopy().

           Given the path to the directory specified by the first argument, the function copies all of the files
           and directories beneath it to the directory specified by the second argument.

       •   Arguments

               my $count = dircopy($orig, $new);
               warn "dircopy() returned undefined value" unless defined $count;

       •   Return Value

           Upon completion, returns the count of directories and files created -- which might be 0.

           Should  the  function  not  complete  (but  not  "die"),  an  undefined value will be returned.  That
           generally indicates problems with argument validation.  This approach is taken for  consistency  with
           File::Copy::Recursive::dircopy().

           In  list  context  the  return  value is a one-item list holding the same value as returned in scalar
           context.  The three-item list return value of File::Copy::Recursive::dircopy() is not supported.

       •   Restrictions

           None of "File::Copy::Recursive::dircopy"'s bells and whistles.  No guaranteed preservation of file or
           directory modes.  No restriction on maximum depth.  No nothing; this is fine-tuned to  the  needs  of
           Perl toolchain modules and their test suites.

   <b>rcopy()</b>
       •   Purpose

           A  stripped-down  replacement  for  File::Copy::Recursive::rcopy().   As  is  the  case with that FCR
           function, rcopy() is more or less a wrapper around fcopy() or dircopy(), depending on the  nature  of
           the first argument.

       •   Arguments

               rcopy($orig, $new) or die $!;

           List of two required arguments:

           •   Absolute path to the entity (file or directory) being copied; and

           •   Absolute path to the location to which the entity is being copied.

       •   Return Value

           Returns  1 upon success; 0 upon failure.  Returns an undefined value if, for example, function cannot
           validate arguments.

       •   Comment

           Please read the documentation for fcopy()  or  dircopy(),  depending  on  the  nature  of  the  first
           argument.

   <b>File::Copy::Recursive</b> <b>Subroutines</b> <b>Not</b> <b>Supported</b> <b>in</b> <b>File::Copy::Recursive::Reduced</b>
       As  of  the  current  version,  FCR2 has no publicly documented, exportable subroutines equivalent to the
       following FCR exportable subroutines:

           rcopy_glob
           fmove
           rmove
           rmove_glob
           dirmove
           pathempty
           pathrm
           pathrmdir

       Consideration is being given to supporting rcopy().

</pre><h4><b>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Notwithstanding  the  fact  that this distribution is being released to address certain problems in File-
       Copy-Recursive,     credit     must      be      given      to      FCR      author      Daniel      Muey
       &lt;<a href="http://www.cpan.org/authors/id/D/DM/DMUEY/">http://www.cpan.org/authors/id/D/DM/DMUEY/</a>&gt;  for ingenious conception and execution.  The implementation
       of the subroutines provided by FCR2 follows that found in FCR to a significant extent.

       Thanks also to Tom Hukins for supplying the patch which  corrects  FCR's  problems  and  which  has  been
       incorporated into FCR2 as well.

       Thanks  to Håkon Hægland for paying attention to how this library performs on Windows and other platforms
       to which the author does not have access.
