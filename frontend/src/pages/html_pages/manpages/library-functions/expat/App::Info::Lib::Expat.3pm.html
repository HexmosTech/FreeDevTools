</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       App::Info::Lib::Expat - Information about the Expat XML parser

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use App::Info::Lib::Expat;

         my $expat = App::Info::Lib::Expat-&gt;new;

         if ($expat-&gt;installed) {
             print "App name: ", $expat-&gt;name, "\n";
             print "Version:  ", $expat-&gt;version, "\n";
             print "Bin dir:  ", $expat-&gt;bin_dir, "\n";
         } else {
             print "Expat is not installed. :-(\n";
         }

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       App::Info::Lib::Expat supplies information about the Expat XML parser installed on the local system. It
       implements all of the methods defined by App::Info::Lib. Methods that trigger events will trigger them
       only the first time they're called (See App::Info for documentation on handling events). To start over
       (after, say, someone has installed Expat) construct a new App::Info::Lib::Expat object to aggregate new
       meta data.

       Some of the methods trigger the same events. This is due to cross-calling of shared subroutines. However,
       any one event should be triggered no more than once. For example, although the info event "Searching for
       'expat.h'" is documented for the methods "version()", "major_version()", "minor_version()", and
       "patch_version()", rest assured that it will only be triggered once, by whichever of those four methods
       is called first.

</pre><h4><b>INTERFACE</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Constructor</b>
       <u>new</u>

         my $expat = App::Info::Lib::Expat-&gt;new(@params);

       Returns an App::Info::Lib::Expat object. See App::Info for a complete description of argument parameters.

       When called, "new()" searches all of the paths returned by the "search_lib_dirs()" method for one of the
       files returned by the "search_lib_names()" method. If any of is found, then Expat is assumed to be
       installed. Otherwise, most of the object methods will return "undef".

       <b>Events:</b>

       info
           Searching for Expat libraries

       confirm
           Path to Expat library directory?

       unknown
           Path to Expat library directory?

   <b>Class</b> <b>Method</b>
       <u>key_name</u>

         my $key_name = App::Info::Lib::Expat-&gt;key_name;

       Returns the unique key name that describes this class. The value returned is the string "Expat".

   <b>Object</b> <b>Methods</b>
       <u>installed</u>

         print "Expat is ", ($expat-&gt;installed ? '' : 'not '),
           "installed.\n";

       Returns  true  if  Expat  is installed, and false if it is not.  App::Info::Lib::Expat determines whether
       Expat is installed based on the presence or absence on the file system of one of the files  searched  for
       when  "new()"  constructed  the  object. If Expat does not appear to be installed, then most of the other
       object methods will return empty values.

       <u>name</u>

         my $name = $expat-&gt;name;

       Returns the name of the application. In this case, "name()" simply returns the string "Expat".

       <u>version</u>

       Returns the full version number for Expat. App::Info::Lib::Expat attempts parse the version  number  from
       the <u>expat.h</u> file, if it exists.

       <b>Events:</b>

       info
           Searching for 'expat.h'

           Searching for include directory

       error
           Cannot find include directory

           Cannot find 'expat.h'

           Failed to parse version from 'expat.h'

       unknown
           Enter a valid Expat include directory

           Enter a valid Expat version number

       <u>major_version</u>

         my $major_version = $expat-&gt;major_version;

       Returns  the  Expat major version number. App::Info::Lib::Expat attempts to parse the version number from
       the <u>expat.h</u> file, if it exists. For example, if "version()" returns "1.95.2", then  this  method  returns
       "1".

       <b>Events:</b>

       info
           Searching for 'expat.h'

           Searching for include directory

       error
           Cannot find include directory

           Enter a valid Expat major version number

       <u>minor_version</u>

         my $minor_version = $expat-&gt;minor_version;

       Returns  the  Expat minor version number. App::Info::Lib::Expat attempts to parse the version number from
       the <u>expat.h</u> file, if it exists. For example, if "version()" returns "1.95.2", then  this  method  returns
       "95".

       <b>Events:</b>

       info
           Searching for 'expat.h'

           Searching for include directory

       error

       unknown
           Enter a valid Expat include directory

           Enter a valid Expat minor version number

       <u>patch_version</u>

         my $patch_version = $expat-&gt;patch_version;

       Returns  the  Expat patch version number. App::Info::Lib::Expat attempts to parse the version number from
       the <u>expat.h</u> file, if it exists. For example, "version()" returns "1.95.2", then this method returns "2".

       <b>Events:</b>

       info
           Searching for 'expat.h'

           Searching for include directory

       error
           Cannot find include directory

           Enter a valid Expat patch version number

       <u>bin_dir</u>

         my $bin_dir = $expat-&gt;bin_dir;

       Since Expat includes no binaries, this method always returns false.

       <u>executable</u>

         my $executable = $expat-&gt;executable;

       Since Expat includes no executable program, this method always returns false.

       <u>inc_dir</u>

         my $inc_dir = $expat-&gt;inc_dir;

       Returns the directory path in which the file  <u>expat.h</u>  was  found.   App::Info::Lib::Expat  searches  for
       <u>expat.h</u> in the following directories:

       <a href="file:/usr/local/include">/usr/local/include</a>
       <a href="file:/usr/include">/usr/include</a>
       /sw/include

         my $lib_dir = $expat-&gt;lib_dir;

       described for the "new" constructor, as are the events.

       <u>so_lib_dir</u>

         my $so_lib_dir = $expat-&gt;so_lib_dir;

       Returns the directory path in which a Expat shared object library was found.   It  searches  all  of  the
       paths in the "libsdirs" and "loclibpth" attributes defined by the Perl Config module -- plus <u>/sw/lib</u> (for
       all you Fink fans) -- for one of the following files:

       libexpat.so
       libexpat.so.0
       libexpat.so.0.0.1
       libexpat.dylib

       libexpat.so
       libexpat.so.0
       libexpat.so.0.0.1
       libexpat.dylib

         my @search_lib_dirs = $expat-&gt;search_lib_dirs;

       Returns  a  list  of possible directories in which to search for libraries. By default, it returns all of
       the paths in the "libsdirs" and "loclibpth" attributes defined by the Perl Config module -- plus  <u>/sw/lib</u>
       (in support of all you Fink users out there).

       <u>search_inc_names</u>

         my @search_inc_names = $expat-&gt;search_inc_names;

       Returns a list of include file names to search for. Used by "inc_dir()" to search for an include file. By
       default, the only name returned is <u>expat.h</u>.

       <u>search_inc_dirs</u>

         my @search_inc_dirs = $expat-&gt;search_inc_dirs;

       Returns  a  list  of  possible  directories in which to search for include files.  Used by "inc_dir()" to
       search for an include file. By default, the directories are:

       <a href="file:/usr/local/include">/usr/local/include</a>
       <a href="file:/usr/include">/usr/include</a>
       /sw/include

</pre><h4><b>KNOWN</b> <b>ISSUES</b></h4><pre>
       This is a pretty simple class. It's possible that there are more directories that ought  to  be  searched
       for libraries and includes. And if anyone knows how to get the version numbers, let me know!

       The format of the version number seems to have changed recently (1.95.1-2), and now I don't know where to
       find the version number. Patches welcome.
