       ExtUtils::Manifest - Utilities to write and check a MANIFEST file

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use ExtUtils::Manifest qw(...funcs to import...);

           mkmanifest();

           my @missing_files    = manicheck;
           my @skipped          = skipcheck;
           my @extra_files      = filecheck;
           my($missing, $extra) = fullcheck;

           my $found    = manifind();

           my $manifest = maniread();

           manicopy($read,$target);

           maniadd({$file =&gt; $comment, ...});

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       ...

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       ExtUtils::Manifest exports no functions by default.  The following are exported on request:

   <b>mkmanifest</b>
           mkmanifest();

       Writes all files in and below the current directory to your <u>MANIFEST</u>.  It works similar to the result of
       the Unix command

           find . &gt; MANIFEST

       All files that match any regular expression in a file <u>MANIFEST.SKIP</u> (if it exists) are ignored.

       Any existing <u>MANIFEST</u> file will be saved as <u>MANIFEST.bak</u>.

   <b>manifind</b>
           my $found = manifind();

       returns a hash reference. The keys of the hash are the files found below the current directory.

   <b>manicheck</b>
           my @missing_files = manicheck();

       checks if all the files within a "MANIFEST" in the current directory really do exist. If "MANIFEST" and
       the tree below the current directory are in sync it silently returns an empty list.  Otherwise it returns
       a list of files which are listed in the "MANIFEST" but missing from the directory, and by default also
       outputs these names to STDERR.

   <b>filecheck</b>
           my @extra_files = filecheck();

       finds files below the current directory that are not mentioned in the "MANIFEST" file. An optional file
       "MANIFEST.SKIP" will be consulted. Any file matching a regular expression in such a file will not be
       reported as missing in the "MANIFEST" file. The list of any extraneous files found is returned, and by
       default also reported to STDERR.

   <b>fullcheck</b>
           my($missing, $extra) = fullcheck();

       does both a <b>manicheck()</b> and a <b>filecheck()</b>, returning then as two array refs.

   <b>skipcheck</b>
           my @skipped = skipcheck();

       lists all the files that are skipped due to your "MANIFEST.SKIP" file.

   <b>maniread</b>
           my $manifest = maniread();
           my $manifest = maniread($manifest_file);

       reads a named "MANIFEST" file (defaults to "MANIFEST" in the current directory) and returns a HASH
       reference with files being the keys and comments being the values of the HASH.  Blank lines and lines
       which start with "#" in the "MANIFEST" file are discarded.

   <b>maniskip</b>
           my $skipchk = maniskip();
           my $skipchk = maniskip($manifest_skip_file);

           if ($skipchk-&gt;($file)) { .. }

       reads a named "MANIFEST.SKIP" file (defaults to "MANIFEST.SKIP" in the current directory) and returns a
       CODE reference that tests whether a given filename should be skipped.

   <b>manicopy</b>
           manicopy(\%src, $dest_dir);
           manicopy(\%src, $dest_dir, $how);

       Copies the files that are the keys in %src to the $dest_dir.  %src is typically returned by the
       <b>maniread()</b> function.

           manicopy( maniread(), $dest_dir );

       This function is useful for producing a directory tree identical to the intended distribution tree.

       $how can be used to specify a different methods of "copying".  Valid values are "cp", which actually
       copies the files, "ln" which creates hard links, and "best" which mostly links the files but copies any
       symbolic link to make a tree without any symbolic link.  "cp" is the default.

   <b>maniadd</b>
         maniadd({ $file =&gt; $comment, ...});

       Adds an entry to an existing <u>MANIFEST</u> unless its already there.

       $file will be normalized (ie. Unixified).  <b>UNIMPLEMENTED</b>

   <b>MANIFEST</b>
       A list of files in the distribution, one file per line.  The MANIFEST always uses Unix filepath
       conventions even if you're not on Unix.  This means <u>foo/bar</u> style not <u>foo\bar</u>.

       Anything between white space and an end of line within a "MANIFEST" file is considered to be a comment.
       Any line beginning with # is also a comment. Beginning with ExtUtils::Manifest 1.52, a filename may
       contain whitespace characters if it is enclosed in single quotes; single quotes or backslashes in that
       filename must be backslash-escaped.

           # this a comment
           some/file
           some/other/file            comment about some/file
           'some/third file'          comment

   <b>MANIFEST.SKIP</b>
       The file MANIFEST.SKIP may contain regular expressions of files that should be ignored by <b>mkmanifest()</b>
       and <b>filecheck()</b>. The regular expressions should appear one on each line. Blank lines and lines which
       start with "#" are skipped.  Use "\#" if you need a regular expression to start with a "#".

       For example:

           # Version control files and dirs.
           \bRCS\b
           \bCVS\b
           ,v$
           \B\.svn\b

           # Makemaker generated files and dirs.
           ^MANIFEST\.
           ^Makefile$
           ^blib/
           ^MakeMaker-\d

           # Temp, old and emacs backup files.
           ~$
           \.old$
           ^#.*#$
           ^\.#

       If no MANIFEST.SKIP file is found, a default set of skips will be used, similar to the example above.  If
       you want nothing skipped, simply make an empty MANIFEST.SKIP file.

       In one's own MANIFEST.SKIP file, certain directives can be used to include the contents of other
       MANIFEST.SKIP files. At present two such directives are recognized.

       #!include_default
           This  tells ExtUtils::Manifest to read the default <u>MANIFEST.SKIP</u> file and skip files accordingly, but
           <u>not</u> to include it in the local <u>MANIFEST.SKIP</u>. This is intended to skip files according  to  a  system
           default,  which  can  change  over  time  without  requiring  further  changes  to the distribution's
           <u>MANIFEST.SKIP</u>.

       #!include /Path/to/another/manifest.skip
           This inserts the contents of the specified external file in the local <u>MANIFEST.SKIP</u>. This is intended
           for authors to have a central <u>MANIFEST.SKIP</u> file, and to include it with their various distributions.

       The included contents  will  be  inserted  into  the  MANIFEST.SKIP  file  in  between  <u>#!start</u>  <u>included</u>
       <u>/path/to/manifest.skip</u>  and <u>#!end</u> <u>included</u> <u>/path/to/manifest.skip</u> markers.  The original MANIFEST.SKIP is
       saved as MANIFEST.SKIP.bak.

   <b>EXPORT_OK</b>
       &amp;mkmanifest, &amp;manicheck, &amp;filecheck, &amp;fullcheck, &amp;maniread, and &amp;manicopy are exportable.

   <b>GLOBAL</b> <b>VARIABLES</b>
       $ExtUtils::Manifest::MANIFEST defaults to "MANIFEST". Changing it results in both a different  "MANIFEST"
       and  a different "MANIFEST.SKIP" file. This is useful if you want to maintain different distributions for
       different audiences (say a user version and a developer version including RCS).

       $ExtUtils::Manifest::Quiet defaults to 0. If set to a true value, all functions act silently.

       $ExtUtils::Manifest::Debug defaults to 0.  If set to a true value, or if PERL_MM_MANIFEST_DEBUG is  true,
       debugging output will be produced.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       All diagnostic output is sent to "STDERR".

       "Not in MANIFEST:" <u>file</u>
           is reported if a file is found which is not in "MANIFEST".

       "Skipping" <u>file</u>
           is reported if a file is skipped due to an entry in "MANIFEST.SKIP".

       "No such file:" <u>file</u>
           is reported if a file mentioned in a "MANIFEST" file does not exist.

       "MANIFEST:" <u>$!</u>
           is reported if "MANIFEST" could not be opened.

       "Added to MANIFEST:" <u>file</u>
           is  reported by <b>mkmanifest()</b> if $Verbose is set and a file is added to MANIFEST. $Verbose is set to 1
           by default.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>PERL_MM_MANIFEST_DEBUG</b>
           Turns on debugging

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       ExtUtils::MakeMaker which has handy targets for most of the functionality.
