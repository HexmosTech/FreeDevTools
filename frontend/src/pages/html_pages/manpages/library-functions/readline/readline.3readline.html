       readline - get a line from a user with editing

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/stdio.h">stdio.h</a>&gt;</b>
       <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;readline/readline.h&gt;</b>
       <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;readline/history.h&gt;</b>

       <u>char</u> <u>*</u>
       <b>readline</b> (<u>const</u> <u>char</u> <u>*prompt</u>);

</pre><h4><b>COPYRIGHT</b></h4><pre>
       Readline is Copyright (C) 1989-2025 Free Software Foundation,  Inc.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>readline</b>  reads  a  line from the terminal and return it, using <b>prompt</b> as a prompt.  If <b>prompt</b> is <b>NULL</b> or
       the empty string, <b>readline</b> does not issue a prompt.  The line returned is allocated with  <u><a href="../man3/malloc.3.html">malloc</a></u>(3);  the
       caller  must free it when finished.  The line returned has the final newline removed, so only the text of
       the line remains.  Since it's possible to enter characters into the line while quoting  them  to  disable
       any <b>readline</b> editing function they might normally have, this line may include embedded newlines and other
       special characters.

       <b>readline</b>  offers  editing capabilities while the user is entering the line.  By default, the line editing
       commands are similar to those of emacs.  A vi-style line editing interface is also available.

       This manual page describes only the most basic use of <b>readline</b>.  Much more  functionality  is  available;
       see <u>The</u> <u>GNU</u> <u>Readline</u> <u>Library</u> and <u>The</u> <u>GNU</u> <u>History</u> <u>Library</u> for additional information.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       <b>readline</b>  returns  the  text  of  the  line  read.   A  blank  line  returns the empty string.  If <b>EOF</b> is
       encountered while reading a line, and the line is empty, <b>readline</b> returns <b>NULL</b>.  If an <b>EOF</b> is read with a
       non-empty line, it is treated as a newline.

</pre><h4><b>NOTATION</b></h4><pre>
       This section uses Emacs-style editing concepts and uses its notation for keystrokes.   Control  keys  are
       denoted  by  C-<u>key</u>,  e.g.,  C-n means Control-N.  Similarly, <u>meta</u> keys are denoted by M-<u>key</u>, so M-x means
       Meta-X.  The Meta key is often labeled “Alt” or “Option”.

       On keyboards without a <u>Meta</u> key, M-<u>x</u> means ESC <u>x</u>, i.e., press and release the Escape key, then press  and
       release  the  <u>x</u>  key,  in  sequence.   This  makes  ESC the <u>meta</u> <u>prefix</u>.  The combination M-C-<u>x</u> means ESC
       Control-<u>x</u>: press and release the Escape key, then press and hold the Control key  while  pressing  the  <u>x</u>
       key, then release both.

       On some keyboards, the Meta key modifier produces characters with the eighth bit (0200) set.  You can use
       the  <b>enable-meta-key</b> variable to control whether or not it does this, if the keyboard allows it.  On many
       others, the terminal or terminal emulator converts the metafied key to a key sequence beginning with  ESC
       as described in the preceding paragraph.

       If  your  <u>Meta</u>  key produces a key sequence with the ESC meta prefix, you can make M-<u>key</u> key bindings you
       specify (see <b>Readline</b> <b>Key</b> <b>Bindings</b> below) do the same thing by setting the <b>force-meta-prefix</b> variable.

       <b>Readline</b> commands may be given numeric <u>arguments</u>, which normally  act  as  a  repeat  count.   Sometimes,
       however,  it  is  the sign of the argument that is significant.  Passing a negative argument to a command
       that acts in the forward direction (e.g., <b>kill-line</b>) makes that command  act  in  a  backward  direction.
       Commands whose behavior with arguments deviates from this are noted below.

       The  <u>point</u>  is the current cursor position, and <u>mark</u> refers to a saved cursor position.  The text between
       the point and mark is referred to as the <u>region</u>.

       When a command is described as <u>killing</u> text, the text deleted is  saved  for  possible  future  retrieval
       (<u>yanking</u>).   The killed text is saved in a <u>kill</u> <u>ring</u>.  Consecutive kills accumulate the deleted text into
       one unit, which can be yanked all at once.  Commands which do not kill text separate the chunks  of  text
       on the kill ring.

</pre><h4><b>INITIALIZATION</b> <b>FILE</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Readline</b>  is  customized  by  putting commands in an initialization file (the <u>inputrc</u> file).  The name of
       this file is taken from the value of the <b>INPUTRC</b> environment variable.  If that variable  is  unset,  the
       default  is <u><a href="file:~/.inputrc">~/.inputrc</a></u>.  If that file  does not exist or cannot be read, <b>readline</b> looks for <u><a href="file:/etc/inputrc">/etc/inputrc</a></u>.
       When a program that uses the <b>readline</b> library starts up, <b>readline</b> reads the initialization file and  sets
       the key bindings and variables found there, before reading any user input.

       There  are  only  a  few  basic  constructs allowed in the inputrc file.  Blank lines are ignored.  Lines
       beginning with a <b>#</b> are comments.  Lines beginning with a <b>$</b> indicate conditional constructs.  Other  lines
       denote key bindings and variable settings.

       The  default key-bindings in this document may be changed using key binding commands in the <u>inputrc</u> file.
       Programs that use this library may add their own commands and bindings.

       For example, placing

              M-Control-u: universal-argument
       or
              C-Meta-u: universal-argument

       into the <u>inputrc</u> would make M-C-u execute the <b>readline</b> command <u>universal-argument</u>.

       Key bindings may contain the following symbolic character names: <u>DEL</u>, <u>ESC</u>,  <u>ESCAPE</u>,  <u>LFD</u>,  <u>NEWLINE</u>,  <u>RET</u>,
       <u>RETURN</u>, <u>RUBOUT</u> (a destructive backspace), <u>SPACE</u>, <u>SPC</u>, and <u>TAB</u>.

       In  addition to command names, <b>readline</b> allows keys to be bound to a string that is inserted when the key
       is pressed (a <u>macro</u>).  The difference between a macro and a command is that a macro is enclosed in single
       or double quotes.

   <b>Key</b> <b>Bindings</b>
       The syntax for controlling key bindings in the <u>inputrc</u> file is simple.  All that is required is the  name
       of  the  command or the text of a macro and a key sequence to which it should be bound.  The key sequence
       may be specified in one of two ways: as a symbolic key name, possibly with <u>Meta-</u> or <u>Control-</u> prefixes, or
       as a key sequence composed of one or more characters enclosed in double quotes.   The  key  sequence  and
       name are separated by a colon.  There can be no whitespace between the name and the colon.

       When  using the form <b>keyname</b>:<u>function-name</u> or <u>macro</u>, <u>keyname</u> is the name of a key spelled out in English.
       For example:

              Control-u: universal-argument
              Meta-Rubout: backward-kill-word
              Control-o: "&gt; output"

       In the above example, <u>C-u</u> is bound to the function <b>universal-argument</b>, <u>M-DEL</u> is  bound  to  the  function
       <b>backward-kill-word</b>,  and  <u>C-o</u>  is  bound  to  run the macro expressed on the right hand side (that is, to
       insert the text “&gt; output” into the line).

       In the second form, <b>"keyseq"</b>:<u>function-name</u> or <u>macro</u>, <b>keyseq</b> differs from <b>keyname</b> above  in  that  strings
       denoting  an entire key sequence may be specified by placing the sequence within double quotes.  Some GNU
       Emacs style key escapes can be used, as in the following example, but  none  of  the  symbolic  character
       names are recognized.

              "\C-u": universal-argument
              "\C-x\C-r": re-read-init-file
              "\e[11~": "Function Key 1"

       In this example, <u>C-u</u> is again bound to the function <b>universal-argument</b>.  <u>C-x</u> <u>C-r</u> is bound to the function
       <b>re-read-init-file</b>, and <u>ESC</u> <u>[</u> <u>1</u> <u>1</u> <u>~</u> is bound to insert the text “Function Key 1”.

       The full set of GNU Emacs style escape sequences available when specifying key sequences is
              <b>\C-</b>    A control prefix.
              <b>\M-</b>    Adding  the  meta  prefix  or  converting  the  following character to a meta character, as
                     described below under <b>force-meta-prefix</b>.
              <b>\e</b>     An escape character.
              <b>\\</b>     Backslash.
              <b>\"</b>     Literal ", a double quote.
              <b>\'</b>     Literal ', a single quote.

       In addition to the GNU Emacs style escape sequences, a second set of backslash escapes is available:
              <b>\a</b>     alert (bell)
              <b>\b</b>     backspace
              <b>\d</b>     delete
              <b>\f</b>     form feed
              <b>\n</b>     newline
              <b>\r</b>     carriage return
              <b>\t</b>     horizontal tab
              <b>\v</b>     vertical tab
              <b>\</b><u>nnn</u>   The eight-bit character whose value is the octal value <u>nnn</u> (one to three digits).
              <b>\x</b><u>HH</u>   The eight-bit character whose value is the hexadecimal value <u>HH</u> (one or two hex digits).

       When entering the text of a macro, single or double quotes must be used to indicate a  macro  definition.
       Unquoted  text  is  assumed to be a function name.  The backslash escapes described above are expanded in
       the macro body.  Backslash quotes any other character in the macro text, including " and '.

       <b>Bash</b> will display or modify the current <b>readline</b> key bindings with the  <b>bind</b>  builtin  command.   The  <b>-o</b>
       <b>emacs</b> or <b>-o</b> <b>vi</b> options to the <b>set</b> builtin change the editing mode during interactive use.  Other programs
       using this library provide similar mechanisms.  A user may always edit the <u>inputrc</u> file and have <b>readline</b>
       re-read it if a program does not provide any other means to incorporate new bindings.

   <b>Variables</b>
       <b>Readline</b>  has variables that can be used to further customize its behavior.  A variable may be set in the
       <u>inputrc</u> file with a statement of the form

              <b>set</b> <u>variable-name</u> <u>value</u>

       Except where noted, <b>readline</b> variables  can  take  the  values  <b>On</b>  or  <b>Off</b>  (without  regard  to  case).
       Unrecognized  variable  names  are  ignored.  When <b>readline</b> reads a variable value, empty or null values,
       “on” (case-insensitive), and “1” are equivalent to <b>On</b>.  All other values are equivalent to <b>Off</b>.

       The variables and their default values are:

       <b>active-region-start-color</b>
              A string variable that controls the text color and background when  displaying  the  text  in  the
              active  region  (see the description of <b>enable-active-region</b> below).  This string must not take up
              any physical character positions on the display, so it should  consist  only  of  terminal  escape
              sequences.   It  is  output to the terminal before displaying the text in the active region.  This
              variable is reset to the default value whenever the terminal type changes.  The default  value  is
              the  string  that  puts  the  terminal  in standout mode, as obtained from the terminal's terminfo
              description.  A sample value might be “\e[01;33m”.
       <b>active-region-end-color</b>
              A string variable that “undoes” the effects of  <b>active-region-start-color</b>  and  restores  “normal”
              terminal display appearance after displaying text in the active region.  This string must not take
              up  any  physical character positions on the display, so it should consist only of terminal escape
              sequences.  It is output to the terminal after displaying the text in  the  active  region.   This
              variable  is  reset to the default value whenever the terminal type changes.  The default value is
              the string that restores the terminal from standout mode, as obtained from the terminal's terminfo
              description.  A sample value might be “\e[0m”.
       <b>bell-style</b> <b>(audible)</b>
              Controls what happens when <b>readline</b> wants to ring the terminal bell.  If  set  to  <b>none</b>,  <b>readline</b>
              never  rings  the  bell.  If set to <b>visible</b>, <b>readline</b> uses a visible bell if one is available.  If
              set to <b>audible</b>, <b>readline</b> attempts to ring the terminal's bell.
       <b>bind-tty-special-chars</b> <b>(On)</b>
              If set to <b>On</b>, <b>readline</b> attempts to bind the control characters that are treated specially  by  the
              kernel's  terminal  driver  to  their  <b>readline</b>  equivalents.  These override the default <b>readline</b>
              bindings described here.  Type “stty -a” at a <b>bash</b> prompt to see your current  terminal  settings,
              including the special control characters (usually <b>cchars</b>).
       <b>blink-matching-paren</b> <b>(Off)</b>
              If  set  to  <b>On</b>,  <b>readline</b>  attempts  to  briefly move the cursor to an opening parenthesis when a
              closing parenthesis is inserted.
       <b>colored-completion-prefix</b> <b>(Off)</b>
              If set to <b>On</b>, when listing completions, <b>readline</b> displays the common prefix of the set of possible
              completions using a different color.  The color definitions  are  taken  from  the  value  of  the
              <b>LS_COLORS</b>  environment  variable.   If  there  is  a color definition in <b>$LS_COLORS</b> for the custom
              suffix “readline-colored-completion-prefix”, <b>readline</b>  uses  this  color  for  the  common  prefix
              instead of its default.
       <b>colored-stats</b> <b>(Off)</b>
              If set to <b>On</b>, <b>readline</b> displays possible completions using different colors to indicate their file
              type.  The color definitions are taken from the value of the <b>LS_COLORS</b> environment variable.
       <b>comment-begin</b> <b>(</b>“<b>#</b>”<b>)</b>
              The  string  that  the  <b>readline</b>  <b>insert-comment</b> command inserts.  This command is bound to <b>M-#</b> in
              emacs mode and to <b>#</b> in vi command mode.
       <b>completion-display-width</b> <b>(-1)</b>
              The number of screen columns used to display possible matches  when  performing  completion.   The
              value  is  ignored  if  it is less than 0 or greater than the terminal screen width.  A value of 0
              causes matches to be displayed one per line.  The default value is -1.
       <b>completion-ignore-case</b> <b>(Off)</b>
              If set to <b>On</b>, <b>readline</b> performs filename matching and completion in a case-insensitive fashion.
       <b>completion-map-case</b> <b>(Off)</b>
              If set to <b>On</b>, and <b>completion-ignore-case</b> is enabled, <b>readline</b> treats hyphens (<u>-</u>)  and  underscores
              (<b>_</b>) as equivalent when performing case-insensitive filename matching and completion.
       <b>completion-prefix-display-length</b> <b>(0)</b>
              The  maximum  length  in characters of the common prefix of a list of possible completions that is
              displayed without modification.  When set to a value greater than zero, <b>readline</b>  replaces  common
              prefixes  longer  than  this  value  with  an ellipsis when displaying possible completions.  If a
              completion begins with a period, and <b>eadline</b> is completing filenames, it  uses  three  underscores
              instead of an ellipsis.
       <b>completion-query-items</b> <b>(100)</b>
              This  determines  when  the  user  is  queried  about  viewing  the number of possible completions
              generated by the <b>possible-completions</b> command.  It may be set to any integer value greater than or
              equal to zero.  If the number of possible completions is greater than or equal  to  the  value  of
              this  variable,  <b>readline</b>  asks  whether  or  not the user wishes to view them; otherwise <b>readline</b>
              simply lists them on the terminal.  A zero value means <b>readline</b> should never ask; negative  values
              are treated as zero.
       <b>convert-meta</b> <b>(On)</b>
              If  set  to <b>On</b>, <b>readline</b> converts characters it reads that have the eighth bit set to an ASCII key
              sequence by clearing the eighth bit and prefixing it with  an  escape  character  (converting  the
              character  to have the meta prefix).  The default is <u>On</u>, but <b>readline</b> sets it to <u>Off</u> if the locale
              contains characters whose encodings may include bytes with the eighth bit set.  This  variable  is
              dependent  on  the  <b>LC_CTYPE</b> locale category, and may change if the locale changes.  This variable
              also affects key bindings; see the description of <b>force-meta-prefix</b> below.
       <b>disable-completion</b> <b>(Off)</b>
              If set to <b>On</b>, <b>readline</b> inhibits word completion.  Completion characters are inserted into the line
              as if they had been mapped to <b>self-insert</b>.
       <b>echo-control-characters</b> <b>(On)</b>
              When set to <b>On</b>, on operating systems that indicate they support it, <b>readline</b>  echoes  a  character
              corresponding to a signal generated from the keyboard.
       <b>editing-mode</b> <b>(emacs)</b>
              Controls  whether <b>readline</b> uses a set of key bindings similar to <u>Emacs</u> or <u>vi</u>.  <b>editing-mode</b> can be
              set to either <b>emacs</b> or <b>vi</b>.
       <b>emacs-mode-string</b> <b>(@)</b>
              If the <u>show-mode-in-prompt</u> variable is enabled, this string is displayed  immediately  before  the
              last  line  of the primary prompt when emacs editing mode is active.  The value is expanded like a
              key binding, so the standard set of meta- and control- prefixes and backslash escape sequences  is
              available.  The \1 and \2 escapes begin and end sequences of non-printing characters, which can be
              used to embed a terminal control sequence into the mode string.
       <b>enable-active-region</b> <b>(On)</b>
              When  this  variable  is  set  to  <u>On</u>, <b>readline</b> allows certain commands to designate the region as
              <u>active</u>.  When the region is active, <b>readline</b> highlights the text in the region using the value  of
              the  <b>active-region-start-color</b>  variable, which defaults to the string that enables the terminal's
              standout mode.  The active region shows the text inserted by bracketed-paste and any matching text
              found by incremental and non-incremental history searches.
       <b>enable-bracketed-paste</b> <b>(On)</b>
              When set to <b>On</b>, <b>readline</b> configures the terminal to insert each paste into the editing buffer as a
              single string of characters, instead of treating each character as if it had been  read  from  the
              keyboard.   This  is  called <u>bracketed-paste</u> <u>mode</u>; it prevents <b>readline</b> from executing any editing
              commands bound to key sequences appearing in the pasted text.
       <b>enable-keypad</b> <b>(Off)</b>
              When set to <b>On</b>, <b>readline</b> tries to enable the application keypad when it is called.   Some  systems
              need this to enable the arrow keys.
       <b>enable-meta-key</b> <b>(On)</b>
              When set to <b>On</b>, <b>readline</b> tries to enable any meta modifier key the terminal claims to support.  On
              many  terminals,  the  Meta key is used to send eight-bit characters; this variable checks for the
              terminal capability that indicates the terminal can enable and disable a mode that sets the eighth
              bit of a character (0200) if the Meta key is held  down  when  the  character  is  typed  (a  meta
              character).
       <b>expand-tilde</b> <b>(Off)</b>
              If set to <b>On</b>, <b>readline</b> performs tilde expansion when it attempts word completion.
       <b>force-meta-prefix</b> <b>(Off)</b>
              If  set  to  <b>On</b>, <b>readline</b> modifies its behavior when binding key sequences containing \M- or Meta-
              (see <b>Key</b> <b>Bindings</b> above) by converting a key sequence of the form  \M-<u>C</u>  or  Meta-<u>C</u>  to  the  two-
              character  sequence  <b>ESC</b>  <u>C</u>  (adding  the  meta  prefix).  If <b>force-meta-prefix</b> is set to <b>Off</b> (the
              default), <b>readline</b> uses the value of the <b>convert-meta</b> variable to  determine  whether  to  perform
              this conversion: if <b>convert-meta</b> is <b>On</b>, <b>readline</b> performs the conversion described above; if it is
              <b>Off</b>, <b>readline</b> converts <u>C</u> to a meta character by setting the eighth bit (0200).
       <b>history-preserve-point</b> <b>(Off)</b>
              If  set  to <b>On</b>, the history code attempts to place point at the same location on each history line
              retrieved with <b>previous-history</b> or <b>next-history</b>.
       <b>history-size</b> <b>(unset)</b>
              Set the maximum number of history entries saved in the history list.  If set to zero, any existing
              history entries are deleted and no new entries are saved.  If set to a value less than  zero,  the
              number  of  history  entries  is  not  limited.   By default, the number of history entries is not
              limited.  Setting <u>history-size</u> to a non-numeric value will  set  the  maximum  number  of  history
              entries to 500.
       <b>horizontal-scroll-mode</b> <b>(Off)</b>
              Setting  this  variable  to  <b>On</b>  makes <b>readline</b> use a single line for display, scrolling the input
              horizontally on a single screen line when it becomes longer than  the  screen  width  rather  than
              wrapping to a new line.  This setting is automatically enabled for terminals of height 1.
       <b>input-meta</b> <b>(Off)</b>
              If  set  to <b>On</b>, <b>readline</b> enables eight-bit input (that is, it does not clear the eighth bit in the
              characters it reads), regardless of what the terminal claims it can support.  The default is  <u>Off</u>,
              but  <b>readline</b>  sets  it  to <u>On</u> if the locale contains characters whose encodings may include bytes
              with the eighth bit set.  This variable is dependent on the  <b>LC_CTYPE</b>  locale  category,  and  its
              value may change if the locale changes.  The name <b>meta-flag</b> is a synonym for <b>input-meta</b>.
       <b>isearch-terminators</b> <b>(</b>“<b>C-[C-j</b>”<b>)</b>
              The  string  of  characters  that  should  terminate  an  incremental  search without subsequently
              executing the character as a command.  If this variable has not been given a value, the characters
              <u>ESC</u> and <b>C-j</b> terminate an incremental search.
       <b>keymap</b> <b>(emacs)</b>
              Set the current <b>readline</b> keymap.   The  set  of  valid  keymap  names  is  <u>emacs,</u>  <u>emacs-standard,</u>
              <u>emacs-meta,</u>  <u>emacs-ctlx,</u>  <u>vi,</u> <u>vi-command</u>, and <u>vi-insert</u>.  <u>vi</u> is equivalent to <u>vi-command</u>; <u>emacs</u> is
              equivalent to <u>emacs-standard</u>.  The default value is <u>emacs</u>; the value of <b>editing-mode</b> also  affects
              the default keymap.
       <b>keyseq-timeout</b> <b>(500)</b>
              Specifies  the  duration <b>readline</b> will wait for a character when reading an ambiguous key sequence
              (one that can form a complete key sequence using the input read so far,  or  can  take  additional
              input  to  complete  a  longer  key  sequence).  If <b>readline</b> does not receive any input within the
              timeout, it uses the shorter but complete key sequence.  The value is specified  in  milliseconds,
              so  a  value  of  1000  means  that  <b>readline</b>  will wait one second for additional input.  If this
              variable is set to a value less than or equal to zero, or to a non-numeric value,  <b>readline</b>  waits
              until another key is pressed to decide which key sequence to complete.
       <b>mark-directories</b> <b>(On)</b>
              If set to <b>On</b>, completed directory names have a slash appended.
       <b>mark-modified-lines</b> <b>(Off)</b>
              If  set  to  <b>On</b>, <b>readline</b> displays history lines that have been modified with a preceding asterisk
              (<b>*</b>).
       <b>mark-symlinked-directories</b> <b>(Off)</b>
              If set to <b>On</b>, completed names which are symbolic links  to  directories  have  a  slash  appended,
              subject to the value of <b>mark-directories</b>.
       <b>match-hidden-files</b> <b>(On)</b>
              This  variable,  when  set  to  <b>On</b>,  forces  <b>readline</b>  to match files whose names begin with a “.”
              (hidden files) when performing filename completion.  If set to <b>Off</b>,  the  user  must  include  the
              leading “.”  in the filename to be completed.
       <b>menu-complete-display-prefix</b> <b>(Off)</b>
              If  set  to  <b>On</b>,  menu  completion  displays the common prefix of the list of possible completions
              (which may be empty) before cycling through the list.
       <b>output-meta</b> <b>(Off)</b>
              If set to <b>On</b>, <b>readline</b> displays characters with the eighth bit set directly rather than as a meta-
              prefixed escape sequence.  The default is <u>Off</u>, but <b>readline</b> sets it to <u>On</u> if the  locale  contains
              characters  whose encodings may include bytes with the eighth bit set.  This variable is dependent
              on the <b>LC_CTYPE</b> locale category, and its value may change if the locale changes.
       <b>page-completions</b> <b>(On)</b>
              If set to <b>On</b>, <b>readline</b> uses an internal  pager  resembling  <u><a href="../man1/more.1.html">more</a></u>(1)  to  display  a  screenful  of
              possible completions at a time.
       <b>prefer-visible-bell</b>
              See <b>bell-style</b>.
       <b>print-completions-horizontally</b> <b>(Off)</b>
              If  set  to  <b>On</b>,  <b>readline</b>  displays  completions with matches sorted horizontally in alphabetical
              order, rather than down the screen.
       <b>revert-all-at-newline</b> <b>(Off)</b>
              If set to <b>On</b>, <b>readline</b> will undo all changes to history  lines  before  returning  when  executing
              <b>accept-line</b>.   By  default,  history lines may be modified and retain individual undo lists across
              calls to <b>readline()</b>.
       <b>search-ignore-case</b> <b>(Off)</b>
              If set to <b>On</b>, <b>readline</b> performs  incremental  and  non-incremental  history  list  searches  in  a
              case-insensitive fashion.
       <b>show-all-if-ambiguous</b> <b>(Off)</b>
              This alters the default behavior of the completion functions.  If set to <b>On</b>, words which have more
              than  one  possible  completion  cause the matches to be listed immediately instead of ringing the
              bell.
       <b>show-all-if-unmodified</b> <b>(Off)</b>
              This  alters  the  default  behavior  of  the  completion  functions  in  a  fashion  similar   to
              <b>show-all-if-ambiguous</b>.   If  set to <b>On</b>, words which have more than one possible completion without
              any possible partial completion (the possible completions don't share a common prefix)  cause  the
              matches to be listed immediately instead of ringing the bell.
       <b>show-mode-in-prompt</b> <b>(Off)</b>
              If  set  to <b>On</b>, add a string to the beginning of the prompt indicating the editing mode: emacs, vi
              command, or vi insertion.  The mode strings are user-settable (e.g., <u>emacs-mode-string</u>).
       <b>skip-completed-text</b> <b>(Off)</b>
              If set to <b>On</b>, this alters the default completion behavior when inserting a single match  into  the
              line.   It's only active when performing completion in the middle of a word.  If enabled, <b>readline</b>
              does not insert characters from the completion that match characters after point in the word being
              completed, so portions of the word following the cursor are not duplicated.
       <b>vi-cmd-mode-string</b> <b>((cmd))</b>
              If the <u>show-mode-in-prompt</u> variable is enabled, this string is displayed  immediately  before  the
              last  line of the primary prompt when vi editing mode is active and in command mode.  The value is
              expanded like a key binding, so the standard set of meta-  and  control-  prefixes  and  backslash
              escape  sequences  is  available.   The  \1 and \2 escapes begin and end sequences of non-printing
              characters, which can be used to embed a terminal control sequence into the mode string.
       <b>vi-ins-mode-string</b> <b>((ins))</b>
              If the <u>show-mode-in-prompt</u> variable is enabled, this string is displayed  immediately  before  the
              last  line  of the primary prompt when vi editing mode is active and in insertion mode.  The value
              is expanded like a key binding, so the standard set of meta- and control- prefixes  and  backslash
              escape  sequences  is  available.   The  \1 and \2 escapes begin and end sequences of non-printing
              characters, which can be used to embed a terminal control sequence into the mode string.
       <b>visible-stats</b> <b>(Off)</b>
              If set to <b>On</b>, a character denoting a file's type  as  reported  by  <u><a href="../man2/stat.2.html">stat</a></u>(2)  is  appended  to  the
              filename when listing possible completions.

   <b>Conditional</b> <b>Constructs</b>
       <b>Readline</b>  implements  a  facility  similar  in  spirit  to  the conditional compilation features of the C
       preprocessor which allows key bindings and variable settings to be performed  as  the  result  of  tests.
       There are four parser directives available.

       <b>$if</b>    The  <b>$if</b>  construct allows bindings to be made based on the editing mode, the terminal being used,
              or the application using <b>readline</b>.  The text of the test, after any comparison  operator,  extends
              to the end of the line; unless otherwise noted, no characters are required to isolate it.

              <b>mode</b>   The  <b>mode=</b>  form  of  the  <b>$if</b> directive is used to test whether <b>readline</b> is in emacs or vi
                     mode.  This may be used in conjunction with the <b>set</b> <b>keymap</b> command, for  instance,  to  set
                     bindings  in  the <u>emacs-standard</u> and <u>emacs-ctlx</u> keymaps only if <b>readline</b> is starting out in
                     emacs mode.

              <b>term</b>   The <b>term=</b> form may be used to include terminal-specific key bindings, perhaps to  bind  the
                     key  sequences output by the terminal's function keys.  The word on the right side of the <b>=</b>
                     is tested against both the full name of the terminal and the portion of the  terminal  name
                     before  the  first  <b>-</b>.   This  allows  <u>xterm</u>  to  match  both <u>xterm</u> and <u>xterm-256color</u>, for
                     instance.

              <b>version</b>
                     The <b>version</b> test may be used to perform comparisons  against  specific  <b>readline</b>  versions.
                     The  <b>version</b>  expands  to  the  current  <b>readline</b> version.  The set of comparison operators
                     includes <b>=</b>, (and <b>==</b>), <b>!=</b>, <b>&lt;=</b>, <b>&gt;=</b>, <b>&lt;</b>, and <b>&gt;</b>.  The version number supplied on the right  side
                     of  the  operator  consists  of  a  major version number, an optional decimal point, and an
                     optional minor version (e.g., <b>7.1</b>).  If the minor version is omitted,  it  defaults  to  <b>0</b>.
                     The  operator may be separated from the string <b>version</b> and from the version number argument
                     by whitespace.

              <u>application</u>
                     The <u>application</u> construct is used to include application-specific settings.   Each  program
                     using  the  <b>readline</b> library sets the <u>application</u> <u>name</u>, and an initialization file can test
                     for a particular value.  This could be used to bind key sequences to functions useful for a
                     specific program.  For instance, the following command adds a key sequence that quotes  the
                     current or previous word in <b>bash</b>:

                     <b>$if</b> Bash
                     # Quote the current or previous word
                     "\C-xq": "\eb\"\ef\""
                     <b>$endif</b>

              <u>variable</u>
                     The  <u>variable</u>  construct  provides simple equality tests for <b>readline</b> variables and values.
                     The permitted comparison operators are <u>=</u>, <u>==</u>, and <u>!=</u>.  The variable name must be  separated
                     from the comparison operator by whitespace; the operator may be separated from the value on
                     the  right  hand  side by whitespace.  String and boolean variables may be tested.  Boolean
                     variables must be tested against the values <u>on</u> and <u>off</u>.

       <b>$else</b>  Commands in this branch of the <b>$if</b> directive are executed if the test fails.

       <b>$endif</b> This command, as seen in the previous example, terminates an <b>$if</b> command.

       <b>$include</b>
              This directive takes a single filename as an argument and reads commands  and  key  bindings  from
              that file.  For example, the following directive would read <u><a href="file:/etc/inputrc">/etc/inputrc</a></u>:

              <b>$include</b>  <u><a href="file:/etc/inputrc">/etc/inputrc</a></u>

</pre><h4><b>SEARCHING</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Readline</b>  provides  commands  for  searching through the command history for lines containing a specified
       string.  There are two search modes: <u>incremental</u> and <u>non-incremental</u>.

       Incremental searches begin before the user has finished typing the search string.  As each  character  of
       the  search  string is typed, <b>readline</b> displays the next entry from the history matching the string typed
       so far.  An incremental search requires only as many characters as needed to  find  the  desired  history
       entry.   When  using  emacs  editing  mode,  type  <b>C-r</b> to search backward in the history for a particular
       string.  Typing <b>C-s</b> searches forward through the history.  The characters present in  the  value  of  the
       <b>isearch-terminators</b>  variable are used to terminate an incremental search.  If that variable has not been
       assigned a value, <u>ESC</u> and <b>C-j</b> terminate an incremental search.  <b>C-g</b>  aborts  an  incremental  search  and
       restores  the  original  line.   When  the  search is terminated, the history entry containing the search
       string becomes the current line.

       To find other matching entries in the history list, type  <b>C-r</b>  or  <b>C-s</b>  as  appropriate.   This  searches
       backward or forward in the history for the next entry matching the search string typed so far.  Any other
       key  sequence bound to a <b>readline</b> command terminates the search and executes that command.  For instance,
       a newline terminates the search and accepts the line, thereby executing  the  command  from  the  history
       list.  A movement command will terminate the search, make the last line found the current line, and begin
       editing.

       <b>Readline</b>  remembers  the  last  incremental search string.  If two <b>C-r</b>s are typed without any intervening
       characters defining a new search string, <b>readline</b> uses any remembered search string.

       Non-incremental searches read the entire search string before starting to  search  for  matching  history
       entries.  The search string may be typed by the user or be part of the contents of the current line.

</pre><h4><b>EDITING</b> <b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       The  following  is  a  list  of the names of the commands and the default key sequences to which they are
       bound.  Command names without an accompanying key sequence are unbound by default.

       In the following descriptions, <u>point</u> refers to the current cursor position, and <u>mark</u> refers to  a  cursor
       position  saved  by  the  <b>set-mark</b>  command.   The  text between the point and mark is referred to as the
       <u>region</u>.  <b>Readline</b> has the concept of an <u>active</u> <u>region</u>: when the  region  is  active,  <b>readline</b>  redisplay
       highlights   the   region   using   the   value   of   the   <b>active-region-start-color</b>   variable.    The
       <b>enable-active-region</b> variable turns this on and off.  Several commands set the region  to  active;  those
       are noted below.

   <b>Commands</b> <b>for</b> <b>Moving</b>
       <b>beginning-of-line</b> <b>(C-a)</b>
              Move to the start of the current line.  This may also be bound to the Home key on some keyboards.
       <b>end-of-line</b> <b>(C-e)</b>
              Move to the end of the line.  This may also be bound to the End key on some keyboards.
       <b>forward-char</b> <b>(C-f)</b>
              Move forward a character.  This may also be bound to the right arrow key on some keyboards.
       <b>backward-char</b> <b>(C-b)</b>
              Move back a character.
       <b>forward-word</b> <b>(M-f)</b>
              Move  forward to the end of the next word.  Words are composed of alphanumeric characters (letters
              and digits).
       <b>backward-word</b> <b>(M-b)</b>
              Move back to the start of the current or  previous  word.   Words  are  composed  of  alphanumeric
              characters (letters and digits).
       <b>previous-screen-line</b>
              Attempt  to  move  point  to the same physical screen column on the previous physical screen line.
              This will not have the desired effect if the current <b>readline</b> line does not take up more than  one
              physical line or if point is not greater than the length of the prompt plus the screen width.
       <b>next-screen-line</b>
              Attempt  to  move point to the same physical screen column on the next physical screen line.  This
              will not have the desired effect if the current <b>readline</b> line does  not  take  up  more  than  one
              physical  line or if the length of the current <b>readline</b> line is not greater than the length of the
              prompt plus the screen width.
       <b>clear-display</b> <b>(M-C-l)</b>
              Clear the screen and, if possible, the terminal's scrollback buffer, then redraw the current line,
              leaving the current line at the top of the screen.
       <b>clear-screen</b> <b>(C-l)</b>
              Clear the screen, then redraw the current line, leaving the current line at the top of the screen.
              With a numeric argument, refresh the current line without clearing the screen.
       <b>redraw-current-line</b>
              Refresh the current line.

   <b>Commands</b> <b>for</b> <b>Manipulating</b> <b>the</b> <b>History</b>
       <b>accept-line</b> <b>(Newline,</b> <b>Return)</b>
              Accept the line regardless of where the cursor is.  If this line is non-empty, it may be added  to
              the  history  list  for future recall with <b>add_history()</b>.  If the line is a modified history line,
              restore the history line to its original state.
       <b>previous-history</b> <b>(C-p)</b>
              Fetch the previous command from the history list, moving back in the list.  This may also be bound
              to the up arrow key on some keyboards.
       <b>next-history</b> <b>(C-n)</b>
              Fetch the next command from the history list, moving forward in the list.  This may also be  bound
              to the down arrow key on some keyboards.
       <b>beginning-of-history</b> <b>(M-&lt;)</b>
              Move to the first line in the history.
       <b>end-of-history</b> <b>(M-&gt;)</b>
              Move to the end of the input history, i.e., the line currently being entered.
       <b>operate-and-get-next</b> <b>(C-o)</b>
              Accept  the  current  line for return to the calling application as if a newline had been entered,
              and fetch the next line relative to the current line from the  history  for  editing.   A  numeric
              argument, if supplied, specifies the history entry to use instead of the current line.
       <b>fetch-history</b>
              With  a  numeric  argument,  fetch  that entry from the history list and make it the current line.
              Without an argument, move back to the first entry in the history list.
       <b>reverse-search-history</b> <b>(C-r)</b>
              Search backward starting at the current line and moving “up” through  the  history  as  necessary.
              This is an incremental search.  This command sets the region to the matched text and activates the
              region.
       <b>forward-search-history</b> <b>(C-s)</b>
              Search  forward  starting  at the current line and moving “down” through the history as necessary.
              This is an incremental search.  This command sets the region to the matched text and activates the
              region.
       <b>non-incremental-reverse-search-history</b> <b>(M-p)</b>
              Search backward through the history starting at the current line using  a  non-incremental  search
              for a string supplied by the user.  The search string may match anywhere in a history line.
       <b>non-incremental-forward-search-history</b> <b>(M-n)</b>
              Search  forward  through  the  history using a non-incremental search for a string supplied by the
              user.  The search string may match anywhere in a history line.
       <b>history-search-backward</b>
              Search backward through the history for the string of characters between the start of the  current
              line  and  the point.  The search string must match at the beginning of a history line.  This is a
              non-incremental search.  This may be bound to the Page Up key on some keyboards.
       <b>history-search-forward</b>
              Search forward through the history for the string of characters between the start of  the  current
              line  and  the point.  The search string must match at the beginning of a history line.  This is a
              non-incremental search.  This may be bound to the Page Down key on some keyboards.
       <b>history-substring-search-backward</b>
              Search backward through the history for the string of characters between the start of the  current
              line  and  the  point.   The  search  string may match anywhere in a history line.  This is a non-
              incremental search.
       <b>history-substring-search-forward</b>
              Search forward through the history for the string of characters between the start of  the  current
              line  and  the  point.   The  search  string may match anywhere in a history line.  This is a non-
              incremental search.
       <b>yank-nth-arg</b> <b>(M-C-y)</b>
              Insert the first argument to the previous command (usually the second word on the  previous  line)
              at  point.   With  an  argument <u>n</u>, insert the <u>n</u>th word from the previous command (the words in the
              previous command begin with word 0).  A negative argument inserts the <u>n</u>th word from the end of the
              previous command.  Once the argument <u>n</u> is computed, this uses the history expansion facilities  to
              extract the <u>n</u>th word, as if the “!<u>n</u>” history expansion had been specified.
       <b>yank-last-arg</b> <b>(M-.,</b> <b>M-_)</b>
              Insert  the  last  argument to the previous command (the last word of the previous history entry).
              With a numeric argument, behave exactly like <b>yank-nth-arg</b>.  Successive calls to <b>yank-last-arg</b> move
              back through the history list, inserting the last word (or the word specified by the  argument  to
              the  first  call)  of  each line in turn.  Any numeric argument supplied to these successive calls
              determines the direction to move through the history.  A negative argument switches the  direction
              through  the history (back or forward).  This uses the history expansion facilities to extract the
              last word, as if the “!$” history expansion had been specified.

   <b>Commands</b> <b>for</b> <b>Changing</b> <b>Text</b>
       <u>end-of-file</u> <b>(usually</b> <b>C-d)</b>
              The character indicating end-of-file as set, for example, by <u><a href="../man1/stty.1.html">stty</a></u>(1).  If this character  is  read
              when  there  are  no  characters  on the line, and point is at the beginning of the line, <b>readline</b>
              interprets it as the end of input and returns <b>EOF</b>.
       <b>delete-char</b> <b>(C-d)</b>
              Delete the character at point.  If this function is bound to the same character  as  the  tty  <b>EOF</b>
              character,  as  <b>C-d</b>  commonly is, see above for the effects.  This may also be bound to the Delete
              key on some keyboards.
       <b>backward-delete-char</b> <b>(Rubout)</b>
              Delete the character behind the cursor.  When given a numeric argument, save the deleted  text  on
              the kill ring.
       <b>forward-backward-delete-char</b>
              Delete  the character under the cursor, unless the cursor is at the end of the line, in which case
              the character behind the cursor is deleted.
       <b>quoted-insert</b> <b>(C-q,</b> <b>C-v)</b>
              Add the next character typed to the line verbatim.  This is how to insert characters like <b>C-q</b>, for
              example.
       <b>tab-insert</b> <b>(M-TAB)</b>
              Insert a tab character.
       <b>self-insert</b> <b>(a,</b> <b>b,</b> <b>A,</b> <b>1,</b> <b>!,</b> ...<b>)</b>
              Insert the character typed.
       <b>bracketed-paste-begin</b>
              This function is intended to be bound to the  “bracketed  paste”  escape  sequence  sent  by  some
              terminals,  and  such  a  binding is assigned by default.  It allows <b>readline</b> to insert the pasted
              text as a single unit without treating each character as if it had been read  from  the  keyboard.
              The  pasted  characters  are inserted as if each one was bound to <b>self-insert</b> instead of executing
              any editing commands.
              Bracketed paste sets the region to the inserted text and activates the region.
       <b>transpose-chars</b> <b>(C-t)</b>
              Drag the character before point forward over the character at point, moving point forward as well.
              If point is at the end of the  line,  then  this  transposes  the  two  characters  before  point.
              Negative arguments have no effect.
       <b>transpose-words</b> <b>(M-t)</b>
              Drag  the  word  before  point past the word after point, moving point past that word as well.  If
              point is at the end of the line, this transposes the last two words on the line.
       <b>upcase-word</b> <b>(M-u)</b>
              Uppercase the current (or following) word.  With a negative argument, uppercase the previous word,
              but do not move point.
       <b>downcase-word</b> <b>(M-l)</b>
              Lowercase the current (or following) word.  With a negative argument, lowercase the previous word,
              but do not move point.
       <b>capitalize-word</b> <b>(M-c)</b>
              Capitalize the current (or following) word.  With a negative  argument,  capitalize  the  previous
              word, but do not move point.
       <b>overwrite-mode</b>
              Toggle  overwrite  mode.   With an explicit positive numeric argument, switches to overwrite mode.
              With an explicit non-positive numeric argument, switches to insert  mode.   This  command  affects
              only  <b>emacs</b>  mode;  <b>vi</b>  mode does overwrite differently.  Each call to <u>readline()</u> starts in insert
              mode.
              In overwrite mode, characters bound to <b>self-insert</b> replace the text at point rather  than  pushing
              the  text  to  the  right.   Characters bound to <b>backward-delete-char</b> replace the character before
              point with a space.  By default, this command is unbound, but may be bound to the  Insert  key  on
              some keyboards.

   <b>Killing</b> <b>and</b> <b>Yanking</b>
       <b>kill-line</b> <b>(C-k)</b>
              Kill  the  text from point to the end of the current line.  With a negative numeric argument, kill
              backward from the cursor to the beginning of the line.
       <b>backward-kill-line</b> <b>(C-x</b> <b>Rubout)</b>
              Kill backward to the beginning of the current  line.   With  a  negative  numeric  argument,  kill
              forward from the cursor to the end of the line.
       <b>unix-line-discard</b> <b>(C-u)</b>
              Kill backward from point to the beginning of the line, saving the killed text on the kill-ring.
       <b>kill-whole-line</b>
              Kill all characters on the current line, no matter where point is.
       <b>kill-word</b> <b>(M-d)</b>
              Kill  from point to the end of the current word, or if between words, to the end of the next word.
              Word boundaries are the same as those used by <b>forward-word</b>.
       <b>backward-kill-word</b> <b>(M-Rubout)</b>
              Kill the word behind point.  Word boundaries are the same as those used by <b>backward-word</b>.
       <b>unix-word-rubout</b> <b>(C-w)</b>
              Kill the word behind point, using white space as a word boundary, saving the killed  text  on  the
              kill-ring.
       <b>unix-filename-rubout</b>
              Kill  the  word  behind  point,  using white space and the slash character as the word boundaries,
              saving the killed text on the kill-ring.
       <b>delete-horizontal-space</b> <b>(M-\)</b>
              Delete all spaces and tabs around point.
       <b>kill-region</b>
              Kill the text in the current region.
       <b>copy-region-as-kill</b>
              Copy the text in the region to the kill buffer, so it can be yanked immediately.
       <b>copy-backward-word</b>
              Copy the word before point to the kill buffer.  The word boundaries are the same as <b>backward-word</b>.
       <b>copy-forward-word</b>
              Copy the word following  point  to  the  kill  buffer.   The  word  boundaries  are  the  same  as
              <b>forward-word</b>.
       <b>yank</b> <b>(C-y)</b>
              Yank the top of the kill ring into the buffer at point.
       <b>yank-pop</b> <b>(M-y)</b>
              Rotate the kill ring, and yank the new top.  Only works following <b>yank</b> or <b>yank-pop</b>.

   <b>Numeric</b> <b>Arguments</b>
       <b>digit-argument</b> <b>(M-0,</b> <b>M-1,</b> ...<b>,</b> <b>M--)</b>
              Add  this  digit  to  the  argument  already  accumulating, or start a new argument.  M-- starts a
              negative argument.
       <b>universal-argument</b>
              This is another way to specify an argument.  If this command is followed by one  or  more  digits,
              optionally  with  a  leading  minus  sign,  those  digits  define the argument.  If the command is
              followed by digits, executing <b>universal-argument</b> again ends the numeric argument, but is otherwise
              ignored.  As a special case, if this command is  immediately  followed  by  a  character  that  is
              neither  a  digit  nor  minus sign, the argument count for the next command is multiplied by four.
              The argument count is initially one, so executing this function the first time makes the  argument
              count four, a second time makes the argument count sixteen, and so on.

   <b>Completing</b>
       <b>complete</b> <b>(TAB)</b>
              Attempt  to  perform  completion  on  the  text  before point.  The actual completion performed is
              application-specific.  <b>Bash</b>, for  instance,  attempts  programmable  completion  first,  otherwise
              treating the text as a variable (if the text begins with <b>$</b>), username (if the text begins with <b>~</b>),
              hostname  (if  the text begins with <b>@</b>), or command (including aliases, functions, and builtins) in
              turn.  If none of these produces a match, it falls back to filename completion.  <b>Gdb</b>, on the other
              hand, allows completion of program functions and variables, and only attempts filename  completion
              under certain circumstances.  The default <b>readline</b> completion is filename completion.
       <b>possible-completions</b> <b>(M-?)</b>
              List  the  possible  completions  of the text before point.  When displaying completions, <b>readline</b>
              sets the number of columns used for display to the value of <b>completion-display-width</b>, the value of
              the environment variable <b>COLUMNS</b>, or the screen width, in that order.
       <b>insert-completions</b> <b>(M-*)</b>
              Insert  all  completions  of  the  text  before  point  that  would   have   been   generated   by
              <b>possible-completions</b>, separated by a space.
       <b>menu-complete</b>
              Similar  to  <b>complete</b>,  but replaces the word to be completed with a single match from the list of
              possible completions.  Repeatedly executing <b>menu-complete</b>  steps  through  the  list  of  possible
              completions,  inserting  each match in turn.  At the end of the list of completions, <b>menu-complete</b>
              rings the bell (subject to the setting of <b>bell-style</b>) and restores the original text.  An argument
              of <u>n</u> moves <u>n</u> positions forward in the list of matches; a negative argument moves backward  through
              the list.  This command is intended to be bound to <b>TAB</b>, but is unbound by default.
       <b>menu-complete-backward</b>
              Identical  to  <b>menu-complete</b>,  but  moves backward through the list of possible completions, as if
              <b>menu-complete</b> had been given a negative argument.  This command is unbound by default.
       <b>export-completions</b>
              Perform completion on the word before point as described above and  write  the  list  of  possible
              completions  to  <b>readline</b>'s  output  stream  using  the  following  format, writing information on
              separate lines:

              •      the number of matches <u>N</u>;
              •      the word being completed;
              •      <u>S</u>:<u>E</u>, where <u>S</u> and <u>E</u> are the start and end offsets of the word in the <b>readline</b>  line  buffer;
                     then
              •      each match, one per line

              If  there  are  no matches, the first line will be “0”, and this command does not print any output
              after the <u>S</u>:<u>E</u>.  If there is only a single match, this prints a  single  line  containing  it.   If
              there is more than one match, this prints the common prefix of the matches, which may be empty, on
              the  first line after the <u>S</u>:<u>E</u>, then the matches on subsequent lines.  In this case, <u>N</u> will include
              the first line with the common prefix.

              The user or application should be able to accommodate the possibility of a blank line.  The intent
              is that the user or application reads <u>N</u> lines after the line containing <u>S</u>:<u>E</u> to  obtain  the  match
              list.  This command is unbound by default.

       <b>delete-char-or-list</b>
              Deletes  the  character  under  the  cursor  if  not  at  the  beginning  or end of the line (like
              <b>delete-char</b>).  At the end of the line,  it  behaves  identically  to  <b>possible-completions</b>.   This
              command is unbound by default.

   <b>Keyboard</b> <b>Macros</b>
       <b>start-kbd-macro</b> <b>(C-x</b> <b>()</b>
              Begin saving the characters typed into the current keyboard macro.
       <b>end-kbd-macro</b> <b>(C-x</b> <b>))</b>
              Stop saving the characters typed into the current keyboard macro and store the definition.
       <b>call-last-kbd-macro</b> <b>(C-x</b> <b>e)</b>
              Re-execute  the  last  keyboard  macro defined, by making the characters in the macro appear as if
              typed at the keyboard.
       <b>print-last-kbd-macro</b> <b>()</b>
              Print the last keyboard macro defined in a format suitable for the <u>inputrc</u> file.

   <b>Miscellaneous</b>
       <b>re-read-init-file</b> <b>(C-x</b> <b>C-r)</b>
              Read in the contents of the <u>inputrc</u> file, and incorporate any  bindings  or  variable  assignments
              found there.
       <b>abort</b> <b>(C-g)</b>
              Abort  the  current  editing  command  and  ring  the  terminal's  bell (subject to the setting of
              <b>bell-style</b>).
       <b>do-lowercase-version</b> <b>(M-A,</b> <b>M-B,</b> <b>M-</b><u>x</u><b>,</b> ...<b>)</b>
              If the metafied character <u>x</u> is uppercase, run the command  that  is  bound  to  the  corresponding
              metafied lowercase character.  The behavior is undefined if <u>x</u> is already lowercase.
       <b>prefix-meta</b> <b>(ESC)</b>
              Metafy the next character typed.  <b>ESC</b> <b>f</b> is equivalent to <b>Meta-f</b>.
       <b>undo</b> <b>(C-_,</b> <b>C-x</b> <b>C-u)</b>
              Incremental undo, separately remembered for each line.
       <b>revert-line</b> <b>(M-r)</b>
              Undo  all  changes  made  to  this  line.  This is like executing the <b>undo</b> command enough times to
              return the line to its initial state.
       <b>tilde-expand</b> <b>(M-~)</b>
              Perform tilde expansion on the current word.
       <b>set-mark</b> <b>(C-@,</b> <b>M-&lt;space&gt;)</b>
              Set the mark to the point.  If a numeric argument is supplied, set the mark to that position.
       <b>exchange-point-and-mark</b> <b>(C-x</b> <b>C-x)</b>
              Swap the point with the mark.  Set the current cursor position to the saved position, then set the
              mark to the old cursor position.
       <b>character-search</b> <b>(C-])</b>
              Read a character and move point to the next occurrence of that  character.   A  negative  argument
              searches for previous occurrences.
       <b>character-search-backward</b> <b>(M-C-])</b>
              Read a character and move point to the previous occurrence of that character.  A negative argument
              searches for subsequent occurrences.
       <b>skip-csi-sequence</b>
              Read  enough  characters  to consume a multi-key sequence such as those defined for keys like Home
              and End.  CSI sequences begin with a Control Sequence Indicator (CSI), usually  <u>ESC</u>  <u>[</u>.   If  this
              sequence is bound to “\e[”, keys producing CSI sequences have no effect unless explicitly bound to
              a  <b>readline</b>  command,  instead  of  inserting  stray  characters into the editing buffer.  This is
              unbound by default, but usually bound to <u>ESC</u> <u>[</u>.
       <b>insert-comment</b> <b>(M-#)</b>
              Without a numeric argument, insert the  value  of  the  <b>readline</b>  <b>comment-begin</b>  variable  at  the
              beginning  of the current line.  If a numeric argument is supplied, this command acts as a toggle:
              if the characters at the beginning of the line do not match the value of <b>comment-begin</b>, insert the
              value; otherwise delete the characters in <b>comment-begin</b> from the beginning of the line.  In either
              case, the line is accepted as if a newline had been typed.  The  default  value  of  <b>comment-begin</b>
              causes  this  command  to make the current line a shell comment.  If a numeric argument causes the
              comment character to be removed, the line will be executed by the shell.
       <b>dump-functions</b>
              Print all of the functions and their key bindings to the <b>readline</b> output  stream.   If  a  numeric
              argument is supplied, the output is formatted in such a way that it can be made part of an <u>inputrc</u>
              file.
       <b>dump-variables</b>
              Print  all of the settable variables and their values to the <b>readline</b> output stream.  If a numeric
              argument is supplied, the output is formatted in such a way that it can be made part of an <u>inputrc</u>
              file.
       <b>dump-macros</b>
              Print all of the <b>readline</b> key sequences bound to  macros  and  the  strings  they  output  to  the
              <b>readline</b>  output stream.  If a numeric argument is supplied, the output is formatted in such a way
              that it can be made part of an <u>inputrc</u> file.
       <b>execute-named-command</b> <b>(M-x)</b>
              Read a bindable <b>readline</b> command name from the input and execute the function to which it's bound,
              as if the key sequence to which it was bound appeared in the input.  If this function is  supplied
              with a numeric argument, it passes that argument to the function it executes.
       <b>emacs-editing-mode</b> <b>(C-e)</b>
              When in <b>vi</b> command mode, this switches <b>readline</b> to <b>emacs</b> editing mode.
       <b>vi-editing-mode</b> <b>(M-C-j)</b>
              When in <b>emacs</b> editing mode, this switches to <b>vi</b> editing mode.

</pre><h4><b>DEFAULT</b> <b>KEY</b> <b>BINDINGS</b></h4><pre>
       The  following  is  a  list of the default emacs and vi bindings.  Characters with the eighth bit set are
       written as M-&lt;character&gt;, and are referred to as <u>metafied</u> characters.  The printable ASCII characters not
       mentioned in the list of emacs standard bindings are  bound  to  the  <b>self-insert</b>  function,  which  just
       inserts  the  given character into the input line.  In vi insertion mode, all characters not specifically
       mentioned are bound to <b>self-insert</b>.  Characters assigned to signal generation by <u><a href="../man1/stty.1.html">stty</a></u>(1) or the  terminal
