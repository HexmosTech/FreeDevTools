</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Barcode::Code128 - Generate CODE 128 bar codes

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Barcode::Code128;

         $code = new Barcode::Code128;

</pre><h4><b>REQUIRES</b></h4><pre>
       Perl 5.004, Carp, Exporter, GD (optional)

</pre><h4><b>EXPORTS</b></h4><pre>
       By default, nothing.  However there are a number of constants that represent special characters used in
       the CODE 128 symbology that you may wish to include.  For example if you are using the EAN-128 or UCC-128
       code, the string to encode begins with the FNC1 character.  To encode the EAN-128 string "00 0 0012345
       555555555 8", you would do the following:

         use Barcode::Code128 'FNC1';
         $code = new Barcode::Code128;
         $code-&gt;text(FNC1.'00000123455555555558');

       To have this module export one or more of these characters, specify them on the "use" statement or use
       the special token ':all' instead to include all of them.  Examples:

         use Barcode::Code128 qw(FNC1 FNC2 FNC3 FNC4 Shift);
         use Barcode::Code128 qw(:all);

       Here is the complete list of the exportable characters.  They are assigned to high-order ASCII characters
       purely arbitrarily for the purposes of this module; the values used do not reflect any part of the CODE
       128 standard.  <b>Warning</b>: Using the "CodeA", "CodeB", "CodeC", "StartA", "StartB", "StartC", and "Stop"
       codes may cause your barcodes to be invalid, and be rejected by scanners.  They are inserted
       automatically as needed by this module.

         CodeA      0xf4        CodeB      0xf5         CodeC      0xf6
         FNC1       0xf7        FNC2       0xf8         FNC3       0xf9
         FNC4       0xfa        Shift      0xfb         StartA     0xfc
         StartB     0xfd        StartC     0xfe         Stop       0xff

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Barcode::Code128 generates bar codes using the CODE 128 symbology.  It can generate images in PNG or GIF
       format using the GD package, or it can generate a text string representing the barcode that you can
       render using some other technology if desired.

       The intended use of this module is to create a web page with a bar code on it, which can then be printed
       out and faxed or mailed to someone who will scan the bar code.  The application which spurred its
       creation was an expense report tool, where the employee submitting the report would print out the web
       page and staple the receipts to it, and the Accounts Payable clerk would scan the bar code to indicate
       that the receipts were received.

       The default settings for this module produce a large image that can safely be FAXed several times and
       still scanned easily.  If this requirement is not important you can generate smaller image using optional
       parameters, described below.

       If you wish to generate images with this module you must also have the GD module (written by Lincoln
       Stein, and available from CPAN) installed.  Using the libgd library, GD can generate files in PNG
       (Portable Network Graphics) or GIF (Graphic Interchange Format) formats.

       Starting with version 1.20, and ending with 2.0.28 (released July 21st, 2004), GD and the underlying
       libgd library could not generate GIF files due to patent issues, but any modern version of libgd (since
       2004) can do GIF as the patent has expired.  Most browsers have no trouble with PNG files.

       In order to ensure you have a sufficiently modern installation of the GD module to do both GIF and PNG
       formats, we require version 2.18 of GD (which in turn requires libgd 2.0.28) or higher.

       If the GD module is not present, you can still use the module, but you will not be able to use its
       functions for generating images.  You can use the <b>barcode()</b> method to get a string of "#" and " " (hash
       and space) characters, and use your own image-generating routine with that as input.

       To use the the GD module, you will need to install it along with this module.  You can obtain it from the
       CPAN (Comprehensive Perl Archive Network) repository of your choice under the directory "authors/id/LDS".
       Visit <a href="http://www.cpan.org/">http://www.cpan.org/</a> for more information about CPAN.  The GD home page is:

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       new Usage:

               $object = new Barcode::Code128

           Creates a new barcode object.

       option
           Sets  or  retreives various options.  If called with only one parameter, retrieves the value for that
           parameter.  If called with more than one parameter, treats the parameters  as  name/value  pairs  and
           sets those option values accordingly.  If called with no parameters, returns a hash consisting of the
           values of all the options (hash ref in scalar context).  When an option has not been set, its default
           value is returned.

           You  can also set or retrieve any of these options by using it as a method name.  For example, to set
           the value of the padding option, you can use either of these:

               $barcode-&gt;<a href="../man10/padding.10.html">padding</a>(10);
               $barcode-&gt;option("padding", 10);

           The valid options, and the default value and meaning of each, are:

               width            undef    Width of the image (*)
               height           undef    Height of the image (*)
               border           2        Size of the black border around the barcode
               scale            2        How many pixels for the smallest barcode stripe
               font             "large"  Font (**) for the text at the bottom
               show_text        1        True/False: display the text at the bottom?
               font_margin      2        Pixels above, below, and to left of the text
               font_align       "left"   Align the text ("left", "right", or "center")
               transparent_text 1/0(***) True/False: use transparent background for text?
               top_margin       0        No. of pixels above the barcode
               bottom_margin    0        No. of pixels below the barcode (&amp; text)
               left_margin      0        No. of pixels to the left of the barcode
               right_margin     0        No. of pixels to the right of the barcode
               padding          20       Size of whitespace before &amp; after barcode

           * Width and height are the default values for the $x and $y arguments to the png,  gif,  or  gd_image
           method (q.v.)

           **  Font  may be one of the following: "giant", "large", "medium", "small", or "tiny".  Or, it may be
           any valid GD font name, such as "gdMediumFont".

           *** The "transparent_text" option is "1" (true) by default for GIF output, but "0" (false)  for  PNG.
           This  is because PNG transparency is not supported well by many viewing software The background color
           is grey (#CCCCCC) when not transparent.

       gif
       png
       gd_image
           Usage:

               $object-&gt;png($text)
               $object-&gt;png($text, $x, $y)
               $object-&gt;png($text, { options... })

               $object-&gt;gif($text)
               $object-&gt;gif($text, $x, $y)
               $object-&gt;gif($text, { options... })

               $object-&gt;gd_image($text)
               $object-&gt;gd_image($text, $x, $y)
               $object-&gt;gd_image($text, { options... })

           These methods generate an image using the GD module.  The <b>gd_image()</b>  method  returns  a  GD  object,
           which is useful if you want to do additional processing to it using the GD object methods.  The other
           two  create actual images.  NOTE: GIF files require an old version of GD, and so you probably are not
           able to create them - see below.

           The <b>gif()</b> and <b>png()</b> methods are wrappers around <b>gd_image()</b> that create the GD object and then run the
           corresponding GD method to create output that can be displayed or saved to a file.   Note  that  only
           one  of  these  two  methods  will  work, depending on which version of GD you have - see below.  The
           return value from <b>gif()</b> or <b>png()</b> is a binary file, so if you are working on an operating system (e.g.
           Microsoft Windows) that  makes  a  distinction  between  text  and  binary  files  be  sure  to  call
           binmode(FILEHANDLE) before writing the image to it, or the file may get corrupted.  Example:

             open(PNG, "&gt;code128.png") or die "Can't write code128.png: $!\n";
             binmode(PNG);
             print PNG $object-&gt;png("CODE 128");
             close(PNG);

           If  you have GD version 1.20 or newer, the PNG file format is the only allowed option.  Conversely if
           you  have  GD  version  prior  to  1.20,  then  the  GIF  format  is  the  only  option.   Check  the
           $object-&gt;<b>image_format()</b> method to find out which you have (q.v.).

           Note:  All of the arguments to this function are optional.  If you have previously specified $text to
           the "barcode()", "encode()", or "text()" methods, you do not need to specify it again.  The $x and $y
           variables specify the size of the barcode within the image in pixels.  If size(s) are not  specified,
           they will be set to the minimum size, which is the length of the barcode plus 40 pixels horizontally,
           and 15% of the length of the barcode vertically.  See also the $object-&gt;<b>width()</b> and $object-&gt;<b>height()</b>
           methods for another way of specifying this.

           If instead of specifying $x and $y, you pass a reference to a hash of name/value pairs, these will be
           used  as  the  options,  overriding anything set using the $object-&gt;<b>option()</b> (or width/height) method
           (q.v.).  However, this will not set the options so any future barcodes using  the  same  object  will
           revert  to the option list of the object.  If you want to set the options permanently use the option,
           width, and/or height methods instead.

       barcode
           Usage:

               $object-&gt;barcode($text)

           Computes the bar code for the specified text.   The  result  will  be  a  string  of  '#'  and  space
           characters  representing  the  dark and light bands of the bar code.  You can use this if you have an
           alternate printing system besides using GD to create the images.

           Note: The $text parameter is optional. If you have previously specified $text to  the  "encode()"  or
           "text()" methods, you do not need to specify it again.

   <b>Housekeeping</b> <b>Functions</b>
       The rest of the methods defined here are only for internal use, or if you really know what you are doing.
       Some  of  them  may  be  useful to authors of classes that inherit from this one, or may be overridden by
       subclasses.  If you just want to use this module to generate bar codes, you can stop reading here.

       encode
           Usage:

               $object-&gt;encode
               $object-&gt;encode($text)
               $object-&gt;encode($text, $preferred_code)

           Do the encoding.  If $text is supplied, will automatically call the <b>text()</b> method to set that as  the
           text  value  first.   If $preferred_code is supplied, will try that code first.  Otherwise, the codes
           will be tried in the following manner:

           1. If it is possible to use Code C for any of the text, use that for as much of it as possible.

           2. Check how many characters would be converted using codes A or B, and  use  that  code  to  convert
           them.  If the amount is equal, code A is used.

           3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 until the text string has been completely encoded.

       text
           Usage:

               $object-&gt;text($text)
               $text = $object-&gt;text

           Set  or  retrieve  the  text  for  this  barcode.   This  will be called automatically by <b>encode()</b> or
           <b>barcode()</b> so typically this will not be used directly by the user.

       start
           Usage:

               $object-&gt;start($code)

           If the code (see <b>code()</b>) is already defined, then adds  the  CodeA,  CodeB,  or  CodeC  character  as
           appropriate to the encoded message inside the object.  Typically for internal use only.

       stop
           Usage:

               $object-&gt;stop()

           Computes  the  check  character  and appends it along with the Stop character, to the encoded string.
           Typically for internal use only.

       code
           Usage:

               $object-&gt;code($code)
               $code = $object-&gt;code

           Set or retrieve the code for this barcode.  $code may be 'A', 'B', or 'C'.   Typically  for  internal
           use only.  Not particularly meaningful unless called during the middle of encoding.

</pre><h4><b>CLASS</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       Unrecognized option ($opt) for $class
           The  specified option is not valid for the module.  $class should be "Barcode::Code128" but if it has
           been inherited into another module, that module will show instead.  $opt is the attempted option.

       The <b>gd_image()</b> method of Barcode::Code128 requires the GD module
           To call the "gd_image()", "png()", or "gif()" methods, the GD module must be present.  This module is
           used to create the actual image.  Without it, you can only use the "barcode()" method.

       Scale must be a positive integer
           The scale factor for the "gd_image()", "png()", or "gif()" methods must be a positive integer.

       Border ($border) must be a positive integer or zero
           The border option cannot be a fractional or negative number.

       Invalid font $font
           The specified font is not valid.  Note that this is tested using GD-&gt;<b>can()</b>, and so any subroutine  in
           GD.pm  will  pass this test - but only the fonts will actually work.  See the GD module documentation
           for more.

       Image width $x is too small for bar code
           You have specified an image width that does not allow enough space for the bar code to be  displayed.
           The  minimum allowable is the size of the bar code itself plus 40 pixels.  If in doubt, just omit the
           width value when calling "gd_image()", "png()", or "gif()" and it will use the minimum.

       Image height $y is too small for bar code
           You have specified an image height that does not allow enough space for the bar code to be displayed.
           The minimum allowable is 15% of the width of the bar code.  If in doubt, just omit the  height  value
           when calling "gd_image()", "png()", or "gif()" and it will use the minimum.

       Unable to create $x x $y image
           An error occurred when initializing a GD::Image object for the specified size.  Perhaps $x and $y are
           too large for memory?

       The <b>gif()</b> method of Barcode::Code128 requires the GD module
       The <b>gif()</b> method of Barcode::Code128 requires version less than 1.20 of GD
       The <b>png()</b> method of Barcode::Code128 requires the GD module
       The <b>png()</b> method of Barcode::Code128 requires at least version 1.20 of GD
           These  errors  indicate  that the GD module, or the correct version of the GD module for this method,
           was not present.  You need to install GD version 1.20 or greater to create PNG files, or a version of
           GD less than 1.20 to create GIF files.

       No encoded text found
           This message from "barcode()" typically means that there was no text message supplied  either  during
           the  current method call or in a previous method call on the same object.  This error occurs when you
           are trying to create a barcode by calling one  of  "gd_image()",  "png()",  "gif()",  or  "barcode()"
           without having specified the text to be encoded.

       No text defined
           This  message  from  "encode()" typically means that there was no text message supplied either during
           the current method call or in a previous method call on the same object.

       Invalid preferred code ``$preferred_code''
           This error means "encode()" was called with the $preferred_code optional parameter but it was not one
           of ``A'', ``B'', or ``C''.

       Sanity Check Overflow
           This is a serious error in "encode()" that indicates a  serious  problem  attempting  to  encode  the
           requested  message.   This  means  that an infinite loop was generated.  If you get this error please
           contact the author.

       Unable to find encoding for ``$text''
           Part or all of the message could not be encoded.  This may mean that the message contained characters
           not encodable in the CODE 128 character set, such as a character with an ASCII value higher than  127
           (except the special control characters defined in this module).

       Unable to switch from ``$old_code'' to ``$new_code''
           This is a serious error in "start()" that indicates a serious problem occurred when switching between
           the codes (A, B, or C) of CODE 128.  If you get this error please contact the author.

       Unable to start with ``$new_code''
           This is a serious error in "start()" that indicates a serious problem occurred when starting encoding
           in one of the codes (A, B, or C) of CODE 128.  If you get this error please contact the author.

       Unknown code ``$new_code'' (should be A, B, or C)
           This  is a serious error in "code()" that indicates an invalid argument was supplied.  Only the codes
           (A, B, or C) of CODE 128 may be supplied here.  If you get this error please contact the author.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       At least some Web browsers do not seem to handle PNG files with transparent backgrounds correctly.  As  a
       result,  the  default for PNG is to generate barcodes without transparent backgrounds - the background is
       grey instead.
