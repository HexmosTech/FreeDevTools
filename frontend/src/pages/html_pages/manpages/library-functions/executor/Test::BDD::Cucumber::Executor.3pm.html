</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Test::BDD::Cucumber::Executor - Run through Feature and Harness objects

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 0.87

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The Executor runs through Features, matching up the Step Lines with Step Definitions, and reporting on
       progress through the passed-in harness.

</pre><h4><b>ATTRIBUTES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>matching</b>
       The value of this attribute should be one of "first" (default), "relaxed" and "strict".

       By default ("first"), the first matching step is executed immediately, terminating the search for
       (further) matching steps. When "matching" is set to anything other than "first", all steps are checked
       for matches. When set to "relaxed", a warning will be generated on multiple matches. When set to
       "strict", an exception will be thrown.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>extensions</b>
   <b>add_extensions</b>
       The attributes "extensions" is an arrayref of Test::BDD::Cucumber::Extension extensions. Extensions have
       their hook-functions called by the Executor at specific points in the BDD feature execution.

       <b>"&lt;add_extensions"</b> adds items in FIFO using <b>unshift()</b>&gt;, and are called in reverse order at the end hook;
       this means that if you:

         add_extensions( 1 );
         add_extensions( 2, 3 );

       The "pre_*" will be called in order 2, 3, 1, and "post_*" will be called in 1, 3, 2.

   <b>steps</b>
   <b>add_steps</b>
       The attributes "steps" is a hashref of arrayrefs, storing steps by their Verb.  add_steps() takes step
       definitions of the item list form:

        (
         [ Given =&gt; qr//, sub {} ],
        ),

       Or, when metadata is specified with the step, of the form:

        (
         [ Given =&gt; qr//, { meta =&gt; $data }, sub {} ]
        ),

       (where the hashref stores step metadata) and populates "steps" with them.

   <b>execute</b>
       Execute accepts a feature object, a harness object, and an optional
       Cucumber::TagExpressions::ExpressionNode object and for each scenario in the feature which meets the tag
       requirements (or all of them, if you haven't specified one), runs "execute_scenario".

   <b>execute_outline</b>
       Accepts a hashref of options and executes each scenario definition in the scenario outline, or, lacking
       an outline, executes the single defined scenario.

       Options:

       " feature " - A Test::BDD::Cucumber::Model::Feature object

       " feature_stash " - A hashref that should live the lifetime of
        feature execution

       " harness " - A Test::BDD::Cucumber::Harness subclass object

       " outline " - A Test::BDD::Cucumber::Model::Scenario object

       " background " - An optional Test::BDD::Cucumber::Model::Scenario object representing the Background

   <b>execute_scenario</b>
       Accepts a hashref of options, and executes each step in a scenario. Options:

       "feature" - A Test::BDD::Cucumber::Model::Feature object

       "feature_stash" - A hashref that should live the lifetime of feature execution

       "harness" - A Test::BDD::Cucumber::Harness subclass object

       "scenario" - A Test::BDD::Cucumber::Model::Scenario object

       "background_obj" - An optional Test::BDD::Cucumber::Model::Scenario object representing the Background

       "scenario_stash" - A hashref that lives the lifetime of the scenario execution

       For each step, a Test::BDD::Cucumber::StepContext object is created, and passed to dispatch(). Nothing is
       returned - everything is played back through the Harness interface.

   <b>add_placeholders</b>
       Accepts a text string and a hashref, and replaces " &lt;placeholders" &gt; with the values in the hashref,
       returning a string.

   <b>add_table_placeholders</b>
       Accepts a hash with parsed table data and a hashref, and replaces " &lt;placeholders" &gt; with the values in
       the hashref, returning a copy of the parsed table hashref.

   <b>find_and_dispatch</b>
       Accepts a Test::BDD::Cucumber::StepContext object, and searches through the steps that have been added to
       the executor object, executing against the first matching one (unless "$self-"matching&gt; indicates
       otherwise).

       You can also pass in a boolean 'short-circuit' flag if the Scenario's remaining steps should be skipped,
       and a boolean flag to denote if it's a redispatched step.

   <b>dispatch($context,</b> <b>$stepdef,</b> <b>$short_circuit,</b> <b>$redispatch)</b>
       Accepts a Test::BDD::Cucumber::StepContext object, and a reference to a step definition triplet (verb,
       metadata hashref, coderef) and executes it the coderef.

       You can also pass in a boolean 'short-circuit' flag if the Scenario's remaining steps should be skipped.

   <b>skip_step</b>
       Accepts a step-context, a result-type, and a textual reason, exercises the Harness's step start and
       step_done methods, and returns a skipped-test result.
