</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       DBIx::Class::Schema - composable schemas

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         package Library::Schema;
         use base qw/DBIx::Class::Schema/;

         # load all Result classes in Library/Schema/Result/
         __PACKAGE__-&gt;load_namespaces();

         package Library::Schema::Result::CD;
         use base qw/DBIx::Class::Core/;

         __PACKAGE__-&gt;load_components(qw/InflateColumn::DateTime/); # for example
         __PACKAGE__-&gt;table('cd');

         # Elsewhere in your code:
         my $schema1 = Library::Schema-&gt;connect(
           $dsn,
           $user,
           $password,
           { AutoCommit =&gt; 1 },
         );

         my $schema2 = Library::Schema-&gt;connect($coderef_returning_dbh);

         # fetch objects using Library::Schema::Result::DVD
         my $resultset = $schema1-&gt;resultset('DVD')-&gt;search( ... );
         my @dvd_objects = $schema2-&gt;resultset('DVD')-&gt;search( ... );

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Creates database classes based on a schema. This is the recommended way to use DBIx::Class and allows you
       to use more than one concurrent connection with your classes.

       NB: If you're used to Class::DBI it's worth reading the "SYNOPSIS" carefully, as DBIx::Class does things
       a little differently. Note in particular which module inherits off which.

</pre><h4><b>SETUP</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>load_namespaces</b>
       Arguments: %options?

         package MyApp::Schema;
         __PACKAGE__-&gt;load_namespaces();

         __PACKAGE__-&gt;load_namespaces(
            result_namespace =&gt; 'Res',
            resultset_namespace =&gt; 'RSet',
            default_resultset_class =&gt; '+MyApp::Othernamespace::RSet',
         );

       With  no  arguments,  this method uses Module::Find to load all of the Result and ResultSet classes under
       the namespace of the schema from which it is called.  For example, "My::Schema" will by default find  and
       load Result classes named "My::Schema::Result::*" and ResultSet classes named "My::Schema::ResultSet::*".

       ResultSet   classes   are   associated   with   Result   class   of   the   same   name.    For  example,
       "My::Schema::Result::CD" will get the ResultSet class "My::Schema::ResultSet::CD" if it is present.

       Both   Result   and   ResultSet   namespaces   are   configurable   via   the   "result_namespace"    and
       "resultset_namespace" options.

       Another  option,  "default_resultset_class" specifies a custom default ResultSet class for Result classes
       with no corresponding ResultSet.

       All of the namespace and classname options are by default relative to the schema classname.  To specify a
       fully-qualified name, prefix it with a literal "+".  For example, "+Other::NameSpace::Result".

       <u>Warnings</u>

       You will be warned if ResultSet classes are discovered for which there are  no  matching  Result  classes
       like this:

         load_namespaces found ResultSet class $classname with no corresponding Result class

       If  a  ResultSource instance is found to already have a ResultSet class set using resultset_class to some
       other class, you will be warned like this:

         We found ResultSet class '$rs_class' for '$result_class', but it seems
         that you had already set '$result_class' to use '$rs_set' instead

       <u>Examples</u>

         # load My::Schema::Result::CD, My::Schema::Result::Artist,
         #    My::Schema::ResultSet::CD, etc...
         My::Schema-&gt;load_namespaces;

         # Override everything to use ugly names.
         # In this example, if there is a My::Schema::Res::Foo, but no matching
         #   My::Schema::RSets::Foo, then Foo will have its
         #   resultset_class set to My::Schema::RSetBase
         My::Schema-&gt;load_namespaces(
           result_namespace =&gt; 'Res',
           resultset_namespace =&gt; 'RSets',
           default_resultset_class =&gt; 'RSetBase',
         );

         # Put things in other namespaces
         My::Schema-&gt;load_namespaces(
           result_namespace =&gt; '+Some::Place::Results',
           resultset_namespace =&gt; '+Another::Place::RSets',
         );

       To search multiple namespaces for either Result or ResultSet classes, use an arrayref of  namespaces  for
       that  option.  In the case that the same result (or resultset) class exists in multiple namespaces, later
       entries in the list of namespaces will override earlier ones.

         My::Schema-&gt;load_namespaces(
           # My::Schema::Results_C::Foo takes precedence over My::Schema::Results_B::Foo :
           result_namespace =&gt; [ 'Results_A', 'Results_B', 'Results_C' ],
           resultset_namespace =&gt; [ '+Some::Place::RSets', 'RSets' ],
         );

   <b>load_classes</b>
       Arguments: @classes?, { $namespace =&gt; [ @classes ] }+

       "load_classes" is an alternative method to "load_namespaces", both of which serve similar purposes,  each
       with  different  advantages  and  disadvantages.   In  the general case you should use "load_namespaces",
       unless you need to be able to specify that only specific classes are loaded at runtime.

       With no arguments, this method uses Module::Find to  find  all  classes  under  the  schema's  namespace.
       Otherwise,   this  method  loads  the  classes  you  specify  (using  use),  and  registers  them  (using
       "register_class").

       It is possible to comment out classes with a leading "#", but note that perl will think  it's  a  mistake
       (trying  to  use  a  comment  in  a  qw  list),  so  you'll  need  to add "no warnings 'qw';" before your
       load_classes call.

       If any classes found do not appear to be Result class files, you will get the following warning:

          Failed to load $comp_class. Can't find source_name method. Is
          $comp_class really a full DBIC result class? Fix it, move it elsewhere,
          or make your load_classes call more specific.

       Example:

         My::Schema-&gt;load_classes(); # loads My::Schema::CD, My::Schema::Artist,
                                     # etc. (anything under the My::Schema namespace)

         # loads My::Schema::CD, My::Schema::Artist, Other::Namespace::Producer but
         # not Other::Namespace::LinerNotes nor My::Schema::Track
         My::Schema-&gt;load_classes(qw/ CD Artist #Track /, {
           Other::Namespace =&gt; [qw/ Producer #LinerNotes /],
         });

   <b>storage_type</b>
       Arguments: $storage_type|{$storage_type, \%args}
       Return Value: $storage_type|{$storage_type, \%args}
       Default value: DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI

       Set the storage class that will be instantiated when "connect" is called.  If the classname  starts  with
       "::", the prefix "DBIx::Class::Storage" is assumed by "connect".

       You  want  to  use  this  to  set  subclasses of DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI in cases where the appropriate
       subclass is not autodetected.

       If your storage type requires instantiation arguments, those are defined as a second argument in the form
       of a hashref and the entire value needs to be wrapped into an arrayref or a  hashref.   We  support  both
       types   of   refs   here   in  order  to  play  nice  with  your  Config::[class]  or  your  choice.  See
       DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::Replicated for an example of this.

   <b>exception_action</b>
       Arguments: $code_reference
       Return Value: $code_reference
       Default value: None

       When "throw_exception" is invoked and "exception_action" is set to a code reference, this reference  will
       be  called  instead  of  "throw" in DBIx::Class::Exception, with the exception message passed as the only
       argument.

       Your custom throw code <b>must</b> rethrow the exception, as "throw_exception" is an  integral  part  of  DBIC's
       internal execution control flow.

       Example:

          package My::Schema;
          use base qw/DBIx::Class::Schema/;
          use My::ExceptionClass;
          __PACKAGE__-&gt;exception_action(sub { My::ExceptionClass-&gt;throw(@_) });
          __PACKAGE__-&gt;load_classes;

          # or:
          my $schema_obj = My::Schema-&gt;connect( .... );
          $schema_obj-&gt;exception_action(sub { My::ExceptionClass-&gt;throw(@_) });

   <b>stacktrace</b>
       Arguments: boolean

       Whether  "throw_exception"  should  include  stack  trace  information.   Defaults to false normally, but
       defaults to true if $ENV{DBIC_TRACE} is true.

   <b>sqlt_deploy_hook</b>
       Arguments: $sqlt_schema

       An  optional  sub  which  you  can  declare  in  your  own  Schema  class  that  will  get   passed   the
       SQL::Translator::Schema object when you deploy the schema via "create_ddl_dir" or "deploy".

       For  an  example  of  what  you  can  do  with  this,  see  "Adding Indexes And Functions To Your SQL" in
       DBIx::Class::Manual::Cookbook.

       Note that sqlt_deploy_hook is called by "deployment_statements", which in turn is called before "deploy".
       Therefore the hook can be used only to manipulate the SQL::Translator::Schema object before it is  turned
       into SQL fed to the database. If you want to execute post-deploy statements which can not be generated by
       SQL::Translator, the currently suggested method is to overload "deploy" and use dbh_do.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>connect</b>
       Arguments: @connectinfo
       Return Value: $new_schema

       Creates  and  returns a new Schema object. The connection info set on it is used to create a new instance
       of the storage backend and set it on the Schema object.

       See "connect_info" in DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI for DBI-specific syntax on the @connectinfo argument,  or
       DBIx::Class::Storage in general.

       Note  that  "connect_info"  expects an arrayref of arguments, but "connect" does not. "connect" wraps its
       arguments in an arrayref before passing them to "connect_info".

       <u>Overloading</u>

       "connect" is a convenience method. It is equivalent to calling  $schema-&gt;clone-&gt;connection(@connectinfo).
       To write your own overloaded version, overload "connection" instead.

   <b>resultset</b>
       Arguments: $source_name
       Return Value: $resultset

         my $rs = $schema-&gt;resultset('DVD');

       Returns the DBIx::Class::ResultSet object for the registered source name.

   <b>sources</b>
       Return Value: @source_names

         my @source_names = $schema-&gt;sources;

       Lists names of all the sources registered on this Schema object.

   <b>source</b>
       Arguments: $source_name
       Return Value: $result_source

         my $source = $schema-&gt;source('Book');

       Returns the DBIx::Class::ResultSource object for the registered source name.

   <b>class</b>
       Arguments: $source_name
       Return Value: $classname

         my $class = $schema-&gt;class('CD');

       Retrieves the Result class name for the given source name.

   <b>txn_do</b>
       Arguments: $coderef, @coderef_args?
       Return Value: The return value of $coderef

       Executes  $coderef  with  (optional)  arguments  @coderef_args atomically, returning its result (if any).
       Equivalent  to  calling  $schema-&gt;storage-&gt;txn_do.   See  "txn_do"  in  DBIx::Class::Storage   for   more
       information.

       This   interface   is  preferred  over  using  the  individual  methods  "txn_begin",  "txn_commit",  and
       "txn_rollback" below.

       WARNING: If you are connected with "AutoCommit =&gt; 0" the transaction is considered nested, and  you  will
       still  need  to  call  "txn_commit" to write your changes when appropriate. You will also want to connect
       with auto_savepoint =&gt; 1 to get partial rollback to  work,  if  the  storage  driver  for  your  database
       supports it.

       Connecting with "AutoCommit =&gt; 1" is recommended.

   <b>txn_scope_guard</b>
       Runs "txn_scope_guard" on the schema's storage. See "txn_scope_guard" in DBIx::Class::Storage.

   <b>txn_begin</b>
       Begins    a    transaction    (does    nothing   if   AutoCommit   is   off).   Equivalent   to   calling
       $schema-&gt;storage-&gt;txn_begin. See "txn_begin" in DBIx::Class::Storage for more information.

   <b>txn_commit</b>
       Commits the current transaction. Equivalent to calling $schema-&gt;storage-&gt;txn_commit. See "txn_commit"  in
       DBIx::Class::Storage for more information.

   <b>txn_rollback</b>
       Rolls   back   the   current  transaction.  Equivalent  to  calling  $schema-&gt;storage-&gt;txn_rollback.  See
       "txn_rollback" in DBIx::Class::Storage for more information.

   <b>storage</b>
         my $storage = $schema-&gt;storage;

       Returns the DBIx::Class::Storage object for this Schema. Grab this if you want to turn on  SQL  statement
       debugging at runtime, or set the quote character. For the default storage, the documentation can be found
       in DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI.

   <b>populate</b>
       Arguments: $source_name, [ \@column_list, \@row_values+ ] | [ \%col_data+ ]
       Return Value: \@result_objects (scalar context) | @result_objects (list context)

       A convenience shortcut to "populate" in DBIx::Class::ResultSet. Equivalent to:

        $schema-&gt;resultset($source_name)-&gt;populate([...]);

       NOTE
           The  context  of  this  method  call has an important effect on what is submitted to storage. In void
           context data is fed directly to fastpath insertion routines provided by the underlying storage  (most
           often  "execute_for_fetch" in DBI), bypassing the new and insert calls on the Result class, including
           any augmentation of these methods provided by components. For example if you are using something like
           DBIx::Class::UUIDColumns to create primary keys for you, you will find that your PKs are  empty.   In
           this case you will have to explicitly force scalar or list context in order to create those values.

   <b>connection</b>
       Arguments: @args
       Return Value: $new_schema

       Similar to "connect" except sets the storage object and connection data in-place on the Schema class. You
       should probably be calling "connect" to get a proper Schema object instead.

       <u>Overloading</u>

       Overload "connection" to change the behaviour of "connect".

   <b>compose_namespace</b>
       Arguments: $target_namespace, $additional_base_class?
       Return Value: $new_schema

       For  each  DBIx::Class::ResultSource  in  the schema, this method creates a class in the target namespace
       (e.g. $target_namespace::CD, $target_namespace::Artist) that  inherits  from  the  corresponding  classes
       attached to the current schema.

       It  also  attaches  a  corresponding  DBIx::Class::ResultSource  object  to  the  new  $schema object. If
       $additional_base_class is given, the new composed classes will inherit from first the corresponding class
       from the current schema then the base class.

       For example, for a schema with My::Schema::CD and My::Schema::Artist classes,

         $schema-&gt;compose_namespace('My::DB', 'Base::Class');
         print join (', ', @My::DB::CD::ISA) . "\n";
         print join (', ', @My::DB::Artist::ISA) ."\n";

       will produce the output

         My::Schema::CD, Base::Class
         My::Schema::Artist, Base::Class

   <b>svp_begin</b>
       Creates  a   new   savepoint   (does   nothing   outside   a   transaction).    Equivalent   to   calling
       $schema-&gt;storage-&gt;svp_begin.  See "svp_begin" in DBIx::Class::Storage for more information.

   <b>svp_release</b>
       Releases    a    savepoint    (does    nothing   outside   a   transaction).    Equivalent   to   calling
       $schema-&gt;storage-&gt;svp_release.  See "svp_release" in DBIx::Class::Storage for more information.

   <b>svp_rollback</b>
       Rollback  to   a   savepoint   (does   nothing   outside   a   transaction).    Equivalent   to   calling
       $schema-&gt;storage-&gt;svp_rollback.  See "svp_rollback" in DBIx::Class::Storage for more information.

   <b>clone</b>
       Arguments: %attrs?
       Return Value: $new_schema

       Clones  the schema and its associated result_source objects and returns the copy. The resulting copy will
       have the same attributes as the source schema, except for those attributes explicitly overridden  by  the
       provided %attrs.

   <b>throw_exception</b>
       Arguments: $message

       Throws  an  exception.  Obeys the exemption rules of DBIx::Class::Carp to report errors from outer-user's
       perspective. See "exception_action" for details on overriding this method's behavior.  If "stacktrace" is
       turned on, "throw_exception"'s default behavior will provide a detailed stack trace.

   <b>deploy</b>
       Arguments: \%sqlt_args, $dir

       Attempts to deploy the schema to the current storage using SQL::Translator.

       See "METHODS" in SQL::Translator for a list of values for "\%sqlt_args".  The most common value for  this
       would  be  "{  add_drop_table  =&gt; 1 }" to have the SQL produced include a "DROP TABLE" statement for each
       table created. For quoting purposes supply "quote_identifiers".

       Additionally, the DBIx::Class parser accepts a "sources" parameter  as  a  hash  ref  or  an  array  ref,
       containing  a  list  of  source  to  deploy.  If present, then only the sources listed will get deployed.
       Furthermore, you can use the "add_fk_index" parser parameter to prevent the parser from creating an index
       for each FK.

   <b>deployment_statements</b>
       Arguments: See "deployment_statements" in DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI
       Return Value: $listofstatements

       A convenient shortcut to "$self-&gt;storage-&gt;deployment_statements($self, @args)".  Returns  the  statements
       used by "deploy" and "deploy" in DBIx::Class::Storage.

   <b>create_ddl_dir</b>
       Arguments: See "create_ddl_dir" in DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI

       A convenient shortcut to "$self-&gt;storage-&gt;create_ddl_dir($self, @args)".

       Creates  an  SQL  file  based  on  the  Schema,  for  each  of the specified database types, in the given
       directory.

   <b>ddl_filename</b>
       Arguments: $database-type, $version, $directory, $preversion
       Return Value: $normalised_filename

         my $filename = $table-&gt;ddl_filename($type, $version, $dir, $preversion)

       This method is called by "create_ddl_dir" to compose a file name out of the supplied directory,  database
       type and version number. The default file name format is: "$dir$schema-$version-$type.sql".

       You may override this method in your schema if you wish to use a different format.

        WARNING

        Prior to DBIx::Class version 0.08100 this method had a different signature:

           my $filename = $table-&gt;ddl_filename($type, $dir, $version, $preversion)

        In recent versions variables $dir and $version were reversed in order to
        bring the signature in line with other Schema/Storage methods. If you
        really need to maintain backward compatibility, you can do the following
        in any overriding methods:

           ($dir, $version) = ($version, $dir) if ($DBIx::Class::VERSION &lt; 0.08100);

   <b>thaw</b>
       Provided  as the recommended way of thawing schema objects. You can call "Storable::thaw" directly if you
       wish, but the thawed objects will not have a reference to any schema, so are rather useless.

   <b>freeze</b>
       This doesn't actually do anything beyond calling nfreeze, it is just provided here for symmetry.

   <b>dclone</b>
       Arguments: $object
       Return Value: dcloned $object

       Recommended way of dcloning DBIx::Class::Row and DBIx::Class::ResultSet objects so  their  references  to
       the schema object (which itself is <b>not</b> cloned) are properly maintained.

   <b>schema_version</b>
       Returns the current schema class' $VERSION in a normalised way.

   <b>register_class</b>
       Arguments: $source_name, $component_class

       This  method  is  called  by  "load_namespaces" and "load_classes" to install the found classes into your
       Schema. You should be using those instead of this one.

       You will only need this method if you have your Result classes in files which are  not  named  after  the
       packages (or all in the same file). You may also need it to register classes at runtime.

       Registers a class which isa DBIx::Class::ResultSourceProxy. Equivalent to calling:

         $schema-&gt;register_source($source_name, $component_class-&gt;result_source_instance);

   <b>register_source</b>
       Arguments: $source_name, $result_source

       This method is called by "register_class".

       Registers the DBIx::Class::ResultSource in the schema with the given source name.

   <b>unregister_source</b>
       Arguments: $source_name

       Removes the DBIx::Class::ResultSource from the schema for the given source name.

   <b>register_extra_source</b>
       Arguments: $source_name, $result_source

       As "register_source" but should be used if the result class already has a source and you want to register
       an extra one.

   <b>compose_connection</b> <b>(DEPRECATED)</b>
