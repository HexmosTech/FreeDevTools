</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       XML::Compile::Translate - create an XML data parser

</pre><h4><b>INHERITANCE</b></h4><pre>
        XML::Compile::Translate is extended by
          XML::Compile::Translate::Reader
          XML::Compile::Translate::Template
          XML::Compile::Translate::Writer

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        # for internal use only
        my $code = XML::Compile::Translate-&gt;compile(...);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module converts a schema type definition into a code reference which can be used to interpret a
       schema.  The sole public function in this package is <b>compile()</b>, and is called by
       <b>XML::Compile::Schema::compile()</b>, which does a lot of set-ups.  Please do not try to use this package
       directly!

       The code in this package interprets schemas; it understands, for instance, how complexType definitions
       work.  Then, when the schema syntax is decoded, it will knot the pieces together into one CODE reference
       which can be used in the main user program.

   <b>Unsupported</b> <b>features</b>
       This implementation is work in progress, but by far most structures in W3C schemas are implemented (and
       tested!).

       Missing are
        schema noNamespaceSchemaLocation
        any ##local
        anyAttribute ##local

       Some things do not work in schemas anyway: "import", "include".  They only work if everyone always has a
       working connection to internet.  You have to require them manually.  Include also does work, because it
       does not use namespaces.  (see <b>XML::Compile::Schema::importDefinitions()</b>)

       Ignored, because not for our purpose is the search optimization information: "key, unique, keyref,
       selector, field", and de schema documentation: "notation, annotation".  Compile the schema schema itself
       to interpret the message if you need them.

       A few nuts are still to crack:
        openContent
        facets on dates and base64Binary
        final is not protected

       Of course, the latter list is all fixed in next release ;-) See chapter "DETAILS" for more on how the
       tune the translator.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Constructors</b>
       $obj-&gt;<b>new</b>($translator, %options)
           The %options are described in <b>XML::Compile::Schema::compile()</b>.  Those descriptions will probably move
           here, eventually.

            -Option--Default
             nss     &lt;required&gt;

           nss =&gt; XML::Compile::Schema::NameSpaces
       $obj-&gt;<b>register</b>($name)
       XML::Compile::Translate-&gt;<b>register</b>($name)
           Register a new back-end.

           example:

            use XML::Compile::Translate::SomeBackend;
            XML::Compile::Translate::SomeBackend-&gt;register('SomeNAME');
            my $coderef = $schemas-&gt;compile('SomeNAME' =&gt; ...);

   <b>Attributes</b>
   <b>Handlers</b>
       XML::Compile::Translate-&gt;<b>compile</b>($element|$attribute|$type, %options)
           Do  not  call  this  function  yourself,  but use <b>XML::Compile::Schema::compile()</b> (or wrappers around
           that).

           This function returns a CODE reference, which can translate  between  Perl  datastructures  and  XML,
           based  on  a  schema.   Before this method is called is the schema already translated into a table of
           types.

</pre><h4><b>DETAILS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Translator</b> <b>options</b>
       <u>performance</u> <u>optimization</u>

       The <b>XML::Compile::Schema::compile()</b> method (and wrappers) defines a set options to improve performance or
       usability.  These options are translated into the executed code: compile time, not run-time!

       The following options with their implications:

       sloppy_integers BOOLEAN
           The "integer" type, as defined by the schema built-in  specification,  accepts  really  huge  values.
           Also the derived types, like "nonNegativeInteger" can contain much larger values than Perl's internal
           "long".  Therefore, the module will start to use Math::BigInt for these types if needed.

           However,  in  most cases, people design "integer" where an "int" suffices.  The use of big-int values
           comes with heigh performance costs.  Set this option to "true" when you are sure  that  ALL  USES  of
           "integer" in the scheme will fit into signed longs (are between -2147483648 and 2147483647 inclusive)

           If you do not want limit the number-space, you can safely add
             use  Math::BigInt  try  =&gt;  'GMP'  to  the top of your main program, and install Math::BigInt::GMP.
           Then, a C library will do the work, much faster than the Perl implementation.

       sloppy_floats BOOLEAN
           The float types of XML are all quite big, and may be NaN, INF, and -INF.   Perl's  normal  floats  do
           not, and therefore Math::BigFloat is used.  This, however, is slow.

           When  this option is true, your application will crash on any value which is not understood by Perl's
           internal float implementation... but run much faster.

       check_values BOOLEAN
           Check the validity of the values, before parsing them.  This  will  report  errors  for  the  reader,
           instead of crashes.  The writer will not produce invalid data.

       check_occurs BOOLEAN
           Checking  whether  the  number  of  occurrences  for  an item are between "minOccurs" and "maxOccurs"
           (implied for "all", "sequence", and "choice" or explicitly specified)  takes  time.   Of  course,  in
           cases  errors  must  be handled.  When this option is set to "false", only distinction between single
           and array elements is made.

       ignore_facets BOOLEAN
           Facets limit field content in the restriction block of a simpleType.  When this option is "true",  no
           checks  are  performed  on  the  values.   In  some  cases,  this may cause problems: especially with
           whiteSpace and digits of floats.  However, you may be able to control this yourself.  In most  cases,
           luck even plays a part in this.  Less checks means a better performance.

           Simple  type  restrictions  are not implemented by other XML perl modules.  When the schema is nicely
           detailed, this will give extra security.

       validation BOOLEAN
           When used, it overrules the above "check_values", "check_occurs",  and  "ignore_facets"  options.   A
           true  value  enables  all  checks, a false value will disable them all.  Of course, the latter is the
           fastest but also less secure: your program will need to validate the values in some other way.

           XML::LibXML has its own validate method, but I have not yet seen any performance figures on that.  If
           you use it, however, it is of course a good idea to turn XML::Compile's validation off.

       <u>qualified</u> <u>XML</u>

       The produced XML may not use the name-spaces as defined by the schemas, just to simplify  the  input  and
       output.  The structural definition of the schemas is still in-tact, but name-space collission may appear.

       Per  schema,  it  can  be  specified whether the elements and attributes defined in-there need to be used
       qualified (with prefix) or not.  This can  cause  horrible  output  when  within  an  unqualified  schema
       elements are used from another schema which is qualified.

       The  suggested  solution  in  articles about the subject is to provide people with both a schema which is
       qualified as one which is not.  Perl is known to be blunt in its approach: we simply define a flag  which
       can  force  one  of  both on all schemas together, using "elements_qualified" and "attributes_qualified".
       May people and applications do not understand name-spaces sufficiently, and these options may  make  your
       day!

       <u>Name-spaces</u>

       The translator does respect name-spaces, but not all senders and receivers of XML are name-space capable.
       Therefore, you have some options to interfere.

       prefixes HASH|ARRAY-of-PAIRS
           The  translator  will  create  XML  elements  (WRITER)  which  use  name-spaces,  based  on  its  own
           name-space/prefix mapping administration.  This is needed because the XML tree is created  bottom-up,
           where XML::LibXML namespace management can only handle this top-down.

           When your pass your own HASH as argument, you can explicitly specify the prefixes you like to be used
           for  which  name-space.   Found name-spaces will be added to the HASH, as well the use count.  When a
           new name-space URI is discovered, an attempt is made to use the prefix as found in the schema. Prefix
           collisions are actively avoided: when two URIs want the same prefix, a sequence number  is  added  to
           one of them which makes it unique.

           The HASH structure looks like this:

             my %namespaces =
               ( myns =&gt; { uri =&gt; 'myns', prefix =&gt; 'mypref', used =&gt; 1}
               , ...  =&gt; { uri =&gt; ... }
               );

             my $make = $schema-&gt;compile
               ( WRITER =&gt; ...
               , prefixes =&gt; \%namespaces
               );

             # share the same namespace defs with another component
             my $other = $schema-&gt;compile
               ( WRITER =&gt; ...
               , prefixes =&gt; \%namespaces
               );

           When  used  is  specified  and  larger than 0, then the namespace will appear in the top-level output
           element (unless "include_namespaces" is false).

           Initializing using an ARRAY is a little simpler:

            prefixes =&gt; [ mypref =&gt; 'myns', ... =&gt; ... ];

           However, be warned that this does not work well with a false value for "include_namespaces": detected
           namespaces are added to an internal HASH now, which is not returned; that information is  lost.   You
           will need to know each used namespace beforehand.

       include_namespaces BOOLEAN|CODE
           When  true  and WRITER, the top level returned XML element will contain the prefix definitions.  Only
           name-spaces which are actually used will be included (a count is kept by  the  translator).   It  may
           very  well  list name-spaces which are not in the actual output because the fields which require them
           are not included for there is not value for those fields.

           If you like to combine XML output from separate translated parts (for instance in case of  generating
           SOAP),  you  may want to delay the inclusion of name-spaces until a higher level of the XML hierarchy
           which is produced later.

           When a CODE reference is passed, it will be called for each used namespace, with the uri  and  prefix
           as parameters.  Only when the CODE returns true, the namespace declaration will be included.

           When the compilation produces an attribute, then this option cannot be used.

       namespace_reset BOOLEAN
           You  can  pass the same HASH to a next call to a reader or writer to get consistent name-space usage.
           However, when "include_namespaces" is used, you may get ghost name-space listings.  This option  will
           reset the counts on all defined name-spaces.

       use_default_namespace BOOLEAN (added in release 0.57)
           When  a  true value, the blank prefix will be used for the first namespace URI which requires a auto-
           generated prefix.  However, in quite some environments, people mix horrible  non-namespace  qualified
           elements  with  nice  namespace qualified elements.  In such situations, namespace the qualified-but-
           default prefix (i.e., no prefix) is confusing.  Therefore, the option defaults to false: do  not  use
           the invisible prefix.

           You may explicitly specify a blank prefix with "prefixes", which will be used when applicable.

       block_namespace NAMESPACE|TYPE|HASH|CODE|ARRAY
           [1.06]    Available    on    global    scale    via   XML::Compile::Schema::new(block_namespace)   or
           <b>XML::Compile::Schema::blockNamespace()</b>,    and    for    a    single    compiled     instance     via
           XML::Compile::Schema::compile(block_namespace).

           Some  schemas  include  other  schemas which you do not need.  For instance, the other schema is only
           used in rare cases, or the other schema defines deprecated types and elements.  Of  course,  you  can
           simply  not  load those schemas... however: the main schema may refer to those types and elements you
           do not need.  So, with this option, you can make the  compilation  to  ignore  whole  namespaces  and
           specific elements or types.

           The NAMESPACE is a uri, which will disable use of any element or type defined in that space.  You may
           also  provide  a  specific  full $type (toplevel element or type name).  You may also give an LIST or
           ARRAY of these, but then a HASH is much more suitable: with linear lookup time.

           When you provide a CODE reference, it will be called for each type and element to be judged.   Passed
           are  $type,  $ns,  $local, and $path.  The "$ns/$local" is the decomposition of $type.  When the CODE
           returns "undef", then it is undecisive, letting other rules decide.  When  it  returns  0,  then  the
           thing  will  not be blocked (whatever the other rules decide).  In other cases, the thing will not be
           used.

             # block a whole namespace
             $schema-&gt;blockNamespace("<a href="http://xyz.example.com">http://xyz.example.com</a>");

             # block only a single element or typedef
             $schema-&gt;blockNamespace("{<a href="http://xyz.example.com">http://xyz.example.com</a>}buggy");

             # block $ns1 and $type1, unblock $ns2
             $schema-&gt;blockNamespace( {$ns1 =&gt; 1, $ns2 =&gt; 0, $type1 =&gt; 1} );

             $schema-&gt;blockNamespace($ns1, $type1);
             $schema-&gt;compile(..., block_namespace =&gt; [$ns1, $type1]);
             $schema-&gt;new(..., block_namespace =&gt; [$ns1, $type1]);

             # very flexible
             sub want_block($$$$) ( my ($type,$ns,$local,$path) = @_; undef}
             $schema-&gt;blockNamespace(\&amp;want_block);

           It is very well possible that the blocking of some namespaces breaks the validness of messages:  when
           those elements are required but set to be ignored.  There is no way to detect this, on the moment.

       <u>Wildcards</u> <u>handlers</u>

       Wildcards  are a serious complication: the "any" and "anyAttribute" entities do not describe exactly what
       can be found, which seriously hinders the quality of validation  and  the  preparation  of  XML::Compile.
       Therefore, if you use them then you need to process that parts of XML yourself.  See the various backends
       on how to create or process these elements.

       Automatic  decoding  is  problematic:  you  do not know what to expect, so cannot prepare for these data-
       structures compile-time.  However, XML::Compile::Cache offers a way out: you can declare the handlers for
       these     "any"     components     and     therewith      be      prepared      for      them.       With
       XML::Compile::Cache::new(allow_undeclared), you can permit run-time compilation of  the found components.

       any_element CODE|'TAKE_ALL'|'SKIP_ALL'
           [0.89]  This  will  be called when the type definition contains an "any" definition, after processing
           the other element components.  By default, all "any" specifications will be ignored.

       any_attribute CODE|'TAKE_ALL'|'SKIP_ALL'
           [0.89] This will be called when the type definitions contains  an  "anyAttribute"  definition,  after
           processing the other attributes.  By default, all "anyAttribute" specifications will be ignored.

       any_type CODE
           [1.07]  Called for processing an "xsd:anyType" element.  Currently only supported for the reader.  By
           default, it returns a string when the element does not contains sub-elements, otherwise the XML node.
