</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       SOAP::WSDL::Manual::XSD - SOAP::WSDL's XML Schema implementation

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       SOAP::WSDL's XML Schema implementation translates XML Schema definitions into perl classes.

       Every top-level type or element in a XML schema is translated into a perl class (usually in it's own
       file).

       Atomic types are either directly included in the class of their parent's node, or as sub-package in their
       parent class' file.

       While the implementation is still incomplete, it covers the XML schema definitions used by most object
       mappers.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       You can use SOAP::WSDL::XSD based classes just like any perl class - you may instantiate it, inherit from
       it etc.

       You should be aware, that SOAP::WSDL::XSD based classes are inside-out classes using Class::Std::Fast,
       though - things you would expect from hash-based classes like using the blessed hash ref as data storage
       won't work.

       Moreover, most all SOAP::WSDL::XSD::Typelib based classes override Class::Std::Fast's default constructor
       for speed - you should not expect BUILD or START methods to work, unless you call them yourself (or
       define a new constructor).

       All SOAP::WSDL::XSD based complexType classes allow a hash ref matching their data structure as only
       parameter to <b>new()</b>. You may mix hash and list refs and objects in the structure passed to new - as long
       as the structure matches, it will work fine.

       All SOAP::WSDL::XSD based simpleType (and builtin) classes accept a single hash ref with the only key
       "value" and the value to be set as value.

   <b>Conversions</b>
       <u>Array</u> <u>dereference</u>

       All SOAP::WSDL::XSD based classes overload arrayification - that is being accessed as a list ref - with a
       method returning [ $self ].

       This means that you can safely use the results of get_ELEMENT calls on complexTypes as list refs (you'll
       have to check for definedness, though - see SOAP::WSDL::XSD::Typelib::Builtin for details.

       To iterate over a (potential) list of child elements just do the following:

        if (defined $obj-&gt;get_ELEMENT()) {
            for (@{ $obj-&gt;get_ELEMENT() }) {
               ...
            }
        }

       This is especially useful in mini-languages like HTML::Template::Compiled, where you could say

        &lt;%IF_DEFINED obj.get_ELEMENT %&gt;
           &lt;%LOOP obj.get_ELEMENT %&gt;
              ...
           &lt;%/LOOP&gt;
        &lt;%IF%&gt;

       Note that this does not work in HTML::Template::Compiled yet - the code generated for the template checks
       UNIVERSAL::isa instead of dereferencing.  There's a ticket open in HTC to solve the issue.

       <u>as_hash_ref</u>

       SOAP::WSDL::XSD::Typelib::ComplexType based objects have a method as_hash_ref, which returns the object's
       content as a hash reference.

       This can be convenient for cloning:

        my $class = ref $old;
        my $clone = $class-&gt;new( $old-&gt;as_hash_ref() );

       To convert from one type to another, you can just say

        my $new = MyTypes::NewType-&gt;new( $old-&gt;as_hash_ref() );

       Of course this will only work if MyTypes::NewType has a superset of the old object class' elements.

       Note that XML attribute data is not included in the hash ref output yet.

</pre><h4><b>HOW</b> <b>IT</b> <b>WORKS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Base</b> <b>classes</b>
       SOAP::WSDL::XSD provides a set of base classes for the construction of XML schema defined type classes.

       <u>Builtin</u> <u>types</u>

       SOAP::WSDL::XSD provides classes for all builtin XML Schema datatypes.

       For a list and reference on these classes, see SOAP::WSDL::XSD::Typelib::Builtin.

       <u>Derivation</u> <u>classes</u>

       For derivation by list, the list derivation class SOAP::WSDL::XSD::Typelib::Builtin::list exists.

       Derivation by restriction is handled without the help of additional classes.

       <u>Element</u> <u>construction</u> <u>class</u>

       For the construction of element classes, the element superclass SOAP::WSDL::XSD::Typelib::Element exists.
       All elements are ultimately derived from this class. Elements may inherit from type classes, too - see
       "TRANSLATION RULES" for details.

       <u>complexType</u> <u>construction</u> <u>class</u>

       For the construction of complexType classes, the construction class SOAP::WSDL::XSD::Typelib::ComplexType
       is provided. It provides a __factory method for placing attributes in generated classes, and generating
       appropriate setter/getter accessors.

       The setters are special: They handle complex data structures of any type (meaning hash refs, list refs
       and objects, and any combination of them), as long as their structure matches the expected structure.

       TODO add more elaborate description

       Some content models are not implemented yet. The content models implemented are described below.

       <u>complexType</u> <u>with</u> <u>"all"</u> <u>variety</u>

       Complex types with "all" variety inherit from SOAP::WSDL::XSD::Typelib::ComplexType, and call it's
       factory method for creating fields and accessors/mutators for the complexType's elements.

       All element's type classes are loaded. Complex type classes have a "has a" relationship to their element
       fields.

       Element fields may either be element classes (for element ref="") or type classes (for element type="").
       No extra element classes are created for a complexType's elements.

        element name="a" ------------&gt; Element or type class object
        element name="b" ------------&gt; Element or type class object

       The implementation for all does enforce the order of elements as described in the WSDL, even though this
       is not required by the XML Schema specification.

       <u>complexType</u> <u>with</u> <u>"sequence"</u> <u>variety</u>

       The implementation of the "sequence" variety is the same as for all.

       <u>complexType</u> <u>with</u> <u>"choice"</u> <u>variety</u>

       The implementation for choice currently is the same as for all - which means, no check for occurrence are
       made.

       <u>complexType</u> <u>with</u> <u>complexContent</u> <u>content</u> <u>model</u>

       Note that complexType classes with complexContent content model don't exhibit their type via the xsi:type
       attribute yet, so they currently cannot be used as a replacement for their base type.

       SOAP::WSDL's XSD deserializer backend does not recognize the xsi:type="" attribute either yet.

       •   restriction variety

           ComplexType  classes with restriction variety inherit from their base type.  No additional processing
           or content checking is performed yet.

               complexType
             base type class

                   |
              complexType
              restriction

       •   extension variety

           ComplexType classes with extension variety inherit from the XSD base complexType class and from their
           base type.

           Extension classes are checked for (re-)defining all elements of their parent class.

           Note that a derived type's elements (=properties) overrides the  getter  /  setter  methods  for  all
           inherited  elements. All object data is stored in the derived type's class, not in the defining class
           (See Class::Std for a discussion on inside out object data storage).

           No additional processing or content checking is performed yet.

       TODO add more elaborate description

       Some derivation methods are not implemented yet. The derivation methods implemented are described below.

       <u>Derivation</u> <u>by</u> <u>list</u>

       Derivation   by   list   is   implemented   by   inheriting    from    both    the    base    type    and
       SOAP::WSDL::XSD::Typelib::XSD::list.

       <u>Derivation</u> <u>by</u> <u>restriction</u>

       Derivation  by  restriction  is  implemented  by  inheriting  from  a base type and applying the required
       restrictions.

</pre><h4><b>FACETS</b></h4><pre>
       XML Schema facets are not implemented yet.

       They will probably implemented some day by putting constant methods into the correspondent classes.

   <b>Attributes</b>
       The attribute set for a XML element (derived from anySimpleType or complexType) is implemented as a  sub-
       package of the element derived from SOAP::WSDL::XSD::Typelib::AttributeSet.

       The  sub-package  is  named  as  the  corresponding type or element package, suffixed with "XmlAttr". The
       suffix "XmlAttr" has carefully been chosen to avoid potential naming clashes: The name XmlAttr cannot  be
       included  as  element  or type name in XML schemas - the XML standard bans the use of names starting with
       "xml" (case-insensitive).

       All XML attributes for a XML element are set- and retrievable via the method "attr". The name  is  chosen
       to  allow  mimicking  SOAP::Lite's  behaviour,  which allows setting a SOAP::Data object's attributes via
       "attr".

        my $attrSet = $obj-&gt;attr();
        $obj-&gt;attr({
            whitespace =&gt; 'preserve',
            nillable =&gt; 1,
        });

       SOAP::WSDL::XSD::Typelib::AttributeSet is derived from SOAP::WSDL::XSD::Typelib::ComplexType with content
       model "all". The individual attributes can be set and retrieved via  the  respective  set_FOO  /  get_FOO
       methods.

       The  "attr"  method  provides  auto-vivification:  An  xml  object's  attribute  set is instantiated when
       accessed.

       Auto-vivification is only triggered if there actually <b>is</b> a set of  attributes  for  the  class/object  in
       question, so you may want to test whether the result of -&gt;attr is defined:

        my $attr = $unknownObject-&gt;attr();
        if (defined($attr)) {
            $unknownObject-&gt;attr({
                some =&gt; 'value',
            });
        }

   <b>group</b>
       CAVEAT: Group resolution is not implemented yet.

       XML  Schema Group definitions are just treated as aliases that can be inserted in complexType definitions
       by referencing them. That is, there's no difference  between  a  complexType  with  simpleContent  and  a
       sequence  of three elements, and a complexType with simpleContent referencing a group containing the same
       sequence of elements.

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
       •   START and BUILD are not being called

           In contrast to "normal" Class::Std::Fast based objects, the classes of the SOAP::WSDL::XSD::Typelib::
           hierarchy  (and  all  type  and  element  classes  generated  by  SOAP::WSDL)  override  Class::Std's
           constructor for performance reasons.

           If you inherit from such a class and place a START or BUILD method in it, it will not get called - at
           least not unless you place something like this at the top of you code:

            use Class::Std::Fast::Storable;

           In  this  case,  Class::Std::Fast::Storable will export a <b>new()</b> method into your class, which in turn
           calls START and BUILD.

           The constructors of all SOAP::WSDL::XSD::Typelib:: classes don't !

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following XML Schema declaration elements are not supported yet:

   <b>XML</b> <b>Schema</b> <b>elements</b> <b>partially</b> <b>supported</b>
       <u>Type</u> <u>definition</u> <u>elements</u>

       •   simpleContent

           simpleContent  is  only  supported  with  a  restriction  or  extension  with  a  "base"   attribute.
           simpleContent declarations deriving from a atomic type are not supported (yet).

       <u>Inclusion</u> <u>elements</u>

       •   import

           The  import  inclusion  element requires the schemaLocation attribute for resolving the XML schema to
           import.  Support  for  the  import  element  is  implemented  in  SOAP::WSDL::Expat::WSDLParser,   so
           alternative parsers may or may not support the import element.

           SOAP::WSDL::Expat::WSDLParser keeps track of included schemas and prevents import loops.

       <u>Facets</u>

       The following XML Schema declaration elements are supported, but have no effect yet.

       •   enumeration

       •   fractionDigits

       •   length

       •   maxExclusive

       •   maxInclusiove

       •   anyAttribute

       •   attributeGroup

           "attributeGroup"  declarations  actually  just  are  macros  for  XML  Schema  writers:  Including an
           attributeGroup in a declaration has the same effect as including all attributes in the group.

           Just not implemented yet.

       •   group

           The group definition element is not supported yet.

       <u>Identity</u> <u>definition</u> <u>elements</u>

       These declaration elements don't declare XML elements, but  apply  identity  constraints.  They  have  no
       effect yet.
