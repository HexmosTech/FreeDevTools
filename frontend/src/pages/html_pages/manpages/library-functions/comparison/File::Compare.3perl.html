</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       File::Compare - Compare files or filehandles

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
               use File::Compare;

               if (compare("file1", "file2") == 0) {
                   print "They're equal\n";
               }

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The "File::Compare::compare" function compares the contents of two sources, each of which can be a file
       or a file handle.  It is exported from "File::Compare" by default.

       "File::Compare::cmp" is a synonym for "File::Compare::compare".  It is exported from "File::Compare" only
       by request.

       "File::Compare::compare_text" does a line by line comparison of the two files. It stops as soon as a
       difference is detected. compare_text() accepts an optional third argument: This must be a CODE reference
       to a line comparison function, which returns 0 when both lines are considered equal. For example:

           compare_text($file1, $file2)

       is basically equivalent to

           compare_text($file1, $file2, sub {$_[0] ne $_[1]} )

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b></h4><pre>
       "File::Compare::compare" and its sibling functions return 0 if the files are equal, 1 if the files are
       unequal, or -1 if an error was encountered.

</pre><h4><b>AUTHOR</b></h4><pre>
       "File::Compare" was written by Nick Ing-Simmons.  Its original documentation was written by Chip
       Salzenberg.
