       PSPOSVX uses the Cholesky factorization A = U**T*U or A = L*L**T to compute the solution to a real system
       of linear equations

       where  A(IA:IA+N-1,JA:JA+N-1)  is  an  N-by-N  matrix  and  X and B(IB:IB+N-1,JB:JB+NRHS-1) are N-by-NRHS
       matrices.

       Error bounds on the solution and a condition estimate are also provided.  In  the  following  comments  Y
       denotes Y(IY:IY+M-1,JY:JY+K-1) a M-by-K matrix where Y can be A, AF, B and X.

       Notes
       =====

       Each  global  data  object  is  described  by  an  associated description vector.  This vector stores the
       information required to establish the mapping between an object element and its corresponding process and
       memory location.

       Let A be a generic term for any 2D block  cyclicly  distributed  array.   Such  a  global  array  has  an
       associated  description  vector  DESCA.  In the following comments, the character _ should be read as "of
       the global array".

       NOTATION        STORED IN      EXPLANATION
       --------------- -------------- -------------------------------------- DTYPE_A(global) DESCA( DTYPE_  )The
       descriptor type.  In this case,
                                      DTYPE_A = 1.
       CTXT_A (global) DESCA( CTXT_ ) The BLACS context handle, indicating
                                      the BLACS process grid A is distribu-
                                      ted over. The context itself is glo-
                                      bal, but the handle (the integer
                                      value) may vary.
       M_A    (global) DESCA( M_ )    The number of rows in the global
                                      array A.
       N_A    (global) DESCA( N_ )    The number of columns in the global
                                      array A.
       MB_A   (global) DESCA( MB_ )   The blocking factor used to distribute
                                      the rows of the array.
       NB_A   (global) DESCA( NB_ )   The blocking factor used to distribute
                                      the columns of the array.
       RSRC_A (global) DESCA( RSRC_ ) The process row over which the first
                                      row  of  the  array  A is distributed.  CSRC_A (global) DESCA( CSRC_ ) The
       process column over which the
                                      first column of the array A is
                                      distributed.
       LLD_A  (local)  DESCA( LLD_ )  The leading dimension of the local
                                      array.  LLD_A &gt;= MAX(1,LOCr(M_A)).

       Let K be the number of rows or columns of a distributed matrix, and assume  that  its  process  grid  has
       dimension p x q.
       LOCr( K ) denotes the number of elements of K that a process would receive if K were distributed over the
       p processes of its process column.
       Similarly,  LOCc(  K  )  denotes  the  number  of  elements  of  K that a process would receive if K were
       distributed over the q processes of its process row.
       The values of LOCr() and LOCc() may be determined via a call to the ScaLAPACK tool function, NUMROC:
               LOCr( M ) = NUMROC( M, MB_A, MYROW, RSRC_A, NPROW ),
               LOCc( N ) = NUMROC( N, NB_A, MYCOL, CSRC_A, NPCOL ).  An upper bound for these quantities may  be
       computed by:
               LOCr( M ) &lt;= ceil( ceil(M/MB_A)/NPROW )*MB_A
               LOCc( N ) &lt;= ceil( ceil(N/NB_A)/NPCOL )*NB_A

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The following steps are performed:

       1. If FACT = 'E', real scaling factors are computed to equilibrate
          the system:
             diag(SR) * A * diag(SC) * inv(diag(SC)) * X = diag(SR) * B
          Whether or not the system will be equilibrated depends on the
          scaling of the matrix A, but if equilibration is used, A is
          overwritten by diag(SR)*A*diag(SC) and B by diag(SR)*B.

       2. If FACT = 'N' or 'E', the Cholesky decomposition is used to
          factor the matrix A (after equilibration if FACT = 'E') as
             A = U**T* U,  if UPLO = 'U', or
             A = L * L**T,  if UPLO = 'L',
          where U is an upper triangular matrix and L is a lower triangular
          matrix.

       3. The factored form of A is used to estimate the condition number
          of the matrix A.  If the reciprocal of the condition number is
          less than machine precision, steps 4-6 are skipped.

       4. The system of equations is solved for X using the factored form
          of A.

       5. Iterative refinement is applied to improve the computed solution
          matrix and calculate error bounds and backward error estimates
          for it.

       6. If equilibration was used, the matrix X is premultiplied by
          diag(SR) so that it solves the original system before
          equilibration.

</pre><h4><b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       FACT    (global input) CHARACTER
               Specifies  whether  or  not  the  factored form of the matrix A is supplied on entry, and if not,
               whether the matrix A should be equilibrated before it is factored.  = 'F':  On entry, AF contains
               the factored form of A.  If EQUED = 'Y', the matrix A has been equilibrated with scaling  factors
               given  by  S.   A  and  AF  will  not be modified.  = 'N':  The matrix A will be copied to AF and
               factored.
               = 'E':  The matrix A will be equilibrated if necessary, then copied to AF and factored.

       UPLO    (global input) CHARACTER
               = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;
               = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.

       N       (global input) INTEGER
               The number of rows and columns to be operated on, i.e. the order  of  the  distributed  submatrix
               A(IA:IA+N-1,JA:JA+N-1).  N &gt;= 0.

       NRHS    (global input) INTEGER
               The  number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns of the distributed submatrices B and
               X.  NRHS &gt;= 0.

       A       (local input/local output) REAL pointer into
               the local memory to an array of local dimension ( LLD_A, LOCc(JA+N-1) ).  On entry, the symmetric
               matrix A, except if FACT = 'F' and EQUED = 'Y', then  A  must  contain  the  equilibrated  matrix
               diag(SR)*A*diag(SC).   If  UPLO = 'U', the leading N-by-N upper triangular part of A contains the
               upper triangular part of the matrix A, and the  strictly  lower  triangular  part  of  A  is  not
               referenced.   If  UPLO  =  'L',  the leading N-by-N lower triangular part of A contains the lower
               triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly upper triangular part of A is  not  referenced.
               A is not modified if FACT = 'F' or 'N', or if FACT = 'E' and EQUED = 'N' on exit.

               On exit, if FACT = 'E' and EQUED = 'Y', A is overwritten by diag(SR)*A*diag(SC).

               into  the  local  memory  to an array of local dimension ( LLD_AF, LOCc(JA+N-1)).  If FACT = 'F',
               then AF is an input argument and on entry contains the triangular factor U or L from the Cholesky
               factorization A = U**T*U or A = L*L**T, in the same storage format as A.  If EQUED .ne. 'N', then
               AF is the factored form of the equilibrated matrix diag(SR)*A*diag(SC).

               If FACT = 'N', then AF is an output argument and on exit returns the triangular  factor  U  or  L
               from the Cholesky factorization A = U**T*U or A = L*L**T of the original matrix A.

               If  FACT  =  'E',  then AF is an output argument and on exit returns the triangular factor U or L
               from the Cholesky factorization A = U**T*U or A = L*L**T of the equilibrated matrix  A  (see  the
               description of A for the form of the equilibrated matrix).

               The row index in the global array AF indicating the first row of sub( AF ).

       JAF     (global input) INTEGER

       EQUED   (global input/global output) CHARACTER
               Specifies the form of equilibration that was done.  = 'N':  No equilibration (always true if FACT
               = 'N').
               =  'Y':   Equilibration was done, i.e., A has been replaced by diag(SR) * A * diag(SC).  EQUED is
               an input variable if FACT = 'F'; otherwise, it is an output variable.

       SR      (local input/local output) REAL array,
               dimension (LLD_A) The scale factors for A distributed across process rows; not accessed if  EQUED
               =  'N'.   SR  is an input variable if FACT = 'F'; otherwise, SR is an output variable.  If FACT =
               'F' and EQUED = 'Y', each element of SR must be positive.

       SC      (local input/local output) REAL array,
               dimension (LOC(N_A)) The scale factors for A distributed across process columns; not accessed  if
               EQUED = 'N'. SC is an input variable if FACT = 'F'; otherwise, SC is an output variable.  If FACT
               = 'F' and EQUED = 'Y', each element of SC must be positive.

       B       (local input/local output) REAL pointer into
               the  local memory to an array of local dimension ( LLD_B, LOCc(JB+NRHS-1) ).  On entry, the N-by-
               NRHS right-hand side matrix B.  On exit, if EQUED = 'N', B is not modified; if TRANS  =  'N'  and
               EQUED  = 'R' or 'B', B is overwritten by diag(R)*B; if TRANS = 'T' or 'C' and EQUED = 'C' or 'B',
               B is overwritten by diag(C)*B.

       IB      (global input) INTEGER

               by-NRHS solution matrix X to the original system of equations.  Note that A and B are modified on
               exit if EQUED .ne. 'N', and the solution to the equilibrated system is inv(diag(SC))*X if TRANS =
               'N' and EQUED = 'C' or or 'B'.

       IX      (global input) INTEGER
               The row index in the global array X indicating the first row of sub( X ).

       JX      (global input) INTEGER
               The column index in the global array X indicating the first column of sub( X ).

       DESCX   (global and local input) INTEGER array of dimension DLEN_.
               The array descriptor for the distributed matrix X.

       RCOND   (global output) REAL
               The  estimate  of  the reciprocal condition number of the matrix A after equilibration (if done).
               If RCOND is less than the machine precision (in particular, if RCOND = 0), the matrix is singular
               to working precision.  This condition is indicated by a return code of INFO &gt; 0, and the solution
               and error bounds are not computed.

               The estimated forward error bounds for each solution vector X(j) (the j-th column of the solution
               matrix X).  If XTRUE is the true solution, FERR(j) bounds the magnitude of the largest  entry  in
               (X(j)  -  XTRUE) divided by the magnitude of the largest entry in X(j).  The quality of the error
               bound depends on the quality of the estimate  of  norm(inv(A))  computed  in  the  code;  if  the
               estimate of norm(inv(A)) is accurate, the error bound is guaranteed.

       BERR    (local output) REAL array, dimension (LOC(N_B))
               The  componentwise  relative  backward  error  of  each  solution vector X(j) (i.e., the smallest
               relative change in any entry of A or B that makes X(j) an exact solution).

       WORK    (local workspace/local output) REAL array,
               dimension (LWORK) On exit, <a href="../man1/WORK.1.html">WORK</a>(1) returns the minimal and optimal LWORK.

       LWORK   (local or global input) INTEGER
               The dimension of the array WORK.  LWORK is local input and must be at least LWORK = MAX( PSPOCON(
               LWORK ), PSPORFS( LWORK ) ) + LOCr( N_A ).  LWORK = 3*DESCA( LLD_ )

               If LWORK = -1, then LWORK is global input and a workspace query  is  assumed;  the  routine  only
               calculates  the minimum and optimal size for all work arrays. Each of these values is returned in
               the first entry of the corresponding work array, and no error message is issued by PXERBLA.

       IWORK   (local workspace/local output) INTEGER array,
               dimension (LIWORK) On exit, <a href="../man1/IWORK.1.html">IWORK</a>(1) returns the minimal and optimal LIWORK.

       LIWORK  (local or global input) INTEGER
               The dimension of the array IWORK.  LIWORK is local input and must be at  least  LIWORK  =  DESCA(
               LLD_ ) LIWORK = LOCr(N_A).

               If  LIWORK  =  -1, then LIWORK is global input and a workspace query is assumed; the routine only
               calculates the minimum and optimal size for all work arrays. Each of these values is returned  in
               the first entry of the corresponding work array, and no error message is issued by PXERBLA.

       INFO    (global output) INTEGER
               = 0: successful exit
               &lt; 0: if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
               &gt; 0: if INFO = i, and i is
               &lt;=  N:  if  INFO  =  i,  the  leading  minor  of  order  i  of A is not positive definite, so the
               factorization could not be completed, and the solution and error bounds could not be computed.  =
               N+1: RCOND is less than machine precision.  The factorization has been completed, but the  matrix
               is singular to working precision, and the solution and error bounds have not been computed.
