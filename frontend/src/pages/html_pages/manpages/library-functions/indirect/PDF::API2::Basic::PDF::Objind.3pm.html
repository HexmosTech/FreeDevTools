</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       PDF::API2::Basic::PDF::Objind - Low-level PDF indirect object

</pre><h4><b>INSTANCE</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       Instance variables differ from content variables in that they all start with a space.

       parent
           For  an  object  which  is  a  reference to an object in some source, this holds the reference to the
           source object, so that should the reference have to be de-referenced, then we know where  to  go  and
           get the info.

       objnum (R)
           The object number in the source (only for object references)

       objgen (R)
           The object generation in the source

           There are other instance variables which are used by the parent for file control.

       isfree
           This  marks  whether  the  object  is  in  the  free  list and available for re-use as another object
           elsewhere in the file.

       nextfree
           Holds a direct reference to the next free object in the free list.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>PDF::API2::Basic::PDF::Objind-&gt;new()</b>
       Creates a new indirect object

   <b>uid</b>
       Returns a Unique id for this object, creating one if it didn't have one before

   <b>$r-&gt;release</b>
       Releases ALL of the memory used by this indirect object, and all of its  component/child  objects.   This
       method  is called automatically by '"PDF::API2::Basic::PDF::File-&gt;release"' (so you don't have to call it
       yourself).

       <b>Note:</b> it is important that this method get called at some point prior to the actual  destruction  of  the
       object.   Internally,  PDF  files  have  an  enormous amount of cross-references and this causes circular
       references within our own internal data structures.  Calling 'release()' forces these circular references
       to be cleaned up and the entire internal data structure purged.

   <b>$r-&gt;val</b>
       Returns the value of this object or reads the object and then returns its value.

       Note that all direct subclasses *must* make their own versions of this subroutine otherwise we  could  be
       in for a very deep loop!

   <b>$r-&gt;realise</b>
       Makes sure that the object is fully read in, etc.

   <b>$r-&gt;outobjdeep($fh,</b> <b>$pdf)</b>
       If  you really want to output this object, then you must need to read it first.  This also means that all
       direct subclasses must subclass this method or loop forever!

   <b>$r-&gt;outobj($fh)</b>
       If this is a full object then outputs a reference to the object, otherwise calls outobjdeep to output the
       contents of the object at this point.

   <b>$r-&gt;elements</b>
       Abstract superclass function filler. Returns self here but should return  something  more  useful  if  an
       array.

   <b>$r-&gt;empty</b>
       Empties  all  content  from  this object to free up memory or to be read to pass the object into the free
       list. Simplistically undefs all instance variables other than object number and generation.

   <b>$r-&gt;merge($objind)</b>
       This merges content information into an object  reference  place-holder.   This  occurs  when  an  object
       reference  is  read  before the object definition and the information in the read data needs to be merged
       into the object place-holder

   <b>$r-&gt;is_obj($pdf)</b>
       Returns whether this object is a full object with its own object number or whether it is  purely  a  sub-
       object. $pdf indicates which output file we are concerned that the object is an object in.

   <b>$r-&gt;copy($pdf,</b> <b>$res)</b>
       Returns  a  new  copy  of this object. The object is assumed to be some kind of associative array and the
       copy is a deep copy for elements which are not PDF objects, according to $pdf, and shallow copy for those
       that are.  Notice that calling "copy" on an object forces at least a one level copy even if it is  a  PDF
       object. The returned object loses its PDF object status though.

       If  $res  is  defined then the copy goes into that object rather than creating a new one. It is up to the
       caller to bless $res, etc. Notice that elements from $self are not copied into $res if there  is  already
       an entry for them existing in $res.
