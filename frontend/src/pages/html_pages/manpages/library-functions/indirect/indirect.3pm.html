</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       indirect - Lexically warn about using the indirect method call syntax.

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       Version 0.39

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       In a script :

           no indirect;               # lexically enables the pragma
           my $x = new Apple 1, 2, 3; # warns
           {
            use indirect;     # lexically disables the pragma
            my $y = new Pear; # legit, does not warn
            {
             # lexically specify an hook called for each indirect construct
             no indirect hook =&gt; sub {
              die "You really wanted $_[0]\-&gt;$_[1] at $_[2]:$_[3]"
             };
             my $z = new Pineapple 'fresh'; # croaks 'You really wanted...'
            }
           }
           try { ... }; # warns if try() hasn't been declared in this package

           no indirect 'fatal';     # or ':fatal', 'FATAL', ':Fatal' ...
           if (defied $foo) { ... } # croaks, note the typo

       Global uses :

           # Globally enable the pragma from the command-line
           perl -M-indirect=global -e 'my $x = new Banana;' # warns

           # Globally enforce the pragma each time perl is executed
           export PERL5OPT="-M-indirect=global,fatal"
           perl -e 'my $y = new Coconut;' # croaks

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       When enabled, this pragma warns about indirect method calls that are present in your code.

       The indirect syntax is now considered harmful, since its parsing has many quirks and its use is error
       prone : when the subroutine "foo" has not been declared in the current package, "foo $x" actually
       compiles to "$x-&gt;foo", and "foo { key =&gt; 1 }" to "'key'-&gt;<a href="../man1/foo.1.html">foo</a>(1)".  Please refer to the "REFERENCES"
       section for a more complete list of reasons for avoiding this construct.

       This pragma currently does not warn for core functions ("print", "say", "exec" or "system").  This may
       change in the future, or may be added as optional features that would be enabled by passing options to
       "unimport".

       This module is <b>not</b> a source filter.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>"unimport"</b>
           no indirect;
           no indirect 'fatal';
           no indirect hook =&gt; sub { my ($obj, $name, $file, $line) = @_; ... };
           no indirect 'global';
           no indirect 'global, 'fatal';
           no indirect 'global', hook =&gt; sub { ... };

       Magically called when "no indirect @opts" is encountered.  Turns the module on.  The policy to apply
       depends on what is first found in @opts :

       •   If  it  is  a  string that matches "/^:?fatal$/i", the compilation will croak when the first indirect
           method call is found.

           This option is mutually exclusive with the 'hook' option.

       •   If the key/value pair "hook =&gt; $hook" comes first, $hook will be called for each error with a  string
           representation  of  the  object as $_[0], the method name as $_[1], the current file as $_[2] and the
           line number as $_[3].  If and only if the object is actually a block, $_[0] is assured  to  start  by
           '{'.

           This option is mutually exclusive with the 'fatal' option.

       •   If none of "fatal" and "hook" are specified, a warning will be emitted for each indirect method call.

       •   If  @opts contains a string that matches "/^:?global$/i", the pragma will be globally enabled for <b>all</b>
           code compiled after the current "no indirect" statement, except for code that is in the lexical scope
           of "use indirect".  This option may come indifferently before or after the "fatal" or "hook" options,
           in the case they are also passed to "unimport".

           The global policy applied is the one resulting of the "fatal" or "hook" options, thus defaults  to  a
           warning when none of those are specified :

               no indirect 'global';                # warn for any indirect call
               no indirect qw&lt;global fatal&gt;;        # die on any indirect call
               no indirect 'global', hook =&gt; \&amp;hook # custom global action

           Note  that  if  another policy is installed by a "no indirect" statement further in the code, it will
           overrule the global policy :

               no indirect 'global';  # warn globally
               {
                no indirect 'fatal';  # throw exceptions for this lexical scope
                ...
                require Some::Module; # the global policy will apply for the
                                      # compilation phase of this module
               }

   <b>"import"</b>
           use indirect;

       Magically called at each "use indirect". Turns the module off.

       As explained in "unimport"'s description, an "use indirect" statement will lexically  override  a  global
       policy previously installed by "no indirect 'global', ..." (if there's one).

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>"msg"</b>
           my $msg = msg($object, $method, $file, $line);

       Returns the default error message that "indirect" generates when an indirect method call is reported.

</pre><h4><b>CONSTANTS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>"I_THREADSAFE"</b>
       True iff the module could have been built with thread-safety features enabled.

   <b>"I_FORKSAFE"</b>
       True  iff  this module could have been built with fork-safety features enabled.  This will always be true
       except on Windows where it's false for perl 5.10.0 and below .

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>"Indirect</b> <b>call</b> <b>of</b> <b>method</b> <b>"%s"</b> <b>on</b> <b>object</b> <b>"%s"</b> <b>at</b> <b>%s</b> <b>line</b> <b>%d."</b>
       The default warning/exception message thrown when an indirect method call on an object is found.

   <b>"Indirect</b> <b>call</b> <b>of</b> <b>method</b> <b>"%s"</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>block</b> <b>at</b> <b>%s</b> <b>line</b> <b>%d."</b>
       The default warning/exception message thrown when an indirect method call on a block is found.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
   <b>"PERL_INDIRECT_PM_DISABLE"</b>
       If this environment variable is set to true when the pragma is used for the first time, the XS code won't
       be loaded and, although the 'indirect' lexical hint will be set to true in the scope of use,  the  pragma
       itself  won't  do anything.  In this case, the pragma will always be considered to be thread-safe, and as
       such "I_THREADSAFE" will be true.  This is useful for disabling "indirect" in production environments.

       Note that clearing this variable after "indirect" was loaded has no effect.  If you want to re-enable the
       pragma later, you also need to reload it by deleting the 'indirect.pm' entry from %INC.

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
       The implementation was tweaked to work around several limitations of vanilla "perl" pragmas : it's thread
       safe, and does not suffer from a "perl 5.8.x-5.10.0" bug  that  causes  all  pragmas  to  propagate  into
       "require"d scopes.

       Before  "perl"  5.12,  "meth  $obj" (no semicolon) at the end of a file is not seen as an indirect method
       call, although it is as soon as there is another token before the end (as in "meth $obj;" or  "meth  $obj
       1").  If you use "perl" 5.12 or greater, those constructs are correctly reported.

       With  5.8  perls,  the pragma does not propagate into "eval STRING".  This is due to a shortcoming in the
       way perl handles the hints hash, which is addressed in perl 5.10.

       The search for indirect method calls happens before constant folding.  Hence "my $x =  new  Class  if  0"
       will be caught.

</pre><h4><b>REFERENCES</b></h4><pre>
       Numerous articles have been written about the quirks of the indirect object construct :

       •   &lt;<a href="http://markmail.org/message/o7d5sxnydya7bwvv">http://markmail.org/message/o7d5sxnydya7bwvv</a>&gt;  : <b>Far</b> <b>More</b> <b>Than</b> <b>Everything</b> <b>You've</b> <b>Ever</b> <b>Wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>Know</b>
           <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>Indirect</b> <b>Object</b> <b>syntax</b>, Tom Christiansen, 1998-01-28.

           This historical post to the "perl5-porters" mailing list raised awareness about the  perils  of  this
           syntax.

           Matt S. Trout, 2009-07-29.

           In this blog post, the author gives an example of an undesirable indirect method call on a block that
           causes a particularly bewildering error.

</pre><h4><b>DEPENDENCIES</b></h4><pre>
       perl 5.8.1.

       A C compiler.  This module may happen to build with a C++ compiler as well, but don't rely on it,  as  no
       guarantee is made in this regard.

       Carp (standard since perl 5), XSLoader (since perl 5.6.0).
