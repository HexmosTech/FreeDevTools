</pre><h4><b>Enumeration</b> <b>Type</b> <b>Documentation</b></h4><pre>
   <b>enum</b> <b>rte_lcore_state_t</b>
       State of an lcore.

       <b>Enumerator</b>

       <u>WAIT</u>   waiting for new command

       <u>RUNNING</u>
              executing command

       Definition at line <b>21</b> of file <b>rte_launch.h</b>.

   <b>enum</b> <b>rte_rmt_call_main_t</b>
       This enum indicates whether the main core must execute the handler launched on all logical cores.

       <b>Enumerator</b>

       <u>SKIP_MAIN</u>
              lcore handler not executed by main core.

       <u>CALL_MAIN</u>
              lcore handler executed by main core.

       Definition at line <b>73</b> of file <b>rte_launch.h</b>.

</pre><h4><b>Function</b> <b>Documentation</b></h4><pre>
   <b>int</b> <b>rte_eal_remote_launch</b> <b>(lcore_function_t</b> <b>*</b> <b>f,</b> <b>void</b> <b>*</b> <b>arg,</b> <b>unsigned</b> <b>worker_id)</b>
       Launch a function on another lcore.

       To be executed on the MAIN lcore only.

       Sends  a  message to a worker lcore (identified by the worker_id) that is in the WAIT state (this is true
       after   the   first   call   to   <b>rte_eal_init()</b>).   This   can   be    checked    by    first    calling
       rte_eal_wait_lcore(worker_id).

       When  the  remote lcore receives the message, it switches to the RUNNING state, then calls the function f
       with argument arg. Once the execution is done, the remote lcore switches to WAIT  state  and  the  return
       value of f is stored in a local variable to be read using <b>rte_eal_wait_lcore()</b>.

       The MAIN lcore returns as soon as the message is sent and knows nothing about the completion of f.

       Note:  This function is not designed to offer optimum performance. It is just a practical way to launch a
       function on another lcore at initialization time.

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>f</u> The function to be called.
           <u>arg</u> The argument for the function.
           <u>worker_id</u> The identifier of the lcore on which the function should be executed.

       <b>Returns</b>

           • 0: Success. Execution of function f started on the remote lcore.

           • (-EBUSY): The remote lcore is not in a WAIT state.

           • (-EPIPE): Error reading or writing pipe to worker thread

   <b>int</b> <b>rte_eal_mp_remote_launch</b> <b>(lcore_function_t</b> <b>*</b> <b>f,</b> <b>void</b> <b>*</b> <b>arg,</b> <b>enum</b> <b>rte_rmt_call_main_t</b> <b>call_main)</b>
       Launch a function on all lcores.

       Check that each WORKER lcore is in a WAIT state, then call <b>rte_eal_remote_launch()</b> for each lcore.

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>f</u> The function to be called.
           <u>arg</u> The argument for the function.
           <u>call_main</u> If call_main set to SKIP_MAIN, the MAIN lcore does not call the function. If  call_main  is
           set  to  CALL_MAIN, the function is also called on main before returning. In any case, the main lcore
           returns as soon as it finished its job and knows nothing about the  completion  of  f  on  the  other
           lcores.

       <b>Returns</b>

           • 0: Success. Execution of function f started on all remote lcores.

           • (-EBUSY): At least one remote lcore is not in a WAIT state. In this case, no message is sent to any
             of the lcores.

   <b>enum</b> <b>rte_lcore_state_t</b> <b>rte_eal_get_lcore_state</b> <b>(unsigned</b> <b>int</b> <b>worker_id)</b>
       Get the state of the lcore identified by worker_id.

       To be executed on the MAIN lcore only.

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>worker_id</u> The identifier of the lcore.

       <b>Returns</b>
           The state of the lcore.

   <b>int</b> <b>rte_eal_wait_lcore</b> <b>(unsigned</b> <b>worker_id)</b>
       Wait until an lcore finishes its job.

       To be executed on the MAIN lcore only.

       If  the  lcore identified by the worker_id is in RUNNING state, wait until the lcore finishes its job and
       moves to the WAIT state.

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>worker_id</u> The identifier of the lcore.

       <b>Returns</b>

           • 0: If the remote launch function was never called on the lcore identified by the worker_id.

           • The value that was returned by the previous remote launch function call.

   <b>void</b> <b>rte_eal_mp_wait_lcore</b> <b>(void)</b>
       Wait until all lcores finish their jobs.

       To be executed on the MAIN lcore only. Issue an <b>rte_eal_wait_lcore()</b> for every lcore. The  return  values
       are ignored.

       After  a  call  to  <b>rte_eal_mp_wait_lcore()</b>,  the  caller can assume that all worker lcores are in a WAIT
       state.
