       #include &lt;ares.h&gt;

       typedef void (*ares_host_callback)(void *<u>arg</u>, int <u>status</u>,
                                          int <u>timeouts</u>,
                                          struct hostent *<u>hostent</u>)

       void ares_gethostbyaddr(ares_channel_t *<u>channel</u>, const void *<u>addr</u>,
                               int <u>addrlen</u>, int <u>family</u>,
                               ares_host_callback <u>callback</u>, void *<u>arg</u>)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>ares_gethostbyaddr</b> function initiates a host query by address on the name service channel identified
       by <u>channel</u>.  The parameters <u>addr</u> and <u>addrlen</u> give the address as a series of bytes, and <u>family</u> gives  the
       type  of  address.   When  the  query  is  complete or has failed, the ares library will invoke <u>callback</u>.
       Completion or failure of the query may  happen  immediately,  or  may  happen  during  a  later  call  to
       <u><a href="../man3/ares_process.3.html">ares_process</a>(3)</u>, <u><a href="../man3/ares_destroy.3.html">ares_destroy</a>(3)</u> or <u><a href="../man3/ares_cancel.3.html">ares_cancel</a>(3)</u>.

       The  callback  argument  <u>arg</u>  is  copied from the <b>ares_gethostbyaddr</b> argument <u>arg</u>.  The callback argument
       <u>status</u> indicates whether the query succeeded and, if not,  how  it  failed.   It  may  have  any  of  the
       following values:

       <b>ARES_SUCCESS</b>       The host lookup completed successfully.

       <b>ARES_ENOTIMP</b>       The ares library does not know how to look up addresses of type <u>family</u>.

       <b>ARES_ENOTFOUND</b>     The address <u>addr</u> was not found.

       <b>ARES_ENOMEM</b>        Memory was exhausted.

       <b>ARES_ECANCELLED</b>    The query was cancelled.

       <b>ARES_EDESTRUCTION</b>  The name service channel <u>channel</u> is being destroyed; the query will not be completed.

       The callback argument <u>timeouts</u> reports how many times a query timed out during the execution of the given
       request.

       On  successful  completion  of  the  query,  the  callback  argument  <u>hostent</u>  points to a <b>struct</b> <b>hostent</b>
       containing the name of the host returned by the query.  The callback need not and should not  attempt  to
       free  the  memory pointed to by <u>hostent</u>; the ares library will free it when the callback returns.  If the
       query did not complete successfully, <u>hostent</u> will be <b>NULL</b>.

       When the associated callback is called, it is called with a channel lock so care must be taken to  ensure
       any processing is minimal to prevent DNS channel stalls.

       The callback may be triggered from a different thread than the one which called <u><a href="../man3/ares_gethostbyaddr.3.html">ares_gethostbyaddr</a>(3)</u>.

       For integrators running their own event loops and not using <b>ARES_OPT_EVENT_THREAD</b>, care needs to be taken
       to ensure any file descriptor lists are updated immediately within the eventloop when notified.
