</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       qsort — sort a table of data

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/stdlib.h">stdlib.h</a>&gt;

       void qsort(void *<u>base</u>, size_t <u>nel</u>, size_t <u>width</u>,
           int (*<u>compar</u>)(const void *, const void *));

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  functionality  described  on  this  reference  page is aligned with the ISO C standard. Any conflict
       between the requirements described  here  and  the  ISO C  standard  is  unintentional.  This  volume  of
       POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO C standard.

       The  <u>qsort</u>()  function  shall sort an array of <u>nel</u> objects, the initial element of which is pointed to by
       <u>base</u>.  The size of each object, in bytes, is specified by the <u>width</u> argument. If the <u>nel</u> argument has the
       value zero, the comparison function pointed to by <u>compar</u> shall not be called and no  rearrangement  shall
       take place.

       The  application  shall  ensure  that  the  comparison  function  pointed to by <u>compar</u> does not alter the
       contents of the array. The implementation may  reorder  elements  of  the  array  between  calls  to  the
       comparison function, but shall not alter the contents of any individual element.

       When  the  same objects (consisting of width bytes, irrespective of their current positions in the array)
       are passed more than once to the comparison function, the results shall be consistent with  one  another.
       That is, they shall define a total ordering on the array.

       The  contents  of  the  array  shall be sorted in ascending order according to a comparison function. The
       <u>compar</u> argument is a pointer to the comparison function, which is called with two arguments that point to
       the elements being compared. The application shall ensure that the function returns an integer less than,
       equal to, or greater than 0, if the first argument is considered respectively less  than,  equal  to,  or
       greater than the second. If two members compare as equal, their order in the sorted array is unspecified.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>qsort</u>() function shall not return a value.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       No errors are defined.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       The  comparison  function need not compare every byte, so arbitrary data may be contained in the elements
       in addition to the values being compared.

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       The requirement that each argument (hereafter referred to as <u>p)</u> to the comparison function is  a  pointer
       to  elements of the array implies that for every call, for each argument separately, all of the following
       expressions are non-zero:

           ((char *)p - (char *)base) % width == 0
           (char *)p &gt;= (char *)base
           (char *)p &lt; (char *)base + nel * width

</pre><h4><b>FUTURE</b> <b>DIRECTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       None.
