</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       bsearch — binary search a sorted table

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/stdlib.h">stdlib.h</a>&gt;

       void *bsearch(const void *<u>key</u>, const void *<u>base</u>, size_t <u>nel</u>,
           size_t <u>width</u>, int (*<u>compar</u>)(const void *, const void *));

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  functionality  described  on  this  reference  page is aligned with the ISO C standard. Any conflict
       between the requirements described  here  and  the  ISO C  standard  is  unintentional.  This  volume  of
       POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO C standard.

       The  <u>bsearch</u>()  function shall search an array of <u>nel</u> objects, the initial element of which is pointed to
       by <u>base</u>, for an element that matches the object pointed to by <u>key</u>.  The size of each element in the array
       is specified by <u>width</u>.  If the <u>nel</u> argument has the value zero, the comparison  function  pointed  to  by
       <u>compar</u> shall not be called and no match shall be found.

       The  comparison  function  pointed  to by <u>compar</u> shall be called with two arguments that point to the <u>key</u>
       object and to an array element, in that order.

       The application shall ensure that the comparison function  pointed  to  by  <u>compar</u>  does  not  alter  the
       contents  of  the  array.  The  implementation  may  reorder  elements  of the array between calls to the
       comparison function, but shall not alter the contents of any individual element.

       The implementation shall ensure that the first argument is always a pointer to the key.

       When the same objects (consisting of width bytes, irrespective of their current positions in  the  array)
       are  passed  more than once to the comparison function, the results shall be consistent with one another.
       That is, the same object shall always compare the same way with the key.

       The application shall ensure that the function returns an integer less than, equal to, or greater than  0
       if the <u>key</u> object is considered, respectively, to be less than, to match, or to be greater than the array
       element. The application shall ensure that the array consists of all the elements that compare less than,
       all the elements that compare equal to, and all the elements that compare greater than the <u>key</u> object, in
       that order.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>bsearch</u>() function shall return a pointer to a matching member of the array, or a null pointer if no
       match is found. If two or more members compare equal, which member is returned is unspecified.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       No errors are defined.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       The example below searches a table containing pointers to nodes consisting of a string  and  its  length.
       The table is ordered alphabetically on the string in the node pointed to by each entry.

       The  code  fragment  below  reads  in  strings and either finds the corresponding node and prints out the
       string and its length, or prints an error message.

           #include &lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/stdio.h">stdio.h</a>&gt;
           #include &lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/stdlib.h">stdlib.h</a>&gt;
           #include &lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/string.h">string.h</a>&gt;

           #define TABSIZE    1000

           struct node {                  /* These are stored in the table. */
               char *string;
               int length;
           };
           struct node table[TABSIZE];    /* Table to be searched. */
               .
               .
               .
           {
               struct node *node_ptr, node;
               /* Routine to compare 2 nodes. */
               int node_compare(const void *, const void *);
               .
               .
               .
               while (scanf("%ms", &amp;node.string) != EOF) {
                   node_ptr = (struct node *)bsearch((void *)(&amp;node),
                          (void *)table, TABSIZE,
                          sizeof(struct node), node_compare);
                   if (node_ptr != NULL) {
                       (void)printf("string = %20s, length = %d\n",
                           node_ptr-&gt;string, node_ptr-&gt;length);
                   } else {
                       (void)printf("not found: %s\n", node.string);
                   }
                   free(node.string);
               }
           }
           /*
               This routine compares two nodes based on an
               alphabetical ordering of the string field.
           */
           int
           node_compare(const void *node1, const void *node2)
           {
               return strcoll(((const struct node *)node1)-&gt;string,
                   ((const struct node *)node2)-&gt;string);
           }

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       The pointers to the key and the element at the base of the table should be of type pointer-to-element.

       The comparison function need not compare every byte, so arbitrary data may be contained in  the  elements
       in addition to the values being compared.

       In practice, the array is usually sorted according to the comparison function.

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       The  requirement  that  the  second argument (hereafter referred to as <u>p</u>) to the comparison function is a
       pointer to an element of the array implies that for every call all of the following expressions are  non-
       zero:

           ( (char *)p - (char *)base ) % width == 0
           (char *)p &gt;= (char *)base
           (char *)p &lt; (char *)base + nel * width

</pre><h4><b>FUTURE</b> <b>DIRECTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       None.
