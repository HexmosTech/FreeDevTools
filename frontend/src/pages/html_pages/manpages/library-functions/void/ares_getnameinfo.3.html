       ares_getnameinfo - Address-to-nodename translation in protocol-independent manner

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;ares.h&gt;

       typedef void (*ares_nameinfo_callback)(void *<u>arg</u>, int <u>status</u>,
                                              int <u>timeouts</u>, char *<u>node</u>,
                                              char *<u>service</u>)

       void ares_getnameinfo(ares_channel_t *<u>channel</u>, const struct sockaddr *<u>sa</u>,
                             ares_socklen_t <u>salen</u>, int <u>flags</u>,
                             ares_nameinfo_callback <u>callback</u>, void *<u>arg</u>)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>ares_getnameinfo</b> function is defined for protocol-independent address translation. The function is a
       combination of <u><a href="../man3/ares_gethostbyaddr.3.html">ares_gethostbyaddr</a>(3)</u> and <u><a href="../man3/getservbyport.3.html">getservbyport</a>(3)</u>. The function will translate the address either
       by executing a host query on the name service channel identified by <u>channel</u> or it will attempt to resolve
       it locally if possible.  The parameters <u>sa</u> and <u>len</u> give the address as a sockaddr  structure,  and  <u>flags</u>
       gives the options that the function will use.  Valid flags are listed below:

       <b>ARES_NI_NOFQDN</b>     Only the nodename portion of the FQDN is returned for local hosts.

       <b>ARES_NI_NUMERICHOST</b>
                          The numeric form of the hostname is returned rather than the name.

       <b>ARES_NI_NAMEREQD</b>   An error is returned if the hostname cannot be found in the DNS.

       <b>ARES_NI_NUMERICSERV</b>
                          The numeric form of the service is returned rather than the name.

       <b>ARES_NI_TCP</b>        The service name is to be looked up for the TCP protocol.

       <b>ARES_NI_UDP</b>        The service name is to be looked up for the UDP protocol.

       <b>ARES_NI_SCTP</b>       The service name is to be looked up for the SCTP protocol.

       <b>ARES_NI_DCCP</b>       The service name is to be looked up for the DCCP protocol.

       <b>ARES_NI_NUMERICSCOPE</b>
                          The numeric form of the scope ID is returned rather than the name.

       <b>ARES_NI_LOOKUPHOST</b> A hostname lookup is being requested.

       <b>ARES_NI_LOOKUPSERVICE</b>
                          A service name lookup is being requested.

       When  the  query is complete or has failed, the ares library will invoke <u>callback</u>.  Completion or failure
       of  the  query  may  happen  immediately,  or  may  happen  during  a  later  call  to   <u><a href="../man3/ares_process.3.html">ares_process</a>(3)</u>,
       <u><a href="../man3/ares_destroy.3.html">ares_destroy</a>(3)</u> or <u><a href="../man3/ares_cancel.3.html">ares_cancel</a>(3)</u>.

       When  the associated callback is called, it is called with a channel lock so care must be taken to ensure
       any processing is minimal to prevent DNS channel stalls.

       The callback may be triggered from a different thread than the one which called <u><a href="../man3/ares_getnameinfo.3.html">ares_getnameinfo</a>(3)</u>.

       For integrators running their own event loops and not using <b>ARES_OPT_EVENT_THREAD</b>, care needs to be taken
       to ensure any file descriptor lists are updated immediately within the eventloop when notified.

       The callback argument <u>arg</u> is copied from the <b>ares_getnameinfo</b> argument <u>arg</u>.  The callback argument <u>status</u>
       indicates whether the query succeeded and, if not, how it failed.  It  may  have  any  of  the  following
       values:

       <b>ARES_SUCCESS</b>       The host lookup completed successfully.

       <b>ARES_ENOTIMP</b>       The ares library does not know how to look up addresses of type <u>family</u>.

       <b>ARES_ENOTFOUND</b>     The address <u>addr</u> was not found.

       <b>ARES_ENOMEM</b>        Memory was exhausted.

       <b>ARES_ECANCELLED</b>    The query was cancelled.

       <b>ARES_EDESTRUCTION</b>  The name service channel <u>channel</u> is being destroyed; the query will not be completed.

       <b>ARES_EBADFLAGS</b>     The <u>flags</u> parameter contains an illegal value.

       The callback argument <u>timeouts</u> reports how many times a query timed out during the execution of the given
       request.

       On  successful  completion  of  the  query, the callback argument <u>node</u> contains a string representing the
       hostname  (assuming  <b>ARES_NI_LOOKUPHOST</b>  was  specified).  Additionally,  <u>service</u>   contains   a   string
       representing  the  service  name  (assuming  <b>ARES_NI_LOOKUPSERVICE</b>  was specified).  If the query did not
       complete successfully, or one of the values was not requested, <u>node</u> or <u>service</u> will be <b>NULL</b>.
