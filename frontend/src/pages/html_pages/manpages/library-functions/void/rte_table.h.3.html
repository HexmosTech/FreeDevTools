       RTE Table

       This tool is part of the DPDK Packet Framework tool suite and provides a standard interface to implement
       different types of lookup tables for data plane processing.

       Virtually any search algorithm that can uniquely associate data to a lookup key can be fitted under this
       lookup table abstraction. For the flow table use-case, the lookup key is an n-tuple of packet fields that
       uniquely identifies a traffic flow, while data represents actions and action meta-data associated with
       the same traffic flow.

   <b>typedef</b> <b>void</b> <b>*(*</b> <b>rte_table_op_create)</b> <b>(void</b> <b>*params,</b> <b>int</b> <b>socket_id,</b> <b>uint32_t</b> <b>entry_size)</b>
       Lookup table create

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>params</u> Parameters for lookup table creation. The underlying data structure is different for each
           lookup table type.
           <u>socket_id</u> CPU socket ID (e.g. for memory allocation purpose)
           <u>entry_size</u> Data size of each lookup table entry (measured in bytes)

       <b>Returns</b>
           Handle to lookup table instance

   <b>typedef</b> <b>int(*</b> <b>rte_table_op_free)</b> <b>(void</b> <b>*table)</b>
       Lookup table free

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>table</u> Handle to lookup table instance

       <b>Returns</b>
           0 on success, error code otherwise

       Lookup table entry add

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>table</u> Handle to lookup table instance
           <u>key</u> Lookup key
           <u>entry</u> Data to be associated with the current key. This parameter has to point to a valid memory
           buffer where the first entry_size bytes (table create parameter) are populated with the data.
           <u>key_found</u> After successful invocation, *key_found is set to a value different than 0 if the current
           key is already present in the table and to 0 if not. This pointer has to be set to a valid memory
           location before the table entry add function is called.
           <u>entry_ptr</u> After successful invocation, *entry_ptr stores the handle to the table entry containing the
           data associated with the current key. This handle can be used to perform further read-write accesses
           to this entry. This handle is valid until the key is deleted from the table or the same key is re-
           added to the table, typically to associate it with different data. This pointer has to be set to a
           valid memory location before the function is called.

       <b>Returns</b>
           0 on success, error code otherwise

       Lookup table entry delete

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>table</u> Handle to lookup table instance
           <u>key</u> Lookup key
           <u>key_found</u> After successful invocation, *key_found is set to a value different than 0 if the current
           key was present in the table before the delete operation was performed and to 0 if not. This pointer
           has to be set to a valid memory location before the table entry delete function is called.
           <u>entry</u> After successful invocation, if the key is found in the table (*key found is different than 0
           after function call is completed) and entry points to a valid buffer (entry is set to a value
           different than NULL before the function is called), then the first entry_size bytes (table create
           parameter) in *entry store a copy of table entry that contained the data associated with the current
           key before the key was deleted.

       <b>Returns</b>
           0 on success, error code otherwise

       Lookup table entry add bulk

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>table</u> Handle to lookup table instance
           <u>keys</u> Array containing lookup keys
           <u>entries</u> Array containing data to be associated with each key. Every item in the array has to point to
           a valid memory buffer where the first entry_size bytes (table create parameter) are populated with
           the data.
           <u>n_keys</u> Number of keys to add
           <u>key_found</u> After successful invocation, key_found for every item in the array is set to a value
           different than 0 if the current key is already present in the table and to 0 if not. This pointer has
           to be set to a valid memory location before the table entry add function is called.
           <u>entries_ptr</u> After successful invocation, array *entries_ptr stores the handle to the table entry
           containing the data associated with every key. This handle can be used to perform further read-write
           accesses to this entry. This handle is valid until the key is deleted from the table or the same key
           is re-added to the table, typically to associate it with different data. This pointer has to be set
           to a valid memory location before the function is called.

       <b>void</b> <b>**entries)</b>
       Lookup table entry delete bulk

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>table</u> Handle to lookup table instance
           <u>keys</u> Array containing lookup keys
           <u>n_keys</u> Number of keys to delete
           <u>key_found</u> After successful invocation, key_found for every item in the array is set to a value
           different than 0if the current key was present in the table before the delete operation was performed
           and to 0 if not. This pointer has to be set to a valid memory location before the table entry delete
           function is called.
           <u>entries</u> If entries pointer is NULL, this pointer is ignored for every entry found. Else, after
           successful invocation, if specific key is found in the table (key_found is different than 0 for this
           item after function call is completed) and item of entry array points to a valid buffer (entry is set
           to a value different than NULL before the function is called), then the first entry_size bytes (table
           create parameter) in *entry store a copy of table entry that contained the data associated with the

   <b>typedef</b> <b>int(*</b> <b>rte_table_op_lookup)</b> <b>(void</b> <b>*table,</b> <b>struct</b> <b>rte_mbuf</b> <b>**pkts,</b> <b>uint64_t</b> <b>pkts_mask,</b> <b>uint64_t</b>
       <b>*lookup_hit_mask,</b> <b>void</b> <b>**entries)</b>
       Lookup table lookup

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>table</u> Handle to lookup table instance
           <u>pkts</u> Burst of input packets specified as array of up to 64 pointers to struct <b>rte_mbuf</b>
           <u>pkts_mask</u> 64-bit bitmask specifying which packets in the input burst are valid. When pkts_mask bit n
           is set, then element n of pkts array is pointing to a valid packet. Otherwise, element n of pkts
           array does not point to a valid packet, therefore it will not be accessed.
           <u>lookup_hit_mask</u> Once the table lookup operation is completed, this 64-bit bitmask specifies which of
           the valid packets in the input burst resulted in lookup hit. For each valid input packet (pkts_mask
           bit n is set), the following are true on lookup hit: lookup_hit_mask bit n is set, element n of
           entries array is valid and it points to the lookup table entry that was hit. For each valid input
           packet (pkts_mask bit n is set), the following are true on lookup miss: lookup_hit_mask bit n is not
           set and element n of entries array is not valid.
           <u>entries</u> Once the table lookup operation is completed, this array provides the lookup table entries
           that were hit, as described above. It is required that this array is always pre-allocated by the
           caller of this function with exactly 64 elements. The implementation is allowed to speculatively
           modify the elements of this array, so elements marked as invalid in lookup_hit_mask once the table
           lookup operation is completed might have been modified by this function.

           0 on success, error code otherwise

       Lookup table stats read

       <b>Parameters</b>
