       Dynamic linking library (<u>libdl</u>, <u>-ldl</u>)

       <b>void</b> <b>*dlopen(const</b> <b>char</b> <b>*</b><u>filename</u><b>,</b> <b>int</b> <u>flags</u><b>);</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
   <b>dlopen()</b>
       The  function <b>dlopen</b>() loads the dynamic shared object (shared library) file named by the null-terminated
       string <u>filename</u> and returns an opaque "handle" for the loaded object.  This handle is employed with other
       functions in the dlopen API, such as <b><a href="../man3/dlsym.3.html">dlsym</a></b>(3), <b><a href="../man3/dladdr.3.html">dladdr</a></b>(3), <b><a href="../man3/dlinfo.3.html">dlinfo</a></b>(3), and <b>dlclose</b>().

       If <u>filename</u> is NULL, then the returned handle is for the main program.   If  <u>filename</u>  contains  a  slash
       ("/"),  then  it  is  interpreted  as  a  (relative or absolute) pathname.  Otherwise, the dynamic linker
       searches for the object as follows (see <b><a href="../man8/ld.so.8.html">ld.so</a></b>(8) for further details):

       •  (ELF only) If the calling object (i.e., the shared  library  or  executable  from  which  <b>dlopen</b>()  is
          called) contains a DT_RPATH tag, and does not contain a DT_RUNPATH tag, then the directories listed in
          the DT_RPATH tag are searched.

       •  If,  at the time that the program was started, the environment variable <b>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</b> was defined to
          contain a colon-separated list of directories, then these are searched.  (As a security measure,  this
          variable is ignored for set-user-ID and set-group-ID programs.)

       •  (ELF  only)  If  the calling object contains a DT_RUNPATH tag, then the directories listed in that tag
          are searched.

       •  The cache file <u><a href="file:/etc/ld.so.cache">/etc/ld.so.cache</a></u> (maintained by <b><a href="../man8/ldconfig.8.html">ldconfig</a></b>(8)) is checked to see whether it  contains  an
          entry for <u>filename</u>.

       •  The directories <u><a href="file:/lib">/lib</a></u> and <u><a href="file:/usr/lib">/usr/lib</a></u> are searched (in that order).

       If  the  object  specified  by  <u>filename</u>  has  dependencies  on other shared objects, then these are also
       automatically loaded by the dynamic linker using the same rules.  (This process may occur recursively, if
       those objects in turn have dependencies, and so on.)

       One of the following two values must be included in <u>flags</u>:

       <b>RTLD_LAZY</b>
              Perform lazy binding.  Resolve symbols only as the code that references them is executed.  If  the
              symbol  is  never  referenced,  then  it  is  never resolved.  (Lazy binding is performed only for
              function references; references to variables are always immediately bound when the  shared  object
              is  loaded.)   Since  glibc  2.1.1,  this  flag  is  overridden  by  the effect of the <b>LD_BIND_NOW</b>
              environment variable.

       <b>RTLD_NOW</b>
              If this value is specified, or the environment variable <b>LD_BIND_NOW</b> is set to a  nonempty  string,
              all  undefined  symbols in the shared object are resolved before <b>dlopen</b>() returns.  If this cannot
              be done, an error is returned.

       Zero or more of the following values may also be ORed in <u>flags</u>:

       <b>RTLD_GLOBAL</b>
              The symbols defined by this shared  object  will  be  made  available  for  symbol  resolution  of
              subsequently loaded shared objects.

       <b>RTLD_LOCAL</b>
              This  is  the  converse  of  <b>RTLD_GLOBAL</b>,  and  the default if neither flag is specified.  Symbols
              defined in this shared object are not made available to resolve references in subsequently  loaded
              shared objects.

       <b>RTLD_NODELETE</b> (since glibc 2.2)
              Do  not  unload  the shared object during <b>dlclose</b>().  Consequently, the object's static and global
              variables are not reinitialized if the object is reloaded with <b>dlopen</b>() at a later time.

       <b>RTLD_NOLOAD</b> (since glibc 2.2)
              Don't load the shared object.  This can be  used  to  test  if  the  object  is  already  resident
              (<b>dlopen</b>()  returns  NULL  if  it is not, or the object's handle if it is resident).  This flag can
              also be used to promote the flags on a shared object that  is  already  loaded.   For  example,  a
              shared   object   that   was   previously   loaded   with   <b>RTLD_LOCAL</b>   can   be   reopened  with
              <b>RTLD_NOLOAD</b> <b>|</b> <b>RTLD_GLOBAL</b>.

       <b>RTLD_DEEPBIND</b> (since glibc 2.3.4)
              Place the lookup scope of the symbols in this shared object ahead of the global scope.  This means
              that a self-contained object will use its own symbols in preference to  global  symbols  with  the
              same name contained in objects that have already been loaded.

       If  <u>filename</u>  is  NULL,  then  the returned handle is for the main program.  When given to <b><a href="../man3/dlsym.3.html">dlsym</a></b>(3), this
       handle causes a search for a symbol in the main program, followed by all shared objects loaded at program
       startup, and then all shared objects loaded by <b>dlopen</b>() with the flag <b>RTLD_GLOBAL</b>.

       Symbol references in the shared object are resolved using (in order): symbols in the link map of  objects
       loaded for the main program and its dependencies; symbols in shared objects (and their dependencies) that
       were  previously  opened  with  <b>dlopen</b>() using the <b>RTLD_GLOBAL</b> flag; and definitions in the shared object
       itself (and any dependencies that were loaded for that object).

       Any global symbols in the executable that were placed into its dynamic symbol table by <b><a href="../man1/ld.1.html">ld</a></b>(1) can also  be
       used  to  resolve references in a dynamically loaded shared object.  Symbols may be placed in the dynamic
       symbol table either because the executable was  linked  with  the  flag  "-rdynamic"  (or,  synonymously,
       "--export-dynamic"),  which  causes  all  of  the executable's global symbols to be placed in the dynamic
       symbol table, or because <b><a href="../man1/ld.1.html">ld</a></b>(1) noted a dependency on a symbol in another object during static linking.

       If the same shared object is opened again with <b>dlopen</b>(), the same object handle is returned.  The dynamic
       linker maintains reference counts for object handles, so  a  dynamically  loaded  shared  object  is  not
       deallocated  until  <b>dlclose</b>()  has  been  called  on  it  as  many times as <b>dlopen</b>() has succeeded on it.
       Constructors (see below) are called only when the object is actually loaded into memory (i.e.,  when  the
       reference count increases to 1).

       A  subsequent  <b>dlopen</b>()  call that loads the same shared object with <b>RTLD_NOW</b> may force symbol resolution
       for a shared object earlier loaded with <b>RTLD_LAZY</b>.  Similarly, an object that was previously opened  with
       <b>RTLD_LOCAL</b> can be promoted to <b>RTLD_GLOBAL</b> in a subsequent <b>dlopen</b>().

       If <b>dlopen</b>() fails for any reason, it returns NULL.

   <b>dlmopen()</b>
       This  function performs the same task as <b>dlopen</b>()—the <u>filename</u> and <u>flags</u> arguments, as well as the return
       value, are the same, except for the differences noted below.

       The <b>dlmopen</b>() function differs from <b>dlopen</b>() primarily in that it accepts an additional  argument,  <u>lmid</u>,
       that  specifies  the link-map list (also referred to as a <u>namespace</u>) in which the shared object should be
       loaded.  (By comparison, <b>dlopen</b>() adds the dynamically loaded shared object to the same namespace as  the
       shared  object from which the <b>dlopen</b>() call is made.)  The <u>Lmid_t</u> type is an opaque handle that refers to
       a namespace.

       The <u>lmid</u> argument is either the ID of an existing namespace (which can be obtained  using  the  <b><a href="../man3/dlinfo.3.html">dlinfo</a></b>(3)
       <b>RTLD_DI_LMID</b> request) or one of the following special values:

       <b>LM_ID_BASE</b>
              Load the shared object in the initial namespace (i.e., the application's namespace).

       <b>LM_ID_NEWLM</b>
              Create  a  new  namespace and load the shared object in that namespace.  The object must have been
              correctly linked to reference all of the other shared objects that  it  requires,  since  the  new
              namespace is initially empty.

       If <u>filename</u> is NULL, then the only permitted value for <u>lmid</u> is <b>LM_ID_BASE</b>.

   <b>dlclose()</b>
       The function <b>dlclose</b>() decrements the reference count on the dynamically loaded shared object referred to
       by <u>handle</u>.

       If  the  object's  reference  count  drops  to  zero  and no symbols in this object are required by other
       objects, then the object is unloaded  after  first  calling  any  destructors  defined  for  the  object.
       (Symbols  in  this  object  might  be  required in another object because this object was opened with the
       <b>RTLD_GLOBAL</b> flag and one of its symbols satisfied a relocation in another object.)

       All shared objects that were automatically loaded when <b>dlopen</b>() was invoked on the object referred to  by
       <u>handle</u> are recursively closed in the same manner.

       A successful return from <b>dlclose</b>() does not guarantee that the symbols associated with <u>handle</u> are removed
       from  the  caller's  address  space.  In addition to references resulting from explicit <b>dlopen</b>() calls, a
       shared object may have been implicitly loaded (and reference counted) because of  dependencies  in  other
       shared  objects.   Only  when all references have been released can the shared object be removed from the
       address space.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       On success, <b>dlopen</b>() and <b>dlmopen</b>() return a non-NULL handle for the loaded object.  On error (file  could
       not  be  found, was not readable, had the wrong format, or caused errors during loading), these functions
       return NULL.

       On success, <b>dlclose</b>() returns 0; on error, it returns a nonzero value.

       Errors from these functions can be diagnosed using <b><a href="../man3/dlerror.3.html">dlerror</a></b>(3).

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>dlmopen()</b> <b>and</b> <b>namespaces</b>
       A link-map list defines an isolated namespace for the  resolution  of  symbols  by  the  dynamic  linker.
       Within  a  namespace,  dependent  shared  objects are implicitly loaded according to the usual rules, and
       symbol references are likewise resolved according to the usual rules, but such resolution is confined  to
       the  definitions  provided  by  the  objects  that  have been (explicitly and implicitly) loaded into the
       namespace.

       The <b>dlmopen</b>() function permits object-load isolation—the ability  to  load  a  shared  object  in  a  new
       namespace  without  exposing the rest of the application to the symbols made available by the new object.
       Note that the use of the <b>RTLD_LOCAL</b> flag is not sufficient for this purpose, since it prevents  a  shared
       object's symbols from being available to <u>any</u> other shared object.  In some cases, we may want to make the
       symbols  provided  by  a dynamically loaded shared object available to (a subset of) other shared objects
       without exposing those symbols to the entire application.  This can  be  achieved  by  using  a  separate
       namespace and the <b>RTLD_GLOBAL</b> flag.

       The  <b>dlmopen</b>()  function  also  can  be  used  to  provide better isolation than the <b>RTLD_LOCAL</b> flag.  In
       particular, shared objects loaded with <b>RTLD_LOCAL</b> may be promoted to <b>RTLD_GLOBAL</b> if they are dependencies
       of another shared object loaded with <b>RTLD_GLOBAL</b>.  Thus, <b>RTLD_LOCAL</b> is insufficient to isolate  a  loaded
       shared  object  except  in  the  (uncommon)  case  where  one has explicit control over all shared object
       dependencies.

       Possible uses of <b>dlmopen</b>() are plugins where the author of the plugin-loading framework can't  trust  the
       plugin authors and does not wish any undefined symbols from the plugin framework to be resolved to plugin
       symbols.   Another  use  is  to  load the same object more than once.  Without the use of <b>dlmopen</b>(), this
       would require the creation of distinct copies of the shared object file.  Using <b>dlmopen</b>(),  this  can  be
       achieved by loading the same shared object file into different namespaces.

       The glibc implementation supports a maximum of 16 namespaces.

   <b>Initialization</b> <b>and</b> <b>finalization</b> <b>functions</b>
       Shared     objects     may     export    functions    using    the    <b>__attribute__((constructor))</b>    and
       <b>__attribute__((destructor))</b> function attributes.  Constructor  functions  are  executed  before  <b>dlopen</b>()
       returns,  and  destructor  functions  are  executed before <b>dlclose</b>() returns.  A shared object may export
       multiple constructors and destructors, and priorities can be associated with each function  to  determine
       the  order  in which they are executed.  See the <b>gcc</b> info pages (under "Function attributes") for further
       information.

       An older method of (partially) achieving the same result is via the use of two special symbols recognized
       by the linker: <b>_init</b> and <b>_fini</b>.  If a dynamically loaded shared object exports a routine  named  <b>_init</b>(),
       then  that code is executed after loading a shared object, before <b>dlopen</b>() returns.  If the shared object
       exports a routine named <b>_fini</b>(), then that routine is called just before the object is unloaded.  In this
       case, one must avoid linking against the system startup files, which contain default  versions  of  these
       files; this can be done by using the <b><a href="../man1/gcc.1.html">gcc</a></b>(1) <u>-nostartfiles</u> command-line option.

       Use  of  <b>_init</b>  and  <b>_fini</b> is now deprecated in favor of the aforementioned constructors and destructors,
       which among other advantages, permit multiple initialization and finalization functions to be defined.

       Since glibc 2.2.3, <b><a href="../man3/atexit.3.html">atexit</a></b>(3) can be used to register an exit handler that is automatically called when  a
       shared object is unloaded.

   <b>History</b>
       These functions are part of the dlopen API, derived from SunOS.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       As  at  glibc  2.24,  specifying  the  <b>RTLD_GLOBAL</b>  flag  when  calling  <b>dlmopen</b>()  generates  an  error.
       Furthermore, specifying <b>RTLD_GLOBAL</b> when calling <b>dlopen</b>() results in a program  crash  (<b>SIGSEGV</b>)  if  the
       call is made from any object loaded in a namespace other than the initial namespace.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       The program below loads the (glibc) math library, looks up the address of the <b><a href="../man3/cos.3.html">cos</a></b>(3) function, and prints
       the cosine of 2.0.  The following is an example of building and running the program:

           $ <b>cc</b> <b>dlopen_demo.c</b> <b>-ldl</b>
           $ <b>./a.out</b>
           -0.416147

       #include &lt;gnu/lib-names.h&gt;  /* Defines LIBM_SO (which will be a

       int
       main(void)
       {
           void *handle;
           double (*cosine)(double);
           char *error;

           handle = dlopen(LIBM_SO, RTLD_LAZY);
           if (!handle) {
               fprintf(stderr, "%s\n", dlerror());
               exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
           }

           dlerror();    /* Clear any existing error */

           cosine = (double (*)(double)) dlsym(handle, "cos");

           /* According to the ISO C standard, casting between function
              pointers and 'void *', as done above, produces undefined results.
              POSIX.1-2001 and POSIX.1-2008 accepted this state of affairs and
              proposed the following workaround:

                  *(void **) (&amp;cosine) = dlsym(handle, "cos");

              This (clumsy) cast conforms with the ISO C standard and will
              avoid any compiler warnings.

              The 2013 Technical Corrigendum 1 to POSIX.1-2008 improved matters
              by requiring that conforming implementations support casting
              'void *' to a function pointer.  Nevertheless, some compilers
              (e.g., gcc with the '-pedantic' option) may complain about the
              cast used in this program. */

           error = dlerror();
           if (error != NULL) {
               fprintf(stderr, "%s\n", error);
               exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
           }

           printf("%f\n", (*cosine)(2.0));
           dlclose(handle);
           exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
       }
