       PCRE2 - Perl-compatible regular expressions (revised API)

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;pcre2.h&gt;</b>

       <b>int</b> <b>(*pcre2_callout)(pcre2_callout_block</b> <b>*,</b> <b>void</b> <b>*);</b>

       <b>int</b> <b>pcre2_callout_enumerate(const</b> <b>pcre2_code</b> <b>*</b><u>code</u><b>,</b>
         <b>int</b> <b>(*</b><u>callback</u><b>)(pcre2_callout_enumerate_block</b> <b>*,</b> <b>void</b> <b>*),</b>
         <b>void</b> <b>*</b><u>user_data</u><b>);</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>

       PCRE2  provides a feature called "callout", which is a means of temporarily passing control to the caller
       of PCRE2 in the middle of pattern matching. The caller of PCRE2 provides an external function by  putting
       its entry point in a match context (see <b>pcre2_set_callout()</b> in the <b>pcre2api</b> documentation).

       When  using  the  <b>pcre2_substitute()</b>  function,  an  additional callout feature is available. This does a
       callout after each change to the subject string and is described in the <b>pcre2api</b> documentation; the  rest
       of this document is concerned with callouts during pattern matching.

       Within  a regular expression, (?C&lt;arg&gt;) indicates a point at which the external function is to be called.
       Different callout points can be identified by putting a number less than 256  after  the  letter  C.  The
       default  value  is  zero.   Alternatively, the argument may be a delimited string. The starting delimiter
       must be one of ` ' " ^ % # $ { and the ending delimiter is the same as the start, except for {, where the
       ending delimiter is }. If the ending delimiter is needed within the  string,  it  must  be  doubled.  For
       example, this pattern has two callout points:

         (?C1)abc(?C"some ""arbitrary"" text")def

       If  the  PCRE2_AUTO_CALLOUT  option  bit  is  set when a pattern is compiled, PCRE2 automatically inserts
       callouts, all with number 255, before each item in the pattern except for immediately before or after  an
       explicit callout. For example, if PCRE2_AUTO_CALLOUT is used with the pattern

         A(?C3)B

       it is processed as if it were

         (?C255)A(?C3)B(?C255)

       Here is a more complicated example:

         A(\d{2}|--)

       With PCRE2_AUTO_CALLOUT, this pattern is processed as if it were

         (?C255)A(?C255)((?C255)\d{2}(?C255)|(?C255)-(?C255)-(?C255))(?C255)

       Notice  that  there  is  a  callout before and after each parenthesis and alternation bar. If the pattern
       contains a conditional  group  whose  condition  is  an  assertion,  an  automatic  callout  is  inserted
       immediately before the condition. Such a callout may also be inserted explicitly, for example:

         (?(?C9)(?=a)ab|de)  (?(?C%text%)(?!=d)ab|de)

       This applies only to assertion conditions (because they are themselves independent groups).

       Callouts can be useful for tracking the progress of pattern matching. The <b>pcre2test</b> program has a pattern
       qualifier  (/auto_callout)  that sets automatic callouts.  When any callouts are present, the output from
       <b>pcre2test</b> indicates how the pattern is being matched. This is useful information when you are  trying  to
       optimize the performance of a particular pattern.

</pre><h4><b>MISSING</b> <b>CALLOUTS</b></h4><pre>

       You  should  be  aware  that,  because  of  optimizations in the way PCRE2 compiles and matches patterns,
       callouts sometimes do not happen exactly as you might expect.

   <b>Auto-possessification</b>

       At compile time, PCRE2 "auto-possessifies" repeated items when it knows that what follows cannot be  part
       of  the  repeat.  For  example,  a+[bc] is compiled as if it were a++[bc]. The <b>pcre2test</b> output when this
       pattern is compiled with PCRE2_ANCHORED and PCRE2_AUTO_CALLOUT and then applied to the string "aaaa" is:

         ---&gt;aaaa
          +0 ^        a+
          +2 ^   ^    [bc]
         No match

       This indicates that when matching [bc] fails, there is no backtracking  into  a+  (because  it  is  being
       treated  as  a++) and therefore the callouts that would be taken for the backtracks do not occur. You can
       disable the auto-possessify feature by passing PCRE2_NO_AUTO_POSSESS to <b>pcre2_compile()</b>, or starting  the
       pattern with (*NO_AUTO_POSSESS). In this case, the output changes to this:

         ---&gt;aaaa
          +0 ^        a+
          +2 ^   ^    [bc]
          +2 ^  ^     [bc]
          +2 ^ ^      [bc]
          +2 ^^       [bc]
         No match

       This time, when matching [bc] fails, the matcher backtracks into a+ and tries again, repeatedly, until a+
       itself fails.

   <b>Automatic</b> <b>.*</b> <b>anchoring</b>

       By  default,  an  optimization  is  applied  when  .*  is  the  first  significant  item in a pattern. If
       PCRE2_DOTALL is set, so that the dot can match any character, the pattern is automatically  anchored.  If
       PCRE2_DOTALL  is  not  set,  a  match can start only after an internal newline or at the beginning of the
       subject, and <b>pcre2_compile()</b> remembers this. If a pattern has more than one top-level  branch,  automatic
       anchoring occurs if all branches are anchorable.

       This optimization is disabled, however, if .* is in an atomic group or if there is a backreference to the
       capture  group  in  which  it  appears.  It is also disabled if the pattern contains (*PRUNE) or (*SKIP).
       However, the presence of callouts does not affect it.

       For example, if the pattern .*\d is compiled with PCRE2_AUTO_CALLOUT and applied to the string "aa",  the
       <b>pcre2test</b> output is:

         ---&gt;aa
          +0 ^      .*
          +2 ^ ^    \d
          +2 ^^     \d
          +2 ^      \d
         No match

       This  shows that all match attempts start at the beginning of the subject. In other words, the pattern is
       anchored. You can disable this optimization by passing  PCRE2_NO_DOTSTAR_ANCHOR  to  <b>pcre2_compile()</b>,  or
       starting the pattern with (*NO_DOTSTAR_ANCHOR). In this case, the output changes to:

         ---&gt;aa
          +0 ^      .*
          +2 ^ ^    \d
          +2 ^^     \d
          +2 ^      \d
          +0  ^     .*
          +2  ^^    \d
          +2  ^     \d
         No match

       This  shows  more  match  attempts,  starting  at  the  second  subject character.  Another optimization,
       described in the next section, means that there is no subsequent attempt to match with an empty subject.

   <b>Other</b> <b>optimizations</b>

       Other optimizations that provide fast "no match" results also  affect  callouts.   For  example,  if  the
       pattern is

         ab(?C4)cd

       PCRE2  knows  that  any matching string must contain the letter "d". If the subject string is "abyz", the
       lack of "d" means that matching doesn't ever start, and the  callout  is  never  reached.  However,  with
       "abyd", though the result is still no match, the callout is obeyed.

       For  most  patterns PCRE2 also knows the minimum length of a matching string, and will immediately give a
       "no match" return without actually running a match if the subject is not long enough, or, for  unanchored
       patterns, if it has been scanned far enough.

       You  can disable these optimizations by passing the PCRE2_NO_START_OPTIMIZE option to <b>pcre2_compile()</b>, or
       by starting the pattern with (*NO_START_OPT). This slows down the matching process, but does ensure  that
       callouts such as the example above are obeyed.

</pre><h4><b>THE</b> <b>CALLOUT</b> <b>INTERFACE</b></h4><pre>

       During  matching,  when  PCRE2  reaches a callout point, if an external function is provided in the match
       context, it is called. This applies to both normal, DFA, and JIT matching.  The  first  argument  to  the
       callout  function  is  a pointer to a <b>pcre2_callout</b> block. The second argument is the void * callout data
       that was supplied when  the  callout  was  set  up  by  calling  <b>pcre2_set_callout()</b>  (see  the  <b>pcre2api</b>
       documentation). The callout block structure contains the following fields, not necessarily in this order:

         uint32_t      <u>version</u>;
         uint32_t      <u>callout_number</u>;
         uint32_t      <u>capture_top</u>;
         uint32_t      <u>capture_last</u>;
         uint32_t      <u>callout_flags</u>;
         PCRE2_SIZE   *<u>offset_vector</u>;
         PCRE2_SPTR    <u>mark</u>;
         PCRE2_SPTR    <u>subject</u>;
         PCRE2_SIZE    <u>subject_length</u>;
         PCRE2_SIZE    <u>start_match</u>;
         PCRE2_SIZE    <u>current_position</u>;
         PCRE2_SIZE    <u>pattern_position</u>;
         PCRE2_SIZE    <u>next_item_length</u>;
         PCRE2_SIZE    <u>callout_string_offset</u>;
         PCRE2_SIZE    <u>callout_string_length</u>;
         PCRE2_SPTR    <u>callout_string</u>;

       The  <u>version</u>  field  contains the version number of the block format. The current version is 2; the three
       callout string fields were added for version 1, and the <u>callout_flags</u> field for version  2.  If  you  are
       writing  an  application  that might use an earlier release of PCRE2, you should check the version number
       before accessing any of these fields. The version number will increase  in  future  if  more  fields  are
       added, but the intention is never to remove any of the existing fields.

   <b>Fields</b> <b>for</b> <b>numerical</b> <b>callouts</b>

       For  a  numerical callout, <u>callout_string</u> is NULL, and <u>callout_number</u> contains the number of the callout,
       in the range 0-255. This is the number that follows (?C for callouts that part of the pattern; it is  255
       for automatically generated callouts.

   <b>Fields</b> <b>for</b> <b>string</b> <b>callouts</b>

       For  callouts  with  string  arguments,  <u>callout_number</u>  is always zero, and <u>callout_string</u> points to the
       string that is contained within the compiled pattern.  Its  length  is  given  by  <u>callout_string_length</u>.
       Duplicated  ending  delimiters  that  were  present  in the original pattern string have been turned into
       single characters, but there is no other processing of the callout string argument.  An  additional  code
       unit containing binary zero is present after the string, but is not included in the length. The delimiter
       that  was  used  to  start  the  string  is also stored within the pattern, immediately before the string
       itself. You can access this delimiter as <u>callout_string</u>[-1] if you need it.

       The <u>callout_string_offset</u> field is the code unit offset to the  start  of  the  callout  argument  string
       within  the  original  pattern  string.  This  is provided for the benefit of applications such as script
       languages that might need to report errors in the callout string within the pattern.

   <b>Fields</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>callouts</b>

       The remaining fields in the callout block are the same for both kinds of callout.

       The <u>offset_vector</u> field is a pointer to a vector of capturing offsets (the "ovector"). You may  read  the
       elements in this vector, but you must not change any of them.

       For  calls to <b>pcre2_match()</b>, the <u>offset_vector</u> field is not (since release 10.30) a pointer to the actual
       ovector that was passed to the matching function in the  match  data  block.  Instead  it  points  to  an
       internal  ovector  of  a  size large enough to hold all possible captured substrings in the pattern. Note
       that whenever a recursion or subroutine call within a pattern completes, the capturing state is reset  to
       what it was before.

       The  <u>capture_last</u>  field contains the number of the most recently captured substring, and the <u>capture_top</u>
       field contains one more than the number of  the  highest  numbered  captured  substring  so  far.  If  no
       substrings  have yet been captured, the value of <u>capture_last</u> is 0 and the value of <u>capture_top</u> is 1. The
       values of these fields do not always differ by  one;  for  example,  when  the  callout  in  the  pattern
       ((a)(b))(?C2) is taken, <u>capture_last</u> is 1 but <u>capture_top</u> is 4.

       The  contents of ovector[2] to ovector[&lt;capture_top&gt;*2-1] can be inspected in order to extract substrings
       that have been matched so far, in the same way as extracting substrings after a match has completed.  The
       values  in  ovector[0]  and  ovector[1]  are  always  PCRE2_UNSET  because the match is by definition not
       complete. Substrings that have not been captured but whose numbers are less than  <u>capture_top</u>  also  have
       both of their ovector slots set to PCRE2_UNSET.

       For  DFA matching, the <u>offset_vector</u> field points to the ovector that was passed to the matching function
       in the match data block for callouts at the top level, but to an internal ovector during  the  processing
       of pattern recursions, lookarounds, and atomic groups. However, these ovectors hold no useful information
       because  <b>pcre2_dfa_match()</b> does not support substring capturing. The value of <u>capture_top</u> is always 1 and
       the value of <u>capture_last</u> is always 0 for DFA matching.

       The <u>subject</u> and <u>subject_length</u> fields contain copies of the values  that  were  passed  to  the  matching
       function.

       The  <u>start_match</u> field normally contains the offset within the subject at which the current match attempt
       started. However, if the escape sequence \K has been encountered, this value is changed  to  reflect  the
       modified starting point. If the pattern is not anchored, the callout function may be called several times
       from the same point in the pattern for different starting points in the subject.

       The <u>current_position</u> field contains the offset within the subject of the current match pointer.

       The <u>pattern_position</u> field contains the offset in the pattern string to the next item to be matched.

       The  <u>next_item_length</u>  field  contains the length of the next item to be processed in the pattern string.
       When the callout is at the end of the pattern, the length is zero. When the callout precedes  an  opening
       parenthesis,  the  length includes meta characters that follow the parenthesis. For example, in a callout
       before an assertion such as (?=ab) the length is 3. For an alternation bar or a closing parenthesis,  the
       length  is  one,  unless  a  closing parenthesis is followed by a quantifier, in which case its length is
       included. (This changed in release 10.23. In earlier releases, before an opening parenthesis  the  length
       was  that  of  the  entire  group,  and before an alternation bar or a closing parenthesis the length was
       zero.)

       The <u>pattern_position</u> and <u>next_item_length</u> fields are intended to help in distinguishing between different
       automatic callouts, which all have the same callout number. However, they are set for all  callouts,  and
       are used by <b>pcre2test</b> to show the next item to be matched when displaying callout information.

       In  callouts from <b>pcre2_match()</b> the <u>mark</u> field contains a pointer to the zero-terminated name of the most
       recently passed (*MARK), (*PRUNE), or (*THEN) item in the match, or NULL  if  no  such  items  have  been
       passed. Instances of (*PRUNE) or (*THEN) without a name do not obliterate a previous (*MARK). In callouts
       from the DFA matching function this field always contains NULL.

       The <u>callout_flags</u> field is always zero in callouts from <b>pcre2_dfa_match()</b> or when JIT is being used. When
       <b>pcre2_match()</b> without JIT is used, the following bits may be set:

         PCRE2_CALLOUT_STARTMATCH

       This  is  set  for  the  first  callout after the start of matching for each new starting position in the
       subject.

         PCRE2_CALLOUT_BACKTRACK

       This is set if there has been a matching backtrack since the previous callout,  or  since  the  start  of
       matching if this is the first callout from a <b>pcre2_match()</b> run.

       Both  bits  are  set when a backtrack has caused a "bumpalong" to a new starting position in the subject.
       Output from <b>pcre2test</b> does not indicate the presence of these bits unless the <b>callout_extra</b>  modifier  is
       set.

       The  information  in  the  <b>callout_flags</b>  field is provided so that applications can track and tell their
       users how matching with backtracking is done. This can be useful when trying  to  optimize  patterns,  or
       just  to  understand  how  PCRE2  works.  There  is  no  support in <b>pcre2_dfa_match()</b> because there is no
       backtracking in DFA matching, and there is no support in  JIT  because  JIT  is  all  about  maximimizing
       matching performance. In both these cases the <b>callout_flags</b> field is always zero.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUES</b> <b>FROM</b> <b>CALLOUTS</b></h4><pre>

       The  external  callout  function  returns an integer to PCRE2. If the value is zero, matching proceeds as
       normal. If the value is greater than zero, matching fails at the current point, but the testing of  other
       matching possibilities goes ahead, just as if a lookahead assertion had failed. If the value is less than
       zero, the match is abandoned, and the matching function returns the negative value.

       Negative  values  should  normally  be  chosen  from  the  set  of PCRE2_ERROR_xxx values. In particular,
       PCRE2_ERROR_NOMATCH forces a standard  "no  match"  failure.  The  error  number  PCRE2_ERROR_CALLOUT  is
       reserved for use by callout functions; it will never be used by PCRE2 itself.

</pre><h4><b>CALLOUT</b> <b>ENUMERATION</b></h4><pre>

       <b>int</b> <b>pcre2_callout_enumerate(const</b> <b>pcre2_code</b> <b>*</b><u>code</u><b>,</b>
         <b>int</b> <b>(*</b><u>callback</u><b>)(pcre2_callout_enumerate_block</b> <b>*,</b> <b>void</b> <b>*),</b>
         <b>void</b> <b>*</b><u>user_data</u><b>);</b>

       A  script  language  that  supports  the  use  of string arguments in callouts might like to scan all the
       callouts in a pattern before running the match. This can be done  by  calling  <b>pcre2_callout_enumerate()</b>.
       The  first argument is a pointer to a compiled pattern, the second points to a callback function, and the
       third is arbitrary user data. The callback function is called for every callout in  the  pattern  in  the
       order  in  which  they  appear.  Its  first argument is a pointer to a callout enumeration block, and its
       second argument is the <u>user_data</u> value that was  passed  to  <b>pcre2_callout_enumerate()</b>.  The  data  block
       contains the following fields:

         <u>version</u>                Block version number
         <u>pattern_position</u>       Offset to next item in pattern
         <u>next_item_length</u>       Length of next item in pattern
         <u>callout_number</u>         Number for numbered callouts
         <u>callout_string_offset</u>  Offset to string within pattern
         <u>callout_string_length</u>  Length of callout string
         <u>callout_string</u>         Points to callout string or is NULL

       The  version  number  is  currently  0.  It  will increase if new fields are ever added to the block. The
       remaining fields are the same as their namesakes in the <b>pcre2_callout</b> block that  is  used  for  callouts
       during matching, as described above.

       Note  that the value of <u>pattern_position</u> is unique for each callout.  However, if a callout occurs inside
       a group that is quantified with a non-zero minimum or a fixed maximum, the group is replicated inside the
       compiled pattern. For example, a pattern such as /(a){2}/ is compiled as if it were /(a)(a)<a href="file:/.">/.</a> This  means
       that  the callout will be enumerated more than once, but with the same value for <u>pattern_position</u> in each
       case.

       The callback function should normally return zero. If it returns a non-zero value, scanning  the  pattern
       stops, and that value is returned from <b>pcre2_callout_enumerate()</b>.
