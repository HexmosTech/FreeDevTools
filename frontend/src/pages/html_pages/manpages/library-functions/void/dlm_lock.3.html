</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       dlm_lock and its variants acquire and convert locks in the DLM.

       dlm_lock()  operations  are asynchronous. If the call to dlm_lock returns an error then the operation has
       failed and the AST routine will not be called. If dlm_lock returns 0 it is still possible that  the  lock
       operation  will  fail.  The AST routine will be called when the locking is complete or has failed and the
       status is returned in the lksb.  <b>dlm_lock_wait()</b> will wait until the lock  operation  has  completed  and
       returns  the  final  completion  status.   <b>dlm_ls_lock()</b>  is the same as <b>dlm_lock()</b> but takes a lockspace
       argument.   This   lockspace   must   have   been   previously   opened   by   <b>dlm_lockspace_open()</b>    <b>or</b>
       <b>dlm_lockspace_create().</b>

       For  conversion  operations  the  name  and  namelen  are  ignored and the lock ID in the LKSB is used to
       identify the lock to be converted.

       If a lock value block is specified then in general, a grant or a conversion to an equal-level or  higher-
       level  lock  mode  reads the lock value from the resource into the caller's lock value block. When a lock
       conversion from EX or PW to an equal-level or lower-level lock mode occurs, the contents of the  caller's
       lock  value  block are written into the resource. If the LVB is invalidated the lksb.sb_flags member will
       be set to DLM_SBF_VALNOTVALID. Lock values blocks are always 32 bytes long.

       If the AST routines or parameter are passed to a conversion operation  then  they  will  overwrite  those
       values that were passed to a previous dlm_lock call.

       <b>mode</b> Lock mode to acquire or convert to.
         LKM_NLMODE     NULL Lock
         LKM_CRMODE     Concurrent read
         LKM_CWMODE     Concurrent write
         LKM_PRMODE     Protected read
         LKM_PWMODE     Protected write
         LKM_EXMODE     Exclusive

       <b>flags</b> Affect the operation of the lock call:
         LKF_NOQUEUE     Don't queue the lock. If it cannot be granted return
                         -EAGAIN
         LKF_CONVERT     Convert an existing lock
         LKF_VALBLK      Lock has a value block
         LKF_QUECVT      Put conversion to the back of the queue
         LKF_EXPEDITE    Grant a NL lock immediately regardless of other locks
                         on the conversion queue
         LKF_PERSISTENT  Specifies a lock that will not be unlocked when the
                         process exits; it will become an orphan lock.
         LKF_CONVDEADLK  Enable internal conversion deadlock resolution where
                         the lock's granted mode may be set to NL and
                         DLM_SBF_DEMOTED is returned in lksb.sb_flags.
         LKF_NODLCKWT    Do not consider this lock when trying to detect
                         deadlock conditions.
         LKF_NODLCKBLK   Not implemented
         LKF_NOQUEUEBAST Send blocking ASTs even for NOQUEUE operations
         LKF_HEADQUE     Add locks to the head of the convert or waiting queue
         LKF_NOORDER     Avoid the VMS rules on grant order
         LKF_ALTPR       If the requested mode can't be granted (generally CW),
                         try to grant in PR and return DLM_SBF_ALTMODE.
         LKF_ALTCW       If the requested mode can't be granted (generally PR),
                         try to grant in CW and return DLM_SBF_ALTMODE.
         LKF_TIMEOUT     The lock will time out per the timeout arg.

       <b>lksb</b> Lock Status block
       This  structure  contains the returned lock ID, the actual status of the lock operation (all lock ops are
       asynchronous) and the value block if LKF_VALBLK is set.

       <b>name</b>
       Name of the lock. Can be binary, max 64 bytes. Ignored for lock conversions.  (Should be a string to work
       with debugging tools.)

       <b>namelen</b>
       Length of the above name. Ignored for lock conversions.

       <b>parent</b>
       ID of parent lock or NULL if this is a top-level lock. This is currently unused.

       <b>ast</b>
       Address of AST routine to be called when the lock operation completes. The final completion status of the
       lock will be in the lksb. the AST routine must not be NULL.

       <b>astargs</b>
       Argument to pass to the AST routine (most people pass the lksb in here but it can be anything you like.)

       <b>bast</b>
       Blocking AST routine. address of a function to call if this lock is blocking another. The  function  will
       be called with astargs.

       <b>range</b>
       This is unused.

       <b>xid</b>
       Optional transaction ID for deadlock detection.

       <b>timeout</b>
       Timeout  in centiseconds. If it takes longer than this to acquire the lock (usually because it is already
       blocked by another lock), then the AST will trigger with ETIMEDOUT as the status. If the  lock  operation
       is a conversion then the lock will remain at its current status. If this is a new lock then the lock will
       not exist and any LKB in the lksb will be invalid.  This is ignored without the LKF_TIMEOUT flag.

   <b>Return</b> <b>values</b>
       0  is  returned if the call completed successfully. If not, -1 is returned and errno is set to one of the
       following:

       EINVAL          An invalid parameter was passed to the call (eg bad lock
                       mode or flag)
       ENOMEM          A (kernel) memory allocation failed
       EAGAIN          LKF_NOQUEUE was requested and the lock could not be
                       granted
       EBUSY           The lock is currently being locked or converted
       EFAULT          The userland buffer could not be read/written by the
                       kernel (this indicates a library problem)
       EDEADLOCK       The lock operation is causing a deadlock and has been
                       cancelled. If this was a conversion then the lock is
                       reverted to its previously granted state. If it was a
                       new lock then it has not been granted. (NB Only
                       conversion deadlocks are currently detected)

       If an error is returned in the AST, then lksb.sb_status is set to the one of the above values instead of zero.
