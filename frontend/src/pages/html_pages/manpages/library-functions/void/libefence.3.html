</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Electric</u>  <u>Fence</u>  helps you detect two common programming bugs: software that overruns the boundaries of a
       malloc() memory allocation, and software that touches a memory  allocation  that  has  been  released  by
       free().  Unlike other malloc() debuggers, Electric Fence will detect <u>read</u> accesses as well as writes, and
       it will pinpoint the exact instruction that causes an error. It has been in use at Pixar since 1987,  and
       at many other sites for years.

       Electric  Fence  uses  the  virtual memory hardware of your computer to place an inaccessible memory page
       immediately after (or before, at the user's option) each memory allocation. When software reads or writes
       this inaccessible page, the hardware issues a segmentation fault, stopping the program at  the  offending
       instruction.  It  is  then  trivial  to  find  the erroneous statement using your favorite debugger. In a
       similar manner, memory that has been released by free() is made inaccessible, and any code  that  touches
       it will get a segmentation fault.

       Simply  linking  your  application  with  libefence.a  will allow you to detect most, but not all, malloc
       buffer overruns and accesses of free memory.  If you want to be reasonably sure  that  you've  found  <u>all</u>
       bugs of this type, you'll have to read and understand the rest of this man page.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       Link  your  program  with  the  library  <b>libefence.a</b>  <b>.</b>   Make  sure  you  are <u>not</u> linking with <b>-lmalloc,</b>
       <b>-lmallocdebug,</b> or with other malloc-debugger or malloc-enhancer libraries.  You can only  use  one  at  a
       time.   If  your  system administrator has installed Electric Fence for public use, you'll be able to use
       the <b>-lefence</b> argument to the linker, otherwise you'll have to put the path-name for  <b>libefence.a</b>  in  the
       linker's  command  line.  You can also use dynamic linking. If you're using a Bourne shell, the statement
       <b>export</b> <b>LD_PRELOAD=libefence.so.0.0</b> will cause Electric Fence to be loaded to run all dynamic executables.
       The command <b>ef</b> <u>command</u> runs a single command under Electric Fence.

       Some systems will require special arguments to the linker to assure that you are using the Electric Fence
       malloc() and not the one from your C library.

       Run your program <u>using</u> <u>a</u> <u>debugger.</u>  It's easier to work this way than to create a  <b>core</b>  file  and  post-
       mortem  debug  it.  Electric  Fence can create <u>huge</u> core files, and some operating systems will thus take
       minutes simply to dump core! Some operating systems will not create usable core files from programs  that
       are  linked  with  Electric  Fence.  If your program has one of the errors detected by Electric Fence, it
       will get a segmentation fault (SIGSEGV) at the offending instruction. Use  the  debugger  to  locate  the
       erroneous statement, and repair it.

</pre><h4><b>GLOBAL</b> <b>AND</b> <b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       Electric  Fence  has  six  configuration  switches  that  can be enabled via the shell environment, or by
       setting the value of global integer variables using a debugger. These switches change what bugs  Electric
       Fence will detect, so it's important that you know how to use them.

       EF_DISABLE_BANNER
              This  is  an integer which if nonzero specifies that the usual Electric Fence banner and copyright
              notice should not be printed.  This is provided for certain circumstances where the banner can  be
              annoying  (eg,  running  a regression test suite that also monitors stderr).  Note that you should
              almost certainly not set this in your program, because then you might leave Electric Fence  linked
              into the production version, which would be very bad.

       EF_ALIGNMENT
              This  is  an integer that specifies the alignment for any memory allocations that will be returned
              by malloc(), calloc(), and realloc().  The value is specified in bytes, thus a  value  of  4  will
              cause  memory  to  be  aligned  to  32-bit  boundaries  unless  your  system  doesn't have a 8-bit
              characters. EF_ALIGNMENT is set to sizeof(int) by default, since that is generally  the  word-size
              of  your  CPU.   If your program requires that allocations be aligned to 64-bit boundaries and you
              have a 32-bit <b>int</b> you'll have to set this value to 8. This is the case  when  compiling  with  the
              <b>-mips2</b>  flag on MIPS-based systems such as those from SGI.  The memory allocation that is returned
              by Electric Fence malloc() is aligned using the value in EF_ALIGNMENT, and <u>its</u> <u>size</u>  <u>the</u>  <u>multiple</u>
              <u>of</u>  <u>that</u>  <u>value</u>  that  is  greater than or equal to the requested size.  For this reason, you will
              sometimes want to set EF_ALIGNMENT to 0 (no alignment), so that you can detect  overruns  of  less
              than  your  CPU's  word  size. Be sure to read the section <u>WORD-ALIGNMENT</u> <u>AND</u> <u>OVERRUN</u> <u>DETECTION</u> in
              this manual page before you try this.  To  change  this  value,  set  EF_ALIGNMENT  in  the  shell
              environment  to  an  integer  value, or assign to the global integer variable EF_ALIGNMENT using a
              debugger.

       EF_PROTECT_BELOW
              Electric Fence usually places an inaccessible page immediately after each  memory  allocation,  so
              that  software that runs past the end of the allocation will be detected. Setting EF_PROTECT_BELOW
              to 1 causes Electric Fence to place the inaccessible page <u>before</u> the  allocation  in  the  address
              space,  so  that  under-runs will be detected instead of over-runs.  When EF_PROTECT_BELOW is set,
              the EF_ALIGNMENT parameter is ignored.  All allocations will  be  aligned  to  virtual-memory-page
              boundaries,  and  their size will be the exact size that was requested.  To change this value, set
              EF_PROTECT_BELOW in the shell environment to an integer value, or assign  to  the  global  integer
              variable EF_PROTECT_BELOW using a debugger.

       EF_PROTECT_FREE
              When EF_PROTECT_FREE is not set (i. e. set to 0), Electric Fence returns free memory to a pool and
              only  checks accesses to it until it is reallocated. If you suspect that a program may be touching
              free memory, set EF_PROTECT_FREE to 1. This will cause Electric Fence to never re-allocate  memory
              once it has been freed, so that any access to free memory will be detected. Some programs will use
              tremendous amounts of memory when this parameter is set. To change this value, set EF_PROTECT_FREE
              in  the  shell  environment  to  an  integer  value,  or  assign  to  the  global integer variable
              EF_PROTECT_FREE using a debugger.

       EF_ALLOW_MALLOC_0
              By default, Electric Fence traps calls to malloc() with a size of zero, because they are often the
              result of a software bug. If EF_ALLOW_MALLOC_0 is non-zero, the software will not  trap  calls  to
              malloc()  with  a  size  of  zero.   To  change  this  value,  set  EF_ALLOW_MALLOC_0 in the shell
              environment to an integer value, or assign to the global integer variable EF_ALLOW_MALLOC_0  using
              a debugger.

       EF_FILL
              When  set  to  a  value  between  0 and 255, every byte of allocated memory is initialized to that
              value. This can help detect reads of uninitialized memory.  When set to -1, some memory is  filled
              with  zeroes (the operating system default on most systems) and some memory will retain the values
              written to it during its last use.

</pre><h4><b>WORD-ALIGNMENT</b> <b>AND</b> <b>OVERRUN</b> <b>DETECTION</b></h4><pre>
       There is a conflict between the alignment restrictions that malloc() operates  under  and  the  debugging
       strategy  used  by Electric Fence. When detecting overruns, Electric Fence malloc() allocates two or more
       virtual memory pages for each allocation. The last page is made inaccessible in such a way that any read,
       write, or execute access will cause a segmentation fault.  Then, Electric Fence malloc() will  return  an
       address  such that the first byte after the end of the allocation is on the inaccessible page.  Thus, any
       overrun of the allocation will cause a segmentation fault.

       It follows that the address returned by malloc() is the address of the inaccessible page minus  the  size
       of  the memory allocation.  Unfortunately, malloc() is required to return <u>word-aligned</u> allocations, since
       many CPUs can only access a word when its address is aligned.  The conflict happens when software makes a
       memory allocation using a size that is not a multiple of the word size, and expects to do  word  accesses
       to that allocation. The location of the inaccessible page is fixed by hardware at a word-aligned address.
       If  Electric  Fence malloc() is to return an aligned address, it must increase the size of the allocation
       to a multiple of the word size.  In addition, the functions memalign() and valloc() must  honor  explicit
       specifications  on  the  alignment of the memory allocation, and this, as well can only be implemented by
       increasing the size of the allocation.  Thus, there will be situations in  which  the  end  of  a  memory
       allocation  contains some padding space, and accesses of that padding space will not be detected, even if
       they are overruns.

       Electric Fence provides the variable EF_ALIGNMENT so that the user can control the default alignment used
       by malloc(), calloc(), and realloc().  To debug  overruns  as  small  as  a  single  byte,  you  can  set
       EF_ALIGNMENT  to  zero.  This  will  result  in Electric Fence malloc() returning unaligned addresses for
       allocations with sizes that are not a multiple of the word size. This is not a  problem  in  most  cases,
       because  compilers  must  pad the size of objects so that alignment restrictions are honored when storing
       those objects in arrays. The problem surfaces when software allocates odd-sized buffers for objects  that
       must  be  word-aligned. One case of this is software that allocates a buffer to contain a structure and a
       string, and the string has an odd size (this example was in a popular TIFF library). If  word  references
       are  made  to  un-aligned buffers, you will see a bus error (SIGBUS) instead of a segmentation fault. The
       only way to fix this is to re-write the offending code to make byte  references  or  not  make  odd-sized
       allocations, or to set EF_ALIGNMENT to the word size.

       Another example of software incompatible with EF_ALIGNMENT &lt; word-size is the strcmp() function and other
       string  functions  on  SunOS (and probably Solaris), which make word-sized accesses to character strings,
       and may attempt to access up to three bytes beyond the end of a string. These result  in  a  segmentation
       fault  (SIGSEGV).  The  only way around this is to use versions of the string functions that perform byte
       references instead of word references.

</pre><h4><b>INSTRUCTIONS</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>DEBUGGING</b> <b>YOUR</b> <b>PROGRAM</b></h4><pre>
       1.     Link with libefence.a as explained above.

       2.     Run your program in a debugger and fix any overruns or accesses to free memory.

       3.     Quit the debugger.

       4.     Set EF_PROTECT_BELOW = 1 in the shell environment.

       5.     Repeat step 2, this time repairing underruns if they occur.

       6.     Quit the debugger.

       7.     Read the restrictions in the section on <u>WORD-ALIGNMENT</u> <u>AND</u> <u>OVERRUN</u> <u>DETECTION.</u>  See if you can  set
              EF_ALIGNMENT  to  0  and  repeat  step  2.  Sometimes this will be too much work, or there will be
              problems with library routines for which you don't have the source, that  will  prevent  you  from
              doing this.

</pre><h4><b>MEMORY</b> <b>USAGE</b> <b>AND</b> <b>EXECUTION</b> <b>SPEED</b></h4><pre>
       Since  Electric Fence uses at least two virtual memory pages for each of its allocations, it's a terrible
       memory hog. I've sometimes found it necessary to add a swap file using <a href="../man8/swapon.8.html">swapon</a>(8) so that the system would
       have enough virtual memory to debug my program. Also, the way we manipulate  memory  results  in  various
       cache  and  translation  buffer entries being flushed with each call to malloc or free. The end result is
       that your program will be much slower and use more resources while you are  debugging  it  with  Electric
       Fence.

       Don't leave libefence.a linked into production software! Use it only for debugging.

</pre><h4><b>WARNINGS</b></h4><pre>
       I  have  tried  to  do as good a job as I can on this software, but I doubt that it is even theoretically
       possible to make it bug-free.  This software has no warranty. It will not detect some bugs that you might
       expect it to detect, and will indicate that some non-bugs are bugs.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       My explanation of the alignment issue could be improved.

       Some  Sun  systems  running  SunOS  4.1 were reported to signal an access to a protected page with <b>SIGBUS</b>
       rather than <b>SIGSEGV,</b> I suspect this is an undocumented feature of a particular Sun hardware version,  not
       just  the  operating  system.   On  these systems, eftest will fail with a bus error until you modify the
       Makefile to define <b>PAGE_PROTECTION_VIOLATED_SIGNAL</b> as <b>SIGBUS.</b>

       There are, without doubt, other bugs and porting issues. Please contact me via e-mail if you have any bug
       reports, ideas, etc.

</pre><h4><b>WHAT'S</b> <b>BETTER</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Purify</u> does a much more thorough job than Electric Fence, and does not have  the  huge  memory  overhead.
       <u>Checkergcc,</u> a modified version of the GNU C Compiler that instruments all memory references, is available
       on  Linux  systems  and where GCC is used. It performs some of the same tasks as Purify, but only on code
       that it has compiled.
