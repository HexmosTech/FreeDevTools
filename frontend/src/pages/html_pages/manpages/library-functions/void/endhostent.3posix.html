</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       endhostent, gethostent, sethostent — network host database functions

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/netdb.h">netdb.h</a>&gt;

       void endhostent(void);
       struct hostent *gethostent(void);
       void sethostent(int <u>stayopen</u>);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       These  functions shall retrieve information about hosts. This information is considered to be stored in a
       database that can  be  accessed  sequentially  or  randomly.  The  implementation  of  this  database  is
       unspecified.

       <b>Note:</b>     In  many  cases  this  database  is  implemented  by  the  Domain Name System, as documented in
                 RFC 1034, RFC 1035, and RFC 1886.

       The <u>sethostent</u>() function shall open a connection to the database and set the next entry for retrieval to
       the first entry in the database. If the <u>stayopen</u> argument is non-zero, the connection shall not be closed
       by a call to <u>gethostent</u>(), and the implementation may maintain an open file descriptor.

       The <u>gethostent</u>() function shall read the next entry in the database, opening and closing a connection  to
       the database as necessary.

       Entries shall be returned in <b>hostent</b> structures.

       The <u>endhostent</u>() function shall close the connection to the database, releasing any open file descriptor.

       These functions need not be thread-safe.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       Upon  successful  completion,  the <u>gethostent</u>() function shall return a pointer to a <b>hostent</b> structure if
       the requested entry was found, and a null pointer if the end of the database was reached or the requested
       entry was not found.

       The application shall not modify the structure to which the return value points, nor  any  storage  areas
       pointed  to  by  pointers  within the structure. The returned pointer, and pointers within the structure,
       might be invalidated or the structure or the storage areas might be overwritten by a subsequent  call  to
       <u>gethostent</u>().   The returned pointer, and pointers within the structure, might also be invalidated if the
       calling thread is terminated.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       No errors are defined for <u>endhostent</u>(), <u>gethostent</u>(), and <u>sethostent</u>().

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>FUTURE</b> <b>DIRECTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
