</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Perl6::Caller - OO "caller()" interface

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       Version 0.04

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        use Perl6::Caller;

        my $sub         = caller-&gt;subroutine;
        my $line_number = caller-&gt;line;
        my $is_require  = <a href="../man3/caller.3.html">caller</a>(3)-&gt;is_require;

</pre><h4><b>EXPORT</b></h4><pre>
</pre><h4><b>caller"</b></h4><pre>
        # standard usage
        print "In ",           caller-&gt;subroutine,
              " called from ", caller-&gt;file,
              " line ",        caller-&gt;line;

        # get a caller object
        my $caller = caller;
        my $caller = caller();   # same thing

        # get a caller object for a different stack from
        my $caller = <a href="../man2/caller.2.html">caller</a>(2);  # two stack frames up
        print $caller-&gt;package;  # prints the package name

        # enjoy the original flavor
        my @caller = caller;     # original caller behavior
        print $caller[0],        # prints the package name

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module is experimental.  It's also alpha.  Bug reports and patches welcome.

       By default, this module exports the "caller" function.   This automatically returns a new "caller"
       object.  An optional argument specifies how many stack frames back to skip, just like the "CORE::caller"
       function.  This lets you do things like this:

        print "In ",           caller-&gt;subroutine,
              " called from ", caller-&gt;file,
              " line ",        caller-&gt;line;

       If you do not wish the "caller" function imported, specify an empty import list and instantiate a new
       "Perl6::Caller" object.

        use Perl6::Caller ();
        my $caller = Perl6::Caller-&gt;new;
        print $caller-&gt;line;

       <b>Note</b>:  if the results from the module seem strange, please read perldoc -s caller carefully.  It has
       stranger behavior than you might be aware.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       The following methods are available on the "caller" object.  They return the same values as documented in
       perldoc -f caller.

       There are no "hints" and "bitmask" methods because those are documented as for internal use only.

       •   "package"

       •   "filename"

       •   "line"

       •   "subroutine"

       •   "hasargs"

       •   "wantarray"

       •   "evaltext"

       •   "is_require"

       Note  that  each  of  these  values  will  report  correctly for when the caller object was created.  For
       example, the following will probably print different line numbers:

        print caller-&gt;line;
        foo();
        sub foo {
           print caller-&gt;line;
        }

       However, the following will print the <u>same</u> line numbers:

        my $caller = Perl6::Caller-&gt;new;   # everything is relative to here
        print $caller-&gt;line;
        foo($caller);
        sub foo {
           my $caller = shift;
           print $caller-&gt;line;
        }

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
       Most of the time, this package should <u>just</u> <u>work</u> and not interfere with anything else.

       •   $hints, $bitmask

           'hints' and 'bitmask' are not available.  They are documented to be for internal use only and  should
           not  be  relied  upon.   Further, the bitmask caused strange test failures, so I opted not to include
           them.

       •   Subclassing

           Don't.

       •   Perl 6

           I'm not entirely comfortable with the namespace.  The Perl 6 caller actually does considerably  more,
           but  for  me  to  have  a hope of working that in, I need proper introspection and I don't have that.
           Thus, I've settled for simply having a caller object.

       •   *CORE::GLOBAL::caller

           I didn't implement this, though I was tempted.  It turns out to be a bit tricky in spots and I'm very
           concerned about globally overriding behavior.  I might change my mind in the future if there's enough
           demand.

       •   Overloading

           In string context, this returns the package name.  This is to support the original "caller" behavior.

       •   List Context

           In list context, we simply default to the original behavior of "CORE::caller".  However, this  <u>always</u>
           assumes we've called caller with an argument.  Calling "caller" and <a href="../man0/caller.0.html">caller</a>(0) are identical with this
           module.  It's difficult to avoid since the stack frame changes.
