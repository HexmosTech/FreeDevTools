       RDF::Generator::HTTP - Generate RDF from a HTTP message

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use LWP::UserAgent;
         my $ua = LWP::UserAgent-&gt;new;
         my $response = $ua-&gt;get('<a href="http://search.cpan.org/">http://search.cpan.org/</a>');

         use RDF::Generator::HTTP;
         use RDF::Trine qw(iri);
         my $g = RDF::Generator::HTTP-&gt;new(message =&gt; $response,
                                           graph =&gt; iri('<a href="http://example.org/graphname">http://example.org/graphname</a>'),
                                           blacklist =&gt; ['Last-Modified', 'Accept']);

         my $s   = RDF::Trine::Serializer-&gt;new('turtle', namespaces =&gt;
                                               { httph =&gt; '<a href="http://www.w3.org/2007/ont/httph">http://www.w3.org/2007/ont/httph</a>#',
                                                 http =&gt; '<a href="http://www.w3.org/2007/ont/http">http://www.w3.org/2007/ont/http</a>#' } );
         $s-&gt;serialize_model_to_file(\*STDOUT, $model);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module simply takes a HTTP::Message object, and based on its content, especially the content the
       HTTP::Header object(s) it contains, creates a simple RDF representation of the contents. It is useful
       chiefly for recording data when crawling resources on the Web, but it may also have other uses.

   <b>Constructor</b>
       "new(%attributes)"
           Moose-style constructor function.

   <b>Attributes</b>
       These attributes may be passed to the constructor to set them, or called like methods to get them.

       "message"
           A HTTP::Message (or subclass thereof) object to generate RDF for. Required.

       "blacklist"
           An "ArrayRef" of header field names that you do not want to see in the output.

       "whitelist"
           An  "ArrayRef"  of the only header field names that you want to see in the output. The whitelist will
           be ignored if the blacklist is set.

       "graph"
           You may pass an optional graph name to be used for all triples in the output. This must be an  object
           of RDF::Trine::Node::Resource.

       "ns"
           An URI::NamespaceMap object containing namespace prefixes used in the module. You should probably not
           override this even though you can.

       "request_subject"
           An RDF::Trine::Node object containing the subject of any statements describing requests. If unset, it
           will default to a blank node.

       "response_subject"
           An  RDF::Trine::Node  object containing the subject of any statements describing responses. If unset,
           it will default to a blank node.

   <b>Methods</b>
       The above attributes all have read-accessors by the same name. "blacklist", "whitelist" and "graph"  also
       has  writers  and predicates, which is used to test if the attribute has been set, by prefixing "has_" to
       the attribute name.

       This class has two methods:

       "generate ( [ $model ] )"
           This method will generate the RDF. It may optionally take an RDF::Trine::Model as  parameter.  If  it
           exists, the RDF will be added to this model, if not, a new Memory model will be created and returned.

       "ok_to_add ( $field )"
           This  method  will  look  up  in the blacklists and whitelists and return true if the given field and
           value may be added to the model.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       For an example of what the module can be used to create, consider the example in the "SYNOPSIS", which at
       the time of this writing outputs the following Turtle:

         @prefix http: &lt;<a href="http://www.w3.org/2007/ont/http">http://www.w3.org/2007/ont/http</a>#&gt; .
         @prefix httph: &lt;<a href="http://www.w3.org/2007/ont/httph">http://www.w3.org/2007/ont/httph</a>#&gt; .

         [] a http:RequestMessage ;
               http:hasResponse [
                       a http:ResponseMessage ;
                       http:status "200" ;
                       httph:client_date "Sun, 14 Dec 2014 21:28:21 GMT" ;
                       httph:client_peer "207.171.7.59:80" ;
                       httph:client_response_num "1" ;
                       httph:connection "close" ;
                       httph:content_length "3643" ;
                       httph:content_type "text/html" ;
                       httph:date "Sun, 14 Dec 2014 21:28:21 GMT" ;
                       httph:link "&lt;<a href="http://search.cpan.org/uploads.rdf">http://search.cpan.org/uploads.rdf</a>&gt;; rel=\"alternate\"; title=\"RSS 1.0\"; type=\"application/rss+xml\"", "&lt;<a href="http://st.pimg.net/tucs/opensearch.xml">http://st.pimg.net/tucs/opensearch.xml</a>&gt;; rel=\"search\"; title=\"SearchCPAN\"; type=\"application/opensearchdescription+xml\"", "&lt;<a href="http://st.pimg.net/tucs/print.css">http://st.pimg.net/tucs/print.css</a>&gt;; media=\"print\"; rel=\"stylesheet\"; type=\"text/css\"", "&lt;<a href="http://st.pimg.net/tucs/style.css">http://st.pimg.net/tucs/style.css</a>?3&gt;; rel=\"stylesheet\"; type=\"text/css\"" ;
                       httph:server "Plack/Starman (Perl)" ;
                       httph:title "The CPAN Search Site - search.cpan.org" ;
                       httph:x_proxy "proxy2"
               ] ;
               http:method "GET" ;
               http:requestURI &lt;<a href="http://search.cpan.org/">http://search.cpan.org/</a>&gt; ;
               httph:user_agent "libwww-perl/6.05" .

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>HTTP</b> <b>Vocabularies</b>
       There have been many efforts to create HTTP vocabularies (or ontologies), where the  most  elaborate  and
       complete  is the HTTP Vocabulary in RDF 1.0 &lt;<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/HTTP-in-RDF/">http://www.w3.org/TR/HTTP-in-RDF/</a>&gt;.  Nevertheless, I decided
       not to support this, but rather support an older and much less complete vocabulary that has been  in  the
       Tabulator   &lt;https://github.com/linkeddata/tabulator-firefox&gt;   project,   with  the  namespace  prefixes
       &lt;<a href="http://www.w3.org/2007/ont/http">http://www.w3.org/2007/ont/http</a>#&gt; and &lt;<a href="http://www.w3.org/2007/ont/httph">http://www.w3.org/2007/ont/httph</a>#&gt;. The problem of modelling HTTP
       is that headers modify each other, so if you want to record the HTTP headers so that they can be used  in
       an  actual  HTTP  dialogue  afterwards,  they  have  to  be  in  a  container  so  that  the order can be
       reconstructed.  Moreover, there is a lot of microstructure in the values, and that also  adds  complexity
       if  you  want to translate all that to RDF. That's what the former vocabulary does. However, for now, all
       the author wants to do is to record them, and then neither of these concerns are important.  Therefore, I
       opted to go for a much simpler vocabulary, where each field is a simple predicate. That  is  not  to  say
       that the former approach isn't valid, it is just not something I need now.
