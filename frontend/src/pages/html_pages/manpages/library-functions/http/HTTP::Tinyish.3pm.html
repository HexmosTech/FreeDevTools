</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       HTTP::Tinyish - HTTP::Tiny compatible HTTP client wrappers

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         my $http = HTTP::Tinyish-&gt;new(agent =&gt; "Mozilla/4.0");

         my $res = $http-&gt;get("<a href="http://www.cpan.org/">http://www.cpan.org/</a>");
         warn $res-&gt;{status};

         $http-&gt;post("<a href="http://example.com/post">http://example.com/post</a>", {
             headers =&gt; { "Content-Type" =&gt; "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" },
             content =&gt; "foo=bar&amp;baz=quux",
         });

         $http-&gt;mirror("<a href="http://www.cpan.org/modules/02packages.details.txt.gz">http://www.cpan.org/modules/02packages.details.txt.gz</a>", "./02packages.details.txt.gz");

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       HTTP::Tinyish is a wrapper module for HTTP client modules LWP, HTTP::Tiny and HTTP client software "curl"
       and "wget".

       It provides an API compatible to HTTP::Tiny, and the implementation has been extracted out of
       App::cpanminus. This module can be useful in a restrictive environment where you need to be able to
       download CPAN modules without an HTTPS support in built-in HTTP library.

</pre><h4><b>BACKEND</b> <b>SELECTION</b></h4><pre>
       Backends are searched in the order of: LWP, HTTP::Tiny, "curl" and "wget". HTTP::Tinyish will auto-detect
       if the backend also supports HTTPS, and use the appropriate backend based on the given URL to the request
       methods.

       For example, if you only have HTTP::Tiny but without SSL related modules, it is possible that:

         my $http = HTTP::Tinyish-&gt;new;

         $http-&gt;get("<a href="http://example.com">http://example.com</a>");  # uses HTTP::Tiny
         $http-&gt;get("https://example.com"); # uses curl

</pre><h4><b>COMPATIBILITIES</b></h4><pre>
       All request related methods such as "get", "post", "put", "delete", "request", "patch" and "mirror" are
       supported.

   <b>LWP</b>
       •   LWP  backend  requires  LWP  5.802  or  over to be functional, and LWP::Protocol::https to send HTTPS
           requests.

       •   "mirror" method doesn't consider third options hash into account (i.e. you can't  override  the  HTTP
           headers).

       •   proxy is automatically detected from environment variables.

       •   "timeout", "max_redirect", "agent", "default_headers" and "verify_SSL" are translated.

   <b>HTTP::Tiny</b>
       Because the actual HTTP::Tiny backend is used, all APIs are supported.

   <b>Curl</b>
       •   This module has been tested with curl 7.22 and later.

       •   HTTPS support is automatically detected by running "curl --version" and see its protocol output.

       •   "timeout", "max_redirect", "agent", "default_headers" and "verify_SSL" are supported.

   <b>Wget</b>
       •   This module requires Wget 1.12 and later.

       •   Wget  prior  to  1.15  doesn't  support  sending  custom HTTP methods, so if you use "$http-&gt;put" for
           example, you'll get an internal error response (599).

       •   HTTPS support is automatically detected.

       •   mirror() method doesn't send "If-Modified-Since" header to the server, which  will  result  in  full-
           download every time because "wget" doesn't support "--timestamping" combined with "-O" option.

       •   "timeout", "max_redirect", "agent", "default_headers" and "verify_SSL" are supported.

</pre><h4><b>SIMILAR</b> <b>MODULES</b></h4><pre>
       •   File::Fetch  -  is  core since 5.10. Has support for non-HTTP protocols such as ftp and git. Does not
           support HTTPS or basic authentication as of this writing.

       •   Plient - provides more complete runtime API, but seems only compatible on Unix environments. Does not
           support <b>mirror()</b> method.
