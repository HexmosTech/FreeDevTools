       Tk::place - Geometry manager for fixed or rubber-sheet placement

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
          <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>place</b>?(<u>-option</u>=&gt;<u>value</u>?, <u>-option</u>=&gt;<u>value</u>, ...)?

          <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>placeForget</b>

          <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>placeInfo</b>

          <u>$master</u>-&gt;<b>placeSlaves</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The placer is a geometry manager for Tk.  It provides simple fixed placement of windows, where you
       specify the exact size and location of one window, called the <u>slave</u>, within another window, called the
       <u>master</u>.  The placer also provides rubber-sheet placement, where you specify the size and location of the
       slave in terms of the dimensions of the master, so that the slave changes size and location in response
       to changes in the size of the master.  Lastly, the placer allows you to mix these styles of placement so
       that, for example, the slave has a fixed width and height but is centered inside the master.

       <u>$slave</u>-&gt;<b>place</b>?(<u>-option</u>=&gt;<u>value</u>?, <u>-option</u>=&gt;<u>value</u>, ...?)?
           The  <b>place</b>  method arranges for the placer to manage the geometry of <u>$slave</u>.  The remaining arguments
           consist of one or more <u>-option</u>=&gt;<u>value</u> pairs that specify  the  way  in  which  <u>$slave</u>'s  geometry  is
           managed. <u>-option</u> may have any of the values accepted by the placeConfigure method.

           The <b>place</b> method returns <u>$slave</u>.

       <u>$slave</u>-&gt;<b>placeConfigure</b>?(<u>-option</u>=&gt;<u>value</u>?, <u>-option</u>=&gt;<u>value</u>, ...?)?
           Query  or modify the geometry options of the <u>$slave</u>. If no option is specified, this method returns a
           list describing the available options (see Tk_ConfigureInfo for information on  the  format  of  this
           list). If option is specified with no value, then the command returns a list describing the one named
           option  (this  list will be identical to the corresponding sublist of the value returned if no option
           is specified). If one or more option-value pairs are specified, then the method  modifies  the  given
           option(s) to have the given value(s); in this case the command returns "undef".

           The following <u>-option</u>=&gt;<u>value</u> pairs are supported:

           <b>-anchor</b> =&gt; <u>where</u>
                   <u>Where</u>  specifies  which point of <u>$slave</u> is to be positioned at the (x,y) location selected by
                   the <b>-x</b>, <b>-y</b>, <b>-relx</b>, and <b>-rely</b> options.  The anchor point is in terms  of  the  outer  area  of
                   <u>$slave</u>  including  its  border,  if  any.  Thus if <u>where</u> is <b>se</b> then the lower-right corner of
                   <u>$slave</u>'s border will appear at the given (x,y) location in the master.  The  anchor  position
                   defaults to <b>nw</b>.

           <b>-bordermode</b> =&gt; <u>mode</u>
                   <u>Mode</u>  determines  the  degree  to which borders within the master are used in determining the
                   placement of the slave.  The default and most common value  is  <b>inside</b>.   In  this  case  the
                   placer  considers  the  area of the master to be the innermost area of the master, inside any
                   border: an option of <b>-x</b>=&gt;<b>0</b> corresponds to an x-coordinate  just  inside  the  border  and  an
                   option of <b>-relwidth</b>=&gt;1.0 means <u>$slave</u> will fill the area inside the master's border.  If <u>mode</u>
                   is  <b>outside</b> then the placer considers the area of the master to include its border; this mode
                   is typically used when placing <u>$slave</u> outside its master, as with the options  <b>-x</b>=&gt;<b>0</b>,  <b>-y</b>=&gt;<b>0</b>,
                   <b>-anchor</b>=&gt;<b>ne</b>.   Lastly,  <u>mode</u>  may  be specified as <b>ignore</b>, in which case borders are ignored:
                   the area of the master is considered to be its official X area, which includes  any  internal
                   border but no external border.  A bordermode of <b>ignore</b> is probably not very useful.

           <b>-height</b> =&gt; <u>size</u>
                   <u>Size</u>  specifies  the  height  for  <u>$slave</u>  in screen units (i.e. any of the forms accepted by
                   <b>Tk_GetPixels</b>).  The height will be the outer dimension of <u>$slave</u>  including  its  border,  if
                   any.   If  <u>size</u>  is an empty string, or if no <b>-height</b> or <b>-relheight</b> option is specified, then
                   the height requested internally by the window will be used.

           <b>-in</b> =&gt; <u>$master</u>
                   <u>$master</u> is the reference to the window relative to which <u>$slave</u> is  to  be  placed.   <u>$master</u>
                   must  either be <u>$slave</u>'s parent or a descendant of <u>$slave</u>'s parent.  In addition, <u>$master</u> and
                   <u>$slave</u> must both be descendants  of  the  same  top-level  window.   These  restrictions  are
                   necessary  to  guarantee  that <u>$slave</u> is visible whenever <u>$master</u> is visible.  If this option
                   isn't specified then the master defaults to <u>$slave</u>'s parent.

           <b>-relheight</b> =&gt; <u>size</u>
                   <u>Size</u> specifies the height for <u>$slave</u>.  In this case the height is specified  as  a  floating-
                   point  number  relative to the height of the master: 0.5 means <u>$slave</u> will be half as high as
                   the master, 1.0 means <u>$slave</u> will have the same height as the master, and  so  on.   If  both
                   <b>-height</b>  and  <b>-relheight</b>  are  specified  for a slave, their values are summed.  For example,
                   <b>-relheight</b>=&gt;1.0, <b>-height</b>=&gt;-2 makes the slave 2 pixels shorter than the master.

           <b>-relwidth</b> =&gt; <u>size</u>
                   <u>Size</u> specifies the width for <u>$slave</u>.  In this case the width is specified as a floating-point
                   number relative to the width of the master: 0.5 means <u>$slave</u> will be  half  as  wide  as  the
                   master,  1.0  means <u>$slave</u> will have the same width as the master, and so on.  If both <b>-width</b>
                   and  <b>-relwidth</b>  are  specified  for  a  slave,  their  values  are  summed.    For   example,
                   <b>-relwidth</b>=&gt;1.0, <b>-width</b>=&gt;5 makes the slave 5 pixels wider than the master.

           <b>-relx</b> =&gt; <u>location</u>
                   <u>Location</u>  specifies  the x-coordinate within the master window of the anchor point for <u>$slave</u>
                   widget.  In this case the location is specified in a relative  fashion  as  a  floating-point
                   number:  0.0 corresponds to the left edge of the master and 1.0 corresponds to the right edge
                   of  the  master.   <u>Location</u>  need  not  be  in  the  range 0.0-1.0.  If both <b>-x</b> and <b>-relx</b> are
                   specified for a slave then  their  values  are  summed.   For  example,  "<b>-relx</b>=&gt;0.5,  <b>-x</b>=-2"
                   positions the left edge of the slave 2 pixels to the left of the center of its master.

           <b>-rely</b> =&gt; <u>location</u>
                   <u>Location</u>  specifies  the y-coordinate within the master window of the anchor point for <u>$slave</u>
                   widget.  In this case the value is specified  in  a  relative  fashion  as  a  floating-point
                   number:  0.0 corresponds to the top edge of the master and 1.0 corresponds to the bottom edge
                   of  the  master.   <u>Location</u>  need  not  be  in  the  range 0.0-1.0.  If both <b>-y</b> and <b>-rely</b> are
                   specified for a slave then their values are summed.  For example, <b>-rely</b>=&gt;0.5, <b>-x</b>=&gt;3 positions
                   the top edge of the slave 3 pixels below the center of its master.

           <b>-width</b> =&gt; <u>size</u>
                   <u>Size</u> specifies the width for <u>$slave</u> in screen units  (i.e.  any  of  the  forms  accepted  by
                   <b>Tk_GetPixels</b>).  The width will be the outer width of <u>$slave</u> including its border, if any.  If
                   <u>size</u>  is  an  empty  string, or if no <b>-width</b> or <b>-relwidth</b> option is specified, then the width
                   requested internally by the window will be used.

           <b>-x</b> =&gt; <u>location</u>
                   <u>Location</u> specifies the x-coordinate within the master window of the anchor point  for  <u>$slave</u>
                   widget.   The  location  is  specified  in  screen  units  (i.e. any of the forms accepted by
                   <b>Tk_GetPixels</b>) and need not lie within the bounds of the master window.

           <b>-y</b> =&gt; <u>location</u>
                   <u>Location</u> specifies the y-coordinate within the master window of the anchor point  for  <u>$slave</u>
                   widget.   The  location  is  specified  in  screen  units  (i.e. any of the forms accepted by
                   <b>Tk_GetPixels</b>) and need not lie within the bounds of the master window.

           If the same value is specified separately with two different options, such as <b>-x</b> and <b>-relx</b>, then  the
           most recent option is used and the older one is ignored.

       <u>$slave</u>-&gt;<b>placeForget</b>
           The  <b>placeForget</b>  method causes the placer to stop managing the geometry of <u>$slave</u>.  As a side effect
           of this method call <u>$slave</u> will be unmapped so that it doesn't appear on the screen.  If <u>$slave</u> isn't
           currently managed by the placer then the method call has no effect.   <b>placeForget</b>  returns  an  empty
           string as result.

       <u>$slave</u>-&gt;<b>placeInfo</b>
           The <b>placeInfo</b> method returns a list giving the current configuration of <u>$slave</u>.  The list consists of
           <u>-option</u>=&gt;<u>value</u> pairs in exactly the same form as might be specified to the <b>place</b> method.

       <u>$slave</u>-&gt;<b>placeSlaves</b>
           The  <b>placeSlaves</b>  method returns a list of all the slave windows for which <u>$master</u> is the master.  If
           there are no slaves for <u>$master</u> then an empty list is returned.

       If the configuration of a window has been retrieved with <b>placeInfo</b>, that configuration  can  be  restored
       later by first using <b>placeForget</b> to erase any existing information for the window and then invoking <b>place</b>
       with the saved information.

</pre><h4><b>FINE</b> <b>POINTS</b></h4><pre>
       It  is  not necessary for the master window to be the parent of the slave window.  This feature is useful
       in at least two situations.  First, for complex window layouts it means you can  create  a  hierarchy  of
       subwindows  whose  only  purpose  is to assist in the layout of the parent.  The ``<u>real</u> <u>children</u>'' of the
       parent (i.e. the windows that are significant for the application's user interface) can  be  children  of
       the  parent  yet  be placed inside the windows of the geometry-management hierarchy.  This means that the
       path names of the ``<u>real</u> <u>children</u>'' don't reflect the geometry-management hierarchy and users can specify
       options for the real children without being aware of the structure of the geometry-management hierarchy.

       A second reason for having a master different than the slave's parent is to tie  two  siblings  together.
       For  example, the placer can be used to force a window always to be positioned centered just below one of
       its siblings by specifying the configuration

           <b>-in</b>=&gt;<u>$sibling</u>, <b>-relx</b>=&gt;0.5, <b>-rely</b>=&gt;1.0, <b>-anchor</b>=&gt;'n', <b>-bordermode</b>=&gt;'outside'

       Whenever the <u>$sibling</u> widget is repositioned in the future, the slave will be repositioned as well.

       Unlike many other geometry managers (such as the  packer)  the  placer  does  not  make  any  attempt  to
       manipulate  the geometry of the master windows or the parents of slave windows (i.e. it doesn't set their
       requested sizes).  To control the sizes of these windows, make them windows like frames and canvases that
       provide configuration options for this purpose.
