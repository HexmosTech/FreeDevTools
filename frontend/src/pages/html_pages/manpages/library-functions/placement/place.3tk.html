       place - Geometry manager for fixed or rubber-sheet placement

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>place</b> <u>option</u> <u>arg</u> ?<u>arg</u> <u>...</u>?
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  placer  is  a  geometry  manager  for  Tk.  It provides simple fixed placement of windows, where you
       specify the exact size and location of one window, called the <u>content</u>, within another window, called  the
       <u>container</u>.   The  placer also provides rubber-sheet placement, where you specify the size and location of
       the content in terms of the dimensions of the container, so that the content changes size and location in
       response to changes in the size of the container.  Lastly, the placer allows you to mix these  styles  of
       placement  so  that,  for  example,  the  content has a fixed width and height but is centered inside the
       container.

       <b>place</b> <u>window</u> <u>option</u> <u>value</u> ?<u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>...</u>?
              Arrange for the placer to manage the  geometry  of  a  content  whose  pathName  is  <u>window</u>.   The
              remaining  arguments  consist  of  one  or  more  <u>option-value</u> pairs that specify the way in which
              <u>window</u>'s geometry is managed.  <u>Option</u> may have any of the values accepted by the  <b>place</b>  <b>configure</b>
              command.

       <b>place</b> <b>configure</b> <u>window</u> ?<u>option</u>? ?<u>value</u> <u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>...</u>?
              Query  or  modify the geometry options of the content given by <u>window</u>.  If no <u>option</u> is specified,
              this command returns a list describing the available options (see <b>Tk_ConfigureInfo</b> for information
              on the format of this list).  If <u>option</u> is specified with no <u>value</u>, then  the  command  returns  a
              list  describing the one named option (this list will be identical to the corresponding sublist of
              the value returned if no <u>option</u> is specified).  If one or more <u>option-value</u> pairs  are  specified,
              then the command modifies the given option(s) to have the given value(s); in this case the command
              returns an empty string.

              The following <u>option-value</u> pairs are supported:

              <b>-anchor</b> <u>where</u>
                     <u>Where</u> specifies which point of <u>window</u> is to be positioned at the (x,y) location selected by
                     the  <b>-x</b>,  <b>-y</b>,  <b>-relx</b>, and <b>-rely</b> options.  The anchor point is in terms of the outer area of
                     <u>window</u> including its border, if any.  Thus if <u>where</u> is <b>se</b> then the  lower-right  corner  of
                     <u>window</u>'s  border  will  appear  at  the  given (x,y) location in the container.  The anchor
                     position defaults to <b>nw</b>.

              <b>-bordermode</b> <u>mode</u>
                     <u>Mode</u> determines the degree to which borders within the container are  used  in  determining
                     the  placement  of the content.  The default and most common value is <b>inside</b>.  In this case
                     the placer considers the area of the container to be the innermost area of  the  container,
                     inside  any border: an option of <b>-x</b> <b>0</b> corresponds to an x-coordinate just inside the border
                     and an option of <b>-relwidth</b> <b>1.0</b> means <u>window</u> will  fill  the  area  inside  the  container's
                     border.

                     If  <u>mode</u>  is  <b>outside</b>  then  the  placer considers the area of the container to include its
                     border; this mode is typically used when placing <u>window</u> outside its container, as with  the
                     options  <b>-x</b>  <b>0</b>  <b>-y</b>  <b>0</b>  <b>-anchor</b>  <b>ne</b>.  Lastly, <u>mode</u> may be specified as <b>ignore</b>, in which case
                     borders are ignored:  the area of the container is considered to be its  official  X  area,
                     which  includes  any  internal  border  but  no external border.  A bordermode of <b>ignore</b> is
                     probably not very useful.

              <b>-height</b> <u>size</u>
                     <u>Size</u> specifies the height for <u>window</u> in screen units (i.e. any of  the  forms  accepted  by
                     <b>Tk_GetPixels</b>).   The  height will be the outer dimension of <u>window</u> including its border, if
                     any.  If <u>size</u> is an empty string, or if no <b>-height</b> or <b>-relheight</b> option is specified,  then
                     the height requested internally by the window will be used.

              <b>-in</b> <u>container</u>
                     <u>Container</u>  specifies  the path name of the window relative to which <u>window</u> is to be placed.
                     <u>Container</u> must either be <u>window</u>'s parent or a descendant of <u>window</u>'s parent.  In  addition,
                     <u>container</u>  and  <u>window</u>  must  both  be  descendants  of  the  same top-level window.  These
                     restrictions are necessary to guarantee  that  <u>window</u>  is  visible  whenever  <u>container</u>  is
                     visible.   If  this  option  is  not  specified  then the other window defaults to <u>window</u>'s
                     parent.

              <b>-relheight</b> <u>size</u>
                     <u>Size</u> specifies the height for <u>window</u>.  In this case the height is specified as a  floating-
                     point number relative to the height of the container: 0.5 means <u>window</u> will be half as high
                     as  the  container, 1.0 means <u>window</u> will have the same height as the container, and so on.
                     If both <b>-height</b> and <b>-relheight</b> are specified for a content, their values are  summed.   For
                     example, <b>-relheight</b> <b>1.0</b> <b>-height</b> <b>-2</b> makes the content 2 pixels shorter than the container.

              <b>-relwidth</b> <u>size</u>
                     <u>Size</u>  specifies  the  width for <u>window</u>.  In this case the width is specified as a floating-
                     point number relative to the width of the container: 0.5 means <u>window</u> will be half as  wide
                     as  the  container,  1.0 means <u>window</u> will have the same width as the container, and so on.
                     If both <b>-width</b> and <b>-relwidth</b> are specified for a content, their  values  are  summed.   For
                     example, <b>-relwidth</b> <b>1.0</b> <b>-width</b> <b>5</b> makes the content 5 pixels wider than the container.

              <b>-relx</b> <u>location</u>
                     <u>Location</u>  specifies  the  x-coordinate  within the container window of the anchor point for
                     <u>window</u>.  In this case the location is specified in a relative fashion as  a  floating-point
                     number:  0.0 corresponds to the left edge of the container and 1.0 corresponds to the right
                     edge  of  the  container.  <u>Location</u> need not be in the range 0.0-1.0.  If both <b>-x</b> and <b>-relx</b>
                     are specified for a content then their values are summed.  For example,  <b>-relx</b>  <b>0.5</b>  <b>-x</b>  <b>-2</b>
                     positions the left edge of the content 2 pixels to the left of the center of its container.

              <b>-rely</b> <u>location</u>
                     <u>Location</u>  specifies  the  y-coordinate  within the container window of the anchor point for
                     <u>window</u>.  In this case the value is specified in a  relative  fashion  as  a  floating-point
                     number:  0.0 corresponds to the top edge of the container and 1.0 corresponds to the bottom
                     edge  of  the  container.  <u>Location</u> need not be in the range 0.0-1.0.  If both <b>-y</b> and <b>-rely</b>
                     are specified for a content then their values are summed.  For  example,  <b>-rely</b>  <b>0.5</b>  <b>-x</b>  <b>3</b>
                     positions the top edge of the content 3 pixels below the center of its container.

              <b>-width</b> <u>size</u>
                     <u>Size</u>  specifies  the  width  for  <u>window</u> in screen units (i.e. any of the forms accepted by
                     <b>Tk_GetPixels</b>).  The width will be the outer width of <u>window</u> including its border,  if  any.
                     If  <u>size</u>  is  an  empty  string, or if no <b>-width</b> or <b>-relwidth</b> option is specified, then the
                     width requested internally by the window will be used.

              <b>-x</b> <u>location</u>
                     <u>Location</u> specifies the x-coordinate within the container window of  the  anchor  point  for
                     <u>window</u>.   The  location  is  specified  in  screen units (i.e. any of the forms accepted by
                     <b>Tk_GetPixels</b>) and need not lie within the bounds of the container window.

              <b>-y</b> <u>location</u>
                     <u>Location</u> specifies the y-coordinate within the container window of  the  anchor  point  for
                     <u>window</u>.   The  location  is  specified  in  screen units (i.e. any of the forms accepted by
                     <b>Tk_GetPixels</b>) and need not lie within the bounds of the container window.

              If the same value is specified separately with two different options, such as <b>-x</b> and  <b>-relx</b>,  then
              the most recent option is used and the older one is ignored.

       <b>place</b> <b>content</b> <u>window</u>
              Returns  a  list  of  all  the  content  windows for which <u>window</u> is the container. If there is no
              content for <u>window</u> then an empty string is returned.

       <b>place</b> <b>forget</b> <u>window</u>
              Causes the placer to stop managing the geometry of <u>window</u>.  As  a  side  effect  of  this  command
              <u>window</u>  will  be  unmapped  so  that it does not appear on the screen.  If <u>window</u> is not currently
              managed by the placer then the command has no effect.  This command returns an empty string.

       <b>place</b> <b>info</b> <u>window</u>
              Returns a list giving the current configuration of <u>window</u>.   The  list  consists  of  <u>option-value</u>
              pairs in exactly the same form as might be specified to the <b>place</b> <b>configure</b> command.

       <b>place</b> <b>slaves</b> <u>window</u>
              Synonym for <b>place</b> <b>content</b> <u>window</u>.

       If  the  configuration of a window has been retrieved with <b>place</b> <b>info</b>, that configuration can be restored
       later by first using <b>place</b> <b>forget</b> to erase any existing information for  the  window  and  then  invoking
       <b>place</b> <b>configure</b> with the saved information.

</pre><h4><b>FINE</b> <b>POINTS</b></h4><pre>
       It  is  not  necessary  for the container window to be the parent of the content window.  This feature is
       useful in at least two situations.  First, for complex window layouts it means you can create a hierarchy
       of subwindows whose only purpose is to assist in the layout of the parent.  The “real  children”  of  the
       parent  (i.e.  the  windows that are significant for the application's user interface) can be children of
       the parent yet be placed inside the windows of the geometry-management hierarchy.  This  means  that  the
       path  names of the “real children” do not reflect the geometry-management hierarchy and users can specify
       options for the real children without being aware of the structure of the geometry-management hierarchy.

       A second reason for having a container different than  the  content's  parent  is  to  tie  two  siblings
       together.   For  example,  the placer can be used to force a window always to be positioned centered just
       below one of its siblings by specifying the configuration
              <b>-in</b> <u>sibling</u> <b>-relx</b> <b>0.5</b> <b>-rely</b> <b>1.0</b> <b>-anchor</b> <b>n</b> <b>-bordermode</b> <b>outside</b>
       Whenever the sibling is repositioned in the future, the content will be repositioned as well.

       Unlike many other geometry managers (such as the  packer)  the  placer  does  not  make  any  attempt  to
       manipulate  the geometry of the container windows or the parents of content windows (i.e. it does not set
       their requested sizes).  To control the sizes of  these  windows,  make  them  windows  like  frames  and
       canvases that provide configuration options for this purpose.

       Make the label occupy the middle bit of the toplevel, no matter how it is resized:
              label .l -text "In the\nMiddle!" -bg black -fg white
              <b>place</b> .l -relwidth .3 -relx .35 -relheight .3 -rely .35
