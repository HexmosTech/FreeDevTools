</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Moose is a postmodern object system for Perl5. Moose is wonderful.

       Unfortunately, Moose has a compile-time penalty. Though significant progress has been made over the
       years, the compile time penalty is a non-starter for some very specific applications. If you are writing
       a command-line application or CGI script where startup time is essential, you may not be able to use
       Moose (we recommend that you instead use persistent Perl executing environments like "FastCGI" for the
       latter, if possible).

       Mouse is a Moose compatible object system, which aims to alleviate this penalty by providing a subset of
       Moose's functionality.

       We're also going as light on dependencies as possible. Mouse currently has <b>no</b> <b>dependencies</b> except for
       building/testing modules. Mouse also works without XS, although it has an XS backend to make it much
       faster.

   <b>Moose</b> <b>Compatibility</b>
       Compatibility with Moose has been the utmost concern. The sugary interface is highly compatible with
       Moose. Even the error messages are taken from Moose.  The Mouse code just runs its test suite 4x faster.

       The idea is that, if you need the extra power, you should be able to run "s/Mouse/Moose/g" on your
       codebase and have nothing break. To that end, we have written Any::Moose which will act as Mouse unless
       Moose is loaded, in which case it will act as Moose. Since Mouse is a little sloppier than Moose, if you
       run into weird errors, it would be worth running:

           ANY_MOOSE=Moose perl your-script.pl

       to see if the bug is caused by Mouse. Moose's diagnostics and validation are also better.

       See also Mouse::Spec for compatibility and incompatibility with Moose.

   <b>Mouse</b> <b>Extentions</b>
       Please don't copy MooseX code to MouseX. If you need extensions, you really should upgrade to Moose. We
       don't need two parallel sets of extensions!

       If you really must write a Mouse extension, please contact the Moose mailing list or #moose on IRC
       beforehand.

</pre><h4><b>KEYWORDS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>"$object-&gt;meta</b> <b>-&gt;</b> <b>Mouse::Meta::Class"</b>
       Returns this class' metaclass instance.

   <b>"extends</b> <b>superclasses"</b>
       Sets this class' superclasses.

   <b>"before</b> <b>(method|methods|regexp)</b> <b>=&gt;</b> <b>CodeRef"</b>
       Installs a "before" method modifier. See "before" in Moose.

   <b>"after</b> <b>(method|methods|regexp)</b> <b>=&gt;</b> <b>CodeRef"</b>
       Installs an "after" method modifier. See "after" in Moose.

   <b>"around</b> <b>(method|methods|regexp)</b> <b>=&gt;</b> <b>CodeRef"</b>
       Installs an "around" method modifier. See "around" in Moose.

   <b>"has</b> <b>(name|names)</b> <b>=&gt;</b> <b>parameters"</b>
       Adds an attribute (or if passed an arrayref of names, multiple attributes) to this class. Options:

       "is =&gt; ro|rw|bare"
           The  <u>is</u>  option  accepts  either <u>rw</u> (for read/write), <u>ro</u> (for read only) or <u>bare</u> (for nothing). These
           will create either a read/write accessor or a read-only accessor respectively, using the same name as
           the $name of the attribute.

           If you need more control over how your accessors are named, you can use the  "reader",  "writer"  and
           "accessor" options, however if you use those, you won't need the <u>is</u> option.

       "isa =&gt; TypeName | ClassName"
           Provides  type  checking  in  the  constructor  and  accessor. The following types are supported. Any
           unknown type is taken to be a class check (e.g.  "isa  =&gt;  'DateTime'"  would  accept  only  DateTime
           objects).

               Any Item Bool Undef Defined Value Num Int Str ClassName
               Ref ScalarRef ArrayRef HashRef CodeRef RegexpRef GlobRef
               FileHandle Object

           For more documentation on type constraints, see Mouse::Util::TypeConstraints.

       "does =&gt; RoleName"
           This  will  accept  the  name  of a role which the value stored in this attribute is expected to have
           consumed.

       "coerce =&gt; Bool"
           This will attempt to use coercion with the supplied type constraint to change the value  passed  into
           any  accessors  or  constructors. You <b>must</b> have supplied a type constraint in order for this to work.
           See Moose::Cookbook::Basics::Recipe5 for an example.

       "required =&gt; Bool"
           Whether this attribute is required to have a value. If the attribute is lazy or has a  builder,  then
           providing a value for the attribute in the constructor is optional.

       "init_arg =&gt; Str | Undef"
           Allows  you  to use a different key name in the constructor.  If undef, the attribute can't be passed
           to the constructor.

       "default =&gt; Value | CodeRef"
           Sets the default value of the attribute. If the default is a coderef, it will be invoked to  get  the
           default value. Due to quirks of Perl, any bare reference is forbidden, you must wrap the reference in
           a coderef. Otherwise, all instances will share the same reference.

       "lazy =&gt; Bool"
           If specified, the default is calculated on demand instead of in the constructor.

       "predicate =&gt; Str"
           Lets you specify a method name for installing a predicate method, which checks that the attribute has
           a value. It will not invoke a lazy default or builder method.

       "clearer =&gt; Str"
           Lets  you  specify  a method name for installing a clearer method, which clears the attribute's value
           from the instance. On the next read, lazy or builder will be invoked.

       "handles =&gt; HashRef|ArrayRef|Regexp"
           Lets you specify methods to delegate to the attribute. ArrayRef forwards the given  method  names  to
           method  calls  on the attribute. HashRef maps local method names to remote method names called on the
           attribute. Other forms of "handles", such as RoleName and CodeRef, are not yet supported.

       "weak_ref =&gt; Bool"
           Lets you automatically weaken any reference stored in the attribute.

           Use of this feature requires Scalar::Util!

       "trigger =&gt; CodeRef"
           Any time the attribute's value is set (either through the accessor or the constructor),  the  trigger
           is called on it. The trigger receives as arguments the instance, and the new value.

       "builder =&gt; Str"
           Defines  a  method  name  to  be  called  to  provide the default value of the attribute. "builder =&gt;
           'build_foo'" is mostly equivalent to "default =&gt; sub { $_[0]-&gt;build_foo }".

       "auto_deref =&gt; Bool"
           Allows you to automatically dereference ArrayRef and HashRef attributes in list  context.  In  scalar
           context,  the  reference  is  returned  (NOT  the  list length or bucket status). You must specify an
           appropriate type constraint to use auto_deref.

       "lazy_build =&gt; Bool"
           Automatically define the following options:

               has $attr =&gt; (
                   # ...
                   lazy      =&gt; 1
                   builder   =&gt; "_build_$attr",
                   clearer   =&gt; "clear_$attr",
                   predicate =&gt; "has_$attr",
               );

   <b>"<a href="../manmessage/confess.message.html">confess</a>(message)</b> <b>-&gt;</b> <b>BOOM"</b>
       "confess" in Carp for your convenience.

   <b>"blessed(value)</b> <b>-&gt;</b> <b>ClassName</b> <b>|</b> <b>undef"</b>
       "blessed" in Scalar::Util for your convenience.

</pre><h4><b>MISC</b></h4><pre>
   <b>import</b>
       Importing Mouse will default your class' superclass list to Mouse::Object.   You  may  use  "extends"  to
       replace the superclass list.

   <b>unimport</b>
       Please  unimport  Mouse  ("no Mouse") so that if someone calls one of the keywords (such as "extends") it
       will break loudly instead breaking subtly.

</pre><h4><b>DEVELOPMENT</b></h4><pre>
       Here is the repo: &lt;https://github.com/gfx/p5-Mouse&gt;.

       You can build, test, and release it with <b>Minilla</b>.

           cpanm Minilla
           minil build
           minil test
           minil release

       Note that <u>Build.PL</u> and <u>README.md</u> are generated by Minilla, so you should not edit them.  Edit  <u>minil.toml</u>
       and <u>lib/Mouse.pm</u> instead.
