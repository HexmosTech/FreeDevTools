</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       List::Objects::WithUtils::Array::Junction - Lightweight junction classes

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         # See List::Objects::WithUtils::Role::Array::WithJunctions

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       These are light-weight junction objects covering most of the functionality provided by
       Syntax::Keyword::Junction. They provide the objects created by the "all_items" and "any_items" methods
       defined by List::Objects::WithUtils::Role::Array::WithJunctions.

       Only the junction types used by List::Objects::WithUtils ('any' and 'all') are implemented; nothing is
       exported. The "~~" smart-match operator is not supported. See Syntax::Keyword::Junction if you were
       looking for a stand-alone implementation with more features.

       The junction objects produced are subclasses of List::Objects::WithUtils::Array.

       See List::Objects::WithUtils::Role::Array::WithJunctions for usage details.

   <b>Motivation</b>
       My original goal was to get Sub::Exporter out of the List::Objects::WithUtils dependency tree; that one
       came along with Syntax::Keyword::Junction.

       Perl6::Junction would have done that for me. Unfortunately, that comes with some unresolved RT bugs right
       now that are reasonably annoying (especially warnings under perl-5.18.x).

</pre><h4><b>AUTHOR</b></h4><pre>
       This code is originally derived from Perl6::Junction by way of Syntax::Keyword::Junction; the original
       author is Carl Franks, based on the Perl6 design documentation.
