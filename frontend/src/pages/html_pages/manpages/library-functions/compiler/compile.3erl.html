</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       compile - Erlang Compiler

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  module  provides  an  interface to the standard Erlang compiler. It can generate either a new file,
       which contains the object code, or return a binary, which can be loaded directly.

</pre><h4><b>DATA</b> <b>TYPES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>option()</b> <b>=</b> <b>term()</b>

              See file/2 for detailed description

       <b>forms()</b> <b>=</b> <b>term()</b>

              List of Erlang abstract or Core Erlang format representations, as used by forms/2

</pre><h4><b>EXPORTS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>env_compiler_options()</b>

              Return compiler options given via the environment variable <u>ERL_COMPILER_OPTIONS</u>. If the value is a
              list, it is returned as is. If it is not a list, it is put into a list.

       <b>file(File)</b>

              Is the same as <u>file(File,</u> <u>[verbose,report_errors,report_warnings])</u>.

       <b>file(File,</b> <b>Options)</b> <b>-&gt;</b> <b>CompRet</b>

              Types:

                 CompRet = ModRet | BinRet | ErrRet
                 ModRet = {ok,ModuleName} | {ok,ModuleName,Warnings}
                 BinRet = {ok,ModuleName,Binary} | {ok,ModuleName,Binary,Warnings}
                 ErrRet = error | {error,Errors,Warnings}

              Compiles the code in the file <u>File</u>,  which  is  an  Erlang  source  code  file  without  the  <u>.erl</u>
              extension. <u>Options</u> determine the behavior of the compiler.

              Returns  <u>{ok,ModuleName}</u>  if  successful,  or  <u>error</u>  if  there are errors. An object code file is
              created if the compilation succeeds without errors. It is considered to be an error if the  module
              name in the source code is not the same as the basename of the output file.

              Available options:

                <u>brief</u>:
                  Restricts  error  and  warning messages to a single line of output. As of OTP 24, the compiler
                  will by default also display the part of the source code that the message refers to.

                <u>basic_validation</u>:
                  This option is a fast way to test whether a module will compile successfully. This  is  useful
                  for  code  generators  that  want  to verify the code that they emit. No code is generated. If
                  warnings are enabled, warnings generated by the <u>erl_lint</u> module (such as warnings  for  unused
                  variables and functions) are also returned.

                  Use option <u>strong_validation</u> to generate all warnings that the compiler would generate.

                <u>strong_validation</u>:
                  Similar  to option <u>basic_validation</u>. No code is generated, but more compiler passes are run to
                  ensure that warnings generated by the optimization passes are generated (such as clauses  that
                  will not match, or expressions that are guaranteed to fail with an exception at runtime).

                <u>binary</u>:
                  The  compiler  returns  the  object  code  in  a binary instead of creating an object file. If
                  successful, the compiler returns <u>{ok,ModuleName,Binary}</u>.

                <u>bin_opt_info</u>:
                  The compiler will emit  informational  warnings  about  binary  matching  optimizations  (both
                  successful  and unsuccessful). For more information, see the section about bin_opt_info in the
                  Efficiency Guide.

                <u>{compile_info,</u> <u>[{atom(),</u> <u>term()}]}</u>:
                  Allows compilers built on  top  of  <u>compile</u>  to  attach  extra  compilation  metadata  to  the
                  <u>compile_info</u> chunk in the generated beam file.

                  It  is  advised for compilers to remove all non-deterministic information if the <u>deterministic</u>
                  option is supported and it was supplied by the user.

                <u>compressed</u>:
                  The compiler will compress the generated  object  code,  which  can  be  useful  for  embedded
                  systems.

                <u>debug_info</u>:

                  Includes  debug  information in the form of  Erlang Abstract Format in the <u>debug_info</u> chunk of
                  the compiled beam  module.  Tools  such  as  Debugger,  Xref,  and  Cover  require  the  debug
                  information to be included.

                  <u>Warning</u>:  Source  code  can  be  reconstructed from the debug information. Use encrypted debug
                  information (<u>encrypt_debug_info</u>) to prevent this.

                  For details, see <a href="../man3erl/beam_lib.3erl.html">beam_lib</a>(3erl).

                <u>{debug_info,</u> <u>{Backend,</u> <u>Data}}</u>:

                  Includes custom debug information in the form of a <u>Backend</u> module  with  custom  <u>Data</u>  in  the
                  compiled  beam  module.  The  given  module  must  implement  a  <u>debug_info/4</u>  function and is
                  responsible for generating different code representations,  as  described  in  the  <u>debug_info</u>
                  under <a href="../man3erl/beam_lib.3erl.html">beam_lib</a>(3erl).

                  <u>Warning</u>:  Source  code  can  be  reconstructed from the debug information. Use encrypted debug
                  information (<u>encrypt_debug_info</u>) to prevent this.

                <u>{debug_info_key,KeyString}</u>:

                <u>{debug_info_key,{Mode,KeyString}}</u>:

                  Includes debug information, but encrypts it so that it cannot be  accessed  without  supplying
                  the  key. (To give option <u>debug_info</u> as well is allowed, but not necessary.) Using this option
                  is a good way to always have the debug information available during  testing,  yet  protecting
                  the source code.

                  <u>Mode</u>  is  the  type  of  crypto algorithm to be used for encrypting the debug information. The
                  default (and currently the only) type is <u>des3_cbc</u>.

                  For details, see <a href="../man3erl/beam_lib.3erl.html">beam_lib</a>(3erl).

                <u>encrypt_debug_info</u>:

                  Similar to the <u>debug_info_key</u> option, but the key is read from an <u>.erlang.crypt</u> file.

                  For details, see <a href="../man3erl/beam_lib.3erl.html">beam_lib</a>(3erl).

                <u>deterministic</u>:
                  Omit the <u>options</u> and <u>source</u> tuples in the list returned  by  <u>Module:module_info(compile)</u>,  and
                  reduce  the paths in stack traces to the module name alone. This option will make it easier to
                  achieve reproducible builds.

                <u>makedep</u>:
                  Produces a Makefile rule to track headers dependencies. No object file is produced.

                  By default, this rule is written to <u>&lt;File&gt;.Pbeam</u>. However, if option <u>binary</u> is set, nothing is
                  written and the rule is returned in <u>Binary</u>.

                  The output will be encoded in UTF-8.

                  For example, if you have the following module:

                -<a href="../manmodule/module.module.html">module</a>(module).

                -include_lib("eunit/include/eunit.hrl").
                -include("header.hrl").

                  The Makefile rule generated by this option looks as follows:

                module.beam: module.erl \
                  /usr/local/lib/erlang/lib/eunit/include/eunit.hrl \
                  header.hrl

                <u>makedep_side_effect</u>:
                  The dependecies are created as a side effect to the normal  compilation  process.  This  means
                  that the object file will also be produced. This option override the <u>makedep</u> option.

                <u>{makedep_output,</u> <u>Output}</u>:
                  Writes generated rules to <u>Output</u> instead of the default <u>&lt;File&gt;.Pbeam</u>. <u>Output</u> can be a filename
                  or  an <u>io_device()</u>. To write to stdout, use <u>standard_io</u>. However, if <u>binary</u> is set, nothing is
                  written to <u>Output</u> and the result is returned to the caller with <u>{ok,</u> <u>ModuleName,</u> <u>Binary}</u>.

                <u>{makedep_target,</u> <u>Target}</u>:
                  Changes the name of the rule emitted to <u>Target</u>.

                <u>makedep_quote_target</u>:
                  Characters in <u>Target</u> special to <a href="../man1/make.1.html">make</a>(1) are quoted.

                <u>makedep_add_missing</u>:
                  Considers missing headers as generated files and adds them to the dependencies.

                <u>makedep_phony</u>:
                  Adds a phony target for each dependency.

                <u>'P'</u>:
                  Produces a listing of the parsed code, after preprocessing and parse transforms, in  the  file
                  <u>&lt;File&gt;.P</u>. No object file is produced.

                <u>'E'</u>:
                  Produces  a listing of the code, after all source code transformations have been performed, in
                  the file <u>&lt;File&gt;.E</u>. No object file is produced.

                <u>'S'</u>:
                  Produces a listing of the assembler code in the file <u>&lt;File&gt;.S</u>. No object file is produced.

                <u>recv_opt_info</u>:
                  The compiler will emit informational warnings  about  selective  receive  optimizations  (both
                  successful  and  unsuccessful). For more information, see the section about  selective receive
                  optimization in the Efficiency Guide.

                <u>report_errors/report_warnings</u>:
                  Causes errors/warnings to be printed as they occur.

                <u>report</u>:
                  A short form for both <u>report_errors</u> and <u>report_warnings</u>.

                <u>return_errors</u>:
                  If this flag is set, <u>{error,ErrorList,WarningList}</u> is returned when there are errors.

                <u>return_warnings</u>:
                  If this flag is set, an extra field, containing <u>WarningList</u>, is added to the  tuples  returned
                  on success.

                <u>warnings_as_errors</u>:
                  Causes warnings to be treated as errors. This option is supported since R13B04.

                <u>{error_location,line</u> <u>|</u> <u>column}</u>:
                  If the value of this flag is <u>line</u>, the location <u>ErrorLocation</u> of warnings and errors is a line
                  number. If the value is <u>column</u>, <u>ErrorLocation</u> includes both a line number and a column number.
                  Default is <u>column</u>. This option is supported since Erlang/OTP 24.0.

                  If the value of this flag is <u>column</u>, debug information includes column information.

                <u>return</u>:
                  A short form for both <u>return_errors</u> and <u>return_warnings</u>.

                <u>verbose</u>:
                  Causes more verbose information from the compiler, describing what it is doing.

                <u>{source,FileName}</u>:
                  Overrides the source file name as presented in <u>module_info(compile)</u> and stack traces.

                <u>{outdir,Dir}</u>:
                  Sets  a  new  directory  for the object code. The current directory is used for output, except
                  when a directory has been specified with this option.

                <u>export_all</u>:
                  Causes all functions in the module to be exported.

                <u>{i,Dir}</u>:
                  Adds <u>Dir</u> to the list of directories to be searched when including a file. When encountering an
                  <u>-include</u> or <u>-include_lib</u> directive, the compiler searches for header files  in  the  following
                  directories:

                  * <u>"."</u>, the current working directory of the file server

                  * The base name of the compiled file

                  * The directories specified using option <u>i</u>; the directory specified last is searched first

                <u>{d,Macro}</u>:

                <u>{d,Macro,Value}</u>:
                  Defines  a  macro  <u>Macro</u>  to have the value <u>Value</u>. <u>Macro</u> is of type atom, and <u>Value</u> can be any
                  term. The default <u>Value</u> is <u>true</u>.

                <u>{parse_transform,Module}</u>:
                  Causes the parse transformation function <u>Module:parse_transform/2</u> to be applied to the  parsed
                  code before the code is checked for errors.

                <u>from_abstr</u>:
                  The  input  file  is  expected  to  contain Erlang terms representing forms in abstract format
                  (default file suffix ".abstr"). Note  that  the  format  of  such  terms  can  change  between
                  releases.

                  See also the <u>no_lint</u> option.

                <u>from_asm</u>:
                  The  input  file  is expected to be assembler code (default file suffix ".S"). Notice that the
                  format of assembler files is not documented, and can change between releases.

                <u>from_core</u>:
                  The input file is expected to be core code (default file  suffix  ".core").  Notice  that  the
                  format of core files is not documented, and can change between releases.

                <u>no_spawn_compiler_process</u>:
                  By  default,  all  code  is  compiled  in a separate process which is terminated at the end of
                  compilation. However, some tools, like Dialyzer or compilers for  other  BEAM  languages,  may
                  already  manage  their  own  worker  processes  and  spawning  an  extra  process may slow the
                  compilation down. In such scenarios, you can pass  this  option  to  stop  the  compiler  from
                  spawning an additional process.

                <u>no_strict_record_tests</u>:
                  This option is not recommended.

                  By  default,  the generated code for operation <u>Record#record_tag.field</u> verifies that the tuple
                  <u>Record</u> has the correct size for the record, and that the first element is the tag  <u>record_tag</u>.
                  Use this option to omit the verification code.

                <u>no_error_module_mismatch</u>:
                  Normally  the  compiler  verifies that the module name given in the source code is the same as
                  the base name of the output file and refuses  to  generate  an  output  file  if  there  is  a
                  mismatch.  If  you  have a good reason (or other reason) for having a module name unrelated to
                  the name of the output file, this option disables that verification (there will not even be  a
                  warning if there is a mismatch).

                <u>{no_auto_import,[{F,A},</u> <u>...]}</u>:
                  Makes  the  function  <u>F/A</u> no longer being auto-imported from the <u>erlang</u> module, which resolves
                  BIF name clashes. This option must be used to resolve name  clashes  with  BIFs  auto-imported
                  before R14A, if it is needed to call the local function with the same name as an auto-imported
                  BIF without module prefix.

            <b>Note:</b>
                As from R14A and forward, the compiler resolves calls without module prefix to local or imported
                functions  before  trying  with  auto-imported  BIFs. If the BIF is to be called, use the <u>erlang</u>
                module prefix in the call, not <u>{no_auto_import,[{F,A},</u> <u>...]}</u>.

                  If this option is written in the source code, as a <u>-compile</u> directive, the syntax <u>F/A</u>  can  be
                  used instead of <u>{F,A}</u>, for example:

                -compile({no_auto_import,[error/1]}).

                <u>no_auto_import</u>:
                  Do not auto-import any functions from <u>erlang</u> module.

                <u>no_line_info</u>:
                  Omits line number information to produce a slightly smaller output file.

                <u>no_lint</u>:
                  Skips  the  pass  that  checks  for  errors  and  warnings.  Only applicable together with the
                  <u>from_abstr</u> option. This is mainly for implementations of other languages  on  top  of  Erlang,
                  which have already done their own checks to guarantee correctness of the code.

                  Caveat: When this option is used, there are no guarantees that the code output by the compiler
                  is  correct  and  safe  to  use. The responsibility for correctness lies on the code or person
                  generating the abstract format. If the code contains errors, the compiler may crash or produce
                  unsafe code.

                <u>{extra_chunks,</u> <u>[{binary(),</u> <u>binary()}]}</u>:
                  Pass extra chunks to be stored in the <u>.beam</u> file. The extra chunks must be a  list  of  tuples
                  with  a  four  byte  binary  as  chunk  name followed by a binary with the chunk contents. See
                  beam_lib for more information.

              If warnings are turned on  (option  <u>report_warnings</u>  described  earlier),  the  following  options
              control  what  type  of  warnings  that  are  generated.  Except from <u>{warn_format,Verbosity}</u>, the
              following options have two forms:

                * A <u>warn_xxx</u> form, to turn on the warning.

                * A <u>nowarn_xxx</u> form, to turn off the warning.

              In the descriptions that follow, the form that is used to change the default value are listed.

                <u>{warn_format,</u> <u>Verbosity}</u>:
                  Causes warnings to be emitted for malformed format  strings  as  arguments  to  <u>io:format</u>  and
                  similar functions.

                  <u>Verbosity</u> selects the number of warnings:

                  * <u>0</u> = No warnings

                  * <u>1</u> = Warnings for invalid format strings and incorrect number of arguments

                  * <u>2</u>  =  Warnings also when the validity cannot be checked, for example, when the format string
                    argument is a variable.

                  The default verbosity is <u>1</u>. Verbosity <u>0</u> can also be selected by option <u>nowarn_format</u>.

                <u>nowarn_bif_clash</u>:
                  This option is removed, it generates a fatal error if used.

            <b>Warning:</b>
                As from beginning with R14A, the compiler no longer calls the  auto-imported  BIF  if  the  name
                clashes with a local or explicitly imported function, and a call without explicit module name is
                issued.  Instead,  the  local  or  imported function is called. Still accepting <u>nowarn_bif_clash</u>
                would make a module calling functions clashing with auto-imported BIFs compile with both the old
                and new compilers, but with completely different semantics. This is why the option is removed.

                The use of this option has always been discouraged. As from R14A, it is an error to use it.

                To resolve BIF clashes,  use  explicit  module  names  or  the  <u>{no_auto_import,[F/A]}</u>  compiler
                directive.

                <u>{nowarn_bif_clash,</u> <u>FAs}</u>:
                  This option is removed, it generates a fatal error if used.

            <b>Warning:</b>
                The use of this option has always been discouraged. As from R14A, it is an error to use it.

                To  resolve  BIF  clashes,  use  explicit  module  names  or the <u>{no_auto_import,[F/A]}</u> compiler
                directive.

                <u>nowarn_export_all</u>:
                  Turns off warnings for uses of the <u>export_all</u> option. Default is to emit a warning  if  option
                  <u>export_all</u> is also given.

                <u>warn_export_vars</u>:
                  Emits  warnings  for  all implicitly exported variables referred to after the primitives where
                  they were first defined. By default, the compiler only emits warnings for  exported  variables
                  referred to in a pattern.

                <u>nowarn_shadow_vars</u>:
                  Turns off warnings for "fresh" variables in functional objects or list comprehensions with the
                  same name as some already defined variable. Default is to emit warnings for such variables.

                <u>nowarn_unused_function</u>:
                  Turns  off  warnings  for  unused  local  functions. Default is to emit warnings for all local
                  functions that are not called directly or indirectly by an  exported  function.  The  compiler
                  does  not  include unused local functions in the generated beam file, but the warning is still
                  useful to keep the source code cleaner.

                <u>{nowarn_unused_function,</u> <u>FAs}</u>:
                  Turns off warnings for unused local functions like <u>nowarn_unused_function</u> does, but  only  for
                  the mentioned local functions. <u>FAs</u> is a tuple <u>{Name,Arity}</u> or a list of such tuples.

                <u>nowarn_deprecated_function</u>:
                  Turns  off  warnings  for calls to deprecated functions. Default is to emit warnings for every
                  call to a function known by the compiler to be deprecated. Notice that the compiler  does  not
                  know  about  attribute  <u>-deprecated()</u>,  but  uses an assembled list of deprecated functions in
                  Erlang/OTP. To do a more general check, the Xref tool can be used. See also <a href="../man3erl/xref.3erl.html">xref</a>(3erl) and the
                  function xref:m/1, also accessible through the function c:xm/1.

                <u>{nowarn_deprecated_function,</u> <u>MFAs}</u>:
                  Turns off warnings for calls to deprecated functions like <u>nowarn_deprecated_function</u> does, but
                  only for the mentioned functions. <u>MFAs</u> is a  tuple  <u>{Module,Name,Arity}</u>  or  a  list  of  such
                  tuples.

                <u>nowarn_deprecated_type</u>:
                  Turns off warnings for use of deprecated types. Default is to emit warnings for every use of a
                  type known by the compiler to be deprecated.

                <u>nowarn_removed</u>:
                  Turns  off warnings for calls to functions that have been removed. Default is to emit warnings
                  for every call to a function known  by  the  compiler  to  have  been  recently  removed  from
                  Erlang/OTP.

                <u>{nowarn_removed,</u> <u>ModulesOrMFAs}</u>:
                  Turns  off  warnings  for  calls to modules or functions that have been removed. Default is to
                  emit warnings for every call to a function known by the compiler to have been recently removed
                  from Erlang/OTP.

                <u>nowarn_obsolete_guard</u>:
                  Turns off warnings for calls to old type testing BIFs, such  as  <u>pid/1</u>  and  <u>list/1</u>.  See  the
                  Erlang  Reference  Manual  for a complete list of type testing BIFs and their old equivalents.
                  Default is to emit warnings for calls to old type testing BIFs.

                <u>warn_unused_import</u>:
                  Emits warnings for unused imported functions. Default  is  to  emit  no  warnings  for  unused
                  imported functions.

                <u>nowarn_underscore_match</u>:
                  By  default,  warnings  are  emitted when a variable that begins with an underscore is matched
                  after being bound. Use this option to turn off this kind of warning.

                <u>nowarn_unused_vars</u>:
                  By default, warnings are emitted for unused variables, except for variables beginning with  an
                  underscore ("Prolog style warnings"). Use this option to turn off this kind of warning.

                <u>nowarn_unused_record</u>:
                  Turns  off  warnings  for  unused  record  definitions. Default is to emit warnings for unused
                  locally defined records.

                <u>{nowarn_unused_record,</u> <u>RecordNames}</u>:
                  Turns off warnings for unused record definitions. Default  is  to  emit  warnings  for  unused
                  locally defined records.

                <u>nowarn_unused_type</u>:
                  Turns  off warnings for unused type declarations. Default is to emit warnings for unused local
                  type declarations.

                <u>nowarn_nif_inline</u>:
                  By default, warnings are emitted when inlining is enabled in a module that may load  NIFs,  as
                  the  compiler  may  inline NIF fallbacks by accident. Use this option to turn off this kind of
                  warnings.

                <u>warn_missing_spec</u>:
                  By default, warnings are not emitted when  a  specification  (or  contract)  for  an  exported
                  function is not given. Use this option to turn on this kind of warning.

                <u>warn_missing_spec_all</u>:
                  By  default,  warnings  are  not emitted when a specification (or contract) for an exported or
                  unexported function is not given. Use this option to turn on this kind of warning.

              Other kinds of warnings are <u>opportunistic</u> <u>warnings</u>. They are generated when the  compiler  happens
              to notice potential issues during optimization and code generation.

          <b>Note:</b>
              The  compiler does not warn for expressions that it does not attempt to optimize. For example, the
              compiler will emit a warning for <u>1/0</u> but not for <u>X/0</u>, because <u>1/0</u> is a  constant  expression  that
              the compiler will attempt to evaluate.

              The absence of warnings does not mean that there are no remaining errors in the code.

              Opportunistic warnings can be disabled using the following options:

                <u>nowarn_opportunistic</u>:
                  Disable all opportunistic warnings.

                <u>nowarn_failed</u>:
                  Disable warnings for expressions that will always fail (such as <u>atom+42</u>).

                <u>nowarn_ignored</u>:
                  Disable warnings for expressions whose values are ignored.

                <u>nowarn_nomatch</u>:
                  Disable  warnings  for patterns that will never match (such as <u>a=b</u>) and for guards that always
                  evaluate to <u>false</u>.

          <b>Note:</b>
              All options, except the include path (<u>{i,Dir}</u>), can also be  given  in  the  file  with  attribute
              <u>-compile([Option,...])</u>. Attribute <u>-compile()</u> is allowed after the function definitions.

          <b>Note:</b>
              Before OTP 22, the option <u>{nowarn_deprecated_function,</u> <u>MFAs}</u> was only recognized when given in the
              file   with   attribute  <u>-compile()</u>.  (The  option  <u>{nowarn_unused_function,FAs}</u>  was  incorrectly
              documented to only work in a file, but it also worked when given in  the  option  list.)  Starting
              from OTP 22, all options that can be given in the file can also be given in the option list.

              For  debugging  of  the  compiler,  or for pure curiosity, the intermediate code generated by each
              compiler pass can be inspected. To print a complete list of the options  to  produce  list  files,
              type  <u>compile:options()</u>  at the Erlang shell prompt. The options are printed in the order that the
              passes are executed. If more than one listing option is used, the one  representing  the  earliest
              pass takes effect.

              Unrecognized options are ignored.

              Both <u>WarningList</u> and <u>ErrorList</u> have the following format:

              [{FileName,[ErrorInfo]}].

              <u>ErrorInfo</u>  is described later in this section. The filename is included here, as the compiler uses
              the Erlang pre-processor <u>epp</u>, which allows the code to be included in other files. It is therefore
              important to know to <u>which</u> file the location of an error or a warning refers.

       <b>forms(Forms)</b>

              Is the same as <u>forms(Forms,</u> <u>[verbose,report_errors,report_warnings])</u>.

       <b>forms(Forms,</b> <b>Options)</b> <b>-&gt;</b> <b>CompRet</b>

              Types:

                 Forms = forms()
                 forms() = [erl_parse:abstract_form] | cerl:c_module()
                 Options = [option()]
                 CompRet = BinRet | ErrRet
                 BinRet = {ok,ModuleName,BinaryOrCode} | {ok,ModuleName,BinaryOrCode,Warnings}
                 ModuleName = module()
                 BinaryOrCode = binary() | term()
                 ErrRet = error | {error,Errors,Warnings}
                 Warnings = Errors = [{file:filename(), [{erl_anno:location() | 'none', module(), term()}]}]

              Analogous to <u>file/1</u>, but takes a list of forms (in either Erlang abstract or  Core  Erlang  format
              representation)  as  first  argument.  Option  <u>binary</u> is implicit, that is, no object code file is
              produced. For options that normally produce a listing file, such as 'E', the internal  format  for
              that compiler pass (an Erlang term, usually not a binary) is returned instead of a binary.

       <b>format_error(ErrorDescriptor)</b> <b>-&gt;</b> <b>chars()</b>

              Types:

                 ErrorDescriptor = errordesc()

              Uses  an  <u>ErrorDescriptor</u>  and  returns  a  deep list of characters that describes the error. This
              function is usually called implicitly when an <u>ErrorInfo</u>  structure  (described  in  section  Error
              Information) is processed.

       <b>output_generated(Options)</b> <b>-&gt;</b> <b>true</b> <b>|</b> <b>false</b>

              Types:

                 Options = [term()]

              Determines  whether  the  compiler generates a <u>beam</u> file with the given options. <u>true</u> means that a
              <u>beam</u> file is generated. <u>false</u> means that the compiler  generates  some  listing  file,  returns  a
              binary, or merely checks the syntax of the source code.

       <b>noenv_file(File,</b> <b>Options)</b> <b>-&gt;</b> <b>CompRet</b>

              Works like file/2, except that the environment variable <u>ERL_COMPILER_OPTIONS</u> is not consulted.

       <b>noenv_forms(Forms,</b> <b>Options)</b> <b>-&gt;</b> <b>CompRet</b>

              Works like forms/2, except that the environment variable <u>ERL_COMPILER_OPTIONS</u> is not consulted.

       <b>noenv_output_generated(Options)</b> <b>-&gt;</b> <b>true</b> <b>|</b> <b>false</b>

              Types:

                 Options = [term()]

              Works  like  output_generated/1,  except that the environment variable <u>ERL_COMPILER_OPTIONS</u> is not
              consulted.

</pre><h4><b>DEFAULT</b> <b>COMPILER</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The (host operating system) environment  variable  <u>ERL_COMPILER_OPTIONS</u>  can  be  used  to  give  default
       compiler  options. Its value must be a valid Erlang term. If the value is a list, it is used as is. If it
       is not a list, it is put into a list.

       The list is appended to any options given to file/2, forms/2, and output_generated/2. Use the alternative
       functions noenv_file/2, noenv_forms/2, or noenv_output_generated/2 if you do  not  want  the  environment
       variable  to  be  consulted, for example, if you are calling the compiler recursively from inside a parse
       transform.

       The list can be retrieved with env_compiler_options/0.

</pre><h4><b>INLINING</b></h4><pre>
       The compiler can do function inlining within an Erlang module. Inlining means that a call to  a  function
       is  replaced with the function body with the arguments replaced with the actual values. The semantics are
       preserved, except if exceptions are generated in the inlined code. Exceptions are reported  as  occurring
       in  the  function  the  body  was inlined into. Also, <u>function_clause</u> exceptions are converted to similar
       <u>case_clause</u> exceptions.

       When a function is inlined, the original function is kept if it is exported (either by an explicit export
       or if the option <u>export_all</u> was given) or if not all calls to the function are inlined.

       Inlining does not necessarily improve running time. For example, inlining can increase  Beam  stack  use,
       which probably is detrimental to performance for recursive functions.

       Inlining is never default. It must be explicitly enabled with a compiler option or a <u>-compile()</u> attribute
       in the source module.

       To enable inlining, either use the option <u>inline</u> to let the compiler decide which functions to inline, or
       <u>{inline,[{Name,Arity},...]}</u>  to  have the compiler inline all calls to the given functions. If the option
       is given inside a <u>compile</u> directive in an Erlang module, <u>{Name,Arity}</u> can be written as <u>Name/Arity</u>.

       Example of explicit inlining:

       -compile({inline,[pi/0]}).

       pi() -&gt; 3.1416.

       Example of implicit inlining:

       -compile(inline).

       The option <u>{inline_size,Size}</u> controls how large functions that are allowed to be inlined. Default is <u>24</u>,
       which keeps the size of the inlined code roughly the same as  the  un-inlined  version  (only  relatively
       small functions are inlined).

       Example:

       %% Aggressive inlining - will increase code size.
       -compile(inline).
       -compile({inline_size,100}).

</pre><h4><b>INLINING</b> <b>OF</b> <b>LIST</b> <b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The compiler can also inline various list manipulation functions from the module <u>list</u> in STDLIB.

       This  feature  must  be explicitly enabled with a compiler option or a <u>-compile()</u> attribute in the source
       module.

       To enable inlining of list functions, use option <u>inline_list_funcs</u>.

       The following functions are inlined:

         * lists:all/2

         * lists:any/2

         * lists:foreach/2

         * lists:map/2

         * lists:flatmap/2

         * lists:filter/2

         * lists:foldl/3

         * lists:foldr/3

         * lists:mapfoldl/3

         * lists:mapfoldr/3

</pre><h4><b>PARSE</b> <b>TRANSFORMATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Parse transformations are used when a programmer wants to use Erlang syntax but with different semantics.
       The original Erlang code is then transformed into other Erlang code.

       See <a href="../man3erl/erl_id_trans.3erl.html">erl_id_trans</a>(3erl) for an example and an explanation of the function <u>parse_transform_info/0</u>.

</pre><h4><b>ERROR</b> <b>INFORMATION</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>ErrorInfo</u> mentioned earlier is the standard <u>ErrorInfo</u> structure,  which  is  returned  from  all  I/O
       modules. It has the following format:

       {ErrorLocation, Module, ErrorDescriptor}

       <u>ErrorLocation</u>  is  the atom <u>none</u> if the error does not correspond to a specific location, for example, if
       the source file does not exist.

       A string describing the error is obtained with the following call:

       Module:format_error(ErrorDescriptor)
