</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       HTML::Mason::Compiler::ToObject - A Compiler subclass that generates Mason object code

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         my $compiler = HTML::Mason::Compiler::ToObject-&gt;new;

         my $object_code =
             $compiler-&gt;compile( comp_source =&gt; $source,
                                 name        =&gt; $comp_name,
                                 comp_path   =&gt; $comp_path,
                               );

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This Compiler subclass generates Mason object code (Perl code).  It is the default Compiler class used by
       Mason.

</pre><h4><b>PARAMETERS</b> <b>TO</b> <b>THE</b> <b>new()</b> <b>CONSTRUCTOR</b></h4><pre>
       All of these parameters are optional.

       comp_class
           The class into which component objects are blessed.  This defaults to HTML::Mason::Component.

       subcomp_class
           The    class    into    which    subcomponent    objects    are    blessed.     This    defaults   to
           HTML::Mason::Component::Subcomponent.

       in_package
           This is the package in which a component's code is executed.  For historical reasons,  this  defaults
           to "HTML::Mason::Commands".

       preamble
           Text  given  for this parameter is placed at the beginning of each component, but after the execution
           of any "&lt;%once&gt;" block. See also postamble. The request will be available as $m in preamble code.

       postamble
           Text given for this parameter is placed at the end of each component. See also preamble.  The request
           will be available as $m in postamble code.

       use_strict
           True or false, default is true. Indicates whether or not a given component should "use strict".

       use_warnings
           True or false, default is false. Indicates whether or not a given component should "use warnings".

       named_component_subs
           When compiling a component, use uniquely named subroutines for the a component's body, subcomponents,
           and methods. Doing this allows you  to  effectively  profile  Mason  components.  Without  this,  all
           components simply show up as __ANON__ or something similar in the profiler.

       define_args_hash
           One  of  "always",  "auto",  or  "never".  This determines whether or not an %ARGS hash is created in
           components.  If it is set to "always", one is always  defined.   If  set  to  "never",  it  is  never
           defined.

           The  default,  "auto",  will cause the hash to be defined only if some part of the component contains
           the string "ARGS".  This is somewhat crude, and may result in  some  false  positives,  but  this  is
           preferable to false negatives.

           Not defining the args hash means that we can avoid copying component arguments, which can save memory
           and slightly improve execution speed.

</pre><h4><b>ACCESSOR</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       All  of  the  above  properties  have  read-only accessor methods of the same name. You cannot change any
       property of a compiler after it has been created (but you can create multiple  compilers  with  different
       properties).

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       This class is primarily meant to be used by the Interpreter object, and as such has a very limited public
       API.

       compile(...)
           This  method  will  take  component  source  and return the compiled object code for that source. See
           "compile(...)" in HTML::Mason::Compiler for details on this method.

           This subclass also accepts a "comp_class" parameter, allowing you to override the  class  into  which
           the component is compiled.
