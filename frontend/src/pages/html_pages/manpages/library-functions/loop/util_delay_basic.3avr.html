       util_delay_basic - &lt;util/delay_basic.h&gt;: Basic busy-wait delay loops

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Functions</b>
       void <b>_delay_loop_1</b> (<b>uint8_t</b> __count)
       void <b>_delay_loop_2</b> (<b>uint16_t</b> __count)

</pre><h4><b>Detailed</b> <b>Description</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;util/delay_basic.h&gt;

       The functions in this header file implement simple delay loops that perform a busy-waiting. They are
       typically used to facilitate short delays in the program execution. They are implemented as count-down
       loops with a well-known CPU cycle count per loop iteration. As such, no other processing can occur
       simultaneously. It should be kept in mind that the functions described here do not disable interrupts.

       In general, for long delays, the use of hardware timers is much preferrable, as they free the CPU, and
       allow for concurrent processing of other events while the timer is running. However, in particular for
       very short delays, the overhead of setting up a hardware timer is too much compared to the overall delay
       time.

       Two inline functions are provided for the actual delay algorithms.

</pre><h4><b>Function</b> <b>Documentation</b></h4><pre>
   <b>void</b> <b>_delay_loop_1</b> <b>(uint8_t</b> <b>__count)</b>
       Delay loop using an 8-bit counter __count, so up to 256 iterations are possible. (The value 256 would
       have to be passed as 0.) The loop executes three CPU cycles per iteration, not including the overhead the
       compiler needs to setup the counter register.

       Thus, at a CPU speed of 1 MHz, delays of up to 768 microseconds can be achieved.

   <b>void</b> <b>_delay_loop_2</b> <b>(uint16_t</b> <b>__count)</b>
       Delay loop using a 16-bit counter __count, so up to 65536 iterations are possible. (The value 65536 would
       have to be passed as 0.) The loop executes four CPU cycles per iteration, not including the overhead the
       compiler requires to setup the counter register pair.

       Thus, at a CPU speed of 1 MHz, delays of up to about 262.1 milliseconds can be achieved.
