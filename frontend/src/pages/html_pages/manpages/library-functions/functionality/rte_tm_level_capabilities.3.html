   <b>uint32_t</b> <b>sched_n_children_max</b>
       Maximum number of children nodes. This parameter indicates that there is at least one non-leaf node on
       this level that can be configured with this many children nodes, which might not be true for all the non-
       leaf nodes on this level.

       Definition at line <b>581</b> of file <b>rte_tm.h</b>.

   <b>uint32_t</b> <b>sched_sp_n_priorities_max</b>
       Maximum number of supported priority levels. This parameter indicates that there is at least one non-leaf
       node on this level that can be configured with this many priority levels for managing its children nodes,
       which might not be true for all the non-leaf nodes on this level. The value of zero is invalid. The value
       of 1 indicates that only priority 0 is supported, which essentially means that Strict Priority (SP)
       algorithm is not supported on this level.

       Definition at line <b>594</b> of file <b>rte_tm.h</b>.

   <b>uint32_t</b> <b>sched_wfq_n_children_per_group_max</b>
       Maximum number of sibling nodes that can have the same priority at any given time, i.e. maximum size of
       the WFQ sibling node group. This parameter indicates there is at least one non-leaf node on this level
       that meets this condition, which may not be true for all the non-leaf nodes on this level. The value of
       zero is invalid. The value of 1 indicates that WFQ algorithm is not supported on this level. The maximum
       value is <u>sched_n_children_max</u>.

   <b>uint32_t</b> <b>sched_wfq_n_groups_max</b>
       Maximum number of priority levels that can have more than one child node at any given time, i.e. maximum
       number of WFQ sibling node groups that have two or more members. This parameter indicates there is at
       least one non-leaf node on this level that meets this condition, which might not be true for all the non-
       leaf nodes. The value of zero states that WFQ algorithm is not supported on this level. The value of 1
       indicates that (<u>sched_sp_n_priorities_max</u> - 1) priority levels on this level have at most one child node,
       so there can be only one priority level with two or more sibling nodes making up a WFQ group on this
       level. The maximum value is: min(floor(<u>sched_n_children_max</u> / 2), <u>sched_sp_n_priorities_max</u>).

       Definition at line <b>625</b> of file <b>rte_tm.h</b>.

   <b>uint32_t</b> <b>sched_wfq_weight_max</b>
       Maximum WFQ weight. The value of 1 indicates that all sibling nodes on this level with same priority have
       the same WFQ weight, so on this level WFQ is reduced to FQ.

       Definition at line <b>632</b> of file <b>rte_tm.h</b>.

   <b>int</b> <b>sched_wfq_packet_mode_supported</b>
       WFQ packet mode supported. When non-zero, this parameter indicates that there is at least one non-leaf

       WRED packet mode support. When non-zero, this parameter indicates that there is at least one leaf node on
       this level that supports the WRED packet mode, which might not be true for all the leaf nodes. In packet
       mode, the WRED thresholds specify the queue length in packets, as opposed to bytes.
