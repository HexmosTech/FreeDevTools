</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       PCMEQU - Draws characters of "medium quality". It does this by drawing lines, just as PCHIQU does, but it
       does not produce quite such fancy characters. No function codes may be used. Using PCMEQU to draw a given
       string of characters will create a larger metafile than if PCLOQU were used, which may be a disadvantage.
       However, it may also be more dependable, in that it does not depend on capabilities the translator may or
       may not have.

       PLCHMQ is an alternate name for the routine PCMEQU.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       CALL PCMEQU (XPOS,YPOS,CHRS,SIZE,ANGD,CNTR)

</pre><h4><b>C-BINDING</b> <b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;ncarg/ncargC.h&gt;

       void c_pcmequ (float xpos, float ypos, char *chrs,
       float size, float angd, float cntr)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       XPOS,YPOS   (input  expressions  of  type  REAL) specify positioning coordinates for the characters to be
                   drawn. If the internal parameter ´MA´ has the value 0, these are given in  the  current  user
                   coordinate  system;  otherwise,  they  are  given  in  an arbitrary X/Y coordinate system, as
                   implied by the value of ´MA´ and the nature of the routine CPMPXY. (For example, if ´MA´  has
                   the  value  1  and  the default version of CPMPXY is being used, then XPOS is a longitude, in
                   degrees, and YPOS is a latitude, in degrees.)  The argument CNTR (described below)  specifies
                   how the characters are to be positioned relative to the point (XPOS,YPOS).

       CHRS        (an  input  constant  or variable of type CHARACTER) contains a character string to be drawn.
                   The number of characters in CHRS is taken to be LEN(CHRS); to use characters "m" through  "n"
                   from a character variable CHRS, use the FORTRAN-77 substring notation "CHRS(m:n)". The string
                   may  include  any  of  the  95 characters space, exclamation point, double quote, pound sign,
                   dollar sign, percent  sign,  ampersand,  apostrophe,  left  parenthesis,  right  parenthesis,
                   asterisk,  plus  sign,  comma,  minus  sign, period, slash, 0-9, colon, semi-colon, less than
                   sign, equals sign, greater than sign, question mark,  at  sign,  A-Z,  left  square  bracket,
                   backslash,  right  square bracket, hat, underscore, backwards quote, a-z, left curly bracket,
                   vertical bar, right curly bracket, and tilde. Function codes, like those in calls to  PCHIQU,
                   may not be used.

       SIZE        (an  input  expression  of  type  REAL) specifies the desired character size. If the internal
                   parameter ´MA´ is zero, then the following comments apply:

                   •      If SIZE is less than or equal to zero, its absolute value  specifies  the  size  as  a
                          multiple of a default digitized size on a 1024x1024 grid, on which blanks are 16 units
                          wide.

                   •      If  SIZE  is greater than zero, but less than one, it specifies the desired width of a
                          blank as a fraction of the distance across the plotter frame. This is the  recommended
                          scheme.

                   •      If  SIZE is greater than or equal to one, it specifies the desired width of a blank in
                          plotter coordinates, as defined by default or by a user´s call  to  the  SPPS  routine
                          SETI.  Note that use of the routine SETI is now discouraged.

                   If  ´MA´  is  nonzero,  then  SIZE  is  the  desired  width  of a blank as a value in the X/Y
                   coordinate system in which XPOS and YPOS are given.

                   Capital letters are 4/6 as wide as a blank and, by default, 7/4 as high as they are wide (the
                   internal parameter ´HW´ may be used to change the latter value). The distance from the center
                   of each character to the center of the next is constant and is equal to one blank width.

                   Note that, if the desired character height ("h") is known, one should use SIZE = (6/7) * h.

                   SIZE is defined in such a way as to be consistent with PCHIQU. If one changes a "CALL PCHIQU"
                   to a "CALL PCMEQU" (assuming that no function codes are used in the string, of  course),  the
                   results  will  be  much the same, but the length of the string will be different. If one uses
                   SIZE less than zero and one has reset the PCHIQU internal parameter ´PW´ to  something  other
                   than 16, the difference in the output of the two routines will be greater.

       ANGD        (an  input  expression  of  type  REAL)  is  the  angle, in degrees counterclockwise from the
                   positive X axis, at which the character string is to be written.

       CNTR        (an input expression of type REAL) is the centering option, as follows:

                   •      CNTR = -1. means that (XPOS,YPOS) is  the  center  of  the  left  edge  of  the  first
                          character.

                   •      CNTR  =  1.  means  that  (XPOS,YPOS)  is  the  center  of  the right edge of the last
                          character.

                   •      CNTR = s means that (XPOS,YPOS) is a point obtained by linear interpolation along  the
                          line joining the two points mentioned above (the first point being associated with the
                          value  -1 and the second with the value +1). The value "0."  gives the midpoint of the
                          line.

                   Upon return from PCMEQU, all arguments are unchanged.
