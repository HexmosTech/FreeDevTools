</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       ungetwc — push wide-character code back into the input stream

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/stdio.h">stdio.h</a>&gt;
       #include &lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/wchar.h">wchar.h</a>&gt;

       wint_t ungetwc(wint_t <u>wc</u>, FILE *<u>stream</u>);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  functionality  described  on  this  reference  page is aligned with the ISO C standard. Any conflict
       between the requirements described  here  and  the  ISO C  standard  is  unintentional.  This  volume  of
       POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO C standard.

       The  <u>ungetwc</u>() function shall push the character corresponding to the wide-character code specified by <u>wc</u>
       back onto the input stream pointed to by  <u>stream</u>.   The  pushed-back  characters  shall  be  returned  by
       subsequent  reads  on  that  stream  in the reverse order of their pushing. A successful intervening call
       (with the stream pointed to by <u>stream</u>) to a file-positioning function (<u>fseek</u>(), <u>fseeko</u>(),  <u>fsetpos</u>(),  or
       <u>rewind</u>())  or  <u>fflush</u>()  shall  discard  any  pushed-back characters for the stream. The external storage
       corresponding to the stream is unchanged.

       At least one character of push-back shall be provided. If <u>ungetwc</u>() is called too many times on the  same
       stream without an intervening read or file-positioning operation on that stream, the operation may fail.

       If  the value of <u>wc</u> equals that of the macro WEOF, the operation shall fail and the input stream shall be
       left unchanged.

       A successful call to <u>ungetwc</u>() shall clear the end-of-file indicator for the stream.  The  value  of  the
       file-position  indicator  for the stream after all pushed-back characters have been read, or discarded by
       calling <u>fseek</u>(), <u>fseeko</u>(), <u>fsetpos</u>(), or <u>rewind</u>() (but not <u>fflush</u>()), shall be the same as it was  before
       the  characters  were  pushed  back.  The file-position indicator is decremented (by one or more) by each
       successful call to <u>ungetwc</u>(); if its value was 0 before a call, its value is unspecified after the call.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       Upon successful completion, <u>ungetwc</u>() shall return the wide-character code corresponding to  the  pushed-
       back character. Otherwise, it shall return WEOF.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>ungetwc</u>() function may fail if:

       <b>EILSEQ</b> An invalid character sequence is detected, or a wide-character code does not correspond to a valid
              character.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>
