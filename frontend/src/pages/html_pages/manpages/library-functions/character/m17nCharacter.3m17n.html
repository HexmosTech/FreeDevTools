</pre><h4><b>Detailed</b> <b>Description</b></h4><pre>
       Character objects and API for them.

       The m17n library represents a <u>character</u> by a character code (an integer). The minimum character code is
       0. The maximum character code is defined by the macro <b>MCHAR_MAX</b>. It is assured that <b>MCHAR_MAX</b> is not
       smaller than 0x3FFFFF (22 bits).

       Characters 0 to 0x10FFFF are equivalent to the Unicode characters of the same code values.

       A character can have zero or more properties called <u>character</u> <u>properties</u>. A character property consists
       of a <u>key</u> and a <u>value</u>, where key is a symbol and value is anything that can be cast to (void *). 'The
       character property that belongs to character C and whose key is K' may be shortened to 'the K property of
       C'.

</pre><h4><b>Macro</b> <b>Definition</b> <b>Documentation</b></h4><pre>
   <b>#define</b> <b>MCHAR_MAX</b>
       Maximum character code. The macro <b>MCHAR_MAX</b> gives the maximum character code.

</pre><h4><b>Variable</b> <b>Documentation</b></h4><pre>
   <b>MSymbol</b> <b>Mscript</b>
       Key for script. The symbol <b>Mscript</b> has the name 'script' and is used as the key of a character property.
       The value of such a property is a symbol representing the script to which the character belongs.

       Each symbol that represents a script has one of the names listed in the <u>Unicode</u> <u>Technical</u> <u>Report</u> <u>#24</u>.

   <b>MSymbol</b> <b>Mname</b>
       Key for character name. The symbol <b>Mname</b> has the name 'name' and is used as the key of a character
       property. The value of such a property is a C-string representing the name of the character.

   <b>MSymbol</b> <b>Mcategory</b>
       Key for general category. The symbol <b>Mcategory</b> has the name 'category' and is used as the key of a
       character property. The value of such a property is a symbol representing the <u>general</u> <u>category</u> of the
       character.

       Each symbol that represents a general category has one of the names listed as abbreviations for <u>General</u>
       <u>Category</u> in Unicode.

   <b>MSymbol</b> <b>Mcombining_class</b>
       Key for canonical combining class. The symbol <b>Mcombining_class</b> has the name 'combining-class' and is used
       as the key of a character property. The value of such a property is an integer that represents the
       <u>canonical</u> <u>combining</u> <u>class</u> of the character.

       The meaning of each integer that represents a canonical combining class is identical to the one defined
       in Unicode.

   <b>MSymbol</b> <b>Mbidi_category</b>
       Key for bidi category. The symbol <b>Mbidi_category</b> has the name 'bidi-category' and is used as the key of a
       character property. The value of such a property is a symbol that represents the <u>bidirectional</u> <u>category</u>
       of the character.

       Each symbol that represents a bidirectional category has one of the names listed as types of
       <u>Bidirectional</u> <u>Category</u> in Unicode.

   <b>MSymbol</b> <b>Msimple_case_folding</b>
       Key for corresponding single lowercase character. The symbol <b>Msimple_case_folding</b> has the name
       'simple-case-folding' and is used as the key of a character property. The value of such a property is the
       corresponding single lowercase character that is used when comparing M-texts ignoring cases.

       If a character requires a complicated comparison (i.e. cannot be compared by simply mapping to another
       single character), the value of such a property is 0xFFFF. In this case, the character has another
       property whose key is <b>Mcomplicated_case_folding</b>.

   <b>MSymbol</b> <b>Mcomplicated_case_folding</b>
       Key for corresponding multiple lowercase characters. The symbol <b>Mcomplicated_case_folding</b> has the name
       'complicated-case-folding' and is used as the key of a character property. The value of such a property
       is the corresponding M-text that contains a sequence of lowercase characters to be used for comparing
       M-texts ignoring case.

   <b>MSymbol</b> <b>Mcased</b>
       Key for values used in case operation. The symbol <b>Mcased</b> has the name 'cased' and is used as the key of
       charater property. The value of such a property is an integer value 1, 2, or 3 representing 'cased',
       'case-ignorable', and both of them respective. See the Unicode Standard 5.0 (Section 3.13 Default Case
       Algorithm) for the detail.

   <b>MSymbol</b> <b>Msoft_dotted</b>
       Key for values used in case operation. The symbol <b>Msoft_dotted</b> has the name 'soft-dotted' and is used as
       the key of charater property. The value of such a property is <b>Mt</b> if a character has 'Soft_Dotted'
       property, and <b>Mnil</b> otherwise. See the Unicode Standard 5.0 (Section 3.13 Default Case Algorithm) for the
       detail.

   <b>MSymbol</b> <b>Mcase_mapping</b>
       Key for values used in case operation. The symbol <b>Mcase_mapping</b> has the name 'case-mapping' and is used
       as the key of charater property. The value of such a property is a plist of three M-Texts; lower, title,
       and upper of the corresponding character. See the Unicode Standard 5.0 (Section 5.18 Case Mappings) for
       the detail.

   <b>MSymbol</b> <b>Mblock</b>
       Key for script block name. The symbol <b>Mblock</b> the name 'block' and is used as the key of charater
       property. The value of such a property is a symbol representing a script block of the corresponding
       character.
