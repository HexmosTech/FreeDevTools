</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       fgetwc — get a wide-character code from a stream

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/stdio.h">stdio.h</a>&gt;
       #include &lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/wchar.h">wchar.h</a>&gt;

       wint_t fgetwc(FILE *<u>stream</u>);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  functionality  described  on  this  reference  page is aligned with the ISO C standard. Any conflict
       between the requirements described  here  and  the  ISO C  standard  is  unintentional.  This  volume  of
       POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO C standard.

       The  <u>fgetwc</u>()  function  shall obtain the next character (if present) from the input stream pointed to by
       <u>stream</u>, convert that to the corresponding wide-character code, and advance the associated  file  position
       indicator for the stream (if defined).

       If an error occurs, the resulting value of the file position indicator for the stream is unspecified.

       The  <u>fgetwc</u>()  function  may  mark  the last data access timestamp of the file associated with <u>stream</u> for
       update. The last data access timestamp shall be marked for update by the first  successful  execution  of
       <u>fgetwc</u>(),  <u>fgetws</u>(), <u>fwscanf</u>(), <u>getwc</u>(), <u>getwchar</u>(), <u>vfwscanf</u>(), <u>vwscanf</u>(), or <u>wscanf</u>() using <u>stream</u> that
       returns data not supplied by a prior call to <u>ungetwc</u>().

       The <u>fgetwc</u>() function shall not change the setting of <u>errno</u> if successful.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       Upon successful completion, the <u>fgetwc</u>() function shall return the wide-character code of  the  character
       read from the input stream pointed to by <u>stream</u> converted to a type <b>wint_t</b>.  If the end-of-file indicator
       for the stream is set, or if the stream is at end-of-file, the end-of-file indicator for the stream shall
       be  set  and <u>fgetwc</u>() shall return WEOF. If a read error occurs, the error indicator for the stream shall
       be set, <u>fgetwc</u>() shall return WEOF, and shall set <u>errno</u> to indicate the  error.   If  an  encoding  error
       occurs,  the error indicator for the stream shall be set, <u>fgetwc</u>() shall return WEOF, and shall set <u>errno</u>
       to indicate the error.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>fgetwc</u>() function shall fail if data needs to be read and:

       <b>EAGAIN</b> The O_NONBLOCK flag is set for the file descriptor underlying  <u>stream</u>  and  the  thread  would  be
              delayed in the <u>fgetwc</u>() operation.

       <b>EBADF</b>  The file descriptor underlying <u>stream</u> is not a valid file descriptor open for reading.

       <b>EILSEQ</b> The data obtained from the input stream does not form a valid character.

       <b>EINTR</b>  The read operation was terminated due to the receipt of a signal, and no data was transferred.

       <b>EIO</b>    A  physical  I/O error has occurred, or the process is in a background process group attempting to
              read from its controlling terminal, and either the calling  thread  is  blocking  SIGTTIN  or  the
              process  is ignoring SIGTTIN or the process group of the process is orphaned.  This error may also
              be generated for implementation-defined reasons.

       <b>EOVERFLOW</b>
              The file is a regular file and an attempt was made  to  read  at  or  beyond  the  offset  maximum
              associated with the corresponding stream.

       The <u>fgetwc</u>() function may fail if:

       <b>ENOMEM</b> Insufficient storage space is available.

       <b>ENXIO</b>  A  request  was  made  of a nonexistent device, or the request was outside the capabilities of the
              device.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>ferror</u>() or <u>feof</u>() functions must be used to distinguish between an error condition  and  an  end-of-
       file condition.

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>FUTURE</b> <b>DIRECTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       None.
