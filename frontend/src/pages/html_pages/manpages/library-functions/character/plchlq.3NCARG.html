</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       PCLOQU - Draws characters of "low quality" by calling the GKS character-drawing routines. No function
       codes may be used.  Using PCLOQU to draw a given string of characters will create a smaller metafile than
       if PCHIQU or PCMEQU were used; the results will depend on capabilities of the translator.

       PLCHLQ is an alternate name for the routine PCLOQU.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       CALL PCLOQU (XPOS,YPOS,CHRS,SIZE,ANGD,CNTR)

</pre><h4><b>C-BINDING</b> <b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;ncarg/ncargC.h&gt;

       void c_pcloqu (float xpos, float ypos, char *chrs,
       float size, float angd, float cntr)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       XPOS,YPOS   (input  expressions  of  type  REAL) specify positioning coordinates for the characters to be
                   drawn. If the internal parameter ´MA´ has the value 0, these are given in  the  current  user
                   coordinate  system;  otherwise,  they  are  given  in  an arbitrary X/Y coordinate system, as
                   implied by the value of ´MA´ and the nature of the routine CPMPXY. (For example, if ´MA´  has
                   the  value  1  and  the default version of CPMPXY is being used, then XPOS is a longitude, in
                   degrees, and YPOS is a latitude, in degrees.)  The argument CNTR (described below)  specifies
                   how the characters are to be positioned relative to the point (XPOS,YPOS).

       CHRS        (an  input  constant  or variable of type CHARACTER) contains a character string to be drawn.
                   The number of characters in CHRS is taken to be LEN(CHRS); to use characters "m" through  "n"
                   from a character variable CHRS, use the FORTRAN-77 substring notation "CHRS(m:n)". The string
                   may  include  any  of  the  95 characters space, exclamation point, double quote, pound sign,
                   dollar sign, percent  sign,  ampersand,  apostrophe,  left  parenthesis,  right  parenthesis,
                   asterisk,  plus  sign,  comma,  minus  sign, period, slash, 0-9, colon, semi-colon, less than
                   sign, equals sign, greater than sign, question mark,  at  sign,  A-Z,  left  square  bracket,
                   backslash,  right  square bracket, hat, underscore, backwards quote, a-z, left curly bracket,
                   vertical bar, right curly bracket, and tilde. Function codes, like those in calls to  PCHIQU,
                   may not be used.

       SIZE        (an  input  expression  of  type  REAL) specifies the desired character size. If the internal
                   parameter ´MA´ is zero, then the following comments apply:

                   •      If SIZE is less than or equal to zero, its absolute value  specifies  the  size  as  a
                          multiple of a default digitized size on a 1024x1024 grid, on which blanks are 16 units
                          wide.

                   •      If  SIZE  is greater than zero, but less than one, it specifies the desired width of a
                          blank as a fraction of the distance across the plotter frame. This is the  recommended
                          scheme.

                   •      If  SIZE is greater than or equal to one, it specifies the desired width of a blank in
                          plotter coordinates, as defined by default or by a user´s call  to  the  SPPS  routine
                          SETI.  Note that use of the routine SETI is now discouraged.

                   If  ´MA´  is  nonzero,  then  SIZE  is  the  desired  width  of a blank as a value in the X/Y
                   coordinate system in which XPOS and YPOS are given.

                   Note that SIZE is defined in such a way as to be consistent with PCHIQU.

       ANGD        (an input expression of type REAL)  is  the  angle,  in  degrees  counterclockwise  from  the
                   positive X axis, at which the character string is to be written.

       CNTR        (an input expression of type REAL) is the centering option, as follows:

                   •      CNTR  &lt;  0.  means  that  (XPOS,YPOS)  is  the  center  of  the left edge of the first
                          character.

                   •      CNTR &gt; 0. means that (XPOS,YPOS)  is  the  center  of  the  right  edge  of  the  last
                          character.

                   •      CNTR = 0. means that (XPOS,YPOS) is the midpoint of the string.

                   Note  that this argument is not quite the same as that for PCHIQU (though it does include the
                   three most useful cases).

                   Upon return from PCLOQU, all arguments are unchanged.

</pre><h4><b>C-BINDING</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
