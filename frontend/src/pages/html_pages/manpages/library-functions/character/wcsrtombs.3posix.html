</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       wcsnrtombs, wcsrtombs — convert a wide-character string to a character string (restartable)

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/wchar.h">wchar.h</a>&gt;

       size_t wcsnrtombs(char *restrict <u>dst</u>, const wchar_t **restrict <u>src</u>,
           size_t <u>nwc</u>, size_t <u>len</u>, mbstate_t *restrict <u>ps</u>);
       size_t wcsrtombs(char *restrict <u>dst</u>, const wchar_t **restrict <u>src</u>,
           size_t <u>len</u>, mbstate_t *restrict <u>ps</u>);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       For  <u>wcsrtombs</u>():  The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the ISO C standard.
       Any conflict between the requirements described here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This volume
       of POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO C standard.

       The <u>wcsrtombs</u>() function shall convert a sequence of wide characters from the array indirectly pointed to
       by <u>src</u> into a sequence of corresponding characters, beginning in the conversion state  described  by  the
       object  pointed  to  by  <u>ps</u>.  If <u>dst</u> is not a null pointer, the converted characters shall then be stored
       into the array pointed to by <u>dst</u>.  Conversion continues up to  and  including  a  terminating  null  wide
       character, which shall also be stored. Conversion shall stop earlier in the following cases:

        *  When a code is reached that does not correspond to a valid character

        *  When  the  next character would exceed the limit of <u>len</u> total bytes to be stored in the array pointed
           to by <u>dst</u> (and <u>dst</u> is not a null pointer)

       Each conversion shall take place as if by a call to the <u>wcrtomb</u>() function.

       If <u>dst</u> is not a null pointer, the pointer object pointed to by  <u>src</u>  shall  be  assigned  either  a  null
       pointer  (if  conversion  stopped  due to reaching a terminating null wide character) or the address just
       past the last wide character converted (if any). If conversion stopped due to reaching a terminating null
       wide character, the resulting state described shall be the initial conversion state.

       If <u>ps</u> is a null pointer, the <u>wcsrtombs</u>() function shall use its own internal <b>mbstate_t</b> object,  which  is
       initialized  at program start-up to the initial conversion state. Otherwise, the <b>mbstate_t</b> object pointed
       to by <u>ps</u> shall be used to completely describe the current conversion state of  the  associated  character
       sequence.

       The <u>wcsnrtombs</u>() and <u>wcsrtombs</u>() functions need not be thread-safe if called with a NULL <u>ps</u> argument.

       The  <u>wcsnrtombs</u>() function shall be equivalent to the <u>wcsrtombs</u>() function, except that the conversion is
       limited to the first <u>nwc</u> wide characters.

       The <u>wcsrtombs</u>() function shall not change the setting of <u>errno</u> if successful.

       The behavior of these functions shall be affected by the <u>LC_CTYPE</u> category of the current locale.

       The implementation shall behave as if no function defined in System  Interfaces  volume  of  POSIX.1‐2017
       calls these functions.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       If  conversion stops because a code is reached that does not correspond to a valid character, an encoding
       error occurs. In this case, these functions shall store the value of the  macro  <b>[EILSEQ]</b>  in  <u>errno</u>  and
       return (<b>size_t</b>)-1; the conversion state is undefined.  Otherwise, these functions shall return the number
       of bytes in the resulting character sequence, not including the terminating null (if any).

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       These functions shall fail if:

       <b>EILSEQ</b> A wide-character code does not correspond to a valid character.

       These functions may fail if:

       <b>EINVAL</b> <u>ps</u> points to an object that contains an invalid conversion state.
