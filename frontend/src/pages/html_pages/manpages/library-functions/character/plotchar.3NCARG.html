</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Plotchar - Allows a user to draw characters of high, medium, or low quality.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       PCHIQU (or PLCHHQ) - Draws high quality characters. By default, it uses the same database as the old NCAR
       Graphics routine PWRITX, but it can also use characters from any of the fontcap-defined databases, it has
       an improved interface, and it has many more capabilities than PWRITX.

       PCMEQU (or PLCHMQ) - Draws characters of "medium quality". It does this by drawing lines, just as PCHIQU
       does, but it does not produce quite such fancy characters. No function codes may be used. Using PCMEQU to
       draw a given string of characters will create a larger metafile than if PCLOQU were used, which may be a
       disadvantage. However, it may also be more dependable, in that it does not depend on capabilities the
       translator may or may not have.

       PCLOQU (or PLCHLQ) - Draws characters of "low quality" by calling the GKS character-drawing routines. No
       function codes may be used.  Using PCLOQU to draw a given string of characters will create a smaller
       metafile than if PCHIQU or PCMEQU were used; the results will depend on capabilities of the translator.

       PCGETC - Retrieves the character value of a specified internal parameter.

       PCGETI - Retrieves the integer value of a specified internal parameter.

       PCGETR - Retrieves the real value of a specified internal parameter.  PCRSET - Resets the values of all
       internal parameters to the default state.

       PCSETC - Gives a new character value to a specified internal parameter.

       PCSETI - Gives a new integer value to a specified internal parameter.

       PCSETR - Gives a new real value to a specified internal parameter.

       PCPNWI - A function of type CHARACTER*16 that, given the name of an internal parameter array and an
       index, has as its value the name of the specified element of the internal parameter array.

       PCDLSC - Defines the default list of "special colors" used by PCHIQU in drawing certain characters from
       the filled fonts.  Such a call will define color indices IFCI, IFCI+1, IFCI+2, . . . , IFCI+15 and it
       will set all elements of the internal parameter array ´CC´ corresponding to indices 1 through 16. At the
       moment, although such a call does define a set of sixteen colors (ranging from blue to red) and set the
       elements of ´CC´, it´s a bit pointless, since there are no characters for which the special colors are
       used. In the future, there will be a few such (like the state highway symbol, which is normally drawn in
       a particular pair of colors); at that time, the routine will be of more use.

       PLCHHQ - An alternate name for the routine PCHIQU.

       PLCHMQ - An alternate name for the routine PCMEQU.

       PLCHLQ - An alternate name for the routine PCLOQU.

</pre><h4><b>USER-MODIFIABLE</b> <b>INTERNAL</b> <b>ROUTINES</b></h4><pre>
       PCMPXY - This routine is normally not called directly by the user (though it can be). It is called by
       PCHIQU and by PCMEQU when the user has set the mapping flag ´MA´ nonzero to request mapping of characters
       from one X/Y coordinate system to another.

</pre><h4><b>ACCESS</b></h4><pre>
       To use Plotchar routines, load the NCAR Graphics libraries ncarg, ncarg_gks, and ncarg_c, preferably in
       that order.

</pre><h4><b>MESSAGES</b></h4><pre>
       Various error conditions can occur in Plotchar.  Each of these results in a call to the error-handling
       routine SETER, with a final argument indicating that the error is recoverable; by default, an error
       message is printed and execution is terminated, but, if you turn on error recovery (as described in the
       "man" page for "error_handling"), you can get control back.

       The error messages are as follows; all should be more or less self-explanatory.

            PCDLSC - FIRST COLOR INDEX IS LESS THAN ZERO
            PCDLSC - UNCLEARED PRIOR ERROR
