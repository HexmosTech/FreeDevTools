</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Pragma "use charnames" is used to gain access to the names of the Unicode characters and named character
       sequences, and to allow you to define your own character and character sequence names.

       All forms of the pragma enable use of the following 3 functions:

       •   "charnames::string_vianame(<u>name</u>)"  for  run-time  lookup  of  a  either  a  character name or a named
           character sequence, returning its string representation

       •   "charnames::vianame(<u>name</u>)" for run-time lookup of  a  character  name  (but  not  a  named  character
           sequence) to get its ordinal value (code point)

       •   "charnames::viacode(<u>code</u>)" for run-time lookup of a code point to get its Unicode name.

       Starting  in  Perl  v5.16,  any  occurrence  of  "\N{<u>CHARNAME</u>}"  sequences  in  a  double-quotish  string
       automatically loads this module with arguments ":full"  and  ":short"  (described  below)  if  it  hasn't
       already  been  loaded  with  different  arguments,  in  order to compile the named Unicode character into
       position in the string.  Prior to v5.16, an explicit "use charnames" was required to enable  this  usage.
       (However, prior to v5.16, the form "use charnames ();" did not enable "\N{<u>CHARNAME</u>}".)

       Note  that  "\N{U+<u>...</u>}",  where  the <u>...</u> is a hexadecimal number, also inserts a character into a string.
       The character it inserts is the one whose Unicode code point (ordinal value) is equal to the number.  For
       example, "\N{U+263a}" is the Unicode (white background,  black  foreground)  smiley  face  equivalent  to
       "\N{WHITE  SMILING FACE}".  Also note, "\N{<u>...</u>}" can mean a regex quantifier instead of a character name,
       when the <u>...</u> is a number (or comma separated pair of numbers (see "QUANTIFIERS" in perlreref), and is not
       related to this pragma.

       The "charnames" pragma supports arguments  ":full",  ":loose",  ":short",  script  names  and  customized
       aliases.

       If  ":full"  is  present,  for expansion of "\N{<u>CHARNAME</u>}", the string <u>CHARNAME</u> is first looked up in the
       list of standard Unicode character names.

       ":loose" is a variant of ":full" which allows <u>CHARNAME</u> to be less precisely specified.   Details  are  in
       "LOOSE MATCHES".

       If  ":short" is present, and <u>CHARNAME</u> has the form "<u>SCRIPT</u>:<u>CNAME</u>", then <u>CNAME</u> is looked up as a letter in
       script <u>SCRIPT</u>, as described in the next paragraph.  Or, if "use  charnames"  is  used  with  script  name
       arguments,  then  for  "\N{<u>CHARNAME</u>}" the name <u>CHARNAME</u> is looked up as a letter in the given scripts (in
       the specified order). Customized aliases can override these, and are explained in "CUSTOM ALIASES".

       For lookup of <u>CHARNAME</u> inside a given script <u>SCRIPTNAME</u>, this pragma  looks  in  the  table  of  standard
       Unicode names for the names

         SCRIPTNAME CAPITAL LETTER CHARNAME
         SCRIPTNAME SMALL LETTER CHARNAME
         SCRIPTNAME LETTER CHARNAME

       If  <u>CHARNAME</u>  is  all  lowercase, then the "CAPITAL" variant is ignored, otherwise the "SMALL" variant is
       ignored, and both <u>CHARNAME</u> and <u>SCRIPTNAME</u> are converted to all uppercase for look-up.  Other  than  that,
       both of them follow loose rules if ":loose" is also specified; strict otherwise.

       Note  that  "\N{...}"  is compile-time; it's a special form of string constant used inside double-quotish
       strings; this means that you cannot use variables inside the "\N{...}".  If  you  want  similar  run-time
       functionality, use <b>charnames::string_vianame()</b>.

       Note,  starting  in  Perl  5.18,  the name "BELL" refers to the Unicode character U+1F514, instead of the
       traditional U+0007.  For the latter, use "ALERT" or "BEL".

       It is a syntax error to use "\N{NAME}" where "NAME" is unknown.

       For "\N{NAME}", it is a fatal error if "use bytes" is in effect and the input name is that of a character
       that won't fit into a byte (i.e., whose ordinal is above 255).

       Otherwise, any string that includes  a  "\N{<u>charname</u>}"  or  "\N{U+<u>code</u> <u>point</u>}"  will  automatically  have
       Unicode rules (see "Byte and Character Semantics" in perlunicode).

</pre><h4><b>LOOSE</b> <b>MATCHES</b></h4><pre>
       By       specifying       ":loose",       Unicode's       loose       character       name       matching
       &lt;<a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr44">http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr44</a>#Matching_Rules&gt; rules are selected instead of the strict exact match
       used otherwise.  That means that <u>CHARNAME</u> doesn't have to be so precisely  specified.   Upper/lower  case
       doesn't  matter  (except  with  scripts as mentioned above), nor do any underscores, and the only hyphens
       that matter are those at the beginning or end of a word in the name (with one exception:  the  hyphen  in
       U+1180  "HANGUL  JUNGSEONG  O-E"  does  matter).  Also, blanks not adjacent to hyphens don't matter.  The
       official Unicode names are quite variable as to where they use hyphens versus spaces  to  separate  word-
       like units, and this option allows you to not have to care as much.  The reason non-medial hyphens matter
       is because of cases like U+0F60 "TIBETAN LETTER -A" versus U+0F68 "TIBETAN LETTER A".  The hyphen here is
       significant, as is the space before it, and so both must be included.

       ":loose"  slows  down look-ups by a factor of 2 to 3 versus ":full", but the trade-off may be worth it to
       you.  Each individual look-up takes very little time, and the results are cached, so the speed difference
       would become a factor only in programs that do look-ups of many different spellings,  and  probably  only
       when  those  look-ups  are  through  vianame() and string_vianame(), since "\N{...}" look-ups are done at
       compile time.

</pre><h4><b>ALIASES</b></h4><pre>
       Starting in Unicode 6.1 and Perl v5.16, Unicode defines many abbreviations and names that  were  formerly
       Perl  extensions,  and some additional ones that Perl did not previously accept.  The list is getting too
       long  to  reproduce  here,  but  you  can  get  the  complete   list   from   the   Unicode   web   site:
       &lt;<a href="http://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/NameAliases.txt">http://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/NameAliases.txt</a>&gt;.

       Earlier  versions  of  Perl accepted almost all the 6.1 names.  These were most extensively documented in
       the v5.14 version of this pod: &lt;<a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/5.14.0/charnames.html">http://perldoc.perl.org/5.14.0/charnames.html</a>#ALIASES&gt;.

</pre><h4><b>CUSTOM</b> <b>ALIASES</b></h4><pre>
       You can add customized aliases to standard (":full") Unicode naming conventions.   The  aliases  override
       any  standard  definitions,  so, if you're twisted enough, you can change "\N{LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A}" to
       mean "B", etc.

       Aliases must begin with a character that is alphabetic.  After that, each may contain any combination  of
       word  ("\w")  characters,  SPACE  (U+0020),  HYPHEN-MINUS  (U+002D), LEFT PARENTHESIS (U+0028), and RIGHT
       PARENTHESIS (U+0029).  These last two should never have been allowed  in  names,  and  are  retained  for
       backwards  compatibility only, and may be deprecated and removed in future releases of Perl, so don't use
       them for new names.  (More precisely, the first character of a name you specify must  be  something  that
       matches  all  of  "\p{ID_Start}",  "\p{Alphabetic}", and "\p{Gc=Letter}".  This makes sure it is what any
       reasonable person would view as an alphabetic character.  And, the  continuation  characters  that  match
       "\w"  must  also  match "\p{ID_Continue}".)  Starting with Perl v5.18, any Unicode characters meeting the
       above criteria may be used; prior to that only Latin1-range characters were acceptable.

       An alias can map to either an official Unicode character name (not a loose matched name) or to a  numeric
       code  point  (ordinal).   The  latter is useful for assigning names to code points in Unicode private use
       areas such as U+E800 through U+F8FF.  A numeric code point must be a non-negative integer,  or  a  string
       beginning with "U+" or "0x" with the remainder considered to be a hexadecimal integer.  A literal numeric
       constant must be unsigned; it will be interpreted as hex if it has a leading zero or contains non-decimal
       hex  digits;  otherwise  it will be interpreted as decimal.  If it begins with "U+", it is interpreted as
       the Unicode code point; otherwise it is interpreted as native.  (Only code points below  256  can  differ
       between  Unicode  and  native.)   Thus  "U+41"  is always the Latin letter "A"; but 0x41 can be "NO-BREAK
       SPACE" on EBCDIC platforms.

       Aliases are added either by the use of anonymous hashes:

           use charnames ":alias" =&gt; {
               e_ACUTE =&gt; "LATIN SMALL LETTER E WITH ACUTE",
               mychar1 =&gt; 0xE8000,
               };
           my $str = "\N{e_ACUTE}";

       or by using a file containing aliases:

           use charnames ":alias" =&gt; "pro";

       This will try to read "unicore/pro_alias.pl" from the @INC path. This file should return a list in  plain
       perl:

           (
           A_GRAVE         =&gt; "LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH GRAVE",
           A_CIRCUM        =&gt; "LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH CIRCUMFLEX",
           A_DIAERES       =&gt; "LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH DIAERESIS",
           A_TILDE         =&gt; "LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH TILDE",
           A_BREVE         =&gt; "LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH BREVE",
           A_RING          =&gt; "LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH RING ABOVE",
           A_MACRON        =&gt; "LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH MACRON",
           mychar2         =&gt; "U+E8001",
           );

       Both  these  methods  insert ":full" automatically as the first argument (if no other argument is given),
       and you can give the ":full" explicitly as well, like

           use charnames ":full", ":alias" =&gt; "pro";

       ":loose" has no effect with these.  Input names must match exactly, using ":full" rules.

       Also, both these methods currently allow only single characters to be  named.   To  name  a  sequence  of
       characters, use a custom translator (described below).

</pre><h4><b>charnames::string_vianame(</b><u><b>name</b></u><b>)</b></h4><pre>
       This  is a runtime equivalent to "\N{...}".  <u>name</u> can be any expression that evaluates to a name accepted
       by "\N{...}" under the ":full" option to "charnames".  In addition, any other options for the controlling
       "use charnames" in the same scope apply, like ":loose" or any script list,  ":short"  option,  or  custom
       aliases you may have defined.

       The  only  differences  are due to the fact that "string_vianame" is run-time and "\N{}" is compile time.
       You can't interpolate inside a "\N{}", (so "\N{$variable}" doesn't  work);  and  if  the  input  name  is
       unknown, "string_vianame" returns "undef" instead of it being a syntax error.

</pre><h4><b>charnames::vianame(</b><u><b>name</b></u><b>)</b></h4><pre>
       This  is  similar  to  "string_vianame".  The main difference is that under most circumstances, "vianame"
       returns an ordinal code point, whereas "string_vianame" returns a string.  For example,

          printf "U+%04X", charnames::vianame("FOUR TEARDROP-SPOKED ASTERISK");

       prints "U+2722".

       This leads to the other two differences.  Since a single code  point  is  returned,  the  function  can't
       handle  named  character  sequences, as these are composed of multiple characters (it returns "undef" for
       these.  And, the code point can be that  of  any  character,  even  ones  that  aren't  legal  under  the
       "use bytes" pragma,

       See "BUGS" for the circumstances in which the behavior differs from  that described above.

</pre><h4><b>charnames::viacode(</b><u><b>code</b></u><b>)</b></h4><pre>
       Returns the full name of the character indicated by the numeric code.  For example,

           print charnames::<a href="../man0x2722/viacode.0x2722.html">viacode</a>(0x2722);

       prints "FOUR TEARDROP-SPOKED ASTERISK".

       The  name returned is the "best" (defined below) official name or alias for the code point, if available;
       otherwise your custom alias for it, if defined; otherwise "undef".  This means that your alias will  only
       be returned for code points that don't have an official Unicode name (nor alias) such as private use code
       points.

       If you define more than one name for the code point, it is indeterminate which one will be returned.

       As mentioned, the function returns "undef" if no name is known for the code point.  In Unicode the proper
       name  for these is the empty string, which "undef" stringifies to.  (If you ask for a code point past the
       legal Unicode maximum of U+10FFFF that you haven't assigned an alias to, you get "undef" plus a warning.)

       The input number must be a non-negative integer, or a  string  beginning  with  "U+"  or  "0x"  with  the
       remainder  considered  to be a hexadecimal integer.  A literal numeric constant must be unsigned; it will
       be interpreted as hex if it has a leading zero or contains non-decimal hex digits; otherwise it  will  be
       interpreted  as  decimal.  If it begins with "U+", it is interpreted as the Unicode code point; otherwise
       it is interpreted as native.  (Only code points below 256 can differ between Unicode and  native.)   Thus
       "U+41" is always the Latin letter "A"; but 0x41 can be "NO-BREAK SPACE" on EBCDIC platforms.

       As  mentioned  above under "ALIASES", Unicode 6.1 defines extra names (synonyms or aliases) for some code
       points, most of which were already available as Perl extensions.  All these are accepted by "\N{...}" and
       the other functions in this module, but "viacode" has to choose which one name  to  return  for  a  given
       input  code  point,  so  it returns the "best" name.  To understand how this works, it is helpful to know
       more about the Unicode name properties.  All  code  points  actually  have  only  a  single  name,  which
       (starting  in  Unicode  2.0)  can never change once a character has been assigned to the code point.  But
       mistakes have been made in assigning names, for example sometimes a clerical error was  made  during  the
       publishing  of  the  Standard which caused words to be misspelled, and there was no way to correct those.
       The Name_Alias property was eventually created to handle these  situations.   If  a  name  was  wrong,  a
       corrected  synonym  would  be  published  for it, using Name_Alias.  "viacode" will return that corrected
       synonym as the "best" name for a code point.  (It is even possible, though it hasn't happened  yet,  that
       the  correction  itself will need to be corrected, and so another Name_Alias can be created for that code
       point; "viacode" will return the most recent correction.)

       The Unicode name for each of the control characters (such as LINE FEED) is  the  empty  string.   However
       almost  all  had  names  assigned  by other standards, such as the ASCII Standard, or were in common use.
       "viacode" returns these names as the "best" ones available.  Unicode 6.1  has  created  Name_Aliases  for
       each of them, including alternate names, like NEW LINE.  "viacode" uses the original name, "LINE FEED" in
       preference  to the alternate.  Similarly the name returned for U+FEFF is "ZERO WIDTH NO-BREAK SPACE", not
       "BYTE ORDER MARK".

       Until Unicode 6.1, the 4 control characters U+0080, U+0081, U+0084, and U+0099 did  not  have  names  nor
       aliases.   To  preserve  backwards  compatibility,  any  alias  you  define for these code points will be
       returned by this function, in preference to the official name.

       Some code points also have abbreviated names, such as "LF" or "NL".  "viacode" never returns these.

       Because a name correction may be added in future Unicode releases, the name that  "viacode"  returns  may
       change as a result.  This is a rare event, but it does happen.

</pre><h4><b>CUSTOM</b> <b>TRANSLATORS</b></h4><pre>
       The  mechanism  of  translation  of  "\N{...}" escapes is general and not hardwired into <u>charnames.pm</u>.  A
       module can install custom translations (inside the scope which "use"s  the  module)  with  the  following
       magic incantation:

           sub import {
               shift;
               $^H{charnames} = \&amp;translator;
           }

       Here  <b>translator()</b>  is  a subroutine which takes <u>CHARNAME</u> as an argument, and returns text to insert into
       the string instead of the "\N{<u>CHARNAME</u>}" escape.

       This is the only way you can create a custom named sequence of code points.

       Since the text to insert should be different in "bytes" mode and out of it, the function should check the
       current state of "bytes"-flag as in:

           use bytes ();                      # for $bytes::hint_bits
           sub translator {
               if ($^H &amp; $bytes::hint_bits) {
                   return bytes_translator(@_);
               }
               else {
                   return utf8_translator(@_);
               }
           }

       See "CUSTOM ALIASES" above for restrictions on <u>CHARNAME</u>.

       Of course, "vianame", "viacode", and "string_vianame" would need to be overridden as well.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>vianame()</b> normally returns an ordinal code point, but when the input name is  of  the  form  "U+...",  it
       returns  a  chr  instead.   In  this case, if "use bytes" is in effect and the character won't fit into a
       byte, it returns "undef" and raises a warning.

       Since evaluation of the translation  function  (see  "CUSTOM  TRANSLATORS")  happens  in  the  middle  of
       compilation  (of  a  string  literal),  the translation function should not do any "eval"s or "require"s.
       This restriction should be lifted (but is low priority) in a future version of Perl.
