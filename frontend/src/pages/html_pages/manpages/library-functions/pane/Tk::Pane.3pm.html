</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Tk::Pane - A window panner

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Tk::Pane;

           $pane = $mw-&gt;Scrolled("Pane", Name =&gt; 'fred',
               -scrollbars =&gt; 'soe',
               -sticky =&gt; 'we',
               -gridded =&gt; 'y'
           );

           $pane-&gt;Frame;

           $pane-&gt;pack;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Tk::Pane</b> provides a scrollable frame widget. Once created it can be treated as a frame, except it is
       scrollable.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-gridded</b> =&gt; <u>direction</u>
           Specifies  if  the  top  and left edges of the pane should snap to a grid column. This option is only
           useful if the widgets in the pane are managed by the <u>grid</u> geometry manager. Possible values are <b>x</b>,  <b>y</b>
           and <b>xy</b>.

       <b>-sticky</b> =&gt; <u>style</u>
           If Pane is larger than its requested dimensions, this option may be used to position (or stretch) the
           slave within its cavity. <u>Style</u> is a string that contains zero or more of the characters n, s, e or w.
           The  string  can  optionally contains spaces or commas, but they are ignored. Each letter refers to a
           side (north, south, east, or west) that the slave will "stick" to. If both n and s (or e and  w)  are
           specified, the slave will be stretched to fill the entire height (or width) of its cavity.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>$pane</u>-&gt;<b>see</b>(<u>$widget</u> ?,<u>options</u>?)
           Adjusts  the  view  so  that  <u>$widget</u> is visable. Additional parameters in <u>options-value</u> pairs can be
           passed, each <u>option-value</u> pair must be one of the following

           <b>-anchor</b> =&gt; <u>anchor</u>
                   Specifies how to make the widget visable. If not given then as much of the widget as possible
                   is made visable.

                   Possible values are <b>n</b>, <b>s</b>, <b>w</b>, <b>e</b>, <b>nw</b>, <b>ne</b>, <b>sw</b> and <b>se</b>.  This will cause an edge on the widget  to
                   be aligned with the corresponding edge on the pane. for example <b>nw</b> will cause the top left of
                   the widget to be placed at the top left of the pane. <b>s</b> will cause the bottom of the widget to
                   be  placed  at  the bottom of the pane, and as much of the widget as possible made visable in
                   the x direction.

       <u>$pane</u>-&gt;<b>xview</b>
           Returns a list containing two elements, both of which are real fractions between 0 and 1.  The  first
           element  gives the position of  the left of the window, relative to the Pane as a whole (0.5 means it
           is halfway through the Pane, for example). The second element gives the position of the right of  the
           window, relative to the Pane as a whole.

       <u>$pane</u>-&gt;<b>xview</b>(<u>$widget</u>)
           Adjusts the view in the window so that <u>widget</u> is displayed at the left of the window.

       <u>$pane</u>-&gt;<b>xview</b>(<b>moveto</b> =&gt; <u>fraction</u>)
           Adjusts  the  view in the window so that <u>fraction</u> of the total width of the Pane is off-screen to the
           left. fraction must be a fraction between 0 and 1.

       <u>$pane</u>-&gt;<b>xview</b>(<b>scroll</b> =&gt; <u>number</u>, <u>what</u>)
           This command shifts the view in the window left or right according to <u>number</u> and <u>what</u>. <u>Number</u> must be
           an integer. <u>What</u> must be either <b>units</b> or <b>pages</b> or an abbreviation of one of these. If <u>what</u> is  <b>units</b>,
           the view adjusts left or right by <u>number</u>*10 screen units on the display; if it is <b>pages</b> then the view
           adjusts  by number screenfuls. If number is negative then widgets farther to the left become visible;
           if it is positive then widgets farther to the right become visible.

       <u>$pane</u>-&gt;<b>yview</b>
           Returns a list containing two elements, both of which are real fractions between 0 and 1.  The  first
           element  gives  the position of  the top of the window, relative to the Pane as a whole (0.5 means it
           is halfway through the Pane, for example). The second element gives the position of the bottom of the
           window, relative to the Pane as a whole.

       <u>$pane</u>-&gt;<b>yview</b>(<u>$widget</u>)
           Adjusts the view in the window so that <u>widget</u> is displayed at the top of the window.

       <u>$pane</u>-&gt;<b>yview</b>(<b>moveto</b> =&gt; <u>fraction</u>)
           Adjusts the view in the window so that <u>fraction</u> of the total width of the Pane is off-screen  to  the
           top. fraction must be a fraction between 0 and 1.

       <u>$pane</u>-&gt;<b>yview</b>(<b>scroll</b> =&gt; <u>number</u>, <u>what</u>)
           This command shifts the view in the window up or down according to <u>number</u> and <u>what</u>. <u>Number</u> must be an
           integer. <u>What</u> must be either <b>units</b> or <b>pages</b> or an abbreviation of one of these. If <u>what</u> is <b>units</b>, the
           view  adjusts  up  or  down  by  <u>number</u>*10  screen units on the display; if it is <b>pages</b> then the view
           adjusts by number screenfuls. If number is negative then widgets farther up become visible; if it  is
           positive then widgets farther down become visible.
