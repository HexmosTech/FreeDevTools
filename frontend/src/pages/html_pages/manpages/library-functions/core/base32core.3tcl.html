</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       base32::core - Expanding basic base32 maps

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       package require <b>Tcl</b> <b>8.5</b> <b>9</b>

       package require <b>base32::core</b> <b>?0.2?</b>

       <b>::base32::core::define</b> <u>map</u> <u>forwvar</u> <u>backwvar</u> <u>ivar</u>

       <b>::base32::core::valid</b> <u>string</u> <u>pattern</u> <u>mvar</u>

________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  package provides generic commands for the construction of full base32 mappings from a basic mapping
       listing just the codes and associated characters. The full mappings, regular and  inverse,  created  here
       map to and from bit sequences, and also handle the partial mappings at the end of a string.

       This  is in essence an internal package to be used by implementors of a base32 en- and decoder. A regular
       user has no need of this package at all.

</pre><h4><b>API</b></h4><pre>
       <b>::base32::core::define</b> <u>map</u> <u>forwvar</u> <u>backwvar</u> <u>ivar</u>
              This command computes full forward and backward (inverse) mappings from the basic <u>map</u>  and  stores
              them  in the variables named by <u>forwvar</u> and <u>backwvar</u> resp. It also constructs a regexp pattern for
              the detection of invalid characters in supposedly base32  encoded  input  and  stores  it  in  the
              variable named by <u>ivar</u>.

       <b>::base32::core::valid</b> <u>string</u> <u>pattern</u> <u>mvar</u>
              This  command checks if the input <u>string</u> is a valid base32 encoded string, based on the <u>pattern</u> of
              invalid characters as generated by <b>::base32::core::define</b>, and some other general rules.

              The result of the command is a boolean flag. Its value is <b>True</b>  for  a  valid  <u>string</u>,  and  <b>False</b>
              otherwise.  In  the  latter  case an error message describing the problem with the input is stored
              into the variable named by <u>mvar</u>. The variable is not touched if the input was found to be valid.

              The rules checked by the command, beyond rejection of bad characters, are:

              [1]    The length of the input is not a multiple of eight,

              [2]    The padding appears not at the end of input, but in the middle,

              [3]    The padding has not of length six, four, three, or one characters,

       This document, and the package it describes, will undoubtedly contain bugs and  other  problems.   Please
       report such in the category <u>base32</u> of the <u>Tcllib</u> <u>Trackers</u> [<a href="http://core.tcl.tk/tcllib/reportlist">http://core.tcl.tk/tcllib/reportlist</a>].  Please
       also report any ideas for enhancements you may have for either package and/or documentation.

       When proposing code changes, please provide <u>unified</u> <u>diffs</u>, i.e the output of <b>diff</b> <b>-u</b>.

       Note  further  that  <u>attachments</u>  are strongly preferred over inlined patches. Attachments can be made by
       going to the <b>Edit</b> form of the ticket immediately after its creation, and then using the left-most  button
