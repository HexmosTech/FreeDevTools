</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       libpfm_intel_adl_grt - support for Intel Alderlake Gracemont (P-core) core PMU

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;perfmon/pfmlib.h&gt;</b>

       <b>PMU</b> <b>name:</b> <b>adl_grt</b>
       <b>PMU</b> <b>desc:</b> <b>Intel</b> <b>Alderlake</b> <b>Goldencove</b> <b>(E-core)</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  library  supports  the Intel Alderlake Gracemont (E-core) core PMU. It should be noted that this PMU
       model only covers each core's PMU and not the socket level PMU.  Because  the  processor  uses  a  hybrid
       architecture  with  a  P-Core  and  E-Core with a different PMU model, it may be necessary to force a PMU
       instance  name  to   get   the   desired   encoding.   For   instance,   to   encode   for   the   P-Core
       adl_grt::BR_INST_RETIRED and for the E-core adl_grt::BR_INST_RETIRED.

       On Adlerlake Gracemont (P-Core), there are 6 generic counters and 3 fixed counters.

       The <b>pfm_get_pmu_info()</b> function returns the maximum number of generic counters in <b>num_cntrs</b>.

</pre><h4><b>MODIFIERS</b></h4><pre>
       The following modifiers are supported on Intel SapphireRapid processors:

       <b>u</b>      Measure at user level which includes privilege levels 1, 2, 3. This corresponds to <b>PFM_PLM3</b>.  This
              is a boolean modifier.

       <b>k</b>      Measure at kernel level which includes privilege level 0. This corresponds to <b>PFM_PLM0</b>.  This is a
              boolean modifier.

       <b>i</b>      Invert  the  meaning  of  the  event.  The counter will now count cycles in which the event is <b>not</b>
              occurring. This is a boolean modifier

       <b>e</b>      Enable edge detection, i.e., count only when there is a state transition from no occurrence of the
              event to at least one occurrence. This modifier must be combined with a counter mask modifier  (m)
              with a value greater or equal to one.  This is a boolean modifier.

       <b>c</b>      Set  the  counter  mask  value. The mask acts as a threshold. The counter will count the number of
              cycles in which the number of occurrences of the event is greater or equal to the threshold.  This
              is an integer modifier with values in the range [0:255].

       <b>ldlat</b>  Pass  a  latency threshold in core cycles to the MEM_TRANS_RETIRED:LOAD_LATENCY event.  This is an
              integer attribute that must be in the range [1:65535]. It is required for this event. The  library
              provides  a  set of presets for specific latencies, such as 128.  Note that the event <b>must</b> be used
              with precise sampling (PEBS).

</pre><h4><b>OFFCORE_RESPONSE</b> <b>events</b></h4><pre>
       Intel Alderlake Gracemont (E-Core) supports two encodings for offcore_response events (0x1b7, 0x2b7).  In
       the  library,  these are called OCR0 and OCR1. The two encodings are equivalent. On Linux, the kernel can
       schedule any OCR encoding into any of the two OCR counters.  The offcore_response events are exposed as a
       normal events by the library. The extra settings are exposed as regular umasks. The library takes care of
       encoding the events according to the underlying kernel interface.

       On Intel Alderlake Gracemont (E-Core), the event is treated as a regular event with a flat set of  umasks
       to  choose  from.   It is not possible to combine the various requests, supplier, snoop bits anymore. The
       library offers the list of validated combinations as per Intel's official event list.
