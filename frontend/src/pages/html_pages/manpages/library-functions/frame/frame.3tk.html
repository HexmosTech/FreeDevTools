       <b>-borderwidth</b>          <b>-highlightcolor</b>      <b>-pady</b>
       <b>-cursor</b>               <b>-highlightthickness</b>  <b>-relief</b>

       See the <b>options</b> manual entry for details on the standard options.

</pre><h4><b>WIDGET-SPECIFIC</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Command-Line Name:<b>-background</b>
       Database Name:  <b>background</b>
       Database Class: <b>Background</b>

              This  option  is  the  same  as  the standard <b>-background</b> option except that its value may also be
              specified as an empty string.  In this case, the widget will display no background or border,  and
              no  colors  will be consumed from its colormap for its background and border.  An empty background 2
              will disable drawing the background image.                                                         2

       Command-Line Name:<b>-backgroundimage</b>                                                                        2
       Database Name:  <b>backgroundImage</b>                                                                           2
       Database Class: <b>BackgroundImage</b>                                                                           2

              This specifies an image to display on the frame's background within the border of the frame (i.e., 2
              the image will be clipped by the frame's highlight  ring  and  border,  if  either  are  present); 2
              subwidgets  of  the  frame  will  be drawn on top. The image must have been created with the <b>image</b> 2
              <b>create</b> command. If specified as the empty string, no image will be displayed.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-class</b>
       Database Name:  <b>class</b>
       Database Class: <b>Class</b>

              Specifies a class for the window.  This class will be used when querying the option  database  for
              the  window's  other  options, and it will also be used later for other purposes such as bindings.
              The <b>-class</b> option may not be changed with the <b>configure</b> widget command.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-colormap</b>
       Database Name:  <b>colormap</b>
       Database Class: <b>Colormap</b>

              Specifies a colormap to use for the window.  The value may be either <b>new</b>,  in  which  case  a  new
              colormap  is created for the window and its children, or the name of another window (which must be
              on the same screen and have the same visual as <u>pathName</u>), in which case the new  window  will  use
              the  colormap from the specified window.  If the <b>-colormap</b> option is not specified, the new window
              uses the same colormap as its parent.  This option may not be changed with  the  <b>configure</b>  widget
              command.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-container</b>
       Database Name:  <b>container</b>
       Database Class: <b>Container</b>

              The  value  must  be a boolean.  If true, it means that this window will be used as a container in
              which some other application will be embedded (for example, a Tk toplevel can  be  embedded  using
              the  <b>-use</b>  option).   The  window will support the appropriate window manager protocols for things
              like geometry requests.  The window should not have any children of its own in  this  application.
              This  option  may not be changed with the <b>configure</b> widget command.  Note that <b>-borderwidth</b>, <b>-padx</b>
              and <b>-pady</b> are ignored when configured as a container since a container has no border.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-height</b>
       Database Name:  <b>height</b>
       Database Class: <b>Height</b>

              Specifies the desired height for the window in any of the forms acceptable  to  <b>Tk_GetPixels</b>.   If
              this  option is negative or zero then the window will not request any size at all.  Note that this
              sets the total height of the frame, any <b>-borderwidth</b> or similar is not  added.   Normally  <b>-height</b>
              should  not  be  used  if a propagating geometry manager, such as <b>grid</b> or <b>pack</b>, is used within the
              frame since the geometry manager will override the height of the frame.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-tile</b>
       Database Name:  <b>tile</b>
       Database Class: <b>Tile</b>

              This specifies how to draw the background image (see <b>-backgroundimage</b>)  on  the  frame.   If  true 2
              (according to <b>Tcl_GetBoolean</b>), the image will be tiled to fill the whole frame, with the origin of 2
              the  first  copy  of  the  image  being  the top left of the interior of the frame.  If false (the 2
              default), the image will be centered within the frame.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-visual</b>
       Database Name:  <b>visual</b>
       Database Class: <b>Visual</b>

              Specifies visual information for the new window in any of the forms accepted by <b>Tk_GetVisual</b>.   If
              this  option is not specified, the new window will use the same visual as its parent.  The <b>-visual</b>
              option may not be modified with the <b>configure</b> widget command.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-width</b>
       Database Name:  <b>width</b>
       Database Class: <b>Width</b>

              Specifies the desired width for the window in any of the forms  acceptable  to  <b>Tk_GetPixels</b>.   If
              this  option is negative or zero then the window will not request any size at all.  Note that this
              sets the total width of the frame, any <b>-borderwidth</b> or similar  is  not  added.   Normally  <b>-width</b>
              should  not  be  used  if a propagating geometry manager, such as <b>grid</b> or <b>pack</b>, is used within the
              frame since the geometry manager will override the width of the frame.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>frame</b> command creates a new window (given by the <u>pathName</u> argument) and makes it into a frame widget.
       Additional options, described above, may be specified on the command line or in the  option  database  to
       configure  aspects  of  the frame such as its background color and relief.  The <b>frame</b> command returns the
       path name of the new window.

       A frame is a simple widget.  Its primary purpose is to act as a spacer or container  for  complex  window
       layouts.   The  only  features of a frame are its background and an optional 3-D border to make the frame
       appear raised or sunken.

</pre><h4><b>WIDGET</b> <b>COMMAND</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>frame</b> command creates a new Tcl command whose name is the same  as  the  path  name  of  the  frame's
       window.   This  command  may  be  used  to invoke various operations on the widget.  It has the following
       general form:

              <u>pathName</u> <u>option</u> ?<u>arg</u> <u>...</u>?

       <u>PathName</u> is the name of the command, which is the same as the frame widget's path name.  <u>Option</u>  and  the
       <u>arg</u>s determine the exact behavior of the command.  The following commands are possible for frame widgets:

       <u>pathName</u> <b>cget</b> <u>option</u>
              Returns the current value of the configuration option given by <u>option</u>.  <u>Option</u> may have any of the
              values accepted by the <b>frame</b> command.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>configure</b> ?<u>option</u>? ?<u>value</u> <u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>...</u>?
              Query  or  modify  the  configuration options of the widget.  If no <u>option</u> is specified, returns a
              list describing all of the available options for <u>pathName</u> (see <b>Tk_ConfigureInfo</b> for information on
              the format of this list).  If <u>option</u> is specified with no <u>value</u>, then the command returns  a  list
              describing  the  one named option (this list will be identical to the corresponding sublist of the
              value returned if no <u>option</u> is specified).  If one or more <u>option-value</u> pairs are specified,  then
              the  command  modifies  the  given  widget option(s) to have the given value(s);  in this case the
              command returns an empty string.  <u>Option</u> may have any of the values accepted by the <b>frame</b> command.

</pre><h4><b>BINDINGS</b></h4><pre>
       When a new frame is created, it has no default event bindings: frames are not intended to be interactive.
