</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Tk::Frame - Create and manipulate Frame widgets

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           <u>$frame</u> = <u>$parent</u>-&gt;<b>Frame</b>(?<u>options</u>?);

</pre><h4><b>STANDARD</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-borderwidth</b>   <b>-highlightbackground</b>     <b>-highlightthickness</b> <b>-takefocus</b>
       <b>-class</b>    <b>-highlightcolor</b>     <b>-relief</b> <b>-cursor</b>

       See Tk::options for details of the standard options.

</pre><h4><b>WIDGET-SPECIFIC</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Name:     <b>background</b>
       Class:    <b>Background</b>
       Switch:   <b>-background</b>
           This option is the same as the standard <b>background</b> option except that its value may also be specified
           as  an undefined value.  In this case, the widget will display no background or border, and no colors
           will be consumed from its colormap for its background and border.

       Name:     <b>colormap</b>
       Class:    <b>Colormap</b>
       Switch:   <b>-colormap</b>
           Specifies a colormap to use for the window.  The value may  be  either  <b>new</b>,  in  which  case  a  new
           colormap  is created for the window and its children, or the name of another window (which must be on
           the same screen and have the same visual as $widget), in which case  the  new  window  will  use  the
           colormap from the specified window.  If the <b>colormap</b> option is not specified, the new window uses the
           same colormap as its parent.  This option may not be changed with the <b>configure</b> method.

       Name:     <b>container</b>
       Class:    <b>Container</b>
       Switch:   <b>-container</b>
           The value must be a boolean.  If true, it means that this window will be used as a container in which
           some  other  application  will be embedded (for example, a Tk toplevel can be embedded using the <b>-use</b>
           option).  The window will support the appropriate window manager protocols for things  like  geometry
           requests.   The  window should not have any children of its own in this application.  This option may
           not be changed with the <b>configure</b> method.

       Name:     <b>height</b>
       Class:    <b>Height</b>
       Switch:   <b>-height</b>
           Specifies the desired height for the window in any of the forms acceptable to <b>Tk_GetPixels</b>.  If  this
           option is less than or equal to zero then the window will not request any size at all.

       Name:     <b>visual</b>
       Class:    <b>Visual</b>
       Switch:   <b>-visual</b>
           Specifies  visual  information  for  the new window in any of the forms accepted by <b>Tk_GetVisual</b>.  If
           this option is not specified, the new window will use the same visual  as  its  parent.   The  <b>visual</b>
           option may not be modified with the <b>configure</b> method.

       Name:     <b>width</b>
       Class:    <b>Width</b>
       Switch:   <b>-width</b>
           Specifies  the  desired width for the window in any of the forms acceptable to <b>Tk_GetPixels</b>.  If this
           option is less than or equal to zero then the window will not request any size at all.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>Frame</b> method creates a new window (given by the $widget argument) and makes it into a  frame  widget.
       Additional  options,  described  above, may be specified on the command line or in the option database to
       configure aspects of the frame such as its background color and relief.  The <b>frame</b>  command  returns  the
       path name of the new window.

       A  frame  is  a simple widget.  Its primary purpose is to act as a spacer or container for complex window
       layouts.  The only features of a frame are its background color and an optional 3-D border  to  make  the
       frame appear raised or sunken.

</pre><h4><b>WIDGET</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>Frame</b> method creates a widget object.  This object supports the <b>configure</b> and <b>cget</b> methods described
       in Tk::options which can be used to enquire and modify the options  described  above.   The  widget  also
       inherits all the methods provided by the generic Tk::Widget class.

</pre><h4><b>BINDINGS</b></h4><pre>
       When a new frame is created, it has no default event bindings: frames are not intended to be interactive.

</pre><h4><b>KEYWORDS</b></h4><pre>
       frame, widget
