</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  command  allows  an  application  to  send  Dynamic  Data Exchange (DDE) command when running under
       Microsoft Windows. Dynamic Data Exchange is a mechanism where applications can exchange  raw  data.  Each
       DDE  transaction  needs  a  <u>service</u>  <u>name</u>  and  a  <u>topic</u>. Both the <u>service</u> <u>name</u> and <u>topic</u> are application
       defined; Tcl uses the service name <b>TclEval</b>, while the topic name is the name of the interpreter given  by
       <b>dde</b> <b>servername</b>. Other applications have their own <u>service</u> <u>names</u> and <u>topics</u>. For instance, Microsoft Excel
       has the service name <b>Excel</b>.

</pre><h4><b>DDE</b> <b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       The following commands are a subset of the full Dynamic Data Exchange set of commands.

       <b>dde</b> <b>servername</b> ?<b>-force</b>? ?<b>-handler</b> <u>proc</u>? ?<b>--</b>? ?<u>topic</u>?
              <b>dde</b>  <b>servername</b>  registers  the  interpreter as a DDE server with the service name <b>TclEval</b> and the
              topic name specified by <u>topic</u>.  If no <u>topic</u> is given, <b>dde</b>  <b>servername</b>  returns  the  name  of  the
              current topic or the empty string if it is not registered as a service. If the given <u>topic</u> name is
              already  in  use,  then  a  suffix  of  the form “ #2” or “ #3” is appended to the name to make it
              unique. The command's result will be the name actually used. The <b>-force</b> option is  used  to  force
              registration of precisely the given <u>topic</u> name.

              The  <b>-handler</b>  option  specifies  a  Tcl procedure that will be called to process calls to the dde
              server. If the package has been loaded into a safe interpreter then a <b>-handler</b> procedure  must  be
              defined. The procedure is called with all the arguments provided by the remote call.

       <b>dde</b> <b>execute</b> ?<b>-async</b>? ?<b>-binary</b>? <u>service</u> <u>topic</u> <u>data</u>
              <b>dde</b>  <b>execute</b>  takes  the  <u>data</u>  and  sends  it  to  the server indicated by <u>service</u> with the topic
              indicated by <u>topic</u>. Typically, <u>service</u> is the name of an application, and <u>topic</u> is a file to  work
              on.   The  <u>data</u>  field  is given to the remote application.  Typically, the application treats the
              <u>data</u> field as a script, and the script is run in the  application.   The  <b>-async</b>  option  requests
              asynchronous  invocation.   The command returns an error message if the script did not run, unless
              the <b>-async</b> flag was used, in which case the command returns immediately with no error.

              Without the <b>-binary</b> option all data will be sent in unicode. For dde clients which don't implement
              the CF_UNICODE clipboard format, this will automatically be translated to the system encoding. You
              can use the <b>-binary</b> option in combination with the result of <b>encoding</b> <b>convertto</b> to  send  data  in
              any other encoding.

       <b>dde</b> <b>poke</b> ?<b>-binary</b>? <u>service</u> <u>topic</u> <u>item</u> <u>data</u>
              <b>dde</b>  <b>poke</b>  passes  the <u>data</u> to the server indicated by <u>service</u> using the <u>topic</u> and <u>item</u> specified.
              Typically, <u>service</u> is the name of an application.  <u>topic</u> is application  specific  but  can  be  a
              command to the server or the name of a file to work on.  The <u>item</u> is also application specific and
              is  often  not  used,  but  it  must  always  be  non-null.  The <u>data</u> field is given to the remote
              application.

              Without the <b>-binary</b> option all data will be sent in unicode. For dde clients which don't implement
              the CF_UNICODE clipboard format, this will automatically be translated to the system encoding. You
              can use the <b>-binary</b> option in combination with the result of <b>encoding</b> <b>convertto</b> to  send  data  in
              any other encoding.

       <b>dde</b> <b>request</b> ?<b>-binary</b>? <u>service</u> <u>topic</u> <u>item</u>
              <b>dde</b>  <b>request</b>  is  typically  used  to get the value of something; the value of a cell in Microsoft
              Excel or the text of a  selection  in  Microsoft  Word.  <u>service</u>  is  typically  the  name  of  an
              application,  <u>topic</u>  is  typically  the  name  of  the file, and <u>item</u> is application-specific. The
              command returns the value of <u>item</u> as defined in the application.  Normally this is interpreted  to
              be  a  string  with  terminating  null.  If <b>-binary</b> is specified, the result is returned as a byte
              array.

       <b>dde</b> <b>services</b> <u>service</u> <u>topic</u>
              <b>dde</b> <b>services</b> returns a list of service-topic pairs that currently exist on the machine. If <u>service</u>
              and <u>topic</u> are both empty strings ({}), then all service-topic pairs  currently  available  on  the
              system  are  returned.  If <u>service</u> is empty and <u>topic</u> is not, then all services with the specified
              topic are returned. If <u>service</u> is non-empty and <u>topic</u> is, all  topics  for  a  given  service  are
              returned.  If  both  are  non-empty,  if that service-topic pair currently exists, it is returned;
              otherwise, an empty string is returned.

       <b>dde</b> <b>eval</b> ?<b>-async</b>? <u>topic</u> <u>cmd</u> ?<u>arg</u> <u>arg</u> <u>...</u>?
              <b>dde</b> <b>eval</b> evaluates a command and its arguments using the interpreter specified by <u>topic</u>.  The  DDE
              service  must  be  the  <b>TclEval</b> service.  The <b>-async</b> option requests asynchronous invocation.  The
              command returns an error message if the script did not run, unless the <b>-async</b> flag  was  used,  in
              which  case  the  command  returns immediately with no error.  This command can be used to replace
              send on Windows.

</pre><h4><b>DDE</b> <b>AND</b> <b>TCL</b></h4><pre>
       A Tcl interpreter always has a service name of <b>TclEval</b>.  Each different interpreter of  all  running  Tcl
       applications  must  be given a unique name specified by <b>dde</b> <b>servername</b>. Each interp is available as a DDE
       topic only if the <b>dde</b> <b>servername</b> command was used to set the name of the topic for each interp. So a  <b>dde</b>
       <b>services</b>  <b>TclEval</b>  <b>{}</b>  command  will  return  a  list of service-topic pairs, where each of the currently
       running interps will be a topic.

       When Tcl processes a <b>dde</b> <b>execute</b> command, the data for the execute is run as a script in the interp named
       by the topic of the <b>dde</b> <b>execute</b> command.

       When Tcl processes a <b>dde</b> <b>request</b> command, it returns the value of the variable given in the  dde  command
       in  the  context  of the interp named by the dde topic. Tcl reserves the variable <b>$TCLEVAL$EXECUTE$RESULT</b>
       for internal use, and <b>dde</b> <b>request</b> commands for that variable will give unpredictable results.

       An external application which wishes to run a script in Tcl should have that script store its result in a
       variable, run the <b>dde</b> <b>execute</b> command, and then run <b>dde</b> <b>request</b> to get the value of the variable.

       When using DDE, be careful to ensure that the event queue is flushed using either <b>update</b> or <b>vwait</b>.   This
       happens by default when using <b>wish</b> unless a blocking command is called (such as <b>exec</b> without adding the <b>&amp;</b>
       to  place the process in the background).  If for any reason the event queue is not flushed, DDE commands
       may hang until the event queue is flushed.  This can create a deadlock situation.

       This asks Internet Explorer (which must already be running) to go to a particularly important website:

              package require dde
