</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::Replicated::Replicant - A replicated DBI Storage Role

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       This class is used internally by DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::Replicated.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Replicants are DBI Storages that follow a master DBI Storage.  Typically this is accomplished via an
       external replication system.  Please see the documents for DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::Replicated for more
       details.

       This class exists to define methods of a DBI Storage that only make sense when it's a classic 'slave' in
       a pool of slave databases which replicate from a given master database.

</pre><h4><b>ATTRIBUTES</b></h4><pre>
       This class defines the following attributes.

   <b>active</b>
       This is a boolean which allows you to programmatically activate or deactivate a replicant from the pool.
       This way you can do stuff like disallow a replicant when it gets too far behind the master, if it stops
       replicating, etc.

       This attribute DOES NOT reflect a replicant's internal status, i.e. if it is properly replicating from a
       master and has not fallen too many seconds behind a reliability threshold. For that, use "is_replicating"
       in DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::Replicated and "lag_behind_master" in
       DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::Replicated.  Since the implementation of those functions database specific
       (and not all DBIC supported DBs support replication) you should refer your database-specific storage
       driver for more information.

   <b>master</b>
       Reference to the master Storage.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       This class defines the following methods.

   <b>debugobj</b>
       Override the debugobj method to redirect this method call back to the master.
