</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       PDF::Builder::Resource::XObject::Image::PNG_IPL - support routines for PNG image library (using
       Image::PNG::Libpng).  Inherits from PDF::Builder::Resource::XObject::Image

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>new</b>
           $res = PDF::Builder::Resource::XObject::Image::PNG_IPL-&gt;new($pdf, $file, %opts)

           Returns a PNG-image object. $pdf is the PDF object being added to, $file is the input PNG file, and
           the optional $name of the new parent image object defaults to PxAAA.

           If the Image::PNG::Libpng package is installed, and its use is not suppressed via the "nouseIPL" flag
           (see Builder documentation for "image_png"), the PNG_IPL library will be used. Otherwise, the PNG
           library will be used instead.

           <b>opts:</b>

           'notrans' =&gt; 1
               No transparency -- ignore tRNS chunk if provided, ignore Alpha channel if provided.

           'force8bps' =&gt; 1
               If  the  PNG  source  is  16bps,  tell  the  libpng  library  to strip down all channels to 8bps,
               permitting use on PDF 1.4 output.

           'name' =&gt; 'string'
               This is the name you can give for the PNG image object. The default is Pxnnnn.

           Remember that you need to use Builder.pm's image_png to process PNG images.

   <b>Supported</b> <b>PNG</b> <b>types</b>
          (0) Gray scale of depth 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16 bits per pixel (2, 4, 16, 256,
              or 65536 gray levels). Full transparency (of one 16-bit gray value)
              via the tRNS chunk is allowed, unless the notrans option specifies
              that it be ignored.

          (2) RGB truecolor with 8 or 16 bits per sample (3 samples: 16.7 million
              or 281.5 trillion colors). Full transparency (of one 3x16-bit RGB
              color value) via the tRNS chunk is allowed, unless the notrans
              option specifies that it be ignored.

          (3) Palette color with 1, 2, 4, or 8 bits per pixel (2, 4, 16, or 256
              color table/palette entries). 16 bpp is not currently supported by
              PNG or PDF. Partial transparency (8-bit Alpha) for each palette
              entry via the tRNS chunk is allowed, unless the notrans option
              specifies that it be ignored (all entries fully opaque).

          (4) Gray scale of depth 8 or 16 bits per pixel plus equal-sized Alpha
              channel (256 or 65536 gray levels and 256 or 65536 levels of
              transparency). The Alpha channel is ignored if the notrans
              option is given. The tRNS chunk is not permitted.

          (5) B&lt;RESERVED&gt; for grayscale via palette + Alpha channel

          (6) RGB truecolor with 8 or 16 bits per sample, with equal-sized
              Alpha channel (256 or 65536 levels of transparency). The Alpha
              channel is ignored if the notrans option is given. The tRNS
              chunk is not permitted.

          (7) B&lt;RESERVED&gt; for truecolor via palette + Alpha channel

       In all cases, 16 bits per sample forces PDF 1.5 (or higher)  output,  unless  you  give  the  "force8bps"
       option,  to "strip" 16 bit samples to 8 bits, and permit PDF 1.4-compatible output.  The libpng.a library
       is assuming standard "network" bit and byte ordering (Big Endian),  although  flags  might  be  added  to
       change this.

       The  transparency  chunk  (tRNS)  will  specify  one  gray  level entry or one RGB entry to be treated as
       transparent (Alpha = 0). For palette color, up to 256 palette entry 8-bit Alpha values are specified (256
       levels of transparency, from 0 = transparent to 255 = opaque).

       Only a limited number of chunks are handled: IHDR, IDAT (internally), PLTE, tRNS, and IEND  (internally).
       All  other chunks are ignored at this time. Filters and compression applied to data is handled internally
       by libpng.a -- there may be unsupported methods.

   <b>usesLib</b>
           $mode = $png-&gt;usesLib()

           Returns 1 if Image::PNG::Libpng installed and used, 0 if not installed, or -1 if  installed  but  not
           used (nouseIPL option given to "image_png").

           <b>Caution:</b>  this  method  can  only  be used <u>after</u> the image object has been created. It can't tell you
           whether Image::PNG::Libpng is available in advance of actually using it, in case you want to use some
           functionality available only in PNG_IPL. See the PDF::Builder <b>LA_IPL()</b> call if you need  to  know  in
           advance.
