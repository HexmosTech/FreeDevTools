</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       PDF::Builder::Resource::XObject::Image::PNG - support routines for PNG image library (using pure Perl
       code).  Inherits from PDF::Builder::Resource::XObject::Image

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>new</b>
           $res = PDF::Builder::Resource::XObject::Image::PNG-&gt;new($pdf, $file, %opts)

           Returns a PNG-image object. $pdf is the PDF object being added to, $file is the input PNG file, and
           the optional $name of the new parent image object defaults to PxAAA.

           If the Image::PNG::Libpng package is installed, the PNG_IPL library will be used instead of the PNG
           library. In such a case, use of the PNG library may be forced via the "nouseIPL" flag (see Builder
           documentation for "image_png()").

           <b>opts:</b>

           'notrans' =&gt; 1
               No transparency -- ignore tRNS chunk if provided, ignore Alpha channel if provided.

           'name' =&gt; 'string'
               This is the name you can give for the PNG image object. The default is Pxnnnn.

           Remember  that  you  need  to  invoke  the  image_png  method  from  Builder.pm  in order to use this
           functionality.

   <b>Supported</b> <b>PNG</b> <b>types</b>
          (0) Gray scale of depth 1, 2, 4, or 8 bits per pixel (2, 4, 16, or 256
              gray levels). 16 bpp is not currently supported (a PNG with 16 bpp
              is a fatal error). Full transparency (of one 8-bit gray value) via
              the tRNS chunk is allowed, unless the notrans option specifies
              that it be ignored.

          (2) RGB 24-bit truecolor with 8 bits per sample (16.7 million colors).
              16 bps is not currently supported (a PNG with 16 bps is a fatal
              error). Full transparency (of one 3x8-bit RGB color value) via the
              tRNS chunk is allowed, unless the notrans option specifies that it
              be ignored.

          (3) Palette color with 1, 2, 4, or 8 bits per pixel (2, 4, 16, or 256
              color table/palette entries). 16 bpp is not currently supported by
              PNG or PDF. Partial transparency (8-bit Alpha) for each palette
              entry via the tRNS chunk is allowed, unless the notrans option
              specifies that it be ignored (all entries fully opaque).

          (4) Gray scale of depth 8 bits per pixel plus 8-bit Alpha channel (256
              gray levels and 256 levels of transparency). 16 bpp is not
              currently supported (a PNG with 16 bpp is a fatal error). The Alpha
              channel is ignored if the notrans option is given. The tRNS chunk
              is not permitted.

          (6) RGB 24-bit truecolor with 8 bits per sample (16.7 million colors)
              plus 8-bit Alpha channel (256 levels of transparency). 16 bps is not
              currently supported (a PNG with 16 bps is a fatal error). The Alpha
              channel is ignored if the notrans option is given. The tRNS chunk
              is not permitted.

       In all cases, 16 bits per sample are not implemented. A fatal error will be returned if a PNG image  with
       16-bps  data  is  supplied. The code is assuming standard "network" bit ordering (Big Endian). Interlaced
       (progressive) display images are not supported. Use the PNG_IPL version if you need to support 16 bps  or
       interlaced images.

       The  transparency  chunk  (tRNS)  will  specify  one  gray  level entry or one RGB entry to be treated as
       transparent (Alpha = 0). For palette color, up to 256 palette entry 8-bit Alpha values are specified (256
       levels of transparency, from 0 = transparent to 255 = opaque).

       Only a limited number of chunks are handled: IHDR, IDAT (internally), PLTE, tRNS, and IEND  (internally).
       All  other  chunks  are  ignored  at  this time. Certain filters and compressions applied to data will be
       handled, but there may be unsupported methods.

   <b>usesLib</b>
           $mode = $png-&gt;usesLib()

           Returns 1 if Image::PNG::Libpng installed and used, 0 if not installed, or -1 if  installed  but  not
           used (nouseIPL option given to "image_png").

           <b>Caution:</b>  this  method  can  only  be used <u>after</u> the image object has been created. It can't tell you
           whether Image::PNG::Libpng is available in advance of actually using it, in case you want to use some
           functionality available only in PNG_IPL. See the PDF::Builder <b>LA_IPL()</b> call if you need  to  know  in
           advance.
