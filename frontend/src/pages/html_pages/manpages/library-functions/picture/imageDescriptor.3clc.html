</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       imageDescriptor - The image descriptor structure describes the type and dimensions of the image or image
       array and is defined as:

       typedef struct _cl_image_desc { cl_mem_object_type
       image_type; size_t image_width; size_t image_height;
       size_t image_depth; size_t image_array_size; size_t
       image_row_pitch; size_t image_slice_pitch; cl_uint
       num_mip_levels; cl_uint num_samples; cl_mem buffer; }
       cl_image_desc;

</pre><h4><b>MEMBERS</b></h4><pre>
       image_type
           Describes the image type and must be either <b>CL_MEM_OBJECT_IMAGE1D</b>, <b>CL_MEM_OBJECT_IMAGE1D_BUFFER</b>,
           <b>CL_MEM_OBJECT_IMAGE1D_ARRAY</b>, <b>CL_MEM_OBJECT_IMAGE2D</b>, <b>CL_MEM_OBJECT_IMAGE2D_ARRAY</b>, or
           <b>CL_MEM_OBJECT_IMAGE3D</b>.

       image_width
           The width of the image in pixels. For a 2D image and image array, the image width must be ≤
           <b>CL_DEVICE_IMAGE2D_MAX_WIDTH</b>. For a 3D image, the image width must be ≤ <b>CL_DEVICE_IMAGE3D_MAX_WIDTH</b>.
           For a 1D image buffer, the image width must be ≤ <b>CL_DEVICE_IMAGE_MAX_BUFFER_SIZE</b>. For a 1D image and
           1D image array, the image width must be ≤ <b>CL_DEVICE_IMAGE2D_MAX_WIDTH</b>.

       image_height
           The height of the image in pixels. This is only used if the image is a 2D, 3D or 2D image array. For
           a 2D image or image array, the image height must be ≤ <b>CL_DEVICE_IMAGE2D_MAX_HEIGHT</b>. For a 3D image,
           the image height must be ≤ <b>CL_DEVICE_IMAGE3D_MAX_HEIGHT</b>.

       image_depth
           The depth of the image in pixels. This is only used if the image is a 3D image and must be a value ≥
           1 and ≤ <b>CL_DEVICE_IMAGE3D_MAX_DEPTH</b>.

       image_array_size
           The number of images in the image array. This is only used if the image is a 1D or 2D image array.
           The values for <u>image_array_size</u>, if specified, must be a value ≥ 1 and ≤
           <b>CL_DEVICE_IMAGE_MAX_ARRAY_SIZE</b>.

           Note that reading and writing 2D image arrays from a kernel with <u>image_array_size</u> = 1 may be lower
           performance than 2D images.

       image_row_pitch
           The scan-line pitch in bytes. This must be 0 if <u>host_ptr</u> is NULL and can be either 0 or ≥ image_width
           * size of element in bytes if <u>host_ptr</u> is not NULL. If <u>host_ptr</u> is not NULL and <u>image_row_pitch</u> = 0,
           <u>image_row_pitch</u> is calculated as <u>image_width</u> * size of element in bytes. If <u>image_row_pitch</u> is not 0,
           it must be a multiple of the image element size in bytes.

       image_slice_pitch
           The size in bytes of each 2D slice in the 3D image or the size in bytes of each image in a 1D or 2D
           image array. This must be 0 if <u>host_ptr</u> is NULL. If <u>host_ptr</u> is not NULL, <u>image_slice_pitch</u> can be
           either 0 or ≥ <u>image_row_pitch</u> * <u>image_height</u> for a 2D image array or 3D image and can be either 0 or
           ≥ <u>image_row_pitch</u> for a 1D image array. If <u>host_ptr</u> is not NULL and <u>image_slice_pitch</u> = 0,
           <u>image_slice_pitch</u> is calculated as <u>image_row_pitch</u> * <u>image_height</u> for a 2D image array or 3D image
           and <u>image_row_pitch</u> for a 1D image array. If <u>image_slice_pitch</u> is not 0, it must be a multiple of the
           <u>image_row_pitch</u>.

       num_mip_level, num_samples
           , Must be 0.

       buffer
           Refers to a valid buffer memory object if <u>image_type</u> is <b>CL_MEM_OBJECT_IMAGE1D_BUFFER</b>. Otherwise it
           must be NULL. For a 1D image buffer object, the image pixels are taken from the buffer object's data
           store. When the contents of a buffer object's data store are modified, those changes are reflected in
           the contents of the 1D image buffer object and vice-versa at corresponding sychronization points. The
           <u>image_width</u> * size of element in bytes must be ≤ size of buffer object data store.

</pre><h4><b>NOTE</b></h4><pre>
       Concurrent reading from, writing to and copying between both a buffer object and 1D image buffer object
       associated with the buffer object is undefined. Only reading from both a buffer object and 1D image
       buffer object associated with the buffer object is defined.
