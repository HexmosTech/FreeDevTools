       Image::Xpm - Load, create, manipulate and save xpm image files.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Image::Xpm;

           my $j = Image::Xpm-&gt;new(-file, 'Camel.xpm');

           my $i = Image::Xpm-&gt;new(-width =&gt; 10, -height =&gt; 16);

           my $h = $i-&gt;new; # Copy of $i

           $i-&gt;xy(5, 8, 'red');       # Set a colour (&amp; add to palette if necessary)
           print $i-&gt;xy(9, 3);        # Get a colour

           $i-&gt;xy(120, 130, '#1256DD');
           $i-&gt;xy(120, 130, $i-&gt;rgb2colour(66, 0x4D, 31));

           $i-&gt;vec(24, '#808080');    # Set a colour using a vector offset
           print $i-&gt;<a href="../man24/vec.24.html">vec</a>(24);         # Get a colour using a vector offset

           print $i-&gt;get(-width);     # Get and set object attributes
           $i-&gt;set(-height, 15);

           $i-&gt;load('test.xpm');
           $i-&gt;save;

           # Changing just the palette
           $i-&gt;add_colours(qw(red green blue #123456 #C0C0C0));
           $i-&gt;del_colour('blue');

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This class module provides basic load, manipulate and save functionality for the xpm file format. It
       inherits from "Image::Base" which provides additional manipulation functionality, e.g.
       "new_from_image()". See the "Image::Base" pod for information on adding your own functionality to all the
       Image::Base derived classes.

   <b>new()</b>
           my $i = Image::Xpm-&gt;new(-file =&gt; 'test.xpm');
           my $j = Image::Xpm-&gt;new(-width =&gt; 12, -height =&gt; 18);
           my $k = $i-&gt;new;

       We can create a new xpm image by reading in a file, or by creating an image from scratch (all the pixels
       are white by default), or by copying an image object that we created earlier.

       If we set "-file" then all the other arguments are ignored (since they're taken from the file). If we
       don't specify a file, "-width" and "-height" are mandatory and "-cpp" will default to 1 unless specified
       otherwise.

       "-file"
           The  name  of  the  file  to read when creating the image. May contain a full path.  This is also the
           default name used for "load"ing and "save"ing, though it can be overridden when you load or save.

       "-width"
           The width of the image; taken from the file or set when the object is created; read-only.

       "-height"
           The height of the image; taken from the file or set when the object is created; read-only.

       "-cpp"
           Characters per pixel. Commonly 1 or 2, default is 1 for images created by the module; read-only.

           See the example for how to change an image's cpp.

       "-hotx"
           The x-coord of the image's hotspot; taken from the file or set when the object is created. Set to  -1
           if there is no hotspot.

       "-hoty"
           The  y-coord of the image's hotspot; taken from the file or set when the object is created. Set to -1
           if there is no hotspot.

       "-ncolours"
           The number of unique colours in the palette. The image may not be using all of them; read-only.

       "-cindex"
           An hash whose keys are colour names, e.g. '#123456' or 'blue' and whose values are the palette names,
           e.g. ' ', '#', etc; read-only. If you want to add more colours  to  the  image  itself  simply  write
           pixels  with  the  new  colours  using  "xy";  if you want to add more colours to the palette without
           necessarily using them in the image use "add_colours".

       "-palette"
           A hash whose keys are the palette names, e.g. ' ', '#', etc. and whose values are  hashes  of  colour
           type  x  colour  name  pairs, e.g. "c =&gt; red", etc; read-only. If you want to add more colours to the
           image itself simply write pixels with the new colours using "xy"; if you want to add more colours  to
           the palette without necessarily using them in the image use "add_colours".

       "-pixels"
           A string of palette names which constitutes the data for the image itself; read-only.

       "-extname"
           The name of the extension text if any; commonly XPMEXT; read-only.

       "-extlines"
           The lines of text of any extensions; read-only.

       "-comments"
           An array (possibly empty) of comment lines that were in a file that was read in; they will be written
           out although we make no guarantee regarding their placement; read-only.

   <b>get()</b>
           my $width = $i-&gt;get(-width);
           my ($hotx, $hoty) = $i-&gt;get(-hotx, -hoty);

       Get any of the object's attributes. Multiple attributes may be requested in a single call.

       See "xy" and "vec" to get/set colours of the image itself.

   <b>set()</b>
           $i-&gt;set(-hotx =&gt; 120, -hoty =&gt; 32);

       Set  any of the object's attributes. Multiple attributes may be set in a single call; some attributes are
       read-only.

       See "xy" and "vec" to get/set colours of the image itself.

   <b>xy()</b>
           $i-&gt;xy(4, 11, '#123454');    # Set the colour at point 4,11
           my $v = $i-&gt;xy(9, 17);       # Get the colour at point 9,17

       Get/set colours using x, y coordinates; coordinates start at 0. If the  colour  does  not  exist  in  the
       palette it will be added automatically.

       When  called to set the colour the value returned is characters used for that colour in the palette; when
       called to get the colour the value returned is the colour name, e.g. 'blue' or '#f0f0f0', etc, e.g.

           $colour = xy($x, $y);            # e.g. #123456
           $cc     = xy($x, $y, $colour);   # e.g. !

       We don't normally pick up the return value when setting the colour.

   <b>vec()</b>
           $i-&gt;vec(43, 0);      # Unset the bit at offset 43
           my $v = $i-&gt;<a href="../man87/vec.87.html">vec</a>(87); # Get the bit at offset 87

       Get/set bits using vector offsets; offsets start at 0. The offset of a pixel is ((y * width * cpp) + (x *
       cpp)).

       The sort of return value depends on whether we are reading (getting) or writing (setting)  the  colour  -
       see "xy" for an explanation.

   <b>rgb2colour()</b> <b>and</b> <b>rgb2color()</b>
           $i-&gt;rgb2colour(0xff, 0x40, 0x80);    # Returns #ff4080
           Image::Xpm-&gt;rgb2colour(10, 20, 30);  # Returns #0a141e

       Convenience class or object methods which accept three integers and return a colour name string.

   <b>load()</b>
           $i-&gt;load;
           $i-&gt;load('test.xpm');

       Load  the  image  whose  name  is  given, or if none is given load the image whose name is in the "-file"
       attribute.

   <b>save()</b>
           $i-&gt;save;
           $i-&gt;save('test.xpm');

       Save the image using the name given, or if none is given save the image using the  name  in  the  "-file"
       attribute. The image is saved in xpm format.

   <b>add_colours()</b> <b>and</b> <b>add_colors()</b>
           $i-&gt;add_colours(qw(#C0C0DD red blue #123456));

       These  are  for  adding  colours to the palette; you don't need to use them to set a pixel's colour - use
       "xy" for that.

       Add one or more colour names either as hex strings or as literal colour names.  These are always added as
       type 'c' colours; duplicates are ignored.

       NB If you just want to set some pixels in colours that may not be in the palette, simply do so using "xy"
       since new colours are added automatically.

   <b>del_colour()</b> <b>and</b> <b>del_color()</b>
           $i-&gt;del_colour('green');

       Delete a colour from the palette; returns undef if the colour isn't in the  palette,  false  (0)  if  the
       colour  is  in the palette but also in the image, or true (1) if the colour has been deleted (i.e. it was
       in the palette but not in use in the image).

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Changing</b> <b>the</b> <b>-cpp</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>image:</b>

           my $j = $i-&gt;new_from_image('Image::xpm', -cpp =&gt; 2);
           $j-&gt;save('test2.xpm');

           # Could have written 2nd line above as:
           my $j = $i-&gt;new_from_image(ref $i, -cpp =&gt; 2);
