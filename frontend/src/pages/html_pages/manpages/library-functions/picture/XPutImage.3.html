</pre><h4><b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>d</u>         Specifies the drawable.

       <u>dest_image</u>
                 Specifies the destination image.

       <u>dest_x</u>
       <u>dest_y</u>    Specify  the  x and y coordinates, which are relative to the origin of the drawable and are the

                 specify  its  upper-left  corner, and determine where the subimage is placed in the destination
                 image.

       <u>display</u>   Specifies the connection to the X server.

       <u>format</u>    Specifies the format for the image.  You can pass <b>XYPixmap</b> or <b>ZPixmap</b>.

       <u>gc</u>        Specifies the GC.

       <u>image</u>     Specifies the image you want combined with the rectangle.

       <u>plane_mask</u>
                 Specifies the plane mask.

       <u>src_x</u>     Specifies the offset in X from the left edge of the image defined by the <b>XImage</b> structure.

       <u>src_y</u>     Specifies the offset in Y from the top edge of the image defined by the <b>XImage</b> structure.

       <u>width</u>
       <u>height</u>    Specify the width and height of the subimage, which define the dimensions of the rectangle.

       <u>x</u>
       <u>y</u>         Specify the x and y coordinates, which are relative to the origin of the  drawable  and  define
                 the upper-left corner of the rectangle.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>XPutImage</b> function combines an image with a rectangle of the specified drawable.  The section of the
       image defined by the src_x, src_y, width, and height arguments is drawn on  the  specified  part  of  the
       drawable.   If  <b>XYBitmap</b> format is used, the depth of the image must be one, or a <b>BadMatch</b> error results.
       The foreground pixel in the GC defines the source for the one bits in the image, and the background pixel
       defines the source for the zero bits.  For <b>XYPixmap</b> and <b>ZPixmap</b>, the depth of the image  must  match  the
       depth of the drawable, or a <b>BadMatch</b> error results.

       If the characteristics of the image (for example, byte_order and bitmap_unit) differ from what the server
       requires, <b>XPutImage</b> automatically makes the appropriate conversions.

       This  function  uses  these  GC  components: function, plane-mask, subwindow-mode, clip-x-origin, clip-y-
       origin, and clip-mask.  It also uses these GC mode-dependent components: foreground and background.

       <b>XPutImage</b> can generate <b>BadDrawable</b>, <b>BadGC</b>, <b>BadMatch</b>, and <b>BadValue</b> errors.

       The <b>XGetImage</b> function returns a pointer to an <b>XImage</b> structure.  This structure provides  you  with  the
       contents of the specified rectangle of the drawable in the format you specify.  If the format argument is
       <b>XYPixmap</b>,  the  image  contains  only  the  bit  planes  you  passed  to the plane_mask argument.  If the
       plane_mask argument only requests a subset of the planes of the display, the depth of the returned  image
       will be the number of planes requested.  If the format argument is <b>ZPixmap</b>, <b>XGetImage</b> returns as zero the
       bits  in all planes not specified in the plane_mask argument.  The function performs no range checking on
       the values in plane_mask and ignores extraneous bits.

       <b>XGetImage</b> returns the depth of the image to the depth member of the <b>XImage</b> structure.  The depth  of  the
       image  is  as  specified  when  the  drawable  was created, except when getting a subset of the planes in
       <b>XYPixmap</b> format, when the depth is given by the number of bits set to 1 in plane_mask.

       If the drawable is a pixmap, the given rectangle must  be  wholly  contained  within  the  pixmap,  or  a
       <b>BadMatch</b>  error  results.   If  the drawable is a window, the window must be viewable, and it must be the
       case that if there were no inferiors or overlapping windows, the specified rectangle of the window  would
       be fully visible on the screen and wholly contained within the outside edges of the window, or a <b>BadMatch</b>
       error  results.   Note that the borders of the window can be included and read with this request.  If the
       window has backing-store, the backing-store contents are returned for regions  of  the  window  that  are
       obscured  by  noninferior  windows.   If the window does not have backing-store, the returned contents of
       such obscured regions are undefined.  The  returned  contents  of  visible  regions  of  inferiors  of  a
       different  depth  than  the specified window's depth are also undefined.  The pointer cursor image is not
       included in the returned contents.  If a problem occurs, <b>XGetImage</b> returns NULL.

       <b>XGetImage</b> can generate <b>BadDrawable</b>, <b>BadMatch</b>, and <b>BadValue</b> errors.

       The <b>XGetSubImage</b> function updates dest_image with the specified subimage in the same manner as <b>XGetImage</b>.
       If the format argument is <b>XYPixmap</b>, the image contains only the bit planes you passed to  the  plane_mask
       argument.   If  the  format  argument is <b>ZPixmap</b>, <b>XGetSubImage</b> returns as zero the bits in all planes not
       specified in the plane_mask argument.   The  function  performs  no  range  checking  on  the  values  in
       plane_mask  and  ignores  extraneous  bits.  As a convenience, <b>XGetSubImage</b> returns a pointer to the same
       <b>XImage</b> structure specified by dest_image.

       The depth of the destination <b>XImage</b> structure must be the same as that of the drawable.  If the specified
       subimage does not fit at the specified location on the destination image, the right and bottom edges  are
       clipped.  If the drawable is a pixmap, the given rectangle must be wholly contained within the pixmap, or
       a  <b>BadMatch</b>  error results.  If the drawable is a window, the window must be viewable, and it must be the
       case that if there were no inferiors or overlapping windows, the specified rectangle of the window  would
       be fully visible on the screen and wholly contained within the outside edges of the window, or a <b>BadMatch</b>
       error results.  If the window has backing-store, then the backing-store contents are returned for regions
       of  the  window that are obscured by noninferior windows.  If the window does not have backing-store, the
       returned contents of such obscured regions are undefined.  The returned contents of  visible  regions  of
       inferiors  of  a  different  depth  than  the  specified window's depth are also undefined.  If a problem
       occurs, <b>XGetSubImage</b> returns NULL.

       <b>XGetSubImage</b> can generate <b>BadDrawable</b>, <b>BadGC</b>, <b>BadMatch</b>, and <b>BadValue</b> errors.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>BadDrawable</b>
                 A value for a Drawable argument does not name a defined Window or Pixmap.

       <b>BadGC</b>     A value for a GContext argument does not name a defined GContext.

       <b>BadMatch</b>  An <b>InputOnly</b> window is used as a Drawable.

       <b>BadMatch</b>  Some argument or pair of arguments has the correct type and range but fails to  match  in  some
                 other way required by the request.

       <b>BadValue</b>  Some  numeric  value  falls  outside  the  range  of  values accepted by the request.  Unless a
                 specific range is specified for an argument, the full range defined by the argument's  type  is
                 accepted.  Any argument defined as a set of alternatives can generate this error.
