       PDF::Builder::Resource::XObject::Image::PNM - Support routines for PNM (Portable aNy Map) image library

       Inherits from PDF::Builder::Resource::XObject::Image

   <b>METHODS</b>
   <b>new</b>
           $res = PDF::Builder::Resource::XObject::Image::PNM-&gt;new($pdf, $file, %opts)

           Options:

           'name' =&gt; 'string'
               This is the name you can give for the PNM image object. The default is Nxnnnn.

           'compress' =&gt; 1
               This  is  the  compression you can give for the PNM image object. Any value will cause the use of
               <u>Flate</u> compression, otherwise ("compress" not given), <u>ASCIIHexDecode</u> is used.

       Returns an image in the PDF. PNM types 1 (ASCII/plain bi-level/PBM),  2  (ASCII/plain  grayscale/PGM),  3
       (ASCII/plain  RGB/PPM),  4  (binary/raw  bi-level/PBM),  5  (binary/raw grayscale/PGM), and 6 (binary/raw
       RGB/PPM) are supported.

       For bi-level, only values 0/1 (white/black) are supported. For grayscale, the maximum sample (full white)
       may be anything from 1 to 65535, with 0 being full black. If the maximum sample value is 255 or  smaller,
       one  byte of raw binary data per pixel, otherwise two bytes. For RGB, each sample (full-on of that color)
       may be anything from 1 to 65535 (the same maximum for all three colors), with 0 being full black. If  the
       maximum sample value is 255 or smaller, three bytes of raw binary data per pixel, otherwise six bytes.

       Remember that you need to use Builder.pm's image_pnm method to use this functionality.
