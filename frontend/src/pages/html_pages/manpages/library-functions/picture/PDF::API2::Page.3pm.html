       PDF::API2::Page - Methods to interact with individual pages

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           my $pdf = PDF::API2-&gt;new();

           # Add a page to a new or existing PDF
           my $page = $pdf-&gt;page();

           # Set the page size
           $page-&gt;size('letter');

           # Set prepress page boundaries
           $page-&gt;boundaries(media =&gt; '12x18', trim =&gt; 0.5 * 72);

           # Add an image
           my $image = $pdf-&gt;image('/path/to/file.jpg');
           $page-&gt;object($image, $x, $y, $w, $h);

           # Add textual content
           my $text = $page-&gt;text();

           # Add graphical content (paths and shapes)
           my $canvas = $page-&gt;graphics();

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>size</b>
           # Set the page size using a common name
           $page-&gt;size('letter');

           # Set the page size using coordinates in points (X1, Y1, X2, Y2)
           $page-&gt;size([0, 0, 612, 792]);

           # Get the page coordinates in points
           my @rectangle = $page-&gt;size();

       Set the physical page size (a.k.a. media box) when called with an argument.  See "Page Sizes" below for
       possible values.  Returns the $page object.

       Returns the coordinates of the rectangle enclosing the physical page size when called without arguments.

       The size method is a convenient shortcut for setting the PDF's media box when print-related page
       boundaries aren't required.  It's equivalent to the following:

           # Set
           $page = $page-&gt;boundaries(media =&gt; $size);

           # Get
           @rectangle = $page-&gt;boundaries-&gt;{'media'}-&gt;@*;

   <b>boundaries</b>
           # Set
           $page-&gt;boundaries(
               media =&gt; '13x19',
               bleed =&gt; [0.75 * 72, 0.75 * 72, 12.25 * 72, 18.25 * 72],
               trim  =&gt; 0.25 * 72,
           );

           # Get
           %boundaries = $page-&gt;boundaries();
           ($x1, $y1, $x2, $y2) = $page-&gt;boundaries('trim');

       Set or replace all prepress page boundaries when called with a hash containing one or more page boundary
       definitions.  Returns the $page object.

       Returns the current page boundaries if called without arguments.  Returns the coordinates for the
       specified page boundary if called with one argument.

       <u>Page</u> <u>Boundaries</u>

       PDF defines five page boundaries.  When creating PDFs for print shops, you'll most commonly use just the
       media box and trim box.  Traditional print shops may also use the bleed box when adding printer's marks
       and other information.

       •   media

           The  media  box defines the boundaries of the physical medium on which the page is to be printed.  It
           may include any extended area surrounding the finished page for bleed, printing marks, or other  such
           purposes.  The default value is a US letter page (8.5" x 11").

       •   crop

           The  crop  box  defines  the region to which the contents of the page shall be clipped (cropped) when
           displayed or printed.  The default value is the page's media box.

           This is a historical page boundary.  You'll likely want to set the bleed and/or trim boxes instead.

       •   bleed

           The bleed box defines the region to which the contents of the page shall be clipped when output in  a
           production  environment.   This  may  include any extra bleed area needed to accommodate the physical
           limitations of cutting, folding, and trimming equipment.  The actual printed  page  (media  box)  may
           include printing marks that fall outside the bleed box.  The default value is the page's crop box.

       •   trim

           The  trim box defines the intended dimensions of the finished page after trimming.  It may be smaller
           than the media box to allow for production-related content, such as printing instructions, cut marks,
           or color bars.  The default value is the page's crop box.

       •   art

           The art box defines the extent of the page's meaningful content (including potential white space)  as
           intended by the page's creator.  The default value is the page's crop box.

       <u>Page</u> <u>Sizes</u>

       PDF page sizes are stored as rectangle coordinates.  For convenience, PDF::API2 also supports a number of
       aliases and shortcuts that are more human-friendly.

       The following formats are available:

       •   a standard paper size

               $page-&gt;boundaries(media =&gt; 'A4');

           Aliases for the most common paper sizes are built in (case-insensitive).

           US: Letter, Legal, Ledger, Tabloid

           Metric: 4A0, 2A0, A0 - A6, 4B0, 2B0, and B0 - B6

       •   a "WxH" string in inches

               $page-&gt;boundaries(media =&gt; '8.5x11');

           Many US paper sizes are commonly identified by their size in inches rather than by a particular name.
           These can be passed as strings with the width and height separated by an "x".

           Examples: "4x6", "12x18", "8.5x11"

       •   a number (in points) representing a reduction from the next-larger box

               # Note: There are 72 points per inch
               $page-&gt;boundaries(media =&gt; '12x18', trim =&gt; 0.5 * 72);

               # Equivalent
               $page-&gt;boundaries(media =&gt; [0,        0,        12   * 72, 18   * 72],
                                 trim  =&gt; [0.5 * 72, 0.5 * 72, 11.5 * 72, 17.5 * 72]);

           This  example  shows  a 12" x 18" physical sheet that will be reduced to a final size of 11" x 17" by
           trimming 0.5" from each edge.  The smaller boundary is assumed to be centered on the larger one.

           The "next-larger box" follows this order, stopping at the first defined value:

               art -&gt; trim -&gt; bleed -&gt; media

               crop -&gt; media

           This option isn't available for the media box since it is by definition the largest boundary.

       •   [$width, $height] in points

               $page-&gt;boundaries(media =&gt; [8.5 * 72, 11 * 7.2]);

           For other page or boundary sizes, the width and height (in points) can be given directly as an array.

       •   [$x1, $y1, $x2, $y2] in points

               $page-&gt;boundaries(media =&gt; [0, 0, 8.5 * 72, 11 * 72]);

           Finally, the raw coordinates of  the  bottom-left  and  top-right  corners  of  a  rectangle  can  be
           specified.

   <b>rotation</b>
           $page = $page-&gt;rotation($degrees);

       Rotates  the  page  clockwise  when  displayed  or printed.  $degrees must be a multiple of 90 and may be
       negative for counter-clockwise rotation.

       The coordinate system follows the page rotation.  In other words, after rotating the  page  180  degrees,
       [0,  0]  will  be in the top right corner of the page rather than the bottom left, X will increase to the
       right, and Y will increase downward.

       To create a landscape page without moving the origin, use "size".

   <b>graphics</b>
           my $canvas = $page-&gt;graphics(%options);

       Returns a PDF::API2::Content object for drawing paths and shapes.

       The following options are available:

       •   prepend (boolean)

           If true, place the drawing at the beginning of the page's content stream instead of the end.

       •   compress (boolean)

           Manually specify whether the drawing instructions should be compressed.  If  unspecified,  the  PDF's
           compression setting will be used, which is on by default.

   <b>text</b>
           my $text = $page-&gt;text(%options);

       Returns a PDF::API2::Content object for including textual content.

       The options are the same as the "graphics" method.

   <b>object</b>
           $page = $page-&gt;object($object, $x, $y, $scale_x, $scale_y);

       Places an image or other external object (a.k.a. XObject) on the page in the specified location.

       If $x and $y are omitted, the object will be placed at "[0, 0]".

       For  images, $scale_x and $scale_y represent the width and height of the image on the page in points.  If
       $scale_x is omitted, it will default to 72 pixels per inch.  If $scale_y is omitted, the  image  will  be
       scaled proportionally based on the image dimensions.

       For  other  external  objects,  the scale is a multiplier, where 1 (the default) represents 100% (i.e. no
       change).

       If the object to be placed depends on a coordinate transformation (e.g. rotation or skew), first create a
       content object using "graphics", then call "object" in PDF::API2::Content after  making  the  appropriate
       transformations.

   <b>annotation</b>
           my $annotation = $page-&gt;annotation();

       Returns a new PDF::API2::Annotation object.

</pre><h4><b>MIGRATION</b></h4><pre>
       See "MIGRATION" in PDF::API2 for an overview.

       gfx Replace with "graphics".

       rotate
           Replace with "rotation".

       mediabox
       get_mediabox
           Replace  with  "size"  if  not  in  a  print  shop  environment  or "boundaries" if more complex page
           boundaries are needed.

           If using page size aliases (e.g. "letter" or "A4"), check the Page Sizes section to ensure  that  the
           alias you're using is still supported (you'll get an error if it isn't).

       get_bleedbox
       get_trimbox
       get_artbox
           Replace with "boundaries".
