</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Gflash - Allows for storing segments of a picture for insertion into any subsequent picture.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       GFLAS1 - Starts storage of plotting instructions.

       GFLAS2 - Stops storage of plotting instructions.

       GFLAS3 - Inserts saved plotting instructions into the output stream.

       GFLAS4 - Associates the filename of a previously generated picture segment with an id suitable for use
       with GFLAS3.

</pre><h4><b>C-BINDING</b> <b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;ncarg/ncargC.h&gt;

       c_gflas1
       c_gflas2
       c_gflas3
       c_gflas4

</pre><h4><b>ACCESS</b></h4><pre>
       To use Gflash C or Fortran routines, load the NCAR Graphics libraries ncarg, ncarg_gks, and ncarg_c,
       preferably in that order.

</pre><h4><b>MESSAGES</b></h4><pre>
       When error conditions are detected, the support routine SETER is called in such a way that it writes a
       message to the standard error file (as defined by <a href="../man4/I1MACH.4.html">I1MACH</a>(4)) and then terminates execution. The possible
       error messages are as follows:

       GFLAS1 CALLED CONSECUTIVELY WITHOUT AN INTERVENING GFLAS2 CALL
              You must terminate the usage of one FLASH buffer before reusing it.

       THE NON-NCAR GKS PACKAGE IS NOT LEVEL 2
              Gflash requires GKS level 2A or higher in order to function in a non-NCAR GKS environment.

       WISS MUST BE OPEN BEFORE CALL TO GFLAS1
              Gflash  entries  must  have access to the appropriate GKS segmentation functions in order to work.
              This is accomplished by making a call to the GKS entry GOPWK to open WISS.

       MAXIMUM NUMBER OF OPEN WORKSTATIONS ALLOWED IS 100
              You have called GFLAS1 with more than 100 different identifiers.

       BUFFER IDENTIFIER .LT. 0, OR .GT. 99
              The argument to Gflash is out of the described range.

       GKS MUST BE OPEN BEFORE A CALL TO GFLAS1
              You have tried calling GFLAS1 without opening GKS.  A call to the  GKS  entry  GOPWK  is  required
              before calling any Gflash entry.

       GFLAS2 CALLED WITHOUT CALLING GFLAS1
              GFLAS2  terminates  the  GFLAS1  job  of  writing  plotting  instructions  to disk.  GFLAS2 has no
              functionality if not called in the legal sequence.

       WISS NOT OPEN AT GFLAS2 TIME
              Gflash entries must have access to the appropriate GKS segmentation functions in  order  to  work.
              This is accomplished by making a call to the GKS entry GOPWK to open WISS.

       GFLAS3 CALLED WITHOUT CALLING GFLAS2 OR GFLAS4
              GFLAS3  has  no  access to the plotting instructions that it is to insert into the output metafile
              unless a call to either GFLAS2 or GFLAS4 is made first.

       THE NON-NCAR GKS PACKAGE IS NOT LEVEL 2
              Gflash requires GKS level 2A or higher in order to function in a non-NCAR GKS environment.

       WISS MUST BE OPEN BEFORE A CALL TO GFLAS4
              Gflash entries must have access to the appropriate GKS segmentation functions in  order  to  work.
              This is accomplished by making a call to the GKS entry GOPWK to open WISS.

       MAXIMUM NUMBER OF WORKSTATIONS ALLOWED IS 100
              You have called GFLAS1 with more than 100 different identifiers.

       GKS MUST BE OPEN BEFORE A CALL TO GFLAS4
              You  have tried calling GFLAS4 without opening the NCAR GKS package.  (The GFLAS4 subroutine is an
              option only if you are using the NCAR GKS package.)

       CANNOT BE CALLED WHILE GFLAS1 IS STILL OPEN
              Call GFLAS2 to complete the GFLAS1/GFLAS2 sequence before attempting to call GFLAS4.
