</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Tk::Image - Create and manipulate images

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>$image</u> = <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<u>type</u>(?<u>arg</u> <u>arg</u> <u>...</u>?)

       <u>$image</u>-&gt;<u>method</u>(?<u>arg</u> <u>arg</u> <u>...</u>?)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>image</b> constructors and methods are used to create, delete, and query images.  It can take several
       different forms, depending on the <u>type</u>.

       The constructors require a <u>$widget</u> to invoke them, this is used to locate a <b>MainWindow</b>. (This is because
       the underlying Tk code registers the images in the data structure for the <b>MainWindow</b>.)

       The legal forms are:

       <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<u>type</u>?(?<u>name</u>?,?<u>option</u>=&gt;<u>value</u> <u>...</u>)?
           Creates  a  new image and returns an object.  <u>type</u> specifies the type of the image, which must be one
           of the types currently defined (e.g., <b>Bitmap</b>).  <u>name</u> specifies the name for  the  image;   if  it  is
           omitted  then  Tk picks a name of the form <b>image</b><u>x</u>, where <u>x</u> is an integer.  There may be any number of
           <u>option</u>=&gt;<u>value</u> pairs, which provide configuration options for the new image.  The legal set of options
           is defined separately for each image type;  see below for details on the options for  built-in  image
           types.   If  an image already exists by the given name then it is replaced with the new image and any
           instances of that image will redisplay with the new contents.

       <u>$image</u>-&gt;<b>delete</b>
           Deletes the image <u>$image</u> and returns an empty string.  If there are instances of the image  displayed
           in  widgets,  the  image won't actually be deleted until all of the instances are released.  However,
           the association between the instances and the image manager will be dropped.  Existing instances will
           retain their sizes but redisplay as empty areas.  If a deleted image  is  recreated  (with  the  same
           <u>name</u>) the existing instances will use the new image.

       <u>$image</u>-&gt;<b>height</b>
           Returns a decimal string giving the height of image <u>name</u> in pixels.

       <u>$image</u>-&gt;<b>inuse</b>
           Returns a boolean value indicating whether or not the image is in use by any widgets.

       <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>imageNames</b>
           Returns a list containing all existing images for <u>$widget</u>'s <b>MainWindow</b>.

       <u>$image</u>-&gt;<b>type</b>
           Returns the type of  <u>$image</u> (the value of the <u>type</u> method when the image was created).

       <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>imageTypes</b>
           Returns  a  list whose elements are all of the valid image types (i.e., all of the values that may be
           supplied for the <u>type</u> to create an image).

       <u>$image</u>-&gt;<b>width</b>
           Returns a decimal string giving the width of image <u>name</u> in pixels.

</pre><h4><b>BUILT-IN</b> <b>IMAGE</b> <b>TYPES</b></h4><pre>
       The following image types are defined by Tk so they will be available in any Tk application.   Individual
       applications or extensions may define additional types.

       <b>Bitmap</b>
           Each  pixel in the image displays a foreground color, a background color, or nothing.  See Tk::Bitmap
           for more information.

       <b>Pixmap</b>
           <b>Pixmap</b> is slightly more general than <b>Bitmap</b>, each pixel can be any available color  or  "transparent"
           (rendered as background color of the widget image is displayed in). <b>Pixmap</b> is best used for icons and
           other simple graphics with only a few colors.

           <b>Pixmap</b> is derived from Tix. See Tk::Pixmap for more information.

       <b>Photo</b>
           Displays  a  variety  of  full-color  images,  using dithering to approximate colors on displays with
           limited color capabilities.  See Tk::Photo documentation for more information.

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
       It's necessary to use the "delete" method to delete an image object and free memory associated  with  it.
       Just using a lexical variable for storing the image object and letting the variable to go out of scope or
       setting to "undef" is not sufficient.
