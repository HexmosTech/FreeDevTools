</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       PDF::Builder::Resource::XObject::Image::TIFF_GT - TIFF image support (Graphics::TIFF enabled)

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>new</b>
           $res = PDF::Builder::Resource::XObject::Image::TIFF_GT-&gt;new($pdf, $file, %opts)

           Returns a TIFF-image object. $pdf is the PDF object being added to, $file is the input TIFF file, and
           the optional $name of the new parent image object defaults to IxAAA.

           If the Graphics::TIFF package is installed, and its use is not suppressed via the "nouseGT" flag (see
           Builder documentation for "image_tiff"), the TIFF_GT library will be used. Otherwise, the TIFF
           library will be used instead.

           Options:

           'notrans' =&gt; 1
               Ignore any alpha layer (transparency) and make the image fully opaque.

           'name' =&gt; 'string'
               This is the name you can give for the TIFF image object. The default is Ixnnnn.

           TIFF   support   (when   using   Graphics::TIFF)  is  for  "PhotometricInterpretation"  values  of  0
           (bilevel/gray, white is 0), 1 (bilevel/gray, black  is  0),  2  (RGB),  and  3  (Palette  color).  It
           currently  does  <u>not</u>  support  4  (transparency  mask), 5 (separated CMYK), 6 (YCbCr), 8 (CIELab), or
           higher. There is limited support for an Alpha (transparency) channel (due to extremely  limited  test
           cases).   Some  tags  are  not supported, and a PlanarConfiguration of 2 is unknown until we get some
           test cases.

           Some applications seem to take odd liberties with TIFF tags, such as adding a SamplePerPixel  without
           specifying  ExtraSamples type. In such cases, we treat one extra sample (not otherwise defined) as an
           Alpha channel, and hope for the best!

           If there are invalid tags or field values within a tag, the Graphics::TIFF library  will  attempt  to
           pop-up a warning dialog, rather than just ignoring invalid things. If we can find a switch to disable
           this  behavior,  we will look into adding it as an option. According to Graphic::TIFF's owner (ticket
           RT 133955), this is coming directly from libtiff (as write to STDERR), so he can't do anything  about
           it!

   <b>usesLib</b>
           $mode = $tif-&gt;usesLib()

           Returns  1  if Graphics::TIFF installed and used, 0 if not installed, or -1 if installed but not used
           (nouseGT option given to "image_tiff").

           <b>Caution:</b> this method can only be used <u>after</u> the image object has been  created.  It  can't  tell  you
           whether  Graphics::TIFF  is  available  in advance of actually using it, in case you want to use some
           functionality available only in TIFF_GT. See the PDF::Builder <b>LA_GT()</b> call if you  need  to  know  in
           advance.
