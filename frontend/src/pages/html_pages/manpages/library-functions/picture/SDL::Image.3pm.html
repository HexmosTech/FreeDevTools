</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       SDL::Image - Bindings for the SDL_Image library

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       SDL::Image allows you to load many different format of images into memory as an SDL::Surface.

</pre><h4><b>CATEGORY</b></h4><pre>
       Image

</pre><h4><b>SUPPORTED</b> <b>FORMATS</b></h4><pre>
       The following types are supported:

       TGA TrueVision Targa (MUST have .tga)

       BMP Windows Bitmap(.bmp)

       PNM Portable  Anymap  (.pnm)  .pbm  =  Portable  BitMap (mono) .pgm = Portable GreyMap (256 greys) .ppm =
           Portable PixMap (full color)

       XPM X11 Pixmap (.xpm) can be #included directly in code This is NOT the same as XBM(X11  Bitmap)  format,
           which is for monocolor images.

       XCF GIMP  native  (.xcf)  (XCF  =  eXperimental Computing Facility?)  This format is always changing, and
           since there's no library supplied by the GIMP project to load XCF, the loader may frequently fail  to
           load  much  of  any  image from an XCF file. It's better to load this in GIMP and convert to a better
           supported image format.

       PCX ZSoft IBM PC Paintbrush (.pcx)

       GIF CompuServe Graphics Interchange Format (.gif)

       JPG Joint Photographic Experts Group JFIF format (.jpg or .jpeg)

       TIF Tagged Image File Format (.tif or .tiff)

       LBM Interleaved Bitmap (.lbm or .iff) FORM : ILBM or PBM(packed bitmap), HAM6, HAM8, and 24bit types  are
           not supported.

       PNG Portable Network Graphics (.png)

       XV
       ICO
       CUR

</pre><h4><b>LOADING</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>load</b>
        my $surface = SDL::Image::load( $file );

       $file Image file name to load a surface from.

       Load  file for use as an image in a new SDL::Surface. This actually calls SDL::Image::load_typed_rw, with
       the file extension used as the type string. This can load all supported image  files,  including  TGA  as
       long  as  the  filename ends with ".tga". It is best to call this outside of event loops, and rather keep
       the loaded images around until you are really done with them, as disk speed and  image  conversion  to  a
       surface is not that speedy.

       <b>Note</b>: If the image format loader requires initialization, it will attempt to do that the first time it is
       needed if you have not already called SDL::Image::init to load support for your image format.

       <b>Note</b>: If the image format supports a transparent pixel, SDL::Image will set the colorkey for the surface.
       You can enable RLE acceleration on the surface afterwards by calling:

       SDL::Video::set_color_key

         my $image = SDL::Image::load( $some_png_file );
         SDL::Video::set_color_key($image, SDL_RLEACCEL, $image-&gt;format-&gt;colorkey);

       <u>Return</u>

       An image as a SDL::Surface. NULL is returned on errors, such as no support built for the image, or a file
       reading error. Use SDL::get_error to get cause of error.

   <b>load_typed_rw</b>
         SDL::Image::load_typed_rw($src, $freesrc, $type);

       src The source SDL::RWops as a pointer. The image is loaded from this.

       freesrc
           A  non-zero value mean is will automatically close/free the src for you. Since SDL Perl cannot handle
           the memory inside this function you would most likely want 1 here.

       type
           A string that indicates which format type to interpret the image as.

           Here is a list of the currently recognized strings (case is not important):

           "BMP"
           "CUR"
           "GIF"
           "ICO"
           "JPG"
           "LBM"
           "PCX"
           "PNG"
           "PNM"
           "TGA"
           "TIF"
           "XCF"
           "XPM"
           "XV"

       Load src for use as a surface. This can load all supported image formats. This method does not  guarantee
       that  the  format specified by type is the format of the loaded image, except in the case when TGA format
       is specified (or any other non-magicable format in the future). Using SDL_RWops is not covered here,  but
       they enable you to load from almost any source.

       <b>Note</b>: If the image format loader requires initialization, it will attempt to do that the first time it is
       needed if you have not already called SDL::Image::init to load support for your image format.

       <b>Note</b>: If the image format supports a transparent pixel, SDL::Image will set the colorkey for the surface.
       You can enable RLE acceleration on the surface afterwards by calling: SDL::Video::set_color_key

       <u>Transparency</u>

         use SDL;
         use SDL::RWOps;
         use SDL::Image;

         my $file2 = SDL::RWOps-&gt;new_file("test/data/menu.png", "rb");
         my $image = SDL::Image::load_typed_rw($file2, 1, "PNG");

         SDL::Video::set_color_key($image, SDL_RLEACCEL, $image-&gt;format-&gt;colorkey);

       <u>Return</u>

       The image as a new SDL::Surface. NULL is returned on errors.

   <b>is_[TYPE]</b>
       Test for valid, supported image files:

       is_ICO
       is_CUR
       is_PNG
       is_BMP
       is_GIF
       is_JPG
       is_LBM
       is_PCX
       is_PNM
       is_TIF
       is_XCF
       is_XPM
       is_XV

       These functions take a SDL::RWOps as a parameter.

       <u>Return</u>

       1 if the image is a valid [TYPE]  and the [TYPE] format support is compiled into SDL_image. 0 is returned
       otherwise.

       <u>Example</u>

        use SDL::RWOps;
        use SDL::Image;

        my $file = SDL::RWOps-&gt;new_file("file", "rb");

        print "Image is BMP" if ( SDL::is_BMP );

   <b>load_[TYPE]_rw</b>
       Specific loader for known formats:

       load_ICO_rw
       load_CUR_rw
       load_PNG_rw
       load_BMP_rw
       load_GIF_rw
       load_JPG_rw
       load_LBM_rw
       load_PCX_rw
       load_PNM_rw
       load_TIF_rw
       load_XCF_rw
       load_XPM_rw
       load_XV_rw

       These functions take a SDL::RWop as a parameter

       <u>Return</u>

       The  image  as  a new SDL::Surface. NULL is returned on errors, like if the [TYPE] is not supported, or a
       read error.

       <u>Example</u>

        use SDL;
        use SDL::RWOps;
        use SDL::Image;

        my $file = SDL::RWOps-&gt;new_file("file.png", "rb");

        my $image = SDL::Image::load_PNG_rw($file);

        die SDL::get_error if (!$image);

   <b>read_XPM_from_array</b>
        my $picture = SDL::Image::read_XPM_from_array(\@XPM, $width);

       This functions takes the reference of an array in the valid @XPM format.  Also  the  $width  of  the  XPM
       image.

       <u>Return</u>

       The  image  as  a  new  SDL::Surface. NULL is returned on errors, like if XPM is not supported, or a read
       error.

       <u>Example</u>

               my @XPM= (
               '30 30 9 1',
               '       c #FFFFFF',

</pre><h4><b>MISC</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>linked_version</b>
       Provides the version of linked sdl_image library.

       <u>Return</u>

       Returns a SDL::Version object

       <u>Example</u>

               my $version = SDL::Image::linked_version();
               print $version-&gt;major.' '.$version-&gt;minor.' '.$version-&gt;patch;

   <b>init</b>
       <b>For</b> <b>version</b> <b>SDL_image</b> <b>1.2.10</b> <b>and</b> <b>up</b>

       <u>Flags</u>

       bitwise OR'd set of image formats to support by loading a library now. The values you may OR together  to
       pass in are:

       IMG_INIT_JPG
       IMG_INIT_PNG
       IMG_INIT_TIF

       Initialize by loading support as indicated by the flags, or at least return success if support is already
       loaded.  You  may call this multiple times, which will actually require you to call IMG_Quit just once to
       clean up. You may call this function with a 0 to retrieve whether support was built-in or not loaded yet.

       <b>Note</b>: to load JPG, PNG, and/or TIF images you can call IMG_Init with  the  right  IMG_INIT_*  flags  OR'd
       together before you program gets busy, to prevent a later hiccup while it loads the library, and to check
       that you do have the support that you need before you try and use it.

       <b>Note</b>:  No  initialization  is needed nor performed when using the SDL::Image::is_JPG, SDL::Image::is_PNG,
       and SDL::Image::is_TIF functions.

       <b>Note</b>: this function does not always set the error string, so do not depend on SDL::Image::get_error being
       meaningful all the time.

       <u>Return</u>

       A bitmask of all the currently inited image loaders.

       <u>Example</u>

         use SDL::Image;
         my $flags = IMG_INIT_JPG | IMG_INIT_PNG | IMG_INIT_JPG;
         my $inited = SDL::Image::init($flags);

   <b>quit</b>
       <b>For</b> <b>version</b> <b>SDL_image</b> <b>1.2.10</b> <b>and</b> <b>up</b>

       This function cleans up all dynamically loaded library handles, freeing memory. If  support  is  required
       again  it  will be initialized again, either by SDL::Image::init or loading an image with dynamic support
       required. You may call this function when SDL::Image::load functions are no longer needed  for  the  JPG,
       PNG,  and  TIF  image  formats.  You  only  need  to  call  this  function once, no matter how many times
       SDL::Image::init was called.

       <u>Example</u>

        use SDL::Image;
        SDL::Image::init(IMG_INIT_JPG); #loads JPG support
        SDL::Image::load("file.png"); #loads PNG support
        SDL::Image::quit(); #unloads everything

   <b>set_error</b>
       Same as SDL::set_error

   <b>get_error</b>
       Same as SDL::get_error
