</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       image - Create and manipulate images

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>image</b> <u>option</u> ?<u>arg</u> <u>...</u>?
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>image</b>  command  is  used  to create, delete, and query images.  It can take several different forms,
       depending on the <u>option</u> argument.  The legal forms are:

       <b>image</b> <b>create</b> <u>type</u> ?<u>name</u>? ?<u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>...</u>?
              Creates a new image and a command with the same name and returns its  name.   <u>type</u>  specifies  the
              type  of  the  image,  which  must  be  one  of  the types currently defined (e.g., <b>bitmap</b>).  <u>name</u>
              specifies the name for the image;  if it is omitted then Tk picks a name of the form <b>image</b><u>x</u>, where
              <u>x</u> is an integer.  There may be any number  of  <u>option</u>-<u>value</u>  pairs,  which  provide  configuration
              options  for  the  new image.  The legal set of options is defined separately for each image type;
              see below for details on the options for built-in image types.  If an image already exists by  the
              given  name  then it is replaced with the new image and any instances of that image will redisplay
              with the new contents.  It is important to note that the image command will silently overwrite any
              procedure that may currently be defined by the given name, so  choose  the  name  wisely.   It  is
              recommended to use a separate namespace for image names (e.g., <b>::img::logo</b>, <b>::img::large</b>).

       <b>image</b> <b>delete</b> ?<u>name</u> <u>name</u> ...?
              Deletes  each  of  the  named  images  and returns an empty string.  If there are instances of the
              images displayed in widgets, the images will not actually be deleted until all  of  the  instances
              are  released.   However,  the  association  between  the  instances and the image manager will be
              dropped.  Existing instances will retain their sizes but redisplay as empty areas.  If  a  deleted
              image  is  recreated  with  another  call to <b>image</b> <b>create</b>, the existing instances will use the new
              image.

       <b>image</b> <b>height</b> <u>name</u>
              Returns a decimal string giving the height of image <u>name</u> in pixels.

       <b>image</b> <b>inuse</b> <u>name</u>
              Returns a boolean value indicating whether or not the image  given  by  <u>name</u>  is  in  use  by  any
              widgets.

       <b>image</b> <b>names</b>
              Returns a list containing the names of all existing images.

       <b>image</b> <b>type</b> <u>name</u>
              Returns  the type of image <u>name</u> (the value of the <u>type</u> argument to <b>image</b> <b>create</b> when the image was
              created).

       <b>image</b> <b>types</b>
              Returns a list whose elements are all of the valid image types (i.e., all of the values  that  may
              be supplied for the <u>type</u> argument to <b>image</b> <b>create</b>).

       <b>image</b> <b>width</b> <u>name</u>
              Returns a decimal string giving the width of image <u>name</u> in pixels.

       Additional  operations  (e.g.  writing  the image to a file) may be available as subcommands of the image
       instance command. See the manual page for the particular image type for details.

</pre><h4><b>BUILT-IN</b> <b>IMAGE</b> <b>TYPES</b></h4><pre>
       The following image types are defined by Tk so they will be available in any Tk application.   Individual
       applications or extensions may define additional types.

       <b>bitmap</b> Each  pixel  in  the  image  displays a foreground color, a background color, or nothing.  See the
              <b>bitmap</b> manual entry for more information.

       <b>photo</b>  Displays a variety of full-color images, using dithering to approximate colors  on  displays  with
              limited color capabilities.  See the <b>photo</b> manual entry for more information.

       <b>nsimage</b>
              This  type  is only available in the Aqua platform.  It is a full-color image which may be created
              from a named system image.  It has options designed to facilitate  the  use  of  these  images  in
              buttons.   An  <b>nsimage</b> can be based on an a <u>template</u> <u>image</u>, which is an anti-aliased 2-color image
              format that automatically interchanges black and white in response to changes  between  the  light
              and  dark  modes  on  macOS.   An  <b>nsimage</b> can also generate an alternate <u>pressed</u> variant which is
              lighter in dark mode and darker in light mode.  These are  for  use  in  image  buttons.  See  the
              <b>nsimage</b> manual entry for more information.
