       Image::Info - Extract meta information from image files

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        use Image::Info qw(image_info dim);

        my $info = image_info("image.jpg");
        if (my $error = $info-&gt;{error}) {
            die "Can't parse image info: $error\n";
        }
        my $color = $info-&gt;{color_type};

        my $type = image_type("image.jpg");
        if (my $error = $type-&gt;{error}) {
            die "Can't determine file type: $error\n";
        }
        die "No gif files allowed!" if $type-&gt;{file_type} eq 'GIF';

        my($w, $h) = dim($info);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module provides functions to extract various kinds of meta information from image files.

   <b>EXPORTS</b>
       Exports nothing by default, but can export the following methods on request:

               image_info
               image_type
               dim
               html_dim
               determine_file_type

   <b>METHODS</b>
       The following functions are provided by the "Image::Info" module:

       image_info( $file )
       image_info( \$imgdata )
       image_info( $file, key =&gt; value,... )
           This  function  takes  the  name  of  a file or a file handle as argument and will return one or more
           hashes (actually hash references) describing the images inside the file.  If there is only one  image
           in  the  file  only  one  hash  is returned.  In scalar context, only the hash for the first image is
           returned.

           In case of error, a hash containing the "error" key will be returned.  The corresponding  value  will
           be an appropriate error message.

           If  a  reference  to a scalar is passed as an argument to this function, then it is assumed that this
           scalar contains the raw image data directly.

           The image_info() function also take optional  key/value  style  arguments  that  can  influence  what
           information is returned.

       image_type( $file )
       image_type( \$imgdata )
           Returns a hash with only one key, "file_type". The value will be the type of the file. On error, sets
           the two keys "error" and "Errno".

           This function is a dramatically faster alternative to the image_info function for situations in which
           you <b>only</b> need to find the image type.

           It  uses  only the internal file-type detection to do this, and thus does not need to load any of the
           image type-specific driver modules, and does not access to entire file. It also only needs access  to
           the first 11 bytes of the file.

           To  maintain some level of compatibility with image_info, image_type returns in the same format, with
           the same error message style. That is, it returns a HASH reference, with the "$type-&gt;{error}" key set
           if there was an error.

           On success, the HASH reference will contain the single key "file_type", which represents the type  of
           the file, expressed as the type code used for the various drivers ('GIF', 'JPEG', 'TIFF' and so on).

           If there are multiple images within the file they will be ignored, as this function provides only the
           type of the overall file, not of the various images within it. This function will not return multiple
           hashes if the file contains multiple images.

           Of course, in all (or at least effectively all) cases the type of the images inside the file is going
           to be the same as that of the file itself.

       dim( $info_hash )
           Takes  an  hash  as  returned  from  image_info() and returns the dimensions ($width, $height) of the
           image.  In scalar context returns the dimensions as a string.

       html_dim( $info_hash )
           Returns the dimensions as a string suitable for embedding directly into HTML or SVG &lt;img&gt;-tags. E.g.:

              print "&lt;img src="..." @{[html_dim($info)]}&gt;\n";

       determine_file_format( $filedata )
           Determines the file format from the passed file data (a normal Perl scalar containing the first bytes
           of the file), and returns either undef for an unknown file format, or a string describing the format,
           like "BMP" or "JPEG".

</pre><h4><b>Image</b> <b>descriptions</b></h4><pre>
       The image_info() function returns meta information about each image in the form of a reference to a hash.
       The hash keys used are in most cases based on the TIFF element names.  All lower case keys are  mandatory
       for  all  file  formats  and will always be there unless an error occurred (in which case the "error" key
       will be present.)  Mixed case keys will only be present when the  corresponding  information  element  is
       available in the image.

       The following key names are common for any image format:

       file_media_type
           This  is  the  MIME type that is appropriate for the given file format.  The corresponding value is a
           string like: "image/png" or "image/jpeg".

       file_ext
           The is the suggested file name extension for a file of the given file  format.   The  value  is  a  3
           letter, lowercase string like "png", "jpg".

       width
           This is the number of pixels horizontally in the image.

       height
           This  is  the  number  of  pixels  vertically in the image.  (TIFF uses the name ImageLength for this
           field.)

       color_type
           The value is a short string describing what kind of values the pixels encode.  The value can  be  one
           of the following:

             Gray
             GrayA
             RGB
             RGBA
             CMYK
             YCbCr
             CIELab

           These  names  can  also be prefixed by "Indexed-" if the image is composed of indexes into a palette.
           Of these, only "Indexed-RGB" is likely to occur.

           It is similar to the TIFF field "PhotometricInterpretation", but this name was found to be too  long,
           so we used the PNG inspired term instead.

       resolution
           The  value  of  this field normally gives the physical size of the image on screen or paper. When the
           unit specifier is missing then this field denotes the squareness of pixels in the image.

           The syntax of this field is:

              &lt;res&gt; &lt;unit&gt;
              &lt;xres&gt; "/" &lt;yres&gt; &lt;unit&gt;
              &lt;xres&gt; "/" &lt;yres&gt;

           The &lt;res&gt;, &lt;xres&gt; and &lt;yres&gt; fields are numbers.  The &lt;unit&gt; is a string like "dpi", "dpm" or  "dpcm"
           (denoting "dots per inch/cm/meter).

       SamplesPerPixel
           This  says  how  many  channels  there are in the image.  For some image formats this number might be
           higher than the number implied from the "color_type".

       BitsPerSample
           This says how many bits are used to encode each of samples.  The value is a  reference  to  an  array
           containing numbers. The number of elements in the array should be the same as "SamplesPerPixel".

       Comment
           Textual  comments  found  in  the  file.   The value is a reference to an array if there are multiple
           comments found.

       Interlace
           If the image is interlaced, then this tells which interlace method is used.

       Compression
           This tells you which compression algorithm is used.

       Gamma
           A number.

       LastModificationTime
           A ISO date string

</pre><h4><b>Supported</b> <b>Image</b> <b>Formats</b></h4><pre>
       The following image file formats are supported:

       AVIF
           Supports the basic standard info key names.

       BMP This module supports the Microsoft Device Independent Bitmap format (BMP, DIB, RLE).

           For more information see Image::Info::BMP.

       GIF Both GIF87a and GIF89a are supported and the version number is found as "GIF_Version" for  the  first
           image.   GIF  files  can  contain multiple images, and information for all images will be returned if
           <b>image_info()</b> is called in list context.  The Netscape-2.0 extension to loop  animation  sequences  is
           represented  by  the  "GIF_Loop"  key for the first image.  The value is either "forever" or a number
           indicating loop count.

       ICO This module supports the Microsoft Windows Icon Resource format (.ico).

       JPEG
           For JPEG files we extract information both from "JFIF" and "Exif" application chunks.

           "Exif" is the file format written by most digital cameras. This encode things like timestamp,  camera
           model, focal length, exposure time, aperture, flash usage, GPS position, etc.

           The "Exif" spec can be found at: &lt;<a href="http://www.exif.org/specifications.html">http://www.exif.org/specifications.html</a>&gt;.

           The  "color_type"  element  may  have  the  following  values: "Gray", "YCbCr", and "CMYK". Note that
           detecting "RGB" and "YCCK" currently does not work, but will hopefully in future.

       PNG Information from IHDR, PLTE, gAMA, pHYs, tEXt, tIME chunks are extracted.  The sequence of chunks are
           also given by the "PNG_Chunks" key.

       PBM/PGM/PPM
           All information available is extracted.

       SVG Provides a plethora of attributes and metadata of an SVG vector graphic.

       TIFF
           The "TIFF" spec can be found at: &lt;<a href="http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/tiff/">http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/tiff/</a>&gt;

           The EXIF spec can be found at: &lt;<a href="http://www.exif.org/specifications.html">http://www.exif.org/specifications.html</a>&gt;

       WBMP
           wbmp  files  have  no  magic,  so  cannot  be  used  with  the  normal  Image::Info  functions.   See
           Image::Info::WBMP for more information.

       WEBP
           VP8  (lossy),  VP8L  (lossless) and VP8X (extended) files are supported.  Sets the key "Animation" to
           true if the file is an animation. Otherwise sets the key "Compression" to either "VP8" or "Lossless".

       XBM See Image::Info::XBM for details.

       XPM See Image::Info::XPM for details.

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
       While this module is fine for parsing basic image information  like  image  type,  dimensions  and  color
       depth,  it  is  probably not good enough for parsing out more advanced information like EXIF data. If you
       want an up-to-date and tested EXIF parsing library, please use Image::ExifTool.
