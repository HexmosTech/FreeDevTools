</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module gets stock quotes from Yahoo! Finance.  The <b>getonequote</b> function will return a quote for a
       single stock symbol, while the <b>getquote</b> function will return a quote for each of the stock symbols passed
       to it.  <b>getcustomquote</b> allows to specify a format other than the default to take advantage of the
       extended range of available information.

       The download operation is efficient: only one request is made even if several symbols are requested at
       once. The return value of <b>getonequote</b> is an array, with the following elements:

           0 Symbol
           1 Company Name
           2 Last Price
           3 Last Trade Date
           4 Last Trade Time
           5 Change
           6 Percent Change
           7 Volume
           8 Average Daily Vol
           9 Bid
           10 Ask
           11 Previous Close
           12 Today's Open
           13 Day's Range
           14 52-Week Range
           15 Earnings per Share
           16 P/E Ratio
           17 Dividend Pay Date
           18 Dividend per Share
           19 Dividend Yield
           20 Market Capitalization
           21 Stock Exchange

       If the extended format has been selected, the following fields are also retrieved:

           22 Short ratio
           23 1yr Target Price
           24 EPS Est. Current Yr
           25 EPS Est. Next Year
           26 EPS Est. Next Quarter
           27 Price/EPS Est. Current Yr
           28 Price/EPS Est. Next Yr
           29 PEG Ratio
           30 Book Value
           31 Price/Book
           32 Price/Sales
           33 EBITDA
           34 50-day Moving Avg
           35 200-day Moving Avg

       If the real-time format has been selected, the following fields are also retrieved:

           36 Ask (real-time)
           37 Bid (real-time)
           38 Change in Percent (real-time)
           39 Last trade with time (real-time)
           40 Change (real-time)
           41 Day range (real-time)
           42 Market-cap (real-time)

       The <b>getquote</b> function returns an array of pointers to arrays with the above structure.

       The <b>getonequote</b> function returns just one quote, rather than an array. It returns a simple array of
       values for the given symbol.

       The <b>setQueryString</b> permits to supply a new query string that will be used for subsequent data requests.

       The <b>useExtendedQueryFormat</b> and <b>useRealtimeQueryFormat</b> are simpler interfaces which append symbols to the
       default quote string, as detailed above.

       The <b>getcustomquote</b> returns an array of quotes corresponding to values for the symbols supplied in the
       first array reference, and the custom fields supplied in the second array reference. Here the custom
       fields correspond to the 'named' fields of the list below.

       Beyond stock quotes, <b>Finance::YahooQuote</b> can also obtain quotes for currencies (from the Philadephia
       exchange -- however Yahoo! appears to have stopped to support the currency symbols in a reliable manner),
       US mutual funds, options on US stocks, several precious metals and quite possibly more; see the Yahoo!
       Finance website for full information. <b>Finance::YahooQuote</b> can be used for stocks from the USA, Canada,
       various European exchanges, various Asian exchanges (Singapore, Taiwan, HongKong, Kuala Lumpur, ...)
       Australia and New Zealand. It should work for other markets supported by Yahoo.

       You may optionally override the default LWP timeout of 180 seconds by setting
       $Finance::YahooQuote::TIMEOUT to your preferred value.

       You may also provide a proxy (for the required http connection) by using the variable
       $Finance::YahooQuote::PROXY. Furthermore, authentication-based proxies can be used by setting the proxy
       user and password via the variables $Finance::YahooQuote::PROXYUSER and
       $Finance::YahooQuote::PROXYPASSWD.

       Two example scripts are provided to help with the mapping a stock symbols as well as with Yahoo! Finance
       server codes. The regression tests scripts in the <b>t/</b> subdirectory of the source distribution also contain
       simple examples.

</pre><h4><b>FAQs</b></h4><pre>
   <b>How</b> <b>can</b> <b>one</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>format</b> <b>string?</b>
       Provided a My Yahoo! (<a href="http://my.yahoo.com">http://my.yahoo.com</a>) account, go to the following URL:

           <a href="http://edit.my.yahoo.com/config/edit_pfview">http://edit.my.yahoo.com/config/edit_pfview</a>?.vk=v1

       Viewing the source of this page, you will come across the section that defines the menus that let you
       select which elements go into a particular view.  The &lt;option&gt; values are the strings that pick up the
       information described in the menu item.  For example, Symbol refers to the string "s" and name refers to
       the string "l".  Using "sl" as the format string, we would get the symbol followed by the name of the
       security.

       The example script <u>examine_server.sh</u> shows this in some more detail and downloads example .csv files
       using <b>GNU</b> <b>wget</b>.

   <b>What</b> <b>about</b> <b>different</b> <b>stock</b> <b>symbols</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>corporation?</b>
       This can be issue. For the first few years, Yahoo! Finance's servers appeared to be cover their
       respective local markets. E.g., the UK-based servers provided quotes for Europe, the Australian one for
       the Australia and New Zealand and so on.  Hence, one needed to branch and bound code and map symbols to
       their region's servers.

       It now appears that this is no longer required, which is good news as it simplifies coding. However, some
       old symbols are no longer supported -- yet other, and supported, codes exist for the same company.  For
       example, German stocks used to quoted in terms or their cusip-like 'WKN'. The main server does not
       support these, but does support newer, acronym-based symbols.  The example script examine_server.sh helps
       in finding the mapping as e.g. from 555750.F to DTEGN.F for Deutsche Telekom.
