</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Finance::Quote::FTfunds - Obtain UK Unit Trust quotes from FT.com (Financial Times).

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           $q = Finance::Quote-&gt;new;

           %info = Finance::Quote-&gt;fetch("ftfunds","&lt;isin&gt; ...");  # Only query FT.com using ISINs

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module fetches information from the Financial Times Funds service, <a href="http://funds.ft.com">http://funds.ft.com</a>. There are
       over 47,000 UK Unit Trusts and OEICs quoted, as well as many Offshore Funds and Exhange Traded Funds
       (ETFs). It converts any funds quoted in GBX (pence) to GBP, dividing the price by 100 in the process.

       Funds are identified by their ISIN code, a 12 character alphanumeric code.  Although the web site also
       allows searching by fund name, this version of Finance::Quote::FTfunds only implements ISIN lookup. To
       determine the ISIN for funds of interest to you, visit the funds.ft.com site and use the flexible search
       facilities to identify the funds of interest. The factsheet display for any given fund displays the ISIN
       along with other useful information.

       This module is loaded by default on a Finance::Quote object. It's also possible to load it explicitly by
       placing "ftfunds" in the argument list to Finance::Quote-&gt;<b>new()</b>.

       Information obtained by this module may be covered by funds.ft.com terms and conditions See
       <a href="http://funds.ft.com/">http://funds.ft.com/</a> and <a href="http://ft.com">http://ft.com</a> for details.

   <b>Stocks</b> <b>And</b> <b>Indices</b>
       This module provides both the "ftfunds" and "ukfunds" fetch methods for fetching UK and Offshore Unit
       Trusts and OEICs prices and other information from funds.ft.com. Please use the "ukfunds" fetch method if
       you wish to have failover with future sources for UK and Offshore Unit Trusts and OEICs - the author has
       plans to develop Finance::Quote modules for the London Stock Exchange and Morningstar unit trust
       services. Using the "ftfunds" method will guarantee that your information only comes from the
       funds.ft.com website.
