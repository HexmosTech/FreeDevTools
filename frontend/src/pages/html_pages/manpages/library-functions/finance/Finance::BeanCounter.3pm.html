</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Finance::BeanCounter - Module for stock portfolio performance functions.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        use Finance::BeanCounter;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Finance::BeanCounter</b> provides functions to <u>download</u>, <u>store</u> and <u>analyse</u> stock market data.

       <u>Downloads</u> are available of current (or rather: 15 or 20 minute-delayed) price and company data as well as
       of historical price data.  Both forms can be stored in an SQL database (for which we currently default to
       <b>PostgreSQL</b> though <b>MySQL</b> is supported as well; furthermore any database reachable by means of an <b>ODBC</b>
       connection should work).

       <u>Analysis</u> currently consists of performance and risk analysis. Performance reports comprise a profit-and-
       loss (or 'p/l' in the lingo) report which can be run over arbitrary time intervals such as "--prevdate
       'friday six months ago' --date 'yesterday'" -- in essence, whatever the wonderful <b>Date::Manip</b> module
       understands -- as well as dayendreport which defaults to changes in the last trading day. A risk report
       show parametric and non-parametric value-at-risk (VaR) estimates.

       Most available functionality is also provided in the reference implementation <b>beancounter</b>, a convenient
       command-line script.

       The API might change and evolve over time. The low version number really means to say that the code is
       not in its final form yet, but it has been in use for well over four years.

       More documentation is in the Perl source code.

</pre><h4><b>DATABASE</b> <b>LAYOUT</b></h4><pre>
       The easiest way to see the table design is to look at the content of the <b>setup_beancounter</b> script. It
       creates the five tables <u>stockinfo</u>, <u>stockprices</u>, <u>fxprices</u>, <u>portfolio</u> and <u>indices</u>. Note also that is
       supports the creation of database for both <b>PostgreSQL</b> and <b>MySQL</b>.

   <b>THE</b> <b>STOCKINFO</b> <b>TABLE</b>
       The <u>stockinfo</u> table contains general (non-price) information and is index by <u>symbol</u>:

                   symbol              <a href="../man12/varchar.12.html">varchar</a>(12) not null,
                   name                <a href="../man64/varchar.64.html">varchar</a>(64) not null,
                   exchange            <a href="../man16/varchar.16.html">varchar</a>(16) not null,
                   capitalisation      float4,
                   low_52weeks         float4,
                   high_52weeks        float4,
                   earnings            float4,
                   dividend            float4,
                   p_e_ratio           float4,
                   avg_volume          int4

       This table is updated by overwriting the previous content.

   <b>THE</b> <b>STOCKPRICES</b> <b>TABLE</b>
       The <u>stockprices</u> table contains (daily) price and volume information. It is indexed by both <u>date</u> and
       <u>symbol</u>:

                   symbol              <a href="../man12/varchar.12.html">varchar</a>(12) not null,
                   date                date,
                   previous_close      float4,
                   day_open            float4,
                   day_low             float4,
                   day_high            float4,
                   day_close           float4,
                   day_change          float4,
                   bid                 float4,
                   ask                 float4,
                   volume              int4

       During updates, information is appended to this table.

   <b>THE</b> <b>FXPRICES</b> <b>TABLE</b>
       The <u>fxprices</u> table contains (daily) foreign exchange rates. It can be used to calculate home market
       values of foreign stocks:

                   currency            <a href="../man12/varchar.12.html">varchar</a>(12) not null,
                   date                date,
                   previous_close      float4,
                   day_open            float4,
                   day_low             float4,
                   day_high            float4,
                   day_close           float4,
                   day_change          float4

       Similar to the <u>stockprices</u> table, it is index on <u>date</u> and <u>symbol</u>.

   <b>THE</b> <b>STOCKPORTFOLIO</b> <b>TABLE</b>
       The <u>portfolio</u> table contains contains the holdings information:

                   symbol              <a href="../man16/varchar.16.html">varchar</a>(16) not null,
                   shares              float4,
                   currency            <a href="../man12/varchar.12.html">varchar</a>(12),
                   type                <a href="../man16/varchar.16.html">varchar</a>(16),
                   owner               <a href="../man16/varchar.16.html">varchar</a>(16),
                   cost                <a href="../man4/float.4.html">float</a>(4),
                   date                date

       It is indexed on <u>symbol,owner,date</u>.

   <b>THE</b> <b>INDICES</b> <b>TABLE</b>
       The <u>indices</u> table links a stock <u>symbol</u> with one or several market indices:

                   symbol              <a href="../man12/varchar.12.html">varchar</a>(12) not null,
                   stockindex          <a href="../man12/varchar.12.html">varchar</a>(12) not null

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Finance::BeanCounter</b> and <b>beancounter</b> are so fresh that there are only missing features :)

       On a more serious note, this code (or its earlier predecessors) have been in use since the fall of 1998.

       Known bugs or limitations are documented in TODO file in the source package.
