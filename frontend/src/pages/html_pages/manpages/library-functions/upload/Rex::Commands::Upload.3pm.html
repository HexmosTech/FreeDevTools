       Rex::Commands::Upload - Upload a local file to a remote server

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       With this module you can upload a local file via sftp to a remote host.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        task "upload", "remoteserver", sub {
          upload "localfile", "/remote/file";
        };

</pre><h4><b>EXPORTED</b> <b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>upload($local,</b> <b>$remote)</b>
       Perform an upload. If $remote is a directory the file will be uploaded to that directory.

        task "upload", "remoteserver", sub {
          upload "localfile", "/path";
        };

       This function supports the following hooks:

       before
           This gets executed before anything is done. All original parameters are passed to it.

           The return value of this hook overwrites the original parameters of the function-call.

       before_change
           This  gets  executed  right  before the new file is written. The local file name, and the remote file
           name are passed as parameters.

       after_change
           This gets executed right after the file was written. On top of the local file name,  and  the  remote
           file name, any returned results are passed as parameters.

       after
           This  gets  executed  right  before  the  upload() function returns. All original parameters, and any
           results returned are passed to it.
