       JIRA::Client - (DEPRECATED) Extended interface to JIRA's SOAP API

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 0.45

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use JIRA::Client;

         my $jira = JIRA::Client-&gt;new('<a href="http://jira.example.com/jira">http://jira.example.com/jira</a>', 'user', 'passwd');

         my $issue = $jira-&gt;create_issue(
           {
             project =&gt; 'TST',
             type =&gt; 'Bug',
             summary =&gt; 'Summary of the bug',
             assignee =&gt; 'gustavo',
             components =&gt; ['compa', 'compb'],
             fixVersions =&gt; ['1.0.1'],
             custom_fields =&gt; {Language =&gt; 'Perl', Architecture =&gt; 'Linux'},
           }
         );

         $issue = eval { $jira-&gt;getIssue('TST-123') };
         die "Can't getIssue(): $@" if $@;

         $jira-&gt;set_filter_iterator('my-filter');
         while (my $issue = $jira-&gt;next_issue()) {
             # ...
         }

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>DEPRECATION</b> <b>WARNING</b>: Please, before using this module consider using the newer JIRA::REST because JIRA's
       SOAP API was deprecated &lt;https://developer.atlassian.com/jiradev/latest-updates/soap-and-xml-rpc-api-
       deprecation-notice&gt; on JIRA 6.0 and isn't available anymore on JIRA 7.0.

       JIRA is a proprietary bug tracking system from Atlassian (&lt;<a href="http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/">http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/</a>&gt;).

       This module implements an Object Oriented wrapper around JIRA's SOAP API, which is specified in
       &lt;<a href="http://docs.atlassian.com/software/jira/docs/api/rpc-jira-plugin/latest/com/atlassian/jira/rpc/soap/JiraSoapService.html">http://docs.atlassian.com/software/jira/docs/api/rpc-jira-plugin/latest/com/atlassian/jira/rpc/soap/JiraSoapService.html</a>&gt;.
       (This version is known work against JIRA 4.4.)

       Moreover, it implements some other methods to make it easier to do some common operations.

</pre><h4><b>API</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       With the exception of the API "login" and "logout" methods, which aren't needed, all other methods are
       available through the JIRA::Client object interface. You must call them with the same name as documented
       in the specification but you should not pass the "token" argument, because it is supplied transparently
       by the JIRA::Client object.

       All methods fail by throwing exceptions (croaking, actually). You may want to guard against this by
       invoking them within an eval block, like this:

         my $issue = eval { $jira-&gt;getIssue('TST-123') };
         die "Can't getIssue('TST-123'): $@" if $@;

       Some of the API methods require hard-to-build data structures as arguments. This module tries to make
       them easier to call by accepting simpler structures and implicitly constructing the more elaborated ones
       before making the actual SOAP call. Note that this is an option, i.e, you can either pass the elaborate
       structures by yourself or the simpler ones in the call.

       The items below are all the implemented implicit conversions. Wherever a parameter of the type specified
       first is required (as an rvalue, not as an lvalue) by an API method you can safely pass a value of the
       type specified second.

       A <b>issue</b> <b>key</b> as a string can be specified by a <b>RemoteIssue</b> object.
       A <b>RemoteComment</b> object can be specified by a string.
       A <b>filterId</b> as a string can be specified by a <b>RemoteFilter</b> object.
       A <b>RemoteFieldValue</b> object array can be specified by a hash mapping field names to values.

</pre><h4><b>EXTRA</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       This  module  implements  some  extra  methods to add useful functionality to the API. They are described
       below. Note that their names don't follow the CamelCase convention used by the native API methods but the
       more Perlish underscore_separated_words convention so that you can distinguish  them  and  we  can  avoid
       future name clashes.

   <b>new</b> <b>BASEURL,</b> <b>USER,</b> <b>PASSWD</b> <b>[,</b> <b>&lt;SOAP::Lite</b> <b>arguments&gt;]</b>
       "BASEURL" is the JIRA server's base URL (e.g., "https://jira.example.net" or "https://example.net/jira"),
       to which the default WSDL descriptor path ("/rpc/soap/jirasoapservice-v2?wsdl") will be appended in order
       to construct the underlying SOAP::Lite object.

       "USER" and "PASSWD" are the credentials that will be used to authenticate into JIRA.

       Any other arguments will be passed to the SOAP::Lite object that will be created to talk to JIRA.

   <b>new</b> <b>HASH_REF</b>
       You  can  invoke the constructor with a single hash-ref argument. The same arguments that are passed as a
       list above can be passed by name with a hash. This constructor is also more flexible, as  it  makes  room
       for extra arguments.

       The valid hash keys are listed below.

       baseurl =&gt; STRING
           (Required) The JIRA server's base URL.

       wsdl =&gt; STRING
           (Optional)  JIRA's standard WSDL descriptor path is "/rpc/soap/jirasoapservice-v2?wsdl". If your JIRA
           instance has a non-standard path to the WSDL service, you may specify it here.

       user =&gt; STRING
           (Required) The username to authenticate into JIRA.

       password =&gt; STRING
           (Required) The password to authenticate into JIRA.

       soapargs =&gt; ARRAY_REF
           (Optional) Extra arguments to be passed to the SOAP::Lite object that will  be  created  to  talk  to
           JIRA.

   <b>create_issue</b> <b>HASH_REF</b> <b>[,</b> <b>SECURITYLEVEL]</b>
       Creates  a  new  issue  given  a  hash  containing  the  initial values for its fields and, optionally, a
       security-level. The hash must specify at least the fields "project", "summary", and "type".

       This is an easier to use version of the createIssue API method. For once it accepts symbolic  values  for
       some of the issue fields that the API method does not. Specifically:

       "type" can be specified by <u>name</u> instead of by <u>id</u>.
       "priority" can be specified by <u>name</u> instead of by <u>id</u>.
       "component" can be specified by a list of component <u>names</u> or <u>ids</u> instead of a list of "RemoteComponent"
       objects.
       "affectsVersions" and "fixVersions" can be specified by a list of version <u>names</u> or <u>ids</u> instead of a list
       of "RemoteVersion" objects.
       "duedate" can be specified by a DateTime object or by a string in ISO standard format (YYYY-MM-DD...).
       (Note that up to JIRA 4.3 you could pass a string in the format "d/MMM/yy", which was passed as is to
       JIRA, which expected a <b>string</b> SOAP type. However, since JIRA 4.4 the server expects a <b>date</b> SOAP type,
       which must be in the ISO standard format.)

       It accepts a 'magic' field called <b>parent</b>, which specifies the issue key from which the created issue must
       be a sub-task.

       It  accepts another 'magic' field called <b>custom_fields</b> to make it easy to set custom fields. It accepts a
       hash mapping each custom field to its value. The custom field can be specified by its id (in  the  format
       <b>customfield_NNNNN</b>)  or  by its name, in which case the method will try to convert it to its id. Note that
       to do that conversion the user needs administrator rights.

       A simple custom field value can be specified by a scalar, which will be properly placed inside  an  ARRAY
       in order to satisfy the <b>RemoteFieldValue</b>'s structure.

       Cascading select fields are properly specified like this: <a href="http://tinyurl.com/2bmthoa">http://tinyurl.com/2bmthoa</a>. The magic short-cut
       requires  a HASH where each cascading level is indexed by its level number, starting at zero. So, instead
       of specifying it like this:

           {
               id =&gt; 'customfield_10011',
               values =&gt; [ SOAP::Data-&gt;type(string =&gt; '10031' ) ]
           },
           {
               id =&gt; 'customfield_10011:1',
               values =&gt; [ SOAP::Data-&gt;type(string =&gt; '10188') ],
           },

       You can do it like this:

           {customfield_10011 =&gt; {'0' =&gt; 10031, '1' =&gt; 10188}},

       Note that the original hash keys and values are completely preserved.

   <b>update_issue</b> <b>ISSUE_OR_KEY,</b> <b>HASH_REF</b>
       Update a issue given a hash containing the values for its fields. The first argument may be an issue  key
       or  a RemoteIssue object. The second argument must be a hash-ref specifying the fields's values just like
       documented in the create_issue function above.

       This is an easier to use version of the updateIssue API method because it accepts the same shortcuts that
       create_issue does.

   <b>get_issue_types</b>
       Returns a hash mapping the server's issue type names to the RemoteIssueType objects describing them.

   <b>get_subtask_issue_types</b>
       Returns a hash mapping the server's sub-task issue type names to the RemoteIssueType  objects  describing
       them.

   <b>get_statuses</b>
       Returns a hash mapping the server's status names to the RemoteStatus objects describing them.

   <b>get_priorities</b>
       Returns a hash mapping a server's priorities names to the RemotePriority objects describing them.

   <b>get_resolutions</b>
       Returns a hash mapping a server's resolution names to the RemoteResolution objects describing them.

   <b>get_security_levels</b> <b>PROJECT-KEY</b>
       Returns  a  hash  mapping  a project's security level names to the RemoteSecurityLevel objects describing
       them.

   <b>get_custom_fields</b>
       Returns a hash mapping JIRA's custom field names to the RemoteField representing them. It's useful  since
       when  you  get  a  RemoteIssue object from this API it doesn't contain the custom field's names, but just
       their identifiers. From the RemoteField object you can obtain  the  field's  <b>id</b>,  which  is  useful  when
       calling the <b>updateIssue</b> method.

       The method calls the getCustomFields API method the first time and keeps the custom fields information in
       a cache.

   <b>set_custom_fields</b> <b>HASHREF</b>
       Passes  a  hash  mapping  JIRA's  custom field names to the RemoteField representing them to populate the
       custom field's cache. This can be useful  if  you  don't  have  administrative  privileges  to  the  JIRA
       instance, since only administrators can call the <b>getCustomFields</b> API method.

   <b>get_components</b> <b>PROJECT_KEY</b>
       Returns a hash mapping a project's components names to the RemoteComponent objects describing them.

   <b>get_versions</b> <b>PROJECT_KEY</b>
       Returns a hash mapping a project's versions names to the RemoteVersion objects describing them.

   <b>get_favourite_filters</b>
       Returns a hash mapping the user's favourite filter names to its filter ids.

   <b>set_filter_iterator</b> <b>FILTER</b> <b>[,</b> <b>CACHE_SIZE]</b>
       Sets up an iterator for the filter identified by FILTER. It must be called before calls to <b>next_issue</b>.

       FILTER  can  be  either  a filter <u>id</u> or a filter <u>name</u>, in which case it's converted to a filter id with a
       call to "getSavedFilters".

       CACHE_SIZE  defines  the  number   of   issues   that   will   be   pre-fetched   by   <b>nect_issue</b>   using
       "getIssuesFromFilterWithLimit". If not specified, a suitable default will be used.

   <b>next_issue</b>
       This  must be called after a call to <b>set_filter_iterator</b>. Each call returns a reference to the next issue
       from the filter. When there are no more issues it returns undef.

   <b>progress_workflow_action_safely</b> <b>ISSUE,</b> <b>ACTION,</b> <b>PARAMS</b>
       This is a safe and easier to use version of the  <b>progressWorkflowAction</b>  API  method  which  is  used  to
       progress  an  issue  through  a  workflow's action while making edits to the fields that are shown in the
       action screen. The API method is dangerous because if you forget to provide new values to all the  fields
       shown  in  the screen, then the fields not provided will become undefined in the issue. The problem has a
       pending issue on Atlassian's JIRA &lt;<a href="http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRA-8717">http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRA-8717</a>&gt;.

       This method plays it safe by making sure that all fields shown in the screen that already  have  a  value
       are  given new (or the same) values so that they don't get undefined. It calls the <b>getFieldsForAction</b> API
       method to grok all fields that are  shown  in  the  screen.  If  there  is  any  field  not  set  in  the
       ACTION_PARAMS then it calls <b>getIssue</b> to grok the missing fields current values. As a result it constructs
       the necessary RemoteFieldAction array that must be passed to progressWorkflowAction.

       The method is also easier to use because its arguments are more flexible:

       "ISSUE" can be either an issue key or a RemoteIssue object returned by a previous call to, e.g.,
       "getIssue".
       "ACTION" can be either an action <u>id</u> or an action <u>name</u>.
       "PARAMS" must be a hash mapping field names to field values. This hash is treated in the same way as the
       hash passed to the function <b>create_issue</b> above.

       For example, instead of using this:

         my $action_id = somehow_grok_the_id_of('close');
         $jira-&gt;progressWorkflowAction('PRJ-5', $action_id, [
           RemoteFieldValue-&gt;new(2, 'new value'),
           ..., # all fields must be specified here
         ]);

       And risking to forget to pass some field you can do this:

         $jira-&gt;progress_workflow_action_safely('PRJ-5', 'close', {2 =&gt; 'new value'});

   <b>get_issue_custom_field_values</b> <b>ISSUE,</b> <b>NAME_OR_IDs</b>
       This  method receives a RemoteField object and a list of names or ids of custom fields. It returns a list
       of references to the ARRAYs containing  the  values  of  the  ISSUE's  custom  fields  denoted  by  their
       NAME_OR_IDs. Returns undef for custom fields not set on the issue.

       In scalar context it returns a reference to the list.

   <b>attach_files_to_issue</b> <b>ISSUE,</b> <b>FILES...</b>
       This  method  attaches  one  or  more  files  to  an  issue.  The ISSUE argument may be an issue key or a
       <b>RemoteIssue</b> object. The attachments may be specified in two ways:

       STRING
           A string denotes a filename to be open and read. In this case, the  attachment  name  is  the  file's
           basename.

       HASHREF
           When  you want to specify a different name to the attachment or when you already have an IO object (a
           GLOB, a IO::File, or a FileHandle) you must pass them as values of a hash. The keys of the  hash  are
           taken as the attachment name. You can specify more than one attachment in each hash.

       The method returns the value returned by the <b>addBase64EncodedAttachmentsToIssue</b> API method.

       In  the  example below, we attach three files to the issue TST-1. The first is called "file1.txt" and its
       contents are read from "/path/to/file1.txt". The second is called "text.txt" and its  contents  are  read
       from  "/path/to/file2.txt".  the  third  is  called  "me.jpg"  and  its contents are read from the object
       referred to by $fh.

           $jira-&gt;attach_files_to_issue('TST-1',
                                        '/path/to/file1.txt',
                                        {
                                            'text.txt' =&gt; '/path/to/file2.txt',
                                            'me.jpg'   =&gt; $fh,
                                        },
           );

   <b>attach_strings_to_issue</b> <b>ISSUE,</b> <b>HASHREF</b>
       This method attaches one or more strings to an issue. The ISSUE  argument  may  be  an  issue  key  or  a
       <b>RemoteIssue</b>  object.  The  attachments are specified by a HASHREF in which the keys denote the file names
       and the values their contents.

       The method returns the value returned by the <b>addBase64EncodedAttachmentsToIssue</b> API method.

   <b>filter_issues_unsorted</b> <b>FILTER</b> <b>[,</b> <b>LIMIT]</b>
       This method returns a list of RemoteIssue objects from the specified FILTER, which is a  string  that  is
       understood in one of these ways (in order):

       A space-separated list of issue keys
           To  specify  issues  explicitly by their keys, which must match /[A-Z]+-\d+/i. The letters in the key
           are upcased before being passed to getIssue. For example:

               KEY-123 chave-234 CLAVE-345

           Note that the result list doesn't respect the order in which the keys are  specified  and  also  that
           duplicate keys are discarded and the corresponding issue appear only once in the resulting list.

       The name of a saved filter
           If  FILTER  is  a  single  word,  it  is passed to getIssuesFromFilterWithLimit as a filter name. For
           example:

               sprint-backlok-filter

       A JQL expression
           As a last resort, FILTER is passed to getIssuesFromJqlSearch as a JQL expression. For example:

               project = CDS AND fixVersion = sprint-5

       The optional LIMIT argument specified the maximum number of issues that can be returned. It has a default
       limit of 1000, but this can be overridden by the JIRA server configuration.

       This method is meant to be used as a flexible interface for human beings to request a list of issues.  Be
       warned,  however,  that  you  are  responsible  to  de-taint the FILTER argument before passing it to the
       method.

   <b>filter_issues</b> <b>FILTER</b> <b>[,</b> <b>LIMIT]</b>
       This method invokes the <b>filter_issues_unsorted</b> method with the same arguments and  returns  the  list  of
       RemoteIssue objects sorted by issue key.

</pre><h4><b>OTHER</b> <b>CONSTRUCTORS</b></h4><pre>
       The  JIRA  SOAP  API uses several types of objects (i.e., classes) for which the Perl SOAP interface does
       not provide the necessary constructors. This module implements some of them.

   <b>RemoteFieldValue-&gt;new</b> <b>ID,</b> <b>VALUES</b>
       The RemoteFieldValue object represents the value of a field of an issue. It needs two arguments:

       ID  The field name, which must be a valid key for the ISSUE hash.

       VALUES
           A scalar or an array of scalars.

   <b>RemoteCustomFieldValue-&gt;new</b> <b>ID,</b> <b>VALUES</b>
       The RemoteCustomFieldValue object represents the value of a  custom_field  of  an  issue.  It  needs  two
       arguments:

       ID  The field name, which must be a valid custom_field key.

       VALUES
           A scalar or an array of scalars.

   <b>RemoteComponent-&gt;new</b> <b>ID,</b> <b>NAME</b>
   <b>RemoteVersion-&gt;new</b> <b>ID,</b> <b>NAME</b>
