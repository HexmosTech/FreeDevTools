       filename - File name conventions supported by Tcl commands
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

</pre><h4><b>INTRODUCTION</b></h4><pre>
       All Tcl commands and C procedures that take file names as arguments expect the file names to be in one of
       three  forms,  depending  on  the  current  platform.   On  each platform, Tcl supports file names in the
       standard forms(s) for that platform.  In addition, on all platforms,  Tcl  supports  a  Unix-like  syntax
       intended  to  provide  a  convenient  way  of  constructing simple file names.  However, scripts that are
       intended to be portable should not assume a particular form for file names.   Instead,  portable  scripts
       must  use  the  <b>file</b> <b>split</b> and <b>file</b> <b>join</b> commands to manipulate file names (see the <b>file</b> manual entry for
       more details).

</pre><h4><b>PATH</b> <b>TYPES</b></h4><pre>
       File names are grouped into three general types based on the starting point for the path used to  specify
       the  file:  absolute,  relative,  and volume-relative.  Absolute names are completely qualified, giving a
       path to the file relative to a particular volume and the root directory on that volume.   Relative  names
       are  unqualified,  giving  a path to the file relative to the current working directory.  Volume-relative
       names are partially qualified, either giving the path relative to  the  root  directory  on  the  current
       volume,  or  relative to the current directory of the specified volume.  The <b>file</b> <b>pathtype</b> command can be
       used to determine the type of a given path.

</pre><h4><b>PATH</b> <b>SYNTAX</b></h4><pre>
       The rules for native names depend on the value reported in the Tcl <b>platform</b> element of  the  <b>tcl_platform</b>
       array:

       <b>Unix</b>      On  Unix  and  Apple macOS platforms, Tcl uses path names where the components are separated by
                 slashes.  Path names may be relative or absolute, and file  names  may  contain  any  character
                 other  than  slash.  The file names <b>.</b> and <b>..</b> are special and refer to the current directory and
                 the parent of the current directory  respectively.   Multiple  adjacent  slash  characters  are
                 interpreted as a single separator, except for the first double slash <b>//</b> in absolute paths.  Any
                 number  of trailing slash characters at the end of a path are simply ignored, so the paths <b>foo</b>,
                 <b>foo/</b> and <b>foo//</b> are all identical, and in particular <b>foo/</b> does not necessarily mean a  directory
                 is being referred.

                 The following examples illustrate various forms of path names:

                 <b>/</b>              Absolute path to the root directory.

                 <b><a href="file:/etc/passwd">/etc/passwd</a></b>    Absolute  path  to  the  file  named  <b>passwd</b>  in  the  directory <b>etc</b> in the root
                                directory.

                 <b>.</b>              Relative path to the current directory.

                 <b>foo</b>            Relative path to the file <b>foo</b> in the current directory.

                 <b>foo/bar</b>        Relative path to the file <b>bar</b> in the directory <b>foo</b> in the current directory.

                 <b>../foo</b>         Relative path to the file <b>foo</b> in the directory above the current directory.

       <b>Windows</b>   On Microsoft Windows platforms, Tcl supports both drive-relative and UNC style names.   Both  <b>/</b>
                 and <b>\</b> may be used as directory separators in either type of name.  Drive-relative names consist
                 of  an optional drive specifier followed by an absolute or relative path.  UNC paths follow the
                 general form <b>\\servername\sharename\path\file</b>, but must at the very least  contain  the  server
                 and share components, i.e.  <b>\\servername\sharename</b>.  In both forms, the file names <b>.</b> and <b>..</b> are
                 special  and  refer  to  the  current  directory  and  the  parent  of  the  current  directory
                 respectively.  The following examples illustrate various forms of path names:

                 <b>\\Host\share/file</b>
                                Absolute UNC path to a file called <b>file</b> in the  root  directory  of  the  export
                                point  <b>share</b>  on  the host <b>Host</b>.  Note that repeated use of <b>file</b> <b>dirname</b> on this
                                path will give <b>//Host/share</b>, and will never give just <b>//Host</b>.

                 <b>c:foo</b>          Volume-relative path to a file <b>foo</b> in the current directory on drive <b>c</b>.

                 <b>c:/foo</b>         Absolute path to a file <b>foo</b> in the root directory of drive <b>c</b>.

                 <b>foo\bar</b>        Relative path to a file <b>bar</b> in the <b>foo</b> directory in the current directory on the
                                current volume.

                 <b>\foo</b>           Volume-relative path to a file <b>foo</b> in the root directory of the current volume.

                 <b>\\foo</b>          Volume-relative path to a file <b>foo</b> in the root directory of the current  volume.
                                This  is  not  a valid UNC path, so the assumption is that the extra backslashes
                                are superfluous.

       <b>Zipfs</b>
                 On all platforms where <b>zipfs</b> support is enabled, paths within mounted ZIP archives  begin  with
                 the  string  returned  by  the  <b>zipfs</b>  <b>root</b>  command.   Zipfs  paths  are case-sensitive on all
                 platforms.

</pre><h4><b>TILDE</b> <b>SUBSTITUTION</b></h4><pre>
       Unlike earlier versions of Tcl, Tcl 9 does not do implicit tilde substitution  on  file  paths  with  the
       exception  noted  below. The commands <b>file</b> <b>home</b> and <b>file</b> <b>tildeexpand</b> may be used to explicitly accomplish
       the same.

       The exception to the above is initialization of the <b>auto_path</b> variable and the Tcl module search paths as
       documented in the manpages for <b>tclvars</b> and  <b>tm</b>.  When  any  path  in  an  environment  variable  used  to
       initialize these starts with a tilde, it will be interpreted as if the first element is replaced with the
       location  of  the home directory for the given user. If the tilde is followed immediately by a separator,
       the <b>$HOME</b> environment variable is substituted. Otherwise the characters between the tilde  and  the  next
       separator are taken as a user name, which is used to retrieve the user's home directory for substitution.
       This works on POSIX, macOS and Windows platforms.

</pre><h4><b>PORTABILITY</b> <b>ISSUES</b></h4><pre>
       Not  all  file  systems  are  case  sensitive,  so  scripts should avoid code that depends on the case of
       characters in a file name.  In addition, the character sets allowed on different devices may  differ,  so
       scripts  should  choose  file  names  that  do not contain special characters like: <b>&lt;&gt;:?"/\|</b>.  The safest
       approach is to use names consisting of alphanumeric characters only.  Care should be taken with filenames
       which contain spaces (common on Windows systems) and filenames  where  the  backslash  is  the  directory
       separator (Windows native path names).

       On  Windows  platforms  there  are file and path length restrictions.  Complete paths or filenames longer
       than about 260 characters will lead to errors in most file operations.

       Another Windows peculiarity is that any number of trailing dots “.”  in filenames  are  totally  ignored,
       so,  for  example, attempts to create a file or directory with a name “foo.”  will result in the creation
       of a file/directory with name  “foo”.   This  fact  is  reflected  in  the  results  of  <b>file</b>  <b>normalize</b>.
       Furthermore, a file name consisting only of dots “.........”  or dots with trailing characters “.....abc”
       is illegal.
