</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>SSL_poll()</b> allows the readiness conditions of the resources represented by one or more
       BIO_POLL_DESCRIPTOR structures to be determined. In particular, it can be used to query for readiness
       conditions on QUIC connection SSL objects and QUIC stream SSL objects in a single call. It can also be
       used to block until at least one of the given resources is ready.

       A call to <b>SSL_poll()</b> specifies an array of <b>SSL_POLL_ITEM</b> structures, each of which designates a resource
       which is being polled for readiness, and a set of event flags which indicate the specific readiness
       events which the caller is interested in in relation to the specified resource.

       The fields of <b>SSL_POLL_ITEM</b> are as follows:

       <u>desc</u>
           The  resource  being  polled  for readiness, as represented by a <b>BIO_POLL_DESCRIPTOR</b>. Currently, this
           must be a poll descriptor of type <b>BIO_POLL_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_SSL</b>, representing an SSL  object  pointer,
           and the SSL object must be a QUIC connection SSL object or QUIC stream SSL object.

           If  a  <b>SSL_POLL_ITEM</b>  has  a poll descriptor type of <b>BIO_POLL_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_NONE</b>, or the SSL object
           pointer is NULL, the <b>SSL_POLL_ITEM</b> array entry is ignored and <u>revents</u> will be set to 0 on return.

       <u>events</u>
           This is the set of zero or more events which the caller is interested in learning about  in  relation
           to  the  resource  described  by  <u>desc</u>.  It is a collection of zero or more <b>SSL_POLL_EVENT</b> flags. See
           "EVENT TYPES" for a description of each of the event types.

       <u>revents</u>
           After <b>SSL_poll()</b> returns, this is the set of zero or more events which are actually applicable to the
           resource described by <u>desc</u>. As for <u>events</u>, it is a collection of zero or more <b>SSL_POLL_EVENT</b> flags.

           <u>revents</u> need not be a subset of the events specified in <u>events</u>, as some event types  are  defined  as
           always being enabled (non-maskable). See "EVENT TYPES" for more information.

       To  use  <b>SSL_poll()</b>,  call  it with an array of <b>SSL_POLL_ITEM</b> structures. The array need remain allocated
       only for the duration of the call. <u>num_items</u> must be set to the number  of  entries  in  the  array,  and
       <u>stride</u> must be set to sizeof(SSL_POLL_ITEM).

       The <u>timeout</u> argument specifies the timeout to use, and, implicitly, whether to use <b>SSL_poll()</b> in blocking
       or nonblocking mode:

       •   If <u>timeout</u> is NULL, the function blocks indefinitely until at least one resource is ready.

       •   If <u>timeout</u> is non-NULL, and it points to a <b>struct</b> <b>timeval</b> which is set to zero, the function operates
           in nonblocking mode and returns immediately with readiness information.

       •   If  <u>timeout</u>  is  non-NULL, and it points to a <b>struct</b> <b>timeval</b> which is set to a value other than zero,
           the function blocks for the specified interval or until at least one of the  specified  resources  is
           ready, whichever comes first.

       The  present  implementation  of  <b>SSL_poll()</b>  is  a  subset of the functionality which will eventually be
       available. For more information, see "LIMITATIONS".

       The following flags are currently defined for the <u>flags</u> argument:

       <b>SSL_POLL_FLAG_NO_HANDLE_EVENTS</b>
           This flag indicates that internal state machine processing should not be performed in an  attempt  to
           generate new readiness events. Only existing readiness events will be reported.

           If  this  flag  is  used  in  nonblocking  mode  (with  a timeout of zero), no internal state machine
           processing is performed.

           If this flag is used in blocking mode (for example, with <u>timeout</u> set to NULL), event processing  does
           not occur unless the function blocks.

       The  <u>result_count</u>  argument is optional. If it is non-NULL, it is used to output the number of entries in
       the array which have nonzero <u>revents</u> fields when the call to <b>SSL_poll()</b> returns; see "RETURN VALUES"  for
       details.

</pre><h4><b>EVENT</b> <b>TYPES</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>SSL_poll()</b> interface reports zero or more event types on a given resource, represented by a bit mask.

       All of the event types are level triggered and represent a readiness or permanent exception condition; as
       such,  after  an event has been reported by <b>SSL_poll()</b> for a resource, it will continue to be reported in
       future <b>SSL_poll()</b> calls until the condition ceases to be in effect. A caller must mask  the  given  event
       type  bit  in  future  <b>SSL_poll()</b> calls if it does not wish to receive repeated notifications and has not
       caused the underlying readiness condition (for example, consuming all available data using <b><a href="../man3/SSL_read_ex.3.html">SSL_read_ex</a></b>(3)
       after <b>SSL_POLL_EVENT_R</b> is reported) to be deasserted.

       Some event types do not make sense on a given kind of resource. In this case, specifying that event  type
       in <u>events</u> is a no-op and will be ignored, and the given event will never be reported in <u>revents</u>.

       Failure  of the polling mechanism itself is considered distinct from an exception condition on a resource
       which was successfully polled. See <b>SSL_POLL_EVENT_F</b> and "RETURN VALUES" for details.

       In general, an application should always listen for the event types corresponding to exception conditions
       if  it  is  listening  to  the  corresponding  non-exception  event  types  (e.g.  <b>SSL_POLL_EVENT_EC</b>  and
       <b>SSL_POLL_EVENT_ER</b> for <b>SSL_POLL_EVENT_R</b>), as not doing so is unlikely to be a sound design.

       Some  event  types  are  non-maskable  and  may  be  reported  in <u>revents</u> regardless of whether they were
       requested in <u>events</u>.

       The following event types are supported:

       <b>SSL_POLL_EVENT_F</b>
           Polling failure. This event is raised when a resource could not be polled. It  is  distinct  from  an
           exception  condition reported on a resource which was successfully polled and represents a failure of
           the polling process itself in relation to a resource. This may mean that <b>SSL_poll()</b> does not  support
           the kind of resource specified.

           Where  this event is raised on at least one item in <u>items</u>, <b>SSL_poll()</b> will return 0 and the ERR stack
           will contain information pertaining to the first item in <u>items</u> with <b>SSL_POLL_EVENT_F</b> set. See "RETURN
           VALUES" for more information.

           This event type may be raised even if it was not requested in <u>events</u>; specifying this event  type  in
           <u>events</u> does nothing.

       <b>SSL_POLL_EVENT_EL</b>
           Error  at  listener  level. This event is raised when a listener has failed, for example if a network
           BIO has encountered a permanent error.

           This event is never raised on objects  which  are  not  listeners,  but  its  occurrence  will  cause
           <b>SSL_POLL_EVENT_EC</b> to be raised on all dependent connections.

       <b>SSL_POLL_EVENT_EC</b>
           Error  at  connection level. This event is raised when a connection has failed.  In particular, it is
           raised when a connection begins terminating.

           This event is never raised on objects which are not connections.

       <b>SSL_POLL_EVENT_ECD</b>
           Error at connection level (drained). This event is raised when a connection has finished terminating,
           and has reached the terminated state. This event will generally  occur  after  an  interval  of  time
           passes after the <b>SSL_POLL_EVENT_EC</b> event is raised on a connection.

           This event is never raised on objects which are not connections.

       <b>SSL_POLL_EVENT_ER</b>
           Error in read direction. For QUIC, this is raised only in the event that a stream has a read part and
           that read part has been reset by the peer (for example, using a <b>RESET_STREAM</b> frame).

       <b>SSL_POLL_EVENT_EW</b>
           Error  in  write direction. For QUIC, this is raised only in the event that a stream has a write part
           and that write part has been reset by the peer using a <b>STOP_SENDING</b> frame.

       <b>SSL_POLL_EVENT_R</b>
           Readable. This event is raised when a QUIC stream SSL object (or a QUIC connection SSL object with  a
           default stream attached) has application data waiting to be read using <b><a href="../man3/SSL_read_ex.3.html">SSL_read_ex</a></b>(3), or a FIN event
           as represented by <b>SSL_ERROR_ZERO_RETURN</b> waiting to be read.

           It  is  not raised in the event of the receiving part of the QUIC stream being reset by the peer; see
           <b>SSL_POLL_EVENT_ER</b>.

       <b>SSL_POLL_EVENT_W</b>
           Writable. This event is raised when a QUIC stream SSL object (or a QUIC connection SSL object with  a
           default stream attached) could accept more application data using <b><a href="../man3/SSL_write_ex.3.html">SSL_write_ex</a></b>(3).

           This event is never raised by a receive-only stream.

           This  event  is  never  raised  by  a  stream which has had its send part concluded normally (as with
           <b><a href="../man3/SSL_stream_conclude.3.html">SSL_stream_conclude</a></b>(3)) or locally reset (as with <b><a href="../man3/SSL_stream_reset.3.html">SSL_stream_reset</a></b>(3)).

           This event does not guarantee that a subsequent call to <b><a href="../man3/SSL_write_ex.3.html">SSL_write_ex</a></b>(3) will succeed.

       <b>SSL_POLL_EVENT_IC</b>
           This event, which is only raised by a QUIC listener SSL object, is raised when one or  more  incoming
           QUIC connections are available to be accepted using <b><a href="../man3/SSL_accept_connection.3.html">SSL_accept_connection</a></b>(3).

       <b>SSL_POLL_EVENT_ISB</b>
           This event, which is only raised by a QUIC connection SSL object, is raised when one or more incoming
           bidirectional streams are available to be accepted using <b><a href="../man3/SSL_accept_stream.3.html">SSL_accept_stream</a></b>(3).

       <b>SSL_POLL_EVENT_ISU</b>
           This event, which is only raised by a QUIC connection SSL object, is raised when one or more incoming
           unidirectional streams are available to be accepted using <b><a href="../man3/SSL_accept_stream.3.html">SSL_accept_stream</a></b>(3).

       <b>SSL_POLL_EVENT_OSB</b>
           This event, which is only raised by a QUIC connection SSL object, is raised when QUIC stream creation
           flow control currently permits at least one additional bidirectional stream to be locally created.

       <b>SSL_POLL_EVENT_OSU</b>
           This event, which is only raised by a QUIC connection SSL object, is raised when QUIC stream creation
           flow control currently permits at least one additional unidirectional stream to be locally created.

</pre><h4><b>LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>SSL_poll()</b> as presently implemented has the following limitation:

       •   Only   <b>BIO_POLL_DESCRIPTOR</b>   structures  with  type  <b>BIO_POLL_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_SSL</b>,  referencing  QUIC
           listener, connection or stream SSL objects, are supported.

       This limitation may be revised in a future release of OpenSSL.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>SSL_poll()</b> returns 1 on success and 0 on failure.

       Unless the <u>items</u> pointer itself is invalid, <b>SSL_poll()</b> will always initialise the <u>revents</u> fields  of  all
       items in the input array upon returning, even if it returns failure.

       If  <u>result_count</u>  is  non-NULL,  it  is always written with the number of items in the array with nonzero
       <u>revents</u> fields, even if the <b>SSL_poll()</b> call returns failure.

       It is possible for <u>result_count</u> to be written as 0 even if the <b>SSL_poll()</b> call returns success, namely if
       no events were output but the polling process was successful (e.g. in nonblocking usage) or timed out.

       It is possible for <u>result_count</u> to be written as a nonzero value if the <b>SSL_poll()</b> call returns  failure,
       for  example  due  to  <b>SSL_POLL_EVENT_F</b>  events,  or  because some events were detected and output before
       encountering a failure condition while processing a subsequent entry in the <u>items</u> array.

       If at least one <b>SSL_POLL_EVENT_F</b> event is output, <b>SSL_poll()</b> is guaranteed to return 0 and guaranteed  to
       place  at  least  one  ERR  on  the  error  stack  describing the first <b>SSL_POLL_EVENT_F</b> output. Detailed
       information on any additional <b>SSL_POLL_EVENT_F</b> events is not available. <b>SSL_poll()</b> may or may not  return
       more than one <b>SSL_POLL_EVENT_F</b> event at once.

       "Normal"  events  representing  exceptional  I/O  conditions  which  do  not  constitute a failure of the
       <b>SSL_poll()</b> mechanism itself are not considered errors by <b>SSL_poll()</b> and  are  instead  represented  using
       their own event type; see "EVENT TYPES" for details.

       The caller can establish the meaning of the <b>SSL_poll()</b> return and output values as follows:

       •   If  <b>SSL_poll()</b>  returns  1  and <u>result_count</u> is zero, the operation timed out before any resource was
           ready.

       •   If <b>SSL_poll()</b> returns 1 and <u>result_count</u> is nonzero, that many events were output.

       •   If <b>SSL_poll()</b> returns 0 and <u>result_count</u> is zero, the caller has made a basic usage error; check  the
           ERR stack for details.

       •   If  <b>SSL_poll()</b>  returns  0  and  <u>result_count</u>  is  nonzero, inspect the <u>items</u> array for <b>SSL_POLL_ITEM</b>
           structures with the <b>SSL_POLL_EVENT_F</b> event type raised in <u>revents</u>. The entries added to the ERR stack
           (of which there is guaranteed to be at least one) reflect the cause of the failure of the first  item
           in  <u>items</u>  with  <b>SSL_POLL_EVENT_F</b>  raised.  Note that there may be events other than <u>SSL_POLL_EVENT_F</u>
           output for items which come before the  first  item  with  <b>SSL_POLL_EVENT_F</b>  raised,  and  additional
           <b>SSL_POLL_EVENT_F</b>  events  may  or  may not have been output, both of which which will be reflected in
           <u>result_count</u>.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       <b>SSL_poll()</b> was added in OpenSSL 3.3.

       Before  3.5,  <b>SSL_poll()</b>  did not support blocking operation and would fail if called with a NULL <u>timeout</u>
       parameter or a <u>timeout</u> parameter pointing to a <b>struct</b> <b>timeval</b> which was not zero.

       Before 3.5, the <b>SSL_POLL_EVENT_EL</b> and <b>SSL_POLL_EVENT_IC</b> event types were not present.
