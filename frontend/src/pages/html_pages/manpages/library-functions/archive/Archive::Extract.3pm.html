</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Archive::Extract is a generic archive extraction mechanism.

       It allows you to extract any archive file of the type .tar, .tar.gz, .gz, .Z, tar.bz2, .tbz, .bz2, .zip,
       .xz,, .txz, .tar.xz or .lzma without having to worry how it does so, or use different interfaces for each
       type by using either perl modules, or commandline tools on your system.

       See the "HOW IT WORKS" section further down for details.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>$ae</b> <b>=</b> <b>Archive::Extract-&gt;new(archive</b> <b>=&gt;</b> <b>'/path/to/archive',[type</b> <b>=&gt;</b> <b>TYPE])</b>
       Creates a new "Archive::Extract" object based on the archive file you passed it. Automatically determines
       the type of archive based on the extension, but you can override that by explicitly providing the "type"
       argument, potentially by calling "type_for()".

       Valid values for "type" are:

       tar Standard tar files, as produced by, for example, "<a href="file:/bin/tar">/bin/tar</a>".  Corresponds to a ".tar" suffix.

       tgz Gzip  compressed  tar  files,  as produced by, for example "<a href="file:/bin/tar">/bin/tar</a> -z".  Corresponds to a ".tgz" or
           ".tar.gz" suffix.

       gz  Gzip compressed file, as produced by, for example "<a href="file:/bin/gzip">/bin/gzip</a>".  Corresponds to a ".gz" suffix.

       Z   Lempel-Ziv compressed file, as produced by, for  example  "/bin/compress".   Corresponds  to  a  ".Z"
           suffix.

       zip Zip  compressed  file,  as  produced  by, for example "/bin/zip".  Corresponds to a ".zip", ".jar" or
           ".par" suffix.

       bz2 Bzip2 compressed file, as produced by, for example, "/bin/bzip2".  Corresponds to a ".bz2" suffix.

       tbz Bzip2 compressed tar file, as produced by, for example "<a href="file:/bin/tar">/bin/tar</a> -j".  Corresponds  to  a  ".tbz"  or
           ".tar.bz2" suffix.

       lzma
           Lzma compressed file, as produced by "<a href="file:/bin/lzma">/bin/lzma</a>".  Corresponds to a ".lzma" suffix.

       xz  Xz compressed file, as produced by "<a href="file:/bin/xz">/bin/xz</a>".  Corresponds to a ".xz" suffix.

       txz Xz  compressed  tar  file,  as  produced  by,  for example "<a href="file:/bin/tar">/bin/tar</a> -J".  Corresponds to a ".txz" or
           ".tar.xz" suffix.

       Returns a "Archive::Extract" object on success, or false on failure.

   <b>$ae-&gt;extract(</b> <b>[to</b> <b>=&gt;</b> <b>'/output/path']</b> <b>)</b>
       Extracts the archive represented by the "Archive::Extract" object to the path of your choice as specified
       by the "to" argument. Defaults to "cwd()".

       Since ".gz" files never hold a directory, but only a single file; if the "to"  argument  is  an  existing
       directory,  the  file is extracted there, with its ".gz" suffix stripped.  If the "to" argument is not an
       existing directory, the "to" argument is understood to be a filename, if the archive type  is  "gz".   In
       the  case that you did not specify a "to" argument, the output file will be the name of the archive file,
       stripped from its ".gz" suffix, in the current working directory.

       "extract" will try a pure perl solution first, and then fall  back  to  commandline  tools  if  they  are
       available. See the "GLOBAL VARIABLES" section below on how to alter this behaviour.

       It will return true on success, and false on failure.

       On success, it will also set the follow attributes in the object:

       $ae-&gt;extract_path
           This is the directory that the files where extracted to.

       $ae-&gt;files
           This  is  an  array ref with the paths of all the files in the archive, relative to the "to" argument
           you specified.  To get the full path to an extracted file, you would use:

               File::Spec-&gt;catfile( $to, $ae-&gt;files-&gt;[0] );

           Note that all files from a tar archive will be in unix format, as per the tar specification.

</pre><h4><b>ACCESSORS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>$ae-&gt;error([BOOL])</b>
       Returns the last encountered error as string.  Pass it a true value to get the "Carp::longmess()"  output
       instead.

   <b>$ae-&gt;extract_path</b>
       This is the directory the archive got extracted to.  See "extract()" for details.

   <b>$ae-&gt;files</b>
       This is an array ref holding all the paths from the archive.  See "extract()" for details.

   <b>$ae-&gt;archive</b>
       This is the full path to the archive file represented by this "Archive::Extract" object.

   <b>$ae-&gt;type</b>
       This  is  the  type  of archive represented by this "Archive::Extract" object. See accessors below for an
       easier way to use this.  See the "new()" method for details.

   <b>$ae-&gt;types</b>
       Returns a list of all known "types" for "Archive::Extract"'s "new" method.

   <b>$ae-&gt;is_tgz</b>
       Returns true if the file is of type ".tar.gz".  See the "new()" method for details.

   <b>$ae-&gt;is_tar</b>
       Returns true if the file is of type ".tar".  See the "new()" method for details.

   <b>$ae-&gt;is_gz</b>
       Returns true if the file is of type ".gz".  See the "new()" method for details.

   <b>$ae-&gt;is_Z</b>
       Returns true if the file is of type ".Z".  See the "new()" method for details.

   <b>$ae-&gt;is_zip</b>
       Returns true if the file is of type ".zip".  See the "new()" method for details.

   <b>$ae-&gt;is_lzma</b>
       Returns true if the file is of type ".lzma".  See the "new()" method for details.

   <b>$ae-&gt;is_xz</b>
       Returns true if the file is of type ".xz".  See the "new()" method for details.

   <b>$ae-&gt;bin_tar</b>
       Returns the full path to your tar binary, if found.

   <b>$ae-&gt;bin_gzip</b>
       Returns the full path to your gzip binary, if found

   <b>$ae-&gt;bin_unzip</b>
       Returns the full path to your unzip binary, if found

   <b>$ae-&gt;bin_unlzma</b>
       Returns the full path to your unlzma binary, if found

   <b>$ae-&gt;bin_unxz</b>
       Returns the full path to your unxz binary, if found

   <b>$bool</b> <b>=</b> <b>$ae-&gt;have_old_bunzip2</b>
       Older versions of "/bin/bunzip2", from before the "bunzip2 1.0" release, require all archive names to end
       in ".bz2" or it will not extract them. This method checks if you have a recent version of "bunzip2"  that
       allows any extension, or an older one that doesn't.

   <b>debug(</b> <b>MESSAGE</b> <b>)</b>
       This  method  outputs  MESSAGE to the default filehandle if $DEBUG is true. It's a small method, but it's
       here if you'd like to subclass it so you can so something else with any debugging output.

</pre><h4><b>UTILITY</b> <b>FUNCTION</b></h4><pre>
   <b>type_for($archive)</b>
       Given an archive file name, it determins the type by parsing the file name  extension.  Used  by  "new()"
       when the "type" parameter is not passed.  Also useful when the archive file does not include a suffix but
       the  file  name  is  otherwise  known,  such as when a file is uploaded to a web server and stored with a
       temporary name that differs from the original name, and you want to use the  same  detection  pattern  as
       Archive::Extract. Example:

         my $ae = Archive::Extract-&gt;new(
             archive =&gt; '/tmp/02af6s',
             type    =&gt; Archive::Extract::type_for('archive.zip'),
         );

</pre><h4><b>HOW</b> <b>IT</b> <b>WORKS</b></h4><pre>
       "Archive::Extract"  tries  first  to determine what type of archive you are passing it, by inspecting its
       suffix. It does not do this by using Mime magic, or something related. See "CAVEATS" below.

       Once it has determined the file type, it knows which extraction methods it can use  on  the  archive.  It
       will  try  a perl solution first, then fall back to a commandline tool if that fails. If that also fails,
       it will return false, indicating it was unable to extract  the  archive.   See  the  section  on  "GLOBAL
       VARIABLES" to see how to alter this order.

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>File</b> <b>Extensions</b>
       "Archive::Extract"  trusts  on  the  extension  of  the  archive  to  determine what type it is, and what
       extractor methods therefore can be used. If your archives do not have any of the extensions as  described
       in  the  "new()"  method, you will have to specify the type explicitly, or "Archive::Extract" will not be
       able to extract the archive for you.

   <b>Supporting</b> <b>Very</b> <b>Large</b> <b>Files</b>
       "Archive::Extract" can use either pure perl modules or command line programs under the hood. Some of  the
       pure perl modules (like "Archive::Tar" and Compress::unLZMA) take the entire contents of the archive into
       memory,   which   may   not   be   feasible   on  your  system.  Consider  setting  the  global  variable
       $Archive::Extract::PREFER_BIN to 1, which will prefer the use of command line programs and won't  consume
       so much memory.

       See the "GLOBAL VARIABLES" section below for details.

   <b>Bunzip2</b> <b>support</b> <b>of</b> <b>arbitrary</b> <b>extensions.</b>
       Older  versions of "/bin/bunzip2" do not support arbitrary file extensions and insist on a ".bz2" suffix.
       Although we do our best to guard against this, if you experience a bunzip2 error, it may  be  related  to
       this. For details, please see the "have_old_bunzip2" method.

</pre><h4><b>GLOBAL</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>$Archive::Extract::DEBUG</b>
       Set  this  variable to "true" to have all calls to command line tools be printed out, including all their
       output.  This also enables "Carp::longmess" errors, instead of the regular "carp" errors.

       Good for tracking down why things don't work with your particular setup.

       Defaults to "false".

   <b>$Archive::Extract::WARN</b>
       This variable controls whether errors encountered internally by "Archive::Extract" should be "carp"'d  or
       not.

       Set  to  false  to silence warnings. Inspect the output of the "error()" method manually to see what went
       wrong.

       Defaults to "true".

   <b>$Archive::Extract::PREFER_BIN</b>
       This variables controls whether "Archive::Extract" should prefer the use of perl modules, or  commandline
       tools to extract archives.

       Set to "true" to have "Archive::Extract" prefer commandline tools.

       Defaults to "false".

</pre><h4><b>TODO</b> <b>/</b> <b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
       Mime magic support
           Maybe  this  module should use something like "File::Type" to determine the type, rather than blindly
           trust the suffix.

       Thread safety
           Currently, "Archive::Extract" does a "chdir" to the extraction dir before extraction, and  a  "chdir"
           back again after. This is not necessarily thread safe. See "rt.cpan.org" bug "#45671" for details.
