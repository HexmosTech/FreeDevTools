</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Dist::Zilla::Role::ArchiveBuilder - something that builds archives

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 6.032

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Plugins implementing this role have their "build_archive" method called when it is time to build the
       archive.

</pre><h4><b>PERL</b> <b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This module should work on any version of perl still receiving updates from the Perl 5 Porters.  This
       means it should work on any version of perl released in the last two to three years.  (That is, if the
       most recently released version is v5.40, then this module should work on both v5.40 and v5.38.)

       Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made that the minimum required version
       will not be increased.  The version may be increased for any reason, and there is no promise that patches
       will be accepted to lower the minimum required perl.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>build_archive</b>
       This method takes three arguments, and returns a Path::Tiny instance containing the path to the archive.

       archive_basename
           This  is  the  name  of  the archive (including "-TRIAL" if appropriate) without the format extension
           (that is the ".tar.gz" part).  The plugin implementing this role should add the appropriate full path
           including extension as the returned Path::Tiny instance.  Not  including  the  extension  allows  the
           plugin to choose its own format.

       built_in
           This is a Path::Tiny where the distribution has been built.

       dist_basename
           This  method will return the dist's basename (e.g. "Dist-Name-1.01" as a Path::Tiny.  The basename is
           used as the top-level directory in the tarball.  It does not include "-TRIAL",  even  if  building  a
           trial dist.
