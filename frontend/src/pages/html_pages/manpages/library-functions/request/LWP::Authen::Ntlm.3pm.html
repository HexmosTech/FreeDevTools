</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       LWP::Authen::Ntlm - Library for enabling NTLM authentication (Microsoft) in LWP

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        use LWP::UserAgent;
        use HTTP::Request::Common;
        my $url = '<a href="http://www.company.com/protected_page.html">http://www.company.com/protected_page.html</a>';

        # Set up the ntlm client and then the base64 encoded ntlm handshake message
        my $ua = LWP::UserAgent-&gt;new(keep_alive=&gt;1);
        $ua-&gt;credentials('www.company.com:80', '', "MyDomain\\MyUserCode", 'MyPassword');

        $request = GET $url;
        print "--Performing request now...-----------\n";
        $response = $ua-&gt;request($request);
        print "--Done with request-------------------\n";

        if ($response-&gt;is_success) {print "It worked!-&gt;" . $response-&gt;code . "\n"}
        else {print "It didn't work!-&gt;" . $response-&gt;code . "\n"}

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       LWP::Authen::Ntlm allows LWP to authenticate against servers that are using the NTLM authentication
       scheme popularized by Microsoft.  This type of authentication is common on intranets of Microsoft-centric
       organizations.

       The module takes advantage of the Authen::NTLM module by Mark Bush.  Since there is also another
       Authen::NTLM module available from CPAN by Yee Man Chan with an entirely different interface, it is
       necessary to ensure that you have the correct NTLM module.

       In addition, there have been problems with incompatibilities between different versions of Mime::Base64,
       which Bush's Authen::NTLM makes use of.  Therefore, it is necessary to ensure that your Mime::Base64
       module supports exporting of the "encode_base64" and "decode_base64" functions.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       The module is used indirectly through LWP, rather than including it directly in your code.  The LWP
       system will invoke the NTLM authentication when it encounters the authentication scheme while attempting
       to retrieve a URL from a server.  In order for the NTLM authentication to work, you must have a few
       things set up in your code prior to attempting to retrieve the URL:

       •   Enable persistent HTTP connections

           To do this, pass the "keep_alive=&gt;1" option to the LWP::UserAgent when creating it, like this:

               my $ua = LWP::UserAgent-&gt;new(keep_alive=&gt;1);

       •   Set the credentials on the UserAgent object

           The credentials must be set like this:

              $ua-&gt;credentials('www.company.com:80', '', "MyDomain\\MyUserCode", 'MyPassword');

           Note  that  you  cannot  use  the  HTTP::Request  object's  authorization_basic()  method  to set the
           credentials.  Note, too, that the 'www.company.com:80' portion only sets credentials on the specified
           port AND it is case-sensitive (this is due to the way LWP is  coded,  and  has  nothing  to  do  with
           LWP::Authen::Ntlm)

</pre><h4><b>AVAILABILITY</b></h4><pre>
       General queries regarding LWP should be made to the LWP Mailing List.
