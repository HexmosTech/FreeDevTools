</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Catalyst::TraitFor::Request::REST - A role to apply to Catalyst::Request giving it REST methods and
       attributes.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
            if ( $c-&gt;request-&gt;accepts('application/json') ) {
                ...
            }

            my $types = $c-&gt;request-&gt;accepted_content_types();

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This is a Moose::Role applied to Catalyst::Request that adds a few methods to the request object to
       facilitate writing REST-y code.  Currently, these methods are all related to the content types accepted
       by the client and the content type sent in the request.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       data
           If  the  request  went through the Deserializer action, this method will return the deserialized data
           structure.

       accepted_content_types
           Returns an array reference of content types accepted by the client.

           The list of types is created by looking at the following sources:

           •       Content-type header

                   If this exists, this will always be the first type in the list.

           •       content-type parameter

                   If the request is a GET request and there is a "content-type" parameter in the query  string,
                   this will come before any types in the Accept header.

           •       Accept header

                   This will be parsed and the types found will be ordered by the relative quality specified for
                   each type.

           If a type appears in more than one of these places, it is ordered based on where it is first found.

       preferred_content_type
           This returns the first content type found. It is shorthand for:

             $request-&gt;accepted_content_types-&gt;[0]

       accepts($type)
           Given a content type, this returns true if the type is accepted.

           Note that this does not do any wildcard expansion of types.
