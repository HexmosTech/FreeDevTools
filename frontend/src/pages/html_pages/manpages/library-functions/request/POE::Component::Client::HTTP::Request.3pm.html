</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       POE::Component::Client::HTTP::Request - an HTTP request class

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 0.949

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         # Used internally by POE::Component::Client::HTTP

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       POE::Component::Client::HTTP::Request encapsulates the state of requests POE::Component::Client::HTTP
       requests throughout their life cycles.  There turns out to be a lot of state to manage.

</pre><h4><b>CONSTRUCTOR</b></h4><pre>
   <b>new</b> <b>NAMED_PARAMETERS</b>
       Create a POE::Component::Client::HTTP object to manage a request.  The constructor takes several named
       parameters:

       Request =&gt; HTTP_REQUEST
         A POE::Component::Client::HTTP::Request object encapsulates a plain HTTP::Request.  Required.

       Factory =&gt; POE_COMPONENT_CLIENT_HTTP_REQUESTFACTORY
         The  request  may create additional requests during its lifetime, for example when following redirects.
         The Factory parameter specifies the POE::Component::Client::HTTP::RequestFactory that may  be  used  to
         create them.  Required.

       Postback =&gt; RESPONSE_POSTBACK
         POE::Component::Client::HTTP  creates  a postback that will be used to send responses to the requesting
         session.  Required.

       Progress =&gt; PROGRESS_POSTBACK
         Sets the progress notification if the user has requested progress events.  Optional.

       Proxy
         Sets the proxy used for this request, if requested by the user.  Optional.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>ID</b>
       Return the request's unique ID.

   <b>return_response</b>
       Sends a response back to the user's session.  Called  by  POE::Component::Client::HTTP  when  a  complete
       response has arrived.

   <b>add_eof</b>
       Called by POE::Component::Client::HTTP to indicate EOF has arrived.

   <b>add_content</b> <b>PARSED_DATA</b>
       Called  by  POE::Component::Client::HTTP  to  add  content  data  to an incrementally built response.  If
       PARSED_DATA is an object, it is treated like an HTTP::Headers object and its headers are assimilated into
       the response being built by the request.   Otherwise  the  PARSED_DATA  is  appended  to  the  response's
       content.

   <b>timer</b> <b>TIMER</b>
       Accessor  to  manipulate  the  request's  timeout timer.  Sets the request's timer if TIMER is specified,
       otherwise merely fetches the one currently associated with the request.

   <b>create_timer</b> <b>TIMEOUT</b>
       Creates and sets a timer for this request.  TIMEOUT is the number of seconds this request may live.

   <b>remove_timeout</b>
       Turn off the timer associated with this request, and discard it.

   <b>postback</b> <b>POSTBACK</b>
       Accessor to manipulate the postback associated with this request.   Sets  the  postback  if  POSTBACK  is
       defined, otherwise merely fetches it.

   <b>does_redirect</b> <b>SOMETHING</b>
       FIXME - Not sure what this accessor does.

   <b>check_redirect</b>
       Check  whether  the  last  response  is a redirect, the request is permitted to follow redirects, and the
       maximum number of redirects has not been met.  Initiate a redirect if all conditions are favorable.

   <b>close_connection</b>
       Each active request object contains an internal connection.  This method closes it.

   <b>send_to_wheel</b>
       Transmit the request to the socket associated with this request.

   <b>wheel</b>
       An accessor to return the wheel associated with this request.

   <b>error</b> <b>ERROR_CODE,</b> <b>ERROR_MESSAGE</b>
       Generate an error response, and post it back to the user's session.

   <b>connect_error</b> <b>CONNECT_FAILURE_MESSAGE</b>
       Generate a connection error response, and post it back to the user's session.

   <b>host</b>
       Return the host this request is attempting to work with.

   <b>port</b>
       Return the port this request is attempting to work with.

   <b>scheme</b>
       Return the scheme for this request.
