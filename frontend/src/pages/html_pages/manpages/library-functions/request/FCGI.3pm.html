       FCGI - Fast CGI module

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use FCGI;

           my $count = 0;
           my $request = FCGI::Request();

           while($request-&gt;Accept() &gt;= 0) {
               print("Content-type: text/html\r\n\r\n", ++$count);
           }

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Functions:

       FCGI::Request
           Creates a request handle. It has the following optional parameters:

           input perl file handle (default: \*STDIN)
           output perl file handle (default: \*STDOUT)
           error perl file handle (default: \*STDERR)
                   These filehandles will be setup to act as input/output/error on successful Accept.

           environment hash reference (default: \%ENV)
                   The hash will be populated with the environment.

           socket (default: 0)
                   Socket  to  communicate  with the server.  Can be the result of the OpenSocket function.  For
                   the moment, it's the file descriptor of the socket that should be passed. This may change  in
                   the future.

                   You  should only use your own socket if your program is not started by a process manager such
                   as mod_fastcgi (except for the FastCgiExternalServer case)  or  cgi-fcgi.   If  you  use  the
                   option,  you  have  to  let  your  FastCGI  server know which port (and possibly server) your
                   program is listening on.  See remote.pl for an example.

           flags (default: FCGI::FAIL_ACCEPT_ON_INTR)
                   Possible values:

                   FCGI::FAIL_ACCEPT_ON_INTR
                               If set, Accept will fail if interrupted.  It  not  set,  it  will  just  keep  on
                               waiting.

           Example usage:
               my $req = FCGI::Request;

           or:
               my %env;
               my $in = new IO::Handle;
               my $out = new IO::Handle;
               my $err = new IO::Handle;
               my $req = FCGI::Request($in, $out, $err, \%env);

       FCGI::OpenSocket(path, backlog)
           Creates a socket suitable to use as an argument to Request.

           path    Pathname  of  socket  or  colon followed by local tcp port.  Note that some systems take file
                   permissions into account on Unix domain sockets, so you'll have to make sure that the  server
                   can  write  to  the  created  file,  by  changing  the  umask before the call and/or changing
                   permissions and/or group of the file afterwards.

           backlog Maximum length of the queue of pending connections.  If a connection request arrives with the
                   queue full the client may receive an  error  with  an  indication of ECONNREFUSED.

       FCGI::CloseSocket(socket)
           Close a socket opened with OpenSocket.

       $req-&gt;<b>Accept()</b>
           Accepts a connection on $req, attaching the filehandles and populating the environment hash.  Returns
           0 on success.  If a connection has been accepted before, the old one will be finished first.

           Note that unlike with the old interface, no die and warn handlers  are  installed  by  default.  This
           means  that  if  you are not running an sfio enabled perl, any warn or die message will not end up in
           the server's log by default.  It is advised you set up  die  and  warn  handlers  yourself.   FCGI.pm
           contains an example of die and warn handlers.

       $req-&gt;<b>Finish()</b>
           Finishes accepted connection.  Also detaches filehandles.

       $req-&gt;<b>Flush()</b>
           Flushes accepted connection.

       $req-&gt;<b>Detach()</b>
           Temporarily detaches filehandles on an accepted connection.

       $req-&gt;<b>Attach()</b>
           Re-attaches filehandles on an accepted connection.

       $req-&gt;<b>LastCall()</b>
           Tells  the  library  not  to accept any more requests on this handle.  It should be safe to call this
           method from signal handlers.

           Note that this method is still experimental and everything about it, including its name,  is  subject
           to change.

       $env = $req-&gt;<b>GetEnvironment()</b>
           Returns the environment parameter passed to FCGI::Request.

       ($in, $out, $err) = $req-&gt;<b>GetHandles()</b>
           Returns the file handle parameters passed to FCGI::Request.

       $isfcgi = $req-&gt;<b>IsFastCGI()</b>
           Returns whether or not the program was run as a FastCGI.

</pre><h4><b>LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       FCGI.pm isn't Unicode aware, only characters within the range 0x00-0xFF are supported. Attempts to output
       strings containing characters above 0xFF results in a exception: (F) "Wide character in %s".

       Users  who wants the previous (FCGI.pm &lt;= 0.68) incorrect behavior can disable the exception by using the
       "bytes" pragma.

           {
               use bytes;
               print "\x{263A}";
           }
