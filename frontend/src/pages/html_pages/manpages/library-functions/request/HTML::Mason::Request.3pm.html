</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       HTML::Mason::Request - Mason Request Class

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           $m-&gt;abort (...)
           $m-&gt;comp (...)
           etc.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The Request API is your gateway to all Mason features not provided by syntactic tags. Mason creates a new
       Request object for every web request. Inside a component you access the current request object via the
       global $m.  Outside of a component, you can use the class method "instance".

</pre><h4><b>COMPONENT</b> <b>PATHS</b></h4><pre>
       The methods Request-&gt;comp, Request-&gt;comp_exists, and Request-&gt;fetch_comp take a component path argument.
       Component paths are like URL paths, and always use a forward slash (/) as the separator, regardless of
       what your operating system uses.

       •   If  the path is absolute (starting with a '/'), then the component is found relative to the component
           root.

       •   If the path is relative (no leading '/'), then  the  component  is  found  relative  to  the  current
           component directory.

       •   If the path matches both a subcomponent and file-based component, the subcomponent takes precedence.

</pre><h4><b>PARAMETERS</b> <b>TO</b> <b>THE</b> <b>new()</b> <b>CONSTRUCTOR</b></h4><pre>
       autoflush
           True  or  false,  default is false. Indicates whether to flush the output buffer ("$m-&gt;flush_buffer")
           after every string is output. Turn on autoflush if you need to send partial output to the client, for
           example in a progress meter.

           As of Mason 1.3, autoflush will only work if  enable_autoflush  has  been  set.   Components  can  be
           compiled more efficiently if they don't have to check for autoflush. Before using autoflush you might
           consider whether a few manual "$m-&gt;flush_buffer" calls would work nearly as well.

       data_cache_api
           The "$m-&gt;cache" API to use:

           •   '1.1', the default, indicates a "Cache::Cache" based API.

           •   'chi' indicates a "CHI" based API.

           •   '1.0'  indicates the custom cache API used in Mason 1.0x and earlier. This compatibility layer is
               provided as a convenience for users upgrading from older versions  of  Mason,  but  will  not  be
               supported indefinitely.

       data_cache_defaults
           A  hash  reference  of  default  options  to  use  for  the "$m-&gt;cache" command.  For example, to use
           Cache::Cache's "MemoryCache" implementation by default:

               data_cache_defaults =&gt; {cache_class =&gt; 'MemoryCache'}

           To use the CHI "FastMmap" driver by default:

               data_cache_api      =&gt; 'CHI',
               data_cache_defaults =&gt; {driver =&gt; 'FastMmap'},

           These settings are overridden by options given to particular "$m-&gt;cache" calls.

       dhandler_name
           File name used for dhandlers. Default is "dhandler".  If this is set to an  empty  string  ("")  then
           dhandlers are turned off entirely.

       error_format
           Indicates how errors are formatted. The built-in choices are

           •   <u>brief</u> - just the error message with no trace information

           •   <u>text</u> - a multi-line text format

           •   <u>line</u>  - a single-line text format, with different pieces of information separated by tabs (useful
               for log files)

           •   <u>html</u> - a fancy html format

           The default format under Apache and CGI is either <u>line</u> or <u>html</u> depending on whether the error mode is
           <u>fatal</u> or <u>output</u>, respectively. The default for standalone mode is <u>text</u>.

           The formats correspond to "HTML::Mason::Exception" methods named as_<u>format</u>. You can define  your  own
           format  by  creating  an appropriately named method; for example, to define an "xml" format, create a
           method "HTML::Mason::Exception::as_xml" patterned after one of the built-in methods.

       error_mode
           Indicates how errors are returned to the caller.  The choices are <u>fatal</u>, meaning die with the  error,
           and <u>output</u>, meaning output the error just like regular output.

           The  default  under  Apache and CGI is <u>output</u>, causing the error to be displayed in the browser.  The
           default for standalone mode is <u>fatal</u>.

       component_error_handler
           A code reference used to handle errors thrown during component compilation or  runtime.  By  default,
           this  is  a  subroutine that turns non-exception object errors in components into exceptions. If this
           parameter is set to a false value, these errors are simply rethrown as-is.

           Turning exceptions into objects can be expensive, since this will cause the  generation  of  a  stack
           trace  for  each  error. If you are using strings or unblessed references as exceptions in your code,
           you may want to turn this off as a performance boost.

       max_recurse
           The maximum recursion depth for the component stack, for the request stack, and for  the  inheritance
           stack. An error is signalled if the maximum is exceeded.  Default is 32.

       out_method
           Indicates  where  to send output. If out_method is a reference to a scalar, output is appended to the
           scalar.  If out_method is a reference to a subroutine, the subroutine  is  called  with  each  output
           string. For example, to send output to a file called "mason.out":

               my $fh = new IO::File "&gt;mason.out";
               ...
               out_method =&gt; sub { $fh-&gt;print($_[0]) }

           By  default,  out_method  prints  to  standard output. Under Apache, standard output is redirected to
           "$r-&gt;print".

       plugins
           An array of plugins that will be  called  at  various  stages  of  request  processing.   Please  see
           HTML::Mason::Plugin for details.

</pre><h4><b>ACCESSOR</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       All  of  the  above  properties have standard accessor methods of the same name. In general, no arguments
       retrieves the value, and one argument sets and returns the value.  For example:

           my $max_recurse_level = $m-&gt;max_recurse;
           $m-&gt;<a href="../man1/autoflush.1.html">autoflush</a>(1);

</pre><h4><b>OTHER</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       abort ([return value])
           Ends the current request, finishing the page  without  returning  through  components.  The  optional
           argument  specifies  the  return  value  from  "Interp::exec";  in a web environment, this ultimately
           becomes the HTTP status code.

           "abort" is implemented by throwing an HTML::Mason::Exception::Abort object and can thus be caught  by
           <b>eval()</b>.  The  "aborted"  method is a shortcut for determining whether a caught error was generated by
           "abort".

           If "abort" is called from a component that has a "&lt;%filter&gt;", than any output generated  up  to  that
           point is filtered, <u>unless</u> "abort" is called from a "&lt;%shared&gt;" block.

       clear_and_abort ([return value])
           This  method is syntactic sugar for calling clear_buffer() and then abort().  If you are aborting the
           request because of an error, you will often want to  clear  the  buffer  first  so  that  any  output
           generated up to that point is not sent to the client.

       aborted ([$err])
           Returns  true or undef indicating whether the specified $err was generated by "abort". If no $err was
           passed, uses $@.

           In this code, we catch and process fatal errors while letting "abort" exceptions pass through:

               eval { code_that_may_fail_or_abort() };
               if ($@) {
                   die $@ if $m-&gt;aborted;

                   # handle fatal errors...

           $@ can lose its value quickly, so if you are planning to call $m-&gt;aborted more than a few lines after
           the eval, you should save $@ to a temporary variable.

       base_comp
           Returns the current base component.

           Here are the rules that determine base_comp as you move from component to component.

           •   At the beginning of a request, the base component  is  initialized  to  the  requested  component
               ("$m-&gt;request_comp()").

           •   When you call a regular component via a path, the base component changes to the called component.

           •   When  you  call  a  component method via a path (/foo/bar:baz), the base component changes to the
               method's owner.

           •   The base component does not change when:

               •   a component call is made to a component object

               •   a component call is made to SELF:x or PARENT:x or REQUEST:x

               •   a component call is made to a subcomponent (&lt;%def&gt;)

           This may return nothing if the base component is  not  yet  known,  for  example  inside  a  plugin's
           start_request_hook()  method, where we have created a request but it does not yet know anything about
           the component being called.

       cache
           "$m-&gt;cache" returns a new cache object with a namespace specific to this component. The parameters to
           and return value from "$m-&gt;cache" differ depending on which data_cache_api you are using.

           If data_cache_api = 1.1 (default)
               <u>cache_class</u> specifies the class of cache object to create. It defaults  to  "FileCache"  in  most
               cases,  or "MemoryCache" if the interpreter has no data directory, and must be a backend subclass
               of "Cache::Cache". The prefix "Cache::" need not be included.  See the "Cache::Cache" package for
               a full list of backend subclasses.

               Beyond that, <u>cache_options</u> may include any valid options to the <b>new()</b> method of the cache  class.
               e.g. for "FileCache", valid options include "default_expires_in" and "cache_depth".

               See HTML::Mason::Cache::BaseCache for information about the object returned from "$m-&gt;cache".

           If data_cache_api = CHI
               <u>chi_root_class</u>  specifies  the  factory  class  that  will be called to create cache objects. The
               default is 'CHI'.

               <u>driver</u> specifies the driver to use, for example "Memory" or "FastMmap".  The default is "File" in
               most cases, or "Memory" if the interpreter has no data directory.

               Beyond that, <u>cache_options</u> may include any valid options to the <b>new()</b> method of the driver.  e.g.
               for the "File" driver, valid options include "expires_in" and "depth".

       cache_self ([expires_in =&gt; '...'], [key =&gt; '...'], [get_options], [cache_options])
           "$m-&gt;cache_self" caches the entire output and return result of a component.

           "cache_self" either returns undef, or a list containing the return value of the component followed by
           '1'.  You  should  return  immediately upon getting the latter result, as this indicates that you are
           inside the second invocation of the component.

           "cache_self" takes any  of  parameters  to  "$m-&gt;cache"  (e.g.  <u>cache_depth</u>),  any  of  the  optional
           parameters to "$cache-&gt;get" (<u>expire_if</u>, <u>busy_lock</u>), and two additional options:

           •   <u>expire_in</u> or <u>expires_in</u>: Indicates when the cache expires - it is passed as the third argument to
               "$cache-&gt;set". e.g. '10 sec', '5 min', '2 hours'.

           •   <u>key</u>:  An  identifier  used  to  uniquely  identify  the cache results - it is passed as the first
               argument to "$cache-&gt;get" and "$cache-&gt;set".  The default key is '__mason_cache_self__'.

           To cache the component's output:

               &lt;%init&gt;
               return if $m-&gt;cache_self(expire_in =&gt; '10 sec'[, key =&gt; 'fookey']);
               ... &lt;rest of init&gt; ...
               &lt;/%init&gt;

           To cache the component's scalar return value:

               &lt;%init&gt;
               my ($result, $cached) = $m-&gt;cache_self(expire_in =&gt; '5 min'[, key =&gt; 'fookey']);

               return $result if $cached;
               ... &lt;rest of init&gt; ...
               &lt;/%init&gt;

           To cache the component's list return value:

               &lt;%init&gt;
               my (@retval) = $m-&gt;cache_self(expire_in =&gt; '3 hours'[, key =&gt; 'fookey']);

               return @retval if pop @retval;
               ... &lt;rest of init&gt; ...
               &lt;/%init&gt;

           We call "pop" on @retval to remove the mandatory '1' at the end of the list.

           If a component has a "&lt;%filter&gt;" block, then the <u>filtered</u> output is cached.

           Note: users upgrading from 1.0x and earlier can continue to  use  the  old  "$m-&gt;cache_self"  API  by
           setting data_cache_api to '1.0'.  This support will be removed at a later date.

           See  the  the  DATA  CACHING  section  of  the  developer's manual section for more details on how to
           exercise finer control over caching.

       caller_args
           Returns the arguments passed by the component at the specified stack level. Use a  positive  argument
           to count from the current component and a negative argument to count from the component at the bottom
           of the stack. e.g.

               $m-&gt;<a href="../man0/caller_args.0.html">caller_args</a>(0)   # arguments passed to current component
               $m-&gt;<a href="../man1/caller_args.1.html">caller_args</a>(1)   # arguments passed to component that called us
               $m-&gt;caller_args(-1)  # arguments passed to first component executed

           When  called in scalar context, a hash reference is returned.  When called in list context, a list of
           arguments (which may be assigned to a hash) is returned.  Returns undef or an empty  list,  depending
           on context, if the specified stack level does not exist.

       callers
           With  no arguments, returns the current component stack as a list of component objects, starting with
           the current component and ending with the top-level component. With one numeric argument, returns the
           component object at that index in the list. Use  a  positive  argument  to  count  from  the  current
           component and a negative argument to count from the component at the bottom of the stack. e.g.

               my @comps = $m-&gt;callers   # all components
               $m-&gt;<a href="../man0/callers.0.html">callers</a>(0)            # current component
               $m-&gt;<a href="../man1/callers.1.html">callers</a>(1)            # component that called us
               $m-&gt;callers(-1)           # first component executed

           Returns undef or an empty list, depending on context, if the specified stack level does not exist.

       caller
           A synonym for "$m-&gt;<a href="../man1/callers.1.html">callers</a>(1)", i.e. the component that called the currently executing component.

       call_next ([args...])
           Calls  the  next component in the content wrapping chain; usually called from an autohandler. With no
           arguments, the original arguments are passed to the component.  Any arguments specified here serve to
           augment and override (in case of conflict) the original arguments. Works like "$m-&gt;comp" in terms  of
           return  value  and  scalar/list  context.  See the autohandlers section of the developer's manual for
           examples.

       call_self (output, return, error, tag)
           This method allows a component to call itself so that it  can  filter  both  its  output  and  return
           values.  It is fairly advanced; for most purposes the "&lt;%filter&gt;" tag will be sufficient and simpler.

           "$m-&gt;call_self" takes four arguments, all of them optional.

           output - scalar reference that will be populated with the component output.
           return - scalar reference that will be populated with the component return value.
           error - scalar reference that will be populated with the error thrown by the component, if any. If
           this parameter is not defined, then call_self will not catch errors.
           tag - a name for this call_self invocation; can almost always be omitted.

           "$m-&gt;call_self"  acts  like  a  fork()  in the sense that it will return twice with different values.
           When it returns 0, you allow control to pass through to the rest of your component.  When it  returns
           1,  that  means  the  component  has finished and you can examine the output, return value and error.
           (Don't worry, it doesn't really do a fork! See next section for explanation.)

           The following examples would generally appear at the top of a "&lt;%init&gt;" section.   Here  is  a  no-op
           "$m-&gt;call_self" that leaves the output and return value untouched:

               &lt;%init&gt;
               my ($output, $retval);
               if ($m-&gt;call_self(\$output, \$retval)) {
                   $m-&gt;print($output);
                   return $retval;
               }
               ...

           Here  is  a  simple  output filter that makes the output all uppercase.  Note that we ignore both the
           original and the final return value.

               &lt;%init&gt;
               my ($output, $error);
               if ($m-&gt;call_self(\$output, undef)) {
                   $m-&gt;print(uc $output);
                   return;
               }
               ...

           Here is a piece of code that traps all errors occurring anywhere in a component or its children, e.g.
           for the purpose of handling application-specific exceptions. This is difficult to do  with  a  manual
           "eval" because it would have to span multiple code sections and the main component body.

               &lt;%init&gt;
               my ($output, undef, $error);
               if ($m-&gt;call_self(\$output, undef, \$error)) {
                   if ($error) {
                       # check $error and do something with it
                   }
                   $m-&gt;print($output);
                   return;
               }
               ...

       clear_buffer
           Clears  the  Mason  output buffer. Any output sent before this line is discarded. Useful for handling
           error conditions that can only be detected in the middle of a request.

           clear_buffer is, of course, thwarted by "flush_buffer".

       comp (comp, args...)
           Calls the component designated by <u>comp</u> with the specified option/value pairs. <u>comp</u> may be a component
           path or a component object.

           Components work exactly like Perl subroutines in terms of return values and context. A component  can
           return any type of value, which is then returned from the "$m-&gt;comp" call.

           The &lt;&amp; &amp;&gt; tag provides a convenient shortcut for "$m-&gt;comp".

           As  of  1.10,  component calls can accept an initial hash reference of <u>modifiers</u>.  The only currently
           supported modifier is "store", which stores  the  component's  output  in  a  scalar  reference.  For
           example:

             my $buf;
             my $return = $m-&gt;comp( { store =&gt; \$buf }, '/some/comp', type =&gt; 'big' );

           This  mostly  duplicates  the  behavior  of  <u>scomp</u>, but can be useful in rare cases where you need to
           capture both a component's output and return value.

           This modifier can be used with the &lt;&amp; &amp;&gt; tag as well, for example:

             &lt;&amp; { store =&gt; \$buf }, '/some/comp', size =&gt; 'medium' &amp;&gt;

       comp_exists (comp_path)
           Returns 1 if <u>comp_path</u> is the path of an existing component, 0 otherwise.  <u>comp_path</u> may be any  path
           accepted by comp or fetch_comp, including method or subcomponent paths.

           Depending on implementation, &lt;comp_exists&gt; may try to load the component referred to by the path, and
           may throw an error if the component contains a syntax error.

       content
           Evaluates  the  content  (passed  between  &lt;&amp;|  comp  &amp;&gt; and &lt;/&amp;&gt; tags) of the current component, and
           returns the resulting text.

           Returns undef if there is no content.

       has_content
           Returns true if the component was called with content (i.e. with &lt;&amp;| comp &amp;&gt; and &lt;/&amp;&gt; tags instead of
           a single &lt;&amp; comp &amp;&gt; tag). This is generally better than checking the  defined'ness  of  "$m-&gt;content"
           because it will not try to evaluate the content.

       count
           Returns the number of this request, which is unique for a given request and interpreter.

       current_args
           Returns  the  arguments  passed  to  the  current  component.  When  called in scalar context, a hash
           reference is returned.  When called in list context, a list of arguments (which may be assigned to  a
           hash) is returned.

       current_comp
           Returns the current component object.

       decline
           Used from a top-level component or dhandler, this method clears the output buffer, aborts the current
           request  and  restarts  with the next applicable dhandler up the tree. If no dhandler is available, a
           not-found error occurs.

           This method bears no relation to the Apache DECLINED status except in name.

       declined ([$err])
           Returns true or undef indicating whether the specified $err was generated by "decline".  If  no  $err
           was passed, uses $@.

       depth
           Returns  the current size of the component stack.  The lowest possible value is 1, which indicates we
           are in the top-level component.

       dhandler_arg
           If the request has been handled by a dhandler, this method  returns  the  remainder  of  the  URI  or
           "Interp::exec" path when the dhandler directory is removed. Otherwise returns undef.

           "dhandler_arg" may be called from any component in the request, not just the dhandler.

       exec (comp, args...)
           Starts  the  request  by executing the top-level component and arguments. This is normally called for
           you on the main request, but you can use it to execute subrequests.

           A request can only be executed once; e.g. it is an  error  to  call  this  recursively  on  the  same
           request.

       fetch_comp (comp_path)
           Given a <u>comp_path</u>, returns the corresponding component object or undef if no such component exists.

       fetch_next
           Returns  the  next  component  in the content wrapping chain, or undef if there is no next component.
           Usually called from an autohandler.  See the autohandlers section of the developer's manual for usage
           and examples.

       fetch_next_all
           Returns a list of the remaining components in the content wrapping  chain.  Usually  called  from  an
           autohandler.  See the autohandlers section of the developer's manual for usage and examples.

       file (filename)
           Returns  the  contents  of  <u>filename</u>  as a string. If <u>filename</u> is a relative path, Mason prepends the
           current component directory.

       flush_buffer
           Flushes the Mason output buffer. Under mod_perl, also sends HTTP headers if they  haven't  been  sent
           and calls "$r-&gt;rflush" to flush the Apache buffer. Flushing the initial bytes of output can make your
           servers appear more responsive.

           Attempts  to flush the buffers are ignored within the context of a call to "$m-&gt;scomp" or when output
           is being stored in a scalar reference, as with the " { store =&gt; \$out } " component call modifier.

           "&lt;%filter&gt;" blocks will process the output whenever the buffers are flushed.  If "autoflush"  is  on,
           your data may be filtered in small pieces.

       instance
           This  class  method  returns  the  "HTML::Mason::Request"  currently in use.  If called when no Mason
           request is active it will return "undef".

           If called inside a subrequest, it returns the subrequest object.

       interp
           Returns the Interp object associated with this request.

       make_subrequest (comp =&gt; path, args =&gt; arrayref, other parameters)
           This method creates a new Request object which inherits its parent's  settable  properties,  such  as
           autoflush and out_method.  These values may be overridden by passing parameters to this method.

           The "comp" parameter is required, while all other parameters are optional.  It may be specified as an
           absolute path or as a path relative to the current component.

           See the subrequests section of the developer's manual for more information about subrequests.

       log Returns  a "Log::Any" logger with a log category specific to the current component.  The category for
           a component "/foo/bar" would be "HTML::Mason::Component::foo::bar".

       notes (key, value)
           The notes() method provides a place to store application data, giving developers a way to share  data
           among  multiple  components.  Any data stored here persists for the duration of the request, i.e. the
           same lifetime as the Request object.

           Conceptually, notes() contains a hash of key-value pairs.  "notes($key, $value)" stores a  new  entry
           in  this hash.  notes($key) returns a previously stored value.  notes() without any arguments returns
           a reference to the entire hash of key-value pairs.

           notes() is similar to the mod_perl method "$r-&gt;pnotes()".  The main differences are that this notes()
           can be used in a non-mod_perl environment, and that its lifetime is tied to the <u>Mason</u> request object,
           not the <u>Apache</u> request object.  In particular, a Mason subrequest has its own notes() structure,  but
           would access the same "$r-&gt;pnotes()" structure.

       out (string)
           A synonym for "$m-&gt;print".

       print (string)
           Print  the  given <u>string</u>. Rarely needed, since normally all text is just placed in the component body
           and output implicitly. "$m-&gt;print" is useful if you need to output something in the middle of a  Perl
           block.

           In  1.1  and  on,  "print"  and  "$r-&gt;print"  are  remapped  to  "$m-&gt;print",  so  they  may  be used
           interchangeably. Before 1.1, one should only use "$m-&gt;print".

       request_args
           Returns the arguments originally passed to the top level component (see request_comp for definition).
           When called in scalar context, a hash reference is returned. When called in list context, a  list  of
           arguments (which may be assigned to a hash) is returned.

       request_comp
           Returns the component originally called in the request. Without autohandlers, this is the same as the
           first component executed.  With autohandlers, this is the component at the end of the "$m-&gt;call_next"
           chain.

       request_depth
           Returns  the  current  size  of  the request/subrequest stack.  The lowest possible value is 1, which
           indicates we are in the top-level request.  A value of 2 indicates we are inside a subrequest of  the
           top-level request, and so on.

       scomp (comp, args...)
           Like comp, but returns the component output as a string instead of printing it. (Think sprintf versus
           printf.) The component's return value is discarded.

       subexec (comp, args...)
           This  method  creates  a  new  subrequest  with  the specified top-level component and arguments, and
           executes it. This is most often used to perform an "internal redirect" to a new component  such  that
           autohandlers and dhandlers take effect.

       time
           Returns the interpreter's notion of the current time (deprecated).

</pre><h4><b>APACHE-ONLY</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       These additional methods are available when running Mason with mod_perl and the ApacheHandler.

       ah  Returns the ApacheHandler object associated with this request.

       apache_req
           Returns the Apache request object.  This is also available in the global $r.

       auto_send_headers
           True  or  false,  default  is  true.   Indicates whether Mason should automatically send HTTP headers
           before  sending  content  back  to  the  client.   If   you   set   to   false,   you   should   call
           "$r-&gt;send_http_header" manually.

           See  the  sending HTTP headers section of the developer's manual for more details about the automatic
           header feature.

           NOTE: This parameter has no effect under  mod_perl-2,  since  calling  "$r-&gt;send_http_header"  is  no
           longer needed.

</pre><h4><b>CGI-ONLY</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       This additional method is available when running Mason with the CGIHandler module.

       cgi_request
           Returns the Apache request emulation object, which is available as $r inside components.

           See the CGIHandler docs for more details.

</pre><h4><b>APACHE-</b> <b>OR</b> <b>CGI-ONLY</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       This method is available when Mason is running under either the ApacheHandler or CGIHandler modules.

       cgi_object
           Returns the CGI object used to parse any CGI parameters submitted to the component, assuming that you
           have  not changed the default value of the ApacheHandler args_method parameter.  If you are using the
           'mod_perl' args method, then calling this method  is  a  fatal  error.   See  the  ApacheHandler  and
           CGIHandler documentation for more details.

       redirect ($url, [$status])
           Given  a  url,  this  generates a proper HTTP redirect for that URL. It uses "$m-&gt;clear_and_abort" to
           clear out any previous output, and abort the request.  By default, the status code used is  302,  but
           this can be overridden by the user.

           Since  this is implemented using "$m-&gt;abort", it will be trapped by an " eval {} " block.  If you are
           using an " eval {} " block in your code to trap errors, you  need  to  make  sure  to  rethrow  these
           exceptions, like this:

             eval {
                 ...
             };

             die $@ if $m-&gt;aborted;

             # handle other exceptions
