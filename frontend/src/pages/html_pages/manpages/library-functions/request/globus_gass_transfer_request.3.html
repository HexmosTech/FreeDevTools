       Request Handles.

       Request Handles

       Request handles are used by the GASS Transfer API to associate operations with a single file transfer
       request. Specifically, they are used to register multiple byte range buffers with a file transfer
       request, and to query the state of a transfer in-progress.

       To implement a server, the request handle is populated by the protocol module implementation. The server
       may use the functions in this section to determine information about what the client is requesting.

       To implement a client, the request handle should be queried after the blocking call or initial callback
       has been invoked to determine if the request has been authorized or referred, and after EOF, to determine
       whether the request has completed successfully.

       A request handle contains a pointer which may be used by the handler of the request to store a pointer to
       arbitrary application-specific data.

   <b>int</b> <b>globus_gass_transfer_request_destroy</b> <b>(globus_gass_transfer_request_t</b> <b>request)</b>
       Destroy a request handle.

       This  function  destroys  the  caller's  reference to a request handle. It must be called for all request
       handles which are created by  calling  functions  in  the  '@ref  globus_gass_transfer_client'  or  '@ref
       globus_gass_transfer_server'  sections  of  this  manual. After calling the function, the caller must not
       attempt to use the request handle for any purpose.

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>request</u> The request to destroy.

       <b>Return</b> <b>values</b>
           <u>GLOBUS_SUCCESS</u> The request handle reference was successfully destroyed.
           <u>GLOBUS_GASS_TRANSFER_ERROR_INVALID_USE</u> Either an invalid request handle  or  one  which  is  actively
           being used was passed to this function as the <u>request</u> parameter.

   <b>char</b> <b>*</b> <b>globus_gass_transfer_request_get_denial_message</b> <b>(globus_gass_transfer_request_t</b> <b>request)</b>
       Get an string describing why a request was denied.

       This  function  queries a request which was denied by a server to determine why it was denied. The denial
       reason will be expressed as a response string. The string must be freed by the caller.

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>request</u> A handle to the request to query.

       <b>Returns</b>
           A string indicating why the request was denied. If the request handle is invalid or the  request  was
           not denied, then this function returns GLOBUS_NULL.

       <b>See</b> <b>also</b>
           <b>globus_gass_transfer_request_get_denial_reason()</b>

   <b>int</b> <b>globus_gass_transfer_request_get_denial_reason</b> <b>(globus_gass_transfer_request_t</b> <b>request)</b>
       Get an integer code describing why the request was denied.

       This  function  queries a request which was denied by a server to determine why it was denied. The denial
       reason will be expressed in a protocol-specific response code. Knowledge of the  protocol  is  needed  to
       understand this response.

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>request</u> A handle to the request to query.

       <b>Returns</b>
           A  protocol-specific  integer indicating why the request was denied. If the request handle is invalid
           or the request was not denied, then this function returns 0.

       <b>See</b> <b>also</b>
           <b>globus_gass_transfer_request_get_denial_message()</b>

   <b>globus_size_t</b> <b>globus_gass_transfer_request_get_length</b> <b>(globus_gass_transfer_request_t</b> <b>request)</b>
       Get the length of a file to be transferred using GASS.

       This function queries the request handle to determine the amount of data that will be transferred to copy
       the URL. The length may be <u>GLOBUS_GASS_TRANSFER_LENGTH_UNKNOWN</u> if the sender can not determine the length
       before making or authorizing the request.

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>request</u> The request to query.

       <b>Returns</b>
           The length of the file located at the request's URL, or <u>GLOBUS_GASS_TRANSFER_LENGTH_UNKNOWN</u>  if  that
           cannot be determined.

   <b>int</b>         <b>globus_gass_transfer_request_get_referral</b>         <b>(globus_gass_transfer_request_t</b>        <b>request,</b>
       <b>globus_gass_transfer_referral_t</b> <b>*</b> <b>referral)</b>
       Extract referral information from a request handle.

       This function queries the request handle to determine any referral information  that  it  contains.  This
       function  should only be called on request handles in the GLOBUS_GASS_TRANSFER_REQUEST_REFERRED state. If
       no referral information is stored in the request handle, then the referral  will  be  initialized  to  an
       empty  referral. The referral must be destroyed by calling <b>globus_gass_transfer_referral_destroy()</b> by the
       caller.

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>request</u> The request handle to query.
           <u>referral</u> A pointer to an uninitialized referral structure. It  will  be  populated  by  calling  this
           function.

       <b>Return</b> <b>values</b>
           <u>GLOBUS_SUCCESS</u> The referral was successfully extracted from the request handle.
           <u>GLOBUS_GASS_TRANSFER_ERROR_NULL_POINTER</u> The referral pointer was GLOBUS_NULL;

   <b>globus_gass_transfer_request_status_t</b> <b>globus_gass_transfer_request_get_status</b> <b>(globus_gass_transfer_request_t</b>
       <b>request)</b>
       Check the status of a request.

       This  function  queries  a request to determine the status of the request. This function should be called
       after EOF has been reached, or after the initial get, put, or append has returned or  had  it's  callback
       function  called to determine if it is possible to proceed, or whether the file transfer was successfully
       processed.

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>request</u> The request handle to query.

       <b>Returns</b>
           A <b>globus_gass_transfer_request_status_t</b> indicating the current status of the request.

   <b>char</b> <b>*</b> <b>globus_gass_transfer_request_get_subject</b> <b>(globus_gass_transfer_request_t</b> <b>request)</b>
       Get the subject string associated with a request.

       This function queries a request handle to determine the subject identity of the client who initiated  the
       request. The string must not be freed by the caller.

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>request</u> A handle to the request to query.

       <b>Returns</b>
           A  string  containing the request initiator's subject identity. If the request handle is invalid or a
           credential was not used to initiate the request, this value will be GLOBUS_NULL.

       <b>request)</b>
       Determine the type of a request.

       This  function  is  used  by GASS server implementations to discover what type of operation the client is
       requesting for an URL.

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>request</u> The request to query.

       <b>Returns</b>
           The <b>type</b> of the request.

       Get the user pointer associated with a request

       This function extracts the user pointer from a request handle.  The  user-pointer  may  be  used  by  the
       application  which  is generating or servicing the request to store a pointer to any application-specific
       piece of data.

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>request</u> The request to query.

       <b>Returns</b>
           The user pointer's value.

   <b>void</b> <b>globus_gass_transfer_request_set_length</b> <b>(globus_gass_transfer_request_t</b> <b>request,</b> <b>globus_size_t</b> <b>length)</b>
       Set the length of a transfer associated request handle.

       This function modifies the given request handle  so  that  it's  length  field  is  set  to  give  length
       parameter.

       This  function  must only be called by protocol modules when constructing a request handle when receiving
       the response to a get request. This function can only be called once per request handle.

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>request</u> A handle to the request to modify.
           <u>length</u> The length of the file request.

       <b>Return</b> <b>values</b>
           <u>GLOBUS_SUCCESS</u> The URL was set for the request handle.
           <u>GLOBUS_GASS_TRANSFER_ERROR_INVALID_USE</u> The request handle was invalid, or the URL  had  already  been
           set.

   <b>int</b>          <b>globus_gass_transfer_request_set_type</b>          <b>(globus_gass_transfer_request_t</b>          <b>request,</b>
       <b>globus_gass_transfer_request_type_t</b> <b>type)</b>
       Set the type of a request.

       This function modifies a request handle by setting the type of operation that it is being used for.  This
       function may only be called once per handle, and only from a GASS protocol module implementation.

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>request</u> The request handle to modify.
           <u>type</u> The type of operation that this request handle will be used for.

       <b>Return</b> <b>values</b>
           <u>GLOBUS_SUCCESS</u> The request handle's type has been set.
           <u>GLOBUS_GASS_TRANSFER_ERROR_INVALID_USE</u>  The  request handle was invalid or it's type was already set.
           The request handle was not modified.

       <b>Note</b>
           Only GASS Protocol modules may call this function.

   <b>int</b> <b>globus_gass_transfer_request_set_url</b> <b>(globus_gass_transfer_request_t</b> <b>request,</b> <b>char</b> <b>*</b> <b>url)</b>
       Set the URL to which a request handle refers.

       This function modifies the given request handle so that it's URL field is set to  string  pointed  to  by
       <u>url</u>.

       No copy is made of the string, so the caller must not free it. It must be allocated by calling one of the
       memory allocators in globus_libc, as it will be freed when the request handle is destroyed.

       This function must only be called by protocol modules when constructing a request handle when accepting a
       new request. This function can only be called once per request handle.

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>request</u> A handle to the request to modify.
           <u>url</u> A string containing the URL that this request will be associated with.

       <b>Return</b> <b>values</b>
           <u>GLOBUS_SUCCESS</u> The URL was set for the request handle.
           <u>GLOBUS_GASS_TRANSFER_ERROR_INVALID_USE</u>  The  request  handle was invalid, or the URL had already been
