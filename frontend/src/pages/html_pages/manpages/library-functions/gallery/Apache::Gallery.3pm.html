</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Apache::Gallery - mod_perl handler to create an image gallery

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       See the INSTALL file in the distribution for installation instructions.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Apache::Gallery creates an thumbnail index of each directory and allows viewing pictures in different
       resolutions. Pictures are resized on the fly and cached. The gallery can be configured and customized in
       many ways and a custom copyright image can be added to all the images without modifying the original.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       In your httpd.conf you set the global options for the gallery. You can also override each of the options
       in .htaccess files in your gallery directories.

       The options are set in the httpd.conf/.htaccess file using the syntax: <b>PerlSetVar</b> <b>OptionName</b> <b>'value'</b>

       Example: <b>PerlSetVar</b> <b>GalleryCacheDir</b> <b>'/var/cache/www/'</b>

       <b>GalleryAutoRotate</b>
           Some  cameras, like the Canon G3, can detect the orientation of a the pictures you take and will save
           this information in the 'Orientation' EXIF field. Apache::Gallery will then automatically rotate your
           images.

           This behavior is default but can be disabled by setting GalleryAutoRotate to 0.

       <b>GalleryCacheDir</b>
           Directory where Apache::Gallery should  create  its  cache  with  scaled  pictures.  The  default  is
           /var/cache/www/  .  Here, a directory for each virtualhost or location will be created automatically.
           Make sure your webserver has write access to the CacheDir.

       <b>GalleryTemplateDir</b>
           Full path to the directory where you placed the templates. This option  can  be  used  both  in  your
           global  configuration  and  in  .htaccess files, this way you can have different layouts in different
           parts of your gallery.

           No default value, this option is required.

       <b>GalleryInfo</b>
           With this option you can define which EXIF information you would like to present from the image.  The
           format is: '&lt;MyName =&gt; KeyInEXIF, MyOtherName =&gt; OtherKeyInEXIF'

           Examples of keys: <b>ShutterSpeedValue</b>, <b>ApertureValue</b>, <b>SubjectDistance</b>, and <b>Camera</b>

           You can view all the keys from the EXIF header using this perl-oneliner:

           perl  "-e"  'use  Data::Dumper;  use  Image::Info  qw(image_info);  print Dumper(image_info(shift));'
           filename.jpg

           Default is: 'Picture Taken =&gt; DateTimeOriginal, Flash =&gt; Flash'

       <b>GallerySizes</b>
           Defines which widths images can be scaled to. Images cannot be scaled to other widths than  the  ones
           you define with this option.

           The default is '640 800 1024 1600'

       <b>GalleryThumbnailSize</b>
           Defines the width and height of the thumbnail images.

           Defaults to '100x75'

       <b>GalleryThumbnailSizeLS</b>
           If  set to '1', <b>GalleryThumbnailSize</b> is the long and the short side of the thumbnail image instead of
           the width and height.

           Defaults to '0'.

       <b>GalleryCopyrightImage</b>
           Image you want to blend into your images in the lower right corner. This could be a  transparent  png
           saying "copyright my name 2001".

           Optional.

       <b>GalleryWrapNavigation</b>
           Make  the  navigation in the picture view wrap around (So Next at the end displays the first picture,
           etc.)

           Set to 1 or 0, default is 0

       <b>GalleryAllowOriginal</b>
           Allow the user to download the Original picture without resizing or putting the CopyrightImage on it.

           Set to 1 or 0, default is 0

       <b>GalleryAllowThumbOnly</b>
           If true, <b>GalleryAllowThumbOnly</b> allows fooimg.jpg?thumbonly urls to output the thumbnail of the image.
           This is useful when including images in a blog (or similar).

           Defaults to '0' (false).

       <b>GallerySlideshowIntervals</b>
           With this option you can configure which intervals can be selected for a slideshow. The default is '3
           5 10 15 30'

       <b>GallerySortBy</b>
           Instead of the default filename ordering you can sort by any stat attribute. For example size, atime,
           mtime, ctime.

       <b>GalleryDirSortBy</b>
           Set this variable to sort directories differently than other items, can be set to size, atime,  mtime
           and ctime; setting any other value will revert to sorting by name.

       <b>GalleryMemoize</b>
           Cache  EXIF  data  using  Memoize - this will make Apache::Gallery faster when many people access the
           same images, but it will also cache EXIF data until the current Apache child dies.

       <b>GalleryUseFileDate</b>
           Set this option to 1 to make A::G show the files timestamp instead of the  EXIF  value  for  "Picture
           taken".

       <b>GallerySelectionMode</b>
           Enable the selection mode. Select images with checkboxes and get a list of filenames.

       <b>GalleryEXIFMode</b>
           You can choose how Apache::Gallery should display EXIF info from your images.

           The  default  setting  is 'namevalue'. This setting will make Apache::Gallery print out the names and
           values of the EXIF values you configure with GalleryInfo. The information will be parsed  into  $INFO
           in pictureinfo.tpl.

           You  can  also  set  it  to  'values'  which  will make A::G parse the configured values into the var
           $EXIFVALUES as 'value | value | value'

           If you set this option to 'variables' the items you configure in GalleryInfo  will  be  available  to
           your  templates  as  $EXIF_&lt;KEYNAME&gt;  (in  all  uppercase).  That means that with the default setting
           "Picture   Taken   =&gt;   DateTimeOriginal,   Flash   =&gt;   Flash"   you   will   have   the   variables
           $EXIF_DATETIMEORIGINAL  and  $EXIF_FLASH available to your templates. You can place them anywhere you
           want.

       <b>GalleryRootPath</b>
           Change the location of gallery root. The default is ""

       <b>GalleryRootText</b>
           Change the name that appears as the root element in the menu. The default is "root:"

       <b>GalleryMaxThumbnailsPerPage</b>
           This options controls how many thumbnails should be displayed in a page. It requires $BROWSELINKS  to
           be in the index.tpl template file.

       <b>GalleryImgFile</b>
           Pattern matching the files you want Apache::Gallery to view in the index as thumbnails.

           The default is '\.(jpe?g|png|tiff?|ppm)$'

       <b>GalleryDocFile</b>
           Pattern  matching  the files you want Apache::Gallery to view in the index as normal files. All other
           filetypes will still be served by Apache::Gallery but are not visible in the index.

           The default is '\.(mpe?g|avi|mov|asf|wmv|doc|mp3|mp4|ogg|pdf|rtf|wav|dlt|txt|html?|csv|eps)$'

       <b>GalleryTTFDir</b>
           To use the GalleryCopyrightText feature you must set this option to the  directory  where  your  True
           Type fonts are stored. No default is set.

           Example:

                   PerlSetVar      GalleryTTFDir '<a href="file:/usr/share/fonts/">/usr/share/fonts/</a>'

       <b>GalleryTTFFile</b>
           To use the GalleryCopyrightText feature this option must be set to the name of the True Type font you
           wish to use. Example:

                   PerlSetVar      GalleryTTFFile 'verdanab.ttf'

       <b>GalleryTTFSize</b>
           Configure  the  size  of the CopyrightText that will be inserted as copyright notice in the corner of
           your pictures.

           Example:

                   PerlSetVar      GalleryTTFSize '10'

       <b>GalleryCopyrightText</b>
           The text that will be inserted as copyright notice.

           Example:

                   PerlSetVar      GalleryCopyrightText '(c) Michael Legart'

       <b>GalleryCopyrightColor</b>
           The text color of your copyright notice.

           Examples:

           White:
                   PerlSetVar      GalleryCopyrightColor '255,255,255,255'

           Black:
                   PerlSetVar      GalleryCopyrightColor '0,0,0,255'

           Red:
                   PerlSetVar      GalleryCopyrightColor '255,0,0,255'

           Green:
                   PerlSetVar      GalleryCopyrightColor '0,255,0,255'

           Blue:
                   PerlSetVar      GalleryCopyrightColor '0,0,255,255'

           Transparent orange:
                   PerlSetVar      GalleryCopyrightColor '255,127,0,127'

       <b>GalleryCopyrightBackgroundColor</b>
           The background-color of a GalleryCopyrightText

           r,g,b,a - for examples, see GalleryCopyrightColor

       <b>GalleryQuality</b>
           The quality (1-100) of scaled images

           This setting affects the quality of the scaled images.  Set this to a low number to reduce  the  size
           of the scaled images.  Remember to clear out your cache if you change this setting.  Quality seems to
           default to 75, at least in the jpeg and png loader code in Imlib2 1.1.0.

           Examples:

           Quality at 50:
                   PerlSetVar      GalleryQuality '50'

       <b>GalleryUnderscoresToSpaces</b>
           Set  this option to 1 to convert underscores to spaces in the listing of directory and file names, as
           well as in the alt attribute for HTML &lt;img&gt; tags.

       <b>GalleryCommentExifKey</b>
           Set this option to e.g. ImageDescription to use this field as comments for images.

       <b>GalleryEnableMediaRss</b>
           Set this option to 1 to enable generation of a media RSS feed. This can be used  e.g.  together  with
           the PicLens plugin from <a href="http://piclens.com">http://piclens.com</a>

</pre><h4><b>FEATURES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Rotate</b> <b>images</b>
           Some  cameras, like the Canon G3, detects the orientation of a picture and adds this info to the EXIF
           header. Apache::Gallery detects this and automatically rotates images with this info.

           If your camera does not support this, you can rotate the images manually, This can also  be  used  to
           override  the rotate information from a camera that supports that. You can also disable this behavior
           with the GalleryAutoRotate option.

           To use this functionality you have to create file with the name  of  the  picture  you  want  rotated
           appended with ".rotate". The file should include a number where these numbers are supported:

                   "1", rotates clockwise by 90 degree
                   "2", rotates clockwise by 180 degrees
                   "3", rotates clockwise by 270 degrees

           So  if  we  want  to rotate "Picture1234.jpg" 90 degrees clockwise we would create a file in the same
           directory called "Picture1234.jpg.rotate" with the number 1 inside of it.

       <b>Ignore</b> <b>directories/files</b>
           To ignore a directory or a file (of any kind, not only images) you create  a  &lt;directory|file&gt;.ignore
           file.

       <b>Comments</b>
           To  include  comments  for a directory you create a &lt;directory&gt;.comment file where the first line can
           contain "TITLE: New title" which will be the title of the page, and a comment on the following lines.
           To include comments for each picture you create files called picture.jpg.comment where the first line
           can contain "TITLE: New title" which will be the title of the page, and a comment  on  the  following
           lines.

           Example:

                   TITLE: This is the new title of the page
                   And this is the comment.&lt;br /&gt;
                   And this is line two of the comment.

           The  visible name of the folder is by default identical to the name of the folder, but can be changed
           by creating a file &lt;directory&gt;.folder with the visible name of the folder.

           Similarly, the visible name of any file is by default identical to the name of the file, but  can  be
           changed by creating a file &lt;file&gt;.file with the visible name of the file.

           It is also possible to set GalleryCommentExifKey to the name of an EXIF field containing the comment,
           e.g. ImageDescription. The EXIF comment is overridden by the .comment file if it exists.
