</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       critcl_changes - CriTcl Releases &amp; Changes

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Be  welcome  to the <u>C</u> <u>Runtime</u> <u>In</u> <u>Tcl</u> (short: <u>CriTcl</u>), a system for embedding and using C code from within
       <u>Tcl</u> [<a href="http://core.tcl-lang.org/tcl">http://core.tcl-lang.org/tcl</a>] scripts.

       Adding C code to  <u>Tcl</u>  [<a href="http://core.tcl-lang.org/tcl">http://core.tcl-lang.org/tcl</a>]/<u>Tk</u>  [<a href="http://core.tcl-lang.org/tk">http://core.tcl-lang.org/tk</a>]  has  never  been
       easier.

       Improve performance by rewriting the performance bottlenecks in C.

       Import  the  functionality of shared libraries into Tcl scripts.  See the changes done in each release of
       <u>CriTcl</u>, from the latest at the top to the beginning of the project.

       The latest changes are found at the top.

</pre><h4><b>CHANGES</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>VERSION</b> <b>3.3.1</b></h4><pre>
       [1]    Oops. Added refresh of tcl 8.6, 8.7 headers which was left behind behind.

       [2]    Oops. Fixed mismatch of package directories computed by install vs uninstall.

</pre><h4><b>CHANGES</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>VERSION</b> <b>3.3</b></h4><pre>
       [1]    As announced with 3.2:

              [1]    Removed support for Tcl 8.4 and 8.5.

              [2]    Removed support for the argument types  <b>int*</b>,  <b>float*</b>,  <b>double*</b>,  <b>bytearray</b>,  <b>rawchar</b>,  and
                     <b>rawchar*</b>.

       [2]    Modified packages to accept operation under Tcl 9.  Bumped package versions appropriately.  Bumped
              copyrights.

              The  <u>How</u>  <u>To</u>  <u>Adapt</u>  <u>Critcl</u> <u>Packages</u> <u>for</u> <u>Tcl</u> <u>9</u> contains the details relevant to writers of <u>CriTcl</u>-
              based packages.

       [3]    Set different minimum Tcl requirements for the 8.x and 9.x series.

              If no minimum is declared the minimum depends on the Tcl version used to run the critcl package or
              application.

              When running under Tcl 9 the default minimum is version <b>9</b>.  For  anything  else  the  new  default
              minimum is <b>8.6</b>.

              <u>Reminder</u>: Support for Tcl 8.4 and 8.5 was removed.

       [4]    Made "<u>~</u>"-handling portable across the 8.x and 9 boundary (via <b>HOME</b> environment variable).

       [5]    Bumped embedded <b>tclconfig</b> to version 2.67. Patch supplied by Paul Obermeier.

       [6]    <u>Bug</u> <u>Fix</u> <u>#127</u> [https://github.com/andreas-kupries/critcl/issues/127]

       [7]    <u>Bug</u> <u>Fix</u> <u>#128</u> [https://github.com/andreas-kupries/critcl/issues/128]

       [8]    <u>Bug</u>  <u>Fix</u>  <u>#129</u>  [https://github.com/andreas-kupries/critcl/issues/129]  Fixed various typos in the
              documentation.

       [9]    Reworked internals of <b>critcl::cutil</b>'s tracer to support operation in a multi-threaded environment.
              This new mode is also default. The old single-threaded  mode  can  be  (re)activated  by  defining
              <b>CRITCL_TRACE_NOTHREADS</b>.

              Package bumped to version 0.4.

       [10]   Reworked  the installer to add <b>tclX</b> markers to the installation directories of the C-based support
              packages (<b>critcl::callback</b>, <b>critcl::md5c</b>), where <b>X</b> is the major version number of the <b>tclsh</b>  which
              ran critcl.

       [11]   In other words, one of <b>tcl8</b> or <b>tcl9</b>.

       [12]   Broke lingering dependencies on the Tcllib packages <b>cmdline</b> and <b>fileutil</b>.

              There are no circularities between Critcl and Tcllib any longer, simplifying installation.

</pre><h4><b>CHANGES</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>VERSION</b> <b>3.2</b></h4><pre>
       [1]    <u>BREAKING</u> <u>CriTcl</u> now requires Tcl 8.6 to be run.

              It also generates Tcl 8.6 extensions by default.

              It  is  still  possible  to  generates  extensions  for  Tcl  8.4 and 8.5, properly setting it via
              <b>critcl::tcl</b>.

              <u>ATTENTION</u> It is planned to completely remove 8.4 and 8.5 support with <u>CriTcl</u>  3.3.   No  date  has
              been set for that release yet.

              All utility packages have their versions and requirements bumped accordingly as well.

       [2]    <u>BREAKING</u> <u>Bug</u> <u>Fix</u> Issue <u>#115</u> [https://github.com/andreas-kupries/critcl/issues/115].

              Distributions  using  <b>build.tcl</b>  for  installation of critcl in their packaging scripts have to be
              updated to the changed command signature of <b>build.tcl</b> install, etc. See the details below.

              Redone the argument handling for <b>install</b>, <b>uninstall</b>, and  <b>targets</b>.  The  destination  argument  is
              gone.  All commands now take options similar to what is known from GNU <b>configure</b>, i.e.

              <b>--prefix</b> path

              <b>--exec-prefix</b> path

              <b>--bin-dir</b> path

              <b>--lib-dir</b> path

              <b>--include-dir</b> path

       They now also respect the environment variable <b>DESTDIR</b>, and the associated option <b>--dest-dir</b>.

       The  <b>--prefix</b>  defaults to the topdir from the bin directory holding the <b>tclsh</b> running <b>build.tcl</b>.  As Tcl
       command:

                  file dirname [file dirname [info nameofexecutable]]

       Added a command <b>dirs</b> doing the same argument handling, for debugging.

       [3]    Removed the irrelevant packages <b>autoscroll</b>, <b>cmdline</b>, <b>dict84</b>, <b>lassign84</b>, <b>lmap84</b>, <b>snit</b>,  <b>snitbutton</b>,
              and <b>wikit</b>.

       [4]    <u>Documentation</u>  <u>Redo</u>  Issue  <u>#116</u> [https://github.com/andreas-kupries/critcl/issues/116].  Reworked
              the documentation to use the system of 4 quadrants.  Reworked the introduction (How To Use Critcl)
              to be strongly based on a series of examples.

       [5]    <u>Bug</u> <u>Fix</u> Issue <u>#125</u> [https://github.com/andreas-kupries/critcl/issues/125].  Added  missing  method
              <b>create</b> in object creation example of installer documentation.

       [6]    <u>Feature</u>. Extended <b>cproc</b> argument type processing. Now able to auto-create restricted scalar types.
              I.e. types derived from <u>int</u>, etc. and limited in the range of allowed values.

              Further able to auto-create restricted list types, i.e. types derived from <u>list</u> and either limited
              in length, or in the type of the elements, or both.

       [7]    <u>Bug</u> <u>Fix</u> <u>/</u> <u>Enhancement</u> Issue <u>#118</u> [https://github.com/andreas-kupries/critcl/issues/118].  Modified
              <b>critcl::cproc</b>  to  accept  C syntax for arguments, i.e.  Trailing comma on argument names, leading
              comma on type names, and lone comma characters.

       [8]    <u>Performance</u>   <u>Fix</u>   for   <u>compile</u>   <u>&amp;</u>   <u>run</u>   mode.    Issue   <u>#112</u>   [https://github.com/andreas-
              kupries/critcl/issues/112].

              Moved  the  command  activating  more  precise  code  location tracking out of package <b>critcl</b> into
              package <b>critcl::app</b>.

              Because generating packages ahead of time can bear the performance penalty invoked by this  <u>global</u>
              setting.

              Arbitrary  libraries  and  applications using critcl dynamically (<u>compile</u> <u>&amp;</u> <u>run</u>) on the other hand
              likely cannot, and should not.

       [9]    <u>Fix</u> Issue <u>#109</u> [https://github.com/andreas-kupries/critcl/issues/109].  Ignore <b>clang</b> suffices when
              computing the target identifier from a configuration identifier.

       [10]   <u>Feature</u>. Bumped package <b>critcl::cutil</b> to version 0.2.1.  Simplified the  implementation  of  macro
              <b>ASSERT</b>  by  taking  the  underlying  <b>Tcl_Panic</b>'s printf ability into account and added a new macro
              <b>ASSERT_VA</b> exporting the same ability to the user.

</pre><h4><b>CHANGES</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>VERSION</b> <b>3.1.18.1</b></h4><pre>
       [1]    <u>Attention</u>: While the overall version (of the bundle) moves to 3.1.18.1 the  versions  of  packages
              <b>critcl</b> and <b>critcl::app</b> are <u>unchanged</u>.

       [2]    <u>Bugfix</u>  Generally  removed a number of 8.5-isms which slipped into 3.1.18, breaking ability to use
              it with Tcl 8.4.

       [3]    <u>Bugfix</u> Corrected broken <u>build.tcl</u> <u>uninstall</u>.

       [4]    <u>Bugfix</u> Package <b>critcl::class</b> bumped to version 1.1.1. Fixed partial template substitution breaking
              compilation of the generated code.

</pre><h4><b>CHANGES</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>VERSION</b> <b>3.1.18</b></h4><pre>
       [1]    Feature (Developer support). Merged  pull  request  #96  from  sebres/main-direct-invoke.  Enables
              direct  invokation of the "<u>main.tcl</u>" file for starkits from within a dev checkout, i.e. outside of
              a starkit, or starpack.

       [2]    Feature. Added channel types to the set of builtin argument and result types. The  argument  types
              are  for  simple  channel access, access requiring unshared channels, and taking the channel fully
              into the C level, away from Tcl. The result type comes in variants  for  newly  created  channels,
              known  channels,  and  to  return taken channels back to Tcl. The first will register the returned
              value in the interpreter, the second assumes that it already is.

       [3]    Bugfix. Issue #96. Reworked the documentation around the argument type  <b>Tcl_Interp*</b>  to  make  its
              special status more visible, explain uses, and call it out from result types where its use will be
              necessary or at least useful.

       [4]    Feature. Package <b>critcl::class</b> bumped to version 1.1.  Extended with the ability to create a C API
              for classes, and the ability to disable the generation of the Tcl API.

       [5]    Bugfix. Merged pull request #99 from pooryorick/master. Fixes to the target directory calculations
              done by the install code.

       [6]    Merged  pull  request #94 from andreas-kupries/documentation.  A larger documentation cleanup. The
              main work was done by pooryorick, followed by tweaks done by myself.

       [7]    Extended the test suite with lots of cases  based  on  the  examples  for  the  various  generator
              packages.  IOW  the  new  test  cases  replicate/encapsulate the examples and demonstrate that the
              packages used by the examples generate working code.

       [8]    Bugfix. Issue #95. Changed the field <b>critcl_bytes.s</b> to <b>unsigned</b> <b>char*</b> to match Tcl's type. Further
              constified the field to make clear that read-only usage is the common case for it.

       [9]    Bugfix/Feature. Package <b>critcl::cutil</b> bumped to version 0.2.  Fixed missing  inclusion  of  header
              "<u>string.h</u>"  in  "<u>critcl_alloc.h</u>",  needed  for <b>memcpy</b> in macro <b>STREP</b>.  Added macros <b>ALLOC_PLUS</b> and
              <b>STRDUP</b>.  Moved documentation of <b>STREP...</b> macros into proper place (alloc section, not assert).

       [10]   Merged pull request #83 from apnadkarni/vc-fixes.  Removed deprecated -Gs  for  MSVC  builds,  and
              other Windows fixups.

       [11]   Feature.  Package  <b>critcl::iassoc</b>  bumped  to  version  1.1.   Refactored internals to generate an
              include header for use by .c files.  This now matches  what  other  generator  packages  do.   The
              template file is inlined and removed.

       [12]   Merged  pull  request  #82  from gahr/home-symlink Modified tests to handle possibility of $HOME a
              symlink.

       [13]   Merged pull request #81 from gahr/test-not-installed Modified test  support  to  find  uninstalled
              critcl packages when running tests. Handles all but critcl::md5.

       [14]   Merged pull request #85 from snoe925/issue-84 to fix Issue #84 breaking installation on OSX.

       [15]   Merged pull request #87 from apnadkarni/tea-fixes to fix Issue #86, broken -tea option, generating
              an incomplete package.

       [16]   Feature.  New  package  <b>critcl::callback</b> providing C-level functions and data structures to manage
              callbacks from C to Tcl.

       [17]   Feature. Package <b>critcl::literals</b> bumped to version 1.3.  Added mode <b>+list</b> enabling the conversion
              of multiple literals into a list of their strings.

       [18]   Feature. Package <b>critcl::enum</b> bumped to version 1.1.  Added basic mode  handling,  supporting  <b>tcl</b>
              (default)  and  <b>+list</b>  (extension  enabling  the conversion of multiple enum values into a list of
              their strings).

       [19]   Feature. Package <b>critcl::emap</b> bumped to version 1.2.  Extended existing mode handling  with  <b>+list</b>
              extension enabling the conversion of multiple emap values into a list of their strings.

       [20]   Feature.  Extended  the  set of available types by applying a few range restrictions to the scalar
              types (<u>int</u>, <u>long</u>, <u>wideint</u>, <u>double</u>, <u>float</u>).

              Example: <u>int</u> <u>&gt;</u> <u>0</u> is now a viable type name.

              This is actually more limited than the description might let you believe.

              See the package reference for the details.

</pre><h4><b>CHANGES</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>VERSION</b> <b>3.1.17</b></h4><pre>
       [1]    Extension: Allow duplicate arg- and result-type definitions if they are fully identical.

       [2]    Bugfix. The application mishandled the possibility of identical-named  <b>critcl::tsource</b>s.  Possible
              because  <b>critcl::tsource</b>s  can  be  in  subdirectories,  a  structure which is <u>not</u> retained in the
              assembled package, causing such files to overwrite each other and at  least  one  lost.  Fixed  by
              adding a serial number to the file names in the assembled package.

       [3]    Bugfix  in  the  static scanner which made it loose requirement information. Further added code to
              generally cleanup results at the end (removal of duplicates, mainly).

       [4]    Bugfix: Fixed issue #76.  Support  installation  directories  which  are  not  in  the  <b>auto_path</b>.
              Without the patch the installed <b>critcl</b> will not find its own packages and fail. Thank you to <u>Simon</u>
              <u>Bachmann</u> [https://github.com/lupylucke] for the report and patch, and then his patience with me to
              getting to actually apply it.

       [5]    Bugfix: Fixed issue #75.  Extended <b>critcl::include</b> to now take multiple paths.

       [6]    Added new compatibility package <b>lmap84</b>.

       [7]    Fixed typos in various documentation files.

       [8]    Fixed  bug  introduced by commit 86f415dd30 (3.1.16 release). The separation of <b>critcl::ccode</b> into
              user and work layers means that location retrieval has to go one more level up to  find  the  user
              location.

       [9]    New  supporting  package  <b>critcl::cutil</b>.  Provides  common  C  level facilities useful to packages
              (assertions, tracing, memory allocation shorthands).

       [10]   Modified package <b>critcl</b> to make use of the new tracing facilities to provide tracing of  arguments
              and results for <b>critcl::ccommand</b> and <b>critcl::cproc</b> invokations.

       [11]   Modified  packages  <b>critcl</b>  and  <b>critcl::class</b> to provide better function names for (class) method
              tracing.  Bumped package <b>critcl::class</b> to version 1.0.7.

       [12]   Extended the support package <b>critcl::literals</b> with limited configurability.  It  is  now  able  to
              generate  code for C-level access to the pool without Tcl types (Mode <b>c</b>).  The previously existing
              functionality is accesssible under mode <b>tcl</b>, which also is the default. Both  modes  can  be  used
              together.

       [13]   Extended the support package <b>critcl::emap</b> with limited configurability. It is now able to generate
              code  for  C-level  access  to  the  mapping  without  Tcl types (Mode <b>c</b>). The previously existing
              functionality is accessible under mode <b>tcl</b>, which also is the default.  Both  modes  can  be  used
              together.

</pre><h4><b>CHANGES</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>VERSION</b> <b>3.1.16</b></h4><pre>
       [1]    New  feature. Extended <b>critcl::cproc</b>'s argument handling to allow arbitrary mixing of required and
              optional arguments.

       [2]    New feature.  <u>Potential</u> <u>Incompatibility</u>.

              Extended <b>critcl::cproc</b>'s argument handling to treat an argument <b>args</b> as variadic if it is the last
              argument of the procedure.

       [3]    New feature. Added two introspection  commands,  <b>critcl::has-argtype</b>  and  <b>critcl::has-resulttype</b>.
              These enable a user to test if a specific (named) type conversion is implemented or not.

       [4]    Added  new  result  type  <b>Tcl_Obj*0</b>,  with  alias  <b>object0</b>.  The  difference to <b>Tcl_Obj*</b> is in the
              reference counting.

       [5]    Extended the command <b>critcl::argtypesupport</b> with new optional argument through which to explicitly
              specify the identifier for guarding against multiple definitions.

       [6]    Bugfix: Fixed problem with the implementation  of  issue  #54  (See  3.1.14).  Always  create  the
              secondary  log  file.  Otherwise  end-of-log  handling  may  break,  unconditionally  assuming its
              existence.

       [7]    Bugfix: Fixed problem with the internal change to the  hook  <b>HandleDeclAfterBuild</b>.  Corrected  the
              forgotten <b>critcl::cconst</b>.

       [8]    Debugging aid: Added comment holding the name of the result type when emitting result conversions.

       [9]    Bugfix:  Fixed  issue  #60.  Unbundled  the  package directories containing multiple packages. All
              directories under "<u>lib/</u>" now contain exactly one package.

       [10]   Bugfix: Fixed issue #62, a few <b>dict</b> <b>exists</b> commands operating on  a  fixed  string  instead  of  a
              variable.

       [11]   Bugfix: Fixed issue #56. Release builders are reminded to run the tests.

       [12]   Bugfix:  Fixed  issue  #55.  For  FreeBSD  critcl's platform package now identifies the Kernel ABI
              version. Initialization of the cache directory now also uses <b>platform::identify</b>  for  the  default
              path, instead of <b>platform::generic</b>.

       [13]   Bugfix:  Fixed  issue  #58.  Simplified  the setup and use of md5. CriTcl now makes use of its own
              package for md5, using itself to built it. There is no chicken/egg problem with this as  the  <b>-pkg</b>
              mode used for this does not use md5. That is limited to mode <u>compile</u> <u>&amp;</u> <u>run</u>.

</pre><h4><b>CHANGES</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>VERSION</b> <b>3.1.15</b></h4><pre>
       [1]    Fixed version number bogosity with <b>3.1.14</b>.

</pre><h4><b>CHANGES</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>VERSION</b> <b>3.1.14</b></h4><pre>
       [1]    Fixed  issue #36. Added message to target <b>all</b> of the Makefile generated for TEA mode. Additionally
              tweaked other parts of the output to be less noisy.

       [2]    Accepted request implied in issue #54. Unconditionally save the compiler/linker build log into key
              <b>log</b> of the dictionary returned by <b>cresults</b>, and save a copy of only the execution  output  in  the
              new key <b>exl</b> ("execution log").

       [3]    Fixed  issue  #53.  Clarified  the  documentation of commands <b>critcl::load</b> and <b>critcl::failed</b> with
              regard to their results and the throwing of errors (does not happen).

       [4]    Fixed issue #48. Modified mode "compile &amp; run" to allow new declarations in a file, after  it  was
              build,  instead  of  erroring  out.  The  new  decls  are  build when needed. Mode "precompile" is
              unchanged and will continue to trap the situation.

       [5]    Fixed issue #52. Updated the local Tcl/Tk headers to 8.4.20, 8.5.13, and 8.6.4.

       [6]    Fixed issue #45. New feature command <b>critcl::cconst</b>.

       [7]    <b>critcl::util</b>: New command <b>locate</b> to find a file across a set of paths, and report  an  error  when
              not found. This is for use in autoconf-like header-searches and similar configuration tests.

       [8]    Modified  'AbortWhenCalledAfterBuild'  to dump the entire stack (info frame!). This should make it
              easier to determine the location of the troubling declaration.

       [1]    Merged PR #43. Fixed bug loading adjunct Tcl sources.

       [2]    Fixes in documentation and generated code of package "critcl::enum". Bumped to version 1.0.1.

       [3]    Fixes in documentation of package "critcl::bitmap".

       [4]    New package "critcl::emap". In essence a variant or cross of "critcl::bitmap" with behaviour  like
              "critcl::enum".

       [5]    Merged PR #49. Fixed documentation typo.

       [6]    Merged PR #46. Fixed documentation typo.

       [7]    Merged  PR  #47.  Fixes  to test results to match the accumulated code changes. Also made portable
              across Tcl versions (varying error syntax).

       [8]    New predefined argument- and result-type "wideint" mapping to Tcl_WideInt.

       [9]    New predefined argument-type "bytes" mapping to tuple of byte-array data  and  length.  Note:  The
              existing "bytearray" type (and its aliases) was left untouched, to keep backward compatibility.

       [10]   Modified  the  internal  interface  between the Tcl shim and C function underneath "critcl::cproc"
              with respect to the handling of optional arguments.  An optional argument "X" now induces the  use
              of two C arguments, "X" and "has_X".  The new argument "has_X" is of boolean (int) type. It is set
              to  true  when  X  is set, and set to false when X has the default value. C code which cares about
              knowing if the argument is default or not is now able to check that  quickly,  without  having  to
              code  the  default  value  inside.   NOTE:  This  change  is visible in the output of the advanced
              commands "argcnames", "argcsignature", "argvardecls", and "argconversion".

       [11]   Fixed issue #50 and documented the availability of variable  "interp"  (type  Tcl_Interp*)  within
              "critcl::cinit"  C  code  fragments.   Note that while the old, undocumented name of the variable,
              "ip", is still usable, it is deprecated. It will be  fully  removed  in  two  releases,  i.e.  for
              release 3.1.15.  The variable name was changed to be consistent with other code environments.

       [12]   Fixed  issue  #51. Disabled the generation of #line directives for "critcl::config lines 0" coming
              from template files, or code generated with them before the final value of this setting was known.

       [13]   Fixed issue with handling of namespaced package names in "critcl::iassoc". Equivalent to a bug  in
              "critcl::class"  fixed  for  critcl 3.1.1, critcl::class 1.0.1.  Note: "literals", "enum", "emap",
              and "bitmap" do not require a fix as they are all built on top of "iassoc".

</pre><h4><b>CHANGES</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>VERSION</b> <b>3.1.12</b></h4><pre>
       [1]    Fixed issue 42. Clear ::errorInfo immediately after  startup  to  prevent  leakage  of  irrelevant
              (caught) errors into our script and confusing the usage code.

       [2]    Fixed  issue  40.  Keep  the  order  of libraries, and allow duplicates. Both are things which are
              occasionally required for proper linking.

       [3]    Extended the utility package <b>critcl::literals</b> to declare a cproc result-type for a pool.

              Further fixed the generated header to handle multiple inclusion.

              Bumped version to 1.1.

       [4]    Fixed issue with utility package <b>critcl::bitmap</b>.

              Fixed the generated header to handle multiple inclusion.

              Bumped version to 1.0.1.

       [5]    Created new utility package <b>critcl::enum</b> for the quick and easy setup and use of mappings  between
              C values and Tcl strings.  Built on top of <b>critcl::literals</b>.

       [6]    Added examples demonstrating the use of the utility packages <b>critcl::literals</b>, <b>critcl::bitmap</b>, and
              <b>critcl::enum</b>

</pre><h4><b>CHANGES</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>VERSION</b> <b>3.1.11</b></h4><pre>
       [1]    Fixed  issue  #37,  via pull request #38, with thanks to Jos DeCoster. Information was stored into
              the v::delproc and v::clientdata arrays using a  different  key  than  when  retrieving  the  same
              information, thus failing the latter.

       [2]    New convenience command <b>critcl::include</b> for easy inclusion of headers and other C files.

       [3]    New  command  <b>critcl::make</b> to generate a local header of other C files for use by other parts of a
              package through inclusion.

       [4]    New utility package <b>critcl::literals</b> for quick and easy setup of and  access  to  pools  of  fixed
              Tcl_Obj* strings.  Built on top of <b>critcl::iassoc</b>.

       [5]    New  utility package <b>critcl::bitmap</b> for quick and easy setup and use of mappings between C bitsets
              and Tcl lists whose string elements represent that set.  Built on top of <b>critcl::iassoc</b>.

</pre><h4><b>CHANGES</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>VERSION</b> <b>3.1.10</b></h4><pre>
       [1]    Fixed code version numbering forgotten with 3.1.9.

       [2]    Fixed issue #35. In package mode (-pkg) the object cache directory is unique to the process,  thus
              we  do  not need content-hashing to generate unique file names. A simple counter is sufficient and
              much faster.

              Note that mode "compile &amp; run" is not as blessed and still uses content-hasing with md5 to  ensure
              unique file names in its per-user object cache.

       [3]    Fixed  issue  where  the  <b>ccommand</b>  forgot  to use its body as input for the UUID generation. Thus
              ignoring changes to it in mode compile &amp; run, and not rebuilding a library  for  changed  sources.
              Bug and fix reported by Peter Spjuth.

</pre><h4><b>CHANGES</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>VERSION</b> <b>3.1.9</b></h4><pre>
       [1]    Fixed issue #27. Added missing platform definitions for various alternate linux and OS X targets.

       [2]    Fixed issue #28. Added missing -mXX flags for linking at the linux-{32,64}-* targets.

       [3]    Fixed  issue  #29.  Replaced the use of raw "cheaders" information in the processing of "cdefines"
              with the proper include directives derived from it.

       [4]    Fixed the issue behind rejected pull request #30 by Andrew Shadura. Dynamically extract the  stubs
              variable declarations from the Tcl header files and generate matching variable definitions for use
              in  the package code. The generated code will now be always consistent with the headers, even when
              critcl's own copy of them is replaced by system headers.

       [5]    Fixed issue #31. Accepted patch by Andrew Shadura, with changes (comments), for easier integration
              of critcl with OS package systems, replacing critcl's copies of Tcl headers with their own.

       [6]    Fixed issue #32. Merged pull request by  Andrew  Shadura.   Various  typos  in  documentation  and
              comments.

       [7]    Fixed issue #34. Handle files starting with a dot better.

</pre><h4><b>CHANGES</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>VERSION</b> <b>3.1.8</b></h4><pre>
       [1]    Fixed  issue  with  package  indices  generated for Tcl 8.4.  Join the list of commands with semi-
              colon, not newline.

       [2]    Fixed issue #26 which brought up use-cases I had forgotten to consider while fixing bug  #21  (see
              critcl 3.1.6).

</pre><h4><b>CHANGES</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>VERSION</b> <b>3.1.7</b></h4><pre>
       [1]    Fixed  issue  #24.  Extract  and unconditionally display compiler warnings found in the build log.
              Prevents users from missing warnings which, while  not  causing  the  build  to  fail,  may  still
              indicate problems.

       [2]    New  feature.  Output  hook.  All  non-messaging  user  output  is  now routed through the command
              <b>critcl::print</b>, and users are allowed to override it when using the critcl application-as-package.

       [3]    New feature, by Ashok P. Nadkarni. Platform configurations can inherit values from  configurations
              defined before them.

</pre><h4><b>CHANGES</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>VERSION</b> <b>3.1.6</b></h4><pre>
       [1]    Fixed  issue  #21.  While the multi-definition of the stub-table pointer variables was ok with for
              all the C linkers seen so far C++ linkers did not like this at all. Reworked the  code  to  ensure
              that  this  set  of  variables  is  generated  only  once, in the wrapper around all the pieces to
              assemble.

       [2]    Fixed  issue  #22,  the  handling  of  the  command  identifier  arguments  of   <b>critcl::ccommand</b>,
              <b>critcl::cproc</b>,  and  <b>critcl::cdata</b>.  We  now properly allow any Tcl identifier and generate proper
              internal C identifiers from them.

              As part of this the signature of command <b>critcl::name2c</b> changed. The command now delivers  a  list
              of four values instead of three. The new value was added at the end.

              Further  adapted  the  implementation  of  package  <b>critcl::class</b>, a user of <b>critcl::name2c</b>.  This
              package is now at version 1.0.6 and requires critcl 3.1.6

              Lastly fixed the mis-handling of option <b>-cname</b> in <b>critcl::ccommand</b>, and <b>critcl::cproc</b>.

       [3]    Fixed issue #23.

</pre><h4><b>CHANGES</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>VERSION</b> <b>3.1.5</b></h4><pre>
       [1]    Fixed issue #19. Made the regular expression extracting the MSVC version number  more  general  to
              make  it  work  on german language systems. This may have to be revisited in the future, for other
              Windows locales.

       [2]    Fixed issue #20. Made option -tea work on windows, at least in a unix emulation  environment  like
              msys/mingw.

</pre><h4><b>CHANGES</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>VERSION</b> <b>3.1.4</b></h4><pre>
       [1]    Bugfix in package <b>critcl::class</b>. Generate a dummy field in the class structure if the class has no
              class  variables.  Without this change the structure would be empty, and a number of compilers are
              not able to handle such a type.

       [2]    Fixed a typo which broke the win64 configuration.

       [3]    Fixed issue #16, a typo in the documentation of command <b>critcl::class</b>.

</pre><h4><b>CHANGES</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>VERSION</b> <b>3.1.3</b></h4><pre>
       [1]    Enhancement. In detail:

       [2]    Added new argument type "pstring", for "Pascal String", a counted string, i.e.  a  combination  of
              string pointer and string length.

       [3]    Added  new  methods  <b>critcl::argtypesupport</b>  and <b>::critcl::argsupport</b> to define and use additional
              supporting code for an argument type, here  used  by  "pstring"  above  to  define  the  necessary
              structure.

       [4]    Semi-bugfixes  in  the  packages  <b>critcl::class</b>  and  <b>critcl::iassoc</b>. Pragmas for the AS meta data
              scanner to ensure that the template files are made part of the package.  Versions bumped to  1.0.4
              and 1.0.1 respectively.

</pre><h4><b>CHANGES</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>VERSION</b> <b>3.1.2</b></h4><pre>
       [1]    Enhancement. In detail:

       [2]    Extended  <b>critcl::cproc</b>  to  be  able  to  handle  optional  arguments,  in a limited way. This is
              automatically available to <b>critcl::class</b> cproc-based methods as well.

       [3]    Bugfix in <b>lassign</b> emulation for Tcl 8.4.  Properly set  unused  variables  to  the  empty  string.
              Bumped version of emulation package <b>lassign84</b> to 1.0.1.

</pre><h4><b>CHANGES</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>VERSION</b> <b>3.1.1</b></h4><pre>
       [1]    Bugfixes all around. In detail:

       [2]    Fixed the generation of wrong#args errors for <b>critcl::cproc</b> and derived code (<b>critcl::class</b> cproc-
              based methods). Use NULL if there are no arguments, and take the offset into account.

       [3]    Fixed  the  handling  of  package  names  by <b>critcl::class</b>. Forgot that they may contain namespace
              separators. Bumped to version 1.0.1.

       [4]    Extended a <b>critcl::class</b> generated error message in  instance  creation  for  clarity.  Bumped  to
              version 1.0.2.

</pre><h4><b>CHANGES</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>VERSION</b> <b>3.1</b></h4><pre>
       [1]    Added a new higher-level package <b>critcl::iassoc</b>.

              This  package  simplifies  the  creation  of  code  associating data with an interpreter via Tcl's
              <b>Tcl_(Get|Set)AssocData()</b> APIs. The user can concentrate  on  his  data  while  all  the  necessary
              boilerplate C code to support this is generated by the package.

              This  package  uses  several  of the new features which were added to the core <b>critcl</b> package, see
              below.

       [2]    Added the higher-level package <b>critcl::class</b>.

              This package simplifies the creation of C level objects with class and instance commands. The user
              can write a class definition with class- and instance-variables and -methods similar  to  a  TclOO
              class, with all the necessary boilerplate C code to support this generated by the package.

              This  package  uses  several  of the new features which were added to the core <b>critcl</b> package, see
              below.

       [3]    Extended the API for handling TEApot metadata. Added the command <b>critcl::meta?</b> to query the stored
              information. Main use currently envisioned is retrieval of the current package's name  by  utility
              commands, for use in constructed names. This particular information is always available due to the
              static scan of the package file on execution of the first critcl command.

              The new packages <b>critcl::iassoc</b> and <b>critcl::class</b> (see above) are users of this command.

       [4]    Extended  the  API  with  a command, <b>critcl::name2c</b>, exposing the process of converting a Tcl name
              into base name, namespace, and C namespace. This enables higher-level code generators to  generate
              the same type of C identifiers as <b>critcl</b> itself.

              The new package <b>critcl::class</b> (see above) is a user of this command.

       [5]    Extended  the  API  with  a command, <b>critcl::source</b>, executing critcl commands found in a separate
              file in the context of the current file. This enables easier management of larger bodies  of  code
              as  it  allows  the user to split such up into easier to digest smaller chunks without causing the
              generation of multiple packages.

       [6]    Related to the previous item, extended the API with commands to divert collection of  generated  C
              code  into  memory.  This  makes it easier to use the commands for embedded C code in higher-level
              code generators.

              See the section <b>Advanced:</b> <b>Diversions</b> for details of the provided commands.

              The new package <b>critcl::class</b> (see above) is a user of these facilities.

       [7]    Extended the API  with  commands  helping  developers  with  the  generation  of  proper  C  <u>#line</u>
              directives.  This allows higher-level code generators to generate and insert their own directives,
              ensuring that compile errors in their code are properly attributed.

              See the section <b>Advanced:</b> <b>Location</b> <b>management</b> for details of the provided commands.

              The new packages <b>critcl::iassoc</b> and <b>critcl::class</b> (see above) are users of these facilities.

       [8]    Extended the API with commands giving users the ability to define custom argument and result types
              for <b>::critcl::cproc</b>.

              See the section <b>CriTcl</b> <b>cproc</b> <b>Type</b> <b>Reference</b> for details of the provided commands.

</pre><h4><b>CHANGES</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>VERSION</b> <b>3.0.7</b></h4><pre>
       [1]    Fixed the code generated by <b>critcl::c++command</b>.  The emitted code handed a non-static string table
              to <b>Tcl_GetIndexFromObj</b>, in violation of the contract, which requires the table  to  have  a  fixed
              address.  This  was  a memory smash waiting to happen. Thanks to Brian Griffin for alrerting us to
              the general problem.

</pre><h4><b>CHANGES</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>VERSION</b> <b>3.0.6</b></h4><pre>
       [1]    Fixed github issue 10. The critcl application now  delivers  a  proper  exit  code  (1)  on  build
              failure, instead of always indicating success (status 0).

       [2]    Fixed  github  issue  13. Handling of bufferoverflowU.lib for release builds was inconsistent with
              handling for debug builds. It is now identically handled (conditional) by both cases.

       [3]    Documentation cleanup, mainly in the installation guide, and the README.md shown by github

</pre><h4><b>CHANGES</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>VERSION</b> <b>3.0.5</b></h4><pre>
       [1]    Fixed bug in the new code for #line pragmas triggered  when  specifying  C  code  without  leading
              whitespace.

       [2]    Extended  the  documentation  to  have  manpages for the license, source retrieval, installer, and
              developer's guides.

</pre><h4><b>CHANGES</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>VERSION</b> <b>3.0.4</b></h4><pre>
       [1]    Fixed generation of the package's initname when the incoming code is read from stdin  and  has  no
              proper path.

       [2]    Fixed  github  issue  11.  Now  using  /LIBPATH instead of -L on Windows (libinclude configuration
              setting).

       [3]    Extended critcl to handle -l:path format of -l options.  GNU ld 2.22+ handles  this  by  searching
              for  the path as is. Good when specifying static libraries, as plain -l looks for shared libraries
              in preference over static. critcl handles it now, as older GNU ld's do not understand it, nor  the
              various vendor-specific linkers.

       [4]    Fixed  github  issue  #12.  CriTcl now determines the version of MSVC in use and uses it to switch
              between various link debug options. Simplified the handling of  bufferoverflowU.lib  also,  making
              use of the same mechanism and collapsing the two configurations sections we had back into one.

       [5]    Reworked the insertion of #line pragmas into the generated C code to avoid limitations on the line
              number argument imposed by various compilers, and be more accurate.

       [6]    Modified argument processing. Option -libdir now also implies -L for its argument.

       [7]    Extended  handling of option -show (<b>critcl::showconfig</b>) to list the path of the configuration file
              the data is coming from. Good for debugging configuration processing.

       [8]    Extended the build script with targets to regenerate the embedded documentation, and diagrams, and
              to generate a release.

</pre><h4><b>CHANGES</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>VERSION</b> <b>3.0.3</b></h4><pre>
       [1]    Fixed github issues 5 and 8, for the example build.tcl scripts. Working around a missing  variable
              ::errorInfo.  It  should always be present, however there seem to be revisions of Tcl around which
              violate this assumption.

</pre><h4><b>CHANGES</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>VERSION</b> <b>3.0.2</b></h4><pre>
       [1]    Fixed issue in compile-and-run mode where commands put into the auto_index are not found by  Tcl's
              [unknown] command.

       [2]    Fixed  an  array  key  mismatch  breaking  usage of client data and delete function for procedure.
              Reported by Jos DeCoster, with patch.

       [3]    Implemented a command line option <b>-L</b>, an equivalent of option <b>-I</b>, just for library search paths.

       [4]    Fixed github issues 5 and 8. Working around a missing variable ::errorInfo. It  should  always  be

       [2]    Fixed  recording  of  Tcl version requirements. Keep package name and version together, unbreaking
              generated meta data and generated package load command.

       [3]    Fixed the build scripts: When installing, or wrapping for TEA, generate any missing directories

       [4]    Modified the build scripts to properly exit the application when the window of their GUI is closed
              through the (X) button.

       [5]    Removed an 8.5-ism (open wb) which had slipped into the main build script.

       [6]    Modified the example build scripts  to  separate  the  output  for  the  different  examples  (and
              packages) by adding empty lines.

       [7]    stack::c example bugfix: Include API declarations for use in the companion files.

       [8]    Extended the documentation: Noted the need for a working installation of a C compiler.

       [9]    Extended  the  Windows  target definitions and code to handle the manifest files used by modern MS
              development environments. Note that  this  code  handles  both  possibilities,  environment  using
              manifests, and (old(er)) environments without.

       [10]   Extended  the  Windows  64bit  target  definitions and code to auto-detect the need for the helper
              library "bufferoverflowU.lib" and reconfigure the compile  and  link  commands  appropriately.  We
              assume  that  the  library  must  be linked when present. This should be no harm if the library is
              present, yet not needed. Just superfluous. We search for the library in the paths specified by the
              environment variable LIB.

</pre><h4><b>CHANGES</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>VERSION</b> <b>3</b></h4><pre>
       [1]    The command <b>critcl::platform</b> was deprecated in version 2.1, superceded by  <b>critcl::targetplatform</b>,
              yet kept for compatibility. Now it has been removed.

       [2]    The  command <b>critcl::compiled</b> was kept with in version 2.1 with semantics in contradiction to its,
              for compatibility. This contradiction has been removed, changing  the  visible  semantics  of  the
              command to be in line with its name.

       [3]    The change to version 3 became necessary because of the two incompatible visible changes above.

       [4]    Extended  the  application  package  with  code handling a new option <b>-tea</b>. Specifying this option
              invokes a special mode where critcl generates a TEA package, i.e. wraps the input into a directory
              hierarchy and support files which provide it TEA-lookalike buildsystem.

              This new option, and <b>-pkg</b>, exclude each other. If both are specified the last  used  option  takes
              precedence.

              The generated package directory hierarchy is mostly self-contained, but not fully. It requires not
              only  a  working  installation  of  Tcl,  but  also  working installations of the packages <b>md5</b> and
              <b>cmdline</b>. Both of these are provided by the <b>Tcllib</b> bundle. Not required, but  recommended  to  have
              installed are any of the packages which can accelerate md5's operation, i.e. <b>cryptkit</b>, <b>tcllibc</b>, or
              <b>Trf</b>.

       [5]    Extended  the  critcl package with a new command <b>critcl::scan</b> taking the path to a "<u>.critcl</u>" file,
              statically scanning it, and returning license, version, a list of its  companion  files,  list  of
              imported  APIs,  and  list  of  developer-specified custom configuration options. This data is the
              foundation for the TEA wrapping described above.

              Note that this is a <u>static</u> scan. While the other build modes can (must) execute the "<u>.critcl</u>" file
              and make platform-specific decisions regarding the assembled C code, companion files, etc. the TEA
              wrap mode is not in a position to make platform-specific decisions.  It  has  to  wrap  everything
              which might conceivably be needed when actually building. Hence the static scan.  This has however
              its  own set of problems, namely the inability to figure out any dynamic construction of companion
              file paths, at least on its own. Thus:

       [6]    Extended the API used by critcl-based packages with the command <b>critcl::owns</b>. While  this  command
              is  ignored  by  the regular build modes the static scanner described above takes its arguments as
              the names of companion files which have to be wrapped into  the  TEA  package  and  could  not  be
              figured   by   the   scanner  otherwise,  like  because  of  dynamic  paths  to  <b>critcl::tsources</b>,
              <b>critcl::csources</b>, getting sourced directly, or simply being adjunct datafiles.

       [7]    Extended the API used by critcl-based packages with the command <b>critcl::api</b> for the management  of
              stubs tables, be it their use, and/or declaration and export.

              Please see section <u>Stubs</u> <u>Table</u> <u>Management</u> of the <b>critcl</b> package documentation for details.

       [8]    Extended  the  API  used  by  critcl-based  packages  with  the command <b>critcl::userconfig</b> for the
              management  of  developer-specified  custom  configuration  options,  be  it  their   use   and/or
              declaration.

              Please see section <u>Custom</u> <u>Build</u> <u>Configuration</u> of the <b>critcl</b> package documentation for details.

       [9]    Extended   the   API   used  by  critcl-based  packages  with  the  commands  <b>critcl::description</b>,
              <b>critcl::summary</b>, <b>critcl::subject</b>, <b>critcl::meta</b>, and <b>critcl::buildrequirement</b> for  the  declaration
              of TEApot meta data for/about the package.

              Please see section <u>Package</u> <u>Meta</u> <u>Data</u> of the <b>critcl</b> package documentation for details.

</pre><h4><b>CHANGES</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>VERSION</b> <b>2.1</b></h4><pre>
       [1]    Fixed  bug  where  <b>critcl::tsources</b>  interpreted relative paths as relative to the current working
              directory instead of relative to the "<u>.critcl</u>" file using the command, as all  other  commands  of
              this type do.

       [2]    Fixed  internals,  preventing  information  collected for multiple "<u>.critcl</u>" files to leak between
              them. Notably, <b>critcl::tk</b> is not a global configuration option anymore.

       [3]    Fixed the command <b>critcl::license</b> to be a null-operation in  mode  "compile  &amp;  run",  instead  of
              throwing an error.

       [4]    Fixed  the critcl application's interference with the "compile &amp; run" result cache in <b>-pkg</b> mode by
              having it use a wholly separate (and by default transient) directory for that mode.

       [5]    Fixed bug where changes to a "<u>.critcl</u>" file did not result in a rebuild for mode "compile &amp;  run".
              All relevant API commands now ensure UUID changes.

       [6]    Fixed  bug  in  the backend handling of <b>critcl::debug</b> where the companion c-sources of a "<u>.critcl</u>"
              file were not compiled with debug options, although the "<u>.critcl</u>" file was.

       [7]    Fixed bug in <b>critcl::debug</b> which prevented recognition of mode "all" when it  was  not  the  first
              argument to the command.

       [8]    Fixed bug in "<u>preload.c</u>" preventing its compilation on non-windows platforms.

       [9]    Fixed  long-standing  bug  in the handling of namespace qualifiers in the command name argument of
              <b>critcl::cproc</b> and <b>critcl::ccommand</b>. It is now possible to specify a fully qualified  command  name
              without issues.

       [10]   Extended/reworked  <b>critcl::tsources</b>  to  be  the canonical way of declaring "<u>.tcl</u>" companion files
              even for mode "compile &amp; run".

       [11]   Extended/reworked <b>critcl::tsources</b> to allow the use of a "<u>.critcl</u>" file as its own  Tcl  companion
              file.

       [12]   Extended  <b>critcl::framework</b>  to  internally  check  for  OS  X  build  target,  and  to ignore the
              declaration if its not.

       [13]   Extended <b>critcl::failed</b> to be callable more than once in a "<u>.critcl</u>" file. The first  call  forces
              the  build,  if it was not done already, to get the result. Further calls return the cached result
              of the first call.

       [14]   Extended the handling of environment variable CC in the code determining the compiler  to  use  to
              deal  with  (i.e.  remove)  paths  to the compiler, compiler file extensions, and compiler options
              specified after the compiler itself, leaving only the bare name of the compiler.

       [15]   Extended the code handling the search for preloaded libraries to  print  the  paths  it  searched,
              making debugging of a search failure easier.

       [16]   A  new command <b>critcl::tcl</b> can be used to declare the version of Tcl minimally needed to build and
              run the "<u>.critcl</u>" file and package. Defaults to 8.4 if not declared. Extended critcl to  have  the
              stubs and headers for all of Tcl 8.4, 8.5, and 8.6.

       [17]   A new command <b>critcl::load</b> forces the build and load of a "<u>.critcl</u>" file. This is the official way
              for overriding critcl's default lazy-build-&amp;-load-on-demand scheme for mode "compile &amp; run".

              <u>Note</u>  that after using <b>critcl::load</b> / <b>critcl::failed</b> in a "<u>.critcl</u>" file it is not possible to use
              critcl commands in that file anymore. Doing so will throw an error.

       [18]   Extended the generation of '#line' pragmas to use <b>info</b> <b>frame</b>  (if  available)  to  provide  the  C
              compiler with exact line numbers into the "<u>.critcl</u>" file for the reporting of warnings and errors.

       [19]   Extended  <b>critcl::check</b>  with logging to help with debugging build-time checks of the environment,
              plus an additional optional argument to provide labeling.

       [20]   Added a new command <b>critcl::checklink</b> which not only tries to check the environment via  compiling
              the code, but also its linkability.

       [21]   Added  a new command <b>critcl::msg</b> for messaging, like command <b>critcl::error</b> is for error reporting.
              Likewise this is a hook a user of the package is allowed to override. The default  implementation,
              used  by  mode <u>compile</u> <u>&amp;</u> <u>run</u> does nothing. The implementation for mode <u>generate</u> <u>package</u> prints the
              message to stdout.

              Envisioned use is for the reporting of results determined by <b>critcl::check</b>  and  <b>critcl::checklink</b>
              during building, to help with debugging when something goes wrong with a check.

       [22]   Exposed  the  argument  processing  internals  of  <b>critcl::proc</b> for use by advanced users. The new
              commands are

              [1]    <b>critcl::argnames</b>

              [2]    <b>critcl::argcnames</b>

              [3]    <b>critcl::argcsignature</b>

              [4]    <b>critcl::argvardecls</b>

              [5]    <b>critcl::argconversion</b>

              Please see section <u>Advanced</u> <u>Embedded</u> <u>C</u> <u>Code</u> of the <b>critcl</b> package documentation for details.

       [23]   Extended the critcl package to intercept <b>package</b> <b>provide</b> and  record  the  file  -&gt;  package  name
              mapping.  Plus  other  internal  changes now allow the use of namespaced package names while still
              using proper path names and init function.

       [24]   Dropped the unused commands <b>critcl::optimize</b> and <b>critcl::include</b>.

       [25]   Dropped <b>-lib</b> mode from the critcl application.

       [26]   Dropped remnants of support for Tcl 8.3 and before.
