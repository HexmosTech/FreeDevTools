       Tcl - Tool Command Language

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       Summary of Tcl language syntax.
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The following rules define the syntax and semantics of the Tcl language:

       [1] <b>Commands.</b>
              A  Tcl  script  is a string containing one or more commands.  Semi-colons and newlines are command
              separators unless quoted as described  below.   Close  brackets  are  command  terminators  during
              command substitution (see below) unless quoted.

       [2] <b>Evaluation.</b>
              A command is evaluated in two steps.  First, the Tcl interpreter breaks the command into <u>words</u> and
              performs  substitutions as described below.  These substitutions are performed in the same way for
              all commands.  Secondly, the first word is used to locate a routine to carry out the command,  and
              the  remaining  words of the command are passed to that routine.  The routine is free to interpret
              each of its words in any way it likes, such as an integer, variable name,  list,  or  Tcl  script.
              Different commands interpret their words differently.

       [3] <b>Words.</b>
              Words  of  a  command  are  separated  by  white  space  (except  for  newlines, which are command
              separators).

       [4] <b>Double</b> <b>quotes.</b>
              If the first character of a word is double-quote (“"”) then the word is  terminated  by  the  next
              double-quote  character.   If  semi-colons,  close  brackets, or white space characters (including
              newlines) appear between the quotes then they are treated as ordinary characters and  included  in
              the  word.   Command substitution, variable substitution, and backslash substitution are performed
              on the characters between the quotes as described below.  The double-quotes are  not  retained  as
              part of the word.

       [5] <b>Argument</b> <b>expansion.</b>
              If  a  word  starts with the string “{*}” followed by a non-whitespace character, then the leading
              “{*}” is removed and the rest of the word is parsed and  substituted  as  any  other  word.  After
              substitution,  the  word is parsed as a list (without command or variable substitutions; backslash
              substitutions are performed as is  normal  for  a  list  and  individual  internal  words  may  be
              surrounded  by  either  braces or double-quote characters), and its words are added to the command
              being substituted. For instance, “cmd a {*}{b [c]} d {*}{$e f {g h}}” is equivalent to  “cmd  a  b
              {[c]} d {$e} f {g h}”.

       [6] <b>Braces.</b>
              If the first character of a word is an open brace (“{”) and rule [5] does not apply, then the word
              is terminated by the matching close brace (“}”).  Braces nest within the word: for each additional
              open  brace  there  must  be  an  additional close brace (however, if an open brace or close brace
              within the word is quoted with a backslash then it is not counted in locating the  matching  close
              brace).  No substitutions are performed on the characters between the braces except for backslash-
              newline  substitutions  described  below,  nor  do semi-colons, newlines, close brackets, or white
              space receive any special interpretation.  The word will consist of exactly the characters between
              the outer braces, not including the braces themselves.

       [7] <b>Command</b> <b>substitution.</b>
              If a word contains an open bracket (“[”) then Tcl performs <u>command</u> <u>substitution</u>.  To  do  this  it
              invokes  the Tcl interpreter recursively to process the characters following the open bracket as a
              Tcl script.  The script may contain any number of commands and  must  be  terminated  by  a  close
              bracket (“]”).  The result of the script (i.e. the result of its last command) is substituted into
              the word in place of the brackets and all of the characters between them.  There may be any number
              of  command  substitutions  in  a  single  word.   Command  substitution is not performed on words
              enclosed in braces.

       [8] <b>Variable</b> <b>substitution.</b>
              If a word contains a dollar-sign (“$”) followed by one of the  forms  described  below,  then  Tcl
              performs  <u>variable</u> <u>substitution</u>:  the dollar-sign and the following characters are replaced in the
              word by the value of a variable.  Variable substitution may take any of the following forms:

              <b>$</b><u>name</u>          <u>Name</u> is the name of a scalar variable;  the name is  a  sequence  of  one  or  more
                             characters  that  are  a letter, digit, underscore, or namespace separators (two or
                             more colons).  Letters and digits are <u>only</u> the standard ASCII ones  (<b>0</b>–<b>9</b>,  <b>A</b>–<b>Z</b>  and
                             <b>a</b>–<b>z</b>).

              <b>$</b><u>name</u><b>(</b><u>index</u><b>)</b>   <u>Name</u>  gives  the  name  of an array variable and <u>index</u> gives the name of an element
                             within that array.  <u>Name</u>  must  contain  only  letters,  digits,  underscores,  and
                             namespace  separators, and may be an empty string.  Letters and digits are <u>only</u> the
                             standard  ASCII  ones  (<b>0</b>–<b>9</b>,  <b>A</b>–<b>Z</b>  and  <b>a</b>–<b>z</b>).   Command   substitutions,   variable
                             substitutions,  and  backslash  substitutions  are  performed  on the characters of
                             <u>index</u>.

              <b>${</b><u>name</u><b>}</b>        <u>Name</u> is the name of a scalar  variable  or  array  element.   It  may  contain  any
                             characters  whatsoever  except  for close braces.  It indicates an array element if
                             <u>name</u> is in the form “<u>arrayName</u><b>(</b><u>index</u><b>)</b>” where <u>arrayName</u> does not  contain  any  open
                             parenthesis  characters,  “<b>(</b>”, or close brace characters, “<b>}</b>”, and <u>index</u> can be any
                             sequence of characters except for close brace characters.  No further substitutions
                             are performed during the parsing of <u>name</u>.

              There may be any number of variable substitutions in a single word.  Variable substitution is  not
              performed on words enclosed in braces.

              Note  that  variables  may  contain character sequences other than those listed above, but in that
              case other mechanisms must be used to access them (e.g., via  the  <b>set</b>  command's  single-argument
              form).

       [9] <b>Backslash</b> <b>substitution.</b>
              If  a  backslash (“\”) appears within a word then <u>backslash</u> <u>substitution</u> occurs.  In all cases but
              those described below the backslash is dropped and  the  following  character  is  treated  as  an
              ordinary  character and included in the word.  This allows characters such as double quotes, close
              brackets, and dollar signs to be included in words without  triggering  special  processing.   The
              following  table  lists  the  backslash sequences that are handled specially, along with the value
              that replaces each sequence.

                            \<b>a</b>     Audible alert (bell) (Unicode U+000007).

                            \<b>b</b>     Backspace (Unicode U+000008).

                            \<b>f</b>     Form feed (Unicode U+00000C).

                            \<b>n</b>     Newline (Unicode U+00000A).

                            \<b>r</b>     Carriage-return (Unicode U+00000D).

                            \<b>t</b>     Tab (Unicode U+000009).

                            \<b>v</b>     Vertical tab (Unicode U+00000B).

                            \<b>&lt;newline&gt;</b><u>whiteSpace</u>
                                   A single space character replaces the backslash, newline, and all spaces  and
                                   tabs  after  the  newline.   This  backslash sequence is unique in that it is
                                   replaced in a separate pre-pass before the command is actually parsed.   This
                                   means  that  it  will be replaced even when it occurs between braces, and the
                                   resulting space will be treated as a word separator if it is not in braces or
                                   quotes.

                            \\     Backslash (“\”).

                            \<u>ooo</u>   The digits <u>ooo</u> (one, two, or three of them) give a eight-bit octal value  for
                                   the  Unicode character that will be inserted, in the range <u>000</u>–<u>377</u> (i.e., the
                                   range U+000000–U+0000FF).  The  parser  will  stop  just  before  this  range
                                   overflows, or when the maximum of three digits is reached.  The upper bits of
                                   the Unicode character will be 0.

                            \<b>x</b><u>hh</u>   The  hexadecimal digits <u>hh</u> (one or two of them) give an eight-bit hexadecimal
                                   value for the Unicode character that will be inserted.  The upper bits of the
                                   Unicode character will be 0  (i.e.,  the  character  will  be  in  the  range
                                   U+000000–U+0000FF).

                            \<b>u</b><u>hhhh</u> The  hexadecimal  digits  <u>hhhh</u>  (one,  two,  three,  or  four of them) give a
                                   sixteen-bit  hexadecimal  value  for  the  Unicode  character  that  will  be
                                   inserted.   The  upper  bits  of  the  Unicode character will be 0 (i.e., the
                                   character will be in the range U+000000–U+00FFFF).

                            \<b>U</b><u>hhhhhhhh</u>
                                   The hexadecimal digits <u>hhhhhhhh</u> (one up to eight of them) give a  twenty-one-
                                   bit hexadecimal value for the Unicode character that will be inserted, in the
                                   range  U+000000–U+10FFFF.   The  parser  will  stop  just  before  this range
                                   overflows, or when the maximum of eight digits is reached.  The upper bits of
                                   the Unicode character will be 0.

              Backslash substitution is not performed on words enclosed in braces, except for  backslash-newline
              as described above.

       [10] <b>Comments.</b>
              If  a  hash  character  (“#”) appears at a point where Tcl is expecting the first character of the
              first word of a command, then the hash character and the characters that follow it, up through the
              next newline, are treated as a comment and ignored.  The comment character only  has  significance
              when it appears at the beginning of a command.

       [11] <b>Order</b> <b>of</b> <b>substitution.</b>
              Each character is processed exactly once by the Tcl interpreter as part of creating the words of a
              command.  For example, if variable substitution occurs then no further substitutions are performed
              on  the  value  of  the  variable;   the  value  is  inserted  into the word verbatim.  If command
              substitution occurs then the nested command is processed entirely by the recursive call to the Tcl
              interpreter; no substitutions are performed before making the recursive  call  and  no  additional
              substitutions are performed on the result of the nested script.

              Substitutions  take place from left to right, and each substitution is evaluated completely before
              attempting to evaluate the next.  Thus, a sequence like

                     set y [set x 0][incr x][incr x]

              will always set the variable <u>y</u> to the value, <u>012</u>.

       [12] <b>Substitution</b> <b>and</b> <b>word</b> <b>boundaries.</b>
              Substitutions do not affect the word boundaries of a command, except  for  argument  expansion  as
              specified in rule [5].  For example, during variable substitution the entire value of the variable
              becomes part of a single word, even if the variable's value contains spaces.
