       try - try - Trap and process errors and exceptions

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       package require <b>Tcl</b> <b>8.5</b> <b>9</b>

       package require <b>try</b> <b>?1.1?</b>

       <b>::try</b> <u>body</u> ?<u>handler...</u>? ?<b>finally</b> <u>script</u>?

________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  package provides a forward-compatibility implementation of Tcl 8.6's <b>try</b>/<b>finally</b> command (TIP 329),
       for Tcl 8.5. The code was directly pulled from Tcl 8.6 revision ?, when try/finally  was  implemented  as
       Tcl procedure instead of in C.

       <b>::try</b> <u>body</u> ?<u>handler...</u>? ?<b>finally</b> <u>script</u>?
              This command executes the script <u>body</u> and, depending on what the outcome of that script is (normal
              exit,  error, or some other exceptional result), runs a handler script to deal with the case. Once
              that has all happened, if the <b>finally</b> clause is present, the <u>script</u> it includes will  be  run  and
              the result of the handler (or the <u>body</u> if no handler matched) is allowed to continue to propagate.
              Note  that  the  <b>finally</b> clause is processed even if an error occurs and irrespective of which, if
              any, <u>handler</u> is used.

              The <u>handler</u> clauses are each expressed as several words, and must have one of the following forms:

              <b>on</b> <u>code</u> <u>variableList</u> <u>script</u>
                     This clause matches if the evaluation of <u>body</u> completed with the exception code  <u>code</u>.  The
                     <u>code</u>  may  be  expressed  as  an  integer or one of the following literal words: <b>ok</b>, <b>error</b>,
                     <b>return</b>, <b>break</b>, or  <b>continue</b>.  Those  literals  correspond  to  the  integers  0  through  4
                     respectively.

              <b>trap</b> <u>pattern</u> <u>variableList</u> <u>script</u>
                     This  clause  matches  if the evaluation of <u>body</u> resulted in an error and the prefix of the
                     <b>-errorcode</b> from the interpreter's status dictionary is equal to the <u>pattern</u>. The number  of
                     prefix  words  taken from the <b>-errorcode</b> is equal to the list-length of <u>pattern</u>, and inter-
                     word spaces are normalized in both the <b>-errorcode</b> and <u>pattern</u> before comparison.

                     The <u>variableList</u> word in each <u>handler</u> is always interpreted as a list of variable names. If
                     the first word of the list is present and non-empty, it names a  variable  into  which  the
                     result  of the evaluation of <u>body</u> (from the main <b>try</b>) will be placed; this will contain the
                     human-readable form of any errors. If the second word of the list is present and non-empty,
                     it names a variable into which the options dictionary of the interpreter at the  moment  of
                     completion of execution of <u>body</u> will be placed.

                     The  <u>script</u>  word  of  each <u>handler</u> is also always interpreted the same: as a Tcl script to
                     evaluate if the clause is matched. If <u>script</u> is a literal <b>-</b> and the <u>handler</u> is not the last
                     one, the <u>script</u> of the following <u>handler</u> is invoked instead  (just  like  with  the  <b>switch</b>
                     command).

                     Note  that <u>handler</u> clauses are matched against in order, and that the first matching one is
                     always selected.  At most one <u>handler</u> clause will selected.  As a consequence, an <b>on</b>  <b>error</b>
                     will mask any subsequent <b>trap</b> in the <b>try</b>. Also note that <b>on</b> <b>error</b> is equivalent to <b>trap</b> <b>{}</b>.

                     If an exception (i.e. any non-<b>ok</b> result) occurs during the evaluation of either the <u>handler</u>
                     or  the <b>finally</b> clause, the original exception's status dictionary will be added to the new
                     exception's status dictionary under the <b>-during</b> key.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Ensure that a file is closed no matter what:

              set f [open /some/file/name a]
              <b>try</b> {
                  puts \$f "some message"
                  # ...
              } <b>finally</b> {
                  close \$f
              }

       Handle different reasons for a file to not be openable for reading:

              <b>try</b> {
                  set f [open /some/file/name]
              } <b>trap</b> {POSIX EISDIR} {} {
                  puts "failed to open /some/file/name: it's a directory"
              } <b>trap</b> {POSIX ENOENT} {} {
                  puts "failed to open /some/file/name: it doesn't exist"
              }

       report  such  in  the category <u>try</u> of the <u>Tcllib</u> <u>Trackers</u> [<a href="http://core.tcl.tk/tcllib/reportlist">http://core.tcl.tk/tcllib/reportlist</a>].  Please
       also report any ideas for enhancements you may have for either package and/or documentation.

       When proposing code changes, please provide <u>unified</u> <u>diffs</u>, i.e the output of <b>diff</b> <b>-u</b>.

       Note further that <u>attachments</u> are strongly preferred over inlined patches. Attachments  can  be  made  by
