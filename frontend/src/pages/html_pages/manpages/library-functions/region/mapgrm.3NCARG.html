</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       MAPGRM - Draws lines of latitude and longitude masked against an existing area map.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       CALL MAPGRM (IAMA,XCRA,YCRA,MCRA,IAAI,IAGI,MNOG,ULPR)

</pre><h4><b>C-BINDING</b> <b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;ncarg/ncargC.h&gt;

       void c_mapgrm (int *iama, float *xcra, float *ycra,
       int mcra, int *iaai, int *iagi, int mnog,
       int (*ulpr)(float *xcra, float *ycra, int *ncs,
       int *iaai, int *iagi, int *nai))

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       IAMA        (an  input/output  array,  dimensioned as specified in a call to the AREAS routine ARINAM, of
                   type INTEGER) is the array containing the area  map  against  which  lines  of  latitude  and
                   longitude  are  to be masked. The area map must have been initialized by a call to ARINAM; it
                   may contain edges added to it by calling  MAPBLA,  as  is  the  case  in  the  example  named
                   "eezmpa", or it may contain a different set of edges to create some other desired effect. For
                   example,  an  area  map might be created that defines a region of interest, within which user
                   data is available and within which lines of latitude and longitude are to be drawn. For  more
                   details, see the reference document for the package named AREAS.

       XCRA and YCRA
                   (scratch  arrays,  dimensioned at least MCRA, of type REAL) are to be used by MAPGRM in calls
                   to the AREAS routine ARDRLN; they will eventually be used in calls to the user-provided line-
                   processing routine ULPR.

       MCRA        (an input expression of type INTEGER) is the dimension of the arrays XCRA and YCRA.

       IAAI and IAGI
                   (scratch arrays, dimensioned at least NOGI, of type INTEGER) are to  be  used  by  MAPGRM  in
                   calls to the AREAS routine ARDRLN; they will eventually be used in calls to the user-provided
                   line-processing routine ULPR. The mnemonics stand for "Integer Array of Area Identifiers" and
                   "Integer Array of Group Identifiers", respectively.

       NOGI        (an  input  expression  of  type  INTEGER)  is the dimension of the arrays IAAI and IAGI. The
                   mnemonic stands for "Number  Of  Group  Identifiers  (of  edges  in  the  area  map)",  which
                   determines the required dimension of IAAI and IAGI.

       ULPR        is the name of the user-supplied line-processing routine. It must be declared EXTERNAL in the
                   routine that calls MAPGRM, so that the compiler and loader will know that it is the name of a
                   routine  to  be  called  instead of a variable. The user routine ULPR will be called once for
                   each piece of a latitude/longitude line resulting from the masking process; it may decide  to
                   draw (or to not draw) each such piece. ULPR will be called using a FORTRAN statement like

                        CALL ULPR (XCRA,YCRA,NCRA,IAAI,IAGI,NGPS)

                   where  XCRA and YCRA are real arrays holding the normalized device coordinates of NCRA points
                   defining a polyline which is part of some latitude/longitude  line  and  IAAI  and  IAGI  are
                   integer  arrays holding NGPS area-identifier/group-identifier pairs for the area within which
                   that piece of the line lies. In writing ULPR, the user may rely upon a SET call's having been
                   done which makes it possible to use normalized device coordinates in calls to  routines  like
                   CURVE,  CURVED,  GPL, etc. For more details, see the reference document for the package named
                   AREAS and, in particular, the description of the subroutine ARDRLN.

</pre><h4><b>C-BINDING</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The C-binding argument descriptions are the same as the FORTRAN argument descriptions.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       The statement

            CALL MAPGRM (IAMA,XCRA,YCRA,MCRA,IAAI,IAGI,MNOG,ULPR)

       does the same thing as the statement

            CALL MAPGRD

       except that the grid lines are drawn using calls to MAPITM and MAPIQM, which  does  the  masking  of  the
       lines  against the area map defined by the arguments in the call and passes the pieces resulting from the
       masking process to a user-provided line-drawing routine.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Use the ncargex command to see the following relevant examples: ccppole, cmpfil, cmpgrp, cmpitm,  cmplab,
       cmpmsk, cmptit, cpex08, eezmpa, tezmpa, fcover, ffex03, ffex05.

</pre><h4><b>ACCESS</b></h4><pre>
       To  use MAPGRM or c_mapgrm, load the NCAR Graphics libraries ncarg, ncarg_gks, and ncarg_c, preferably in
       that order.
