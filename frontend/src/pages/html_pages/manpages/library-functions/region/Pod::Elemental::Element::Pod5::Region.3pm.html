</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Pod::Elemental::Element::Pod5::Region - a region of Pod (this role likely to be removed)

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 0.103006

</pre><h4><b>OVERVIEW</b></h4><pre>
       A Pod5::Region element represents a region marked by a "=for" command or a pair of "=begin" and "=end"
       commands.  It may have content of its own as well as child paragraphs.

       Its "as_pod_string" method will emit either a "=begin/=end"-enclosed string or a "=for" command, based on
       whichever is permissible.

</pre><h4><b>PERL</b> <b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This library should run on perls released even a long time ago.  It should work on any version of perl
       released in the last five years.

       Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made that the minimum required version
       will not be increased.  The version may be increased for any reason, and there is no promise that patches
       will be accepted to lower the minimum required perl.

</pre><h4><b>ATTRIBUTES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>format_name</b>
       This is the format to which the region was targeted.

       <b>Note!</b>  The format name should <u>not</u> include the leading colon to indicate a pod paragraph.  For that, see
       "is_pod".

   <b>is_pod</b>
       If true, this region contains pod (ordinary or verbatim) paragraphs, as opposed to data paragraphs.  This
       will generally result from the document originating in a "=begin" block with a colon-prefixed target
       identifier:

         =begin :html

           This is still a verbatim paragraph.

         =end :html

</pre><h4><b>WARNING</b></h4><pre>
       This class is somewhat sketchy and may be refactored somewhat in the future, specifically to refactor its
       similarities to Pod::Elemental::Element::Nested.
