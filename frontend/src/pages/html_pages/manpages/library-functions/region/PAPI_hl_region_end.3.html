</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       PAPI_hl_region_end - Read performance events at the end of a region and store the difference to the
       corresponding beginning of the region.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
</pre><h4><b>Detailed</b> <b>Description</b></h4><pre>
       <b>C</b> <b>Interface:</b>
           #include &lt;<b>papi.h</b>&gt;
           int <b>PAPI_hl_region_end(</b> <b>const</b> <b>char*</b> <b>region</b> <b>)</b>;

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>region</u> -- a unique region name corresponding to <b>PAPI_hl_region_begin</b>

       <b>Return</b> <b>values</b>
           <u>PAPI_OK</u>
           <u>PAPI_ENOTRUN</u> -- EventSet is currently not running or could not determined.
           <u>PAPI_ESYS</u> -- A system or C library call failed inside PAPI, see the errno variable.
           <u>PAPI_EMISC</u> -- PAPI has been deactivated due to previous errors.
           <u>PAPI_ENOMEM</u> -- Insufficient memory.

       <b>PAPI_hl_region_end</b> reads performance events at the end of a region and stores the difference to the
       corresponding beginning of the region.

       Assumes that <b>PAPI_hl_region_begin</b> was called before.

       Note that <b>PAPI_hl_region_end</b> does not stop counting the performance events. Counting continues until the
       application terminates. Therefore, the programmer can also create nested regions if required. To stop a
       running high-level event set, the programmer must call <b>PAPI_hl_stop()</b>. It should also be noted, that a
       marked region is thread-local and therefore has to be in the same thread.

       An output of the measured events is created automatically after the application exits. In the case of a
       serial, or a thread-parallel application there is only one output file. MPI applications would be saved
       in multiple files, one per MPI rank. The output is generated in the current directory by default.
       However, it is recommended to specify an output directory for larger measurements, especially for MPI
       applications via the environment variable PAPI_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY. In the case where measurements are
       performed, while there are old measurements in the same directory, PAPI will not overwrite or delete the
       old measurement directories. Instead, timestamps are added to the old directories.

       For more convenience, the output can also be printed to stdout by setting PAPI_REPORT=1. This is not
       recommended for MPI applications as each MPI rank tries to print the output concurrently.

       The generated measurement output can also be converted in a better readable output. The python script
       papi_hl_output_writer.py enhances the output by creating some derived metrics, like IPC, MFlops/s, and
       MFlips/s as well as real and processor time in case the corresponding PAPI events have been recorded. The
       python script can also summarize performance events over all threads and MPI ranks when using the option
       'accumulate' as seen below.

       <b>Example:</b>

       int retval;

       retval = PAPI_hl_region_begin("computation");
       if ( retval != PAPI_OK )
           <a href="../man1/handle_error.1.html">handle_error</a>(1);

        //Do some computation here

       retval = PAPI_hl_region_end("computation");
       if ( retval != PAPI_OK )
           <a href="../man1/handle_error.1.html">handle_error</a>(1);

       python papi_hl_output_writer.py --type=accumulate

       {
          "computation": {
             "Region count": 1,
             "Real time in s": 0.97 ,
             "CPU time in s": 0.98 ,
             "IPC": 1.41 ,
             "MFLIPS /s": 386.28 ,
             "MFLOPS /s": 386.28 ,
             "Number of ranks ": 1,
             "Number of threads ": 1,
             "Number of processes ": 1
          }
       }
