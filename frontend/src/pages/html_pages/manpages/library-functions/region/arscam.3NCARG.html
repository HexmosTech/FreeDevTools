</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       ARSCAM - Scans an area map from left to right, extracting the definitions of all the areas defined by the
       area map and delivering them to a user-defined subroutine for processing.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       CALL ARSCAM (MAP,XCS,YCS,MCS,IAI,IAG,MAI,APR)

</pre><h4><b>C-BINDING</b> <b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;ncarg/ncargC.h&gt;

       void c_arscam (int *map, float *xcs, float *ycs, int mcs, int *iai, int *iag, int mai, int (*apr)(float
       *xcs, float *ycs, int *ncs, int *iai, int *iag, int *nai))

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       MAP         (an  input/output  array  of  type  INTEGER)  - An array containing an area map that has been
                   initialized by a call to ARINAM and to which edges have been added by calls  to  AREDAM.   If
                   you  did not preprocess the area map by calling ARPRAM, ARSCAM calls it before doing anything
                   else.

                   Note: As part of initializing the area map, ARINAM stores the dimension  of  MAP  in  <a href="../man1/MAP.1.html">MAP</a>(1);
                   therefore, the dimension does not have to be given as an argument in calls to ARSCAM.)

       XCS,YCS     (workspace arrays, dimensioned MCS, of type REAL) - Hold the X and Y coordinates defining the
                   edge of a given area, for use by ARSCAM in calls to the area-processing routine APR.

       MCS         (an input expression of type INTEGER) - Dimension of each of the arrays XCS and YCS.

       IAI,IAG     (workspace arrays, dimensioned MAI, of type INTEGER) - Hold MAI pairs of area identifiers and
                   group identifiers, respectively. Used by ARSCAM in calls to the area-processing routine APR.

       MAI         (an input expression of type INTEGER) - Dimension of each of the arrays IAI and IAG. MAI must
                   be greater than or equal to n, where n is the number of groups in the area map.

       APR         (a  subroutine)  -  An area-processing routine that is called by ARSCAM, and must be declared
                   EXTERNAL in the routine that calls ARSCAM. You must supply the routine APR, and it must  have
                   the following form:

                   SUBROUTINE APR (XCS,YCS,NCS,IAI,IAG,NAI)
                   DIMENSION XCS(*),YCS(*),IAI(*),IAG(*)

                   (code to process the area defined by XCS, YCS, IAI, and IAG)

                   RETURN
                   END

                   XCS,YCS     (input arrays, dimensioned NCS, of type REAL) - The X and Y coordinates, in NDCs,
                               of  NCS points defining a polygonal area. The last of these points is a duplicate
                               of the first. Holes in an area are traced in a way that maximizes the probability
                               of hardware fill working properly.

                   NCS         (an input expression of type INTEGER) - Number of X  and  Y  coordinates  in  the
                               arrays XCS and YCS.

                   IAI,IAG     (input  arrays, dimensioned NAI, of type INTEGER) - Hold NAI pairs of identifiers
                               for the area defined by XCS and YCS. For each value of I from 1 to NAI, IAI(I) is
                               the area identifier for the area with respect to the group of edges specified  by
                               the group identifier IAG(I).

                   NAI         (an input expression of type INTEGER) - Number of values returned in IAI and IAG.
                               NAI equals the number of groups of edges that you put in the area map.

       Before  executing the first call to APR, ARSCAM calls GETSET to retrieve the current user coordinates and
       then executes the statement:

       CALL SET (VPL,VPR,VPB,VPT,VPL,VPR,VPB,VPT,1)

       where VPL, VPR, VPB, and VPT are the viewport left, right, bottom, and top coordinates in NDCs.

       This ensures correct results if the NDCs in XCS and YCS are used in calls to such  routines  as  GFA  and
       GPL,  and  it allows clipping at the edges of the viewport. APR may make its own SET call to achieve some
       other effect. Before returning control to the calling routine, ARSCAM calls  SET  again  to  restore  the
       original mapping parameters.
