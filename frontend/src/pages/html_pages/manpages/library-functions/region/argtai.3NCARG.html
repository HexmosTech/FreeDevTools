</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       ARGTAI - Returns the area identifiers associated with a given point.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       CALL ARGTAI (MAP,XCD,YCD,IAI,IAG,MAI,NAI,ICF)

</pre><h4><b>C-BINDING</b> <b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;ncarg/ncargC.h&gt;

       void c_argtai (int *map, float xcd, float ycd, int *iai, int *iag, int mai, int *nai, int icf)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       MAP         (an  input/output  array  of  type  INTEGER)  - An array containing an area map that has been
                   initialized by a call to ARINAM and to which edges have been added by calls  to  AREDAM.   If
                   you  did not preprocess the area map by calling ARPRAM, ARGTAI calls it before doing anything
                   else.

                   Note: As part of initializing the area map, ARINAM stores the dimension  of  MAP  in  <a href="../man1/MAP.1.html">MAP</a>(1);
                   therefore, the dimension does not have to be given as an argument in calls to ARGTAI.)

       XCD         (an input expression of type REAL) - The X coordinate, in the current user coordinate system,
                   of a point about which you want to obtain information.

       YCD         (an input expression of type REAL) - The Y coordinate, in the current user coordinate system,
                   of a point about which you want to obtain information.

       IAI         (an output array, dimensioned MAI, of type INTEGER) - The array in which area identifiers for
                   the area containing the specified point will be returned.

       IAG         (an  output  array,  dimensioned MAI, of type INTEGER) - The array in which group identifiers
                   for the area containing the specified point will be returned.

       MAI         (an input expression of type INTEGER) - Dimension of each of the arrays IAI and IAG. MAI must
                   be greater than or equal to NAI.

       NAI         (an output expression of type INTEGER) - The number of values returned in IAI  and  IAG.  NAI
                   equals the number of groups of edges that you put in the area map.

       ICF         (an  input  expression  of  type  INTEGER)  -  Flag  set  nonzero by you to indicate that the
                   definition of the user coordinate system has been changed since the last call to  ARGTAI;  in
                   this  case,  calls  to  GETSET must be executed by ARGTAI. If you set the flag to zero, Areas
                   assumes that the information retrieved previously is still correct and skips calls to GETSET.
                   This option is valuable if you are planning to make thousands of calls  to  ARGTAI  with  the
                   same area map: do the first one with ICF = 1 and the rest with ICF = 0.

</pre><h4><b>C-BINDING</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The C-binding argument descriptions are the same as the FORTRAN argument descriptions.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Use the ncargex command to see the following relevant examples: carfill, carline, carmap, cbex01, tareas,
       fsppoint.

</pre><h4><b>ACCESS</b></h4><pre>
       To  use ARGTAI or c_argtai, load the NCAR Graphics libraries ncarg, ncarg_gks, and ncarg_c, preferably in
       that order.

</pre><h4><b>MESSAGES</b></h4><pre>
       See the areas man page for a description of all Areas error messages and/or informational messages.
