</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       SFSGFA - (which stands for "SOFTFILL - Simulate GFA") fills, in one of various ways, an area of the
       plotter frame defined by a given set of points; it is intended to provide a way to use the GKS fill-area
       routine, if it works (as is the case in the version of GKS distributed with NCAR Graphics), or a suitable
       pattern-fill substitute, otherwise.  Doing all area fills with SFSGFA has the advantage that the way in
       which they are done can then be changed by modifying the value of a single internal parameter of
       Softfill, named 'TY'.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       CALL SFSGFA (XRA, YRA, NRA, DST, NST, IND, NND, ICI)

</pre><h4><b>C-BINDING</b> <b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;ncarg/ncargC.h&gt;

       void c_sfsgfa (float *xra, float *yra, int nra,
       float *dst, int nst, int *ind, int nnd, int ici)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       XRA         (an  input/output  array of type REAL, dimensioned NRA or greater) contains the X coordinates
                   of the points defining the area to be filled, in the user coordinate system. Upon return, the
                   contents of XRA will have been converted to the fractional coordinate system.

       YRA         (an input/output array of type REAL, dimensioned NRA or greater) contains the  Y  coordinates
                   of the points defining the area to be filled, in the user coordinate system. Upon return, the
                   contents of YRA will have been converted to the fractional coordinate system.

       NRA         (an input expression of type INTEGER) is the number of points defining the area to be filled.
                   NRA must be greater than two.

       DST         (a  scratch  array of type REAL, dimensioned NST) is for use when fill lines are generated by
                   means of calls to SFWRLD and/or SFNORM.

       NST         (an input expression of type INTEGER) is the length of the array DST.  NST  must  be  greater
                   than  or  equal  to  NRA + NIM, where NIM is the largest number of intersection points of any
                   fill line with the boundary lines. To be sure  DST  is  large  enough,  use  NIM  =  NRA;  in
                   practice, NIM rarely needs to be that large. For a convex polygon, for example, NIM = 2.

       IND         (a  scratch  array of type INTEGER, dimensioned NND) is for use when fill lines are generated
                   by means of calls to SFWRLD and/or SFNORM.

       NND         (an input expression of type INTEGER) is the length of the array IND. It must be greater than
                   or equal to NRA + 2 * NIM, where NIM is as defined above.

       ICI         (an input expression of type INTEGER) is, nominally, the fill-area color index  to  be  used.
                   When  the  internal parameter 'TY' has a value other than zero, ICI may be used in some other
                   manner.

</pre><h4><b>C-BINDING</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The C-binding argument descriptions are the same as the Fortran argument descriptions.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       SFSGFA fills the area defined by the points (XRA(I),YRA(I)), for I from 1 to NRA.  The  lines  connecting
       point  1  to point 2, point 2 to point 3, . . ., point NRA-1 to point NRA, and point NRA to point 1 bound
       the area to be filled.

       The values of the internal parameter 'TY' (for 'TYPE OF FILL') and the argument  ICI  determine  how  the
       fill  is  done.   The function of ICI changes depending on the value of 'TY'.  ICI can determine the fill
       area color index, the polyline color index, or the density of the fill pattern.

       'TY' = 0    This is the default. SFSGFA does color fill by calling GFA.  GFA does either  hollow,  solid,
                   or pattern fill. Hollow fill (only boundaries are drawn) is GFA's default, but you can change
                   the  type of fill by calling the GKS subroutine GSFAIS. Notice that one of the first steps in
                   the code for the example "sfex02" is to force solid fill by calling GSFAIS with the  argument
                   "1".

                   A value of ICI greater than or equal to zero specifies the color index of the fill area.

                   A  value  of  ICI  less  than  zero specifies that the fill area color index is not to be set
                   before calling GFA; the last call to the GKS subroutine GSFACI then determines the fill  area
                   color index.

       'TY' = 1    SFSGFA fills the area with parallel lines by calling SFWRLD.

                   A value of ICI greater than or equal to zero specifies the polyline color index.

                   A value of ICI less than zero specifies that the polyline color index is not to be set before
                   calling  SFWRLD;  the  last  call  to the GKS subroutine GSPLCI determines the polyline color
                   index.

                   Parameters 'AN', 'CH', 'DO', and 'SP' further affect the nature of the fill.

                   Note: If 'CH' and 'DO' are set to select dot fill or character fill, the values of  ICI  will
                   not  affect  the color of the dots or characters. The intended use of 'TY' &gt; 0 is to do color
                   fill using colored lines; no provision is made  for  the  use  of  colored  dots  or  colored
                   characters.  (The  current  values  of  the  polymarker  and  text  color indices are used to
                   determine the color.)

       'TY' = 2    SFSGFA calls SFWRLD to fill the area with parallel lines and calls SFNORM to  fill  the  area
                   again with parallel lines perpendicular to the first set.

                   ICI, if zero or greater, specifies the polyline color index.

                   A  negative  value  of  ICI  specifies  that the polyline color index is not to be set before
                   calling SFWRLD; the last call to the GKS subroutine  GSPLCI  determines  the  polyline  color
                   index.

                   Parameters  'AN',  'CH',  'DO',  and 'SP' further affect the nature of the fill. See the note
                   above about ICI's function with 'CH' and 'DO'.

       'TY' = -4, -3, -2, -1
                   SFSGFA fills the area with line patterns by calling SFWRLD and/or SFNORM. The absolute  value
                   of 'TY' determines the maximum number of fill-line angles used in a pattern.

                   ICI determines the density of the lines drawn at each angle.

                   Angles  Used: When 'TY' has one of the following values, fill is done by using lines drawn at
                   the angles shown ('AN' is an internal parameter that specifies an angle in degrees):

                   'TY'  Angles Used (in Degrees)

                    -1   'AN'
                    -2   'AN', 'AN'+90
                    -3   'AN', 'AN'+60, 'AN'+120
                    -4   'AN', 'AN'+45, 'AN'+90, 'AN'+135

                   Line Density: ICI is used to select the density of the lines in each  direction.  A  zero  or
                   negative  value  of  ICI selects a blank pattern. Positive values of ICI select patterns that
                   increase in density as the value of ICI increases.   The  largest  usable  value  of  ICI  is
                   approximately  5*ABS('TY');  beyond that, the pattern becomes essentially solid. For example,
                   if 'TY' is -4, 20 is about the largest value of ICI that you can use and still see a pattern.

                   For each increase in ICI, fill lines are added at one of the usable angles.  The  first  time
                   lines are added at a given angle, they are spaced 32*'SP' units apart.  (The default value of
                   the  internal parameter 'SP' is .00125.) After the first time, each time lines are added at a
                   given angle, they are added between the existing lines so that the distance between lines  at
                   that  angle  is  halved.  An ICI value that is evenly divisible by the absolute value of 'TY'
                   yields a pattern that is evenly dense at all angles. For example, if 'TY' has the  value  -2,
                   the  patterns associated with the first three values of ICI are formed as follows: ICI=1 uses
                   lines at the angle 'AN', spaced 32*'SP' units apart; ICI=2 uses lines at the angles 'AN'  and
                   'AN'+90,  both spaced 32*'SP' units apart; ICI=3 uses lines at the angle 'AN', spaced 32*'SP'
                   units apart, and lines at the angle 'AN'+90, spaced 16*'SP' units apart.

       For SFSGFA to fill an uncomplicated polygon (one without holes), XRA and YRA  should  contain  the  world
       coordinates  of  the polygon's vertices in the order in which they are encountered as the boundary of the
       polygon is traced.

       To leave an unfilled hole in a polygon, do the following: (1) add the vertices of the hole, in the proper
       order, to XRA and YRA; (2) repeat the first vertex of the hole to close it; (3) repeat the last vertex of
       the outer polygon boundary to tie the first point of the hole to the last point of  the  polygon's  outer
       boundary.

       To  fill  what  was  unfilled and vice versa, do the following: (1) add the four coordinates of the frame
       corners; (2) repeat the coordinates of the first corner of the frame; (3) repeat the final point  of  the
       original  polygon.  In  effect,  this  makes what was previously inside, outside, and what was previously
       outside, inside.

       When a polygon contains holes, there are connecting lines between the outer boundary of the  polygon  and
       the  boundaries  of  the  holes. When doing software fill (internal parameter 'TY' not equal to 0), these
       connecting lines cause no trouble; however, when doing solid  fill  (internal  parameter  'TY'=  0),  the
       hardware  fill  algorithms  will  frequently  display  unfortunate edge effects along such lines. You can
       minimize these effects by using only horizontal or vertical connecting lines and by ensuring they do  not
       cross any of the original boundary lines.
