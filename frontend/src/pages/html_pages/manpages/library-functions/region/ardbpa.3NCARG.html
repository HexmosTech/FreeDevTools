</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       ARDBPA - Produces a plot showing all of the edge segments in an area map that have a specified group
       identifier IGRP; if IGRP is less than or equal to zero, all groups are included.  Such plots allow one to
       debug problems with an area map.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       CALL ARDBPA (MAP,IGRP,LABEL)

</pre><h4><b>C-BINDING</b> <b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;ncarg/ncargC.h&gt;

       void c_ardbpa (int *map, int igrp, char *label)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       MAP         (an  input/output  array of type INTEGER) - An array containing an area map that has at least
                   been initialized by a call to ARINAM and to which edges will  probably  have  been  added  by
                   calls to AREDAM.

                   Note:  As  part  of  initializing the area map, ARINAM stores the dimension of MAP in <a href="../man1/MAP.1.html">MAP</a>(1);
                   therefore, the dimension does not have to be given as an argument in calls to ARDBPA.)

       IGRP        (an input expression of type INTEGER) - The group identifier of the group that  you  want  to
                   examine.  If IGRP is less than or equal to zero, edges from all groups will be shown.

       LABEL       (an input constant or variable of type CHARACTER) - The label you want put on the plot.

</pre><h4><b>C-BINDING</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The C-binding argument descriptions are the same as the FORTRAN argument descriptions.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       When ARDBPA is called, it draws the requested picture and then calls FRAME to advance to a new frame.

       By  default,  each edge segment in the plot appears in one of four different colors, depending on whether
       the area identifiers to the left and right are less than or equal  to  zero  or  greater  than  zero,  as
       follows:

       Color     Left area identifier      Right area identifier
       -----     --------------------      ---------------------

       Magenta   Less than or equal to 0   Less than or equal to 0
       Yellow    Less than or equal to 0   Greater than 0
       Cyan      Greater than 0            Less than or equal to 0
       White     Greater than 0            Greater than 0

       In  some  cases you may notice gray lines in your plot. This means that the same edge occurs in more than
       one group. In all but one of those groups, Areas negates the group identifier for the edge  in  the  area
       map.  This  allows Areas to include the edge when it is looking at a particular group (as in ARPRAM), but
       omit it when it is looking at the union of all the groups (as in ARSCAM).

       Color indices DC+1 through DC+5 are used for the required colors.  The default value of DC is 100, so, by
       default, ARDBPA redefines color indices 101 through 105.  If this would result in colors  that  you  have
       defined being redefined, you should change the value of DC to something else.

       Nominally,  each  edge  segment  is  shown  with  an  arrowhead, indicating the order in which the points
       defining the edge segment occur in the area map and therefore which side of the edge segment  is  to  the
       left  and  which  side is to the right.  In regions where putting an arrowhead on each edge segment would
       result in too much clutter, some of them may be omitted.

       The left and right area identifiers for each edge  segment  are  written  in  the  appropriate  positions
       relative to the edge segment.  Also, if IGRP is less than or equal to zero, the group identifier for each
       edge  segment  is  written on the segment itself.  These identifiers are intentionally written using very
       small characters; the idea is that you can look at the whole plot to get some idea  of  possible  problem
       regions;  when  such  a  region is found, you can enlarge it, using the "zoom" capability of "idt", for a
       closer look; at that point, the area identifiers become readable.

       If ARDBPA is used for a complicated area map, the amount of output can be very large.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Use the ncargex command to see the following relevant examples: arex01, cardb2.

</pre><h4><b>ACCESS</b></h4><pre>
       To use ARDBPA or c_ardbpa, load the NCAR Graphics libraries ncarg, ncarg_gks, and ncarg_c, preferably  in
       that order.
