       ARPRAM - Preprocesses an area map that has been initialized by a call to ARINAM and to which edges have
       been added by calls to AREDAM.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       CALL ARPRAM (MAP,IF1,IF2,IF3)

</pre><h4><b>C-BINDING</b> <b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;ncarg/ncargC.h&gt;

       void c_arpram (int *map, int if1, int if2, int if3)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Preprocessing an area map is a seven-step process that makes all of the area-identifier information in
       the area map consistent:

       Step 1:     ARPRAM  shortens edge segments whose projections on the X axis are more than twice as long as
                   the average. ARPRAM does this by interpolating points  along  their  lengths.  This  improves
                   efficiency when executing other parts of the algorithm.

       Step 2:     ARPRAM  locates  all  intersections of edge segments and interpolates the intersection points
                   along these edge segments.  This step can take a lot of time. If you set  IF1  nonzero,  then
                   pairs of edge segments are examined for intersections only if one of the pair has a left or a
                   right area identifier that is zero or negative.

       Step 3:     ARPRAM  locates  coincident  edge  segments (edge segments with identical endpoints).  If two
                   such coincident edge segments belong to the same group, one  of  them  is  removed;  if  they
                   belong  to  different groups, one of them is modified in such a way that it will appear to be
                   present when looking for areas defined by edge segments in a  particular  group,  but  absent
                   when looking for areas defined by all edge segments.

       Step 4:     ARPRAM  searches  for  and  removes "dangling" edge segments (those that do not contribute to
                   enclosing any area). This step is skipped if IF2 is nonzero.

       Step 5:     ARPRAM looks for holes in the areas defined by each edge  group  and  draws  connecting  edge
                   segments between the edge and the hole. This step is skipped if IF3 is nonzero.

       Step 6:     ARPRAM adjusts area identifier information in the area map. It examines all the edge segments
                   of  each  area  in each group to see what area identifier should be assigned to the area, and
                   then makes adjustments.

       Step 7:     Connecting lines that were inserted in step 5 are removed from the area map.

       You can put edges in an area map, preprocess it, add more edges, preprocess it again, and so on.

       Each of the routines ARDRLN, ARGTAI, and  ARSCAM  checks  to  make  sure  that  the  area  map  has  been
       preprocessed  since  the  last  time  that  edges  were  added  to it and, if not, calls ARPRAM; the only
       advantage to the user of calling ARPRAM directly is to use the time-saving  shortcuts  specified  by  the
       arguments IF1, IF2, and IF3.

       The arguments of ARPRAM are as follows:

       MAP         (an  input/output  array  of  type  INTEGER)  - An array containing an area map that has been
                   initialized by a call to ARINAM and to which edges have been added by calls to AREDAM.

                   Note: As part of initializing the area map, ARINAM stores the dimension  of  MAP  in  <a href="../man1/MAP.1.html">MAP</a>(1);
                   therefore, the dimension does not have to be given as an argument in calls to ARPRAM.)

       IF1         (an  input expression of type INTEGER) - If you set IF1 nonzero, ARPRAM checks a pair of edge
                   segments for intersection only if one of the pair has a left or right area identifier that is
                   zero or negative. This would be appropriate for contour lines, which intersect the perimeter,
                   but do not intersect each other.

       IF2         (an input expression of type INTEGER) - If you set IF2 nonzero, ARPRAM  does  not  check  for
                   dangling  edges. This would be appropriate for contour lines, which are known not to have any
                   such edges. This is not appropriate for Ezmap  boundary  lines,  because  the  Ezmap  dataset
                   contains some edge segments (small islands) that are formed by unclosed curves.

       IF3         (an  input expression of type INTEGER) - If you set IF3 nonzero, ARPRAM speeds up the process
                   of adjusting area identifiers by omitting the consideration of "holes" in the areas examined.
                   This is appropriate for contour lines as long as the left and right area identifiers provided
                   at each contour level are consistent with those provided at the adjacent levels.

</pre><h4><b>C-BINDING</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The C-binding argument descriptions are the same as the FORTRAN argument descriptions.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Use the ncargex command to see the following relevant examples: eezmpa, tareas, tezmpa, fsppoint.

</pre><h4><b>ACCESS</b></h4><pre>
       To use ARPRAM or c_arpram, load the NCAR Graphics libraries ncarg, ncarg_gks, and ncarg_c, preferably  in
       that order.

</pre><h4><b>MESSAGES</b></h4><pre>
       See the areas man page for a description of all Areas error messages and/or informational messages.
