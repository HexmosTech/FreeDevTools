</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Pod::Weaver::Section::Region - find a region and put its contents in place where desired

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 4.020

</pre><h4><b>OVERVIEW</b></h4><pre>
       This section will find and include a located hunk of Pod.  In general, it will find a region with the
       specified name, such as:

         =begin :myfoo

         =head1 More Pod Here

         =end :myfoo

       In other words, if your configuration include:

         [Region]
         region_name = myfoo

       ...then this weaver will look for "=begin :myfoo" ( and "=for :myfoo" and... ) and include it at the
       appropriate location in your output.

       Since you'll probably want to use Region several times, and that will require giving each use a unique
       name, you can omit "region_name" if you provide a plugin name, and it will default to the plugin name.
       In other words, the configuration above could be specified just as:

         [Region / myfoo]

       If the "required" attribute is given, and true, then an exception will be raised if this region can't be
       found.

</pre><h4><b>PERL</b> <b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This module should work on any version of perl still receiving updates from the Perl 5 Porters.  This
       means it should work on any version of perl released in the last two to three years.  (That is, if the
       most recently released version is v5.40, then this module should work on both v5.40 and v5.38.)

       Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made that the minimum required version
       will not be increased.  The version may be increased for any reason, and there is no promise that patches
       will be accepted to lower the minimum required perl.

</pre><h4><b>ATTRIBUTES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>required</b>
       A boolean value specifying whether this region is required to be present or not. Defaults to false.

       If it's enabled and the region can't be found an exception will be raised.

   <b>region_name</b>
       The name of this region. Defaults to the plugin name.

   <b>allow_nonpod</b>
       A boolean value specifying whether nonpod regions are allowed or not. Defaults to false.

       "nonpod" regions are regions <u>without</u> a ":" prefix as explained in perlpodspec

         # region_name = myregion
         # is_pod = false
         =begin myregion

         # region_name = myregion
         # is_pod = true
         =begin :myregion

   <b>flatten</b>
       A boolean value specifying whether the region's contents should be flattened or not. Defaults to true.

         #unflattened
         =begin :myregion

         =head1

         =end :myregion

         #flattened
         =head1
