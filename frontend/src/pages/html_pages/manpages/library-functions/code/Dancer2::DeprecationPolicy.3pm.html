</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Dancer2::DeprecationPolicy - Define the process by which outdated, broken, or unused code is removed from
       Dancer2

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 1.1.2

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       While there are conflicting ideas about deprecation, in Dancer2, deprecated code is code that:

       •   Is in the way of implementing important features or fixes that provide more value.

       •   Has a negative impact on the integrity and security of user code, whether by misusing it to not.

       •   Provides a negative experience for the users.

       Deprecated  code is code we either had to write and can now remove or we thought was a good idea and were
       wrong. It is code that doesn't overall benefit users or the developers.

       Deprecated code is code that is marked for eventual removal and we do not intend to keep in  the  Dancer2
       codebase.

</pre><h4><b>DEPRECATION</b> <b>PROCESS</b></h4><pre>
       •   Code to be deprecated is posted/discussed publicly (see below)

       •   Deprecated code enters soft deprecation phase

       •   After 12 months or 2 major releases, code is hard deprecated

       •   After 6 months or 1 major release, hard deprecated code is removed

       Deprecated  code  is  marked  with  warnings  and  the  version and/or date in which it will no longer be
       available.

   <b>Public</b> <b>Notice</b>
       When a feature/code is to be deprecated, the Dancer Core Team will create a  new  GitHub  issue  for  the
       code/feature  to be deprecated, and announce this in a public manner (blog post, Twitter, and the mailing
       list, at minimum). The notice should provide the reason for the deprecation, what  Dancer2/the  community
       is  gaining  as  a  result  of  the  deprecation,  and  what the officially recognized alternative to the
       deprecated code is.

       The public notice period will provide the developer/user base  an  opportunity  to  voice  objections  or
       provide  feedback  or  alternatives  to  deprecation.  It  also allows the Core Team to better assess the
       potential long range effects of deprecation.

       While the deprecated feature/code can be discussed by community, the decision will be ultimately made  by
       the  Dancer Core Team. There is no definitive time for the public notice period to end; some deprecations
       are more urgent than others, and each situation is left to the discretion of the Core Team, with feedback
       from the community.

   <b>Soft</b> <b>Deprecation</b>
       When code is soft deprecated, a warning will be thrown to indicate that the  code  is  to  be  considered
       deprecated. Apps will continue to function normally otherwise.

   <b>Hard</b> <b>Deprecation</b>
       After  12  months  or  two  major  releases  (whichever  comes  first), the code is considered to be hard
       deprecated. An error will continue to be thrown, but unlike soft  deprecation,  continued  usage  of  the
       deprecated code will cause the application to die.

       There  is  one  caveat  to this: code will <b>never</b> be deprecated for less than 6 months. So if we deprecate
       code after v0.500000, become unusually productive, and produce Dancer 0.600000  and  0.700000  in  a  two
       month timeframe, no deprecated code will be removed because 6 months hasn't elapsed.

   <b>Removal</b>
       Six  months  following hard deprecation, or one major release after hard deprecation, the deprecated code
       is removed from Dancer2.

</pre><h4><b>EXCEPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       In special cases, based on community feedback, these timelines may be extended.  But we expect this to be
       a rare occurrence, at best.

</pre><h4><b>PLUGINS</b></h4><pre>
       We strongly encourage (but cannot/do not require) plugin authors to adopt the same policy.
