</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Scalar::Does - like ref() but useful

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Scalar::Does qw( -constants );

         my $object = bless {}, 'Some::Class';

         does($object, 'Some::Class');   # true
         does($object, '%{}');           # true
         does($object, HASH);            # true
         does($object, ARRAY);           # false

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       It has long been noted that Perl would benefit from a does() built-in.  A check that "ref($thing) eq
       'ARRAY'" doesn't allow you to accept an object that uses overloading to provide an array-like interface.

   <b>Functions</b>
       "does($scalar, $role)"
           Checks  if a scalar is capable of performing the given role. The following (case-sensitive) roles are
           predefined:

           •   <b>SCALAR</b> or <b>${}</b>

               Checks if the scalar can be used as a scalar reference.

               Note: this role does not check whether a scalar is a scalar (which is obviously true) but whether
               it is a reference to another scalar.

           •   <b>ARRAY</b> or <b>@{}</b>

               Checks if the scalar can be used as an array reference.

           •   <b>HASH</b> or <b>%{}</b>

               Checks if the scalar can be used as a hash reference.

           •   <b>CODE</b> or <b>&amp;{}</b>

               Checks if the scalar can be used as a code reference.

           •   <b>GLOB</b> or <b>*{}</b>

               Checks if the scalar can be used as a glob reference.

           •   <b>REF</b>

               Checks if the scalar can be used as a ref reference (i.e. a reference to another reference).

           •   <b>LVALUE</b>

               Checks if the scalar is a reference  to  a  special  lvalue  (e.g.  the  result  of  "substr"  or
               "splice").

           •   <b>IO</b> or <b>&lt;&gt;</b>

               Uses IO::Detect to check if the scalar is a filehandle or file-handle-like object.

               (The "&lt;&gt;" check is slightly looser, allowing objects which overload "&lt;&gt;", though overloading "&lt;&gt;"
               well can be a little tricky.)

           •   <b>VSTRING</b>

               Checks if the scalar is a vstring reference.

           •   <b>FORMAT</b>

               Checks if the scalar is a format reference.

           •   <b>Regexp</b> or <b>qr</b>

               Checks if the scalar can be used as a quoted regular expression.

           •   <b>bool</b>

               Checks if the scalar can be used as a boolean. (It's pretty rare for this to not be true.)

           •   <b>""</b>

               Checks if the scalar can be used as a string. (It's pretty rare for this to not be true.)

           •   <b>0+</b>

               Checks if the scalar can be used as a number. (It's pretty rare for this to not be true.)

               Note  that  this  is  far  looser  than  "looks_like_number"  from Scalar::Util.  For example, an
               unblessed arrayref can be used as a number (it numifies to its  reference  address);  the  string
               "Hello World" can be used as a number (it numifies to 0).

           •   <b>~~</b>

               Checks if the scalar can be used on the right hand side of a smart match.

           If the given <u>role</u> is blessed, and provides a "check" method, then "does" delegates to that.

           Otherwise,  if  the scalar being tested is blessed, then "$scalar-&gt;DOES($role)" is called, and "does"
           returns true if the method call returned true.

           If the scalar being tested looks like a Perl class name, then "$scalar-&gt;DOES($role)" is also  called,
           and the string "0E0" is returned for success, which evaluates to 0 in a numeric context but true in a
           boolean context.

       does($role)
           Called with a single argument, tests $_. Yes, this works with lexical $_.

             given ($object) {
                when(does ARRAY)  { ... }
                when(does HASH)   { ... }
             }

           Note:  in Scalar::Does 0.007 and below the single-argument form of "does" returned a curried coderef.
           This was changed in Scalar::Does 0.008.

       "overloads($scalar, $role)"
           A function "overloads" (which just checks overloading) is also available.

       overloads($role)
           Called with a single argument, tests $_. Yes, this works with lexical $_.

           Note: in Scalar::Does 0.007 and below the single-argument form  of  "overloads"  returned  a  curried
           coderef. This was changed in Scalar::Does 0.008.

       blessed($scalar), reftype($scalar), looks_like_number($scalar)
           For   convenience,   this   module   can   also   re-export   these   functions   from  Scalar::Util.
           "looks_like_number" is generally more useful than "does($scalar, q[0+])".

       "make_role $name, where { BLOCK }"
           Returns an anonymous role object which can be used as a parameter to "does". The block  is  arbitrary
           code which should check whether $_[0] does the role.

       "where { BLOCK }"
           Syntactic    sugar    for    "make_role".    Compatible    with    the    "where"    function    from
           Moose::Util::TypeConstraints, so don't worry about conflicts.

   <b>Constants</b>
       The following constants may be exported for convenience:

       "SCALAR"
       "ARRAY"
       "HASH"
       "CODE"
       "GLOB"
       "REF"
       "LVALUE"
       "IO"
       "VSTRING"
       "FORMAT"
       "REGEXP"
       "BOOLEAN"
       "STRING"
       "NUMBER"
       "SMARTMATCH"

   <b>Export</b>
       By default, only "does" is exported. This module uses Exporter::Tiny, so functions can be renamed:

         use Scalar::Does does =&gt; { -as =&gt; 'performs_role' };

       Scalar::Does also plays some tricks with namespace::clean to ensure that any functions it exports to your
       namespace are cleaned up when you're finished with them. This ensures  that  if  you're  writing  object-
       oriented  code  "does"  and  "overloads"  will  not  be  left  hanging around as methods of your classes.
       Moose::Object provides a "does" method, and you should be able to use  Scalar::Does  without  interfering
       with that.

       You can import the constants (plus "does") using:

         use Scalar::Does -constants;

       The "make_role" and "where" functions can be exported like this:

         use Scalar::Does -make;

       Or list specific functions/constants that you wish to import:

         use Scalar::Does qw( does ARRAY HASH STRING NUMBER );

   <b>Custom</b> <b>Role</b> <b>Checks</b>
         use Scalar::Does
           custom =&gt; { -as =&gt; 'does_array', -role =&gt; 'ARRAY' },
           custom =&gt; { -as =&gt; 'does_hash',  -role =&gt; 'HASH'  };

         does_array($thing);
         does_hash($thing);

   <b>Relationship</b> <b>to</b> <b>Moose</b> <b>roles</b>
       Scalar::Does  is  not dependent on Moose, and its role-checking is not specific to Moose's idea of roles,
       but it does work well with Moose roles.

       Moose::Object overrides "DOES", so Moose objects and Moose roles should "just work" with Scalar::Does.

         {
           package Transport;
           use Moose::Role;
         }

         {
           package Train;
           use Moose;
           with qw(Transport);
         }

         my $thomas = Train-&gt;new;
         does($thomas, 'Train');          # true
         does($thomas, 'Transport');      # true
         does($thomas, Transport-&gt;meta);  # not yet supported!

       Mouse::Object should be compatible enough to work as well.

       See also: Moose::Role, Moose::Object, UNIVERSAL.

   <b>Relationship</b> <b>to</b> <b>Moose</b> <b>type</b> <b>constraints</b>
       Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint objects, plus the constants exported by MooseX::Types libraries all provide a
       "check" method, so again, should "just work" with Scalar::Does. Type constraint strings are not supported
       however.

         use Moose::Util::TypeConstraints qw(find_type_constraint);
         use MooseX::Types qw(Int);
         use Scalar::Does qw(does);

         my $int = find_type_constraint("Int");

         does( "123", $int );     # true
         does( "123", Int );      # true
         does( "123", "Int" );    # false

       Mouse::Meta::TypeConstraints and MouseX::Types should be compatible enough to work as well.

       See      also:      Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint,       Moose::Util::TypeConstraints,       MooseX::Types,
       Scalar::Does::MooseTypes.

   <b>Relationship</b> <b>to</b> <b>Type::Tiny</b> <b>type</b> <b>constraints</b>
       Types built with Type::Tiny and Type::Library can be used exactly as Moose type constraint objects above.

         use Types::Standard qw(Int);
         use Scalar::Does qw(does);

         does(123, Int);   # true

       In fact, Type::Tiny and related libraries are used extensively in the internals of Scalar::Does 0.200+.

       See also: Type::Tiny, Types::Standard.

   <b>Relationship</b> <b>to</b> <b>Role::Tiny</b> <b>and</b> <b>Moo</b> <b>roles</b>
       Roles  using Role::Tiny 1.002000 and above provide a "DOES" method, so should work with Scalar::Does just
       like Moose roles. Prior to that release, Role::Tiny did not provide "DOES".

       Moo's role system is based on Role::Tiny.
