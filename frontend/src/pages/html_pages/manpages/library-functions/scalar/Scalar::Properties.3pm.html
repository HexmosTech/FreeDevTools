</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Scalar::Properties - Run-time properties on scalar variables

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 1.100860

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Scalar::Properties;
         my $val = 0-&gt;true;
           if ($val &amp;&amp; $val == 0) {
           print "yup, its true alright...\n";
         }

         my @text = (
           'hello world'-&gt;<a href="../man1/greeting.1.html">greeting</a>(1),
           'forget it',
           'hi there'-&gt;<a href="../man1/greeting.1.html">greeting</a>(1),
         );
         print grep { $_-&gt;is_greeting } @text;

         my $l =  'hello world'-&gt;length;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Scalar::Properties attempts to make Perl more object-oriented by taking an idea from Ruby: Everything you
       manipulate is an object, and the results of those manipulations are objects themselves.

         'hello world'-&gt;length
         (-1234)-&gt;abs
         "oh my god, it's full of properties"-&gt;index('g')

       The first example asks a string to calculate its length. The second example asks a number to calculate
       its absolute value. And the third example asks a string to find the index of the letter 'g'.

       Using this module you can have run-time properties on initialized scalar variables and literal values.
       The word 'properties' is used in the Perl 6 sense: out-of-band data, little sticky notes that are
       attached to the value. While attributes (as in Perl 5's attribute pragma, and see the "Attribute::*"
       family of modules) are handled at compile-time, properties are handled at run-time.

       Internally properties are implemented by making their values into objects with overloaded operators. The
       actual properties are then simply hash entries.

       Most properties are simply notes you attach to the value, but some may have deeper meaning. For example,
       the "true" and "false" properties plays a role in boolean context, as the first example of the Synopsis
       shows.

       Properties can also be propagated between values. For details, see the EXPORTS section below. Here is an
       example why this might be desirable:

         pass_on('approximate');
         my $pi = 3-&gt;<a href="../man1/approximate.1.html">approximate</a>(1);
         my $circ = 2 * $rad * $pi;

         # now $circ-&gt;approximate indicates that this value was derived
         # from approximate values

       Please don't use properties whose name start with an underscore; these are reserved for internal use.

       You can set and query properties like this:

       "$var-&gt;<a href="../man1/myprop.1.html">myprop</a>(1)"
           sets the property to a true value.

       "$var-&gt;<a href="../man0/myprop.0.html">myprop</a>(0)"
           sets  the  property  to  a false value. Note that this doesn't delete the property (to do so, use the
           "del_props" method described below).

       "$var-&gt;is_myprop", "$var-&gt;has_myprop"
           returns a true value if the property is set (i.e., defined and has a true value). The  two  alternate
           interfaces are provided to make querying attributes sound more natural. For example:

             $foo-&gt;is_approximate;
             $bar-&gt;has_history;

       Values  thus  made  into objects also expose various utility methods.  All of those methods (unless noted
       otherwise) return the result as an overloaded value ready to take properties and method calls itself, and
       don't modify the original value.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>get_props</b>
       Get a list of names of the value's properties.

   <b>del_props(LIST)</b>
       Deletes one or more properties from the value. This is different than setting the property value to zero.

   <b>del_all_props</b>
       Deletes all of the value's properties.

   <b>plus(EXPR)</b>
       Returns the value that is the sum of the value whose method has been called and the argument value.  This
       method also overloads addition, so:

         $a = 7 + 2;
         $a = 7-&gt;<a href="../man2/plus.2.html">plus</a>(2);    # the same

   <b>minus(EXPR)</b>
       Returns  the  value  that  is  the  the value whose method has been called minus the argument value. This
       method also overloads subtraction.

   <b>times(EXPR)</b>
       Returns the value that is the the value whose method has been  called  times  the  argument  value.  This
       method also overloads multiplication.

   <b>divide(EXPR)</b>
       Returns  the value that is the the value whose method has been called divided by the argument value. This
       method also overloads division.

   <b>modulo(EXPR)</b>
       Returns the value that is the the value whose method has been called  modulo  the  argument  value.  This
       method also overloads the modulo operator.

   <b>exp(EXPR)</b>
       Returns  the value that is the the value whose method has been called powered by the argument value. This
       method also overloads the exponentiation operator.

   <b>abs</b>
       Returns the absolute of the value.

   <b>zero</b>
       Returns a boolean value indicating whether the value is equal to 0.

   <b>length</b>
       Returns the result of the built-in "length" function applied to the value.

   <b>size</b>
       Same as "length()".

   <b>reverse</b>
       Returns the reverse string of the value.

   <b>uc</b>
       Returns the result of the built-in function "uc()" applied to the value.

   <b>ucfirst</b>
       Returns the result of the built-in function "ucfirst()" applied to the value.

   <b>lc</b>
       Returns the result of the built-in function "lc()" applied to the value.

   <b>lcfirst</b>
       Returns the result of the built-in function "lcfirst()" applied to the value.

   <b>hex</b>
       Returns the result of the built-in function "hex()" applied to the value.

   <b>oct</b>
       Returns the result of the built-in function "oct()" applied to the value.

   <b>concat(EXPR)</b>
       Returns the result of the argument expression appended to the value.

   <b>append(EXPR)</b>
       Same as "concat(EXPR)".

   <b>swapcase</b>
       Returns a version of the value with every character's case reversed, i.e. a lowercase  character  becomes
       uppercase and vice versa.

   <b>split</b> <b>/PATTERN/,</b> <b>LIMIT</b>
       Returns  a  list  of overloaded values that is the result of splitting (according to the built-in "split"
       function) the value along the pattern, into a number of values up to the limit.

   <b>numcmp(EXPR)</b>
       Returns the (overloaded) value of the numerical three-way comparison.  This  method  also  overloads  the
       "&lt;=&gt;" operator.

   <b>cmp(EXPR)</b>
       Returns  the (overloaded) value of the alphabetical three-way comparison.  This method also overloads the
       "cmp" operator.

   <b>eq(EXPR)</b>
       Return the (overloaded) boolean value of the "eq" string comparison.  This  method  also  overloads  that
       operators.

       operators.

       operators.

   <b>gt(EXPR)</b>

       operators.

   <b>le(EXPR)</b>
       Return the (overloaded) boolean value of the "le" string comparison.  This  method  also  overloads  that
       operators.

   <b>ge(EXPR)</b>
       Return  the  (overloaded)  boolean  value  of the "ge" string comparison. This method also overloads that
       operators.

   <b>eqi</b>
       Same as "eq()", but is case-insensitive.

   <b>nei&gt;</b>
       Same as "ne()", but is case-insensitive.

   <b>lti</b>
       Same as "lt()", but is case-insensitive.

   <b>gti</b>
       Same as "gt()", but is case-insensitive.

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>pass_on(LIST)</b>
       Sets (replaces) the list of properties that are passed on. There is only one  such  list  for  the  whole
       mechanism.  The  whole property interface is experimental, but this one in particular is likely to change
       in the future. This function is exported automatically.

   <b>passed_on(STRING)</b>
       Tests whether a  property  is  passed  on  and  returns  a  boolean  value.  This  function  is  exported
       automatically.

   <b>get_pass_on</b>
       Returns a list of names of properties that are passed on. This function is exported automatically.
