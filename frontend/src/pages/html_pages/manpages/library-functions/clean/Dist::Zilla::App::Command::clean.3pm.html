</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Dist::Zilla::App::Command::clean - clean up after build, test, or install

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 6.032

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         dzil clean [ --dry-run|-n ]

       This command removes some files that are created during build, test, and install.  It's a very thin layer
       over the "clean" method on the Dist::Zilla object.  The documentation for that method gives more
       information about the files that will be removed.

</pre><h4><b>PERL</b> <b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This module should work on any version of perl still receiving updates from the Perl 5 Porters.  This
       means it should work on any version of perl released in the last two to three years.  (That is, if the
       most recently released version is v5.40, then this module should work on both v5.40 and v5.38.)

       Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made that the minimum required version
       will not be increased.  The version may be increased for any reason, and there is no promise that patches
       will be accepted to lower the minimum required perl.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>-n,</b> <b>--dry-run</b>
       Nothing is removed; instead, everything that would be removed will be listed.
