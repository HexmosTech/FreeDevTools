</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Net::Duo::Admin::Phone - Representation of a Duo phone

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           my $decoded_json = get_json();
           my $phone = Net::Duo::Admin::Phone-&gt;new($decoded_json);
           say $phone-&gt;number;

</pre><h4><b>REQUIREMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Perl 5.14 or later and the modules HTTP::Request and HTTP::Response (part of HTTP::Message), JSON, LWP
       (also known as libwww-perl), Perl6::Slurp, Sub::Install, and URI::Escape (part of URI), all of which are
       available from CPAN.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       A Net::Duo::Admin::Phone object is a Perl representation of a Duo phone as returned by the Duo Admin API,
       usually via the <b>phones()</b> method or nested in a user returned by the <b>users()</b> method.  It contains various
       information about a phone.

</pre><h4><b>CLASS</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       create(DUO, DATA)
           Creates  a  new  phone in Duo and returns the resulting phone as a new Net::Duo::Admin::Phone object.
           DUO is the Net::Duo object that should be used to perform the creation.  DATA is  a  reference  to  a
           hash with the following keys:

           extension
               The extension.  Optional.

           name
               The name of the phone.  Optional.

           number
               The phone number.  Optional.

           platform
               The  platform  of  phone  for Duo Mobile, or "unknown" for a generic phone type.  For the list of
               valid values, see the Duo Admin API documentation.  Optional.

           postdelay
               The time (in seconds) to wait after the extension is dialed and before the speaking  the  prompt.
               Optional.

           predelay
               The  time  (in  seconds)  to  wait  after  the  number picks up and before dialing the extension.
               Optional.

           type
               The type of the phone.  See the "<b>type()</b>" method below for the possible values.  Optional.

       new(DUO, DATA)
           Creates a new Net::Duo::Admin::Phone object from a full data set.  DUO is the  Net::Duo  object  that
           should be used for any further actions on this object.  DATA should be the data structure returned by
           the Duo REST API for a single user, after JSON decoding.

       new(DUO, ID)
           Creates  a new Net::Duo::Admin::Phone by ID.  DUO is the Net::Duo object that is used to retrieve the
           phone from Duo and will be used for any subsequent operations.  The ID should be the  Duo  identifier
           of the phone.  This constructor is distinguished from the previous constructor by checking whether ID
           is a reference.

</pre><h4><b>INSTANCE</b> <b>ACTION</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       activation_url([ARGS])
           Request  activation  URLs  (and  optionally  an  install  URL)  for  this phone.  ARGS is an optional
           reference to a hash whose keys should be chosen from the following:

           install
               If set to a true value, request an installation URL for this phone  as  well  as  the  activation
               URLs.   This is a URL that, when opened, will prompt the user to install Duo Mobile.  The default
               is to not request an installation URL.

           valid_secs
               The number of seconds these activation URLs should be valid for.   The  default  is  86,400  (one
               day).

           The return value of this method will be a reference to a hash containing the following keys:

           activation_url
               Opening this URL with the Duo Mobile app will complete activation.

           activation_barcode
               URL of an image that can be scanned with Duo Mobile to complete activation.  Activating with this
               image or with the activation URL will produce the same result.

           installation_url
               Opening  this  URL  on  the  phone will prompt the user to install Duo Mobile.  This will only be
               present if the install argument is set to a true value.

           valid_secs
               The number of seconds that the activation code is valid for.  Normally this will be the  same  as
               the  valid_secs  argument  in  the  request  if it was present, unless Duo rejected the requested
               validity interval.

       <b>commit()</b>
           Commit all changes made via the set_*() methods to Duo.  Until this method  is  called,  any  changes
           made via set_*() are only internal to the object and not reflected in Duo.

           After  <b>commit()</b>,  the  internal  representation of the object will be refreshed to match the new data
           returned by the Duo API for that object.  Therefore, other fields of  the  object  may  change  after
           <b>commit()</b> if some other user has changed other, unrelated fields in the object.

           It's  best  to  think  of  this  method  as  a  synchronize  operation: changed data is written back,
           overwriting what's in Duo, and unchanged data may be overwritten by whatever is currently in Duo,  if
           it is different.

       <b>delete()</b>
           Delete  this  phone  from  Duo.  After successful completion of this call, the Net::Duo::Admin::Phone
           object should be considered read-only, since no further changes to the  object  can  be  meaningfully
           sent to Duo.

       <b>json()</b>
           Convert  the  data  stored  in  the object to JSON and return the results.  The resulting JSON should
           match the JSON that one would get back from the Duo web service when retrieving the same object (plus
           any changes made locally to the  object  via  set_*()  methods).   This  is  primarily  intended  for
           debugging dumps or for passing Duo objects to other systems via further JSON APIs.

       <b>send_sms_passcodes()</b>
           Generate a new batch of SMS passcodes and send them to the phone in a single SMS message.  The number
           of passcodes sent is a global setting on the Duo account.

</pre><h4><b>INSTANCE</b> <b>DATA</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       Some  fields have set_*() methods.  Those methods replace the value of the field in its entirety with the
       new value passed in.  This change is only made locally in the object until <b>commit()</b> is called.

       <b>activated()</b>
           Whether the phone has been activated for Duo Mobile.

       <b>capabilities()</b>
           A list of phone capabilities, chosen from the following values:

           "push"
               The device is activated for Duo Push.

           "phone"
               The device can receive phone calls.

           "sms"
               The device can receive batches of SMS passcodes.

       <b>extension()</b>
       set_extension(EXTENSION)
           The extension for this phone, if any.

       <b>name()</b>
       set_name(NAME)
           The name of this phone.

       <b>number()</b>
       set_number(NUMBER)
           The number for this phone, without any extension.

       <b>phone_id()</b>
           The unique ID of this phone as generated by Duo on phone creation.

       <b>platform()</b>
       set_platform(PLATFORM)
           The platform of phone for Duo Mobile, or "unknown" for a generic phone type.  For the list  of  valid
           values, see the Duo Admin API documentation.

       <b>postdelay()</b>
       set_postdelay(POSTDELAY)
           The time (in seconds) to wait after the extension is dialed and before the speaking the prompt.

       <b>predelay()</b>
       set_predelay(PREDELAY)
           The time (in seconds) to wait after the number picks up and before dialing the extension.

       <b>sms_passcodes_sent()</b>
           Whether SMS passcodes have been sent to this phone.

       <b>type()</b>
       set_type(TYPE)
           The type of phone, chosen from "unknown", "mobile", or "landline".

       <b>users()</b>
           The users associated with this phone as a list of Net::Duo::Admin::User objects.
