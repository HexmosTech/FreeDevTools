</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Chart::Manual::Properties - complete guide to Chart's changeable properties

</pre><h4><b>INTRO</b></h4><pre>
       Individual properties of a chart can be changed via method "set":

           $chart_object-&gt;set( %properties);
           $chart_object-&gt;set( key =&gt; 'value', ... );

       This page documents all viable keys and values for this calls.

       The first section lists the most common data types and their acceptable values.

       Please note that all chart type reacts only to a distinct subset of properties. The section section
       therefore groups all properties by chart type or set of types, where they have an effect. The
       descriptions in this section are shortened to achive a tabular overview.

       A fuller description of each property provides the third section, where they are alpabetically sorted.

       The general layout of a chart image:

</pre><h4><b>DATA</b> <b>TYPES</b></h4><pre>
       Every key expects values of a certain data type. The more often occurring types are sorted, enumerated
       and decibed in this section.

   <b>boolean</b>
       Yes or no decisions you can answer with the perlish 0 or 1 as well as with 'true' or 'false', which might
       be shortened to 't' and 'T' or 'f' and 'F'. 'none' as an alias of 'false' is also an option.

   <b>code</b>
       Anonymous subroutine that usually takes the first argument and returns a transformed result:

           sub { $_[0] + 1 }

   <b>color</b>
       The usual options are:

         names:  'blue'

       All names are tabulated visually and by name under "NAMES" in Chart::Property::DataType::Color::Constant.
       You can also define a color with integer values in the RGB or HSL space.  Acceptable ranges are for RGB:
       3x 0..255 and for  HSL: 0..359, 2 x 0..100.

         RGB triplets: [0,255,255]
         RGB hashes: { Red =&gt;   0,  Green =&gt; 255, Blue =&gt; 255 }
         RGB hashes: { R   =&gt;   0,  G     =&gt; 255, B    =&gt; 255 }
         HSL hashes: { H   =&gt; 240,  S     =&gt; 100, L     =&gt; 50 }
         HSL hashes: { hue =&gt; 240, saturation =&gt; 100, lightness =&gt; 50 }

       Detailed explanation and even more options you find under Graphics::Toolkit::Color.

   <b>font</b>
       There are a handful GD built in font object, than can be referenced:

           GD::Font-&gt;Tiny
           GD::Font-&gt;Small
           GD::Font-&gt;MediumBold
           GD::Font-&gt;Large
           GD::Font-&gt;Giant

   <b>integer</b>
       Whole numbers (without decimals) to set position, size and alike.

   <b>positive</b> <b>integer</b>
       Integers greater or equal zero.

   <b>string</b>
       Short texts for title, sub_title and labels on axis, tics and legend.  Line breaks ("/n") are only
       acceptable inside single quotes and in the "title".

</pre><h4><b>BY</b> <b>CHART</b> <b>TYPE</b></h4><pre>

</pre><h4><b>ALPHABETICALLY</b></h4><pre>
   <b>angle_interval</b>
       "Direction" only: how many radial lines should be drawn.  The default value is 30, which means that a
       line will be drawn every 30 degrees. Valid Values are: 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 45 and 60.  If you choose 0,
       direction will draw no line.

   <b>arrow</b>
       "Direction" only: Bool that if 'true', chart will draw a arrow from the center to the point. Defaults to
       'false'.

   <b>brush_size</b>
       "Lines" only: Integer sets the width of the lines in pixels. Default is 6.

   <b>background</b>
       see "colors"

   <b>brushStyle</b>
       Sets the shape of points for Chart::Points, Chart::LinesPoints.

       Possible values are: 'FilledCircle', 'circle', 'donut', 'OpenCircle', 'fatPlus', 'triangle',
       'upsidedownTriangle', 'square', 'hollowSquare', 'OpenRectangle', 'FilledDiamond', 'OpenDiamond', 'Star',
       'OpenStar'.  Default: 'FilledCircle'. Look at Demo at "Points" in Chart::Manual::Types.

   <b>brush_style1</b>
       "Composite" only: brush style of points associated with left y-axis.

   <b>brush_style2</b>
       "Composite" only: brush style of points associated with right y-axis.

   <b>colors</b>
       The key "colors" is special, because there are a lot of things that need to be colored. That's why its
       value is a hash with keys within, which name what exactly needs to be colored. Their value has to be a
       color definition (name, RGB array ref or HSL hash ref):

           $obj-&gt;set('colors' =&gt; {'background' =&gt; [255,255,255]});

       sets the background color to white (which is the default). Valid keys are:

           'background' (background color for the image)
           'title' (color of the title)
           'text' (all the text in the chart)
           'x_label' (color of the x-axis label)
           'y_label' (color of the first y axis label)
           'y_label2' (color of the second y axis label)
           'grid_lines' (color of the grid lines)
           'x_grid_lines' (color of the x grid lines - for x axis ticks)
           'y_grid_lines' (color of the y grid lines - for to left y axis ticks)
           'y2_grid_lines' (color of the y2 grid lines - for right y axis ticks)
           'dataset0'..'dataset63' (the different datasets)
           'misc' (everything else, ie. axis, ticks, box around the legend)

       NB. For composite charts, there is a limit of 8 datasets per component.  The colors for 'dataset8'
       through 'dataset15' become the colors for 'dataset0' through 'dataset7' for the second component chart.

   <b>composite_info</b>
       "Composite" only: information about which data set gets visualized by which chart type. It should be a
       reference to an array of array references, containing information like the following:

           $obj-&gt;set ('composite_info' =&gt; [ ['Bars', [1,2]],
                            ['Lines', [3,4] ] ]);

       This example would set the two component charts to be a bar chart and a line chart.  It would use the
       first two data sets for the bar chart (note that the numbering starts at 1, not zero like most of the
       other numbered things in Chart), and the second two data sets for the line chart.  The default is undef.

       NB. Chart::Composite can only do two component charts.

   <b>custom_x_ticks</b>
       Used in "Points", "Lines", "Linespoints", "Errorbars", and "Bars" charts. This option allows you to you
       to specify exactly which x-ticks and x-tick labels should be drawn.  It should be assigned a reference to
       an array of desired ticks.  Just remember that I'm counting from the 0th element of the array.  (ie., if
       'custom_x_ticks' is assigned [0,3,4], then the 0th, 3rd, and 4th x-ticks will be displayed)

   <b>datasetx</b>
       see "colors"

   <b>f_x_tick</b>
       Needs a reference to a function ("code") which uses the x-tick labels generated by the '@data[0]' as the
       argument. The result of this function can reformat the labels. For instance

          $obj -&gt; set ('f_x_tick' =&gt; \&amp;formatter );

       An example for the function formatter: x labels are seconds since an event.  The referenced function can
       transform this seconds to hour, minutes and seconds.

   <b>f_y_tick</b>
       The same situation as for 'f_x_tick' but now used for y labels.

   <b>f_y_tick1</b>
       "Composite" only: "code" ref to a function which has one argument and has to return a string which labels
       the first resp. second y axis.  Both default to undef.

   <b>f_y_tick2</b>
       "Composite" only: "code" ref to a function which has one argument and has to return a string which labels
       the first resp. second y axis.  Both default to undef.

   <b>graph_border</b>
       "Pie" only: Sets the number of pixels used as a border between the title/labels and the actual graph
       within the image.  Defaults to 10.

   <b>grey_background</b>
       Puts a nice soft grey background on the data plot area when set to 'true'.  Default is 'true'.

   <b>grid_lines</b>
       bool: draw grid lines matching up to x and y ticks.  Default is 'false'.

   <b>imagemap</b>
       Lets Chart know you're going to ask for information about the placement of the data for use in creating
       an image map from the png.  This information can be retrieved using the <b>imagemap_dump()</b> method.  NB. that
       the <b>imagemap_dump()</b> method cannot be called until after the Chart has been generated.

   <b>include_zero</b>
       If 'true', forces the y-axis to include zero if it is not in the dataset range. Default is 'false'.

       In general, it is better to use this, than to set the "min_val" if that is all you want to achieve.

   <b>integer_ticks_only</b>
       bool specifies to draw the x- and y-ticks at floating point values (as normal) or when set to 'true' only
       at integer values.  Default: 'false'

   <b>interval</b>
       "Split" only: Sets the interval of one partition of plot. Defaults 'undef'.

   <b>interval_ticks</b>
       "Split" only: Number of ticks for the x-axis. Defaults to 5.

   <b>label_font</b>
       This option changes the "font" of the axis labels.  Default is GD::Font-&gt;MediumBold.

   <b>label_values</b>
       "Pie" only: What kind of value labels to show alongside the pie.  Valid values are 'percent', 'value',
       'both' and 'none'.  Defaults to 'percent'.

   <b>legend</b>
       Specifies the placement of the legend.  Valid values are 'left', 'right', 'top', 'bottom'.  Setting this
       to 'none' tells chart not to draw a legend.  Default is 'right'.

   <b>legend_example_size</b>
       "Composite" only: Length of the example line in the legend in pixels.  Defaults to 20.

   <b>legend_font</b>
       This option changes the "font" of the text in the legend.  Default is GD::Font-&gt;Small.

   <b>legend_labels</b>
       Array reference containing texts, which are the labels assigned to each color in the legend. Amount has
       to correspond to the amount of data sets.

         @labels = ('foo', 'bar');
         $obj-&gt;set ('legend_labels' =&gt; \@labels);

       Default is empty, in which case 'Dataset 1', 'Dataset 2', etc. are used as the labels.

   <b>legend_label_values</b>
       "Pie" only: What labels to draw in the legend. Valid values are c&lt;'percent'&gt;, 'value', 'both' and 'none'.
       Defaults to 'value'.

   <b>legend_lines</b>
       "Pie" only: bool to decide if lines connecting pie slices and label are drawn. Default is 'false'.

   <b>label_values</b>
       "Pie" only: Labels to draw beside the pie slices. Valid values are 'percent', 'value', 'both' and 'none'.
       Defaults to 'percent'.

   <b>line</b>
       "Direction" only: If you turn this option to 'true', then point will be connected with lines. Defaults to
       'false'.

   <b>max_circles</b>
       "Direction" only: Sets the maximum number of circles in the coordinate system.  Default is 100. This
       limit is used to avoid plotting  an unreasonable large number of ticks if non-round values are used for
       the min_val and max_val.

   <b>max_val</b>
       Sets the maximum y-value on the graph, overriding the normal auto-scaling.  Default is undef.

   <b>max_val1</b>
       "Composite" only: Maximum y-value for the first (left y-axis) components.  Default to undef.

   <b>max_val2</b>
       "Composite" only: Maximum y-value for the second (right y-axis) components.  Default to undef.

   <b>max_x_ticks</b>
       Work similar as 'max_y_ticks' and 'min_y_ticks'. Of course, only for a xy_plot.

   <b>max_y_ticks</b>
       Sets the maximum number of y_ticks to draw when generating a scale.  Default is 100. This limit is used
       to avoid plotting an unreasonable large number of ticks if non-round values are used for the min_val and
       max_val.

       The value for 'max_y_ticks' should be at least 5 times larger than 'min_y_ticks'.

   <b>min_circles</b>
       "Direction" only: Sets the minimum number of circles when generating a scale for direction. Default is 4,
       minimum is 2.

   <b>min_val</b>
       Sets the minimum y-value on the graph, overriding the normal auto-scaling.  Default is undef.

       Caution: should be used when setting 'max_val' and 'min_val' to floating point or non-round numbers. This
       is because the scale must start &amp; end on a tick, ticks must have round-number intervals, and include
       round numbers.

       Example: Suppose your data set has a range of 35-114 units. If you specify them as the 'min_val' &amp;
       'max_val', the y_axis will be plotted with 80 ticks every 1 unit.. If no 'min_val' &amp; 'max_val', the
       system will auto scale the range to 30-120 with 10 ticks every 10 units.

       If the 'min_val' &amp; 'max_val' are specified to excessive precision, they may be overridden by the system,
       plotting a maximum 'max_y_ticks' ticks.

   <b>min_val1</b>
       "Composite" only: Minimum y-value for the first (left y-axis) component.  Default to undef.

   <b>min_val2</b>
       "Composite" only: Minimum y-value for the second (right y-axis) component.  Default to undef.

   <b>min_x_ticks</b>
       Work similar as 'max_y_ticks' and 'min_y_ticks'. Of course, only for a xy_plot.

   <b>min_y_ticks</b>
       Sets the minimum number of y_ticks to draw when generating a scale.  Default is 6, The minimum is 2.

   <b>no_cache</b>
       Adds Pragma: no-cache to the http header while output for CGI.  Be careful with this one, as Netscape 4.5
       is unfriendly with POST using this method.

   <b>pairs</b>
       Direction only: bool if 'true', Chart uses the first dataset as a set of degrees and the second dataset
       as a set of values.  Then, the third set is a set of degrees and the fourth a set of values ...  If
       'pairs' is set to 'false', Chart uses the first dataset as a set of angels and all following datasets as
       sets of values. Defaults to 'false'.

   <b>png_border</b>
       Sets the number of pixels used as a border between the graph and the edges of the image.  Defaults to 10.

   <b>point</b>
       Indicates to draw points in a direction chart. 'true' or 'false' possible. Defaults to 'true'.

   <b>polar</b>
       "Direction" only: If set 'true', the maximum x value is in the center of the coordinate system. Defaults
       to 'false'.

   <b>precision</b>
       Sets the number of numerals after the decimal point. Affects in most cases the y-axis. But also the
       x-axis if "xy_plot" was set and also the labels in a pie chart. Defaults to 3.

   <b>pt_size</b>
       "Points" and "LinesPoints" only: Sets the radius of the points in pixels.  Default is 18.

   <b>ring</b>
       "Pie" only: sets the "thickness" of the pie, the percentage of the radius, which is visible. Defaults to
       1 (full pie chart).  Good values are between 0.2 and 0.4.

   <b>scale</b>
       "Split" only: Every y-value will be multiplied with that value, but the scale won't change. Which means
       that split allows one to overdraw certain  rows! Only useful if you want to give prominence to the
       maximal amplitudes of the data. Defaults to 1.

   <b>same_error</b>
       "ErrorBars" only: It tells chart that you want use the same error value of a data point if set to 'true'.
       Look at the documentation to see how the module ErrorBars works. Default: 'false'.

   <b>same_y_axes</b>
       "Composite" only: Forces both component charts to use the same maximum and minimum y-values if set to
       'true'.  This helps to keep the composite charts from being too confusing.  Default is "undef".

   <b>skip_int_ticks</b>
       If 'true' the labels and ticks will be drawn every nth tick. Of course in horizontalBars it affects the
       x-axis. Default to 1, no skipping.

   <b>skip_x_ticks</b>
       Sets the number of x-ticks and x-tick labels to skip.  (ie.  if 'skip_x_ticks' was set to 4, Chart would
       draw every 4th x-tick and x-tick label).  Default is "undef".

   <b>skip_y_ticks</b>
       "HorizontalBars" only: Draw only every n'th tick with label on y-axis.  does for other charts. Defaults
       to 1 (draw all).

   <b>sort</b>
       In a xy-plot, the data will be sorted ascending if set to 'true'.  (Should be set if the data isn't
       sorted, especially in Lines, Split and LinesPoints) In a Pareto Chart the data will be sorted descending.
       Defaults to 'false'.

   <b>spaced_bars</b>
       "Bars" only: Leaves space between the groups of bars at each data point when set to 'true'.  This just
       makes it easier to read a bar chart.  Default is 'true'.

   <b>start</b>
       "Split" only: Sets the start value of the first interval.  If the x coordinate of the first data point is
       zero, you should 'set' to zero. Default is 'undef'.

   <b>sub_title</b>
       Write a sub-title under the "title" in smaller letters.  Default is empty.

   <b>text_space</b>
       Sets the amount of space left on the sides (lext and right) of text, (title, legend, label) to make it
       more readable.  Defaults to 2.

   <b>tick_label_font</b>
       This is the font for the tick labels. It also needs a GD font object as an argument. Default is
       GD::Font-&gt;Small.

   <b>tick_len</b>
       Sets the length of the x- and y-ticks in pixels.  Default is 4.

   <b>title</b>
       Content of title text. If empty, no title is drawn.  It recognizes '\n' as a newline, and acts
       accordingly.  Remember, if you want to use normal quotation marks instead of single quotation marks then
       you have to quote "\\n". Default is empty.

   <b>title_font</b>
       This option changes the "font" of the title. Default is GD::Font-&gt;Large.

   <b>transparent</b>
       Makes the background of the whole image transparent if set to 'true'.  Useful for making web page images.
       Default is 'false'.

   <b>x_grid_lines</b>
       Draws vertical grid lines matching up to x ticks if set to 'true'.  Default is 'false'.

   <b>x_label</b>
       Tells Chart what to use for the x-axis label.  If empty, no label is drawn.  Default is empty.

   <b>x_ticks</b>
       Specifies how to draw the x-tick labels.  Valid values are 1: 'normal', 2: 'staggered' (alternating on
       upper and lower row - for very long labels), and 3: 'vertical' (the labels are draw upwards in right
       angle).  Default is 'normal'.

   <b>xy_plot</b>
       Forces Chart to plot a x-y-graph, which means, that the x-axis is also numeric if set to 'true'. Very
       useful for mathematical graphs.  Works for Lines, Points, LinesPoints and ErrorBars. Split makes always a
       xy_plot. Defaults to 'false'.

   <b>y_label</b>
       Tells Chart what to use for labels on the standard, left y-axis.  If empty, no label is drawn.  Default
       is empty ('').

   <b>y_label2</b>
       Text of the label on the second, right y-axis (if different from left).  If empty, no label is drawn.
       Default is empty ('').

   <b>y_axes</b>
       Tells Chart where to place the y-axis. Has no effect on Composite and Pie.  Valid values are 'left',
       'right' and 'both'. Defaults to 'left'.

   <b>y_grid_lines</b>
       Draws horizontal grid lines matching up to y ticks if set to 'true'.  Default is 'false'.

   <b>y_ticks1</b>
       Composite only: number of y ticks to use on the first and second y-axis (y_ticks2).  Please note that if
       you just set the 'y_ticks' option, both axes will use that number of y ticks. Both default to undef.

   <b>y_ticks2</b>
       see "y_ticks1"
