</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Chart - A class for writing Excel Charts.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       To create a simple Excel file with a chart using Excel::Writer::XLSX:

           #!<a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?perl">/usr/bin/perl</a>

           use strict;
           use warnings;
           use Excel::Writer::XLSX;

           my $workbook  = Excel::Writer::XLSX-&gt;new( 'chart.xlsx' );
           my $worksheet = $workbook-&gt;add_worksheet();

           # Add the worksheet data the chart refers to.
           my $data = [
               [ 'Category', 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 ],
               [ 'Value',    1, 4, 5, 2, 1, 5 ],

           ];

           $worksheet-&gt;write( 'A1', $data );

           # Add a worksheet chart.
           my $chart = $workbook-&gt;add_chart( type =&gt; 'column' );

           # Configure the chart.
           $chart-&gt;add_series(
               categories =&gt; '=Sheet1!$A$2:$A$7',
               values     =&gt; '=Sheet1!$B$2:$B$7',
           );

           $workbook-&gt;close();

           __END__

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The "Chart" module is an abstract base class for modules that implement charts in Excel::Writer::XLSX.
       The information below is applicable to all of the available subclasses.

       The "Chart" module isn't used directly. A chart object is created via the Workbook "add_chart()" method
       where the chart type is specified:

           my $chart = $workbook-&gt;add_chart( type =&gt; 'column' );

       Currently the supported chart types are:

       •   "area"

           Creates an Area (filled line) style chart. See Excel::Writer::XLSX::Chart::Area.

       •   "bar"

           Creates a Bar style (transposed histogram) chart. See Excel::Writer::XLSX::Chart::Bar.

       •   "column"

           Creates a column style (histogram) chart. See Excel::Writer::XLSX::Chart::Column.

       •   "line"

           Creates a Line style chart. See Excel::Writer::XLSX::Chart::Line.

       •   "pie"

           Creates a Pie style chart. See Excel::Writer::XLSX::Chart::Pie.

       •   "doughnut"

           Creates a Doughnut style chart. See Excel::Writer::XLSX::Chart::Doughnut.

       •   "scatter"

           Creates a Scatter style chart. See Excel::Writer::XLSX::Chart::Scatter.

       •   "stock"

           Creates a Stock style chart. See Excel::Writer::XLSX::Chart::Stock.

       •   "radar"

           Creates a Radar style chart. See Excel::Writer::XLSX::Chart::Radar.

       Chart subtypes are also supported in some cases:

           $workbook-&gt;add_chart( type =&gt; 'bar', subtype =&gt; 'stacked' );

       The currently available subtypes are:

           area
               stacked
               percent_stacked

           bar
               stacked
               percent_stacked

           column
               stacked
               percent_stacked

           scatter
               straight_with_markers
               straight
               smooth_with_markers
               smooth

           line
               stacked
               percent_stacked

           radar
               with_markers
               filled

</pre><h4><b>CHART</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       Methods  that  are  common to all chart types are documented below. See the documentation for each of the
       above chart modules for chart specific information.

   <b>add_series()</b>
       In an Excel chart a "series" is a collection of information  such  as  values,  X  axis  labels  and  the
       formatting that define which data is plotted.

       With  an  Excel::Writer::XLSX  chart object the "add_series()" method is used to set the properties for a
       series:

           $chart-&gt;add_series(
               categories =&gt; '=Sheet1!$A$2:$A$10', # Optional.
               values     =&gt; '=Sheet1!$B$2:$B$10', # Required.
               line       =&gt; { color =&gt; 'blue' },
           );

       The properties that can be set are:

       •   "values"

           This is the most important property of a series and must be set for every chart object. It links  the
           chart  with  the  worksheet  data  that  it displays. A formula or array ref can be used for the data
           range, see below.

       •   "categories"

           This sets the chart category labels. The category is more or less the same as the  X  axis.  In  most
           chart  types the "categories" property is optional and the chart will just assume a sequential series
           from "1 .. n".

       •   "name"

           Set the name for the series. The name is displayed in the chart legend and in the  formula  bar.  The
           name property is optional and if it isn't supplied it will default to "Series 1 .. n".

       •   "line"

           Set  the  properties  of  the  series  line type such as colour and width. See the "CHART FORMATTING"
           section below.

       •   "border"

           Set the border properties of the series such as colour and style. See the "CHART FORMATTING"  section
           below.

       •   "fill"

           Set the fill properties of the series such as colour. See the "CHART FORMATTING" section below.

       •   "pattern"

           Set the pattern properties of the series. See the "CHART FORMATTING" section below.

       •   "gradient"

           Set the gradient properties of the series. See the "CHART FORMATTING" section below.

       •   "marker"

           Set  the  properties  of the series marker such as style and colour. See the "SERIES OPTIONS" section
           below.

       •   "trendline"

           Set the properties of the series trendline such as linear, polynomial and moving average  types.  See
           the "SERIES OPTIONS" section below.

       •   "smooth"

           The  "smooth"  option  is  used to set the smooth property of a line series. See the "SERIES OPTIONS"
           section below.

       •   "y_error_bars"

           Set vertical error bounds for a chart series. See the "SERIES OPTIONS" section below.

       •   "x_error_bars"

           Set horizontal error bounds for a chart series. See the "SERIES OPTIONS" section below.

       •   "data_labels"

           Set data labels for the series. See the "SERIES OPTIONS" section below.

       •   "points"

           Set properties for individual points in a series. See the "SERIES OPTIONS" section below.

       •   "invert_if_negative"

           Invert the fill colour for negative values. Usually only applicable to column and bar charts.

       •   "overlap"

           Set the overlap between series in a Bar/Column chart. The range is +/- 100. Default is 0.

               overlap =&gt; 20,

           Note, it is only necessary to apply this property to one series of the chart.

       •   "gap"

           Set the gap between series in a Bar/Column chart. The range is 0 to 500. Default is 150.

               gap =&gt; 200,

           Note, it is only necessary to apply this property to one series of the chart.

       The "categories" and "values" can take either a  range  formula  such  as  "=Sheet1!$A$2:$A$7"  or,  more
       usefully when generating the range programmatically, an array ref with zero indexed row/column values:

            [ $sheetname, $row_start, $row_end, $col_start, $col_end ]

       The following are equivalent:

           $chart-&gt;add_series( categories =&gt; '=Sheet1!$A$2:$A$7'      ); # Same as ...
           $chart-&gt;add_series( categories =&gt; [ 'Sheet1', 1, 6, 0, 0 ] ); # Zero-indexed.

       You  can  add  more than one series to a chart. In fact, some chart types such as "stock" require it. The
       series numbering and order in the Excel chart will be the same as the order in which they  are  added  in
       Excel::Writer::XLSX.

           # Add the first series.
           $chart-&gt;add_series(
               categories =&gt; '=Sheet1!$A$2:$A$7',
               values     =&gt; '=Sheet1!$B$2:$B$7',
               name       =&gt; 'Test data series 1',
           );

           # Add another series. Same categories. Different range values.
           $chart-&gt;add_series(
               categories =&gt; '=Sheet1!$A$2:$A$7',
               values     =&gt; '=Sheet1!$C$2:$C$7',
               name       =&gt; 'Test data series 2',
           );

       It is also possible to specify non-contiguous ranges:

           $chart-&gt;add_series(
               categories      =&gt; '=(Sheet1!$A$1:$A$9,Sheet1!$A$14:$A$25)',
               values          =&gt; '=(Sheet1!$B$1:$B$9,Sheet1!$B$14:$B$25)',
           );

   <b>set_x_axis()</b>
       The "set_x_axis()" method is used to set properties of the X axis.

           $chart-&gt;set_x_axis( name =&gt; 'Quarterly results' );

       The properties that can be set are:

           name
           name_font
           name_layout
           num_font
           num_format
           line
           fill
           pattern
           gradient
           min
           max
           minor_unit
           major_unit
           interval_unit
           interval_tick
           crossing
           reverse
           position_axis
           log_base
           label_position
           major_gridlines
           minor_gridlines
           visible
           date_axis
           text_axis
           minor_unit_type
           major_unit_type
           minor_tick_mark
           major_tick_mark
           display_units
           display_units_visible

       These  are  explained below. Some properties are only applicable to value or category axes, as indicated.
       See "Value and Category Axes" for an explanation of Excel's distinction between the axis types.

       •   "name"

           Set the name (title or caption) for the axis. The name is displayed below  the  X  axis.  The  "name"
           property is optional. The default is to have no axis name. (Applicable to category and value axes).

               $chart-&gt;set_x_axis( name =&gt; 'Quarterly results' );

           The name can also be a formula such as "=Sheet1!$A$1".

       •   "name_font"

           Set the font properties for the axis title. (Applicable to category and value axes).

               $chart-&gt;set_x_axis( name_font =&gt; { name =&gt; 'Arial', size =&gt; 10 } );

       •   "name_layout"

           Set  the  "(x,  y)" position of the axis caption in chart relative units. (Applicable to category and
           value axes).

               $chart-&gt;set_x_axis(
                   name        =&gt; 'X axis',
                   name_layout =&gt; {
                       x =&gt; 0.34,
                       y =&gt; 0.85,
                   }
               );

           See the "CHART LAYOUT" section below.

       •   "num_font"

           Set the font properties for the axis numbers. (Applicable to category and value axes).

               $chart-&gt;set_x_axis( num_font =&gt; { bold =&gt; 1, italic =&gt; 1 } );

           See the "CHART FONTS" section below.

       •   "num_format"

           Set the number format for the axis. (Applicable to category and value axes).

               $chart-&gt;set_x_axis( num_format =&gt; '#,##0.00' );
               $chart-&gt;set_y_axis( num_format =&gt; '0.00%'    );

           The number format is similar to the Worksheet Cell Format "num_format" apart from  the  fact  that  a
           format  index  cannot  be  used.  The  explicit  format  string  must  be  used  as  shown above. See
           "<b>set_num_format()</b>" in Excel::Writer::XLSX for more information.

       •   "line"

           Set the properties of the axis line type such as colour and width. See the "CHART FORMATTING" section
           below.

               $chart-&gt;set_x_axis( line =&gt; { none =&gt; 1 });

       •   "fill"

           Set the fill properties of the axis such as colour. See the "CHART FORMATTING" section  below.  Note,
           in  Excel  the axis fill is applied to the area of the numbers of the axis and not to the area of the
           axis bounding box. That background is set from the chartarea fill.

       •   "pattern"

           Set the pattern properties of the axis such as colour. See the "CHART FORMATTING" section below.

       •   "gradient"

           Set the gradient properties of the axis such as colour. See the "CHART FORMATTING" section below.

       •   "min"

           Set the minimum value for the axis range. (Applicable to value axes only.)

               $chart-&gt;set_x_axis( min =&gt; 20 );

       •   "max"

           Set the maximum value for the axis range. (Applicable to value axes only.)

               $chart-&gt;set_x_axis( max =&gt; 80 );

       •   "minor_unit"

           Set the increment of the minor units in the axis range. (Applicable to value axes only.)

               $chart-&gt;set_x_axis( minor_unit =&gt; 0.4 );

       •   "major_unit"

           Set the increment of the major units in the axis range. (Applicable to value axes only.)

               $chart-&gt;set_x_axis( major_unit =&gt; 2 );

       •   "interval_unit"

           Set the interval unit for a category axis. (Applicable to category axes only.)

               $chart-&gt;set_x_axis( interval_unit =&gt; 2 );

       •   "interval_tick"

           Set the tick interval for a category axis. (Applicable to category axes only.)

               $chart-&gt;set_x_axis( interval_tick =&gt; 4 );

       •   "crossing"

           Set the position where the y axis will cross the x axis. (Applicable to category and value axes.)

           The "crossing" value can either be a numeric value or the strings 'max' or 'min' to set the  crossing
           at the maximum/minimum axis value.

               $chart-&gt;set_x_axis( crossing =&gt; 3 );
               # or
               $chart-&gt;set_x_axis( crossing =&gt; 'max' );

           <b>For</b> <b>category</b> <b>axes</b> <b>the</b> <b>numeric</b> <b>value</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>integer</b> to represent the category number that the axis
           crosses at. For value axes it can have any value associated with the axis.

           If  crossing  is  omitted  (the default) the crossing will be set automatically by Excel based on the
           chart data.

       •   "position_axis"

           Position the axis on or between the axis tick marks. (Applicable to category axes only.)

           There are two allowable values "on_tick" and "between":

               $chart-&gt;set_x_axis( position_axis =&gt; 'on_tick' );
               $chart-&gt;set_x_axis( position_axis =&gt; 'between' );

       •   "reverse"

           Reverse the order of the axis categories or values. (Applicable to category and value axes.)

               $chart-&gt;set_x_axis( reverse =&gt; 1 );

       •   "log_base"

           Set the log base of the axis range. (Applicable to value axes only.)

               $chart-&gt;set_x_axis( log_base =&gt; 10 );

       •   "label_position"

           Set the "Axis labels" position for the axis. The following positions are available:

               next_to (the default)
               high
               low
               none

       •   "major_gridlines"

           Configure the major gridlines for the axis. The available properties are:

               visible
               line

           For example:

               $chart-&gt;set_x_axis(
                   major_gridlines =&gt; {
                       visible =&gt; 1,
                       line    =&gt; { color =&gt; 'red', width =&gt; 1.25, dash_type =&gt; 'dash' }
                   }
               );

           The "visible" property is usually on for the X-axis but it depends on the type of chart.

           The "line" property sets the gridline properties such as colour and width. See the "CHART FORMATTING"
           section below.

       •   "minor_gridlines"

           This takes the same options as "major_gridlines" above.

           The minor gridline "visible" property is off by default for all chart types.

       •   "visible"

           Configure the visibility of the axis.

               $chart-&gt;set_x_axis( visible =&gt; 0 );

       •   "date_axis"

           This option is used to treat a category axis with date or time data as a Date  Axis.  (Applicable  to
           category axes only.)

               $chart-&gt;set_x_axis( date_axis =&gt; 1 );

           This  option also allows you to set "max" and "min" values for a category axis which isn't allowed by
           Excel for non-date category axes.

           See "Date Category Axes" for more details.

       •   "text_axis"

           This option is used to treat a category axis explicitly as a Text Axis. (Applicable to category  axes
           only.)

               $chart-&gt;set_x_axis( text_axis =&gt; 1 );

       •   "minor_unit_type"

           For  "date_axis" axes, see above, this option is used to set the type of the minor units. (Applicable
           to date category axes only.)

               $chart-&gt;set_x_axis(
                   date_axis         =&gt; 1,
                   minor_unit        =&gt; 4,
                   minor_unit_type   =&gt; 'months',
               );

           The allowable values for this option are "days", "months" and "years".

       •   "major_unit_type"

           Same as "minor_unit_type", see above, but for major axes unit types.

           More than one property can be set in a call to "set_x_axis()":

               $chart-&gt;set_x_axis(
                   name =&gt; 'Quarterly results',
                   min  =&gt; 10,
                   max  =&gt; 80,
               );

       •   "major_tick_mark"

           Set the axis major tick mark type to one of the following values:

               none
               inside
               outside
               cross   (inside and outside)

           For example:

               $chart-&gt;set_x_axis( major_tick_mark =&gt; 'none',
                                   minor_tick_mark =&gt; 'inside' );

       •   "minor_tick_mark"

           Set the axis minor tick mark type. Same as "major_tick_mark", see above.

       •   "display_units"

           Set the display units for the axis. This can be useful if the axis numbers are  very  large  but  you
           don't  want  to represent them in scientific notation. (Applicable to value axes only.) The available
           display units are:

               hundreds
               thousands
               ten_thousands
               hundred_thousands
               millions
               ten_millions
               hundred_millions
               billions
               trillions

           Example:

               $chart-&gt;set_x_axis( display_units =&gt; 'thousands' )
               $chart-&gt;set_y_axis( display_units =&gt; 'millions' )

           * "display_units_visible"

           Control the visibility of the display units turned on by the previous option. This option  is  on  by
           default. (Applicable to value axes only.)::

               $chart-&gt;set_x_axis( display_units         =&gt; 'thousands',
                                   display_units_visible =&gt; 0 )

   <b>set_y_axis()</b>
       The "set_y_axis()" method is used to set properties of the Y axis. The properties that can be set are the
       same as for "set_x_axis", see above.

   <b>set_x2_axis()</b>
       The "set_x2_axis()" method is used to set properties of the secondary X axis.  The properties that can be
       set are the same as for "set_x_axis", see above.  The default properties for this axis are:

           label_position =&gt; 'none',
           crossing       =&gt; 'max',
           visible        =&gt; 0,

   <b>set_y2_axis()</b>
       The "set_y2_axis()" method is used to set properties of the secondary Y axis.  The properties that can be
       set are the same as for "set_x_axis", see above.  The default properties for this axis are:

           major_gridlines =&gt; { visible =&gt; 0 }

   <b>combine()</b>
       The  chart  "combine()" method is used to combine two charts of different types, for example a column and
       line chart:

           my $column_chart = $workbook-&gt;add_chart( type =&gt; 'column', embedded =&gt; 1 );

           # Configure the data series for the primary chart.
           $column_chart-&gt;add_series(...);

           # Create a new column chart. This will use this as the secondary chart.
           my $line_chart = $workbook-&gt;add_chart( type =&gt; 'line', embedded =&gt; 1 );

           # Configure the data series for the secondary chart.
           $line_chart-&gt;add_series(...);

           # Combine the charts.
           $column_chart-&gt;combine( $line_chart );

       See "Combined Charts" for more details.

   <b>set_size()</b>
       The "set_size()" method is used to set the dimensions of the chart. The size properties that can  be  set
       are:

            width
            height
            x_scale
            y_scale
            x_offset
            y_offset

       The  "width"  and "height" are in pixels. The default chart width is 480 pixels and the default height is
       288 pixels. The size of the chart can be modified by setting the "width" and "height" or by  setting  the
       "x_scale" and "y_scale":

           $chart-&gt;set_size( width =&gt; 720, height =&gt; 576 );

           # Same as:

           $chart-&gt;set_size( x_scale =&gt; 1.5, y_scale =&gt; 2 );

       The  "x_offset"  and "y_offset" position the top left corner of the chart in the cell that it is inserted
       into.

       Note:  the  "x_scale",  "y_scale",  "x_offset"  and  "y_offset"  parameters  can  also  be  set  via  the
       "insert_chart()" method:

           $worksheet-&gt;insert_chart( 'E2', $chart, { x_offset =&gt;2,    y_offset =&gt; 4,
                                                     x_scale  =&gt; 1.5, y_scale  =&gt; 2 } );

   <b>set_title()</b>
       The "set_title()" method is used to set properties of the chart title.

           $chart-&gt;set_title( name =&gt; 'Year End Results' );

       The properties that can be set are:

       •   "name"

           Set  the  name  (title)  for the chart. The name is displayed above the chart. The name can also be a
           formula such as "=Sheet1!$A$1". The name property is optional. The default is to have no chart title.

       •   "name_font"

           Set the font properties for the chart title. See the "CHART FONTS" section below.

       •   "overlay"

           Allow the title to be overlaid on the chart. Generally used with the layout property below.

       •   "layout"

           Set the "(x, y)" position of the title in chart relative units:

               $chart-&gt;set_title(
                   name    =&gt; 'Title',
                   overlay =&gt; 1,
                   layout  =&gt; {
                       x =&gt; 0.42,
                       y =&gt; 0.14,
                   }
               );

           See the "CHART LAYOUT" section below.

       •   "none"

           By default Excel adds an automatic chart title to charts with a single  series  and  a  user  defined
           series  name.  The  "none"  option  turns  this  default  title  off.  It  also  turns  off all other
           "set_title()" options.

               $chart-&gt;set_title( none =&gt; 1 );

   <b>set_legend()</b>
       The "set_legend()" method is used to set properties of the chart legend.

       The properties that can be set are:

       •   "none"

           The "none" option turns off the chart legend. In Excel chart legends are on by default:

               $chart-&gt;set_legend( none =&gt; 1 );

           Note, for backward compatibility, it is also possible to turn  off  the  legend  via  the  "position"
           property:

               $chart-&gt;set_legend( position =&gt; 'none' );

       •   "position"

           Set the position of the chart legend.

               $chart-&gt;set_legend( position =&gt; 'bottom' );

           The default legend position is "right". The available positions are:

               top
               bottom
               left
               right
               top_right
               overlay_left
               overlay_right
               overlay_top_right
               none

       •   "border"

       •   "gradient"

           Set the gradient fill properties of the legend. See the "CHART FORMATTING" section below.

       •   "font"

           Set the font properties of the chart legend:

               $chart-&gt;set_legend( font =&gt; { bold =&gt; 1, italic =&gt; 1 } );

           See the "CHART FONTS" section below.

       •   "delete_series"

           This allows you to remove 1 or more series from the legend (the series  will  still  display  on  the
           chart). This property takes an array ref as an argument and the series are zero indexed:

               # Delete/hide series index 0 and 2 from the legend.
               $chart-&gt;set_legend( delete_series =&gt; [0, 2] );

       •   "layout"

           Set the "(x, y)" position of the legend in chart relative units:

               $chart-&gt;set_legend(
                   layout =&gt; {
                       x      =&gt; 0.80,
                       y      =&gt; 0.37,

                   }
               );

           See the "CHART LAYOUT" section below.

   <b>set_chartarea()</b>
       The "set_chartarea()" method is used to set the properties of the chart area.

           $chart-&gt;set_chartarea(
               border =&gt; { none  =&gt; 1 },
               fill   =&gt; { color =&gt; 'red' }

       Display data in hidden rows or columns on the chart.

           $chart-&gt;show_hidden_data();

</pre><h4><b>SERIES</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       This section details the following properties of "add_series()" in more detail:

           marker
           trendline
           y_error_bars
           x_error_bars
           data_labels
           points
           smooth

   <b>Marker</b>
       The  marker  format  specifies  the  properties  of the markers used to distinguish series on a chart. In
       general only Line and Scatter chart types and trendlines use markers.

       The following properties can be set for "marker" formats in a chart.

           type
           size
           border
           fill
           pattern
           gradient

       The "type" property sets the type of marker that is used with a series.

           $chart-&gt;add_series(
               values     =&gt; '=Sheet1!$B$1:$B$5',
               marker     =&gt; { type =&gt; 'diamond' },
           );

       The following "type" properties can be set for "marker" formats in a chart. These are shown in  the  same
       order as in the Excel format dialog.

           automatic
           none
           square
           diamond
           triangle
           x
           star
           short_dash
           long_dash
           circle
           plus

       The  "automatic"  type  is  a special case which turns on a marker using the default marker style for the
       particular series number.

           $chart-&gt;add_series(
               values     =&gt; '=Sheet1!$B$1:$B$5',
               marker     =&gt; { type =&gt; 'automatic' },
           );

       If "automatic" is on then other marker properties such as size, border or fill cannot be set.

       The "size" property sets the size of the marker and is generally used in conjunction with "type".

           $chart-&gt;add_series(
               values     =&gt; '=Sheet1!$B$1:$B$5',
               marker     =&gt; { type =&gt; 'diamond', size =&gt; 7 },
           );

       Nested "border" and "fill" properties can also be set for a marker. See the  "CHART  FORMATTING"  section
       below.

           $chart-&gt;add_series(
               values     =&gt; '=Sheet1!$B$1:$B$5',
               marker     =&gt; {
                   type    =&gt; 'square',
                   size    =&gt; 5,
                   border  =&gt; { color =&gt; 'red' },
                   fill    =&gt; { color =&gt; 'yellow' },
               },
           );

   <b>Trendline</b>
       A  trendline  can be added to a chart series to indicate trends in the data such as a moving average or a
       polynomial fit.

       The following properties can be set for trendlines in a chart series.

           type
           order               (for polynomial trends)
           period              (for moving average)
           forward             (for all except moving average)
           backward            (for all except moving average)
           name
           line
           intercept           (for exponential, linear and polynomial only)
           display_equation    (for all except moving average)
           display_r_squared   (for all except moving average)

       The "type" property sets the type of trendline in the series.

           $chart-&gt;add_series(
               values     =&gt; '=Sheet1!$B$1:$B$5',
               trendline  =&gt; { type =&gt; 'linear' },
           );

       The available "trendline" types are:

           exponential
           linear
           log
           moving_average
           polynomial
           power

       A "polynomial" trendline can also specify the "order" of the polynomial. The default value is 2.

           $chart-&gt;add_series(
               values    =&gt; '=Sheet1!$B$1:$B$5',
               trendline =&gt; {
                   type  =&gt; 'polynomial',
                   order =&gt; 3,
               },
           );

       A "moving_average" trendline can also specify the "period" of the moving average. The default value is 2.

           $chart-&gt;add_series(
               values     =&gt; '=Sheet1!$B$1:$B$5',
               trendline  =&gt; {
                   type   =&gt; 'moving_average',
                   period =&gt; 3,
               },
           );

       The "forward" and "backward" properties set the forecast period of the trendline.

           $chart-&gt;add_series(
               values    =&gt; '=Sheet1!$B$1:$B$5',
               trendline =&gt; {
                   type     =&gt; 'linear',
                   forward  =&gt; 0.5,
                   backward =&gt; 0.5,
               },
           );

       The "name" property sets an optional name for the trendline that will appear in the chart legend.  If  it
       isn't  specified the Excel default name will be displayed. This is usually a combination of the trendline
       type and the series name.

           $chart-&gt;add_series(
               values    =&gt; '=Sheet1!$B$1:$B$5',
               trendline =&gt; {
                   type =&gt; 'linear',
                   name =&gt; 'Interpolated trend',
               },
           );

       The "intercept" property sets the point where the trendline crosses the Y (value) axis:

           $chart-&gt;add_series(
               values    =&gt; '=Sheet1!$B$1:$B$5',
               trendline =&gt; {
                   type      =&gt; 'linear',
                   intercept =&gt; 0.8,
               },
           );

       The "display_equation" property displays the trendline equation on the chart.

           $chart-&gt;add_series(
               values    =&gt; '=Sheet1!$B$1:$B$5',
               trendline =&gt; {
                   type             =&gt; 'linear',
                   display_equation =&gt; 1,
               },
           );

       The "display_r_squared" property displays the R squared value of the trendline on the chart.

           $chart-&gt;add_series(
               values    =&gt; '=Sheet1!$B$1:$B$5',
               trendline =&gt; {
                   type              =&gt; 'linear',
                   display_r_squared =&gt; 1
               },
           );

       Several of these properties can be set in one go:

           $chart-&gt;add_series(
               values     =&gt; '=Sheet1!$B$1:$B$5',
               trendline  =&gt; {
                   type              =&gt; 'polynomial',
                   name              =&gt; 'My trend name',
                   order             =&gt; 2,
                   forward           =&gt; 0.5,
                   backward          =&gt; 0.5,
                   intercept         =&gt; 1.5,
                   display_equation  =&gt; 1,
                   display_r_squared =&gt; 1,
                   line              =&gt; {
                       color     =&gt; 'red',
                       width     =&gt; 1,
                       dash_type =&gt; 'long_dash',
                   }
               },
           );

       Trendlines cannot be added to series in a stacked chart or pie chart,  radar  chart,  doughnut  or  (when
       implemented) to 3D, or surface charts.

   <b>Error</b> <b>Bars</b>
       Error  bars  can  be  added to a chart series to indicate error bounds in the data. The error bars can be
       vertical "y_error_bars" (the most common type) or horizontal "x_error_bars" (for Bar and  Scatter  charts
       only).

       The following properties can be set for error bars in a chart series.

           type
           value        (for all types except standard error and custom)
           plus_values  (for custom only)
           minus_values (for custom only)
           direction
           end_style
           line

       The "type" property sets the type of error bars in the series.

           $chart-&gt;add_series(
               values       =&gt; '=Sheet1!$B$1:$B$5',
               y_error_bars =&gt; { type =&gt; 'standard_error' },
           );

       The available error bars types are available:

           fixed
           percentage
           standard_deviation
           standard_error
           custom

       All  error  bar types, except for "standard_error" and "custom" must also have a value associated with it
       for the error bounds:

           $chart-&gt;add_series(
               values       =&gt; '=Sheet1!$B$1:$B$5',
               y_error_bars =&gt; {
                   type  =&gt; 'percentage',
                   value =&gt; 5,
               },
           );

       The "custom" error bar type must specify "plus_values"  and  "minus_values"  which  should  either  by  a
       "Sheet1!$A$1:$A$5" type range formula or an arrayref of values:

           $chart-&gt;add_series(
               categories   =&gt; '=Sheet1!$A$1:$A$5',
               values       =&gt; '=Sheet1!$B$1:$B$5',
               y_error_bars =&gt; {
                   type         =&gt; 'custom',
                   plus_values  =&gt; '=Sheet1!$C$1:$C$5',
                   minus_values =&gt; '=Sheet1!$D$1:$D$5',
               },
           );

           # or

           $chart-&gt;add_series(
               categories   =&gt; '=Sheet1!$A$1:$A$5',
               values       =&gt; '=Sheet1!$B$1:$B$5',
               y_error_bars =&gt; {
                   type         =&gt; 'custom',
                   plus_values  =&gt; [1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
                   minus_values =&gt; [2, 2, 2, 2, 2],
               },
           );

       Note, as in Excel the items in the "minus_values" do not need to be negative.

       The "direction" property sets the direction of the error bars. It should be one of the following:

           plus    # Positive direction only.
           minus   # Negative direction only.
           both    # Plus and minus directions, The default.

       The  "end_style"  property  sets the style of the error bar end cap. The options are 1 (the default) or 0
       (for no end cap):

           $chart-&gt;add_series(
               values       =&gt; '=Sheet1!$B$1:$B$5',
               y_error_bars =&gt; {
                   type      =&gt; 'fixed',
                   value     =&gt; 2,
                   end_style =&gt; 0,
                   direction =&gt; 'minus'
               },
           );

   <b>Data</b> <b>Labels</b>
       Data labels can be added to a chart series to indicate the values of the plotted data points.

       The following properties can be set for "data_labels" formats in a chart.

           value
           category
           series_name
           position
           percentage
           leader_lines
           separator
           legend_key
           num_format
           font
           border
           fill
           pattern
           gradient
           custom

       The "value" property turns on the <u>Value</u> data label for a series.

           $chart-&gt;add_series(
               values      =&gt; '=Sheet1!$B$1:$B$5',
               data_labels =&gt; { value =&gt; 1 },
           );

       The "category" property turns on the <u>Category</u> <u>Name</u> data label for a series.

           $chart-&gt;add_series(
               values      =&gt; '=Sheet1!$B$1:$B$5',
               data_labels =&gt; { category =&gt; 1 },
           );

       The "series_name" property turns on the <u>Series</u> <u>Name</u> data label for a series.

           $chart-&gt;add_series(
               values      =&gt; '=Sheet1!$B$1:$B$5',
               data_labels =&gt; { series_name =&gt; 1 },
           );

       The "position" property is used to position the data label for a series.

           $chart-&gt;add_series(
               values      =&gt; '=Sheet1!$B$1:$B$5',
               data_labels =&gt; { value =&gt; 1, position =&gt; 'center' },
           );

       In Excel the data label positions vary for different chart types. The allowable positions are:

           |  Position     |  Line     |  Bar      |  Pie      |  Area     |
           |               |  Scatter  |  Column   |  Doughnut |  Radar    |
           |               |  Stock    |           |           |           |
           |---------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
           |  center       |  Yes      |  Yes      |  Yes      |  Yes*     |
           |  right        |  Yes*     |           |           |           |
           |  left         |  Yes      |           |           |           |
           |  above        |  Yes      |           |           |           |
           |  below        |  Yes      |           |           |           |
           |  inside_base  |           |  Yes      |           |           |
           |  inside_end   |           |  Yes      |  Yes      |           |
           |  outside_end  |           |  Yes*     |  Yes      |           |
           |  best_fit     |           |           |  Yes*     |           |

       Note: The * indicates the default position for each chart type in Excel, if a position isn't specified.

       The "percentage" property is used to turn on the display of data labels as a <u>Percentage</u> for a series.  It
       is mainly used for pie and doughnut charts.

           $chart-&gt;add_series(
               values      =&gt; '=Sheet1!$B$1:$B$5',
               data_labels =&gt; { percentage =&gt; 1 },
           );

       The  "leader_lines"  property  is  used  to  turn on  <u>Leader</u> <u>Lines</u> for the data label for a series. It is
       mainly used for pie charts.

           $chart-&gt;add_series(
               values      =&gt; '=Sheet1!$B$1:$B$5',
               data_labels =&gt; { value =&gt; 1, leader_lines =&gt; 1 },
           );

       Note:  Even  when  leader  lines  are  turned  on  they  aren't  automatically  visible   in   Excel   or
       Excel::Writer::XLSX. Due to an Excel limitation (or design) leader lines only appear if the data label is
       moved manually or if the data labels are very close and need to be adjusted automatically.

       The "separator" property is used to change the separator between multiple data label items:

           $chart-&gt;add_series(
               values      =&gt; '=Sheet1!$B$1:$B$5',
               data_labels =&gt; { percentage =&gt; 1 },
               data_labels =&gt; { value =&gt; 1, category =&gt; 1, separator =&gt; "\n" },
           );

       The separator value must be one of the following strings:

                   ','
                   ';'
                   '.'
                   "\n"
                   ' '

       The "legend_key" property is used to turn on  <u>Legend</u> <u>Key</u> for the data label for a series:

           $chart-&gt;add_series(
               values      =&gt; '=Sheet1!$B$1:$B$5',
               data_labels =&gt; { value =&gt; 1, legend_key =&gt; 1 },
           );

       The "num_format" property is used to set the number format for the data labels.

           $chart-&gt;add_series(
               values      =&gt; '=Sheet1!$A$1:$A$5',
               data_labels =&gt; { value =&gt; 1, num_format =&gt; '#,##0.00' },
           );

       The  number format is similar to the Worksheet Cell Format "num_format" apart from the fact that a format
       index cannot be used. The explicit format string must be used as shown above. See  "<b>set_num_format()</b>"  in
       Excel::Writer::XLSX for more information.

       The "font" property is used to set the font properties of the data labels in a series:

           $chart-&gt;add_series(
               values      =&gt; '=Sheet1!$A$1:$A$5',
               data_labels =&gt; {
                   value =&gt; 1,
                   font  =&gt; { name =&gt; 'Consolas' }
               },
           );

       The "font" property is also used to rotate the data labels in a series:

           $chart-&gt;add_series(
               values      =&gt; '=Sheet1!$A$1:$A$5',
               data_labels =&gt; {
                   value =&gt; 1,
                   font  =&gt; { rotation =&gt; 45 }
               },
           );

       See the "CHART FONTS" section below.

       The  "border"  property  sets  the border properties of the data labels such as colour and style. See the
       "CHART FORMATTING" section below.

       The "fill" property sets the fill  properties  of  the  data  labels  such  as  colour.  See  the  "CHART
       FORMATTING" section below.

       Example of setting data label formatting:

           $chart-&gt;add_series(
               categories =&gt; '=Sheet1!$A$2:$A$7',
               values     =&gt; '=Sheet1!$B$2:$B$7',
               data_labels =&gt; { value  =&gt; 1,
                                border =&gt; {color =&gt; 'red'},
                                fill   =&gt; {color =&gt; 'yellow'} },
           );

       The "pattern" property sets the pattern properties of the data labels. See the "CHART FORMATTING" section
       below.

       The  "gradient"  property  sets  the  gradient  properties of the data labels. See the "CHART FORMATTING"
       section below.

       The "custom" property is used to set the properties of individual data labels, see below.

   <b>Custom</b> <b>Data</b> <b>Labels</b>
       The "custom" property data label property is used to set the properties of individual data  labels  in  a
       series. The most common use for this is to set custom text or number labels:

           my $custom_labels = [
               { value =&gt; 'Jan' },
               { value =&gt; 'Feb' },
               { value =&gt; 'Mar' },
               { value =&gt; 'Apr' },
               { value =&gt; 'May' },
               { value =&gt; 'Jun' },
           ];

           $chart-&gt;add_series(
               categories =&gt; '=Sheet1!$A$2:$A$7',
               values     =&gt; '=Sheet1!$B$2:$B$7',
               data_labels =&gt; { value =&gt; 1, custom =&gt; $custom_labels },
           );

       As  shown in the previous examples th "custom" property should be a list of dicts. Any property dict that
       is set to "undef" or not included in the list will be assigned the default data label value:

           my $custom_labels = [
               undef,
               { value =&gt; 'Feb' },
               { value =&gt; 'Mar' },
               { value =&gt; 'Apr' },
           ];

       The  property  elements  of  the  "custom"  lists  should  be  dicts   with   the   following   allowable
       keys/sub-properties:

           value
           font
           border
           fill
           pattern
           gradient
           delete

       The  "value"  property  should be a string, number or formula string that refers to a cell from which the
       value will be taken:

           $custom_labels = [
               { value =&gt; '=Sheet1!$C$2' },
               { value =&gt; '=Sheet1!$C$3' },
               { value =&gt; '=Sheet1!$C$4' },
               { value =&gt; '=Sheet1!$C$5' },
               { value =&gt; '=Sheet1!$C$6' },
               { value =&gt; '=Sheet1!$C$7' },
           ];

       The "font" property is used to set the font of the custom data label of a series (See the  "CHART  FONTS"
       section below):

           $custom_labels = [
               { value =&gt; '=Sheet1!$C$1', font =&gt; { color =&gt; 'red' } },
               { value =&gt; '=Sheet1!$C$2', font =&gt; { color =&gt; 'red' } },
               { value =&gt; '=Sheet1!$C$2', font =&gt; { color =&gt; 'red' } },
               { value =&gt; '=Sheet1!$C$4', font =&gt; { color =&gt; 'red' } },
               { value =&gt; '=Sheet1!$C$5', font =&gt; { color =&gt; 'red' } },
               { value =&gt; '=Sheet1!$C$6', font =&gt; { color =&gt; 'red' } },
           ];

       The  "border"  property  sets  the border properties of the data labels such as colour and style. See the
       "CHART FORMATTING" section below.

       The "fill" property sets the fill  properties  of  the  data  labels  such  as  colour.  See  the  "CHART
       FORMATTING" section below.

       Example of setting custom data label formatting:

           $custom_labels = [
               { value =&gt; 'Jan', border =&gt; {color =&gt; 'blue'} },
               { value =&gt; 'Feb' },
               { value =&gt; 'Mar' },
               { value =&gt; 'Apr' },
               { value =&gt; 'May' },
               { value =&gt; 'Jun', fill   =&gt; {color =&gt; 'green'} },
           ];

       The "pattern" property sets the pattern properties of the data labels. See the "CHART FORMATTING" section
       below.

       The  "gradient"  property  sets  the  gradient  properties of the data labels. See the "CHART FORMATTING"
       section below.

       The "delete" property can be used to delete labels in a series.  This  can  be  useful  if  you  want  to
       highlight one or more cells in the series, for example the maximum and the minimum:

           $custom_labels = [
               undef,
               { delete =&gt; 1 },
               { delete =&gt; 1 },
               { delete =&gt; 1 },
               { delete =&gt; 1 },
               undef,
           ];

   <b>Points</b>
       In  general formatting is applied to an entire series in a chart. However, it is occasionally required to
       format individual points in a series. In particular this is required for Pie and  Doughnut  charts  where
       each segment is represented by a point.

       In these cases it is possible to use the "points" property of "add_series()":

           $chart-&gt;add_series(
               values =&gt; '=Sheet1!$A$1:$A$3',
               points =&gt; [
                   { fill =&gt; { color =&gt; '#FF0000' } },
                   { fill =&gt; { color =&gt; '#CC0000' } },
                   { fill =&gt; { color =&gt; '#990000' } },
               ],
           );

       The "points" property takes an array ref of format options (see the "CHART FORMATTING" section below). To
       assign default properties to points in a series pass "undef" values in the array ref:

           # Format point 3 of 3 only.
           $chart-&gt;add_series(
               values =&gt; '=Sheet1!$A$1:$A$3',
               points =&gt; [
                   undef,
                   undef,
                   { fill =&gt; { color =&gt; '#990000' } },
               ],
           );

           # Format the first point only.
           $chart-&gt;add_series(
               values =&gt; '=Sheet1!$A$1:$A$3',
               points =&gt; [ { fill =&gt; { color =&gt; '#FF0000' } } ],
           );

   <b>Smooth</b>
       The  "smooth"  option  is  used to set the smooth property of a line series. It is only applicable to the
       "Line" and "Scatter" chart types.

           $chart-&gt;add_series( values =&gt; '=Sheet1!$C$1:$C$5',
                               smooth =&gt; 1 );

</pre><h4><b>CHART</b> <b>FORMATTING</b></h4><pre>
       The following chart formatting properties can be set for any chart object that they apply  to  (and  that
       are supported by Excel::Writer::XLSX) such as chart lines, column fill areas, plot area borders, markers,
       gridlines and other chart elements documented above.

           line
           border
           fill
           pattern
           gradient

       Chart formatting properties are generally set using hash refs.

           $chart-&gt;add_series(
               values     =&gt; '=Sheet1!$B$1:$B$5',
               line       =&gt; { color =&gt; 'blue' },
           );

       In some cases the format properties can be nested. For example a "marker" may contain "border" and "fill"
       sub-properties.

           $chart-&gt;add_series(
               values     =&gt; '=Sheet1!$B$1:$B$5',
               line       =&gt; { color =&gt; 'blue' },
               marker     =&gt; {
                   type    =&gt; 'square',
                   size    =&gt; 5,
                   border  =&gt; { color =&gt; 'red' },
                   fill    =&gt; { color =&gt; 'yellow' },
               },
           );

   <b>Line</b>
       The  line  format  is used to specify properties of line objects that appear in a chart such as a plotted
       line on a chart or a border.

       The following properties can be set for "line" formats in a chart.

           none
           color
           width
           dash_type
           transparency

       The "none" property is used to turn the "line" off (it is always on by default except in Scatter charts).
       This is useful if you wish to plot a series with markers but without a line.

           $chart-&gt;add_series(
               values     =&gt; '=Sheet1!$B$1:$B$5',
               line       =&gt; { none =&gt; 1 },
           );

       The "color" property sets the color of the "line".

           $chart-&gt;add_series(
               values     =&gt; '=Sheet1!$B$1:$B$5',
               line       =&gt; { color =&gt; 'red' },
           );

       The available colours are shown in the main Excel::Writer::XLSX documentation. It is also possible to set
       the colour of a line with a HTML style RGB colour:

           $chart-&gt;add_series(
               line       =&gt; { color =&gt; '#FF0000' },
           );

       The "width" property sets the width of the "line". It should be specified in  increments  of  0.25  of  a
       point as in Excel.

           $chart-&gt;add_series(
               values     =&gt; '=Sheet1!$B$1:$B$5',
               line       =&gt; { width =&gt; 3.25 },
           );

       The "dash_type" property sets the dash style of the line.

           $chart-&gt;add_series(
               values     =&gt; '=Sheet1!$B$1:$B$5',
               line       =&gt; { dash_type =&gt; 'dash_dot' },
           );

       The following "dash_type" values are available. They are shown in the order that they appear in the Excel
       dialog.

           solid
           round_dot
           square_dot
           dash
           dash_dot
           long_dash
           long_dash_dot
           long_dash_dot_dot

       The default line style is "solid".

       The  "transparency"  property sets the transparency of the "line" color in the integer range 1 - 100. The
       color must be set for transparency to work, it doesn't work with an automatic/default color:

           $chart-&gt;add_series(
               values     =&gt; '=Sheet1!$B$1:$B$5',
               line       =&gt; { color =&gt; 'yellow', transparency =&gt; 50 },
           );

       More than one "line" property can be specified at a time:

           $chart-&gt;add_series(
               values     =&gt; '=Sheet1!$B$1:$B$5',
               line       =&gt; {
                   color     =&gt; 'red',
                   width     =&gt; 1.25,
                   dash_type =&gt; 'square_dot',
               },
           );

   <b>Border</b>
       The "border" property is a synonym for "line".

       It can be used as a descriptive substitute for "line" in chart types such as Bar and Column that  have  a
       border  and  fill  style rather than a line style. In general chart objects with a "border" property will
       also have a fill property.

   <b>Solid</b> <b>Fill</b>
       The fill format is used to specify filled areas of chart objects such as the interior of a column or  the
       background of the chart itself.

       The following properties can be set for "fill" formats in a chart.

           none
           color
           transparency

       The "none" property is used to turn the "fill" property off (it is generally on by default).

           $chart-&gt;add_series(
               values     =&gt; '=Sheet1!$B$1:$B$5',
               fill       =&gt; { none =&gt; 1 },
           );

       The "color" property sets the colour of the "fill" area.

           $chart-&gt;add_series(
               values     =&gt; '=Sheet1!$B$1:$B$5',
               fill       =&gt; { color =&gt; 'red' },
           );

       The available colours are shown in the main Excel::Writer::XLSX documentation. It is also possible to set
       the colour of a fill with a HTML style RGB colour:

           $chart-&gt;add_series(
               fill       =&gt; { color =&gt; '#FF0000' },
           );

       The  "transparency"  property sets the transparency of the solid fill color in the integer range 1 - 100.
       The color must be set for transparency to work, it doesn't work with an automatic/default color:

           $chart-&gt;set_chartarea( fill =&gt; { color =&gt; 'yellow', transparency =&gt; 75 } );

       The "fill" format is generally used in conjunction with a "border" format which has the  same  properties
       as a "line" format.

           $chart-&gt;add_series(
               values     =&gt; '=Sheet1!$B$1:$B$5',
               border     =&gt; { color =&gt; 'red' },
               fill       =&gt; { color =&gt; 'yellow' },
           );

   <b>Pattern</b> <b>Fill</b>
       The  pattern fill format is used to specify pattern filled areas of chart objects such as the interior of
       a column or the background of the chart itself.

       The following properties can be set for "pattern" fill formats in a chart:

           pattern:   the pattern to be applied (required)
           fg_color:  the foreground color of the pattern (required)
           bg_color:  the background color (optional, defaults to white)

       For example:

           $chart-&gt;set_plotarea(
               pattern =&gt; {
                   pattern  =&gt; 'percent_5',
                   fg_color =&gt; 'red',
                   bg_color =&gt; 'yellow',
               }
           );

       The following patterns can be applied:

           percent_5
           percent_10
           percent_20
           percent_25
           percent_30
           percent_40
           percent_50
           percent_60
           percent_70
           percent_75
           percent_80
           percent_90
           light_downward_diagonal
           light_upward_diagonal
           dark_downward_diagonal
           dark_upward_diagonal
           wide_downward_diagonal
           wide_upward_diagonal
           light_vertical
           light_horizontal
           narrow_vertical
           narrow_horizontal
           dark_vertical
           dark_horizontal
           dashed_downward_diagonal
           dashed_upward_diagonal
           dashed_horizontal
           dashed_vertical
           small_confetti
           large_confetti
           zigzag
           wave
           diagonal_brick
           horizontal_brick
           weave
           plaid
           divot
           dotted_grid
           dotted_diamond
           shingle
           trellis
           sphere
           small_grid
           large_grid
           small_check
           large_check
           outlined_diamond
           solid_diamond

       The foreground color, "fg_color", is a required parameter and can be a Html style "#RRGGBB" string  or  a
       limited  number  of  named  colors.  The  available  colours  are  shown  in the main Excel::Writer::XLSX
       documentation.

       The background color, "bg_color", is optional and defaults to black.

       If a pattern fill is used on a chart object it overrides the solid fill properties of the object.

   <b>Gradient</b> <b>Fill</b>
       The gradient fill format is used to specify gradient filled areas of chart objects such as  the  interior
       of a column or the background of the chart itself.

       The following properties can be set for "gradient" fill formats in a chart:

           colors:    a list of colors
           positions: an optional list of positions for the colors
           type:      the optional type of gradient fill
           angle:     the optional angle of the linear fill

       The "colors" property sets a list of colors that define the "gradient":

           $chart-&gt;set_plotarea(
               gradient =&gt; { colors =&gt; [ '#DDEBCF', '#9CB86E', '#156B13' ] }
           );

       Excel  allows  between 2 and 10 colors in a gradient but it is unlikely that you will require more than 2
       or 3.

       As with solid or pattern fill it is also possible to set the colors of  a  gradient  with  a  Html  style
       "#RRGGBB"  string  or  a  limited  number  of  named  colors. The available colours are shown in the main
       Excel::Writer::XLSX documentation:

           $chart-&gt;add_series(
               values   =&gt; '=Sheet1!$A$1:$A$5',
               gradient =&gt; { colors =&gt; [ 'red', 'green' ] }
           );

       The "positions" defines an optional list of positions, between 0 and 100, of  where  the  colors  in  the
       gradient  are  located. Default values are provided for "colors" lists of between 2 and 4 but they can be
       specified if required:

           $chart-&gt;add_series(
               values   =&gt; '=Sheet1!$A$1:$A$5',
               gradient =&gt; {
                   colors    =&gt; [ '#DDEBCF', '#156B13' ],
                   positions =&gt; [ 10,        90 ],
               }
           );

       The "type" property can have one of the following values:

           linear        (the default)
           radial
           rectangular
           path

       For example:

           $chart-&gt;add_series(
               values   =&gt; '=Sheet1!$A$1:$A$5',
               gradient =&gt; {
                   colors =&gt; [ '#DDEBCF', '#9CB86E', '#156B13' ],
                   type   =&gt; 'radial'
               }
           );

       If "type" isn't specified it defaults to "linear".

       For a "linear" fill the angle of the gradient can also be specified:

           $chart-&gt;add_series(
               values   =&gt; '=Sheet1!$A$1:$A$5',
               gradient =&gt; { colors =&gt; [ '#DDEBCF', '#9CB86E', '#156B13' ],
                             angle =&gt; 30 }
           );

       The default angle is 90 degrees.

       If gradient fill is used on a chart object it overrides the solid fill and pattern fill properties of the
       object.

</pre><h4><b>CHART</b> <b>FONTS</b></h4><pre>
       The following font properties can be set for any chart object that they apply to (and that are  supported
       by  Excel::Writer::XLSX)  such  as  chart  titles,  axis  labels,  axis  numbering  and data labels. They
       correspond  to  the  equivalent  Worksheet  cell  Format  object  properties.  See  "FORMAT_METHODS"   in
       Excel::Writer::XLSX for more information.

           name
           size
           bold
           italic
           underline
           rotation
           color

       The following explains the available font properties:

       •   "name"

           Set the font name:

               $chart-&gt;set_x_axis( num_font =&gt; { name =&gt; 'Arial' } );

       •   "size"

           Set the font size:

               $chart-&gt;set_x_axis( num_font =&gt; { name =&gt; 'Arial', size =&gt; 10 } );

       •   "bold"

           Set the font bold property, should be 0 or 1:

               $chart-&gt;set_x_axis( num_font =&gt; { bold =&gt; 1 } );

       •   "italic"

           Set the font italic property, should be 0 or 1:

               $chart-&gt;set_x_axis( num_font =&gt; { italic =&gt; 1 } );

       •   "underline"

           Set the font underline property, should be 0 or 1:

               $chart-&gt;set_x_axis( num_font =&gt; { underline =&gt; 1 } );

       •   "rotation"

           Set the font rotation in the integer range -90 to 90, and 270-271:

               $chart-&gt;set_x_axis( num_font =&gt; { rotation =&gt; 45 } );

           This is useful for displaying large axis data such as dates in a more compact format.

           There are 2 special case angles outside the range -90 to 90:

           •   270: Stacked text, where the text runs from top to bottom.

           •   271: A special variant of stacked text for East Asian fonts.

       •   "color"

           Set the font color property. Can be a color index, a color name or HTML style RGB colour:

               $chart-&gt;set_x_axis( num_font =&gt; { color =&gt; 'red' } );
               $chart-&gt;set_y_axis( num_font =&gt; { color =&gt; '#92D050' } );

       Here is an example of Font formatting in a Chart program:

           # Format the chart title.
           $chart-&gt;set_title(
               name      =&gt; 'Sales Results Chart',
               name_font =&gt; {
                   name  =&gt; 'Calibri',
                   color =&gt; 'yellow',
               },
           );

           # Format the X-axis.
           $chart-&gt;set_x_axis(
               name      =&gt; 'Month',
               name_font =&gt; {
                   name  =&gt; 'Arial',
                   color =&gt; '#92D050'
               },
               num_font =&gt; {
                   name  =&gt; 'Courier New',
                   color =&gt; '#00B0F0',
               },
           );

           # Format the Y-axis.
           $chart-&gt;set_y_axis(
               name      =&gt; 'Sales (1000 units)',
               name_font =&gt; {
                   name      =&gt; 'Century',
                   underline =&gt; 1,
                   color     =&gt; 'red'
               },
               num_font =&gt; {
                   bold   =&gt; 1,
                   italic =&gt; 1,
                   color  =&gt; '#7030A0',
               },
           );

</pre><h4><b>CHART</b> <b>LAYOUT</b></h4><pre>
       The position of the chart in the worksheet is controlled by the "set_size()" method shown above.

       It is also possible to change the layout of the following chart sub-objects:

           plotarea
           legend
           title
           x_axis caption
           y_axis caption

       Here are some examples:

           $chart-&gt;set_plotarea(
               layout =&gt; {
                   x      =&gt; 0.35,
                   y      =&gt; 0.26,
                   width  =&gt; 0.62,
                   height =&gt; 0.50,
               }
           );

           $chart-&gt;set_legend(
               layout =&gt; {
                   x      =&gt; 0.80,
                   y      =&gt; 0.37,
                   width  =&gt; 0.12,
                   height =&gt; 0.25,
               }
           );

           $chart-&gt;set_title(
               name   =&gt; 'Title',
               layout =&gt; {
                   x =&gt; 0.42,
                   y =&gt; 0.14,
               }
           );

           $chart-&gt;set_x_axis(
               name        =&gt; 'X axis',
               name_layout =&gt; {
                   x =&gt; 0.34,
                   y =&gt; 0.85,
               }
           );

       Note that it is only possible to change the width and height for the "plotarea" and "legend" objects. For
       the other text based objects the width and height are changed by the font dimensions.

       The layout units must be a float in the range "0 &lt; x &lt;= 1" and are expressed as a percentage of the chart
       dimensions as shown below:

       From this the layout units are calculated as follows:

           layout:
               width  = w / W
               height = h / H
               x      = a / W
               y      = b / H

       These  units  are slightly cumbersome but are required by Excel so that the chart object positions remain
       relative to each other if the chart is resized by the user.

       Note that for "plotarea" the origin is the top left corner in the plotarea itself and does not take  into
       account the axes.

</pre><h4><b>WORKSHEET</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       In  Excel  a chartsheet (i.e, a chart that isn't embedded) shares properties with data worksheets such as
       tab selection, headers, footers, margins, and print properties.

       In Excel::Writer::XLSX you can set chartsheet properties  using  the  same  methods  that  are  used  for
       Worksheet objects.

       The following Worksheet methods are also available through a non-embedded Chart object:

           get_name()
           activate()
           select()
           hide()
           set_first_sheet()
           protect()
           set_zoom()
           set_tab_color()

           set_landscape()
           set_portrait()
           set_paper()
           set_margins()
           set_header()
           set_footer()

       See Excel::Writer::XLSX for a detailed explanation of these methods.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       Here is a complete example that demonstrates some of the available features when creating a chart.

           #!<a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?perl">/usr/bin/perl</a>

           use strict;
           use warnings;
           use Excel::Writer::XLSX;

           my $workbook  = Excel::Writer::XLSX-&gt;new( 'chart.xlsx' );
           my $worksheet = $workbook-&gt;add_worksheet();
           my $bold      = $workbook-&gt;add_format( bold =&gt; 1 );

           # Add the worksheet data that the charts will refer to.
           my $headings = [ 'Number', 'Batch 1', 'Batch 2' ];
           my $data = [
               [ 2,  3,  4,  5,  6,  7 ],
               [ 10, 40, 50, 20, 10, 50 ],
               [ 30, 60, 70, 50, 40, 30 ],

           ];

           $worksheet-&gt;write( 'A1', $headings, $bold );
           $worksheet-&gt;write( 'A2', $data );

           # Create a new chart object. In this case an embedded chart.
           my $chart = $workbook-&gt;add_chart( type =&gt; 'column', embedded =&gt; 1 );

           # Configure the first series.
           $chart-&gt;add_series(
               name       =&gt; '=Sheet1!$B$1',
               categories =&gt; '=Sheet1!$A$2:$A$7',
               values     =&gt; '=Sheet1!$B$2:$B$7',
           );

           # Configure second series. Note alternative use of array ref to define
           # ranges: [ $sheetname, $row_start, $row_end, $col_start, $col_end ].
           $chart-&gt;add_series(
               name       =&gt; '=Sheet1!$C$1',
               categories =&gt; [ 'Sheet1', 1, 6, 0, 0 ],
               values     =&gt; [ 'Sheet1', 1, 6, 2, 2 ],
           );

           # Add a chart title and some axis labels.
           $chart-&gt;set_title ( name =&gt; 'Results of sample analysis' );
           $chart-&gt;set_x_axis( name =&gt; 'Test number' );
           $chart-&gt;set_y_axis( name =&gt; 'Sample length (mm)' );

           # Set an Excel chart style. Blue colors with white outline and shadow.
           $chart-&gt;set_style( 11 );

           # Insert the chart into the worksheet (with an offset).
           $worksheet-&gt;insert_chart( 'D2', $chart, { x_offset =&gt; 25, y_offset =&gt; 10 } );

           $workbook-&gt;close();

           __END__

</pre><h4><b>Value</b> <b>and</b> <b>Category</b> <b>Axes</b></h4><pre>
       Excel differentiates between a chart axis that is used for series <b>categories</b> and an axis that is used for
       series <b>values</b>.

       In  the example above the X axis is the category axis and each of the values is evenly spaced. The Y axis
       (in this case) is the value axis and points are displayed according to their value.

       Since Excel treats the axes  differently  it  also  handles  their  formatting  differently  and  exposes
       different properties for each.

       As  such some of "Excel::Writer::XLSX" axis properties can be set for a value axis, some can be set for a
       category axis and some properties can be set for both.

       For example the "min" and "max" properties can only be set for value axes and "reverse" can  be  set  for
       both.  The  type  of  axis  that  a  property  applies  to  is shown in the "set_x_axis()" section of the
       documentation above.

       Some charts such as "Scatter" and "Stock" have two value axes.

       Date Axes are a special type of category axis which are explained below.

</pre><h4><b>Date</b> <b>Category</b> <b>Axes</b></h4><pre>
       Date Category Axes are category axes that display time or date information. In  Excel::Writer::XLSX  Date
       Category Axes are set using the "date_axis" option:

           $chart-&gt;set_x_axis( date_axis =&gt; 1 );

       In general you should also specify a number format for a date axis although Excel will usually default to
       the same format as the data being plotted:

           $chart-&gt;set_x_axis(
               date_axis         =&gt; 1,
               num_format        =&gt; 'dd/mm/yyyy',
           );

       Excel  doesn't  normally allow minimum and maximum values to be set for category axes. However, date axes
       are an exception. The "min" and "max" values should be set as Excel times or dates:

           $chart-&gt;set_x_axis(
               date_axis         =&gt; 1,
               min               =&gt; $worksheet-&gt;convert_date_time('2013-01-02T'),
               max               =&gt; $worksheet-&gt;convert_date_time('2013-01-09T'),
               num_format        =&gt; 'dd/mm/yyyy',
           );

       For date axes it is also possible to set the type of the major and minor units:

           $chart-&gt;set_x_axis(
               date_axis         =&gt; 1,
               minor_unit        =&gt; 4,
               minor_unit_type   =&gt; 'months',
               major_unit        =&gt; 1,
               major_unit_type   =&gt; 'years',
               num_format        =&gt; 'dd/mm/yyyy',
           );

</pre><h4><b>Secondary</b> <b>Axes</b></h4><pre>
       It is possible to add a secondary axis of the same type to a chart by setting the "y2_axis" or  "x2_axis"
       property of the series:

           #!<a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?perl">/usr/bin/perl</a>

           use strict;
           use warnings;
           use Excel::Writer::XLSX;

           my $workbook  = Excel::Writer::XLSX-&gt;new( 'chart_secondary_axis.xlsx' );
           my $worksheet = $workbook-&gt;add_worksheet();

           # Add the worksheet data that the charts will refer to.
           my $data = [
               [ 2,  3,  4,  5,  6,  7 ],
               [ 10, 40, 50, 20, 10, 50 ],

           ];

           $worksheet-&gt;write( 'A1', $data );

           # Create a new chart object. In this case an embedded chart.
           my $chart = $workbook-&gt;add_chart( type =&gt; 'line', embedded =&gt; 1 );

           # Configure a series with a secondary axis
           $chart-&gt;add_series(
               values  =&gt; '=Sheet1!$A$1:$A$6',
               y2_axis =&gt; 1,
           );

           $chart-&gt;add_series(
               values =&gt; '=Sheet1!$B$1:$B$6',
           );

           # Insert the chart into the worksheet.
           $worksheet-&gt;insert_chart( 'D2', $chart );

           $workbook-&gt;close();

           __END__

       It  is  also  possible  to  have a secondary, combined, chart either with a shared or secondary axis, see
       below.

</pre><h4><b>Combined</b> <b>Charts</b></h4><pre>
       It is also possible to combine two different chart types, for example a column and line chart to create a
       Pareto chart using the Chart "combine()" method:

       Here is a simpler example:

           use strict;
           use warnings;
           use Excel::Writer::XLSX;

           my $workbook  = Excel::Writer::XLSX-&gt;new( 'chart_combined.xlsx' );
           my $worksheet = $workbook-&gt;add_worksheet();
           my $bold      = $workbook-&gt;add_format( bold =&gt; 1 );

           # Add the worksheet data that the charts will refer to.
           my $headings = [ 'Number', 'Batch 1', 'Batch 2' ];
           my $data = [
               [ 2,  3,  4,  5,  6,  7 ],
               [ 10, 40, 50, 20, 10, 50 ],
               [ 30, 60, 70, 50, 40, 30 ],

           ];

           $worksheet-&gt;write( 'A1', $headings, $bold );
           $worksheet-&gt;write( 'A2', $data );

           #
           # In the first example we will create a combined column and line chart.
           # They will share the same X and Y axes.
           #

           # Create a new column chart. This will use this as the primary chart.
           my $column_chart = $workbook-&gt;add_chart( type =&gt; 'column', embedded =&gt; 1 );

           # Configure the data series for the primary chart.
           $column_chart-&gt;add_series(
               name       =&gt; '=Sheet1!$B$1',
               categories =&gt; '=Sheet1!$A$2:$A$7',
               values     =&gt; '=Sheet1!$B$2:$B$7',
           );

           # Create a new column chart. This will use this as the secondary chart.
           my $line_chart = $workbook-&gt;add_chart( type =&gt; 'line', embedded =&gt; 1 );

           # Configure the data series for the secondary chart.
           $line_chart-&gt;add_series(
               name       =&gt; '=Sheet1!$C$1',
               categories =&gt; '=Sheet1!$A$2:$A$7',
               values     =&gt; '=Sheet1!$C$2:$C$7',
           );

           # Combine the charts.
           $column_chart-&gt;combine( $line_chart );

           # Add a chart title and some axis labels. Note, this is done via the
           # primary chart.
           $column_chart-&gt;set_title( name =&gt; 'Combined chart - same Y axis' );
           $column_chart-&gt;set_x_axis( name =&gt; 'Test number' );
           $column_chart-&gt;set_y_axis( name =&gt; 'Sample length (mm)' );

           # Insert the chart into the worksheet
           $worksheet-&gt;insert_chart( 'E2', $column_chart );

           $workbook-&gt;close();

       The secondary chart can also be placed on a secondary axis  using  the  methods  shown  in  the  previous
       section.

       In  this  case  it  is  just necessary to add a "y2_axis" parameter to the series and, if required, add a
       title using "set_y2_axis()" <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>chart</b>. The following  are  the  additions  to  the  previous
       example to place the secondary chart on the secondary axis:

           ...

           $line_chart-&gt;add_series(
               name       =&gt; '=Sheet1!$C$1',
               categories =&gt; '=Sheet1!$A$2:$A$7',
               values     =&gt; '=Sheet1!$C$2:$C$7',
               y2_axis    =&gt; 1,
           );

           ...

           # Note: the y2 properites are on the secondary chart.
           $line_chart2-&gt;set_y2_axis( name =&gt; 'Target length (mm)' );

       The  examples above use the concept of a <u>primary</u> and <u>secondary</u> chart. The primary chart is the chart that
       defines the primary X and Y axis. It is also used  for  setting  all  chart  properties  apart  from  the
       secondary  data  series.  For  example  the chart title and axes properties should be set via the primary
       chart (except for the the secondary "y2" axis properties which should be applied to the secondary chart).

       See also "chart_combined.pl" and "chart_pareto.pl" examples in the distro for more detailed examples.

       There are some limitations on combined charts:

       •   Pie charts cannot currently be combined.

       •   Scatter charts cannot currently be used as a primary chart but they can be used as a secondary chart.

       •   Bar charts can only combined secondary charts on a secondary axis. This is an Excel limitation.
