       registry - Manipulate the Windows registry

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>package</b> <b>require</b> <b>registry</b> <b>1.3</b>

       <b>registry</b> ?<u>-mode</u>? <u>option</u> <u>keyName</u> ?<u>arg</u> <u>arg</u> <u>...</u>?
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>registry</b>  package  provides  a general set of operations for manipulating the Windows registry.  The
       package implements the <b>registry</b> Tcl command.  This command is only supported  on  the  Windows  platform.
       Warning:  this  command  should  be used with caution as a corrupted registry can leave your system in an
       unusable state.

       <u>KeyName</u> is the name of a registry key.  Registry keys must be one of the following forms:

              <b>\\</b><u>hostname</u><b>\</b><u>rootname</u><b>\</b><u>keypath</u>

              <u>rootname</u><b>\</b><u>keypath</u>

              <u>rootname</u>

       <u>Hostname</u> specifies the name of any valid Windows host that exports its registry.  The <u>rootname</u>  component
       must be one of <b>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE</b>, <b>HKEY_USERS</b>, <b>HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT</b>, <b>HKEY_CURRENT_USER</b>, <b>HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG</b>,
       <b>HKEY_PERFORMANCE_DATA</b>,  or <b>HKEY_DYN_DATA</b>.  The <u>keypath</u> can be one or more registry key names separated by
       backslash (<b>\</b>) characters.

       The optional <u>-mode</u> argument indicates which registry to work with; when it is <b>-32bit</b> the 32-bit  registry
       will  be  used,  and when it is <b>-64bit</b> the 64-bit registry will be used. If this argument is omitted, the
       system's default registry will be the subject of the requested operation.

       <u>Option</u> indicates what to do  with  the  registry  key  name.   Any  unique  abbreviation  for  <u>option</u>  is
       acceptable.  The valid options are:

       <b>registry</b> <b>broadcast</b> <u>keyName</u> ?<b>-timeout</b> <u>milliseconds</u>?
              Sends  a  broadcast  message to the system and running programs to notify them of certain updates.
              This is necessary to propagate changes  to  key  registry  keys  like  Environment.   The  timeout
              specifies  the  amount  of  time,  in  milliseconds,  to  wait  for applications to respond to the
              broadcast message.  It defaults to 3000.  The following example demonstrates how to add a path  to
              the global Environment and notify applications of the change without requiring a logoff/logon step
              (assumes admin privileges):

                     set regPath [join {
                         HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
                         SYSTEM
                         CurrentControlSet
                         Control
                         {Session Manager}
                         Environment
                     } "\\"]
                     set curPath [<b>registry</b> <b>get</b> $regPath "Path"]
                     <b>registry</b> <b>set</b> $regPath "Path" "$curPath;$addPath"
                     <b>registry</b> <b>broadcast</b> "Environment"

       <b>registry</b> <b>delete</b> <u>keyName</u> ?<u>valueName</u>?
              If  the  optional <u>valueName</u> argument is present, the specified value under <u>keyName</u> will be deleted
              from the registry.  If the optional <u>valueName</u> is omitted, the specified key  and  any  subkeys  or
              values beneath it in the registry hierarchy will be deleted.  If the key could not be deleted then
              an error is generated.  If the key did not exist, the command has no effect.

       <b>registry</b> <b>get</b> <u>keyName</u> <u>valueName</u>
              Returns  the data associated with the value <u>valueName</u> under the key <u>keyName</u>.  If either the key or
              the value does not exist, then an error is generated.  For more  details  on  the  format  of  the
              returned data, see <b>SUPPORTED</b> <b>TYPES</b>, below.

       <b>registry</b> <b>keys</b> <u>keyName</u> ?<u>pattern</u>?
              If <u>pattern</u> is not specified, returns a list of names of all the subkeys of <u>keyName</u>.  If <u>pattern</u> is
              specified,  only those names matching <u>pattern</u> are returned.  Matching is determined using the same
              rules as for <b>string</b> <b>match</b>.  If the specified <u>keyName</u> does not exist, then an error is generated.

       <b>registry</b> <b>set</b> <u>keyName</u> ?<u>valueName</u> <u>data</u> ?<u>type</u>??
              If <u>valueName</u> is not specified, creates the key <u>keyName</u> if it does not already exist.  If <u>valueName</u>
              is specified, creates the key <u>keyName</u> and value <u>valueName</u> if necessary.  The contents of <u>valueName</u>
              are set to <u>data</u> with the type indicated by <u>type</u>.  If  <u>type</u>  is  not  specified,  the  type  <b>sz</b>  is
              assumed.  For more details on the data and type arguments, see <b>SUPPORTED</b> <b>TYPES</b> below.

       <b>registry</b> <b>type</b> <u>keyName</u> <u>valueName</u>
              Returns  the type of the value <u>valueName</u> in the key <u>keyName</u>.  For more information on the possible
              types, see <b>SUPPORTED</b> <b>TYPES</b>, below.

       <b>registry</b> <b>values</b> <u>keyName</u> ?<u>pattern</u>?
              If <u>pattern</u> is not specified, returns a list of names of all the values of <u>keyName</u>.  If <u>pattern</u>  is
              specified,  only those names matching <u>pattern</u> are returned.  Matching is determined using the same
              rules as for <b>string</b> <b>match</b>.

</pre><h4><b>SUPPORTED</b> <b>TYPES</b></h4><pre>
       Each value under a key in the registry contains some  data  of  a  particular  type  in  a  type-specific
       representation.   The  <b>registry</b> command converts between this internal representation and one that can be
       manipulated by Tcl scripts.  In most cases, the data is simply  returned  as  a  Tcl  string.   The  type
       indicates  the  intended  use  for  the  data, but does not actually change the representation.  For some
       types, the <b>registry</b> command returns the data in a different form to make it easier  to  manipulate.   The
       following types are recognized by the registry command:

       <b>binary</b> The  registry  value  contains  arbitrary  binary  data.   The data is represented exactly in Tcl,
              including any embedded nulls.

       <b>none</b>   The registry value contains arbitrary binary data with no defined type.  The data  is  represented
              exactly in Tcl, including any embedded nulls.

       <b>sz</b>     The registry value contains a null-terminated string.  The data is represented in Tcl as a string.

       <b>expand_sz</b>
              The  registry  value  contains  a  null-terminated  string  that contains unexpanded references to
              environment variables  in  the  normal  Windows  style  (for  example,  “%PATH%”).   The  data  is
              represented in Tcl as a string.

       <b>dword</b>  The  registry  value  contains a little-endian 32-bit number.  The data is represented in Tcl as a
              decimal string.

       <b>dword_big_endian</b>
              The registry value contains a big-endian 32-bit number.  The data  is  represented  in  Tcl  as  a
              decimal string.

       <b>link</b>   The  registry  value  contains a symbolic link.  The data is represented exactly in Tcl, including
              any embedded nulls.

       <b>multi_sz</b>
              The registry value contains an array of null-terminated strings.  The data is represented  in  Tcl
              as a list of strings.

       <b>resource_list</b>
              The  registry  value  contains  a device-driver resource list.  The data is represented exactly in
              Tcl, including any embedded nulls.

       In addition to the symbolically named types listed above, unknown types are  identified  using  a  32-bit
       integer  that  corresponds to the type code returned by the system interfaces.  In this case, the data is
       represented exactly in Tcl, including any embedded nulls.

</pre><h4><b>PORTABILITY</b> <b>ISSUES</b></h4><pre>
       The registry command is only available on Windows.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       Print out how double-clicking on a Tcl script file will invoke a Tcl interpreter:

              package require registry
              set ext .tcl

              # Read the type name
              set type [<b>registry</b> <b>get</b> HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\$ext {}]
              # Work out where to look for the command
              set path HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\$type\\Shell\\Open\\command
              # Read the command!
              set command [<b>registry</b> <b>get</b> $path {}]

              puts "$ext opens with $command"
