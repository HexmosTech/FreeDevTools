</pre><h4><b>INPUT</b> <b>PARAMETERS</b></h4><pre>
       • <b>count</b>: Maximum number of elements to receive (integer).

       • <b>datatype</b>: Datatype of each receive buffer entry (handle).

       • <b>source</b>: Rank of source (integer).

       • <b>tag</b>: Message tag (integer).

       • <b>comm</b>: Communicator (handle).

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b> <b>PARAMETERS</b></h4><pre>
       • <b>buf</b>: Initial address of receive buffer (choice).

       • <b>status</b>: Status object (status).

       • <b>ierror</b>: Fortran only: Error status (integer).

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  basic  receive  operation, <u>MPI_Recv</u>, is blocking: it returns only after the receive buffer contains
       the newly received message. A receive can complete before the matching send has completed (of course,  it
       can complete only after the matching send has started).

       The  blocking  semantics  of  this  call  are  described  in the “Communication Modes” section of the <u>MPI</u>
       <u>Standard</u>.

       The receive buffer contains a number (defined by the value of <u>count</u>) of consecutive elements.  The  first
       element in the set of elements is located at <u>address_buf</u>. The type of each of these elements is specified
       by <u>datatype</u>.

       The  length  of  the  received message must be less than or equal to the length of the receive buffer. An
       MPI_ERR_TRUNCATE is returned upon the overflow condition.

       If a message that is shorter than the length of the receive buffer arrives,  then  only  those  locations
       corresponding to the (shorter) received message are modified.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>count</u>  argument  indicates  the maximum number of entries of type <u>datatype</u> that can be received in a
       message. Once a message is received, use the <u>MPI_Get_count</u> function to determine  the  actual  number  of
       entries within that message.

       To  receive messages of unknown length, use the <u>MPI_Probe</u> function.  For more information about <u>MPI_Probe</u>
       and <u>MPI_Cancel</u>, see their respective man pages and the “Probe and Cancel” section of the <u>MPI</u> <u>Standard</u>.

       A message can be received by a receive operation only if it is addressed to the receiving process, and if
       its source, tag, and communicator (comm) values match the source, tag, and comm values specified  by  the
       receive  operation.  The receive operation may specify a wildcard value for source and/or tag, indicating
       that any source and/or tag are acceptable. The wildcard value for source is source = <b>MPI_ANY_SOURCE</b>.  The
       wildcard value for tag is tag = <b>MPI_ANY_TAG</b>. There is no wildcard value for  comm.  The  scope  of  these
       wildcards is limited to the processes in the group of the specified communicator.

       The message tag is specified by the tag argument of the receive operation.

       The  argument  source,  if different from <b>MPI_ANY_SOURCE</b>, is specified as a rank within the process group
       associated with that same communicator (remote process group, for intercommunicators). Thus, the range of
       valid values for the source argument is {0,…,n-1} {<b>MPI_ANY_SOURCE</b>}, where n is the number of processes in
       this group.

       Note the asymmetry between send and receive operations: A receive operation may accept messages  from  an
       arbitrary  sender;  on  the  other  hand, a send operation must specify a unique receiver. This matches a
       “push” communication mechanism, where data transfer is effected by  the  sender  (rather  than  a  “pull”
       mechanism, where data transfer is effected by the receiver).

       Source  =  destination  is  allowed,  that is, a process can send a message to itself. However, it is not
       recommended for a process to send messages to itself using  the  blocking  send  and  receive  operations
       described above, since this may lead to deadlock.  See the “Semantics of Point-to-Point Communication” of
       the <u>MPI</u> <u>Standard</u> for more details.

       If  your  application  does  not  need  to  examine the <u>status</u> field, you can save resources by using the
       predefined constant <b>MPI_STATUS_IGNORE</b> as a special value for the <u>status</u> argument.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       Almost all MPI routines return an error value; C routines as  the  return  result  of  the  function  and
       Fortran routines in the last argument.

       Before  the  error  value  is  returned,  the current MPI error handler associated with the communication
       object (e.g., communicator, window, file) is called.  If no communication object is associated  with  the
       MPI  call,  then  the call is considered attached to MPI_COMM_SELF and will call the associated MPI error
       handler.  When  MPI_COMM_SELF  is  not  initialized   (i.e.,   before   <u>MPI_Init</u>/<u>MPI_Init_thread</u>,   after
       <u>MPI_Finalize</u>,  or  when using the Sessions Model exclusively) the error raises the initial error handler.
       The initial error handler can be changed by calling <u>MPI_Comm_set_errhandler</u> on MPI_COMM_SELF  when  using
       the  World  model,  or the mpi_initial_errhandler CLI argument to mpiexec or info key to <u>MPI_Comm_spawn</u>/‐
       <u>MPI_Comm_spawn_multiple</u>.  If no other appropriate error handler has been set, then the  MPI_ERRORS_RETURN
       error  handler  is  called for MPI I/O functions and the MPI_ERRORS_ABORT error handler is called for all
       other MPI functions.

       Open MPI includes three predefined error handlers that can be used:

       • <b>MPI_ERRORS_ARE_FATAL</b> Causes the program to abort all connected MPI processes.

       • <b>MPI_ERRORS_ABORT</b> An error handler that can be invoked on a communicator, window, file, or session. When
         called on a communicator, it acts as if <u>MPI_Abort</u> was called on  that  communicator.  If  called  on  a
         window  or file, acts as if <u>MPI_Abort</u> was called on a communicator containing the group of processes in
         the corresponding window or file. If called on a session, aborts only the local process.

       • <b>MPI_ERRORS_RETURN</b> Returns an error code to the application.

       MPI applications can also implement their own error handlers by calling:

       • <u>MPI_Comm_create_errhandler</u> then <u>MPI_Comm_set_errhandler</u>

       • <u>MPI_File_create_errhandler</u> then <u>MPI_File_set_errhandler</u>

       • <u>MPI_Session_create_errhandler</u> then <u>MPI_Session_set_errhandler</u> or at <u>MPI_Session_init</u>

       • <u>MPI_Win_create_errhandler</u> then <u>MPI_Win_set_errhandler</u>

       Note that MPI does not guarantee that an MPI program can continue past an error.

       See the <u>MPI</u> <u>man</u> <u>page</u> for a full list of <u>MPI</u> <u>error</u> <u>codes</u>.

       See the Error Handling section of the MPI-3.1 standard for more information.

       Note that per the “Return Status” section in  the  “Point-to-Point  Communication”  chapter  in  the  <u>MPI</u>
       <u>Standard</u>,  MPI  errors  on  messages  received  by  <u>MPI_Recv</u> do not set the <b>status.MPI_ERROR</b> field in the
       returned <u>status</u>.  The error code is always passed to the back-end error handler and may be passed back to
       the caller through the return  value  of  <u>MPI_Recv</u>  if  the  back-end  error  handler  returns  it.   The
       pre-defined MPI error handler <b>MPI_ERRORS_RETURN</b> exhibits this behavior, for example.
