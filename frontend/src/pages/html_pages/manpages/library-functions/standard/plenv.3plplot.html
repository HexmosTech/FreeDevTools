       <b>plenv</b> - Set up standard window and draw box

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>plenv</b>(<u>xmin</u>, <u>xmax</u>, <u>ymin</u>, <u>ymax</u>, <u>just</u>, <u>axis</u>)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Sets  up  plotter  environment  for  simple  graphs by calling <b><a href="../man3plplot/pladv.3plplot.html">pladv</a></b>(3plplot) and setting up viewport and
       window to sensible default values. <b><a href="../man3plplot/plenv.3plplot.html">plenv</a></b>(3plplot) leaves a standard margin  (left-hand  margin  of  eight
       character  heights,  and  a  margin  around  the other three sides of five character heights) around most
       graphs for axis labels and a title.  When these defaults are not suitable, use  the  individual  routines
       <b><a href="../man3plplot/plvpas.3plplot.html">plvpas</a></b>(3plplot),  <b><a href="../man3plplot/plvpor.3plplot.html">plvpor</a></b>(3plplot),  or  <b><a href="../man3plplot/plvasp.3plplot.html">plvasp</a></b>(3plplot)  for setting up the viewport, <b><a href="../man3plplot/plwind.3plplot.html">plwind</a></b>(3plplot) for
       defining the window, and <b><a href="../man3plplot/plbox.3plplot.html">plbox</a></b>(3plplot) for drawing the box.

       Redacted form: <b>plenv(xmin,</b> <b>xmax,</b> <b>ymin,</b> <b>ymax,</b> <b>just,</b> <b>axis)</b>

       This function is used in example 1,3,9,13,14,19-22,29.

</pre><h4><b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>xmin</u> (<b><a href="../man3plplot/PLFLT.3plplot.html">PLFLT</a></b>(3plplot), input)
              Value of x at left-hand edge of window (in world coordinates).

       <u>xmax</u> (<b><a href="../man3plplot/PLFLT.3plplot.html">PLFLT</a></b>(3plplot), input)
              Value of x at right-hand edge of window (in world coordinates).

       <u>ymin</u> (<b><a href="../man3plplot/PLFLT.3plplot.html">PLFLT</a></b>(3plplot), input)
              Value of y at bottom edge of window (in world coordinates).

       <u>ymax</u> (<b><a href="../man3plplot/PLFLT.3plplot.html">PLFLT</a></b>(3plplot), input)
              Value of y at top edge of window (in world coordinates).

       <u>just</u> (<b><a href="../man3plplot/PLINT.3plplot.html">PLINT</a></b>(3plplot), input)
              Controls how the axes will be scaled: -1: the scales will not be set, the user  must  set  up  the
              scale before calling <b><a href="../man3plplot/plenv.3plplot.html">plenv</a></b>(3plplot) using <b><a href="../man3plplot/plsvpa.3plplot.html">plsvpa</a></b>(3plplot), <b><a href="../man3plplot/plvasp.3plplot.html">plvasp</a></b>(3plplot) or other.  0: the x and
              y  axes are scaled independently to use as much of the screen as possible.  1: the scales of the x
              and y axes are made equal.  2: the axis of the x and y axes are made equal, and the plot box  will
              be square.

       <u>axis</u> (<b><a href="../man3plplot/PLINT.3plplot.html">PLINT</a></b>(3plplot), input)
              Controls  drawing  of  the  box  around  the plot: -2: draw no box, no tick marks, no numeric tick
              labels, no axes.  -1: draw box only.  0: draw box, ticks, and numeric tick labels.  1:  also  draw
              coordinate  axes at x=0 and y=0.  2: also draw a grid at major tick positions in both coordinates.
              3: also draw a grid at minor tick positions in both coordinates.  10: same as 0 except logarithmic
              x tick marks. (The x data have to be converted to logarithms separately.)  11: same  as  1  except
              logarithmic x tick marks. (The x data have to be converted to logarithms separately.)  12: same as
              2  except  logarithmic  x  tick marks. (The x data have to be converted to logarithms separately.)
              13: same as 3 except logarithmic x tick marks. (The x data have  to  be  converted  to  logarithms
              separately.)   20:  same as 0 except logarithmic y tick marks. (The y data have to be converted to
              logarithms separately.)  21: same as 1 except logarithmic y tick marks. (The y  data  have  to  be
              converted  to  logarithms separately.)  22: same as 2 except logarithmic y tick marks. (The y data
              have to be converted to logarithms separately.)  23: same as 3 except logarithmic  y  tick  marks.
              (The  y  data  have to be converted to logarithms separately.)  30: same as 0 except logarithmic x
              and y tick marks. (The x and y data have to be converted to logarithms separately.)  31: same as 1
              except logarithmic x and y tick marks. (The x and y  data  have  to  be  converted  to  logarithms
              separately.)   32:  same  as 2 except logarithmic x and y tick marks. (The x and y data have to be
              converted to logarithms separately.)  33: same as 3 except logarithmic x and y tick marks. (The  x
              and  y  data  have  to be converted to logarithms separately.)  40: same as 0 except date / time x
              labels.  41: same as 1 except date / time x labels.  42: same as 2 except date /  time  x  labels.
              43:  same  as 3 except date / time x labels.  50: same as 0 except date / time y labels.  51: same
              as 1 except date / time y labels.  52: same as 2 except date / time  y  labels.   53:  same  as  3
              except  date  /  time  y  labels.  60: same as 0 except date / time x and y labels.  61: same as 1
              except date / time x and y labels.  62: same as 2 except date / time x and y labels.  63: same  as
              3  except  date / time x and y labels.  70: same as 0 except custom x and y labels.  71: same as 1
              except custom x and y labels.  72: same as 2 except custom x and y labels.  73: same as  3  except
              custom x and y labels.
