       sio - standard input/output module

</pre><h4><b>STANDARD</b> <b>INPUT/OUTPUT</b> <b>MODULE</b></h4><pre>
       The  Standard  Input/Output module is an orginal implementation that provides objects for i/o operations.
       Although input and output files are the standard objects that one might expect, the module facilities for
       directory access, path manipulation and i/o event management. At the heart of this module is the  concept
       of  stream  associated  with the transcoding object which enable the passage between one coding system to
       another. It is also this module which provides the stream selector object.

       <b>Input</b> <b>and</b> <b>output</b> <b>streams</b>
       The afnix-sio module is based on facilities provided by two base classes, namely, the InputStream  stream
       and  the  OutputStream  stream.  Both classes have associated predicates with the name input-stream-p and
       output-stream-p. The base class associated is the Stream class those sole purpose is to define the stream
       coding mode.

       <u>Stream</u> <u>base</u> <u>class</u>
       The Stream class is the base class for the InputStream and OutputStream classes. The Stream class is used
       to define the stream coding mode that affects how characters are read or written. When a stream  operates
       in byte mode, each character is assumed to be encoded in one byte. In that case, the input stream methods
       read and getu are equivalent and no transformation is performed when writing characters. This behavior is
       the default stream behavior. For certain stream, like terminal, this behavior is changed depending on the
       current  localization  settings.  For instance, if the current locale is operating with an UTF-8 codeset,
       the Terminal stream coding mode is automatically adjusted to reflect this situation. Since  the  US-ASCII
       codeset  is  predominant  and the default steam coding mode is the byte mode, there should be no conflict
       during the read and write operations.

       <u>Stream</u> <u>transcoding</u>
       The Stream class provides the support for the transcoding of different codesets.  All  ISO-8859  codesets
       are  supported.  Since  the engine operates internally with Unicode characters, the transcoding operation
       takes care of changing a character in one particular codeset into its equivalent Unicode  representation.
       This operation is done for an input stream that operates in byte mode. For an output stream, the opposite
       operation  is  done.  An internal Unicode characters representation is therefore mapped into a particular
       codeset. Note that only the codeset characters can be mapped.
       Codeset   Description
       DEFAULT   Default codeset, i.e US-ASCII
       ISO-01    ISO-8859-1 codeset
       ISO-02    ISO-8859-2 codeset
       ISO-03    ISO-8859-3 codeset
       ISO-04    ISO-8859-4 codeset
       ISO-05    ISO-8859-5 codeset
       ISO-06    ISO-8859-6 codeset
       ISO-07    ISO-8859-7 codeset
       ISO-08    ISO-8859-8 codeset
       ISO-09    ISO-8859-9 codeset
       ISO-10    ISO-8859-10 codeset
       ISO-11    ISO-8859-11 codeset
       ISO-13    ISO-8859-13 codeset
       ISO-14    ISO-8859-14 codeset
       ISO-15    ISO-8859-15 codeset
       ISO-16    ISO-8859-16 codeset
       UTF-08    Unicode UTF-8 codeset

       The set-encoding-mode can be used to set the stream encoding  codeset.  The  method  operates  either  by
       enumeration  or  string. The get-encoding-mode returns the stream encoding mode. There are some time good
       reasons to force a stream encoding mode. For example, a file encoded in UTF-8 that is read  will  require
       this  call  since  the  default  stream  mode is to work in byte mode. It should be noted that there is a
       difference between the enumeration and the string encoding mode. The enumeration mode defines whether the
       stream operates in byte or UTF-8 mode. When the stream operates in byte mode, it  is  also  necessary  to
       define  the  transcoding mode with the set-transcoding-mode method. For simplicity, the string version of
       the set-encoding-mode takes care of setting both the stream mode and the transcoding  mode.  It  is  also
       worth to note that internally, the Stream class is derived from the Transcoder class.

       <u>Input</u> <u>stream</u>
       The  InputStream  base  class has several method for reading and testing for byte availability. Moreover,
       the class provides a push-back buffer. Reading bytes is in the form of three  methods.  The  read  method
       without  argument  returns the next available byte or the end-of-streameos. With an integer argument, the
       read method returns a Buffer with at most the number of requested bytes. The readln  method  returns  the
       next  available  line.  When  it  is  necessary  to  read  characters  instead of bytes, the getu is more
       appropriate since it returns an Unicode character.

       <u>Output</u> <u>stream</u>
       The OutputStream base class provides the base methods to write to an  output  stream.  The  write  method
       takes  literal objects which are automatically converted to string representation and then written to the
       output stream. Note that for the case of a Buffer object, it is the buffer  itself  that  take  a  stream
       argument and not the opposite.

       <u>The</u> <u>valid-p</u> <u>predicate</u>
       The  input stream provides a general mechanism to test and read for bytes. The base method is the valid-p
       predicate that returns true if a byte can be read from the stream. It  is  important  to  understand  its
       behavior  which  depends  on  the  stream  type.  Without  argument,  the valid-p predicate checks for an
       available byte from the input stream. This predicate will block if no byte is  available.  On  the  other
       end,  for  a  bounded  stream  like an input file, the method will not block at the end of file. With one
       integer argument, the valid-p predicate will timeout after the specified time specified in  milliseconds.
       This second behavior is particularly useful with unbound stream like socket stream.

       <u>The</u> <u>eos-p</u> <u>predicate</u>
       The  eos-p  predicate  does not take argument. The predicate behaves like not (valid-p 0). However, there
       are more subtle behaviors. For an input file, the predicate will return true if and only if a byte cannot
       be read. If a byte has been pushed-back and the end-of-stream marker is reached, the method  will  return
       false.  For  an  input  terminal, the method returns true if the user and entered the end-of-stream byte.
       Once again, the method reacts to the contents of the push-back buffer. For certain input stream,  like  a
       tcp  socket,  the method will return true when no byte can be read, that is here, the connection has been
       closed. For an udp socket, the method will return true when all datagram bytes have be read.

       <u>The</u> <u>read</u> <u>method</u>
       The read method is sometimes disturbing. Nevertheless, the method is a blocking one  and  will  return  a
       byte  when completed. The noticeable exception is the returned byte when an end-of-stream marker has been
       reached. The method returns the ctrl-d byte. Since a binary file might contains valid byte like ctrl-d it
       is necessary to use the valid-p or eos-p predicate to check for a file reading  completion.  This  remark
       apply  also  to bounded streams like a tcp socket. For some type of streams like a udp socket, the method
       will block when all datagram bytes have been consumed and no more datagram has arrived. With this kind of
       stream, there is no end-of-stream condition and therefore care should be taken  to  properly  assert  the
       stream  content.  This  last remark is especially true for the readln method. The method will return when
       the end-of-stream marker is reached, even if a newline byte has not been read. With an udp  socket,  such
       behavior will not happen.

       <u>Buffer</u> <u>read</u> <u>mode</u>
       The read method with an integer argument, returns a buffer with at least the number of bytes specified as
       an  argument. This method is particularly useful when the contents has a precise size. The method returns
       a Buffer object which can later be used to read, or transform  bytes.  Multi-byte  conversion  to  number
       should  use  such  approach.  The read method does not necessarily returns the number of requested bytes.
       Once the buffer is returned, the length method can be used to  check  the  buffer  size.  Note  also  the
       existence of the to-string method which returns a string representation of the buffer.

       # try to read 256 bytes
       const buf (is:read 256)
       # get the buffer size
       println (buf:length)
       # get a string representation
       println (buf:to-string)

       <b>File</b> <b>stream</b>
       The afnix-sio module provides two classes for file access. The InputFile class open a file for input. The
       OutputFile class opens a file for output. The InputFile class is derived from the InputStream base class.
       The  OutputFile  class is derived from the OutputStream class. By default an output file is created if it
       does not exist. If the file already exist, the file is truncated to 0. Another constructor for the output
       file gives more control about this behavior. It takes two boolean flags that  defines  the  truncate  and
       append mode.

       # load the module
       interp:library "afnix-sio"
       # create an input file by name
       const if (afnix:sio:InputFile "orig.txt")
       # create an output file by name
       const of (afnix:sio:OutputFile "copy.txt")

       <u>Stream</u> <u>information</u>
       Both InputFile and OutputFile supports the get-name method which returns the file name.

       println (if:get-name)
       println (of:get-name)

       Predicates  are  also  available  for  these  classes.  The  input-file-p  returns true for an input file
       object.The output-file-p returns true for an output file object.

       afnix:sio:input-stream-p  if
       afnix:sio:output-stream-p of
       afnix:sio:input-file-p    if
       afnix:sio:output-file-p   of

       <u>Reading</u> <u>and</u> <u>writing</u>
       The read method reads a byte on an input stream. The write method writes one or more literal arguments on
       the output stream. The writeln method writes one or more literal arguments followed by a newline byte  on
       the  output  stream.  The  newline  method write a newline byte on the output stream. The eos-p predicate
       returns true for an input stream, if the stream is at the end. The valid-p predicate returns true  if  an
       input stream is in a valid state. With these methods, copying a file is a simple operation.

       # load the module and open the files
       interp:library "afnix-sio"
       const if (afnix:sio:InputFile "orig.txt")
       const of (afnix:sio:OutputFile "copy.txt")
       # loop in the input file and write
       while (if:valid-p) (of:write (if:read))

       The  use of the readln method can be more effective. The example below is a simple cat program which take
       the file name an argument.

       # cat a file on the output terminal
       # usage: axi 0601.als file
       # get the io module
       interp:library "afnix-sio"
       # cat a file
       const cat (name) {
         const f (afnix:sio:InputFile name)
         while (f:valid-p) (println (f:readln))
         f:close
       }
       # get the file
       if (== 0 (interp:argv:length)) {
         errorln "usage: axi 0601.als file"
       } {
         cat (interp:argv:get 0)
       }

       <b>Multiplexing</b>
       I/O multiplexing is the ability to manipulate several streams at the same time and process one at a time.
       Although the use of threads reduce the needs for i/o multiplexing, there is still situations  where  they
       are  needed. In other words, I/O multiplexing is identical to the valid-p predicate, except that it works
       with several stream objects.

       <u>Selector</u> <u>object</u>
       I/O multiplexing is accomplished with the Selector class. The  constructor  takes  0  or  several  stream
       arguments.  The  class manages automatically to differentiate between InputStream stream and OutputStream
       streams. Once the class is constructed, it is possible to get the  first  stream  ready  for  reading  or
       writing  or  all of them. We assume in the following example that is and os are respectively an input and
       an output stream.

       # create a selector
       const slt (afnix:sio:Selector is)
       # at this stage the selector has one stream
       # the add method can add more streams
       slt:add os

       The add method adds a new stream  to  the  selector.  The  stream  must  be  either  an  InputStream  and
       OutputStream  stream  or an exception is raised. If the stream is both an input and an output stream, the
       preference is given to the input stream. If this preference is  not  acceptable,  the  input-add  or  the
       output-add  methods  might  be preferable. The input-length method returns the number of input streams in
       this selector. The output-length method returns the number of output streams in this selector. The input-
       get method returns the selector input stream by index. The output-get method returns the selector  output
       stream by index.

       <u>Waiting</u> <u>for</u> <u>i/o</u> <u>event</u>
       The  wait  and  wait-all  methods can be used to detect a status change in the selector. Without argument
       both methods will block indefinitely until one stream change. With  one  integer  argument,  both  method
       blocks  until  one  stream  change  or  the integer argument timeout expires. The timeout is expressed in
       milliseconds. Note that 0 indicates an immediate return. The wait method returns the first  stream  which
       is  ready  either  for reading or writing depending whether it is an input or output stream. The wait-all
       method returns a vector with all streams that have changed their status. The wait method returns  nil  if
       the no stream have changed. Similarly, the wait-all method returns an empty vector.

       # wait for a status change
       const is (slt:wait)
       # is is ready for reading - make sure it is an input one
       if (afnix:sio:input-stream-p is) (is:read)

       A call to the wait method will always returns the first input stream.

       <u>Marking</u> <u>mode</u>
       When used with several input streams in a multi-threaded context, the selector behavior can becomes quite
       complicated.  For  this  reason, the selector can be configured to operate in marking mode. In such mode,
       the selector can be marked as ready by a thread independently of the bounded streams. This  is  a  useful
       mechanism  which  can  be  used to cancel a select loop. The mark method is designed to mark the selector
       while the marked-p predicate returns true if the stream has been marked.

       <b>Terminal</b> <b>streams</b>
       Terminal streams are another kind of streams  available  in  the  standard  i/o  module.  The  InputTerm,
       OutputTerm  and  ErrorTerm  classes  are  low level classes used to read or write from or to the standard
       streams. The basic methods to read or write are the same as the file  streams.  Reading  from  the  input
       terminal  is  not a good idea, since the class does not provide any formatting capability. One may prefer
       to use the Terminal class. The use of the output terminal or error terminal streams  is  convenient  when
       the interpreter standard streams have been changed but one still need to print to the terminal.

       <u>Terminal</u> <u>class</u>
       The  Terminal  class  combines  an input stream and an output stream with some line editing capabilities.
       When the class is created, the constructed attempts to detect if the input and output streams are bounded
       to a terminal (i.e tty). If the line editing capabilities can be loaded (i.e  non  canonical  mode),  the
       terminal  is  initialized  for  line  editing.  Arrows, backspace, delete and other control sequences are
       available when using the read-line method. The standard methods like read or readln do not use  the  line
       editing  features.  When  using  a  terminal,  the prompt can be set to whatever the user wishes with the
       methods set-primary-prompt or set-secondary-prompt. A secondary prompt is displayed  when  the  read-line
       method is called with the boolean argument false.

       const term (Terminal)
       term:set-primary-prompt "demo:"
       const line (term:read-line)
       errorln line

       <u>Using</u> <u>the</u> <u>error</u> <u>terminal</u>
       The ErrorTerm class is the most frequently used class for printing data on the standard error stream. The
       reserved  keywords  error  or  errorln  are  available  to  write on the interpreter error stream. If the
       interpreter error stream has been changed, the use of the ErrorTerm will provide the facility required to
       print directly on the terminal. The cat program can be rewritten to do exactly this.

       # cat a file on the error terminal
       # get the io module
       interp:library "afnix-sio"
       # cat a file
       const cat (name es) {
         const f (afnix:sio:InputFile name)
         while (f:valid-p) (es:writeln (f:readln))
         f:close
       }

       <b>Directory</b>
       The Directory class provides a facility to manipulate directories. A directory object is  created  either
       by  name  or  without argument by considering the current working directory. Once the directory object is
       created, it is possible to retrieve its contents, create new directory or remove empty one.

       <u>Reading</u> <u>a</u> <u>directory</u>
       A Directory object is created either by name or without argument. With no argument, the current directory
       is opened. When the current directory is opened,  its  full  name  is  computed  internally  and  can  be
       retrieved with the get-name method.

       # print the current directory
       const pwd (afnix:sio:Directory)
       println   (pwd:get-name)

       Once the directory object is opened, it is possible to list its contents. The get-list method returns the
       full  contents  of  the directory object. The get-files method returns a list of files in this directory.
       The get-subdirs method returns a list of sub directories in this directory.

       # print a list of files
       const pwd (afnix:sio:Directory)
       const lsf (d:get-files)
       for (name) (lsf) (println name)

       <u>Creating</u> <u>and</u> <u>removing</u> <u>directories</u>
       The mkdir and rmdir methods can be used to create or remove a  directory.  Both  methods  take  a  string
       argument  and  construct a full path name from the directory name and the argument. This approach has the
       advantage of being file system independent. If the directory already exists, the mkdir methods  succeeds.
       The rmdir method requires the directory to be empty.

       const tmp (afnix:sio:Directory (
           afnix:sio:absolute-path "tmp"))
       const exp (tmp:mkdir "examples")
       const lsf (exp:get-files)
       println   (lsf:length)
       tmp:rmdir "examples"

       The  function  absolute-path  constructs  an  absolute path name from the argument list. If relative path
       needs to be constructed, the function relative-path might be used instead.

       <b>Logtee</b>
       The Logtee class is a message logger facility associated with an output stream. When a message  is  added
       to  the logger object, the message is also sent to the output stream, depending on the controlling flags.
       The name "logtee" comes from the contraction of "logger" and "tee". One particularity  of  the  class  is
       that without a stream, the class behaves like a regular logger.

       <u>Creating</u> <u>a</u> <u>logger</u>
       The  Logtee  default  constructor creates a standard logger object without an output stream. The instance
       can also be created by size or with an output  stream  or  both.  A  third  method  can  also  attach  an
       information string.

       # create a logger with the interpreter stream
       const log (Logtee (interp:get-output-stream))
       assert true (logger-p log)

       <u>Adding</u> <u>messages</u>
       The  process of adding messages is similar to the regular logger. The only difference is that the message
       is placed on the output stream if a control flag is set and the message level is less or equal the report
       level. In the other word, the control flag controls the message display -- the tee operation -- while the
       report level filters some of the messages.

       log:add 2 "a level 2 message"

       The set-tee method sets the control flag. The set-report-level method sets the report  level.  Note  that
       the set-report-level and its associated get-report-level method is part of the base Logger class.

       <b>Path</b> <b>name</b>
       The  Pathname  class is a base class designed to ease the manipulation of system path. It is particularly
       useful when it come to manipulate directory component.

       <u>Creating</u> <u>a</u> <u>path</u> <u>name</u>
       A path name is created either by file name or by file and directory name. In the  first  case,  only  the
       file name is used. In the second case, the full path name is characterized.

       # create a new path name
       const path (afnix:sio:Pathname "axi")

       <u>Adding</u> <u>a</u> <u>directory</u> <u>path</u>
       The best way to add a directory path is to use the absolute-path or the relative-path functions.

       # adding a directory path
       const name (afnix:sio:absolute-path "usr" "bin")
       path:set-directory-name name

       <u>Getting</u> <u>the</u> <u>path</u> <u>information</u>
       The  path  information can be obtained individually or globally. The get-file-name and get-directory-name
       methods return respectively the file and directory name. The get-root method returns the  root  component
       of the directory name. The get-full method returns the full path name.

       <b>Transcoder</b>
       The Transcoder class is a codeset transcoder class. The class is responsible to map a byte character in a
       given  codeset  into  its associated Unicode character. It should be noted that not all characters can be
       transcoded.

       <u>Predicate</u>

       <u>Inheritance</u>

              Object

       <u>Constants</u>

              <b>DEFAULT</b>
              The DEFAULT constant is used by the set-transcoding-mode method to specify the  class  transcoding
              mode. In default mode, each character is not transcoded. This mode is the identity mode.

              <b>I8859-01</b>
              The  I8859-01 constant is used by the set-transcoding-mode method to specify the class transcoding

       <b>InputOutput</b>
       The  InputOutput  class  implements an input-output stream with a buffer which holds character during the
       processing of transit between the output stream to the input stream. The  theory  of  operation  goes  as
       follow.  The internal buffer is filled with characters with the help of the output stream. The characters
       are consumed from the buffer with the help of the input stream (read method). If the buffer becomes empty
       the eos-p predicate returns true, the valid-p predicate false and the read method  will  return  the  eos
       character.  The  InputOutput buffer can also be initialized with a buffer. This provides a nice mechanism
       to use a buffer like an input stream. The i/o operations implemented by this class are non-blocking. As a
       consequence, it is not possible to suspend a thread  with  this  class  and  have  it  awaken  when  some
       characters are available in the input stream.

       <b>Selector</b>
       The Selector class provides some facilities to perform i/o  multiplexing.  The  constructor  takes  0  or
       several  stream arguments.The class manages automatically the differentiation between the InputStream and
       the OutputStream objects. Once the class is constructed, it is possible to get the first stream ready for
       reading or writing or all of them. It is also possible to add more steams after construction with the add
       method. When a call to the wait method succeeds, the method returns the first available  stream.  If  the
       waitall  method  is  called,  the  method  returns  a  vector  with all ready steams. The selector can be
       configured to operate in marking mode. In such mode, the selector can be marked  as  ready  by  a  thread
       independently  of  the  bounded  streams. This is a useful mechanism which can be used to cancel a select
       loop. The mark method is designed to mark the selector while the marked-p predicate returns true  if  the
       stream has been marked.
