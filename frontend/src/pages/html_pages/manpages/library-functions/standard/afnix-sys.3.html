</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       sys - standard system access module

</pre><h4><b>STANDARD</b> <b>SYSTEM</b> <b>ACCESS</b> <b>MODULE</b></h4><pre>
       The  Standard System Access module is an original implementation of various objects designed to provide a
       specialized access to the underlying system. Most of the system accesses are  provided  in  the  form  of
       functions which have been designed to be portable as possible. One example of this, are the time and date
       management objects.

       <b>Interpreter</b> <b>information</b>
       The  interpreter  provides a set reserved names that are related to the system platform. Example 0501.als
       demonstrates the available information.

       zsh&gt; axi 0501.als
       program name           : afnix
       operating system name  : linux
       operating system type  : unix
       afnix official uri     : <a href="http://www.afnix.org">http://www.afnix.org</a>

       <u>Interpreter</u> <u>version</u>
       The interpreter version is identified by 3 numbers called major, minor and patch numbers. A change in the
       major number represents a major change in the writing system. The minor number indicates a  major  change
       in  the interface or libraries. A change in the patch number indicates bug fixes. All values are accessed
       via the interpreter itself. The major-version, minor-version, patch-version symbols are  bound  to  these
       values.

       println "major version number   : "
       interp:major-version
       println "minor version number   : "
       interp:minor-version
       println "patch version number   : "
       interp:patch-version

       <u>Operating</u> <u>system</u>
       The operating system is uniquely identified by its name. The operating system type (or category) uniquely
       identifies the operating system flavor.

       println "operating system name  : "
       interp:os-name
       println "operating system type  : "
       interp:os-type

       <u>Program</u> <u>information</u>
       Program  information  are  carried  by two symbols that identifies the program name and the official uri.
       While the first might be useful, the second one is mostly used by demo programs.

       println "program name           : "
       interp:program-name
       println "afnix official uri     : "
       interp:afnix-uri

       <b>System</b> <b>services</b>
       The system services module provides various functions that  cannot  be  classified  into  any  particular
       category.
       Function        Description
       exit            terminate with an exit code
       sleep           pause for a certain time
       get-pid         get the process identifier
       get-env         get an environment variable
       get-host-name   get the host name
       get-user-name   get the user name

       The  exit function terminates the program with an exit code specified as the argument. The sleep function
       pause the specific thread for a certain time. The time argument is expressed in milliseconds. The get-pid
       function returns the process identifier. The get-env function returns the environment variable associated
       with the string argument. The get-host-name function returns the host name. The host name can be either a
       simple name or a canonical name with its domain, depending on the system configuration. The get-user-name
       function returns the current user name.

       <b>Time</b> <b>and</b> <b>date</b>
       The Time and Date classes are classes designed to manipulate time and date. The writing  system  operates
       with  a  special  coordinated  time  which  uses  the  reference  of Jan 1st 0000 in a modified proleptic
       Gregorian calendar. This proleptic feature means that the actual calendar (Gregorian) is extended  beyond
       year  1582  (its introduction year) and modified in order to support the year 0. This kind of calendar is
       somehow similar to the astronomical Gregorian calendar except that  the  reference  date  is  0  for  the
       writing  system. This method presents the advantage to support negative time. It should be noted that the
       0 reference does not means year 1BC since year 0 did not exist at that  time  (the  concept  of  zero  is
       fairly  new)  and  more  important,  the  date  expressed  in the form 1BC generally refers to the Julian
       calendar since the date is before 1582. Although, the class provides several methods to access  the  time
       and  date  fields,  it  is  also  possible to get a string representation that conforms to ISO-8601 or to
       RFC-2822.

       <u>Time</u> <u>and</u> <u>date</u> <u>construction</u>
       By default, a time instance of current time is constructed. This time  reference  is  obtained  form  the
       machine  time  and  adjusted  for the internal representation. One feature of this class is that the time
       instance does not have to be bounded with 24 hours. The time stored is the absolute time, which should be
       considered like a temporal reference -- or date -- those origin is 0 in some calendar representation.

       const  time (afnix:sys:Time)
       assert true (afnxi:sys:time-p time)

       A simple time representation can also be built by hours, minutes and seconds. In this case, the time is a
       time definition at day 0 in the reference calendar.

       const  time (afnix:sys:Time 12 23 54)

       By default a date instance of the current date is constructed. The current  date  is  computed  from  the
       machine  time  and  expressed  in  a particular calendar. By default, the engine uses a special Gregorian
       calendar as explained before. The important point here s that the date will show up like the user  should
       expect.

       const  date (afnix:sys:Date)
       assert true (afnix:sys:date-p date)

       A  date  instance can also be built with an absolute time expressed in seconds or with specific elements.
       with one argument, the date is expressed in seconds since the origin. Since the  internal  representation
       is  64  bits,  the  date room is quite large. For example, the absolute time to represent Jan 1st 1970 is
       62167219200 seconds. This epoch is used to adjust the system time on some UNIX  system.  Another  way  to
       create  a  specific date is to use the date descriptor by year, month and day. With 6 arguments, the time
       components can also be given. This makes Date one of the constructor that accept the  largest  number  of
       arguments.

       const  date (afnix:sys:Date 1789 7 14 16 0 0)
       assert true (afnix:sys:date-p date)

       In  the  previous  example,  at  17:00  local  time,  16:00Z  although  the  concept of time zone was not
       formalized, the Bastille surrenders on July 14 1789. This example shows that extreme care should be  used
       when  dealing  with  old  dates.  Note  that a simpler form could have been used to set that date. With 3
       argument, the date is set at time 00:00:00Z.

       const  date (afnix:sys:Date 1789 7 14)
       assert true (afnix:sys:date-p date)

       <u>Time</u> <u>and</u> <u>date</u> <u>representation</u>
       Except for some special applications -- like the cookie maximum age --, the date representation is  quite
       standard and can be found either in the form of ISO-8601 or RFC-2822.

       const time (afnix:sys:Time 12 44 55)
       println    (time:format) # 12:44:55
       println    (time:to-iso) # 14:44:55
       println    (time:to-rfc) # 14:44:55 +0200

       in  the first form, the time is represented naturally by hour, minutes and seconds. By default, it is the
       local time that is given. With a flag set to true, the UTC time is displayed. In  the  second  form,  the
       time  is  displayed  in  the  ISO-8601  form  which is the same as before. In the third form, the time is
       displayed in the RFC-2822 form. This form is  always  expressed  locally  with  the  timezone  difference
       associated  with it. It shall be noted that the ISO-8601 mandate to use the suffix 'Z' for the zulu time.
       This is the difference when using the true flag with the format and to-iso methods.

       println (time:format true) # 12:44:55
       println (time:to-iso true) # 12:44:55Z

       The date representation also operates with 3 methods, namely format, to-iso and to-rfc. For  example,  if
       the time is 12:00 in Paris on July 14th 2000, the date will be displayed like below.

       const date (afnix:sys:Date 2000 7 14 12 0 0)
       # Fri Jul 14 07:00:00 2000
       println (date:format)
       # 2000-07-14T07:00:00
       println (date:to-iso)
       # Fri, 14 Jul 2000 07:00:00 -0500
       println (date:to-rfc)

       The example show the local time. With UTC display, only the first two methods can be used.

       const date (afnix:sys:Date 2000 7 14 12 0 0)
       println (date:format true) # Fri Jul 14 12:00:00 2000
       println (date:to-iso true) # 2000-07-14T12:00:00Z

       <b>Options</b> <b>parsing</b>
       The  Options  class  provides  a  convenient  mechanism to define a set of options and to parse them in a
       simple way. The object is constructed by specifying which  option  is  valid  and  how  it  behaves.  The
       arguments can be passed to the object for subsequent analysis. An option can be either a unique option or
       a  string  option.  In this later case, multiple value for the same option can be accepted. In that case,
       the option is said to be a string vector option. An option can be also an option list. I that  case,  the
       option  is  defined  with a set of valid string. A list option is associated with a boolean flag for each
       string defined with that option.

       <u>Option</u> <u>creation</u>
       An Options is created by invoking the constructor with or without a user message.  The  user  message  is
       used by the usage method which display an information message.

       const options (
         afnix:sys:Options "axi [options] [file [arguments]]")

       Eventually, the set-user-message method can be used to set the user message.

       <u>Options</u> <u>definition</u>
       The  process  of defining options is done by specifying the option character, eventually an option string
       and an option message.

       options:add-unique-option 'h'
       "print this help message"
       options:add-unique-option 'v'
       "print system version"
       options:add-vector-option 'i'
       "add a resolver path"
       options:add-string-option 'e'
       "force the encoding mode"
       options:add-list-option   'f' "assert"
       "enable assertion checks"
       options:add-list-option   'f' "nopath"
       "do not set initial path"

       The above example shows the option descriptors for the interpreter. Since i is a vector option,  multiple
       occurrences of that option is allowed. It shall be noted that the list option f assert is a debug option.
       This means that this option is always set when the program is compiled in debug mode.

       <u>Options</u> <u>parsing</u> <u>and</u> <u>retrieval</u>
       A  string  vector  is  parsed  with  the  parse method. Generally, the vector argument is the interpreter
       argument vector defined in the qualified name interp:args. When the vector has been successfully  parsed,
       it is possible to check the option that have been set.

       options:parse (Vector "-h")
       if (options:get-unique-option 'h') {
         options:usage
         afnix:sys:exit 0
       }

       In  the  above  example,  the option vector is parsed with the parse method. The get-unique-option method
       returns true for the h thus triggering the display of the usage message.

       usage: axi [options] [file [arguments]]
       [h]           print this help message
       [v]           print system version
       [i   path]    add a resolver path
       [e   mode]    force the encoding mode
       [f assert]    enable assertion checks
       [f nopath]    do not set initial path

       If the option is a string option, the get-string-option will  return  the  string  associated  with  that
       option.  It  shall be noted that the get-unique-option method can be used to check if the option has been
       set during the parsing process. If the option is a vector option, the get-vector-option  method  is  more
       appropriate. In this case, a vector is returned with all strings matching this option.

       options:parse (
         Vector "-i" "../" "-i" "..<a href="file:/..">/..</a>" -e "UTF-08" "hello")

       In the previous example, the vector option i is set two times. The associated vector option has therefore
       a length of 2. The string option e is set to UTF-08. For this option e, the get-unique-option method will
       return true. Finally, the vector argument is filled with one string argument.

       <b>Time</b>
       The  Time  class  is  a  simple class used to manipulate time. The  AFNIX  system operates with a special
       coordinated time which uses the reference of Jan 1st 0000 in a  modified  proleptic  gregorian  calendar.
       Note  that  the  time  can  be  negative. Although, the class provides several methods to access the time
       fields, it is also possible to get a string representation that conforms to ISO-8601 or to RFC-2822.  The
       resolution  is in seconds. With 1 argument, the object is initialized with the time clock specified as an
       integer argument. With 3 arguments, the time is expressed with its different elements.

              <b>get-time</b> <b>-&gt;</b> <b>Integer</b> <b>(none|Boolean)</b>
              The  get-time  method  returns  absolute  time  in seconds. Without argument, the absolute time is
              computed in reference to the UTC time. With a boolean argument set to true, the time  is  computed
              in reference to the UTC time. If the argument is false, the local time is used.

              The  minutes  method returns the number of minutes after the hour. Without argument, the number of
              minutes is computed in reference to the UTC time. With a boolean argument set to true, the  number
              of  minutes  is computed in reference to the UTC time. If the argument is false, the local time is
              used. The returned value is the range 0 to 60.

              hours  is computed in reference to the UTC time. If the argument is false, the local time is used.
              The returned value is the range 0 to 23.

              <b>format</b> <b>-&gt;</b> <b>String</b> <b>(none|Boolean)</b>

              true, the time is computed in reference to the UTC time. If the argument is false, the local  time
              is used.

              <b>to-iso</b> <b>-&gt;</b> <b>String</b> <b>(none|Boolean)</b>
              The to-iso method returns a formatted representation of the time as specified by ISO-8601. Without
              argument,  the  time  is  computed  in reference to the local time. With a boolean argument set to
              true, the time is computed in reference to the UTC time. If the argument is false, the local  time
              is used.

              <b>to-rfc</b> <b>-&gt;</b> <b>String</b> <b>(none|Boolean)</b>
              The to-rfc method returns a formatted representation of the time as specified by RFC-2822. Without

              true, the time is computed in reference to the UTC time. If the argument is false, the local  time
              is used.

              <b>get-base-day</b> <b>-&gt;</b> <b>Integer</b> <b>(none)</b>
              The get-base-day method returns the absolute time rounded to the beginning of the day.

       <b>Date</b>
       The  Date  is  a derived class designed to manipulate dates. The date computation is based on an modified
       proleptic gregorian calendar. This proleptic feature  means  that  the  actual  calendar  (gregorian)  is
       extended  beyond year 1582 (its introduction year) and modified in order to support the year 0. This kind
       of calendar is somehow similar to the astronomical gregorian calendar except that the reference date is 0
       for special coordinated time. This method presents the advantage to support negative time. It  should  be
       noted  that  the 0 reference does not means year 1BC since year 0 did not exist at that time (the concept
       of zero is fairly new) and more important, the date expressed in the form 1BC  generally  refers  to  the
       Julian calendar since the date is before 1582. Although, the class provides several methods to access the
       individual  fields,  it  is  also possible to get a string representation that conforms to ISO-8601 or to
       RFC-2822. With 1 argument, the date is initialized with the time clock specified as an integer  argument.
       With 3 or 6 arguments, the date is expressed with its different elements.

       <b>Options</b>
       The  Options  class is a simple class used to define and retrieve user options. The object is constructed
       by specifying which option is valid and how it behaves. The arguments can be passed  to  the  object  for
       subsequent  analysis.  An  option  can  be either a unique option or a string option. In this later case,
       multiple value for the same option can be accepted. In that case, the option  is  said  to  be  a  string
       vector  option.  An  option  can be also an option list. I that case, the option is defined with a set of
       valid string. A list option is associated with a boolean flag for each string defined with that option.

              The add-vector-option method creates a new vector option.  The  option  is  defined  only  by  its
              character.  The first argument is the option character. The second argument is the option message.
              During the parsing process, a vector option have a string  argument  which  is  accumulated  in  a
              vector.

              <b>set-user-message</b> <b>-&gt;</b> <b>none</b> <b>(String)</b>
              The  set-user-message  method sets the global option user message. The user message is used by the

              detected during the parsing process, the method returns true. This method works  also  for  string
              option  or  list  option  to  indicate  if  the string has been set for that option. with a vector
              option, it is simpler to get the vector and check for the vector length. The first argument is the
              option character to use for testing.

              <b>get-string-option</b> <b>-&gt;</b> <b>String</b> <b>(Character)</b>

              sure  that  a string option has been properly set during the parsing process, it is recommended to
              use the get-unique-option method. The first argument is the option character to use for the string
              retrieval.

              <b>get-vector-option</b> <b>-&gt;</b> <b>Vector</b> <b>(Character)</b>
