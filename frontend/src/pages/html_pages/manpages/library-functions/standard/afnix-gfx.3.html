       gfx - standard graph module

</pre><h4><b>STANDARD</b> <b>GRAPH</b> <b>MODULE</b></h4><pre>
       The Standard Graph module is an original implementation dedicated to the graph modeling and manipulation.
       At  the  heart  of this module is the concept of edges and vertices. The module also provides support for
       automaton.

       <b>Graph</b> <b>concepts</b>
       The afnix-gfx module provides the support for manipulating graphs. Formally a graph is  a  collection  of
       edges  and  vertices.  In  a normal graph, an edge connects two vertices. On the other hand, a vertex can
       have several edges. When an edge connects several vertices, it is called an hyperedge and  the  resulting
       structure is called an hypergraph.

       <u>Edge</u> <u>class</u>
       The  Edge class is a class used for a graph construction in association with the Vertex class. An edge is
       used to connect vertices. Normally, an edge connects two vertices. The number of vertices attached to  an
       edge is called the cardinality of that edge. When the edge cardinality is one, the edge is called a self-
       loop.  This  mean that the edge connects the vertex to itself. This last point is merely a definition but
       present the advantage of defining an hyperedge as a set of vertices.

       <u>Vertex</u> <u>class</u>
       The Vertex is the other class used for the graph construction. and operates with the edge class. A vertex
       is used to reference edges. the number of edges referenced by a vertex  is  called  the  degree  of  that
       vertex.

       <u>Graph</u>
       The  Graph  class  is  class  that  represent  either  a graph or a hypergraph. By definition, a graph is
       collection of edges and vertices. There are numerous  property  attached  to  graph.  Formally,  a  graph
       consists  of  a set of edges, a set of vertices and the associated endpoints. However, the implementation
       is designed in a way so that each edge and vertex carry its associated objects. This method ensures  that
       the graph is fully defined by only its two sets.

       <b>Graph</b> <b>construction</b>
       The graph construction is quite simple and proceed by adding edges and vertices. The base system does not
       enforce  rules  on  the  graph  structure.  it  is  possible  to  add  con  connected vertices as well as
       unreferenced edges.

       <u>Edge</u> <u>construction</u>
       An edge is constructed by simply invoking the default constructor. Optionally, a  client  object  can  be
       attached to the edge.

       # create a default edge
       const edge (afnix:gfx:Edge)
       # create an edge with a client object
       const hello (afnix:gfx:Edge "hello")

       The  edge-p  predicate  can  be  used  to  check for the object type. When an edge is created with client
       object, the get-client method can be used to access that object.

       <u>Vertex</u> <u>construction</u>
       A vertex is constructed a way similar to the Edge&gt; object. The vertex is constructed by  simply  invoking
       the default constructor. Optionally, a client object can be attached to the edge.

       # create a default vertex
       const vrtx (afnix:gfx:Vertex)
       # create an vertex with a client object
       const world (afnix:gfx:Vertex "world")

       The  vertex-p  predicate can be used to check for the object type. When a vertex is created with a client
       object, the get-client method can be used to access that object.

       <u>Graph</u> <u>construction</u>
       A graph is constructed by simply adding edges and vertices to it. The graph-p predicate  can  be  use  to
       assert  the  graph type. the graph class also supports the concept of client object which can be attached
       at construction or with the set-client method.

       const graph (afnix:gfx:Graph)

       The add method can be used to add edges or vertices to the graph. The important point is that during  the
       construction process, the graph structure is updated with the proper number of edge and vertices.

       # create a graph
       const  g    (afnix:gfx:Graph)
       assert true (afnix:gfx:graph-p g)
       # create an edge and add vertices
       const edge (afnix:gfx:Edge)
       edge:add   (afnix:gfx:Vertex "hello")
       edge:add   (afnix:gfx:Vertex "world")
       assert 2   (edge:degree)
       # add the edge to the graph and check
       g:add edge
       assert 1 (g:number-of-edges)
       assert 2 (g:number-of-vertices)
       # check for nodes and edges
       assert true (afnix:gfx:edge-p   (g:get-edge   0))
       assert true (afnix:gfx:vertex-p (g:get-vertex 0))
       assert true (afnix:gfx:vertex-p (g:get-vertex 1))
