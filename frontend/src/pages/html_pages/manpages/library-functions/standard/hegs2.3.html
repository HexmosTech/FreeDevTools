       <b>CHEGS2</b> reduces a Hermitian definite generalized eigenproblem to standard form, using the factorization

       <b>Purpose:</b>

            CHEGS2 reduces a complex Hermitian-definite generalized
            eigenproblem to standard form.

            If ITYPE = 1, the problem is A*x = lambda*B*x,
            and A is overwritten by inv(U**H)*A*inv(U) or inv(L)*A*inv(L**H)

            If ITYPE = 2 or 3, the problem is A*B*x = lambda*x or
            B*A*x = lambda*x, and A is overwritten by U*A*U**H or L**H *A*L.
