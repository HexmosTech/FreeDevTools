       DBIx::Class::ResultSet::Pager - help when paging through sets of results

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use DBIx::Class::ResultSet::Pager;

         my $page = DBIx::Class::ResultSet::Pager-&gt;new();
         $page-&gt;total_entries($total_entries);
         $page-&gt;entries_per_page($entries_per_page);
         $page-&gt;current_page($current_page);

         print "         First page: ", $page-&gt;first_page, "\n";
         print "          Last page: ", $page-&gt;last_page, "\n";
         print "First entry on page: ", $page-&gt;first, "\n";
         print " Last entry on page: ", $page-&gt;last, "\n";

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module is a near-verbatim copy of Data::Page 2.02
        &lt;https://metacpan.org/pod/release/LBROCARD/Data-Page-2.02/lib/Data/Page.pm&gt;, which remained unchanged on
       CPAN from late 2009 through late 2019. The only differences are dropping a number of accessor generators
       in lieu of direct method implementations, and the incorporation of the lazily evaluated "total_entries"
       which was the only part originally provided by DBIx::Class::ResultSet::Pager. This module passes the
       entire contemporary test suite of Data::Page unmodified.

       <b>WHAT</b> <b>FOLLOWS</b> <b>IS</b> <b>A</b> <b>VERBATIM</b> <b>COPY</b> <b>OF</b> <b>Data::Page's</b> <b>2.02</b> <b>DOCUMENTATION</b>

       When searching through large amounts of data, it is often the case that a result set is returned that is
       larger than we want to display on one page. This results in wanting to page through various pages of
       data. The maths behind this is unfortunately fiddly, hence this module.

       The main concept is that you pass in the number of total entries, the number of entries per page, and the
       current page number. You can then call methods to find out how many pages of information there are, and
       what number the first and last entries on the current page really are.

       For example, say we wished to page through the integers from 1 to 100 with 20 entries per page. The first
       page would consist of 1-20, the second page from 21-40, the third page from 41-60, the fourth page from
       61-80 and the fifth page from 81-100. This module would help you work this out.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>new</b>
       This is the constructor, which takes no arguments.

         my $page = DBIx::Class::ResultSet::Pager-&gt;new();

       There is also an old, deprecated constructor, which currently takes two mandatory arguments, the total
       number of entries and the number of entries per page. It also optionally takes the current page number:

         my $page = DBIx::Class::ResultSet::Pager-&gt;new($total_entries, $entries_per_page, $current_page);

   <b>total_entries</b>
       This method get or sets the total number of entries:

         print "Entries:", $page-&gt;total_entries, "\n";

   <b>entries_per_page</b>
       This method gets or sets the total number of entries per page (which defaults to 10):

         print "Per page:", $page-&gt;entries_per_page, "\n";

   <b>current_page</b>
       This method gets or sets the current page number (which defaults to 1):

         print "Page: ", $page-&gt;current_page, "\n";

   <b>entries_on_this_page</b>
       This methods returns the number of entries on the current page:

         print "There are ", $page-&gt;entries_on_this_page, " entries displayed\n";

   <b>first_page</b>
       This method returns the first page. This is put in for reasons of symmetry with last_page, as it always
       returns 1:

         print "Pages range from: ", $page-&gt;first_page, "\n";

   <b>last_page</b>
       This method returns the total number of pages of information:

         print "Pages range to: ", $page-&gt;last_page, "\n";

   <b>first</b>
       This method returns the number of the first entry on the current page:

         print "Showing entries from: ", $page-&gt;first, "\n";

   <b>last</b>
       This method returns the number of the last entry on the current page:

         print "Showing entries to: ", $page-&gt;last, "\n";

   <b>previous_page</b>
       This method returns the previous page number, if one exists. Otherwise it returns undefined:

         if ($page-&gt;previous_page) {
           print "Previous page number: ", $page-&gt;previous_page, "\n";
         }

   <b>next_page</b>
       This method returns the next page number, if one exists. Otherwise it returns undefined:

         if ($page-&gt;next_page) {
           print "Next page number: ", $page-&gt;next_page, "\n";
         }

   <b>splice</b>
       This method takes in a listref, and returns only the values which are on the current page:

         @visible_holidays = $page-&gt;splice(\@holidays);

   <b>skipped</b>
       This method is useful paging through data in a database using SQL LIMIT clauses. It is simply
       $page-&gt;first - 1:

         $sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare(
           q{SELECT * FROM table ORDER BY rec_date LIMIT ?, ?}
         );
         $sth-&gt;execute($page-&gt;skipped, $page-&gt;entries_per_page);

   <b>change_entries_per_page</b>
       This method changes the number of entries per page and the current page number such that the first item
       on the current page will be present on the new page.

        $page-&gt;<a href="../man50/total_entries.50.html">total_entries</a>(50);
        $page-&gt;<a href="../man20/entries_per_page.20.html">entries_per_page</a>(20);
        $page-&gt;<a href="../man3/current_page.3.html">current_page</a>(3);
        print $page-&gt;first; # 41
        $page-&gt;<a href="../man30/change_entries_per_page.30.html">change_entries_per_page</a>(30);
        print $page-&gt;current_page; # 2 - the page that item 41 will show in

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       It has been said before that this code is "too simple" for CPAN, but I must disagree. I have seen people
       write this kind of code over and over again and they always get it wrong. Perhaps now they will spend
       more time getting the rest of their code right...

       Based on code originally by Leo Lapworth, with many changes added by by Leon Brocard &lt;<a href="mailto:acme@astray.com">acme@astray.com</a>&gt;,
       and few enhancements by James Laver (ELPENGUIN)
