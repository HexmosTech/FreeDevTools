       SDBM_File - Tied access to sdbm files

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        use Fcntl;   # For O_RDWR, O_CREAT, etc.
        use SDBM_File;

        tie(%h, 'SDBM_File', 'filename', O_RDWR|O_CREAT, 0666)
          or die "Couldn't tie SDBM file 'filename': $!; aborting";

        # Now read and change the hash
        $h{newkey} = newvalue;
        print $h{oldkey};
        ...

        untie %h;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       "SDBM_File" establishes a connection between a Perl hash variable and a file in SDBM_File format.  You
       can manipulate the data in the file just as if it were in a Perl hash, but when your program exits, the
       data will remain in the file, to be used the next time your program runs.

   <b>Tie</b>
       Use "SDBM_File" with the Perl built-in "tie" function to establish the connection between the variable
       and the file.

           tie %hash, 'SDBM_File', $basename, $modeflags, $perms;

           tie %hash, 'SDBM_File', $dirfile,  $modeflags, $perms, $pagfilename;

       $basename is the base filename for the database.  The database is two files with ".dir" and ".pag"
       extensions appended to $basename,

           $basename.dir     (or .sdbm_dir on VMS, per DIRFEXT constant)
           $basename.pag

       The two filenames can also be given separately in full as $dirfile and $pagfilename.  This suits for two
       files without ".dir" and ".pag" extensions, perhaps for example two files from File::Temp.

       $modeflags can be the following constants from the "Fcntl" module (in the style of the <b><a href="../man2/open.2.html">open</a></b>(2) system
       call),

           O_RDONLY          read-only access
           O_WRONLY          write-only access
           O_RDWR            read and write access

       If you want to create the file if it does not already exist then bitwise-OR ("|") "O_CREAT" too.  If you
       omit "O_CREAT" and the database does not already exist then the "tie" call will fail.

           O_CREAT           create database if doesn't already exist

       $perms is the file permissions bits to use if new database files are created.  This parameter is
       mandatory even when not creating a new database.  The permissions will be reduced by the user's umask so
       the usual value here would be 0666, or if some very private data then 0600.  (See "umask" in perlfunc.)

</pre><h4><b>EXPORTS</b></h4><pre>
       SDBM_File optionally exports the following constants:

       •   "PAGFEXT" - the extension used for the page file, usually ".pag".

       •   "DIRFEXT"  -  the  extension  used  for  the  directory  file, ".dir" everywhere but VMS, where it is
           ".sdbm_dir".

       •   "PAIRMAX" - the maximum size of a stored hash entry, including the length of both the key and value.

       These constants can also be used with fully qualified names, eg. "SDBM_File::PAGFEXT".

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       On failure, the "tie" call returns an undefined value and probably sets $! to contain the reason the file
       could not be tied.

   <b>"sdbm</b> <b>store</b> <b>returned</b> <b>-1,</b> <b>errno</b> <b>22,</b> <b>key</b> <b>"..."</b> <b>at</b> <b>..."</b>
       This warning is emitted when you try to store a key or a value that is  too  long.   It  means  that  the
       change was not recorded in the database.  See BUGS AND WARNINGS below.

</pre><h4><b>SECURITY</b> <b>WARNING</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Do</b> <b>not</b> <b>accept</b> <b>SDBM</b> <b>files</b> <b>from</b> <b>untrusted</b> <b>sources!</b>

       The  sdbm  file  format  was  designed  for  speed  and  convenience, not for portability or security.  A
       maliciously crafted file might cause perl to crash or even expose a security vulnerability.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>WARNINGS</b></h4><pre>
       There are a number of limits on the size of the data that you can store  in  the  SDBM  file.   The  most
       important  is  that  the  length  of  a key, plus the length of its associated value, may not exceed 1008
       bytes.
