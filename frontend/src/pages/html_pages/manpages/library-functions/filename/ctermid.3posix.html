</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       ctermid — generate a pathname for the controlling terminal

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/stdio.h">stdio.h</a>&gt;

       char *ctermid(char *<u>s</u>);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>ctermid</u>()  function  shall  generate  a  string that, when used as a pathname, refers to the current
       controlling terminal for the current process. If <u>ctermid</u>() returns a pathname, access to the file is  not
       guaranteed.

       The <u>ctermid</u>() function need not be thread-safe if called with a NULL parameter.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       If <u>s</u> is a null pointer, the string shall be generated in an area that may be static, the address of which
       shall  be  returned.  The application shall not modify the string returned. The returned pointer might be
       invalidated or the string content might be overwritten by a subsequent call to <u>ctermid</u>().   The  returned
       pointer  might also be invalidated if the calling thread is terminated.  If <u>s</u> is not a null pointer, <u>s</u> is
       assumed to point to a character array of at least L_ctermid bytes; the string is placed in this array and
       the value of <u>s</u> shall be returned. The symbolic constant L_ctermid is defined in <u>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</u>, and shall have
       a value greater than 0.

       The <u>ctermid</u>() function shall return an empty string if the pathname that would refer to  the  controlling
       terminal cannot be determined, or if the function is unsuccessful.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       No errors are defined.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Determining</b> <b>the</b> <b>Controlling</b> <b>Terminal</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Current</b> <b>Process</b>
       The  following  example  returns  a  pointer to a string that identifies the controlling terminal for the
       current process. The pathname for the terminal is stored in the array pointed to  by  the  <u>ptr</u>  argument,
       which has a size of L_ctermid bytes, as indicated by the <u>term</u> argument.

           #include &lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/stdio.h">stdio.h</a>&gt;
           ...
           char term[L_ctermid];
           char *ptr;

           ptr = ctermid(term);

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       The  difference  between  <u>ctermid</u>()  and <u>ttyname</u>() is that <u>ttyname</u>() must be handed a file descriptor and
       return a path of the terminal associated with that file descriptor,  while  <u>ctermid</u>()  returns  a  string
       (such as <b>"/dev/tty"</b>) that refers to the current controlling terminal if used as a pathname.

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       L_ctermid  must be defined appropriately for a given implementation and must be greater than zero so that
       array declarations using it are accepted by the compiler. The value includes the terminating null byte.

       Conforming applications that use multiple threads cannot call <u>ctermid</u>() with NULL as the parameter. If  <u>s</u>
       is  not  NULL,  the  <u>ctermid</u>()  function  generates a string that, when used as a pathname, refers to the
       current controlling terminal for the current process. If <u>s</u> is NULL, the  return  value  of  <u>ctermid</u>()  is
       undefined.

       There  is  no  additional  burden on the programmer—changing to use a hypothetical thread-safe version of
       <u>ctermid</u>() along with allocating a buffer is more of a burden than merely allocating a buffer. Application
       code should not assume that the returned string is short, as some  implementations  have  more  than  two
       pathname components before reaching a logical device name.

</pre><h4><b>FUTURE</b> <b>DIRECTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
