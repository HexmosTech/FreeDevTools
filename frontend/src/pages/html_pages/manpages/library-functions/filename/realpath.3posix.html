</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       realpath — resolve a pathname

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/stdlib.h">stdlib.h</a>&gt;

       char *realpath(const char *restrict <u>file_name</u>,
           char *restrict <u>resolved_name</u>);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>realpath</u>()  function  shall  derive, from the pathname pointed to by <u>file_name</u>, an absolute pathname
       that resolves to the same directory entry, whose resolution does  not  involve  <b>'.'</b>,  <b>'..'</b>,  or  symbolic
       links.  If  <u>resolved_name</u>  is a null pointer, the generated pathname shall be stored as a null-terminated
       string in a buffer allocated as if by a call to <u>malloc</u>().  Otherwise,  if  {PATH_MAX}  is  defined  as  a
       constant  in  the  <u>&lt;limits.h&gt;</u>  header,  then  the generated pathname shall be stored as a null-terminated
       string, up to a maximum of {PATH_MAX} bytes, in the buffer pointed to by <u>resolved_name</u>.

       If <u>resolved_name</u> is not a null pointer and {PATH_MAX} is not defined as  a  constant  in  the  <u>&lt;limits.h&gt;</u>
       header, the behavior is undefined.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       Upon successful completion, <u>realpath</u>() shall return a pointer to the buffer containing the resolved name.
       Otherwise, <u>realpath</u>() shall return a null pointer and set <u>errno</u> to indicate the error.

       If  the  <u>resolved_name</u>  argument  is  a null pointer, the pointer returned by <u>realpath</u>() can be passed to
       <u>free</u>().

       If the <u>resolved_name</u> argument is not a null pointer and the <u>realpath</u>() function fails,  the  contents  of
       the buffer pointed to by <u>resolved_name</u> are undefined.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>realpath</u>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EACCES</b> Search permission was denied for a component of the path prefix of <u>file_name</u>.

       <b>EINVAL</b> The <u>file_name</u> argument is a null pointer.

       <b>EIO</b>    An error occurred while reading from the file system.

       <b>ELOOP</b>  A loop exists in symbolic links encountered during resolution of the <u>file_name</u> argument.

       <b>ENAMETOOLONG</b>
              The length of a component of a pathname is longer than {NAME_MAX}.

       <b>ENOENT</b> A component of <u>file_name</u> does not name an existing file or <u>file_name</u> points to an empty string.

       <b>ENOTDIR</b>
              A  component  of the path prefix names an existing file that is neither a directory nor a symbolic
              link to a directory, or the <u>file_name</u> argument contains at least  one  non-&lt;slash&gt;  character  and
              ends  with  one  or  more  trailing  &lt;slash&gt;  characters  and the last pathname component names an
              existing file that is neither a directory nor a symbolic link to a directory.

       The <u>realpath</u>() function may fail if:

       <b>EACCES</b> The <u>file_name</u> argument does not begin with a &lt;slash&gt; and none  of  the  symbolic  links  (if  any)
              processed  during  pathname  resolution  of  <u>file_name</u> had contents that began with a &lt;slash&gt;, and
              either search permission was denied for the current directory or read  or  search  permission  was
              denied for a directory above the current directory in the file hierarchy.

       <b>ELOOP</b>  More  than  {SYMLOOP_MAX}  symbolic  links  were  encountered  during  resolution of the <u>file_name</u>
              argument.

       <b>ENAMETOOLONG</b>
              The length of a pathname exceeds {PATH_MAX}, or pathname resolution of a symbolic link produced an
              intermediate result with a length that exceeds {PATH_MAX}.

       <b>ENOMEM</b> Insufficient storage space is available.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Generating</b> <b>an</b> <b>Absolute</b> <b>Pathname</b>
       The following example generates an absolute pathname for the file identified by the <u>symlinkpath</u> argument.
       The generated pathname is stored in the buffer pointed to by <u>actualpath</u>.

           #include &lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/stdlib.h">stdlib.h</a>&gt;
           ...
           char *symlinkpath = "/tmp/symlink/file";
           char *actualpath;

           actualpath = realpath(symlinkpath, NULL);
           if (actualpath != NULL)
           {
               ... use actualpath ...

               free(actualpath);
           }
           else
           {
               ... handle error ...
           }

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       For functions that allocate memory as if by <u>malloc</u>(), the application should release such memory when  it
       is no longer required by a call to <u>free</u>().  For <u>realpath</u>(), this is the return value.

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       Since  <u>realpath</u>()  has  no  <u>length</u>  argument,  if  {PATH_MAX} is not defined as a constant in <u>&lt;limits.h&gt;</u>,
       applications have no way of determining how large a buffer they need to allocate for it  to  be  safe  to
       pass  to <u>realpath</u>().  A {PATH_MAX} value obtained from a prior <u>pathconf</u>() call is out-of-date by the time
       <u>realpath</u>() is called. Hence the only reliable way to use <u>realpath</u>() when {PATH_MAX}  is  not  defined  in
       <u>&lt;limits.h&gt;</u>  is  to pass a null pointer for <u>resolved_name</u> so that <u>realpath</u>() will allocate a buffer of the
       necessary size.

</pre><h4><b>FUTURE</b> <b>DIRECTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       None.
