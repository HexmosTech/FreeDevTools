</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Many online services that are centered around CPAN attempt to associate multiple uploads by extracting a
       distribution name from the filename of the upload. For most distributions this is easy as they have used
       ExtUtils::MakeMaker or Module::Build to create the distribution, which results in a uniform name. But
       sadly not all uploads are created in this way.

       "CPAN::DistnameInfo" uses heuristics that have been learnt by &lt;<a href="http://search.cpan.org/">http://search.cpan.org/</a>&gt; to extract the
       distribution name and version from filenames and also report if the version is to be treated as a
       developer release

       The constructor takes a single pathname, returning an object with the following methods

       cpanid
           If the path given looked like a CPAN authors directory path, then this will be the the CPAN id of the
           author.

       dist
           The name of the distribution

       distvname
           The file name with any suffix and leading directory names removed

       filename
           If  the  path given looked like a CPAN authors directory path, then this will be the path to the file
           relative to the detected CPAN author directory. Otherwise it is the path that was passed in.

       maturity
           The maturity of the distribution. This will be either "released" or "developer"

       extension
           The extension of the distribution, often used to denote the archive type (e.g. 'tar.gz')

       pathname
           The pathname that was passed to the constructor when creating the object.

       properties
           This will return a list of key-value  pairs,  suitable  for  assigning  to  a  hash,  for  the  known
           properties.

       version
           The extracted version
