</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       App::Cmd::Simple - a helper for building one-command App::Cmd applications

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 0.337

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       in <u>simplecmd</u>:

         use YourApp::Cmd;
         Your::Cmd-&gt;run;

       in <u>YourApp/Cmd.pm</u>:

         package YourApp::Cmd 0.01;
         use parent qw(App::Cmd::Simple);

         sub opt_spec {
           return (
             [ "blortex|X",  "use the blortex algorithm" ],
             [ "recheck|r",  "recheck all results"       ],
           );
         }

         sub validate_args {
           my ($self, $opt, $args) = @_;

           # no args allowed but options!
           $self-&gt;usage_error("No args allowed") if @$args;
         }

         sub execute {
           my ($self, $opt, $args) = @_;

           my $result = $opt-&gt;{blortex} ? blortex() : blort();

           recheck($result) if $opt-&gt;{recheck};

           print $result;
         }

       and, finally, at the command line:

         knight!rjbs$ simplecmd --recheck

         All blorts successful.

</pre><h4><b>PERL</b> <b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This library should run on perls released even a long time ago.  It should work on any version of perl
       released in the last five years.

       Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made that the minimum required version
       will not be increased.  The version may be increased for any reason, and there is no promise that patches
       will be accepted to lower the minimum required perl.

</pre><h4><b>SUBCLASSING</b></h4><pre>
       When writing a subclass of App::Cmd:Simple, there are only a few methods that you might want to
       implement.  They behave just like the same-named methods in App::Cmd.

   <b>opt_spec</b>
       This method should be overridden to provide option specifications.  (This is list of arguments passed to
       "describe_options" from Getopt::Long::Descriptive, after the first.)

       If not overridden, it returns an empty list.

   <b>usage_desc</b>
       This method should be overridden to provide the top level usage line.  It's a one-line summary of how the
       command is to be invoked, and should be given in the format used for the $usage_desc parameter to
       "describe_options" in Getopt::Long::Descriptive.

       If not overridden, it returns something that prints out like:

         yourapp [-?h] [long options...]

   <b>validate_args</b>
         $cmd-&gt;validate_args(\%opt, \@args);

       This method is passed a hashref of command line options (as processed by Getopt::Long::Descriptive) and
       an arrayref of leftover arguments.  It may throw an exception (preferably by calling "usage_error") if
       they are invalid, or it may do nothing to allow processing to continue.

   <b>execute</b>
         Your::App::Cmd::Simple-&gt;execute(\%opt, \@args);

       This method does whatever it is the command should do!  It is passed a hash reference of the parsed
       command-line options and an array reference of left over arguments.

</pre><h4><b>WARNINGS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>This</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> <b>experimental!</b>  Although it is probably not going to change much, don't build
       your business model around it yet, okay?

       App::Cmd::Simple is not rich in black magic, but it does do some somewhat gnarly things to make an
       App::Cmd::Simple look as much like an App::Cmd::Command as possible.  This means that you can't deviate
       too much from the sort of thing shown in the synopsis as you might like.  If you're doing something other
       than writing a fairly simple command, and you want to screw around with the App::Cmd-iness of your
       program, Simple might not be the best choice.

       <b>One</b> <b>specific</b> <b>warning...</b>  if you are writing a program with the App::Cmd::Simple class embedded in it, you
       <b>must</b> call import on the class.  That's how things work.  You can just do this:

         YourApp::Cmd-&gt;import-&gt;run;
