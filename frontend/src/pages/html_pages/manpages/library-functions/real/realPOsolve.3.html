        <b>SPOSV</b> <b>computes</b> <b>the</b> <b>solution</b> <b>to</b> <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>linear</b> <b>equations</b> <b>A</b> <b>*</b> <b>X</b> <b>=</b> <b>B</b> <b>for</b> <b>PO</b> <b>matrices</b>

       <b>Purpose:</b>

            SPOSV computes the solution to a real system of linear equations
               A * X = B,
            where A is an N-by-N symmetric positive definite matrix and X and B
            are N-by-NRHS matrices.

            The Cholesky decomposition is used to factor A as
               A = U**T* U,  if UPLO = 'U', or
               A = L * L**T,  if UPLO = 'L',
            where U is an upper triangular matrix and L is a lower triangular
            matrix.  The factored form of A is then used to solve the system of
            equations A * X = B.

       <b>Parameters</b>

                     UPLO is CHARACTER*1

                     = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.

           <u>N</u>

                     N is INTEGER

                     N-by-N upper triangular part of A contains the upper
                     triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly lower
                     triangular part of A is not referenced.  If UPLO = 'L', the
                     leading N-by-N lower triangular part of A contains the lower
                     triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly upper
                     triangular part of A is not referenced.

                     On exit, if INFO = 0, the factor U or L from the Cholesky
                     factorization A = U**T*U or A = L*L**T.

                     On exit, if INFO = 0, the N-by-NRHS solution matrix X.

           <u>LDB</u>

                     LDB is INTEGER
                     The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB &gt;= max(1,N).

                     INFO is INTEGER
                     = 0:  successful exit
                     &lt; 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
                     &gt; 0:  if INFO = i, the leading minor of order i of A is not
                           positive definite, so the factorization could not be
                           completed, and the solution has not been computed.

        <b>SPOSVX</b> <b>computes</b> <b>the</b> <b>solution</b> <b>to</b> <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>linear</b> <b>equations</b> <b>A</b> <b>*</b> <b>X</b> <b>=</b> <b>B</b> <b>for</b> <b>PO</b> <b>matrices</b>

       <b>Purpose:</b>

            SPOSVX uses the Cholesky factorization A = U**T*U or A = L*L**T to
            compute the solution to a real system of linear equations
               A * X = B,
            where A is an N-by-N symmetric positive definite matrix and X and B
            are N-by-NRHS matrices.

            Error bounds on the solution and a condition estimate are also
            provided.

       <b>Description:</b>

            The following steps are performed:

            1. If FACT = 'E', real scaling factors are computed to equilibrate
               the system:
                  diag(S) * A * diag(S) * inv(diag(S)) * X = diag(S) * B
               Whether or not the system will be equilibrated depends on the
               scaling of the matrix A, but if equilibration is used, A is
               overwritten by diag(S)*A*diag(S) and B by diag(S)*B.

            2. If FACT = 'N' or 'E', the Cholesky decomposition is used to
               factor the matrix A (after equilibration if FACT = 'E') as
                  A = U**T* U,  if UPLO = 'U', or
                  A = L * L**T,  if UPLO = 'L',
               where U is an upper triangular matrix and L is a lower triangular
               matrix.

            3. If the leading i-by-i principal minor is not positive definite,
               then the routine returns with INFO = i. Otherwise, the factored
               form of A is used to estimate the condition number of the matrix
               A.  If the reciprocal of the condition number is less than machine
               precision, INFO = N+1 is returned as a warning, but the routine
               still goes on to solve for X and compute error bounds as
               described below.

            4. The system of equations is solved for X using the factored form
               of A.

            5. Iterative refinement is applied to improve the computed solution
               matrix and calculate error bounds and backward error estimates
               for it.

            6. If equilibration was used, the matrix X is premultiplied by
               diag(S) so that it solves the original system before
               equilibration.

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>FACT</u>

                     FACT is CHARACTER*1
                     Specifies whether or not the factored form of the matrix A is
                     supplied on entry, and if not, whether the matrix A should be
                     equilibrated before it is factored.
                     = 'F':  On entry, AF contains the factored form of A.
                             If EQUED = 'Y', the matrix A has been equilibrated
                             with scaling factors given by S.  A and AF will not
                             be modified.
                     = 'N':  The matrix A will be copied to AF and factored.
                     = 'E':  The matrix A will be equilibrated if necessary, then
                             copied to AF and factored.

                     A is REAL array, dimension (LDA,N)

                     diag(S)*A*diag(S).  If UPLO = 'U', the leading
                     N-by-N upper triangular part of A contains the upper
                     triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly lower

                     triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly upper
                     triangular part of A is not referenced.  A is not modified if
                     FACT = 'F' or 'N', or if FACT = 'E' and EQUED = 'N' on exit.

                     On exit, if FACT = 'E' and EQUED = 'Y', A is overwritten by

                     format as A.  If EQUED .ne. 'N', then AF is the factored form
                     of the equilibrated matrix diag(S)*A*diag(S).

                     If FACT = 'N', then AF is an output argument and on exit

                     factorization A = U**T*U or A = L*L**T of the original
                     matrix A.

                     returns the triangular factor U or L from the Cholesky
                     factorization A = U**T*U or A = L*L**T of the equilibrated
                     matrix A (see the description of A for the form of the

                     = 'N':  No equilibration (always true if FACT = 'N').
                     = 'Y':  Equilibration was done, i.e., A has been replaced by
                             diag(S) * A * diag(S).
                     EQUED is an input argument if FACT = 'F'; otherwise, it is an
                     output argument.

           <u>S</u>

                     S is REAL array, dimension (N)
                     The scale factors for A; not accessed if EQUED = 'N'.  S is
                     an input argument if FACT = 'F'; otherwise, S is an output
                     argument.  If FACT = 'F' and EQUED = 'Y', each element of S
                     must be positive.

                     the original system of equations.  Note that if EQUED = 'Y',
                     A and B are modified on exit, and the solution to the
                     equilibrated system is inv(diag(S))*X.

           <u>LDX</u>

                     LDX is INTEGER
                     The leading dimension of the array X.  LDX &gt;= max(1,N).

                     The estimate of the reciprocal condition number of the matrix
                     A after equilibration (if done).  If RCOND is less than the
                     machine precision (in particular, if RCOND = 0), the matrix
                     is singular to working precision.  This condition is
                     indicated by a return code of INFO &gt; 0.

           <u>FERR</u>

                     FERR is REAL array, dimension (NRHS)
                     The estimated forward error bound for each solution vector
                     X(j) (the j-th column of the solution matrix X).
                     If XTRUE is the true solution corresponding to X(j), FERR(j)
                     is an estimated upper bound for the magnitude of the largest
                     element in (X(j) - XTRUE) divided by the magnitude of the
                     largest element in X(j).  The estimate is as reliable as
                     the estimate for RCOND, and is almost always a slight
                     overestimate of the true error.

           <u>BERR</u>

                     BERR is REAL array, dimension (NRHS)
                     The componentwise relative backward error of each solution
                     vector X(j) (i.e., the smallest relative change in
                     any element of A or B that makes X(j) an exact solution).

           <u>WORK</u>

                     WORK is REAL array, dimension (3*N)

           <u>IWORK</u>

                     INFO is INTEGER
                     = 0: successful exit
                     &lt; 0: if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
                     &gt; 0: if INFO = i, and i is
                           &lt;= N:  the leading minor of order i of A is
                                  not positive definite, so the factorization
                                  could not be completed, and the solution has not
                                  been computed. RCOND = 0 is returned.
                           = N+1: U is nonsingular, but RCOND is less than machine
                                  precision, meaning that the matrix is singular
                                  to working precision.  Nevertheless, the
                                  solution and error bounds are computed because
                                  there are a number of situations where the
                                  computed solution can be more accurate than the
                                  value of RCOND would suggest.

       <b>Purpose:</b>

               SPOSVXX uses the Cholesky factorization A = U**T*U or A = L*L**T
               to compute the solution to a real system of linear equations
               A * X = B, where A is an N-by-N symmetric positive definite matrix
               and X and B are N-by-NRHS matrices.

               If requested, both normwise and maximum componentwise error bounds
               are returned. SPOSVXX will return a solution with a tiny
               guaranteed error (O(eps) where eps is the working machine
               precision) unless the matrix is very ill-conditioned, in which
               case a warning is returned. Relevant condition numbers also are
               calculated and returned.

               SPOSVXX accepts user-provided factorizations and equilibration
               factors; see the definitions of the FACT and EQUED options.
               Solving with refinement and using a factorization from a previous
               SPOSVXX call will also produce a solution with either O(eps)
               errors or warnings, but we cannot make that claim for general
               user-provided factorizations and equilibration factors if they
               differ from what SPOSVXX would itself produce.

       <b>Description:</b>

               The following steps are performed:

               1. If FACT = 'E', real scaling factors are computed to equilibrate
               the system:

                 diag(S)*A*diag(S)     *inv(diag(S))*X = diag(S)*B

               Whether or not the system will be equilibrated depends on the
               scaling of the matrix A, but if equilibration is used, A is
               overwritten by diag(S)*A*diag(S) and B by diag(S)*B.

               2. If FACT = 'N' or 'E', the Cholesky decomposition is used to
               factor the matrix A (after equilibration if FACT = 'E') as
                  A = U**T* U,  if UPLO = 'U', or
                  A = L * L**T,  if UPLO = 'L',
               where U is an upper triangular matrix and L is a lower triangular
               matrix.

               3. If the leading i-by-i principal minor is not positive definite,
               then the routine returns with INFO = i. Otherwise, the factored
               form of A is used to estimate the condition number of the matrix
               A (see argument RCOND).  If the reciprocal of the condition number
               is less than machine precision, the routine still goes on to solve
               for X and compute error bounds as described below.

               4. The system of equations is solved for X using the factored form
               of A.

               5. By default (unless PARAMS(LA_LINRX_ITREF_I) is set to zero),
               the routine will use iterative refinement to try to get a small
               error and error bounds.  Refinement calculates the residual to at
               least twice the working precision.

               6. If equilibration was used, the matrix X is premultiplied by
               diag(S) so that it solves the original system before
               equilibration.

                Some optional parameters are bundled in the PARAMS array.  These
                settings determine how refinement is performed, but often the
                defaults are acceptable.  If the defaults are acceptable, users
                can pass NPARAMS = 0 which prevents the source code from accessing
                the PARAMS argument.

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>FACT</u>

                     FACT is CHARACTER*1
                Specifies whether or not the factored form of the matrix A is
                supplied on entry, and if not, whether the matrix A should be
                equilibrated before it is factored.
                  = 'F':  On entry, AF contains the factored form of A.
                          If EQUED is not 'N', the matrix A has been
                          equilibrated with scaling factors given by S.
                          A and AF are not modified.
                  = 'N':  The matrix A will be copied to AF and factored.
                  = 'E':  The matrix A will be equilibrated if necessary, then
                          copied to AF and factored.

           <u>UPLO</u>

                     UPLO is CHARACTER*1
                  = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;
                  = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.

           <u>N</u>

                     N is INTEGER
                The number of linear equations, i.e., the order of the
                matrix A.  N &gt;= 0.

           <u>NRHS</u>

                     NRHS is INTEGER
                The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns
                of the matrices B and X.  NRHS &gt;= 0.

           <u>A</u>

                     A is REAL array, dimension (LDA,N)
                On entry, the symmetric matrix A, except if FACT = 'F' and EQUED =
                'Y', then A must contain the equilibrated matrix
                diag(S)*A*diag(S).  If UPLO = 'U', the leading N-by-N upper
                triangular part of A contains the upper triangular part of the
                matrix A, and the strictly lower triangular part of A is not
                referenced.  If UPLO = 'L', the leading N-by-N lower triangular
                part of A contains the lower triangular part of the matrix A, and
                the strictly upper triangular part of A is not referenced.  A is
                not modified if FACT = 'F' or 'N', or if FACT = 'E' and EQUED =
                'N' on exit.

                On exit, if FACT = 'E' and EQUED = 'Y', A is overwritten by
                diag(S)*A*diag(S).

           <u>LDA</u>

                     LDA is INTEGER
                The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA &gt;= max(1,N).

           <u>AF</u>

                     AF is REAL array, dimension (LDAF,N)
                If FACT = 'F', then AF is an input argument and on entry
                contains the triangular factor U or L from the Cholesky
                factorization A = U**T*U or A = L*L**T, in the same storage
                format as A.  If EQUED .ne. 'N', then AF is the factored
                form of the equilibrated matrix diag(S)*A*diag(S).

                If FACT = 'N', then AF is an output argument and on exit
                returns the triangular factor U or L from the Cholesky
                factorization A = U**T*U or A = L*L**T of the original
                matrix A.

                If FACT = 'E', then AF is an output argument and on exit
                returns the triangular factor U or L from the Cholesky
                factorization A = U**T*U or A = L*L**T of the equilibrated
                matrix A (see the description of A for the form of the
                equilibrated matrix).

           <u>LDAF</u>

                     LDAF is INTEGER
                The leading dimension of the array AF.  LDAF &gt;= max(1,N).

           <u>EQUED</u>

                     EQUED is CHARACTER*1
                Specifies the form of equilibration that was done.
                  = 'N':  No equilibration (always true if FACT = 'N').
                  = 'Y':  Both row and column equilibration, i.e., A has been
                          replaced by diag(S) * A * diag(S).
                EQUED is an input argument if FACT = 'F'; otherwise, it is an
                output argument.

           <u>S</u>

                     S is REAL array, dimension (N)
                The row scale factors for A.  If EQUED = 'Y', A is multiplied on
                the left and right by diag(S).  S is an input argument if FACT =
                'F'; otherwise, S is an output argument.  If FACT = 'F' and EQUED
                = 'Y', each element of S must be positive.  If S is output, each
                element of S is a power of the radix. If S is input, each element
                of S should be a power of the radix to ensure a reliable solution
                and error estimates. Scaling by powers of the radix does not cause
                rounding errors unless the result underflows or overflows.
                Rounding errors during scaling lead to refining with a matrix that
                is not equivalent to the input matrix, producing error estimates
                that may not be reliable.

           <u>B</u>

                     B is REAL array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
                On entry, the N-by-NRHS right hand side matrix B.
                On exit,
                if EQUED = 'N', B is not modified;
                if EQUED = 'Y', B is overwritten by diag(S)*B;

           <u>LDB</u>

                     LDB is INTEGER
                The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB &gt;= max(1,N).

           <u>X</u>

                     X is REAL array, dimension (LDX,NRHS)
                If INFO = 0, the N-by-NRHS solution matrix X to the original
                system of equations.  Note that A and B are modified on exit if
                EQUED .ne. 'N', and the solution to the equilibrated system is
                inv(diag(S))*X.

           <u>LDX</u>

                     LDX is INTEGER
                The leading dimension of the array X.  LDX &gt;= max(1,N).

           <u>RCOND</u>

                     RCOND is REAL
                Reciprocal scaled condition number.  This is an estimate of the
                reciprocal Skeel condition number of the matrix A after
                equilibration (if done).  If this is less than the machine
                precision (in particular, if it is zero), the matrix is singular
                to working precision.  Note that the error may still be small even
                if this number is very small and the matrix appears ill-
                conditioned.

           <u>RPVGRW</u>

                     RPVGRW is REAL
                Reciprocal pivot growth.  On exit, this contains the reciprocal
                pivot growth factor norm(A)/norm(U). The "max absolute element"
                norm is used.  If this is much less than 1, then the stability of
                the LU factorization of the (equilibrated) matrix A could be poor.
                This also means that the solution X, estimated condition numbers,
                and error bounds could be unreliable. If factorization fails with
                0&lt;INFO&lt;=N, then this contains the reciprocal pivot growth factor
                for the leading INFO columns of A.

           <u>BERR</u>

                     BERR is REAL array, dimension (NRHS)
                Componentwise relative backward error.  This is the
                componentwise relative backward error of each solution vector X(j)
                (i.e., the smallest relative change in any element of A or B that
                makes X(j) an exact solution).

           <u>N_ERR_BNDS</u>

                     N_ERR_BNDS is INTEGER
                Number of error bounds to return for each right hand side
                and each type (normwise or componentwise).  See ERR_BNDS_NORM and
                ERR_BNDS_COMP below.

           <u>ERR_BNDS_NORM</u>

                     ERR_BNDS_NORM is REAL array, dimension (NRHS, N_ERR_BNDS)
                For each right-hand side, this array contains information about
                various error bounds and condition numbers corresponding to the
                normwise relative error, which is defined as follows:

                Normwise relative error in the ith solution vector:
                        max_j (abs(XTRUE(j,i) - X(j,i)))
                       ------------------------------
                             max_j abs(X(j,i))

                The array is indexed by the type of error information as described
                below. There currently are up to three pieces of information
                returned.

                The first index in ERR_BNDS_NORM(i,:) corresponds to the ith
                right-hand side.

                The second index in ERR_BNDS_NORM(:,err) contains the following
                three fields:
                err = 1 "Trust/don't trust" boolean. Trust the answer if the
                         reciprocal condition number is less than the threshold
                         sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon').

                err = 2 "Guaranteed" error bound: The estimated forward error,
                         almost certainly within a factor of 10 of the true error
                         so long as the next entry is greater than the threshold
                         sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon'). This error bound should only
                         be trusted if the previous boolean is true.

                err = 3  Reciprocal condition number: Estimated normwise
                         reciprocal condition number.  Compared with the threshold
                         sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon') to determine if the error
                         estimate is "guaranteed". These reciprocal condition
                         numbers are 1 / (norm(Z^{-1},inf) * norm(Z,inf)) for some
                         appropriately scaled matrix Z.
                         Let Z = S*A, where S scales each row by a power of the
                         radix so all absolute row sums of Z are approximately 1.

                See Lapack Working Note 165 for further details and extra
                cautions.

           <u>ERR_BNDS_COMP</u>

                     ERR_BNDS_COMP is REAL array, dimension (NRHS, N_ERR_BNDS)
                For each right-hand side, this array contains information about
                various error bounds and condition numbers corresponding to the
                componentwise relative error, which is defined as follows:

                Componentwise relative error in the ith solution vector:
                               abs(XTRUE(j,i) - X(j,i))
                        max_j ----------------------
                                    abs(X(j,i))

                The array is indexed by the right-hand side i (on which the
                componentwise relative error depends), and the type of error
                information as described below. There currently are up to three
                pieces of information returned for each right-hand side. If
                componentwise accuracy is not requested (<a href="../man3/PARAMS.3.html">PARAMS</a>(3) = 0.0), then
                ERR_BNDS_COMP is not accessed.  If N_ERR_BNDS &lt; 3, then at most
                the first (:,N_ERR_BNDS) entries are returned.

                The first index in ERR_BNDS_COMP(i,:) corresponds to the ith
                right-hand side.

                The second index in ERR_BNDS_COMP(:,err) contains the following
                three fields:
                err = 1 "Trust/don't trust" boolean. Trust the answer if the
                         reciprocal condition number is less than the threshold
                         sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon').

                err = 2 "Guaranteed" error bound: The estimated forward error,
                         almost certainly within a factor of 10 of the true error
                         so long as the next entry is greater than the threshold
                         sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon'). This error bound should only
                         be trusted if the previous boolean is true.

                err = 3  Reciprocal condition number: Estimated componentwise
                         reciprocal condition number.  Compared with the threshold
                         sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon') to determine if the error
                         estimate is "guaranteed". These reciprocal condition
                         numbers are 1 / (norm(Z^{-1},inf) * norm(Z,inf)) for some
                         appropriately scaled matrix Z.
                         Let Z = S*(A*diag(x)), where x is the solution for the
                         current right-hand side and S scales each row of
                         A*diag(x) by a power of the radix so all absolute row
                         sums of Z are approximately 1.

                See Lapack Working Note 165 for further details and extra
                cautions.

           <u>NPARAMS</u>

                     NPARAMS is INTEGER
                Specifies the number of parameters set in PARAMS.  If &lt;= 0, the
                PARAMS array is never referenced and default values are used.

           <u>PARAMS</u>

                     PARAMS is REAL array, dimension NPARAMS
                Specifies algorithm parameters.  If an entry is &lt; 0.0, then
                that entry will be filled with default value used for that
                parameter.  Only positions up to NPARAMS are accessed; defaults
                are used for higher-numbered parameters.

                  PARAMS(LA_LINRX_ITREF_I = 1) : Whether to perform iterative
                       refinement or not.
                    Default: 1.0
                       = 0.0:  No refinement is performed, and no error bounds are
                               computed.
                       = 1.0:  Use the double-precision refinement algorithm,
                               possibly with doubled-single computations if the
                               compilation environment does not support DOUBLE
                               PRECISION.
                         (other values are reserved for future use)

                  PARAMS(LA_LINRX_ITHRESH_I = 2) : Maximum number of residual
                       computations allowed for refinement.
                    Default: 10
                    Aggressive: Set to 100 to permit convergence using approximate
                                factorizations or factorizations other than LU. If
                                the factorization uses a technique other than
                                Gaussian elimination, the guarantees in
                                err_bnds_norm and err_bnds_comp may no longer be
                                trustworthy.

                  PARAMS(LA_LINRX_CWISE_I = 3) : Flag determining if the code
                       will attempt to find a solution with small componentwise
                       relative error in the double-precision algorithm.  Positive
                       is true, 0.0 is false.
                    Default: 1.0 (attempt componentwise convergence)

           <u>WORK</u>

                     WORK is REAL array, dimension (4*N)

           <u>IWORK</u>

                     IWORK is INTEGER array, dimension (N)

           <u>INFO</u>

                     INFO is INTEGER
                  = 0:  Successful exit. The solution to every right-hand side is
                    guaranteed.
                  &lt; 0:  If INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
                  &gt; 0 and &lt;= N:  U(INFO,INFO) is exactly zero.  The factorization
                    has been completed, but the factor U is exactly singular, so
                    the solution and error bounds could not be computed. RCOND = 0
                    is returned.
                  = N+J: The solution corresponding to the Jth right-hand side is
                    not guaranteed. The solutions corresponding to other right-
                    hand sides K with K &gt; J may not be guaranteed as well, but
                    only the first such right-hand side is reported. If a small
                    componentwise error is not requested (<a href="../man3/PARAMS.3.html">PARAMS</a>(3) = 0.0) then
                    the Jth right-hand side is the first with a normwise error
                    bound that is not guaranteed (the smallest J such
                    that ERR_BNDS_NORM(J,1) = 0.0). By default (<a href="../man3/PARAMS.3.html">PARAMS</a>(3) = 1.0)
                    the Jth right-hand side is the first with either a normwise or
                    componentwise error bound that is not guaranteed (the smallest
                    J such that either ERR_BNDS_NORM(J,1) = 0.0 or
                    ERR_BNDS_COMP(J,1) = 0.0). See the definition of
                    ERR_BNDS_NORM(:,1) and ERR_BNDS_COMP(:,1). To get information
                    about all of the right-hand sides check ERR_BNDS_NORM or
                    ERR_BNDS_COMP.
