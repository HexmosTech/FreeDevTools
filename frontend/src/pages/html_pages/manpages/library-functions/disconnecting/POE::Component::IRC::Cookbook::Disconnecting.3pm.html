       POE::Component::IRC::Cookbook::Disconnecting - How to disconnect gracefully with PoCo-IRC

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       Shutting down an IRC bot can be quick and messy, or slow and graceful.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       There are two ways you can shut down an IRC bot/client. The quick and dirty way is rather simple:

        exit;

       It exits the program, shutting down the socket, and everybody online sees yet another "Connection reset
       by peer" or "Remote end closed the socket" or something.

       As of version 6.50, all you need to do in order to shut down gracefully is to send a "shutdown" event to
       the IRC component.  It will make sure your quit message (if any) gets delivered, and will forcibly
       disconnect if there are any problems (faulty server or network issues). After doing this, it will
       unregister all sessions and clean up after itself.

       If you want to do something more elaborate on your own, take a look at the following documentation:
       logged in, "connected", "quit", "disconnect", and "unregister".
