</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       cproj, cprojf, cprojl — complex projection functions

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/complex.h">complex.h</a>&gt;

       double complex cproj(double complex <u>z</u>);
       float complex cprojf(float complex <u>z</u>);
       long double complex cprojl(long double complex <u>z</u>);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  functionality  described  on  this  reference  page is aligned with the ISO C standard. Any conflict
       between the requirements described  here  and  the  ISO C  standard  is  unintentional.  This  volume  of
       POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO C standard.

       These functions shall compute a projection of <u>z</u> onto the Riemann sphere: <u>z</u> projects to <u>z</u>, except that all
       complex  infinities  (even those with one infinite part and one NaN part) project to positive infinity on
       the real axis. If <u>z</u> has an infinite part, then <u>cproj</u>(<u>z</u>) shall be equivalent to:

           INFINITY + I * copysign(0.0, cimag(z))

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       These functions shall return the value of the projection onto the Riemann sphere.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       No errors are defined.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       Two topologies are commonly used in  complex  mathematics:  the  complex  plane  with  its  continuum  of
       infinities,  and  the  Riemann  sphere  with  its single infinity. The complex plane is better suited for
       transcendental functions, the Riemann sphere for  algebraic  functions.  The  complex  types  with  their
       multiplicity  of  infinities provide a useful (though imperfect) model for the complex plane. The <u>cproj</u>()
       function helps model the Riemann sphere by mapping all infinities to one, and should be used just  before
       any  operation, especially comparisons, that might give spurious results for any of the other infinities.
       Note that a complex value with one infinite part and one NaN part is regarded as an infinity, not a  NaN,
       because  if  one  part  is  infinite, the complex value is infinite independent of the value of the other
       part. For the same reason, <u>cabs</u>() returns an infinity if its argument has an  infinite  part  and  a  NaN
       part.
