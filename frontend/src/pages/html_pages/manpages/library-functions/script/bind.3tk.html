</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       bind - Arrange for X events to invoke Tcl scripts

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>bind</b> <u>tag</u> ?<u>sequence</u>? ?<b>+</b>??<u>script</u>?
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

</pre><h4><b>INTRODUCTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>bind</b>  command associates Tcl scripts with X events.  If all three arguments are specified, <b>bind</b> will
       arrange for <u>script</u> (a Tcl script called the “binding script”) to be evaluated whenever the event(s) given
       by <u>sequence</u> occur in the window(s) identified by <u>tag</u>.  If <u>script</u> is prefixed  with  a  “+”,  then  it  is
       appended  to  any  existing  binding  for  <u>sequence</u>;  otherwise <u>script</u> replaces any existing binding.  If
       <u>script</u> is an empty string then the current binding for <u>sequence</u> is destroyed, leaving  <u>sequence</u>  unbound.
       In all of the cases where a <u>script</u> argument is provided, <b>bind</b> returns an empty string.

       If <u>sequence</u> is specified without a <u>script</u>, then the script currently bound to <u>sequence</u> is returned, or an
       empty  string  is  returned  if  there  is  no  binding  for <u>sequence</u>.  If neither <u>sequence</u> nor <u>script</u> is
       specified, then the return value is a list whose elements are all the sequences  for  which  there  exist
       bindings for <u>tag</u>.

       The  <u>tag</u>  argument  determines  which  window(s) the binding applies to.  If <u>tag</u> begins with a dot, as in
       <b>.a.b.c</b>, then it must be the path name for a window; otherwise it may be an arbitrary string.  Each window
       has an associated list of tags, and a binding applies to a particular window if its tag  is  among  those
       specified  for  the  window.   Although  the  <b>bindtags</b>  command may be used to assign an arbitrary set of
       binding tags to a window, the default binding tags provide the following behavior:

       •  If a tag is the name of an internal window the binding applies to that window.

       •  If the tag is the name of a class of widgets, such as <b>Button</b>, the binding applies to  all  widgets  in
          that class.

       •  If  the  tag  is  the name of a toplevel window the binding applies to the toplevel window and all its
          internal windows.

       •  If <u>tag</u> has the value <b>all</b>, the binding applies to all windows in the application.

</pre><h4><b>EVENT</b> <b>PATTERNS</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>sequence</u> argument specifies a sequence of one or more  event  patterns,  with  optional  white  space
       between  the  patterns.   Each  event  pattern may take one of three forms.  In the simplest case it is a
       single printing ASCII character, such as <b>a</b> or <b>[</b>.  The character may not  be  a  space  character  or  the
       character  <b>&lt;</b>.  This form of pattern matches a <b>Key</b> event for the particular character.  The second form of
       pattern is longer but more general.  It has the following syntax:
              <b>&lt;</b><u>modifier-modifier-type-detail</u><b>&gt;</b>
       The entire event pattern is surrounded by angle brackets.  Inside the angle brackets  are  zero  or  more
       modifiers,  an  event type, and an extra piece of information (<u>detail</u>) identifying a particular button or
       keysym.  Any of the fields may be omitted, as long as at least one of <u>type</u> and <u>detail</u>  is  present.   The
       fields must be separated by white space or dashes.

       The  third  form of pattern is used to specify a user-defined, named virtual event.  It has the following
       syntax:
              <b>&lt;&lt;</b><u>name</u><b>&gt;&gt;</b>
       The entire virtual event pattern is surrounded by double angle brackets.  Inside the  angle  brackets  is
       the  user-defined  name  of  the virtual event.  Modifiers, such as <b>Shift</b> or <b>Control</b>, may not be combined
       with a virtual event to modify it.  Bindings on a virtual event may be created before the  virtual  event
       is  defined,  and  if  the  definition  of a virtual event changes dynamically, all windows bound to that
       virtual event will respond immediately to the new definition.

       Some widgets (e.g. <b>menu</b> and <b>text</b>) issue virtual events when their internal state is updated in some ways.
       Please see the manual page for each widget for details.

   <b>MODIFIERS</b>
       Modifiers consist of any of the following values:

              <b>Control</b>                 <b>Mod1</b>, <b>M1</b>, <b>Command</b>
              <b>Alt</b>                     <b>Mod2</b>, <b>M2</b>, <b>Option</b>
              <b>Shift</b>                   <b>Mod3</b>, <b>M3</b>, <b>Num</b>
              <b>Lock</b>                    <b>Mod4</b>, <b>M4</b>, <b>Fn</b>
              <b>Extended</b>                <b>Mod5</b>, <b>M5</b>
              <b>Button1</b>, <b>B1</b>             <b>Meta</b>, <b>M</b>
              <b>Button2</b>, <b>B2</b>             <b>Double</b>
              <b>Button3</b>, <b>B3</b>             <b>Triple</b>
              <b>Button4</b>, <b>B4</b>             <b>Quadruple</b>
              <b>Button5</b>, <b>B5</b>

       Where more than one value is listed, separated by  commas,  the  values  are  equivalent.   Most  of  the
       modifiers have the obvious X meanings.  For example, <b>Button1</b> requires that button 1 be depressed when the
       event occurs.  For a binding to match a given event, the modifiers in the event must include all of those
       specified  in  the  event  pattern.   An event may also contain additional modifiers not specified in the
       binding.  For example, if button 1 is pressed while the shift and control  keys  are  down,  the  pattern
       <b>&lt;Control-Button-1&gt;</b>  will  match  the event, but <b>&lt;Mod1-Button-1&gt;</b> will not.  If no modifiers are specified,
       then any combination of modifiers may be present in the event.

       <b>Meta</b> and <b>M</b> refer to whichever of the <b>M1</b> through <b>M5</b> modifiers is associated with the Meta  key(s)  on  the
       keyboard  (keysyms <b>Meta_R</b> and <b>Meta_L</b>).  If there are no Meta keys, or if they are not associated with any
       modifiers, then <b>Meta</b> and <b>M</b> will not match any events.  Similarly, the <b>Alt</b> modifier  refers  to  whichever
       modifier is associated with the alt key(s) on the keyboard (keysyms <b>Alt_L</b> and <b>Alt_R</b>).

       The <b>Double</b>, <b>Triple</b> and <b>Quadruple</b> modifiers are a convenience for specifying double mouse clicks and other
       repeated  events.  They cause a particular event pattern to be repeated 2, 3 or 4 times, and also place a
       time and space requirement on the sequence: for a sequence  of  events  to  match  a  <b>Double</b>,  <b>Triple</b>  or
       <b>Quadruple</b>  pattern,  all  of  the  events must occur close together in time and without substantial mouse
       motion in between.  For example, <b>&lt;Double-Button-1&gt;</b> is equivalent to <b>&lt;Button-1&gt;&lt;Button-1&gt;</b> with  the  extra
       time and space requirement.

       The  <b>Command</b>,  <b>Option</b>,  <b>Num</b>  and  <b>Fn</b>modifiers  are  equivalents  of  <b>Mod1</b>  up to <b>Mod4</b>; they correspond to
       Macintosh-specific modifier keys.

       The <b>Extended</b> modifier is, at present, specific to Windows.  It appears on events that are associated with
       the keys on the “extended keyboard”.  On a US keyboard, the extended keys include  the  <b>Alt</b>  and  <b>Control</b>
       keys  at  the  right  of the keyboard, the cursor keys in the cluster to the left of the numeric pad, the
       <b>NumLock</b> key, the <b>Break</b> key, the <b>PrintScreen</b> key, and the <b>/</b> and <b>Enter</b> keys in the numeric keypad.

   <b>EVENT</b> <b>TYPES</b>
       The <u>type</u> field may be any of the standard X event types, with a few extra abbreviations.  The <u>type</u>  field
       will  also accept a couple non-standard X event types that were added to better support the Macintosh and
       Windows platforms.  Below is a list of all the valid types; where two names  appear  together,  they  are
       synonyms.

              <b>Activate</b>              <b>Destroy</b>         <b>Map</b>
              <b>Button</b>, <b>ButtonPress</b>   <b>Enter</b>           <b>MapRequest</b>
              <b>ButtonRelease</b>         <b>Expose</b>          <b>Motion</b>
              <b>Circulate</b>             <b>FocusIn</b>         <b>MouseWheel</b>
              <b>TouchpadScroll</b>        <b>CirculateRequestFocusOut</b>
              <b>Property</b>              <b>Colormap</b>        <b>Gravity</b>
              <b>Reparent</b>              <b>Configure</b>       <b>Key</b>, <b>KeyPress</b>
              <b>ResizeRequest</b>         <b>ConfigureRequestKeyRelease</b>
              <b>Unmap</b>   <b>Create</b>        <b>Leave</b>           <b>Visibility</b>
              <b>Deactivate</b>

       Most of the above events have the same fields and behaviors as events in the X Windowing system.  You can
       find more detailed descriptions of these events in any X window programming book.  A couple of the events
       are  extensions  to the X event system to support features unique to the Macintosh and Windows platforms.
       We provide a little more detail on these events here.  These include:

       <b>Activate</b>, <b>Deactivate</b>
            These two events are sent to every sub-window of a toplevel when they change state.  In addition  to
            the  focus  Window,  the  Macintosh platform and Windows platforms have a notion of an active window
            (which often has but is not required to have the focus).  On the Macintosh, widgets  in  the  active
            window  have a different appearance than widgets in deactive windows.  The <b>Activate</b> event is sent to
            all the sub-windows in a toplevel when it changes from being  deactive  to  active.   Likewise,  the
            <b>Deactive</b> event is sent when the window's state changes from active to deactive.  There are no useful
            percent substitutions you would make when binding to these events.

       <b>MouseWheel</b>
            Many  contemporary  mice  include a mouse wheel, which is used for scrolling documents without using
            the scrollbars.  By rolling  the  wheel,  the  system  will  generate  <b>MouseWheel</b>  events  that  the
            application can use to scroll.  The event is routed to the window currently under the mouse pointer.
            When  the  event  is  received you can use the <b>%D</b> substitution to get the <u>delta</u> field for the event,
            which is an integer value describing how the mouse wheel has moved.  The smallest  value  for  which
            the  system will report is defined by the OS.  The sign of the value determines which direction your
            widget should scroll.  Positive values should scroll up and negative values should scroll down.

            Horizontal scrolling uses <b>Shift-MouseWheel</b> events, with positive <b>%D</b>  <u>delta</u>  substitution  indicating
            left  scrolling  and negative right scrolling. Horizontal scrolling events are generated tilt wheels
            on some mice.  Horizontal scrolling can also be emulated by holding Shift and scrolling vertically.

       <b>TouchpadScroll</b>
            On some platforms (currently Windows and macOS)  there  is  support  for  high-resolution  scrolling
            devices,  such as touchpads.  This is provided via <b>TouchpadScroll</b> events.  These events store two 16
            bit delta values in the integer provided by the <b>%D</b> substitution.  The <u>X</u> delta is in the  high  order
            16  bits  and  the  <u>Y</u>  delta is in the low order 16 bits.  These values can be unpacked by using the
            tk::PreciseScrollDeltas utility procedure.  For example:
            lassign [tk::PreciseScrollDeltas %D] deltaX deltaY
       The <b>$#</b> substitution is a counter for <b>TouchpadScroll</b> events which can be used by widgets that only support
       scrolling by units to ignore some portion of the events.

       <b>KeyPress</b>, <b>KeyRelease</b>
            The <b>KeyPress</b> and <b>KeyRelease</b> events are generated whenever a key is pressed  or  released.   <b>KeyPress</b>
            and <b>KeyRelease</b>

       <b>Key</b>, <b>KeyRelease</b>
            The  <b>Key</b>  and  <b>KeyRelease</b>  events  are  generated  whenever  a  key is pressed or released.  <b>Key</b> and
            <b>KeyRelease</b> events are sent to the window which currently has the keyboard focus.

       <b>Button</b>, <b>ButtonRelease</b>, <b>Motion</b>
            The <b>Button</b> and <b>ButtonRelease</b> events are generated when the user presses or releases a mouse  button.
            <b>Motion</b> events are generated whenever the pointer is moved.  <b>Button</b>, <b>ButtonRelease</b>, and <b>Motion</b> events
            are normally sent to the window containing the pointer.

            When  a mouse button is pressed, the window containing the pointer automatically obtains a temporary
            pointer grab.  Subsequent <b>Button</b>, <b>ButtonRelease</b>, and <b>Motion</b> events will  be  sent  to  that  window,
            regardless of which window contains the pointer, until all buttons have been released.

       <b>Configure</b>
            A  <b>Configure</b>  event  is  sent  to a window whenever its size, position, or border width changes, and
            sometimes when it has changed position in the stacking order.

       <b>Map</b>, <b>Unmap</b>
            The <b>Map</b> and <b>Unmap</b> events are generated whenever the mapping state of a window changes.

            Windows are created in the unmapped state.  Top-level windows become mapped when they transition  to
            the  <b>normal</b> state, and are unmapped in the <b>withdrawn</b> and <b>iconic</b> states.  Other windows become mapped
            when they are placed under control of a geometry manager (for example <b>pack</b> or <b>grid</b>).

            A window is <u>viewable</u> only if it and all of its ancestors are mapped.  Note  that  geometry  managers
            typically  do  not map their children until they have been mapped themselves, and unmap all children
            when they become unmapped; hence in Tk <b>Map</b> and <b>Unmap</b> events indicate whether  or  not  a  window  is
            viewable.

       <b>Visibility</b>
            A  window  is  said  to  be  <u>obscured</u>  when  another  window above it in the stacking order fully or
            partially overlaps it.  <b>Visibility</b> events are generated whenever a window's obscurity state changes;
            the <u>state</u> field (<b>%s</b>) specifies the new state.

       <b>Expose</b>
            An <b>Expose</b> event is generated whenever all or part of a window should be redrawn (for example, when a
            window is first mapped or if it becomes unobscured).   It  is  normally  not  necessary  for  client
            applications to handle <b>Expose</b> events, since Tk handles them internally.

       <b>Destroy</b>
            A <b>Destroy</b> event is delivered to a window when it is destroyed.

            When  the  <b>Destroy</b>  event  is  delivered to a widget, it is in a “half-dead” state: the widget still
            exists, but operations that involve it may return invalid results, or return an error.

       <b>FocusIn</b>, <b>FocusOut</b>
            The <b>FocusIn</b> and <b>FocusOut</b> events are generated whenever the keyboard focus changes.  A <b>FocusOut</b> event
            is sent to the old focus window, and a <b>FocusIn</b> event is sent to the new one.

            In addition, if the old and new focus windows do not share a common parent, “virtual crossing” focus
            events are sent to the intermediate windows in the hierarchy.  Thus a <b>FocusIn</b> event  indicates  that
            the  target  window or one of its descendants has acquired the focus, and a <b>FocusOut</b> event indicates
            that the focus has been changed to a window outside the target window's hierarchy.

            The keyboard focus may be changed explicitly by a  call  to  <b>focus</b>,  or  implicitly  by  the  window
            manager.

       <b>Enter</b>, <b>Leave</b>
            An  <b>Enter</b>  event  is sent to a window when the pointer enters that window, and a <b>Leave</b> event is sent
            when the pointer leaves it.

            If there is a pointer grab in effect, <b>Enter</b> and <b>Leave</b> events are only delivered to the window owning
            the grab.

            In addition, when the pointer moves between two windows, <b>Enter</b> and <b>Leave</b> “virtual  crossing”  events
            are  sent  to  intermediate  windows in the hierarchy in the same manner as for <b>FocusIn</b> and <b>FocusOut</b>
            events.

       <b>Property</b>
            A <b>Property</b> event is sent to a window whenever an X property belonging to that window is  changed  or
            deleted.   <b>Property</b>  events are not normally delivered to Tk applications as they are handled by the
            Tk core.

       <b>Colormap</b>
            A <b>Colormap</b> event is generated whenever the colormap associated  with  a  window  has  been  changed,
            installed, or uninstalled.

            Widgets  may  be assigned a private colormap by specifying a <b>-colormap</b> option; the window manager is
            responsible for installing and uninstalling colormaps as necessary.

            Note that Tk provides no useful details for this event type.

       <b>MapRequest</b>, <b>CirculateRequest</b>, <b>ResizeRequest</b>, <b>ConfigureRequest</b>, <b>Create</b>
            These events are not normally delivered to Tk applications.  They are included for completeness,  to
            make it possible to write X11 window managers in Tk.  (These events are only delivered when a client
            has selected <b>SubstructureRedirectMask</b> on a window; the Tk core does not use this mask.)

       <b>Gravity</b>, <b>Reparent</b>, <b>Circulate</b>
            The  events  <b>Gravity</b>  and <b>Reparent</b> are not normally delivered to Tk applications.  They are included
            for completeness.

            A <b>Circulate</b> event indicates that the window has moved to the top or to the bottom  of  the  stacking
            order  as a result of an <b>XCirculateSubwindows</b> protocol request.  Note that the stacking order may be
            changed for other reasons which do not generate  a  <b>Circulate</b>  event,  and  that  Tk  does  not  use
            <b>XCirculateSubwindows()</b>  internally.   This event type is included only for completeness; there is no
            reliable way to track changes to a window's position in the stacking order.

   <b>EVENT</b> <b>DETAILS</b>
       The last part of a long event specification is <u>detail</u>.  In the case of a <b>Button</b> or  <b>ButtonRelease</b>  event,
       it  is  the number of a button (1-9).  If a button number is given, then only an event on that particular
       button will match;  if no button number is given, then an event on any button will match.  Note:   giving
       a  specific button number is different than specifying a button modifier; in the first case, it refers to
       a button being pressed or released, while in the second it refers to some other button  that  is  already
       depressed when the matching event occurs.  If a button number is given then <u>type</u> may be omitted:  if will
       default to <b>Button</b>.  For example, the specifier <b>&lt;1&gt;</b> is equivalent to <b>&lt;Button-1&gt;</b>.

       If the event type is <b>Key</b> or <b>KeyRelease</b>, then <u>detail</u> may be specified in the form of an X keysym.  Keysyms
       are  textual  specifications for particular keys on the keyboard; they include all the alphanumeric ASCII
       characters (e.g.  “a” is the keysym for the ASCII character “a”), plus descriptions for  non-alphanumeric
       characters  (“comma”is  the keysym for the comma character), plus descriptions for all the non-ASCII keys
       on the keyboard (e.g.  “Shift_L” is the keysym for the left shift key, and “F1” is the keysym for the  F1
       function  key,  if  it  exists).  The complete list of keysyms is not presented here;  it is available in
       other X documentation and may vary from system to system.  If necessary, you  can  use  the  <b>%K</b>  notation
       described below to print out the keysym name for a particular key.  If a keysym <u>detail</u> is given, then the
       <u>type</u>  field  may  be  omitted;   it  will  default to <b>Key</b>.  For example, <b>&lt;Control-comma&gt;</b> is equivalent to
       <b>&lt;Control-Key-comma&gt;</b>.

</pre><h4><b>BINDING</b> <b>SCRIPTS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>SUBSTITUTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>script</u> argument to <b>bind</b> is a Tcl script, called the “binding script”, which will be executed whenever
       the given event sequence occurs.  <u>Command</u> will be executed in the same interpreter that the <b>bind</b>  command
       was  executed  in, and it will run at global level (only global variables will be accessible).  If <u>script</u>
       contains any <b>%</b> characters, then the script will not be executed directly.  Instead, a new script will  be
       generated  by  replacing each <b>%</b>, and the character following it, with information from the current event.
       The replacement depends on the character following the <b>%</b>, as defined in the list below.  Unless otherwise
       indicated, the replacement string is the decimal value of the given field from the current  event.   Some
       of  the  substitutions  are  only valid for certain types of events;  if they are used for other types of
       events the value substituted is undefined.

       <b>%%</b>   Replaced with a single percent.

       <b>%#</b>   The number of the last client request processed by the server (the <u>serial</u>  field  from  the  event).
            Valid for all event types.

       <b>%a</b>   The <u>above</u> field from the event, formatted as a hexadecimal number.  Valid only for <b>Configure</b> events.
            Indicates  the  sibling window immediately below the receiving window in the stacking order, or <b>0</b> if
            the receiving window is at the bottom.

       <b>%b</b>   The number of the button that was pressed or released.  Valid  only  for  <b>Button</b>  and  <b>ButtonRelease</b>
            events.

       <b>%c</b>   The  <u>count</u>  field  from  the  event.   Valid only for <b>Expose</b> events.  Indicates that there are <u>count</u>
            pending <b>Expose</b> events which have not yet been delivered to the window.

       <b>%d</b>   The <u>detail</u> or <u>user_data</u> field from the event.  The <b>%d</b>  is  replaced  by  a  string  identifying  the
            detail.  For <b>Enter</b>, <b>Leave</b>, <b>FocusIn</b>, and <b>FocusOut</b> events, the string will be one of the following:

                   <b>NotifyAncestor</b>          <b>NotifyNonlinearVirtual</b>
                   <b>NotifyDetailNone</b>        <b>NotifyPointer</b>
                   <b>NotifyInferior</b>          <b>NotifyPointerRoot</b>
                   <b>NotifyNonlinear</b>         <b>NotifyVirtual</b>

            For <b>ConfigureRequest</b> events, the string will be one of:

                   <b>Above</b>                   <b>Opposite</b>
                   <b>Below</b>                   <b>None</b>
                   <b>BottomIf</b>                <b>TopIf</b>

            For  virtual  events,  the  string  will be whatever value is stored in the <u>user_data</u> field when the
            event was created (typically with <b>event</b> <b>generate</b>), or  the  empty  string  if  the  field  is  NULL.
            Virtual  events  corresponding to key sequence presses (see <b>event</b> <b>add</b> for details) set the <u>user_data</u>
            to NULL.  For events other than these, the substituted string is undefined.

       <b>%f</b>   The <u>focus</u> field from the event (<b>0</b> or <b>1</b>).  Valid only for <b>Enter</b> and <b>Leave</b> events.  <b>1</b> if the receiving
            window is the focus window or a descendant of the focus window, <b>0</b> otherwise.

       <b>%h</b>   The <u>height</u> field from the event.  Valid for the <b>Configure</b>, <b>ConfigureRequest</b>, <b>Create</b>,  <b>ResizeRequest</b>,
            and <b>Expose</b> events.  Indicates the new or requested height of the window.

       <b>%i</b>   The <u>window</u> field from the event, represented as a hexadecimal integer.  Valid for all event types.

       <b>%k</b>   The <u>keycode</u> field from the event.  Valid only for <b>Key</b> and <b>KeyRelease</b> events.

       <b>%m</b>   The  <u>mode</u>  field  from  the  event.   The  substituted  string  is  one of <b>NotifyNormal</b>, <b>NotifyGrab</b>,
            <b>NotifyUngrab</b>, or <b>NotifyWhileGrabbed</b>.  Valid only for <b>Enter</b>, <b>FocusIn</b>, <b>FocusOut</b>, and <b>Leave</b> events.

       <b>%o</b>   The <u>override_redirect</u> field from the event.  Valid only for <b>Map</b>, <b>Reparent</b>, and <b>Configure</b> events.

       <b>%p</b>   The <u>place</u> field from the event, substituted as one  of  the  strings  <b>PlaceOnTop</b>  or  <b>PlaceOnBottom</b>.
            Valid only for <b>Circulate</b> and <b>CirculateRequest</b> events.

       <b>%s</b>   The  <u>state</u>  field  from  the  event.   For <b>Button</b>, <b>ButtonRelease</b>, <b>Enter</b>, <b>Key</b>, <b>KeyRelease</b>, <b>Leave</b>, and
            <b>Motion</b>  events,  a  decimal  string  is  substituted.   For   <b>Visibility</b>,   one   of   the   strings
            <b>VisibilityUnobscured</b>,  <b>VisibilityPartiallyObscured</b>, and <b>VisibilityFullyObscured</b> is substituted.  For
            <b>Property</b> events, substituted with either the string <b>NewValue</b> (indicating that the property has  been
            created or modified) or <b>Delete</b> (indicating that the property has been removed).

       <b>%t</b>   The  <u>time</u>  field  from the event.  This is the X server timestamp (typically the time since the last
            server reset) in milliseconds, when the event occurred.  Valid for most events.

       <b>%w</b>   The <u>width</u> field from the event.  Indicates the new or requested width of the window.  Valid only for
            <b>Configure</b>, <b>ConfigureRequest</b>, <b>Create</b>, <b>ResizeRequest</b>, and <b>Expose</b> events.

       <b>%x</b>, <b>%y</b>
            The <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> fields from  the  event.   For  <b>Button</b>,  <b>ButtonRelease</b>,  <b>Motion</b>,  <b>Key</b>,  <b>KeyRelease</b>,  and
            <b>MouseWheel</b>  events,  <b>%x</b>  and <b>%y</b> indicate the position of the mouse pointer relative to the receiving
            window.  For key events on the Macintosh these are the coordinates of the mouse at the  moment  when
            an  X11 KeyEvent is sent to Tk, which could be slightly later than the time of the physical press or
            release.  For <b>Enter</b> and <b>Leave</b> events, the position where  the  mouse  pointer  crossed  the  window,
            relative to the receiving window.  For <b>Configure</b> and <b>Create</b> requests, the <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> coordinates of the
            window relative to its parent window.

       <b>%A</b>   Substitutes  the UNICODE character corresponding to the event, or the empty string if the event does
            not correspond to a UNICODE character (e.g. the shift key was pressed). On X11, <b>XmbLookupString</b>  (or
            <b>XLookupString</b>  when  input  method  support is turned off) does all the work of translating from the
            event to a UNICODE character.  On X11, valid only for <b>Key</b> event. On Windows  and  macOS/aqua,  valid
            only for <b>Key</b> and <b>KeyRelease</b> events.

       <b>%B</b>   The  <u>border_width</u>  field  from  the  event.   Valid only for <b>Configure</b>, <b>ConfigureRequest</b>, and <b>Create</b>
            events.

       <b>%D</b>   This reports the <u>delta</u> value of a <b>MouseWheel</b> event.  The <u>delta</u> value represents the  rotation  units
            the  mouse  wheel has been moved. The sign of the value represents the direction the mouse wheel was
            scrolled.

       <b>%E</b>   The <u>send_event</u> field from the event.  Valid for all  event  types.   <b>0</b>  indicates  that  this  is  a
            “normal” event, <b>1</b> indicates that it is a “synthetic” event generated by <b>SendEvent</b>.

       <b>%K</b>   The  keysym  corresponding  to  the  event, substituted as a textual string.  Valid only for <b>Key</b> and
            <b>KeyRelease</b> events.

       <b>%M</b>   The number of script-based binding patterns matched so far for  the  event.   Valid  for  all  event
            types.

       <b>%N</b>   The  keysym  corresponding  to  the  event, substituted as a decimal number.  Valid only for <b>Key</b> and
            <b>KeyRelease</b> events.

       <b>%P</b>   The name of the property being updated or deleted (which may be converted to an  XAtom  using  <b>winfo</b>
            <b>atom</b>.) Valid only for <b>Property</b> events.

       <b>%R</b>   The <u>root</u> window identifier from the event.  Valid only for events containing a <u>root</u> field.

       <b>%S</b>   The  <u>subwindow</u>  window identifier from the event, formatted as a hexadecimal number.  Valid only for
            events containing a <u>subwindow</u> field.

       <b>%T</b>   The <u>type</u> field from the event.  Valid for all event types.

       <b>%W</b>   The path name of the window to which the event was reported  (the  <u>window</u>  field  from  the  event).
            Valid for all event types.

       <b>%X</b>, <b>%Y</b>
            The  <u>x_root</u>  and  <u>y_root</u> fields from the event.  If a virtual-root window manager is being used then
            the substituted values are the corresponding x-coordinate and  y-coordinate  in  the  virtual  root.
            Valid only for <b>Button</b>, <b>ButtonRelease</b>, <b>Enter</b>, <b>Key</b>, <b>KeyRelease</b>, <b>Leave</b> and <b>Motion</b> events.  Same meaning
            as <b>%x</b> and <b>%y</b>, except relative to the (virtual) root window.

       The  replacement  string  for a %-replacement is formatted as a proper Tcl list element.  This means that
       spaces or special characters such as <b>$</b> and <b>{</b> may be preceded by backslashes.  This  guarantees  that  the
       string will be passed through the Tcl parser when the binding script is evaluated.  Most replacements are
       numbers  or  well-defined  strings  such  as <b>Above</b>;  for these replacements no special formatting is ever
       necessary.  The most common case where reformatting occurs is for the <b>%A</b> substitution.  For  example,  if
       <u>script</u> is
              <b>insert</b> <b>%A</b>
       and the character typed is an open square bracket, then the script actually executed will be
              <b>insert</b> <b>\[</b>
       This  will cause the <b>insert</b> to receive the original replacement string (open square bracket) as its first
       argument.  If the extra backslash had not been added, Tcl would not have been able to  parse  the  script
       correctly.

</pre><h4><b>MULTIPLE</b> <b>MATCHES</b></h4><pre>
       It  is  possible  for  several  bindings  to  match a given X event.  If the bindings are associated with
       different <u>tag</u>'s, then each of the bindings will be executed, in order.  By default,  a  binding  for  the
       widget  will  be  executed  first,  followed  by  a class binding, a binding for its toplevel, and an <b>all</b>
       binding.  The <b>bindtags</b> command may be used to change this order for a particular window or  to  associate
       additional binding tags with the window.

       The <b>continue</b> and <b>break</b> commands may be used inside a binding script to control the processing of matching
       scripts.   If  <b>continue</b> is invoked within a binding script, then this binding script, including all other
       “+” appended scripts, is terminated but Tk will continue processing binding scripts associated with other
       <u>tag</u>'s.  If the <b>break</b> command is invoked within a binding script, then that script terminates and no other
       scripts will be invoked for the event.

       Within a script called from the binding script, <b>return</b> <b>-code</b>  <b>ok</b>  may  be  used  to  continue  processing
       (including  “+” appended scripts), or <b>return</b> <b>-code</b> <b>break</b> may be used to stop processing all other binding
       scripts.

       If more than one binding matches a particular event and they have the same <u>tag</u>, then  the  most  specific
       binding  is  chosen and its script is evaluated.  The following tests are applied, in order, to determine
       which of several matching sequences is more specific:

              (a)    an event pattern that specifies a specific button or key is more  specific  than  one  that
                     does not;

              (b)    a  sequence with the most highest-ordered patterns (in term of highest repetition count) is
                     more specific than a sequence with less highest-ordered patterns;

              (c)    if the modifiers specified in one pattern are a subset of the modifiers in another pattern,
                     then the pattern with more modifiers is more specific;

              (d)    a virtual event whose physical pattern matches the sequence is less specific than the  same
                     physical pattern that is not associated with a virtual event;

              (e)    given a sequence that matches two or more virtual events, one of the virtual events will be
                     chosen, but the order is undefined.

       If  the  matching sequences contain more than one event, then tests (c)-(e) are applied in order from the
       most recent event to the least recent event in the sequences.  If these tests fail to determine a winner,
       then the most recently registered sequence is the winner.

       If there are two (or more) virtual events that are both triggered by the same sequence, and both of those
       virtual events are bound to the same window tag, then only one of the virtual events will  be  triggered,
       and it will be picked at random:
              event add &lt;&lt;Paste&gt;&gt; &lt;Control-y&gt;
              event add &lt;&lt;Paste&gt;&gt; &lt;Button-2&gt;
              event add &lt;&lt;Scroll&gt;&gt; &lt;Button-2&gt;
              <b>bind</b> Entry &lt;&lt;Paste&gt;&gt; {puts Paste}
              <b>bind</b> Entry &lt;&lt;Scroll&gt;&gt; {puts Scroll}
       If the user types Control-y, the <b>&lt;&lt;Paste&gt;&gt;</b> binding will be invoked, but if the user presses button 2 then
       one  of  either  the  <b>&lt;&lt;Paste&gt;&gt;</b>  or  the  <b>&lt;&lt;Scroll&gt;&gt;</b> bindings will be invoked, but exactly which one gets
       invoked is undefined.

       If an X event does not match any of the existing bindings, then the event is ignored.  An  unbound  event
       is not considered to be an error.

</pre><h4><b>MULTI-EVENT</b> <b>SEQUENCES</b> <b>AND</b> <b>IGNORED</b> <b>EVENTS</b></h4><pre>
       When  a  <u>sequence</u>  specified  in  a <b>bind</b> command contains more than one event pattern, then its script is
       executed whenever the recent events (leading up to and including  the  current  event)  match  the  given
       sequence.  This means, for example, that if button 1 is clicked repeatedly the sequence <b>&lt;Double-Button-1&gt;</b>
       will match each button press but the first.  If extraneous events that would prevent a match occur in the
       middle  of an event sequence then the extraneous events are ignored unless they are <b>Key</b> or <b>Button</b> events.
       For example, <b>&lt;Double-Button-1&gt;</b> will match a sequence of presses of button 1, even though  there  will  be
       <b>ButtonRelease</b>  events  (and  possibly <b>Motion</b> events) between the <b>Button</b> events.  Furthermore, a <b>Key</b> event
       may be preceded by any number of other <b>Key</b> events for modifier keys without the modifier keys  preventing
       a  match.   For example, the event sequence <b>aB</b> will match a press of the <b>a</b> key, a release of the <b>a</b> key, a
       press of the <b>Shift</b> key, and a press of the <b>b</b> key:  the press of <b>Shift</b> is ignored because it is a modifier
       key.  Finally, if several <b>Motion</b> events occur in a row, only  the  last  one  is  used  for  purposes  of
       matching binding sequences.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       If an error occurs in executing the script for a binding then the <b>bgerror</b> mechanism is used to report the
       error.  The <b>bgerror</b> command will be executed at global level (outside the context of any Tcl procedure).

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Arrange  for  a  string  describing  the  motion of the mouse to be printed out when the mouse is double-
       clicked:
              <b>bind</b> . &lt;Double-1&gt; {
                  puts "hi from (%x,%y)"
              }

       A little GUI that displays what the keysym name of the last key pressed is:
              set keysym "Press any key"
              pack [label .l -textvariable keysym -padx 2m -pady 1m]
              <b>bind</b> . &lt;Key&gt; {
                  set keysym "You pressed %K"
              }
