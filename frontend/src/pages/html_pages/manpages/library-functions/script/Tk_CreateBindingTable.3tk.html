</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       These procedures provide a general-purpose mechanism for creating and invoking  bindings.   Bindings  are
       organized  in  terms  of  <u>binding</u>  <u>tables</u>.   A  binding table consists of a collection of bindings plus a
       history of recent events.  Within a binding table, bindings are associated with <u>objects</u>.  The meaning  of
       an  object is defined by clients of the binding package.  For example, Tk keeps uses one binding table to
       hold all of the bindings created by the <b>bind</b> command.  For this table, objects are  pointers  to  strings
       such  as  window names, class names, or other binding tags such as <b>all</b>.  Tk also keeps a separate binding
       table for each canvas widget, which manages bindings created by the canvas's <b>bind</b> widget command;  within
       this table, an object is either a pointer to the internal  structure  for  a  canvas  item  or  a  Tk_Uid
       identifying a tag.

       The  procedure  <b>Tk_CreateBindingTable</b>  creates  a  new  binding table and associates <u>interp</u> with it (when
       bindings in the table are invoked, the scripts  will  be  evaluated  in  <u>interp</u>).   <b>Tk_CreateBindingTable</b>
       returns  a  token for the table, which must be used in calls to other procedures such as <b>Tk_CreateBinding</b>
       or <b>Tk_BindEvent</b>.

       <b>Tk_DeleteBindingTable</b> frees all of the state associated with a binding table.  Once it returns the caller
       should not use the <u>bindingTable</u> token again.

       <b>Tk_CreateBinding</b> adds a new binding to an existing table.  The <u>object</u> argument identifies the object with
       which the binding is to be associated, and it may be any one-word value.  Typically it is a pointer to  a
       string  or  data  structure.  The <u>eventString</u> argument identifies the event or sequence of events for the
       binding;  see the documentation for the <b>bind</b> command for a description of its format.  <u>script</u> is the  Tcl
       script  to be evaluated when the binding triggers.  <u>append</u> indicates what to do if there already exists a
       binding for <u>object</u> and <u>eventString</u>:  if <u>append</u> is zero then <u>script</u> replaces the old script;  if <u>append</u> is
       non-zero then the new script is appended to the old one.  <b>Tk_CreateBinding</b> returns an X  event  mask  for
       all  the  events  associated with the bindings.  This information may be useful to invoke <b>XSelectInput</b> to
       select relevant events, or to disallow the use of certain events in bindings.  If an error occurred while
       creating the binding (e.g., <u>eventString</u> refers to a non-existent event), then 0 is returned and an  error
       message is left as the result of interpreter <u>interp</u>.

       <b>Tk_DeleteBinding</b> removes from <u>bindingTable</u> the binding given by <u>object</u> and <u>eventString</u>, if such a binding
       exists.   <b>Tk_DeleteBinding</b>  always  returns <b>TCL_OK</b>.  In some cases it may reset the interpreter result to
       the default empty value.

       <b>Tk_GetBinding</b> returns a pointer to the script associated with <u>eventString</u> and <u>object</u> in <u>bindingTable</u>.  If
       no such binding exists then NULL is returned and an error message is left as the  result  of  interpreter
       <u>interp</u>.

       <b>Tk_GetAllBindings</b> returns in <u>interp</u>'s result a list of all the event strings for which there are bindings
       in <u>bindingTable</u> associated with <u>object</u>.  If there are no bindings for <u>object</u>, the result will be an empty
       string.

       <b>Tk_DeleteAllBindings</b> deletes all of the bindings in <u>bindingTable</u> that are associated with <u>object</u>.

       <b>Tk_BindEvent</b>  is  called  to  process an event.  It makes a copy of the event in an internal history list
       associated with the binding table, then it checks  for  bindings  that  match  the  event.   <b>Tk_BindEvent</b>
       processes  each  of  the  objects  pointed  to  by  <u>objectPtr</u> in turn.  For each object, it finds all the
       bindings that match the current event history, selects the  most  specific  binding  using  the  priority
       mechanism described in the documentation for <b>bind</b>, and invokes the script for that binding.  If there are
       no matching bindings for a particular object, then the object is skipped.  <b>Tk_BindEvent</b> continues through
       all  of  the  objects,  handling  exceptions  such  as  errors,  <b>break</b>,  and <b>continue</b> as described in the
       documentation for <b>bind</b>.
