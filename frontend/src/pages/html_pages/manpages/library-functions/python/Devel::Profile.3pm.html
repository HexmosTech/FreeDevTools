</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Devel::Profile - tell me why my perl program runs so slowly

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           perl -d:Profile program.pl
           less prof.out

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The Devel::Profile package is a Perl code profiler.  This will collect information on the execution time
       of a Perl script and of the subs in that script.  This information can be used to determine which
       subroutines are using the most time and which subroutines are being called most often.

       To profile a Perl script, run the perl interpreter with the -d debugging switch.  The profiler uses the
       debugging hooks.  So to profile script test.pl the following command should be used:

               perl -d:Profile test.pl

       When the script terminates (or periodicly while running, see ENVIRONMENT) the profiler will dump the
       profile information to a file called <u>prof.out</u>. This file is human-readable, no additional tool is
       required to read it.

       Note: Statistics are kept per sub, not per line.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       "PERL_PROFILE_SAVETIME"
           How  often  to  save  profile data while running, in seconds, 0 to save only at exit.  The default is
           every 2 minutes.

       "PERL_PROFILE_FILENAME"
           Filename to save profile data to, default is <u>prof.out</u>

       "PERL_PROFILE_DONT_OTHER"
           Time spent running code not in 'subs' (such as naked code in main) won\'t get accounted  for  in  the
           normal  manner. By default, we account for this time in the sub '&lt;other&gt;'. With this variable set, we
           leave it as 'missing' time.  This reduces the effective runtime of the program,  and  the  calculated
           percentages.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b> <b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
       example output:

           time elapsed (wall):   86.8212
           time running program:  65.7657  (75.75%)
           time profiling (est.): 21.0556  (24.25%)
           number of calls:       647248

           %Time    Sec.     #calls   sec/call  F  name
           31.74   20.8770     2306   0.009053     Configable::init_from_config

           17.49   11.5043   297997   0.000039     Configable::has_attr

           [...]

       This is a small summary, followed by one line per sub.

       time elapsed (wall)
           This is the total time elapsed.

       time running program
           This is the amount of time spent running your program.

       time profiling
           This is the amount of time wasted due to profiler overhead.

       number of calls
           This is the total number of subroutine calls your program made.

       Followed by one line per subroutine.

       name
           The name of the subroutine.

       %Time
           The percentage of the total program runtime used by this subroutine.

       Sec.
           The total number of seconds used by this subroutine.

       #calls
           The number of times this subroutine was called.

       sec/call
           The average number of seconds this subroutines takes each time it is called.

       F   Flags.

           "*" pseudo-function to account for otherwise unacounted for time.

           "?" At  least  one call of this subroutine did not return (typically because of an "exit", or "die").
               The statistics for it may be slightly off.

           "x" At least one call of this subroutine trapped an exception.  The statistics for it may be slightly
               off.

</pre><h4><b>LONG</b> <b>RUNNING</b> <b>PROGRAMS</b></h4><pre>
       This module was written so that the author could profile a large  long-running  (daemon)  program.  Since
       normally,  this  program  never exited, saving profiling data only at program exit was not an interesting
       option. This module will save profiling data periodically based on $PERL_PROFILE_SAVETIME, or the program
       being profiled can call "DB::save()" at any time. This allows you to watch your profiling data while  the
       program is running.

       The  above  program  also had a very large startup phase (reading config files, building data structures,
       etc), the author wanted to see  profiling  data  for  the  startup  phase,  and  for  the  running  phase
       separately.  The  running  program  can  call  "DB::reset()"  to  save  the  profiling data and reset the
       statistics. Once reset, only "stuff" that happens from that point on will be  reflected  in  the  profile
       data file.

       By  default, reset is attached to the signal handler for "SIGUSR2".  Using a perl built with "safe signal
       handling" (5.8.0 and higher), you may safely send this signal to control profiling.

</pre><h4><b>BUT</b> <b>I</b> <b>WANT</b> <b>INCLUSIVE</b> <b>TIMES</b> <b>NOT</b> <b>EXCLUSIVE</b> <b>TIMES</b></h4><pre>
       Please see the spin-off module Devel::DProfLB.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Some buggy XS based perl modules  can  behave  erroneously  when  run  under  the  perl  debugger.  Since
       Devel::Profile  uses  the perl debugger interfaces, these modules will also behave erroneously when being
       profiled.

       There are no known bugs in this module.
