</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       nbdkit-perl-plugin - nbdkit perl plugin

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        nbdkit perl /path/to/plugin.pl [arguments...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       "nbdkit-perl-plugin" is an embedded Perl interpreter for <b><a href="../man1/nbdkit.1.html">nbdkit</a></b>(1), allowing you to write nbdkit plugins
       in Perl.

   <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>given</b> <b>an</b> <b>nbdkit</b> <b>Perl</b> <b>plugin</b>
       Assuming you have a Perl script which is an nbdkit plugin, you run it like this:

        nbdkit perl /path/to/plugin.pl

       You may have to add further "key=value" arguments to the command line.  Read the Perl script to see if it
       requires any.

</pre><h4><b>WRITING</b> <b>A</b> <b>PERL</b> <b>NBDKIT</b> <b>PLUGIN</b></h4><pre>
       For an example plugin written in Perl, see:
       https://gitlab.com/nbdkit/nbdkit/blob/master/plugins/perl/example.pl

       Broadly speaking, Perl nbdkit plugins work like C ones, so you should read <b><a href="../man3/nbdkit-plugin.3.html">nbdkit-plugin</a></b>(3) first.

       To write a Perl nbdkit plugin, you create a Perl file which contains at least the following required
       subroutines:

        sub open
        {
          # see below
        }
        sub get_size
        {
          # see below
        }
        sub pread
        {
          # see below
        }

       Note that the subroutines must have those literal names (like "open"), because the C part looks up and
       calls those functions directly.  You may want to include documentation and globals (eg. for storing
       global state).  Also any top-level statements, "BEGIN" statements, "END" statements and so on are run
       when nbdkit starts up and shuts down, just like ordinary Perl.

   <b>Executable</b> <b>script</b>
       If you want you can make the script executable and include a "shebang" at the top:

        #!/usr/sbin/nbdkit perl

       See also "Shebang scripts" in <b><a href="../man1/nbdkit.1.html">nbdkit</a></b>(1).

       These scripts can also be installed in the $plugindir.  See "WRITING PLUGINS IN OTHER PROGRAMMING
       LANGUAGES" in <b><a href="../man3/nbdkit-plugin.3.html">nbdkit-plugin</a></b>(3).

   <b>"Nbdkit::"</b> <b>functions</b>
       The following functions can be called in a virtual Perl package called "Nbdkit".  Your script does not
       need to "use" this package, it is already available in all scripts.

       <u>"Nbdkit::debug</u> <u>($msg)"</u>

       In debugging mode, print $msg.  This is a wrapper around the C function <b><a href="../man3/nbdkit_debug.3.html">nbdkit_debug</a></b>(3) (see
       <b><a href="../man3/nbdkit-plugin.3.html">nbdkit-plugin</a></b>(3)).

       <u>"Nbdkit::set_error</u> <u>($err)"</u>

        Nbdkit::set_error($err);

       Record $err as the reason you are about to throw an exception.  $err should correspond to usual errno
       values, where it may help to "use POSIX()".

   <b>Exceptions</b>
       Instead of returning error codes as in C, Perl callbacks should indicate problems by throwing Perl
       exceptions (ie. "die", "croak" etc).  The Perl error message is captured and printed by nbdkit.  Remember
       to use "Nbdkit::set_error" if you need to control which error is sent back to the client; if omitted, the
       client will see an error of "EIO".

   <b>32</b> <b>vs</b> <b>64</b> <b>bit</b>
       It is likely that Perl plugins won't work well, or maybe won't work at all, on 32 bit platforms.  This is
       simply because Perl doesn't have an easy way to use 64 bit integers on 32 bit platforms, and 64 bit
       integers (eg. file offsets, disk sizes) are required for many nbdkit operations.

   <b>Perl</b> <b>callbacks</b>
       This just documents the arguments to the callbacks in Perl, and any way that they differ from the C
       callbacks.  In all other respects they work the same way as the C callbacks, so you should go and read
       <b><a href="../man3/nbdkit-plugin.3.html">nbdkit-plugin</a></b>(3).

       "dump_plugin"
           (Optional)

           There are no arguments or return value.

       "config"
           (Optional)

            sub config
            {
                my $key = shift;
                my $value = shift;
                # No return value.
            }

       "config_complete"
           (Optional)

           There are no arguments or return value.

       "open"
           (Required)

            sub open
            {
                my $readonly = shift;
                my $handle = {};
                return $handle;
            }

           The "readonly" flag is a boolean.

           You  can  return  any Perl value as the handle.  It is passed back to subsequent calls.  It's usually
           convenient to use a hashref, since that lets you store arbitrary fields.

       "close"
           (Optional)

            sub close
            {
                my $handle = shift;
                # No return value
            }

           After "close" returns, the reference count of the handle is decremented in the C part, which  usually
           means that the handle and its contents will be garbage collected.

       "get_size"
           (Required)

            sub get_size
            {
                my $handle = shift;
                my $i64 = .. the size of the disk ..;
                return $i64;
            }

           This returns the size of the disk.  You can return any Perl object that evaluates to an integer.

       "can_write"
           (Optional)

            sub can_write
            {
                my $handle = shift;
                my $bool = ...;
                return $bool;
            }

           Return a boolean indicating whether the disk is writable.

       "can_flush"
           (Optional)

            sub can_flush
            {
                my $handle = shift;
                my $bool = ...;
                return $bool;
            }

           Return a boolean indicating whether flush can be performed.

       "is_rotational"
           (Optional)

            sub is_rotational
            {
                my $handle = shift;
                my $bool = ...;
                return $bool;
            }

           Return a boolean indicating whether the disk is rotational.

       "can_trim"
           (Optional)

            sub can_trim
            {
                my $handle = shift;
                my $bool = ...;
                return $bool;
            }

           Return a boolean indicating whether trim/discard can be performed.

       "pread"
           (Required)

            sub pread
            {
               my $handle = shift;
               my $count = shift;
               my $offset = shift;
               my $flags = shift;
               # Construct a buffer of length $count bytes and return it.
               return $buf;
            }

           The  body  of your "pread" function should construct a buffer of length (at least) $count bytes.  You
           should read $count bytes from the disk starting at $offset.

           NBD only supports whole reads, so your  function  should  try  to  read  the  whole  region  (perhaps
           requiring  a  loop).   If  the read fails or is partial, your function should "die", optionally using
           "Nbdkit::set_error" first.

       "pwrite"
           (Optional)

            sub pwrite
            {
               my $handle = shift;
               my $buf = shift;
               my $count = length ($buf);
               my $offset = shift;
               my $flags = shift;
               # No return value
            }

           The body of your "pwrite" function should write the $buf string to the disk.  You should write $count
           bytes to the disk starting at $offset.

           NBD only supports whole writes, so your function should  try  to  write  the  whole  region  (perhaps
           requiring  a  loop).   If the write fails or is partial, your function should "die", optionally using
           "Nbdkit::set_error" first.

       "flush"
           (Optional)

            sub flush
            {
               my $handle = shift;
               my $flags = shift;
               # No return value
            }

           The body of your "flush" function should do a <b><a href="../man2/sync.2.html">sync</a></b>(2) or <b><a href="../man2/fdatasync.2.html">fdatasync</a></b>(2) or equivalent  on  the  backing
           store.

           If there is an error, the function should call "die", optionally using "Nbdkit::set_error" first.

       "trim"
           (Optional)

            sub trim
            {
               my $handle = shift;
               my $count = shift;
               my $offset = shift;
               my $flags = shift;
               # No return value
            }

           The body of your "trim" function should "punch a hole" in the backing store.

           If there is an error, the function should call "die", optionally using "Nbdkit::set_error" first.

       "zero"
           (Optional)

            sub zero
            {
               my $handle = shift;
               my $count = shift;
               my $offset = shift;
               my $flags = shift;
               # No return value
            }

           The  body  of  your "zero" function should ensure that $count bytes of the disk, starting at $offset,
           will read back as zero.

           NBD only supports whole writes, so your function should  try  to  write  the  whole  region  (perhaps
           requiring  a  loop).   If the write fails or is partial, your function should "die", optionally using
           "Nbdkit::set_error" first.  In particular, if you would like to automatically fall back  to  "pwrite"
           (perhaps because there is nothing to optimize if $flags does not contain $Nbdkit::FLAG_MAY_TRIM), use
           Nbdkit::set_error(POSIX::EOPNOTSUPP).

   <b>Missing</b> <b>callbacks</b>
       Missing: "load" and "unload"
           These are not needed because you can just use regular Perl "BEGIN" and "END" constructs.

       Missing: "name", "version", "longname", "description", "config_help", "can_fua", "can_cache", "cache"
           These are not yet supported.

   <b>Threads</b>
       The thread model for Perl callbacks currently cannot be set from Perl.  It is hard-coded in the C part to
       "NBDKIT_THREAD_MODEL_SERIALIZE_ALL_REQUESTS".  This may change or be settable in future.
