</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       B::Xref - Generates cross reference reports for Perl programs

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       perl -MO=Xref[,OPTIONS] foo.pl

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The B::Xref module is used to generate a cross reference listing of all definitions and uses of
       variables, subroutines and formats in a Perl program.  It is implemented as a backend for the Perl
       compiler.

       The report generated is in the following format:

           File filename1
             Subroutine subname1
               Package package1
                 object1        line numbers
                 object2        line numbers
                 ...
               Package package2
               ...

       Each <b>File</b> section reports on a single file. Each <b>Subroutine</b> section reports on a single subroutine apart
       from the special cases "(definitions)" and "(main)". These report, respectively, on subroutine
       definitions found by the initial symbol table walk and on the main part of the program or module external
       to all subroutines.

       The report is then grouped by the <b>Package</b> of each variable, subroutine or format with the special case
       "(lexicals)" meaning lexical variables. Each <b>object</b> name (implicitly qualified by its containing <b>Package</b>)
       includes its type character(s) at the beginning where possible. Lexical variables are easier to track and
       even included dereferencing information where possible.

       The "line numbers" are a comma separated list of line numbers (some preceded by code letters) where that
       object is used in some way.  Simple uses aren't preceded by a code letter. Introductions (such as where a
       lexical is first defined with "my") are indicated with the letter "i". Subroutine and method calls are
       indicated by the character "&amp;".  Subroutine definitions are indicated by "s" and format definitions by
       "f".

       For instance, here's part of the report from the <u>pod2man</u> program that comes with Perl:

         Subroutine clear_noremap
           Package (lexical)
             $ready_to_print   i1069, 1079
           Package main
             $&amp;                1086
             $.                1086
             $0                1086
             $1                1087
             $2                1085, 1085
             $3                1085, 1085
             $ARGV             1086
             %HTML_Escapes     1085, 1085

       This shows the variables used in the subroutine "clear_noremap".  The variable $ready_to_print is a <b>my()</b>
       (lexical) variable, <b>i</b>ntroduced (first declared with <b>my()</b>) on line 1069, and used on line 1079.  The
       variable $&amp; from the main package is used on 1086, and so on.

       A line number may be prefixed by a single letter:

       i   Lexical variable introduced (declared with <b>my()</b>) for the first time.

       &amp;   Subroutine or method call.

       s   Subroutine defined.

       r   Format defined.

       The  most useful option the cross referencer has is to save the report to a separate file.  For instance,
       to save the report on <u>myperlprogram</u> to the file <u>report</u>:

         $ perl -MO=Xref,-oreport myperlprogram

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Option words are separated by commas (not whitespace)  and  follow  the  usual  conventions  of  compiler
       backend options.

       "-oFILENAME"
               Directs output to "FILENAME" instead of standard output.

       "-r"    Raw output. Instead of producing a human-readable report, outputs a line in machine-readable form
               for each definition/use of a variable/sub/format.

       "-d"    Don't output the "(definitions)" sections.

       "-D[tO]"
               (Internal)  debug  options,  probably  only  useful  if "-r" included.  The "t" option prints the
               object on the top of the stack as it's being tracked. The "O" option prints each operator as it's
               being processed in the execution order of the program.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Non-lexical variables are quite difficult to track through a program.   Sometimes  the  type  of  a  non-
       lexical variable's use is impossible to determine. Introductions of non-lexical non-scalars don't seem to
       be reported properly.
