</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       MooseX::Types::Perl - Moose types that check against Perl syntax

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 0.101344

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use MooseX::Types::Perl qw(
           DistName

           ModuleName
           PackageName

           Identifier
           SafeIdentifier

           LaxVersionStr
           StrictVersionStr
           VersionObject
         );

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This library provides Moose types for checking things (mostly strings) against syntax that is, or is a
       reasonable subset of, Perl syntax.

</pre><h4><b>PERL</b> <b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This library should run on perls released even a long time ago.  It should work on any version of perl
       released in the last five years.

       Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made that the minimum required version
       will not be increased.  The version may be increased for any reason, and there is no promise that patches
       will be accepted to lower the minimum required perl.

</pre><h4><b>TYPES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>ModuleName</b>
   <b>PackageName</b>
       These types are identical, and expect a string that could be a package or module name.  That's basically
       a bunch of identifiers stuck together with double-colons.  One key quirk is that parts of the package
       name after the first may begin with digits.

       The use of an apostrophe as a package separator is not permitted.

   <b>DistName</b>
       The DistName type checks for a string like "MooseX-Types-Perl", the sort of thing used to name CPAN
       distributions.  In general, it's like the more familiar ModuleName, but with hyphens instead of double-
       colons.

       In reality, a few distribution names may not match this pattern -- most famously, "CGI.pm" is the name of
       the distribution that contains CGI.  These exceptions are few and far between, and deciding what a
       "LaxDistName" type would look like has not seemed worth it, yet.

   <b>Identifier</b>
       An Identifier is something that could be used as a symbol name or other identifier (filehandle, directory
       handle, subroutine name, format name, or label).  It's what you put after the sigil (dollar sign, at
       sign, percent sign) in a variable name.  Generally, it's a bunch of alphanumeric characters not starting
       with a digit.

       Although Perl identifiers may contain non-ASCII characters in some circumstances, this type does not
       allow it.  A "UnicodeIdentifier" type may be added in the future.

   <b>SafeIdentifier</b>
       SafeIdentifiers are just like Identifiers, but omit the single-letter variables underscore, a, and b, as
       these have special significance.

   <b>LaxVersionStr</b>
   <b>StrictVersionStr</b>
       Lax and strict version strings use the is_lax and is_strict methods from "version" to check if the given
       string would be a valid lax or strict version.  version::Internals covers the details but basically:  lax
       versions are everything you may do, and strict omit many of the usages best avoided.

   <b>VersionObject</b>
       Just for good measure, this type is included to check if a value is a version object.  Coercions from
       LaxVersionStr (and thus StrictVersionStr) are provided.
