</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Perl::PrereqScanner::Scanner::Perl5 - scan for core Perl 5 language indicators of required modules

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 1.100

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This scanner will look for the following indicators:

       •   plain  lines  beginning  with  "use",  "require", or "no" in your perl modules and scripts, including
           minimum perl version

       •   regular inheritance declared with the "base" and "parent" pragmata

       Since Perl does not allow you to supply a version requirement with a  "require"  statement,  the  scanner
       will  check  the  statement  after the "require Module" to see if it is "Module-&gt;VERSION( minimum_version
       );".

       In order to provide a minimum version, that method call must meet the following requirements:

       •   it must be the very next statement after "require Module".  Nothing can separate them but  whitespace
           and comments (and one semicolon).

       •   "Module" must be a bareword, and match the "require" exactly.

       •   "minimum_version" must be a literal number, v-string, or single-quoted string.  Double quotes are not
           allowed.

</pre><h4><b>PERL</b> <b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This  library  should  run on perls released even a long time ago.  It should work on any version of perl
       released in the last five years.

       Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made that the  minimum  required  version
       will not be increased.  The version may be increased for any reason, and there is no promise that patches
       will be accepted to lower the minimum required perl.
