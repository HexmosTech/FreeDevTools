       Perl::PrereqScanner::NotQuiteLite::App

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         scan-perl-prereqs-nqlite [options] [DIRS|FILES]


         -or-
         use Perl::PrereqScanner::NotQuiteLite::App;

         my $app = Perl::PrereqScanner::NotQuiteLite::App-&gt;new(
           parsers =&gt; [qw/:bundled/],
           suggests =&gt; 1,
           perl_minimum_version =&gt; 1,
         );
         my $prereqs = $app-&gt;run;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Perl::PrereqScanner::NotQuiteLite::App walks down a directory and scans appropriate files to find
       prerequisites.  You usually don't need to touch this module directly, but you might want to if you need
       finer control (to use a custom CPAN index etc).

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>new</b>
       creates an object. Notable options are:

       parsers
           Perl::PrereqScanner::NotQuiteLite::App uses all the bundled parsers by default, but you can change if
           you need your own parsers.  See Perl::PrereqScanner::NotQuiteLite for details.

       recommends, suggests, perl_minimum_version
           Perl::PrereqScanner::NotQuiteLite::App  usually  returns "use"d modules only, but you can change this
           behavior by setting these options. See Perl::PrereqScanner::NotQuiteLite for details.

       develop
           If set, Perl::PrereqScanner::NotQuiteLite::App also scans files under "xt" and  "author"  directories
           to find requirements for development.

       exclude_core
           If  set,  Perl::PrereqScanner::NotQuiteLite::App ignores prerequisites that are bundled with Perl (of
           5.008001 by default, or of a "use"d perl version if any). This requires Module::CoreList version 2.99
           or above.

       perl_version
           You can explicitly use this option to exclude core modules of a specific perl version.

       allow_test_pms
           Perl::PrereqScanner::NotQuiteLite::App usually ignores ".pm" files under "t/" directory if  they  are
           not  used in ".t" files, considering they are some kind of sample files. However, this assumption may
           be wrong sometimes. If this option is set, it  scans  all  the  ".pm"  files  under  "t/"  directory,
           considering  some  of the test modules will use them. If Test::Class (or its equivalent) is used in a
           test file, this option is implicitly set.

       base_dir
           Perl::PrereqScanner::NotQuiteLite::App usually starts traversing from the current directory. If  this
           option is set, it starts from there.

       scan_also
           Perl::PrereqScanner::NotQuiteLite::App    usually    scans    ".pm"    files   in   the   base   dir,
           "Makefile.PL"/"Build.PL", files under "lib", "t", "bin", script(s) directories (and "xt", "author" if
           asked).  If your distribution uses a different  file  layout,  or  uses  extra  directories  to  keep
           submodules, you can add (a reference to) a list of paths to scan.

       ignore, ignore_re
           Your  distribution  may  have  OS-specific  modules whose prerequisites can not be installed in other
           platforms. You can specify (a reference to) a list of files that should not be scanned (with "ignore"
           option), or a regular expression that matches the files (with "ignore_re" option).

       features
             my $app = Perl::PrereqScanner::NotQuiteLite::App-&gt;new(
               features =&gt; {
                 'windows' =&gt; {
                   description =&gt; 'Windows support',
                   paths =&gt; ['lib/Foo/Win32.pm'],
                 }
               },
             );

           Instead of ignoring a set of files, you can use "features" option to let their  prerequisites  belong
           to  a  specific feature that will not be installed unless asked. However, you are advised to create a
           separate distribution for the specific feature.

       optional, optional_re
           Instead of ignoring a set of files, you can also use "optional" option to mark all the  prerequisites
           found  in  some  of  the  files  in  your  distribution  optional (i.e. suggests). You can specify (a
           reference to) a list of files (with "optional" option), or a  regular  expression  that  matches  the
           files (with "optional_re" option).

       private, private_re
           Your  distribution  may  use private modules that are not uploaded to the CPAN and thus should not be
           included in "cpanfile". You can specify (a reference to)  a  list  of  those  private  modules  (with
           "private" option) or a regular expression that matches those modules (with "private_re" option).

       use_index, index
           Perl::PrereqScanner::NotQuiteLite::App  usually  lists  all  the "use"d modules as prerequisites, but
           some of them may belong to the same distribution. If an instance of  CPAN::Common::Index  backend  is
           passed, it is used to dedupe those prerequisites (as long as they are not versioned).

             use CPAN::Common::Index::LocalPackage;
             my $index = CPAN::Common::Index::LocalPackage-&gt;new(
               { source =&gt; "$ENV{HOME}/minicpan/modules/02packages.details.txt" }
             );
             my $app = Perl::PrereqScanner::NotQuiteLite::App-&gt;new(
               index =&gt; $index,
             );

   <b>run</b>
       traverses   files   and  directories  and  returns  a  CPAN::Meta::Prereqs  object  that  keeps  all  the
       requirements/suggestions, without printing anything unless you explicitly pass a "print" option to "new".

   <b>index</b>
       returns a CPAN::Common::Index backend object (if any).
