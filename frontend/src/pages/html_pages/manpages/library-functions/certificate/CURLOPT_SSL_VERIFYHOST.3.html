</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST - verify the certificate's name against host

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;curl/curl.h&gt;

       CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST, long verify);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Pass a long set to 2L to make libcurl verify the host in the server's TLS certificate.

       When negotiating a TLS connection, the server sends a certificate indicating its identity.

       When  <u><a href="../man3/CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST.3.html">CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST</a>(3)</u>  is  set to 1 or 2, the server certificate must indicate that it was made
       for the hostname or address curl connects to, or the connection fails. Simply put, it  means  it  has  to
       have the same name in the certificate as is used in the URL you operate against.

       curl  considers  the server the intended one when the Common Name field or a Subject Alternate Name field
       in the certificate matches the hostname in the URL to which you told curl to connect.

       When the <u>verify</u> value is 0, the connection succeeds regardless of the names in the certificate. Use  that
       ability with caution,

       This   option   controls   checking   the   server's   certificate's   claimed   identity.  The  separate
       <u><a href="../man3/CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER.3.html">CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER</a>(3)</u> options enables/disables verification that  the  certificate  is  signed  by  a
       trusted Certificate Authority.

       WARNING: disabling verification of the certificate allows bad guys to man-in-the-middle the communication
       without  you  knowing it. Disabling verification makes the communication insecure. Just having encryption
       on a transfer is not enough as you cannot be sure that you are communicating with the correct end-point.

       When libcurl uses secure  protocols  it  trusts  responses  and  allows  for  example  HSTS  and  Alt-Svc
       information to be stored and used subsequently. Disabling certificate verification can make libcurl trust
       and use such information from malicious servers.

</pre><h4><b>MATCHING</b></h4><pre>
       A certificate can have the name as a wildcard. The only asterisk (<u>*</u>) must then be the left-most character
       and  it must be followed by a period. The wildcard must further contain more than one period as it cannot
       be set for a top-level domain.

       A certificate can be set for a numerical IP address (IPv4 or IPv6), but  then  it  should  be  a  Subject
       Alternate Name kind and its type should correctly identify the field as an IP address.

</pre><h4><b>LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Secure  Transport: If <u>verify</u> value is 0, then SNI is also disabled. SNI is a TLS extension that sends the
       hostname to the server. The server may use that information to do such things as sending back a  specific
       certificate  for  the hostname, or forwarding the request to a specific origin server. Some hostnames may
       be inaccessible if SNI is not sent.

</pre><h4><b>DEFAULT</b></h4><pre>
       2

</pre><h4><b>PROTOCOLS</b></h4><pre>
       This functionality affects all TLS based protocols: HTTPS, FTPS, IMAPS, POP3S, SMTPS etc.

       All TLS backends support this option.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       int main(void)
       {
         CURL *curl = curl_easy_init();
         if(curl) {
           curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "https://example.com");

           /* Set the default value: strict name check please */
           curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST, 2L);

           curl_easy_perform(curl);
         }
       }

</pre><h4><b>AVAILABILITY</b></h4><pre>
       Added in curl 7.8.1

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       In 7.28.0 and earlier: the value 1 was treated as a debug option of some sorts, not supported anymore due
       to frequently leading to programmer mistakes.

       From 7.28.1 to 7.65.3: setting it to 1 made <u><a href="../man3/curl_easy_setopt.3.html">curl_easy_setopt</a>(3)</u> return an  error  and  leaving  the  flag
       untouched.

       From 7.66.0: libcurl treats 1 and 2 to this option the same.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       <u><a href="../man3/curl_easy_setopt.3.html">curl_easy_setopt</a>(3)</u> returns a CURLcode indicating success or error.

       CURLE_OK (0) means everything was OK, non-zero means an error occurred, see <u><a href="../man3/libcurl-errors.3.html">libcurl-errors</a>(3)</u>.
