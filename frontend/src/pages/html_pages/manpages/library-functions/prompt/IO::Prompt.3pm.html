</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       IO::Prompt - Interactively prompt for user input

</pre><h4><b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       This module is no longer being maintained.

       Use the IO::Prompter module instead.

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This document describes IO::Prompt version 0.997004

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use IO::Prompt;
           while( prompt "next: " ) {
               print "You said '$_'\n";
           }

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       By default, this module exports a single function "prompt".  It prompts the user to enter some input, and
       returns an object that represents the user input.

       You may specify various flags to the function to affect its behaviour; most notably, it defaults to
       automatically "chomp" the input, unless the "-line" flag is specified.

       Two other functions are exported at request: "hand_print", which simulates hand-typing to the console;
       and "get_input", which is the lower-level function that actually prompts the user for a suitable input.

       Note that this is an interim re-release. A full release with better documentation will follow in the near
       future. Meanwhile, please consult the <u>examples</u> directory from this module's CPAN distribution to better
       understand how to make use of this module.

</pre><h4><b>INTERFACE</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Arguments</b> <b>to</b> <b>"prompt"</b>
       Any argument not of the following forms is treated as part of the text of the prompt itself.

        Flag   Long form      Arg          Effect
        ----   ---------      ---          ------
                              &lt;str&gt;        Use &lt;str&gt; as prompt

                              &lt;filehandle&gt; Prompt to specified filehandle

                              &lt;hashref&gt;    Flatten hash entries into argument list
                                           (useful for aggregating the options below)

        -p     -prompt        &lt;str&gt;        Specify prompt explicitly

        -s     -speed         &lt;num&gt;        Simulated typing speed (seconds/char)

        -e     -echo          &lt;str&gt;        What to echo for each char typed

        -nl    -newline       &lt;str&gt;        When a newline is typed, echo &lt;str&gt; instead

        -d     -default       &lt;str&gt;        What to return if only &lt;return&gt; pressed

        -r     -require       &lt;hashref&gt;    Each value of each entry must 'smartmatch'
                                           the input else corresponding key is printed
                                           as error message:
                                            - Subs must return true when passed input
                                            - Regexes must pattern match input
                                            - Strings must eq match input
                                            - Arrays are flattened &amp; recursively matched
                                            - Hashes must return true for input as key

        -u     -until         &lt;str|rgx&gt;    Fail if input matches &lt;str|regex&gt;
               -fail_if

        -w     -while         &lt;str|rgx&gt;    Fail unless input matches &lt;str|regex&gt;
               -okay_if

        -m     -menu          &lt;list|hash&gt;  Show the data specified as a menu
                                           and allow one to be selected. Enter
                                           an &lt;ESC&gt; to back up one level.

        -1     -one_char                   Return immediately after first char typed

        -x     -escape                     Pressing &lt;ESC&gt; returns "\e" immediately

        -raw   -raw_input                  Return only the string that was input
                                           (turns off context-sensitive features)

        -c     -clear                      Clear screen before prompt
        -f     -clear_first                Clear screen before first prompt only

        -a     -argv                       Load @ARGV from input if @ARGV empty

        -l     -line                       Don't autochomp

        -t     -tty                        Prompt to terminal no matter what

        -y     -yes                        Return true if [yY] entered, false otherwise
        -yn    -yes_no                     Return true if [yY], false if [nN]
        -Y     -Yes                        Return true if 'Y' entered, false otherwise
        -YN    -Yes_No                     Return true if 'Y', false if 'N'

        -num   -number                     Accept only valid numbers as input
        -i     -integer                    Accept only valid integers as input

       Note that the underscores between words in flags like "-one_char" and "-yes_no" are optional.

       Flags can be "cuddled". For example:

            prompt("next: ", -tyn1s=&gt;0.2)   # -tty, -yes, -no, -one_char, -speed=&gt;0.2

   <b>"Hand-written"</b> <b>printing</b> <b>via</b> <b>"hand_print()"</b>
       The "hand_print()" subroutine takes a string and prints it out in the stop-and-start manner of hand-typed
       text.

   <b>Low-level</b> <b>input</b> <b>retrieval</b> <b>via</b> <b>"get_input()"</b>
       The "get_input()" subroutine is a low-level utility subroutine that takes an input filehandle, an output
       filehandle, a reference to a hash of options (as listed for "prompt()", above) and a single prompt
       string. It prints the prompt and retreives the input. You almost certainly want to use "prompt()"
       instead.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       "Can't write prompt to read-only $_"
           You  specified  a  filehandle  to  which  the  prompt  should be written, but that filehandle was not
           writeable. Did you pass the wrong filehandle, or open it in the wrong mode?

       "Missing argument for %s option"
           The flag you specified takes an argument, but you didn't provide that argument.

       "Unknown flag ($s) in prompt"
           The flag you specified wasn't one of those that "prompt()" understands. Did you misspell it, perhaps?

       "Argument to -require must be hash reference"
           The "-require" option takes a single argument that is a hash. You tried to pass  it  something  else.
           Try a hash instead.

       "Cannot write to terminal: %s"
       "Cannot read from terminal: %s"
           "prompt()"  attempted  to  access  the  terminal  but couldn't. This may mean your environment has no
           "/dev/tty" available, in which case there isn't much you can do with this module. Sorry.

       "Can't open %s: %s"
           "prompt()" tried to read input via *ARGV from a file specified on  the  command-line,  but  the  file
           couldn't  be opened for the reason shown. This is usually either a permission problem, a non-existent
           file, or a mistyped filepath.

       "Argument to -menu must be hash or array reference"
           The "-menu" option requires an argument that is either an array:

               prompt -menu=&gt;['yes', 'no', 'maybe'];

           or a hash:

               prompt -menu=&gt;{yes=&gt;1, no=&gt;0, maybe=&gt;0.5};

           or a hash of hashes (of hashes (of array))

       "Too many -menu items"
       "Too few -menu items"
           A menu can't have fewer than 1 or more than 26 items.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>AND</b> <b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       IO::Prompt requires no configuration files or environment variables.

</pre><h4><b>DEPENDENCIES</b></h4><pre>
       IO::Prompt requires the following modules:

       •   version

       •   IO::Handle

       •   Term::ReadKey

</pre><h4><b>INCOMPATIBILITIES</b></h4><pre>
       The module requires a /dev/tty device be available. It is therefore incompatible  with  any  system  that
       doesn't provide such a device.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       No bugs have been reported.

       Please  report  any bugs or feature requests to "<a href="mailto:bug-io-prompt@rt.cpan.org">bug-io-prompt@rt.cpan.org</a>", or through the web interface
       at &lt;<a href="http://rt.cpan.org">http://rt.cpan.org</a>&gt;.

</pre><h4><b>FAQ</b></h4><pre>
       This is a collection of things that might help.  Please send your questions that are not answered here to
       Damian Conway "&lt;<a href="mailto:DCONWAY@cpan.org">DCONWAY@cpan.org</a>&gt;"

   <b>Can</b> <b>I</b> <b>use</b> <b>this</b> <b>module</b> <b>with</b> <b>ActivePerl</b> <b>on</b> <b>Windows?</b>
       Up to now, the answer was 'No', but this has changed.

       You still cannot use ActivePerl, but if you use the Cygwin environment (<a href="http://sources.redhat.com">http://sources.redhat.com</a>), which
       brings its own perl, and have the latest IO::Tty (v0.05 or later) installed,  it  should  work  (feedback
       appreciated).

</pre><h4><b>THANKS</b></h4><pre>
       My deepest gratitude to Autrijus Tang and Brian Ingerson, who have taken care of this module for the past
       twelve months, while I was off trekking in the highlands of Perl 6. Now it's their turn for some mountain
       air, I'll be looking after this module again.
