</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Search::Xapian::PositionIterator - Iterate over sets of positions.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This iterator represents a stream of positions for a term. It overloads "++" for advancing the iterator,
       or you can explicitly call the "inc" method.  This class also overloads "eq", "ne", "==", "!=", ""
       (stringification) and "0+" (conversion to an integer).

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       new Constructor. Defaults to an uninitialized iterator.

       clone
       inc Advance the iterator by one. (Called implictly by "++" overloading).

       skip_to &lt;termpos&gt;
           Skip the iterator to term position termpos, or the first term position after termpos if termpos isn't
           in the list of term positions being iterated.

       equal &lt;term&gt;
           Checks if a term is the same as this term. Also overloaded to the "eq" and "==" operators.

       nequal &lt;term&gt;
           Checks if a term is different from this term. Also overloaded to the "ne" and "!=" operators.

       get_termpos
           Return the term position the iterator is currently on. Also implemented as conversion to an integer.

       get_description
           Return a description of this object.  Also implemented as stringification.
