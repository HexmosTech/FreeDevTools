</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  Simple  Authentication  and  Security  Layer  (SASL) is a framework for providing authentication and
       authorization to comunications protocols. The SASL framework is structured to permit negotiation among  a
       number  of  authentication mechanisms. SASL may be used in SMTP, IMAP and HTTP authentication. It is also
       in use in XMPP, LDAP and BEEP. See <b>MECHANISMS</b> for the set of  available  SASL  mechanisms  provided  with
       tcllib.

       The  SASL  framework  operates using a simple multi-step challenge response mechanism. All the mechanisms
       work the same way although the number of steps may vary. In this implementation a callback procedure must
       be provided from which the SASL framework will obtain users details. See <b>CALLBACK</b> <b>PROCEDURE</b>  for  details
       of this procedure.

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>::SASL::new</b> <u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>?...?</u>
              Contruct  a  new  SASL context. See <b>OPTIONS</b> for details of the possible options to this command. A
              context token is required for most of the SASL procedures.

       <b>::SASL::configure</b> <u>option</u> <u>value</u> ?<u>...</u>?
              Modify and inspect the SASL context option. See <b>OPTIONS</b> for further details.

       <b>::SASL::step</b> <u>context</u> <u>challenge</u> ?<u>...</u>?
              This is the core procedure for using the SASL framework. The <b>step</b> procedure should be called until
              it returns 0. Each step takes a server challenge string and the response is calculated and  stored
              in  the  context.  Each  mechanism  may  require one or more steps. For some steps there may be no
              server challenge required in which case an empty string should be provided for this parameter. All
              mechanisms should accept an initial empty challenge.

       <b>::SASL::response</b> <u>context</u>
              Returns the next response string that should be sent to the server.

       <b>::SASL::reset</b> <u>context</u>
              Re-initialize the SASL context. Discards any internal state and permits the token to be reused.

       <b>::SASL::cleanup</b> <u>context</u>
              Release all resources associated with the SASL context. The context token may not  be  used  again
              after this procedure has been called.

       <b>::SASL::mechanisms</b> ?<u>type</u>? ?<u>minimum</u>?
              Returns  a  list  of  all  the  available  SASL  mechanisms.  The  list is sorted by the mechanism
              preference value (see <b>register</b>) with the preferred mechanisms  and  the  head  of  the  list.  Any
              mechanism  with  a preference value less than the<u>minimum</u> (which defaults to 0) is removed from the
              returned list. This permits a security threshold to be set. Mechanisms with a preference less that
              25 transmit authentication are  particularly  susceptible  to  eavesdropping  and  should  not  be
              provided unless a secure channel is in use (eg: tls).

              The  <u>type</u>  parameter  may be one of <u>client</u> or <u>server</u> and defaults to <u>client</u>.  Only mechanisms that
              have an implementation matching the <u>type</u> are returned (this permits servers to  correctly  declare
              support only for mechanisms that actually provide a server implementation).

       <b>::SASL::register</b> <u>mechanism</u> <u>preference</u> <u>clientproc</u> ?<u>serverproc</u>?
              New  mechanisms can be added to the package by registering the mechanism name and the implementing
              procedures. The server procedure is optional. The preference value is an integer that is  used  to
              order  the  list returned by the <b>mechanisms</b> command. Higher values indicate a preferred mechanism.
              If the mechanism is already registered then the recorded values are updated.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-callback</b>
              Specify a command to be evaluated when the SASL mechanism requires information about the user. The
              command is called with the current SASL context and a name specifying the information desired. See
              <b>EXAMPLES</b>.

       <b>-mechanism</b>
              Set the SASL mechanism to  be  used.  See  <b>mechanisms</b>  for  a  list  of  supported  authentication
              mechanisms.

       <b>-service</b>
              Set  the service type for this context. Some mechanisms may make use of this parameter (eg DIGEST-
              MD5, GSSAPI and Kerberos). If not set it defaults to an empty string.  If  the  <b>-type</b>  is  set  to
              'server'  then  this  option  should  be  set  to a valid service identity. Some examples of valid
              service names are smtp, ldap, beep and xmpp.

       <b>-server</b>
              This option is used to set the server name used in  SASL  challenges  when  operating  as  a  SASL
              server.

       <b>-type</b>  The  context  type  may  be  one  of  'client'  or 'server'. The default is to operate as a client
              application and respond to server challenges. Mechanisms may be  written  to  support  server-side
              SASL  and setting this option will cause each <b>step</b> to issue the next challenge. A new context must
              be created for each incoming client connection when in server mode.

</pre><h4><b>CALLBACK</b> <b>PROCEDURE</b></h4><pre>
       When the SASL framework requires any user details it will call the procedure provided  when  the  context
       was created with an argument that specfies the item of information required.

       In all cases a single response string should be returned.

       login  The  callback  procedure  should  return the users authorization identity.  Return an empty string
              unless this is to be different to the authentication identity. Read [1] for a discussion about the
              specific meaning of authorization and authentication identities within SASL.

       username
              The callback procedure should return the users authentication identity.  Read [1] for a discussion
              about the specific meaning of authorization and authentication identities within SASL.

       password
              The callback procedure should return the password that matches the authentication identity as used
              within the current realm.

              For server mechanisms the password callback  should  always  be  called  with  the  authentication
              identity and the realm as the first two parameters.

       realm  Some  SASL  mechanisms  use  realms  to  partition authentication identities.  The realm string is
              protocol dependent and is often the current DNS domain or in the case of the NTLM mechanism it  is
              the Windows NT domain name.

       hostname
              Returns the client host name - typically [info host].

</pre><h4><b>MECHANISMS</b></h4><pre>
       ANONYMOUS
              As  used  in  FTP  this  mechanism  only passes an email address for authentication. The ANONYMOUS
              mechanism is specified in [2].

       PLAIN  This is the simplest mechanism. The users authentication details are transmitted  in  plain  text.
              This  mechanism should not be provided unless an encrypted link is in use - typically after SSL or
              TLS has been negotiated.

       LOGIN  The LOGIN [1] mechanism transmits the users details with base64 encoding. This is no  more  secure
              than PLAIN and likewise should not be used without a secure link.

       CRAM-MD5
              This  mechanism  avoids  sending  the users password over the network in plain text by hashing the
              password with a server provided random value (known as a nonce). A disadvantage of this  mechanism
              is  that  the  server must maintain a database of plaintext passwords for comparison. CRAM-MD5 was
              defined in [4].

       DIGEST-MD5
              This mechanism improves upon the CRAM-MD5 mechanism by avoiding the need for the server  to  store
              plaintext  passwords.  With  digest authentication the server needs to store the MD5 digest of the
              users password which helps to make the system more secure. As in CRAM-MD5 the password  is  hashed
              with a server nonce and other data before being transmitted across the network. Specified in [3].

       OTP    OTP  is  the One-Time Password system described in RFC 2289 [6].  This mechanism is secure against
              replay attacks and also avoids storing password or password equivalents  on  the  server.  Only  a
              digest of a seed and a passphrase is ever transmitted across the network. Requires the <b>otp</b> package
              from  tcllib  and  one  or  more  of  the cryptographic digest packages (md5 or sha-1 are the most
              commonly used).

       NTLM   This is a proprietary protocol developed by Microsoft [5] and is in common use for  authenticating
              users  in  a  Windows  network  environment. NTLM uses DES encryption and MD4 digests of the users
              password to authenticate a connection. Certain weaknesses have been found in NTLM and  thus  there
              are  a  number  of  versions of the protocol.  As this mechanism has additional dependencies it is
              made available as a separate sub-package. To enable this mechanism your application must load  the
              <b>SASL::NTLM</b> package.

       X-GOOGLE-TOKEN
              This  is  a  proprietary  protocol  developed  by Google and used for authenticating users for the
              Google Talk service. This mechanism makes a pair of HTTP requests over an SSL channel and so  this
              mechanism  depends  upon  the  availability of the tls and http packages. To enable this mechanism
              your application must load the <b>SASL::XGoogleToken</b> package.  In addition  you  are  recommended  to
              make use of the autoproxy package to handle HTTP proxies reasonably transparently.

       SCRAM  This  is a protocol specified in RFC 5802 [7]. To enable this mechanism your application must load
              the <b>SASL::SCRAM</b> package.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       See the examples subdirectory for more complete samples using SASL with network protocols. The  following
       should  give  an  idea how the SASL commands are to be used. In reality this should be event driven. Each
       time the <b>step</b> command is called, the last server response should be provided as the command  argument  so
       that the SASL mechanism can take appropriate action.

              proc ClientCallback {context command args} {
                  switch -exact -- $command {
                      login    { return "" }
                      username { return $::tcl_platform(user) }
                      password { return "SecRet" }
                      realm    { return "" }
                      hostname { return [info host] }
                      default  { return -code error unxpected }
                  }
              }

              proc Demo {{mech PLAIN}} {
                  set ctx [SASL::new -mechanism $mech -callback ClientCallback]
                  set challenge ""
                  while {1} {
                      set more_steps [SASL::step $ctx challenge]
                      puts "Send '[SASL::response $ctx]'"
                      puts "Read server response into challenge var"
                      if {!$more_steps} {break}
                  }
                  SASL::cleanup $ctx
              }
