</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       tk_getOpenFile, tk_getSaveFile - pop up a dialog box for the user to select a file to open or save.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>tk_getOpenFile</b> ?<u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>...</u>?
       <b>tk_getSaveFile</b> ?<u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>...</u>?
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  procedures  <b>tk_getOpenFile</b>  and  <b>tk_getSaveFile</b> pop up a dialog box for the user to select a file to
       open or save. The <b>tk_getOpenFile</b> command is usually associated with the <b>Open</b> command in  the  <b>File</b>  menu.
       Its  purpose is for the user to select an existing file <u>only</u>. If the user enters a non-existent file, the
       dialog box gives the user an error prompt and requires the user to give an alternative selection.  If  an
       application  allows  the  user  to  create  new  files,  it should do so by providing a separate <b>New</b> menu
       command.

       The <b>tk_getSaveFile</b> command is usually associated with the <b>Save</b> <b>as</b> command in the <b>File</b> menu. If  the  user
       enters  a file that already exists, the dialog box prompts the user for confirmation whether the existing
       file should be overwritten or not.

       The following <u>option-value</u> pairs are possible as command line arguments to these two commands:

       <b>-command</b> <u>string</u>
              Specifies the prefix of a Tcl command to invoke when the  user  closes  the  dialog  after  having
              selected an item. This callback is not called if the user cancelled the dialog. The actual command
              consists  of  <u>string</u> followed by a space and the value selected by the user in the dialog. This is
              only available on macOS.

       <b>-confirmoverwrite</b> <u>boolean</u>
              Configures how the Save dialog reacts when the selected file  already  exists,  and  saving  would
              overwrite  it.   A  true  value  requests a confirmation dialog be presented to the user.  A false
              value requests that the overwrite take place without confirmation.  Default value is true.

       <b>-defaultextension</b> <u>extension</u>
              Specifies a string that will be appended to the filename if the user enters a filename without  an
              extension. The default value is the empty string, which means no extension will be appended to the
              filename  in  any  case.  This  option  is  ignored on macOS, which does not require extensions to
              filenames, and the UNIX implementation guesses reasonable values  for  this  from  the  <b>-filetypes</b>
              option when this is not supplied.

       <b>-filetypes</b> <u>filePatternList</u>
              If  a  <b>File</b>  <b>types</b> listbox exists in the file dialog on the particular platform, this option gives
              the <u>filetype</u>s in this listbox. When the user choose a filetype in the listbox, only the  files  of
              that  type are listed. If this option is unspecified, or if it is set to the empty list, or if the
              <b>File</b> <b>types</b> listbox is not  supported  by  the  particular  platform  then  all  files  are  listed
              regardless  of their types. See the section <b>SPECIFYING</b> <b>FILE</b> <b>PATTERNS</b> below for a discussion on the
              contents of <u>filePatternList</u>.

       <b>-initialdir</b> <u>directory</u>
              Specifies that the files in <u>directory</u> should be  displayed  when  the  dialog  pops  up.  If  this
              parameter  is  not  specified,  the initial directory defaults to the current working directory on
              non-Windows systems and on Windows systems prior to  Vista.   On  Vista  and  later  systems,  the
              initial  directory  defaults  to  the  last  user-selected  directory  for the application. If the
              parameter specifies a relative path, the return  value  will  convert  the  relative  path  to  an
              absolute path.

       <b>-initialfile</b> <u>filename</u>
              Specifies a filename to be displayed in the dialog when it pops up.

       <b>-message</b> <u>string</u>
              Specifies a message to include in the client area of the dialog.  This is only available on macOS.

       <b>-multiple</b> <u>boolean</u>
              Allows the user to choose multiple files from the Open dialog.

       <b>-parent</b> <u>window</u>
              Makes  <u>window</u>  the  logical  parent of the file dialog. The file dialog is displayed on top of its
              parent window. On macOS, this turns the file dialog into a sheet attached to the parent window.

       <b>-title</b> <u>titleString</u>
              Specifies a string to display as the title of the dialog box. If this  option  is  not  specified,
              then a default title is displayed.

       <b>-typevariable</b> <u>variableName</u>
              The  global  variable  <u>variableName</u> is used to preselect which filter is used from <u>filterList</u> when
              the dialog box is opened and is updated when the dialog  box  is  closed,  to  the  last  selected
              filter.  The  variable  is  read  once  at  the beginning to select the appropriate filter. If the
              variable does not exist, or its value does not match any filter typename, or is  empty  (<b>{}</b>),  the
              dialog  box  will revert to the default behavior of selecting the first filter in the list. If the
              dialog is canceled, the variable is not modified.

       If the user selects a file, both <b>tk_getOpenFile</b> and <b>tk_getSaveFile</b> return the full pathname of this file.
       If the user cancels the operation, both commands return the empty string.

</pre><h4><b>SPECIFYING</b> <b>FILE</b> <b>PATTERNS</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>filePatternList</u> value given by the <b>-filetypes</b> option is a list of file patterns. Each file pattern is
       a list of the form
              <u>typeName</u> {<u>extension</u> ?<u>extension</u> <u>...</u>?} ?{<u>macType</u> ?<u>macType</u> <u>...</u>?}?
       <u>typeName</u> is the name of the file type described by this file pattern and is the text string that  appears
       in  the  <b>File</b>  <b>types</b>  listbox.  <u>extension</u>  is a file extension for this file pattern.  <u>macType</u> is a four-
       character Macintosh file type. The list of <u>macType</u>s is optional and may be omitted for applications  that
       do not need to execute on the Macintosh platform.

       Several  file  patterns  may  have  the same <u>typeName,</u> in which case they refer to the same file type and
       share the same entry in the listbox. When the user selects an entry in the listbox, all  the  files  that
       match  at  least  one  of  the  file  patterns corresponding to that entry are listed. Usually, each file
       pattern corresponds to a distinct type of file. The use of more than one file pattern  for  one  type  of
       file is only necessary on the Macintosh platform.

       On  the  Macintosh  platform,  a  file  matches  a  file  pattern if its name matches at least one of the
       <u>extension</u>(s) AND it belongs to at least one of the <u>macType</u>(s) of the file pattern.  For  example,  the  <b>C</b>
       <b>Source</b>  <b>Files</b>  file  pattern in the sample code matches with files that have a <b>.c</b> extension AND belong to
       the <u>macType</u> <b>TEXT</b>. To use the OR rule instead, you can use two file patterns, one with the <u>extensions</u> only
       and the other with the <u>macType</u> only. The <b>GIF</b> <b>Files</b> file type in the sample code matches files that <u>either</u>
       have a <b>.gif</b> extension OR belong to the <u>macType</u> <b>GIFF</b>.

       On the Unix and Windows platforms, a file matches a file pattern if its name matches at least one of  the
       <u>extension</u>(s) of the file pattern. The <u>macType</u>s are ignored.

</pre><h4><b>SPECIFYING</b> <b>EXTENSIONS</b></h4><pre>
       On  the  Unix  and  Macintosh platforms, extensions are matched using glob-style pattern matching. On the
       Windows platform, extensions are matched by the  underlying  operating  system.  The  types  of  possible
       extensions are:

       (1)    the special extension “*” matches any file;

       (2)    the  special  extension  “”  matches  any  files that do not have an extension (i.e., the filename
              contains no full stop character);

       (3)    any character string that does not contain any wild card characters (* and ?).

       Due to the different pattern matching rules on the various platforms, to ensure  portability,  wild  card
       characters are not allowed in the extensions, except as in the special extension “*”.  Extensions without
       a full stop character (e.g.  “~”) are allowed but may not work on all platforms.

                  {{GIF Files}        {}        GIFF}
                  {{All Files}        *             }
              }
              set filename [<b>tk_getOpenFile</b> -filetypes $types]

              if {$filename ne ""} {
                  # Open the file ...
