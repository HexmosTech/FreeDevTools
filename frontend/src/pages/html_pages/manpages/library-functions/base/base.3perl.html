</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       base - Establish an ISA relationship with base classes at compile time

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           package Baz;
           use base qw(Foo Bar);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Unless you are using the "fields" pragma, consider this module discouraged in favor of the lighter-weight
       "parent".

       Allows you to both load one or more modules, while setting up inheritance from those modules at the same
       time.  Roughly similar in effect to

           package Baz;
           BEGIN {
               require Foo;
               require Bar;
               push @ISA, qw(Foo Bar);
           }

       When "base" tries to "require" a module, it will not die if it cannot find the module's file, but will
       die on any other error.  After all this, should your base class be empty, containing no symbols, "base"
       will die. This is useful for inheriting from classes in the same file as yourself but where the filename
       does not match the base module name, like so:

               # in Bar.pm
               package Foo;
               sub exclaim { "I can have such a thing?!" }

               package Bar;
               use base "Foo";

       There is no <u>Foo.pm</u>, but because "Foo" defines a symbol (the "exclaim" subroutine), "base" will not die
       when the "require" fails to load <u>Foo.pm</u>.

       "base" will also initialize the fields if one of the base classes has it.  Multiple inheritance of fields
       is <b>NOT</b> supported, if two or more base classes each have inheritable fields the 'base' pragma will croak.
       See fields for a description of this feature.

       The base class' "import" method is <b>not</b> called.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       Base class package "%s" is empty.
           base.pm was unable to require the base package, because it was not found in your path.

       Class 'Foo' tried to inherit from itself
           Attempting to inherit from yourself generates a warning.

               package Foo;
               use base 'Foo';

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       This module was introduced with Perl 5.004_04.

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
       Due  to  the  limitations  of  the  implementation,  you must use base <u>before</u> you declare any of your own
       fields.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
