</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       POD2::Base - Base module for translations of Perl documentation

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use POD2::Base;
           $pod2 = POD2::Base-&gt;new({ lang =&gt; 'EO' });

           @dirs = $pod2-&gt;pod_dirs;
           $re = $pod2-&gt;search_perlfunc_re;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module is an abstraction of the code in POD2::IT and POD2::FR. These modules belong to the Italian
       and the French translation projects of core Perl pods.

       Once a translation package had been installed, the translated documentation can be accessed with:

           $ perldoc POD2::&lt;lang&gt;::&lt;podname&gt;

       (where &lt;lang&gt; is a language abbreviation like IT, FR, TLH, etc.)

       This is guaranteed to work even for older versions of perldoc. It is not very convenient but always
       works.

       To improve the support to read translated docs, the perldoc utility (since version 3.14_01) was updated
       to find translated PODs via:

           $ perldoc -L IT &lt;podpage&gt;
           $ perldoc -L FR -f &lt;function&gt;
           $ perldoc -L TH -q &lt;FAQregex&gt;

       (<u>Note</u>: this support was shipped together with the recently released 5.10.0 version the Perl interpreter.)

       The objective of this class is to provide a minimum base to help "perldoc" and authors of translation
       packages to do their job.

</pre><h4><b>SUBCLASSING</b></h4><pre>
       If you want to write a translation package (and have some customization needs), your work may be
       diminished if you subclass "Pod::Base".

       For example, a minimum example is provided below:

           package POD2::TLH; # Klingon

           use POD2::Base;
           our @ISA = qw( POD2::Base );

           sub search_perlfunc_re { # makes 'perldoc -f' work
               return 'Klingon Listing of Perl Functions';
           }

           1;

       And then

           $ perldoc -L tlh perlintro

       will present you the introduction of Perl in Klingon language (provided a <u>POD2/TLH/perlintro.pod</u> file was
       shipped together with <u>POD2/TLH.pm</u>) and

           $ perldoc -L tlh -f pack

       will find you the Klingon documentation of "pack" (if <u>POD2/TLH/perlfunc.pod</u> was made available as well).

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       This module has been made into a proper class with a very small API.

       <b>new</b>
               $pod2 = POD2::Base-&gt;new(\%args);
               $pod2 = POD2::ANY-&gt;new();

           The constructor. An actual call might look like this:

               $pod2 = POD2::Base-&gt;new({ lang =&gt; 'tlh' });

           where the supported options are:

           •   "lang"

               Specifies the language code we're interested in.  This is required, but can be extracted from the
               name of a subclass. Read below.

           •   "inc"

               This  is  used  to override the list of Perl library directories where POD documents are searched
               (namely, @INC). Most of the time, you don't want to mess with that.  It's handy for debugging and
               testing.

               It must be an array ref.

           If "POD2::ANY" is a subclass of "POD2::Base", the inherited constructor will work  without  arguments
           pulling 'ANY' from the package name and using it as the intented language code.

           Note  that  use  of  "inc"  in  the  constructor  freezes  the  list  of library dirs searched by the
           "POD2::Base" instance. If this is not used, the up-to-date @INC is used at each  call  of  "pod_dirs"
           (so that dynamic changes in the Perl library path are taken into account).  That's what we meant with
           the "Most of the time, you don't want to mess with that" mentioned above.

       <b>pod_dirs</b>
               @dirs = $pod2-&gt;pod_dirs;
               @dirs = $pod2-&gt;pod_dirs(\%options);

           Used by "Pod::Perldoc" to find out where to look for translated pods.

           The  "POD2::Base" default behavior is to find <u>POD2/&lt;lang&gt;/</u> directories under the current Perl library
           directories (@INC) or the list given as argument "inc" in the constructor.

           The supported options are:

           •   "test"

               By default, the return of "pod_dirs" do not include POD directories which do  not  exist  (tested
               with  "-d"). If an explicit false value for this option (like "test =&gt; 0") is given, such test is
               not done  and  "pod_dirs"  includes  all  possible  candidates  <u>POD2/&lt;lang&gt;/</u>  under  the  library
               directories.  (Handy for debugging this module. Not much practical use for anything else.)

       <b>search_perlfunc_re</b>
               $re = $pod2-&gt;search_perlfunc_re;

           To  implement  "perldoc  -f  &lt;function&gt;"  the current code of "Pod::Perldoc" uses a hard coded string
           "Alphabetical Listing of Perl Functions" or the return of this method  (in  a  regexp)  to  skip  the
           introduction  and  reach  the  listing  of  core  functions.   Thus  a  translation  package  with  a
           corresponding translated <u>perlfunc.pod</u> should define  this  method  to  make  "perldoc  -L  &lt;lang&gt;  -f
           &lt;function&gt;" work properly.

       There  are  other  methods documented below. However, they will probably be superseded in future versions
       when more general methods to find and display metadata on translated PODs are designed and implemented.

       <b>pod_info</b>
               $hashref = $pod2-&gt;pod_info;

           Used by "POD2::Base" itself. The return contains some metadata on the translated PODs which  is  used
           by the methods "print_pod" and "print_pods".

           When  subclassing, you <b>should</b> override this with the current information on what POD translations the
           current package is providing.

       <b>print_pods</b>
               $pod2-&gt;print_pods;

           Prints all translated pods and the corresponding Perl version of the original files.

       <b>print_pod</b>
               $pod2-&gt;print_pod(@pages);
               $pod2-&gt;print_pod(); # uses @ARGV

           Prints the corresponding Perl version of the original files  corresponding  to  the  pods  passed  as
           arguments.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>POD2::TLH</b>
       A slightly extended version of "POD2::TLH" goes like this:

           package POD2::TLH; # Klingon

           use POD2::Base;
           our @ISA = qw( POD2::Base );

           sub search_perlfunc_re {
               return 'Klingon Listing of Perl Functions';
           }

           sub pod_info {
               return { perlintro =&gt; '5.8.8' };
           }

           1;

       And you may try:

           use POD2::TLH;
           my $pod2 = 'POD2::TLH';
           $pod2-&gt;print_pods();
           $pod2-&gt;print_pod('pod_foo', 'pod_baz', ...);

   <b>THE</b> <b>INSTALLED</b> <b>FILES</b>
       If  you  want  to  find out which language-specific POD files are installed at your Perl, you could use a
       code similar to this.

           use File::Find;
           use POD2::Base;

           my $pod2 = POD2::Base-&gt;new({ lang =&gt; $lang });

           my @files;
           find sub { push @files, $File::Find::name } if -f },
                $pod2-&gt;pod_dirs;
           print "$_\n" for @files;

       In the "POD2-Base" distribution tarball, a script <u>eg/list.pl</u> is included with an improved version of this
       code.

       The rules of finding POD in <u>.pod</u>, <u>.pm</u> files and others belong to Pod::Perldoc. So "POD2::Base" do not try
       to repeat them here.
