</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       File::KDBX::Key::ChallengeResponse - A challenge-response key

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 0.906

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use File::KDBX::Key::ChallengeResponse;

           my $responder = sub {
               my $challenge = shift;
               ...;    # generate a response based on a secret of some sort
               return $response;
           };
           my $key = File::KDBX::Key::ChallengeResponse-&gt;new($responder);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       A challenge-response key is kind of like multifactor authentication, except you don't really <u>authenticate</u>
       to a KDBX database because it's not a service. Specifically it would be the "what you have" component. It
       assumes there is some device that can store a key that is only known to the owner of a database. A
       challenge is made to the device and the response generated based on the key is used as the raw key.

       Inherets methods and attributes from File::KDBX::Key.

       This is a generic implementation where a responder subroutine is provided to provide the response. There
       is also File::KDBX::Key::YubiKey which is a subclass that allows YubiKeys to be responder devices.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>raw_key</b>
           $raw_key = $key-&gt;raw_key;
           $raw_key = $key-&gt;raw_key($challenge);

       Get the raw key which is the response to a challenge. The response will be saved so that subsequent calls
       (with or without the challenge) can provide the response without challenging the responder again. Only
       one response is saved at a time; if you call this with a different challenge, the new response is saved
       over any previous response.

   <b>challenge</b>
           $response = $key-&gt;challenge($challenge, @options);

       Issue a challenge and get a response, or throw if the responder failed to provide one.
