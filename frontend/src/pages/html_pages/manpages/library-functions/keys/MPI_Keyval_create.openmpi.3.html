</pre><h4><b>INPUT</b> <b>PARAMETERS</b></h4><pre>
       • <b>copy_fn</b>: Copy callback function for keyval.

       • <b>delete_fn</b>: Delete callback function for keyval.

       • <b>extra_state</b>: Extra state for callback functions.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b> <b>PARAMETERS</b></h4><pre>
       • <b>keyval</b>: Key value for future access (integer).

       • <b>ierror</b>: Fortran only: Error status (integer).

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Note that use of this routine is <u>deprecated</u> as of MPI-2. Please use <u>MPI_Comm_create_keyval</u> instead.

       Generates a new attribute key. Keys are locally unique in a process and opaque to the user,  though  they
       are  explicitly stored in integers. Once allocated, the key value can be used to associate attributes and
       access them on any locally defined communicator.

       The copy_fn function is invoked when a communicator is duplicated by <u>MPI_Comm_dup</u>. copy_fn should  be  of
       type MPI_Copy_function, which is defined as follows:

          typedef int MPI_Copy_function(MPI_Comm oldcomm, int keyval,
                                        void *extra_state, void *attribute_val_in,
                                        void *attribute_val_out, int *flag)

       A Fortran declaration for such a function is as follows:

          SUBROUTINE COPY_FUNCTION(OLDCOMM, KEYVAL, EXTRA_STATE, ATTRIBUTE_VAL_IN,
                      ATTRIBUTE_VAL_OUT, FLAG, IERR)
          INTEGER OLDCOMM, KEYVAL, EXTRA_STATE,
          ATTRIBUTE_VAL_IN, ATTRIBUTE_VAL_OUT, IERR
          LOGICAL FLAG

       The  copy callback function is invoked for each key value in oldcomm in arbitrary order. Each call to the
       copy callback is made with a key value and its corresponding attribute. If it returns flag = 0, then  the
       attribute  is  deleted  in the duplicated communicator. Otherwise ( flag = 1), the new attribute value is
       set to the value returned in attribute_val_out. The function returns MPI_SUCCESS on success and an  error
       code on failure (in which case <u>MPI_Comm_dup</u> will fail).

       copy_fn  may be specified as MPI_NULL_COPY_FN or MPI_DUP_FN from either C or Fortran; MPI_NULL_COPY_FN is
       a function that does nothing other than return flag = 0, and MPI_SUCCESS. MPI_DUP_FN is  a  simple-minded
       copy function that sets flag = 1, returns the value of attribute_val_in in attribute_val_out, and returns
       MPI_SUCCESS.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       Key values are global (available for any and all communicators).

       There  are  subtle differences between C and Fortran that require that the copy_fn be written in the same
       language that <u>MPI_Keyval_create</u> is called from. This should  not  be  a  problem  for  most  users;  only
       programmers using both Fortran and C in the same program need to be sure that they follow this rule.

       Even  though  both formal arguments attribute_val_in and attribute_val_out are of type void*, their usage
       differs. The C copy function is passed by MPI in attribute_val_in the value  of  the  attribute,  and  in
       attribute_val_out the address of the attribute, so as to allow the function to return the (new) attribute
       value. The use of type <b>void</b> <b>*</b> for both is to avoid messy type casts.

       A  valid  copy function is one that completely duplicates the information by making a full duplicate copy
       of the data structures implied by an attribute; another might just make another reference  to  that  data
       structure, while using a reference-count mechanism. Other types of attributes might not copy at all (they
       might be specific to oldcomm only).

       Analogous  to  copy_fn  is  a  callback  deletion function, defined as follows. The delete_fn function is
       invoked when a  communicator  is  deleted  by  <u>MPI_Comm_free</u>  or  when  a  call  is  made  explicitly  to
       <u>MPI_Attr_delete</u>. delete_fn should be of type MPI_Delete_function, which is defined as follows:

          typedef int MPI_Delete_function(MPI_Comm comm, int keyval,
              void *attribute_val, void *extra_state);

       A Fortran declaration for such a function is as follows:

          SUBROUTINE DELETE_FUNCTION(COMM, KEYVAL,ATTRIBUTE_VAL, EXTRA_STATE, IERR)
              INTEGER COMM, KEYVAL, ATTRIBUTE_VAL, EXTRA_STATE, IERR

       This  function  is called by <u>MPI_Comm_free</u>, <u>MPI_Attr_delete</u>, and <u>MPI_Attr_put</u> to do whatever is needed to
       remove an attribute. The function returns MPI_SUCCESS on success and an error code on failure  (in  which
       case <u>MPI_Comm_free</u> will fail).

       delete_fn  may  be  specified  as  MPI_NULL_DELETE_FN  from  either C or FORTRAN; MPI_NULL_DELETE_FN is a
       function that does nothing, other than returning MPI_SUCCESS.

       The special key value MPI_KEYVAL_INVALID is never returned by <u>MPI_Keyval_create</u>.  Therefore,  it  can  be
       used for static initialization of key values.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       Almost  all  MPI  routines  return  an  error  value; C routines as the return result of the function and
       Fortran routines in the last argument.

       Before the error value is returned, the current MPI  error  handler  associated  with  the  communication
       object  (e.g.,  communicator, window, file) is called.  If no communication object is associated with the
       MPI call, then the call is considered attached to MPI_COMM_SELF and will call the  associated  MPI  error
       handler.   When   MPI_COMM_SELF   is   not  initialized  (i.e.,  before  <u>MPI_Init</u>/<u>MPI_Init_thread</u>,  after
       <u>MPI_Finalize</u>, or when using the Sessions Model exclusively) the error raises the initial  error  handler.
       The  initial  error handler can be changed by calling <u>MPI_Comm_set_errhandler</u> on MPI_COMM_SELF when using
       the World model, or the mpi_initial_errhandler CLI argument to mpiexec or info  key  to  <u>MPI_Comm_spawn</u>/‐
       <u>MPI_Comm_spawn_multiple</u>.   If no other appropriate error handler has been set, then the MPI_ERRORS_RETURN
       error handler is called for MPI I/O functions and the MPI_ERRORS_ABORT error handler is  called  for  all
       other MPI functions.

       Open MPI includes three predefined error handlers that can be used:

       • <b>MPI_ERRORS_ARE_FATAL</b> Causes the program to abort all connected MPI processes.

       • <b>MPI_ERRORS_ABORT</b> An error handler that can be invoked on a communicator, window, file, or session. When
         called  on  a  communicator,  it  acts  as if <u>MPI_Abort</u> was called on that communicator. If called on a
         window or file, acts as if <u>MPI_Abort</u> was called on a communicator containing the group of processes  in
         the corresponding window or file. If called on a session, aborts only the local process.

       • <b>MPI_ERRORS_RETURN</b> Returns an error code to the application.

       MPI applications can also implement their own error handlers by calling:

       • <u>MPI_Comm_create_errhandler</u> then <u>MPI_Comm_set_errhandler</u>

       • <u>MPI_File_create_errhandler</u> then <u>MPI_File_set_errhandler</u>

       • <u>MPI_Session_create_errhandler</u> then <u>MPI_Session_set_errhandler</u> or at <u>MPI_Session_init</u>

       • <u>MPI_Win_create_errhandler</u> then <u>MPI_Win_set_errhandler</u>

       Note that MPI does not guarantee that an MPI program can continue past an error.

       See the <u>MPI</u> <u>man</u> <u>page</u> for a full list of <u>MPI</u> <u>error</u> <u>codes</u>.

       See the Error Handling section of the MPI-3.1 standard for more information.
