</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       File::KDBX::Key - A credential that can protect a KDBX file

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 0.906

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       A master key is one or more credentials that can protect a KDBX database. When you encrypt a database
       with a master key, you will need the master key to decrypt it. <b>Keep</b> <b>your</b> <b>master</b> <b>key</b> <b>safe!</b> If someone
       gains access to your master key, they can open your database. If you forget or lose any part of your
       master key, all data in the database is lost.

       There are several different types of keys, each implemented as a subclass:

       •   File::KDBX::Key::Password - Password or passphrase, knowledge of a string of characters

       •   File::KDBX::Key::File - Possession of a file ("key file") with a secret

       •   File::KDBX::Key::ChallengeResponse - Possession of a device that responds correctly when challenged

       •   File::KDBX::Key::YubiKey - Possession of a YubiKey hardware device (a type of challenge-response)

       •   File::KDBX::Key::Composite - One or more keys combined as one

       A  good  master  key is produced from a high amount of "entropy" (unpredictability). The more entropy the
       better.  Combining multiple keys into a <b>Composite</b> key combines the entropy of each  individual  key.  For
       example,  if  you  have a weak password and you combine it with other keys, the composite key is stronger
       than the weak password key by itself. (Of course it's much better to not have any weak components of your
       master key.)

       <b>COMPATIBILITY</b> <b>NOTE:</b> Most KeePass implementations are limited in  the  types  and  numbers  of  keys  they
       support.   <b>Password</b> keys are pretty much universally supported. <b>File</b> keys are pretty well-supported. Many
       do not support challenge-response keys. If you are concerned about compatibility, you should  stick  with
       one of these well-supported configurations:

       •   One password

       •   One key file

       •   Composite of one password and one key file

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>new</b>
           $key = File::KDBX::Key-&gt;new({ password =&gt; $password });
           $key = File::KDBX::Key-&gt;new($password);

           $key = File::KDBX::Key-&gt;new({ file =&gt; $filepath });
           $key = File::KDBX::Key-&gt;new(\$file);
           $key = File::KDBX::Key-&gt;new(\*FILE);

           $key = File::KDBX::Key-&gt;new({ composite =&gt; [...] });
           $key = File::KDBX::Key-&gt;new([...]);         # composite key

           $key = File::KDBX::Key-&gt;new({ responder =&gt; \&amp;responder });
           $key = File::KDBX::Key-&gt;new(\&amp;responder);   # challenge-response key

       Construct a new key.

       The primitive used to construct the key is not saved but is immediately converted to a raw encryption key
       (see "raw_key").

       A  File::KDBX::Key::Composite  is  somewhat  special  in that it does retain a reference to its component
       keys, and its raw key is calculated from its components on demand.

   <b>init</b>
           $key = $key-&gt;init($primitive);

       Initialize a File::KDBX::Key with a new primitive. Returns itself to allow method chaining.

   <b>reload</b>
           $key = $key-&gt;reload;

       Reload a key by re-reading the key source and recalculating the raw key. Returns itself to  allow  method
       chaining.

   <b>raw_key</b>
           $raw_key = $key-&gt;raw_key;
           $raw_key = $key-&gt;raw_key($challenge);

       Get  the raw encryption key. This is calculated based on the primitive(s). The $challenge argument is for
       challenge-response type keys and is ignored by other types.

       <b>NOTE:</b> The raw key is sensitive information and so is memory-protected while not being  accessed.  If  you
       access it, you should memzero or "erase" in File::KDBX::Util it when you're done.

   <b>hide</b>
           $key = $key-&gt;hide;

       Put  the  raw  key  in  memory  protection.  Does nothing if the raw key is already in memory protection.
       Returns itself to allow method chaining.

   <b>show</b>
           $key = $key-&gt;show;

       Bring the raw key out of memory protection. Does nothing  if  the  raw  key  is  already  out  of  memory
       protection.  Returns itself to allow method chaining.

   <b>is_hidden</b>
           $bool = $key-&gt;is_hidden;

       Get whether or not the key's raw secret is currently in memory protection.
