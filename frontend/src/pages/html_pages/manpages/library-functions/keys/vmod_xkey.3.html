       vmod_xkey - Surrogate keys support for Varnish Cache

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
          import xkey [as name] [from "path"]

          INT purge(STRING keys)

          INT softpurge(STRING keys)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       PLEASE  NOTE  that  this  VMOD  is  currently  in  maintenance  mode  and  has  known performance issues,
       particularly regarding scalability, which will not be addressed in this implementation. For a more robust
       solution with proven scalability, improved syntax support, and proper softpurge  functionality,  consider
       using yKey, included in Varnish Enterprise.

       This vmod adds secondary hashes to objects, allowing fast purging on all objects with this hash key.

       You  can use this to indicate relationships, a bit like a "tag". Then clear out all object that have this
       tag set. Two good use cases are news sites, where one might add all the stories mentioned on a particular
       page by article ID, letting each article referenced create an xkey header.

       Similarly with an e-commerce site, where various SKUs are often referenced on a page.

       Hash keys are specified in the <b>xkey</b> response header. Multiple keys can be specified per header line  with
       spaces  and/or  commas  as  separators.  Alternatively,  they  can be specified in multiple <b>xkey</b> response
       headers.

       Preferably the secondary hash keys are set from the backend application, but the header can also  be  set
       from VCL in <b>vcl_backend_response</b>.

       VCL example:

          vcl 4.0;
          import xkey;

          backend default { .host = "192.0.2.11"; .port = "8080"; }

          acl purgers {
              "203.0.113.0"/24;
          }

          sub vcl_recv {
              if (req.method == "PURGE") {
                  if (client.ip !~ purgers) {
                      return (synth(403, "Forbidden"));
                  }
                  if (req.http.xkey) {
                      set req.http.n-gone = xkey.purge(req.http.xkey);
                      # or: set req.http.n-gone = xkey.softpurge(req.http.xkey)

                      return (synth(200, "Invalidated "+req.http.n-gone+" objects"));
                  } else {
                      return (purge);
                  }
              }
          }

   <b>Example</b>
       On  an  e-commerce  site  we  have the backend application issue an xkey header for every product that is
       referenced on that page. So the header for a certain page might look like this:

          HTTP/1.1 OK
          Server: Apache/2.2.15
          xkey: 8155054
          xkey: 166412
          xkey: 234323

       Alternatively you may instead use a single header with space separated values like <b>xkey:</b>  <b>8155054</b>  <b>166412</b>
       <b>234323</b>.

       This requires a bit of VCL to be in place. The VCL can be found above.

       Then,  in  order  to keep the web in sync with the database, a trigger is set up in the database. When an
       SKU is updated this will trigger an HTTP request towards the Varnish server, clearing  out  every  object
       with the matching xkey header:

          PURGE / HTTP/1.1
          Host: www.example.com
          xkey: 166412

       Several  <b>xkey-purge</b>  headers are also supported like in the response example above, and you may also here
       use a single header with space seperated values like <b>xkey-purge:</b> <b>166412</b> <b>234323</b>.

       Unlike <u>xkey</u> header for responses, purge header is fully configurable by means of adjusting  the  name  of
       the header in the VCL example above.

       Note  the  xkey  header. It is probably a good idea to protect this with an ACL so random people from the
       Internet cannot purge your cache.

       Varnish will find the objects and clear them out, responding with:

          HTTP/1.1 200 Purged
          Date: Thu, 24 Apr 2014 17:08:28 GMT
          X-Varnish: 1990228115
          Via: 1.1 Varnish

       The objects are now cleared.

   <b>INT</b> <b>purge(STRING</b> <b>keys)</b>
       <b>Description</b>
              Purges all objects hashed on any key found in the <b>keys</b> argument.  Returns the  number  of  objects
              that were purged.

              The <b>keys</b> may contain a list of space-separated ids.

   <b>INT</b> <b>softpurge(STRING</b> <b>keys)</b>
       <b>Description</b>
              Performs a "soft purge" for all objects hashed on any key found in the <b>keys</b> argument.  Returns the
              number of objects that were purged.

              A  softpurge differs from a regular purge in that it resets an object's TTL but keeps it available
              for grace mode and conditional requests for the remainder of its configured grace and keep time.

          Bytes used by all xkey_ochead objects

          Total bytes used by ochead objects. Increases when an object is added to a key or a key is added to an
          object. Decreases when the relationship is removed.
