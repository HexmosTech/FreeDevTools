       XkbKeyTypesForCoreSymbols  -  Determine the Xkb key types appropriate for the symbols bound to a key in a
       core keyboard mapping

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>int</b> <b>XkbKeyTypesForCoreSymbols</b> <b>(XkbDescPtr</b> <u>xkb</u><b>,</b> <b>int</b> <u>map_width</u><b>,</b> <b>KeySym</b> <b>*</b><u>core_syms</u><b>,</b> <b>unsigned</b> <b>int</b>  <u>protected</u><b>,</b>

</pre><h4><b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>xkb</u>    keyboard description in which to place symbols

       <u>map_width</u>
              width of core protocol keymap in xkb_syms_rtrn

       <u>core_syms</u>
              core protocol format array of KeySyms

       <u>protected</u>
              explicit key types

       <u>types_inout</u>
              backfilled with the canonical types bound to groups one and two for the key

       <u>xkb_syms_rtrn</u>
              backfilled with symbols bound to the key in the Xkb mapping

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>XkbKeyTypesForCoreSymbols</u>  expands  the  symbols  in  <u>core_syms</u>  and  types  in <u>types_inout,</u> then chooses
       canonical key types (canonical key types are defined The Canonical Key Types) for groups 1  and  2  using
       the rules specified by the Xkb protocol and places them in xkb_syms_rtrn, which will be non-NULL.

       <b>The</b> <b>Canonical</b> <b>Key</b> <b>Types</b>

       Xkb  allows up to XkbMaxKeyTypes (255) key types to be defined, but requires at least XkbNumRequiredTypes
       (4) predefined types to be in a key map. These predefined key types are referred to as the canonical  key
       types  and  describe the types of keys available on most keyboards. The definitions for the canonical key
       types are held in the first XkbNumRequiredTypes entries of the <u>types</u> field of  the  client  map  and  are
       indexed using the following constants:

           XkbOneLevelIndex
           XkbTwoLevelIndex
           XkbAlphabeticIndex
           XkbKeypadIndex

       ONE_LEVEL

       The  ONE_LEVEL key type describes groups that have only one symbol. The default ONE_LEVEL key type has no
       map entries and does not pay attention to any modifiers. A symbolic representation of this key type could
       look like the following:

           type "ONE_LEVEL" {
                modifiers = None;
                map[None]= Level1;
                level_name[Level1]= "Any";
           };

       The description of the ONE_LEVEL key type is stored in the types[XkbOneLevelIndex] entry  of  the  client
       key map.

       TWO_LEVEL

       The  TWO_LEVEL  key  type  describes  groups  that  consist of two symbols but are neither alphabetic nor
       numeric keypad keys. The default TWO_LEVEL type uses only the Shift modifier. It returns shift level  two
       if  Shift  is set, and level one if it is not. A symbolic representation of this key type could look like
       the following:

           type "TWO_LEVEL" {
               modifiers = Shift;
               map[Shift]= Level2;
               level_name[Level1]= "Base";
               level_name[Level2]= "Shift";
           };

       The description of the TWO_LEVEL key type is stored in the types[XkbTwoLevelIndex] entry  of  the  client
       key map.

       ALPHABETIC

       The  ALPHABETIC  key  type  describes  groups  consisting  of two symbols: the lowercase form of a symbol
       followed by the uppercase form of the same  symbol.   The  default  ALPHABETIC  type  implements  locale-
       sensitive "Shift cancels CapsLock" behavior using both the Shift and Lock modifiers as follows:

       •    If Shift and Lock are both set, the default ALPHABETIC type yields level one.

       •    If Shift alone is set, it yields level two.

       •    If  Lock  alone  is  set,  it  yields level one, but preserves the Lock modifier so Xlib notices and
            applies the appropriate capitalization rules. The Xlib  functions  are  locale-sensitive  and  apply
            different capitalization rules for different locales.

       •    If neither Shift nor Lock is set, it yields level one.

            A symbolic representation of this key type could look like the following:

                type "ALPHABETIC" {
                    modifiers = Shift+Lock;
                    map[Shift]= Level2;
                    preserve[Lock]= Lock;
                    level_name[Level1]= "Base";
                    level_name[Level2]= "Caps";
                };

            The  description  of the ALPHABETIC key type is stored in the types[XkbAlphabeticIndex] entry of the
            client key map.

            KEYPAD

            The KEYPAD key type describes groups that consist of two symbols, at least one of which is a numeric
            keypad symbol. The numeric keypad symbol is assumed to reside at level two. The default  KEYPAD  key
            type  implements  "Shift  cancels  NumLock"  behavior using the Shift modifier and the real modifier
            bound to the virtual modifier named "NumLock," known as the NumLock modifier, as follows:

       •    If Shift and NumLock are both set, the default KEYPAD type yields level one.

       •    If Shift alone is set, it yields level two.

       •    If NumLock alone is set, it yields level two.

       •    If neither Shift nor NumLock is set, it yields level one.

            A symbolic representation of this key type could look like the following:

                type "KEYPAD" {
                    modifiers = Shift+NumLock;
                    map[None]= Level1;
                    map[Shift]= Level2;
                    map[NumLock]= Level2;
                    map[Shift+NumLock]= Level1;
                    level_name[Level1]= "Base";
                    level_name[Level2]= "Caps";
                };

            The description of the KEYPAD key type is stored in the types[XkbKeypadIndex] entry  of  the  client
            key map.

            A core keymap is a two-dimensional array of keysyms. It has <u>map_width</u> columns and <u>max_key_code</u> rows.
            <u>XkbKeyTypesForCoreSymbols</u>  takes  a  single  row from a core keymap, determines the number of groups
            associated with it, the type of each group, and the symbols bound to each group.  The  return  value
            is the number of groups, <u>types_inout</u> has the types for each group, and <u>xkb_syms_rtrn</u> has the symbols
            in Xkb order (that is, groups are contiguous, regardless of size).

            <u>protected</u>  contains  the  explicitly  protected  key  types. There is one  explicit override control
            associated with each of the  four  possible  groups  for  each  Xkb  key,  ExplicitKeyType1  through
            ExplicitKeyType4;  <u>protected</u>  is  an  inclusive OR of these controls.  <u>map_width</u> is the width of the
            core keymap and is not dependent on any Xkb definitions.  <u>types_inout</u>  is  an  array  of  four  type
            indices.  On  input,  <u>types_inout</u>  contains the indices of any types already assigned to the key, in
            case they are explicitly protected from change.

            Upon return, <u>types_inout</u> contains any automatically selected (that is,  canonical)  types  plus  any
            protected  types.  Canonical types are assigned to all four groups if there are enough symbols to do
            so. The four entries in <u>types_inout</u> correspond to the four groups for the key in question.
