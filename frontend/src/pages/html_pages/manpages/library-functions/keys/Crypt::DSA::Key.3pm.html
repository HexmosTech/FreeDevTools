</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Crypt::DSA::Key - DSA key

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Crypt::DSA::Key;
           my $key = Crypt::DSA::Key-&gt;new;

           $key-&gt;p($p);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Crypt::DSA::Key</u> contains a DSA key, both the public and private portions. Subclasses of <u>Crypt::DSA::Key</u>
       implement <u>read</u> and <u>write</u> methods, such that you can store DSA keys on disk, and read them back into your
       application.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       Any of the key attributes can be accessed through combination get/set methods. The key attributes are: <u>p</u>,
       <u>q</u>, <u>g</u>, <u>priv_key</u>, and <u>pub_key</u>. For example:

           $key-&gt;p($p);
           my $p2 = $key-&gt;p;

   <b>$key</b> <b>=</b> <b>Crypt::DSA::Key-&gt;new(%arg)</b>
       Creates a new (empty) key object. All of the attributes are initialized to 0.

       Alternately, if you provide the <u>Filename</u> parameter (see below), the key will be read in from disk. If you
       provide the <u>Type</u> parameter (mandatory if <u>Filename</u> is provided), be aware that your key will actually be
       blessed into a subclass of <u>Crypt::DSA::Key</u>. Specifically, it will be the class implementing the specific
       read functionality for that type, eg. <u>Crypt::DSA::Key::PEM</u>.

       Returns the key on success, "undef" otherwise. (See <u>Password</u> for one reason why <u>new</u> might return
       "undef").

       <u>%arg</u> can contain:

       •   Type

           The  type  of  file  where the key is stored. Currently the only option is <u>PEM</u>, which indicates a PEM
           file (optionally encrypted, ASN.1-encoded object). Support for reading/writing PEM files  comes  from
           <u>Convert::PEM</u>; if you don't have this module installed, the <u>new</u> method will die.

           This  argument  is mandatory, <u>if</u> you're either reading the file from disk (ie. you provide a <u>Filename</u>
           argument) or you've specified the <u>Content</u> argument.

       •   Filename

           The location of the file from which you'd like to read the key.  Requires  a  <u>Type</u>  argument  so  the
           decoder knows what type of file it is.  You can't specify <u>Content</u> and <u>Filename</u> at the same time.

       •   Content

           The  serialized  version of the key.  Requires a <u>Type</u> argument so the decoder knows how to decode it.
           You can't specify <u>Content</u> and <u>Filename</u> at the same time.

       •   Password

           If your key file is encrypted, you'll need to supply a passphrase to decrypt  it.  You  can  do  that
           here.

           If your passphrase is incorrect, <u>new</u> will return "undef".

   <b>$key-&gt;write(%arg)</b>
       Writes a key (optionally) to disk, using a format that you define with the <u>Type</u> parameter.

       If  your  <u>$key</u>  object  has  a  defined  <u>priv_key</u> (private key portion), the key will be written as a DSA
       private key object; otherwise, it will be written out as a public key. Note that  not  all  serialization
       mechanisms can produce public keys in this version--currently, only PEM public keys are supported.

       <u>%arg</u> can include:

       •   Type

           The type of file format that you wish to write. <u>PEM</u> is one example (in fact, currently, it's the only
           example).

           This  argument  is  mandatory,  <u>unless</u>  your  <u>$key</u>  object  is  already  blessed into a subclass (eg.
           <u>Crypt::DSA::Key::PEM</u>), and you wish to write the file using the same subclass.

       •   Filename

           The location of the file on disk where you want the key file to be written.

       •   Password

           If you want the key file to be encrypted, provide this argument, and the ASN.1-encoded string will be
           encrypted using the passphrase as a key.

   <b>$key-&gt;size</b>
       Returns the size of the key, in bits. This is actually the number of bits in the large prime <u>p</u>.
