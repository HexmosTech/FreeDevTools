</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Net::SSH::AuthorizedKeysFile - Read and modify ssh's authorized_keys files

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Net::SSH::AuthorizedKeysFile;

               # Reads $HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys by default
           my $akf = Net::SSH::AuthorizedKeysFile-&gt;new();

           $akf-&gt;read("authorized_keys");

               # Iterate over entries
           for my $key ($akf-&gt;keys()) {
               print $key-&gt;as_string(), "\n";
           }

               # Modify entries:
           for my $key ($akf-&gt;keys()) {
               $key-&gt;option("from", '<a href="mailto:quack@quack.com">quack@quack.com</a>');
               $key-&gt;<a href="../man1025/keylen.1025.html">keylen</a>(1025);
           }
               # Save changes back to $HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys
           $akf-&gt;save() or die "Cannot save";

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Net::SSH::AuthorizedKeysFile reads and modifies "authorized_keys" files.  "authorized_keys" files contain
       public keys and meta information to be used by "ssh" on the remote host to let users in without having to
       type their password.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       "new"
           Creates a new Net::SSH::AuthorizedKeysFile object and reads in the authorized_keys file. The filename
           defaults to "$HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys" unless overridden with

               Net::SSH::AuthorizedKeysFile-&gt;new( file =&gt; "/path/other_authkeys_file" );

           Normally, the "read" method described below will just silently ignore faulty lines and only gobble up
           keys that either one of the two parsers accepts. If you want it to be stricter, set

               Net::SSH::AuthorizedKeysFile-&gt;new( file   =&gt; "authkeys_file",
                                                  abort_on_error =&gt; 1 );

           and read will immediately abort after the first faulty line. Also, the key parsers are fairly lenient
           in default mode. Adding

               strict =&gt; 1

           adds sanity checks before a key is accepted.

       "read"
           Reads  in  the  file defined by <b>new()</b>. By default, strict mode is off and <b>read()</b> will silently ignore
           faulty lines. If it's on (see <b>new()</b> above), <b>read()</b> will immediately  abort  after  the  first  faulty
           line. A textual description of the last error will be available via <b>error()</b>.

       "content"
           Contains the original file content, read by "read()" earlier. Can be used to set arbitrary content:

               $keysfile-&gt;content( "some\nrandom\nlines\n" );

           and have "parse()" operate on a string instead of an actual file this way.

       "keys"
           Returns a list of Net::SSH::AuthorizedKey objects. Methods are described in Net::SSH::AuthorizedKey.

       "as_string"
           String  representation  of  all  keys,  ultimately the content that gets written out when calling the
           "save()" method.  Note that comments from the original file are lost.

       "save"
           Write changes back to the authorized_keys file using the <b>as_string()</b>  method  described  above.  Note
           that  comments  from  the original file are lost.  Optionally takes a file name parameter, so calling
           "$akf-&gt;save("foo.txt")" will save the data in the file "foo.txt" instead of the  file  the  data  was
           read  from  originally.   Returns  1  if successful, and undef on error. In case of an error, <b>error()</b>
           contains a textual error description.

       "sanity_check"
           Run a sanity check on the currently selected authorized_keys  file.  If  it  contains  insanely  long
           lines,  then  parsing  with  <b>read()</b> (and potential crashes because of out-of-memory errors) should be
           avoided.

       "ssh_dir( [$user] )"
           Locate the .ssh dir of a given user. If no user name is given, ssh_dir will look up the .ssh  dir  of
           the effective user. Typically returns something like "/home/gonzo/.ssh".

       "path_locate( [$user] )"
           Locate   the   authorized_keys   file   of   a   given   user.   Typically   returns  something  like
           "/home/gonzo/.ssh/authorized_keys". See "ssh_dir()" for how the containing directory is located  with
           and without a given user name.

       "error"
           Description of last error that occurred.
