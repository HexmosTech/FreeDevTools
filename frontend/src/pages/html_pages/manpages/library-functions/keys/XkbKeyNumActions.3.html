       XkbKeyNumActions - Computes the number of actions associated with the key corresponding to keycode

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>int</b> <b>XkbKeyNumActions</b> <b>(XkbDescPtr</b> <u>xkb</u><b>,</b> <b>KeyCode</b> <u>keycode</u><b>);</b>

</pre><h4><b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>xkb</u>    Xkb description of interest

       <u>keycode</u>
              keycode of interest

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       A  key  action  defines the effect key presses and releases have on the internal state of the server. For
       example, the expected key action associated with pressing the Shift key is to  set  the  Shift  modifier.
       There is zero or one key action associated with each keysym bound to each key.

       Just  as  the entire list of key symbols for the keyboard mapping is held in the <u>syms</u> field of the client
       map, the entire list of key actions for the keyboard mapping is held in the <u>acts</u> array of the server map.
       The total size of <u>acts</u> is specified by <u>size_acts,</u> and the number of entries is specified by <u>num_acts.</u>

       The <u>key_acts</u> array, indexed by keycode, describes the actions associated with a key. The  <u>key_acts</u>  array
       has  <u>min_key_code</u>  unused  entries  at  the start to allow direct indexing using a keycode. If a <u>key_acts</u>
       entry is zero, it means the key does not have any actions associated with it. If an entry  is  not  zero,
       the  entry  represents  an  index  into  the  <u>acts</u> field of the server map, much as the <u>offset</u> field of a
       KeySymMapRec structure is an index into the <u>syms</u> field of the client map.

       The reason the <u>acts</u> field is a linear list of XkbActions is to reduce the memory  consumption  associated
       with a keymap. Because Xkb allows individual keys to have multiple shift levels and a different number of
       groups  per  key,  a  single two-dimensional array of KeySyms would potentially be very large and sparse.
       Instead, Xkb provides a small two-dimensional array of XkbActions for each key. To  store  all  of  these
       individual arrays, Xkb concatenates each array together in the <u>acts</u> field of the server map.

       The  key action structures consist only of fields of type char or unsigned char. This is done to optimize
       data transfer when the server sends bytes over the wire. If the fields are anything but bytes, the server
       has to sift through all of the actions and swap any nonbyte fields. Because they consist of  nothing  but
       bytes, it can just copy them out.

       <u>XkbKeyNumActions</u>  computes  the number of actions associated with the key corresponding to <u>keycode.</u>  This
       should be the same value as the result of <u>XkbKeyNumSyms.</u>

</pre><h4><b>STRUCTURES</b></h4><pre>
       The KeySymMapRec structure is defined as follows:

           #define XkbNumKbdGroups             4
           #define XkbMaxKbdGroup              (XkbNumKbdGroups-1)

           typedef struct {                    /* map to keysyms for a single keycode */
               unsigned char       kt_index[XkbNumKbdGroups];  /* key type index for each group */
               unsigned char       group_info; /* # of groups and out of range group handling */
               unsigned char       width;      /* max # of shift levels for key */
               unsigned short      offset;     /* index to keysym table in syms array */
       } XkbSymMapRec, *XkbSymMapPtr;
