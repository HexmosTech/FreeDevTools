</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Finance::QIF is a module for working with QIF (Quicken Interchange Format) files in Perl.  This module
       reads QIF data records from a file passing each successive record to the caller for processing.  This
       module also has the capability of writing QIF records to a file.

       The QIF file format typically consists of a header containing a record or transaction type, followed by
       associated data records.  Within a file there may be multiple headers.  Headers are usually followed by
       data records, however data is not required to always follow a header.

       A hash reference is returned for each record read from a file.  The hash will have a "header" value which
       contains the header type that was read along with all supported values found for that record.  If a value
       is not specified in the data file, the value will not exist in this hash.

       No processing or validation is done on values found in files or data structures to try and convert them
       into appropriate types and formats.  It is expected that users of this module or extensions to this
       module will do any additional processing or validation as required.

   <b>RECORD</b> <b>TYPES</b> <b>&amp;</b> <b>VALUES</b>
       The following record types are currently supported by this module:

       Type:Bank, Type:Cash, Type:CCard, Type:Oth A, Type:Oth L

           These  record  types  aren't related to transactions but instead provided ways to control how Quicken
           processes the QIF file.  They have no impact on how this  software  operates  and  are  ignored  when
           found.

       Note:  If  this  software  finds  unsupported  record  types  or  values in a data file a warning will be
       generated containing information on what unexpected value was found.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>new()</b>
       Creates a new instance of Finance::QIF.  Supports the following initializing values.

         my $qif = Finance::QIF-&gt;new( file =&gt; "myfile", debug =&gt; 1 );

       If the file is specified it will be opened on new.

       file
           Specifies file to use for processing.  See "<b>file()</b>" for details.

             my $in = Finance::QIF-&gt;new( file =&gt; "myfile" );
           OR
             my $in = Finance::QIF-&gt;new( file =&gt; [ "myfile", "&lt;:crlf" ] );

           For output files, be sure to open the file in write mode.  For example:

             my $out = Finance::QIF-&gt;new( file =&gt; "&gt;myfile" );

       record_separator
           Can be used to redefine the QIF record separator.  Default is $<a href="file:/.">/.</a>

             my $in = Finance::QIF-&gt;new( record_separator =&gt; "\012" );

           Note: For MacOS X it will most likely be necessary to change this to  "\015".   Quicken  on  MacOS  X
           generates files with "\015" as the separator which is typical of Mac however the native perl in MacOS
           X  is  unix  based and uses the default unix separator which is "\012".  See "autodetect" for another
           option.

       autodetect
           Enable auto detection of the record separator based on the file contents.  Default is "0".

             my $in = Finance::QIF-&gt;new( autodetect =&gt; 1 );

           Perl uses $/ to define line separators for text files.  Perl sets this value according to the OS perl
           is running on:

             Windows="\015\012"
             Mac="\015"
             Unix="\012"

           In many cases you may find yourself with text files that  do  not  match  the  OS.   In  these  cases
           Finance::QIF  by default will not process that QIF file correctly. This feature is an attempt to help
           with the most common cases of having the wrong text file for the OS Finance::QIF is running on.

           This feature depends on being able to seek to the end of the file and reading the last  2  characters
           to  determine the proper separator. If a seek can not be performed or the last 2 characters are not a
           proper separator the record_separator will default  to  $/  or  the  value  passed  in.  If  a  valid
           record_separator is found then it will be set according to what was in the file.

           This code requires a file use a consistent line separator. If you find your self dealing with unusual
           files containing mixed separators you need to first Normalize the file to a consistent separator.

           Normalizing   a   text   file   to  have  a  consistent  line  separator  is  done  in  modules  like
           File::LocalizeNewlines or Template::Parser::LocalizeNewlines so if you are having issues with  trying
           to  process  poorly  formated  text files look at preprocessing them with something like those before
           passing on to Finance::QIF.

       trim_white_space
           Can be used to remove leading and trailing white space from values returned. Default is "0".

             my $qif = Finance::QIF-&gt;new( trim_white_space =&gt; 1 );

       debug
           Can be used to output debug information.  Default is "0".

             my $qif = Finance::QIF-&gt;new( debug =&gt; 1 );

   <b>file()</b>
       Specify file name and optionally additional parameters that will be used to  obtain  a  filehandle.   The
       argument can be a filename (SCALAR), an ARRAY reference, or an ARRAY whose values must be valid arguments
       for passing to IO::File-&gt;new.

         $qif-&gt;file( "myfile" );
        OR
         $qif-&gt;file( [ "myfile", "&lt;:crlf" ] );
        OR
         $qif-&gt;file( "myfile", "&lt;:crlf" );

       For output files, be sure to open the file in write mode.

   <b>record_separator()</b>
       Returns  the  currently  used record_separator.  This is used primarly in situations where you open a QIF
       file with autodetect and then want to write out a QIF file in the same format.

         my $in  = Finance::QIF-&gt;new( file =&gt; "input.qif", autodetect =&gt; 1 );
         my $out = Finance::QIF-&gt;new( file =&gt; "&gt;write.qif",
                                      record_separator =&gt; $in-&gt;record_separator );

   <b>open()</b>
       Open already specified file.

         $qif-&gt;open();

       Open also supports the same arguments as "<b>file()</b>".

   <b>next()</b>
       For input files return the next record in the QIF file.

         my $record = $in-&gt;next();

       Returns undef if no more records are available.

   <b>header()</b>
       For output files use to output the passed header for records that will then be written with write.

         $out-&gt;header( "Type:Bank" );
