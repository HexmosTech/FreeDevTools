</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  chapter  of  the  tutorial  takes a brief look at the primary options available for troubleshooting
       Catalyst applications.

       Source code for the tutorial in included in the <u>/home/catalyst/Final</u> directory of  the  Tutorial  Virtual
       machine  (one  subdirectory  per  chapter).   There  are  also  instructions  for downloading the code in
       Catalyst::Manual::Tutorial::01_Intro.

       Note that when it comes to debugging and troubleshooting, there are two camps:

       •   Fans of "log" and "print" statements embedded in the code.

       •   Fans of interactive debuggers.

       Catalyst is able to easily accommodate both styles of debugging.

</pre><h4><b>LOG</b> <b>STATEMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Folks in the former group can use Catalyst's "$c-&gt;log" facility.  (See Catalyst::Log  for  more  detail.)
       For example, if you add the following code to a controller action method:

           $c-&gt;log-&gt;info("Starting the foreach loop here");

           $c-&gt;log-&gt;debug("Value of \$id is: ".$id);

       Then  the  Catalyst  development  server  will display your message along with the other debug output. To
       accomplish the same thing in a TT template view use:

           [% c.log.debug("This is a test log message") %]

       As with many other logging facilities, a method is defined for each of the following "logging levels" (in
       increasing order of severity/importance):

           $c-&gt;log-&gt;debug
           $c-&gt;log-&gt;info
           $c-&gt;log-&gt;warn
           $c-&gt;log-&gt;error
           $c-&gt;log-&gt;fatal

       You can also use Data::Dumper in both Catalyst code and in TT templates.  For use in Catalyst code:

        use Data::Dumper;
        $c-&gt;log-&gt;debug("\$var is: ".Dumper($c-&gt;stash-&gt;{something}));

       and TT templates:

        [% USE Dumper ; Dumper.dump(c.stash.something) %].

       <b>NOTE:</b> Whether you are a logging fanatic or  not,  we  strongly  recommend  that  you  take  advantage  of
       Log::Log4perl  or  Log::Dispatch.   It's  easy  to  use  Catalyst::Log with either of these and they will
       provide a huge amount of extra functionality that you will want in virtually every production application
       you run or support.

</pre><h4><b>RUNNING</b> <b>CATALYST</b> <b>UNDER</b> <b>THE</b> <b>PERL</b> <b>DEBUGGER</b></h4><pre>
       Members of the interactive-debugger fan club will also  be  at  home  with  Catalyst  applications.   One
       approach  to  this  style  of  Perl  debugging  is  to embed breakpoints in your code.  For example, open
       "lib/MyApp/Controller/Books.pm" in your editor and add the "DB::single=1"  line  as  follows  inside  the
       "list" method (I like to "left-justify" my debug statements so I don't forget to remove them, but you can
       obviously indent them if you prefer):

           sub list :Local {
               # Retrieve the usual Perl OO '$self' for this object. $c is the Catalyst
               # 'Context' that's used to 'glue together' the various components
               # that make up the application
               my ($self, $c) = @_;

           $DB::single=1;

               # Retrieve all of the book records as book model objects and store in the
               # stash where they can be accessed by the TT template
               $c-&gt;stash-&gt;{books} = [$c-&gt;model('DB::Book')-&gt;all];

               # Set the TT template to use.  You will almost always want to do this
               # in your action methods.
               $c-&gt;stash-&gt;{template} = 'books/list.tt2';
           }

       This  causes  the  Perl  Debugger to enter "single step mode" when this command is encountered (it has no
       effect when Perl is run without the "-d" flag).

       <b>NOTE:</b> The "DB" here is the Perl Debugger, not the DB model.

       If you haven't done it already, enable SQL logging as before:

           $ export DBIC_TRACE=1

       To now run the Catalyst development server under the Perl debugger, simply prepend "perl -d" to the front
       of "script/myapp_server.pl":

           $ perl -d script/myapp_server.pl

       This will start the interactive debugger and produce output similar to:

           $ perl -d script/myapp_server.pl

           Loading DB routines from perl5db.pl version 1.3
           Editor support available.

           Enter h or `h h' for help, or `man perldebug' for more help.

           main::(script/myapp_server.pl:16):      my $debug         = 0;

             DB&lt;1&gt;

       Press the "c" key and hit "Enter" to  continue  executing  the  Catalyst  development  server  under  the
       debugger.   Although  execution  speed will be slightly slower than normal, you should soon see the usual
       Catalyst startup debug information.

       Now point your browser  to  &lt;<a href="http://localhost">http://localhost</a>:3000/books/list&gt;  and  log  in.   Once  the  breakpoint  is
       encountered  in  the "MyApp::Controller::list" method, the console session running the development server
       will drop to the Perl debugger prompt:

           MyApp::Controller::Books::list(/home/catalyst/MyApp/script/../lib/MyApp/Controller/Books.pm:48):
           48:         $c-&gt;stash-&gt;{books} = [$c-&gt;model('DB::Book')-&gt;all];

             DB&lt;1&gt;

       You now have the full Perl debugger at your disposal.  First use the "next"  feature  by  typing  "n"  to
       execute  the "all" method on the Book model ("n" jumps over method/subroutine calls; you can also use "s"
       to "single-step" into methods/subroutines):

             DB&lt;1&gt; n
           SELECT me.id, me.title, me.rating, me.created, me.updated FROM book me:
           MyApp::Controller::Books::list(/home/catalyst/MyApp/script/../lib/MyApp/Controller/Books.pm:53):
           53:         $c-&gt;stash-&gt;{template} = 'books/list.tt2';

             DB&lt;1&gt;

       This takes you to the next line of code where the template name is set.  Notice that because  we  enabled
       "DBIC_TRACE=1" earlier, SQL debug output also shows up in the development server debug information.

       Next, list the methods available on our "Book" model:

             DB&lt;1&gt; m $c-&gt;model('DB::Book')
           ()
           (0+
           (bool
           __result_class_accessor
           __source_handle_accessor
           _add_alias
           __bool
           _build_unique_query
           _calculate_score
           _collapse_cond
           &lt;lines removed for brevity&gt;

             DB&lt;2&gt;

       We can also play with the model directly:

             DB&lt;2&gt; x ($c-&gt;model('DB::Book')-&gt;all)[1]-&gt;title
           SELECT me.id, me.title, me.rating, me.created, me.updated FROM book me:
           0  'TCP/IP Illustrated, Volume 1'

       This uses the Perl debugger "x" command to display the title of a book.

       Next we inspect the "books" element of the Catalyst "stash" (the 4 argument to the "x" command limits the
       depth of the dump to 4 levels):

             DB&lt;3&gt; x 4 $c-&gt;stash-&gt;{books}
           0  <a href="../man0xa8f3b7c/ARRAY.0xa8f3b7c.html">ARRAY</a>(0xa8f3b7c)
              0  MyApp::Model::DB::Book=<a href="../man0xb8e702c/HASH.0xb8e702c.html">HASH</a>(0xb8e702c)
                 '_column_data' =&gt; <a href="../man0xb8e5e2c/HASH.0xb8e5e2c.html">HASH</a>(0xb8e5e2c)
                    'created' =&gt; '2009-05-08 10:19:46'
                    'id' =&gt; 1
                    'rating' =&gt; 5
                    'title' =&gt; 'CCSP SNRS Exam Certification Guide'
                    'updated' =&gt; '2009-05-08 10:19:46'
                 '_in_storage' =&gt; 1
           &lt;lines removed for brevity&gt;

       Then  enter  the  "c" command to continue processing until the next breakpoint is hit (or the application
       exits):

             DB&lt;4&gt; c
           SELECT author.id, author.first_name, author.last_name FROM ...

       Finally, press "Ctrl+C" to break out of the development server.  Because we are running inside  the  Perl
       debugger, you will drop to the debugger prompt.

           ^CCatalyst::Engine::HTTP::run(/usr/local/share/perl/5.10.0/Catalyst/Engine/HTTP.pm:260):
           260:            while ( accept( Remote, $daemon ) ) {

           DB&lt;4&gt;

       Finally, press "q" to exit the debugger and return to your OS shell prompt:

             DB&lt;4&gt; q
           $

       For  more  information  on  using  the Perl debugger, please see "perldebug" and "perldebtut".  For those
       daring souls out there, you can dive down even deeper into the magical depths of this  fine  debugger  by
       checking out "perldebguts".

       You can also type "h" or "h h" at the debugger prompt to view the built-in help screens.

       For  an  excellent  book covering all aspects of the Perl debugger, we highly recommend reading 'Pro Perl
       Debugging' by Richard Foley.

       Oh  yeah,  before  you  forget,  be  sure  to  remove  the  "DB::single=1"  line  you  added   above   in
       "lib/MyApp/Controller/Books.pm".

</pre><h4><b>DEBUGGING</b> <b>MODULES</b> <b>FROM</b> <b>CPAN</b></h4><pre>
       Although  the  techniques  discussed  above  work  well for code you are writing, what if you want to use
       print/log/warn messages or set breakpoints in code that you have installed from CPAN (or in  module  that
       ship  with  Perl)?   One  helpful approach is to place a copy of the module inside the "lib" directory of
       your Catalyst project.  When Catalyst loads, it will load from inside your "lib"  directory  first,  only
       turning  to  the global modules if a local copy cannot be found.  You can then make modifications such as
       adding a "$DB::single=1" to the local copy of the  module  without  risking  the  copy  in  the  original
       location.  This can also be a great way to "locally override" bugs in modules while you wait for a fix on
       CPAN.

       Matt Trout has suggested the following shortcut to create a local copy of an installed module:

           mkdir -p lib/Module; cp `perldoc -l Module::Name` lib/Module/

       Note:  If  you are following along in Debian 6 or Ubuntu, you will need to install the "perl-doc" package
       to use the "perldoc" command.  Use "sudo aptitude install perl-doc" to do that.

       For example, you could make a copy of Catalyst::Plugin::Authentication with the following command:

           mkdir -p lib/Catalyst/Plugin; cp \
               `perldoc -l Catalyst::Plugin::Authentication` lib/Catalyst/Plugin

       You can then use the local copy inside your project to place  logging  messages  and/or  breakpoints  for
       further study of that module.

       <b>Note:</b> Matt has also suggested the following tips for Perl debugging:

       •   Check the version of an installed module:

               perl -M&lt;mod_name&gt; -e 'print "$&lt;mod_name&gt;::VERSION\n"'

           For example:

               $ perl -MCatalyst::Plugin::Authentication -e \
                   'print $Catalyst::Plugin::Authentication::VERSION;'
               0.07

           and if you are using bash aliases:

               alias pmver="perl -le '\$m = shift; eval qq(require \$m) \
                   or die qq(module \"\$m\" is not installed\\n); \
                   print \$m-&gt;VERSION'"

       •   Check if a modules contains a given method:

               perl -MModule::Name -e 'print Module::Name-&gt;can("method");'

           For example:

               $ perl -MCatalyst::Plugin::Authentication -e \
                   'print Catalyst::Plugin::Authentication-&gt;can("user");'
               <a href="../man0x9c8db2c/CODE.0x9c8db2c.html">CODE</a>(0x9c8db2c)

           If  the  method  exists,  the  Perl  "can" method returns a coderef.  Otherwise, it returns undef and
           nothing will be printed.

</pre><h4><b>TT</b> <b>DEBUGGING</b></h4><pre>
       If you run into issues during the rendering of your template, it might be helpful to  enable  TT  "DEBUG"
       options.  You can do this in a Catalyst environment by adding a "DEBUG" line to the "__PACKAGE__-"config&gt;
       declaration in "lib/MyApp/View/HTML.pm":

           __PACKAGE__-&gt;config({
               TEMPLATE_EXTENSION =&gt; '.tt2',
               DEBUG              =&gt; 'undef',
           });

       There  are  a  variety of options you can use, such as 'undef', 'all', 'service', 'context', 'parser' and
       'provider'.  See Template::Constants for more information (remove the "DEBUG_" portion of the name  shown
       in the TT docs and convert to lower case for use inside Catalyst).

       <b>NOTE:</b>  <b>Please</b>  <b>be</b>  <b>sure</b>  <b>to</b>  <b>disable</b> <b>TT</b> <b>debug</b> <b>options</b> <b>before</b> <b>continuing</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>tutorial</b> (especially the
       'undef' option -- leaving this enabled will conflict  with  several  of  the  conventions  used  by  this
       tutorial to leave some variables undefined on purpose).

       Happy debugging.
