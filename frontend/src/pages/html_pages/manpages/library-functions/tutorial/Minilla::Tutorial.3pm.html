       Minilla::Tutorial - Tutorial document for Minilla

</pre><h4><b>The</b> <b>Minilla</b> <b>workflow</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Installing</b>
           &gt; cpanm --with-recommends Minilla

       You can install Minilla from CPAN.

       Unlike dzil, you don't need to do any setup. Minilla aggregates user name and e-mail address from your
       "<a href="file:~/.gitconfig">~/.gitconfig</a>" (You already set, isn't it?)

   <b>Making</b> <b>new</b> <b>distribution</b>
       Now it's time to make a new distribution.

           &gt; minil new Dist-Name
           &gt; cd Dist-Name/

       At this point, you will have a really simple Dist-Name directory that contains your module file with as
       minimum boilerplate as possible.

       minil done "git init" and "git add .". You need to commit it ASAP.

           &gt; git commit -m 'initial import'

       Now start writing your code, edit the docs, tests and manage CPAN dependencies with cpanfile.

           &gt; $EDITOR lib/Dist/Name.pm t/dist-name.t cpanfile

   <b>Making</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>release</b>
       When you get confident and it's about time to ship to CPAN, use the test and release command. Before
       doing so, make sure your git directory is not dirty i.e. all changes are committed.

           &gt; git commit -a -m "Done initial version"

       Minilla assumes you have a git remote setup so that you can push all your changes to. I recommend you to
       use either hub gem or App::ph to create a new github repository.

           # Use hub rubygem
           &gt; hub create

           # Use App::ph
           &gt; ph import

       Alternatively, if you prefer to use GitLab you can create a project in their web interface and follow the
       instructions it provides to <u>Push</u> <u>an</u> <u>existing</u> <u>Git</u> <u>repository</u>.

       Now, make sure you have Changes file ready and have a new entry under "{{$NEXT}}", which will be expanded
       to the next version of your module.

           &gt; $EDITOR Changes
           &gt; minil test

       Before you proceed to release step, please ensure the "<a href="file:~/.pause">~/.pause</a>" file is configured correctly because
       Minilla uses CPAN::Uploader to upload your distribution to CPAN.  You can specify the location of PAUSE
       configuration file on <u>minil.toml</u> if you want to.  See "CONFIGURATION" in Minilla for further information.

           &gt; minil release

       And your first release is done. The release is tagged on git and all the changes automatically made are
       committed to git as well.

       If this is your first conversion to Minilla and want to make sure you're not going to mess CPAN with a
       bad archive when something goes wrong, you can run the release command with FAKE_RELEASE environment
       variable. This will run all the other release process, except the UploadToCPAN step.

           &gt; FAKE_RELEASE=1 minil release

       Wait for PAUSE processing it and your module showing up on MetaCPAN in a few minutes. Congratulations!

   <b>Making</b> <b>a</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>release</b>
       You have new features, bugs, pull requests and get ready to make a next version of your module. Great,
       making a new release is equally easy.

       First, make sure all your code has been committed to git and there's no dirty files in the working
       directory.

       Then make sure to edit Changes file and contain entries for the next release under "{{$NEXT}}". You don't
       need to commit the change to the <u>Changes</u> file, yet.

       Now, make a release!

           &gt; minil test
           &gt; minil release

       The release command will automatically bump the version for you - if you have 0.10, the next version will
       be 0.11 by default, but you will be prompted to confirm that version in case you need a major bump.

       You can annotate any lines for which you would like the automatic version bump to be skipped by
       appending, `# No BumpVersion`.

       This will update "Changes", "META.json" and bump $VERSION in your main module. These changes made by
       Minilla will be automatically committed, tagged and pushed to the remote.

</pre><h4><b>MIGRATING</b></h4><pre>
       This section describes how to migrate your current authoring process to Minilla.

   <b>Migrate</b> <b>by</b> <b>"minil</b> <b>migrate"</b>
       You just type "minil migrate".

       It can migrate your distribution automatically. If you can't do it, please report to Github issues
       &lt;https://github.com/tokuhirom/Minilla/issues&gt;.

   <b>Manually</b> <b>migrating</b> <b>from</b> <b>other</b> <b>build</b> <b>tools</b>
       <u>Module</u> <u>Dependencies</u> <u>to</u> <u>cpanfile</u>

       First, move the prereq declaration from Makefile.PL or Build.PL to cpanfile.

       The easiest way to convert existing dependencies to cpanfile is to use the command line tool mymeta-
       cpanfile, which is installed with Module::CPANfile. Run the configuration with Makefile.PL for the one
       last time, then run the mymeta-cpanfile command:

           &gt; perl Makefile.PL
           &gt; mymeta-cpanfile --no-configure
           requires 'DBI', '1.000';

           on test =&gt; sub {
               requires 'Test::More', '0.86';
           }

           ...

       You can redirect the output to cpanfile if you like. It is important to pass --no-configure option here,
       since otherwise modules like ExtUtils::MakeMaker will be included. It is not required with Minilla setup,
       since Minilla knows which configuration tool (installer) to use and include them in META files upon the
       releases. You can leave that out from the cpanfile.

       If you decide to manually construct new cpanfile, the format is mostly compatible to Module::Install's
       requirement DSL.

           # Makefile.PL
           test_requires 'Test::More', 0.90;
           requires 'Plack', '1.000';

       becomes:

           # cpanfile
           test_requires 'Test::More', 0.90;
           requires 'Plack', '1.000';

       which is exactly the same. If you use Module::Build or ExtUtils::MakeMaker, that will be more manual
       process, but basically the same thing. See cpanfile for the available syntax.

       <u>Remove</u> <u>boilerplate</u>

       Next, remove unnecessary boilerplate files.

           &gt; git rm {Makefile,Build}.PL MANIFEST MANIFEST.SKIP README .shipit

       <u>Edit</u> <u>configurations</u>

       Edit .gitignore and add the following lines:

           /Dist-Name-*
           /.build
           !META.json

       You're almost done, and your directory will look like:

           cpanfile
           lib/Dist/Name.pm
           t/...

       "git add" the newly created files and commit it.

       <u>Make</u> <u>a</u> <u>new</u> <u>build</u>

       Now you're ready to make the first build.

           &gt; minil build

       and if it was successful, you get a build in a directory called "Dist-Name-v0.1.0" under your current
       directory. They can be later removed with "minil clean" command.

       Also, new "Build.PL", "META.json" and "README.md" are added in your working directory for git-
       friendliness. "git add" them and commit it.

          &gt; git add Build.PL META.json README.md &amp;&amp; git commit -m "git stuff"

       Now you're ready to roll a new release with Minilla. Before doing so, convert your "Changes" file format
       a little bit, and make sure you have a following header in the top:

         {{$NEXT}}

           - Change log entry for the next version

       The "{{$NEXT}}" is a template variable that gets replaced with the version and date string, when you make
       a next release. This is almost the <u>only</u> change you're required to make in your code base.

       Now, run the release command:

           &gt; minil release

       to make a new release, in the same way described above for a new Minilla setup. You can set
       "FAKE_RELEASE" environment variable if this is your first conversion and want to double check what
       happens, before uploading to CPAN.

       When this is not your first release, the version number gets automatically bumped by Minilla, but you
       will be prompted if that is exactly the version you want, and if you want a major version up, you can
       specify to do so.
