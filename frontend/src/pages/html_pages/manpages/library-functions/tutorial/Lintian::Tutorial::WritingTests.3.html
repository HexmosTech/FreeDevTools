       Lintian::Tutorial::WritingTests -- Short tutorial on writing tests

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       Warning: This document may be out of date.

       This document attempts to be a short / quick tutorial to the Lintian test suite from a test-writer's
       perspective.  As such, it will only cover the standard type of tests (from the "tests" suite).

       The guide will involve writing a test for the "deb/pkg-check" check, which was documented in the
       Lintian::Tutorial::WritingChecks tutorial.

       For running tests, please see Lintian::Tutorial::TestSuite instead.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The Lintian test suite is divided into several parts.  These are:

       -   scripts

           Small  (Perl)  "prove"  tests.   These  assert that code style, data files and/or self-contained code
           units (i.e. unit tests) work as intended.  They are <b>not</b> used for testing Lintian tags.

       -   tags

           These tests all test for the presence of tags after building test packages using skeletons. For  most
           cases, we recommend

            Skeleton: upload-non-native

           suites  are  small  test  suites  that  test  some  particular tags for <u>.changes</u>, <u>.deb</u> or <u>.dsc</u> files.
           Typically, you will find the more exotic tags here, which require some special fiddling and cannot be
           built by a "standard" dh7 + dpkg build.

       -   literal

           These tests look to match the literal output of Lintian. These tests  are  useful  as  general  false
           positives. They also catch Lintian messages unrelated to tags.

       With this in mind, let us move on to the scope.

   <b>Scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tutorial</b>
       WARNING: THE REMAINDER OF THIS TUTORIAL IS OUT OF DATE.

       The  "tests"  suite  alone  is fairly complex on its own.  To keep things simple, the tutorial will limit
       itself to creating a "native" package with no special requirements in the "tests" suite.

       In particular, note that the tags <u>must</u> <u>not</u> be <u>pedantic</u> for this to  work.   If  you  followed  the  check
       writing tutorial and made the tags pedantic, please change them into "I", "W" or "E" tags.

       Once  the basics are covered, you should be better equipped to deal with the other ("tag testing") suites
       or using other features of the "tests" suite (e.g. pedantic tags).

   <b>The</b> <b>design</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lintian</b> <b>test</b> <b>suite</b>
       The basic design of the Lintian test suite can be summed up as <u>less</u> <u>is</u> <u>more</u>.  The Debian build system  is
       changing all the time (albeit, slowly) and sometimes it deprecates or breaks existing features.

       With over 400 tests all featuring the same basic parts, the test suite features several tricks to keep up
       with  the  pace.   It uses "skeletons" (template) directories to seed the package structures and template
       files to fill in the basic files (e.g. "debian/control" and "debian/changelog").

       This means that when a new standards-version comes along, debhelper deprecates a feature or (more likely)
       Lintian adds a new tag, the majority of the tests can quickly be adapted with only a minor effort.

       Since pedantic tags tend to require additional effort to avoid,  most  Lintian  tests  do  <b>not</b>  run  with
       pedantic tags enabled.

   <b>The</b> <b>basics</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>"native"</b> <b>package</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>"tests"</b> <b>suite</b>
       For starters, you need 2 files and 1 directory, which will be placed in <u>t/tests/&lt;test-name&gt;</u>.

       <u>The</u> <u>desc</u> <u>file</u> <u>(mandatory)</u>

       This  is  the  test  description  file.   It is a deb822 file (i.e. same syntax as <u>debian/control</u>), which
       contains a number of fields.

       Let's start with the following template:

        Testname: pkg-deb-check-general
        Version: 1.0
        Description: General test of the pkg/deb-check check
        Test-For:
         missing-multi-arch-field
         missing-pre-depends-on-multiarch-support

       This defines the name of the test, its sequence number (i.e. how early it should be run), the version  of
       the <u>generated</u> package, a description and the tags you intend to test for.

       In case you were wondering why "invalid-multi-arch-field" is not listed, then it is because dpkg will not
       allow  us  to use an invalid Multi-Arch value.  Therefore, that particular tag would have to be tested in
       the "debs" suite instead.

       Note that the value of the Testname field (as Source field), Version field and Description field (as  the
       synopsis)  <u>will</u>  be  used  in  the  package.   As  such, they must obey the normal requirements for these
       purposes.

       Please keep the following conventions in mind:

       -   The Testname should be "&lt;check-name&gt;-&lt;test-name&gt;"

           Note that regular Lintian checks do <u>not</u> have a "/", so the naming convention  works  slightly  better
           there.

       -   The Version should always be "1.0" unless the test requires anything else.

           For non-native packages, the default would be "1.0-1".

       <u>The</u> <u>"tags"</u> <u>file</u> <u>(mandatory,</u> <u>but</u> <u>may</u> <u>be</u> <u>empty)</u>

       This  file  contains the <u>sorted</u> "expected" output of lintian.  Assuming all of the tags are "I" tags, the
       file should look something like:

        I: pkg-deb-check-general-missing-ma: missing-multi-arch-field
        I: pkg-deb-check-general-missing-pred: missing-pre-depends-on-multiarch-support

       <u>The</u> <u>"debian/"</u> <u>directory</u> <u>(optional,</u> <u>but</u> <u>usually</u> <u>needed)</u>

       The unpacked debian package in its full glory.  Note that this means that the  (e.g.)  <u>debian/rules</u>  file
       would be <u>t/tests/&lt;test-name&gt;/debian/debian/rules</u>  (note the double "debian/").

       The directory is seeded from <u>t/templates/tests/&lt;skeleton&gt;/</u>, where <u>skeleton</u> is the value of the "Skeleton"
       field from the "desc" file.

       For this test, you only need a specialized control file.  This file could look something like:

        Source: {$source}
        Priority: extra
        Section: {$section}
        Maintainer: {$author}
        Standards-Version: {$standards_version}
        Build-Depends: {$build_depends}

        Package: {$source}-missing-ma
        Architecture: {$architecture}
        Depends: $\{shlibs:Depends\}, $\{misc:Depends\}
        Description: {$description} (invalid)
         This is a test package designed to exercise some feature or tag of
         Lintian.  It is part of the Lintian test suite and may do very odd
         things.  It should not be installed like a regular package.  It may
         be an empty package.
         .
         Missing M-A field.

        Package: {$source}-missing-pred
        Architecture: any
        Depends: $\{shlibs:Depends\}, $\{misc:Depends\}
        Multi-arch: same
        Description: {$description} (pre-depends)
         This is a test package designed to exercise some feature or tag of
         Lintian.  It is part of the Lintian test suite and may do very odd
         things.  It should not be installed like a regular package.  It may
         be an empty package.
         .
         Missing Pre-Depends.

       <u>Running</u> <u>the</u> <u>test</u>

       At this point, the test is in fact ready to be executed.  It can be run by using:

        $ debian/rules runtests onlyrun=pkg-deb-check-general

        OR

        $ private/runtests --dump-logs t debian/test-out pkg-deb-check-general

       However,  it  will  not  emit  the  correct  tags unless pkg/deb-check is part of the debian/main lintian
       profile.  If your check is a part of a different profile, add the "Profile: &lt;name&gt;" field to  the  "desc"
       file.

       With  this,  the  tutorial  is  over.  Below you will find some more resources that may be useful to your
       future test writing work.

   <b>A</b> <b>step-by-step</b> <b>guide</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>a</b> <b>test</b> <b>case</b> <b>works</b>
       Basically, the tag-testing test cases all involve building a package and running lintian on  the  result.
       The  "tests"  suite does a full build with dpkg-buildpackage, the other suites "hand-craft" only the type
       of artifacts they are named after (e.g. "source" produces only source packages).

       <u>A</u> <u>test</u> <u>in</u> <u>the</u> <u>"tests"</u> <u>suite</u>

       The basic process of a lintian test in the "tests" suite.

       1.  Copy the "upstream" skeleton dir into the build dir (non-native only)

       2.  Copy the "upstream" dir from the test into the build dir (if present, non-native only)

       3.  Run the "pre_upstream" hook (if present, non-native only)

       4.  Assemble the upstream tarball (non-native only)

       5.  Copy the "debian" skeleton dir into the build dir

       6.  Copy the "debian" directory from the test into the build dir (if present)

       7.  Create debian/control and debian/changelog from "<u>&lt;file&gt;</u>.in" if they do not exist.

       8.  Create an empty watch file (if missing, non-native only)

       9.  Run the "pre_build" hook (if present)

       10. Run dpkg-buildpackage

       11. Run lintian on the build result

       12. Run the "post_test" hook (if present)

       13. Run the "test_calibration" hook (if present), which may produce a new "expected output file".

       14. Compare the result with the expected output.

       Note that the majority of the steps are conditional on native/non-native packages or presence of hooks.

       <u>A</u> <u>test</u> <u>in</u> <u>the</u> <u>"debs"</u> <u>and</u> <u>the</u> <u>"source"</u> <u>suite</u>

       The "debs" and the "source" suite share the same basic steps, which are:

       1.  Copy the skeleton dir into the build dir

       2.  Copy the test directory files into the build dir

       3.  Create changelog, control, and (debs-only) Makefile from "<u>&lt;file&gt;</u>.in" if they do not exist.

       4.  Run make in the build dir

       5.  Run lintian on the produced artifact (there must be exactly one)

       6.  Compare the result with the expected output.

       <u>A</u> <u>test</u> <u>in</u> <u>the</u> <u>"changes"</u> <u>suite</u>

       The changes test is fairly simple as there is not much building.  The steps are as the following:

       1.  Find or compute the test artifact as the following:

           -   If <u>&lt;test-dir&gt;/&lt;test-name&gt;.changes</u> exists, it is used as the artifact.

           -   Otherwise, copy <u>&lt;test-dir&gt;/&lt;test-name&gt;.changes.in</u> into the build dir and use it as a template  to
               create <u>&lt;build-dir&gt;/&lt;test-name&gt;.changes</u>.  The result is then used as the artifact to test.

       2.  Run lintian run on the artifact

       3.  Compare the result with the expected output

   <b>The</b> <b>full</b> <b>layout</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>test</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>"tests"</b> <b>suite</b>
       Each  test  in the "tests" suite is placed in <u>t/tests/&lt;check&gt;-&lt;name&gt;</u>.  In these you will find some of the
       following files:

       -   desc (mandatory)

           This is the test description file.  It is a deb822 file (i.e. same syntax as  <u>debian/control</u>),  which
           contains a number of fields.

       -   tags (mandatory, but may be empty)

           This file contains the "expected" output of lintian.

           This is generally sorted, though a few tests rely on the order of the output.  This can be controlled
           via the "Sort" field in the "desc" file.

       -   debian/ (optional, but usually what you need)

           The  unpacked  debian  package.   For  "native" package tests, this is <u>also</u> the "upstream" part.  For
           "non-native" package tests, this can be used  to  override  files  in  the  "upstream"  part  (rarely
           needed).

           The actual packaging files (e.g. <u>debian/rules</u>) would be in

            I&lt;&lt; t/tests/&lt;test-name&gt;/debian/debian/rules &gt;&gt;

           Note the double "debian".

           This part is seeded from <u>t/templates/tests/&lt;skeleton&gt;/</u>, where <u>skeleton</u> is the value of the "Skeleton"
           field from the "desc" file.

       -   upstream/ (optional, rarely needed)

           This  directory  is  the used to create the "upstream" tarball for "non-native" package tests.  Since
           most tags are emitted for both "native" and "non-native" tests, it is simpler (and  slightly  faster)
           to use "native" packages for most tests.

           The  files  here  should also be present with the same contents in the debian directory unless you're
           intentionally creating a diff.  However, as normal with a Debian package, you can omit files entirely
           from the debian directory and the deletions will be ignored by dpkg-buildpackage.

           The directory will be seeded from <u>t/templates/tests/&lt;skeleton&gt;.upstream/</u>, where <u>skeleton</u> is the value
           of the "Skeleton" field from the "desc" file.

       -   post_test (optional, rarely needed)

           This script (if present) is a sed script that can be used to "massage" the output of  lintian  before
           comparing it with the "expected output".

           The  most  common  use  for  this  script  is  to remove the architecture name, multi-arch path, drop
           hardening tags or exact standards-version number from tags output.   Here  are  some  examples  files
           used:

             # Remove the exact standards version, so the tags file will not need
             # to be updated with every new standards-version
             s/\(current is ([0-9]+\.)+[0-9]\)/(current is CURRENT)/

             # Drop all hardening tags (they can differ between architectures)
             /: hardening-.*/ d

             # Massage e.g. usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/pkgconfig into a generic path
             s, usr/lib/[^/]+/pkgconfig/, usr/lib/ARCH/pkgconfig/,

           It may be useful for other cases where the output of Lintian may change on different systems.

       -   pre_build / pre_upstream (optional, special case usage)

           If  present  and  executable,  these scripts can be used to mess with the package directory and (what
           will become) the upstream tarball.

           Their common use case is to create files in the tarballs that cannot (or preferably  should  not)  be
           included  in  the revision control system.  Common cases include "binary", "minimized" files or files
           with "weird" names such as backslashes or non UTF-8 characters.

           Both scripts receive a directory as first argument, which is the directory they should work on.  For:

           -   pre_upstream

               The script will be run before the upstream tarball  is  compiled.   The  first  argument  is  the
               directory that will be included in the upstream tarball.

           -   pre_build

               The  script will be run before dpkg-buildpackage is invoked.  The first argument is the directory
               of the unpacked debian source package.

       -   test_calibration (optional, special case usage)

           If present and executable, this script will be invoked <b>after</b> lintian <u>and</u> post_test (if present)  have
           been run.  The script can then modify the expected output <u>and</u> the actual output.

           This  is  useful  for  those  extremely  rare  cases  where  post_test  is insufficient to handle the
           requirements.  So far, this has only been needed for the hardening checks, where the  output  differs
           between architectures.

           The script will be passed 3 arguments:

           -   Path to the "expected output" file (read-only)

               This is the "tags" file from the test suite and <b>must</b> <b>not</b> be modified.

           -   Path to the "actual output" file (read-write)

               This is the file as lintian and post_test created it.

           -   Path to the "calibrated expected output" (create+write)

               This  file  does  not  exist  and  should  be  created  by the script, if it wishes to change the
               "expected output".  If this file exists when the  script  terminates,  this  file  will  be  used
               instead of the original "expected output" file.
