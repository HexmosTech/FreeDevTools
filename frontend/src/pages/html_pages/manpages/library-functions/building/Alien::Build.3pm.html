       Alien::Build - Build external dependencies for use in CPAN

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 2.84

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        my $build = Alien::Build-&gt;load('./alienfile');
        $build-&gt;load_requires('configure');
        $build-&gt;set_prefix('<a href="file:/usr/local">/usr/local</a>');
        $build-&gt;set_stage('/foo/mystage');  # needs to be absolute
        $build-&gt;load_requires($build-&gt;install_type);
        $build-&gt;download;
        $build-&gt;build;
        # files are now in /foo/mystage, it is your job (or
        # ExtUtils::MakeMaker, Module::Build, etc) to copy
        # those files into <a href="file:/usr/local">/usr/local</a>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module provides tools for building external (non-CPAN) dependencies for CPAN.  It is mainly designed
       to be used at install time of a CPAN client, and work closely with Alien::Base which is used at runtime.

       This is the detailed documentation for the Alien::Build class.  If you are starting out you probably want
       to do so from one of these documents:

       Alien::Build::Manual::Alien
           A broad overview of "Alien-Build" and its ecosystem.

       Alien::Build::Manual::AlienUser
           For  users  of  an  "Alien::libfoo"  that  is  implemented  using  Alien::Base.   (The  developer  of
           "Alien::libfoo" <u>should</u> provide the documentation necessary, but if not, this is the place to start).

       Alien::Build::Manual::AlienAuthor
           If you are writing your own Alien based on Alien::Build and Alien::Base.

       Alien::Build::Manual::FAQ
           If you have a common question that has already been answered, like "How do I use alienfile with  some
           build system".

       Alien::Build::Manual::PluginAuthor
           This is for the brave souls who want to write plugins that will work with Alien::Build + alienfile.

       Alien::Build::Manual::Security
           If  you  are  concerned  that Aliens might be downloading tarballs off the internet, then this is the
           place for you.  This will discuss some of the risks of downloading  (really  any)  software  off  the
           internet and will give you some tools to remediate these risks.

       Note  that  you  will  not  usually  create  a Alien::Build instance directly, but rather be using a thin
       installer layer, such as Alien::Build::MM (for use with ExtUtils::MakeMaker) or Alien::Build::MB (for use
       with Module::Build).  One of the goals of this project is to remain installer agnostic.

</pre><h4><b>CONSTRUCTORS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>new</b>
        my $build = Alien::Build-&gt;new;

       This creates a new empty instance of Alien::Build.  Normally you will want to use "load" below to  create
       an instance of Alien::Build from an alienfile recipe.

   <b>load</b>
        my $build = Alien::Build-&gt;load($alienfile);

       This creates an Alien::Build instance with the given alienfile recipe.

   <b>resume</b>
        my $build = Alien::Build-&gt;resume($alienfile, $root);

       Load  a  checkpointed  Alien::Build  instance.   You  will need the original alienfile and the build root
       (usually "_alien"), and a build that had been properly checkpointed using the "checkpoint" method below.

</pre><h4><b>PROPERTIES</b></h4><pre>
       There are three main properties for Alien::Build.  There are a number of properties documented here  with
       a  specific  usage.   Note  that these properties may need to be serialized into something primitive like
       JSON that does not support: regular expressions, code references of blessed objects.

       If you are writing a plugin (Alien::Build::Plugin) you should use a prefix like "plugin_<u>name</u>" (where <u>name</u>
       is the name of your plugin) so that it does not  interfere  with  other  plugin  or  future  versions  of
       Alien::Build.   For  example,  if you were writing "Alien::Build::Plugin::Fetch::NewProtocol", please use
       the prefix "plugin_fetch_newprotocol":

        sub init
        {
          my($self, $meta) = @_;

          $meta-&gt;prop( plugin_fetch_newprotocol_foo =&gt; 'some value' );

          $meta-&gt;register_hook(
            some_hook =&gt; sub {
              my($build) = @_;
              $build-&gt;install_prop-&gt;{plugin_fetch_newprotocol_bar} = 'some other value';
              $build-&gt;runtime_prop-&gt;{plugin_fetch_newprotocol_baz} = 'and another value';
            }
          );
        }

       If you are writing a alienfile recipe please use the prefix "my_":

        use alienfile;

        meta_prop-&gt;{my_foo} = 'some value';

        probe sub {
          my($build) = @_;
          $build-&gt;install_prop-&gt;{my_bar} = 'some other value';
          $build-&gt;install_prop-&gt;{my_baz} = 'and another value';
        };

       Any property may be used from a command:

        probe [ 'some command %{.meta.plugin_fetch_newprotocol_foo}' ];
        probe [ 'some command %{.install.plugin_fetch_newprotocol_bar}' ];
        probe [ 'some command %{.runtime.plugin_fetch_newprotocol_baz}' ];
        probe [ 'some command %{.meta.my_foo}' ];
        probe [ 'some command %{.install.my_bar}' ];
        probe [ 'some command %{.runtime.my_baz}' ];

   <b>meta_prop</b>
        my $href = $build-&gt;meta_prop;
        my $href = Alien::Build-&gt;meta_prop;

       Meta properties have to do with the recipe itself, and not any particular instance that probes or  builds
       that recipe.  Meta properties can be changed from within an alienfile using the "meta_prop" directive, or
       from a plugin from its "init" method (though should NOT be modified from any hooks registered within that
       "init"  method).   This  is  not  strictly  enforced, but if you do not follow this rule your recipe will
       likely be broken.

       arch
           This is a hint to an installer like Alien::Build::MM or Alien::Build::MB, that the  library  or  tool
           contains  architecture dependent files and so should be stored in an architecture dependent location.
           If not specified by your alienfile then it will be set to true.

       check_digest
           True if cryptographic digest should be checked when files are fetched or downloaded.  This is set  by
           Digest negotiator plugin.

       destdir
           Some  plugins  (Alien::Build::Plugin::Build::Autoconf  for example) support installing via "DESTDIR".
           They will set this property to true if they plan on doing such an install.  This  helps  Alien::Build
           find the staged install files and how to locate them.

           If  available,  "DESTDIR"  is used to stage install files in a sub directory before copying the files
           into "blib".  This is generally preferred method if available.

       destdir_filter
           Regular expression for the files that should be copied from the "DESTDIR" into the  stage  directory.
           If not defined, then all files will be copied.

       destdir_ffi_filter
           Same as "destdir_filter" except applies to "build_ffi" instead of "build".

       digest
           This  properties  contains  the cryptographic digests (if any) that should be used when verifying any
           fetched and downloaded files.  It is a hash reference where the key is the filename and the value  is
           an  array  reference  containing  a  pair  of  values,  the  first  being  the algorithm ('SHA256' is
           recommended) and the second is the actual digest.  The special  filename  "*"  may  be  specified  to
           indicate that any downloaded file should match that digest.  If there are both real filenames and the
           "*"  placeholder,  the  real filenames will be used for filenames that match and any other files will
           use the placeholder.  Example:

            $build-&gt;meta_prop-&gt;{digest} = {
              'foo-1.00.tar.gz' =&gt; [ SHA256 =&gt; '9feac593aa49a44eb837de52513a57736457f1ea70078346c60f0bfc5f24f2c1' ],
              'foo-1.01.tar.gz' =&gt; [ SHA256 =&gt; '6bbde6a7f10ae5924cf74afc26ff5b7bc4b4f9dfd85c6b534c51bd254697b9e7' ],
              '*'               =&gt; [ SHA256 =&gt; '33a20aae3df6ecfbe812b48082926d55391be4a57d858d35753ab1334b9fddb3' ],
            };

           Cryptographic signatures will only be checked if the check_digest meta property is  set  and  if  the
           Digest  negotiator plugin is loaded.  (The Digest negotiator can be used directly, but is also loaded
           automatically if you use the digest directive is used by the alienfile).

       env Environment variables to override during the build stage.

       env_interpolate
           Environment variable values will be interpolated with helpers.  Example:

            meta-&gt;prop-&gt;{env_interpolate} = 1;
            meta-&gt;prop-&gt;{env}-&gt;{PERL} = '%{perl}';

       local_source
           Set to true if source code package is available locally.  (that is not fetched  over  the  internet).
           This is computed by default based on the "start_url" property.  Can be set by an alienfile or plugin.

       platform
           Hash reference.  Contains information about the platform beyond just $^O.

           platform.compiler_type
               Refers  to  the  type of flags that the compiler accepts.  May be expanded in the future, but for
               now, will be one of:

               microsoft
                   On Windows when using Microsoft Visual C++

               unix
                   Virtually everything else, including gcc on windows.

               The main difference is that with Visual C++ "-LIBPATH" should be used instead of "-L", and static
               libraries should have the ".LIB" suffix instead of ".a".

           platform.system_type
               $^O is frequently good enough to make platform specific logic in your alienfile, this handles the
               case when $^O can cover platforms that provide multiple environments that Perl might  run  under.
               The main example is windows, but others may be added in the future.

               unix
               vms
               windows-activestate
               windows-microsoft
               windows-mingw
               windows-strawberry
               windows-unknown

               Note that "cygwin" and "msys" are considered "unix" even though they run on windows!

           platform.cpu.count
               Contains  a  non-negative integer of available (possibly virtual) CPUs on the system. This can be
               used by build plugins to build in parallel. The environment variable "ALIEN_CPU_COUNT" can be set
               to override the CPU count.

           platform.cpu.arch.name
               Contains a normalized name for the architecture of the current Perl. This can be  used  by  fetch
               plugins  to  determine which binary packages to download.  The value may be one of the following,
               but this list will be expanded as needed.

               "armel"
                   32-bit ARM soft-float

               "armhf"
                   32-bit ARM hard-float

               "aarch64"
                   64-bit ARM

               "ppc"
                   32-bit PowerPC (big-endian)

               "ppc64"
                   64-bit PowerPC (big-endian)

               "x86"
                   32-bit Intel (i386, i486, i686)

               "x86_64"
                   64-bit Intel (AMD64)

               "unknown"
                   Unable to detect architecture. Please report this if needed.

       out_of_source
           Build in a different directory from the where the  source  code  is  stored.   In  autoconf  this  is
           referred  to  as  a  "VPATH"  build.   Everyone  else calls this an "out-of-source" build.  When this
           property is true, instead of extracting to the source build  root,  the  downloaded  source  will  be
           extracted to an source extraction directory and the source build root will be empty.  You can use the
           "extract" install property to get the location of the extracted source.

       network
           True  if  a  network  fetch is available.  This should NOT be set by an alienfile or plugin.  This is
           computed based on the "ALIEN_INSTALL_NETWORK" environment variables.

       start_url
           The default or start URL used by fetch plugins.

   <b>install_prop</b>
        my $href = $build-&gt;install_prop;

       Install properties are used during the install phase (either under "share" or  "system"  install).   They
       are  remembered  for  the  entire install phase, but not kept around during the runtime phase.  Thus they
       cannot be accessed from your Alien::Base based module.

       autoconf_prefix
           The prefix as understood by autoconf.  This is only different on Windows Where MSYS is used and paths
           like "C:/foo" are  represented as "/C/foo" which are understood by the MSYS tools, but not  by  Perl.
           You  should  only  use this if you are using Alien::Build::Plugin::Build::Autoconf in your alienfile.
           This is set during before the build hook is run.

       download
           The location of the downloaded archive (tar.gz, or similar) or directory.   This  will  be  undefined
           until the archive is actually downloaded.

       download_detail
           This  property  contains  optional  details  about  a downloaded file.  This property is populated by
           Alien::Build core.  This property is a hash reference.  The key is the path to the file that has been
           downloaded and the value is a hash reference with additional detail.  All fields are optional.

           download_detail.digest
               This, if available, with the cryptographic signature that was successfully  matched  against  the
               downloaded  file.   It  is  an  array  reference  with a pair of values, the algorithm (typically
               something like "SHA256") and the digest.

           download_detail.protocol
               This, if available, will be the URL protocol used to fetch the downloaded file.

       env Environment variables to override during the  build  stage.   Plugins  are  free  to  set  additional
           overrides using this hash.

       extract
           The  location  of  the  last source extraction.  For a "out-of-source" build (see the "out_of_source"
           meta property above), this will only be set once.  For other types of builds, the source code may  be
           extracted multiple times, and thus this property may change.

       old [deprecated]

           Hash containing information on a previously installed Alien of the same name, if available.  This may
           be useful in cases where you want to reuse the previous install if it is still sufficient.

           old.prefix
               [deprecated]

               The  prefix for the previous install.  Versions prior to 1.42 unfortunately had this in typo form
               of "preifx".

           old.runtime
               [deprecated]

               The runtime properties from the previous install.

       patch
           Directory with patches, if available.  This will be "undef" if there are no patches.  When  initially
           installing  an  alien  this will usually be a sibling of the "alienfile", a directory called "patch".
           Once installed this will be in the share directory called "_alien/patch".  The former is  useful  for
           rebuilding an alienized package using af.

       prefix
           The  install time prefix.  Under a "destdir" install this is the same as the runtime or final install
           location.  Under a non-"destdir" install this is the "stage" directory (usually the appropriate share
           directory under "blib").

       root
           The build root directory.  This will be an absolute path.  It is the absolute form of  "./_alien"  by
           default.

       stage
           The  stage  directory  where  files  will  be  copied.   This  is  usually the root of the blib share
           directory.

       system_probe_class
           After the probe step this property may contain the plugin class that performed the system probe.   It
           shouldn't be filled in directly by the plugin (instead if should use the hook property "probe_class",
           see below).  This is optional, and not all probe plugins will provide this information.

       system_probe_instance_id
           After  the  probe  step  this  property  may contain the plugin instance id that performed the system
           probe.  It shouldn't be filled in directly by the plugin (instead if should  use  the  hook  property
           "probe_instance_id",  see  below).   This  is  optional,  and not all probe plugins will provide this
           information.

   <b>plugin_instance_prop</b>
        my $href = $build-&gt;plugin_instance_prop($plugin);

       This returns the private plugin instance properties for a given plugin.  This method should usually  only
       be  called  internally by plugins themselves to keep track of internal state.  Because the content can be
       used arbitrarily by the owning plugin because it is private to the plugin, and thus is not  part  of  the
       Alien::Build spec.

   <b>runtime_prop</b>
        my $href = $build-&gt;runtime_prop;

       Runtime  properties  are  used  during  the  install and runtime phases (either under "share" or "system"
       install).  This should include anything that you will need to know to use  the  library  or  tool  during
       runtime, and shouldn't include anything that is no longer relevant once the install process is complete.

       alien_build_version
           The version of Alien::Build used to install the library or tool.

       alt Alternate  configurations.   If  the  alienized  package has multiple libraries this could be used to
           store the different compiler or linker flags for each library.  Typically  this  will  be  set  by  a
           plugin in the gather stage (for either share or system installs).

       cflags
           The  compiler  flags.   This  is  typically  set by a plugin in the gather stage (for either share or
           system installs).

       cflags_static
           The static compiler flags.  This is typically set by a plugin in the gather stage (for  either  share
           or system installs).

       command
           The  command name for tools where the name my differ from platform to platform.  For example, the GNU
           version of make is usually "make" in Linux and "gmake" on FreeBSD.  This is typically set by a plugin
           in the gather stage (for either share or system installs).

       ffi_name
           The name DLL or shared object "name" to use when searching for dynamic libraries at runtime.  This is
           passed into FFI::CheckLib, so if your library is something like "libarchive.so" or "archive.dll"  you
           would  set this to "archive".  This may be a string or an array of strings.  This is typically set by
           a plugin in the gather stage (for either share or system installs).

       ffi_checklib
           This property contains two sub properties:

           ffi_checklib.share
                $build-&gt;runtime_prop-&gt;{ffi_checklib}-&gt;{share} = [ ... ];

               Array of additional FFI::CheckLib flags to pass in to "find_lib" for a "share" install.

           ffi_checklib.system
               Array of additional FFI::CheckLib flags to pass in to "find_lib" for a "system" install.

               Among other things, useful for specifying the "try_linker_script" flag:

                $build-&gt;runtime_prop-&gt;{ffi_checklib}-&gt;{system} = [ try_linker_script =&gt; 1 ];

           This is typically set by a plugin in the gather stage (for either share or system installs).

       inline_auto_include
           [version 2.53]

           This property is an array reference of C code that will be passed into Inline::C to  make  sure  that
           appropriate headers are automatically included.  See "auto_include" in Inline::C for details.

       install_type
           The install type.  This is set by AB core after the probe hook is executed.  Is one of:

           system
               For  when  the  library  or  tool  is  provided  by  the  operating  system,  can  be detected by
               Alien::Build, and is considered satisfactory by the "alienfile" recipe.

           share
               For when a system install is not possible,  the  library  source  will  be  downloaded  from  the
               internet or retrieved in another appropriate fashion and built.

       libs
           The library flags.  This is typically set by a plugin in the gather stage (for either share or system
           installs).

       libs_static
           The static library flags.  This is typically set by a plugin in the gather stage (for either share or
           system installs).

       perl_module_version
           The  version of the Perl module used to install the alien (if available).  For example if Alien::curl
           is installing "libcurl" this would be the version of Alien::curl used during the install step.

       prefix
           The final install root.  This is usually they share directory.

       version
           The version of the library or tool.  This is typically set by a  plugin  in  the  gather  stage  (for
           either share or system installs).

   <b>hook_prop</b>
        my $href = $build-&gt;hook_prop;

       Hook  properties are for the currently running (if any) hook.  They are used only during the execution of
       each hook and are discarded after.  If no hook is currently running then "hook_prop" will return "undef".

       name
           The name of the currently running hook.

       version (probe)
           Probe and PkgConfig plugins <u>may</u> set this property indicating the version of  the  alienized  package.
           Not all plugins and configurations may be able to provide this.

       probe_class (probe)
           Probe  and  PkgConfig  plugins <u>may</u> set this property indicating the plugin class that made the probe.
           If the probe results in a system install this will be propagated to  "system_probe_class"  for  later
           use.

       probe_instance_id (probe)
           Probe  and  PkgConfig  plugins  <u>may</u> set this property indicating the plugin instance id that made the
           probe.    If   the   probe   results   in   a   system   install   this   will   be   propagated   to
           "system_probe_instance_id" for later use.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>checkpoint</b>
        $build-&gt;checkpoint;

       Save  any  install  or  runtime properties so that they can be reloaded on a subsequent run in a separate
       process.  This is useful if your build needs to be done in multiple stages from  a  "Makefile",  such  as
       with  ExtUtils::MakeMaker.   Once checkpointed you can use the "resume" constructor (documented above) to
       resume the probe/build/install] process.

   <b>root</b>
        my $dir = $build-&gt;root;

       This is just a shortcut for:

        my $root = $build-&gt;install_prop-&gt;{root};

       Except that it will be created if it does not already exist.

   <b>install_type</b>
        my $type = $build-&gt;install_type;

       This will return the install type.  (See the like named install property above for details).  This method
       will call "probe" if it has not already been called.

   <b>is_system_install</b>
        my $boolean = $build-&gt;is_system_install;

       Returns true if the alien is a system install type.

   <b>is_share_install</b>
        my $boolean = $build-&gt;is_share_install;

       Returns true if the alien is a share install type.

   <b>download_rule</b>
        my $rule = $build-&gt;download_rule;

       This returns install rule as a string.  This is determined by the environment and should be one of:

       "warn"
           Warn only if fetching via non secure source (secure sources include "https", and bundled  files,  may
           include other encrypted protocols in the future).

       "digest"
           Require  that  any downloaded source package have a cryptographic signature in the alienfile and that
           signature matches what was downloaded.

       "encrypt"
           Require that any downloaded source package is fetched via secure source.

       "digest_or_encrypt"
           Require that any downloaded  source  package  is  <b>either</b>  fetched  via  a  secure  source  <b>or</b>  has  a
           cryptographic signature in the alienfile and that signature matches what was downloaded.

       "digest_and_encrypt"
           Require  that  any  downloaded  source  package  is  <b>both</b>  fetched  via  a  secure  source  <b>and</b> has a
           cryptographic signature in the alienfile and that signature matches what was downloaded.

       The current default is "warn", but in the near future this will be upgraded to "digest_or_encrypt".

   <b>set_prefix</b>
        $build-&gt;set_prefix($prefix);

       Set the final (unstaged) prefix.  This is normally only called by Alien::Build::MM and  similar  modules.
       It is not intended for use from plugins or from an alienfile.

   <b>set_stage</b>
        $build-&gt;set_stage($dir);

       Sets  the  stage directory.  This is normally only called by Alien::Build::MM and similar modules.  It is
       not intended for use from plugins or from an alienfile.

   <b>requires</b>
        my $hash = $build-&gt;requires($phase);

       Returns a hash reference of the modules required for the given phase.  Phases include:

       configure
           These modules must already be available when the alienfile is read.

       any These modules are used during either a "system" or "share" install.

       share
           These modules are used during the build phase of a "share" install.

       system
           These modules are used during the build phase of a "system" install.

   <b>load_requires</b>
        $build-&gt;load_requires($phase);

       This loads the appropriate modules for the given phase (see "requires" above for  a  description  of  the
       phases).

   <b>probe</b>
        my $install_type = $build-&gt;probe;

       Attempts to determine if the operating system has the library or tool already installed.  If so, then the
       string "system" will be returned and a system install will be performed.  If not, then the string "share"
       will be installed and the tool or library will be downloaded and built from source.

       If the environment variable "ALIEN_INSTALL_TYPE" is set, then that will force a specific type of install.
       If the detection logic cannot accommodate the install type requested then it will fail with an exception.

   <b>download</b>
        $build-&gt;download;

       Download the source, usually as a tarball, usually from the internet.

       Under a "system" install this does not do anything.

   <b>fetch</b>
        my $res = $build-&gt;fetch;
        my $res = $build-&gt;fetch($url, %options);

       Fetch a resource using the fetch hook.  Returns the same hash structure described below in the fetch hook
       documentation.

       [version 2.39]

       As of Alien::Build 2.39, these options are supported:

       http_headers
            my $res = $build-&gt;fetch($url, http_headers =&gt; [ $key1 =&gt; $value1, $key2 =&gt; $value 2, ... ]);

           Set  the  HTTP  request  headers on all outgoing HTTP requests.  Note that not all protocols or fetch
           plugins support setting request headers, but the ones that do not <u>should</u> issue a warning if  you  try
           to set request headers and they are not supported.

   <b>check_digest</b>
       [experimental]

        my $bool = $build-&gt;check_digest($path);

       Checks  any cryptographic signatures for the given file.  The file is specified by $path which may be one
       of:

       string
           Containing the path to the file to be checked.

       Path::Tiny
           Containing the path to the file to be checked.

       "HASH"
           A Hash reference containing information about a file.  See the fetch hook for details on the format.

       Returns true if the cryptographic signature matches, false  if  cryptographic  signatures  are  disabled.
       Will  throw  an exception if the signature does not match, or if no plugin provides the correct algorithm
       for checking the signature.

   <b>decode</b>
        my $decoded_res = $build-&gt;decode($res);

       Decode the HTML or file listing returned by "fetch".  Returns the same hash structure described below  in
       the decode hook documentation.

   <b>prefer</b>
        my $sorted_res = $build-&gt;prefer($res);

       Filter  and  sort  candidates.   The  preferred  candidate will be returned first in the list.  The worst
       candidate will be returned last.  Returns the same hash structure described  below  in  the  prefer  hook
       documentation.

   <b>extract</b>
        my $dir = $build-&gt;extract;
        my $dir = $build-&gt;extract($archive);

       Extracts  the  given archive into a fresh directory.  This is normally called internally to Alien::Build,
       and for normal usage is not needed from a plugin or alienfile.

   <b>build</b>
        $build-&gt;build;

       Run the build step.  It is expected that "probe" and "download" have already  been  performed.   What  it
       actually does depends on the type of install:

       share
           The  source  is  extracted,  and  built  as  determined  by  the  alienfile  recipe.   If  there is a
           "gather_share" that will be executed last.

       system
           The gather_system hook will be executed.

   <b>test</b>
        $build-&gt;test;

       Run the test phase

   <b>clean_install</b>
        $build-&gt;clean_install

       Clean files from the final install location.  The default implementation removes  all  files  recursively
       except  for  the  "_alien"  directory.   This is helpful when you have an old install with files that may
       break the new build.

       For a non-share install this doesn't do anything.

   <b>system</b>
        $build-&gt;system($command);
        $build-&gt;system($command, @args);

       Interpolates the command and arguments and run the results using the Perl "system" command.

   <b>log</b>
        $build-&gt;log($message);

       Send a message to the log.  By default this prints to "STDOUT".

   <b>meta</b>
        my $meta = Alien::Build-&gt;meta;
        my $meta = $build-&gt;meta;

       Returns the meta object for your Alien::Build class or instance.  The meta object is a way to  manipulate
       the  recipe,  and  so  any  changes  to  the meta object should be made before the "probe", "download" or
       "build" steps.

</pre><h4><b>META</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>prop</b>
        my $href = $build-&gt;meta-&gt;prop;

       Meta properties.  This is the same as calling "meta_prop" on the class or Alien::Build instance.

   <b>add_requires</b>
        Alien::Build-&gt;meta-&gt;add_requires($phase, $module =&gt; $version, ...);

       Add the requirement to the given phase.  Phase should be one of:

       configure
       any
       share
       system

   <b>interpolator</b>
        my $interpolator = $build-&gt;meta-&gt;interpolator;
        my $interpolator = Alien::Build-&gt;interpolator;

       Returns the Alien::Build::Interpolate instance for the Alien::Build class.

   <b>has_hook</b>
        my $bool = $build-&gt;meta-&gt;has_hook($name);
        my $bool = Alien::Build-&gt;has_hook($name);

       Returns if there is a usable hook registered with the given name.

   <b>register_hook</b>
        $build-&gt;meta-&gt;register_hook($name, $instructions);
        Alien::Build-&gt;meta-&gt;register_hook($name, $instructions);

       Register a hook with the given name.  $instruction should be  either  a  code  reference,  or  a  command
       sequence, which is an array reference.

   <b>default_hook</b>
        $build-&gt;meta-&gt;default_hook($name, $instructions);
        Alien::Build-&gt;meta-&gt;default_hook($name, $instructions);

       Register  a  default  hook,  which will be used if the alienfile does not register its own hook with that
       name.

   <b>around_hook</b>
        $build-&gt;meta-&gt;around_hook($hook_name, $code);
        Alien::Build-&gt;meta-&gt;around_hook($hook_name, $code);

       Wrap the given hook with a code reference.  This is similar to a Moose method modifier,  except  that  it
       wraps around the given hook instead of a method.  For example, this will add a probe system requirement:

        $build-&gt;meta-&gt;around_hook(
          probe =&gt; sub {
            my $orig = shift;
            my $build = shift;
            my $type = $orig-&gt;($build, @_);
            return $type unless $type eq 'system';
            # also require a configuration file
            if(-f '/etc/foo.conf')
            {
              return 'system';
            }
            else
            {
              return 'share';
            }
          },
        );

   <b>after_hook</b>
        $build-&gt;meta-&gt;after_hook($hook_name, sub {
          my(@args) = @_;
          ...
        });

       Execute  the  given  code  reference  after  the  hook.   The original arguments are passed into the code
       reference.

   <b>before_hook</b>
        $build-&gt;meta-&gt;before_hook($hook_name, sub {
          my(@args) = @_;
          ...
        });

       Execute the given code reference before the hook.  The  original  arguments  are  passed  into  the  code
       reference.

   <b>apply_plugin</b>
        Alien::Build-&gt;meta-&gt;apply_plugin($name);
        Alien::Build-&gt;meta-&gt;apply_plugin($name, @args);

       Apply the given plugin with the given arguments.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       Alien::Build responds to these environment variables:

       ALIEN_BUILD_LOG
           The default log class used.  See Alien::Build::Log and Alien::Build::Log::Default.

       ALIEN_BUILD_PKG_CONFIG
           Override  the logic in Alien::Build::Plugin::PkgConfig::Negotiate which chooses the best "pkg-config"
           plugin.

       ALIEN_BUILD_POSTLOAD
           semicolon separated list of plugins to automatically load after parsing your alienfile.

       ALIEN_BUILD_PRELOAD
           semicolon separated list of plugins to automatically load before parsing your alienfile.

       ALIEN_BUILD_RC
           Perl source file which can override some global defaults for Alien::Build, by, for  example,  setting
           preload and postload plugins.

       ALIEN_DOWNLOAD_RULE
           This  value  determines  the  rules by which types of downloads are allowed.  The legal values listed
           under "download_rule", plus  "default"  which  will  be  the  default  for  the  current  version  of
           Alien::Build.  For this version that default is "warn".

       ALIEN_INSTALL_NETWORK
           If  set  to  true  (the  default), then network fetch will be allowed.  If set to false, then network
           fetch will not be allowed.

           What constitutes a local vs. network fetch is determined based on the "start_url" and  "local_source"
           meta  properties.  An alienfile or plugin "could" override this detection (possibly inappropriately),
           so this variable is not a substitute for properly auditing of  Perl  modules  for  environments  that
           require that.

       ALIEN_INSTALL_TYPE
           If  set to "share" or "system", it will override the system detection logic.  If set to "default", it
           will use the default setting for the alienfile.  The behavior of other values is undefined.

           Although the recommended way for a consumer to use an Alien::Base based Alien is to declare it  as  a
           static  configure  and build-time dependency, some consumers may prefer to fallback on using an Alien
           only when the consumer itself cannot detect the necessary package. In some  cases  the  consumer  may
           want the user to opt-in to using an Alien before requiring it.

           To keep the interface consistent among Aliens, the consumer of the fallback opt-in Alien may fallback
           on  the  Alien if the environment variable "ALIEN_INSTALL_TYPE" is set to any value. The rationale is
           that by setting this environment variable the user is aware that Alien modules may be  installed  and
           have  indicated  consent.   The  actual implementation of this, by its nature would have to be in the
           consuming CPAN module.

       DESTDIR
           This environment variable will be manipulated during a destdir install.

       PKG_CONFIG
           This environment variable can be used to override the program name for "pkg-config"  when  using  the
           command line plugin: Alien::Build::Plugin::PkgConfig::CommandLine.

       ftp_proxy, all_proxy
           If   these  environment  variables  are  set,  it  may  influence  the  Download  negotiation  plugin
           Alien::Build::Plugin::Download::Negotiate.  Other proxy variables may be used by some Fetch  plugins,
           if they support it.

</pre><h4><b>SUPPORT</b></h4><pre>
       The  intent  of  the "Alien-Build" team is to support the same versions of Perl that are supported by the
       Perl toolchain.  As of this writing that means 5.16 and better.

</pre><h4><b>THANKS</b></h4><pre>
       Alien::Base was originally written by Joel Berger, the rest of this project would not have been  possible
       without  him getting the project started.  Thanks to his support I have been able to augment the original
       Alien::Base system with a reliable set of tools (Alien::Build, alienfile,  Test::Alien),  which  make  up
       this toolset.

       The  original  Alien::Base  is still copyright (c) 2012-2020 Joel Berger.  It has the same license as the
       rest of the Alien::Build and related tools distributed as "Alien-Build".  Joel Berger thanked a number of
       people who helped in in the development of Alien::Base, in the documentation for that module.

       I would also like to acknowledge the other members of the PerlAlien github organization, Zakariyya Mughal
       (sivoais, ZMUGHAL) and mohawk (ETJ).  Also important in the early development of  Alien::Build  were  the
       early  adopters  Chase  Whitener  (genio,  CAPOEIRAB,  author  of  Alien::libuv), William N. Braswell, Jr
       (willthechill, WBRASWELL, author of Alien::JPCRE2 and  Alien::PCRE2)  and  Ahmad  Fatoum  (a3f,  ATHREEF,
       author of Alien::libudev and Alien::LibUSB).

       The  Alien ecosystem owes a debt to Dan Book, who goes by Grinnz on IRC, for answering question about how
       to use Alien::Build and friends.
