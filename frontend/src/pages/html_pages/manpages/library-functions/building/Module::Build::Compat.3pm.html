</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Module::Build::Compat - Compatibility with ExtUtils::MakeMaker

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         # In a Build.PL :
         use Module::Build;
         my $build = Module::Build-&gt;new
           ( module_name =&gt; 'Foo::Bar',
             license     =&gt; 'perl',
             create_makefile_pl =&gt; 'traditional' );
         ...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Because "ExtUtils::MakeMaker" has been the standard way to distribute modules for a long time, many tools
       (CPAN.pm, or your system administrator) may expect to find a working <u>Makefile.PL</u> in every distribution
       they download from CPAN.  If you want to throw them a bone, you can use "Module::Build::Compat" to
       automatically generate a <u>Makefile.PL</u> for you, in one of several different styles.

       "Module::Build::Compat" also provides some code that helps out the <u>Makefile.PL</u> at runtime.

</pre><h4><b>WARNING</b></h4><pre>
       Note that "Module::Build::Compat" more often causes installation issues than solves them, and each of the
       three <u>Makefile.PL</u> generation styles has unique compatibility or functionality issues that are unlikely to
       be fixed. Thus, the use of this module and "create_makefile_pl" is discouraged.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       create_makefile_pl($style, $build)
           Creates  a  <u>Makefile.PL</u>  in  the  current  directory  in one of several styles, based on the supplied
           "Module::Build" object $build.  This is typically controlled by passing  the  desired  style  as  the
           "create_makefile_pl"  parameter  to  "Module::Build"'s  new()  method;  the  <u>Makefile.PL</u> will then be
           automatically created during the "distdir" action.

           The currently supported styles are:

           traditional
               A <u>Makefile.PL</u> will be created in the "traditional" style, i.e. it will use  "ExtUtils::MakeMaker"
               and  won't rely on "Module::Build" at all.  In order to create the <u>Makefile.PL</u>, we'll include the
               "requires" and "build_requires" dependencies as the "PREREQ_PM" parameter.

               You don't want to use this style if during the "perl Build.PL" stage you ask the user  questions,
               or  do  some  auto-sensing about the user's environment, or if you subclass "Module::Build" to do
               some customization, because the  vanilla  <u>Makefile.PL</u>  won't  do  any  of  that.   Many  standard
               "Module::Build" features such as "test_requires" are also not supported.

           small
               A  small <u>Makefile.PL</u> will be created that passes all functionality through to the <u>Build.PL</u> script
               in the same directory.  The user must already have "Module::Build"  installed  in  order  to  use
               this, or else they'll get a module-not-found error.

               This style attempts (with varying success) to translate the <u>Makefile.PL</u> protocol to <u>Build.PL</u>, and
               is  unnecessary  on  any modern toolchain that recognizes "configure_requires" metadata described
               below,    as    <u>Build.PL</u>    will    be    run    by     default     in     this     case.     See
               &lt;https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=75936&gt; for an example of the issues it may cause.

           passthrough (DEPRECATED)
               This  is  just  like the "small" option above, but if "Module::Build" is not already installed on
               the user's system, the script will offer to use "CPAN.pm" to download it and  install  it  before
               continuing with the build.

               This  option has been deprecated and may be removed in a future version of Module::Build.  Modern
               CPAN.pm and CPANPLUS will  recognize  the  "configure_requires"  metadata  property  and  install
               Module::Build  before  running  Build.PL  if  Module::Build  is listed and Module::Build now adds
               itself to configure_requires by default.

               Perl 5.10.1 includes "configure_requires" support.   In  the  future,  when  "configure_requires"
               support is deemed sufficiently widespread, the "passthrough" style will be removed.

       run_build_pl(args =&gt; \@ARGV)
           This  method  runs  the  <u>Build.PL</u>  script, passing it any arguments the user may have supplied to the
           "perl Makefile.PL" command.   Because  "ExtUtils::MakeMaker"  and  "Module::Build"  accept  different
           arguments, this method also performs some translation between the two.

           run_build_pl() accepts the following named parameters:

           args
               The  "args"  parameter  specifies the parameters that would usually appear on the command line of
               the "perl Makefile.PL" command - typically you'll just pass a reference to @ARGV.

           script
               This is the filename of the script to run - it defaults to "Build.PL".

       <b>write_makefile()</b>
           This method writes a 'dummy' <u>Makefile</u> that will  pass  all  commands  through  to  the  corresponding
           "Module::Build" actions.

           write_makefile() accepts the following named parameters:

           makefile
               The name of the file to write - defaults to the string "Makefile".

</pre><h4><b>SCENARIOS</b></h4><pre>
       So, some common scenarios are:

       1.  Just  include a <u>Build.PL</u> script (without a <u>Makefile.PL</u> script), and give installation directions in a
           <u>README</u> or <u>INSTALL</u> document explaining how to install the module.  In  particular,  explain  that  the
           user must install "Module::Build" before installing your module.

           Note  that  if you do this, you may make things easier for yourself, but harder for people with older
           versions of CPAN or CPANPLUS on their system, because  those  tools  generally  only  understand  the
           <u>Makefile.PL</u>/"ExtUtils::MakeMaker" way of doing things.

       2.  Include  a  <u>Build.PL</u>  script  and  a  "traditional"  <u>Makefile.PL</u>,  created  either  manually  or with
           create_makefile_pl().  Users won't ever have to install "Module::Build" if they use the  <u>Makefile.PL</u>,
           but they won't get to take advantage of "Module::Build"'s extra features either.

           For good measure, of course, test both the <u>Makefile.PL</u> and the <u>Build.PL</u> before shipping.

       3.  Include a <u>Build.PL</u> script and a "pass-through" <u>Makefile.PL</u> built using "Module::Build::Compat".  This
           will  mean that people can continue to use the "old" installation commands, and they may never notice
           that it's actually doing something else behind the scenes.  It will also mean that your  installation
           process is compatible with older versions of tools like CPAN and CPANPLUS.
