       dh-golang -- debhelper build system class for Go packages

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The dh-golang package provides a build system for debhelper which can be used by adding <b>dh-sequence-</b>
       <b>golang</b> to the package build dependencies, and passing the following options to <b>dh</b>:

        %:
               dh $@ --builddirectory=_build --buildsystem=golang

       Starting with debhelper 13.4 (a versioned build dependency is currently required), the build system is
       automatically detected, and the following is enough:

        %:
               dh $@ --builddirectory=_build

       Starting with debhelper compatibility level 14, the build directory defaults to <b>_</b><u>build</u>, and the following
       is enough:

        %:
               dh $@

</pre><h4><b>IMPLEMENTATION</b></h4><pre>
       Here is a brief description of how the golang build system implements each debhelper build system stage:

       <b>configure</b>
           Creates  a  Go  workspace  (see  https://golang.org/doc/code.html#Workspaces) in the build directory.
           Copies  the  source  code  into  that  workspace  and   symlinks   all   available   libraries   from
           /usr/share/gocode/src  into  the  workspace  because  the  <b><a href="../man1/go.1.html">go</a></b>(1)  tool  requires  write access to the
           workspace. See also "DH_GOLANG_INSTALL_EXTRA" and "DH_GOLANG_INSTALL_ALL".

       <b>build</b>
           Determines build targets (see also "DH_GOLANG_BUILDPKG" and "DH_GOLANG_EXCLUDES"), possibly calls "go
           generate" (see also "DH_GOLANG_GO_GENERATE"), then calls "go install".

       <b>test</b>
           Calls "go test -v" on all build targets.

       <b>install</b>
           Installs binaries and sources from the build directory into the  Debian  package  destdir.  See  also
           "--no-source" and "--no-binaries".

       <b>clean</b>
           Removes the build directory.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dh_auto_install</b>
           <b>--no-source</b>
               By  default,  all  files  within  the  src/ subdirectory of the build directory will be copied to
               /usr/share/gocode/src/ of  the  Debian  package  destdir.  Specifying  the  "--no-source"  option
               disables this behavior, which is useful if you are packaging a program (as opposed to a library).

               Example (in "debian/rules"):

                override_dh_auto_install:
                       dh_auto_install -- --no-source

           <b>--no-binaries</b>
               By  default,  all  files  within  the  bin/ subdirectory of the build directory will be copied to
               <a href="file:/usr/bin/">/usr/bin/</a> of the Debian package destdir. Specifying  the  "--no-binaries"  option  disables  this
               behavior.

               Example (in "debian/rules"):

                override_dh_auto_install:
                       dh_auto_install -- --no-binaries

               Note:  instead  of  using this option (which was added for symmetry with "--no-source"), consider
               not building unwanted binaries in the first place to save CPU time  on  our  build  daemons;  see
               "DH_GOLANG_EXCLUDES".

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       "DH_GOPKG"
           "DH_GOPKG" (string) contains the Go package name which this Debian package is building.

           "DH_GOPKG"  is  automatically  set  to  the value of the first import path of the "XS-Go-Import-Path"
           "debian/control" field, which can contain several comma-separated import paths.

           Example (in "debian/control"):

            XS-Go-Import-Path: github.com/go-mgo/mgo,
                               gopkg.in/mgo.v2,
                               labix.org/v2/mgo,
                               launchpad.net/mgo

           "DH_GOPKG" is set by dh-golang, and as  a  consequence  it  is  not  present  in  the  "debian/rules"
           environment.  If  you  need to use the Go package name in the "debian/rules" file, you must define it
           yourself.

           Example (in "debian/rules"):

            export DH_GOPKG := github.com/go-mgo/mgo

           Historical note: before the "XS-Go-Import-Path" field was introduced, we used to  set  "DH_GOPKG"  in
           "debian/rules".  When  you  encounter  such  a  package,  please  convert it by moving the value from
           "debian/rules" to "debian/control". It is preferable to use the "debian/control" field because it  is
           machine-readable and picked up/used by various Debian infrastructure tools, whereas "debian/rules" is
           very hard to parse.

       DH_GOLANG_INSTALL_EXTRA
           "DH_GOLANG_INSTALL_EXTRA" (list of strings, whitespace-separated, default empty) enumerates files and
           directories  which  are  additionally installed into the build directory. By default, only files with
           the following extension are installed: .go, .c, .cc, .cpp, .h, .hh, hpp, .proto,  .s.  Starting  with
           dh-golang  1.31, testdata directory contents are installed by default.  Starting with dh-golang 1.39,
           go.mod and go.sum are installed by default to support Go 1.11 modules.

           Example (in "debian/rules"):

            export DH_GOLANG_INSTALL_EXTRA := example.toml marshal_test.toml

       DH_GOLANG_INSTALL_ALL
           "DH_GOLANG_INSTALL_ALL" (bool, default false) controls whether all files are installed into the build
           directory. By default, only files with the following extension are installed: .go, .c, .cc, .cpp, .h,
           .hh, .hpp, .proto, .s. Starting with dh-golang 1.31, testdata directory  contents  are  installed  by
           default.  Starting with dh-golang 1.39, go.mod and go.sum are installed by default to support Go 1.11
           modules.

           Example (in "debian/rules"):

            export DH_GOLANG_INSTALL_ALL := 1

           Note:  prefer  the  "DH_GOLANG_INSTALL_EXTRA" environment variable because it is self-documenting and
           future-proof: when using "DH_GOLANG_INSTALL_ALL", readers of your package cannot  easily  tell  which
           extra  files  in  particular  need  to  be  installed,  and  newer  upstream versions might result in
           unexpected extra files.

       DH_GOLANG_BUILDPKG
           "DH_GOLANG_BUILDPKG" (list of strings, whitespace-separated, default "${DH_GOPKG}/...")  defines  the
           build  targets  for  compiling  this  Go  package. In other words, this is what will be passed to "go
           install".

           The default value matches all Go packages within the source, which is usually desired, but you  might
           need  to  exclude  example  programs,  for  which you should use the "DH_GOLANG_EXCLUDES" environment
           variable.

           Example (in "debian/rules"):

            # Install only programs for end users, the also-included Go packages are not
            # yet mature enough to be shipped for other packages to consume (despite what
            # upstream claims).
            export DH_GOLANG_BUILDPKG := github.com/debian/ratt/cmd/...

       DH_GOLANG_EXCLUDES
           "DH_GOLANG_EXCLUDES" (list of Perl regular expressions, whitespace-separated, default empty)  defines
           regular expression patterns to exclude from the build targets expanded from "DH_GOLANG_BUILDPKG".

           Please note that with DH_COMPAT level inferior or equal to 11, the default is to only exclude pattern
           from the build target.  (see "DH_GOLANG_EXCLUDES_ALL" below)

           Example (in "debian/rules"):

            # We want to build only the library packages themselves, not the accompanying
            # example binaries.
            export DH_GOLANG_EXCLUDES := examples/

       DH_GOLANG_EXCLUDES_ALL
           "DH_GOLANG_EXCLUDES_ALL"   (boolean,  default  to  true  starting  from  DH_COMPAT  level  12)  makes
           "DH_GOLANG_EXCLUDE" excludes files not only during the building process but also for  install.   This
           is  useful,  if,  for instance, examples are installed with "dh_installexamples". If you only want to
           exclude files from the building process but keep them in the source, set this to false.  Example  (in
           "debian/rules"):

            # We want to ship only the library packages themselves in the go source, not
            # the accompanying example binaries.
            export DH_GOLANG_EXCLUDES := examples/
            export DH_GOLANG_EXCLUDES_ALL := 1

       DH_GOLANG_GO_GENERATE
           "DH_GOLANG_GO_GENERATE"  (bool,  default false) controls whether "go generate" is called on all build
           targets (see "DH_GOLANG_BUILDPKG").

           It is convention in the Go community to commit all "go generate" artifacts to version control, so re-
           generating these artifacts is usually not required.

           Depending on what the Go package in  question  uses  "go  generate"  for,  you  may  want  to  enable
           "DH_GOLANG_GO_GENERATE":

           â€¢   If  the  Go  package  uses  "go generate" to generate artifacts purely from inputs within its own
               source (e.g. creating a perfect hash table), there usually is no need to re-generate that output.
               It does not necessarily hurt, either, but some "go generate" commands might be poorly tested  and
               break the build.

           â€¢   If  the  Go package uses "go generate" to (e.g.) bundle a JavaScript library into a template file
               which is then compiled into a Go program, it is advisable to re-generate that output so that  the
               Debian version of the JavaScript library is picked up, as opposed to the pre-generated version.

           Example (in "debian/rules"):

            export DH_GOLANG_GO_GENERATE := 1

           Note:  this  option  should default to true, but it was introduced after dh-golang was already widely
           used, and nobody made the transition  happen  yet  (i.e.  inspect  and  possibly  fix  any  resulting
           breakages).
