       Net::DBus::RemoteService - Access services provided on the bus

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         my $bus = Net::DBus-&gt;find;
         my $service = $bus-&gt;get_service("org.freedesktop.DBus");

         my $object = $service-&gt;get_object("/org/freedesktop/DBus");
         foreach (@{$object-&gt;ListNames}) {
           print "$_\n";
         }

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This object provides a handle to a remote service on the bus. From this handle it is possible to access
       objects associated with the service. If a service is not running, an attempt will be made to activate it
       the first time a method is called against one of its objects.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       my $service = Net::DBus::RemoteService-&gt;new($bus, $owner, $service_name);
           Creates  a new handle for a remote service. The $bus parameter is an instance of Net::DBus, $owner is
           the name of the client providing the service, while $service_name is  the  well  known  name  of  the
           service  on  the  bus.  Service  names consist of two or more tokens, separated by periods, while the
           tokens comprise the letters a-z, A-Z,  0-9  and  _,  for  example  "org.freedesktop.DBus".  There  is
           generally  no  need to call this constructor, instead the "get_service" method on Net::DBus should be
           used. This caches handles to remote services, eliminating repeated retrieval of introspection data.

       my $bus = $service-&gt;get_bus;
           Retrieves a handle for the bus to which this service is attached.  The returned  object  will  be  an
           instance of Net::DBus.

       my $service_name = $service-&gt;get_service_name
           Retrieves the name of the remote service as known to the bus.

       my $owner_name = $service-&gt;get_owner_name;
           Retrieves the name of the client owning the service at the time it was connected to.

       my $object = $service-&gt;get_object($object_path[, $interface]); =item my $object =
       $service-&gt;get_object($object_path, \%params);
           Retrieves  a  handle  to the remote object provided by the service  with the name of $object_path. If
           the optional $interface parameter is provided, the object will immediately be cast to the  designated
           interface.  NB,  it is only necessary to cast an object to a specific interface if there are multiple
           interfaces on the object providing methods with the same name, or  the  remote  object  does  support
           introspection. The returned object will be an instance of Net::DBus::RemoteObject.

           An  alternate  form  of  the method is available, passing a hash reference of extra parameters. Valid
           keys in the hash are "interface" specifying the interface name to cast to, and "timeout" specifying a
           timeout in milliseconds

       my $timeout = $service-&gt;timeout(60 * 1000);
           Sets or retrieves the timeout value which will be used for DBus requests belongs to this service. The
           value is in milliseconds.  If the timeout for a service is undefined, then the default  timeout  from
           the bus will apply.
