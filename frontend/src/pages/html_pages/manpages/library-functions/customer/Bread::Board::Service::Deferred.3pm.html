</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Bread::Board::Service::Deferred - Helper for holding a service that is not quite constructed yet

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 0.37

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Class for proxy objects used when resolving circular dependencies.

       This class uses a few nasty tricks: replacing $_[0], using "AUTOLOAD", overriding "isa" "meta" and "can",
       heavy operator overloading... you should probably not take inspiration from this code unless you really
       know what you're doing.

       In practice, a variable containing an instance of "Bread::Board::Service::Deferred" will have its value
       changed to the actual value instantiated by the service at the first opportunity, and you should not
       notice that this class was ever there.
