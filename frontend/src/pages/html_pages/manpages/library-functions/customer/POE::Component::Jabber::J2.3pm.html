</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       POE::Component::Jabber::J2 - connect to the jabberd20 router as a service

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       PCJ::J2 is a Protocol implementation that is used to connect to the jabberd20 router as a service.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       PCJ::J2 implements the jabberd2 component spec located here:
       (<a href="http://jabberd.jabberstudio.org/dev/docs/component.shtml">http://jabberd.jabberstudio.org/dev/docs/component.shtml</a>) Specifically, PCJ::J2 will negotiate TLS,
       SASL, and domain binding required to establish a working connection with jabberd2 as a service.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       Please see PCJ::Protocol for what methods this class supports.

</pre><h4><b>EVENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Listed are the exported events that make their way into the PCJ session:

       set_auth
         This handles the initial SASL authentication portion of the connection.

       init_input_handler
         This  is  our entry point. This is what PCJ uses to deliver events to us.  It handles various responses
         until the connection is initialized fully.

       build_tls_wheel
         If TLS is required by the server, this is where that negotiation process happens.

       challenge_response
         This handles the subsequent SASL authentication steps.

       binding
         This handles the domain binding

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b> <b>AND</b> <b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       This Protocol may implement the spec, but this spec hasn't been touched in quite some time. If  for  some
       reason my implementation fails against a particular jabberd2 version, please let me know.

       The  underlying  backend  has  changed  this  release  to  now  use  a  new  Node implementation based on
       XML::LibXML::Element. Please see POE::Filter::XML::Node documentation for the relevant API changes.
