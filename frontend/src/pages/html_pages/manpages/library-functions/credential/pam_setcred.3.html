       pam_setcred - establish / delete user credentials

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;security/pam_appl.h&gt;</b>

       <b>int</b> <b>pam_setcred(pam_handle_t</b> <b>*</b><u>pamh</u><b>,</b> <b>int</b> <u>flags</u><b>);</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>pam_setcred</b> function is used to establish, maintain and delete the credentials of a user. It should
       be called to set the credentials after a user has been authenticated and before a session is opened for
       the user (with <b><a href="../man3/pam_open_session.3.html">pam_open_session</a></b>(3)). The credentials should be deleted after the session has been closed
       (with <b><a href="../man3/pam_close_session.3.html">pam_close_session</a></b>(3)).

       A credential is something that the user possesses. It is some property, such as a <u>Kerberos</u> ticket, or a
       supplementary group membership that make up the uniqueness of a given user. On a Linux system the user's
       <u>UID</u> and <u>GID</u>'s are credentials too. However, it has been decided that these properties (along with the
       default supplementary groups of which the user is a member) are credentials that should be set directly
       by the application and not by PAM. Such credentials should be established, by the application, prior to a
       call to this function. For example, <b><a href="../man2/initgroups.2.html">initgroups</a></b>(2) (or equivalent) should have been performed.

       Valid <u>flags</u>, any one of which, may be logically OR'd with <b>PAM_SILENT</b>, are:

       PAM_ESTABLISH_CRED
           Initialize the credentials for the user.

       PAM_DELETE_CRED
           Delete the user's credentials.

       PAM_REINITIALIZE_CRED
           Fully reinitialize the user's credentials.

       PAM_REFRESH_CRED
           Extend the lifetime of the existing credentials.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUES</b></h4><pre>
       PAM_BUF_ERR
           Memory buffer error.

       PAM_CRED_ERR
           Failed to set user credentials.

       PAM_CRED_EXPIRED
           User credentials are expired.

       PAM_CRED_UNAVAIL
           Failed to retrieve user credentials.

       PAM_SUCCESS
           Data was successful stored.

       PAM_SYSTEM_ERR
           A NULL pointer was submitted as PAM handle, the function was called by a module or another system
           error occurred.

       PAM_USER_UNKNOWN
