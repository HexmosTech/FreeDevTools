</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       lcmaps - The Local Credential MAPping Service

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>lcmaps</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  LCMAPS  framework  is  designed to take various credentials as input, e.g. a certificate and/or VOMS
       credentials, and map them to Unix credentials as output. Unix credentials are  the  basic  POSIX  creden‐
       tials, i.e. User ID, Group ID and Secondary Group IDs. LCMAPS is a framework that can load and run one or
       more  'credential mapping' plugins.  The framework will load and run plugins to perform the identity map‐
       ping. Site and organizations can create their own new functionality by creating new plugins.  The  LCMAPS
       framework  exposes various APIs to push credentials into the framework and to get the account mapping re‐
       sults in return. The <b>lcmaps.db</b> configuration file configures the LCMAPS plugins and configures the  order
       in which the plugins are launch. Some practical examples are shown below.

       LCMAPS  is  used  by <b>gLExec</b>, the <b><a href="../man4/lcas-lcmaps-gt.4.html">lcas-lcmaps-gt</a>(4)-interface</b> to interface with a Globus GT4 and GT5 Gate‐
       keeper, GridFTP daemon and GSI-OpenSSHd, in StoRM and somewhere in XRootD.

</pre><h4><b>INVOCATION</b></h4><pre>
       When an application initializes LCMAPS the plugins will be loaded based on  the  <b>lcmaps.db</b>  configuration
       file.   The  application can use one of the APIs to provide credentials as input. The loaded plugins will
       be executed in the sequence described in the same <b>lcmaps.db</b> configuration file.

       During a plugin's execution it has access to the credential data in the LCMAPS core memory. The plugin is
       also capable of writing credential mapping results in LCMAPS. The plugins can each resolve a part of  the
       mapping  and they can also perform actions based on these (intermediate) results, e.g. run setuid, setgid
       and setgroup calls or interact with an LDAP service.

       The plugins are executed in a state machine. When a plugin finishes successfully it can execute a differ‐
       ent next plugin then when it failed. This allows LCMAPS to pass different plugins to resolve a credential
       mapping.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>GATEKEEPER_JM_ID</b>
              Extra Gatekeeper log message to be able to more easily track a Job Manager ID.

       <b>GLOBUSID</b>
              See $GATEKEEPER_JM_ID.

       <b>JOB_REPOSITORY_ID</b>
              See $GATEKEEPER_JM_ID, but explicitly for the purpose of the LCMAPS Job Repository plugin.

       <b>LCMAPS_DB_FILE</b>
              Override the build-in default filename for the <b>lcmaps.db</b> configuration file with the value of this
              environment variable.

       <b>LCMAPS_DEBUG_LEVEL</b>
              Tune the logging output cut off level. The numbers resemble the numbers as used  in  previous  re‐
              leased in the range [1-5]. However, since LCMAPS version 1.5.0 these numbers resemble a numerical‐
              ly shifted Syslog number.

              <b>0</b>      Silent logging, <b>no</b> <b>messages</b> will be written to file or Syslog.

              <b>1</b>      All  messages  with a priority of <b>LOG_ERR</b> are written to file or Syslog.  More severe error
                     messages are squashed down to the LOG_ERR priority. This is to prevent Syslog from blocking
                     on default configurations and to prevent Syslog from broadcasting LCMAPS  related  messages
                     on the connected TTYs when old plug-ins are used.

              <b>2</b>      All  messages  with  a priority of <b>LOG_WARNING</b> or more severe, i.e. LOG_ERR, are written to
                     file and/or Syslog.

              <b>3</b>      All messages with a priority of <b>LOG_NOTICE</b> or more severe, i.e. LOG_ERR or LOG_WARNING, are
                     written to file and/or Syslog. This is the default advertised setting for the  <b>lcas-lcmaps-</b>
                     <b>gt-interface</b>  and  <b>glexec</b>. The "FINAL CRED" messages are written on LOG_NOTICE and indicate
                     the resulting LCMAPS mapping from an X.509 and/or VOMS credential to a  Unix/POSIX  creden‐
                     tial.

              <b>4</b>      All messages with a priority of <b>LOG_INFO</b> or more severe, i.e. all messages between (and in‐
                     cluding)  LOG_ERR and LOG_INFO, are written to file and/or Syslog. This value is the <b>build-</b>
                     <b>in</b> <b>default</b>. The success or failures of plug-ins are written on LOG_INFO. To see the flow of
                     plug-ins this log level is the advised log level to set.

              <b>5</b>      All messages with a priority of <b>LOG_DEBUG</b> or more severe, i.e. all  messages  between  (and
                     including)  LOG_ERR and LOG_DEBUG, are written to file and/or Syslog. This is the most ver‐
                     bose mode and should be used carefully as the amount of information flowing from here might
                     hinder normal operation performance if the syslogd isn't able to keep up.

       <b>LCMAPS_DIR</b>
              The base directory of the $LCMAPS_DB_FILE  parameter.  This  variable  is  concatenated  with  the
              $LCMAPS_DB_FILE

       <b>LCMAPS_ETC_DIR</b>
              See $LCMAPS_DIR

       <b>LCMAPS_LOG_FILE</b>
              Overrides  the  build-in default file path to log the output to. When set, the logging will not go
              to Syslog.

       <b>LCMAPS_LOG_STRING</b>
              Prepend all log output messages with value of this environment variable

       <b>LCMAPS_MODULES_DIR</b>
              Directory to search for the LCMAPS plugins (or modules). Same as the <b>path</b> option in the  <b>lcmaps.db</b>
              file..

       <b>LCMAPS_POLICY_NAME</b>
              A  colon  separated  list  of  LCMAPS plugin execution policies. When this environment variable is
              present, only the listed execution policies will be executed. They will be executed in  the  order
              as written in the <b>lcmaps.db</b> file (from top to bottom).

       <b>LCMAPS_VERIFY_TYPE</b>
              Deprecated

       <b>LCMAPS_VOMS_EXTRACT</b>
              Deprecated

       <b>LCMAPS_X509_CERT_DIR</b>
              Specific setting equal to the $X509_CERT_DIR environment variable

       <b>LCMAPS_X509_VOMS_DIR</b>
              Specific setting equal to the $X509_VOMS_DIR environment variable

       <b>X509_CERT_DIR</b>
              The  directory where all the CA files, e.g. CA certificate and CRL files, are located. The default
              location is: /etc/grid-security/certificates/.

       <b>X509_VOMS_DIR</b>
              This VOMS directory will hold the VOMS .lsc files and/or PEM files to authenticate  the  VOMS  At‐
              tributes Certificates. Subdirectories are named by the VO name and scope the .lsc and PEM files in
              their authentication to one particular VO. The default location is: /etc/grid-security/vomsdir/.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>LCMAPS_SUCCESS</b>
              Success.

       <b>LCMAPS_FAIL</b>
              Failure.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       The apidoc is not complete. It has most interfaces, but needs to be checked for completeness.
