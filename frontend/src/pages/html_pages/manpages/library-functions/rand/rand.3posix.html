</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       rand, rand_r, srand — pseudo-random number generator

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/stdlib.h">stdlib.h</a>&gt;

       int rand(void);
       int rand_r(unsigned *<u>seed</u>);
       void srand(unsigned <u>seed</u>);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       For  <u>rand</u>()  and  <u>srand</u>():  The  functionality described on this reference page is aligned with the ISO C
       standard. Any conflict between the requirements described here and the ISO C standard  is  unintentional.
       This volume of POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO C standard.

       The <u>rand</u>() function shall compute a sequence of pseudo-random integers in the range [0,{RAND_MAX}] with a
       period of at least 232.

       The <u>rand</u>() function need not be thread-safe.

       The  <u>rand_r</u>()  function  shall  compute a sequence of pseudo-random integers in the range [0,{RAND_MAX}].
       (The value of the {RAND_MAX} macro shall be at least 32767.)

       If <u>rand_r</u>() is called with the same initial value for the object pointed to by <u>seed</u> and  that  object  is
       not modified between successive returns and calls to <u>rand_r</u>(), the same sequence shall be generated.

       The  <u>srand</u>()  function  uses  the  argument  as  a seed for a new sequence of pseudo-random numbers to be
       returned by subsequent calls to <u>rand</u>().  If <u>srand</u>() is then called with the same seed value, the sequence
       of pseudo-random numbers shall be repeated. If <u>rand</u>() is called before any calls to <u>srand</u>() are made, the
       same sequence shall be generated as when <u>srand</u>() is first called with a seed value of 1.

       The implementation shall behave as if no function defined in this volume of POSIX.1‐2017 calls <u>rand</u>()  or
       <u>srand</u>().

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>rand</u>() function shall return the next pseudo-random number in the sequence.

       The <u>rand_r</u>() function shall return a pseudo-random integer.

       The <u>srand</u>() function shall not return a value.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       No errors are defined.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Generating</b> <b>a</b> <b>Pseudo-Random</b> <b>Number</b> <b>Sequence</b>
       The following example demonstrates how to generate a sequence of pseudo-random numbers.

           #include &lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/stdio.h">stdio.h</a>&gt;
           #include &lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/stdlib.h">stdlib.h</a>&gt;
           ...
               long count, i;
               char *keystr;
               int elementlen, len;
               char c;
           ...
           /* Initial random number generator. */
               <a href="../man1/srand.1.html">srand</a>(1);

               /* Create keys using only lowercase characters */
               len = 0;
               for (i=0; i&lt;count; i++) {
                   while (len &lt; elementlen) {
                       c = (char) (rand() % 128);
                       if (islower(c))
                           keystr[len++] = c;
                   }

                   keystr[len] = '\0';
                   printf("%s Element%0*ld\n", keystr, elementlen, i);
                   len = 0;
               }

   <b>Generating</b> <b>the</b> <b>Same</b> <b>Sequence</b> <b>on</b> <b>Different</b> <b>Machines</b>
       The  following  code  defines a pair of functions that could be incorporated into applications wishing to
       ensure that the same sequence of numbers is generated across different machines.

           static unsigned long next = 1;
           int myrand(void)  /* RAND_MAX assumed to be 32767. */
           {
               next = next * 1103515245 + 12345;
               return((unsigned)(next/65536) % 32768);
           }

           void mysrand(unsigned seed)
           {
               next = seed;
           }

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>drand48</u>() and <u>random</u>() functions provide much more elaborate pseudo-random number generators.

       The limitations on the amount of state that can be carried between one function call and another mean the
       <u>rand_r</u>() function can never be implemented in a way which satisfies all of the requirements on a  pseudo-
       random number generator.

       These  functions  should  be  avoided  whenever  non-trivial  requirements  (including safety) have to be
       fulfilled.

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       The ISO C standard <u>rand</u>() and <u>srand</u>() functions allow per-process pseudo-random  streams  shared  by  all
       threads.  Those  two  functions  need  not  change,  but  there  has to be mutual-exclusion that prevents
       interference between two threads concurrently accessing the random number generator.

       With regard to <u>rand</u>(), there are two different behaviors that may be wanted in a multi-threaded program:

        1. A single per-process sequence of pseudo-random numbers that is shared by all threads that call <u>rand</u>()

        2. A different sequence of pseudo-random numbers for each thread that calls <u>rand</u>()

       This is provided by the modified thread-safe function based on whether the seed value is  global  to  the
       entire process or local to each thread.

       This  does  not  address  the  known deficiencies of the <u>rand</u>() function implementations, which have been
       approached by maintaining more state. In effect, this specifies new  thread-safe  forms  of  a  deficient
       function.

</pre><h4><b>FUTURE</b> <b>DIRECTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>rand_r</u>() function may be removed in a future version.
