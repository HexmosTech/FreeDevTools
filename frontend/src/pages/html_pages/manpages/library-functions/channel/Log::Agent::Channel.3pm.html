</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Log::Agent::Channel - ancestor class for all Log::Agent channels

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        @Log::Agent::Channel::XXX::ISA = qw(Log::Agent::Channel);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The "Log::Agent::Channel" class is the root class from which all "Log::Agent" channels inherit. It is a
       <u>deferred</u> class, meaning that it cannot be instantiated directly. All the deferred routines need to be
       implemented by its heirs to form a valid driver.

       Internally, the various "Log::Agent::Driver" objects create "Log::Agent::Channel" instances for each
       logging channel defined at driver creation time.  The channels are therefore architecturally hidden
       within "Log::Agent", since this module only provides redefined mappings for the various <b>logxxx()</b> routines
       (<b>logerr()</b>, <b>logwarn()</b>, <b>logdie()</b>, etc...).

       However, this does not mean that channel classes cannot be used externally: the "Log::Agent::Logger"
       extension makes "Log::Agent::Channel" objects architecturally visible, thereby offering an application-
       level logging API that can be redirected to various places transparently for the application.

</pre><h4><b>CHANNEL</b> <b>LIST</b></h4><pre>
       The following channels are currently made available by "Log::Agent".  More channels can be defined by the
       "Log::Agent::Logger" extension:

       Log::Agent::Channel::File
           This  channel  writes  logs to files, defined by their path or via a magical opening sequence such as
           "|cmd".  See Log::Agent::Channel::File.

       Log::Agent::Channel::Handle
           This channel writes logs to an already opened  descriptor,  as  specified  by  its  file  handle:  an
           IO::Handle object, or a GLOB reference such as \*FILE.  See Log::Agent::Channel::Handle.

       Log::Agent::Channel::Syslog
           This  channel  redirects  logs  to  the  <b><a href="../man8/syslogd.8.html">syslogd</a></b>(8) daemon, which will then handle the dispatching to
           various logfiles, based on its own configuration.  See Log::Agent::Channel::Syslog.

</pre><h4><b>INTERFACE</b></h4><pre>
       You need not read this section if you're only <b>using</b> "Log::Agent".  However,  if  you  wish  to  <b>implement</b>
       another channel, then this section might be of interest.

       The following routines are <b>deferred</b> and therefore need to be defined by the heir:

       write($priority, $logstring)
           Emit  the  log  entry  held  in  $logstring,  at priority $priority.  A trailing "\n" is added to the
           $logstring, if needed (i.e. if the physical entity does not do it already, like syslog does).

           The $priority argument must be a valid syslog priority, i.e. one of the following  strings:  "emerg",
           "alert", "crit", "err", "warning", "notice", "info", "debug".

           The $logstring may not really be a plain string. It can actually be a Log::Agent::Message object with
           an overloaded stringification routine, so the illusion should be complete.

       close
           Close the channel.

       make
           This is the creation routine. Its signature varies for each channel, naturally.
