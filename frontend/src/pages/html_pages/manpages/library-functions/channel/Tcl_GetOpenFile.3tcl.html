       Tcl_GetOpenFile - Return a FILE* for a channel registered in the given interpreter (Unix only)

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;tcl.h&gt;</b>

       int
       <b>Tcl_GetOpenFile</b>(<u>interp,</u> <u>chanID,</u> <u>write,</u> <u>checkUsage,</u> <u>filePtr</u>)

</pre><h4><b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Tcl_Interp <u>*interp</u> (in)             Tcl interpreter from which file handle is to be obtained.

       const char <u>*chanID</u> (in)             String identifying channel, such as <b>stdin</b> or <b>file4</b>.

       int <u>write</u> (in)                      Non-zero  means the file will be used for writing, zero means it will
                                           be used for reading.

       int <u>checkUsage</u> (in)                 If non-zero, then an error will be generated  if  the  file  was  not
                                           opened for the access indicated by <u>write</u>.

       void <u>**filePtr</u> (out)                Points  to  word  in which to store pointer to FILE structure for the
                                           file given by <u>chanID</u>.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Tcl_GetOpenFile</b> takes as argument a file identifier of the form returned by the <b>open</b> command and  returns
       at  <u>*filePtr</u> a pointer to the FILE structure for the file.  The <u>write</u> argument indicates whether the FILE
       pointer will be used for reading or writing.  In some cases,  such  as  a  channel  that  connects  to  a
       pipeline   of   subprocesses,  different  FILE  pointers  will  be  returned  for  reading  and  writing.
       <b>Tcl_GetOpenFile</b> normally returns <b>TCL_OK</b>.  If an error occurs in <b>Tcl_GetOpenFile</b> (e.g. <u>chanID</u> did not make
       any sense or <u>checkUsage</u> was set and the file was not opened for  the  access  specified  by  <u>write</u>)  then
       <b>TCL_ERROR</b>  is  returned  and  the  interpreter's  result  will  contain an error message.  In the current
       implementation <u>checkUsage</u> is ignored and consistency checks are always performed.

       Note that this interface is only supported on the Unix platform.
