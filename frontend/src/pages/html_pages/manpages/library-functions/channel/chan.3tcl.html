       chan - Read, write and manipulate channels

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>chan</b> <u>option</u> ?<u>arg</u> <u>arg</u> <u>...</u>?
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  command  provides  several  operations for reading from, writing to and otherwise manipulating open
       channels (such as have been created with the <b>open</b> and <b>socket</b> commands,  or  the  default  named  channels
       <b>stdin</b>,  <b>stdout</b>  or  <b>stderr</b>  which  correspond  to  the process's standard input, output and error streams
       respectively).  <u>Option</u> indicates what to do with the channel;  any  unique  abbreviation  for  <u>option</u>  is
       acceptable. Valid options are:

       <b>chan</b> <b>blocked</b> <u>channel</u>
              This  tests whether the last input operation on the channel called <u>channel</u> failed because it would
              have otherwise caused the process to block, and returns 1 if that  was  the  case.  It  returns  0
              otherwise.  Note  that  this  only  ever returns 1 when the channel has been configured to be non-
              blocking; all Tcl channels have blocking turned on by default.

       <b>chan</b> <b>close</b> <u>channel</u> ?<u>direction</u>?
              Close and destroy the channel called <u>channel</u>. Note that  this  deletes  all  existing  file-events
              registered  on  the channel.  If the <u>direction</u> argument (which must be <b>read</b> or <b>write</b> or any unique
              abbreviation of them) is present, the channel will only be half-closed, so that  it  can  go  from
              being  read-write  to  write-only  or read-only respectively. If a read-only channel is closed for
              reading, it is the same as if the channel is fully closed, and respectively similar for write-only
              channels. Without the <u>direction</u> argument, the channel is closed for both reading and writing  (but
              only  if  those  directions  are  currently open). It is an error to close a read-only channel for
              writing, or a write-only channel for reading.

              As part of closing the channel, all buffered output is flushed  to  the  channel's  output  device
              (only  if  the  channel  is  ceasing to be writable), any buffered input is discarded (only if the
              channel is ceasing to be readable), the underlying operating system resource is closed and <u>channel</u>
              becomes unavailable for future use (both only if the channel is being completely closed).

              If the channel is blocking and the channel is ceasing to be writable, the command does not  return
              until  all  output  is flushed.  If the channel is non-blocking and there is unflushed output, the
              channel remains open and the command returns immediately; output will be flushed in the background
              and the channel will be closed when all the flushing is complete.

              If <u>channel</u> is a blocking channel for a command pipeline  then  <b>chan</b>  <b>close</b>  waits  for  the  child
              processes to complete.

              If  the  channel  is shared between interpreters, then <b>chan</b> <b>close</b> makes <u>channel</u> unavailable in the
              invoking interpreter but has no other effect until all of the sharing interpreters have closed the
              channel. When the last interpreter in which the channel  is  registered  invokes  <b>chan</b>  <b>close</b>  (or
              <b>close</b>),  the  cleanup  actions  described  above  occur.  With half-closing, the half-close of the
              channel only applies to the current interpreter's view of the  channel  until  all  channels  have
              closed  it in that direction (or completely).  See the <b>interp</b> command for a description of channel
              sharing.

              Channels are automatically fully closed when an interpreter is  destroyed  and  when  the  process
              exits.   Channels  are  switched  to blocking mode, to ensure that all output is correctly flushed
              before the process exits.

              The command returns an empty string, and may generate an error if an error occurs  while  flushing
              output.   If  a  command  in  a  command  pipeline  created with <b>open</b> returns an error, <b>chan</b> <b>close</b>
              generates an error (similar to the <b>exec</b> command.)

              Note that half-closes of sockets and command pipelines can have  important  side  effects  because
              they  result  in  a  shutdown() or close() of the underlying system resource, which can change how
              other processes or systems respond to the Tcl program.

              Channels are automatically closed when an interpreter is destroyed and  when  the  process  exits.
              From  8.6 on (TIP#398), nonblocking channels are no longer switched to blocking mode when exiting;
              this guarantees a timely exit even when the peer or a communication channel is stalled. To  ensure
              proper  flushing  of stalled nonblocking channels on exit, one must now either (a) actively switch
              them back to blocking or (b) use the  environment  variable  <b>TCL_FLUSH_NONBLOCKING_ON_EXIT</b>,  which
              when set and not equal to “<b>0</b>” restores the previous behavior.

       <b>chan</b> <b>configure</b> <u>channel</u> ?<u>optionName</u>? ?<u>value</u>? ?<u>optionName</u> <u>value</u>?...
              Query or set the configuration options of the channel named <u>channel</u>.

              If  no  <u>optionName</u>  or  <u>value</u>  arguments  are  supplied,  the  command  returns  a list containing
              alternating option names and values for the channel.  If <u>optionName</u> is supplied but no <u>value</u>  then
              the command returns the current value of the given option.  If one or more pairs of <u>optionName</u> and
              <u>value</u> are supplied, the command sets each of the named options to the corresponding <u>value</u>; in this
              case the return value is an empty string.

              The options described below are supported for all channels. In addition, each channel type may add
              options  that  only  it  supports.  See the manual entry for the command that creates each type of
              channel for the options supported by that specific type of channel. For example,  see  the  manual
              entry  for  the  <b>socket</b>  command  for  additional  options  for  sockets, and the <b>open</b> command for
              additional options for serial devices.

       <b>-blocking</b> <u>boolean</u>
              The <b>-blocking</b> option determines whether I/O operations on the channel can  cause  the  process  to
              block  indefinitely.   The  value  of  the  option  must  be a proper boolean value.  Channels are
              normally in blocking mode; if a channel is placed  into  non-blocking  mode  it  will  affect  the
              operation  of  the  <b>chan</b>  <b>gets</b>, <b>chan</b> <b>read</b>, <b>chan</b> <b>puts</b>, <b>chan</b> <b>flush</b>, and <b>chan</b> <b>close</b> commands; see the
              documentation for those commands for details.   For  non-blocking  mode  to  work  correctly,  the
              application must be using the Tcl event loop (e.g. by calling <b>Tcl_DoOneEvent</b> or invoking the <b>vwait</b>
              command).

       <b>-buffering</b> <u>newValue</u>
              If  <u>newValue</u>  is  <b>full</b> then the I/O system will buffer output until its internal buffer is full or
              until the <b>chan</b> <b>flush</b>  command  is  invoked.  If  <u>newValue</u>  is  <b>line</b>,  then  the  I/O  system  will
              automatically  flush output for the channel whenever a newline character is output. If <u>newValue</u> is
              <b>none</b>, the I/O system will flush automatically after every output operation.  The  default  is  for
              <b>-buffering</b>  to be set to <b>full</b> except for channels that connect to terminal-like devices; for these
              channels the initial setting is <b>line</b>.  Additionally, <b>stdin</b> and <b>stdout</b> are initially set  to  <b>line</b>,
              and <b>stderr</b> is set to <b>none</b>.

       <b>-buffersize</b> <u>newSize</u>
              <u>newSize</u>  must  be an integer; its value is used to set the size of buffers, in bytes, subsequently
              allocated for this channel to store input or output. <u>newSize</u> must be a number of no more than  one
              million, allowing buffers of up to one million bytes in size.

       <b>-encoding</b> <u>name</u>
              This  option is used to specify the encoding of the channel as one of the named encodings returned
              by <b>encoding</b> <b>names</b>, so that the data can be converted to and from Unicode  for  use  in  Tcl.   For
              instance,  in  order  for  Tcl  to  read  characters from a Japanese file in <b>shiftjis</b> and properly
              process and display the contents, the encoding would be set to <b>shiftjis</b>.  Thereafter, when reading
              from the channel, the bytes in the Japanese file would be converted to Unicode as they  are  read.
              Writing  is  also supported - as Tcl strings are written to the channel they will automatically be
              converted to the specified encoding on output.

              If a file contains pure binary data (for instance, a JPEG image), the  encoding  for  the  channel
              should  be  configured to be <b>iso8859-1</b>.  Tcl will then assign no interpretation to the data in the
              file and simply read or write raw bytes.  The Tcl <b>binary</b> command can be used  to  manipulate  this
              byte-oriented  data.   It is usually better to set the <b>-translation</b> option to <b>binary</b> when you want
              to transfer binary data, as this turns off the other automatic interpretations of the bytes in the
              stream as well.

              The default encoding for newly opened channels is the same platform- and  locale-dependent  system
              encoding used for interfacing with the operating system, as returned by <b>encoding</b> <b>system</b>.

       <b>-eofchar</b> <u>char</u>
              This option supports DOS file systems that use Control-z (\x1A) as an end of file marker.  If <u>char</u>
              is  not  an  empty  string,  then this character signals end-of-file when it is encountered during
              input.  Otherwise (the default) there is no special end of file character marker.  The  acceptable
              range  for  <b>-eofchar</b>  values is \x01 - \x7f; attempting to set <b>-eofchar</b> to a value outside of this
              range will generate an error.                                                                      2

       <b>-profile</b> <u>profile</u>                                                                                          2
              Specifies the encoding profile to be used on the channel. The encoding transforms in use  for  the 2
              channel's  input  and  output will then be subject to the rules of that profile. Any failures will 2
              result in a channel error. See <b>PROFILES</b> in the  <b><a href="../man3tcl/encoding.3tcl.html">encoding</a>(3tcl)</b>  documentation  for  details  about 2
              encoding profiles.

       <b>-translation</b> <u>translation</u>

       <b>-translation</b> <b>{</b><u>inTranslation</u> <u>outTranslation</u><b>}</b>
              In  Tcl  scripts  the  end  of a line is always represented using a single newline character (\n).
              However, in actual files and devices the end of a line may be represented differently on different
              platforms, or even for different devices on the same platform.  For example, under  UNIX  newlines
              are  used  in  files,  whereas  carriage-return-linefeed  sequences  are  normally used in network
              connections.  On input (i.e., with <b>chan</b> <b>gets</b> and <b>chan</b>  <b>read</b>)  the  Tcl  I/O  system  automatically
              translates  the  external  end-of-line representation into newline characters.  Upon output (i.e.,
              with <b>chan</b> <b>puts</b>), the I/O system translates newlines to the  external  end-of-line  representation.
              The  default  translation  mode,  <b>auto</b>,  handles  all  the  common  cases  automatically,  but the
              <b>-translation</b> option provides explicit control over the end of line translations.

              The value associated with <b>-translation</b> is a single item for  read-only  and  write-only  channels.
              The  value  is  a two-element list for read-write channels; the read translation mode is the first
              element of the list, and the write translation mode is the second element.  As a convenience, when
              setting the translation mode for a read-write channel you can specify a  single  value  that  will
              apply  to both reading and writing.  When querying the translation mode of a read-write channel, a
              two-element list will always be returned.  The following values are currently supported:

              <b>auto</b>   As the input translation mode, <b>auto</b> treats any of newline (<b>lf</b>), carriage  return  (<b>cr</b>),  or
                     carriage return followed by a newline (<b>crlf</b>) as the end of line representation.  The end of
                     line  representation  can  even change from line-to-line, and all cases are translated to a
                     newline.  As the output translation mode, <b>auto</b> chooses a platform specific  representation;
                     for sockets on all platforms Tcl chooses <b>crlf</b>, for all Unix flavors, it chooses <b>lf</b>, and for
                     the  various  flavors  of Windows it chooses <b>crlf</b>.  The default setting for <b>-translation</b> is
                     <b>auto</b> for both input and output.

              <b>binary</b> Like <b>lf</b>, no end-of-line translation is performed, but in addition,  sets  <b>-eofchar</b>  to  the
                     empty  string  to  disable  it,  and sets <b>-encoding</b> to <b>iso8859-1</b>.  With this one setting, a
                     channel is fully configured for binary input and output:  Each byte read from  the  channel
                     becomes  the  Unicode  character  having  the  same  value as that byte, and each character
                     written to the channel becomes a single byte in the output.  This makes it possible to work
                     seamlessly with binary data as long as each character in the data remains in the range of 0
                     to 255 so that there is no distinction between binary data and text.  For example,  A  JPEG
                     image  can  be  read  from  a  such a channel, manipulated, and then written back to such a
                     channel.

              <b>cr</b>     The end of a line in the underlying file or device is  represented  by  a  single  carriage
                     return  character.   As  the  input  translation mode, <b>cr</b> mode converts carriage returns to
                     newline characters.  As the output translation mode, <b>cr</b> mode translates newline  characters
                     to carriage returns.

              <b>crlf</b>   The  end  of  a  line  in the underlying file or device is represented by a carriage return
                     character followed by a linefeed character.  As  the  input  translation  mode,  <b>crlf</b>  mode
                     converts   carriage-return-linefeed   sequences  to  newline  characters.   As  the  output
                     translation mode, <b>crlf</b>  mode  translates  newline  characters  to  carriage-return-linefeed
                     sequences.  This mode is typically used on Windows platforms and for network connections.

              <b>lf</b>     The  end  of  a  line  in  the underlying file or device is represented by a single newline
                     (linefeed) character.  In this mode no translations occur during either  input  or  output.
                     This mode is typically used on UNIX platforms.

       <b>chan</b> <b>copy</b> <u>inputChan</u> <u>outputChan</u> ?<b>-size</b> <u>size</u>? ?<b>-command</b> <u>callback</u>?
              Reads  characters  from  <u>inputChan</u>  and writes them to <u>outputChan</u> until all characters are copied,
              blocking until the copy is complete and returning the  number  of  characters  copied.   Leverages
              internal  buffers  to  avoid extra copies and to avoid buffering too much data in main memory when
              copying large files to slow destinations like network sockets.

              <b>-size</b> limits the number of characters copied.

              If <b>-command</b> is given, <b>chan</b> <b>copy</b> returns immediately, works in the background, and  calls  <u>callback</u>
              when  the  copy completes, providing as an additional argument the number of characters written to
              <u>outputChan</u>.  If an error occurs during the background copy, another argument provides message  for
              the error.  <u>inputChan</u> and <u>outputChan</u> are automatically configured for non-blocking mode if needed.
              Background copying only works correctly if events are being processed, e.g. via <b>vwait</b> or Tk.

              During  a  background  copy  no  other  read operation may be performed on <u>inputChan</u>, and no write
              operation may be performed on <u>outputChan</u>.  However, write operations may by performed on <u>inputChan</u>
              and read operations may be performed on <u>outputChan</u>, as exhibited by the bidirectional copy example
              below.

              If either <u>inputChan</u> or <u>outputChan</u> is closed while the copy is in progress, copying ceases  and  <b>no</b>
              callback is made.  If <u>inputChan</u> is closed all data already queued is written to <u>outputChan</u>.

              There  should be no event handler established for <u>inputChan</u>  because it may become readable during
              a background copy.  An attempt to read or write from within an event handler results result in the
              error,  "channel busy".  Any wrong-sided I/O attempted (by a  <b>chan</b>  <b>event</b>  handler  or  otherwise)
              results in a “channel busy” error.

       <b>chan</b> <b>create</b> <u>mode</u> <u>cmdPrefix</u>
              This  subcommand  creates  a  new  script  level channel using the command prefix <u>cmdPrefix</u> as its
              handler. Any such channel is called a <b>reflected</b> channel. The specified command prefix,  <b>cmdPrefix</b>,
              must  be  a  non-empty  list, and should provide the API described in the <b>refchan</b> manual page. The
              handle of the new channel is returned as the result of the <b>chan</b> <b>create</b> command, and the channel is
              open. Use either <b>close</b> or <b>chan</b> <b>close</b> to remove the channel.

              The argument <u>mode</u> specifies if the new channel is opened for reading, writing, or both. It has  to
              be  a  list  containing  any  of  the  strings  “<b>read</b>” or “<b>write</b>”, The list must have at least one
              element, as a channel you can neither write to nor read from makes no sense. The  handler  command
              for the new channel must support the chosen mode, or an error is thrown.

              The  command  prefix  is executed in the global namespace, at the top of call stack, following the
              appending of arguments as described in the <b>refchan</b> manual page. Command resolution happens at  the
              time  of  the  call.  Renaming the command, or destroying it means that the next call of a handler
              method may fail, causing the channel command invoking the handler to fail as  well.  Depending  on
              the  subcommand  being  invoked,  the error message may not be able to explain the reason for that
              failure.

              Every channel created with this subcommand knows which interpreter it was  created  in,  and  only
              ever  executes its handler command in that interpreter, even if the channel was shared with and/or
              was moved into a different interpreter. Each reflected  channel  also  knows  the  thread  it  was
              created  in,  and  executes its handler command only in that thread, even if the channel was moved
              into a different thread. To this end all invocations of the handler are forwarded to the  original
              thread  by posting special events to it. This means that the original thread (i.e. the thread that
              executed the <b>chan</b> <b>create</b> command) must have an active event loop, i.e. it must be able to  process
              such events. Otherwise the thread sending them will <u>block</u> <u>indefinitely</u>. Deadlock may occur.

              Note  that  this  permits  the  creation  of  a  channel whose two endpoints live in two different
              threads, providing a stream-oriented bridge between these threads. In other words, we can  provide
              a way for regular stream communication between threads instead of having to send commands.

              When  a thread or interpreter is deleted, all channels created with this subcommand and using this
              thread/interpreter as their computing base are deleted as well, in all interpreters they have been
              shared with or moved into, and in whatever thread they have been transferred to. While this  pulls
              the rug out under the other thread(s) and/or interpreter(s), this cannot be avoided. Trying to use
              such a channel will cause the generation of a regular error about unknown channel handles.

              This  subcommand  is  <b>safe</b>  and  made  accessible to safe interpreters.  While it arranges for the
              execution of arbitrary Tcl code the system also makes sure that the code is always executed within
              the safe interpreter.

       <b>chan</b> <b>eof</b> <u>channel</u>
              Test whether the last input operation on the channel called <u>channel</u> failed because the end of  the
              data stream was reached, returning 1 if end-of-file was reached, and 0 otherwise.

       <b>chan</b> <b>event</b> <u>channel</u> <u>event</u> ?<u>script</u>?
              Arrange  for  the  Tcl script <u>script</u> to be installed as a <u>file</u> <u>event</u> <u>handler</u> to be called whenever
              the channel called <u>channel</u> enters the state described by <u>event</u> (which must be either  <b>readable</b>  or
              <b>writable</b>);  only  one such handler may be installed per event per channel at a time.  If <u>script</u> is
              the empty string, the current handler is deleted (this also happens if the channel  is  closed  or
              the interpreter deleted).  If <u>script</u> is omitted, the currently installed script is returned (or an
              empty  string  if no such handler is installed).  The callback is only performed if the event loop
              is being serviced (e.g. via <b>vwait</b> or <b>update</b>).

              A file event handler is a binding between a  channel  and  a  script,  such  that  the  script  is
              evaluated  whenever  the  channel  becomes  readable  or  writable.   File event handlers are most
              commonly used to allow data to be received from another process on an event-driven basis, so  that
              the  receiver  can continue to interact with the user or with other channels while waiting for the
              data to arrive.  If an application invokes <b>chan</b> <b>gets</b> or <b>chan</b> <b>read</b> on a blocking channel when there
              is no input data available, the process will block; until the input data arrives, it will  not  be
              able to service other events, so it will appear to the user to “freeze up” .  With <b>chan</b> <b>event</b>, the
              process  can  tell  when data is present and only invoke <b>chan</b> <b>gets</b> or <b>chan</b> <b>read</b> when they will not
              block.

              A channel is considered to be readable if there is unread data available on the underlying device.
              A channel is also considered to be readable if there is unread data in an input buffer, except  in
              the  special case where the most recent attempt to read from the channel was a <b>chan</b> <b>gets</b> call that
              could not find a complete line in the input buffer.  This feature allows a file to be read a  line
              at  a  time  in non-blocking mode using events.  A channel is also considered to be readable if an
              end of file or error condition is present on the underlying file or device.  It is  important  for
              <u>script</u>  to  check  for these conditions and handle them appropriately; for example, if there is no
              special check for end of file, an infinite loop may occur where <u>script</u> reads no data, returns, and
              is immediately invoked again.

              A channel is considered to be writable if at least  one  byte  of  data  can  be  written  to  the
              underlying  file or device without blocking, or if an error condition is present on the underlying
              file or device.  Note that client sockets opened in asynchronous mode become  writable  when  they
              become connected or if the connection fails.

              Event-driven  I/O  works  best  for channels that have been placed into non-blocking mode with the
              <b>chan</b> <b>configure</b> command.  In blocking mode, a <b>chan</b> <b>puts</b> command may block if you give it more  data
              than  the underlying file or device can accept, and a <b>chan</b> <b>gets</b> or <b>chan</b> <b>read</b> command will block if
              you attempt to read more data than is ready; no events will be processed while the commands block.
              In non-blocking mode <b>chan</b> <b>puts</b>, <b>chan</b> <b>read</b>, and <b>chan</b> <b>gets</b> never block.

              The script for a file event is executed at global level (outside the context of any Tcl procedure)
              in the interpreter in which the <b>chan</b>  <b>event</b>  command  was  invoked.   If  an  error  occurs  while
              executing  the script then the command registered with <b>interp</b> <b>bgerror</b> is used to report the error.
              In addition, the file event handler is deleted if it ever returns an error; this is done in  order
              to prevent infinite loops due to buggy handlers.

       <b>chan</b> <b>flush</b> <u>channel</u>
              Ensures that all pending output for the channel called <u>channel</u> is written.

              If  the  channel is in blocking mode the command does not return until all the buffered output has
              been flushed to the channel. If the channel is in non-blocking mode, the command may return before
              all buffered output has been flushed; the remainder will be flushed in the background as  fast  as
              the underlying file or device is able to absorb it.

       <b>chan</b> <b>gets</b> <u>channel</u> ?<u>varName</u>?
              Reads  a line from the channel consisting of all characters up to the next end-of-line sequence or
              until end of file is seen. The line feed character corresponding to end-of-line  sequence  is  not
              included  as  part  of  the line.  If the <u>varName</u> argument is specified, the line is stored in the
              variable of that name and the command returns the length of the line. If <u>varName</u> is not specified,
              the command returns the line itself as the result of the command.

              If a complete line is not available and the channel is not at EOF, the command will block  in  the
              case of a blocking channel. For non-blocking channels, the command will return the empty string as
              the result in the case of <u>varName</u> not specified and -1 if it is.

              If  a  blocking  channel  is already at EOF, the command returns an empty string if <u>varName</u> is not
              specified. Note an empty string result can also be returned  when  a  blank  line  (no  characters
              before  the next end of line sequence). The two cases can be distinguished by calling the <b>chan</b> <b>eof</b>
              command to check for end of file. If <u>varName</u> is specified, the command returns -1 on end of  file.
              There is no ambiguity in this case because blank lines result in 0 being returned.

              If  a  non-blocking channel is already at EOF, the command returns an empty line if <u>varName</u> is not
              specified. This can be distinguished from an empty line being returned  by  either  a  blank  line
              being  read  or  a  full line not being available through the use of the <b>chan</b> <b>eof</b> and <b>chan</b> <b>blocked</b>
              commands. If <b>chan</b> <b>eof</b> returns true, the channel is at EOF. If <b>chan</b> <b>blocked</b> returns  true,  a  full
              line  was  not  available.  If  both commands return false, an empty line was read. If <u>varName</u> was
              specified for a non-bocking channel at EOF, the command returns -1. This can be distinguished from
              full line not being available either by <b>chan</b> <b>eof</b> or <b>chan</b> <b>blocked</b> as above. Note that when  <u>varName</u>
              is  specified,  there  is  no  need  to distinguish between eof and blank lines as the latter will
              result in the command returning 0.

              If the encoding profile <b>strict</b> is in effect for the channel, the command will raise  an  exception
              with the POSIX error code <b>EILSEQ</b> if any encoding errors are encountered in the channel input data.
              The file pointer remains unchanged and it is possible to introspect, and in some cases recover, by
              changing the encoding in use. See <b>ENCODING</b> <b>ERROR</b> <b>EXAMPLES</b> later.

       <b>chan</b> <b>isbinary</b> <u>channel</u>
              Test  whether  the  channel  called  <u>channel</u>  is a binary channel, returning 1 if it is and, and 0
              otherwise. A binary channel is  a  channel  with  iso8859-1  encoding,  -eofchar  set  to  {}  and
              -translation set to lf.

       <b>chan</b> <b>names</b> ?<u>pattern</u>?
              Produces a list of all channel names. If <u>pattern</u> is specified, only those channel names that match
              it (according to the rules of <b>string</b> <b>match</b>) will be returned.

       <b>chan</b> <b>pending</b> <u>mode</u> <u>channel</u>
              Depending  on  whether  <u>mode</u>  is  <b>input</b>  or <b>output</b>, returns the number of bytes of input or output
              (respectively) currently buffered internally for <u>channel</u> (especially useful in  a  readable  event
              callback  to impose application-specific limits on input line lengths to avoid a potential denial-
              of-service attack where a hostile user crafts an extremely long line that  exceeds  the  available
              memory to buffer it).  Returns -1 if the channel was not opened for the mode in question.

       <b>chan</b> <b>pipe</b>
              Creates  a  standalone  pipe whose read- and write-side channels are returned as a 2-element list,
              the first element being the read side and the second  the  write  side.  Can  be  useful  e.g.  to
              redirect  separately  <b>stderr</b>  and  <b>stdout</b>  from a subprocess. To do this, spawn with "2&gt;@" or "&gt;@"
              redirection operators onto the write side of a pipe, and then immediately close it in the  parent.
              This is necessary to get an EOF on the read side once the child has exited or otherwise closed its
              output.

              Note that the pipe buffering semantics can vary at the operating system level substantially; it is
              not  safe to assume that a write performed on the output side of the pipe will appear instantly to
              the input side. This is a fundamental difference and Tcl cannot conceal  it.  The  overall  stream
              semantics  <u>are</u>  compatible, so blocking reads and writes will not see most of the differences, but
              the details of what exactly gets written when are not. This is most likely to show up  when  using
              pipelines  for  testing;  care  should  be  taken  to  ensure that deadlocks do not occur and that
              potential short reads are allowed for.

       <b>chan</b> <b>pop</b> <u>channel</u>
              Removes the topmost transformation from the channel <u>channel</u>, if there is  any.  If  there  are  no
              transformations  added to <u>channel</u>, this is equivalent to <b>chan</b> <b>close</b> of that channel. The result is
              normally the empty string, but can be an error in  some  situations  (i.e.  where  the  underlying
              system stream is closed and that results in an error).

       <b>chan</b> <b>postevent</b> <u>channel</u> <u>eventSpec</u>
              This  subcommand  is  used by command handlers specified with <b>chan</b> <b>create</b>. It notifies the channel
              represented by the handle <u>channel</u> that the event(s) listed in the  <u>eventSpec</u>  have  occurred.  The
              argument  has  to be a list containing any of the strings <b>read</b> and <b>write</b>. The list must contain at
              least one element as it does not make sense to invoke the command if there are no events to post.

              Note that this subcommand can only be used with channel handles that were created/opened  by  <b>chan</b>
              <b>create</b>. All other channels will cause this subcommand to report an error.

              As  only  the  Tcl  level of a channel, i.e. its command handler, should post events to it we also
              restrict the usage of this command to the interpreter that created the channel.  In  other  words,
              posting   events  to  a  reflected  channel  from  an  interpreter  that  does  not  contain  it's
              implementation is not allowed. Attempting to post an event from any other interpreter  will  cause
              this subcommand to report an error.

              Another restriction is that it is not possible to post events that the I/O core has not registered
              an  interest  in. Trying to do so will cause the method to throw an error. See the command handler
              method <b>watch</b> described in <b>refchan</b>, the  document  specifying  the  API  of  command  handlers  for
              reflected channels.

              This  command  is  <b>safe</b> and made accessible to safe interpreters.  It can trigger the execution of
              <b>chan</b> <b>event</b> handlers, whether in the current interpreter or in other interpreters or other threads,
              even where the event is posted from a safe interpreter and listened for by a trusted  interpreter.
              <b>Chan</b> <b>event</b> handlers are <u>always</u> executed in the interpreter that set them up.

       <b>chan</b> <b>push</b> <u>channel</u> <u>cmdPrefix</u>
              Adds  a  new transformation on top of the channel <u>channel</u>. The <u>cmdPrefix</u> argument describes a list
              of one or more words which represent a handler that will be used to implement the  transformation.
              The  command  prefix  must  provide the API described in the <b>transchan</b> manual page.  The result of
              this subcommand is a handle to the transformation. Note that it is important to make sure that the
              transformation is capable of supporting the channel mode that it is used with or this can make the
              channel neither readable nor writable.

       <b>chan</b> <b>puts</b> ?<b>-nonewline</b>? ?<u>channel</u>? <u>string</u>
              Writes <u>string</u> to the channel named <u>channel</u> followed by a newline  character.  A  trailing  newline
              character  is  written  unless  the  optional flag <b>-nonewline</b> is given. If <u>channel</u> is omitted, the
              string is written to the standard output channel, <b>stdout</b>.

              Newline characters in the output are translated by  <b>chan</b>  <b>puts</b>  to  platform-specific  end-of-line
              sequences  according  to the currently configured value of the <b>-translation</b> option for the channel
              (for example, on PCs newlines are normally replaced with carriage-return-linefeed  sequences;  see
              <b>chan</b> <b>configure</b> above for details).

              Tcl  buffers output internally, so characters written with <b>chan</b> <b>puts</b> may not appear immediately on
              the output file or device; Tcl will normally delay output until the buffer is full or the  channel
              is closed.  You can force output to appear immediately with the <b>chan</b> <b>flush</b> command.

              When  the output buffer fills up, the <b>chan</b> <b>puts</b> command will normally block until all the buffered
              data has been accepted for output by the operating system.  If <u>channel</u>  is  in  non-blocking  mode
              then  the  <b>chan</b>  <b>puts</b>  command will not block even if the operating system cannot accept the data.
              Instead, Tcl continues to buffer the data  and  writes  it  in  the  background  as  fast  as  the
              underlying  file  or  device  can accept it.  The application must use the Tcl event loop for non-
              blocking output to work; otherwise Tcl never finds out that the file or device is ready  for  more
              output  data.  It is possible for an arbitrarily large amount of data to be buffered for a channel
              in non-blocking mode, which could consume a large amount of memory.  To avoid wasting memory, non-
              blocking I/O should normally be used in an event-driven fashion with the <b>chan</b>  <b>event</b>  command  (do
              not  invoke  <b>chan</b> <b>puts</b> unless you have recently been notified via a file event that the channel is
              ready for more output data).

              The command will raise an error exception with POSIX error code <b>EILSEQ</b>  if  the  encoding  profile
              <b>strict</b>  is  in  effect  for  the  channel  and  the  output data cannot be encoded in the encoding
              configured for the channel. Data may be partially written to the channel in this case.

       <b>chan</b> <b>read</b> <u>channel</u> ?<u>numChars</u>?

       <b>chan</b> <b>read</b> ?<b>-nonewline</b>? <u>channel</u>
              In the first form, the result will be the next <u>numChars</u> characters read  from  the  channel  named
              <u>channel</u>;  if  <u>numChars</u>  is omitted, all characters up to the point when the channel would signal a
              failure (whether an end-of-file, blocked or other error condition) are read. In  the  second  form
              (i.e.  when  <u>numChars</u>  has  been  omitted)  the  flag <b>-nonewline</b> may be given to indicate that any
              trailing newline in the string that has been read should be trimmed.

              If <u>channel</u> is in non-blocking mode, <b>chan</b> <b>read</b> may not read as many characters as  requested:  once
              all  available input has been read, the command will return the data that is available rather than
              blocking for more input.  If the channel is configured to use a multi-byte  encoding,  then  there
              may  actually  be  some  bytes  remaining  in  the  internal  buffers  that do not form a complete
              character.  These bytes will not be returned until a complete character is  available  or  end-of-
              file  is reached.  The <b>-nonewline</b> switch is ignored if the command returns before reaching the end
              of the file.

              <b>Chan</b> <b>read</b> translates end-of-line sequences in the input into newline characters according  to  the
              <b>-translation</b>  option  for  the  channel  (see <b>chan</b> <b>configure</b> above for a discussion on the ways in
              which <b>chan</b> <b>configure</b> will alter input).

              When reading from a serial port, most applications should configure the serial port channel to  be
              non-blocking, like this:

                     <b>chan</b> <b>configure</b> <u>channel</u> <b>-blocking</b> <u>0</u>.

              Then  <b>chan</b>  <b>read</b> behaves much like described above.  Note that most serial ports are comparatively
              slow; it is entirely possible to get a <b>readable</b> event for each character read from them. Care must
              be taken when using <b>chan</b> <b>read</b> on blocking serial ports:

              <b>chan</b> <b>read</b> <u>channel</u> <u>numChars</u>
                     In this form <b>chan</b> <b>read</b> blocks until <u>numChars</u> have been received from the serial port.

              <b>chan</b> <b>read</b> <u>channel</u>
                     In this form <b>chan</b> <b>read</b> blocks until the reception of the end-of-file  character,  see  <b>chan</b>
                     <b>configure</b>  <b>-eofchar</b>. If there no end-of-file character has been configured for the channel,
                     then <b>chan</b> <b>read</b> will block forever.

              If the encoding profile <b>strict</b> is in effect for the channel, the command will raise  an  exception
              with the POSIX error code <b>EILSEQ</b> if any encoding errors are encountered in the channel input data.
              If  the  channel  is in blocking mode, the error is thrown after advancing the file pointer to the
              beginning of the invalid data. The successfully decoded leading portion of the data prior  to  the
              error  location  is  returned as the value of the <b>-data</b> key of the error option dictionary. If the
              channel is in non-blocking mode, the successfully decoded portion  of  data  is  returned  by  the
              command  without an error exception being raised. A subsequent read will start at the invalid data
              and immediately raise a <b>EILSEQ</b> POSIX error exception. Unlike the blocking channel case, the  <b>-data</b>
              key is not present in the error option dictionary. In the case of exception thrown due to encoding
              errors,  it is possible to introspect, and in some cases recover, by changing the encoding in use.
              See <b>ENCODING</b> <b>ERROR</b> <b>EXAMPLES</b> later.

       <b>chan</b> <b>seek</b> <u>channel</u> <u>offset</u> ?<u>origin</u>?
              Sets the current access position within the underlying data stream for the channel  named  <u>channel</u>
              to  be  <u>offset</u>  bytes  relative  to  <u>origin</u>. <u>Offset</u> must be an integer (which may be negative) and
              <u>origin</u> must be one of the following:

              <b>start</b>  The new access position will be <u>offset</u> bytes from the  start  of  the  underlying  file  or
                     device.

              <b>current</b>
                     The  new  access position will be <u>offset</u> bytes from the current access position; a negative
                     <u>offset</u> moves the access position backwards in the underlying file or device.

              <b>end</b>    The new access position will be <u>offset</u> bytes from  the  end  of  the  file  or  device.   A
                     negative  <u>offset</u>  places  the access position before the end of file, and a positive <u>offset</u>
                     places the access position after the end of file.

              The <u>origin</u> argument defaults to <b>start</b>.

              <b>Chan</b> <b>seek</b> flushes all buffered output for the channel before the  command  returns,  even  if  the
              channel  is  in  non-blocking mode.  It also discards any buffered and unread input.  This command
              returns an empty string.  An error occurs if this command is applied to channels whose  underlying
              file or device does not support seeking.

              Note  that  <u>offset</u>  values  are byte offsets, not character offsets.  Both <b>chan</b> <b>seek</b> and <b>chan</b> <b>tell</b>
              operate in terms of bytes, not characters, unlike <b>chan</b> <b>read</b>.

       <b>chan</b> <b>tell</b> <u>channel</u>
              Returns a number giving the current access position within the  underlying  data  stream  for  the
              channel  named  <u>channel</u>.  This  value returned is a byte offset that can be passed to <b>chan</b> <b>seek</b> in
              order to set the channel to a particular position.  Note that this value is in terms of bytes, not
              characters like <b>chan</b> <b>read</b>.  The value returned is -1 for channels that do not support seeking.

       <b>chan</b> <b>truncate</b> <u>channel</u> ?<u>length</u>?
              Sets the byte length of the underlying data stream for the channel named <u>channel</u> to be <u>length</u>  (or
              to the current byte offset within the underlying data stream if <u>length</u> is omitted). The channel is
              flushed before truncation.

   <b>SIMPLE</b> <b>CHANNEL</b> <b>OPERATION</b> <b>EXAMPLES</b>
       Instruct Tcl to always send output to <b>stdout</b> immediately, whether or not it is to a terminal:

              <b>fconfigure</b> stdout -buffering none

       In the following example a file is opened using the encoding CP1252, which is common on Windows, searches
       for a string, rewrites that part, and truncates the file two lines later.

              set f [open somefile.txt r+]
              <b>chan</b> <b>configure</b> $f -encoding cp1252
              set offset 0

              <u>#</u> <u>Search</u> <u>for</u> <u>string</u> <u>"FOOBAR"</u> <u>in</u> <u>the</u> <u>file</u>
              while {[<b>chan</b> <b>gets</b> $f line] &gt;= 0} {
                  set idx [string first FOOBAR $line]
                  if {$idx &gt;= 0} {
                      <u>#</u> <u>Found</u> <u>it;</u> <u>rewrite</u> <u>line</u>

                      <b>chan</b> <b>seek</b> $f [expr {$offset + $idx}]
                      <b>chan</b> <b>puts</b> -nonewline $f BARFOO

                      <u>#</u> <u>Skip</u> <u>to</u> <u>end</u> <u>of</u> <u>following</u> <u>line,</u> <u>and</u> <u>truncate</u>
                      <b>chan</b> <b>gets</b> $f
                      <b>chan</b> <b>gets</b> $f
                      <b>chan</b> <b>truncate</b> $f

                      <u>#</u> <u>Stop</u> <u>searching</u> <u>the</u> <u>file</u> <u>now</u>
                      break
                  }

                  <u>#</u> <u>Save</u> <u>offset</u> <u>of</u> <u>start</u> <u>of</u> <u>next</u> <u>line</u> <u>for</u> <u>later</u>
                  set offset [<b>chan</b> <b>tell</b> $f]
              }
              <b>chan</b> <b>close</b> $f

       This  example  illustrates  flushing of a channel. The user is prompted for some information. Because the
       standard input channel is line buffered, it must be flushed for the user to see the prompt.

              chan puts -nonewline "Please type your name: "
              <b>chan</b> <b>flush</b> stdout
              chan gets stdin name
              chan puts "Hello there, $name!"

       This example reads a file one line at a time and prints it out with the current line number  attached  to
       the start of each line.

              set chan [open "some.file.txt"]
              set lineNumber 0
              while {[<b>chan</b> <b>gets</b> $chan line] &gt;= 0} {
                  chan puts "[incr lineNumber]: $line"
              }
              chan close $chan

       In  this  example illustrating event driven reads, <b>GetData</b> will be called with the channel as an argument
       whenever $chan becomes readable. The <b>read</b> call will read whatever  binary  data  is  currently  available
       without  blocking.   Here the channel has the fileevent removed when an end of file occurs to avoid being
       continually called (see above). Alternatively the channel may be closed on this condition.

              proc GetData {chan} {
                  set data [chan read $chan]
                  chan puts "[string length $data] $data"
                  if {[chan eof $chan]} {
                      chan event $chan readable {}
                  }
              }

              chan configure $chan -blocking 0 -translation binary
              <b>chan</b> <b>event</b> $chan readable [list GetData $chan]

       The next example is similar but uses <b>chan</b> <b>gets</b> to read line-oriented data.

              proc GetData {chan} {
                  if {[chan gets $chan line] &gt;= 0} {
                      chan puts $line
                  }
                  if {[chan eof $chan]} {
                      chan close $chan
                  }
              }

              chan configure $chan -blocking 0 -buffering line -translation crlf
              <b>chan</b> <b>event</b> $chan readable [list GetData $chan]

       A network server that echoes its input line-by-line without preventing servicing of other connections  at
       the same time:

              # This is a very simple logger...
              proc log {message} {
                  <b>chan</b> <b>puts</b> stdout $message
              }

              # This is called whenever a new client connects to the server
              proc connect {chan host port} {
                  set clientName [format &lt;%s:%d&gt; $host $port]
                  log "connection from $clientName"
                  <b>chan</b> <b>configure</b> $chan -blocking 0 -buffering line
                  <b>chan</b> <b>event</b> $chan readable [list echoLine $chan $clientName]
              }

              # This is called whenever either at least one byte of input
              # data is available, or the channel was closed by the client.
              proc echoLine {chan clientName} {
                  <b>chan</b> <b>gets</b> $chan line
                  if {[<b>chan</b> <b>eof</b> $chan]} {
                      log "finishing connection from $clientName"
                      <b>chan</b> <b>close</b> $chan
                  } elseif {![<b>chan</b> <b>blocked</b> $chan]} {
                      # Didn't block waiting for end-of-line
                      log "$clientName - $line"
                      <b>chan</b> <b>puts</b> $chan $line
                  }
              }

              # Create the server socket and enter the event-loop to wait
              # for incoming connections...
              socket -server connect 12345
              vwait forever

       The following example reads a PPM-format image from a file combining ASCII and binary content.

              # Open the file and put it into Unix ASCII mode
              set f [open teapot.ppm]
              <b>chan</b> <b>configure</b> $f -encoding ascii -translation lf

              # Get the header
              if {[chan gets $f] ne "P6"} {
                  error "not a raw-bits PPM"
              }

              # Read lines until we have got non-comment lines
              # that supply us with three decimal values.
              set words {}
              while {[llength $words] &lt; 3} {
                  chan gets $f line
                  if {[string match "#*" $line]} continue
                  lappend words {*}[join [scan $line %d%d%d]]
              }

              # Those words supply the size of the image and its
              # overall depth per channel. Assign to variables.
              lassign $words xSize ySize depth

              # Now switch to binary mode to pull in the data,
              # one byte per channel (red,green,blue) per pixel.
              <b>chan</b> <b>configure</b> $f -translation binary
              set numDataBytes [expr {3 * $xSize * $ySize}]
              set data [chan read $f $numDataBytes]

              close $f

   <b>FILE</b> <b>SEEK</b> <b>EXAMPLES</b>
       Read a file twice:

              set f [open file.txt]
              set data1 [chan read $f]
              <b>chan</b> <b>seek</b> $f 0
              set data2 [chan read $f]
              chan close $f
              # $data1 eq $data2 if the file wasn't updated

       Read the last 10 bytes from a file:

              set f [open file.data]
              # This is guaranteed to work with binary data but
              # may fail with other encodings...
              chan configure $f -translation binary
              <b>chan</b> <b>seek</b> $f -10 end
              set data [chan read $f 10]
              chan close $f

       Read a line from a file channel only if it starts with <b>foobar</b>:

              # Save the offset in case we need to undo the read...
              set offset [<b>tell</b> $chan]
              if {[read $chan 6] eq "foobar"} {
                  gets $chan line
              } else {
                  set line {}
                  # Undo the read...
                  seek $chan $offset
              }

   <b>ENCODING</b> <b>ERROR</b> <b>EXAMPLES</b>
       The  example  below  illustrates  handling  of an encoding error encountered during channel input. First,
       creation of a test file containing the invalid UTF-8 sequence (<b>A</b> <b>\xC3</b> <b>B</b>):

              % set f [open test_A_195_B.txt wb]; chan puts -nonewline $f A\xC3B; chan close $f

       An attempt to read the file will result in an encoding error which is then introspected by switching  the
       channel  to  binary  mode.  Note in the example that when the error is reported the file position remains
       unchanged so that the <b>chan</b> <b>gets</b> during recovery returns the full line.

              % set f [open test_A_195_B.txt r]
              file384b6a8
              % chan configure $f -encoding utf-8
              % catch {chan gets $f} e d
              1
              % set d
              -code 1 -level 0
              -errorstack {INNER {invokeStk1 gets file384b6a8}}
              -errorcode {POSIX EILSEQ {invalid or incomplete multibyte or wide character}}
              -errorinfo {...} -errorline 1
              % chan tell $f
              0
              % chan configure $f -translation binary
              % chan gets $f
              AÃB

       The following example is similar to the above but  demonstrates  recovery  after  a  blocking  read.  The
       successfully decoded data "A" is returned in the error options dictionary key <b>-data</b>. The file position is
       advanced  on  the encoding error position 1. The data at the error position is thus recovered by the next
       <b>chan</b> <b>read</b> command.

              % set f [open test_A_195_B.txt r]
              file35a65a0
              % chan configure $f -encoding utf-8 -blocking 1
              % catch {chan read $f} e d
              1
              % set d
              -data A -code 1 -level 0
              -errorstack {INNER {invokeStk1 read file35a65a0}}
              -errorcode {POSIX EILSEQ {invalid or incomplete multibyte or wide character}}
              -errorinfo {...} -errorline 1
              % chan tell $f
              1
              % chan configure $f -translation binary
              % chan read $f
              ÃB
              % chan close $f

       Finally the same example, but this time with a non-blocking channel.

              % set f [open test_A_195_B.txt r]
              file35a65a0
              % chan configure $f -encoding utf-8 -blocking 0
              % chan read $f
              A
              % chan tell $f
              1
              % catch {chan read $f} e d
              1
              % set d
              -code 1 -level 0
              -errorstack {INNER {invokeStk1 read file384b228}}
              -errorcode {POSIX EILSEQ {invalid or incomplete multibyte or wide character}}
              -errorinfo {...} -errorline 1

   <b>CHANNEL</b> <b>COPY</b> <b>EXAMPLES</b>
       The first example transfers the contents of one channel exactly to another. Note that  when  copying  one
       file  to  another,  it  is  better to use <b>file</b> <b>copy</b> which also copies file metadata (e.g. the file access
       permissions) where possible.

              <b>chan</b> <b>configure</b> $in -translation binary
              <b>chan</b> <b>configure</b> $out -translation binary
              <b>chan</b> <b>copy</b> $in $out

       This second example shows how the callback gets passed the number of bytes  transferred.   It  also  uses
       vwait  to  put  the  application  into  the event loop.  Of course, this simplified example could be done
       without the command callback.

              proc Cleanup {in out bytes {error {}}} {
                  global total
                  set total $bytes
                  <b>chan</b> <b>close</b> $in
                  <b>chan</b> <b>close</b> $out
                  if {$error ne ""} {
                      # error occurred during the copy
                  }
              }

              set in [open $file1]
              set out [socket $server $port]
              <b>chan</b> <b>copy</b> $in $out -command [list Cleanup $in $out]
              vwait total

       The third example copies in chunks and tests for end of file in the command callback.

              proc CopyMore {in out chunk bytes {error {}}} {
                  global total done
                  incr total $bytes
                  if {($error ne "") || [<b>chan</b> <b>eof</b> $in]} {
                      set done $total
                      <b>chan</b> <b>close</b> $in
                      <b>chan</b> <b>close</b> $out
                  } else {
                      <b>chan</b> <b>copy</b> $in $out -size $chunk \
                          -command [list CopyMore $in $out $chunk]
                  }
              }

              set in [open $file1]
              set out [socket $server $port]
              set chunk 1024
              set total 0
              <b>chan</b> <b>copy</b> $in $out -size $chunk \
                  -command [list CopyMore $in $out $chunk]
              vwait done

       The fourth example starts an asynchronous, bidirectional copy between two sockets. Those  could  also  be
       pipes  from  two  bidirectional  pipelines  (e.g.,  <u>[open</u>  <u>"|hal</u> <u>9000"</u> <u>r+]</u>); the conversation will remain
       essentially secret to the script, since all four <b>chan</b> <b>event</b> slots are busy, though  any  transforms  that
       are <b>chan</b> <b>push</b>ed on the channels will be able to observe the passing traffic.

              proc Done {dir args} {
                  global flows done
                  <b>chan</b> <b>puts</b> "$dir is over."
                  incr flows -1
                  if {$flows &lt;= 0} {
                      set done 1
                  }
              }

              set flows 2
              <b>chan</b> <b>copy</b> $sok1 $sok2 -command [list Done UP]
              <b>chan</b> <b>copy</b> $sok2 $sok1 -command [list Done DOWN]
              vwait done
