       Log::Agent::Channel::File - file logging channel for Log::Agent

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        require Log::Agent::Channel::File;

        my $driver = Log::Agent::Channel::File-&gt;make(
            -prefix     =&gt; "prefix",
            -stampfmt   =&gt; "own",
            -showpid    =&gt; 1,
            -magic_open =&gt; 0,
            -filename   =&gt; "/tmp/output.err",
            -fileperm   =&gt; 0640,
            -share      =&gt; 1,
        );

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The file channel performs logging to a file, along with the necessary prefixing and stamping of the
       messages.

       Internally, the "Log::Agent::Driver::File" driver creates such objects for each logging channel defined
       at driver creation time.

       The creation routine <b>make()</b> takes the following arguments:

       "-filename" =&gt; <u>file</u>
           The  file  name where output should go.  The file is opened in append mode and autoflushing is turned
           on.  See also the "-magic_open" flag.

       "-fileperm" =&gt; <u>perm</u>
           The permissions that the file should be opened with (XOR'd with the user's umask).  Due to the nature
           of the underlying <b>open()</b> and <b>sysopen()</b>, the value is limited to less than  or  equal  to  0666.   See
           "umask" in <b><a href="../man3/perlfunc.3.html">perlfunc</a></b>(3) for more details.

       "-magic_open" =&gt; <u>flag</u>
           When  true,  channel  filenames  beginning with '&gt;' or '|' are opened using Perl's <b>open()</b>. Otherwise,
           <b>sysopen()</b> is used, in append mode.

           Default is <u>false</u>.

       "-no_newline" =&gt; <u>flag</u>
           When set to <u>true</u>, never append any "\n" (on Unix) or "\r\n" (on Windows) to log messages.

           Internally, Log::Agent relies on the channel to delimit logged lines appropriately, so this  flag  is
           not used.  However, it might be useful for "Log::Agent::Logger" users.

           Default is <u>false</u>, meaning newline markers are systematically appended.

       "-no_prefixing" =&gt; <u>flag</u>
           When  set  to  <u>true</u>,  disable  the  prefixing  logic entirely, i.e. the following options are ignored
           completely: "-prefix", "-showpid", "-no_ucfirst", "-stampfmt".

           Default is <u>false</u>.

       "-no_ucfirst" =&gt; <u>flag</u>
           When set to <u>true</u>, don't upper-case the first letter of the log message entry when there's  no  prefix
           inserted  before the logged line.  When there is a prefix, a ":" character follows, and therefore the
           leading letter of the message should not be upper-cased anyway.

           Default is <u>false</u>, meaning uppercasing is performed.

       "-prefix" =&gt; <u>prefix</u>
           The application prefix string to prepend to messages.

       "-rotate" =&gt; <u>object</u>
           This sets a default logfile rotation policy.  You need to install the additional "Log::Agent::Rotate"
           module to use this switch.

           <u>object</u> is the "Log::Agent::Rotate" instance describing the rotating policy  for  the  channel.   Only
           files which are not opened via a so-called <u>magic</u> <u>open</u> can be rotated.

       "-share" =&gt; <u>flag</u>
           When  <u>true</u>,  this  flag  records the channel in a global pool indexed by filenames.  An existing file
           handle for the same filename may be then be shared amongst several file channels.

           However, you will get this message in the file

            Rotation for 'filename' may be wrong (shared with distinct policies)

           when a rotation policy different from the one used during the initial opening is given.  Which policy
           will be used is unspecified, on purpose.

       "-showpid" =&gt; <u>flag</u>
           If set to true, the PID of the process will be appended within square brackets after the  prefix,  to
           all messages.

           Default is <u>false</u>.

       "-stampfmt" =&gt; (<u>name</u> | <u>CODE</u>)
           Specifies   the   time   stamp   format   to   use.  By  default,  my  "own"  format  is  used.   See
           Log::Agent::Stamping for a description of the available format names.

           You may also specify a CODE ref: that routine will be called every time we need  to  compute  a  time
           stamp. It should not expect any parameter, and should return a string.

</pre><h4><b>CAVEAT</b></h4><pre>
       Beware  of  <b>chdir()</b>.   If your program uses <b>chdir()</b>, you should always specify logfiles by using absolute
       paths, otherwise you run the risk of having your relative paths become invalid:  there  is  no  anchoring
       done  at  the  time  you  specify  them.  This is especially true when configured for rotation, since the
       logfiles are recreated as needed and you might end up with many logfiles  scattered  throughout  all  the
       directories you <b>chdir()</b>ed to.
