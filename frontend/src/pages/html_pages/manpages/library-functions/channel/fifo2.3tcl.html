       fifo2 - Create and manipulate pipe fifo channels

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       package require <b>Tcl</b>

       package require <b>memchan</b>

       <b>fifo2</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The command described here is only available in a not-yet released version of the package. Use the CVS to
       get the sources.

       <b>fifo2</b>  creates  two  stream-oriented  in-memory channels and returns their handles as a two-element list.
              There is no restriction on the ultimate size of the channels, they will always grow as much as  is
              necessary to accommodate the data written into them.

              In  contrast  to  the  channels  generated  by  <b>fifo</b>  a pair of channels created here is connected
              internally in such a way that data written into one channel can be read from the other.  All  data
              written into them is read in the same order. This also means that the two channels of the pair are
              not seekable.

              The  channels  created here can be transferred between interpreters in the same thread and between
              threads. As both channels in the pair can be transferred independently they can be used to  create
              a bidirectional connection between two interpreters.

       Memory  channels  created  by  <b>fifo2</b>  provide two read-only options which can be queried via the standard
       <b>fconfigure</b> command. These are

       -rlength
              The value of this option is the number of bytes currently available for reading from the channel.

       -wlength
              The value of this option is the number of bytes currently written into the channel.

       Note that the two lengths are switched for the channels of a pair. In other words, the  number  of  bytes
       written for one of the channels is the number of bytes readable from the other end.

       As the channels generated by <b>fifo2</b> grow as necessary they are always writable. This means that a writable
       <b>fileevent</b>-handler will fire continuously.

       The  channels  are  also  readable if they contain more than zero bytes. Under this conditions a readable
       <b>fileevent</b>-handler will fire continuously.
