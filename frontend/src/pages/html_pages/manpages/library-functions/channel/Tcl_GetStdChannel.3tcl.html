       Tcl_GetStdChannel, Tcl_SetStdChannel - procedures for retrieving and replacing the standard channels

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;tcl.h&gt;</b>

       Tcl_Channel
       <b>Tcl_GetStdChannel</b>(<u>type</u>)

       <b>Tcl_SetStdChannel</b>(<u>channel,</u> <u>type</u>)

</pre><h4><b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       int <u>type</u> (in)                     The identifier for the standard channel to retrieve or modify.  Must be
                                         one of <b>TCL_STDIN</b>, <b>TCL_STDOUT</b>, or <b>TCL_STDERR</b>.

       Tcl_Channel <u>channel</u> (in)          The channel to use as the new value for the specified standard channel.
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Tcl defines three special channels that are used by various I/O related commands if no other channels are
       specified.   The  standard  input  channel has a channel name of <b>stdin</b> and is used by <b>read</b> and <b>gets</b>.  The
       standard output channel is named <b>stdout</b> and is used by <b>puts</b>.  The standard error channel is named  <b>stderr</b>
       and  is  used  for  reporting  errors.   In  addition,  the  standard channels are inherited by any child
       processes created using <b>exec</b> or <b>open</b> in the absence of any other redirections.

       The standard channels are actually aliases for other normal channels.   The  current  channel  associated
       with  a standard channel can be retrieved by calling <b>Tcl_GetStdChannel</b> with one of <b>TCL_STDIN</b>, <b>TCL_STDOUT</b>,
       or <b>TCL_STDERR</b> as the <u>type</u>.  The return value will be a valid channel, or NULL.

       A new channel can be set for the standard channel specified by <u>type</u> by calling <b>Tcl_SetStdChannel</b>  with  a
       new  channel  or  NULL  in  the  <u>channel</u> argument.  If the specified channel is closed by a later call to
       <b>Tcl_Close</b>, then the corresponding standard channel will automatically be set to NULL.

       If a non-NULL value for <u>channel</u> is passed to <b>Tcl_SetStdChannel</b>, then that same value should be passed  to
       <b>Tcl_RegisterChannel</b>, like so:

              Tcl_RegisterChannel(NULL, channel);

       This  is  a  workaround for a misfeature in <b>Tcl_SetStdChannel</b> that it fails to do some reference counting
       housekeeping.  This misfeature cannot be corrected without contradicting the assumptions of some existing
       code that calls <b>Tcl_SetStdChannel</b>.

       If <b>Tcl_GetStdChannel</b> is called before <b>Tcl_SetStdChannel</b>, Tcl will construct a new  channel  to  wrap  the
       appropriate   platform-specific   standard   file   handle.    If   <b>Tcl_SetStdChannel</b>  is  called  before
       <b>Tcl_GetStdChannel</b>, then the default channel will not be created.

       If one of the standard channels is set to NULL, either by calling <b>Tcl_SetStdChannel</b> with a  NULL  <u>channel</u>
       argument,  or  by  calling  <b>Tcl_Close</b>  on  the  channel,  then  the  next  call to <b>Tcl_CreateChannel</b> will
       automatically set the standard channel with the newly created channel.  If more than one standard channel
       is NULL, then the standard channels will be assigned starting with standard input, followed  by  standard
       output, with standard error being last.

       See  <b>Tcl_StandardChannels</b>  for  a  general  treatise  about standard channels and the behavior of the Tcl
       library with regard to them.
