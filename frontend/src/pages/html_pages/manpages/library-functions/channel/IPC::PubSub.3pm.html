       IPC::PubSub - Interprocess Publish/Subscribe channels

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           # A new message bus with the DBM::Deep backend
           # (Other possible backends include Memcached and PlainHash)
           my $bus = IPC::PubSub-&gt;new(DBM_Deep =&gt; '/tmp/pubsub.db');

           # A channel is any arbitrary string
           my $channel = '#perl6';

           # Register a new publisher (you can publish to multiple channels)
           my $pub = $bus-&gt;new_publisher("#perl6", "#moose");

           # Publish a message (may be a complex object) to those channels
           $pub-&gt;msg("This is a message");

           # Register a new subscriber (you can subscribe to multiple channels)
           my $sub = $bus-&gt;new_subscriber("#moose");

           # Publish an object to channels
           $pub-&gt;msg("This is another message");

           # Set all subsequent messages from this publisher to expire in 30 seconds
           $pub-&gt;<a href="../man30/expiry.30.html">expiry</a>(30);
           $pub-&gt;msg("This message will go away in 30 seconds");

           # Simple get: Returns the messages sent since the previous get,
           # but only for the first channel.
           my @msgs = $sub-&gt;get;

           # Simple get, with an explicit channel key (must be among the ones
           # it initially subscribed to)
           my @moose_msgs = $sub-&gt;get("#moose");

           # Complex get: Returns a hash reference from channels to array
           # references of [timestamp, message].
           my $hash_ref = $sub-&gt;get_all;

           # Changing the list of channels we subscribe to
           $sub-&gt;subscribe('some-other-channel');
           $sub-&gt;unsubscribe('some-other-channel');

           $bus-&gt;unlock('channel');
           my @timed_msgs = $bus-&gt;fetch('key1', 'key2', 'key3');
           $bus-&gt;store('key', 'value', time, 30);

           # Atomic updating of cache content; $_ is stored back on the
           # end of the callback.
           my $rv = $bus-&gt;modify('key' =&gt; sub { delete $_-&gt;{foo} });

           # Shorthand for $bus-&gt;modify('key' =&gt; sub { $_ = 'val' });
           $bus-&gt;modify('key' =&gt; 'val');

           # Shorthand for $bus-&gt;modify('key' =&gt; sub { $_ });

           $bus-&gt;disconnect;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module provides a simple API for publishing messages to <u>channels</u> and for subscribing to them.

       When a <u>message</u> is published on a channel, all subscribers currently in that channel will get it on their
       next "get" or "get_all" call.

       Currently, it offers four backends: "DBM_Deep" for on-disk storage, "Memcached" for possibly multi-host
       storage, "Jifty::DBI" for database-backed storage, and "PlainHash" for single-process storage.

       Please see the tests in <u>t/</u> for this distribution, as well as "SYNOPSIS" above, for some usage examples;
       detailed documentation is not yet available.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       IPC::DirQueue, where the subscribers divide the published messages among themselves, so different
       subscribers never see the same message.
