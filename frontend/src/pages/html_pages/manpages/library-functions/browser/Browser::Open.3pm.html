</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Browser::Open - open a browser in a given URL

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 0.03

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Browser::Open qw( open_browser );

           ### Try commands specific to the current Operating System
           my $ok = open_browser($url);
           # ! defined($ok): no recognized command found
           # $ok == 0: command found and executed
           # $ok != 0: command found, error while executing

           ### Try all known commands
           my $ok = open_browser($url, 1);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The functions optionaly exported by this module allows you to open URLs in the user browser.

       A set of known commands per OS-name is tested for presence, and the first one found is executed. With an
       optional parameter, all known commands are checked.

       The "open_browser" uses the system() function to execute the command. If you want more control, you can
       get the command with the "open_browser_cmd" or "open_browser_cmd_all" functions and then use whatever
       method you want to execute it.

</pre><h4><b>API</b></h4><pre>
       All functions are <b>not</b> exported by default. You must ask for them explicitly.

   <b>open_browser</b>
           my $ok = open_browser($url, $all);

       Find an appropriate command and executes it with your $url. If $all is false, the default, only commands
       that match the current OS will be tested. If true, all known commands will be tested.

       If no command was found, returns "undef".

       If a command is found, returns the exit code of the execution attempt, 0 for success. See the system()
       for more information about this exit code.

       If no $url is given, an exception will be thrown: "Missing required parameter $url".

   <b>open_browser_cmd</b>
           my $cmd = open_browser_cmd();

       Returns the best command found to open a URL on your system.

       If no command was found, returns "undef".

   <b>open_browser_cmd_all</b>
           my $cmd = open_browser_cmd_all();

       Returns the first command found to open a URL.

       If no command was found, returns "undef".
