</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Minion::Command::minion::worker starts a Minion worker. You can have as many workers as you like.

</pre><h4><b>WORKER</b> <b>SIGNALS</b></h4><pre>
       The Minion::Command::minion::worker process can be controlled at runtime with the following signals.

   <b>INT,</b> <b>TERM</b>
       Stop gracefully after finishing the current jobs.

   <b>QUIT</b>
       Stop immediately without finishing the current jobs.

</pre><h4><b>JOB</b> <b>SIGNALS</b></h4><pre>
       The job processes spawned by the Minion::Command::minion::worker process can be controlled at runtime
       with the following signals.

   <b>INT,</b> <b>TERM</b>
       This signal starts out with the operating system default and allows for jobs to install a custom signal
       handler to stop gracefully.

   <b>USR1,</b> <b>USR2</b>
       These signals start out being ignored and allow for jobs to install custom signal handlers.

</pre><h4><b>REMOTE</b> <b>CONTROL</b> <b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       The Minion::Command::minion::worker process can be controlled at runtime through
       Minion::Command::minion::job, from anywhere in the network, by broadcasting the following remote control
       commands.

   <b>jobs</b>
         $ ./myapp.pl minion job -b jobs -a '[10]'
         $ ./myapp.pl minion job -b jobs -a '[10]' 23

       Instruct one or more workers to change the number of jobs to perform concurrently. Setting this value to
       0 will effectively pause the worker. That means all current jobs will be finished, but no new ones
       accepted, until the number is increased again.

   <b>kill</b>
         $ ./myapp.pl minion job -b kill -a '["INT", 10025]'
         $ ./myapp.pl minion job -b kill -a '["INT", 10025]' 23

       Instruct one or more workers to send a signal to a job that is currently being performed. This command
       will be ignored by workers that do not have a job matching the id. That means it is safe to broadcast
       this command to all workers.

   <b>stop</b>
         $ ./myapp.pl minion job -b stop -a '[10025]'
         $ ./myapp.pl minion job -b stop -a '[10025]' 23

       Instruct one or more workers to stop a job that is currently being performed immediately. This command
       will be ignored by workers that do not have a job matching the id. That means it is safe to broadcast
       this command to all workers.

</pre><h4><b>ATTRIBUTES</b></h4><pre>

       following new ones.

         $worker         = $worker-&gt;description('Foo');

       Short description of this command, used for the command list.

   <b>usage</b>
         my $usage = $worker-&gt;usage;
         $worker   = $worker-&gt;usage('Foo');

       Usage information for this command, used for the help screen.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       Minion::Command::minion::worker inherits all methods from Mojolicious::Command and implements the
       following new ones.

   <b>run</b>
