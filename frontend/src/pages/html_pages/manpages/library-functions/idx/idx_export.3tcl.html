</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  package  provides a class to manage the plugins for the export of keyword indices to other formats,
       i.e. their conversion to, for example <u>docidx</u>, <u>HTML</u>, etc.

       This is one of the three public pillars the management of keyword  indices  resides  on.  The  other  two
       pillars are

       [1]    <u>Importing</u> <u>keyword</u> <u>indices</u>, and

       [2]    <u>Holding</u> <u>keyword</u> <u>indices</u>

       For  information about the <b>Concepts</b> of keyword indices, and their parts, see the same-named section.  For
       information about the data structure which is the major input to the manager  objects  provided  by  this
       package see the section <b>Keyword</b> <b>index</b> <b>serialization</b> <b>format</b>.

       The  plugin  system  of  our  class is based on the package <b>pluginmgr</b>, and configured to look for plugins
       using

       [1]    the environment variable <b>DOCTOOLS_IDX_EXPORT_PLUGINS</b>,

       [2]    the environment variable <b>DOCTOOLS_IDX_PLUGINS</b>,

       [3]    the environment variable <b>DOCTOOLS_PLUGINS</b>,

       [4]    the path "<u><a href="file:~/.doctools/idx/export/plugin">~/.doctools/idx/export/plugin</a></u>"

       [5]    the path "<u><a href="file:~/.doctools/idx/plugin">~/.doctools/idx/plugin</a></u>"

       [6]    the path "<u><a href="file:~/.doctools/plugin">~/.doctools/plugin</a></u>"

       [7]    the path "<u><a href="file:~/.doctools/idx/export/plugins">~/.doctools/idx/export/plugins</a></u>"

       [8]    the path "<u><a href="file:~/.doctools/idx/plugins">~/.doctools/idx/plugins</a></u>"

       [9]    the path "<u><a href="file:~/.doctools/plugins">~/.doctools/plugins</a></u>"

       [10]   the registry entry "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\DOCTOOLS\IDX\EXPORT\PLUGINS"

       [11]   the registry entry "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\DOCTOOLS\IDX\PLUGINS"

       [12]   the registry entry "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\DOCTOOLS\PLUGINS"

       The last three are used only when the package is run on a machine using Windows(tm) operating system.

       The whole system is delivered with six predefined export plugins, namely

       docidx See <u>docidx</u> <u>export</u> <u>plugin</u> for details.

       html   See <u>html</u> <u>export</u> <u>plugin</u> for details.

       json   See <u>json</u> <u>export</u> <u>plugin</u> for details.

       nroff  See <u>nroff</u> <u>export</u> <u>plugin</u> for details.

       text   See <u>text</u> <u>export</u> <u>plugin</u> for details.

       wiki   See <u>wiki</u> <u>export</u> <u>plugin</u> for details.

       Readers wishing to write their own export plugin for  some  format,  i.e.   <u>plugin</u>  <u>writer</u>s  reading  and
       understanding  the  section containing the <b>Export</b> <b>plugin</b> <b>API</b> <b>v2</b> <b>reference</b> is an absolute necessity, as it
       specifies the interaction between this package and its plugins in detail.

</pre><h4><b>CONCEPTS</b></h4><pre>
       [1]    A <u>keyword</u> <u>index</u> consists of a (possibly empty) set of <u>keywords</u>.

       [2]    Each keyword in the set is identified by its name.

       [3]    Each keyword has a (possibly empty) set of <u>references</u>.

       [4]    A reference can be associated with more than one keyword.

       [5]    A reference not associated with at least one keyword is not possible however.

       [6]    Each reference is identified by its target, specified as  either  an  url  or  symbolic  filename,
              depending on the type of reference (<b>url</b>, or <b>manpage</b>).

       [7]    The  type  of  a  reference  (url,  or  manpage) depends only on the reference itself, and not the
              keywords it is associated with.

       [8]    In addition to a type each reference has a descriptive label as well. This label depends  only  on
              the reference itself, and not the keywords it is associated with.

       A few notes

       [1]    Manpage  references are intended to be used for references to the documents the index is made for.
              Their target is a symbolic file name identifying the document,  and  export  plugins  may  replace
              symbolic with actual file names, if specified.

       [2]    Url  references  are intended on the othre hand are inteded to be used for links to anything else,
              like websites. Their target is an url.

       [3]    While url and manpage references share a namespace  for  their  identifiers,  this  should  be  no
              problem,  given that manpage identifiers are symbolic filenames and as such they should never look
              like urls, the identifiers for url references.

</pre><h4><b>API</b></h4><pre>
   <b>PACKAGE</b> <b>COMMANDS</b>
       <b>::doctools::idx::export</b> <u>objectName</u>
              This command creates a new export manager object with an associated  Tcl  command  whose  name  is
              <u>objectName</u>.  This  <u>object</u>  command  is explained in full detail in the sections <b>Object</b> <b>command</b> and
              <b>Object</b> <b>methods</b>. The object command will be created under the current namespace if  the  <u>objectName</u>
              is not fully qualified, and in the specified namespace otherwise.

   <b>OBJECT</b> <b>COMMAND</b>
       All objects created by the <b>::doctools::idx::export</b> command have the following general form:

       <b>objectName</b> <b>method</b> ?<u>arg</u> <u>arg</u> <u>...</u>?
              The  method  <b>method</b>  and  its <u>arg</u>'uments determine the exact behavior of the command.  See section
              <b>Object</b> <b>methods</b> for the detailed specifications.

   <b>OBJECT</b> <b>METHODS</b>
       <u>objectName</u> <b>destroy</b>
              This method destroys the object it is invoked for.

       <u>objectName</u> <b>export</b> <b>serial</b> <u>serial</u> ?<u>format</u>?
              This method takes the canonical serialization of a keyword index stored in <u>serial</u> and converts  it
              to  the  specified <u>format</u>, using the export plugin for the format. An error is thrown if no plugin
              could be found for the format.  The string generated by the conversion process is returned as  the
              result of this method.

              If no format is specified the method defaults to <b>docidx</b>.

              The  specification  of what a <u>canonical</u> serialization is can be found in the section <b>Keyword</b> <b>index</b>
              <b>serialization</b> <b>format</b>.

              The plugin has to conform to the interface specified in section <b>Export</b> <b>plugin</b> <b>API</b> <b>v2</b> <b>reference</b>.

       <u>objectName</u> <b>export</b> <b>object</b> <u>object</u> ?<u>format</u>?
              This method is a convenient wrapper around the <b>export</b> <b>serial</b>  method  described  by  the  previous
              item.   It  expects  that  <u>object</u> is an object command supporting a <b>serialize</b> method returning the
              canonical serialization of a keyword index. It invokes that method, feeds the result  into  <b>export</b>
              <b>serial</b> and returns the resulting string as its own result.

       <u>objectName</u> <b>config</b> <b>names</b>
              This  method returns a list containing the names of all configuration variables currently known to
              the object.

       <u>objectName</u> <b>config</b> <b>get</b>
              This method returns a dictionary containing the names and values of  all  configuration  variables
              currently known to the object.

       <u>objectName</u> <b>config</b> <b>set</b> <u>name</u> ?<u>value</u>?
              This  method sets the configuration variable <u>name</u> to the specified <u>value</u> and returns the new value
              of the variable.

              If no value is specified it simply returns the current value, without changing it.

              Note that while the user can set the predefined configuration variables <b>user</b> and <b>format</b>  doing  so
              will have no effect, these values will be internally overridden when invoking an import plugin.

       <u>objectName</u> <b>config</b> <b>unset</b> <u>pattern</u>...
              This method unsets all configuration variables matching the specified glob <u>pattern</u>s. If no pattern
              is specified it will unset all currently defined configuration variables.

</pre><h4><b>EXPORT</b> <b>PLUGIN</b> <b>API</b> <b>V2</b> <b>REFERENCE</b></h4><pre>
       Plugins  are  what this package uses to manage the support for any output format beyond the <b>Keyword</b> <b>index</b>
       <b>serialization</b> <b>format</b>. Here we specify the API the objects created by this package use  to  interact  with
       their plugins.

       A plugin for this package has to follow the rules listed below:

       [1]    A plugin is a package.

       [2]    The name of a plugin package has the form doctools::idx::export::<b>FOO</b>, where <b>FOO</b> is the name of the
              format  the  plugin  will  generate  output  for. This name is also the argument to provide to the
              various <b>export</b> methods of export manager objects to get a string encoding a keyword index in  that
              format.

       [3]    The plugin can expect that the package <b>doctools::idx::export::plugin</b> is present, as indicator that
              it was invoked from a genuine plugin manager.

       [4]    A plugin has to provide one command, with the signature shown below.

              <b>export</b> <u>serial</u> <u>configuration</u>
                     Whenever  an  export  manager  of <b>doctools::idx</b> has to generate output for an index it will
                     invoke this command.

                     string <u>serial</u>
                            This argument will contain the <u>canonical</u> serialization of the  index  for  which  to
                            generate  the output.  The specification of what a <u>canonical</u> serialization is can be
                            found in the section <b>Keyword</b> <b>index</b> <b>serialization</b> <b>format</b>.

                     dictionary <u>configuration</u>
                            This argument will contain the current configuration to apply to the generation,  as
                            a dictionary mapping from variable names to values.

                            The  following configuration variables have a predefined meaning all plugins have to
                            obey, although they can ignore this information at their discretion. Any other other
                            configuration variables recognized by a plugin will be described in the manpage  for
                            that plugin.

                            user   This  variable is expected to contain the name of the user owning the process
                                   invoking the plugin.

                            format This variable is expected to contain the name of the format whose  plugin  is
                                   invoked.

                            file   This  variable,  if  defined  by  the user of the index object is expected to
                                   contain the name of the input file for which the  plugin  is  generating  its
                                   output for.

                            map    This  variable,  if  defined  by  the user of the index object is expected to
                                   contain a dictionary mapping from symbolic file names used in the  references
                                   of  type <b>manpage</b> to actual paths (or urls). A plugin has to be able to handle
                                   the possibility that a symbolic name is without entry in this mapping.

       [5]    A single usage cycle of a plugin consists of the invokations of the command <b>export</b>. This call  has
              to leave the plugin in a state where another usage cycle can be run without problems.

</pre><h4><b>KEYWORD</b> <b>INDEX</b> <b>SERIALIZATION</b> <b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
       Here  we  specify  the  format used by the doctools v2 packages to serialize keyword indices as immutable
       values for transport, comparison, etc.

       We distinguish between <u>regular</u> and <u>canonical</u> serializations. While a keyword index may have more than one
       regular serialization only exactly one of them will be <u>canonical</u>.

       regular serialization

              [1]    An index serialization is a nested Tcl dictionary.

              [2]    This dictionary holds a single key, <b>doctools::idx</b>, and its  value.  This  value  holds  the
                     contents of the index.

              [3]    The contents of the index are a Tcl dictionary holding the title of the index, a label, and
                     the keywords and references. The relevant keys and their values are

                     <b>title</b>  The value is a string containing the title of the index.

                     <b>label</b>  The value is a string containing a label for the index.

                     <b>keywords</b>
                            The  value  is  a Tcl dictionary, using the keywords known to the index as keys. The
                            associated values are lists containing the identifiers of the references  associated
                            with that particular keyword.

                            Any reference identifier used in these lists has to exist as a key in the <b>references</b>
                            dictionary, see the next item for its definition.

                     <b>references</b>
                            The value is a Tcl dictionary, using the identifiers for the references known to the
                            index  as  keys.  The  associated values are 2-element lists containing the type and
                            label of the reference, in this order.

                            Any key here has to be associated with at least one keyword, i.e. occur in at  least
                            one  of  the  reference  lists  which are the values in the <b>keywords</b> dictionary, see
                            previous item for its definition.

              [4]    The <u>type</u> of a reference can be one of two values,

                     <b>manpage</b>
                            The identifier of the reference is interpreted as symbolic file name,  referring  to
                            one of the documents the index was made for.

                     <b>url</b>    The identifier of the reference is interpreted as an url, referring to some external
                            location, like a website, etc.

       canonical serialization
              The  canonical  serialization of a keyword index has the format as specified in the previous item,
              and then additionally satisfies the constraints below, which make it unique among all the possible
              serializations of the keyword index.

              [1]    The keys found in all the nested Tcl dictionaries are sorted in ascending dictionary order,
                     as generated by Tcl's builtin command <b>lsort</b> <b>-increasing</b> <b>-dict</b>.

              [2]    The references listed for each keyword of the  index,  if  any,  are  listed  in  ascending
                     dictionary  order  of their <u>labels</u>, as generated by Tcl's builtin command <b>lsort</b> <b>-increasing</b>
                     <b>-dict</b>.
