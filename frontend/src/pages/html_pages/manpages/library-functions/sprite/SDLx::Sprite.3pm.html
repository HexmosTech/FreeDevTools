       SDLx::Sprite - interact with images quick and easily in SDL

</pre><h4><b>CATEGORY</b></h4><pre>
       Extension

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use SDLx::Sprite;

           my $sprite = SDLx::Sprite-&gt;new;

           # loads image file into a SDL::Surface and
           # automatically sets a SDL::Rect inside with
           # that image's dimensions.
           $sprite-&gt;load('hero.png');

           # set sprite image transparency
           $sprite-&gt;alpha_key( $color );
           $sprite-&gt;alpha(0.5);

           # you can set and check the sprite position anytime
           say $sprite-&gt;x;   # rect-&gt;x shortcut accessor
           $sprite-&gt;<a href="../man30/y.30.html">y</a>(30);   # rect-&gt;y shortcut accessor

           # read-only surface dimensions
           $sprite-&gt;w;   # width
           $sprite-&gt;h;   # height

           # you can also fetch the full rect
           # (think destination coordinates for -&gt;draw)
           my $rect = $sprite-&gt;rect;

           # you can get the surface object too if you need it
           my $surface = $sprite-&gt;surface;

           # rotation()

           # if your SDL has gfx, rotation is also straightforward:
           $sprite-&gt;rotation( $degrees );
           $sprite-&gt;rotation( $degrees, $smooth );

           # add() / remove() NOT YET IMPLEMENTED
           # you can also attach other sprites to it
           $sprite-&gt;add( armor =&gt; $other_sprite );
           $sprite-&gt;remove('armor');

           # blits $sprite (and attached sprites) into $screen,
           # in the (x,y) coordinates of the sprite
           $sprite-&gt;draw($screen);

           # if you need to clip the original image/surface
           # before drawing it
           $sprite-&gt;clip-&gt;<a href="../man10/x.10.html">x</a>(10);
           $sprite-&gt;clip-&gt;<a href="../man3/y.3.html">y</a>(3);
           $sprite-&gt;clip-&gt;<a href="../man5/w.5.html">w</a>(5);
           $sprite-&gt;clip-&gt;<a href="../man5/h.5.html">h</a>(5);

           # ...or all at once:
           $sprite-&gt;clip($x,$y,$w,$h);

           # spawning can include almost all of the above:
           my $sprite = SDLx::Sprite-&gt;new(
                     image   =&gt; 'hero.png',   # or surface =&gt; SDL::Surface
                     rect    =&gt; SDL::Rect,    # or x =&gt; $x, y =&gt; $y
                     clip    =&gt; SDL::Rect,
                     alpha_key =&gt; SDL::Color, # or [$r, $g, $b]
                     alpha     =&gt; 1,
                     rotation  =&gt; 45, # degrees
                );

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       SDLx::Sprite is a SDL::Surface on steroids! It let's you quickly load, setup and interact with images in
       your SDL application, abstracting all the drudge code and letting you concentrate on your app's logic
       instead.

       This module automatically creates and holds SDL::Rect objects for the source and destination surfaces,
       and provides several surface manipulation options like alpha blending and rotation.

</pre><h4><b>WARNING!</b> <b>VOLATILE</b> <b>CODE</b> <b>AHEAD</b></h4><pre>
       This is a new module and the API is subject to change without notice.  If you care, please join the
       discussion on the #sdl IRC channel in <u>irc.perl.org</u>. All thoughts on further improving the API are
       welcome.

       You have been warned :)

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>new</b>
   <b>new(</b> <b>%options</b> <b>)</b>
       Creates a new SDLx::Sprite object. No option is mandatory.  Available options are:

       •   image =&gt; $filename

           Uses  $filename  as  source image for the Sprite's surface. See supported formats in SDL::Image. This
           option <b>cannot</b> be used together with the 'surface' option (see below).

       •   surface =&gt; SDL::Surface

           Uses the provided SDL::Surface object as source surface for this  sprite,  instead  of  creating  one
           automatically. This option <b>cannot</b> be used together with the 'image' option (see above).

       •   clip =&gt; SDL::Rect

           Uses  the  provided  SDL::Rect  object as clipping rect for the source surface. This means the object
           will only blit that particular area from the surface.

       •   rect =&gt; SDL::Rect

           Uses the provided SDL::Rect object as destination coordinates to whatever surface you call <b>draw()</b> on.
           You <b>cannot</b> use this option together with 'x' and 'y' (see below)

       •   x =&gt; $x

           Uses $x as the  x-axis  (left-to-right,  0  being  leftmost)  positioning  of  the  Sprite  into  the
           destination you call <b>draw()</b> upon. This option <b>cannot</b> be used together with 'rect' (see above).

       •   y =&gt; $y

           Uses $y as the y-axis (top-to-bottom, 0 being topmost) positioning of the Sprite into the destination
           you call <b>draw()</b> upon. This option <b>cannot</b> be used together with 'rect' (see above).

       •   draw_xy =&gt; $surface, $x, $y

           A shortcut to draw at coordinates quickly. Calls x() , y() and <b>draw()</b>

       •   rotation =&gt; $degrees, [$smooth]

           Uses $degrees as the angle to rotate the surface to, in degrees (0..360, remember? :). This option is
           only available if your compiled SDL library has support for GFX (see Alien::SDL for details).

           if $smooth is set the sprite is antialiased. This may mess with your alpha_key.

       •   alpha_key =&gt; SDL::Color

           MUST CALL SDL::Video::get_video_mode prior to this.

           Uses  the  provided  SDL::Color object (or an array reference with red, green and blue values) as the
           color to be turned into transparent (see 'alpha' below).

       •   alpha =&gt; $percentage or $integer

           Uses $percentage (0 &lt;-&gt; 1 ) or $integer ( 0x01 - 0xff)  as  how  much  transparency  to  add  to  the
           surface. If you use this, it is mandatory that you also provide the alpha_key (see above).

   <b>load(</b> <b>$filename</b> <b>)</b>
       Loads  the  given  image  file  into  the  object's internal surface. A new surface is <b>always</b> created, so
       whatever you had on the previous surface will be lost. Croaks on errors such as no support built for  the
       image or a file reading error (the error message is SDL::get_error and should give more details).

       Returns the own Sprite object, to allow method chaining.

   <b>surface()</b>
   <b>surface(</b> <b>SDL::Surface</b> <b>)</b>
       Returns the object's internal surface, or undef if there is none.

       If you pass a SDL::Surface to it, it will overwrite the original surface with it, while returning the <b>old</b>
       (previous)  surface.  Note  that, as such, it will return "undef" if you use it without having previously
       loaded either an image or a previous surface. It will Carp::confess if you pass anything  that's  not  an
       SDL::Surface object (or SDL::Surface subclassed objects).

   <b>rect()</b>
   <b>rect(</b> <b>SDL::Rect</b> <b>)</b>
       Returns the destination SDL::Rect object used when you call <b>draw()</b>.

       If  you  haven't  explicitly  set  it,  it  will  be a SDL::Rect with the same dimensions as the object's
       internal surface. If no surface was set yet, it will be an empty SDL::Rect (dimensions 0,0,0,0).

       If you pass it a SDL::Rect object, it will set <b>rect()</b> to  that  object  before  returning,  but  it  will
       <b>overwrite</b>  any  width  and  height  values,  as those are read only and set to the size of the underlying
       surface.

       If you want to clip the source surface, set <b>clip()</b> instead.

   <b>clip()</b>
   <b>clip(</b> <b>SDL::Rect</b> <b>)</b>
       Returns the source SDL::Rect object used when you call <b>draw()</b>.

       You can use this method to choose only a small subset of the object's internal  surface  to  be  used  on
       calls to <b>draw()</b>.

       If  you  haven't  explicitly  set  it,  it  will  be a SDL::Rect with the same dimensions as the object's
       internal surface. If no surface was set yet, it will be an empty SDL::Rect (dimensions 0,0,0,0).

       If you pass it a SDL::Rect object, it will set <b>clip()</b> to that object before returning.

   <b>x()</b>
   <b>x(</b> <b>$int</b> <b>)</b>
       Gets/sets the x-axis (left-to-right, 0 being leftmost) positioning of the Sprite into the destination you
       call <b>draw()</b> upon.

       It is a shortcut to "$sprite-&gt;rect-&gt;x".

   <b>y()</b>
   <b>y(</b> <b>$int</b> <b>)</b>
       Gets/sets the y-axis (top-to-bottom, 0 being topmost) positioning of the Sprite into the destination  you
       call <b>draw()</b> upon.

       It is a shortcut to "$sprite-&gt;rect-&gt;y".

   <b>w()</b>
       Returns the Sprite surface's width. This method is read-only.

       It is a shortcut to "$sprite-&gt;surface-&gt;w".

   <b>h()</b>
       Returns the Sprite surface's height. This method is read-only.

       It is a shortcut to "$sprite-&gt;surface-&gt;h".

   <b>draw(</b> <b>SDL::Surface</b> <b>)</b>
       Draws  the  Sprite  on the provided SDL::Surface object - usually the screen - using the blit_surface SDL
       function, using the source rect from <b>clip()</b> and the destination rect (position) from <b>rect()</b>.

       Returns the own Sprite object, to allow method chaining.
