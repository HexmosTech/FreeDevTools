</pre><h4><b>WIDGET-SPECIFIC</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Command-Line Name:<b>-command</b>
       Database Name:  <b>command</b>
       Database Class: <b>Command</b>

              Specifies  a  Tcl  command  to  associate with the button.  This command is typically invoked when
              mouse button 1 is released over the button window.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-default</b>
       Database Name:  <b>default</b>
       Database Class: <b>Default</b>

              Specifies one of three states for the default ring: <b>normal</b>, <b>active</b>, or <b>disabled</b>.  In active state,
              the button is drawn with the platform specific appearance for a default button.  In normal  state,
              the button is drawn with the platform specific appearance for a non-default button, leaving enough
              space  to draw the default button appearance.  The normal and active states will result in buttons
              of the same size.  In disabled state, the button is drawn with the non-default  button  appearance
              without  leaving  space  for  the  default appearance.  The disabled state may result in a smaller
              button than the active state.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-height</b>
       Database Name:  <b>height</b>
       Database Class: <b>Height</b>

              Specifies a desired height for the button.  If an image or bitmap is being displayed in the button
              then the value is in screen units (i.e. any of the forms acceptable to <b>Tk_GetPixels</b>); for text  it
              is  in  lines  of  text.  If this option is not specified, the button's desired height is computed
              from the size of the image or bitmap or text being displayed in it.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-overrelief</b>
       Database Name:  <b>overRelief</b>
       Database Class: <b>OverRelief</b>

              Specifies an alternative relief for the button, to be used when  the  mouse  cursor  is  over  the
              widget.   This option can be used to make toolbar buttons, by configuring <b>-relief</b> <b>flat</b> <b>-overrelief</b>
              <b>raised</b>.  If the value of this option is the empty string, then no alternative relief is used  when
              the mouse cursor is over the button.  The empty string is the default value.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-state</b>
       Database Name:  <b>state</b>
       Database Class: <b>State</b>

              Specifies  one  of three states for the button:  <b>normal</b>, <b>active</b>, or <b>disabled</b>.  In normal state the
              button is displayed using the <b>-foreground</b> and <b>-background</b> options.  The active state is  typically
              used  when  the  pointer  is  over  the button.  In active state the button is displayed using the
              <b>-activeforeground</b> and <b>-activebackground</b> options.  Disabled state means that the button  should  be
              insensitive:  the default bindings will refuse to activate the widget and will ignore mouse button
              presses.   In  this state the <b>-disabledforeground</b> and <b>-background</b> options determine how the button
              is displayed.

       Command-Line Name:<b>-width</b>
       Database Name:  <b>width</b>
       Database Class: <b>Width</b>

              Specifies a desired width for the button.  If an image or bitmap is being displayed in the  button
              then  the value is in screen units (i.e. any of the forms acceptable to <b>Tk_GetPixels</b>).  For a text
              button (no image or with <b>-compound</b> <b>none</b>) then the width specifies how much space in characters  to
              allocate  for  the  text label.  If the width is negative then this specifies a minimum width.  If
              this option is not specified, the button's desired width is computed from the size of the image or
              bitmap or text being displayed in it.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>button</b> command creates a new window (given by the <u>pathName</u> argument)  and  makes  it  into  a  button
       widget.   Additional  options,  described  above,  may  be specified on the command line or in the option
       database to configure aspects of the button such as its colors, font,  text,  and  initial  relief.   The
       <b>button</b>  command returns its <u>pathName</u> argument.  At the time this command is invoked, there must not exist
       a window named <u>pathName</u>, but <u>pathName</u>'s parent must exist.

       A button is a widget that displays a textual string, bitmap or image.  If text is displayed, it must  all
       be  in  a  single  font,  but  it  can occupy multiple lines on the screen (if it contains newlines or if
       wrapping occurs because of the <b>-wraplength</b> option) and one of the characters may optionally be underlined
       using the <b>-underline</b> option.  It can display itself in either of three different ways, according  to  the
       <b>-state</b>  option;  it  can  be made to appear raised, sunken, or flat; and it can be made to flash.  When a
       user invokes the button (by pressing mouse button 1 with the  cursor  over  the  button),  then  the  Tcl
       command specified in the <b>-command</b> option is invoked.

</pre><h4><b>WIDGET</b> <b>COMMAND</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>button</b> command creates a new Tcl command whose name is <u>pathName</u>.  This command may be used to invoke
       various operations on the widget.  It has the following general form:
              <u>pathName</u> <u>option</u> ?<u>arg</u> <u>...</u>?
       <u>Option</u> and the <u>arg</u>s determine the exact behavior of the command.  The following commands are possible for
       button widgets:

       <u>pathName</u> <b>cget</b> <u>option</u>
              Returns the current value of the configuration option given by <u>option</u>.  <u>Option</u> may have any of the
              values accepted by the <b>button</b> command.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>configure</b> ?<u>option</u>? ?<u>value</u> <u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>...</u>?
              Query or modify the configuration options of the widget.  If no <u>option</u>  is  specified,  returns  a
              list describing all of the available options for <u>pathName</u> (see <b>Tk_ConfigureInfo</b> for information on
              the  format  of this list).  If <u>option</u> is specified with no <u>value</u>, then the command returns a list
              describing the one named option (this list will be identical to the corresponding sublist  of  the
              value  returned if no <u>option</u> is specified).  If one or more <u>option-value</u> pairs are specified, then
              the command modifies the given widget option(s) to have the given  value(s);   in  this  case  the
              command  returns  an  empty  string.   <u>Option</u>  may  have  any of the values accepted by the <b>button</b>
              command.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>flash</b>
              Flash the button.  This is accomplished by redisplaying  the  button  several  times,  alternating
              between the configured activebackground and background colors.  At the end of the flash the button
              is  left in the same normal/active state as when the command was invoked.  This command is ignored
              if the button's state is <b>disabled</b>.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>invoke</b>
              Invoke the Tcl command associated with the button, if there is  one.   The  return  value  is  the
              return  value  from the Tcl command, or an empty string if there is no command associated with the
              button.  This command is ignored if the button's state is <b>disabled</b>.

</pre><h4><b>DEFAULT</b> <b>BINDINGS</b></h4><pre>
       Tk automatically creates class bindings for buttons that give them default behavior:

       [1]    A button activates whenever the mouse passes over it and deactivates whenever the mouse leaves the
              button.  Under Windows, this binding is only active when mouse button 1 has been pressed over  the
              button.

       [2]    A button's relief is changed to sunken whenever mouse button 1 is pressed over the button, and the
              relief is restored to its original value when button 1 is later released.

       [3]    If  mouse  button  1  is  pressed  over a button and later released over the button, the button is
              invoked.  However, if the mouse is not over  the  button  when  button  1  is  released,  then  no
              invocation occurs.

       [4]    When a button has the input focus, the space key causes the button to be invoked.

       If  the  button's  state is <b>disabled</b> then none of the above actions occur:  the button is completely non-
       responsive.

       The behavior of buttons can be changed by defining new bindings for individual widgets or  by  redefining
       the class bindings.

</pre><h4><b>PLATFORM</b> <b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       On  Aqua/macOS,  some  configuration options are ignored for the purpose of drawing of the widget because
       they would otherwise conflict with platform guidelines. The <b>configure</b>  and  <b>cget</b>  subcommands  can  still
       manipulate  the  values,  but  do not cause any variation to the look of the widget. The options affected
       notably include <b>-background</b> and <b>-relief</b>.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       This is the classic Tk “Hello, World!”  demonstration:

              <b>button</b> .b -text "Hello, World!" -command exit
              pack .b

       This example demonstrates how to handle button accelerators:

              <b>button</b> .b1 -text Hello -underline 0
              <b>button</b> .b2 -text World -underline 0
              bind . &lt;Key-h&gt; {.b1 flash; .b1 invoke}
              bind . &lt;Key-w&gt; {.b2 flash; .b2 invoke}
              pack .b1 .b2
