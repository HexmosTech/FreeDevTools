</pre><h4><b>WIDGET-SPECIFIC</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Name:     <b>command</b>
       Class:    <b>Command</b>
       Switch:   <b>-command</b>
           Specifies  a  Perl/Tk  callback to associate with the button.  This command is typically invoked when
           mouse button 1 is released over the button window.

       Command-Line Name: <b>-compound</b>
       Database Name:  <b>compound</b>
       Database Class: <b>Compound</b>
           Specifies whether the button should display both an image and text, and if so, where the image should
           be placed relative to the text.  Valid values for this option are <b>bottom</b>, <b>center</b>, <b>left</b>,  <b>none</b>,  <b>right</b>
           and  <b>top</b>.   The  default value is <b>none</b>, meaning that the button will display either an image or text,
           depending on the values of the -image and -bitmap options.

       Name:     <b>default</b>
       Class:    <b>Default</b>
       Switch:   <b>-default</b>
           Specifies one of three states for the default ring: <b>normal</b>, <b>active</b>, or <b>disabled</b>.   In  active  state,
           the button is drawn with the platform specific appearance for a default button.  In normal state, the
           button  is drawn with the platform specific appearance for a non-default button, leaving enough space
           to draw the default button appearance.  The normal and active states will result in  buttons  of  the
           same  size.   In  disabled  state, the button is drawn with the non-default button appearance without
           leaving space for the default appearance.  The disabled state may result in a smaller button than the
           active state.  ring.

       Name:     <b>height</b>
       Class:    <b>Height</b>
       Switch:   <b>-height</b>
           Specifies a desired height for the button.  If an image or bitmap is being displayed  in  the  button
           then  the value is in screen units (i.e. any of the forms acceptable to <b>Tk_GetPixels</b>); for text it is
           in lines of text.  If this option isn't specified, the button's desired height is computed  from  the
           size of the image or bitmap or text being displayed in it.

       Command-Line Name: <b>-overrelief</b>
       Database Name:  <b>overRelief</b>
       Database Class: <b>OverRelief</b>
           Specifies  an alternative relief for the button, to be used when the mouse cursor is over the widget.
           This  option  can be used to make  toolbar  buttons,  by configuring <b>-relief</b> <b>flat</b> <b>-overrelief</b> <b>raised</b>.
           If the value of this option is the empty  string,  then no  alternative relief is used when the mouse
           cursor is over the button.  The empty string is the default value.

       Name:     <b>state</b>
       Class:    <b>State</b>
       Switch:   <b>-state</b>
           Specifies one of three states for the button:  <b>normal</b>, <b>active</b>, or  <b>disabled</b>.   In  normal  state  the
           button  is displayed using the <b>foreground</b> and <b>background</b> options.  The active state is typically used
           when the  pointer  is  over  the  button.   In  active  state  the  button  is  displayed  using  the
           <b>activeForeground</b>  and  <b>activeBackground</b>  options.   Disabled  state  means  that the button should be
           insensitive:  the default bindings will refuse to activate the widget and will  ignore  mouse  button
           presses.   In  this  state  the <b>disabledForeground</b> and <b>background</b> options determine how the button is
           displayed.

       Name:     <b>width</b>
       Class:    <b>Width</b>
       Switch:   <b>-width</b>
           Specifies a desired width for the button.  If an image or bitmap is being  displayed  in  the  button
           then  the value is in screen units (i.e. any of the forms acceptable to <b>Tk_GetPixels</b>); for text it is
           in characters.  If this option isn't specified, the button's desired width is computed from the  size
           of the image or bitmap or text being displayed in it.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>Button</b> method creates a new window (given by the $widget argument) and makes it into a button widget.
       Additional  options,  described  above, may be specified on the command line or in the option database to
       configure aspects of the button such as its colors, font, text, and initial relief.  The  <b>button</b>  command
       returns  its  $widget argument.  At the time this command is invoked, there must not exist a window named
       $widget, but $widget's parent must exist.

       A button is a widget that displays a textual string, bitmap or image.  If text is displayed, it must  all
       be  in  a  single  font,  but  it  can occupy multiple lines on the screen (if it contains newlines or if
       wrapping occurs because of the <b>-wraplength</b> option) and one of the characters may optionally be underlined
       using the <b>-underline</b> option.  It can display itself in either of three different ways, according  to  the
       <b>-state</b>  option;  it  can  be made to appear raised, sunken, or flat; and it can be made to flash.  When a
       user invokes the button (by pressing mouse button 1 with the cursor over the button),  then  the  perl/Tk
       callback specified in the <b>-command</b> option is invoked.

</pre><h4><b>WIDGET</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>Button</b> method creates a widget object.  This object supports the <b>configure</b> and <b>cget</b> methods described
       in  Tk::options  which  can  be  used to enquire and modify the options described above.  The widget also
       inherits all the methods provided by the generic Tk::Widget class.

       The following additional methods are available for button widgets:

       <u>$button</u>-&gt;<b>flash</b>
           Flash the button.  This is accomplished by redisplaying the button several times, alternating between
           active and normal colors.  At the end of the flash the button is left in the same normal/active state
           as when the command was invoked.  This command is ignored if the button's state is <b>disabled</b>.

       <u>$button</u>-&gt;<b>invoke</b>
           Invoke the callback associated with the buttons <b>-command</b> option, if there is one.  The  return  value
           is the return value from the callback, or the undefined value if there is no callback associated with
           the button.  This command is ignored if the button's state is <b>disabled</b>.

</pre><h4><b>DEFAULT</b> <b>BINDINGS</b></h4><pre>
       Tk automatically creates class bindings for buttons that give them default behavior:

       [1] A  button  activates  whenever the mouse passes over it and deactivates whenever the mouse leaves the
           button.  Under Windows, this binding is only active when mouse button 1 has  been  pressed  over  the
           button.

       [2] A  button's  relief  is changed to sunken whenever mouse button 1 is pressed over the button, and the
           relief is restored to its original value when button 1 is later released.

       [3] If mouse button 1 is pressed over a button and later released over the button, the button is invoked.
           However, if the mouse is not over the button when button 1 is released, then no invocation occurs.

       [4] When a button has the input focus, the space key causes the button to be invoked.

           If the button's state is <b>disabled</b> then none of the above actions occur:   the  button  is  completely
           non-responsive.

           The  behavior  of  buttons  can  be  changed  by  defining  new bindings for individual widgets or by
           redefining the class bindings.
