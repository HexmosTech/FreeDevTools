</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Device::Cdio::ISO9660::IFS - Class for ISO 9660 Filesystem image reading

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       This encapsulates ISO 9660 Filesystem Image handling. The class is often used in conjunction with
       Device::Cdio::ISO9660.

           use Device::Cdio::ISO9660;
           use Device::Cdio::ISO9660::IFS;

           $iso = Device::Cdio::ISO9660::IFS-&gt;new(-source=&gt;'copying.iso');

           my $id = $iso-&gt;get_application_id();
           $id = $iso-&gt;get_preparer_id();
           $id = $iso-&gt;get_publisher_id();
           $id = $iso-&gt;get_system_id();
           $id = $iso-&gt;get_volume_id();
           $id = $iso-&gt;get_volumeset_id();

           my $path = '/';
           @file_stats = $iso-&gt;readdir($path);
           foreach my $href (@file_stats) {
              printf "%s [LSN %6d] %8d %s %s%s\n",
              $href-&gt;{is_dir} ? "d" : "-",
              $href-&gt;{LSN}, $href-&gt;{size},
              $href-&gt;{tm}-&gt;{year},
              $path,
              Device::Cdio::ISO9660::name_translate($href-&gt;{filename});
           }

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This is an Object-Oriented interface to the GNU CD Input and Control library ("libcdio") which is written
       in C. This class handles ISO 9660 aspects of an ISO 9600 image.

       An ISO-9660 image is distinct from a CD in a CD-ROM which has ISO-9660 tracks; the latter contains other
       CD-like information (e.g. tracks, information or associated with the CD). An ISO-9660 filesystem image on
       the other hand doesn't and is generally file in some file system, sometimes with the file extension
       ".iso"; perhaps it can be burned into a CD with a suitable tool, perhaps is can be "mounted" as a
       filesystem on some OS's.

   <b>CALLING</b> <b>ROUTINES</b>
       Routines accept named parameters as well as positional parameters.  For named parameters, each argument
       name is preceded by a dash. For example:

           Device::Cdio::ISO9660::IFS-&gt;new(-source=&gt;'MYISO.ISO')

       Each argument name is preceded by a dash.  Neither case nor order matters in the argument list.
       -driver_id, -Driver_ID, and -DRIVER_ID are all acceptable.  In fact, only the first argument needs to
       begin with a dash.  If a dash is present in the first argument, we assume dashes for the subsequent
       parameters.

       In the documentation below and elsewhere in this package the parameter name that can be used in this
       style of call is given in the parameter list. For example, for "open" the documentation below reads:

          open(source, iso_mask=$pyiso9660::EXTENSION_NONE)-&gt;bool

       So the parameters are "source", and "is_mask". The iso_mask parameter is not required and if not
       specified a value of $perliso9660:EXTENSION_NON will be used.

       The older, more traditional style of positional parameters is also supported. So the "have_driver example
       from above can also be written:

           Cdio::open($s, $i)

       Finally, since no parameter name can be confused with an integer, negative values will not get confused
       as a named parameter.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>new</b>
         new(source, iso_mask)-&gt;$iso9660_object

       Create a new ISO 9660 object. Source or iso_mask is optional.

       If source is given, <b>open()</b> is called using that and the optional iso_mask parameter; iso_mask is used
       only if source is specified.  If source is given but opening fails, undef is returned.  If source is not
       given, an object is always returned.

   <b>close</b>
         close()-&gt;bool

       Close previously opened ISO 9660 image and free resources associated with ISO9660.  Call this when done
       using using an ISO 9660 image.

   <b>find_lsn</b>
         find_lsn(lsn)-&gt;$stat_href

       Find the filesystem entry that contains LSN and return file stat information about it. "undef" is
       returned on error.

   <b>get_application_id</b>
         get_application_id()-&gt;$id

       Get the application ID stored in the Primary Volume Descriptor.  undef is returned if there is some
       problem.

   <b>get_preparer_id</b>
         get_preparer_id()-&gt;$id

       Get the preparer ID stored in the Primary Volume Descriptor.  undef is returned if there is some problem.

   <b>get_publisher_id</b>
         get_publisher_id()-&gt;$id

       Get the publisher ID stored in the Primary Volume Descriptor.  undef is returned if there is some
       problem.

   <b>get_root_lsn</b>
         get_root_lsn()-&gt;$lsn

       Get the Root LSN stored in the Primary Volume Descriptor.  undef is returned if there is some problem.

   <b>get_system_id</b>
         get_system_id()-&gt;$id

       Get the Volume ID stored in the Primary Volume Descriptor.  undef is returned if there is some problem.

   <b>get_volume_id</b>
         get_volume_id()-&gt;$id

       Get the Volume ID stored in the Primary Volume Descriptor.  undef is returned if there is some problem.

   <b>get_volumeset_id</b>
         get_volume_id()-&gt;$id

       Get the Volume ID stored in the Primary Volume Descriptor.  undef is returned if there is some problem.

   <b>open</b>
         open(source, iso_mask=$perliso9660::EXTENSION_NONE)-&gt;bool

       Open an ISO 9660 image for reading. Subsequent operations will read from this ISO 9660 image.

       This should be called before using any other routine except possibly new. It is implicitly called when a
       new is done specifying a source.

       If device object was previously opened it is closed first.

       See also open_fuzzy.

   <b>open_fuzzy</b>
       open_fuzzy(source, iso_mask=$perliso9660::EXTENSION_NONE, fuzz=20)-&gt;bool

       Open an ISO 9660 image for reading. Subsequent operations will read from this ISO 9660 image. Some
       tolerence allowed for positioning the ISO9660 image. We scan for $perliso9660::STANDARD_ID and use that
       to set the eventual offset to adjust by (as long as that is &lt;= $fuzz).

       This should be called before using any other routine except possibly new (which must be called first. It
       is implicitly called when a new is done specifying a source.

       See also open.

   <b>read_fuzzy_superblock</b>
       read_fuzzy_superblock(iso_mask=$perliso9660::EXTENSION_NONE, fuzz=20)-&gt;bool

       Read the Super block of an ISO 9660 image but determine framesize and datastart and a possible additional
       offset. Generally here we are not reading an ISO 9660 image but a CD-Image which contains an ISO 9660
       filesystem.

   <b>readdir</b>
       readdir(dirname)-&gt;@iso_stat

       Read path (a directory) and return a list of iso9660 stat references

       See "stat_array_to_href" in Device::Cdio::ISO9660 for description of each hash refererence in @stat that
       is returned.

       If you look at iso9660.h you'll see more fields, such as for Rock-Ridge specific fields or XA specific
       fields. Volunteers?

   <b>read_pvd</b>
         read_pvd()-&gt;pvd

       Read the Super block of an ISO 9660 image. This is the Primary Volume Descriptor (PVD) and perhaps a
       Supplemental Volume Descriptor if (Joliet) extensions are acceptable.

   <b>read_superblock</b>
         read_superblock(iso_mask=$perliso9660::EXTENSION_NONE)-&gt;bool

       Read the Super block of an ISO 9660 image. This is the Primary Volume Descriptor (PVD) and perhaps a
       Supplemental Volume Descriptor if (Joliet) extensions are acceptable.

   <b>seek_read</b>
       seek_read(start, size=1)-&gt;(size, str)

       Seek to a position and then read n bytes. Size read is returned.

   <b>stat</b>
       stat(path, translate=0)-&gt;\%stat

       Return file status for path name psz_path. "undef" is returned on error.

       If translate is 1,  version numbers in the ISO 9660 name are dropped, i.e. ;1 is removed and if level 1
       ISO-9660 names are lowercased.

       See "stat_array_to_href" in Device::Cdio::ISO9660 for description of "\%stat" hash reference that is
       returned.
