       XGetDeviceModifierMapping, XSetDeviceModifierMapping - query or change device modifier mappings

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;X11/extensions/XInput.h&gt;

       int XSetDeviceModifierMapping( Display *display,
                                      XDevice *device,
                                      XModifierKeymap *modmap);

       XModifierKeymap *XGetDeviceModifierMapping( Display *display,
                                                   XDevice *device);

       display
              Specifies the connection to the X server.

       device
              Specifies the device whose modifier mapping is to be
              queried or modified.

       modmap
              Specifies a pointer to the XModifierKeymap structure.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
           The XSetDeviceModifierMapping request specifies the KeyCodes of
           the keys (if any) that are to be used as modifiers for the
           specified device. If it succeeds, the X server generates a
           DeviceMappingNotify event, and XSetDeviceModifierMapping
           returns MappingSuccess. X permits at most eight modifier keys.
           If more than eight are specified in the XModifierKeymap
           structure, a BadLength error results.

           The modifiermap member of the XModifierKeymap structure
           contains eight sets of max_keypermod KeyCodes, one for each
           modifier in the order Shift, Lock, Control, Mod1, Mod2, Mod3,
           Mod4, and Mod5. Only nonzero KeyCodes have meaning in each set,
           and zero KeyCodes are ignored. In addition, all of the nonzero
           KeyCodes must be in the range specified by min_keycode and
           max_keycode as returned by XListInputDevices, or a BadValue
           error results. No KeyCode may appear twice in the entire map,
           or a BadValue error results.

           An X server can impose restrictions on how modifiers can be
           changed, for example, if certain keys do not generate up
           transitions in hardware, if auto-repeat cannot be disabled on
           certain keys, or if multiple modifier keys are not supported.
           If some such restriction is violated, the status reply is
           MappingFailed, and none of the modifiers are changed. If the
           new KeyCodes specified for a modifier differ from those
           currently defined and any (current or new) keys for that
           modifier are in the logically down state,
           XSetDeviceModifierMapping returns MappingBusy, and none of the
           modifiers is changed.

           XSetDeviceModifierMapping can generate BadLength, BadDevice,
           BadMatch, BadAlloc, and BadValue errors.

           The XGetDeviceModifierMapping request returns a pointer to a
           newly created XModifierKeymap structure that contains the keys
           being used as modifiers. The structure should be freed after
           use by calling XFreeModifierMapping . If only zero values
           appear in the set for any modifier, that modifier is disabled.

           XGetDeviceModifierMapping can generate BadDevice and BadMatch
           errors.

       Structures

           The XModifierKeymap structure contains:

           typedef struct {
           int max_keypermod;
           KeyCode *modifiermap;
           } XModifierKeymap;

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
           BadLength
                  More than eight keys were specified in the
                  XModifierKeymap structure.

           BadAlloc
                  The server failed to allocate the requested resource or
                  server memory.

           BadDevice
                  An invalid device was specified. The specified device
                  does not exist or has not been opened by this client via
                  XOpenInputDevice. This error may also occur if the
                  specified device is the X keyboard or X pointer device.

           BadMatch
                  This error may occur if an XGetDeviceModifierMapping or
                  XChangeDeviceModifierMapping request was made specifying
                  a device that has no keys.

           BadValue
                  Some numeric value falls outside the range of values
                  accepted by the request. Unless a specific range is
                  specified for an argument, the full range defined by the
                  argument's type is accepted. Any argument defined as a
                  set of alternatives can generate this error.
