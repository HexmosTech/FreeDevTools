       XChangeKeyboardDevice - change which device is used as the X keyboard

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;X11/extensions/XInput.h&gt;

       Status XChangeKeyboardDevice( Display *display,
                                     XDevice *device);

       display
              Specifies the connection to the X server.

       device
              Specifies the device to be used as the X keyboard.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
           The XChangeKeyboardDevice request causes the server to use the
           specified device as the X keyboard. The device must have been
           previously opened by the requesting client via XOpenDevice or a
           BadDevice error will result. The device must support input
           class Keys, or a BadMatch error will result. If the server
           implementation does not support using the requested device as
           the X keyboard, a BadDevice error will result.

           If the specified device is grabbed by another client,
           AlreadyGrabbed is returned. If the specified device is frozen
           by a grab on another device, GrabFrozen is returned. If the
           request is successful, Success is returned.

           If the request succeeds, a ChangeDeviceNotify event is sent to
           all clients that have selected that event. A MappingNotify
           event with request = MappingKeyboard is sent to all clients.
           The specified device becomes the X keyboard and the old X
           keyboard becomes accessible through the input extension
           protocol requests.

           XChangeKeyboardDevice can generate a BadDevice or a BadMatch
           error.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
           BadDevice
                  An invalid device was specified. The specified device
                  does not exist, has not been opened by this client via
                  XOpenInputDevice, or is already one of the core X device
                  (pointer or keyboard). This error may also occur if the
                  server implementation does not support using the
                  specified device as the X keyboard.

           BadMatch
                  This error may occur if an XChangeKeyboardDevice request
                  was made specifying a device that has no keys.
