       XGetFeedbackControl, XChangeFeedbackControl - query and change input device feedbacks

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;X11/extensions/XInput.h&gt;

       XFeedbackState *XGetFeedbackControl( Display *display,
                                            XDevice *device,
                                            int *num_feedbacks);

       int XChangeFeedbackControl( Display *display,
                                   XDevice *device,
                                   Mask mask,
                                   XFeedbackControl *control);

       display
              Specifies the connection to the X server.

       device
              Specifies the device whose feedbacks are to be queried
              or modified.

       num_feedbacks
              Specifies an address into which the number of feedbacks
              supported by the device is to be returned.

       mask
              Specifies a mask specific to each type of feedback that
              describes how the feedback is to be modified.

       control
              Specifies the address of an XFeedbackControl structure
              that contains the new values for the feedback.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
           These requests are provided to manipulate those input devices
           that support feedbacks. A BadMatch error will be generated if
           the requested device does not support feedbacks. Whether or not
           a given device supports feedbacks can be determined by
           examining the information returned by the XOpenDevice request.
           For those devices that support feedbacks, XOpenDevice will
           return an XInputClassInfo structure with the input_class field
           equal to the constant FeedbackClass (defined in the file XI.h).

           The XGetFeedbackControl request returns a pointer to a list of
           XFeedbackState structures. Each item in this list describes one
           of the feedbacks supported by the device. The items are
           variable length, so each contains its length to allow traversal
           to the next item in the list.

           The feedback classes that are currently defined are:
           KbdFeedbackClass, PtrFeedbackClass, StringFeedbackClass,
           IntegerFeedbackClass, LedFeedbackClass, and BellFeedbackClass.
           These constants are defined in the file XI.h. An input device
           may support zero or more classes of feedback, and may support
           multiple feedbacks of the same class. Each feedback contains a
           class identifier and an id that is unique within that class for
           that input device. The id is used to identify the feedback when
           making an XChangeFeedbackControl request.

           XGetFeedbackControl can generate a BadDevice or BadMatch error.

           The XChangeFeedbackControl request modifies the values of one
           feedback on the specified device. The feedback is identified by
           the id field of the XFeedbackControl structure that is passed
           with the request. The fields of the feedback that are to be
           modified are identified by the bits of the mask that is passed
           with the request.

           XChangeFeedbackControl can generate a BadDevice, BadMatch, or
           BadValue error.

   <b>Structures</b>
           Each class of feedback is described by a structure specific to
           that class. These structures are defined in the file XInput.h.
           XFeedbackState and XFeedbackControl are generic structures that
           contain three fields that are at the beginning of each class of
           feedback:

           typedef struct {
               XID class;
               int length;
               XID id;
           } XFeedbackState, XFeedbackControl;

           The XKbdFeedbackState structure defines the attributes that are
           returned for feedbacks equivalent to those on the X keyboard.

           } XKbdFeedbackState;

           The XPtrFeedbackState structure defines the attributes that are
           returned for feedbacks equivalent to those on the the X
           pointer.

               XID id;
               int resolution;
               int minVal;
               int maxVal;
           } XIntegerFeedbackState;

           are returned for string feedbacks.

           typedef struct {
               XID class;
               int length;
               XID id;
               int max_symbols;
               int num_syms_supported;
               KeySym *syms_supported;
           } XStringFeedbackState;

           are returned for bell feedbacks.

           typedef struct {
               XID class;

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
           BadDevice
                  An invalid device was specified. The specified device
                  does not exist or has not been opened by this client via
                  XOpenInputDevice. This error may also occur if some
                  other client has caused the specified device to become
                  the X keyboard or X pointer device via the
                  XChangeKeyboardDevice or XChangePointerDevice requests.

           BadMatch
                  This error may occur if an XGetFeedbackControl request
                  was made specifying a device that has no feedbacks, or
                  an XChangeFeedbackControl request was made with an
                  XFeedbackControl structure that contains an invalid
                  feedback type. It may also occur if an invalid
                  combination of mask bits is specified ( DvKey but no
                  DvAutoRepeatMode for keyboard feedbacks), or if an
                  invalid KeySym is specified for a string feedback.

           BadValue
                  Some numeric value falls outside the range of values
                  accepted by the XChangeFeedbackControl request. Unless a
                  specific range is specified for an argument, the full
                  range defined by the argument's type is accepted. Any
                  argument defined as a set of alternatives can generate
                  this error.
