</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Device::Cdio::ISO9660 - Module for ISO 9660 handling

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       This encapsulates IS9660 filesystem handling. This library however needs to be used in conjunction with
       Device::Cdio, Device::Cdio::ISO9660::IFS and Device::Cdio::ISO9660::FS.

           use Device::Cdio::ISO9660;
           $name = Device::Cdio::ISO9660::name_translate('COPYING.;1');
           $bool = Device::Cdio::ISO9660::is_achar('A');

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This is an Object-Oriented Perl interface to the GNU CD Input and Control library's ISO 9660 library,
       "libiso9660".

       Encapsulation is done in two parts. The lower-level Perl interface is called perliso9660 and is generated
       by SWIG.

       The more object-oriented package Device::Cdio::ISO9660 and uses "perliso9660". Actually, there are no
       objects in Device::Cdio::ISO9660, but there are in its sub packages Device::Cdio::ISO9660::IFS,
       Device::Cdio::ISO9660::FS (and in the future Device::Cdio::ISO9660::PVD).

       Although "perliso9660" is perfectly usable on its own, it is expected that these module and classes are
       what most people will use. As perliso9660 more closely models the C interface, it is conceivable (if
       unlikely) that die-hard "libiso9660" C users who are very familiar with that interface could prefer that.

   <b>CALLING</b> <b>ROUTINES</b>
       Routines accept named parameters as well as positional parameters.  For named parameters, each argument
       name is preceded by a dash. For example:

           Device::Cdio::ISO9660::is_achar(-achar=&gt;'M')

       Each argument name is preceded by a dash.  Neither case nor order matters in the argument list.  -achar,
       -AChar, and -ACHAR are all acceptable.  In fact, only the first argument needs to begin with a dash.  If
       a dash is present in the first argument, we assume dashes for the subsequent parameters.

       In the documentation below and elsewhere in this package the parameter name that can be used in this
       style of call is given in the parameter list. For example, for "name_translate" the documentation below
       reads:

          name_translate(name, joliet_level=0) -&gt; $str

       So the parameter names are "name" and "joliet_level". Only the "name" parameter is required. If
       "joliet_level" is not specified, a value of 0 will be used. The return value is a string.

       The older, more traditional style of positional parameters is also supported which is shown in the
       synopsis above.

       Finally, since no parameter name can be confused with a an integer, negative values will not get confused
       as a named parameter.

</pre><h4><b>SUBROUTINES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>dirname_valid_p</b>
         dirname_valid_p(path)-&gt;bool

       Check that path is a valid ISO-9660 directory name.

       A valid directory name should not start out with a slash (/), dot (.) or null byte, should be less than
       37 characters long, have no more than 8 characters in a directory component which is separated by a /,
       and consist of only DCHARs.

       True is returned if path is valid.

   <b>is_achar</b>
         is_dchar(achar)-&gt;bool

       Return 1 if $achar is an ACHAR. $achar should either be a string of length one or the <b>ord()</b> of a string
       of length 1.

       These are the DCHAR's plus some ASCII symbols including the space symbol.

   <b>is_dchar</b>
         is_dchar(dchar)-&gt;bool

       Return 1 if $dchar is a DCHAR - a character that can appear in an an ISO-9600 level 1 directory name.
       These are the ASCII capital letters A-Z, the digits 0-9 and an underscore.

       $dchar should either be a string of length one or the <b>ord()</b> of a string of length 1.

   <b>pathname_valid_p</b>
           pathname_valid_p(path)-&gt;bool

       Check that path is a valid ISO-9660 pathname.

       A valid pathname contains a valid directory name, if one appears and the filename portion should be no
       more than 8 characters for the file prefix and 3 characters in the extension (or portion after a dot).
       There should be exactly one dot somewhere in the filename portion and the filename should be composed of
       only DCHARs.

       1 is returned if path is valid.

   <b>name_translate</b>
           name_translate(name, joliet_level=0)-&gt;$str

       Convert an ISO-9660 file name of the kind that is that stored in a ISO 9660 directory entry into what's
       usually listed as the file name in a listing.  Lowercase name if no Joliet Extension interpretation.
       Remove trailing ;1's or .;1's and turn the other ;'s into version numbers.

       If joliet_level is not given it is 0 which means use no Joliet Extensions. Otherwise use the specified
       the Joliet level.

       The translated string is returned and it will be larger than the input filename.

   <b>stat_array_to_href</b>
         stat_array_to_href(values)-&gt;href

       Convert a ISO 9660 array to an hash reference of the values.

       Used internally in convert from C code.

       Note, we modify the input parameter.

       A hash reference which contains:

       LSN the Logical sector number (an integer)

       size
           the total size of the file in bytes

       sec_size
           the number of sectors allocated

       filename
           the file name of the statbuf entry

       XA  if the file has XA attributes; 0 if not

       is_dir
           1 if a directory; '' if a not.

       tm  A  POSIX  time structure as often return in unis localtime() or gmtime().  However we adjust the year
           to be "normal", e.g. we use 2017 instead of 117 and months start at 1 (for January), not 0. Fields in
           "tm" are:

               sec   # Seconds (0-60)
               min   # Minutes (0-59)
               hour  # Hours (0-23)
               mday  # Day of the month (1-31)
               mon   # Month (1-12)
               year  # Year, e.g. 2017
               wday  # Day of the week (0-6, Sunday = 0)
               yday  # Day in the year (0-365, 1 Jan = 0) */
               isdst # Daylight saving time */

   <b>strncpy_pad</b>
         strncpy_pad(name, len, check='nocheck')-&gt;str

       Pad string <u>name</u> with spaces to size len and return this. If len is less than  the  length  of  <u>name</u>,  the
       return value will be truncated to the first <u>len</u> characters of <u>name</u>.

       <u>name</u>  can  also  be  scanned to see if it contains only ACHARs, DCHARs, or 7-bit ASCII chars, and this is
       specified via the <u>check</u> parameter.  If the <u>check</u> parameter is given it must  be  one  of  the  'nocheck',
       '7bit', 'achars' or 'dchars'. Case is not significant.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       Device::Cdio::ISO9660::IFS is the ISO 96600 filesystem image interface.  Device::Cdio::ISO9660::FS is the
       ISO  96600 CD-image interface.  Device::Cdio has general information on the CD Input and Control Library.
       Device::Cdio::Device is for device objects and Device::Cdio::Track is for track objects.

       perliso9660 is the lower-level interface to libcdio.

       &lt;<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libcdio">http://www.gnu.org/software/libcdio</a>&gt; has documentation on libcdio including the a manual and the API via
       doxygen.
