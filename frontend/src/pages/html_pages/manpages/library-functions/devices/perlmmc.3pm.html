</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       perlmmc - lower-level wrapper to MMC from libcdio, the ISO 9660 library of the CD Input and Control
       package

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       This is fairly straight-forward wrapper around the MultiMedia commands from the C library libcdio.
       Although this is perfectly usable on its own, it is expected that the interfaces Device::Cdio::MMC or
       Device::Cdio::Device::MMC is what most people will want to use.

       There are various constants that are defined here.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>this</b>
       This seems to be an artifact of SWIG.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       &lt;<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libcdio">http://www.gnu.org/software/libcdio</a>&gt; has documentation on libcdio including the a manual and the API via
       doxygen.
