       XChangePointerDevice - change which device is the X pointer

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;X11/extensions/XInput.h&gt;

       Status XChangePointerDevice( Display *display,
                                    XDevice *device,
                                    int xaxis,
                                    int yaxis);

       display
              Specifies the connection to the X server.

       device
              Specifies the device to be used as the X pointer.

       xaxis
              Specifies the axis of the device to be used as the X
              pointer x-axis.

       yaxis
              Specifies the axis of the device to be used as the X
              pointer y-axis.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
           The XChangePointerDevice request causes the server to use the
           specified device as the X pointer. The device must have been
           opened by the client via XOpenDevice or a BadDevice error will
           result. The device must support input class Valuators or a
           BadMatch error will result. If the implementation does not
           support use of the specified device as the X pointer, a
           BadDevice error will result.

           If the specified device is grabbed by another client,
           AlreadyGrabbed is returned. If the specified device is frozen
           by a grab on another device, GrabFrozen is returned. If the
           request is successful, Success is returned.

           If the request succeeds, a ChangeDeviceNotify event is sent to
           all clients that have selected that event. A MappingNotify
           event with request = MappingPointer is sent to all clients. The
           specified device becomes the X pointer, and the old X pointer
           becomes accessible through the input extension protocol
           requests.

           XChangePointerDevice can generate a BadDevice or a BadMatch
           error.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
           BadDevice
                  An invalid device was specified. The specified device
                  does not exist, has not been opened by this client via
                  XOpenInputDevice, or is already one of the core X input
                  devices (pointer or keyboard). This error may also occur
                  if the server implementation does not support using the
                  specified device as the X pointer.

           BadMatch
                  This error may occur if an XChangePointerDevice request
                  was made specifying a device that has less than two
                  valuators, or specifying a valuator index beyond the
                  range supported by the device.
