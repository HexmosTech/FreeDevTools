</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Device::Cdio::ISO9660::FS - Class for ISO 9660 CD reading

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       This encapsulates ISO 9660 Filesystem aspects of CD Tracks.  As such this is a This library however needs
       to be used in conjunction with Device::Cdio::ISO9660.

           use Device::Cdio::ISO9660:FS;
           $cd = Device::Cdio::ISO9660::FS-&gt;new(-source=&gt;'/dev/cdrom');
           $statbuf = $cd-&gt;stat ($iso9660_path.$local_filename);

           $blocks = POSIX::ceil($statbuf-&gt;{size} / $perlcdio::ISO_BLOCKSIZE);
           for (my $i = 0; $i &lt; $blocks; $i++) {
               my $buf = $cd-&gt;read_data_blocks ($statbuf-&gt;{LSN} + $i);
               die if !defined($buf);
           }

           print $buf;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This is an Object-Oriented interface to the GNU CD Input and Control library ("libcdio") which is written
       in C. This class handles ISO 9660 tracks on a CD or in a CD-ROM.

       Note that working with a CD in a CD-ROM which has tracks in the ISO-9660 format is distinct working with
       a <u>file</u> in a filesystem which contains an ISO-9660 image. See also Device::Cdio::ISO9660::IFS for working
       with an ISO 9660 image stored as a file in a filesystem.

   <b>CALLING</b> <b>ROUTINES</b>
       Routines accept named parameters as well as positional parameters.  For named parameters, each argument
       name is preceded by a dash. For example:

           Device::Cdio::ISO9660::FS-&gt;new(-source=&gt;'MYISO.CUE')

       Each argument name is preceded by a dash.  Neither case nor order matters in the argument list.
       -driver_id, -Driver_ID, and -DRIVER_ID are all acceptable.  In fact, only the first argument needs to
       begin with a dash.  If a dash is present in the first argument, we assume dashes for the subsequent
       parameters.

       In the documentation below and elsewhere in this package the parameter name that can be used in this
       style of call is given in the parameter list. For example, for "close_tray" the documentation below
       reads:

          close_tray(drive=undef, driver_id=$perlcdio::DRIVER_UNKNOWN)
           -&gt; ($drc, $driver_id)

       So the parameter names are "drive", and "driver_id". Neither parameter is required. If "drive" is not
       specified, a value of "undef" will be used. And if "driver_id" is not specified, a value of
       $perlcdio::DRIVER_UNKNOWN is used.

       The older, more traditional style of positional parameters is also supported. So the "new" example from
       above can also be written:

           Device::Cdio::ISO9660::FS-&gt;new('MYISO.CUE')

       Finally, since no parameter name can be confused with a an integer, negative values will not get confused
       as a named parameter.

   <b>find_lsn</b>
         find_lsn(lsn)-&gt;$stat_href

       Find the filesystem entry that contains LSN and return information about it. Undef is returned on error.

   <b>readdir</b>
         readdir(dirname)-&gt;@iso_stat

       Read path (a directory) and return a list of iso9660 stat references

       Each item of @iso_stat is a hash reference which contains

       LSN the Logical sector number (an integer)

       size
           the total size of the file in bytes

       sec_size
           the number of sectors allocated

       filename
           the file name of the statbuf entry

       XA  if the file has XA attributes; 0 if not

       is_dir
           1 if a directory; 0 if a not;

       FIXME:  If  you  look  at  iso9660.h you'll see more fields, such as for Rock-Ridge specific fields or XA
       specific fields. Eventually these will be added. Volunteers?

   <b>read_pvd</b>
         read_pvd()-&gt;pvd

       Read the Super block of an ISO 9660 image. This is the Primary Volume  Descriptor  (PVD)  and  perhaps  a
       Supplemental Volume Descriptor if (Joliet) extensions are acceptable.

   <b>read_superblock</b>
         read_superblock(iso_mask=$libiso9660::EXTENSION_NONE)-&gt;bool

       Read  the  Super  block  of  an  ISO 9660 image. This is the rimary Volume Descriptor (PVD) and perhaps a
       Supplemental Volume Descriptor if (Joliet) extensions are acceptable.

   <b>stat</b>
         stat(path, translate=0)-&gt;\%stat

       Return file status for path name psz_path. NULL is returned on error.

       If translate is 1,  version numbers in the ISO 9660 name are dropped, i.e. ;1 is removed and if  level  1
       ISO-9660 names are lowercased.

       Each item of @iso_stat is a hash reference which contains

       LSN the Logical sector number (an integer)

       size
           the total size of the file in bytes

       sec_size
           the number of sectors allocated

       filename
           the file name of the statbuf entry

       XA  if the file has XA attributes; 0 if not

       is_dir
           1 if a directory; 0 if a not;

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       This is a subclass of Device::Cdio::Device. See also Device::Cdio::Device. See Device::Cdio::ISO9660::IFS
       for working with ISO 9660 images.

       perliso9660 is the lower-level interface to "libiso9660", the ISO 9660 library of "libcdio".
