       blkio - Block device I/O library

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       libblkio  is  a  library  for accessing data stored on <u>block</u> <u>devices</u>. Block devices offer persistent data
       storage and are addressable in fixed-size units called <u>blocks</u>. Block sizes of 4  KiB  or  512  bytes  are
       typical.  Hard  disk  drives,  solid  state  disks  (SSDs),  USB mass storage devices, and other types of
       hardware are block devices.

       The focus of libblkio is on fast I/O for  multi-threaded  applications.   Management  of  block  devices,
       including partitioning and resizing, is outside the scope of the library.

       Block devices have one or more <u>queues</u> for submitting I/O requests such as reads and writes. Block devices
       process  I/O  requests  from their queues and produce a return code for each completed request indicating
       success or an error.

       The application is responsible for thread-safety. No thread synchronization is necessary when a queue  is
       only  used from a single thread. Proper synchronization is required when sharing a queue between multiple
       threads.

       libblkio can be used in blocking, event-driven, and polling modes depending on the  architecture  of  the
       application and its performance requirements.

       <u>Blocking</u>  <u>mode</u>  suspends  the  execution  of the current thread until the request completes. This is most
       natural way of writing programs that perform a sequence  of  I/O  requests  but  cannot  exploit  request
       parallelism.

       <u>Event-driven</u>  <u>mode</u>  provides a completion file descriptor that the application can monitor from its event
       loop. This allows multiple I/O requests to be in flight simultaneously and the application can respond to
       other events while waiting for completions.

       <u>Polling</u> <u>mode</u> also supports multiple in-flight  requests  but  the  application  continuously  checks  for
       completions, typically from a tight loop, in order to minimize latency.

       libblkio  contains  <u>drivers</u>  for several block I/O interfaces. This allows applications using libblkio to
       access different block devices through a single API.

   <b>Creating</b> <b>a</b> <u><b>blkio</b></u> <b>instance</b>
       A <u>struct</u> <u>blkio</u> instance is created from a specific driver such as "io_uring" as follows:

          struct blkio *b;
          int ret;

          ret = blkio_create("io_uring", &amp;b);
          if (ret &lt; 0) {
              fprintf(stderr, "%s: %s\n", strerror(-ret), blkio_get_error_msg());
              return;
          }

       For a list of available drivers, see the <u>DRIVERS</u> section below.

   <b>Error</b> <b>messages</b>
       Functions generally return 0 on success and a negative <u><a href="../man3/errno.3.html">errno</a>(3)</u> value on failure. In the  later  case,  a
       per-thread   error   message   is   also  set  and  can  be  obtained  as  a  <u>const</u>  <u>char</u>  <u>*</u>  by  calling
       <u>blkio_get_error_msg()</u>.

       Note that these messages are not stable and may change in between backward-compatible libblkio  releases.
       The  same  applies  to  returned  errno  values,  unless  a specific value is explicitly documented for a
       particular error condition.

   <b>Connecting</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>block</b> <b>device</b>
       Connection details for a block device are specified by setting properties  on  the  <u>blkio</u>  instance.  The
       available  properties  depend on the driver. For example, the io_uring driver's "path" property is set to
       <u>/dev/sdb</u> to access a local disk:

          int ret = blkio_set_str(b, "path", "/dev/sdb");
          if (ret &lt; 0) {
              fprintf(stderr, "%s: %s\n", strerror(-ret), blkio_get_error_msg());
              blkio_destroy(&amp;b);
              return;
          }

       Once the connection details have been specified the <u>blkio</u> instance can be connected to the  block  device
       with <u>blkio_connect()</u>:

          ret = blkio_connect(b);

   <b>Starting</b> <b>a</b> <b>block</b> <b>device</b>
       After  the  <u>blkio</u>  instance  is  connected, properties are available to configure its operation and query
       device characteristics such as the maximum number of queues. See <u>PROPERTIES</u> for details.

       For example, the number of queues can be set as follows:

          ret = blkio_set_int(b, "num-queues", 4);

       Once configuration is complete the <u>blkio</u> instance is started with <u>blkio_start()</u>:

          ret = blkio_start(b);

   <b>Mapping</b> <b>memory</b> <b>regions</b>
       Memory containing I/O data buffers must be "mapped" before submitting requests that touch the memory when
       the "needs-mem-regions" property is true.  Otherwise mapping memory is optional but doing so may  improve
       performance.

       Memory  regions  are  mapped  globally  for  the <u>blkio</u> instance and are available to all queues. A memory
       region is represented as follows:

          struct blkio_mem_region
          {
              void *addr;
              uint64_t iova;
              size_t len;
              int64_t fd_offset;
              int fd;
              uint32_t flags;
          };

       The <u>addr</u> field contains the starting address of the memory region. Requests  transfer  data  between  the
       block  device  and  a  subset  of the memory region, including up to the entire memory region. Individual
       read/write requests or readv/writev request segments (iovecs)  must  not  access  more  than  one  memory
       region.  Multiple  requests  can  access  the  same  memory  region simultaneously, although usually with
       non-overlapping areas.

       The <u>addr</u> field must be a multiple of the "mem-region-alignment" property.

       The <u>iova</u> field is reserved and must be zero.

       The <u>len</u> field is the size of  the  memory  region  in  bytes.  The  value  must  be  a  multiple  of  the
       "mem-region-alignment" property.

       The <u>fd</u> field is the file descriptor for the memory region. Some drivers require that I/O data buffers are
       located  in  file-backed  memory. This can be anonymous memory from <u><a href="../man2/memfd_create.2.html">memfd_create</a>(2)</u> rather than an actual
       file on disk.  If the "needs-mem-region-fd" property is true  then  this  field  must  be  a  valid  file
       descriptor. If the property is false this field may be -1.

       The <u>fd_offset</u> field is the byte offset from the start of the file given in <u>fd</u>.

       The <u>flags</u> field is reserved and must be zero.

       The   application   can   either  allocate  I/O  data  buffers  itself  and  describe  them  with  <u>struct</u>
       <u>blkio_mem_region</u> or it can use <u>blkio_alloc_mem_region()</u> and <u>blkio_free_mem_region()</u>  to  allocate  memory
       suitable for I/O data buffers:

          int blkio_alloc_mem_region(struct blkio *b, struct blkio_mem_region *region,
                                     size_t len);
          void blkio_free_mem_region(struct blkio *b,
                                     const struct blkio_mem_region *region);

       The  <u>len</u>  argument is the number of bytes to allocate. These functions may only be called after the <u>blkio</u>
       instance has been started.

       File descriptors for memory regions created with <u>blkio_alloc_mem_region()</u> are automatically closed across
       <u><a href="../man2/execve.2.html">execve</a>(2)</u>.

       Memory regions can be  mapped  and  unmapped  after  the  <u>blkio</u>  instance  has  been  started  using  the
       <u>blkio_map_mem_region()</u> and <u>blkio_unmap_mem_region()</u> functions:

          int blkio_map_mem_region(struct blkio *b,
                                   const struct blkio_mem_region *region);
          void blkio_unmap_mem_region(struct blkio *b,
                                      const struct blkio_mem_region *region);

       These  functions  must not be called while requests are in flight that access the affected memory region.
       Memory regions must not overlap. Memory regions must be unmapped/freed with exactly the same <u>region</u> field
       values that they were mapped/allocated with.

       <u>blkio_map_mem_region()</u> does not take ownership of <u>region-&gt;fd</u>.  The  caller  may  close  <u>region-&gt;fd</u>  after
       <u>blkio_map_mem_region()</u> returns.

       <u>blkio_map_mem_region()</u>  returns  an error if called on a memory region that is already mapped against the
       given <u>blkio</u>. <u>blkio_unmap_mem_region()</u> has no effect when called on a memory region  that  is  not  mapped
       against the given <u>blkio</u>.

       <u>blkio_free_mem_region()</u> must not be called on a memory region that was mapped but not unmapped.

       For  best  performance  applications  should  map  memory regions once and reuse them instead of changing
       memory regions frequently.

       The "max-mem-regions" property gives the maximum number of memory regions that can be mapped.

       Memory regions are automatically unmapped when <u>blkio_destroy()</u> is called, and  memory  regions  allocated
       using <u>blkio_alloc_mem_region()</u> are freed.

   <b>Performing</b> <b>I/O</b>
       Once  at  least  one  memory  region  has  been  mapped, the queues are ready for request processing. The
       following example reads 4096 bytes from byte offset 0x10000:

          struct blkioq *q = blkio_get_queue(b, 0);

          blkioq_read(q, 0x10000, buf, buf_size, NULL, 0);

          struct blkio_completion completion;
          ret = blkioq_do_io(q, &amp;completion, 1, 1, NULL);
          if (ret != 1) ...
          if (completion.ret != 0) ...

       This is an example of blocking mode where <u>blkioq_do_io()</u> waits until the I/O request completes. See below
       for details on event-driven and polling modes.

       The <u>blkioq_do_io()</u> function offers the following arguments:

          int blkioq_do_io(struct blkioq *q,
                           struct blkio_completion *completions,
                           int min_completions,
                           int max_completions,
                           struct timespec *timeout);

       The <u>completions</u> argument is a pointer to an array that is filled in with completions  when  the  function
       returns.  When  <u>max_completions</u>  is  0  <u>completions</u>  may  be  NULL. Completions are represented by <u>struct</u>
       <u>blkio_completion</u>:

          struct blkio_completion
          {
              void *user_data;
              const char *error_msg;
              int ret;
              /* reserved space */
          };

       The <u>user_data</u> field is the same pointer passed to <u>blkioq_read()</u> in the example above.  Applications  that
       submit multiple requests can use <u>user_data</u> to correlate completions to previously submitted requests.

       The <u>ret</u> field is the return code for the I/O request in negative errno representation. This field is 0 on
       success  for  most  request  types.  For blkioq_report_zones(), ret is the number of zones filled in or a
       negative errno.

       For some errors, the <u>error_msg</u> field points to a message describing what caused the request to fail. Note
       that this may be <u>NULL</u> even if <u>ret</u> is not 0, and is always <u>NULL</u> when <u>ret</u> is 0.

       Note that these messages are not stable and may change in between backward-compatible libblkio  releases.
       The  same  applies  to  the  errno  values  returned  through  <u>ret</u>, unless a specific value is explicitly
       documented for a particular error condition.

       <u>struct</u> <u>blkio_completion</u> also includes some reserved space which may be used to add  more  fields  in  the
       future in a backward-compatible manner.

       The remaining arguments of <u>blkioq_do_io()</u> are as follows:

       The <u>min_completions</u> argument controls how many completions to wait for. A value greater than 0 causes the
       function  to  block until the number of completions has been reached. A value of 0 causes the function to
       submit I/O and return completions that have already occurred without waiting for more.  If  greater  than
       the number of currently outstanding requests, <u>blkioq_do_io()</u> fails with -EINVAL.

       The <u>max_completions</u> argument is the maximum number of <u>completions</u> elements to fill in. This value must be
       greater or equal to <u>min_completions</u>.

       The  <u>timeout</u>  argument specifies the maximum amount of time to wait for completions. The function returns
       -ETIME if the timeout expires before a  request  completes.  If  <u>timeout</u>  is  NULL  the  function  blocks
       indefinitely.  When <u>timeout</u> is non-NULL the elapsed time is subtracted and the <u>struct</u> <u>timespec</u> is updated
       when the function returns regardless of success or failure.

       The return value is the number of <u>completions</u> elements filled in. This  value  is  within  the  inclusive
       range [<u>min_completions</u>, <u>max_completions</u>] on success or a negative errno on failure.

       A <u>blkioq_do_io_interruptible()</u> variant is also available:

          int blkioq_do_io_interruptible(struct blkioq *q,
                                         struct blkio_completion *completions,
                                         int min_completions,
                                         int max_completions,
                                         struct timespec *timeout,
                                         const sigset_t *sig);

       Unlike  <u>blkioq_do_io()</u>,  this  function can be interrupted by signals and return -EINTR. The <u>sig</u> argument
       temporarily sets the signal mask of the process while waiting for completions, which allows the thread to
       be woken by a signal without race conditions. To ensure this function is interrupted  when  a  signal  is
       received,  (1) the said signal must be in a blocked state when invoking the function (see <u><a href="../man2/sigprocmask.2.html">sigprocmask</a>(2)</u>)
       and (2) a signal mask unblocking that signal must be given as the <u>sig</u> argument.

   <b>Event-driven</b> <b>mode</b>
       Completion processing can be integrated into the event loop of an application so that other activity  can
       take  place  while  I/O is in flight. Each queue has a completion file descriptor that is returned by the
       following function:

          int blkioq_get_completion_fd(struct blkioq *q);

       The returned file descriptor becomes readable when <u>blkioq_do_io()</u> needs  to  be  called  again.  Spurious
       events can occur, causing the fd to become readable even if there are no new completions available.

       The  returned  file  descriptor  has  O_NONBLOCK  set.  The application may switch the file descriptor to
       blocking mode.

       By default, the driver might not generate completion events for requests so it is necessary to explicitly
       enable the completion file descriptor before use:

          void blkioq_set_completion_fd_enabled(struct blkioq *q, bool enable);

       Changes made using this function apply also to requests that are already in flight but not yet completed.
       Note that even after calling this  function  with  <u>enabled</u>  as  <u>false</u>,  the  driver  may  still  generate
       completion events.

       The  application  must read 8 bytes from the completion file descriptor to reset the event before calling
       <u>blkioq_do_io()</u>. The contents of the bytes are undefined and should not be interpreted by the application.

       The following example demonstrates event-driven I/O:

          struct blkioq *q = blkio_get_queue(b, 0);
          int completion_fd = blkio_get_completion_fd(q);
          char event_data[8];

          /* Switch to blocking mode for <a href="../man2/read.2.html">read</a>(2) below */
          fcntl(completion_fd, F_SETFL,
                fcntl(completion_fd, F_GETFL, NULL) &amp; ~O_NONBLOCK);

          /* Enable completion events */
          blkioq_set_completion_fd_enabled(q, true);

          blkioq_read(q, 0x10000, buf, buf_size, NULL, 0);

          /* Since min_completions = 0 we will submit but not wait */
          ret = blkioq_do_io(q, NULL, 0, 0, NULL);
          if (ret != 0) ...

          /* Wait for the next event on the completion file descriptor */
          struct blkio_completion completion;
          do {
            read(completion_fd, event_data, sizeof(event_data));
            ret = blkioq_do_io(q, &amp;completion, 0, 1, NULL);
          } while (ret == 0);
          if (ret != 1) ...
          if (completion.ret != 0) ...

       This example uses a blocking <u><a href="../man2/read.2.html">read</a>(2)</u>  to  wait  and  consume  the  next  event  on  the  completion  file
       descriptor.  Because  spurious  events  can  occur,  it  then  checks  if  there actually is a completion
       available, retrying <u><a href="../man2/read.2.html">read</a>(2)</u> otherwise.

       Normally <u>completion_fd</u> would be registered with an event loop so the application can perform other  tasks
       while waiting.

       Applications may save CPU cycles by suppressing completion file descriptor notifications while processing
       completions. This optimization avoids an unnecessary application event loop iteration and completion file
       descriptor read when additional completions arrive while the application is processing completions:

          static void process_completions(...)
          {
              int ret;

              /* Suppress completion fd notifications while we process completions */
              blkioq_set_completion_fd_enabled(q, false);

              do {
                  struct blkioq_completion completion;
                  ret = blkioq_do_io(q, &amp;completion, 0, 1, NULL);

                  if (ret == 0) {
                      blkioq_set_completion_fd_enabled(q, true);

                      /* Re-check for completions to avoid race */
                      ret = blkioq_do_io(q, &amp;completion, 0, 1, NULL);
                      if (ret == 1) {
                          blkioq_set_completion_fd_enabled(q, false);
                      }
                  }

                  if (ret &lt; 0) {
                      ... /* error */
                  }

                  if (ret == 1) {
                      ... /* process completion */
                  }
              } while (ret == 1);
          }

   <b>Application-level</b> <b>polling</b> <b>mode</b>
       Waiting  for completions using <u>blkioq_do_io()</u> with <u>min_completions</u> &gt; 0 can cause the current thread to be
       descheduled by the operating system's scheduler.  The same  is  true  when  waiting  for  events  on  the
       completion  file  descriptor returned by <u>blkioq_get_completion_fd()</u>. Some applications require consistent
       low response times and therefore cannot risk being descheduled.

       <u>blkioq_do_io()</u> may be called from a CPU polling loop with <u>min_completions</u> = 0 to check for completions:

          struct blkioq *q = blkio_get_queue(b, 0);

          blkioq_read(q, 0x10000, buf, buf_size, NULL, 0);

          /* Busy-wait for the completion */
          struct blkio_completion completion;
          do {
              ret = blkioq_do_io(q, &amp;completion, 0, 1, NULL);
          } while (ret == 0);

          if (ret != 1) ...
          if (completion.ret != 0) ...

       This approach is ideal for applications that need to poll several event sources simultaneously,  or  that
       need to intersperse polling with other application logic. Otherwise, driver-level polling (see below) may
       lead to further performance gains.

   <b>Driver-level</b> <b>polling</b> <b>mode</b> <b>(poll</b> <b>queues)</b>
       Poll  queues  differ  from  the  "regular"  queues  presented  above  in that calling <u>blkioq_do_io()</u> with
       <u>min_completions</u> &gt; 0 causes libblkio itself (or other lower layers) to poll for completions. This  can  be
       more efficient than repeatedly invoking <u>blkioq_do_io()</u> with <u>min_completions</u> = 0 on a "regular" queue. For
       instance, with the io_uring driver, poll queues cause the kernel itself to poll for completions, avoiding
       repeated context switching while polling.

       A limitation of poll queues is that the CPU thread is occupied with a single poll queue and cannot detect
       other  events  in  the  meantime  such as network I/O or application events. Applications wishing to poll
       multiple things simultaneously may prefer to use application-level polling (see above).

       Poll queue support is contingent on the  particular  driver  and  driver  configuration  being  used.  To
       determine whether a given <u>blkio</u> supports poll queues, check the "supports-poll-queues" property:

          bool supports_poll_queues;
          ret = blkio_get_bool(b, "supports-poll-queues", &amp;supports_poll_queues);
          if (ret != 0) ...

          if (!supports_poll_queues) {
              fprintf(stderr, "Poll queues not supported\n");
              return;
          }

       It  is  possible  for  poll  queues  not  to  support  flush, write zeroes, and discard requests, even if
       "regular" queues of the same <u>blkio</u> do. However, read,  write,  readv,  and  writev  requests  are  always
       supported. There is currently no mechanism to check which types of requests are supported by poll queues.

       To  use poll queues, set the "num-poll-queues" property to a positive value before calling <u>blkio_start()</u>,
       then use <u>blkio_get_poll_queue()</u> to retrieve the poll queues. A  single  <u>blkio</u>  can  have  both  "regular"
       queues and poll queues:

          ...
          ret = blkio_connect(b);
          if (ret != 0) ...

          ret = blkio_set_int(b, "num-queues", 1);
          ret = blkio_set_int(b, "num-poll-queues", 1);
          if (ret != 0) ...

          ret = blkio_start(b);
          if (ret != 0) ...

          struct blkioq *q      = blkio_get_queue(b, 0);
          struct blkioq *poll_q = blkio_get_poll_queue(b, 0);

       It is possible to set property "num-queues" to 0 as long as "num-poll-queues" is positive.

       Poll   queues   also   differ  from  "regular"  queues  in  that  they  do  not  have  a  completion  fd.
       <u>blkioq_get_completion_fd()</u> returns -1 when called on a poll queue, and <u>blkioq_set_completion_fd_enabled()</u>
       has no effect. Further, <u>blkioq_do_io_interruptible()</u> is not currently supported on poll queues.

       Note that you  can  still  perform  application-level  polling  on  poll  queues  by  repeatedly  calling
       <u>blkioq_do_io()</u> with <u>min_completions</u> = 0, but this will lead to suboptimal performance.

   <b>Dynamically</b> <b>adding</b> <b>and</b> <b>removing</b> <b>queues</b>
       Some drivers have support for adding queues on demand after the <u>blkio</u> instance is already started:

          int index = blkio_add_queue(b); /* or blkio_add_poll_queue() */
          if (ret &lt; 0) ...

          struct blkioq *q = blkio_get_queue(b, index); /* or blkio_get_poll_queue() */

       The "can-add-queues" property determines whether this is supported. When it is, the <u>blkio</u> instance can be
       started with 0 queues.

       In  addition,  <u>all</u>  drivers  allow  explicitly  removing  queues, regardless of whether those queues were
       created by <u>blkio_start()</u> or <u>blkio_add_queue()</u> / <u>blkio_add_poll_queue()</u>:

          assert(blkio_get_queue(b, 0) != NULL);
          assert(blkio_get_queue(b, 1) != NULL);

          /* blkio_remove_queue() will return 0, indicating success */
          assert(blkio_remove_queue(b, 0) == 0);

          /* Other queues' indices are not shifted, so q will be non-NULL and valid */
          struct blkio *q = blkio_get_queue(b, 1);
          assert(q != NULL);

          /* blkio_remove_queue() will return -ENOENT, since queue 0 no longer exists */
          assert(blkio_remove_queue(b, 0) == -ENOENT);

       Once a queue is removed, any <u>struct</u> <u>blkioq</u> <u>*</u> pointing to it becomes invalid.

   <b>Request</b> <b>types</b>
       The following types of I/O requests are available:

          void blkioq_read(struct blkioq *q, uint64_t start, void *buf, size_t len,
                           void *user_data, uint32_t flags);
          void blkioq_write(struct blkioq *q, uint64_t start, void *buf, size_t len,
                            void *user_data, uint32_t flags);
          void blkioq_readv(struct blkioq *q, uint64_t start, struct iovec *iovec,
                            int iovcnt, void *user_data, uint32_t flags);
          void blkioq_writev(struct blkioq *q, uint64_t start, struct iovec *iovec,
                             int iovcnt, void *user_data, uint32_t flags);
          void blkioq_write_zeroes(struct blkioq *q, uint64_t start, uint64_t len,
                                   void *user_data, uint32_t flags);
          void blkioq_discard(struct blkioq *q, uint64_t start, uint64_t len,
                              void *user_data, uint32_t flags);
          void blkioq_flush(struct blkioq *q, void *user_data, uint32_t flags);
          void blkioq_report_zones(
                    struct blkioq *q, uint64_t offset, struct blkio_zone *zones,
                    uint32_t nr_zones, void *user_data, uint32_t flags);
          void blkioq_close_zone(struct blkioq *q, uint64_t offset, void *user_data,
                                 uint32_t flags);
          void blkioq_finish_zone(struct blkioq *q, uint64_t offset, void *user_data,
                                  uint32_t flags);
          void blkioq_open_zone(struct blkioq *q, uint64_t offset, void *user_data,
                                uint32_t flags);
          void blkioq_reset_zone(struct blkioq *q, uint64_t offset, void *user_data,
                                 uint32_t flags);
          void blkioq_close_zone_all(struct blkioq *q, void *user_data,
                                     uint32_t flags);
          void blkioq_finish_zone_all(struct blkioq *q, void *user_data,
                                      uint32_t flags);
          void blkioq_open_zone_all(struct blkioq *q, void *user_data, uint32_t flags);
          void blkioq_reset_zone_all(struct blkioq *q, void *user_data,
                                     uint32_t flags);

       The block device may see requests as soon as they these functions are called, but <u>blkioq_do_io()</u> must  be
       called to ensure requests are seen.

       If  property  "needs-mem-regions"  is  true,  I/O data buffers pointed to by <u>buf</u> and <u>iovec</u> must be within
       regions mapped using <u>blkio_map_mem_region()</u>.

       The application must not  free  the  <u>iovec</u>  elements  until  the  request's  completion  is  returned  by
       <u>blkioq_do_io()</u>.

       All   drivers   are  guaranteed  to  support  at  least  <u>blkioq_read()</u>,  <u>blkioq_write()</u>,  <u>blkioq_readv()</u>,
       <u>blkioq_writev()</u>, and <u>blkioq_flush()</u>.  When attempting to  queue  a  request  that  the  driver  does  not
       support, the request itself fails and its completion's <u>ret</u> field is -ENOTSUP.

       <u>blkioq_read()</u> and <u>blkioq_readv()</u> read data from the block device at byte offset <u>start</u>. <u>blkioq_write()</u> and
       <u>blkioq_writev()</u> write data to the block device at byte offset <u>start</u>. The length of the I/O data buffer is
       <u>len</u>  bytes  and  the total size of the <u>iovec</u> elements, respectively. <u>start</u> and the length of the I/O data
       buffer must be a multiple of the "request-alignment" property. I/O data  buffer  addresses  and  lengths,
       including <u>buf</u> and individual <u>iovec</u> elements, must be multiples of the "buf-alignment" property.

       <u>blkioq_write_zeroes()</u>  causes  zeros  to  be written to the specified region. When supported, this may be
       more efficient than using <u>blkioq_write()</u> with a zero-filled buffer.

       <u>blkioq_discard()</u> causes data in the specified region to be  discarded.   Subsequent  reads  to  the  same
       region  return  unspecified data until it is written to again. Note that discarded data is not guaranteed
       to be erased and may still be returned by reads.

       <u>blkioq_flush()</u> persists completed writes to the storage medium. Data is persistent once the flush request
       completes successfully. Applications that need to ensure that data persists across power failure or crash
       must submit flush requests at appropriate points.

       <u>blkioq_report_zones()</u> allows the application to discover the zone organization of a zoned storage device.
       It writes the device zone information to the <u>zone</u> array  which  must  be  provided  by  the  application.
       Currently  implemented  only for nvme-io_uring driver. Report zones requests are described in more detail
       further below.

       <u>blkioq_close_zone()</u> transitions the zone to the BLKIO_ZONE_STATE_CLOSED state.

       <u>blkioq_finish_zone()</u> transitions the zone to the BLKIO_ZONE_STATE_FULL state.  The write pointer  of  the
       zone  is  moved  to  the  end  of  the  zone. No more write operations can be submitted to the zone until
       blkioq_reset_zone() or blkioq_reset_zone_all() is performed.

       <u>blkioq_open_zone()</u> transitions the zone to the BLKIO_ZONE_STATE_EXP_OPEN state.

       <u>blkioq_reset_zone()</u> resets the zone's write pointer to the beginning of the  zone.  All  data  previously
       written to the zone is lost. The zone is now in the BLKIO_ZONE_STATE_EMPTY state.

       The  <u>offset</u>  argument  identifies  the  number  of  the  zone to perform the management request on. It is
       represented as the byte offset from the beginning of the device and is used in  the  management  requests
       that operate only on one zone.

       <u>blkioq_close_zone_all()</u>  transitions  all  zones  that  are  in  the  BLKIO_ZONE_STATE_IMP_OPEN state and
       BLKIO_ZONE_STATE_EXP_OPEN to the BLKIO_ZONE_STATE_CLOSED state.

       <u>blkioq_finish_zone_all()</u>   transitions   all   zones   that   are   in   the   BLKIO_ZONE_STATE_IMP_OPEN,
       BLKIO_ZONE_STATE_EXP_OPEN and BLKIO_ZONE_STATE_CLOSED state to the BLKIO_ZONE_STATE_FULL state.

       <u>blkioq_open_zone_all()</u>  transitions  all  zones  that  are  in  the  BLKIO_ZONE_STATE_CLOSED state to the
       BLKIO_ZONE_STATE_EXP_OPEN state.

       <u>blkioq_reset_zone_all()</u>   transitions   all   zones   that   are   in   the    BLKIO_ZONE_STATE_IMP_OPEN,
       BLKIO_ZONE_STATE_EXP_OPEN,    BLKIO_ZONE_STATE_CLOSED    and    BLKIO_ZONE_STATE_FULL    state   to   the
       BLKIO_ZONE_STATE_EMPTY state.

       The <u>user_data</u> pointer is returned in the <u>struct</u> <u>blkio_completion::user_data</u> field by  <u>blkioq_do_io()</u>.  It
       allows applications to correlate a completion with its request.

       No  ordering  guarantees are defined for requests that are in flight simultaneously. For example, a flush
       request is not guaranteed to persist in-flight write requests. Instead  the  application  must  wait  for
       write requests that it wishes to persist to complete before calling <u>blkioq_flush()</u>.

       Similarly,  there  are  no  ordering guarantees between multiple queues of a block device. Multi-threaded
       applications that rely on an ordering between multiple queues must wait for the first request to complete
       on one queue, synchronize threads as needed, and then submit the second request on the other queue.

   <b>Request</b> <b>flags</b>
       The following request flags are available:

       <b>BLKIO_REQ_FUA</b>
              Ensures that data written by this  request  reaches  persistent  storage  before  the  request  is
              completed.  This  is  also  known  as  Full Unit Access (FUA). This flag eliminates the need for a
              separate <u>blkioq_flush()</u> call after the request has  completed.  Other  data  that  was  previously
              successfully  written  without the <u>BLKIO_REQ_FUA</u> flag is not necessarily persisted by this flag as
              it is only guaranteed to affect the current request. Supported by <u>blkioq_write()</u>, <u>blkioq_writev()</u>,
              and <u>blkioq_write_zeroes()</u>.

       <b>BLKIO_REQ_NO_UNMAP</b>
              Ensures that <u>blkioq_write_zeroes()</u> does not cause underlying  storage  space  to  be  deallocated,
              guaranteeing that subsequent writes to the same region do not fail due to lack of space.

       <b>BLKIO_REQ_NO_FALLBACK</b>
              Ensures  that  <u>blkioq_write_zeroes()</u>  does  not  resort  to performing regular write requests with
              zero-filled buffers. If that would otherwise be the case and this flag is set,  then  the  request
              fails and its completion's <u>ret</u> field is -ENOTSUP.

   <b>Report</b> <b>zones</b>
       The  <u>offset</u> argument is the offset in bytes that determines the zone to start the report from. When it is
       not multiple of zone size, it is rounded down to the beginning of the nearest zone.

       The <u>zones</u> argument is a pointer to an array of <u>blkio_zone</u> structs. The  application  must  not  free  the
       <u>zones</u> data buffer's elements until the request's completion is returned by <u>blkioq_do_io()</u>.

       The <u>nr_zones</u> argument is the number of zones requested by the application and the length of <u>zones</u> buffer.

       Each zone is represented by <u>struct</u> <u>blkio_zone</u>:

          struct blkio_zone
          {
              uint64_t start;
              uint64_t len;
              uint64_t capacity;
              uint64_t write_pointer;
              uint8_t  zone_type;
              uint8_t  zone_state;
              uint8_t  reset;
              /* reserved space */
          };

       <u>start</u>, <u>len</u>, <u>capacity</u> and <u>write_pointer</u> are represented in bytes.

       The  <u>start</u>  field  is  the byte offset where the zone begins. <u>start</u> value is relative to the start of the
       device.

       The <u>len</u> field is the size of the zone. It can be larger than the size of usable memory and  includes  the
       size of unusable blocks, if they are present.

       The  <u>capacity</u> field indicates the size of usable memory within the zone. It is always smaller or equal to
       the zone size.

       The <u>write_pointer</u> is the zone write pointer position. It shows the amount of space within the  zone  that
       has been used. <u>write_pointer</u> value is relative to the start of the device.

       The <u>zone_type</u> is one amongst three zone types that are defined as follows:

       <b>BLKIO_ZONE_TYPE_CONVENTIONAL</b>
              Conventional zones accept random write operations and do not have a write pointer.

       <b>BLKIO_ZONE_TYPE_SEQWRITE_REQ</b>
              Sequential-write-required  zones  can  only be written sequentially. Each zone has a write pointer
              that represents how many bytes have been  written/used.   Any  write  operation's  start  must  be
              aligned with the current position of the zone write pointer.

       <b>BLKIO_ZONE_TYPE_SEQWRITE_PREF</b>
              Sequential-write-preferred  zones  accept  random  write  operations.  Although,  writing  to them
              sequentially may lead to better performance. Each zone has a write pointer and can be used in  the
              same manner as sequential-write-required zone.

       All zone types accept random read operations.

       The  <u>zone_state</u>  field  contains the state of the zone variant which describes the usage of memory within
       the zone and resources of the device that this zone uses. The following zone states are defined:

       <b>BLKIO_ZONE_STATE_EMPTY</b>
              The zone has not been written and none of the blocks contain valid data.

       <b>BLKIO_ZONE_STATE_FULL</b>
              All the blocks within the zone have been written or zone has been finished by the application  via
              blkioq_finish_zone() or blkioq_finish_zone_all().

       <b>BLKIO_ZONE_STATE_IMP_OPEN</b>
              The zone was implicitly opened by being written to. The zone is active.

       <b>BLKIO_ZONE_STATE_EXP_OPEN</b>
              The    zone    was    explicitly   opened   by   the   application   via   blkioq_open_zone()   or
              blkioq_open_zone_all(). The zone is active.

       <b>BLKIO_ZONE_STATE_CLOSED</b>
              The   zone   was   explicitly   closed   by   the   application   via    blkioq_close_zone()    or
              blkioq_close_zone_all(). The zone is active.

       <b>BLKIO_ZONE_STATE_READONLY</b>
              The zone can only be read.

       <b>BLKIO_ZONE_STATE_OFFLINE</b>
              The zone cannot be read nor written.

       The reset field is 1 when the application should perform RESET ZONE command and 0 otherwise.

</pre><h4><b>PROPERTIES</b></h4><pre>
       The  configuration  of  <u>blkio</u> instances is done through property accesses. Each property has a name and a
       type (bool, int, str, uint64). Properties may be read-only (r), write-only (w), or read/write (rw).

       Access to properties depends on the <u>blkio</u> instance state (created/connected/started). A property  may  be
       read/write in the connected state but read-only in the started state. This is written as "rw connected, r
       started".

       The following properties APIs are available:

          int blkio_get_bool(struct blkio *b, const char *name, bool *value);
          int blkio_get_int(struct blkio *b, const char *name, int *value);
          int blkio_get_uint64(struct blkio *b, const char *name, uint64_t *value);
          int blkio_get_str(struct blkio *b, const char *name, char **value);

          int blkio_set_bool(struct blkio *b, const char *name, bool value);
          int blkio_set_int(struct blkio *b, const char *name, int value);
          int blkio_set_uint64(struct blkio *b, const char *name, uint64_t value);
          int blkio_set_str(struct blkio *b, const char *name, const char *value);

       <u>blkio_get_str()</u> assigns to <u>*value</u> and the caller must use <u><a href="../man3/free.3.html">free</a>(3)</u> to deallocate the memory.

       <u>blkio_get_str()</u>  automatically  converts  to  string  representation  if  the  property  is  not  a  str.
       <u>blkio_set_str()</u> automatically converts from string representation if the property is not a str. This  can
       be used to easily fetch values from and store values to an application's text-based configuration file or
       command-line.  Aside  from  this  automatic  conversion,  the other property APIs fail with ENOTTY if the
       property does not have the right type.

       The following properties are common across all drivers.  Driver-specific  properties  are  documented  in
       <u>DRIVERS</u>.

   <b>Properties</b> <b>available</b> <b>after</b> <u><b>blkio_create()</b></u>
       <b>can-add-queues</b> <b>(bool,</b> <b>r</b> <b>created/connected/started)</b>
              Whether    the    driver   supports   dynamically   adding   queues   with   <u>blkio_add_queue()</u>   /
              <u>blkio_add_poll_queue()</u>.

       <b>driver</b> <b>(str,</b> <b>r</b> <b>created/connected/started)</b>
              The driver name that was passed to <u>blkio_create()</u>. See <u>DRIVERS</u> for details on available drivers.

       <b>read-only</b> <b>(bool,</b> <b>rw</b> <b>created,</b> <b>r</b> <b>connected/started)</b>
              If true, requests other than read and flush fail with -EBADF. The default is false.

   <b>Properties</b> <b>available</b> <b>after</b> <u><b>blkio_connect()</b></u>
       <b>DEVICE</b> <b>AND</b> <b>QUEUES</b>

          <b>capacity</b> <b>(uint64,</b> <b>r</b> <b>connected/started)</b>
                 The size of the block device in bytes.

          <b>max-queues</b> <b>(int,</b> <b>r</b> <b>connected/started)</b>

</pre><h4><b>DRIVERS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>io_uring</b>
       The io_uring driver uses the Linux io_uring system call interface to  perform  I/O  on  files  and  block
       device nodes. Both regular files and block device nodes are supported.

       Note  that  io_uring  was  introduced  in Linux kernel version 5.1, and kernels may also be configured to
       disable io_uring. If io_uring is not available, <u>blkio_create()</u> fails with -ENOSYS when using this driver.

       When performing I/O on regular files, write zeroes requests that extend past the end-of-file <u>may</u>  <u>or</u>  <u>may</u>
       <u>not</u> update the file size. This is left unspecified and the user must not rely on any particular behavior.

       This  driver  supports poll queues only when using O_DIRECT on block devices or file systems that support
       polling. Its poll queues never support flush, write zeroes, or discard requests.

       <b>Driver-specific</b> <b>properties</b> <b>available</b> <b>after</b> <u>blkio_create()</u>

          <b>direct</b> <b>(bool,</b> <b>rw</b> <b>created,</b> <b>r</b> <b>connected/started)</b>
                 True to bypass the page cache with O_DIRECT. The default is false.

          <b>fd</b> <b>(int,</b> <b>rw</b> <b>created,</b> <b>r</b> <b>connected/started)</b>
                 An existing open file descriptor for the file or block  device  node.  Ownership  of  the  file
                 descriptor is passed to the library when blkio_connect() returns success.

                 If  this  property  is  set,  properties  "direct" and "read-only" have no effect and it is the
                 user's responsibility to open the file with the desired flags.  Further, during connect,  those
                 two properties are updated to reflect the file status flags of the given file descriptor.

          <b>path</b> <b>(str,</b> <b>rw</b> <b>created,</b> <b>r</b> <b>connected/started)</b>
                 The file system path of the file or block device node.

                 If  this  property  is  set,  property  "fd"  must not be set and will be updated on connect to
                 reflect the opened file descriptor. Note that the file descriptor is owned by libblkio.

          <b>num-entries</b> <b>(int,</b> <b>rw</b> <b>connected,</b> <b>r</b> <b>started)</b>
                 The minimum number of entries that each io_uring submission queue and completion  queue  should
                 have. The default is 128.

                 A  larger  value allows more requests to be in flight, but consumes more resources. Tuning this
                 value can affect performance.

                 io_uring imposes a maximum on this number: 32768 as of mainline kernel 5.18, and 4096 prior  to
                 5.4. If this maximum is exceeded, <u>blkio_start()</u> will fail with -EINVAL.

   <b>nvme-io_uring</b>
       The  nvme-io_uring driver submits NVMe commands directly to an NVMe namespace using io_uring passthrough,
       which is available since mainline Linux kernel 5.19.

       The process must have the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability to use this driver, and the NVMe  namespace  must  use
       the NVM command set.

                 Ownership of the file descriptor is passed to the library when blkio_connect() returns success.

          <b>path</b> <b>(str,</b> <b>rw</b> <b>created,</b> <b>r</b> <b>connected/started)</b>
                 A path to the NVMe namespace's character device (e.g., <u>/dev/ng0n1</u>).

                 If this property is set, property "fd" must not be set  and  will  be  updated  on  connect  to
                 reflect the opened file descriptor. Note that the file descriptor is owned by libblkio.

       <b>Driver-specific</b> <b>properties</b> <b>available</b> <b>after</b> <u>blkio_connect()</u>

                 • Host-aware (1). Random write requests are supported for backward compatibility although zoned
                   storage semantics are supported.

                 • Host-managed (2). Only sequential writes are supported according to zoned storage semantics.

          <b>max_active_zones</b> <b>(int,</b> <b>r</b> <b>connected/started)</b>
                 The number of zones that can be in the implicit open, explicit open, or  closed  state  at  any
                 given time. This number is always greater or equal to the "max_open_zones" property.

                 When  this  number  is reached, the application must reset or finish a currently active zone in
                 order to free resources for further operations.  This number only affects the ability to  write
                 zones and not the ability to read.

          <b>max_open_zones</b> <b>(int,</b> <b>r</b> <b>connected/started)</b>
                 The number of zones that can be in the implicit open or explicit open state at any given time.

                 When this number is reached, the application must close, finish, or reset a currently open zone
                 in  order  to  free  resources  for further operations. This number only affects the ability to

                 The maximum number of bytes for a zone append request.

   <b>virtio-blk-...</b>
       The following virtio-blk drivers are provided:

       • The virtio-blk-vfio-pci driver uses uses VFIO to control a PCI virtio-blk device.

       • The virtio-blk-vhost-user driver  connects  as  a  client  to  a  Unix  domain  socket  provided  by  a
         vhost-user-blk backend (e.g. exported from <u>qemu-storage-daemon</u>).

       • The virtio-blk-vhost-vdpa driver uses vhost-vdpa kernel interface to perform I/O on a vDPA device. vDPA
         device could be implemented in software (VDUSE, in-kernel, simulator) or in hardware.

       These drivers always support poll queues, and their poll queues support all types of requests.

       The following properties apply to all these drivers with some exceptions described in the property.

       <b>Driver-specific</b> <b>properties</b> <b>available</b> <b>after</b> <u>blkio_create()</u>

          <b>fd</b> <b>(int,</b> <b>rw</b> <b>created,</b> <b>r</b> <b>connected/started)</b>
                 An  existing  open file descriptor for the file system path (see <u>path</u> below).  Ownership of the
                 file descriptor is passed to the  library  when  blkio_connect()  returns  success.   Currently
                 supported by the following drivers: - virtio-blk-vhost-vdpa

          <b>path</b> <b>(str,</b> <b>rw</b> <b>created,</b> <b>r</b> <b>connected/started)</b>

                 • virtio-blk-vfio-pci:   The   file   system  path  of  the  device's  sysfs  directory,  e.g.,

                 The queue size to configure the device with. The default is 256. A  larger  value  allows  more
                 requests  to  be  in  flight,  but  consumes  more  resources.   Tuning  this  value can affect
                 performance.

</pre><h4><b>BUILD</b> <b>SYSTEM</b> <b>INTEGRATION</b></h4><pre>
       pkg-config is the recommended way to build a program with libblkio:

          $ cc -o app app.c `pkg-config blkio --cflags --libs`

       Meson projects can use pkg-config as follows:

          blkio = dependency('blkio')
          executable('app', 'app.c', dependencies : [blkio])

</pre><h4><b>FREQUENTLY</b> <b>ASKED</b> <b>QUESTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Can</b> <b>network</b> <b>storage</b> <b>drivers</b> <b>be</b> <b>added?</b>
       Maybe. The API was designed with a synchronous  control  path.  Functions  like  <u>blkio_get_uint64()</u>  must
       return  quickly.  Operations on network storage can take an unbounded amount of time (in the absence of a
       timeout mechanism) and are not a good fit for synchronous APIs. A more complex asynchronous control  path
       API could be added for applications wishing to use network storage drivers in the future.

   <b>Can</b> <b>non-Linux</b> <b>operating</b> <b>systems</b> <b>be</b> <b>supported</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>future?</b>
       Maybe.  No  attempt  has  been  made  to restrict the library to POSIX features only and most drivers are
       platform-specific. If there is demand for supporting other operating systems and  developers  willing  to
       work on it then it may be possible.

   <b>Can</b> <b>a</b> <b>Linux</b> <b>AIO</b> <b>driver</b> <b>be</b> <b>added?</b>
       Linux  AIO  could  serve as a fallback on systems where io_uring is not available.  However, <u><a href="../man2/io_submit.2.html">io_submit</a>(2)</u>
       can block the process and this causes performance problems in event-driven applications that require that
       the event loop does not block. Unless Linux AIO is fixed it is unlikely that a proposal to add  a  driver
       will be accepted.
