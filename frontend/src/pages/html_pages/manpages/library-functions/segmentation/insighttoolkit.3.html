       insighttoolkit - imaging toolkit for segmentation and registration

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This manual page briefly documents the <b>Insight</b> <b>Toolkit</b> (ITK).

       ITK is an open-source software toolkit for performing registration and segmentation.  Segmentation is the
       process  of  identifying  and classifying data found in a digitally sampled representation. Typically the
       sampled representation is an image acquired from such medical instrumentation  as  CT  or  MRI  scanners.
       Registration  is  the  task  of  aligning or developing correspondences between data. For example, in the
       medical environment, a CT scan may be aligned with a  MRI  scan  in  order  to  combine  the  information
       contained in both.

       ITK  is  implemented  in C++. In addition, an automated wrapping process generates interfaces between C++
       and interpreted programming languages such as Tcl, Java, and Python. This enables  developers  to  create
       software  using  a  variety  of  programming  languages. ITK's C++ implementation style is referred to as
       generic programming. Such C++ templating means that the code is  highly  efficient,  and  that  the  many
       software problems are discovered at compile-time, rather than at run-time during program execution.

       Because  ITK  is  an  open-source project, developers from around the world can use, debug, maintain, and
       extend the software. ITK uses a model of software development referred to as Extreme Programming. Extreme
       Programming collapses the usual software creation methodology into a simultaneous and  iterative  process
       of  design-implement-test-release. The key features of Extreme Programming are communication and testing.
       Communication among the members of the ITK community is what helps manage  the  rapid  evolution  of  the
       software.  Testing  is  what  keeps the software stable. In ITK, an extensive testing process is in place
       that measures the quality on a daily basis.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       In 1999 the US  <b>National</b>  <b>Library</b>  <b>of</b>  <b>Medicine</b>  [<a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/nlmhome.html">http://www.nlm.nih.gov/nlmhome.html</a>]  of  the  National
       Institutes  of  Health  awarded  a  three-year  contract  to  develop  an  open-source  registration  and
       segmentation toolkit, which eventually came to be known as the Insight Toolkit (ITK). The primary purpose
       of      the      project      is       to       support       the       <b>Visible</b>       <b>Human</b>       <b>Project</b>
       [<a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/visible/visible_human.html">http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/visible/visible_human.html</a>]  by  providing software tools to process and
       work with the project data. ITK's NLM Project Manager was Dr. Terry Yoo, who coordinated  the  six  prime
       contractors  who  made  up the Insight consortium. These consortium members included the three commercial
       partners GE Corporate R&amp;D, Kitware, Inc., and MathSoft (the company name  is  now  Insightful);  and  the
       three  academic partners University of North Carolina (UNC), University of Tennessee (UT), and University
       of Pennsylvania (UPenn).  The  Principle  Investigators  for  these  partners  were,  respectively,  Bill
       Lorensen  at  GE  CRD, Will Schroeder at Kitware, Vikram Chalana at Insightful, Stephen Aylward with Luis
       Ibanez at UNC (Luis is now at Kitware), Ross Whitaker with Josh Cates at  UT  (both  now  at  Utah),  and
       Dimitri  Metaxas at UPenn. In addition, several subcontractors rounded out the consortium including Peter
       Raitu at Brigham &amp; Women's Hospital, Celina Imielinska and Pat Molholt at Columbia University, Jim Gee at
       UPenn's Grasp Lab, and George Stetton at University of Pittsburgh.
