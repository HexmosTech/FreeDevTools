</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       longjmp — non-local goto

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/setjmp.h">setjmp.h</a>&gt;

       void longjmp(jmp_buf <u>env</u>, int <u>val</u>);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  functionality  described  on  this  reference  page is aligned with the ISO C standard. Any conflict
       between the requirements described  here  and  the  ISO C  standard  is  unintentional.  This  volume  of
       POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO C standard.

       The  <u>longjmp</u>()  function shall restore the environment saved by the most recent invocation of <u>setjmp</u>() in
       the same process, with the corresponding <b>jmp_buf</b> argument. If the most recent invocation of <u>setjmp</u>() with
       the corresponding <b>jmp_buf</b> occurred in another thread, or if there  is  no  such  invocation,  or  if  the
       function  containing  the  invocation  of  <u>setjmp</u>()  has  terminated  execution in the interim, or if the
       invocation of <u>setjmp</u>() was within the scope of an identifier with variably modified  type  and  execution
       has  left  that  scope  in  the  interim, the behavior is undefined.  It is unspecified whether <u>longjmp</u>()
       restores the signal mask, leaves the signal mask unchanged, or restores it  to  its  value  at  the  time
       <u>setjmp</u>() was called.

       All  accessible  objects  have  values,  and all other components of the abstract machine have state (for
       example, floating-point status flags and open files), as of the time <u>longjmp</u>() was  called,  except  that
       the  values  of  objects  of  automatic  storage  duration are unspecified if they meet all the following
       conditions:

        *  They are local to the function containing the corresponding <u>setjmp</u>() invocation.

        *  They do not have volatile-qualified type.

        *  They are changed between the <u>setjmp</u>() invocation and <u>longjmp</u>() call.

       Although <u>longjmp</u>() is an async-signal-safe function, if  it  is  invoked  from  a  signal  handler  which
       interrupted  a  non-async-signal-safe function or equivalent (such as the processing equivalent to <u>exit</u>()
       performed after a return from the initial call to <u>main</u>()), the behavior of any subsequent call to a  non-
       async-signal-safe function or equivalent is undefined.

       The  effect of a call to <u>longjmp</u>() where initialization of the <b>jmp_buf</b> structure was not performed in the
       calling thread is undefined.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       After <u>longjmp</u>() is completed, program execution continues as if the corresponding invocation of  <u>setjmp</u>()
       had  just returned the value specified by <u>val</u>.  The <u>longjmp</u>() function shall not cause <u>setjmp</u>() to return
       0; if <u>val</u> is 0, <u>setjmp</u>() shall return 1.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       No errors are defined.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       Applications whose behavior depends on the value  of  the  signal  mask  should  not  use  <u>longjmp</u>()  and
       <u>setjmp</u>(),  since  their effect on the signal mask is unspecified, but should instead use the <u>siglongjmp</u>()
       and <u>sigsetjmp</u>() functions (which can save and restore the signal mask under application control).

       It is recommended that applications do not call <u>longjmp</u>() or <u>siglongjmp</u>() from signal handlers. To  avoid
       undefined  behavior  when  calling these functions from a signal handler, the application needs to ensure
       one of the following two things:

        1. After the call to <u>longjmp</u>() or <u>siglongjmp</u>() the process only calls  async-signal-safe  functions  and
           does not return from the initial call to <u>main</u>().

        2. Any signal whose handler calls <u>longjmp</u>() or <u>siglongjmp</u>() is blocked during <u>every</u> call to a non-async-
           signal-safe function, and no such calls are made after returning from the initial call to <u>main</u>().

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>FUTURE</b> <b>DIRECTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       <u>setjmp</u>(), <u>sigaction</u>(), <u>siglongjmp</u>(), <u>sigsetjmp</u>()
