       Smokeping::matchers::base - Base Class for implementing SmokePing Matchers

</pre><h4><b>OVERVIEW</b></h4><pre>
       This is the base class for writing SmokePing matchers. Every matcher must inherit from the base class and
       provide it's own methods for the 'business' logic.

       Note that the actual matchers must have at least one capital letter in their name, to differentiate them
       from the base class(es).

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Every matcher must provide the following methods:

   <b>new</b>
       The new method expects hash elements as an argument eg new({x=&gt;'\d+',y=&gt;'\d+'},x=&gt;1,y=&gt;2). The first part
       is a syntax rule for the arguments it should expect and the second part are the arguments itself. The
       first part will be supplied by the child class as it calls the parent method.

   <b>Length</b>
       The Length method returns the number of values the matcher will expect from SmokePing. This method must
       be overridden by the children of the base class.

   <b>Desc</b>
       Simply return the description of the function. This method must be overwritten by a children of the base
       class.

   <b>Test</b>
       Run the matcher and return true or false. The Test method is called with a hash containing two arrays
       giving it access to both rtt and loss values.

         my $data=shift;
         my @rtt = @{$data-&gt;{rtt}};
         my @loss = @{$data-&gt;{loss}};

       The arrays are ordered from old to new.

         @rdd[old..new]

       There may be more than the expected number of elements in this array. Address them with $x[-1] to
       $x[-max].

       There's also a key called 'prevmatch' in the hash. It contains the value returned by the previous call of
       the 'Test' method. This allows for somewhat more intelligent alerting due to state awareness.

         my $prevmatch = $data-&gt;{prevmatch};
