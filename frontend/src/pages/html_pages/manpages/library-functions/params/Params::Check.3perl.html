</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Params::Check is a generic input parsing/checking mechanism.

       It allows you to validate input via a template. The only requirement is that the arguments must be named.

       Params::Check can do the following things for you:

       •   Convert all keys to lowercase

       •   Check if all required arguments have been provided

       •   Set arguments that have not been provided to the default

       •   Weed out arguments that are not supported and warn about them to the user

       •   Validate the arguments given by the user based on strings, regexes, lists or even subroutines

       •   Enforce type integrity if required

       Most of Params::Check's power comes from its template, which we'll discuss below:

</pre><h4><b>Template</b></h4><pre>
       As you can see in the synopsis, based on your template, the arguments provided will be validated.

       The template can take a different set of rules per key that is used.

       The following rules are available:

       default
           This is the default value if none was provided by the user.  This is also the type "strict_type" will
           look at when checking type integrity (see below).

       required
           A boolean flag that indicates if this argument was a required argument. If marked as required and not
           provided, <b>check()</b> will fail.

       strict_type
           This  does  a ref() check on the argument provided. The "ref" of the argument must be the same as the
           "ref" of the default value for this check to pass.

           This is very useful if you insist on taking an array reference as argument for example.

       defined
           If this template key is true, enforces that if this key is provided  by  user  input,  its  value  is
           "defined".  This  just means that the user is not allowed to pass "undef" as a value for this key and
           is equivalent to:
               allow =&gt; sub { defined $_[0] &amp;&amp; OTHER TESTS }

       no_override
           This allows you to specify "constants" in your template. ie, they keys that are  not  allowed  to  be
           altered by the user. It pretty much allows you to keep all your "configurable" data in one place; the
           "Params::Check" template.

       store
           This allows you to pass a reference to a scalar, in which the data will be stored:

               my $x;
               my $args = check(foo =&gt; { default =&gt; 1, store =&gt; \$x }, $input);

           This is basically shorthand for saying:

               my $args = check( { foo =&gt; { default =&gt; 1 }, $input );
               my $x    = $args-&gt;{foo};

           You  can alter the global variable $Params::Check::NO_DUPLICATES to control whether the "store"'d key
           will still be present in your result set. See the "Global Variables" section below.

       allow
           A set of criteria used to validate a particular piece of data if  it  has  to  adhere  to  particular
           rules.

           See the allow() function for details.

</pre><h4><b>Functions</b></h4><pre>
   <b>check(</b> <b>\%tmpl,</b> <b>\%args,</b> <b>[$verbose]</b> <b>);</b>
       This function is not exported by default, so you'll have to ask for it via:

           use Params::Check qw[check];

       or use its fully qualified name instead.

       "check" takes a list of arguments, as follows:

       Template
           This  is  a  hash  reference  which contains a template as explained in the "SYNOPSIS" and "Template"
           section.

       Arguments
           This is a reference to a hash of named arguments which need checking.

       Verbose
           A boolean to indicate whether "check" should be verbose and warn about what went wrong in a check  or
           not.

           You  can  enable  this program wide by setting the package variable $Params::Check::VERBOSE to a true
           value. For details, see the section on "Global Variables" below.

       "check" will return when it fails, or a hashref with lowercase keys of parsed arguments when it succeeds.

       So a typical call to check would look like this:

           my $parsed = check( \%template, \%arguments, $VERBOSE )
                           or warn q[Arguments could not be parsed!];

       A lot of the behaviour of check() can be altered by setting package variables. See the section on "Global
       Variables" for details on this.

   <b>allow(</b> <b>$test_me,</b> <b>\@criteria</b> <b>);</b>
       The function that handles the "allow" key in the template is also available for independent use.

       The function takes as first argument a key to test against, and as second argument any form  of  criteria
       that are also allowed by the "allow" key in the template.

       You can use the following types of values for allow:

       string
           The provided argument MUST be equal to the string for the validation to pass.

       regexp
           The provided argument MUST match the regular expression for the validation to pass.

       subroutine
           The  provided  subroutine  MUST  return  true  in  order  for the validation to pass and the argument
           accepted.

           (This is particularly useful for more complicated data).

       array ref
           The provided argument MUST equal one of the elements of the array ref for the validation to pass.  An
           array ref can hold all the above values.

       It returns true if the key matched the criteria, or false otherwise.

   <b>last_error()</b>
       Returns a string containing all warnings and errors reported during the last time "check" was called.

       This is useful if you want to report then some other way than "carp"'ing when the verbose flag is on.

       It is exported upon request.

</pre><h4><b>Global</b> <b>Variables</b></h4><pre>
       The behaviour of Params::Check can be altered by changing the following global variables:

   <b>$Params::Check::VERBOSE</b>
       This  controls  whether  Params::Check  will issue warnings and explanations as to why certain things may
       have failed.  If you set it to 0, Params::Check will not output any warnings.

       The default is 1 when warnings are enabled, 0 otherwise;

   <b>$Params::Check::STRICT_TYPE</b>
       This works like the "strict_type" option you can pass  to  "check",  which  will  turn  on  "strict_type"
       globally for all calls to "check".

       The default is 0;

   <b>$Params::Check::ALLOW_UNKNOWN</b>
       If  you  set  this  flag, unknown options will still be present in the return value, rather than filtered
       out. This is useful if your subroutine is only interested in a few arguments, and wants to pass the  rest
       on blindly to perhaps another subroutine.

       The default is 0;

   <b>$Params::Check::STRIP_LEADING_DASHES</b>
       If you set this flag, all keys passed in the following manner:

           function( -key =&gt; 'val' );

       will have their leading dashes stripped.

   <b>$Params::Check::NO_DUPLICATES</b>
       If  set  to  true,  all  keys  in  the template that are marked as to be stored in a scalar, will also be
       removed from the result set.

       Default is false, meaning that when you use "store" as a template key, "check" will put it  both  in  the
       scalar you supplied, as well as in the hashref it returns.

   <b>$Params::Check::PRESERVE_CASE</b>
       If  set  to  true,  Params::Check  will  no longer convert all keys from the user input to lowercase, but
       instead expect them to be in the case the template provided. This is useful when you want to use  similar
       keys with different casing in your templates.

       Understand that this removes the case-insensitivity feature of this module.

       Default is 0;

   <b>$Params::Check::ONLY_ALLOW_DEFINED</b>
       If  set to true, Params::Check will require all values passed to be "defined". If you wish to enable this
       on a 'per key' basis, use the template option "defined" instead.

       Default is 0;

   <b>$Params::Check::SANITY_CHECK_TEMPLATE</b>
       If set to true, Params::Check will sanity check  templates,  validating  for  errors  and  unknown  keys.
       Although very useful for debugging, this can be somewhat slow in hot-code and large loops.

       To disable this check, set this variable to "false".

       Default is 1;

   <b>$Params::Check::WARNINGS_FATAL</b>
       If  set  to true, Params::Check will "croak" when an error during template validation occurs, rather than
       return "false".

       Default is 0;

   <b>$Params::Check::CALLER_DEPTH</b>
       This global modifies the argument given to caller() by Params::Check::check() and is useful if you have a
       custom wrapper function around Params::Check::check(). The value  must  be  an  integer,  indicating  the
       number of wrapper functions inserted between the real function call and Params::Check::check().

       Example wrapper function, using a custom stacktrace:

           sub check {
               my ($template, $args_in) = @_;

               local $Params::Check::WARNINGS_FATAL = 1;
               local $Params::Check::CALLER_DEPTH = $Params::Check::CALLER_DEPTH + 1;
               my $args_out = Params::Check::check($template, $args_in);

               my_stacktrace(Params::Check::last_error) unless $args_out;

               return $args_out;
           }

       Default is 0;
