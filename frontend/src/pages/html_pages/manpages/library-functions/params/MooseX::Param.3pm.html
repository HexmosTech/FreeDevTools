</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       MooseX::Param - Simple role to provide a standard param method

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         package My::Template::System;
         use Moose;

         with 'MooseX::Param';

         # ...

         my $template = My::Template::System-&gt;new(
             params =&gt; {
                 foo =&gt; 10,
                 bar =&gt; 20,
                 baz =&gt; 30,
             }
         );

         # fetching params
         $template-&gt;param('foo'); # 10

         # getting list of params
         $template-&gt;param(); # foo, bar, baz

         # setting params
         $template-&gt;param(foo =&gt; 30, bar =&gt; 100);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This is a very simple Moose role which provides a CGI like "param" method.

       I found that I had written this code over and over and over and over again, and each time it was the
       same. So I thought, why not put it in a role?

</pre><h4><b>ATTRIBUTES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>params</u>
           This  role  provides  a  "params"  attribute  which  has  a  read-only  accessor,  and a HashRef type
           constraint. It also adds a builder method (see "init_params" method below) to properly initialize it.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>params</b>
           Return the HASH ref in which the parameters are stored.

       <b>param</b>
           This is your standard CGI style "param" method. If passed no arguments, it  will  return  a  list  of
           param  names. If passed a single name argument it will return the param associated with that name. If
           passed a key value pair (or set of key value pairs) it will assign them into the params.

       <u>init_params</u>
           This is the <u>params</u> attribute "builder" option, so it is called the params are initialized.

           <b>NOTE:</b> You can override this by defining your own version in your class, because local  class  methods
           beat role methods in composition.

       <b>meta</b>
           Returns the role metaclass.

</pre><h4><b>SIMILAR</b> <b>MODULES</b></h4><pre>
       The  "param"  method  can  be  found  in  several  other  modules,  such  as  CGI,  CGI::Application  and
       HTML::Template to name a few. This is such a common Perl idiom that I felt it really  deserved  it's  own
       role (if for nothing more than I was sick of re-writing and copy-pasting it all the time).

       There are also a few modules which attempt to solve the same problem as this module. Those are:

       Class::Param
           This  module is much more ambitious than mine, and provides much deeper functionality. For most of my
           purposes, this module would have been overkill, but if you need really sophisticated  param  handling
           and the ability to provide several different APIs (tied, etc), this module is probably the way to go.

       Mixin::ExtraFields::Param
           This   module  is  very  similar  to  mine,  but  for  a  different  framework.  It  works  with  the
           Mixin::ExtraFields framework.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       All complex software has bugs lurking in it, and this module is no exception. If you find  a  bug  please
       either email me, or add the bug to cpan-RT.
