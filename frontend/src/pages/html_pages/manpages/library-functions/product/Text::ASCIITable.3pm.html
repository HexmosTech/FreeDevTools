</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Text::ASCIITable - Create a nice formatted table using ASCII characters.

</pre><h4><b>SHORT</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Pretty nifty if you want to output dynamic text to your console or other fixed-size-font displays, and at
       the same time it will display it in a nice human-readable, or "cool" way.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Text::ASCIITable;
         $t = Text::ASCIITable-&gt;new({ headingText =&gt; 'Basket' });

         $t-&gt;setCols('Id','Name','Price');
         $t-&gt;addRow(1,'Dummy product 1',24.4);
         $t-&gt;addRow(2,'Dummy product 2',21.2);
         $t-&gt;addRow(3,'Dummy product 3',12.3);
         $t-&gt;addRowLine();
         $t-&gt;addRow('','Total',57.9);
         print $t;

         # Result:
         .------------------------------.
         |            Basket            |
         +----+-----------------+-------+
         | Id | Name            | Price |
         +----+-----------------+-------+
         |  1 | Dummy product 1 |  24.4 |
         |  2 | Dummy product 2 |  21.2 |
         |  3 | Dummy product 3 |  12.3 |
         +----+-----------------+-------+
         |    | Total           |  57.9 |
         '----+-----------------+-------'

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>new(options)</b>
       Initialize a new table. You can specify output-options. For more options, check out the usage for
       <b>setOptions()</b>

         Usage:
         $t = Text::ASCIITable-&gt;new();

         Or with options:
         $t = Text::ASCIITable-&gt;new({ hide_Lastline =&gt; 1, reportErrors =&gt; 0});

   <b>setCols(@cols)</b>
       Define the columns for the table(compare with &lt;TH&gt; in HTML). For example "setCols(['Id','Nick','Name'])".
       <b>Note</b> that you cannot add Cols after you have added a row. Multiline columnnames are allowed.

   <b>addRow(@collist)</b>
       Adds one row to the table. This must be an array of strings. If you defined 3 columns. This array must
       have 3 items in it. And so on. Should be self explanatory. The strings can contain newlines.

         Note: It does not require argument to be an array, thus;
         $t-&gt;addRow(['id','name']) and $t-&gt;addRow('id','name') does the same thing.

       This module is also overloaded to accept push. To construct a table with the use of overloading you might
       do the following:

         $t = Text::ASCIITable-&gt;new();
         $t-&gt;setCols('one','two','three','four');
         push @$t, ( "one\ntwo" ) x 4; # Replaces $t-&gt;addrow();
         print $t;                     # Replaces print $t-&gt;draw();

         Which would construct:
          .-----+-----+-------+------.
          | one | two | three | four |
          |=----+-----+-------+-----=|
          | one | one | one   | one  |  # Note that theese two lines
          | two | two | two   | two  |  # with text are one singe row.
          '-----+-----+-------+------'

       There is also possible to give this function an array of arrayrefs and hence support the output from
       DBI::selectall_arrayref($sql) without changes.

         Example of multiple-rows pushing:
         $t-&gt;addRow([
           [ 1, 2, 3 ],
           [ 4, 5, 6 ],
           [ 7, 8, 9 ],
         ]);

   <b>addRowLine([$row])</b>
       Will add a line after the current row. As an argument, you may specify after which row you want a line
       (first row is 1) or an array of row numbers. (HINT: If you want a line after every row, read about the
       drawRowLine option in <b>setOptions()</b>)

       Example without arguments:
         $t-&gt;addRow('one','two','three');
         $t-&gt;<b>addRowLine()</b>;
         $t-&gt;addRow('one','two','three');

       Example with argument:
         $t-&gt;addRow('one','two','three');
         $t-&gt;addRow('one','two','three');
         $t-&gt;addRow('one','two','three');
         $t-&gt;addRow('one','two','three');
         $t-&gt;<b><a href="../man1/addRowLine.1.html">addRowLine</a></b>(1); # or multiple: $t-&gt;addRowLine([2,3]);

   <b>alignCol($col,$direction)</b> <b>or</b> <b>alignCol({col1</b> <b>=&gt;</b> <b>direction1,</b> <b>col2</b> <b>=&gt;</b> <b>direction2,</b> <b>...</b> <b>})</b>
       Given a columnname, it aligns all data to the given direction in the table. This looks nice on numerical
       displays in a column. The column names in the table will be unaffected by the alignment. Possible
       directions is: left, center, right, justify, auto or your own subroutine. (Hint: Using auto(default),
       aligns numbers right and text left)

   <b>alignColName($col,$direction)</b>
       Given a columnname, it aligns the columnname in the row explaining columnnames, to the given direction.
       (auto,left,right,center,justify or a subroutine) (Hint: Overrides the 'alignHeadRow' option for the
       specified column.)

   <b>setColWidth($col,$width,$strict)</b>
       Wordwrapping/strict size. Set a max-width(in chars) for a column.  If last parameter is 1, the column
       will be set to the specified width, even if no text is that long.

        Usage:
         $t-&gt;setColWidth('Description',30);

   <b>getTableWidth()</b>
       If you need to know how wide your table will be before you draw it. Use this function.

   <b>setOptions(name,value)</b> <b>or</b> <b>setOptions({</b> <b>option1</b> <b>=&gt;</b> <b>value1,</b> <b>option2</b> <b>=&gt;</b> <b>value2,</b> <b>...</b> <b>})</b>
       Use this to set options like: hide_FirstLine,reportErrors, etc.

         Usage:
         $t-&gt;setOptions('hide_HeadLine',1);

         Or set more than one option on the fly:
         $t-&gt;setOptions({ hide_HeadLine =&gt; 1, hide_HeadRow =&gt; 1 });

       <b>Possible</b> <b>Options</b>

       hide_HeadRow
           Hides  output  of  the  columnlisting.  Together with hide_HeadLine, this makes a table only show the
           rows. (However, even though the column-names will not be shown, they will affect the output  if  they
           have  for example ridiculoustly long names, and the rows contains small amount of info. You would end
           up with a lot of whitespace)

       reportErrors
           Set to 0 to disable error reporting. Though if a function encounters an error, it will  still  return
           the value 1, to tell you that things didn't go exactly as they should.

       allowHTML
           If  you  are going to use Text::ASCIITable to be shown on HTML pages, you should set this option to 1
           when you are going to use HTML tags to for example color the text inside the rows, and you  want  the
           browser to handle the table correct.

       allowANSI
           If you use ANSI codes like &lt;ESC&gt;[1mHi this is bold&lt;ESC&gt;[m or similar. This option will make the table
           to  be  displayed correct when showed in a ANSI compliant terminal. Set this to 1 to enable. There is
           an example of ANSI support in this package, named ansi-example.pl.

       alignHeadRow
           Set which direction the Column-names(in the headrow) are supposed to  point.  Must  be  left,  right,
           center, justify, auto or a user-defined subroutine.

       hide_FirstLine, hide_HeadLine, hide_LastLine
           Speaks for it self?

       drawRowLine
           Set  this  to 1 to print a line between each row. You can also define the outputstyle of this line in
           the <b>draw()</b> function.

       headingText
           Add a heading above the columnnames/rows which uses  the  whole  width  of  the  table  to  output  a
           heading/title to the table. The heading-part of the table is automatically shown when the headingText
           option  contains  text.  <b>Note:</b>  If  this  text  is so long that it makes the table wider, it will not
           hesitate to change width of columns that have "strict width".

           It supports multiline, and with Text::ASCIITable::Wrap you may wrap your text before entering it,  to
           prevent  the  title from expanding the table. Internal wrapping-support for headingText might come in
           the future.

       headingAlign
           Align the heading(as mentioned above) to left, right, center, auto or using a subroutine.

       headingStartChar, headingStopChar
           Choose the startingchar and endingchar of the row where the title is. The default is '|' on both.  If
           you didn't understand this, try reading about the <b>draw()</b> function.

       cb_count
           Set  the callback subroutine to use when counting characters inside the table. This is useful to make
           support for having characters or codes inside the table that are not shown on the screen to the user,
           so the table should not count these characters. This could be for example HTML tags, or  ANSI  codes.
           Though  those two examples are alredy supported internally with the allowHTML and allowANSI, options.
           This option expects a CODE reference. (\&amp;callback_function)

       undef_as
           Sets the replacing string that replaces an undef value sent to <b>addRow()</b> (or even the overloaded  push
           version  of  <b>addRow()</b>). The default value is an empty string ''. An example of use would be to set it
           to '(undef)', to show that the input really was undefined.

       chaining
           Set this to 1 to support chainging of methods. The default is 0, where the methods return 1  if  they
           come upon an error as mentioned in the reportErrors option description.

             Usage example:
             print Text::ASCIITable-&gt;new({ chaining =&gt; 1 })
               -&gt;setCols('One','Two','Three')
               -&gt;addRow([
                 [ 1, 2, 3 ],
                 [ 4, 5, 6 ],
                 [ 7, 8, 9 ],
                 ])
               -&gt;draw();

           Note  that  -&gt;<b>draw()</b>  can  be  omitted,  since  Text::ASCIITable  is overloaded to print the table by
           default.

   <b>draw([@topdesign,@toprow,@middle,@middlerow,@bottom,@rowline])</b>
       All the arrays containing the layout is optional. If you want to make your own "design" to the table, you
       can do that by giving this method these arrays containing  information  about  which  characters  to  use
       where.

       <b>Custom</b> <b>tables</b>

       The draw method takes 6 arrays of strings to define the layout. The first, third, fifth and sixth is <b>LINE</b>
       layout  and  the  second and fourth is <b>ROW</b> layout. The "fourth" parameter is repeated for each row in the
       table.  The sixth parameter is only used if drawRowLine is enabled.

        $t-&gt;draw(&lt;LINE&gt;,&lt;ROW&gt;,&lt;LINE&gt;,&lt;ROW&gt;,&lt;LINE&gt;,[&lt;ROWLINE&gt;])

       LINE
           Takes an array of 4 strings. For example "['|','|','-','+']"

           •   LEFT - Defines the left chars. May be more than one char.

           •   RIGHT - Defines the right chars. May be more then one char.

           •   LINE - Defines the char used for the line. <b>Must</b> <b>be</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>char</b>.

           •   DELIMETER - Defines the char used for the delimiters. <b>Must</b> <b>be</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>char</b>.

       ROW Takes an array of 3 strings. You should not give more than one char to any of  these  parameters,  if
           you do.. it will probably destroy the output.. Unless you do it with the knowledge of how it will end
           up. An example: "['|','|','+']"

           •   LEFT - Define the char used for the left side of the table.

           •   RIGHT - Define the char used for the right side of the table.

           •   DELIMETER - Defines the char used for the delimiters.

       Examples:

       The easiest way:

        print $t;

       Explanatory example:

        print $t-&gt;draw( ['L','R','l','D'],  # LllllllDllllllR
                        ['L','R','D'],      # L info D info R
                        ['L','R','l','D'],  # LllllllDllllllR
                        ['L','R','D'],      # L info D info R
                        ['L','R','l','D']   # LllllllDllllllR
                       );

       Nice example:

        print $t-&gt;draw( ['.','.','-','-'],   # .-------------.
                        ['|','|','|'],       # | info | info |
                        ['|','|','-','-'],   # |-------------|
                        ['|','|','|'],       # | info | info |
                        [' \\','/ ','_','|'] #  \_____|_____/
                       );

       Nice example2:

        print $t-&gt;draw( ['.=','=.','-','-'],   # .=-----------=.
                        ['|','|','|'],         # | info | info |
                        ['|=','=|','-','+'],   # |=-----+-----=|
                        ['|','|','|'],         # | info | info |
                        ["'=","='",'-','-']    # '=-----------='
                       );

       With Options:

        $t-&gt;setOptions('drawRowLine',1);
        print $t-&gt;draw( ['.=','=.','-','-'],   # .=-----------=.
                        ['|','|','|'],         # | info | info |
                        ['|-','-|','=','='],   # |-===========-|
                        ['|','|','|'],         # | info | info |
                        ["'=","='",'-','-'],   # '=-----------='
                        ['|=','=|','-','+']    # rowseperator
                       );
        Which makes this output:
          .=-----------=.
          | col1 | col2 |
          |-===========-|
          | info | info |
          |=-----+-----=| &lt;-- rowseperator between each row
          | info | info |
          '=-----------='

       A  tips  is  to enable allowANSI, and use the extra charset in your terminal to create a beautiful table.
       But don't expect to get good results if you use ANSI-formatted table with $t-&gt;drawPage.

       <b>User-defined</b> <b>subroutines</b> <b>for</b> <b>aligning</b>

       If you want to format your text more throughoutly than "auto", or think you have a better way of aligning
       text; you can make your own subroutine.

         Here's a exampleroutine that aligns the text to the right.

         sub myownalign_cb {
           my ($text,$length,$count,$strict) = @_;
           $text = (" " x ($length - $count)) . $text;
           return substr($text,0,$length) if ($strict);
           return $text;
         }

         $t-&gt;alignCol('Info',\&amp;myownalign_cb);

       <b>User-defined</b> <b>subroutines</b> <b>for</b> <b>counting</b>

       This is a feature to use if you are not happy with the internal allowHTML or allowANSI support. Given  is
       an  example  of  how you make a count-callback that makes ASCIITable support ANSI codes inside the table.
       (would make the same result as setting allowANSI to 1)

         $t-&gt;setOptions('cb_count',\&amp;myallowansi_cb);
         sub myallowansi_cb {
           $_=shift;
           s/\33\[(\d+(;\d+)?)?[musfwhojBCDHRJK]//g;
           return length($_);
         }

   <b>drawPage($page,@topdesign,@toprow,@middle,@middlerow,@bottom,@rowline)</b>
       If  you  don't  want  your  table  to   be   wider   than   your   screen   you   can   use   this   with
       $t-&gt;setOptions('outputWidth',40) to set the max size of the output.

       Example:

         $t-&gt;setOptions('outputWidth',80);
         for my $page (1..$t-&gt;pageCount()) {
           print $t-&gt;drawPage($page)."\n";
           print "continued..\n\n";
         }

</pre><h4><b>FEATURES</b></h4><pre>
       In  case you need to know if this module has what you need, I have made this list of features included in
       Text::ASCIITable.

       Configurable layout
           You can easily alter how the table should look, in many ways. There are a few examples in the  <b>draw()</b>
           section  of  this documentation. And you can remove parts of the layout or even add a heading-part to
           the table.

       Text Aligning
           Align the text in a column <a href="../manmatically/auto.matically.html">auto</a>(matically), left, right, center or justify. Usually you want to align
           text to right if you only have numbers in that row. The 'auto' direction aligns  text  to  left,  and
           numbers  to the right. The 'justify' alignment evens out your text on each line, so the first and the
           last word always are at the beginning and the end of the current line. This gives you  the  newspaper
           paragraph look.  You can also use your own subroutine as a callback-function to align your text.

       Multiline support in rows
           With  the  \n(ewline)  character  you  can have rows use more than just one line on the output. (This
           looks nice with the drawRowLine option enabled)

       Wordwrap support
           You can set a column to not be wider than a set amount of characters. If a line exceedes for  example
           30 characters, the line will be broken up in several lines.

       HTML support
           If  you  put  in  &lt;HTML&gt;  tags  inside  the rows, the output would usually be broken when viewed in a
           browser, since the browser "execute" the tags instead of displaying it.  But if you enable allowHTML.
           You are able to write html tags inside the rows without the output being broken if you display it  in
           a browser. But you should not mix this with wordwrap, since this could make undesirable results.

       ANSI support
           Allows  you  to  decorate your tables with colors or bold/underline when you display your tables to a
           terminal window.

       Page-flipping support
           If you don't want the table to get wider than your terminal-width.

       Errorreporting
           If you write a script in perl, and don't  want  users  to  be  notified  of  the  errormessages  from
           Text::ASCIITable.  You  can  easily  turn  of error reporting by setting reportErrors to 0.  You will
           still get an 1 instead of undef returned from the function.
