</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       SSL_connect - initiate the TLS/SSL handshake with an TLS/SSL server

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        #include &lt;openssl/ssl.h&gt;

        int SSL_connect(SSL *ssl);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>SSL_connect()</b> initiates the TLS/SSL handshake with a server. The communication channel must already have
       been set and assigned to the <b>ssl</b> by setting an underlying <b>BIO</b>. <b>ssl</b> <b>MUST</b> <b>NOT</b> be NULL.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       The behaviour of <b>SSL_connect()</b> depends on the underlying BIO.

       If the underlying BIO is <b>blocking</b>, <b>SSL_connect()</b> will only return once the handshake has been finished or
       an error occurred.

       If the underlying BIO is <b>nonblocking</b>, <b>SSL_connect()</b> will also return when the underlying BIO could not
       satisfy the needs of <b>SSL_connect()</b> to continue the handshake, indicating the problem by the return value
       -1.  In this case a call to <b>SSL_get_error()</b> with the return value of <b>SSL_connect()</b> will yield
       <b>SSL_ERROR_WANT_READ</b> or <b>SSL_ERROR_WANT_WRITE</b>. The calling process then must repeat the call after taking
       appropriate action to satisfy the needs of <b>SSL_connect()</b>.  The action depends on the underlying BIO. When
       using a nonblocking socket, nothing is to be done, but <b>select()</b> can be used to check for the required
       condition. When using a buffering BIO, like a BIO pair, data must be written into or retrieved out of the
       BIO before being able to continue.

       Many systems implement Nagle's algorithm by default which means that it will buffer outgoing TCP data if
       a TCP packet has already been sent for which no corresponding ACK has been received yet from the peer.
       This can have performance impacts after a successful TLSv1.3 handshake or a successful TLSv1.2 (or below)
       resumption handshake, because the last peer to communicate in the handshake is the client. If the client
       is also the first to send application data (as is typical for many protocols) then this data could be
       buffered until an ACK has been received for the final handshake message.

       The <b>TCP_NODELAY</b> socket option is often available to disable Nagle's algorithm. If an application opts to
       disable Nagle's algorithm consideration should be given to turning it back on again later if appropriate.
       The helper function <b>BIO_set_tcp_ndelay()</b> can be used to turn on or off the <b>TCP_NODELAY</b> option.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUES</b></h4><pre>
       The following return values can occur:

       0   The  TLS/SSL  handshake  was not successful but was shut down controlled and by the specifications of
           the TLS/SSL protocol. Call <b>SSL_get_error()</b> with the return value <b>ret</b> to find out the reason.

       1   The TLS/SSL handshake was successfully completed, a TLS/SSL connection has been established.

       &lt;0  The TLS/SSL handshake was not successful, because a fatal error occurred either at the protocol level
           or a connection failure occurred. The shutdown was not clean. It can also occur if action  is  needed
           to  continue  the  operation  for nonblocking BIOs. Call <b>SSL_get_error()</b> with the return value <b>ret</b> to
           find out the reason.
