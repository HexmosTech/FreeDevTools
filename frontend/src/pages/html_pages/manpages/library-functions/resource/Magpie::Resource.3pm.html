</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Magpie::Resource - Abstract base class for all resource types;

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 1.163200

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
          A resource is not the thing that is transferred across the wire or picked
          up off the disk or seen from afar while walking your dog. Each of those is
          only a representation. The same is true of physical objects encountered in
          life and never identified with URI and never made accessible on the net.
          Yes, it does present a bit of a quandary, but it is one that we have all
          learned to live with. Our eyes are not powerful enough to see identity
          through the representations, but our minds are powerful enough to associate
          identity to that which we see. Do I think of a different identifier every
          time I see my dog, or do I simply think of my dog as one identity and
          experience many representations of that identity over time (and on into
          memory and imagination)?
