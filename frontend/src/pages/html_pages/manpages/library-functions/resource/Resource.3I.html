       Resource - shared object

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;InterViews/resource.h&gt;</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Resource</b> is a class that provides a simple form of reference counting for shared objects.  Every resource
       has  a reference count that is initially set to zero and must be explicitly incremented through a call to
       Reference.  A resource should not be deleted like other objects;  instead,  the  static  member  function
       unref should be used to unreference the object.

       When  a  resource  is unreferenced, the reference count is decremented unless it is already zero.  If the
       count is zero, the object is destroyed.

</pre><h4><b>PUBLIC</b> <b>OPERATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Resource()</b>
              Create a new resource object with its reference count set to zero.

       <b>void</b> <b>ref()</b>
              Increment the resource's reference count.

       <b>void</b> <b>unref()</b>
              Decrement the resource's reference count, if it is positive, and delete this if the count is zero.

       <b>static</b> <b>void</b> <b>ref(Resource*)</b>
              If the resource is not nil, call ref on it.  Otherwise do nothing.

       <b>static</b> <b>void</b> <b>unref(Resource*)</b>
              If the resource is not nil, call unref on it.  Otherwise do nothing.

       <b>void</b> <b>Reference()</b>
              This function is equivalent to ref and is provided solely for backward compatibility.  It will  be
              removed in a future version.

       <b>void</b> <b>Unreference()</b>
              This  function  is equivalent to unref and is provided solely for backward compatibility.  It will
              be removed in a future version.

</pre><h4><b>FRIEND</b> <b>OPERATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>void</b> <b>Unref(Resource*)</b>
              This function is equivalent to static unref and is provided solely for backward compatibility.  It
              will be removed in a future version.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       This scheme relies on manual referencing, which is more efficient, but also more dangerous.

       When garbage collection is supported by the runtime system, resources will be unnecessary.
