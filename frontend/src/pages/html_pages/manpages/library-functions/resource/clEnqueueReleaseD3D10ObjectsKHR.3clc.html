       clEnqueueReleaseD3D10ObjectsKHR - Release OpenCL memory objects that have been created from Direct3D 10
       resources.

       <b>cl_int</b> <b>clEnqueueReleaseD3D10ObjectsKHR(cl_command_queue</b> <u>command_queue</u><b>,</b> <b>cl_uint</b> <u>num_objects</u><b>,</b>
                                              <b>const</b> <b>cl_mem</b> <b>*</b><u>mem_objects</u><b>,</b> <b>cl_uint</b> <u>num_events_in_wait_list</u><b>,</b>

</pre><h4><b>PARAMETERS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>num_objects</u>
           The number of memory objects to be released in <u>mem_objects</u>.

       <u>mem_objects</u>
           A pointer to a list of OpenCL memory objects that were created from Direct3D 10 resources.

       <u>num_events_in_wait_list</u>, <u>event_wait_list</u>
           Specify events that need to complete before this particular command can be executed. If
           <u>event_wait_list</u> is NULL, then this particular command does not wait on any event to complete. If
           <u>event_wait_list</u> is NULL, <u>num_events_in_wait_list</u> must be 0. If <u>event_wait_list</u> is not NULL, the list
           of events pointed to by <u>event_wait_list</u> must be valid and <u>num_events_in_wait_list</u> must be greater
           than 0. The events specified in <u>event</u> returns an event object that identifies this particular command
           and can be used to query or queue a wait for this particular command to complete.  <u>event</u> can be NULL
           in which case it will not be possible for the application to query the status of this command or
           queue a wait for this command to complete. If the <u>event_wait_list</u> and the <u>event</u> arguments are not
           NULL, the <u>event</u> argument should not refer to an element of the <u>event_wait_list</u> array.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       The Direct3D 10 objects are released by the OpenCL context associated with <u>command_queue</u>.

       OpenCL memory objects created from Direct3D 10 resources which have been acquired by OpenCL must be
       released by OpenCL before they may be accessed by Direct3D 10. Accessing a Direct3D 10 resource while its
       corresponding OpenCL memory object is acquired is in error and will result in undefined behavior,
       including but not limited to possible OpenCL errors, data corruption, and program termination.

       If <b>CL_CONTEXT_INTEROP_USER_SYNC</b> is not specified as <b>CL_TRUE</b> during context creation,
       <b>clEnqueueReleaseD3D10ObjectsKHR</b> provides the synchronization guarantee that any calls to Direct3D 10
       calls involving the interop device(s) used in the OpenCL context made after the call to
       <b>clEnqueueReleaseD3D10ObjectsKHR</b> will not start executing until after all events in <u>event_wait_list</u> are
       complete and all work already submitted to <u>command_queue</u> completes execution. If the context was created
       with properties specifying <b>CL_CONTEXT_INTEROP_USER_SYNC</b> as <b>CL_TRUE</b>, the user is responsible for
       guaranteeing that any Direct3D 10 calls involving the interop device(s) used in the OpenCL context made
       after <b>clEnqueueReleaseD3D10ObjectsKHR</b> will not start executing until after event returned by
       <b>clEnqueueReleaseD3D10ObjectsKHR</b> reports completion.

       General information about sharing memory objects with Direct3D 10 follows.

       The goal of this extension is to provide interoperability between OpenCL and Direct3D 10. This is
       designed to function analogously to the OpenGL interoperability. If this extension is supported by an
       implementation, the string "cl_khr_d3d10_sharing" will be present in the <b>CL_PLATFORM_EXTENSIONS</b> or
       <b>CL_DEVICE_EXTENSIONS</b> string described in the table of allowed values for <u>param_name</u> for
       <b><a href="../man3clc/clGetDeviceInfo.3clc.html">clGetDeviceInfo</a></b>(3clc).

       As currently proposed, the interfaces for this extension would be provided in cl_d3d10.h.

       This section discusses OpenCL functions that allow applications to use Direct3D 10 resources as OpenCL
       memory objects. This allows efficient sharing of data between OpenCL and Direct3D 10. The OpenCL API may
       be used to execute kernels that read and/or write memory objects that are also Direct3D 10 resources. An
       OpenCL image object may be created from a Direct3D 10 texture resource. An OpenCL buffer object may be
       created from a Direct3D 10 buffer resource. OpenCL memory objects may be created from Direct3D 10 objects
       if and only if the OpenCL context has been created from a Direct3D 10 device.  Lifetime of Shared
       Objects.PP An OpenCL memory object created from a Direct3D 10 resource remains valid as long as the
       corresponding Direct3D 10 resource has not been deleted. If the Direct3D 10 resource is deleted through
       the Direct3D 10 API, subsequent use of the OpenCL memory object will result in undefined behavior,
       including but not limited to possible OpenCL errors, data corruption, and program termination.

       The successful creation of a cl_context against a Direct3D 10 device specified via the context create
       parameter <b>CL_CONTEXT_D3D10_DEVICE_KHR</b> will increment the internal Direct3D reference count on the
       specified Direct3D 10 device. The internal Direct3D reference count on that Direct3D 10 device will be
       decremented when the OpenCL reference count on the returned OpenCL context drops to zero.

       The OpenCL context and corresponding command-queues are dependent on the existence of the Direct3D 10
       device from which the OpenCL context was created. If the Direct3D 10 device is deleted through the
       Direct3D 10 API, subsequent use of the OpenCL context will result in undefined behavior, including but
       not limited to possible OpenCL errors, data corruption, and program termination.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       Returns CL_SUCCESS returns CL_SUCCESS if the function is executed successfully. If &lt;<u>num_objects</u>&gt; is 0 and
       &lt;<u>mem_objects</u>&gt; is NULL then the function does nothing and returns CL_SUCCESS. Otherwise it returns one of
       the following errors:

       •   CL_INVALID_VALUE if <u>num_objects</u> is zero and <u>mem_objects</u> is not a NULL value or if <u>num_objects</u> &gt; 0 and
           <u>mem_objects</u> is NULL.

       •   CL_INVALID_MEM_OBJECT if memory objects in <u>mem_objects</u> are not valid OpenCL memory objects or if
           memory objects in <u>mem_objects</u> have not been created from Direct3D 10 resources.

       •   CL_INVALID_COMMAND_QUEUE if <u>command_queue</u> is not a valid command-queue.

       •   CL_INVALID_CONTEXT if context associated with <u>command_queue</u> was not created from an Direct3D 10
           context.

       •   CL_D3D10_RESOURCE_NOT_ACQUIRED_KHR if memory objects in mem_objects have not previously been acquired
           using <b>clEnqueueAcquireD3D10ObjectsKHR</b>, or have been released using <b>clEnqueueReleaseD3D10ObjectsKHR</b>
           since the last time that they were acquired.

       •   CL_INVALID_EVENT_WAIT_LIST if <u>event_wait_list</u> is NULL and <u>num_event_in_wait_list</u> &gt; 0, or
           <u>event_wait_list</u> is  not NULL and <u>num_event_in_wait_list</u> is 0, or if event objects in <u>event_wait_list</u>
           are not valid events.

       •   CL_OUT_OF_HOST_MEMORY if there is a failure to allocate resources required by the OpenCL
           implementation on the host.
