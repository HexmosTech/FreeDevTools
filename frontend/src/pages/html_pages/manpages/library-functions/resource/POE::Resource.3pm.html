       POE::Resource - internal resource managers for POE::Kernel

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       Varies, although most POE::Resource subclasses do not have public APIs.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       POE manages several types of information internally.  Its Resource classes are mix-ins designed to manage
       those types of information behind tidy, mostly private interfaces.  This was done to facilitate testing
       and a conversion to C without the need to port POE::Kernel all at once.

       POE::Resource subclasses are generally different from one another, but there are some similarities to
       note.

       Every resource should have an initializer and finalizer method.  Initializers set up initial data and
       link resources into POE::Kernel.  Finalizers clean up any remaining data and verify that each resource
       subsystem was left in a consistent state.

       One common theme in resource implementations is that they don't need to perform much error checking, if
       any.  Resource methods are used internally by POE::Kernel and/or POE::API classes, so it's up to them to
       ensure correct usage.

       Resource methods follow the naming convention _data_???_activity, where ??? is an abbreviation for the
       type of resource it belongs to:

         POE::Resource::Events      _data_ev_initialize
         POE::Resource::FileHandles _data_handle_initialize
         POE::Resource::Signals     _data_sig_initialize

       Finalizer methods end in "_finalize".

         _data_ev_finalize
         _data_handle_finalize
         _data_sig_finalize

       Finalizers return true if a resource shut down cleanly, or false if there were inconsistencies or leaks
       during end-of-run checking.  The t/res/*.t tests rely on these return values.
