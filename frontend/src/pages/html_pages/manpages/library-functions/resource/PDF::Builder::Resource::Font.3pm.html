   <b>automap</b>
           $font-&gt;automap()

           This applies to core fonts ("$pdf-&gt;corefont()") and PostScript fonts ("$pdf-&gt;psfont()"). These cannot
           use UTF-8 (or other multibyte character) encoded text; only single byte characters. This limits a
           font to a maximum of 256 glyphs (the "standard" single-byte encoding being used). Any other glyphs
           supplied with the font are inaccessible.

           "automap" splits a font containing more than 256 glyphs into "planes" of single byte fonts of up to
           256 glyphs, so that all glyphs may be accessed in separate "fonts". An array of new fonts will be
           returned, with [0] being the standard code page (of the selected encoding). If there are any glyphs
           beyond xFF on the standard encoding page, they will be returned in one or more additional fonts of
           223 glyphs each. <u>Why</u> <u>223?</u> The first 32 are reserved as control characters (although they have no
           glyphs), and number x20 is a space. This, plus 223, gives 256 in total (the last plane may have fewer
           than 223 glyphs). These "fonts" are temporary (dynamic), though as usable as any other font.

           Note that a plane may be <b>empty</b> (only <u>space</u> at x20 and possibly an unusable character at x21) if the
           previous plane was full. You might want to check if any character in the plane has a Unicode value
           (if not, it's empty).

           The <u>ordering</u> of these 223 glyphs in each following plane does <u>not</u> appear to follow any particular
           official scheme, so be sure to reference something like "examples/020_corefonts" to see what is
           available, and what code point a glyph is at (e.g., an 'A' in the text stream will print something
           different if you're not on plane 0). For a given font <b>file</b>, they should be <u>consistent</u>. For instance,
           in Times-Roman core font, an \x21 or ! in plane[1] should always give an A+macron. Further note that
           new editions of font files released in the future may have changes to the glyph list and the ordering
           (affecting which plane a glyph appears on), so use <b>automap()</b> with caution. It appears that glyphs are
           sorted by Unicode number, but if a new glyph is inserted, it would bump other glyphs to new
           positions, and even to the next plane.

           An example:

               $fnt = $pdf-&gt;corefont('Times-Roman', 'encode' =&gt; 'latin1');
               @planes = ($fnt, $fnt-&gt;automap());  # two planes
               $text-&gt;font($planes[0], 15);  # or just $fnt will work
               $text-&gt;text('!');  # prints !
               $text-&gt;font($planes[1], 15);
               $text-&gt;text('!');  # prints A+macron

           If you had used 'latin2' encoding, an \x21 on plane 1 will give an inverted !  (&amp;iexcl; HTML entity).

           Note that "$planes[$n]-&gt;fontname()" should always be the desired base font (e.g., <u>Times-Roman</u>), while
           "$planes[$n]-&gt;name()" will be the font ID (e.g., <u>TiRoCBC</u>) for plane 0, while for other planes there
           will be a unique suffix added (e.g., <u>TiRoCBCam0</u>).

           If you have just an occasional non-plane 0 character (or run of characters), it may be tolerable to
           switch back and forth between planes like this, just as typing an HTML entity once in a while when
           you need a Greek letter on a web page is acceptable to most people. However, if you're typing a lot
           of Greek text, a dedicated keyboard may be better for you. Like that, switching to a TTF font in
           order to be able to use UTF-8 may be easier.
