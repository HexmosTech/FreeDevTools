       PDF::Builder::Resource::XObject::Image - Base class for external raster image objects

       Inherits from PDF::Builder::Resource::XObject

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>new</b>
           $image = PDF::Builder::Resource::XObject::Image-&gt;new($pdf, $name)

           Returns an image resource object.

   <b>width</b>
           $width = $image-&gt;width()

           Get the width (in points) of the image object.

           <b>Note</b> that this function also has the ability to <u>set</u> the width, by giving the new width (in points),
           but it appears that it never worked correctly. The <u>set</u> capability has been <b>deprecated</b>, and is
           scheduled to be removed some time after October, 2025. If you are using the width() method in some
           manner to <u>set</u> the image width, please let us know, so we can plan to keep it enabled!

   <b>height</b>
           $height = $image-&gt;height()

           Get the height (in points) of the image object.

           <b>Note</b> that this function also has the ability to <u>set</u> the height, by giving the new height (in points),
           but it appears that it never worked correctly. The <u>set</u> capability has been <b>deprecated</b>, and is
           scheduled to be removed some time after October, 2025. If you are using the height() method in some
           manner to <u>set</u> the image height, please let us know, so we can plan to keep it enabled!

   <b>smask</b>
           $image-&gt;smask($xobject)

           Set the soft-mask image object.

   <b>mask</b>
           $image-&gt;mask(@color_range)

           $image-&gt;mask($xobject)

           Set the mask to an image mask XObject or an array containing a range of colors to be applied as a
           color key mask.

   <b>colorspace</b>
           $image-&gt;colorspace($name)

           $image-&gt;colorspace($array)

           Set the color space used by the image. Depending on the color space, this will either be just the
           name of the color space, or it will be an array containing the color space and any required
           parameters.

           If passing an array, parameters must already be encoded as PDF objects. The array itself may also be
           a PDF object. If not, one will be created.

   <b>bits_per_component</b>
           $image-&gt;bits_per_component($integer)

           Set the number of bits used to represent each color component.
