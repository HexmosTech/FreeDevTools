       Math::GSL::Roots - Find roots of arbitrary 1-D functions

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Math::GSL::Roots qw/:all/;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       •   gsl_root_fsolver_alloc($T) -

           This  function returns a pointer to a newly allocated instance of a solver of type $T. $T must be one
           of the constant included with this module. If there is insufficient memory to create the solver  then
           the  function  returns  a  null  pointer  and  the  error  handler  is  invoked with an error code of
           $GSL_ENOMEM.

       •   gsl_root_fsolver_free($s) -

           Don't call this function explicitly. It will be called automatically in DESTROY for fsolver.

       •   "gsl_root_fsolver_set($s, $fspec, $x_lower, $x_upper)" -

           This function initializes, or reinitializes, an existing solver $s to use the function  described  by
           $fspec and the initial search interval [$x_lower, $x_upper]. $fspec may either be

           •   a <u>coderef</u>, e.g.

                 $fspec = sub { ... };

               or

                 sub f { ... };
                 $fspec = \&amp;f;

           •   an arrayref with elements [ <u>$coderef</u>, <u>$params</u> ]

           The coderef is called as

                 &amp;$coderef( $x, $params );

           and  should  return  the  function  evaluated  at  "$x,  $params". For example, to find the root of a
           quadratic with run-time specified coefficients "3, 2, 22",

             $f = sub {
                        my ( $x, $params ) = @_;
                        return $params-&gt;[0] + $x * $params-&gt;[1] + $x**2 * $params-&gt;[2];
                      };

             $fspec = [ $f, [ 3, 2, 22 ];

             gsl_root_fsolver_set( $s, $fspec, $x_lower, $x_upper );

           If there are no extra parameters, set $fspec to the function to be evaluated:

             $fspec = sub {
                        my ( $x ) = shift;
                        return  $x + $x**2;
                      };

             gsl_root_fsolver_set( $s, $fspec, $x_lower, $x_upper );

           Don't apply "gsl_root_fsolver_set" twice to the same fsolver.  It will cause a memory  leak.  Instead
           of this you should create new fsolver.

       •   gsl_root_fsolver_iterate($s) -

           This function performs a single iteration of the solver $s. If the iteration encounters an unexpected
           problem then an error code will be returned (the Math::GSL::Errno has to be included),

           $GSL_EBADFUNC  -  The  iteration  encountered  a  singular point where the function or its derivative
           evaluated to Inf or NaN.

           $GSL_EZERODIV - The derivative of the function  vanished  at  the  iteration  point,  preventing  the
           algorithm from continuing without a division by zero.

       •   gsl_root_fsolver_name($s) -

           This function returns the name of the solver use within the $s solver.

       •   gsl_root_fsolver_root($s) -

           This function returns the current estimate of the root for the solver $s.

       •   gsl_root_fsolver_x_lower($s) -

           This function returns the current lower value of the bracketing interval for the solver $s.

       •   gsl_root_fsolver_x_upper($s) -

           This function returns the current lower value of the bracketing interval for the solver $s.

       •   gsl_root_fdfsolver_alloc($T) -

           This  function  returns  a pointer to a newly allocated instance of a derivative-based solver of type
           $T. If there is insufficient memory to create the solver then the function returns a null pointer and
           the error handler is invoked with an error code of $GSL_ENOMEM.

       •   "gsl_root_fdfsolver_set($s, $fspec, $root)" -

           This function initializes, or reinitializes, an existing fdfsolver $s to use  the  function  and  its
           derivatives specified by $fspec and the initial guess "$root."

           $fspec may either be:

           •   A hashref with elements "f", "df", "fdf".

           •   An arrayref with elements "[ $hashref, $params ]"

               where $hashref has elements  "f", "df", "fdf";

           The hashref elements are

           •   "f"

               A coderef returning the value of the function at a given "x". It is called as "&amp;$f($x, $params)".

           •   "df"

               A coderef returning the value of the derivative of the function with respect to "x". It is called
               as "&amp;$df($x, $params)".

           •   "fdf"

               A  coderef  returning  the  value  of  the function and its derivative with respect to "x". It is
               called as "&amp;$fdf($x, $params)".

           For example, to find the root of a quadratic with run-time specified coefficients "3, 2, 22",

             $fdf = {

                 f =&gt; sub {
                     my ( $x, $params ) = @_;
                     return $params-&gt;[0] + $x * $params-&gt;[1] + $x**2 * $params-&gt;[2];
                 },

                 df =&gt; sub {
                     my ( $x, $params ) = @_;

                     $params-&gt;[1] + 2 * $x * $params-&gt;[2];
                 },

                 fdf =&gt; sub {
                     my ( $x, $params ) = @_;

                     return
                       $params-&gt;[0] + $x * $params-&gt;[1] + $x**2 * $params-&gt;[2],
                       $params-&gt;[1] + 2 * $x * $params-&gt;[2];
                 },
             };

             $fspec = [ $fdf, [ 3, 2, 22 ];

             gsl_root_fdsolver_set( $s, $fspec );

           If there are no extra parameters, set $fspec to $fdf:

             $fdf = {

                 f =&gt; sub {
                     my $x = shift;
                     return $x + $x**2;
                 },

                 df =&gt; sub {
                     my $x = shift;

                     1 + 2 * $x;
                 },

                 fdf =&gt; sub {
                     my $x = shift;

                     return
                       $x + $x**2,
                       1 + 2 * $x;
                 },
             };

             gsl_root_fdfsolver_set( $s, $fdf );

           Don't apply "gsl_root_fdffsolver_set" twice to the same fdfsolver.  It  will  cause  a  memory  leak.
           Instead of this you should create new fdfsolver.

       •   gsl_root_fdfsolver_iterate($s) -

           This function performs a single iteration of the solver $s. If the iteration encounters an unexpected
           problem then an error code will be returned (the Math::GSL::Errno has to be included),

           $GSL_EBADFUNC  -  The  iteration  encountered  a  singular point where the function or its derivative
           evaluated to Inf or NaN.  $GSL_EZERODIV - The derivative of the function vanished  at  the  iteration
           point, preventing the algorithm from continuing without a division by zero.

       •   gsl_root_fdfsolver_free($s) -

           Don't call this function explicitly. It will be called automatically in DESTROY for fdfsolver.

       •   gsl_root_fdfsolver_name($s) -

           This function returns the name of the solver use within the $s solver.

       •   gsl_root_fdfsolver_root($s) -

           This function returns the current estimate of the root for the solver $s.

       •   "gsl_root_test_interval($x_lower, $x_upper, $epsabs, $epsrel)" -

           This  function  tests  for  the  convergence of the interval [$x_lower, $x_upper] with absolute error
           epsabs and relative error $epsrel. The test  returns  $GSL_SUCCESS  if  the  following  condition  is
           achieved,

               |a - b| &lt; epsabs + epsrel min(|a|,|b|)

            when the interval x = [a,b] does not include the origin. If the interval
            includes the origin then \min(|a|,|b|) is replaced by zero (which is the
            minimum value of |x| over the interval). This ensures that the relative error
            is accurately estimated for roots close to the origin.  This condition on the
            interval also implies that any estimate of the root r in the interval
            satisfies the same condition with respect to the true root r^*,

               |r - r^*| &lt; epsabs + epsrel r^*

             assuming that the true root r^* is contained within the interval.

       •   "gsl_root_test_residual($f, $epsabs)" -

           This  function tests the residual value $f against the absolute error bound $epsabs. The test returns
           $GSL_SUCCESS if the following condition is achieved,

               |$f| &lt; $epsabs

           and returns $GSL_CONTINUE otherwise. This criterion is suitable  for  situations  where  the  precise
           location  of the root, x, is unimportant provided a value can be found where the residual, |f(x)|, is
           small enough.

       •   "gsl_root_test_delta($x1, $x0, $epsabs, $epsrel)" -

           This function tests for the convergence of the sequence ..., $x0, $x1 with absolute error $epsabs and
           relative error $epsrel. The test returns $GSL_SUCCESS if the following condition is achieved,

               |x_1 - x_0| &lt; epsabs + epsrel |x_1|

           and returns $GSL_CONTINUE otherwise.

       This module also includes the following constants :

       •   $gsl_root_fsolver_bisection -

           The bisection algorithm is the simplest method of bracketing the roots  of  a  function.  It  is  the
           slowest  algorithm  provided by the library, with linear convergence. On each iteration, the interval
           is bisected and the value of the function at the midpoint is calculated. The sign of  this  value  is
           used  to determine which half of the interval does not contain a root. That half is discarded to give
           a new, smaller interval containing the root. This procedure can be continued indefinitely  until  the
           interval is sufficiently small. At any time the current estimate of the root is taken as the midpoint
           of the interval.

       •   $gsl_root_fsolver_brent -

           The  Brent-Dekker method (referred to here as Brent's method) combines an interpolation strategy with
           the bisection algorithm. This produces a fast algorithm which is  still  robust.  On  each  iteration
           Brent's method approximates the function using an interpolating curve. On the first iteration this is
           a  linear interpolation of the two endpoints. For subsequent iterations the algorithm uses an inverse
           quadratic fit to the last three points, for higher accuracy. The intercept of the interpolating curve
           with the x-axis is taken as a guess for the root. If  it  lies  within  the  bounds  of  the  current
           interval  then  the interpolating point is accepted, and used to generate a smaller interval.  If the
           interpolating point is not accepted then the algorithm falls back to an ordinary bisection step.  The
           best estimate of the root is taken from the most recent interpolation or bisection.

       •   $gsl_root_fsolver_falsepos -

           The  false  position  algorithm  is  a  method  of  finding  roots based on linear interpolation. Its
           convergence is linear, but it is usually faster than bisection. On each iteration  a  line  is  drawn
           between the endpoints (a,f(a)) and (b,f(b)) and the point where this line crosses the x-axis taken as
           a "midpoint". The value of the function at this point is calculated and its sign is used to determine
           which  side  of  the  interval does not contain a root. That side is discarded to give a new, smaller
           interval containing the root. This procedure can be continued  indefinitely  until  the  interval  is
           sufficiently  small.  The  best  estimate  of  the root is taken from the linear interpolation of the
           interval on the current iteration.

       •   $gsl_root_fdfsolver_newton -

           Newton's Method is the standard root-polishing algorithm. The algorithm begins with an initial  guess
           for  the  location  of the root. On each iteration, a line tangent to the function f is drawn at that
           position. The point where this line crosses the x-axis  becomes  the  new  guess.  The  iteration  is
           defined  by  the  following  sequence,  x_{i+1}  =  x_i  -  f(x_i)/f'(x_i)  Newton's method converges
           quadratically for single roots, and linearly for multiple roots.

       •   $gsl_root_fdfsolver_secant -

           The secant method is a simplified version of Newton's method which does not require  the  computation
           of  the  derivative on every step.  On its first iteration the algorithm begins with Newton's method,
           using the derivative to compute a first step,

               x_1 = x_0 - f(x_0)/f'(x_0)

           Subsequent iterations avoid the evaluation of  the  derivative  by  replacing  it  with  a  numerical
           estimate, the slope of the line through the previous two points,

               x_{i+1} = x_i f(x_i) / f'_{est}

           where

               f'_{est} = (f(x_i) - f(x_{i-1})/(x_i - x_{i-1})

           When the derivative does not change significantly in the vicinity of the root the secant method gives
           a useful saving. Asymptotically the secant method is faster than Newton's method whenever the cost of
           evaluating the derivative is more than 0.44 times the cost of evaluating the function itself. As with
           all  methods  of computing a numerical derivative the estimate can suffer from cancellation errors if
           the separation of the points becomes too small.

           On single roots, the method has a convergence of order (1  +  \sqrt  5)/2  (approximately  1.62).  It
           converges linearly for multiple roots.

       •   $gsl_root_fdfsolver_steffenson -

           The  Steffenson  Method  provides  the fastest convergence of all the routines. It combines the basic
           Newton algorithm with an Aitken “delta-squared” acceleration. If the Newton iterates are x_i then the
           acceleration procedure generates a new sequence R_i:

               R_i = x_i - (x_{i+1} - x_i)^2 / (x_{i+2} - 2 x_{i+1} + x_{i})

           which converges faster than the original sequence under  reasonable  conditions.   The  new  sequence
           requires  three  terms before it can produce its first value so the method returns accelerated values
           on the second and subsequent iterations.  On the first  iteration  it  returns  the  ordinary  Newton
           estimate.  The  Newton  iterate  is  also  returned  if the denominator of the acceleration term ever
           becomes zero.

           As with all acceleration procedures this method can become unstable if  the  function  is  not  well-
           behaved.
