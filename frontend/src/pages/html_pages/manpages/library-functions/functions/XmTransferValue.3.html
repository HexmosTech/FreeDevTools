</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>XmTransferValue</b>  —  A  toolkit  function  that transfers data to a destination "XmTransferValue" "toolkit
       functions" "XmTransferValue"

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;Xm/Xm.h&gt;

       <b>void</b> <b>XmTransferValue</b>(
       <b>XtPointer</b> <b>transfer_id</b>,
       <b>Atom</b> <b>target</b>,
       <b>XtCallbackProc</b> <b>proc</b>,
       <b>XtPointer</b> <b>client_data</b>,
       <b>Time</b> <b>time</b>);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>XmTransferValue</b> converts a selection, transferring any data from the selection owner, in the  context  of
       an   already-initiated   data  transfer  operation.   An  application  can  call  this  routine  from  an
       <b>XmNdestinationCallback</b> procedure or any function called as a result.

       The caller of <b>XmTransferValue</b> supplies the target to which the selection is converted.  The  caller  also
       supplies a callback procedure to handle the data that results from the conversion.

       <b>transfer_id</b>
                 Specifies  a unique indentifier for the data transfer operation.  The value must be the same as
                 the  value  of  the  <b>transfer_id</b>  member  of  the  <b>XmDestinationCallbackStruct</b>  passed  to  the
                 <b>XmNdestinationCallback</b> procedure.

       <u>target</u>    Specifies the target to which the selection is to be converted.

       <u>proc</u>      Specifies  a  callback  procedure  to  be invoked when the selection has been converted and the
                 data, if any, is available.  This procedure is responsible for inserting or otherwise  handling
                 any  data  transferred.   The  procedure  can  also  terminate  the  data  transfer  by calling
                 <b>XmTransferDone</b>.  The <u>proc</u> receives three arguments:

                    •  The widget that requested the conversion

                    •  The value of the <u>client_data</u> argument

                    •  A pointer to an <b>XmSelectionCallbackStruct</b>

                 This procedure can be called before or after <b>XmTransferValue</b> returns.

       <u>client_data</u>
                 Specifies data to be passed to the callback procedure (the value of the <u>proc</u> argument) when the
                 selection has been converted.

       <u>time</u>      Specifies the time of the <b>XEvent</b> that triggered the data transfer.  You  should  typically  set
                 this field to <b>XtLastTimestampProcessed</b>.

       The   callback   procedure   (the   value   of   the   <u>proc</u>   argument)   receives   a   pointer   to  an
       <b>XmSelectionCallbackStruct</b>, which has the following definition:

       typedef struct
       {
               int <u>reason</u>;
               XEvent *<u>event</u>;
               Atom <u>selection</u>;
               Atom <u>target</u>;
               Atom <u>type</u>;
               XtPointer <u>transfer_id</u>;
               int <u>flags</u>;
               int <u>remaining</u>;
               XtPointer <u>value</u>;
               unsigned long <u>length</u>;
               int <u>format</u>;
       } XmSelectionCallbackStruct;

       <u>reason</u>    Indicates why the callback was invoked.

       <u>event</u>     Points to the <b>XEvent</b> that triggered the callback.  It can be NULL.

       <u>selection</u> Specifies the selection that has been converted.

       <u>target</u>    Specifies the target to which <b>XmTransferValue</b> requested conversion.  The value is the  same  as
                 the value of the <u>target</u> argument to <b>XmTransferValue</b>.

       <u>type</u>      Specifies  the  type  of  the  selection  value.   This is not the target, but the type used to
                 represent the target.  The value <b>XT_CONVERT_FAIL</b> means that the selection owner did not respond
                 to the conversion request within the Intrinsics selection timeout interval.

       <b>transfer_id</b>
                 Specifies a unique indentifier for the data transfer operation.  The value is the same  as  the
                 value of the <b>transfer_id</b> argument to <b>XmTransferValue</b>.

       <u>flags</u>     This member is currently unused.  The value is always <b>XmSELECTION_DEFAULT</b>.

       <u>remaining</u> Indicates the number of transfers remaining for the operation specified by <b>transfer_id</b>.

       <u>value</u>     Represents  the  data  transferred by this request.  The application is responsible for freeing
                 the value by calling <b>XtFree</b>.

       <u>length</u>    Indicates the number of elements of data in <u>value</u>, where each element has the  size  symbolized
                 by <u>format</u>.  If <u>value</u> is NULL, <u>length</u> is 0.

       <u>format</u>    Indicates  whether  the  data  in  <u>value</u>  should  be  viewed  as a list of <u>char</u>, <u>short</u>, or <u>long</u>
                 quantities.  Possible values are 8 (for a list of <u>char</u>), 16 (for a list of <u>short</u>), or 32 (for a
                 list of <u>long</u>).
