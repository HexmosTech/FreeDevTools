</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       SDLCALL - A macro to set a function's calling conventions.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;SDL3/SDL_begin_code.h&gt;</b>

       <b>#define</b> <b>SDLCALL</b> <b>__cdecl</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       SDL  uses  this  macro  for all its public functions, and any callbacks it defines. This macro guarantees
       that calling conventions match between SDL and the app,  even  if  the  two  were  built  with  different
       compilers or optimization settings.

       When  writing  a  callback  function, it is very important for it to be correctly tagged with SDLCALL, as
       mismatched calling conventions can cause strange behaviors and can be difficult  to  diagnose.  Plus,  on
       many  platforms,  SDLCALL  is  defined  to  nothing,  so  compilers won't be able to warn that the tag is
       missing.

       This symbol is used in SDL's headers, but apps and other libraries are welcome to use it  for  their  own
       interfaces as well.

</pre><h4><b>AVAILABILITY</b></h4><pre>
       This macro is available since SDL 3.2.0.
