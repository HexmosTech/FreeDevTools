</pre><h4><b>Detailed</b> <b>Description</b></h4><pre>
       a physical tablet tool

       An object that represents a physical tool that has been, or is currently in use with a tablet in this
       seat. Each wp_tablet_tool object stays valid until the client destroys it; the compositor reuses the
       wp_tablet_tool object to indicate that the object's respective physical tool has come into proximity of a
       tablet again.

       A wp_tablet_tool object's relation to a physical tool depends on the tablet's ability to report serial
       numbers. If the tablet supports this capability, then the object represents a specific physical tool and
       can be identified even when used on multiple tablets.

       A tablet tool has a number of static characteristics, e.g. tool type, hardware_serial and capabilities.
       These capabilities are sent in an event sequence after the wp_tablet_seat.tool_added event before any
       actual events from this tool. This initial event sequence is terminated by a wp_tablet_tool.done event.

       Tablet tool events are grouped by wp_tablet_tool.frame events. Any events received before a
       wp_tablet_tool.frame event should be considered part of the same hardware state change.

   <b>enum</b> <b>class</b> <b>wayland::proxy_t::wrapper_type</b> <b>[strong],</b>  <b>[inherited]</b>
       Underlying wl_proxy type and properties of a <b>proxy_t</b> that affect construction, destruction, and event
       handling

       <b>Enumerator</b>

       <u>standard</u>
              C pointer is a standard type compatible with wl_proxy*. Events are dispatched and it is destructed
              when the <b>proxy_t</b> is destructed. User data is set.

       <u>display</u>
              C  pointer  is  a  wl_display*. No events are dispatched, wl_display_disconnect is called when the
              <b>proxy_t</b> is destructed. User data is set.

       <u>foreign</u>
              C pointer is a standard type compatible with wl_proxy*, but another library owns it and it  should
              not  be  touched  in  a  way  that  could affect the operation of the other library. No events are
              dispatched, wl_proxy_destroy is not called when the  <b>proxy_t</b>  is  destructed,  user  data  is  not
              touched.  Consequently,  there is no reference counting for the <b>proxy_t</b>. Lifetime of such wrappers
              should preferably be short to minimize the chance that the owning library decides to  destroy  the
              wl_proxy.

       <u>proxy_wrapper</u>
              C  pointer  is  a  wl_proxy*  that  was  constructed  with  wl_proxy_create_wrapper. No events are
              dispatched, wl_proxy_wrapper_destroy is called when the <b>proxy_t</b> is destroyed.  Reference  counting
              is  active.  A reference to the <b>proxy_t</b> creating this proxy wrapper is held to extend its lifetime
              until after the proxy wrapper is destroyed.

   <b>wl_proxy</b> <b>*</b> <b>wayland::proxy_t::c_ptr</b> <b>()</b> <b>const</b> <b>[inherited]</b>
       Get a pointer to the underlying C struct.

       <b>Returns</b>
           The underlying wl_proxy wrapped by this <b>proxy_t</b> if it exists, otherwise an exception is thrown

   <b>std::string</b> <b>wayland::proxy_t::get_class</b> <b>()</b> <b>const</b> <b>[inherited]</b>

   <b>uint32_t</b> <b>wayland::proxy_t::get_id</b> <b>()</b> <b>const</b> <b>[inherited]</b>
       Get the id of a proxy object.

       <b>Returns</b>
           The id the object associated with the proxy

   <b>uint32_t</b> <b>wayland::proxy_t::get_version</b> <b>()</b> <b>const</b> <b>[inherited]</b>
       Get the protocol object version of a proxy object. Gets the protocol object version of a proxy object, or
       0 if the proxy was created with unversioned API.

       A returned value of 0 means that no version information is  available,  so  the  caller  must  make  safe
       assumptions about the object's real version.

       <b>display_t</b> will always return version 0.

   <b>std::function&lt;</b> <b>void()&gt;</b> <b>&amp;</b> <b>zwp_tablet_tool_v2_t::on_done</b> <b>()</b>
       tool description events sequence complete This event signals the end of the initial burst of  descriptive

   <b>std::function&lt;</b> <b>void(uint32_t)&gt;</b> <b>&amp;</b> <b>zwp_tablet_tool_v2_t::on_down</b> <b>()</b>
       tablet tool is making contact

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>serial</u>

       Sent whenever the tablet tool comes in contact with the surface of the tablet.

       If the tool is already in contact with the tablet when entering the input region, the client owning  said
       region   will  receive  a  wp_tablet.proximity_in  event,  followed  by  a  wp_tablet.down  event  and  a
       wp_tablet.frame event.

       Note that this event describes logical contact, not physical contact. On some devices, a  compositor  may
       not consider a tool in logical contact until a minimum physical pressure threshold is exceeded.

   <b>std::function&lt;</b> <b>void(uint32_t)&gt;</b> <b>&amp;</b> <b>zwp_tablet_tool_v2_t::on_frame</b> <b>()</b>
       frame event

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>time</u> The time of the event with millisecond granularity

       Marks  the  end  of a series of axis and/or button updates from the tablet. The Wayland protocol requires
       axis updates to be sent sequentially, however all events within a frame should be considered one hardware
       event.

       hardware id notification in Wacom's format

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>hardware_id_hi</u> the hardware id, most significant bits
           <u>hardware_id_lo</u> the hardware id, least significant bits

       This event notifies the client of a hardware id available on this tool.

       The hardware id is a device-specific 64-bit id that provides extra information about  the  tool  in  use,
       beyond  the  wl_tool.type enumeration. The format of the id is specific to tablets made by Wacom Inc. For
       example, the hardware id of a Wacom Grip Pen (a stylus) is 0x802.

       This event is sent in the initial burst of events before the wp_tablet_tool.done event.

   <b>std::function&lt;</b> <b>void(uint32_t,</b> <b>uint32_t)&gt;</b> <b>&amp;</b> <b>zwp_tablet_tool_v2_t::on_hardware_serial</b> <b>()</b>
       unique hardware serial number of the tool

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>hardware_serial_hi</u> the unique serial number of the tool, most significant bits
           <u>hardware_serial_lo</u> the unique serial number of the tool, least significant bits

       If the physical tool can be identified by a unique 64-bit serial number, this event notifies  the  client
       of this serial number.

       If  multiple  tablets  are available in the same seat and the tool is uniquely identifiable by the serial
       number, that tool may move between tablets.

       Otherwise, if the tool has no serial number and this event is missing, the tool is tied to the tablet  it
       first  comes  into  proximity  with.  Even  if  the  physical  tool is used on multiple tablets, separate
       wp_tablet_tool objects will be created, one per tablet.

       This event is sent in the initial burst of events before the wp_tablet_tool.done event.

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>serial</u>
           <u>tablet</u> The tablet the tool is in proximity of
           <u>surface</u> The current surface the tablet tool is over

       Notification that this tool is focused on a certain surface.

       This event can be received when the tool has moved from one surface to another, or when the tool has come
       back into proximity above the surface.

       If any button is logically down when the tool comes into proximity, the respective button event  is  sent
       after the proximity_in event but within the same frame as the proximity_in event.

   <b>std::function&lt;</b> <b>void()&gt;</b> <b>&amp;</b> <b>zwp_tablet_tool_v2_t::on_proximity_out</b> <b>()</b>
       proximity  out  event Notification that this tool has either left proximity, or is no longer focused on a
       certain surface.

       When the tablet tool leaves proximity of the tablet, button release events are sent for each button  that
       was  held down at the time of leaving proximity. These events are sent before the proximity_out event but
       within the same wp_tablet.frame.

       If the tool stays within proximity of the tablet, but the focus changes from one surface  to  another,  a
       button  release  event  may  not  be  sent  until  the button is actually released or the tool leaves the
       proximity of the tablet.

   <b>std::function&lt;</b> <b>void()&gt;</b> <b>&amp;</b> <b>zwp_tablet_tool_v2_t::on_removed</b> <b>()</b>
       tool removed This event is sent when the tool is removed from the system and will send no further events.
       Should the physical tool come back into proximity later, a new wp_tablet_tool object will be created.

       It is compositor-dependent when a tool is removed. A compositor may  remove  a  tool  on  proximity  out,
       tablet removal or any other reason. A compositor may also keep a tool alive until shutdown.

       If  the  tool is currently in proximity, a proximity_out event will be sent before the removed event. See
       wp_tablet_tool.proximity_out for the handling of any buttons logically down.

       When this event is received, the client must wp_tablet_tool.destroy the object.

       surface of the tablet, or when the tablet tool moves out of the input region and the compositor grab  (if
       any) is dismissed.

       If  the tablet tool moves out of the input region while in contact with the surface of the tablet and the
       compositor does not have an ongoing grab on the surface, the client owning said  region  will  receive  a
       wp_tablet.up  event,  followed  by  a  wp_tablet.proximity_out  event and a wp_tablet.frame event. If the
       compositor has an ongoing grab on this device, this event sequence is sent whenever the grab is dismissed
       in the future.

       Note that this event describes logical contact, not physical contact. On some devices, a  compositor  may
       not consider a tool out of logical contact until physical pressure falls below a specific threshold.

   <b>std::function&lt;</b> <b>void(double,</b> <b>int32_t)&gt;</b> <b>&amp;</b> <b>zwp_tablet_tool_v2_t::on_wheel</b> <b>()</b>
       Wheel delta event.

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>degrees</u> The wheel delta in degrees
           <u>clicks</u> The wheel delta in discrete clicks

       Sent  whenever  the  wheel  on  the tool emits an event. This event contains two values for the same axis
       change. The degrees value is in the same orientation as the wl_pointer.vertical_scroll axis.  The  clicks
       value  is  in  discrete  logical clicks of the mouse wheel. This value may be zero if the movement of the
       wheel was less than one logical click.

       Clients should choose either value and avoid mixing degrees and clicks.  The  compositor  may  accumulate
       values  smaller  than  a  logical  click  and emulate click events when a certain threshold is met. Thus,
       wl_tablet_tool.wheel events with non-zero clicks values may have different degrees values.

   <b>void</b> <b>wayland::proxy_t::proxy_release</b> <b>()</b> <b>[inherited]</b>
       Release the wrapped object (if any), making this an empty wrapper. Note that <b>display_t</b>  instances  cannot
       be released this way. Attempts to do so are ignored.

   <b>void</b> <b>zwp_tablet_tool_v2_t::set_cursor</b> <b>(uint32_t</b> <b>serial,</b> <b>surface_t</b> <b>const</b> <b>&amp;</b> <b>surface,</b> <b>int32_t</b> <b>hotspot_x,</b> <b>int32_t</b>
       <b>hotspot_y)</b>
       set the tablet tool's surface

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>serial</u> serial of the enter event
           <u>surface</u>
           <u>hotspot_x</u> surface-local x coordinate
           <u>hotspot_y</u> surface-local y coordinate

       Sets  the surface of the cursor used for this tool on the given tablet. This request only takes effect if
       the tool is in proximity of one of the requesting client's surfaces  or  the  surface  parameter  is  the
       current pointer surface. If there was a previous surface set with this request it is replaced. If surface
       is NULL, the cursor image is hidden.

       The parameters hotspot_x and hotspot_y define the position of the pointer surface relative to the pointer
       location.  Its  top-left  corner  is  always  at  (x,  y)  - (hotspot_x, hotspot_y), where (x, y) are the
       coordinates of the pointer location, in surface-local coordinates.

       On surface.attach requests to the pointer surface, hotspot_x and hotspot_y are decremented by the x and y
       parameters passed to the request. Attach must be confirmed by wl_surface.commit as usual.

       The hotspot can also be updated by passing the currently set pointer surface to  this  request  with  new
       values for hotspot_x and hotspot_y.

       The  current  and pending input regions of the wl_surface are cleared, and wl_surface.set_input_region is
       ignored until the wl_surface is no longer used as the cursor. When the use as a cursor ends, the  current
       and pending input regions become undefined, and the wl_surface is unmapped.

       This  request  gives  the surface the role of a wp_tablet_tool cursor. A surface may only ever be used as
       the cursor surface for one wp_tablet_tool. If the surface already has another role or has previously been
       used as cursor surface for a different tool, a protocol error is raised.
