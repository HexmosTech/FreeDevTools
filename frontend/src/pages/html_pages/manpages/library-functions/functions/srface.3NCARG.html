</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       SRFACE - Draws a perspective picture of a function of two variables with hidden lines removed. The
       function is approximated by a two-dimensional array of heights.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       CALL SRFACE (X,Y,Z,M,MX,NX,NY,S,STEREO)

</pre><h4><b>C-BINDING</b> <b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;ncarg/ncargC.h&gt;

       void c_srface (float *x, float *y, float *z, int *m,
       int mx, int nx, int ny, float s[6], float stereo)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       X           A  linear  array  NX  long  containing  the  X  coordinates  of  the  points  in  the surface
                   approximation.  See "USAGE" below.

       Y           The linear array NY  long  containing  the  Y  coordinates  of  the  points  in  the  surface
                   approximation.  See "USAGE" below.

       Z           An  array  MX  by  NY  containing  the  surface  to  be  drawn  in  NX  by NY cells. Z(I,J) =
                   F(X(I),Y(J)).  See "USAGE" below.

       M           Scratch array at least 2*NX*NY words long.

       MX          First dimension of Z.

       NX          Number of data values in the X direction (the first subscript direction) in Z to be  plotted.
                   When plotting an entire array, MX=NX.

       NY          Number of data values in the Y direction (the second subscript direction) to be plotted.

       S           S  defines  the line of sight. The viewer's eye is at (<a href="../man1/S.1.html">S</a>(1), <a href="../man2/S.2.html">S</a>(2), <a href="../man3/S.3.html">S</a>(3)) and the point looked
                   at is at (<a href="../man4/S.4.html">S</a>(4), <a href="../man5/S.5.html">S</a>(5), <a href="../man6/S.6.html">S</a>(6)). The eye should be outside the block with opposite corners (<a href="../man1/X.1.html">X</a>(1),
                   <a href="../man1/Y.1.html">Y</a>(1), ZMIN) and (X(NX), Y(NY), ZMAX) and the point looked at should be inside it. For a  nice
                   perspective  effect,  the  distance between the eye and the point looked at should be 5 to 10
                   times the size of the block.

       STEREO      Flag to indicate if stereo pairs are to be drawn.  0.0 means no stereo  pair  (one  picture).
                   Non-zero  means  put  out two pictures. The value of STEREO is the relative angle between the
                   eyes. A value of 1.0 produces standard separation. Negative  STEREO  reverses  the  left  and
                   right figures.

</pre><h4><b>C-BINDING</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The C-binding argument descriptions are the same as the FORTRAN argument descriptions, with the following
       exceptions:

       z           An array ny by mx.

       mx          Second dimension of z.

       nx          Number of data values in the y direction (the second subscript direction) in z to be plotted.
                   When plotting an entire array, mx=nx.

       ny          Number of data values in the x direction (the first subscript direction) to be plotted.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       • The range of Z compared with the range of X and Y determines the shape of the picture. They are assumed
         to  be in the same units and not wildly different in magnitude. S is assumed to be in the same units as
         X, Y, and Z.

       • Picture size can be made relative to distance.

       • TRN32S can be used to translate from 3 space to 2 space.

       • Data with extreme discontinuities may cause visibility errors. If this problem occurs,  use  a  distant
         eye position away from the +Z axis.

       • The  default line color is set to color index 1. If the user wishes to change the line color, he can do
         so by defining color index 1 before calling SRFACE, or by  putting  the  common  block  SRFINT  in  his
         calling program and defining and using color index ISRFMJ (defaulted to 1 in BLOCKDATA).

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Use  the  ncargex  command  to  see  the  following  relevant examples: srex01, tpwrzs, tsrfac, fsrpwrzs,
       fsrsrfac.

</pre><h4><b>ACCESS</b></h4><pre>
       To use SRFACE or c_srface, load the NCAR Graphics libraries ncarg, ncarg_gks, and ncarg_c, preferably  in
       that order.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       Online: surface, surface_params, ezsrfc, pwrzs, setr, ncarg_cbind.
