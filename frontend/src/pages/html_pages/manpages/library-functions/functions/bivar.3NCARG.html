</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Bivar - Provides bivariate interpolation and smooth surface fitting for values given at irregularly
       distributed points.  The resulting interpolating function and its first-order partial derivatives are
       continuous.  The method employed is local, i.e. a change in the data in one area of the plane does not
       affect the interpolating function except in that local area.  Also, the method gives exact results when
       all points lie in a plane.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       IDBVIP      Produces  interpolated  values  at  points  (XI(I),  YI(I)), I=1,...,NIP.  This is useful for
                   filling in missing data points on a grid.

       IDSFFT      Performs smooth surface fitting when the projections of the data points in the X-Y plane  are
                   irregularly distributed in the plane.

       IDPLTR      Plots the triangulation of the data points.

       IDGETI      Retrieves the integer value of a Bivar parameter.

       IDGETR      Retrieves the real value of a Bivar parameter.

       IDSETI      Provides a new integer value for a Bivar parameter.

       IDSETR      Provides a new real value for a Bivar parameter.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       See the example "cbex01".

</pre><h4><b>ACCESS</b></h4><pre>
       To  use  the Bivar Fortran or C routines, load the NCAR Graphics libraries ncarg, ncarg_gks, and ncarg_c,
       preferably in that order.

</pre><h4><b>MESSAGES</b></h4><pre>
       When error conditions are detected, the support routine SETER is  called.  By  default,  SETER  writes  a
       message  to  the  standard  error  file  (as  defined by <a href="../man4/I1MACH.4.html">I1MACH</a>(4)) and then terminates execution.  It is
       possible to put SETER into recovery mode and regain control after a recoverable error (which includes all
       of the possible errors).

       The possible error messages are listed below.  All errors are  recoverable  in  the  sense  that  a  user
       program  which  has  called  ENTSR  to  set recovery mode will get control back after one of these errors
       occurs.

       Bivar was written by Hiroshi Akima in August 1975 and rewritten by him in late  1976.   In  1989,  a  new
       version of Bivar, incorporating changes described in a Rocky Mountain Journal of Mathematics was obtained
       from  Dr.  Akima, and included in NCAR Graphics with his permission.  In 1995, Dave Kennison incorporated
       the capability of doing linear interpolation and a different kind of triangulation, put  in  a  parameter
       access interface, and wrote a routine to allow the triangulation to be plotted.
