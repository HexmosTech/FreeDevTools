</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       For all of the functions below that set the supported groups there must be at least one group in the
       list. A number of these functions identify groups via a unique integer NID value. However, support for
       some groups may be added by external providers. In this case there will be no NID assigned for the group.
       When setting such groups applications should use the "list" form of these functions (i.e.
       <b>SSL_CTX_set1_groups_list()</b> and <b>SSL_set1_groups_list()</b>).

       <b>SSL_CTX_set1_groups()</b> sets the supported groups for <b>ctx</b> to <b>glistlen</b> groups in the array <b>glist</b>. The array
       consist of all NIDs of supported groups.  The supported groups for <b>TLSv1.3</b> include: <b>NID_X9_62_prime256v1</b>,
       <b>NID_secp384r1</b>, <b>NID_secp521r1</b>, <b>NID_X25519</b>, <b>NID_X448</b>, <b>NID_brainpoolP256r1tls13</b>, <b>NID_brainpoolP384r1tls13</b>,
       <b>NID_brainpoolP512r1tls13</b>, <b>NID_ffdhe2048</b>, <b>NID_ffdhe3072</b>, <b>NID_ffdhe4096</b>, <b>NID_ffdhe6144</b>, and <b>NID_ffdhe8192</b>.
       OpenSSL will use this array in different ways based on the TLS version, and whether the groups are used
       in a client or server.

       For a TLS client, the groups are used directly in the supported groups extension. The extension's
       preference order, to be evaluated by the server, is determined by the order of the elements in the array.

       For a TLS 1.2 server, the groups determine the selected group. If <b>SSL_OP_CIPHER_SERVER_PREFERENCE</b> is set,
       the order of the elements in the array determines the selected group. Otherwise, the order is ignored and
       the client's order determines the selection.

       For a TLS 1.3 server, the groups determine the selected group, but selection is more complex. A TLS 1.3
       client sends both a group list as well as a predicted subset of groups. Choosing a group outside the
       predicted subset incurs an extra roundtrip. However, in some situations, the most preferred group may not
       be predicted. OpenSSL considers all supported groups in <u>clist</u> to be comparable in security and
       prioritizes avoiding roundtrips above either client or server preference order. If an application uses an
       external provider to extend OpenSSL with, e.g., a post-quantum algorithm, this behavior may allow a
       network attacker to downgrade connections to a weaker algorithm. It is therefore recommended to use
       <b>SSL_CTX_set1_groups_list()</b> with the ability to specify group tuples.

       <b>SSL_CTX_set1_groups_list()</b> sets the supported groups for <b>ctx</b> to string <u>list</u>. In contrast to
       <b>SSL_CTX_set1_groups()</b>, the names of the groups, rather than their NIDs, are used.

       The commands below list the available groups for TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3, respectively:

           $ openssl list -tls1_2 -tls-groups
           $ openssl list -tls1_3 -tls-groups

       Each group can be either the <b>NIST</b> name (e.g. <b>P-256</b>), some other commonly used name where applicable (e.g.
       <b>X25519</b>, <b>ffdhe2048</b>) or an OpenSSL OID name (e.g. <b>prime256v1</b>).  Group names are case-insensitive in OpenSSL
       3.5 and later.  The preferred group names are those defined by IANA
       &lt;https://www.iana.org/assignments/tls-parameters/tls-parameters.xhtml#tls-parameters-8&gt;.

       The <u>list</u> can be used to define several group tuples of comparable security levels, and can specify which
       key shares should be sent by a client.  The specified list elements can optionally be ignored, if not
       implemented (listing unknown groups otherwise results in error).  It is also possible to specify the
       built-in default set of groups, and to explicitly remove a group from that list.

       In its simplest form, the string <u>list</u> is just a colon separated list of group names, for example
       "P-521:P-384:P-256:X25519:ffdhe2048". The first group listed will also be used for the <b>key_share</b> sent by
       a client in a TLSv1.3 <b>ClientHello</b>. For servers note the discussion above. The list should be in order of
       preference with the most preferred group first.

       Group tuples of comparable security are defined by separating them from each other by a tuple separator
       "/". Keyshares to be sent by a client are specified by prepending a "*" to the group name, while any "*"
       will be ignored by a server. The following string <u>list</u> for example defines three tuples when used on the
       server-side, and triggers the generation of three key shares when used on the client-side:
       P-521:*P-256/*P-384/*X25519:P-384:ffdhe2048.

       If a group name is preceded with the "?" character, it will be ignored if an implementation is missing.
       If a group name is preceded with the "-" character, it will be removed from the list of groups if present
       (including not sending a key share for this group), ignored otherwise. The pseudo group name "DEFAULT"
       can be used to select the OpenSSL built-in default list of groups.

       For a TLS 1.3 client, all the groups in the string <u>list</u> are added to the supported groups extension of a
       "ClientHello", in the order in which they are listed, thereby interpreting tuple separators as group
       separators. The extension's preference order, to be evaluated by the server, is determined by the order
       of the elements in the array, see below.

       If a group name is preceded by "*", a key share will be sent for this group.  When preceding "DEFAULT"
       with "*", a key share will be sent for the first group of the OpenSSL built-in default list of groups. If
       no "*" is used anywhere in the list, a single key share for the leftmost valid group is sent. A maximum
       of 4 key shares are supported. Example: "P-521:*P-256/*P-384" will add P-521, P-256 and P-384 to the
       supported groups extension in a "ClientHello" and will send key shares for P-256 and P-384.

       For a TLS 1.3 server, the groups in the string <u>list</u> will be used to determine which group is used for the
       key agreement. The preference order of the group tuples is determined by the order of the tuples in the
       array, and the preference order of the groups within a group tuple is determined by the order of the
       groups in the tuple. Server preference can be enforced by setting <b>SSL_OP_CIPHER_SERVER_PREFERENCE</b> using
       <b>SSL_set_options</b> (default: client preference).

       The server will select the group to be used for a key agreement using the following pseudo-code
       algorithm:

        FOR each group tuple
            IF client preference (= default)
                FOR each client key-share group
                    IF current key-share group is also part of current group tuple: SH, return success
                FOR each client supported groups
                    IF current supported group is also part of current group tuple: HRR, return success
            ELSE (= server preference = with SSL_OP_CIPHER_SERVER_PREFERENCE option set)
                FOR each group in current tuple
                    IF current group is also part of client key-share groups: SH, return success
                FOR each group in current tuple
                    IF current group is also part of client supported groups: HRR, return success
        return failure

        with : SH:  Server hello with current group
               HRR: Server retry request with current group

       Hence, if a client supports a group in a server group tuple, but does not send a key share for this
       group, a Hello Retry Request (HRR) is triggered, asking the client to send a new Hello message with a
       more preferred keyshare. See examples below.

       A group name can optionally be preceded by any of "*", "?" or "-", in any order, with the exception that
       only "*" is allowed to precede "DEFAULT". Separator characters ":" and "/" are only allowed inside the
       <u>list</u> and not at the very beginning or end.

       <b>SSL_set1_groups()</b> and <b>SSL_set1_groups_list()</b> are similar except they set supported groups for the SSL
       structure <b>ssl</b>.

       <b>SSL_get1_groups()</b> returns the set of supported groups sent by a client in the supported groups extension.
       It returns the total number of supported groups. The <b>groups</b> parameter can be <b>NULL</b> to simply return the
       number of groups for memory allocation purposes. The <b>groups</b> array is in the form of a set of group NIDs
       in preference order. It can return zero if the client did not send a supported groups extension. If a
       supported group NID is unknown then the value is set to the bitwise OR of TLSEXT_nid_unknown (0x1000000)
       and the id of the group.

       <b>SSL_get0_iana_groups()</b> retrieves the list of groups sent by the client in the supported_groups extension.
       The <b>*out</b> array of bytes is populated with the host-byte-order representation of the uint16_t group
       identifiers, as assigned by IANA.  The group list is returned in the same order that was received in the
       ClientHello.  The return value is the number of groups, not the number of bytes written.

       <b>SSL_get_shared_group()</b> returns the NID of the shared group <b>n</b> for a server-side SSL <b>ssl</b>. If <b>n</b> is -1 then
       the total number of shared groups is returned, which may be zero. Other than for diagnostic purposes,
       most applications will only be interested in the first shared group so <b>n</b> is normally set to zero. If the
       value <b>n</b> is out of range, NID_undef is returned. If the NID for the shared group is unknown then the value
       is set to the bitwise OR of TLSEXT_nid_unknown (0x1000000) and the id of the group.

       <b>SSL_get_negotiated_group()</b> returns the NID of the negotiated group used for the handshake key exchange
       process.  For TLSv1.3 connections this typically reflects the state of the current connection, though in
       the case of PSK-only resumption, the returned value will be from a previous connection.  For earlier TLS
       versions, when a session has been resumed, it always reflects the group used for key exchange during the
       initial handshake (otherwise it is from the current, non-resumption, connection).  This can be called by
       either client or server. If the NID for the shared group is unknown then the value is set to the bitwise
       OR of TLSEXT_nid_unknown (0x1000000) and the id of the group. See also <b><a href="../man3/SSL_get0_group_name.3.html">SSL_get0_group_name</a></b>(3) which
       returns the name of the negotiated group directly and is generally preferred over
       <b>SSL_get_negotiated_group()</b>.

       <b>SSL_CTX_get0_implemented_groups()</b> populates a stack with the names of TLS groups that are compatible with
       the TLS version of the <b>ctx</b> argument.  The returned names are references to internal constants and must
       not be modified or freed.  When <b>all</b> is nonzero, the returned list includes not only the preferred IANA
       names of the groups, but also any associated aliases.  If the SSL_CTX is version-flexible, the groups
       will be those compatible with any configured minimum and maximum protocol versions.  The <b>names</b> stack
       should be allocated by the caller and be empty, the matching group names are appended to the provided
       stack.  The <b>-tls-groups</b> and <b>-all-tls-groups</b> options of the openssl list command output these lists for
       either TLS 1.2 or TLS 1.3 (by default).

       All these functions are implemented as macros.

       The curve functions are synonyms for the equivalently named group functions and are identical in every
       respect. They exist because, prior to TLS1.3, there was only the concept of supported curves. In TLS1.3
       this was renamed to supported groups, and extended to include Diffie Hellman groups. The group functions
       should be used in preference.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       If an application wishes to make use of several of these functions for configuration purposes either on a
       command line or in a file it should consider using the SSL_CONF interface instead of manually parsing
       options.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>SSL_CTX_set1_groups()</b>, <b>SSL_CTX_set1_groups_list()</b>, <b>SSL_set1_groups()</b>, <b>SSL_set1_groups_list()</b>, and
       <b>SSL_CTX_get0_implemented_groups()</b> return 1 for success and 0 for failure.

       <b>SSL_get1_groups()</b> returns the number of groups, which may be zero.

       <b>SSL_get0_iana_groups()</b> returns the number of (uint16_t) groups, which may be zero.

       <b>SSL_get_shared_group()</b> returns the NID of shared group <b>n</b> or NID_undef if there is no shared group <b>n</b>; or
       the total number of shared groups if <b>n</b> is -1.

       When called on a client <b>ssl</b>, <b>SSL_get_shared_group()</b> has no meaning and returns -1.

       <b>SSL_get_negotiated_group()</b> returns the NID of the negotiated group used for key exchange, or NID_undef if
       there was no negotiated group.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Assume the server <u>list</u> is "P-521:P-256/P-384/X25519:ffdhe2048" and client <u>list</u> is "P-521:*P-384" when
       connecting to such a server, meaning that the client supports "P-521" but does not send a key share for
       this group to the server, and the client supports "P-384" including key share for this group.  With both
       server and client preference, an HRR will be triggered for "P-521" despite the availability of a key
       share for P-384, which overlaps with a lower priority server-side tuple.

       As a separate example, consider a server <u>list</u> "A:B/C:D/E:F". Listed in order of highest preference to
       least, 3 group tuples are created: "A:B", "C:D", and "E:F". Here are some examples of a client <u>list</u> where
       setting server/client preference will not change the outcome:

       - "A:D:*F": Both prefer "A", but the server didn't receive a keyshare for the most-preferred tuple in
       which there's at least one group supported by both.  Therefore, an HRR is triggered for "A".

       - "B:*C": Both prefer "B" from the first group tuple "A:B", so an HRR is triggered for "B".

       - "C:*F": Both prefer "C" from the second group tuple "C:D", so an HRR is triggered for "C".

       - "C:*D": Even though both prefer "C" over "D", the server will accept the key share for "D". Within a
       tuple, existing keyshares trump preference order.

       - "*C:*D": The server accepts the "C" key share.

       - "F": Even though it is not prepended with a "*", the client will send a key share for "F". The server
       will then accept the key share for "F".

       - "*E:C:A": The server prefers "A" from the "A:B" group tuple, so an HRR is triggered for "A".

       - "*E:B:*A": The server uses the key share for "A".

       Here are some examples where setting server/client preference will change the result:

       - "*D:*C"
         - Client preference: The server uses the key share for "D".
         - Server preference: The server uses the key share for "C".

       - "B:A:*C"
         - Client preference: The server triggers an HRR for "B". For the server, "A" and "B" are considered
       comparable in security. But because the client prefers "B", the server will trigger an HRR for "B".
         - Server preference: The server triggers an HRR for "A".

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       The curve functions were added in OpenSSL 1.0.2. The equivalent group functions were added in OpenSSL
       1.1.1. The <b>SSL_get_negotiated_group()</b> function was added in OpenSSL 3.0.0.

       Support for ignoring unknown groups in <b>SSL_CTX_set1_groups_list()</b> and <b>SSL_set1_groups_list()</b> was added in
       OpenSSL 3.3.

       Support for <b>ML-KEM</b> was added in OpenSSL 3.5.

       OpenSSL 3.5 also introduces support for three <u>hybrid</u> ECDH PQ key exchange TLS groups: <b>X25519MLKEM768</b>,
       <b>SecP256r1MLKEM768</b> and <b>SecP384r1MLKEM1024</b>.  They offer CPU performance comparable to the associated ECDH
       group, though at the cost of significantly larger key exchange messages.  The third group,
       <b>SecP384r1MLKEM1024</b> is substantially more CPU-intensive, largely as a result of the high CPU cost of ECDH
       for the underlying <b>P-384</b> group.  Also its key exchange messages at close to 1700 bytes are larger than
       the roughly 1200 bytes for the first two groups.

       As of OpenSSL 3.5 key exchange group names are case-insensitive.

       <b>SSL_CTX_get0_implemented_groups</b> was first implemented in OpenSSL 3.5.

       Earlier versions of this document described the list as a preference order.  However, OpenSSL's behavior
       as a TLS 1.3 server is to consider <u>all</u> supported groups as comparable in security.
