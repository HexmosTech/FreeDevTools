</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Data::Dump::Filtered - Pretty printing with filtering

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The following functions are provided:

       add_dump_filter( \&amp;filter )
           This  registers  a filter function to be used by the regular <b>Data::Dump::dump()</b> function.  By default
           no filters are active.

           Since registering filters has a global effect is might be more appropriate to use the <b>dump_filtered()</b>
           function instead.

       remove_dump_filter( \&amp;filter )
           Unregister the given callback function as filter callback.  This undoes the effect of add_filter.

       dump_filtered(..., \&amp;filter )
           Works like <b>Data::Dump::dump()</b>, but the last argument  should  be  a  filter  callback  function.   As
           objects are visited the filter callback is invoked at it might influence how objects are dumped.

           Any  filters  registered  with  <b>add_filter()</b>  are  ignored when this interface is invoked.  Actually,
           passing "undef" as \&amp;filter is allowed and "dump_filtered(..., undef)" is the official way  to  force
           unfiltered dumps.

   <b>Filter</b> <b>callback</b>
       A  filter callback is a function that will be invoked with 2 arguments; a context object and reference to
       the object currently visited.  The return value should either be a hash reference or "undef".

           sub filter_callback {
               my($ctx, $object_ref) = @_;
               ...
               return { ... }
           }

       If the filter callback returns "undef" (or nothing) then normal processing and formatting of the  visited
       object happens.  If the filter callback returns a hash it might replace or annotate the representation of
       the current object.

   <b>Filter</b> <b>context</b>
       The context object provide methods that can be used to determine what kind of object is currently visited
       and where it's located.  The context object has the following interface:

       $ctx-&gt;object_ref
           Alternative way to obtain a reference to the current object

       $ctx-&gt;class
           If the object is blessed this return the class.  Returns "" for objects not blessed.

       $ctx-&gt;reftype
           Returns what kind of object this is.  It's a string like "SCALAR", "ARRAY", "HASH", "CODE",...

       $ctx-&gt;is_ref
           Returns true if a reference was provided.

       $ctx-&gt;is_blessed
           Returns true if the object is blessed.  Actually, this is just an alias for "$ctx-&gt;class".

       $ctx-&gt;is_array
           Returns true if the object is an array

       $ctx-&gt;is_hash
           Returns true if the object is a hash

       $ctx-&gt;is_scalar
           Returns true if the object is a scalar (a string or a number)

       $ctx-&gt;is_code
           Returns true if the object is a function (aka subroutine)

       $ctx-&gt;container_class
           Returns  the  class  of the innermost container that contains this object.  Returns "" if there is no
           blessed container.

       $ctx-&gt;container_self
           Returns an textual expression relative to the container object that names this object.  The  variable
           $self in this expression is the container itself.

       $ctx-&gt;object_isa( $class )
           Returns TRUE if the current object is of the given class or is of a subclass.

       $ctx-&gt;container_isa( $class )
           Returns TRUE if the innermost container is of the given class or is of a subclass.

       $ctx-&gt;depth
           Returns  how  many levels deep have we recursed into the structure (from the original <b>dump_filtered()</b>
           arguments).

       $ctx-&gt;expr
       $ctx-&gt;expr( $top_level_name )
           Returns an textual expression that denotes the current object.  In the expression $var is used as the
           name of the top level object dumped.  This can  be  overridden  by  providing  a  different  name  as
           argument.

   <b>Filter</b> <b>return</b> <b>hash</b>
       The following elements has significance in the returned hash:

       dump =&gt; $string
           incorporate the given string as the representation for the current value

       object =&gt; $value
           dump  the  given  value  instead  of the one visited and passed in as $object.  Basically the same as
           specifying "dump =&gt; Data::Dump::dump($value)".

       comment =&gt; $comment
           prefix the value with the given comment string

       bless =&gt; $class
           make it look as if the current object is of the given $class instead of the class it really  has  (if
           any).   The internals of the object is dumped in the regular way.  The $class can be the empty string
           to make Data::Dump pretend the object wasn't blessed at all.

       hide_keys =&gt; ['key1', 'key2',...]
       hide_keys =&gt; \&amp;code
           If the $object is a hash dump is as normal but pretend that the listed keys did not  exist.   If  the
           argument is a function then the function is called to determine if the given key should be hidden.
