</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       SDL_GL_GetProcAddress - Get an OpenGL function by name.

</pre><h4><b>HEADER</b> <b>FILE</b></h4><pre>
       Defined in SDL3/SDL_video.h

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>#include</b> <b>"SDL3/SDL.h"</b>

       <b>SDL_FunctionPointer</b> <b>SDL_GL_GetProcAddress(const</b> <b>char</b> <b>*proc);</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       If the GL library is loaded at runtime with

       <b>SDL_GL_LoadLibrary</b> (), then all GL functions must be retrieved this way. Usually this is used to retrieve
       function pointers to OpenGL extensions.

       There  are  some quirks to looking up OpenGL functions that require some extra care from the application.
       If you code carefully, you can handle these quirks without any platform-specific code, though:

       • On Windows, function pointers are specific to the current GL context;
         this means you need to have created a GL context and made it current
         before calling <b>SDL_GL_GetProcAddress</b> (). If you
         recreate your context or create a second context, you should assume that
         any existing function pointers aren't valid to use with it. This is
         (currently) a Windows-specific limitation, and in practice lots of
         drivers don't suffer this limitation, but it is still the way the wgl API
         is documented to work and you should expect crashes if you don't respect
         it. Store a copy of the function pointers that comes and goes with
         context lifespan.

       • On X11, function pointers returned by this function are valid for any
         context, and can even be looked up before a context is created at all.
         This means that, for at least some common OpenGL implementations, if you
         look up a function that doesn't exist, you'll get a non-NULL result that
         is _NOT_ safe to call. You must always make sure the function is actually
         available for a given GL context before calling it, by checking for the
         existence of the appropriate extension with

       <b>SDL_GL_ExtensionSupported</b> (), or verifying
         that the version of OpenGL you're using offers the function as core
         functionality.

       • Some OpenGL drivers, on all platforms, <u>will</u> return NULL if a function
         isn't supported, but you can't count on this behavior. Check for
         extensions you use, and if you get a NULL anyway, act as if that
         extension wasn't available. This is probably a bug in the driver, but you
         can code defensively for this scenario anyhow.

       • Just because you're on Linux/Unix, don't assume you'll be using X11.
         Next-gen display servers are waiting to replace it, and may or may not
         make the same promises about function pointers.

       • OpenGL function pointers must be declared <b>APIENTRY</b> as in the example
         code. This will ensure the proper calling convention is followed on
         platforms where this matters (Win32) thereby avoiding stack corruption.

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTION</b> <b>PARAMETERS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>proc</u>   the name of an OpenGL function.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       ( <b>SDL_FunctionPointer</b> ) Returns a pointer to the named OpenGL function. The returned  pointer  should  be
       cast to the appropriate function signature.

</pre><h4><b>THREAD</b> <b>SAFETY</b></h4><pre>
       This function should only be called on the main thread.

</pre><h4><b>AVAILABILITY</b></h4><pre>
       This function is available since SDL 3.2.0.
