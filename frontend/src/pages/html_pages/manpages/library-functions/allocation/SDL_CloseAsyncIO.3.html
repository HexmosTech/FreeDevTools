</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       SDL_CloseAsyncIO - Close and free any allocated resources for an async I/O object.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;SDL3/SDL_asyncio.h&gt;</b>

       <b>bool</b> <b>SDL_CloseAsyncIO(SDL_AsyncIO</b> <b>*asyncio,</b> <b>bool</b> <b>flush,</b> <b>SDL_AsyncIOQueue</b> <b>*queue,</b> <b>void</b> <b>*userdata);</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Closing  a  file  is  _also_  an  asynchronous task! If a write failure were to happen during the closing
       process, for example, the task results will report it as usual.

       Closing a file that has been written to does not guarantee the data has made it to physical media; it may
       remain in the operating system's file cache, for later writing to disk. This means that  a  successfully-
       closed  file can be lost if the system crashes or loses power in this small window. To prevent this, call
       this function with the <b>flush</b> parameter set to true. This will make the operation take longer, and perhaps
       increase system load in general, but a successful result guarantees that the data has made it to physical
       storage. Don't use this for temporary files, caches, and unimportant data,  and  definitely  use  it  for
       crucial irreplaceable files, like game saves.

       This  function  guarantees  that  the close will happen after any other pending tasks to <b>asyncio</b>, so it's
       safe to open a file, start several operations, close the file immediately, then  check  for  all  results
       later. This function will not block until the tasks have completed.

       Once  this  function  returns  true,  <b>asyncio</b>  is no longer valid, regardless of any future outcomes. Any
       completed tasks might still contain this pointer in their <b>SDL_AsyncIOOutcome</b> data, in case  the  app  was
       using this value to track information, but it should not be used again.

       If  this function returns false, the close wasn't started at all, and it's safe to attempt to close again
       later.

       An <b>SDL_AsyncIOQueue</b> must be specified. The newly-created task will be added to it when it  completes  its
       work.

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTION</b> <b>PARAMETERS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>asyncio</u>
              a pointer to an <b>SDL_AsyncIO</b> structure to close.

       <u>flush</u>  true if data should sync to disk before the task completes.

       <u>queue</u>  a queue to add the new <b>SDL_AsyncIO</b> to.

       <u>userdata</u>
              an app-defined pointer that will be provided with the task results.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       for more information.

</pre><h4><b>THREAD</b> <b>SAFETY</b></h4><pre>
       It  is  safe  to call this function from any thread, but two threads should not attempt to close the same
       object.

</pre><h4><b>AVAILABILITY</b></h4><pre>
       This function is available since SDL 3.2.0.
