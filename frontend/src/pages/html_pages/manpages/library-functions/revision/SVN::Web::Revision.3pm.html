         actions:
           ...
           revision:
             class: SVN::Web::Revision
             opts:
               max_diff_size: 200_000

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Shows information about a specific revision in a Subversion repository.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       The following configuration options may be specified in <u>config.yaml</u>.

       max_diff_size
           If  showing  the  diff  (see  "show_diff"), this determines the maximum size of the diff that will be
           shown.  If the size of the generated diff (in bytes) is larger than this figure then it is not shown.

           Defaults to 200,000 bytes.

       show_diff
           Boolean indicating whether or not a diff of every file that was changed in  the  revision  should  be
           shown.

           Defaults to 1.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       rev     The revision to show.  If not provided then use the repository's youngest revision.

</pre><h4><b>TEMPLATE</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       context Always "revision".

       rev     The revision that is being shown.

       youngest_rev
               The  repository's  youngest  revision.   This  is  useful  when  constructing "next revision" and
               "previous revision" links.

       date    The date on which the revision was committed, formatted according to "Time and  date  formatting"
               in SVN::Web.

       author  The revision's author.

       msg     The log message associated with this revision.

       paths   A  hash  of  hash  refs.   Each  key  is  a  path name.  The value is a further hash ref with the
               following keys.

               isdir   A boolean value, true if the given path is a directory.

               diff    A SVN::Web::DiffParser object representing the diff.  This may be undef, if the generated
                       diff was larger than "max_diff_size" or if "show_diff" is false.

               diff_size
                       The size of the generated diff (before parsing).

               max_diff_size
                       The configured maximum diff size.

               action  A single letter indicating the action that carried out on the path.  A  file  was  either
                       added "A", modified "M", replaced "R", or deleted "D".

               copyfrom
                       If the file was copied from another file then this is the path of the source of the copy.

               copyfromrev
                       If  the  file  was copied from another file then this is the revision of the file that it
                       was copied form.
