       Mail::Bulkmail::DummyServer - dummy class for dummy server objects

</pre><h4><b>AUTHOR</b></h4><pre>
       Jim Thomason, <a href="mailto:jim@jimandkoka.com">jim@jimandkoka.com</a>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Mail::Bulkmail::DummyServer is a drop in replacement for Mail::Bulkmail::Server.

       Sometimes you just want to test things on your end - make sure your list iterates properly, make sure
       your mail merge is functioning fine, make sure your logging functions are correct, whatever.  And in
       those cases, you probably don't want to worry about futzing around with your SMTP relay and sending junk
       messages through it that you don't care about. Not to mention the fact that those probably will need to
       be inspected and deleted later. A hassle for debugging.

       Enter DummyServer. This is a subclass of Mail::Bulkmail::Server that behaves exactly the same except for
       the fact that it doesn't actually connect to a server. Instead, it sends all data that would be going to
       the server to a file instead. This file should be specified in the conf file.

        #in your conf file
        define package Mail::Bulkmail::DummyServer
        dummy_file     = ./my.dummy.file

       Now, instead of sending commands to your SMTP relay, they'll get sent to ./my.dummy.file for easy
       inspection at a later date.

</pre><h4><b>CLASS</b> <b>ATTRIBUTES</b></h4><pre>
       dummy_file Stores the dummy_file that you want to output your data to.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       connect    "connects"  to  your DummyServer. Actually, internally it ties a filehandle onto this package.
                  Yes, this thing has a (minimal) implementation of a tied handle class to accomplish this feat.

                  This method is known to return

                   MBDu001 - server won't say EHLO

       disconnect overloaded disconnect method. Wipes out the internal socket as usual, but doesn't try  to  say
                  RSET or QUIT to the server.

                  disconnect  can  also  disconnect  quietly,  i.e.,  it won't try to issue a RSET and then quit
                  before closing the socket.

                   $server-&gt;disconnect();                         #issues RSET and quit
                   $server-&gt;disconnect('quietly');        #issues nothing
