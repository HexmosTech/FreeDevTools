       short-lived, popup surfaces for menus

       A popup surface is a short-lived, temporary surface. It can be used to implement for example menus,
       popovers, tooltips and other similar user interface concepts.

       A popup can be made to take an explicit grab. See xdg_popup.grab for details.

       When the popup is dismissed, a popup_done event will be sent out, and at the same time the surface will
       be unmapped. See the xdg_popup.popup_done event for details.

       Explicitly destroying the xdg_popup object will also dismiss the popup and unmap the surface. Clients
       that want to dismiss the popup when another surface of their own is clicked should dismiss the popup
       using the destroy request.

       The parent surface must have either the xdg_toplevel or xdg_popup surface role.

       A newly created xdg_popup will be stacked on top of all previously created xdg_popup surfaces associated
       with the same xdg_toplevel.

       The parent of an xdg_popup must be mapped (see the xdg_surface description) before the xdg_popup itself.

       The x and y arguments passed when creating the popup object specify where the top left of the popup
       should be placed, relative to the local surface coordinates of the parent surface. See
       xdg_surface.get_popup. An xdg_popup must intersect with or be at least partially adjacent to its parent
       surface.

       The client must call wl_surface.commit on the corresponding wl_surface for the xdg_popup state to take
       effect.

   <b>enum</b> <b>class</b> <b>wayland::proxy_t::wrapper_type</b> <b>[strong],</b>  <b>[inherited]</b>
       Underlying wl_proxy type and properties of a <b>proxy_t</b> that affect construction, destruction, and event
       handling

       <b>Enumerator</b>

       <u>standard</u>
              C pointer is a standard type compatible with wl_proxy*. Events are dispatched and it is destructed
              when the <b>proxy_t</b> is destructed. User data is set.

       <u>display</u>
              C  pointer  is  a  wl_display*. No events are dispatched, wl_display_disconnect is called when the
              <b>proxy_t</b> is destructed. User data is set.

       <u>foreign</u>
              C pointer is a standard type compatible with wl_proxy*, but another library owns it and it  should
              not  be  touched  in  a  way  that  could affect the operation of the other library. No events are
              dispatched, wl_proxy_destroy is not called when the  <b>proxy_t</b>  is  destructed,  user  data  is  not
              touched.  Consequently,  there is no reference counting for the <b>proxy_t</b>. Lifetime of such wrappers
              should preferably be short to minimize the chance that the owning library decides to  destroy  the
              wl_proxy.

       <u>proxy_wrapper</u>
              C  pointer  is  a  wl_proxy*  that  was  constructed  with  wl_proxy_create_wrapper. No events are
              dispatched, wl_proxy_wrapper_destroy is called when the <b>proxy_t</b> is destroyed.  Reference  counting
              is  active.  A reference to the <b>proxy_t</b> creating this proxy wrapper is held to extend its lifetime
              until after the proxy wrapper is destroyed.

   <b>wl_proxy</b> <b>*</b> <b>wayland::proxy_t::c_ptr</b> <b>()</b> <b>const</b> <b>[inherited]</b>
       Get a pointer to the underlying C struct.

       <b>Returns</b>
           The underlying wl_proxy wrapped by this <b>proxy_t</b> if it exists, otherwise an exception is thrown

   <b>std::string</b> <b>wayland::proxy_t::get_class</b> <b>()</b> <b>const</b> <b>[inherited]</b>
       Get the interface name (class) of a proxy object.

       <b>Returns</b>
           The interface name of the object associated with the proxy

   <b>uint32_t</b> <b>wayland::proxy_t::get_id</b> <b>()</b> <b>const</b> <b>[inherited]</b>
       Get the id of a proxy object.

       <b>Returns</b>
           The id the object associated with the proxy

   <b>uint32_t</b> <b>wayland::proxy_t::get_version</b> <b>()</b> <b>const</b> <b>[inherited]</b>
       Get the protocol object version of a proxy object. Gets the protocol object version of a proxy object, or
       0 if the proxy was created with unversioned API.

       A returned value of 0 means that no version information is  available,  so  the  caller  must  make  safe
       assumptions about the object's real version.

       <b>display_t</b> will always return version 0.

       <b>Returns</b>
           The protocol object version of the proxy or 0

   <b>wrapper_type</b> <b>wayland::proxy_t::get_wrapper_type</b> <b>()</b> <b>const</b> <b>[inline],</b>  <b>[inherited]</b>
       Get the type of a proxy object.

   <b>void</b> <b>zxdg_popup_v6_t::grab</b> <b>(seat_t</b> <b>const</b> <b>&amp;</b> <b>seat,</b> <b>uint32_t</b> <b>serial)</b>
       make the popup take an explicit grab

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>seat</u> the wl_seat of the user event
           <u>serial</u> the serial of the user event

       This  request  makes the created popup take an explicit grab. An explicit grab will be dismissed when the
       user dismisses the popup, or when the client destroys the  xdg_popup.  This  can  be  done  by  the  user
       clicking outside the surface, using the keyboard, or even locking the screen through closing the lid or a
       timeout.

       If the compositor denies the grab, the popup will be immediately dismissed.

       This  request  must  be  used  in response to some sort of user action like a button press, key press, or
       touch down event. The serial number of the event should be passed as 'serial'.

       The parent of a grabbing popup must either be an  xdg_toplevel  surface  or  another  xdg_popup  with  an
       explicit  grab.  If  the parent is another xdg_popup it means that the popups are nested, with this popup
       now being the topmost popup.

       Nested popups must be destroyed in the reverse order they were created in, e.g. the only  popup  you  are
       allowed to destroy at all times is the topmost one.

       When  compositors choose to dismiss a popup, they may dismiss every nested grabbing popup as well. When a
       compositor dismisses popups, it will follow the same dismissing order as required from the client.

       The parent of a grabbing popup must either be another xdg_popup with  an  active  explicit  grab,  or  an
       xdg_popup or xdg_toplevel, if there are no explicit grabs already taken.

       If the topmost grabbing popup is destroyed, the grab will be returned to the parent of the popup, if that
       parent previously had an explicit grab.

       If  the  parent  is  a  grabbing  popup  which has already been dismissed, this popup will be immediately
       dismissed. If the parent is a popup that did not take an explicit grab, an error will be raised.

       During a popup grab, the client owning the grab will receive pointer  and  touch  events  for  all  their
       surfaces as normal (similar to an 'owner-events' grab in X11 parlance), while the top most grabbing popup
       will always have keyboard focus.

   <b>std::function&lt;</b> <b>void(int32_t,</b> <b>int32_t,</b> <b>int32_t,</b> <b>int32_t)&gt;</b> <b>&amp;</b> <b>zxdg_popup_v6_t::on_configure</b> <b>()</b>
       configure the popup surface

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>x</u> x position relative to parent surface window geometry
           <u>y</u> y position relative to parent surface window geometry
           <u>width</u> window geometry width
           <u>height</u> window geometry height

       This  event  asks  the  popup  surface  to configure itself given the configuration. The configured state
       should not be applied immediately. See xdg_surface.configure for details.

       The x and y arguments represent the position the popup was  placed  at  given  the  xdg_positioner  rule,
       relative to the upper left corner of the window geometry of the parent surface.

           <u>queue</u> The event queue that will handle this proxy

       Assign  proxy  to  event queue. Events coming from proxy will be queued in queue instead of the display's
       main queue.
