</pre><h4><b>Detailed</b> <b>Description</b></h4><pre>
       short-lived, popup surfaces for menus

       A popup surface is a short-lived, temporary surface. It can be used to implement for example menus,
       popovers, tooltips and other similar user interface concepts.

       A popup can be made to take an explicit grab. See xdg_popup.grab for details.

       When the popup is dismissed, a popup_done event will be sent out, and at the same time the surface will
       be unmapped. See the xdg_popup.popup_done event for details.

       Explicitly destroying the xdg_popup object will also dismiss the popup and unmap the surface. Clients
       that want to dismiss the popup when another surface of their own is clicked should dismiss the popup
       using the destroy request.

       A newly created xdg_popup will be stacked on top of all previously created xdg_popup surfaces associated
       with the same xdg_toplevel.

       The parent of an xdg_popup must be mapped (see the xdg_surface description) before the xdg_popup itself.

       The client must call wl_surface.commit on the corresponding wl_surface for the xdg_popup state to take
       effect.

   <b>bool</b> <b>xdg_popup_t::can_repositioned</b> <b>()</b> <b>const</b>
       Check whether the <b>repositioned</b> function is available with the currently bound version of the protocol.

       Definition at line <b>1476</b> of file <b>wayland-server-protocol-extra.cpp</b>.

   <b>void</b> <b>xdg_popup_t::configure</b> <b>(int32_t</b> <b>x,</b> <b>int32_t</b> <b>y,</b> <b>int32_t</b> <b>width,</b> <b>int32_t</b> <b>height,</b> <b>bool</b> <b>post</b> <b>=</b> <b>true)</b>
       configure the popup surface

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>x</u> x position relative to parent surface window geometry
           <u>y</u> y position relative to parent surface window geometry
           <u>width</u> window geometry width
           <u>height</u> window geometry height

       This event asks the popup surface to configure itself given the configuration. The configured state
       should not be applied immediately. See xdg_surface.configure for details.

       The x and y arguments represent the position the popup was placed at given the xdg_positioner rule,
       relative to the upper left corner of the window geometry of the parent surface.

       For version 2 or older, the configure event for an xdg_popup is only ever sent once for the initial
       configuration. Starting with version 3, it may be sent again if the popup is setup with an xdg_positioner
       with set_reactive requested, or in response to xdg_popup.reposition requests.

   <b>std::string</b> <b>wayland::server::resource_t::get_class</b> <b>()</b> <b>[inherited]</b>
       Retrieve the interface name (class) of a resource object.

       <b>Returns</b>
           Interface name of the resource object.

   <b>client_t</b> <b>wayland::server::resource_t::get_client</b> <b>()</b> <b>const</b> <b>[inherited]</b>
       Get the associated client

       <b>Returns</b>
           the client that owns the resource.

   <b>uint32_t</b> <b>wayland::server::resource_t::get_id</b> <b>()</b> <b>const</b> <b>[inherited]</b>
       Get the internal ID of the resource

       <b>Returns</b>
           the internal ID of the resource

   <b>unsigned</b> <b>int</b> <b>wayland::server::resource_t::get_version</b> <b>()</b> <b>const</b> <b>[inherited]</b>
       Get interface version

       <b>Returns</b>
           Interface version this resource has been constructed with.

   <b>std::function&lt;</b> <b>void()&gt;</b> <b>&amp;</b> <b>xdg_popup_t::on_destroy</b> <b>()</b>
       remove xdg_popup interface This destroys the popup. Explicitly destroying the xdg_popup object will also
       dismiss the popup, and unmap the surface.

       If this xdg_popup is not the 'topmost' popup, a protocol error will be sent.

       Definition at line <b>1443</b> of file <b>wayland-server-protocol-extra.cpp</b>.

   <b>std::function&lt;</b> <b>void(seat_t,</b> <b>uint32_t)&gt;</b> <b>&amp;</b> <b>xdg_popup_t::on_grab</b> <b>()</b>
       make the popup take an explicit grab

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>seat</u> the wl_seat of the user event
           <u>serial</u> the serial of the user event

       This request makes the created popup take an explicit grab. An explicit grab will be dismissed when the
       user dismisses the popup, or when the client destroys the xdg_popup. This can be done by the user
       clicking outside the surface, using the keyboard, or even locking the screen through closing the lid or a
       timeout.

       If the compositor denies the grab, the popup will be immediately dismissed.

       This request must be used in response to some sort of user action like a button press, key press, or
       touch down event. The serial number of the event should be passed as 'serial'.

       The parent of a grabbing popup must either be an xdg_toplevel surface or another xdg_popup with an
       explicit grab. If the parent is another xdg_popup it means that the popups are nested, with this popup
       now being the topmost popup.

       Nested popups must be destroyed in the reverse order they were created in, e.g. the only popup you are
       allowed to destroy at all times is the topmost one.

       When compositors choose to dismiss a popup, they may dismiss every nested grabbing popup as well. When a
       compositor dismisses popups, it will follow the same dismissing order as required from the client.

       The parent of a grabbing popup must either be another xdg_popup with an active explicit grab, or an
       xdg_popup or xdg_toplevel, if there are no explicit grabs already taken.

       If the topmost grabbing popup is destroyed, the grab will be returned to the parent of the popup, if that
       parent previously had an explicit grab.

       If the parent is a grabbing popup which has already been dismissed, this popup will be immediately
       dismissed. If the parent is a popup that did not take an explicit grab, an error will be raised.

       During a popup grab, the client owning the grab will receive pointer and touch events for all their
       surfaces as normal (similar to an 'owner-events' grab in X11 parlance), while the top most grabbing popup
       will always have keyboard focus.

   <b>std::function&lt;</b> <b>void(xdg_positioner_t,</b> <b>uint32_t)&gt;</b> <b>&amp;</b> <b>xdg_popup_t::on_reposition</b> <b>()</b>
       recalculate the popup's location

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>positioner</u>
           <u>token</u> reposition request token

       Reposition an already-mapped popup. The popup will be placed given the details in the passed
       xdg_positioner object, and a xdg_popup.repositioned followed by xdg_popup.configure and
       xdg_surface.configure will be emitted in response. Any parameters set by the previous positioner will be
       discarded.

       The passed token will be sent in the corresponding xdg_popup.repositioned event. The new popup position
       will not take effect until the corresponding configure event is acknowledged by the client. See
       xdg_popup.repositioned for details. The token itself is opaque, and has no other special meaning.

       If multiple reposition requests are sent, the compositor may skip all but the last one.

       If the popup is repositioned in response to a configure event for its parent, the client should send an
       xdg_positioner.set_parent_configure and possibly an xdg_positioner.set_parent_size request to allow the
       compositor to properly constrain the popup.

       If the popup is repositioned together with a parent that is being resized, but not in response to a
       configure event, the client should send an xdg_positioner.set_parent_size request.

   <b>void</b> <b>xdg_popup_t::popup_done</b> <b>(bool</b> <b>post</b> <b>=</b> <b>true)</b>
       popup interaction is done The popup_done event is sent out when a popup is dismissed by the compositor.
       The client should destroy the xdg_popup object at this point.

   <b>void</b> <b>xdg_popup_t::post_invalid_grab</b> <b>(std::string</b> <b>const</b> <b>&amp;</b> <b>msg)</b>
       Post error: tried to grab after being mapped.

       Definition at line <b>1481</b> of file <b>wayland-server-protocol-extra.cpp</b>.

   <b>void</b> <b>wayland::server::resource_t::post_no_memory</b> <b>()</b> <b>const</b> <b>[inherited]</b>
       Post 'not enough memory' error to the client

       If the compositor has not enough memory to fulfill a certail request of the client, this function can be
       called to notify the client of this circumstance.

   <b>bool</b> <b>wayland::server::resource_t::proxy_has_object</b> <b>()</b> <b>const</b> <b>[inherited]</b>
       Check whether this wrapper actually wraps an object.

       <b>Returns</b>
           true if there is an underlying object, false if this wrapper is empty

   <b>void</b> <b>xdg_popup_t::repositioned</b> <b>(uint32_t</b> <b>token,</b> <b>bool</b> <b>post</b> <b>=</b> <b>true)</b>
       signal the completion of a repositioned request

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>token</u> reposition request token

       The repositioned event is sent as part of a popup configuration sequence, together with
       xdg_popup.configure and lastly xdg_surface.configure to notify the completion of a reposition request.

       The repositioned event is to notify about the completion of a xdg_popup.reposition request. The token
       argument is the token passed in the xdg_popup.reposition request.

       Immediately after this event is emitted, xdg_popup.configure and xdg_surface.configure will be sent with
       the updated size and position, as well as a new configure serial.

       The client should optionally update the content of the popup, but must acknowledge the new popup
       configuration for the new position to take effect. See xdg_surface.ack_configure for details.
