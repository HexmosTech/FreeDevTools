</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Xray::Absorption::Elam - Perl interface to the Elam tables

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
          use Xray::Absorption;
          Xray::Absorption -&gt; load("elam");

       See the documentation for Xray::Absorption for details.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module is inherited by the Xray::Absorption module and provides access to the data contained in the
       1999 Elam tables of absorption cross-sections and line and edge energies.

       The data in this module, here referred to as "The Elam Tables", will be published real soon.  The
       compilation of data is the work of Tim Elam (<a href="mailto:tim.elam@nrl.navy.mil">tim.elam@nrl.navy.mil</a>).

       The data is contained in a database file called <u>elam.db</u> which is generated at install time from a flat
       text database of the Elam data.  The data is stored in a Storable archive using "network" ordering.  This
       allows speedy disk and memory access along with network and platform portability.

       The required "Chemistry::Elements", "Math::Spline", and "Math::Derivative" modules are available from
       CPAN.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       The behaviour of the "get_energy" method in this module is a bit different from other modules used by
       "Xray::Absorption".  This section describes methods which behave differently for this data resource and
       methods offered by this module which are not available for other resources.

       "get_energy"
           Example:

              $energy = Xray::Absorption -&gt; get_energy($elem, $edge)

           This  behaves  similarly  to  the  "get_energy"  method  of  othe  resources,  except  there are some
           differences regarding the syntax of specifying $edge.  When using the Elam data resource,  $edge  can
           be  any  of  K,  L1-L3,  M1-M5,  N1-N7, O1-O7, or P1-P3.  To get a fluorescence line, you may use any
           Siegbahn or IUPAC symbol to specify the line.  See the pod in "Xray::Absorption"  for  details  about
           these symbols.  You may also specify a "generic" Siegbahn symbol, such as Kalpha.  The energy that is
           returned  depends  on  the  value  of  an  internal variable which may be set using the "line_toggle"
           method.  If the toggle is set to "brightest", the energy of  the  brightest  line  of  the  class  is
           returned.  In the case of "Kalpha", the energy or the Kalpha1 line is returned.  If the toggle is set
           to  "weighted"  then  the  intestity  weighted  average energy of all lines of the class is returned.
           "weighted" is the default.

       "line_toggle"
           Toggle the method of computing a generic fluorescence line between "weighted" and "brightest".   This
           determines the response to a use of "get_energy" like this:

             $energy = Xray::Absorption -&gt; line_toggle("brightest");
             $energy = Xray::Absorption -&gt; get_energy("cu", "kalpha");
             $energy = Xray::Absorption -&gt; line_toggle("wieghted");
             $energy = Xray::Absorption -&gt; get_energy("cu", "kalpha");

           When  "weighted" is selected, this returns the intensity weighted energy of the various Kalpha lines.
           When "brightest" is chosen, this returns the energy of the Kalpha1 line because that is the brightest
           Kalpha line.  The default is "weighted".  Case does not matter for the argument, but  spelling  does.
           If the argument is not spelled correctly then the calculation method is not toggled.

       "fluor_yield"
           Return the fluorescence yield for an atomic symbol and edge

             $fyield = Xray::Absorption -&gt; fluor_yield("cu", "k");

           The  value returned is the probability of an fluorescent x-ray being emitted for an absorption event.
           Data comes from M. O. Krause, J. Phys. Chem. Ref. Data 8, 307 (1979) Returns -1 for non-interpretable
           input

       "edge_jump"
           Return edge jump ratio for an atomic symbol and edge

             $jump = Xray::Absorption -&gt; edge_jump("cu", "k");

           The value returned  is  the  ratio  of  the  above-edge  absorption  coefficient  to  the  below-edge
           coefficient

       "get_intesity"
           Example:

              $intensity = Xray::Absorption -&gt; get_intesity($elem, $symbol)

           Get  the  relative amount of the line specified by $symbol for the element $elem.  $elem can be a two
           letter symbol, a full name, or a Z number.  $symbol may be either a Siegbahn or  IUPAC  symbol.   The
           intesities  are such that all lines of a type (e.g. all Kalpha lines) have intesities which sum to 1.
           If $elem or $symbol is not recognized, then this returns 0.

       "cross_section"
           Example:

              $xsec = Xray::Absorption -&gt; cross_section($elem, $energy, $mode);

              @xsec = Xray::Absorption -&gt; cross_section($elem, \@energy, $mode);

           The $mode argument is different here than for the other resources.  The options are "xsec",  "photo",
           "coherent"  and  "incoherent",  telling  this  method  to  return  the full cross-section or just the
           photoelectric, coherent, or incoherent portions.

           The values for all cross-sections are computed using spline interpolation as described in  the  paper
           by Elam, Ravel, and Siebert.

</pre><h4><b>EDGE</b> <b>AND</b> <b>LINE</b> <b>ENERGIES</b></h4><pre>
       The  Elam  data resource provides a fairly complete set of edge and line energies.  Any edge tabulated on
       the Gwyn William's Table of Electron Binding Energies for the Elements (that's the one published by  NSLS
       and  on  the door of just about every hutch at NSLS) is in the Elam data resource.  Additionally, a large
       but not exhaustive collection of line energies is tabulated.  Every line in the table in the <b>SYMBOLS</b>  <b>FOR</b>
       <b>FLUORESCENCE</b> <b>LINES</b> section of the "Absorption.pm" pod is included in the Elam tables.  A reasonable value
       for  the  relative  line  intensity  if  also  included  in  this  table.  See (the elam reference) for a
       discussion of which lines were included in the tables and how the intensities were calculated.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>THINGS</b> <b>TO</b> <b>DO</b></h4><pre>
       •   The "weighted" option for "get_energy" is not quite right in that it counts in lines  from  different
           edges.   While  that might be appropriate, there is some question as to the relative weights of lines
           from different edges.  So a better solution would be to only use lines from the edge  directly  below
           the chosen energy.
