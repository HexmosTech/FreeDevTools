</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This probe measures RADIUS (RFC 2865) authentication latency for SmokePing.

       The username to be tested is specified in either the probe-specific or the target-specific variable
       `username', with the target-specific one overriding the probe-specific one.

       The password can be specified either (in order of precedence, with the latter overriding the former) in
       the probe-specific variable `password', in an external file or in the target-specific variable
       `password'.  The location of this file is given in the probe-specific variable `passwordfile'. See
       <b>Smokeping::probes::<a href="../man3pm/passwordchecker.3pm.html">passwordchecker</a></b>(3pm) for the format of this file (summary: colon-separated triplets of
       the form `&lt;host&gt;:&lt;username&gt;:&lt;password&gt;')

       The RADIUS protocol requires a shared secret between the server and the client.  This secret can be
       specified either (in order of precedence, with the latter overriding the former) in the probe-specific
       variable `secret', in an external file or in the target-specific variable `secret'.  This external file
       is located by the probe-specific variable `secretfile', and it should contain whitespace-separated pairs
       of the form `&lt;host&gt; &lt;secret&gt;'. Comments and blank lines are OK.

       If the optional probe-specific variable `nas_ip_address' is specified, its value is inserted into the
       authentication requests as the `NAS-IP-Address' RADIUS attribute.

       The probe tries to be nice to the server and does not send authentication requests more frequently than
       once every X seconds, where X is the value of the target-specific "min_interval" variable (1 by default).

</pre><h4><b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       Supported probe-specific variables:

       forks
           Run this many concurrent processes at maximum

           Example value: 5

           Default value: 5

       offset
           If you run many probes concurrently you may want to prevent them from hitting your network all at the
           same time. Using the probe-specific offset parameter you can change the point in time when each probe
           will be run. Offset is specified in % of total interval, or alternatively as 'random', and the offset
           from  the  'General'  section is used if nothing is specified here. Note that this does NOT influence
           the rrds itself, it is just a matter of when data acquisition is initiated.  (This variable  is  only
           applicable if the variable 'concurrentprobes' is set in the 'General' section.)

           Example value: 50%

       passwordfile
           Location of the file containing usernames and passwords.

           Example value: /some/place/secret

       secretfile
           A  file  containing the RADIUS shared secrets for the targets. It should contain whitespace-separated
           pairs of the form `&lt;host&gt; &lt;secret&gt;'. Comments and blank lines are OK.

           Example value: /another/place/secret

       step
           Duration of the base interval that this probe should use, if different from the one specified in  the
           'Database'  section. Note that the step in the RRD files is fixed when they are originally generated,
           and if you change the step parameter afterwards, you'll have to delete the old RRD files  or  somehow
           convert  them.  (This  variable  is  only applicable if the variable 'concurrentprobes' is set in the
           'General' section.)

           Example value: 300

       Supported target-specific variables:

       /^influx_.+/
           This is a tag that will be sent to influxdb and has no impact on the probe measurement. The tag  name
           will  be  sent  without the "influx_" prefix, which will be replaced with "tag_" instead. Tags can be
           used for filtering.

           Example value: influx_location = In the basement

       allowreject
           Treat "reject" responses as OK

           Example value: true

       mininterval
           The minimum interval between each authentication request sent, in (possibly fractional) seconds.

           Default value: 1

       nas_ip_address
           The NAS-IP-Address RADIUS attribute for the authentication requests. Not needed everywhere.

           Example value: 10.1.2.3

       password
           The password for the user, if not present in the password file.

           Example value: test-password

       pings
           How many pings should be sent to each target, if different from the global  value  specified  in  the
           Database  section.  Note  that the number of pings in the RRD files is fixed when they are originally
           generated, and if you change this parameter afterwards, you'll have to delete the old  RRD  files  or
           somehow convert them.

           Example value: 5

       port
           The RADIUS port to be used

           Example value: 1645

       secret
           The RADIUS shared secret for the target, if not present in the secrets file.

           Example value: test-secret

       timeout
           Timeout in seconds for the RADIUS queries.

           Default value: 5

       username
           The username to be tested.

           Example value: test-user

           This setting is mandatory.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       There should be a more general way of specifying RADIUS attributes.
