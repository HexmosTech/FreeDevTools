        *** Targets ***

        probe = SendEmail # if this should be the default probe

        # [...]

        + mytarget
        # probe = SendEmail # if the default probe is something else

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This probe actually send a mail to a MX server and measure time it took. You can choose the sender and
       recipient address as well as the size of the mail.

</pre><h4><b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       Supported probe-specific variables:

       bodysize
           Size  of  the  mail to send in bytes. If set to 0, a default mail content will be set. Note that mail
           always contain From, To and Subject headers.

           Example value: 1024

           Default value: 0

       forks
           Run this many concurrent processes at maximum

           Example value: 5

           Default value: 5

       from
           Mail from address

           Example value: <a href="mailto:test@test.com">test@test.com</a>

           This setting is mandatory.

       offset
           If you run many probes concurrently you may want to prevent them from hitting your network all at the
           same time. Using the probe-specific offset parameter you can change the point in time when each probe
           will be run. Offset is specified in % of total interval, or alternatively as 'random', and the offset
           from the 'General' section is used if nothing is specified here. Note that this  does  NOT  influence
           the  rrds  itself, it is just a matter of when data acquisition is initiated.  (This variable is only
           applicable if the variable 'concurrentprobes' is set in the 'General' section.)

           Example value: 50%

       step
           Duration of the base interval that this probe should use, if different from the one specified in  the
           'Database'  section. Note that the step in the RRD files is fixed when they are originally generated,
           and if you change the step parameter afterwards, you'll have to delete the old RRD files  or  somehow
           convert  them.  (This  variable  is  only applicable if the variable 'concurrentprobes' is set in the
           'General' section.)

           Example value: 300

       subject
           Subject of the mail

           Example value: Test Smokeping

           Default value: Test

       timeout
           How long a single 'ping' takes at maximum

           Example value: 15

           Default value: 5

       to  Rcpt to address

           Example value: <a href="mailto:test@test.com">test@test.com</a>

           This setting is mandatory.

       Supported target-specific variables:

       /^influx_.+/
           This is a tag that will be sent to influxdb and has no impact on the probe measurement. The tag  name
           will  be  sent  without the "influx_" prefix, which will be replaced with "tag_" instead. Tags can be
           used for filtering.

           Example value: influx_location = In the basement

       pings
           How many pings should be sent to each target, if different from the global  value  specified  in  the
           Database  section.  Note  that the number of pings in the RRD files is fixed when they are originally
           generated, and if you change this parameter afterwards, you'll have to delete the old  RRD  files  or
           somehow convert them.

           Example value: 5

       port
           Port of the SMTP server to reach

           Example value: 25

           Default value: 25
