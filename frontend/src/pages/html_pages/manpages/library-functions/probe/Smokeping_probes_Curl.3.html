</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       (see <b><a href="../man1/curl.1.html">curl</a></b>(1) for details of the options below)

</pre><h4><b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       Supported probe-specific variables:

       binary
           The location of your curl binary.

           Default value: <a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?curl">/usr/bin/curl</a>

       forks
           Run this many concurrent processes at maximum

           Example value: 5

           Default value: 5

       offset
           If you run many probes concurrently you may want to prevent them from hitting your network all at the
           same time. Using the probe-specific offset parameter you can change the point in time when each probe
           will be run. Offset is specified in % of total interval, or alternatively as 'random', and the offset
           from  the  'General'  section is used if nothing is specified here. Note that this does NOT influence
           the rrds itself, it is just a matter of when data acquisition is initiated.  (This variable  is  only
           applicable if the variable 'concurrentprobes' is set in the 'General' section.)

           Example value: 50%

       step
           Duration  of the base interval that this probe should use, if different from the one specified in the
           'Database' section. Note that the step in the RRD files is fixed when they are originally  generated,
           and  if  you change the step parameter afterwards, you'll have to delete the old RRD files or somehow
           convert them. (This variable is only applicable if the variable  'concurrentprobes'  is  set  in  the
           'General' section.)

           Example value: 300

       Supported target-specific variables:

       /^influx_.+/
           This  is a tag that will be sent to influxdb and has no impact on the probe measurement. The tag name
           will be sent without the "influx_" prefix, which will be replaced with "tag_" instead.  Tags  can  be
           used for filtering.

           Example value: influx_location = In the basement

       agent
           The  "-A"  <b><a href="../man1/curl.1.html">curl</a></b>(1)  option.  This is a full HTTP User-Agent header including the words "User-Agent:".
           Note that it does not need any quotes around it.

           Example value: User-Agent: Lynx/2.8.4rel.1 libwww-FM/2.14 SSL-MM/1.4.1 OpenSSL/0.9.6c

       expect
           Require the given text to appear somewhere in the response, otherwise probe is treated as a failure

           Example value: Status: green

           Default value:

       extraargs
           Any extra arguments you might want to hand to <b><a href="../man1/curl.1.html">curl</a></b>(1). The  arguments  should  be  separated  by  the
           regexp specified in "extrare", which contains just the space character (" ") by default.

           Note  that  curl  will be called with the resulting list of arguments without any shell expansion. If
           you need to specify any arguments containing spaces, you should set "extrare" to something else.

           As a complicated example, to explicitly set the "Host:" header in Curl  requests,  you  need  to  set
           "extrare"   to   something   else,   eg.   "/;/",   and  then  specify  "extraargs  =  --header;Host:
           www.example.com".

           Example value: -6 --head --user user:password

       extrare
           The regexp used to split the extraargs string into an argument  list,  in  the  "/regexp/"  notation.
           This  contains  just  the  space character (" ") by default, but if you need to specify any arguments
           containing spaces, you can set this variable to a different value.

           Example value: / /

           Default value: / /

       follow_redirects
           If this variable is set to 'yes', curl will follow any HTTP redirection steps (the '-L' option).   If
           set to 'no', HTTP Location: headers will not be followed. See also 'include_redirects'.

           Example value: yes

           Default value: no

       include_redirects
           If this variable is set to 'yes', the measurement result will include the time spent on following any
           HTTP redirection steps. If set to 'no', only the last step is measured. See also 'follow_redirects'.

           Example value: yes

           Default value: no

       insecure_ssl
           The  "-k"  <b><a href="../man1/curl.1.html">curl</a></b>(1)  option.  Accept  SSL  connections that don't have a secure certificate chain to a
           trusted CA. Note that if you are going to monitor https  targets,  you'll  probably  have  to  either
           enable  this  option  or  specify the CA path to curl through extraargs below. For more info, see the
           <b><a href="../man1/curl.1.html">curl</a></b>(1) manual page.

           Example value: 1

       interface
           The "--interface" <b><a href="../man1/curl.1.html">curl</a></b>(1) option.  Bind to a specific interface, IP address or host name.

           Example value: eth0

       pings
           How many pings should be sent to each target, if different from the global  value  specified  in  the
           Database  section.  Note  that the number of pings in the RRD files is fixed when they are originally
           generated, and if you change this parameter afterwards, you'll have to delete the old  RRD  files  or
           somehow convert them.

           Example value: 5

       require_zero_status
           If  this  variable is set to 'yes', responses will only be counted if Curl's exit status is '0'. This
           is useful for reporting timeouts as losses rather than delayed responses.

           Example value: yes

           Default value: no

       ssl2
           The "-2" <b><a href="../man1/curl.1.html">curl</a></b>(1) option.  Force SSL2.

           Example value: 1

       timeout
           The "-m" <b><a href="../man1/curl.1.html">curl</a></b>(1) option.  Maximum timeout in seconds.

           Example value: 20

           Default value: 10

       urlformat
           The template of the URL to fetch.  Can be any one that curl supports.  Any occurrence of  the  string
           '%host%' will be replaced with the host to be probed.

           Example value: http://%host%/

           This setting is mandatory.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       You should consider setting a lower value for the "pings" variable than the default 20, as repetitive URL
       fetching may be quite heavy on the server.

       The URL to be tested used to be specified by the variable 'url' in earlier versions of Smokeping, and the
       'host'  setting  did  not influence it in any way. The variable name has now been changed to 'urlformat',
       and it can (and in most cases should) contain a placeholder for the 'host' variable.
