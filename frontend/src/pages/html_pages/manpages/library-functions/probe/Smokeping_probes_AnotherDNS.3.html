</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Like DNS, but uses Net::DNS and Time::HiRes instead of dig. This probe does *not* retry the request three
       times before it is considered "lost", like dig and other resolver do by default. If operating as caching
       Nameserver, BIND (and maybe others) expect clients to retry the request if the answer is not in the
       cache. So, ask the nameserver for something that he is authoritative for if you want measure the network
       packet loss correctly.

       If you have a really fast network and nameserver, you will notice that this probe reports the query time
       in microsecond resolution. :-)

</pre><h4><b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       Supported probe-specific variables:

       forks
           Run this many concurrent processes at maximum

           Example value: 5

           Default value: 5

       offset
           If you run many probes concurrently you may want to prevent them from hitting your network all at the
           same time. Using the probe-specific offset parameter you can change the point in time when each probe
           will be run. Offset is specified in % of total interval, or alternatively as 'random', and the offset
           from  the  'General'  section is used if nothing is specified here. Note that this does NOT influence
           the rrds itself, it is just a matter of when data acquisition is initiated.  (This variable  is  only
           applicable if the variable 'concurrentprobes' is set in the 'General' section.)

           Example value: 50%

       step
           Duration  of the base interval that this probe should use, if different from the one specified in the
           'Database' section. Note that the step in the RRD files is fixed when they are originally  generated,
           and  if  you change the step parameter afterwards, you'll have to delete the old RRD files or somehow
           convert them. (This variable is only applicable if the variable  'concurrentprobes'  is  set  in  the
           'General' section.)

           Example value: 300

       Supported target-specific variables:

       /^influx_.+/
           This  is a tag that will be sent to influxdb and has no impact on the probe measurement. The tag name
           will be sent without the "influx_" prefix, which will be replaced with "tag_" instead.  Tags  can  be
           used for filtering.

           Example value: influx_location = In the basement

       authoritative
           Send non-recursive queries and require authoritative answers.

           Default value: 0

       expect_text
           A  string  that  should  be  present  in  the DNS answer. This can be used to verify that an A record
           contains the expected IP address, a PTR record reflects the expected  hostname,  etc.  If  the  query
           returns multiple records, any single match will pass the test.

           Example value: 192.168.50.60

       ipversion
           The  IP  protocol  used.  Possible values are "4" and "6".  Passed to <b><a href="../man1/echoping.1.html">echoping</a></b>(1) as the "-4" or "-6"
           options.

           Example value: 4

           Default value: 4

       lookup
           Name of the host to look up in the dns.

           Example value: www.example.org

       mininterval
           Minimum time between sending two lookup queries in (possibly fractional) seconds.

           Default value: 0.5

       pings
           How many pings should be sent to each target, if different from the global  value  specified  in  the
           Database  section.  Note  that the number of pings in the RRD files is fixed when they are originally
           generated, and if you change this parameter afterwards, you'll have to delete the old  RRD  files  or
           somehow convert them.

           Example value: 5

       port
           The UDP Port to use.

           Default value: 53

       protocol
           The Network Protocol to use.

           Default value: udp

       recordtype
           Record type to look up.

           Default value: A

       require_answers
           Only Count Answers with answer count &gt;= this value.

           Default value: 0

       require_noerror
           Only Count Answers with Response Status NOERROR.

           Default value: 0

       require_nxdomain
           Set  to  1  if NXDOMAIN should be interpreted as success instead of failure. This reverses the normal
           behavior of the probe. Example uses include testing a DNS firewall, verifying that a mail  server  IP
           is not listed on a DNSBL, or other scenarios where NXDOMAIN is desired.

           Example value: 0

           Default value: 0

       timeout
           Timeout for a single request in seconds.

           Default value: 5
