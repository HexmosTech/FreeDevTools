</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Uses the DISMAN-PING-MIB to cause a remote system to send probes.

</pre><h4><b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       Supported probe-specific variables:

       offset
           If you run many probes concurrently you may want to prevent them from hitting your network all at the
           same time. Using the probe-specific offset parameter you can change the point in time when each probe
           will be run. Offset is specified in % of total interval, or alternatively as 'random', and the offset
           from  the  'General'  section is used if nothing is specified here. Note that this does NOT influence
           the rrds itself, it is just a matter of when data acquisition is initiated.  (This variable  is  only
           applicable if the variable 'concurrentprobes' is set in the 'General' section.)

           Example value: 50%

       pings
           How  many  pings should be sent to each target. Note that the maximum value for DismanPing MIP is 15,
           which is less than the SmokePing default, so this class has its own default value.  If your  Database
           section specifies a value less than 15, you must also set it for this probe.  Note that the number of
           pings  in the RRD files is fixed when they are originally generated, and if you change this parameter
           afterwards, you'll have to delete the old RRD files or somehow convert them.

           Example value: 15

           Default value: 15

       step
           Duration of the base interval that this probe should use, if different from the one specified in  the
           'Database'  section. Note that the step in the RRD files is fixed when they are originally generated,
           and if you change the step parameter afterwards, you'll have to delete the old RRD files  or  somehow
           convert  them.  (This  variable  is  only applicable if the variable 'concurrentprobes' is set in the
           'General' section.)

           Example value: 300

       Supported target-specific variables:

       /^influx_.+/
           This is a tag that will be sent to influxdb and has no impact on the probe measurement. The tag  name
           will  be  sent  without the "influx_" prefix, which will be replaced with "tag_" instead. Tags can be
           used for filtering.

           Example value: influx_location = In the basement

       ownerindex
           The SNMP OwnerIndex to use when setting up the test.  When using VACM, can map to a Security Name  or
           Group Name of the entity running the test.

           By default this will be set to

           Example value: smokeping

       packetsize
           The packetsize parameter lets you configure the packet size for the pings sent. The minimum is 8, the
           maximum  65507. Use the same number as with fping if you want the same packet sizes being used on the
           network.

           Default value: 56

       pinghost
           The (mandatory) pinghost parameter specifies the remote system which will execute the pings, as  well
           as the SNMP community string on the device.

           Example value: <a href="mailto:pinger@router.example.com">pinger@router.example.com</a>

           This setting is mandatory.

       pingsrc
           The  (optional)  pingsrc  parameter specifies the source address to be used for pings.  If specified,
           this parameter must identify an IP address assigned to pinghost.

           Example value: 192.0.2.9

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>MENU</b> <b>NAMES</b>
       This probe uses the menu name of a test as part of the unique index.  If the menu name is longer than  32
       characters,  the  last  32  characters  are used for the index.  Collisions are *<b>not</b>* detected and simply
       cause one test's results to be used for all colliding names.

   <b>CONFIGURATION</b>
       This probe requires read/write access to the pingCtlTable.  It also  requires  read-only  access  to  the
       pingResultsTable and the pingHistoryTable.  The DISMAN-PING-MIB is structured such that it is possible to
       restrict  by pingCtlOwnerIndex.  This probe uses a pingCtlOwnerIndex of "SP on hostname" as ownerindex by
       default; use <b>ownerindex</b> to configure this if needed.

   <b>SAMPLE</b> <b>JUNOS</b> <b>CONFIGURATION</b>
       This configuration permits the community "pinger" read-write access to the full DISMAN-PING-MIB, but only
       when sourced from the manager at <b>192.0.2.134</b>.

           snmp {
               view pingMIB {
                   oid .1.3.6.1.2.1.80 include;
               }
               community pinger {
                   view pingMIB;
                   authorization read-write;
                   clients {
                       192.0.2.134/32;
                   }
               }
           }

   <b>SAMPLE</b> <b>CONFIGURATIONS</b> <b>NOTE</b>
       This configuration  allows  the  "pinger"  community  full  access  to  the  DISMAN-PING-MIB.   There  is
       information  in  the  description of <b>pingCtlOwnerIndex</b> in RFC 4560 (&lt;<a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4560">http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4560</a>&gt;)
       about using the vacmViewTreeFamilyTable to further restrict  access.   The  author  has  not  tried  this
       method.
