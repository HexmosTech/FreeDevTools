</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Smokeping::probes::passwordchecker - A Base Class for implementing SmokePing Probes

</pre><h4><b>OVERVIEW</b></h4><pre>
       Like Smokeping::probes::basefork, but supports a probe-specific configuration file for storing passwords
       and a method for accessing them.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        *** Probes ***

        +passwordchecker

        forks = 5
        offset = 50%
        passwordfile = /some/place/secret
        step = 300
        timeout = 15

        # The following variables can be overridden in each target section
        /^influx_.+/ = influx_location = In the basement
        pings = 5

        # [...]

        *** Targets ***

        probe = passwordchecker # if this should be the default probe

        # [...]

        + mytarget
        # probe = passwordchecker # if the default probe is something else
        host = my.host
        /^influx_.+/ = influx_location = In the basement
        pings = 5

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
   <b>synopsis</b> <b>with</b> <b>more</b> <b>detail</b>
       SmokePing main configuration file:

        *** Probes ***
        + MyPasswordChecker
        # location of the file containing usernames and passwords
        passwordfile = /usr/share/smokeping/etc/passwords

       The specified password file:

        # host:username:password
        host1:joe:hardlyasecret
         # comments and whitespace lines are allowed

        host2:sue:notasecreteither

   <b>Actual</b> <b>description</b>
       In implementing authentication probes, it might not be desirable to store the necessary cleartext
       passwords in the SmokePing main configuration file, since the latter must be readable both by the
       SmokePing daemon performing the probes and the CGI that displays the results. If the passwords are stored
       in a different file, this file can be made readable by only the user the daemon runs as. This way we can
       be sure that nobody can trick the CGI into displaying the passwords on the Web.

       This module reads the passwords in at startup from the file specified in the probe-specific variable
       `passwordfile'. The passwords can later be accessed and modified by the <b>password</b> method, that needs the
       corresponding host and username as arguments.

   <b>Password</b> <b>file</b> <b>format</b>
       The password file format is simply one line for each triplet of host, username and password, separated
       from each other by colons (:).

       Comment lines, starting with the `#' sign, are ignored, as well as empty lines.

</pre><h4><b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       Supported probe-specific variables:

       forks
           Run this many concurrent processes at maximum

           Example value: 5

           Default value: 5

       offset
           If you run many probes concurrently you may want to prevent them from hitting your network all at the
           same time. Using the probe-specific offset parameter you can change the point in time when each probe
           will be run. Offset is specified in % of total interval, or alternatively as 'random', and the offset
           from  the  'General'  section is used if nothing is specified here. Note that this does NOT influence
           the rrds itself, it is just a matter of when data acquisition is initiated.  (This variable  is  only
           applicable if the variable 'concurrentprobes' is set in the 'General' section.)

           Example value: 50%

       passwordfile
           Location of the file containing usernames and passwords.

           Example value: /some/place/secret

       step
           Duration  of the base interval that this probe should use, if different from the one specified in the
           'Database' section. Note that the step in the RRD files is fixed when they are originally  generated,
           and  if  you change the step parameter afterwards, you'll have to delete the old RRD files or somehow
           convert them. (This variable is only applicable if the variable  'concurrentprobes'  is  set  in  the
           'General' section.)

           Example value: 300

       timeout
           How long a single 'ping' takes at maximum

           Example value: 15

           Default value: 5

       Supported target-specific variables:

       /^influx_.+/
           This  is a tag that will be sent to influxdb and has no impact on the probe measurement. The tag name
           will be sent without the "influx_" prefix, which will be replaced with "tag_" instead.  Tags  can  be
           used for filtering.

           Example value: influx_location = In the basement

       pings
           How  many  pings  should  be sent to each target, if different from the global value specified in the
           Database section. Note that the number of pings in the RRD files is fixed when  they  are  originally
           generated,  and  if  you change this parameter afterwards, you'll have to delete the old RRD files or
           somehow convert them.

           Example value: 5

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       The need for storing cleartext passwords can be considered a bug in itself.
