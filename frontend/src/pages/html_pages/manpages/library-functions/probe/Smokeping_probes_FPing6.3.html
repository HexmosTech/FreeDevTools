       Smokeping::probes::FPing6 - FPing6 Probe for SmokePing

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        *** Probes ***

        +FPing6

        binary = /usr/bin/fping6 # mandatory
        blazemode = true
        hostinterval = 1.5
        interface = eth0
        mininterval = 0.001
        offset = 50%
        packetsize = 5000
        pings = 20
        protocol = 6
        sourceaddress = ::1
        step = 300
        timeout = 1.5
        tos = 0x20
        usestdout = true

        # The following variables can be overridden in each target section
        /^influx_.+/ = influx_location = In the basement

        # [...]

        *** Targets ***

        probe = FPing6 # if this should be the default probe

        # [...]

        + mytarget
        # probe = FPing6 # if the default probe is something else
        host = my.host
        /^influx_.+/ = influx_location = In the basement

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Integrates FPing6 as a probe into smokeping. This probe is derived from FPing; the only difference is
       that the target host used for checking the fping command output is ::1 instead of localhost.

</pre><h4><b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       Supported probe-specific variables:

       binary
           The location of your fping binary.

           Example value: /usr/bin/fping6

           This setting is mandatory.

       blazemode
           Send an extra ping and then discard the first answer since the first is bound to be an outlier.

           Example value: true

       hostinterval
           The  fping  "-p"  parameter,  but  in  (possibly  fractional)  seconds  rather than milliseconds, for
           consistency with other Smokeping probes. From <b><a href="../man1/fping.1.html">fping</a></b>(1):

           This parameter sets the time that fping  waits between successive packets to an individual target.

           Example value: 1.5

       interface
           The name of the network interface to perform the ping on.

           Example value: eth0

       mininterval
           The fping "-i" parameter,  but  in  (probably  fractional)  seconds  rather  than  milliseconds,  for
           consistency with other Smokeping probes. From <b><a href="../man1/fping.1.html">fping</a></b>(1):

           The minimum amount of time between sending a ping packet to any target.

           Example value: 0.001

           Default value: 0.01

       offset
           If you run many probes concurrently you may want to prevent them from hitting your network all at the
           same time. Using the probe-specific offset parameter you can change the point in time when each probe
           will be run. Offset is specified in % of total interval, or alternatively as 'random', and the offset
           from  the  'General'  section is used if nothing is specified here. Note that this does NOT influence
           the rrds itself, it is just a matter of when data acquisition is initiated.  (This variable  is  only
           applicable if the variable 'concurrentprobes' is set in the 'General' section.)

           Example value: 50%

       packetsize
           The ping packet size (in the range of 12-64000 bytes).

           Example value: 5000

       pings
           How  many  pings  should  be sent to each target, if different from the global value specified in the
           Database section. Note that the number of pings in the RRD files is fixed when  they  are  originally
           generated,  and  if  you change this parameter afterwards, you'll have to delete the old RRD files or
           somehow convert them.

           Example value: 20

       protocol
           Choose if the ping should use IPv4 or IPv6.

           Example value: 6

           Default value: 6

       sourceaddress
           The fping "-S" parameter . From <b><a href="../man1/fping.1.html">fping</a></b>(1):

           Set source address.

           Example value: ::1

       step
           Duration of the base interval that this probe should use, if different from the one specified in  the
           'Database'  section. Note that the step in the RRD files is fixed when they are originally generated,
           and if you change the step parameter afterwards, you'll have to delete the old RRD files  or  somehow
           convert  them.  (This  variable  is  only applicable if the variable 'concurrentprobes' is set in the
           'General' section.)

           Example value: 300

       timeout
           The fping "-t" parameter,  but  in  (possibly  fractional)  seconds  rather  than  milliseconds,  for
           consistency  with other Smokeping probes. Note that as Smokeping uses the fping 'counting' mode (-C),
           this apparently only affects the last ping.

           Example value: 1.5

       tos Set the type of service (TOS) of outgoing ICMP packets.  You need at laeast fping-2.4b2_to3-ipv6  for
           this to work. Find a copy on www.smokeping.org/pub.

           Example value: 0x20

       usestdout
           Listen  for  FPing  output  on  stdout  instead  of  stderr ... (version 3.3+ sends its statistics on
           stdout).

           Example value: true
