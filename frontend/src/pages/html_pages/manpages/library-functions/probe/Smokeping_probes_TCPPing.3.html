</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Integrates TCPPing as a probe into smokeping. The variable <b>binary</b> must point to your copy of the TCPPing
       program. If it is not installed on your system yet, you can get it from
       https://github.com/deajan/tcpping.

       The (optional) port option lets you configure the port for the pings sent.  The TCPPing manpage has the
       following to say on this topic:

       The problem is that with the widespread use of firewalls on the modern Internet, many of the packets that
       <b><a href="../man8/traceroute.8.html">traceroute</a></b>(8) sends out end up being filtered, making it impossible to completely trace the path to the
       destination.  However, in many cases, these firewalls will permit inbound TCP packets to specific ports
       that hosts sitting behind the firewall are listening for connections on.  By sending out TCP SYN packets
       instead of UDP or ICMP ECHO packets, tcptraceroute is able to bypass the most common firewall filters.

       It is worth noting that tcptraceroute never completely establishes a TCP connection with the destination
       host. If the host is not listening for incoming connections, it will respond with an RST indicating that
       the port is closed. If the host instead responds with a SYN|ACK, the port is known to be open, and an RST
       is sent by the kernel tcptraceroute is running on to tear down the connection without completing three-
       way handshake. This is the same half-open scanning technique that <b><a href="../man1/nmap.1.html">nmap</a></b>(1) uses when passed the -sS flag.

</pre><h4><b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       Supported probe-specific variables:

       binary
           The location of your tcpping script.

           Example value: /usr/bin/tcpping

           This setting is mandatory.

       forks
           Run this many concurrent processes at maximum

           Example value: 5

           Default value: 5

       offset
           If you run many probes concurrently you may want to prevent them from hitting your network all at the
           same time. Using the probe-specific offset parameter you can change the point in time when each probe
           will be run. Offset is specified in % of total interval, or alternatively as 'random', and the offset
           from  the  'General'  section is used if nothing is specified here. Note that this does NOT influence
           the rrds itself, it is just a matter of when data acquisition is initiated.  (This variable  is  only
           applicable if the variable 'concurrentprobes' is set in the 'General' section.)

           Example value: 50%

       step
           Duration  of the base interval that this probe should use, if different from the one specified in the
           'Database' section. Note that the step in the RRD files is fixed when they are originally  generated,
           and  if  you change the step parameter afterwards, you'll have to delete the old RRD files or somehow
           convert them. (This variable is only applicable if the variable  'concurrentprobes'  is  set  in  the
           'General' section.)

           Example value: 300

       timeout
           How long a single 'ping' takes at maximum

           Example value: 15

           Default value: 5

       Supported target-specific variables:

       /^influx_.+/
           This  is a tag that will be sent to influxdb and has no impact on the probe measurement. The tag name
           will be sent without the "influx_" prefix, which will be replaced with "tag_" instead.  Tags  can  be
           used for filtering.

           Example value: influx_location = In the basement

       pings
           How  many  pings  should  be sent to each target, if different from the global value specified in the
           Database section. Note that the number of pings in the RRD files is fixed when  they  are  originally
           generated,  and  if  you change this parameter afterwards, you'll have to delete the old RRD files or
           somehow convert them.

           Example value: 5

       port
           The TCP port the probe should measure.

           Example value: 80
