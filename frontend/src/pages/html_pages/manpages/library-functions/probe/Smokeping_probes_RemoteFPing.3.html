</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Integrates the remote execution of FPing via ssh/rsh into smokeping.  The variable <b>binary</b> must point to
       your copy of the ssh/rsh program.  The variable <b>rbinary</b> must point to your copy of the fping program at
       the remote end.

</pre><h4><b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       Supported probe-specific variables:

       binary
           This  variable  specifies the path of the remote shell program (usually ssh, rsh or remsh). Any other
           script or binary that can be called as

           binary [ -l ruser ] [ -p rport ] rhost rbinary

           may be used.

           Example value: <a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?ssh">/usr/bin/ssh</a>

           This setting is mandatory.

       blazemode
           Send an extra ping and then discard the first answer since the first is bound to be an outlier.

           Example value: true

       hostinterval
           The fping "-p" parameter,  but  in  (possibly  fractional)  seconds  rather  than  milliseconds,  for
           consistency with other Smokeping probes. From <b><a href="../man1/fping.1.html">fping</a></b>(1):

           This parameter sets the time that fping  waits between successive packets to an individual target.

           Example value: 1.5

       interface
           The name of the network interface to perform the ping on.

           Example value: eth0

       mininterval
           The  fping  "-i"  parameter,  but  in  (probably  fractional)  seconds  rather than milliseconds, for
           consistency with other Smokeping probes. From <b><a href="../man1/fping.1.html">fping</a></b>(1):

           The minimum amount of time between sending a ping packet to any target.

           Example value: 0.001

           Default value: 0.01

       offset
           If you run many probes concurrently you may want to prevent them from hitting your network all at the
           same time. Using the probe-specific offset parameter you can change the point in time when each probe
           will be run. Offset is specified in % of total interval, or alternatively as 'random', and the offset
           from the 'General' section is used if nothing is specified here. Note that this  does  NOT  influence
           the  rrds  itself, it is just a matter of when data acquisition is initiated.  (This variable is only
           applicable if the variable 'concurrentprobes' is set in the 'General' section.)

           Example value: 50%

       packetsize
           The ping packet size (in the range of 12-64000 bytes).

           Example value: 5000

       pings
           How many pings should be sent to each target, if different from the global  value  specified  in  the
           Database  section.  Note  that the number of pings in the RRD files is fixed when they are originally
           generated, and if you change this parameter afterwards, you'll have to delete the old  RRD  files  or
           somehow convert them.

           Example value: 20

       protocol
           Choose if the ping should use IPv4 or IPv6.

           Example value: 4

       rbinary
           The location of your fping binary.

           Example value: /usr/bin/fping

           This setting is mandatory.

       rhost
           The <b>rhost</b> option specifies the remote device from where fping will be launched.

           Example value: my.pinger.host

           This setting is mandatory.

       rport
           The (optional) <b>rport</b> option allows you to specify the port of the remote host.

           Example value: 22

       ruser
           The  (optional) <b>ruser</b> option allows you to specify the remote user, if different from the one running
           the smokeping daemon.

           Example value: foo

       sourceaddress
           The fping "-S" parameter . From <b><a href="../man1/fping.1.html">fping</a></b>(1):

           Set source address.

           Example value: 192.168.0.1

       step
           Duration of the base interval that this probe should use, if different from the one specified in  the
           'Database'  section. Note that the step in the RRD files is fixed when they are originally generated,
           and if you change the step parameter afterwards, you'll have to delete the old RRD files  or  somehow
           convert  them.  (This  variable  is  only applicable if the variable 'concurrentprobes' is set in the
           'General' section.)

           Example value: 300

       timeout
           The fping "-t" parameter,  but  in  (possibly  fractional)  seconds  rather  than  milliseconds,  for
           consistency  with other Smokeping probes. Note that as Smokeping uses the fping 'counting' mode (-C),
           this apparently only affects the last ping.

           Example value: 1.5

       tos Set the type of service (TOS) of outgoing ICMP packets.  You need at laeast fping-2.4b2_to3-ipv6  for
           this to work. Find a copy on www.smokeping.org/pub.

           Example value: 0x20

       usestdout
           Listen  for  FPing  output  on  stdout  instead  of  stderr ... (version 3.3+ sends its statistics on
           stdout).

           Example value: true

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       It is important to make sure that you can access the remote machine without a password prompt,  otherwise
       this probe will not work properly.  To test just try something like this:

           $ ssh <a href="mailto:foo@HostA.foobar.com">foo@HostA.foobar.com</a> fping HostB.barfoo.com

       The next thing you see must be fping's output.

       The  <b>rhost</b>,  <b>ruser</b>, <b>rport</b> and <b>rbinary</b> variables used to be configured in the Targets section of the first
       target or its parents They were moved to the Probes section, because the variables aren't really  target-
       specific  (all the targets are measured with the same parameters). The Targets sections aren't recognized
       anymore.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       This functionality should be in a generic 'remote execution' module so that it  could  be  used  for  the
       other probes too.
