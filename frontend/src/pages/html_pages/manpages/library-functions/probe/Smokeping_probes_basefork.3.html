       Smokeping::probes::basefork - Yet Another Base Class for implementing SmokePing Probes

</pre><h4><b>OVERVIEW</b></h4><pre>
       Like Smokeping::probes::basevars, but supports the probe-specific property `forks' to determine how many
       processes should be run concurrently. The targets are pinged one at a time, and the number of pings sent
       can vary between targets.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        *** Probes ***

        +basefork

        forks = 5
        offset = 50%
        step = 300
        timeout = 15

        # The following variables can be overridden in each target section
        /^influx_.+/ = influx_location = In the basement
        pings = 5

        # [...]

        *** Targets ***

        probe = basefork # if this should be the default probe

        # [...]

        + mytarget
        # probe = basefork # if the default probe is something else
        host = my.host
        /^influx_.+/ = influx_location = In the basement
        pings = 5

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Not all pinger programs support testing multiple hosts in a single go like <b><a href="../man1/fping.1.html">fping</a></b>(1). If the measurement
       takes long enough, there may be not enough time perform all the tests in the time available. For example,
       if the test takes 30 seconds, measuring ten hosts already fills up the SmokePing default five minute
       step.

       Thus, it may be necessary to do some of the tests concurrently. This module defines the <b>ping</b> method that
       forks the requested number of concurrent processes and calls the <b>pingone</b> method that derived classes must
       provide.

       The <b>pingone</b> method is called with one argument: a hash containing the target that is to be measured. The
       contents of the hash are described in <u>Smokeping::probes::<a href="../man3pm/basevars.3pm.html">basevars</a></u>(3pm).

       The number of concurrent processes is determined by the probe-specific variable `forks' and is 5 by
       default. If there are more targets than this value, another round of forks is done after the first
       processes are finished. This continues until all the targets have been tested.

       The timeout in which each child has to finish is set to 5 seconds multiplied by the maximum number of
       'pings' of the targets. You can set the base timeout differently if you want to, using the timeout
       property of the probe in the master config file (this again will be multiplied by the maximum number of
       pings). The probe itself can also provide another default value if desired by modifying the _default
       value of the timeout variable.

       If the child isn't finished when the timeout occurs, it will be killed along with any processes it has
       started.

       The number of pings sent can be specified in the target-specific variable 'pings'.

</pre><h4><b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       Supported probe-specific variables:

       forks
           Run this many concurrent processes at maximum

           Example value: 5

           Default value: 5

       offset
           If you run many probes concurrently you may want to prevent them from hitting your network all at the
           same time. Using the probe-specific offset parameter you can change the point in time when each probe
           will be run. Offset is specified in % of total interval, or alternatively as 'random', and the offset
           from  the  'General'  section is used if nothing is specified here. Note that this does NOT influence
           the rrds itself, it is just a matter of when data acquisition is initiated.  (This variable  is  only
           applicable if the variable 'concurrentprobes' is set in the 'General' section.)

           Example value: 50%

       step
           Duration  of the base interval that this probe should use, if different from the one specified in the
           'Database' section. Note that the step in the RRD files is fixed when they are originally  generated,
           and  if  you change the step parameter afterwards, you'll have to delete the old RRD files or somehow
           convert them. (This variable is only applicable if the variable  'concurrentprobes'  is  set  in  the
           'General' section.)

           Example value: 300

       timeout
           How long a single 'ping' takes at maximum

           Example value: 15

           Default value: 5

       Supported target-specific variables:

       /^influx_.+/
           This  is a tag that will be sent to influxdb and has no impact on the probe measurement. The tag name
           will be sent without the "influx_" prefix, which will be replaced with "tag_" instead.  Tags  can  be
           used for filtering.

           Example value: influx_location = In the basement

       pings
           How  many  pings  should  be sent to each target, if different from the global value specified in the
           Database section. Note that the number of pings in the RRD files is fixed when  they  are  originally
           generated,  and  if  you change this parameter afterwards, you'll have to delete the old RRD files or
           somehow convert them.

           Example value: 5
