</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Latency measurement using SSH. This generates Logfile messages on the other Host, so get permission from
       the owner first!

</pre><h4><b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       Supported probe-specific variables:

       forks
           Run this many concurrent processes at maximum

           Example value: 5

           Default value: 5

       offset
           If you run many probes concurrently you may want to prevent them from hitting your network all at the
           same time. Using the probe-specific offset parameter you can change the point in time when each probe
           will be run. Offset is specified in % of total interval, or alternatively as 'random', and the offset
           from  the  'General'  section is used if nothing is specified here. Note that this does NOT influence
           the rrds itself, it is just a matter of when data acquisition is initiated.  (This variable  is  only
           applicable if the variable 'concurrentprobes' is set in the 'General' section.)

           Example value: 50%

       step
           Duration  of the base interval that this probe should use, if different from the one specified in the
           'Database' section. Note that the step in the RRD files is fixed when they are originally  generated,
           and  if  you change the step parameter afterwards, you'll have to delete the old RRD files or somehow
           convert them. (This variable is only applicable if the variable  'concurrentprobes'  is  set  in  the
           'General' section.)

           Example value: 300

       Supported target-specific variables:

       /^influx_.+/
           This  is a tag that will be sent to influxdb and has no impact on the probe measurement. The tag name
           will be sent without the "influx_" prefix, which will be replaced with "tag_" instead.  Tags  can  be
           used for filtering.

           Example value: influx_location = In the basement

       greeting
           Greeting  string to send to the SSH Server. This will appear in the Logfile.  Use this to make clear,
           who you are and what you are doing to avoid confusion.

           Also, don't use something that is a valid version string. This probe assumes that the connection gets
           terminated because of protocol mismatch.

           Default value: SSH-Latency-Measurement-Sorry-for-this-logmessage

       interval
           The interval to be measured. One of:

           connect
               Interval between <b>connect()</b> and the greeting string from the host.

           established
               Interval between our greeting message and the end of the connection because of Protocol mismatch.
               This is the default.

           complete
               From <b>connect()</b> to the end of the connection.

           Default value: established

       mininterval
           Minimum interval between the start of two connection attempts in (possibly fractional) seconds.

           Default value: 0.5

       pings
           How many pings should be sent to each target, if different from the global  value  specified  in  the
           Database  section.  Note  that the number of pings in the RRD files is fixed when they are originally
           generated, and if you change this parameter afterwards, you'll have to delete the old  RRD  files  or
           somehow convert them.

           Example value: 5

       port
           Connect to this port.

           Default value: 22

       timeout
           Timeout for the connection.

           Default value: 5
