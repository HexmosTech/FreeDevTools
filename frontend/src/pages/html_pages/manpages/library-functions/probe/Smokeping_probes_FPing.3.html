</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Integrates FPing as a probe into smokeping. The variable <b>binary</b> must point to your copy of the FPing
       program.  If it is not installed on your system yet, you can get a slightly enhanced version from "pub"
       in www.smokeping.org.

       The (optional) <b>packetsize</b> option lets you configure the packetsize for the pings sent.

       Since version 3.3 fping sends its statistics to stdout. Set <b>usestdout</b> to 'true' so make smokeping read
       stdout instead of stderr.

       In <b>blazemode</b>, FPing sends one more ping than requested, and discards the first RTT value returned as it's
       likely to be an outlier.

       The FPing manpage has the following to say on this topic:

       Number of bytes of ping data to send.  The minimum size (normally 12) allows room for the data that fping
       needs to do its work (sequence number, timestamp).  The reported received data size includes the IP
       header (normally 20 bytes) and ICMP header (8 bytes), so the minimum total size is 40 bytes.  Default is
       56, as in ping. Maximum is the theoretical maximum IP datagram size (64K), though most systems limit this
       to a smaller, system-dependent number.

</pre><h4><b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       Supported probe-specific variables:

       binary
           The location of your fping binary.

           Example value: /usr/bin/fping

           This setting is mandatory.

       blazemode
           Send an extra ping and then discard the first answer since the first is bound to be an outlier.

           Example value: true

       hostinterval
           The  fping  "-p"  parameter,  but  in  (possibly  fractional)  seconds  rather than milliseconds, for
           consistency with other Smokeping probes. From <b><a href="../man1/fping.1.html">fping</a></b>(1):

           This parameter sets the time that fping  waits between successive packets to an individual target.

           Example value: 1.5

       interface
           The name of the network interface to perform the ping on.

           Example value: eth0

       mininterval
           The fping "-i" parameter,  but  in  (probably  fractional)  seconds  rather  than  milliseconds,  for
           consistency with other Smokeping probes. From <b><a href="../man1/fping.1.html">fping</a></b>(1):

           The minimum amount of time between sending a ping packet to any target.

           Example value: 0.001

           Default value: 0.01

       offset
           If you run many probes concurrently you may want to prevent them from hitting your network all at the
           same time. Using the probe-specific offset parameter you can change the point in time when each probe
           will be run. Offset is specified in % of total interval, or alternatively as 'random', and the offset
           from  the  'General'  section is used if nothing is specified here. Note that this does NOT influence
           the rrds itself, it is just a matter of when data acquisition is initiated.  (This variable  is  only
           applicable if the variable 'concurrentprobes' is set in the 'General' section.)

           Example value: 50%

       packetsize
           The ping packet size (in the range of 12-64000 bytes).

           Example value: 5000

       pings
           How  many  pings  should  be sent to each target, if different from the global value specified in the
           Database section. Note that the number of pings in the RRD files is fixed when  they  are  originally
           generated,  and  if  you change this parameter afterwards, you'll have to delete the old RRD files or
           somehow convert them.

           Example value: 20

       protocol
           Choose if the ping should use IPv4 or IPv6.

           Example value: 4

       sourceaddress
           The fping "-S" parameter . From <b><a href="../man1/fping.1.html">fping</a></b>(1):

           Set source address.

           Example value: 192.168.0.1

       step
           Duration of the base interval that this probe should use, if different from the one specified in  the
           'Database'  section. Note that the step in the RRD files is fixed when they are originally generated,
           and if you change the step parameter afterwards, you'll have to delete the old RRD files  or  somehow
           convert  them.  (This  variable  is  only applicable if the variable 'concurrentprobes' is set in the
           'General' section.)

           Example value: 300

       timeout
           The fping "-t" parameter,  but  in  (possibly  fractional)  seconds  rather  than  milliseconds,  for
           consistency  with other Smokeping probes. Note that as Smokeping uses the fping 'counting' mode (-C),
           this apparently only affects the last ping.

           Example value: 1.5

       tos Set the type of service (TOS) of outgoing ICMP packets.  You need at laeast fping-2.4b2_to3-ipv6  for
           this to work. Find a copy on www.smokeping.org/pub.

           Example value: 0x20

       usestdout
           Listen  for  FPing  output  on  stdout  instead  of  stderr ... (version 3.3+ sends its statistics on
           stdout).

           Example value: true
