</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Connect to Juniper JunOS via OpenSSH to run ping commands.  This probe uses the "extended ping" of the
       Juniper JunOS.  You have the option to specify which interface the ping is sourced from as well.

</pre><h4><b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       Supported probe-specific variables:

       forks
           Run this many concurrent processes at maximum

           Example value: 5

           Default value: 5

       offset
           If you run many probes concurrently you may want to prevent them from hitting your network all at the
           same time. Using the probe-specific offset parameter you can change the point in time when each probe
           will be run. Offset is specified in % of total interval, or alternatively as 'random', and the offset
           from  the  'General'  section is used if nothing is specified here. Note that this does NOT influence
           the rrds itself, it is just a matter of when data acquisition is initiated.  (This variable  is  only
           applicable if the variable 'concurrentprobes' is set in the 'General' section.)

           Example value: 50%

       packetsize
           The (optional) packetsize option lets you configure the packetsize for the pings sent.

           Default value: 100

       step
           Duration  of the base interval that this probe should use, if different from the one specified in the
           'Database' section. Note that the step in the RRD files is fixed when they are originally  generated,
           and  if  you change the step parameter afterwards, you'll have to delete the old RRD files or somehow
           convert them. (This variable is only applicable if the variable  'concurrentprobes'  is  set  in  the
           'General' section.)

           Example value: 300

       timeout
           How long a single 'ping' takes at maximum

           Example value: 15

           Default value: 5

       tos The (optional) type of service for the pings sent.

       Supported target-specific variables:

       /^influx_.+/
           This  is a tag that will be sent to influxdb and has no impact on the probe measurement. The tag name
           will be sent without the "influx_" prefix, which will be replaced with "tag_" instead.  Tags  can  be
           used for filtering.

           Example value: influx_location = In the basement

       junospass
           The  junospass  option  allows you to specify the password for the username specified with the option
           junosuser.

           Example value: password

           This setting is mandatory.

       junosuser
           The junosuser option allows you to specify a username that has ping capability on the JunOS Device.

           Example value: user

           This setting is mandatory.

       pings
           How many pings should be sent to each target, if different from the global  value  specified  in  the
           Database  section.  Note  that the number of pings in the RRD files is fixed when they are originally
           generated, and if you change this parameter afterwards, you'll have to delete the old  RRD  files  or
           somehow convert them.

           Example value: 5

       psource
           The  (optional)  psource option specifies an alternate IP address or Interface from which you wish to
           source your pings from.  Routers can have many many IP addresses, and interfaces.  When you ping from
           a router you have the ability to choose which interface and/or which IP address the ping  is  sourced
           from.  Specifying an IP/interface does not necessarily specify the interface from which the ping will
           leave,  but will specify which address the packet(s) appear to come from.  If this option is left out
           the JunOS Device will source the packet automatically based  on  routing  and/or  metrics.   If  this
           doesn't make sense to you then just leave it out.

           Example value: 192.168.2.129

       source
           The  source  option  specifies the JunOS device that is going to run the ping commands.  This address
           will be used for the ssh connection.

           Example value: 192.168.2.1

           This setting is mandatory.

       based on Smokeping::probes::TelnetJunOSPing by S H A N &lt;<a href="mailto:shanali@yahoo.com">shanali@yahoo.com</a>&gt;.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>JunOS</b> <b>configuration</b>
       The JunOS device should have a username/password configured, as well as the ability  to  connect  to  the
       VTY(s).

       Make  sure to connect to the remote host once from the command line as the user who is running smokeping.
       On the first connect ssh will ask to add the new host to its  known_hosts  file.  This  will  not  happen
       automatically  so  the  script  will  fail  to  login  until  the  ssh  key of your juniper box is in the
       known_hosts file.

       Some JunOS devices have a maximum of 5 VTYs available, so be careful not to hit a limit with the  'forks'
       variable.

   <b>Requirements</b>
       This module requires the  Net::OpenSSH and IO::Pty.
