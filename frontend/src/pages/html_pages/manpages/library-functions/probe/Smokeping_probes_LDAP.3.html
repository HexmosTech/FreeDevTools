</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This probe measures LDAP query latency for SmokePing.  The query is specified by the target-specific
       variable `filter' and, optionally, by the target-specific variable `base'. The attributes queried can be
       specified in the comma-separated list `attrs'.

       The TCP port of the LDAP server and the LDAP version to be used can be specified by the variables `port'
       and `version'.

       The probe can issue the starttls command to convert the connection into encrypted mode, if so instructed
       by the `start_tls' variable.  This requires the 'IO::Socket::SSL' perl module to be installed.

       The probe can also optionally do an authenticated LDAP bind, if the `binddn' variable is present. The
       password to be used can be specified by the target-specific variable `password' or in an external file.
       The location of this file is given in the probe-specific variable `passwordfile'. See
       <b>Smokeping::probes::<a href="../man3pm/passwordchecker.3pm.html">passwordchecker</a></b>(3pm) for the format of this file (summary: colon-separated triplets of
       the form `&lt;host&gt;:&lt;bind-dn&gt;:&lt;password&gt;')

       The probe tries to be nice to the server and does not send authentication requests more frequently than
       once every X seconds, where X is the value of the target-specific "min_interval" variable (1 by default).

</pre><h4><b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       Supported probe-specific variables:

       forks
           Run this many concurrent processes at maximum

           Example value: 5

           Default value: 5

       offset
           If you run many probes concurrently you may want to prevent them from hitting your network all at the
           same time. Using the probe-specific offset parameter you can change the point in time when each probe
           will be run. Offset is specified in % of total interval, or alternatively as 'random', and the offset
           from  the  'General'  section is used if nothing is specified here. Note that this does NOT influence
           the rrds itself, it is just a matter of when data acquisition is initiated.  (This variable  is  only
           applicable if the variable 'concurrentprobes' is set in the 'General' section.)

           Example value: 50%

       passwordfile
           Location of the file containing usernames and passwords.

           Example value: /some/place/secret

       step
           Duration  of the base interval that this probe should use, if different from the one specified in the
           'Database' section. Note that the step in the RRD files is fixed when they are originally  generated,
           and  if  you change the step parameter afterwards, you'll have to delete the old RRD files or somehow
           convert them. (This variable is only applicable if the variable  'concurrentprobes'  is  set  in  the
           'General' section.)

           Example value: 300

       Supported target-specific variables:

       /^influx_.+/
           This  is a tag that will be sent to influxdb and has no impact on the probe measurement. The tag name
           will be sent without the "influx_" prefix, which will be replaced with "tag_" instead.  Tags  can  be
           used for filtering.

           Example value: influx_location = In the basement

       attrs
           The attributes queried.

           Example value: uid,someotherattr

       base
           The base to be used in the LDAP query

           Example value: dc=foo,dc=bar

       binddn
           If present, authenticate the LDAP bind with this DN.

           Example value: uid=testuser,dc=foo,dc=bar

       filter
           The actual search to be made

           Example value: uid=testuser

           This setting is mandatory.

       mininterval
           The minimum interval between each query sent, in (possibly fractional) second s.

           Default value: 1

       password
           The password to be used, if not present in &lt;passwordfile&gt;.

           Example value: mypass

       pings
           How  many  pings  should  be sent to each target, if different from the global value specified in the
           Database section. Note that the number of pings in the RRD files is fixed when  they  are  originally
           generated,  and  if  you change this parameter afterwards, you'll have to delete the old RRD files or
           somehow convert them.

           Example value: 5

       port
           TCP port of the LDAP server

           Example value: 389

       scheme
           LDAP scheme to use: ldap, ldaps or ldapi

           Example value: ldap

           Default value: ldap

       scope
           The scope of the query. Can be either 'base', 'one' or 'sub'. See  the  Net::LDAP  documentation  for
           details.

           Example value: one

           Default value: sub

       start_tls
           If true, encrypt the connection with the starttls command. Disabled by default.

           Example value: 1

       timeout
           LDAP query timeout in seconds.

           Example value: 10

           Default value: 5

       verify
           The  TLS  verification  level.  Can  be  either  'none',  'optional',  'require'.  See the Net::LDAPS
           documentation for details.

           Example value: optional

           Default value: require

       version
           The LDAP version to be used.

           Example value: 3

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       There should be a way of specifying TLS options, such as the certificates involved etc.

       The probe has an ugly way of working  around  the  fact  that  the  IO::Socket::SSL  class  complains  if
       <b>start_tls()</b> is done more than once in the same program. But It Works For Me (tm).
