</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       A probe for smokeping, which uses the ciscoRttMon MIB functionality ("Service Assurance Agent", "SAA") of
       Cisco IOS to time ( recursive, type A) DNS queries to a DNS server.

</pre><h4><b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       Supported probe-specific variables:

       forks
           Run this many concurrent processes at maximum

           Example value: 5

           Default value: 5

       offset
           If you run many probes concurrently you may want to prevent them from hitting your network all at the
           same time. Using the probe-specific offset parameter you can change the point in time when each probe
           will be run. Offset is specified in % of total interval, or alternatively as 'random', and the offset
           from  the  'General'  section is used if nothing is specified here. Note that this does NOT influence
           the rrds itself, it is just a matter of when data acquisition is initiated.  (This variable  is  only
           applicable if the variable 'concurrentprobes' is set in the 'General' section.)

           Example value: 50%

       step
           Duration  of the base interval that this probe should use, if different from the one specified in the
           'Database' section. Note that the step in the RRD files is fixed when they are originally  generated,
           and  if  you change the step parameter afterwards, you'll have to delete the old RRD files or somehow
           convert them. (This variable is only applicable if the variable  'concurrentprobes'  is  set  in  the
           'General' section.)

           Example value: 300

       timeout
           How long a single 'ping' takes at maximum

           Example value: 15

           Default value: 5

       Supported target-specific variables:

       /^influx_.+/
           This  is a tag that will be sent to influxdb and has no impact on the probe measurement. The tag name
           will be sent without the "influx_" prefix, which will be replaced with "tag_" instead.  Tags  can  be
           used for filtering.

           Example value: influx_location = In the basement

       ioshost
           The  (mandatory)  ioshost  parameter specifies the Cisco router, which will send the DNS requests, as
           well as the SNMP community string on the router.

           Example value: <a href="mailto:RTTcommunity@Myrouter.foobar.com.au">RTTcommunity@Myrouter.foobar.com.au</a>

           This setting is mandatory.

       iosint
           The (optional) iosint parameter is the source address for the DNS packets.  This should be one of the
           active (!) IP addresses of the router to get results. IOS looks up the target  host  address  in  the
           forwarding  table and then uses the interface(s) listed there to send the DNS packets. By default IOS
           uses the (primary) IP address on the sending interface as source address for  packets  originated  by
           the router.

           Example value: 10.33.22.11

       name
           The (mandatory) name parameter is the DNS name to resolve.

           Example value: www.foobar.com.au

           This setting is mandatory.

       pings
           How  many  pings  should  be sent to each target, if different from the global value specified in the
           Database section. Note that the number of pings in the RRD files is fixed when  they  are  originally
           generated,  and  if  you change this parameter afterwards, you'll have to delete the old RRD files or
           somehow convert them.

           Example value: 5

       timeout
           How long a single RTTMonDNS 'ping' take at maximum plus 10 seconds to spare. Since we control our own
           timeout the only purpose of this is to not have us killed by the ping method from basefork.

           Example value: 15

           Default value: 15

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>host</b> <b>parameter</b>
       The host parameter specifies the DNS server, which the router will use.

   <b>IOS</b> <b>VERSIONS</b>
       This probe only works with IOS <a href="../man3/12.0.3.html">12.0</a>(3)T or higher.  It is recommended to test it on less critical routers
       first.

   <b>INSTALLATION</b>
       To   install   this   probe   copy   ciscoRttMonMIB.pm   to   ($SMOKEPINGINSTALLDIR)/lib/Smokeping    and
       CiscoRTTMonDNS.pm to ($SMOKEPINGINSTALLDIR)/lib/Smokeping/probes.

       The router(s) must be configured to allow read/write SNMP access. Sufficient is:

               snmp-server community RTTCommunity RW

       If  you want to be a bit more restrictive with SNMP write access to the router, then consider configuring
       something like this

               access-list 2 permit 10.37.3.5
               snmp-server view RttMon ciscoRttMonMIB included
               snmp-server community RTTCommunity view RttMon RW 2

       The above configuration grants SNMP read-write only to 10.37.3.5 (the smokeping host)  and  only  to  the
       ciscoRttMon MIB tree. The probe does not need access to SNMP variables outside the RttMon tree.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       The  probe  does  unnecessary DNS queries, i.e. more than configured in the "pings" variable, because the
       RTTMon MIB only allows to set a total time for all queries in one measurement run (one "life"). Currently
       the probe sets the life duration to "pings"*5+3 seconds (5 secs is the timeout value hardcoded into  this
       probe).
