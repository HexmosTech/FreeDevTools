           use Firefox::Marionette();
           use v5.10;

           my $profile = Firefox::Marionette::Profile-&gt;new();

               $firefox-&gt;quit();

               # OR start a new browser with a copy of a specific existing profile

               $profile = Firefox::Marionette::Profile-&gt;existing($profile_name);
               $firefox = Firefox::Marionette-&gt;new(profile =&gt; $profile);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module handles the implementation of a "prefs.js" Firefox Profile

</pre><h4><b>SUBROUTINES/METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>ANY_PORT</b>
       returns the port number for Firefox to listen on any port (0).

   <b>new</b>
       returns a new profile.

   <b>names</b>
       returns a list of existing profile names that this module can discover on the filesystem.

   <b>default_name</b>
       returns the default profile name.

   <b>directory</b>
       accepts a profile name and returns the directory path that contains the "prefs.js" file.

   <b>download_directory</b>
       accepts a directory path that will contain downloaded files.  Returns the previous value for download
       directory.

   <b>existing</b>
       accepts a profile name and returns a profile object for that specified profile name.

   <b>parse</b>
       accepts a path as the parameter.  This path should be to a "prefs.js" file.  Parses the file and returns
       it as a profile.

   <b>parse_by_handle</b>
       accepts a filehandle as the parameter to a "prefs.js" file.  Parses the file and returns it as a profile.

   <b>path</b>
       accepts a profile name and returns the corresponding path to the "prefs.js" file.

   <b>profile_ini_directory</b>
       returns the base directory for profiles.

   <b>save</b>
       accepts a path as the parameter.  Saves the current profile to this location.

   <b>as_string</b>
       returns the contents of current profile as a string.

   <b>get_value</b>
       accepts a key name (such as "browser.startup.homepage") and returns the value of the key from the
       profile.

   <b>set_value</b>
       accepts a key name (such as "browser.startup.homepage") and a value (such as "https://duckduckgo.com")
       and sets this value in the profile.  It returns itself to aid in chaining methods

   <b>clear_value</b>
       accepts a key name (such as "browser.startup.homepage") and removes the key from the profile.  It returns
       the old value of the key (if any).

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       "Failed to execute getpwuid for %s:%s"
           The  module was unable to to execute "getpwuid" in perlfunc.  This is probably a bug in this module's
           logic.  Please report as described in the BUGS AND LIMITATIONS section below.

       "Failed to open '%s' for writing:%s"
           The module was unable to open the named file.  Maybe your disk is full or the file  permissions  need
           to be changed?

       "Failed to write to '%s':%s"
           The module was unable to write to the named file.  Maybe your disk is full?

       "Failed to close '%s':%s"
           The  module  was  unable to close a handle to the named file.  Something is seriously wrong with your
           environment.

       "Failed to rename '%s' to '%s':%s"
           The module was unable to rename the named file to the second file.  Something is seriously wrong with
           your environment.

       "Failed to open '%s' for reading:%s"
           The module was unable to open the named file.  Maybe your disk is full or the file  permissions  need
           to be changed?

       "Failed to parse line '%s'"
           The module was unable to parse the line for a Firefox prefs.js configuration.  This is probably a bug
           in this module's logic.  Please report as described in the BUGS AND LIMITATIONS section below.
