</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Firefox::Marionette::Capabilities - Represents Firefox Capabilities retrieved using the Marionette
       protocol

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       Version 1.22

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Firefox::Marionette();
           use v5.10;

           my $firefox = Firefox::Marionette-&gt;new( capabilities =&gt; Firefox::Marionette::Capabilities-&gt;new( accept_insecure_certs =&gt; 0 ) );
           if ($firefox-&gt;capabilities-&gt;accept_insecure_certs()) {
               say "Browser will now ignore certificate failures";
           }

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module handles the implementation of Firefox Capabilities using the Marionette protocol

</pre><h4><b>SUBROUTINES/METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>accept_insecure_certs</b>
       indicates whether untrusted and self-signed TLS certificates are implicitly trusted on navigation for the
       duration of the session.

   <b>browser_name</b>
       returns the browsers name.  For example 'firefox'

   <b>browser_version</b>
       returns the version of firefox &lt;https://firefox.com/&gt;

   <b>enumerate</b>
       This method returns a list of strings describing the capabilities that this version of Firefox supports.

   <b>moz_accessibility_checks</b>
       returns the current accessibility (a11y) value

   <b>moz_build_id</b>
       returns the Firefox BuildId &lt;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/buildID&gt;

   <b>moz_headless</b>
       returns whether the browser is running in headless mode

   <b>moz_process_id</b>
       returns the process id belonging to the browser

   <b>moz_profile</b>
       returns the directory that contains the browsers profile

   <b>moz_shutdown_timeout</b>
       returns the value of moz:shutdownTimeout &lt;https://github.com/mozilla/gecko-
       dev/commit/7aad85995b21bdaf440dc9dad35c5769a35e90eb#diff-48053ba06cc33be0efb2d7256a1affd9&gt; (aka the value
       of config toolkit.asyncshutdown.crash_timeout)

   <b>moz_use_non_spec_compliant_pointer_origin</b>
       returns a boolean value to indicate how the pointer origin for an action command will be calculated.

       With Firefox 59 the calculation will be based on the requirements by the WebDriver specification. This
       means that the pointer origin is no longer computed based on the top and left position of the referenced
       element, but on the in-view center point.

       To temporarily disable the WebDriver conformant behavior use 0 as value for this capability.

       Please note that this capability exists only temporarily, and that it will be removed once all Selenium
       bindings can handle the new behavior.

   <b>moz_webdriver_click</b>
       returns a boolean value to indicate which kind of interactability checks to run when performing a click
       or sending keys to an elements. For Firefoxen prior to version 58.0 some legacy code as imported from an
       older version of FirefoxDriver was in use.

       With Firefox 58 the interactability checks as required by the WebDriver specification are enabled by
       default. This means geckodriver will additionally check if an element is obscured by another when
       clicking, and if an element is focusable for sending keys.

       Because of this change in behaviour, we are aware that some extra errors could be returned. In most cases
       the test in question might have to be updated so it's conform with the new checks. But if the problem is
       located in geckodriver, then please raise an issue in the issue tracker.

       To temporarily disable the WebDriver conformant checks use 0 as value for this capability.

       Please note that this capability exists only temporarily, and that it will be removed once the
       interactability checks have been stabilized.

   <b>new</b>
       accepts a hash as a parameter.  Allowed keys are below;

       •   accept_insecure_certs  -  Indicates whether untrusted and self-signed TLS certificates are implicitly
           trusted on navigation for the duration of the session. Allowed values are 1 or 0.  Default is 0.

       •   moz_accessibility_checks - run a11y checks when  clicking  elements.  Allowed  values  are  1  or  0.
           Default is 0.

       •   moz_headless  -  the  browser  should  be  started  with  the -headless option.  moz_headless is only
           supported in Firefox 56+

       •   moz_use_non_spec_compliant_pointer_origin - a boolean value to indicate how the pointer origin for an
           action command will be calculated.

           With Firefox 59 the calculation will be based on the requirements  by  the  WebDriver  specification.
           This  means  that  the pointer origin is no longer computed based on the top and left position of the
           referenced element, but on the in-view center point.

           To temporarily disable the WebDriver conformant behavior use 0 as value for this capability.

           Please note that this capability exists only temporarily, and  that  it  will  be  removed  once  all
           Selenium bindings can handle the new behavior.

       •   page_load_strategy - defines the page load strategy for the upcoming browser session.

       •   proxy - describes the proxy setup for the upcoming browser session.

       •   strict_file_interactability - a boolean value to indicate if interactability checks will  be  applied
           to &lt;input type=file&gt;. Allowed values are 1 or 0.  Default is 0.

       •   timeouts - describes the timeouts imposed on certain session operations.

       •   unhandled_prompt_behavior   -   defines  what  firefox  should  do  on  encountering  a  user  prompt

           and notify", "accept and notify" and "ignore".

       This method returns a new capabilities object.

   <b>page_load_strategy</b>
       returns the page load  strategy  &lt;https://w3c.github.io/webdriver/#dfn-table-of-page-load-strategies&gt;  to
       use   for   the  duration  of  the  session.  The  page  load  strategy  corresponds  to  the  readyState
       &lt;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/readyState#Values&gt;  and  may  be  one  of  the
       following values;

       •   normal  -  Wait  for  the  document  and  all sub-resources have finished loading.  The corresponding

           "complete".   The  load  &lt;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/load&gt; event is about to
           fire.  This strategy is the default value.

       •   eager - Wait for the document to have finished loading and have been parsed.  Sub-resources  such  as
           images,    stylesheets    and    frames    are   still   loading.    The   corresponding   readyState
           &lt;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/readyState#Values&gt; is "interactive".

       •   none   -   return   immediately   after   starting   navigation.    The   corresponding    readyState
           &lt;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/readyState#Values&gt; is "loading".
