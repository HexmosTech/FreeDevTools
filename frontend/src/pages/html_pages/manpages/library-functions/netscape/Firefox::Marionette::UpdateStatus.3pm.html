       accepts a hash as a parameter.  Allowed keys are below;

       •   app_version - application version of this update.

       •   build_id  -   build  id  &lt;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/buildID&gt; of this
           update. Used to determine a particular build, down to the hour, minute and second  of  its  creation.
           This allows the system to differentiate between several nightly builds with the same |version|.

       •   channel  -  channel  &lt;<a href="http://kb.mozillazine.org/App.update.channel">http://kb.mozillazine.org/App.update.channel</a>&gt; used to retrieve this update from
           the Update Service.

       •   details_url - URI offering details about the content of  this  update.   This  page  is  intended  to
           summarise  the  differences  between  this  update  and the previous, which also links to the release
           notes.

       •   display_version - string to display in the user interface for the version. If you want a real version
           number use app_version.

       •   elevation_failure - has an elevation failure has been encountered for this update.

       •   error_code        -        numeric        error         code         &lt;https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-
           central/file/tip/toolkit/mozapps/update/common/updatererrors.h&gt;  that  conveys additional information
           about the state of a failed update. If the update is not in the "failed" state the value is zero.

       •   install_date - when the update was installed.

       •   is_complete_update - is the update a complete replacement of the user's existing  installation  or  a
           patch representing the difference between the new version and the previous version.

       •   name - name of the update, which should look like "&lt;Application Name&gt; &lt;Update Version&gt;"

       •   number_of_updates - the number of updates available.

       •   patch_count - number of patches supplied by this update.

       •   previous_app_version - application version prior to the application being updated.

       •   prompt_wait_time  - allows overriding the default amount of time in seconds before prompting the user
           to   apply   an   update.   If   not    specified,    the    value    of    app.update.promptWaitTime
           &lt;<a href="http://kb.mozillazine.org/App.update.promptWaitTime">http://kb.mozillazine.org/App.update.promptWaitTime</a>&gt; will be used.

       •   selected_patch - currently selected patch for this update.

       •   service_url - the Update Service that supplied this update.

       •   status_text - message associated with this update, if any.

       •   type - either 'minor', 'partial', which means a binary difference between two application versions or
           'complete'  which  is  a  complete patch containing all of the replacement files to update to the new
           version

       •   unsupported - is the update no longer supported on this system.

       •   update_state - state of the selected patch;

           + pending - the update is ready to be applied.
           + pending-service - the update is ready to be applied with the service.
