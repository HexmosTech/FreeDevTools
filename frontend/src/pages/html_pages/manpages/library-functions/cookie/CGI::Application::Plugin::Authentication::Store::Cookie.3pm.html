</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       CGI::Application::Plugin::Authentication::Store::Cookie - Cookie based Store

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        use base qw(CGI::Application);
        use CGI::Application::Plugin::Session;
        use CGI::Application::Plugin::Authentication;

         __PACKAGE__-&gt;authen-&gt;config(
               STORE =&gt; ['Cookie', SECRET =&gt; "Shhh, don't tell anyone", NAME =&gt; 'CAPAUTH_DATA', EXPIRY =&gt; '+1y'],
         );

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module uses a cookie to store authentication information across multiple requests.  It works by
       creating a cookie that contains the information we would like to store (like the name of the user that is
       currently authenticated), and then base64 encoding the data.  In order to ensure that the information is
       not manipulated by the end-user, we include a CRC checksum that is generated along with our secret.
       Since the user does not know the value of the secret, they will not be able to recreate the checksum if
       they change some of the values, so we will be able to tell if the information in the cookie has been
       manipulated.

</pre><h4><b>THE</b> <b>SECRET</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Choosing</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>secret</b>
       An easy way to generate a relatively good secret is to run the following perl snippet:

         perl -MDigest::MD5=md5_base64 -l -e 'print md5_base64($$,time(),<a href="../man9999/rand.9999.html">rand</a>(9999))'

       Just use the resulting string as your secret.

   <b>Configuring</b> <b>the</b> <b>secret</b>
       There are three ways that you can provide a secret to the module:

       Hardcode the secret
           You  can  hardcode  a  secret  right  in  the CGI::Application::Plugin::Authentication::Store::Cookie
           module, so that you don't have to remember to provide one every time you use the module.   Just  open
           the source in a text editor and look at the top of the file where it defines 'our $SECRET' and follow
           the instruction listed there.

       Provide the SECRET option when using the module
           You can also just provide the secret as an option when using the module using the SECRET parameter.

             __PACKAGE__-&gt;authen-&gt;config(
                   STORE =&gt; ['Cookie', SECRET =&gt; "Shhh, don't tell anyone"],
             );

       Let the module choose a secret for you
           And  lastly, if you forget to do either of these, the module will use the name of your application as
           the secret, but that is not a very good value to use, so a warning will be spit out everytime it uses
           this.  This is the least desirable choice, and is only included as a last resort.

</pre><h4><b>DEPENDENCIES</b></h4><pre>
       This module requires the following modules to be available.

       MIME::Base64
       Digest::SHA
       CGI::Cookie

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>fetch</b>
       This method accepts a list of parameters and fetches them from the cookie data.

   <b>save</b>
       This method accepts a hash of parameters and values and stores them in the cookie data.

   <b>delete</b>
       This method accepts a list of parameters and deletes them from the cookie data.

   <b>initialize</b>
       This method will check for an existing cookie, and decode the contents for later retrieval.

   <b>cookie_name</b>
       This method will return the name of the cookie
