       CGI::Cookie - Interface to HTTP Cookies

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use CGI qw/:standard/;
           use CGI::Cookie;

           # Create new cookies and send them
           $cookie1 = CGI::Cookie-&gt;new(-name=&gt;'ID',-value=&gt;123456);
           $cookie2 = CGI::Cookie-&gt;new(-name=&gt;'preferences',
                                      -value=&gt;{ font =&gt; Helvetica,
                                                size =&gt; 12 }
                                      );
           print header(-cookie=&gt;[$cookie1,$cookie2]);

           # fetch existing cookies
           %cookies = CGI::Cookie-&gt;fetch;
           $id = $cookies{'ID'}-&gt;value;

           # create cookies returned from an external source
           %cookies = CGI::Cookie-&gt;parse($ENV{COOKIE});

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       CGI::Cookie is an interface to HTTP/1.1 cookies, a mechanism that allows Web servers to store persistent
       information on the browser's side of the connection.  Although CGI::Cookie is intended to be used in
       conjunction with CGI.pm (and is in fact used by it internally), you can use this module independently.

       For full information on cookies see

           https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265

</pre><h4><b>USING</b> <b>CGI::Cookie</b></h4><pre>
       CGI::Cookie is object oriented.  Each cookie object has a name and a value.  The name is any scalar
       value.  The value is any scalar or array value (associative arrays are also allowed).  Cookies also have
       several optional attributes, including:

       <b>1.</b> <b>expiration</b> <b>date</b>
           The  expiration date tells the browser how long to hang on to the cookie.  If the cookie specifies an
           expiration date in the future, the browser will store the cookie  information  in  a  disk  file  and
           return  it  to  the server every time the user reconnects (until the expiration date is reached).  If
           the cookie species an expiration date in the past, the browser will remove the cookie from  the  disk
           file.  If the expiration date is not specified, the cookie will persist only until the user quits the
           browser.

       <b>2.</b> <b>domain</b>
           This is a partial or complete domain name for which the cookie is valid.  The browser will return the
           cookie  to  any host that matches the partial domain name.  For example, if you specify a domain name
           of ".capricorn.com", then the browser will return the cookie to Web servers running  on  any  of  the
           machines  "www.capricorn.com", "ftp.capricorn.com", "feckless.capricorn.com", etc.  Domain names must
           contain at least two periods to prevent attempts to match on top level domains like  ".edu".   If  no
           domain  is  specified, then the browser will only return the cookie to servers on the host the cookie
           originated from.

       <b>3.</b> <b>path</b>
           If you provide a cookie path attribute, the browser will check it against your  script's  URL  before
           returning  the  cookie.   For  example,  if  you specify the path "/cgi-bin", then the cookie will be
           returned    to    each    of    the    scripts    "/cgi-bin/tally.pl",    "/cgi-bin/order.pl",    and
           "/cgi-bin/customer_service/complain.pl",  but  not  to  the  script "/cgi-private/site_admin.pl".  By
           default, the path is set to "/", so that all scripts at your site will receive the cookie.

       <b>4.</b> <b>secure</b> <b>flag</b>
           If the "secure" attribute is set, the cookie will only be sent to your script if the CGI  request  is
           occurring on a secure channel, such as SSL.

       <b>5.</b> <b>httponly</b> <b>flag</b>
           If  the  "httponly"  attribute is set, the cookie will only be accessible through HTTP Requests. This
           cookie will be inaccessible via JavaScript (to prevent XSS attacks).

           This feature is supported by nearly all modern browsers.

           Support is limited to recent releases of Chrome.

   <b>Creating</b> <b>New</b> <b>Cookies</b>
               my $c = CGI::Cookie-&gt;new(-name    =&gt;  'foo',
                                    -value   =&gt;  'bar',
                                    -expires =&gt;  '+3M',
                                  '-max-age' =&gt;  '+3M',
                                    -domain  =&gt;  '.capricorn.com',
                                    -path    =&gt;  '/cgi-bin/database',
                                    -secure  =&gt;  1,
                                    -samesite=&gt;  "Lax",
                                    -priority=&gt;  "High",
                                   );

       Create cookies from scratch with the <b>new</b> method.  The <b>-name</b> and <b>-value</b> parameters are required.  The name
       must be a scalar value.  The value can be a scalar, an array reference, or a hash  reference.   (At  some
       point  in  the  future  cookies  will  support  one  of  the Perl object serialization protocols for full
       generality).

       <b>-expires</b> accepts any of the relative or absolute date formats recognized by CGI.pm, for example "+3M" for
       three months in the future.  See CGI.pm's documentation for details.

       <b>-max-age</b> accepts the same data formats as <b>-expires</b>, but sets a relative value instead of an absolute like
       <b>-expires</b>. This is intended to be more secure since a clock could be changed to fake an absolute time.  In
       practice, as of 2011, "-max-age" still does not enjoy the widespread support that "-expires" has. You can
       set  both,  and browsers that support "-max-age" should ignore the "Expires" header. The drawback to this
       approach is the bit of bandwidth for sending an extra header on each cookie.

       <b>-domain</b> points to a domain name or to a fully qualified host name.  If not specified, the cookie will  be
       returned only to the Web server that created it.

       <b>-path</b>  points  to a partial URL on the current server.  The cookie will be returned to all URLs beginning
       with the specified path.  If not specified, it defaults to '/', which returns the cookie to all pages  at
       your site.

       <b>-secure</b>  if  set  to  a  true  value instructs the browser to return the cookie only when a cryptographic
       protocol is in use.

       <b>-httponly</b> if set to a true value, the cookie will not be accessible via JavaScript.

       <b>-samesite</b> may be "Lax", "Strict", or "None" and is an evolving part of the standards for cookies.  Please
       refer to current documentation regarding it.

       For  compatibility with Apache::Cookie, you may optionally pass in a mod_perl request object as the first
       argument to new(). It will simply be ignored:

         my $c = CGI::Cookie-&gt;new($r,
                                 -name    =&gt;  'foo',
                                 -value   =&gt;  ['bar','baz']);

   <b>Sending</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cookie</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Browser</b>
       The simplest way to send a cookie to the browser is by calling the <b>bake()</b> method:

         $c-&gt;bake;

       This will print the Set-Cookie HTTP header to STDOUT using CGI.pm. CGI.pm will be loaded for this purpose
       if it is not already. Otherwise CGI.pm is not required or used by this module.

       Under mod_perl, pass in an Apache request object:

         $c-&gt;bake($r);

       If you want to set the cookie yourself, Within a CGI script you can send  a  cookie  to  the  browser  by
       creating one or more Set-Cookie: fields in the HTTP header.  Here is a typical sequence:

         my $c = CGI::Cookie-&gt;new(-name    =&gt;  'foo',
                                 -value   =&gt;  ['bar','baz'],
                                 -expires =&gt;  '+3M');

         print "Set-Cookie: $c\n";
         print "Content-Type: text/html\n\n";

       To send more than one cookie, create several Set-Cookie: fields.

       If you are using CGI.pm, you send cookies by providing a -cookie argument to the <b>header()</b> method:

         print header(-cookie=&gt;$c);

       Mod_perl users can set cookies using the request object's <b>header_out()</b> method:

         $r-&gt;err_headers_out-&gt;add('Set-Cookie' =&gt; $c);

       Internally,  Cookie  overloads  the "" operator to call its <b>as_string()</b> method when incorporated into the
       HTTP header.   <b>as_string()</b>  turns  the  Cookie's  internal  representation  into  an  RFC-compliant  text
       representation.  You may call <b>as_string()</b> yourself if you prefer:

         print "Set-Cookie: ",$c-&gt;as_string,"\n";

   <b>Recovering</b> <b>Previous</b> <b>Cookies</b>
               %cookies = CGI::Cookie-&gt;fetch;

       <b>fetch</b>  returns  an  associative array consisting of all cookies returned by the browser.  The keys of the
       array are the cookie names.  You can iterate through the cookies this way:

               %cookies = CGI::Cookie-&gt;fetch;
               for (keys %cookies) {
                  do_something($cookies{$_});
               }

       In a scalar context, <b>fetch()</b>  returns  a  hash  reference,  which  may  be  more  efficient  if  you  are
       manipulating multiple cookies.

       CGI.pm  uses the URL escaping methods to save and restore reserved characters in its cookies.  If you are
       trying to retrieve a cookie set by a  foreign  server,  this  escaping  method  may  trip  you  up.   Use
       <b>raw_fetch()</b> instead, which has the same semantics as <b>fetch()</b>, but performs no unescaping.

       You may also retrieve cookies that were stored in some external form using the <b>parse()</b> class method:

              $COOKIES = `cat /usr/tmp/Cookie_stash`;
              %cookies = CGI::Cookie-&gt;parse($COOKIES);

       If you are in a mod_perl environment, you can save some overhead by passing the request object to <b>fetch()</b>
       like this:

          CGI::Cookie-&gt;fetch($r);

       If  the  value passed to <b>parse()</b> is undefined, an empty array will returned in list context, and an empty
       hashref will be returned in scalar context.

   <b>Manipulating</b> <b>Cookies</b>
       Cookie objects have a series of accessor methods to get and set cookie attributes.  Each accessor  has  a
       similar  syntax.   Called  without  arguments,  the  accessor returns the current value of the attribute.
       Called with an argument, the accessor changes the attribute and returns its new value.

       <b>name()</b>
           Get or set the cookie's name.  Example:

                   $name = $c-&gt;name;
                   $new_name = $c-&gt;name('fred');

       <b>value()</b>
           Get or set the cookie's value.  Example:

                   $value = $c-&gt;value;
                   @new_value = $c-&gt;value(['a','b','c','d']);

           <b>value()</b> is context sensitive.  In a list context it will return the current value of the cookie as an
           array.  In a scalar context it will return the <b>first</b> value of a multivalued cookie.

       <b>domain()</b>
           Get or set the cookie's domain.

       <b>path()</b>
           Get or set the cookie's path.

       <b>expires()</b>
           Get or set the cookie's expiration time.

       <b>max_age()</b>
           Get or set the cookie's max_age value.
