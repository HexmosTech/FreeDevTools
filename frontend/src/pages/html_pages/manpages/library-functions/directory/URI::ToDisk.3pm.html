</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       URI::ToDisk - An object for mapping a URI to an on-disk storage directory

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         # We have a directory on disk that is accessible via a web server
         my $authors = URI::ToDisk-&gt;new( '/var/www/AUTHORS', '<a href="http://ali.as/AUTHORS">http://ali.as/AUTHORS</a>' );

         # We know where a particular generated file needs to go
         my $about = $authors-&gt;catfile( 'A', 'AD', 'ADAMK', 'about.html' );

         # Save the file to disk
         my $file = $about-&gt;path;
         open( FILE, "&gt;$file" ) or die "open: $!";
         print FILE, $content;
         close FILE;

         # Show the user where to see the file
         my $uri = $about-&gt;uri;
         print "Author information is at $uri\n";

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       In several process relating to working with the web, we may need to keep track of an area of disk that
       maps to a particular URL. From this location, we should be able to derived both a filesystem path and URL
       for any given directory or file under this location that we might need to work with.

   <b>Implementation</b>
       Internally each "URI::ToDisk" object contains both a filesystem path, which is altered using File::Spec,
       and a URI object. When making a change, the path section of the URI is altered using &lt;File::Spec::Unix&gt;.

   <b>Method</b> <b>Calling</b> <b>Conventions</b>
       The main functional methods, such as "catdir" and "catfile", do <b>not</b> modify the original object, instead
       returning a new object containing the new location.

       This means that it should be used in a somewhat similar way to File::Spec.

         # The File::Spec way
         my $path = '/some/path';
         $path = File::Spec-&gt;catfile( $path, 'some', 'file.txt' );

         # The URI::ToDisk way
         my $location = URI::ToDisk-&gt;new( '/some/path', '<a href="http://foo.com/blah">http://foo.com/blah</a>' );
         $location = $location-&gt;catfile( 'some', 'file.txt' );

       OK, well it's not exactly THAT close, but you get the idea. It also allows you to do method chaining,
       which is basically

         URI::ToDisk-&gt;new( '/foo', '<a href="http://foo.com/">http://foo.com/</a>' )-&gt;catfile( 'bar.txt' )-&gt;uri

       Which may seem a little trivial now, but I expect it to get more useful later.  It also means you can do
       things like this.

         my $base = URI::ToDisk-&gt;new( '/my/cache', '<a href="http://foo.com/">http://foo.com/</a>' );
         foreach my $path ( @some_files ) {
               my $file = $base-&gt;catfile( $path );
               print $file-&gt;path . ': ' . $file-&gt;uri . "\n";
         }

       In the above example, you don't have to be continuously cloning the location, because all that stuff
       happens internally as needed.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>new</b> <b>$path,</b> <b>$http_url</b>
       The "new" constructor takes as argument a filesystem path and a http(s) URL. Both are required, and the
       method will return "undef" is either is illegal. The URL is not required to have protocol, host or port
       sections, and as such allows for host-relative URL to be used.

       Returns a new "URI::ToDisk" object on success, or "undef" on failure.

   <b>param</b> <b>$various</b>
       "param" is provided as a mechanism for higher order modules to flexibly accept URI::ToDisk's as
       parameters. In this case, it accepts either an existing URI::ToDisk object, two arguments ($path,
       $http_url), or a reference to an array containing the same two arguments.

       Returns a URI::ToDisk if possible, or "undef" if one cannot be provided.

   <b>uri</b>
       The "uri" method gets and returns the current URI of the location, in string form.

   <b>URI</b>
       The capitalised "URI" method gets and returns a copy of the raw URI, held internally by the location.
       Note that only a copy is returned, and as such as safe to further modify yourself without effecting the
       location.

   <b>path</b>
       The "path" method returns the filesystem path componant of the location.

   <b>catdir</b> <b>'dir',</b> <b>'dir',</b> <b>...</b>
       A File::Spec workalike, the "catdir" method acts in the same way as for File::Spec, modifying both
       componants of the location. The "catdir" method returns a <b>new</b> URI::ToDisk object representing the new
       location, or "undef" on error.

   <b>catfile</b> <b>[</b> <b>'dir',</b> <b>...,</b> <b>]</b> <b>$file</b>
       Like "catdir", the "catfile" method acts in the same was as for File::Spec, and returns a new URI::ToDisk
       object representing the file, or "undef" on error.

</pre><h4><b>TO</b> <b>DO</b></h4><pre>
       Add more File::Spec-y methods as needed. Ask if you need one.
