</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Dist::Zilla::Plugin::ArchiveRelease - Move the release tarball to an archive directory

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This document describes version 6.000 of Dist::Zilla::Plugin::ArchiveRelease, released December 17, 2017
       as part of Dist-Zilla-Plugins-CJM version 6.000.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       In your <u>dist.ini</u>:

         [ArchiveRelease]
         directory = releases      ; this is the default

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       If included, this plugin will cause the <u>release</u> command to mark the tarball read-only and move it to an
       archive directory.  You can combine this with another Releaser plugin (like UploadToCPAN), but it must be
       the last Releaser in your config (or the other Releasers won't be able to find the file being released).

       It also acts as a FilePruner in order to prevent Dist::Zilla from including the archived releases in
       future builds.

</pre><h4><b>ATTRIBUTES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>directory</b>
       The directory to which the tarball will be moved.  It may begin with "~" (or "~user") to mean your (or
       some other user's) home directory.  Defaults to <u>releases</u>.  If the directory doesn't exist, it will be
       created during the BeforeRelease phase.

       All files inside this directory will be pruned from the distribution.

</pre><h4><b>INCOMPATIBILITIES</b></h4><pre>
       None reported.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       No bugs have been reported.
