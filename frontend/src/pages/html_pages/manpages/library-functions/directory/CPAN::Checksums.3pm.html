</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       CPAN::Checksums - Write a "CHECKSUMS" file for a directory as on CPAN

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use CPAN::Checksums qw(updatedir);
         my $success = updatedir($directory, $root);

</pre><h4><b>INCOMPATIBILITY</b> <b>ALERT</b></h4><pre>
       Since version 1.0 the generation of the attribute "shortname" is turned off by default. It was too slow
       and was not used as far as I know, and above all, it could fail on large directories. The shortname
       feature can still be turned on by setting the global variable $TRY_SHORTNAME to a true value.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       $success = updatedir($dir[, $root])
         $dir  is  a  directory.  <b>Updatedir()</b> writes a "CHECKSUMS" file into that directory, unless a previously
         written "CHECKSUMS" file is there that is still valid. Returns 2 if a new  "CHECKSUMS"  file  has  been
         written, 1 if a valid "CHECKSUMS" file is already there, otherwise dies.

         If $root is given, the hash entry with the key "cpan_path" is relative to this root directory.

         Note:  since  version  2.0  updatedir  on empty directories behaves just the same. In older versions it
         silently did nothing.

   <b>Global</b> <b>Variables</b> <b>in</b> <b>package</b> <b>CPAN::Checksums</b>
       $IGNORE_MATCH
           If the global variable $IGNORE_MATCH is  set,  then  all  files  matching  this  expression  will  be
           completely  ignored and will not be included in the CPAN "CHECKSUMS" files. Per default this variable
           is set to

               qr{(?i-xsm:readme$)}

       $CAUTION
           Setting the global variable $CAUTION causes <b>updatedir()</b> to report changes of files in the  attributes
           "size", "mtime", "md5", or "md5-ungz" to STDERR.

       $TRY_SHORTNAME
           By setting the global variable $TRY_SHORTNAME to a true value, you can tell <b>updatedir()</b> to include an
           attribute  "shortname" in the resulting hash that is 8.3-compatible. Please note, that <b>updatedir()</b> in
           this case may be slow and may even fail on large directories, because it will always  only  try  1000
           iterations to find a name that is not yet taken and then give up.

       $SIGNING_KEY
           Setting  the  global variable $SIGNING_KEY makes the generated "CHECKSUMS" file to be clear-signed by
           the command specified in $SIGNING_PROGRAM (defaults to "gpg --clearsign --default-key "), passing the
           signing key as an extra argument.  The resulting "CHECKSUMS" file should look like:

               0&amp;&amp;&lt;&lt;''; # this PGP-signed message is also valid perl
               -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
               Hash: SHA1

               # CHECKSUMS file written on ... by CPAN::Checksums (v...)
               $cksum = {
                   ...
               };

               __END__
               -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----
               ...

               -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----
           note that the actual data remains intact, but two extra lines are added to make  it  legal  for  both
           OpenPGP and perl syntax.

       $MIN_MTIME_CHECKSUMS
           If  the global variable $MIN_MTIME_CHECKSUMS is set, then updatedir will renew signatures on checksum
           files that have an older mtime than the given value.

</pre><h4><b>PREREQUISITES</b></h4><pre>
       DirHandle, IO::File, Digest::MD5, Digest::SHA, Compress::Bzip2, Compress::Zlib, File::Spec, Data::Dumper,
       Data::Compare, File::Temp

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       If updatedir is interrupted, it may leave a temporary file lying around. These files have the  File::Temp
       template "CHECKSUMS.XXXX" and should be harvested by a cronjob.
