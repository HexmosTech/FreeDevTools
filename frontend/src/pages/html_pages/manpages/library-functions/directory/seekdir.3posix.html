</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       seekdir — set the position of a directory stream

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/dirent.h">dirent.h</a>&gt;

       void seekdir(DIR *<u>dirp</u>, long <u>loc</u>);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>seekdir</u>()  function  shall  set the position of the next <u>readdir</u>() operation on the directory stream
       specified by <u>dirp</u> to the position specified by <u>loc</u>.  The value of <u>loc</u> should have been returned  from  an
       earlier call to <u>telldir</u>() using the same directory stream. The new position reverts to the one associated
       with the directory stream when <u>telldir</u>() was performed.

       If  the  value  of  <u>loc</u>  was  not obtained from an earlier call to <u>telldir</u>(), or if a call to <u>rewinddir</u>()
       occurred between the call to <u>telldir</u>() and the call to <u>seekdir</u>(), the  results  of  subsequent  calls  to
       <u>readdir</u>() are unspecified.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>seekdir</u>() function shall not return a value.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       No errors are defined.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       The  original  standard developers perceived that there were restrictions on the use of the <u>seekdir</u>() and
       <u>telldir</u>() functions related to implementation details, and for that reason these functions  need  not  be
       supported  on  all  POSIX-conforming  systems.  They  are  required on implementations supporting the XSI
       option.

       One of the perceived problems of implementation is that returning to a given  point  in  a  directory  is
       quite  difficult  to  describe formally, in spite of its intuitive appeal, when systems that use B-trees,
       hashing functions, or other similar mechanisms to order their directories are considered. The  definition
       of <u>seekdir</u>() and <u>telldir</u>() does not specify whether, when using these interfaces, a given directory entry
       will be seen at all, or more than once.

       On  systems  not  supporting  these functions, their capability can sometimes be accomplished by saving a
       filename found by <u>readdir</u>() and later using <u>rewinddir</u>() and a loop on <u>readdir</u>() to relocate the  position
       from which the filename was saved.

</pre><h4><b>FUTURE</b> <b>DIRECTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
