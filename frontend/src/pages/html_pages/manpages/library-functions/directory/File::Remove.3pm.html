</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       File::Remove - Remove files and directories

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 1.61

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use File::Remove 'remove';

           # removes (without recursion) several files
           remove( '*.c', '*.pl' );

           # removes (with recursion) several directories
           remove( \1, qw{directory1 directory2} );

           # removes (with recursion) several files and directories
           remove( \1, qw{file1 file2 directory1 *~} );

           # removes without globbing:
           remove( \1, {glob =&gt; 0}, '*');

           # trashes (with support for undeleting later) several files
           trash( '*~' );

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>File::Remove::remove</b> removes files and directories.  It acts like <b><a href="file:/bin/rm">/bin/rm</a></b>, for the most part.  Although
       "unlink" can be given a list of files, it will not remove directories; this module remedies that.  It
       also accepts wildcards, * and ?, as arguments for filenames.

       <b>File::Remove::trash</b> accepts the same arguments as <b>remove</b>, with the addition of an optional, infrequently
       used "other platforms" hashref.

</pre><h4><b>SUBROUTINES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>remove</b>
       Removes files and directories.  Directories are removed recursively like in <b>rm</b> <b>-rf</b> if the first argument
       is a reference to a scalar that evaluates to true.  If the first argument is a reference to a scalar,
       then it is used as the value of the recursive flag.  By default it's false so only pass \1 to it.

       If the next argument is a hash reference then it is a key/values of options.  Currently, there is one
       supported option of "'glob' =&gt; 0" which prevents globbing. E.g:

           remove(\1, {glob =&gt; 0}, '*');

       Will not remove files globbed by '*' and will only remove the file called asterisk if it exists.

       In list context it returns a list of files/directories removed, in scalar context it returns the number
       of files/directories removed.  The list/number should match what was passed in if everything went well.

   <b>rm</b>
       Just calls <b>remove</b>.  It's there for people who get tired of typing <b>remove</b>.

   <b>clear</b>
       The "clear" function is a version of "remove" designed for use in test scripts. It takes a list of paths
       that it will both initially delete during the current test run, and then further flag for deletion at
       END-time as a convenience for the next test run.

   <b>trash</b>
       Removes files and directories, with support for undeleting later.  Accepts an optional "other platforms"
       hashref, passing the remaining arguments to <b>remove</b>.

       Win32
           Requires Win32::FileOp.

           Installation  not  actually enforced on Win32 yet, since Win32::FileOp has badly failing dependencies
           at time of writing.

       OS X
           Requires Mac::Glue.

       Other platforms
           The first argument to <b>trash()</b> must be a hashref with two keys, 'rmdir' and 'unlink', each referencing
           a coderef.  The coderefs will be called with the filenames that are to be deleted.
