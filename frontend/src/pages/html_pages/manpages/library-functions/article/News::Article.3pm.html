</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       News::Article - Object for handling Usenet articles in mail or news form.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use News::Article;

       See below for functions available.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       An object for representing a Usenet article (or a mail message). Primarily written for use with mail2news
       and/or moderation programs. (Not really intended for transit use.)

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
         use News::Article;

       Article exports nothing.

       Article objects must be created with the <u>new</u> method.

   <b>Article</b> <b>Methods</b>
       new ()
       new ( SOURCE [,MAXSIZE [,MAXHEADS]] )
           Use  this  to  create  a  new  Article object. Makes an empty article if no parameters are specified,
           otherwise reads in an article from "SOURCE" as for "read".

       clone ()
           Create a new Article as an exact clone of the current one.  Returns a ref to the new object.

       envelope ( [SENDER] )
           If "SENDER" is specified,  sets  the  envelope  sender  to  the  specified  value  (which  will  then
           subsequently  be used if the article is mailed).  Returns the (new or current) envelope sender in any
           case.

       rawheaders ()
           Returns a list (or a reference to an array if in scalar context) of the original header lines of  the
           article, as read from the input source. Terminating newlines are not included. (Continued headers are
           returned as single strings with embedded newlines.)

       header_names ()
           Returns a list of the names of all headers currently present in the article.

       headers ([FIRST [,NEXT [,LAST]]])
           Returns  a  list  of  all  header  strings  with no terminating newlines. Continued headers will have
           embedded newlines.

           FIRST, NEXT and LAST are optional references to arrays of header names. The  order  of  the  returned
           headers is as follows:

            - headers specified by FIRST (one value only per name)
            - headers in the order originally read in (if any)
            - headers specified by NEXT (one value only per name)
            - any remaining headers not named in LAST, sorted by name
            - headers named in LAST (all values)

           LAST  overrides the original order of headers, but NEXT does not.  Headers named in LAST will also be
           grouped together by header name.

       headers_first (HDR...)
           Set default ordering for <b>headers()</b>.

       headers_next (HDR...)
           Set default ordering for <b>headers()</b>.

       headers_last (HDR...)
           Set default ordering for <b>headers()</b>.

       set_headers ( NAME, VALUE [, NAME, VALUE [...]] )
           For each header name supplied, replace any current occurrences  of  the  header  with  the  specified
           value(s).  Each  value  may  be  a single scalar, or a reference to an array of values. Returns undef
           without completing the assignments if any attempt is made to supply  multiple  values  for  a  unique
           header.  Undef  or  empty values cause the header to be deleted.  (If an array is supplied, it is not
           copied. This is probably a mistake and should not be relied on.)

       add_headers ( NAME, VALUE [, NAME, VALUE [...]] )
           Add new header values without affecting existing ones. Each value is either a  single  scalar,  or  a
           reference  to  an  array of values. Returns undef without completing if any attempt is made to supply
           duplicate values for a unique header. (If an array reference is supplied, the array is copied.)

       drop_headers ( NAME [, NAME [...]] )
           Delete all values of the specified header(s).

       header ( NAME )
           Returns a list of values for the specified header. Returns a null list if the header does not  exist.
           In scalar context, returns the first value found or undef.

       rename_header ( SRC, DEST [, ACTION] )
           Transform the name of a header without touching the value. Fails if the source header does not exist.
           Returns undef on failure, true on success.

           Optional  ACTION (may be "drop", "clobber", "add", or "fail" (default)), specifies what to do if both
           source and destination exist:

             ACTION     PREVIOUS DEST
             drop       unchanged      (SRC dropped)
             clobber    dropped        (SRC replaces DEST)
             add        preserved      (SRC added to DEST)
             fail       unchanged      (operation fails)

       body ()
           Return the body of the article as a list of lines (no newlines), or a reference to an array in scalar
           context (the array may be modified in this case).

       lines ()
           Returns the number of lines in the article body.

       bytes ()
           Returns the total size of the article body, not counting newlines.

       set_body ( BODY )
           Replace the current article body with the specified text.  Expects a list,  each  item  of  which  is
           either  one  line,  or  multiple  lines  separated  by newlines. (Trailing newlines on the values are
           ignored.)

       add_body ( BODY )
           Append the specified text to the current article body.  Expects a list, each item of which is  either
           one  line,  or  multiple  lines separated by newlines, or a reference to an array of lines. (Trailing
           newlines on the values are ignored.)

       trim_blank_lines ()
           Remove any trailing blank lines from the article body. Returns the number of lines removed.

       read_headers ( SOURCE, MAXSIZE )
           Read article headers (terminated by an  empty  line)  from  the  specified  source  (see  "read"  for
           definition of allowed sources).

           Gives up (returning undef) if more than MAXSIZE bytes are read. Returns the amount read.

       read_body ( SOURCE, MAXSIZE )
           Read  an  article body from the specified source (see "read"). Stops at end of file; fails (returning
           undef) if MAXSIZE is reached prior to that point.  Returns the number of bytes read (may be 0 if  the
           body is null).

           Trailing  blank  lines  are  NOT  removed  (an  incompatible,  but regrettably necessary, change from
           previous versions); see trim_blank_lines if you need to do that.

       read ( SOURCE [,MAXSIZE [,MAXHEADS]] )
           Reads in an article from "SOURCE".

           "SOURCE" may be any of the following:

           - a CODE ref, which is called to return lines or chunks of data

           - an ARRAY ref, assumed to contain a list of lines with optional line terminators

           - a SCALAR ref, assumed to contain text with embedded newlines

           - a scalar, assumed to be a filename, which is opened and read

           - anything else is assumed to be a glob, reference to a glob, or reference to a  filehandle,  and  is
           read from accordingly

           When  reading  in articles, "MAXHEADS" is the maximum header size to read (default 8k), and "MAXSIZE"
           is the maximum article body size (default 256k). If "MAXSIZE" is explicitly specified as 0,  then  no
           attempt at reading the body is made. Returns the total number of bytes read, or undef if either limit
           is reached or no headers were found.

       write ( FILE )
           Write the entire article to the specified filehandle reference.

       write_unique_file ( DIR [,MODE] )
           Write  the  article  to  a  (hopefully)  uniquely-named file in the specified directory.  The file is
           written under a temporary name (with a leading period) and  relinked  when  complete.  Returns  1  if
           successful, otherwise undef.

           MODE  is  the access mode to use for the created file (default 644); this will be modified in turn by
           the current umask.

           The implementation is careful to avoid losing the file or clobbering existing files even in the  case
           of  a  name  collision, but relies on POSIX <b>link()</b> semantics and may fail on lesser operating systems
           (or buggy NFS implementations).

       write_original ( FILE )
           Write the original headers followed by the article body to the specified filehandle reference.

       sendmail ( [COMMAND] )
           Get or set the command and options that will be used to  mail  the  article.  Defaults  to  a  system
           dependent value such as
             /usr/sbin/sendmail -oi -oem

       mail ( [RECIPIENTS...] )
           Mails  the  article to the specified list of recipients, or to the addressed recipients in the header
           (To, Cc, Bcc) if none are supplied.  Attempts to set the  envelope  sender  to  the  stored  envelope
           sender, if set, so unset that before mailing if you do not want this behavior.

       post ( [CONN] )
           Post  the  article.  Avoids  inews  due  to  undesirable header munging and unwarranted complaints to
           stderr. Takes an optional parameter which is a Net::NNTP reference.  If supplied, posts  the  article
           to it; otherwise opens a new reader connection and posts to that.

           Throws an exception containing the error message on failure.

       ihave ( [CONN] )
           Inject  the  article. Takes an optional parameter which is a Net::NNTP reference.  If supplied, posts
           the article to it; otherwise opens a new transport connection and posts to that. All required headers
           must already be present, including Path and Message-ID.

           Throws an exception containing the error message on failure.

       add_message_id ( [PREFIX [, DOMAIN] ] )
           If the current article lacks a message-id, then create one.

       add_date ( [TIME] )
           If the current article lacks a date, then add one (in local time).  If TIME is  specified  (numerical
           Unix time), it is used instead of the current time.

       sign_pgpmoose ( GROUP, PASSPHRASE [, KEYID] )
           Signs  the  article  according  to the PGPMoose spec.  We require that pgp be on the path to do this.
           Takes a "group" which can be either a newsgroup or an address, a PGP password, and an optional key id
           and returns a null list on success, the PGP error output as a list on failure.

           If the key id is omitted, we will assume that if the group is an e-mail address, the key id  is  that
           address  surrounded  by  &lt;&gt;,  and otherwise the key id will be the group with a space on either side.
           This  is  so  that  one  can  help  PGP  distinguish  between  the  keys  for  (say)  mod.config  and
           mod.config.status.  The PGP key id should be something like:

             Moderator of group.name &lt;<a href="mailto:request-address@some.host">request-address@some.host</a>&gt;

           The  article  to be signed must already have all of the headers needed by PGPMoose (Newsgroups, From,
           Subject) or this will fail. Message-ID is added if necessary.

       verify_pgpmoose ( GROUP )
           Verifies an article signature according to the PGPMoose spec.  We require that pgp be on the path  to
           do this.  Takes a "group" which can be either a newsgroup or an address, and an optional key id.

           Looks  for a X-Auth header matching the specified group or address, and if found, checks the validity
           of the signature. If successful, returns the signer identity (from the PGP output), otherwise returns
           false.

       sign_control ( KEYID, PASSPHRASE [, HEADER [...] ] )
           Signs the article in the manner used for control messages.  This is derived from signcontrol, written
           by David Lawrence, but with fewer sanity checks since we  assume  people  know  what  they're  doing.
           Caveat programmer.

           We  take a key id, a PGP password, and an optional list of extra headers to add to the signature.  By
           default, Subject, Control, Message-ID, Date, From, and Sender are  signed.  Any  signed  header  that
           isn't  present  in  the  article  will  be  signed  with  an  empty  value.  Date  and Message-ID are
           automatically added if needed.

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
       This module is not fully transparent. In particular:

       -   Case of headers is smashed

       -   improper duplicate headers may be discarded

       -   Broken or dubious header names are not preserved

       These factors make it undesirable to use this module in news transit applications.
