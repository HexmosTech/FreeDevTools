</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Bread::Board::Service::WithDependencies - Services with dependencies

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 0.37

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This is a sub-role of Bread::Board::Service, for services with dependencies. It provides the mechanism to
       recursively resolve dependencies.

</pre><h4><b>ATTRIBUTES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>"dependencies"</b>
       Hashref, constrained by "Bread::Board::Service::Dependencies". Values must be instances of
       Bread::Board::Dependency, but can be coerced from various other types, see the type's docs.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>"add_dependency"</b>
         $service-&gt;add_dependency(name=&gt;$dep);

       Adds a new dependency.

   <b>"get_dependency"</b>
         my $dep = $service-&gt;get_dependency('name');

       Gets a dependency by name.

   <b>"has_dependency"</b>
         if ($service-&gt;has_dependency('name')) { ... }

       Returns true if this service has a dependency with the given name.

   <b>"has_dependencies"</b>
         if ($service-&gt;has_dependencies) { ... }

       Returns true if this service has any dependency.

   <b>"get_all_dependencies"</b>
         my %deps = $service-&gt;get_all_dependencies;

       Returns all the dependencies for this service, as a key-value list.

   <b>"init_params"</b>
       Builder for the service parameters, augmented to inject all the resolved dependencies into the "params"
       attribute, so that "get" can use them.

   <b>"get"</b>
       <u>After</u> the "get" method, the "params" attribute is cleared, to make sure that dependencies will be
       resolved again on the next call (of course, if the service is using a singleton lifecycle, the whole
       "getting" only happens once).

   <b>"resolve_dependencies"</b>
         my %name_object_map = $self-&gt;resolve_dependencies;

       For each element of "dependencies", calls its "service" method to retrieve the service we're dependent
       on, then tries to instantiate the value of the service. This can happen in a few different ways:

       the service is not locked, and does not require any parameter
           just call "get" on it

       the service is not locked, requires parameters, but the dependency has values for them
           call "$service-&gt;get(%{$dependency-&gt;service_params})"

       the service is not locked, requires parameters, and we don't have values for them
           we  can't  instantiate  anything  at  this  point, so we use a Bread::Board::Service::Deferred::Thunk
           instance, on which you can call the "inflate" method, passing it all the needed  parameters,  to  get
           the actual instance

       the service is locked
           we  return  a  Bread::Board::Service::Deferred  that will proxy to the instance that the service will
           eventually return; yes, this means that in many cases circular dependencies can be resolved,  at  the
           cost of a proxy object
