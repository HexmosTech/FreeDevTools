       Dpkg::Deps - parse and manipulate dependencies of Debian packages

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The Dpkg::Deps module provides classes implementing various types of dependencies.

       The most important function is <b>deps_parse()</b>, it turns a dependency line in a set of
       Dpkg::Deps::{Simple,AND,OR,Union} objects depending on the case.

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       All the deps_* functions are exported by default.

       deps_eval_implication($rel_p, $v_p, $rel_q, $v_q)
           ($rel_p,  $v_p)  and  ($rel_q,  $v_q)  express  two dependencies as (relation, version). The relation
           variable can have the following values that are exported by Dpkg::Version:  REL_EQ,  REL_LT,  REL_LE,
           REL_GT, REL_GT.

           This  functions  returns  1 if the "p" dependency implies the "q" dependency. It returns 0 if the "p"
           dependency implies that "q" is not satisfied. It returns undef when there's no implication.

           The $v_p and $v_q parameter should be Dpkg::Version objects.

       $dep = deps_concat(@dep_list)
           This function concatenates multiple dependency lines into a single line, joining them with  ",  "  if
           appropriate, and always returning a valid string.

       $dep = deps_parse($line, %opts)
           This  function  parses  the  dependency  line  and  returns  an object, either a Dpkg::Deps::AND or a
           Dpkg::Deps::Union. Various options can alter the behavior of that function.

           use_arch (defaults to 1)
               Take into account the architecture restriction part of the dependencies.  Set to 0 to  completely
               ignore that information.

           host_arch (defaults to the current architecture)
               Define  the  host  architecture.  By  default it uses <b>Dpkg::Arch::get_host_arch()</b> to identify the
               proper architecture.

           build_arch (defaults to the current architecture)
               Define the build architecture. By default it uses <b>Dpkg::Arch::get_build_arch()</b>  to  identify  the
               proper architecture.

           reduce_arch (defaults to 0)
               If  set  to  1,  ignore  dependencies  that  do  not  concern the current host architecture. This
               implicitly strips off the architecture restriction list so that the  resulting  dependencies  are
               directly applicable to the current architecture.

           use_profiles (defaults to 1)
               Take into account the profile restriction part of the dependencies. Set to 0 to completely ignore
               that information.

           build_profiles (defaults to no profile)
               Define the active build profiles. By default no profile is defined.

           reduce_profiles (defaults to 0)
               If  set  to 1, ignore dependencies that do not concern the current build profile. This implicitly
               strips off the profile restriction formula  so  that  the  resulting  dependencies  are  directly
               applicable to the current profiles.

           reduce_restrictions (defaults to 0)
               If  set  to  1,  ignore  dependencies  that  do not concern the current set of restrictions. This
               implicitly strips off any architecture restriction  list  or  restriction  formula  so  that  the
               resulting  dependencies  are  directly  applicable  to  the  current restriction.  This currently
               implies "reduce_arch" and "reduce_profiles", and overrides them if set.

           union (defaults to 0)
               If set to 1, returns a Dpkg::Deps::Union instead of a Dpkg::Deps::AND.   Use  this  when  parsing
               non-dependency fields like Conflicts.

           virtual (defaults to 0)
               If  set to 1, allow only virtual package version relations, that is none, or "=".  This should be
               set whenever working with Provides fields.

           build_dep (defaults to 0)
               If set to 1, allow build-dep only arch  qualifiers,  that  is  ":native".   This  should  be  set
               whenever working with build-deps.

           tests_dep (defaults to 0)
               If  set  to  1, allow tests-specific package names in dependencies, that is "@" and "@builddeps@"
               (since  dpkg  1.18.7).  This  should  be  set  whenever  working  with  dependency  fields   from
               <u>debian/tests/control</u>.

               This  option implicitly (and forcibly) enables "build_dep" because test dependencies are based on
               build dependencies (since dpkg 1.22.1).

       $bool = deps_iterate($deps, $callback_func)
           This function visits all elements of the dependency object, calling the callback  function  for  each
           element.

           The  callback function is expected to return true when everything is fine, or false if something went
           wrong, in which case the iteration will stop.

           Return the same value as the callback function.

       deps_compare($a, $b)
           Implements a comparison operator between two dependency objects.  This function  is  mainly  used  to
           implement the <b>sort()</b> method.

</pre><h4><b>CLASSES</b> <b>-</b> <b>Dpkg::Deps::*</b></h4><pre>
       There  are  several  kind of dependencies. A Dpkg::Deps::Simple dependency represents a single dependency
       statement (it relates to one package only).  Dpkg::Deps::Multiple dependencies are built on top  of  this
       class and combine several dependencies in different manners. Dpkg::Deps::AND represents the logical "AND"
       between  dependencies  while Dpkg::Deps::OR represents the logical "OR". Dpkg::Deps::Multiple objects can
       contain Dpkg::Deps::Simple object as well as other Dpkg::Deps::Multiple objects.

       In practice, the code is only meant to handle the realistic  cases  which,  given  Debian's  dependencies
       structure,  imply  those  restrictions:  AND can contain Simple or OR objects, OR can only contain Simple
       objects.

       Dpkg::Deps::KnownFacts is a special class that is used while evaluating dependencies and while trying  to
       simplify  them. It represents a set of installed packages along with the virtual packages that they might
       provide.
