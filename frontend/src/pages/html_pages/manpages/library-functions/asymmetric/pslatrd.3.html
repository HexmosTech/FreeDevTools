       PSLATRD   -   reduce   NB  rows  and  columns  of  a  real  symmetric  distributed  matrix  sub(  A  )  =
       A(IA:IA+N-1,JA:JA+N-1) to symmetric tridiagonal form by an orthogonal similarity transformation Q' * sub(

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       SUBROUTINE PSLATRD( UPLO, N, NB, A, IA, JA, DESCA, D, E, TAU, W, IW, JW, DESCW, WORK )

           CHARACTER       UPLO

           INTEGER         IA, IW, JA, JW, N, NB

           INTEGER         DESCA( * ), DESCW( * )

           REAL            A( * ), D( * ), E( * ), TAU( * ), W( * ), WORK( * )

</pre><h4><b>PURPOSE</b></h4><pre>
       PSLATRD  reduces  NB  rows  and  columns  of  a  real  symmetric  distributed   matrix   sub(   A   )   =
       A(IA:IA+N-1,JA:JA+N-1) to symmetric tridiagonal form by an orthogonal similarity transformation Q' * sub(
       A  )  * Q, and returns the matrices V and W which are needed to apply the transformation to the unreduced
       part of sub( A ).

       If UPLO = 'U', PSLATRD reduces the last NB rows and columns of a matrix, of which the upper  triangle  is
       supplied;
       if  UPLO = 'L', PSLATRD reduces the first NB rows and columns of a matrix, of which the lower triangle is
       supplied.

       This is an auxiliary routine called by PSSYTRD.

       Notes
       =====

       Each global data object is described by  an  associated  description  vector.   This  vector  stores  the
       information required to establish the mapping between an object element and its corresponding process and
       memory location.

       Let  A  be  a  generic  term  for  any  2D  block cyclicly distributed array.  Such a global array has an
       associated description vector DESCA.  In the following comments, the character _ should be  read  as  "of
       the global array".

       NOTATION        STORED IN      EXPLANATION
       ---------------  -------------- -------------------------------------- DTYPE_A(global) DESCA( DTYPE_ )The
       descriptor type.  In this case,
                                      DTYPE_A = 1.
       CTXT_A (global) DESCA( CTXT_ ) The BLACS context handle, indicating
                                      the BLACS process grid A is distribu-
                                      ted over. The context itself is glo-
                                      bal, but the handle (the integer
                                      value) may vary.
       M_A    (global) DESCA( M_ )    The number of rows in the global
                                      array A.
       N_A    (global) DESCA( N_ )    The number of columns in the global
                                      array A.
       MB_A   (global) DESCA( MB_ )   The blocking factor used to distribute
                                      the rows of the array.
       NB_A   (global) DESCA( NB_ )   The blocking factor used to distribute
                                      the columns of the array.
       RSRC_A (global) DESCA( RSRC_ ) The process row over which the first
                                      row of the array A is distributed.  CSRC_A (global)  DESCA(  CSRC_  )  The
       process column over which the
                                      first column of the array A is
                                      distributed.
       LLD_A  (local)  DESCA( LLD_ )  The leading dimension of the local
                                      array.  LLD_A &gt;= MAX(1,LOCr(M_A)).

       Let  K  be  the  number  of rows or columns of a distributed matrix, and assume that its process grid has
       dimension p x q.
       LOCr( K ) denotes the number of elements of K that a process would receive if K were distributed over the
       p processes of its process column.
       Similarly, LOCc( K ) denotes the number of elements  of  K  that  a  process  would  receive  if  K  were
       distributed over the q processes of its process row.
       The values of LOCr() and LOCc() may be determined via a call to the ScaLAPACK tool function, NUMROC:
               LOCr( M ) = NUMROC( M, MB_A, MYROW, RSRC_A, NPROW ),
               LOCc(  N ) = NUMROC( N, NB_A, MYCOL, CSRC_A, NPCOL ).  An upper bound for these quantities may be
       computed by:
               LOCr( M ) &lt;= ceil( ceil(M/MB_A)/NPROW )*MB_A
               LOCc( N ) &lt;= ceil( ceil(N/NB_A)/NPCOL )*NB_A

</pre><h4><b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       UPLO    (global input) CHARACTER
               Specifies whether the upper or lower triangular part of the symmetric matrix sub( A ) is stored:
               = 'U': Upper triangular
               = 'L': Lower triangular

       N       (global input) INTEGER
               The number of rows and columns to be operated on, i.e. the order  of  the  distributed  submatrix
               sub( A ). N &gt;= 0.

       NB      (global input) INTEGER
               The number of rows and columns to be reduced.

       A       (local input/local output) REAL pointer into the
               local  memory  to  an array of dimension (LLD_A,LOCc(JA+N-1)).  On entry, this array contains the
               local pieces of the symmetric distributed matrix sub( A ).  If UPLO =  'U',  the  leading  N-by-N
               upper  triangular  part  of  sub(  A  ) contains the upper triangular part of the matrix, and its
               strictly lower triangular part is not referenced.  If  UPLO  =  'L',  the  leading  N-by-N  lower
               triangular  part  of  sub( A ) contains the lower triangular part of the matrix, and its strictly
               upper triangular part is not referenced.  On exit, if UPLO = 'U', the last NB columns  have  been
               reduced to tridiagonal form, with the diagonal elements overwriting the diagonal elements of sub(
               A  );  the elements above the diagonal with the array TAU, represent the orthogonal matrix Q as a
               product of elementary reflectors. If UPLO = 'L', the  first  NB  columns  have  been  reduced  to
               tridiagonal  form,  with the diagonal elements overwriting the diagonal elements of sub( A ); the
               elements below the diagonal with the array TAU, represent the orthogonal matrix Q as a product of
               elementary reflectors; See Further Details.  IA      (global input) INTEGER The row index in  the

               The  diagonal  elements  of the tridiagonal matrix T: D(i) = A(i,i). D is tied to the distributed
               matrix A.

       E       (local output) REAL array, dimension LOCc(JA+N-1)

               E(i) = A(i,i+1) if UPLO = 'U', E(i) = A(i+1,i) if UPLO = 'L'. E is tied to the distributed matrix
               A.

       TAU     (local output) REAL, array, dimension
               LOCc(JA+N-1).  This  array  contains  the scalar factors TAU of the elementary reflectors. TAU is
               tied to the distributed matrix A.

       W       (local output) REAL pointer into the local memory
               to an array of dimension (LLD_W,NB_W), This array contains the  local  pieces  of  the  N-by-NB_W
               matrix W required to update the unreduced part of sub( A ).

</pre><h4><b>FURTHER</b> <b>DETAILS</b></h4><pre>
       If UPLO = 'U', the matrix Q is represented as a product of elementary reflectors

          Q = H(n) H(n-1) . . . H(n-nb+1).

       Each H(i) has the form

          H(i) = I - tau * v * v'

       where tau is a real scalar, and v is a real vector with
       v(i:n) = 0 and v(i-1) = 1; v(1:i-1) is stored on exit in
       A(ia:ia+i-2,ja+i), and tau in TAU(ja+i-1).

       If UPLO = 'L', the matrix Q is represented as a product of elementary reflectors

          Q = <a href="../man1/H.1.html">H</a>(1) <a href="../man2/H.2.html">H</a>(2) . . . H(nb).

       Each H(i) has the form

          H(i) = I - tau * v * v'

       where tau is a real scalar, and v is a real vector with
       v(1:i) = 0 and v(i+1) = 1; v(i+2:n) is stored on exit in
       A(ia+i+1:ia+n-1,ja+i-1), and tau in TAU(ja+i-1).

       The  elements  of  the vectors v together form the N-by-NB matrix V which is needed, with W, to apply the
       transformation to the unreduced part of the matrix, using a symmetric rank-2k update of the form: sub(  A
       ) := sub( A ) - V*W' - W*V'.

       The contents of A on exit are illustrated by the following examples with n = 5 and nb = 2:

       if UPLO = 'U':                       if UPLO = 'L':

         (  a   a   a   v4  v5 )              (  d                  )
         (      a   a   v4  v5 )              (  1   d              )
         (          a   1   v5 )              (  v1  1   a          )
         (              d   1  )              (  v1  v2  a   a      )
         (                  d  )              (  v1  v2  a   a   a  )

       where  d  denotes  a  diagonal element of the reduced matrix, a denotes an element of the original matrix
       that is unchanged, and vi denotes an element of the vector defining H(i).
