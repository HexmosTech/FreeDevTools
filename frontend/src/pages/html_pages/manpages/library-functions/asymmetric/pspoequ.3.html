</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       PSPOEQU  -  compute  row  and  column  scalings  intended to equilibrate a distributed symmetric positive
       definite matrix sub( A ) = A(IA:IA+N-1,JA:JA+N-1) and reduce its condition number (with  respect  to  the
       two-norm)

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       SUBROUTINE PSPOEQU( N, A, IA, JA, DESCA, SR, SC, SCOND, AMAX, INFO )

           INTEGER         IA, INFO, JA, N

           REAL            AMAX, SCOND

           INTEGER         DESCA( * )

           REAL            A( * ), SC( * ), SR( * )

</pre><h4><b>PURPOSE</b></h4><pre>
       PSPOEQU  computes  row  and  column  scalings  intended  to  equilibrate a distributed symmetric positive
       definite matrix sub( A ) = A(IA:IA+N-1,JA:JA+N-1) and reduce its condition number (with  respect  to  the
       two-norm).  SR and SC contain the scale factors, S(i) = 1/sqrt(A(i,i)), chosen so that the scaled distri-
       buted  matrix B with elements B(i,j) = S(i)*A(i,j)*S(j) has ones on the  diagonal.  This choice of SR and
       SC puts the condition number of B within a factor N of the smallest possible condition  number  over  all
       possible diagonal scalings.

       The  scaling  factor are stored along process rows in SR and along process columns in SC. The duplication
       of information simplifies greatly the application of the factors.

       Notes
       =====

       Each global data object is described by  an  associated  description  vector.   This  vector  stores  the
       information required to establish the mapping between an object element and its corresponding process and
       memory location.

       Let  A  be  a  generic  term  for  any  2D  block cyclicly distributed array.  Such a global array has an
       associated description vector DESCA.  In the following comments, the character _ should be  read  as  "of
       the global array".

       NOTATION        STORED IN      EXPLANATION
       ---------------  -------------- -------------------------------------- DTYPE_A(global) DESCA( DTYPE_ )The
       descriptor type.  In this case,
                                      DTYPE_A = 1.
       CTXT_A (global) DESCA( CTXT_ ) The BLACS context handle, indicating
                                      the BLACS process grid A is distribu-
                                      ted over. The context itself is glo-
                                      bal, but the handle (the integer
                                      value) may vary.
       M_A    (global) DESCA( M_ )    The number of rows in the global
                                      array A.
       N_A    (global) DESCA( N_ )    The number of columns in the global
                                      array A.
       MB_A   (global) DESCA( MB_ )   The blocking factor used to distribute
                                      the rows of the array.
       NB_A   (global) DESCA( NB_ )   The blocking factor used to distribute
                                      the columns of the array.
       RSRC_A (global) DESCA( RSRC_ ) The process row over which the first
                                      row of the array A is distributed.  CSRC_A (global)  DESCA(  CSRC_  )  The
       process column over which the
                                      first column of the array A is
                                      distributed.
       LLD_A  (local)  DESCA( LLD_ )  The leading dimension of the local
                                      array.  LLD_A &gt;= MAX(1,LOCr(M_A)).

       Let  K  be  the  number  of rows or columns of a distributed matrix, and assume that its process grid has
       dimension p x q.
       LOCr( K ) denotes the number of elements of K that a process would receive if K were distributed over the
       p processes of its process column.
       Similarly, LOCc( K ) denotes the number of elements  of  K  that  a  process  would  receive  if  K  were
       distributed over the q processes of its process row.
       The values of LOCr() and LOCc() may be determined via a call to the ScaLAPACK tool function, NUMROC:
               LOCr( M ) = NUMROC( M, MB_A, MYROW, RSRC_A, NPROW ),
               LOCc(  N ) = NUMROC( N, NB_A, MYCOL, CSRC_A, NPCOL ).  An upper bound for these quantities may be
       computed by:
               LOCr( M ) &lt;= ceil( ceil(M/MB_A)/NPROW )*MB_A
               LOCc( N ) &lt;= ceil( ceil(N/NB_A)/NPCOL )*NB_A

</pre><h4><b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       N       (global input) INTEGER
               The number of rows and columns to be operated on i.e the order of the distributed submatrix  sub(
               A ). N &gt;= 0.

       A       (local input) REAL pointer into the local memory to an
               array  of  local  dimension  (  LLD_A,  LOCc(JA+N-1)  ),  the  N-by-N symmetric positive definite
               distributed matrix sub( A ) whose scaling factors are to be computed.  Only the diagonal elements
               of sub( A ) are referenced.

       IA      (global input) INTEGER
               The row index in the global array A indicating the first row of sub( A ).

       JA      (global input) INTEGER
               The column index in the global array A indicating the first column of sub( A ).

       DESCA   (global and local input) INTEGER array of dimension DLEN_.
               The array descriptor for the distributed matrix A.

       SR      (local output) REAL array, dimension LOCr(M_A)
               If INFO = 0, SR(IA:IA+N-1) contains the row scale factors for sub( A ). SR is  aligned  with  the
               distributed  matrix  A, and replicated across every process column. SR is tied to the distributed
               matrix A.

       SC      (local output) REAL array, dimension LOCc(N_A)
               If INFO = 0, SC(JA:JA+N-1) contains the column scale factors
               for A(IA:IA+M-1,JA:JA+N-1). SC is aligned with the distribu- ted matrix A,  and  replicated  down
               every process row. SC is tied to the distributed matrix A.

       SCOND   (global output) REAL
               If  INFO  = 0, SCOND contains the ratio of the smallest SR(i) (or SC(j)) to the largest SR(i) (or
               SC(j)), with IA &lt;= i &lt;= IA+N-1 and JA &lt;= j &lt;= JA+N-1. If SCOND &gt;= 0.1 and  AMAX  is  neither  too
               large nor too small, it is not worth scaling by SR (or SC).

       AMAX    (global output) REAL
               Absolute  value  of  largest  matrix element.  If AMAX is very close to overflow or very close to
               underflow, the matrix should be scaled.

       INFO    (global output) INTEGER
               = 0:  successful exit
               &lt; 0:  If the i-th argument is an array and  the  j-entry  had  an  illegal  value,  then  INFO  =
               -(i*100+j),  if the i-th argument is a scalar and had an illegal value, then INFO = -i.  &gt; 0:  If
               INFO = K, the K-th diagonal entry of sub( A ) is nonpositive.
