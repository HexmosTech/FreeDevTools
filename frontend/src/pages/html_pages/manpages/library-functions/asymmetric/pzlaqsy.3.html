       Notes
       =====

       Each  global  data  object  is  described  by  an  associated description vector.  This vector stores the
       information required to establish the mapping between an object element and its corresponding process and
       memory location.

       Let A be a generic term for any 2D block  cyclicly  distributed  array.   Such  a  global  array  has  an
       associated  description  vector  DESCA.  In the following comments, the character _ should be read as "of
       the global array".

       NOTATION        STORED IN      EXPLANATION
       --------------- -------------- -------------------------------------- DTYPE_A(global) DESCA( DTYPE_  )The
       descriptor type.  In this case,
                                      DTYPE_A = 1.
       CTXT_A (global) DESCA( CTXT_ ) The BLACS context handle, indicating
                                      the BLACS process grid A is distribu-
                                      ted over. The context itself is glo-
                                      bal, but the handle (the integer
                                      value) may vary.
       M_A    (global) DESCA( M_ )    The number of rows in the global
                                      array A.
       N_A    (global) DESCA( N_ )    The number of columns in the global
                                      array A.
       MB_A   (global) DESCA( MB_ )   The blocking factor used to distribute
                                      the rows of the array.
       NB_A   (global) DESCA( NB_ )   The blocking factor used to distribute
                                      the columns of the array.
       RSRC_A (global) DESCA( RSRC_ ) The process row over which the first
                                      row  of  the  array  A is distributed.  CSRC_A (global) DESCA( CSRC_ ) The
       process column over which the
                                      first column of the array A is
                                      distributed.
       LLD_A  (local)  DESCA( LLD_ )  The leading dimension of the local
                                      array.  LLD_A &gt;= MAX(1,LOCr(M_A)).

       Let K be the number of rows or columns of a distributed matrix, and assume  that  its  process  grid  has
       dimension p x q.
       LOCr( K ) denotes the number of elements of K that a process would receive if K were distributed over the
       p processes of its process column.
       Similarly,  LOCc(  K  )  denotes  the  number  of  elements  of  K that a process would receive if K were
       distributed over the q processes of its process row.
       The values of LOCr() and LOCc() may be determined via a call to the ScaLAPACK tool function, NUMROC:
               LOCr( M ) = NUMROC( M, MB_A, MYROW, RSRC_A, NPROW ),
               LOCc( N ) = NUMROC( N, NB_A, MYCOL, CSRC_A, NPCOL ).  An upper bound for these quantities may  be
       computed by:
               LOCr( M ) &lt;= ceil( ceil(M/MB_A)/NPROW )*MB_A
               LOCc( N ) &lt;= ceil( ceil(N/NB_A)/NPCOL )*NB_A

</pre><h4><b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       UPLO    (global input) CHARACTER
               Specifies whether the upper or lower triangular part of the symmetric distributed matrix sub( A )
               is to be referenced:
               = 'U':  Upper triangular
               = 'L':  Lower triangular

       N       (global input) INTEGER
               The  number  of  rows  and columns to be operated on, i.e. the order of the distributed submatrix
               sub( A ). N &gt;= 0.

       A       (input/output) COMPLEX*16 pointer into the local
               memory to an array of local dimension (LLD_A,LOCc(JA+N-1)).  On entry, the local  pieces  of  the
               distributed symmetric matrix sub( A ). If UPLO = 'U', the leading N-by-N upper triangular part of
               sub( A ) contains the upper triangular part of the matrix, and the strictly lower triangular part
               of sub( A ) is not referenced.  If UPLO = 'L', the leading N-by-N lower triangular part of sub( A
               )  contains  the lower triangular part of the matrix, and the strictly upper trian- gular part of
               sub( A ) is not referenced.  On exit, if EQUED = 'Y', the equilibrated matrix:
               diag(SR(IA:IA+N-1)) * sub( A ) * diag(SC(JA:JA+N-1)).

       IA      (global input) INTEGER
               The row index in the global array A indicating the first row of sub( A ).

       JA      (global input) INTEGER
               The column index in the global array A indicating the first column of sub( A ).

       DESCA   (global and local input) INTEGER array of dimension DLEN_.
               The array descriptor for the distributed matrix A.

       SR      (local input) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension LOCr(M_A)
               The scale factors for A(IA:IA+M-1,JA:JA+N-1). SR is aligned with the distributed  matrix  A,  and
               replicated across every process column. SR is tied to the distributed matrix A.

       SC      (local input) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension LOCc(N_A)
               The  scale  factors  for  sub( A ). SC is aligned with the dis- tributed matrix A, and replicated
               down every process row.  SC is tied to the distributed matrix A.

       SCOND   (global input) DOUBLE PRECISION
               Ratio of the smallest SR(i) (respectively SC(j)) to the largest SR(i) (respectively SC(j)),  with
               IA &lt;= i &lt;= IA+N-1 and JA &lt;= j &lt;= JA+N-1.

       AMAX    (global input) DOUBLE PRECISION
               Absolute value of the largest distributed submatrix entry.

       EQUED   (output) CHARACTER*1
               Specifies whether or not equilibration was done.  = 'N':  No equilibration.
               = 'Y':  Equilibration was done, i.e., sub( A ) has been re-
               placed by:
               diag(SR(IA:IA+N-1)) * sub( A ) * diag(SC(JA:JA+N-1)).

</pre><h4><b>PARAMETERS</b></h4><pre>
       THRESH  is  a  threshold value used to decide if scaling should be done based on the ratio of the scaling
       factors.  If SCOND &lt; THRESH, scaling is done.

       LARGE and SMALL are threshold values used to decide if scaling should be done based on the absolute  size
       of the largest matrix element.  If AMAX &gt; LARGE or AMAX &lt; SMALL, scaling is done.
