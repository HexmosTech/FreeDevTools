       <b>EVSCAL,</b> <b>complex*16</b> <b>CS1,</b> <b>complex*16</b> <b>SN1)</b>
       <b>ZLAESY</b> computes the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a 2-by-2 complex symmetric matrix.

       <b>Purpose:</b>

            ZLAESY computes the eigendecomposition of a 2-by-2 symmetric matrix
               ( ( A, B );( B, C ) )
            provided the norm of the matrix of eigenvectors is larger than
            some threshold value.

            RT1 is the eigenvalue of larger absolute value, and RT2 of
            smaller absolute value.  If the eigenvectors are computed, then
            on return ( CS1, SN1 ) is the unit eigenvector for RT1, hence

            [  CS1     SN1   ] . [ A  B ] . [ CS1    -SN1   ] = [ RT1  0  ]
            [ -SN1     CS1   ]   [ B  C ]   [ SN1     CS1   ]   [  0  RT2 ]

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>A</u>

                     A is COMPLEX*16
                     The ( 1, 1 ) element of input matrix.

           <u>B</u>

                     B is COMPLEX*16
                     The ( 1, 2 ) element of input matrix.  The ( 2, 1 ) element
                     is also given by B, since the 2-by-2 matrix is symmetric.

           <u>C</u>

                     C is COMPLEX*16
                     The ( 2, 2 ) element of input matrix.

                     RT1 is COMPLEX*16
                     The eigenvalue of larger modulus.

           <u>RT2</u>

                     RT2 is COMPLEX*16
                     The eigenvalue of smaller modulus.

                     to make it orthonormal.  If EVSCAL is zero, the eigenvectors
                     were not computed.  This means one of two things:  the 2-by-2
                     matrix could not be diagonalized, or the norm of the matrix
                     of eigenvectors before scaling was larger than the threshold
                     value THRESH (set below).

           <u>CS1</u>

                     CS1 is COMPLEX*16

           <u>SN1</u>

                     SN1 is COMPLEX*16
                     If EVSCAL .NE. 0,  ( CS1, SN1 ) is the unit right eigenvector
                     for RT1.

       <b>ZTGSY2</b> solves the generalized Sylvester equation (unblocked algorithm).

       <b>Purpose:</b>

            ZTGSY2 solves the generalized Sylvester equation

                        A * R - L * B = scale * C               (1)
                        D * R - L * E = scale * F

            using Level 1 and 2 BLAS, where R and L are unknown M-by-N matrices,
            (A, D), (B, E) and (C, F) are given matrix pairs of size M-by-M,
            N-by-N and M-by-N, respectively. A, B, D and E are upper triangular
            (i.e., (A,D) and (B,E) in generalized Schur form).

            The solution (R, L) overwrites (C, F). 0 &lt;= SCALE &lt;= 1 is an output
            scaling factor chosen to avoid overflow.

            In matrix notation solving equation (1) corresponds to solve
            Zx = scale * b, where Z is defined as

                   Z = [ kron(In, A)  -kron(B**H, Im) ]             (2)
                       [ kron(In, D)  -kron(E**H, Im) ],

            Ik is the identity matrix of size k and X**H is the conjuguate transpose of X.
            kron(X, Y) is the Kronecker product between the matrices X and Y.

            If TRANS = 'C', y in the conjugate transposed system Z**H*y = scale*b
            is solved for, which is equivalent to solve for R and L in

                        A**H * R  + D**H * L   = scale * C           (3)
                        R  * B**H + L  * E**H  = scale * -F

            This case is used to compute an estimate of Dif[(A, D), (B, E)] =
            = sigma_min(Z) using reverse communication with ZLACON.

            ZTGSY2 also (IJOB &gt;= 1) contributes to the computation in ZTGSYL
            of an upper bound on the separation between to matrix pairs. Then
            the input (A, D), (B, E) are sub-pencils of two matrix pairs in
            ZTGSYL.
