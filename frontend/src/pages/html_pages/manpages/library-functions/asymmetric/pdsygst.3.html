       PDSYGST - reduce a real symmetric-definite generalized eigenproblem to standard form

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       SUBROUTINE PDSYGST( IBTYPE, UPLO, N, A, IA, JA, DESCA, B, IB, JB, DESCB, SCALE, INFO )

           CHARACTER       UPLO

           INTEGER         IA, IB, IBTYPE, INFO, JA, JB, N

           DOUBLE          PRECISION SCALE

           INTEGER         DESCA( * ), DESCB( * )

           DOUBLE          PRECISION A( * ), B( * )

</pre><h4><b>PURPOSE</b></h4><pre>
       PDSYGST reduces a real symmetric-definite generalized eigenproblem to standard form.

       In  the following sub( A ) denotes A( IA:IA+N-1, JA:JA+N-1 ) and sub( B ) denotes B( IB:IB+N-1, JB:JB+N-1
       ).

       If IBTYPE = 1, the problem is sub(  A  )*x  =  lambda*sub(  B  )*x,  and  sub(  A  )  is  overwritten  by
       inv(U**T)*sub( A )*inv(U) or inv(L)*sub( A )*inv(L**T)

       If  IBTYPE = 2 or 3, the problem is sub( A )*sub( B )*x = lambda*x or sub( B )*sub( A )*x = lambda*x, and
       sub( A ) is overwritten by U*sub( A )*U**T or L**T*sub( A )*L.

       sub( B ) must have been previously factorized as U**T*U or L*L**T by PDPOTRF.

       Notes
       =====

       Each global data object is described by  an  associated  description  vector.   This  vector  stores  the
       information required to establish the mapping between an object element and its corresponding process and
       memory location.

       Let  A  be  a  generic  term  for  any  2D  block cyclicly distributed array.  Such a global array has an
       associated description vector DESCA.  In the following comments, the character _ should be  read  as  "of
       the global array".

       NOTATION        STORED IN      EXPLANATION
       ---------------  -------------- -------------------------------------- DTYPE_A(global) DESCA( DTYPE_ )The
       descriptor type.  In this case,
                                      DTYPE_A = 1.
       CTXT_A (global) DESCA( CTXT_ ) The BLACS context handle, indicating
                                      the BLACS process grid A is distribu-
                                      ted over. The context itself is glo-
                                      bal, but the handle (the integer
                                      value) may vary.
       M_A    (global) DESCA( M_ )    The number of rows in the global
                                      array A.
       N_A    (global) DESCA( N_ )    The number of columns in the global
                                      array A.
       MB_A   (global) DESCA( MB_ )   The blocking factor used to distribute
                                      the rows of the array.
       NB_A   (global) DESCA( NB_ )   The blocking factor used to distribute
                                      the columns of the array.
       RSRC_A (global) DESCA( RSRC_ ) The process row over which the first
                                      row of the array A is distributed.  CSRC_A (global)  DESCA(  CSRC_  )  The
       process column over which the
                                      first column of the array A is
                                      distributed.
       LLD_A  (local)  DESCA( LLD_ )  The leading dimension of the local
                                      array.  LLD_A &gt;= MAX(1,LOCr(M_A)).

       Let  K  be  the  number  of rows or columns of a distributed matrix, and assume that its process grid has
       dimension p x q.
       LOCr( K ) denotes the number of elements of K that a process would receive if K were distributed over the
       p processes of its process column.
       Similarly, LOCc( K ) denotes the number of elements  of  K  that  a  process  would  receive  if  K  were
       distributed over the q processes of its process row.
       The values of LOCr() and LOCc() may be determined via a call to the ScaLAPACK tool function, NUMROC:
               LOCr( M ) = NUMROC( M, MB_A, MYROW, RSRC_A, NPROW ),
               LOCc(  N ) = NUMROC( N, NB_A, MYCOL, CSRC_A, NPCOL ).  An upper bound for these quantities may be
       computed by:
               LOCr( M ) &lt;= ceil( ceil(M/MB_A)/NPROW )*MB_A
               LOCc( N ) &lt;= ceil( ceil(N/NB_A)/NPCOL )*NB_A

                )*U**T or L**T*sub( A )*L.

       UPLO    (global input) CHARACTER
               =  'U':   Upper  triangle of sub( A ) is stored and sub( B ) is factored as U**T*U; = 'L':  Lower
               triangle of sub( A ) is stored and sub( B ) is factored as L*L**T.

               local  pieces  of the N-by-N symmetric distributed matrix sub( A ). If UPLO = 'U', the leading N-
               by-N upper triangular part of sub( A ) contains the upper triangular part of the matrix, and  its
               strictly  lower  triangular  part  is  not  referenced.   If UPLO = 'L', the leading N-by-N lower
               triangular part of sub( A ) contains the lower triangular part of the matrix,  and  its  strictly
               upper triangular part is not referenced.

               routine.  At present, SCALE is always returned as 1.0, it is returned here to  allow  for  future
               enhancement.

               = 0:  successful exit
               &lt;  0:   If  the  i-th  argument  is  an  array  and the j-entry had an illegal value, then INFO =
               -(i*100+j), if the i-th argument is a scalar and had an illegal value, then INFO = -i.
