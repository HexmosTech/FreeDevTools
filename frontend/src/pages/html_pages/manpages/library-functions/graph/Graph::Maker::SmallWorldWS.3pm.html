</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Graph::Maker::SmallWorldWS - Creates a small-world graph according to (Newman) Watt and Strogatz

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       Version 0.01

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       Creates a small world graph according to (Newman and) Watt and Strogatz's model.  A small world graph has
       an approximate power law degree distribution and a high clustering coefficient.  If the graph is directed
       then edges are added in both directions to create an undirected graph.

               use strict;
               use warnings;
               use Graph;
               use Graph::Maker;
               use Graph::Maker::SmallWorldWS;

               my $g = new Graph::Maker('small_world_ws', N =&gt; 10, K =&gt; 2, PR =&gt; .1, undirected =&gt; 1);
               my $g2 = new Graph::Maker('small_world_ws', N =&gt; 10, K =&gt; 2, PR =&gt; .1, keep_edges =&gt; 1, undirected =&gt; 1);
               # work with the graph

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>new</b> <b>%params</b>
       Creates a small world graph with N nodes, K initial connections, and a probability of rewiring of PR
       according to Watts and Strogats.  The recognized parameters are N, K, PR, graph_maker, and keep_edges any
       others are passed onto Graph's constructor.  If N is not given it defaults to 0.  If K is not given it
       defaults to 0.  If PR is not given it defaults to 0.  keep_edges uses the Newman, Watts and Strogatz
       model where "rewiring" adds an edge between two random nodes, instead of removing and then adding.  If
       graph_maker is specified it will be called to create the Graph class as desired (for example if you have
       a subclass of Graph), this defaults to create a Graph with the parameters specified.
