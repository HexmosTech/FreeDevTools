</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       EZMY - Draws, in a manner determined by the current values of the control parameters, a complete graph of
       one or more curves, each defined by a set of points (I,YDRA(I,J)) (or (I,YDRA(J,I)), depending on the
       current value of 'ROW.'), for I from 1 to NPTS. The curve number J runs from 1 to MANY. The argument GLAB
       may be used to specify a "graph label", to be placed at the top of the graph.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       CALL EZMY (YDRA,IDXY,MANY,NPTS,GLAB)

</pre><h4><b>C-BINDING</b> <b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;ncarg/ncargC.h&gt;

       void c_ezmy (float *ydra, int idxy, int many, int npts, \
       char *glab)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       YDRA        (an  input  array  of  type  REAL,  dimensioned  IDXY x MANY or IDXY x NPTS, depending on the
                   current value of 'ROW.')  defines curve-point Y coordinates. The current value  of  'NULL/1.'
                   (default  value  "1.E36")  may  be  used  in YDRA to signal missing points; curve segments on
                   either side of a missing point are omitted.

                   •      If 'ROW.' is positive (the default), the first subscript of YDRA is a point number and
                          the second is a curve number.

                   •      If 'ROW.' is negative, the order of the subscripts is reversed ("row-wise", as opposed
                          to "column-wise", storage); the first subscript is a curve number and the second is  a
                          point number.

       IDXY        (an input expression of type INTEGER) defines the first dimension of the array YDRA, which is
                   required by EZMY in order to index the array properly.

                   •      If 'ROW.' is positive (the default), IDXY must be greater than or equal to NPTS.

                   •      If 'ROW.' is negative, IDXY must be greater than or equal to MANY.

       MANY        (an input expression of type INTEGER) is the number of curves to be drawn by EZMY.

       NPTS        (an input expression of type INTEGER) is the number of points defining each curve to be drawn
                   by EZMY.

       GLAB        (an  input expression of type CHARACTER) defines a new "graph label". (If the first character
                   of this expression is "<a href="../man0/CHAR.0.html">CHAR</a>(0)", no new "graph  label"  is  defined;  the  current  one  will
                   continue  to  be  used.)  A character string defining a new graph label must either be of the
                   exact length specified by the current value of 'LINE/MAXIMUM.' (default: 40  characters),  or
                   shorter;  if  shorter, it must be terminated by the character defined by the current value of
                   'LINE/END.' (default: a '$'). The string becomes the new text of line number 100 of the label
                   named 'T'.

</pre><h4><b>C-BINDING</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The C-binding argument description is the same as the FORTRAN argument description.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Use the ncargex command to see the following relevant examples: agex03, tagupw, tautog, fagezmy.

</pre><h4><b>ACCESS</b></h4><pre>
       To use EZMY or c_ezmy, load the NCAR Graphics libraries ncarg, ncarg_gks, and ncarg_c, preferably in that
       order.    To get smoother curves, drawn using spline interpolation, also load libdashsmth.o.  Or, you can
       use the ncargf77 command to compile your program and load the above  libraries,  then,  to  get  smoother
       curves, use the -dashsmth option.
