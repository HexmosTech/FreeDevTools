</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Graph::Reader::Dot - class for reading a Graph instance from Dot format

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Graph::Reader::Dot;
           use Graph;

           $reader = Graph::Reader::Dot-&gt;new();
           $graph = $reader-&gt;read_graph('mygraph.dot');

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Graph::Reader::Dot</b> is a class for reading in a directed graph in the file format used by the <u>dot</u> tool
       (part of the AT+T graphviz package).

       <b>Graph::Reader::Dot</b> is a subclass of <b>Graph::Reader</b>, which defines the generic interface for Graph reader
       classes.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
   <b>"new()"</b>
       Constructor - generate a new reader instance.

           $reader = Graph::Reader::Dot-&gt;new();

       This doesn't take any arguments.

   <b>"read_graph()"</b>
       Read a graph from a file:

           $graph = $reader-&gt;read_graph( $file );

       The $file argument can be either a filename or a filehandle of a previously opened file.

   <b>$Graph::Reader::Dot::UseNodeAttr</b>
       Controls, if implicit node attributes given by the dot directive "node[]" will be merged into (new)
       nodes.  Setting it to 0 or "undef" (default) will not disable this feature.  Setting it to any other
       value will enable this feature.

   <b>$Graph::Reader::Dot::UseEdgeAttr</b>
       Controls, if implicit edge attributes given by the dot directive "edge[]" will be merged into edges.
       Setting it to 0 or "undef" (default) will not disable this feature.  Setting it to any other value will
       enable this feature.

</pre><h4><b>RESTRICTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       •   Default (graph) attributes in subgraphs (i.e. inside "{}") are not processed.

       •   Sub nodes as used by dot's "record" node shape are supported.

       •   Undirected  graphs  will be treated as directed graphs.  This means that the "--" edge operator works
           as the "-&gt;" edge operator.

       •   Be aware that you are loosing scope information on writing back the graph.

       •   Multiple "node[]" or "edge[]" statements in the same scope are not correctly supported.

       Graph::Reader
           The base class for <b>Graph::Reader::Dot</b>.

       Graph::Writer::Dot
           Used to serialise a Graph instance in Dot format.

       Graph
           Jarkko Hietaniemi's classes for representing directed graphs.

       Parse::Yapp
           Another base class for <b>Graph::Reader::Dot</b>.  The <b>Parse::Yapp</b> module comes with the following copyright
