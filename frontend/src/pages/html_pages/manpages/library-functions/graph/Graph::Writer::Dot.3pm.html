</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Graph::Writer::Dot - write out directed graph in Dot format

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Graph;
         use Graph::Writer::Dot;

         $graph = Graph-&gt;new();
         # add edges and nodes to the graph

         $writer = Graph::Writer::Dot-&gt;new();
         $writer-&gt;write_graph($graph, 'mygraph.dot');

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Graph::Writer::Dot</b> is a class for writing out a directed graph in the file format used by the <u>dot</u> tool
       (part of the AT+T graphviz package).  The graph must be an instance of the Graph class, which is actually
       a set of classes developed by Jarkko Hietaniemi.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>new()</b>
       Constructor - generate a new writer instance.

         $writer = Graph::Writer::Dot-&gt;new();

       This can take one optional argument that tell to cluster nodes in subgraphs by using the attribute passed
       as value. See:

         $writer = Graph::Writer::Dot-&gt;new(cluster =&gt; 'group');

       It will group nodes that have the the same value in the 'group' attribute.

   <b>write_graph()</b>
       Write a specific graph to a named file:

         $writer-&gt;write_graph($graph, $file);

       The $file argument can either be a filename, or a filehandle for a previously opened file.
