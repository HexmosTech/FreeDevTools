                            '5' =&gt; 1
                           },
                    '5' =&gt; undef
                   };

         # create the object;
         my $graph = Bio::Coordinate::Graph-&gt;new(-graph =&gt; $hash);

         # find the shortest path between two nodes
         my $a = 1;
         my $b = 6;
         my @path = $graph-&gt;shortest_paths($a);
         print join (", ", @path), "\n";

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This class calculates the shortest path between input and output coordinate systems in a graph that
       defines the relationships between them. This class is primarely designed to analyze gene-related
       coordinate systems. See Bio::Coordinate::GeneMapper.

       Note that this module can not be used to manage graphs.

       Technically the graph implemented here is known as Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). DAG is composed of
       vertices (nodes) and edges (with optional weights) linking them. Nodes of the graph are the coordinate
       systems in gene mapper.

       The shortest path is found using the Dijkstra's algorithm. This algorithm is fast and greedy and requires
       all weights to be positive. All weights in the gene coordinate system graph are currently equal (1)
       making the graph unweighted. That makes the use of Dijkstra's algorithm an overkill. A simpler and faster
       breadth-first would be enough. Luckily the difference for small graphs is not significant and the
       implementation is capable of taking weights into account if needed at some later time.

   <b>Input</b> <b>format</b>
       The graph needs to be primed using a hash of hashes where there is a key for each node. The second keys
       are the names of the downstream neighboring nodes and values are the weights for reaching them. Here is
       part of the gene coordiante system graph:

           $hash = {
                    '6' =&gt; undef,
                    '3' =&gt; {
                            '6' =&gt; 1
                           },
                    '2' =&gt; {
                            '6' =&gt; 1,
                            '4' =&gt; 1,
                            '3' =&gt; 1
                           },
                    '1' =&gt; {
                            '2' =&gt; 1
                           },
                    '4' =&gt; {
                            '5' =&gt; 1
                           },
                    '5' =&gt; undef
                   };

       Note that the names need to be positive integers. Root should be '1' and directness of the graph is taken
       advantage of to speed calculations by assuming that downsream nodes always have larger number as name.

       An alternative (shorter) way of describing input is to use hash of arrays. See
       Bio::Coordinate::Graph::hash_of_arrays.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>new</b>
   <b>graph</b>
        Title   : graph
        Usage   : $obj-&gt;graph($my_graph)
        Function: Read/write method for the graph structure
        Example :
        Returns : hash of hashes grah structure
        Args    : reference to a hash of hashes

   <b>hash_of_arrays</b>
        Title   : hash_of_arrays
        Usage   : $obj-&gt;hash_of_array(%hasharray)
        Function: An alternative method to read in the graph structure.
                  Hash arrays are easier to type. This method converts
                  arrays into hashes and assigns equal values "1" to
                  weights.

        Example : Here is an example of simple structure containing a graph.

                  my $DAG = {
                             6  =&gt; [],
                             5  =&gt; [],
                             4  =&gt; [5],
                             3  =&gt; [6],
                             2  =&gt; [3, 4, 6],
                             1  =&gt; [2]
                            };

        Returns : hash of hashes graph structure
        Args    : reference to a hash of arrays

   <b>shortest_path</b>
        Title   : shortest_path
        Usage   : $obj-&gt;shortest_path($a, $b);
        Function: Method for retrieving the shortest path between nodes.
                  If the start node remains the same, the method is sometimes
                  able to use cached results, otherwise it will recalculate
                  the paths.
        Example :
        Returns : array of node names, only the start node name if no path
        Args    : name of the start node
                : name of the end node

   <b>dijkstra</b>
        Title   : dijkstra
        Usage   : $graph-&gt;<a href="../man1/dijkstra.1.html">dijkstra</a>(1);
        Function: Implements Dijkstra's algorithm.
                  Returns or sets a list of mappers. The returned path
                  description is always directed down from the root.
                  Called from shortest_path().
        Example :
        Returns : Reference to a hash of hashes representing a linked list
                  which contains shortest path down to all nodes from the start
                  node. E.g.:

                   $res = {
                             '2' =&gt; {
                                      'prev' =&gt; '1',
                                      'dist' =&gt; 1
                                    },
                             '1' =&gt; {
                                      'prev' =&gt; undef,
                                      'dist' =&gt; 0
                                    },
                           };

        Args    : name of the start node
