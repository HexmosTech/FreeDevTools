</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Graph::Easy::Parser::Graphviz - Parse Graphviz text into Graph::Easy

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
               # creating a graph from a textual description

               use Graph::Easy::Parser::Graphviz;
               my $parser = Graph::Easy::Parser::Graphviz-&gt;new();

               my $graph = $parser-&gt;from_text(
                       "digraph MyGraph { \n" .
                       "       Bonn -&gt; \"Berlin\" \n }"
               );
               print $graph-&gt;as_ascii();

               print $parser-&gt;from_file('mygraph.dot')-&gt;as_ascii();

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       "Graph::Easy::Parser::Graphviz" parses the text format from the DOT language use by Graphviz and
       constructs a "Graph::Easy" object from it.

       The resulting object can than be used to layout and output the graph in various formats.

       Please see the Graphviz manual for a full description of the syntax rules of the DOT language.

   <b>Output</b>
       The output will be a Graph::Easy object (unless overridden with "use_class()"), see the documentation for
       Graph::Easy what you can do with it.

   <b>Attributes</b>
       Attributes will be remapped to the proper Graph::Easy attribute names and values, as much as possible.

       Anything else will be converted to custom attributes starting with "x-dot-".  So "ranksep: 2" will become
       "x-dot-ranksep: 2".

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       "Graph::Easy::Parser::Graphviz" supports the same methods as its parent class "Graph::Easy::Parser":

   <b>new()</b>
               use Graph::Easy::Parser::Graphviz;
               my $parser = Graph::Easy::Parser::Graphviz-&gt;new();

       Creates a new parser object. There are two valid parameters:

               debug
               fatal_errors

       Both take either a false or a true value.

               my $parser = Graph::Easy::Parser::Graphviz-&gt;new( debug =&gt; 1 );
               $parser-&gt;from_text('digraph G { A -&gt; B }');

   <b>reset()</b>
               $parser-&gt;reset();

       Reset the status of the parser, clear errors etc. Automatically called when you call any of the
       "from_XXX()" methods below.

   <b>use_class()</b>
               $parser-&gt;use_class('node', 'Graph::Easy::MyNode');

       Override the class to be used to constructs objects while parsing.

       See Graph::Easy::Parser for further information.

   <b>from_text()</b>
               my $graph = $parser-&gt;from_text( $text );

       Create a Graph::Easy object from the textual description in $text.

       Returns undef for error, you can find out what the error was with <b>error()</b>.

       This method will reset any previous error, and thus the $parser object can be re-used to parse different
       texts by just calling "from_text()" multiple times.

   <b>from_file()</b>
               my $graph = $parser-&gt;from_file( $filename );
               my $graph = Graph::Easy::Parser-&gt;from_file( $filename );

       Creates a Graph::Easy object from the textual description in the file $filename.

       The second calling style will create a temporary parser object, parse the file and return the resulting
       "Graph::Easy" object.

       Returns undef for error, you can find out what the error was with <b>error()</b> when using the first calling
       style.

   <b>error()</b>
               my $error = $parser-&gt;error();

       Returns the last error, or the empty string if no error occurred.

   <b>parse_error()</b>
               $parser-&gt;parse_error( $msg_nr, @params);

       Sets an error message from a message number and replaces embedded templates like "##param1##" with the
       passed parameters.

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
       The parser has problems with the following things:

       encoding and charset attribute
                   The parser assumes the input to be "utf-8". Input files in &lt;code&gt;Latin1&lt;/code&gt; are not parsed
                   properly, even when they have the charset attribute set.

       shape=record
                   Nodes  with  shape  record  are  only  parsed properly when the label does not contain groups
                   delimited by "{" and "}", so the following is parsed wrongly:

                           node1 [ shape=record, label="A|{B|C}" ]

       default shape
                   The default shape for a node is 'rect', opposed to 'circle' as dot renders nodes.

       attributes  Some  attributes  are  <b>not</b>  remapped  properly  to  what  Graph::Easy  expects,  thus  losing
                   information,  either  because  Graph::Easy  doesn't  support this feature yet, or because the
                   mapping is incomplete.

                   Some attributes meant only for nodes or edges etc. might  be  incorrectly  applied  to  other
                   objects, resulting in unnec. warnings while parsing.

                   Attributes  not valid in the original DOT language are silently ignored by dot, but result in
                   a warning when parsing under Graph::Easy. This helps catching all these  pesky  misspellings,
                   but it's not yet possible to disable these warnings.

       comments    Comments written in the source code itself are discarded. If you want to have comments on the
                   graph,  clusters,  nodes  or edges, use the attribute "comment".  These are correctly read in
                   and stored, and then output into the different formats, too.
