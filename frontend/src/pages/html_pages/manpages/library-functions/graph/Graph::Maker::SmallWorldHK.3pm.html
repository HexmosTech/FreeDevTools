</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Graph::Maker::SmallWorldHK - Creates a small world graph according to Holmea, Beom &amp; Kim

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       Version 0.01

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       Creates a small world graph according to Holmea, Beom &amp; Kim's model.  A small world graph has an
       approximate power law degree distribution and a high clustering coefficient.  Holmea, Beom &amp; Kim's can be
       seen as a super-set of th BA model as it also allows a "triangle formation" phase to increase the
       clustering coefficient.  If the graph is directed then edges are added in both directions to create an
       undirected graph.

               use strict;
               use warnings;
               use Graph;
               use Graph::Maker;
               use Graph::Maker::SmallWorldHK;

               my $g = new Graph::Maker('small_world_hk', N =&gt; 10, M =&gt; 2, M_0 =&gt; 1, PR =&gt; 0, undirected =&gt; 1); # BA's model
               my $g2 = new Graph::Maker('small_world_hk', N =&gt; 10, M =&gt; 2, M_0 =&gt; 1, PR =&gt; 0.25, undirected =&gt; 1);
               # work with the graph

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>new</b> <b>%params</b>
       Creates a small world graph with N nodes, initially starting with M_0 nodes and adding M (the minimum
       number of edges per node) on each step probalistically doing a triangle formation with probability PR
       according to the Holmes, Beom &amp; Kim model.  The recognized parameters are N, M, M_0, PR, graph_maker, and
       callback any others are passed onto Graph's constructor.  If N is not given it defaults to 0.  If M is
       not given it defaults to 1.  If M_0 is not given it defaults to M.  If PR is not given it defaults to 0.
       callback allows one to simulate the growth of a preferential attachment network, callback will be called
       each time a node is added.  If graph_maker is specified it will be called to create the Graph class as
       desired (for example if you have a subclass of Graph), this defaults to create a Graph with the
       parameters specified.
