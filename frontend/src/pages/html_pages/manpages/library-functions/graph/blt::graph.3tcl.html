</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       graph -  2D graph for plotting X-Y coordinate data.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>graph</b> <u>pathName</u> ?<u>option</u> <u>value</u>?...
_________________________________________________________________

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>graph</b>  command  creates  a  graph  for  plotting two-dimensional data (X-Y coordinates). It has many
       configurable components: coordinate axes, elements, legend, grid lines, cross hairs, etc.  They allow you
       to customize the look and feel of the graph.

</pre><h4><b>INTRODUCTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>graph</b> command creates a new window for plotting two-dimensional data (X-Y coordinates).  Data  points
       are  plotted in a rectangular area displayed in the center of the new window.  This is the <u>plotting</u> <u>area</u>.
       The coordinate axes are drawn in the margins around  the  plotting  area.   By  default,  the  legend  is
       displayed in the right margin.  The title is displayed in top margin.

       The  <b>graph</b>  widget is composed of several components: coordinate axes, data elements, legend, grid, cross
       hairs, pens, postscript, and annotation markers.

       <b>axis</b>      The graph has four standard axes (<b>x</b>, <b>x2</b>, <b>y</b>, and <b>y2</b>), but you can create and display any  number
                 of  axes.   Axes control what region of data is displayed and how the data is scaled. Each axis
                 consists of the axis line, title, major and minor ticks, and tick labels.  Tick labels  display
                 the value at each major tick.

       <b>crosshairs</b>
                 Cross hairs are used to position the mouse pointer relative to the X and Y coordinate axes. Two
                 perpendicular  lines,  intersecting  at  the  current  location of the mouse, extend across the
                 plotting area to the coordinate axes.

       <b>element</b>   An element represents a set of data points. Elements can be plotted with a symbol at each  data
                 point and lines connecting the points.  The appearance of the element, such as its symbol, line
                 width, and color is configurable.

       <b>grid</b>      Extends the major and minor ticks of the X-axis and/or Y-axis across the plotting area.

       <b>legend</b>    The  legend  displays the name and symbol of each data element.  The legend can be drawn in any
                 margin or in the plotting area.

       <b>marker</b>    Markers are used annotate or highlight areas of the graph. For example, you could use a polygon
                 marker to fill an area under a curve, or a text  marker  to  label  a  particular  data  point.
                 Markers  come  in  various  forms:  text  strings,  bitmaps,  connected  line segments, images,
                 polygons, or embedded widgets.

       <b>pen</b>       Pens define attributes (both symbol and line style) for elements.  Data elements  use  pens  to
                 specify  how  they  should  be  drawn.   A  data  element may use many pens at once.  Here, the
                 particular pen used for a data point is determined from each element's weight vector  (see  the
                 element's <b>-weight</b> and <b>-style</b> options).

       <b>postscript</b>
                 The  widget  can generate encapsulated PostScript output. This component has several options to
                 configure how the PostScript is generated.

</pre><h4><b>SYNTAX</b></h4><pre>
       <b>graph</b> <u>pathName</u> ?<u>option</u> <u>value</u>?...  The <b>graph</b> command creates a new window <u>pathName</u> and  makes  it  into  a
       <b>graph</b>  widget.   At  the  time this command is invoked, there must not exist a window named <u>pathName</u>, but
       <u>pathName</u>'s parent must exist.  Additional options may be specified on the command line or in  the  option
       database  to  configure  aspects  of  the graph such as its colors and font.  See the <b>configure</b> operation
       below for the exact details about what <u>option</u> and <u>value</u> pairs are valid.

       If successful, <b>graph</b> returns the path name of the widget.  It also creates a new Tcl command by the  same
       name.  You can use this command to invoke various operations that query or modify the graph.  The general
       form  is:  <u>pathName</u>  <u>operation</u> ?<u>arg</u>?...  Both <u>operation</u> and its arguments determine the exact behavior of
       the command.  The operations available for the graph are described in the <b>GRAPH</b> <b>OPERATIONS</b> section.

       The command can also be used to access components of the graph.  <u>pathName</u>  <u>component</u>  <u>operation</u>  ?<u>arg</u>?...
       The  operation,  now  located  after  the  name of the component, is the function to be performed on that
       component. Each component has its own set of operations that manipulate that  component.   They  will  be
       described below in their own sections.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>graph</b> command creates a new graph.

              # Create a new graph.  Plotting area is black.
              graph .g -plotbackground black

       A  new  Tcl  command  <b>.g</b>  is  also created.  This command can be used to query and modify the graph.  For
       example, to change the title of the graph to "My Plot", you use the new command and the graph's <b>configure</b>
       operation.

              # Change the title.
              .g configure -title "My Plot"

       A graph has several components. To access a particular  component  you  use  the  component's  name.  For
       example, to add data elements, you use the new command and the <b>element</b> component.

              # Create a new element named "line1"
              .g element create line1 \
                -xdata { 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2.0 } \
                -ydata { 26.18 50.46 72.85 93.31 111.86 128.47 143.14
                   155.85 166.60 175.38 }

       The  element's  X-Y  coordinates are specified using lists of numbers.  Alternately, BLT vectors could be
       used to hold the X-Y coordinates.

              # Create two vectors and add them to the graph.
              vector xVec yVec
              xVec set { 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2.0 }
              yVec set { 26.18 50.46 72.85 93.31 111.86 128.47 143.14 155.85
                166.60 175.38 }
              .g element create line1 -xdata xVec -ydata yVec

       The advantage of using vectors is that when you modify one, the graph is automatically redrawn to reflect
       the new values.

              # Change the y coordinate of the first point.
              set <a href="../man0/yVector.0.html">yVector</a>(0) 25.18

       An element named <b>e1</b> is now created in <b>.b</b>.  It is automatically added to the  display  list  of  elements.
       You  can  use  this  list to control in what order elements are displayed.  To query or reset the element
       display list, you use the element's <b>show</b> operation.

              # Get the current display list
              set elemList [.b element show]
              # Remove the first element so it won't be displayed.
              .b element show [lrange $elemList 0 end]

       The element will be displayed by as many bars as there are data points (in this case there are ten).  The
       bars will be drawn centered at the x-coordinate of the data point.  All  the  bars  will  have  the  same
       attributes  (colors,  stipple,  etc).  The width of each bar is by default one unit.  You can change this
       with using the <b>-barwidth</b> option.

              # Change the X-Y coordinates of the first point.
              set <a href="../man0/xVec.0.html">xVec</a>(0) 0.18
              set <a href="../man0/yVec.0.html">yVec</a>(0) 25.18

       An element named <b>line1</b> is now created in <b>.g</b>.  By default, the element's label in the legend will be  also
       <b>line1</b>.   You  can  change  the  label,  or  specify  no legend entry, again using the element's <b>configure</b>
       operation.

              # Don't display "line1" in the legend.
              .g element configure line1 -label ""

       You can configure more than just the element's label.  An element has many attributes such as symbol type
       and size, dashed or solid lines, colors, line width, etc.

              .g element configure line1 -symbol square -color red \
                -dashes { 2 4 2 } -linewidth 2 -pixels 2c

       Four coordinate axes are automatically created: <b>x</b>, <b>x2</b>, <b>y</b>, and <b>y2</b>.  And by default,  elements  are  mapped
       onto the axes <b>x</b> and <b>y</b>.  This can be changed with the <b>-mapx</b> and <b>-mapy</b> options.

              # Map "line1" on the alternate Y-axis "y2".
              .g element configure line1 -mapy y2

       Axes  can be configured in many ways too.  For example, you change the scale of the Y-axis from linear to
       log using the <b>axis</b> component.

              # Y-axis is log scale.
              .g axis configure y -logscale yes

       One important way axes are used is to zoom in on a particular data region.  Zooming  is  done  by  simply
       specifying new axis limits using the <b>-min</b> and <b>-max</b> configuration options.

              .g axis configure x -min 1.0 -max 1.5
              .g axis configure y -min 12.0 -max 55.15

       To  zoom  interactively,  you  link  the  <b>axis</b>  <b>configure</b>  operations with some user interaction (such as
       pressing the mouse button), using the <b>bind</b> command.  To convert between screen and graph coordinates, use
       the <b>invtransform</b> operation.

              # Click the button to set a new minimum
              bind .g &lt;ButtonPress-1&gt; {
                  %W axis configure x -min [%W axis invtransform x %x]
                  %W axis configure x -min [%W axis invtransform x %y]
              }

       By default, the limits of the axis are determined from data values.  To reset back to the default limits,
       set the <b>-min</b> and <b>-max</b> options to the empty value.

              # Reset the axes to autoscale again.
              .g axis configure x -min {} -max {}
              .g axis configure y -min {} -max {}

       By default, the legend is drawn in the right margin.  You can change this  or  any  legend  configuration
       options using the <b>legend</b> component.

              # Configure the legend font, color, and relief
              .g legend configure -position left -relief raised \
                -font fixed -fg blue

       To prevent the legend from being displayed, turn on the <b>-hide</b> option.

              # Don't display the legend.
              .g legend configure -hide yes

       The <b>graph</b> widget has simple drawing procedures called markers.  They can be used to highlight or annotate
       data  in  the  graph.  The  types  of markers available are bitmaps, images, polygons, lines, or windows.
       Markers can be used, for example, to mark or brush points.  In this example, is a text marker that labels
       the data first point.  Markers are created using the <b>marker</b> component.

              # Create a label for the first data point of "line1".
              .g marker create text -name first_marker -coords { 0.2 26.18 } \
                -text "start" -anchor se -xoffset -10 -yoffset -10

       This creates a text marker named <b>first_marker</b>.  It will display the text "start" near the coordinates  of
       the  first  data point.  The <b>-anchor</b>, <b>-xoffset</b>, and <b>-yoffset</b> options are used to display the marker above
       and to the left of the data point, so that the data point isn't  covered  by  the  marker.   By  default,
       markers are drawn last, on top of data.  You can change this with the <b>-under</b> option.

              # Draw the label before elements are drawn.
              .g marker configure first_marker -under yes

       You can add cross hairs or grid lines using the <b>crosshairs</b> and <b>grid</b> components.

              # Display both cross hairs and grid lines.
              .g crosshairs configure -hide no -color red
              .g grid configure -hide no -dashes { 2 2 }
              # Set up a binding to reposition the crosshairs.
              bind .g &lt;Motion&gt; {
                  .g crosshairs configure -position @%x,%y
              }

       The  crosshairs are repositioned as the mouse pointer is moved in the graph.  The pointer X-Y coordinates
       define the center of the crosshairs.

       Finally, to get hardcopy of the graph, use the <b>postscript</b> component.

              # Print the graph into file "file.ps"
              .g postscript output file.ps -maxpect yes -decorations no

       This generates a file <b>file.ps</b> containing the encapsulated PostScript of the graph.  The  option  <b>-maxpect</b>
       says  to  scale  the  plot  to the size of the page.  Turning off the <b>-decorations</b> option denotes that no
       borders or color backgrounds should be drawn (i.e. the background of the margins,  legend,  and  plotting
       area will be white).

</pre><h4><b>GRAPH</b> <b>OPERATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>pathName</u> <b>axis</b> <u>operation</u> ?<u>arg</u>?...
              See the <b>AXIS</b> <b>COMPONENTS</b> section.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>bar</b> <u>elemName</u> ?<u>option</u> <u>value</u>?...
              Creates  a  new  barchart  element <u>elemName</u>.  It's an error if an element <u>elemName</u> already exists.
              See the manual for <b>barchart</b> for details about what <u>option</u> and <u>value</u> pairs are valid.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>cget</b> <u>option</u>
              Returns the current value of the configuration option given by <u>option</u>.  <u>Option</u> may be  any  option
              described below for the <b>configure</b> operation.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>configure</b> ?<u>option</u> <u>value</u>?...
              Queries  or  modifies  the  configuration options of the graph.  If <u>option</u> isn't specified, a list
              describing the current options for <u>pathName</u> is returned.  If <u>option</u> is specified, but  not  <u>value</u>,
              then  a  list describing <u>option</u> is returned.  If one or more <u>option</u> and <u>value</u> pairs are specified,
              then for each pair, the option <u>option</u> is set to <u>value</u>.  The following options are valid.

              <b>-aspect</b> <u>width/height</u>
                     Force a fixed aspect ratio of <u>width/height</u>, a floating point number.

              <b>-background</b> <u>color</u>
                     Sets the background color. This includes the margins and legend, but not the plotting area.

              <b>-borderwidth</b> <u>pixels</u>
                     Sets the width of the 3-D border around the outside edge of the widget.  The <b>-relief</b> option
                     determines if the border is to be drawn.  The default is <b>2</b>.

              <b>-bottommargin</b> <u>pixels</u>
                     If non-zero, overrides the computed size of the margin  extending  below  the  X-coordinate
                     axis.  If <u>pixels</u> is <b>0</b>, the automatically computed size is used.  The default is <b>0</b>.

              <b>-bufferelements</b> <u>boolean</u>
                     Indicates whether an internal pixmap to buffer the display of data elements should be used.
                     If  <u>boolean</u>  is  true,  data  elements  are  drawn  to  an internal pixmap.  This option is
                     especially useful when the graph is redrawn frequently while  the  remains  data  unchanged
                     (for  example,  moving a marker across the plot).  See the <b>SPEED</b> <b>TIPS</b> section.  The default
                     is <b>1</b>.

              <b>-cursor</b> <u>cursor</u>
                     Specifies the widget's cursor.  The default cursor is <b>crosshair</b>.

              <b>-font</b> <u>fontName</u>
                     Specifies the font of the graph title. The default is <b>*-Helvetica-Bold-R-Normal-*-18-180-*</b>.

              <b>-halo</b> <u>pixels</u>
                     Specifies a maximum distance to consider when searching for the closest data point (see the
                     element's <b>closest</b> operation below).  Data points further than <u>pixels</u> away are ignored.  The
                     default is <b>0.5i</b>.

              <b>-height</b> <u>pixels</u>
                     Specifies the requested height of widget.  The default is <b>4i</b>.

              <b>-invertxy</b> <u>boolean</u>
                     Indicates whether the placement X-axis and Y-axis should be inverted.  If <u>boolean</u> is  true,
                     the X and Y axes are swapped.  The default is <b>0</b>.

              <b>-justify</b> <u>justify</u>
                     Specifies  how  the  title  should be justified.  This matters only when the title contains
                     more than one line of text. <u>Justify</u> must be <b>left</b>, <b>right</b>, or <b>center</b>.  The default is <b>center</b>.

              <b>-leftmargin</b> <u>pixels</u>
                     If non-zero, overrides the computed size of the margin extending from the left edge of  the
                     window  to the Y-coordinate axis.  If <u>pixels</u> is <b>0</b>, the automatically computed size is used.
                     The default is <b>0</b>.

              <b>-plotbackground</b> <u>color</u>
                     Specifies the background color of the plotting area.  The default is <b>white</b>.

              <b>-plotborderwidth</b> <u>pixels</u>
                     Sets the width of the  3-D  border  around  the  plotting  area.   The  <b>-plotrelief</b>  option
                     determines if a border is drawn.  The default is <b>2</b>.

              <b>-plotpadx</b> <u>pad</u>
                     Sets  the  amount  of padding to be added to the left and right sides of the plotting area.
                     <u>Pad</u> can be a list of one or two screen distances.  If <u>pad</u> has two elements, the  left  side
                     of  the  plotting  area  entry  is  padded  by the first distance and the right side by the
                     second.  If <u>pad</u> is just one distance, both the left and right sides are padded evenly.  The
                     default is <b>8</b>.

              <b>-plotpady</b> <u>pad</u>
                     Sets the amount of padding to be added to the top and bottom of the plotting area.  <u>Pad</u> can
                     be a list of one or two screen distances.  If <u>pad</u> has two elements, the top of the plotting
                     area is padded by the first distance and the bottom by the second.   If  <u>pad</u>  is  just  one
                     distance, both the top and bottom are padded evenly.  The default is <b>8</b>.

              <b>-plotrelief</b> <u>relief</u>
                     Specifies  the  3-D effect for the plotting area.  <u>Relief</u> specifies how the interior of the
                     plotting area should appear relative to rest of the graph; for example,  <b>raised</b>  means  the
                     plot  should  appear to protrude from the graph, relative to the surface of the graph.  The
                     default is <b>sunken</b>.

              <b>-relief</b> <u>relief</u>
                     Specifies the 3-D effect for the graph widget.   <u>Relief</u>  specifies  how  the  graph  should
                     appear  relative  to  widget  it is packed into; for example, <b>raised</b> means the graph should
                     appear to protrude.  The default is <b>flat</b>.

              <b>-rightmargin</b> <u>pixels</u>
                     If non-zero, overrides the computed size of the margin extending from the plotting area  to
                     the right edge of the window. By default, the legend is drawn in this margin.  If <u>pixels</u> is
                     <b>0</b>, the automatically computed size is used.  The default is <b>0</b>.

              <b>-takefocus</b> <u>focus</u>
                     Provides  information  used  when  moving  the  focus  from  window  to window via keyboard
                     traversal (e.g., Tab and Shift-Tab).  If <u>focus</u> is <b>0</b>, this means that this window should  be
                     skipped  entirely  during  keyboard  traversal.  <b>1</b> means that the this window should always
                     receive the input focus.  An empty value means that the traversal scripts make the decision
                     whether to focus on the window.  The default is <b>""</b>.

              <b>-tile</b> <u>image</u>
                     Specifies a tiled background for the widget.  If <u>image</u> isn't <b>""</b>, the  background  is  tiled
                     using <u>image</u>.  Otherwise, the normal background color is drawn (see the <b>-background</b> option).
                     <u>Image</u> must be an image created using the Tk <b>image</b> command.  The default is <b>""</b>.

              <b>-title</b> <u>text</u>
                     Sets the title to <u>text</u>. If <u>text</u> is <b>""</b>, no title will be displayed.

              <b>-topmargin</b> <u>pixels</u>
                     If  non-zero, overrides the computed size of the margin above the x2 axis.  If <u>pixels</u> is <b>0</b>,
                     the automatically computed size is used.  The default is <b>0</b>.

              <b>-width</b> <u>pixels</u>
                     Specifies the requested width of the widget.  The default is <b>5i</b>.

</pre><h4><b>GRAPH</b> <b>COMPONENTS</b></h4><pre>
       A  graph  is  composed  of several components: coordinate axes, data elements, legend, grid, cross hairs,
       postscript, and annotation markers. Instead of one big set of configuration options and  operations,  the
       graph  is  partitioned,  where  each  component  has  its  own  configuration options and operations that
       specifically control that aspect or part of the graph.

   <b>AXIS</b> <b>COMPONENTS</b>
       Four coordinate axes are automatically created: two X-coordinate axes (<b>x</b> and  <b>x2</b>)  and  two  Y-coordinate
       axes  (<b>y</b>,  and  <b>y2</b>).  By default, the axis <b>x</b> is located in the bottom margin, <b>y</b> in the left margin, <b>x2</b> in
       the top margin, and <b>y2</b> in the right margin.

       An axis consists of the axis line, title, major and minor ticks, and tick labels.  Major ticks are  drawn
       at  uniform  intervals  along the axis.  Each tick is labeled with its coordinate value.  Minor ticks are
       drawn at uniform intervals within major ticks.

       The range of the axis controls what region of data is plotted.   Data  points  outside  the  minimum  and
       maximum  limits  of  the axis are not plotted.  By default, the minimum and maximum limits are determined
       from the data, but you can reset either limit.

       You can have several axes. To create an axis, invoke the axis component and its create operation.

              # Create a new axis called "tempAxis"
              .g axis create tempAxis

       You map data elements to an axis using the element's -mapy and -mapx configuration options. They  specify
       the coordinate axes an element is mapped onto.

              # Now map the tempAxis data to this axis.
              .g element create "e1" -xdata $x -ydata $y -mapy tempAxis

       Any  number  of  axes  can  be  displayed  simultaneously.  They are drawn in the margins surrounding the
       plotting area.  The default axes <b>x</b> and <b>y</b> are drawn in the bottom and left margins. The axes <b>x2</b> and <b>y2</b> are
       drawn in top and right margins.  By default, only <b>x</b> and  <b>y</b>  are  shown.  Note  that  the  axes  can  have
       different scales.

       To  display  a  different  axis or more than one axis, you invoke one of the following components: <b>xaxis</b>,
       <b>yaxis</b>, <b>x2axis</b>, and <b>y2axis</b>.  Each component has a <b>use</b> operation that designates the axis (or axes)  to  be
       drawn in that corresponding margin: <b>xaxis</b> in the bottom, <b>yaxis</b> in the left, <b>x2axis</b> in the top, and <b>y2axis</b>
       in the right.

              # Display the axis tempAxis in the left margin.
              .g yaxis use tempAxis

       The  <b>use</b> operation takes a list of axis names as its last argument.  This is the list of axes to be drawn
       in this margin.

       You can configure axes in many ways. The axis scale can be linear or logarithmic.  The values  along  the
       axis  can  either  monotonically increase or decrease.  If you need custom tick labels, you can specify a
       Tcl procedure to format the label any way you wish.  You can control how ticks are drawn, by changing the
       major tick interval or the number of minor ticks.  You can define non-uniform tick intervals, such as for
       time-series plots.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>axis</b> <b>bind</b> <u>tagName</u> ?<u>sequence</u>?  ?<u>command</u>?
              Associates <u>command</u> with <u>tagName</u> such that whenever the event sequence given by <u>sequence</u> occurs for
              an axis with this tag, <u>command</u> will be invoked.  The syntax is similar to the <b>bind</b> command  except
              that  it  operates  on  graph  axes,  rather  than widgets. See the <b>bind</b> manual entry for complete
              details on <u>sequence</u> and the substitutions performed on <u>command</u> before invoking it.

              If all arguments are specified then a new binding is created, replacing any existing  binding  for
              the  same  <u>sequence</u>  and <u>tagName</u>.  If the first character of <u>command</u> is <b>+</b> then <u>command</u> augments an
              existing binding rather than replacing it.  If no <u>command</u> argument is provided  then  the  command
              currently  associated  with <u>tagName</u> and <u>sequence</u> (it's an error occurs if there's no such binding)
              is returned.  If both <u>command</u> and <u>sequence</u> are missing then a list of all the event sequences  for
              which bindings have been defined for <u>tagName</u>.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>axis</b> <b>cget</b> <u>axisName</u> <u>option</u>
              Returns  the  current  value of the option given by <u>option</u> for <u>axisName</u>.  <u>Option</u> may be any option
              described below for the axis <b>configure</b> operation.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>axis</b> <b>configure</b> <u>axisName</u> ?<u>axisName</u>?... ?<u>option</u> <u>value</u>?...
              Queries or modifies the configuration options of <u>axisName</u>.   Several  axes  can  be  changed.   If
              <u>option</u>  isn't  specified,  a list describing all the current options for <u>axisName</u> is returned.  If
              <u>option</u> is specified, but not <u>value</u>, then a list describing <u>option</u> is returned.   If  one  or  more
              <u>option</u>  and <u>value</u> pairs are specified, then for each pair, the axis option <u>option</u> is set to <u>value</u>.
              The following options are valid for axes.

              <b>-bindtags</b> <u>tagList</u>
                     Specifies the binding tags for the axis.  <u>TagList</u> is a list of binding tag names.  The tags
                     and their order will determine how events for axes are  handled.   Each  tag  in  the  list
                     matching  the  current  event  sequence will have its Tcl command executed.  Implicitly the
                     name of the element is always the first tag in the list.  The default value is <b>all</b>.

              <b>-color</b> <u>color</u>
                     Sets the color of the axis and tick labels.  The default is <b>black</b>.

              <b>-command</b> <u>prefix</u>
                     Specifies a Tcl command to be invoked when formatting the axis tick  labels.  <u>Prefix</u>  is  a
                     string  containing  the name of a Tcl proc and any extra arguments for the procedure.  This
                     command is invoked for each major tick on the axis.  Two additional arguments are passed to
                     the procedure: the pathname of the widget and the current the numeric value  of  the  tick.
                     The  procedure  returns  the formatted tick label.  If <b>""</b> is returned, no label will appear
                     next to the tick.  You can get the standard tick labels again by setting <u>prefix</u> to <b>""</b>.  The
                     default is <b>""</b>.

                     Please note that this procedure is invoked while the  graph  is  redrawn.   You  may  query
                     configuration options.  But do not them, because this can have unexpected results.

              <b>-descending</b> <u>boolean</u>
                     Indicates whether the values along the axis are monotonically increasing or decreasing.  If
                     <u>boolean</u> is true, the axis values will be decreasing.  The default is <b>0</b>.

              <b>-hide</b> <u>boolean</u>
                     Indicates  if  the  axis  is displayed. If <u>boolean</u> is false the axis will be displayed. Any
                     element mapped to the axis is displayed regardless.  The default value is <b>0</b>.

              <b>-justify</b> <u>justify</u>
                     Specifies how the axis title should be justified.  This matters only when  the  axis  title
                     contains  more  than one line of text. <u>Justify</u> must be <b>left</b>, <b>right</b>, or <b>center</b>.  The default
                     is <b>center</b>.

              <b>-limits</b> <u>formatStr</u>
                     Specifies a printf-like description to format the minimum and maximum limits of  the  axis.
                     The  limits  are  displayed  at  the  top/bottom  or left/right sides of the plotting area.
                     <u>FormatStr</u> is a list of one or two format descriptions.  If  one  description  is  supplied,
                     both  the  minimum  and  maximum  limits  are formatted in the same way.  If two, the first
                     designates the format for the minimum limit, the second for the maximum.  If <b>""</b> is given as
                     either description, then the that limit will not be displayed.  The default is <b>""</b>.

              <b>-linewidth</b> <u>pixels</u>
                     Sets the width of the axis and tick lines.  The default is <b>1</b> pixel.

              <b>-logscale</b> <u>boolean</u>
                     Indicates whether the scale of the axis is logarithmic or linear.  If <u>boolean</u> is true,  the
                     axis is logarithmic.  The default scale is linear.

              <b>-loose</b> <u>boolean</u>
                     Indicates  whether  the  limits  of  the  axis  should  fit the data points tightly, at the
                     outermost data points, or loosely, at the outer tick intervals.  If the axis limit  is  set
                     with the -min or -max option, the axes are displayed tightly.  If <u>boolean</u> is true, the axis
                     range is "loose".  The default is <b>0</b>.

              <b>-majorticks</b> <u>majorList</u>
                     Specifies  where  to display major axis ticks.  You can use this option to display ticks at
                     non-uniform intervals.  <u>MajorList</u> is a list of axis coordinates designating the location of
                     major ticks.  No minor  ticks  are  drawn.   If  <u>majorList</u>  is  <b>""</b>,  major  ticks  will  be
                     automatically computed. The default is <b>""</b>.

              <b>-max</b> <u>value</u>
                     Sets  the  maximum  limit of <u>axisName</u>.  Any data point greater than <u>value</u> is not displayed.
                     If <u>value</u> is <b>""</b>, the maximum limit is calculated using the largest data value.  The  default
                     is <b>""</b>.

              <b>-min</b> <u>value</u>
                     Sets  the  minimum  limit of <u>axisName</u>. Any data point less than <u>value</u> is not displayed.  If
                     <u>value</u> is <b>""</b>, the minimum limit is calculated using the smallest data value.  The default is
                     <b>""</b>.

              <b>-minorticks</b> <u>minorList</u>
                     Specifies where to display minor axis ticks.  You can use  this  option  to  display  minor
                     ticks  at  non-uniform  intervals.  <u>MinorList</u> is a list of real values, ranging from 0.0 to
                     1.0, designating the placement of a minor tick.  No minor ticks are drawn if the <b>-majortick</b>
                     option is also set.  If <u>minorList</u> is <b>""</b>, minor ticks will be  automatically  computed.  The
                     default is <b>""</b>.

              <b>-rotate</b> <u>theta</u>
                     Specifies  the  how  many  degrees  to  rotate the axis tick labels.  <u>Theta</u> is a real value
                     representing the number of degrees to rotate the tick labels.  The default is <b>0.0</b> degrees.

              <b>-scrollcommand</b> <u>command</u>
                     Specify the prefix for a command used to communicate with scrollbars for this axis, such as
                     <u>.sbar</u> <u>set</u>.

              <b>-scrollmax</b> <u>value</u>
                     Sets the maximum limit of the axis scroll region.  If <u>value</u> is <b>""</b>,  the  maximum  limit  is
                     calculated using the largest data value.  The default is <b>""</b>.

              <b>-scrollmin</b> <u>value</u>
                     Sets  the  minimum  limit  of  axis  scroll  region.   If <u>value</u> is <b>""</b>, the minimum limit is
                     calculated using the smallest data value.  The default is <b>""</b>.

              <b>-showticks</b> <u>boolean</u>
                     Indicates whether axis ticks should be drawn. If <u>boolean</u> is  true,  ticks  are  drawn.   If
                     false, only the axis line is drawn. The default is <b>1</b>.

              <b>-stepsize</b> <u>value</u>
                     Specifies  the interval between major axis ticks.  If <u>value</u> isn't a valid interval (must be
                     less than the axis range), the request is  ignored  and  the  step  size  is  automatically
                     calculated.

              <b>-subdivisions</b> <u>number</u>
                     Indicates  how  many minor axis ticks are to be drawn.  For example, if <u>number</u> is two, only
                     one minor tick is drawn.  If <u>number</u> is one, no minor ticks are displayed.  The  default  is
                     <b>2</b>.

              <b>-tickfont</b> <u>fontName</u>
                     Specifies the font for axis tick labels. The default is <b>*-Courier-Bold-R-Normal-*-100-*</b>.

              <b>-ticklength</b> <u>pixels</u>
                     Sets  the length of major and minor ticks (minor ticks are half the length of major ticks).
                     If <u>pixels</u> is less than zero, the axis will be inverted with ticks  drawn  pointing  towards
                     the plot.  The default is <b>0.1i</b>.

              <b>-title</b> <u>text</u>
                     Sets the title of the axis. If <u>text</u> is <b>""</b>, no axis title will be displayed.

              <b>-titlealternate</b> <u>boolean</u>
                     Indicates  to display the axis title in its alternate location.  Normally the axis title is
                     centered along the axis.  This option places the axis either to the right (horizontal axes)
                     or above (vertical axes) the axis.  The default is <b>0</b>.

              <b>-titlecolor</b> <u>color</u>
                     Sets the color of the axis title. The default is <b>black</b>.

              <b>-titlefont</b> <u>fontName</u>
                     Specifies the font for axis title. The default is <b>*-Helvetica-Bold-R-Normal-*-14-140-*</b>.

              Axis configuration options may be also be set by the <b>option</b> command.  The resource class is  <b>Axis</b>.
              The resource names are the names of the axes (such as <b>x</b> or <b>x2</b>).

                     option add *Graph.Axis.Color  blue
                     option add *Graph.x.LogScale  true
                     option add *Graph.x2.LogScale false

       <u>pathName</u> <b>axis</b> <b>create</b> <u>axisName</u> ?<u>option</u> <u>value</u>?...
              Creates  a  new axis by the name <u>axisName</u>.  No axis by the same name can already exist. <u>Option</u> and
              <u>value</u> are described in above in the axis <b>configure</b> operation.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>axis</b> <b>delete</b> ?<u>axisName</u>?...
              Deletes the named axes. An axis is not really deleted until it is not longer in use, so it's  safe
              to delete axes mapped to elements.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>axis</b> <b>invtransform</b> <u>axisName</u> <u>value</u>
              Performs  the  inverse transformation, changing the screen coordinate <u>value</u> to a graph coordinate,
              mapping the value mapped to <u>axisName</u>.  Returns the graph coordinate.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>axis</b> <b>limits</b> <u>axisName</u>
              Returns a list of the minimum and maximum limits for <u>axisName</u>.  The order of the list is <b>min</b> <b>max</b>.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>axis</b> <b>names</b> ?<u>pattern</u>?...
              Returns a list of axes matching zero or more patterns.  If no <u>pattern</u> argument is give, the  names
              of all axes are returned.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>axis</b> <b>transform</b> <u>axisName</u> <u>value</u>
              Transforms the coordinate <u>value</u> to a screen coordinate by mapping the it to <u>axisName</u>.  Returns the
              transformed screen coordinate.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>axis</b> <b>view</b> <u>axisName</u>
              Change the viewable area of this axis. Use as an argument to a scrollbar's "<u>-command</u>".

       The  default axes are <b>x</b>, <b>y</b>, <b>x2</b>, and <b>y2</b>.  But you can display more than four axes simultaneously.  You can
       also swap in a different axis with <b>use</b> operation of the special axis components:  <b>xaxis</b>,  <b>x2axis</b>,  <b>yaxis</b>,
       and <b>y2axis</b>.

              .g create axis temp
              .g create axis time
              ...
              .g xaxis use temp
              .g yaxis use time

       Only the axes specified for use are displayed on the screen.

       The  <b>xaxis</b>,  <b>x2axis</b>, <b>yaxis</b>, and <b>y2axis</b> components operate on an axis location rather than a specific axis
       like the more general <b>axis</b> component does.  They implicitly control the axis that is currently  using  to
       that  location.   By  default,  <b>xaxis</b>  uses the <b>x</b> axis, <b>yaxis</b> uses <b>y</b>, <b>x2axis</b> uses <b>x2</b>, and <b>y2axis</b> uses <b>y2</b>.
       When more than one axis is displayed in a margin, it represents the first axis displayed.

       The following operations are available  for  axes.  They  mirror  exactly  the  operations  of  the  <b>axis</b>
       component.   The <u>axis</u> argument must be <b>xaxis</b>, <b>x2axis</b>, <b>yaxis</b>, or <b>y2axis</b>.  This feature is deprecated since
       more than one axis can now be used a margin.  You should only use the <b>xaxis</b>, <b>x2axis</b>,  <b>yaxis</b>,  and  <b>y2axis</b>
       components with the <b>use</b> operation.  For all other operations, use the general <b>axis</b> component instead.

       <u>pathName</u> <u>axis</u> <b>use</b> ?<u>axisName</u>?
              Designates  the axis <u>axisName</u> is to be displayed at this location.  <u>AxisName</u> can not be already in
              use at another location.  This command returns the name of the axis currently using this location.

   <b>CROSSHAIRS</b> <b>COMPONENT</b>
       Cross hairs consist of two intersecting lines (one vertical and one horizontal) drawn  completely  across
       the  plotting area.  They are used to position the mouse in relation to the coordinate axes.  Cross hairs
       differ from line markers in that they are implemented using XOR drawing primitives.  This means that they
       can be quickly drawn and erased without redrawing the entire graph.  Note that crosshair are  enabled  by
       calling  <b>Blt_Crosshairs</b>  and turned off by calling <b>Blt_ResetCrosshairs</b>.  Similarly call <b>Blt_ZoomStack</b> for
       zooming.

       The following operations are available for cross hairs:

       <u>pathName</u> <b>crosshairs</b> <b>cget</b> <u>option</u>
              Returns the current value of the cross hairs configuration option given by <u>option</u>.  <u>Option</u> may  be
              any option described below for the cross hairs <b>configure</b> operation.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>crosshairs</b> <b>configure</b> ?<u>option</u> <u>value</u>?...
              Queries  or  modifies  the configuration options of the cross hairs.  If <u>option</u> isn't specified, a
              list describing all the current options for the cross hairs is returned.  If <u>option</u> is  specified,
              but  not  <u>value</u>, then a list describing <u>option</u> is returned.  If one or more <u>option</u> and <u>value</u> pairs
              are specified, then for each pair, the cross hairs option <u>option</u> is set to <u>value</u>.   The  following
              options are available for cross hairs.

              <b>-color</b> <u>color</u>
                     Sets the color of the cross hairs.  The default is <b>black</b>.

              <b>-dashes</b> <u>dashList</u>
                     Sets  the  dash  style  of  the  cross  hairs.  <u>DashList</u> is a list of up to 11 numbers that
                     alternately represent the lengths of the dashes and gaps on the  cross  hair  lines.   Each
                     number must be between 1 and 255.  If <u>dashList</u> is <b>""</b>, the cross hairs will be solid lines.

              <b>-hide</b> <u>boolean</u>
                     Indicates  whether  cross  hairs  are drawn. If <u>boolean</u> is true, cross hairs are not drawn.
                     The default is <b>yes</b>.

              <b>-linewidth</b> <u>pixels</u>
                     Set the width of the cross hair lines.  The default is <b>1</b>.

              <b>-position</b> <u>pos</u>
                     Specifies the screen position where the cross hairs intersect.  <u>Pos</u> must  be  in  the  form
                     "<u>@x,y</u>", where <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> are the window coordinates of the intersection.

              Cross hairs configuration options may be also be set by the <b>option</b> command.  The resource name and
              class are <b>crosshairs</b> and <b>Crosshairs</b> respectively.

                     option add *Graph.Crosshairs.LineWidth 2
                     option add *Graph.Crosshairs.Color     red

       <u>pathName</u> <b>crosshairs</b> <b>off</b>
              Turns off the cross hairs.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>crosshairs</b> <b>on</b>
              Turns on the display of the cross hairs.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>crosshairs</b> <b>toggle</b>
              Toggles the current state of the cross hairs, alternately mapping and unmapping the cross hairs.

   <b>ELEMENT</b> <b>COMPONENTS</b>
       A  data  element represents a set of data.  It contains x and y vectors containing the coordinates of the
       data points.  Elements can be displayed with a symbol at each data point and lines connecting the points.
       Elements also control the appearance of the data, such as the symbol type, line width, color etc.

       When new data elements are created, they are automatically added to a list of displayed  elements.    The
       display list controls what elements are drawn and in what order.

       The following operations are available for elements.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>element</b> <b>activate</b> <u>elemName</u> ?<u>index</u>?...
              Specifies  the  data points of element <u>elemName</u> to be drawn using active foreground and background
              colors.  <u>ElemName</u> is the name of the element and <u>index</u> is a number representing the index  of  the
              data point. If no indices are present then all data points become active.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>element</b> <b>bind</b> <u>tagName</u> ?<u>sequence</u>?  ?<u>command</u>?
              Associates <u>command</u> with <u>tagName</u> such that whenever the event sequence given by <u>sequence</u> occurs for
              an  element  with  this  tag,  <u>command</u> will be invoked.  The syntax is similar to the <b>bind</b> command
              except that it operates on graph elements, rather than widgets. See  the  <b>bind</b>  manual  entry  for
              complete details on <u>sequence</u> and the substitutions performed on <u>command</u> before invoking it.

              If  all  arguments are specified then a new binding is created, replacing any existing binding for
              the same <u>sequence</u> and <u>tagName</u>.  If the first character of <u>command</u> is <b>+</b> then  <u>command</u>  augments  an
              existing  binding  rather  than replacing it.  If no <u>command</u> argument is provided then the command
              currently associated with <u>tagName</u> and <u>sequence</u> (it's an error occurs if there's no  such  binding)
              is  returned.  If both <u>command</u> and <u>sequence</u> are missing then a list of all the event sequences for
              which bindings have been defined for <u>tagName</u>.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>element</b> <b>cget</b> <u>elemName</u> <u>option</u>
              Returns the current value of the element configuration option given by <u>option</u>.  <u>Option</u> may be  any
              of the options described below for the element <b>configure</b> operation.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>element</b> <b>closest</b> <u>x</u> <u>y</u> <u>varName</u> ?<u>option</u> <u>value</u>?... ?<u>elemName</u>?...

              Searches  for  the data point closest to the window coordinates <u>x</u> and <u>y</u>.  By default, all elements
              are searched.  Hidden elements (see the <b>-hide</b> option is false) are ignored.   You  can  limit  the
              search by specifying only the elements you want to be considered.  <u>ElemName</u> must be the name of an
              element  that  is not be hidden.  <u>VarName</u> is the name of a Tcl array variable and will contain the
              search results: the name of the closest element, the index of the  closest  data  point,  and  the
              graph  coordinates  of the point. Returns <b>0</b>, if no data point within the threshold distance can be
              found, otherwise <b>1</b> is returned.  The following <u>option</u>-<u>value</u> pairs are available.

              <b>-along</b> <u>direction</u>
                     Search for the closest element using the following criteria:

                     <b>x</b>      Find closest element vertically from the given X-coordinate.

                     <b>y</b>      Find the closest element horizontally from the given Y-coordinate.

                     <b>both</b>   Find the closest element for the given point (using both the X and Y coordinates).

              <b>-halo</b> <u>pixels</u>
                     Specifies a threshold distance where selected data points are ignored.  <u>Pixels</u> is  a  valid
                     screen  distance,  such  as <b>2</b> or <b>1.2i</b>.  If this option isn't specified, then it defaults to
                     the value of the graph's <b>-halo</b> option.

              <b>-interpolate</b> <u>string</u>
                     Indicates whether to consider projections that lie along the line segments connecting  data
                     points when searching for the closest point.  The default value is <b>0</b>. The values for <u>string</u>
                     are described below.

                     <b>no</b>          Search only for the closest data point.

                     <b>yes</b>         Search  includes  projections  that  lie along the line segments connecting the
                                 data points.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>element</b> <b>configure</b> <u>elemName</u> ?<u>elemName</u>... ?<u>option</u> <u>value</u>?...
              Queries or modifies the configuration options for elements.  Several elements can be  modified  at
              the  same  time. If <u>option</u> isn't specified, a list describing all the current options for <u>elemName</u>
              is returned.  If <u>option</u> is specified, but not <u>value</u>, then a list describing the option  <u>option</u>  is
              returned.   If  one  or more <u>option</u> and <u>value</u> pairs are specified, then for each pair, the element
              option <u>option</u> is set to <u>value</u>.  The following options are valid for elements.

              <b>-activepen</b> <u>penName</u>
                     Specifies pen to use to draw active element.  If <u>penName</u> is <b>""</b>, no active elements will  be
                     drawn.  The default is <b>activeLine</b>.

              <b>-bindtags</b> <u>tagList</u>
                     Specifies  the  binding tags for the element.  <u>TagList</u> is a list of binding tag names.  The
                     tags and their order will determine how events are handled for elements.  Each tag  in  the
                     list  matching  the  current event sequence will have its Tcl command executed.  Implicitly
                     the name of the element is always the first tag in the list.  The default value is <b>all</b>.

              <b>-color</b> <u>color</u>
                     Sets the color of the traces connecting the data points.

              <b>-dashes</b> <u>dashList</u>
                     Sets the dash style of element  line.  <u>DashList</u>  is  a  list  of  up  to  11  numbers  that
                     alternately  represent the lengths of the dashes and gaps on the element line.  Each number
                     must be between 1 and 255.  If <u>dashList</u> is <b>""</b>, the lines will be solid.

              <b>-data</b> <u>coordList</u>
                     Specifies the X-Y coordinates of the data.  <u>CoordList</u> is  a  list  of  numeric  expressions
                     representing the X-Y coordinate pairs of each data point.

              <b>-fill</b> <u>color</u>
                     Sets  the  interior  color  of symbols.  If <u>color</u> is <b>""</b>, then the interior of the symbol is
                     transparent.  If <u>color</u> is <b>defcolor</b>, then the color will be the same as the  <b>-color</b>  option.
                     The default is <b>defcolor</b>.

              <b>-hide</b> <u>boolean</u>
                     Indicates whether the element is displayed.  The default is <b>no</b>.

              <b>-label</b> <u>text</u>
                     Sets  the  element's label in the legend.  If <u>text</u> is <b>""</b>, the element will have no entry in
                     the legend.  The default label is the element's name.

              <b>-linewidth</b> <u>pixels</u>
                     Sets the width of the connecting lines between data points.  If <u>pixels</u> is <b>0</b>, no  connecting
                     lines will be drawn between symbols.  The default is <b>0</b>.

              <b>-mapx</b> <u>xAxis</u>
                     Selects  the  X-axis to map the element's X-coordinates onto.  <u>XAxis</u> must be the name of an
                     axis.  The default is <b>x</b>.

              <b>-mapy</b> <u>yAxis</u>
                     Selects the Y-axis to map the element's Y-coordinates onto.  <u>YAxis</u> must be the name  of  an
                     axis. The default is <b>y</b>.

              <b>-offdash</b> <u>color</u>
                     Sets the color of the stripes when traces are dashed (see the <b>-dashes</b> option).  If <u>color</u> is
                     <b>""</b>,  then  the  "off" pixels will represent gaps instead of stripes.  If <u>color</u> is <b>defcolor</b>,
                     then the color will be the same as the <b>-color</b> option.  The default is <b>defcolor</b>.

              <b>-outline</b> <u>color</u>
                     Sets the color or the outline around each symbol.  If <u>color</u>  is  <b>""</b>,  then  no  outline  is
                     drawn.  If  <u>color</u>  is  <b>defcolor</b>, then the color will be the same as the <b>-color</b> option.  The
                     default is <b>defcolor</b>.

              <b>-pen</b> <u>penname</u>
                     Set the pen to use for this element.

              <b>-outlinewidth</b> <u>pixels</u>
                     Sets the width of the outline bordering each symbol.  If <u>pixels</u> is <b>0</b>, no  outline  will  be
                     drawn. The default is <b>1</b>.

              <b>-pixels</b> <u>pixels</u>
                     Sets  the  size  of  symbols.   If  <u>pixels</u>  is <b>0</b>, no symbols will be drawn.  The default is
                     <b>0.125i</b>.

              <b>-scalesymbols</b> <u>boolean</u>
                     If <u>boolean</u> is true, the size of the symbols drawn for <u>elemName</u> will change  with  scale  of
                     the  X-axis and Y-axis.  At the time this option is set, the current ranges of the axes are
                     saved as the normalized scales (i.e scale factor is 1.0) and the element is  drawn  at  its
                     designated size (see the <b>-pixels</b> option).  As the scale of the axes change, the symbol will
                     be  scaled  according to the smaller of the X-axis and Y-axis scales.  If <u>boolean</u> is false,
                     the element's symbols are drawn at the designated size, regardless  of  axis  scales.   The
                     default is <b>0</b>.

              <b>-smooth</b> <u>smooth</u>
                     Specifies how connecting line segments are drawn between data points.  <u>Smooth</u> can be either
                     <b>linear</b>,  <b>step</b>, <b>natural</b>, or <b>quadratic</b>.  If <u>smooth</u> is <b>linear</b>, a single line segment is drawn,
                     connecting both data points. When <u>smooth</u> is <b>step</b>, two line segments are drawn. The first is
                     a horizontal line segment that steps the next X-coordinate.  The second is a vertical line,
                     moving to the next Y-coordinate.  Both <u>natural</u> and  <u>quadratic</u>  generate  multiple  segments
                     between  data  points.   If  <u>natural</u>,  the segments are generated using a cubic spline.  If
                     <u>quadratic</u>, a quadratic spline is used.  The default is <u>linear</u>.

              <b>-styles</b> <u>styleList</u>
                     Specifies what pen to use based on the range of weights given.   <u>StyleList</u>  is  a  list  of
                     style  specifications.  Each  style  specification,  in turn, is a list consisting of a pen
                     name, and optionally a minimum and maximum  range.   Data  points  whose  weight  (see  the
                     <b>-weight</b>  option) falls in this range, are drawn with this pen.  If no range is specified it
                     defaults to the index of the  pen  in  the  list.   Note  that  this  affects  only  symbol
                     attributes. Line attributes, such as line width, dashes, etc. are ignored.

              <b>-symbol</b> <u>symbol</u>
                     Specifies  the symbol for data points.  <u>Symbol</u> can be either <b>square</b>, <b>circle</b>, <b>diamond</b>, <b>plus</b>,
                     <b>cross</b>, <b>splus</b>, <b>scross</b>, <b>triangle</b>, <b>""</b> (where no symbol is drawn), or a  bitmap.   Bitmaps  are
                     specified  as  "<u>source</u>  ?<u>mask</u>?",  where  <u>source</u>  is the name of the bitmap, and <u>mask</u> is the
                     bitmap's optional mask.  The default is <b>circle</b>.

              <b>-trace</b> <u>direction</u>
                     Indicates whether connecting lines between  data  points  (whose  X-coordinate  values  are
                     either  increasing  or decreasing) are drawn.  <u>Direction</u> must be <b>increasing</b>, <b>decreasing</b>, or
                     <b>both</b>.  For example, if <u>direction</u> is <b>increasing</b>, connecting lines will be drawn only between
                     those data points where X-coordinate values are monotonically increasing.  If <u>direction</u>  is
                     <b>both</b>, connecting lines will be draw between all data points.  The default is <b>both</b>.

              <b>-weights</b> <u>wVec</u>
                     Specifies  the  weights of the individual data points.  This, with the list pen styles (see
                     the <b>-styles</b> option), controls how data points are drawn.  <u>WVec</u> is the name of a BLT  vector
                     or a list of numeric expressions representing the weights for each data point.

              <b>-xdata</b> <u>xVec</u>
                     Specifies  the  X-coordinates  of  the data.  <u>XVec</u> is the name of a BLT vector or a list of
                     numeric expressions.

              <b>-ydata</b> <u>yVec</u>
                     Specifies the Y-coordinates of the data.  <u>YVec</u> is the name of a BLT vector  or  a  list  of
                     numeric expressions.

              Element  configuration  options  may  also  be  set  by the <b>option</b> command.  The resource class is
              <b>Element</b>. The resource name is the name of the element.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>grid</b> <b>toggle</b>
              Toggles the display of the grid.

   <b>LEGEND</b> <b>COMPONENT</b>
       The legend displays a list of the data elements.  Each entry consists of the element's symbol and  label.
       The  legend  can  appear  in  any  margin  (the default location is in the right margin).  It can also be
       positioned anywhere within the plotting area.

       The following operations are valid for the legend.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>legend</b> <b>activate</b> <u>pattern</u>...
              Selects legend entries to be drawn using the active legend colors and relief.  All  entries  whose
              element  names  match <u>pattern</u>  are selected.  To be selected, the element name must match only one
              <u>pattern</u>.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>legend</b> <b>bind</b> <u>tagName</u> ?<u>sequence</u>?  ?<u>command</u>?
              Associates <u>command</u> with <u>tagName</u> such that whenever the event sequence given by <u>sequence</u> occurs for
              a legend entry with this tag, <u>command</u> will be invoked.  Implicitly the element names in the  entry
              are  tags.   The  syntax is similar to the <b>bind</b> command except that it operates on legend entries,
              rather than widgets. See  the  <b>bind</b>  manual  entry  for  complete  details  on  <u>sequence</u>  and  the
              substitutions performed on <u>command</u> before invoking it.

              If  all  arguments are specified then a new binding is created, replacing any existing binding for
              the same <u>sequence</u> and <u>tagName</u>.  If the first character of <u>command</u> is <b>+</b> then  <u>command</u>  augments  an
              existing  binding  rather  than replacing it.  If no <u>command</u> argument is provided then the command
              currently associated with <u>tagName</u> and <u>sequence</u> (it's an error occurs if there's no  such  binding)
              is  returned.  If both <u>command</u> and <u>sequence</u> are missing then a list of all the event sequences for
              which bindings have been defined for <u>tagName</u>.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>legend</b> <b>cget</b> <u>option</u>
              Returns the current value of a legend configuration option.  <u>Option</u> may be  any  option  described
              below in the legend <b>configure</b> operation.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>legend</b> <b>configure</b> ?<u>option</u> <u>value</u>?...
              Queries  or  modifies the configuration options for the legend.  If <u>option</u> isn't specified, a list
              describing the current legend options for <u>pathName</u> is returned.  If <u>option</u> is specified,  but  not
              <u>value</u>,  then  a  list  describing  <u>option</u>  is returned.  If one or more <u>option</u> and <u>value</u> pairs are
              specified, then for each pair, the legend option <u>option</u> is set to <u>value</u>.   The  following  options
              are valid for the legend.

              <b>-activebackground</b> <u>color</u>
                     Sets the background color for active legend entries.  All legend entries marked active (see
                     the legend <b>activate</b> operation) are drawn using this background color.

              <b>-activeborderwidth</b> <u>pixels</u>
                     Sets the width of the 3-D border around the outside edge of the active legend entries.  The
                     default is <b>2</b>.

              <b>-activeforeground</b> <u>color</u>
                     Sets  the  foreground color for active legend entries.  All legend entries marked as active
                     (see the legend <b>activate</b> operation) are drawn using this foreground color.

              <b>-activerelief</b> <u>relief</u>
                     Specifies the 3-D effect desired  for  active  legend  entries.   <u>Relief</u>  denotes  how  the
                     interior  of  the entry should appear relative to the legend; for example, <b>raised</b> means the
                     entry should appear to protrude from the legend, relative to the  surface  of  the  legend.
                     The default is <b>flat</b>.

              <b>-anchor</b> <u>anchor</u>
                     Tells how to position the legend relative to the positioning point for the legend.  This is
                     dependent on the value of the <b>-position</b> option.  The default is <b>center</b>.

                     <b>left</b> or <b>right</b>
                                 The anchor describes how to position the legend vertically.

                     <b>top</b> or <b>bottom</b>
                                 The anchor describes how to position the legend horizontally.

                     <b>@x,y</b>        The  anchor  specifies  how  to position the legend relative to the positioning
                                 point. For example, if <u>anchor</u> is <b>center</b> then the  legend  is  centered  on  the
                                 point;  if  <u>anchor</u>  is <b>n</b> then the legend will be drawn such that the top center
                                 point of the  rectangular  region  occupied  by  the  legend  will  be  at  the
                                 positioning point.

                     <b>plotarea</b>    The  anchor specifies how to position the legend relative to the plotting area.
                                 For example, if <u>anchor</u> is <b>center</b> then the legend is centered  in  the  plotting
                                 area;  if  <u>anchor</u>  is  <b>ne</b>  then the legend will be drawn such that occupies the
                                 upper right corner of the plotting area.

              <b>-background</b> <u>color</u>
                     Sets the background color of the legend. If <u>color</u> is <b>""</b>,  the  legend  background  with  be
                     transparent.

              <b>-bindtags</b> <u>tagList</u>
                     Specifies  the  binding  tags  for legend entries.  <u>TagList</u> is a list of binding tag names.
                     The tags and their order will determine how events are handled for  legend  entries.   Each
                     tag in the list matching the current event sequence will have its Tcl command executed. The
                     default value is <b>all</b>.

              <b>-borderwidth</b> <u>pixels</u>
                     Sets  the  width of the 3-D border around the outside edge of the legend (if such border is
                     being drawn; the <b>relief</b> option determines this).  The default is <b>2</b> pixels.

              <b>-font</b> <u>fontName</u>
                     <u>FontName</u> specifies a font to use when drawing the labels of each element into  the  legend.
                     The default is <b>*-Helvetica-Bold-R-Normal-*-12-120-*</b>.

              <b>-foreground</b> <u>color</u>
                     Sets the foreground color of the text drawn for the element's label.  The default is <b>black</b>.

              <b>-hide</b> <u>boolean</u>
                     Indicates  whether  the legend should be displayed. If <u>boolean</u> is true, the legend will not
                     be draw.  The default is <b>no</b>.

              <b>-ipadx</b> <u>pad</u>
                     Sets the amount of internal padding to be added to the width of each legend entry.  <u>Pad</u> can
                     be a list of one or two screen distances.  If <u>pad</u> has two elements, the left  side  of  the
                     legend  entry  is padded by the first distance and the right side by the second.  If <u>pad</u> is
                     just one distance, both the left and right sides are padded evenly.  The default is <b>2</b>.

              <b>-ipady</b> <u>pad</u>
                     Sets an amount of internal padding to be added to the height of each legend entry.  <u>Pad</u> can
                     be a list of one or two screen distances.  If <u>pad</u> has two elements, the top of the entry is
                     padded by the first distance and the bottom by the second.  If <u>pad</u> is  just  one  distance,
                     both the top and bottom of the entry are padded evenly.  The default is <b>2</b>.

              <b>-padx</b> <u>pad</u>
                     Sets  the  padding to the left and right exteriors of the legend.  <u>Pad</u> can be a list of one
                     or two screen distances.  If <u>pad</u> has two elements, the left side of the legend is padded by
                     the first distance and the right side by the second.  If <u>pad</u> has just  one  distance,  both
                     the left and right sides are padded evenly.  The default is <b>4</b>.

              <b>-pady</b> <u>pad</u>
                     Sets  the  padding  above  and  below  the  legend.  <u>Pad</u> can be a list of one or two screen
                     distances.  If <u>pad</u> has two elements, the area above the  legend  is  padded  by  the  first

                     bottom areas are padded evenly.  The default is <b>0</b>.

              <b>-position</b> <u>pos</u>
                     Specifies where the legend is drawn. The <b>-anchor</b> option also affects where  the  legend  is
                     positioned.   If  <u>pos</u>  is  <b>left</b>, <b>left</b>, <b>top</b>, or <b>bottom</b>, the legend is drawn in the specified
                     margin.  If <u>pos</u> is <b>plotarea</b>, then the legend  is  drawn  inside  the  plotting  area  at  a
                     particular anchor.  If <u>pos</u> is in the form "<u>@x,y</u>", where <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> are the window coordinates,
                     the  legend  is  drawn  in  the plotting area at the specified coordinates.  The default is
                     <b>right</b>.

              <b>-raised</b> <u>boolean</u>

                     legend is in the plotting area.  If <u>boolean</u> is true, the legend will be drawn on top of any
                     elements that may overlap it. The default is <b>no</b>.

              <b>-relief</b> <u>relief</u>
                     Specifies the 3-D effect for the border  around  the  legend.   <u>Relief</u>  specifies  how  the
                     interior  of  the legend should appear relative to the graph; for example, <b>raised</b> means the
                     legend should appear to protrude from the graph, relative to the surface of the graph.  The
                     default is <b>sunken</b>.

              Legend configuration options may also be set by the <b>option</b> command.  The resource name  and  class
              are <b>legend</b> and <b>Legend</b> respectively.

              <u>pattern</u>.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>legend</b> <b>get</b> <u>pos</u>
              Returns the name of the element whose entry is at the screen position <u>pos</u> in the legend.  <u>Pos</u> must
              be  in the form "<u>@x,y</u>", where <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> are window coordinates.  If the given coordinates do not lie
              over a legend entry, <b>""</b> is returned.

   <b>PEN</b> <b>COMPONENTS</b>
       Pens define attributes (both symbol and line style) for elements.  Pens mirror the configuration  options
       of  data  elements  that pertain to how symbols and lines are drawn.  Data elements use pens to determine
       how they are drawn.  A data element may use several pens at once.  In this  case,  the  pen  used  for  a
       particular  data  point  is  determined  from each element's weight vector (see the element's <b>-weight</b> and
       <b>-style</b> options).

       One pen, called <b>activeLine</b>, is automatically created.  It's used as the default active pen for  elements.
       So you can change the active attributes for all elements by simply reconfiguring this pen.

              .g pen configure "activeLine" -color green

       You can create and use several pens. To create a pen, invoke the pen component and its create operation.

              .g pen create myPen

       You map pens to a data element using either the element's <b>-pen</b> or <b>-activepen</b> options.

              .g element create "line1" -xdata $x -ydata $tempData \
                  -pen myPen

       An  element can use several pens at once. This is done by specifying the name of the pen in the element's
       style list (see the <b>-styles</b> option).

              .g element configure "line1" -styles { myPen 2.0 3.0 }

       This says that any data point with a weight between 2.0 and 3.0 is to be drawn using the pen <b>myPen</b>.   All
       other points are drawn with the element's default attributes.

       The following operations are available for pen components.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>pen</b> <b>cget</b> <u>penName</u> <u>option</u>
              Returns  the  current  value  of the option given by <u>option</u> for <u>penName</u>.  <u>Option</u> may be any option
              described below for the pen <b>configure</b> operation.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>pen</b> <b>configure</b> <u>penName</u> ?<u>penName</u>... ?<u>option</u> <u>value</u>?...
              Queries or modifies the configuration options of <u>penName</u>. Several pens can be  modified  at  once.
              If  <u>option</u>  isn't  specified,  a  list describing the current options for <u>penName</u> is returned.  If
              <u>option</u> is specified, but not <u>value</u>, then a list describing <u>option</u> is returned.   If  one  or  more
              <u>option</u>  and  <u>value</u> pairs are specified, then for each pair, the pen option <u>option</u> is set to <u>value</u>.
              The following options are valid for pens.

              <b>-color</b> <u>color</u>
                     Sets the color of the traces connecting the data points.

              <b>-dashes</b> <u>dashList</u>
                     Sets the dash style of element  line.  <u>DashList</u>  is  a  list  of  up  to  11  numbers  that
                     alternately  represent the lengths of the dashes and gaps on the element line.  Each number
                     must be between 1 and 255.  If <u>dashList</u> is <b>""</b>, the lines will be solid.

              <b>-fill</b> <u>color</u>
                     Sets the interior color of symbols.  If <u>color</u> is <b>""</b>, then the interior  of  the  symbol  is
                     transparent.   If  <u>color</u> is <b>defcolor</b>, then the color will be the same as the <b>-color</b> option.
                     The default is <b>defcolor</b>.

              <b>-linewidth</b> <u>pixels</u>
                     Sets the width of the connecting lines between data points.  If <u>pixels</u> is <b>0</b>, no  connecting
                     lines will be drawn between symbols.  The default is <b>0</b>.

              <b>-offdash</b> <u>color</u>
                     Sets the color of the stripes when traces are dashed (see the <b>-dashes</b> option).  If <u>color</u> is
                     <b>""</b>,  then  the  "off" pixels will represent gaps instead of stripes.  If <u>color</u> is <b>defcolor</b>,
                     then the color will be the same as the <b>-color</b> option.  The default is <b>defcolor</b>.

              <b>-outline</b> <u>color</u>
                     Sets the color or the outline around each symbol.  If <u>color</u>  is  <b>""</b>,  then  no  outline  is
                     drawn.  If  <u>color</u>  is  <b>defcolor</b>, then the color will be the same as the <b>-color</b> option.  The
                     default is <b>defcolor</b>.

              <b>-outlinewidth</b> <u>pixels</u>
                     Sets the width of the outline bordering each symbol.  If <u>pixels</u> is <b>0</b>, no  outline  will  be
                     drawn. The default is <b>1</b>.

              <b>-pixels</b> <u>pixels</u>
                     Sets  the  size  of  symbols.   If  <u>pixels</u>  is <b>0</b>, no symbols will be drawn.  The default is
                     <b>0.125i</b>.

              <b>-symbol</b> <u>symbol</u>
                     Specifies the symbol for data points.  <u>Symbol</u> can be either <b>square</b>, <b>circle</b>, <b>diamond</b>,  <b>plus</b>,
                     <b>cross</b>,  <b>splus</b>,  <b>scross</b>,  <b>triangle</b>, <b>""</b> (where no symbol is drawn), or a bitmap.  Bitmaps are
                     specified as "<u>source</u> ?<u>mask</u>?", where <u>source</u> is the name of  the  bitmap,  and  <u>mask</u>  is  the
                     bitmap's optional mask.  The default is <b>circle</b>.

              <b>-type</b> <u>elemType</u>
                     Specifies  the  type  of  element  the  pen is to be used with.  This option should only be
                     employed when creating the pen.  This is for those that wish  to  mix  different  types  of
                     elements (bars and lines) on the same graph.  The default type is "line".

              Pen  configuration  options  may be also be set by the <b>option</b> command.  The resource class is <b>Pen</b>.
              The resource names are the names of the pens.

                     option add *Graph.Pen.Color  blue
                     option add *Graph.activeLine.color  green

       <u>pathName</u> <b>pen</b> <b>create</b> <u>penName</u> ?<u>option</u> <u>value</u>?...
              Creates a new pen by the name <u>penName</u>.  No pen by the same name  can  already  exist.  <u>Option</u>  and
              <u>value</u> are described in above in the pen <b>configure</b> operation.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>pen</b> <b>delete</b> ?<u>penName</u>?...
              Deletes the named pens. A pen is not really deleted until it is not longer in use, so it's safe to
              delete pens mapped to elements.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>pen</b> <b>names</b> ?<u>pattern</u>?...
              Returns  a list of pens matching zero or more patterns.  If no <u>pattern</u> argument is give, the names
              of all pens are returned.

   <b>POSTSCRIPT</b> <b>COMPONENT</b>
       The graph can generate encapsulated PostScript output.  There are several configuration options  you  can
       specify  to control how the plot will be generated.  You can change the page dimensions and borders.  The
       plot itself can be scaled, centered, or rotated to landscape.   The  PostScript  output  can  be  written
       directly to a file or returned through the interpreter.

       The following postscript operations are available.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>postscript</b> <b>cget</b> <u>option</u>
              Returns  the  current  value  of  the postscript option given by <u>option</u>.  <u>Option</u> may be any option
              described below for the postscript <b>configure</b> operation.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>postscript</b> <b>configure</b> ?<u>option</u> <u>value</u>?...
              Queries or modifies  the  configuration  options  for  PostScript  generation.   If  <u>option</u>  isn't
              specified,  a  list describing the current postscript options for <u>pathName</u> is returned.  If <u>option</u>
              is specified, but not <u>value</u>, then a list describing <u>option</u> is returned.  If one or more <u>option</u> and
              <u>value</u> pairs are specified, then for each pair, the postscript option <u>option</u> is set to <u>value</u>.   The
              following postscript options are available.

              <b>-center</b> <u>boolean</u>
                     Indicates whether the plot should be centered on the PostScript page.  If <u>boolean</u> is false,
                     the plot will be placed in the upper left corner of the page.  The default is <b>1</b>.

              <b>-colormap</b> <u>varName</u>
                     <u>VarName</u> must be the name of a global array variable that specifies a color mapping from the
                     X color name to PostScript.  Each element of <u>varName</u> must consist of PostScript code to set
                     a  particular  color  value  (e.g.  ``<b>1.0</b>  <b>1.0</b>  <b>0.0</b>  <b>setrgbcolor</b>'').  When generating color
                     information in PostScript, the array variable <u>varName</u> is checked if an element of the  name
                     as  the  color exists. If so, it uses its value as the PostScript command to set the color.
                     If this option hasn't been specified, or if there isn't an entry in  <u>varName</u>  for  a  given
                     color, then it uses the red, green, and blue intensities from the X color.

              <b>-colormode</b> <u>mode</u>
                     Specifies  how  to  output  color  information.   <u>Mode</u> must be either <b>color</b> (for full color
                     output), <b>gray</b> (convert all  colors  to  their  gray-scale  equivalents)  or  <b>mono</b>  (convert
                     foreground colors to black and background colors to white).  The default mode is <b>color</b>.

              <b>-fontmap</b> <u>varName</u>
                     <u>VarName</u>  must be the name of a global array variable that specifies a font mapping from the
                     X font name to PostScript.  Each element of <u>varName</u> must consist of a Tcl list with one  or
                     two  elements;  the  name  and point size of a PostScript font.  When outputting PostScript
                     commands for a particular font, the array variable <u>varName</u> is checked to see if an  element
                     by  the  specified  font  exists.   If  there is such an element, then the font information
                     contained in that element is used in the PostScript output.  (If the point size is  omitted
                     from  the list, the point size of the X font is used).  Otherwise the X font is examined in
                     an attempt to guess what PostScript font to use.  This works only for fonts  whose  foundry
                     property is <u>Adobe</u> (such as Times, Helvetica, Courier, etc.).  If all of this fails then the
                     font defaults to <b>Helvetica-Bold</b>.

              <b>-decorations</b> <u>boolean</u>
                     Indicates whether PostScript commands to generate color backgrounds and 3-D borders will be
                     output.   If  <u>boolean</u>  is  false,  the  background will be white and no 3-D borders will be
                     generated. The default is <b>1</b>.

              <b>-height</b> <u>pixels</u>
                     Sets the height of the plot.  This lets you print the graph with a  height  different  from
                     the  one  drawn  on  the  screen.   If  <u>pixels</u> is 0, the height is the same as the widget's
                     height.  The default is <b>0</b>.

              <b>-landscape</b> <u>boolean</u>
                     If <u>boolean</u> is true, this specifies the printed area is to be rotated 90 degrees.   In  non-
                     rotated  output  the  X-axis of the printed area runs along the short dimension of the page
                     (``portrait'' orientation); in rotated output the X-axis runs along the long  dimension  of
                     the page (``landscape'' orientation).  Defaults to <b>0</b>.

              <b>-maxpect</b> <u>boolean</u>
                     Indicates  to scale the plot so that it fills the PostScript page.  The aspect ratio of the
                     graph is still retained.  The default is <b>0</b>.

              <b>-padx</b> <u>pad</u>
                     Sets the horizontal padding for the left and right page borders.  The borders are  exterior
                     to  the  plot.  <u>Pad</u> can be a list of one or two screen distances.  If <u>pad</u> has two elements,
                     the left border is padded by the first distance and the right border by the second.  If <u>pad</u>
                     has just one distance, both the left and right borders are padded evenly.  The  default  is
                     <b>1i</b>.

              <b>-pady</b> <u>pad</u>
                     Sets  the vertical padding for the top and bottom page borders. The borders are exterior to
                     the plot.  <u>Pad</u> can be a list of one or two screen distances.  If <u>pad</u> has two elements,  the
                     top border is padded by the first distance and the bottom border by the second.  If <u>pad</u> has
                     just one distance, both the top and bottom borders are padded evenly.  The default is <b>1i</b>.

              <b>-paperheight</b> <u>pixels</u>
                     Sets  the height of the postscript page.  This can be used to select between different page
                     sizes (letter, A4, etc).  The default height is <b>11.0i</b>.

              <b>-paperwidth</b> <u>pixels</u>
                     Sets the width of the postscript page.  This can be used to select between  different  page
                     sizes (letter, A4, etc).  The default width is <b>8.5i</b>.

              <b>-width</b> <u>pixels</u>
                     Sets  the  width of the plot.  This lets you generate a plot of a width different from that
                     of the widget.  If <u>pixels</u> is 0, the width is the same as the widget's width.   The  default
                     is <b>0</b>.

              Postscript  configuration options may be also be set by the <b>option</b> command.  The resource name and
              class are <b>postscript</b> and <b>Postscript</b> respectively.

                     option add *Graph.postscript.Decorations false
                     option add *Graph.Postscript.Landscape   true

       <u>pathName</u> <b>postscript</b> <b>output</b> ?<u>fileName</u>? ?<u>option</u> <u>value</u>?...
              Outputs a file of encapsulated PostScript.  If a <u>fileName</u>  argument  isn't  present,  the  command
              returns  the  PostScript.  If  any  <u>option-value</u> pairs are present, they set configuration options
              controlling how the PostScript is generated.  <u>Option</u> and <u>value</u> can be  anything  accepted  by  the
              postscript <b>configure</b> operation above.

   <b>MARKER</b> <b>COMPONENTS</b>
       Markers  are  simple  drawing  procedures used to annotate or highlight areas of the graph.  Markers have
       various types: text strings, bitmaps, images,  connected  lines,  windows,  or  polygons.   They  can  be
       associated  with a particular element, so that when the element is hidden or un-hidden, so is the marker.
       By default, markers are the last items drawn, so that data elements will appear in behind them.  You  can
       change this by configuring the <b>-under</b> option.

       Markers,  in  contrast  to elements, don't affect the scaling of the coordinate axes.  They can also have
       <u>elastic</u> coordinates (specified by <b>-Inf</b> and <b>Inf</b> respectively) that translate into the minimum  or  maximum
       limit  of the axis.  For example, you can place a marker so it always remains in the lower left corner of
       the plotting area, by using the coordinates <b>-Inf</b>,<b>-Inf</b>.

       The following operations are available for markers.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>marker</b> <b>after</b> <u>markerId</u> ?<u>afterId</u>?
              Changes the order of the markers, drawing the first marker after the second.  If no second <u>afterId</u>
              argument is specified, the marker is placed at the end of the display list.  This command  can  be
              used  to  control  how  markers are displayed since markers are drawn in the order of this display
              list.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>marker</b> <b>before</b> <u>markerId</u> ?<u>beforeId</u>?
              Changes the order of the markers, drawing the first  marker  before  the  second.   If  no  second
              <u>beforeId</u>  argument  is specified, the marker is placed at the beginning of the display list.  This
              command can be used to control how markers are displayed since markers are drawn in the  order  of
              this display list.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>marker</b> <b>bind</b> <u>tagName</u> ?<u>sequence</u>?  ?<u>command</u>?
              Associates <u>command</u> with <u>tagName</u> such that whenever the event sequence given by <u>sequence</u> occurs for
              a marker with this tag, <u>command</u> will be invoked.  The syntax is similar to the <b>bind</b> command except
              that  it  operates  on  graph markers, rather than widgets. See the <b>bind</b> manual entry for complete
              details on <u>sequence</u> and the substitutions performed on <u>command</u> before invoking it.

              If all arguments are specified then a new binding is created, replacing any existing  binding  for
              the  same  <u>sequence</u>  and <u>tagName</u>.  If the first character of <u>command</u> is <b>+</b> then <u>command</u> augments an
              existing binding rather than replacing it.  If no <u>command</u> argument is provided  then  the  command
              currently  associated  with <u>tagName</u> and <u>sequence</u> (it's an error occurs if there's no such binding)
              is returned.  If both <u>command</u> and <u>sequence</u> are missing then a list of all the event sequences  for
              which bindings have been defined for <u>tagName</u>.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>marker</b> <b>cget</b> <u>option</u>
              Returns  the  current value of the marker configuration option given by <u>option</u>.  <u>Option</u> may be any
              option described below in the <b>configure</b> operation.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>marker</b> <b>configure</b> <u>markerId</u> ?<u>option</u> <u>value</u>?...
              Queries or modifies the configuration options for markers.  If  <u>option</u>  isn't  specified,  a  list
              describing  the  current options for <u>markerId</u> is returned.  If <u>option</u> is specified, but not <u>value</u>,
              then a list describing <u>option</u> is returned.  If one or more <u>option</u> and <u>value</u> pairs  are  specified,
              then for each pair, the marker option <u>option</u> is set to <u>value</u>.

              The  following  options  are  valid  for  all markers.  Each type of marker also has its own type-
              specific options.  They are described in the sections below.

              <b>-bindtags</b> <u>tagList</u>
                     Specifies the binding tags for the marker.  <u>TagList</u> is a list of binding  tag  names.   The
                     tags  and  their  order will determine how events for markers are handled.  Each tag in the
                     list matching the current event sequence will have its Tcl  command  executed.   Implicitly
                     the name of the marker is always the first tag in the list.  The default value is <b>all</b>.

              <b>-coords</b> <u>coordList</u>
                     Specifies  the  coordinates  of the marker.  <u>CoordList</u> is a list of graph coordinates.  The
                     number of coordinates required is dependent on the type of marker.  Text, image, and window
                     markers need only two coordinates (an X-Y coordinate).   Bitmap markers can take either two
                     or four coordinates (if four, they represent the corners of the bitmap). Line markers  need
                     at  least four coordinates, polygons at least six.  If <u>coordList</u> is <b>""</b>, the marker will not
                     be displayed.  The default is <b>""</b>.

              <b>-element</b> <u>elemName</u>
                     Links the marker with the element <u>elemName</u>.  The marker is drawn only  if  the  element  is
                     also currently displayed (see the element's <b>show</b> operation).  If <u>elemName</u> is <b>""</b>, the marker
                     is always drawn.  The default is <b>""</b>.

              <b>-hide</b> <u>boolean</u>
                     Indicates  whether  the  marker is drawn. If <u>boolean</u> is true, the marker is not drawn.  The
                     default is <b>no</b>.

              <b>-mapx</b> <u>xAxis</u>
                     Specifies the X-axis to map the marker's X-coordinates onto.  <u>XAxis</u> must  the  name  of  an
                     axis.  The default is <b>x</b>.

              <b>-mapy</b> <u>yAxis</u>
                     Specifies  the  Y-axis  to  map the marker's Y-coordinates onto.  <u>YAxis</u> must the name of an
                     axis.  The default is <b>y</b>.

              <b>-name</b> <u>markerId</u>
                     Changes the identifier for the marker.  The identifier <u>markerId</u> can not already be used  by
                     another marker.  If this option isn't specified, the marker's name is uniquely generated.

              <b>-under</b> <u>boolean</u>
                     Indicates  whether  the marker is drawn below/above data elements.  If <u>boolean</u> is true, the
                     marker is be drawn underneath the data element symbols and lines.  Otherwise, the marker is
                     drawn on top of the element.  The default is <b>0</b>.

              <b>-xoffset</b> <u>pixels</u>
                     Specifies a screen distance to offset the marker horizontally.  <u>Pixels</u> is  a  valid  screen
                     distance, such as <b>2</b> or <b>1.2i</b>.  The default is <b>0</b>.

              <b>-yoffset</b> <u>pixels</u>
                     Specifies  a  screen  distance  to offset the markers vertically.  <u>Pixels</u> is a valid screen
                     distance, such as <b>2</b> or <b>1.2i</b>.  The default is <b>0</b>.

              Marker configuration options may also be set by the <b>option</b> command.  The resource class is  either
              <b>BitmapMarker</b>,   <b>ImageMarker</b>,  <b>LineMarker</b>, <b>PolygonMarker</b>, <b>TextMarker</b>, or <b>WindowMarker</b>, depending on
              the type of marker.  The resource name is the name of the marker.

                     option add *Graph.TextMarker.Foreground white
                     option add *Graph.BitmapMarker.Foreground white
                     option add *Graph.m1.Background     blue

       <u>pathName</u> <b>marker</b> <b>create</b> <u>type</u> ?<u>option</u> <u>value</u>?...
              Creates a marker of the selected type. <u>Type</u> may be either <b>text</b>, <b>line</b>, <b>bitmap</b>, <b>image</b>,  <b>polygon</b>,  or
              <b>window</b>.   This  command  returns the marker identifier, used as the <u>markerId</u> argument in the other
              marker-related commands.   If  the  <b>-name</b>  option  is  used,  this  overrides  the  normal  marker
              identifier.   If the name provided is already used for another marker, the new marker will replace
              the old.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>marker</b> <b>delete</b> ?<u>name</u>?...
              Removes one of more markers.  The graph will automatically be redrawn without the marker..

       <u>pathName</u> <b>marker</b> <b>exists</b> <u>markerId</u>
              Returns <b>1</b> if the marker <u>markerId</u> exists and <b>0</b> otherwise.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>marker</b> <b>names</b> ?<u>pattern</u>?
              Returns the names of all the markers that currently exist.  If <u>pattern</u>  is  supplied,  only  those
              markers whose names match it will be returned.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>marker</b> <b>type</b> <u>markerId</u>
              Returns  the  type  of  the  marker given by <u>markerId</u>, such as <b>line</b> or <b>text</b>.  If <u>markerId</u> is not a
              valid a marker identifier, <b>""</b> is returned.

   <b>BITMAP</b> <b>MARKERS</b>
       A bitmap marker displays a bitmap.  The size of the bitmap is controlled by  the  number  of  coordinates
       specified.   If  two  coordinates,  they  specify the position of the top-left corner of the bitmap.  The
       bitmap retains its normal width and  height.   If  four  coordinates,  the  first  and  second  pairs  of
       coordinates represent the corners of the bitmap.  The bitmap will be stretched or reduced as necessary to
       fit into the bounding rectangle.

       Bitmap  markers are created with the marker's <b>create</b> operation in the form: <u>pathName</u> <b>marker</b> <b>create</b> <b>bitmap</b>
       ?<u>option</u> <u>value</u>?...  There may be many <u>option</u>-<u>value</u> pairs,  each  sets  a  configuration  options  for  the
       marker.  These same <u>option</u>-<u>value</u> pairs may be used with the marker's <b>configure</b> operation.

       The following options are specific to bitmap markers:

       <b>-background</b> <u>color</u>
              Same as the <b>-fill</b> option.

       <b>-bitmap</b> <u>bitmap</u>
              Specifies  the  bitmap  to  be displayed.  If <u>bitmap</u> is <b>""</b>, the marker will not be displayed.  The
              default is <b>""</b>.

       <b>-fill</b> <u>color</u>
              Sets the background color of the bitmap.  If <u>color</u> is the empty  string,  no  background  will  be
              transparent.  The default background color is <b>""</b>.

       <b>-foreground</b> <u>color</u>
              Same as the <b>-outline</b> option.

       <b>-mask</b> <u>mask</u>
              Specifies a mask for the bitmap to be displayed. This mask is a bitmap itself, denoting the pixels
              that are transparent.  If <u>mask</u> is <b>""</b>, all pixels of the bitmap will be drawn.  The default is <b>""</b>.

       <b>-outline</b> <u>color</u>
              Sets the foreground color of the bitmap. The default value is <b>black</b>.

       <b>-rotate</b> <u>theta</u>
              Sets  the  rotation  of  the bitmap.  <u>Theta</u> is a real number representing the angle of rotation in
              degrees.  The marker is first rotated and then placed  according  to  its  anchor  position.   The
              default rotation is <b>0.0</b>.

   <b>IMAGE</b> <b>MARKERS</b>
       A  image  marker  displays an image.  Image markers are created with the marker's <b>create</b> operation in the
       form: <u>pathName</u> <b>marker</b> <b>create</b> <b>image</b> ?<u>option</u> <u>value</u>?...  There may be many <u>option</u>-<u>value</u> pairs, each  sets  a
       configuration  option  for  the  marker.   These  same  <u>option</u>-<u>value</u>  pairs may be used with the marker's
       <b>configure</b> operation.

       The following options are specific to image markers:

       <b>-anchor</b> <u>anchor</u>
              <u>Anchor</u> tells how to position the image relative to  the  positioning  point  for  the  image.  For
              example,  if  <u>anchor</u>  is  <b>center</b> then the image is centered on the point;  if <u>anchor</u> is <b>n</b> then the
              image will be drawn such that the top center point of the rectangular region occupied by the image
              will be at the positioning point.  This option defaults to <b>center</b>.

       <b>-image</b> <u>image</u>
              Specifies the image to be drawn.  If <u>image</u> is <b>""</b>, the marker will not be drawn.   The  default  is
              <b>""</b>.

   <b>LINE</b> <b>MARKERS</b>
       A  line  marker  displays  one  or  more connected line segments.  Line markers are created with marker's
       <b>create</b> operation in the form: <u>pathName</u> <b>marker</b> <b>create</b> <b>line</b> ?<u>option</u> <u>value</u>?...  There may  be  many  <u>option</u>-
       <u>value</u>  pairs, each sets a configuration option for the marker.  These same <u>option</u>-<u>value</u> pairs may be used
       with the marker's <b>configure</b> operation.

       The following options are specific to line markers:

       <b>-dashes</b> <u>dashList</u>
              Sets the dash style of the line. <u>DashList</u> is a list of up to 11 numbers that alternately represent
              the lengths of the dashes and gaps on the line.  Each number  must  be  between  1  and  255.   If
              <u>dashList</u> is <b>""</b>, the marker line will be solid.

       <b>-fill</b> <u>color</u>
              Sets  the  background  color of the line.  This color is used with striped lines (see the <b>-fdashes</b>
              option). If <u>color</u> is the empty string, no background color is drawn (the line will be dashed,  not
              striped).  The default background color is <b>""</b>.

       <b>-linewidth</b> <u>pixels</u>
              Sets the width of the lines.  The default width is <b>0</b>.

       <b>-outline</b> <u>color</u>
              Sets the foreground color of the line. The default value is <b>black</b>.

       <b>-stipple</b> <u>bitmap</u>
              Specifies  a  stipple pattern used to draw the line, rather than a solid line.  <u>Bitmap</u> specifies a
              bitmap to use as the stipple pattern.  If <u>bitmap</u> is <b>""</b>, then the line is drawn in a solid fashion.
              The default is <b>""</b>.

   <b>POLYGON</b> <b>MARKERS</b>
       A polygon marker displays a closed region described as two  or  more  connected  line  segments.   It  is
       assumed  the  first  and  last points are connected.  Polygon markers are created using the marker <b>create</b>
       operation in the form: <u>pathName</u> <b>marker</b> <b>create</b> <b>polygon</b> ?<u>option</u> <u>value</u>?...  There may be  many  <u>option</u>-<u>value</u>
       pairs,  each  sets a configuration option for the marker.  These same <u>option</u>-<u>value</u> pairs may be used with
       the <b>marker</b> <b>configure</b> command to change the marker's configuration.  The following options  are  supported
       for polygon markers:

       <b>-dashes</b> <u>dashList</u>
              Sets  the  dash  style  of the outline of the polygon. <u>DashList</u> is a list of up to 11 numbers that
              alternately represent the lengths of the dashes and gaps on the  outline.   Each  number  must  be
              between 1 and 255. If <u>dashList</u> is <b>""</b>, the outline will be a solid line.

       <b>-fill</b> <u>color</u>
              Sets  the  fill  color  of  the  polygon.   If  <u>color</u>  is  <b>""</b>, then the interior of the polygon is
              transparent.  The default is <b>white</b>.

       <b>-linewidth</b> <u>pixels</u>
              Sets the width of the outline of the polygon. If <u>pixels</u> is zero, no outline is drawn. The  default
              is <b>0</b>.

       <b>-outline</b> <u>color</u>
              Sets  the  color  of  the  outline  of  the polygon.  If the polygon is stippled (see the <b>-stipple</b>
              option), then this represents the foreground color of the stipple.  The default is <b>black</b>.

       <b>-stipple</b> <u>bitmap</u>
              Specifies that the polygon should be drawn with a stippled pattern  rather  than  a  solid  color.
              <u>Bitmap</u>  specifies  a  bitmap  to use as the stipple pattern.  If <u>bitmap</u> is <b>""</b>, then the polygon is
              filled with a solid color (if the <b>-fill</b> option is set).  The default is <b>""</b>.

   <b>TEXT</b> <b>MARKERS</b>
       A text marker displays a string of characters on one or more lines of text.  Embedded newlines cause line
       breaks.  They may be used to annotate regions of the graph.  Text markers are  created  with  the  <b>create</b>
       operation  in  the  form:  <u>pathName</u>  <b>marker</b> <b>create</b> <b>text</b> ?<u>option</u> <u>value</u>?...  There may be many <u>option</u>-<u>value</u>
       pairs, each sets a configuration option for the text marker.  These same <u>option</u>-<u>value</u> pairs may  be  used
       with the marker's <b>configure</b> operation.

       The following options are specific to text markers:

       <b>-anchor</b> <u>anchor</u>
              <u>Anchor</u> tells how to position the text relative to the positioning point for the text. For example,
              if  <u>anchor</u>  is <b>center</b> then the text is centered on the point; if <u>anchor</u> is <b>n</b> then the text will be
              drawn such that the top center point of the rectangular region occupied by the text will be at the
              positioning point.  This default is <b>center</b>.

       <b>-background</b> <u>color</u>
              Same as the <b>-fill</b> option.

       <b>-font</b> <u>fontName</u>
              Specifies the font of the text.  The default is <b>*-Helvetica-Bold-R-Normal-*-120-*</b>.

       <b>-fill</b> <u>color</u>
              Sets the background color of the text.  If <u>color</u> is  the  empty  string,  no  background  will  be
              transparent.  The default background color is <b>""</b>.

       <b>-foreground</b> <u>color</u>
              Same as the <b>-outline</b> option.

       <b>-justify</b> <u>justify</u>
              Specifies  how the text should be justified.  This matters only when the marker contains more than
              one line of text. <u>Justify</u> must be <b>left</b>, <b>right</b>, or <b>center</b>.  The default is <b>center</b>.

       <b>-outline</b> <u>color</u>
              Sets the color of the text. The default value is <b>black</b>.

       <b>-padx</b> <u>pad</u>
              Sets the padding to the left and right exteriors of the text.  <u>Pad</u> can be a list  of  one  or  two
              screen  distances.   If  <u>pad</u>  has  two  elements, the left side of the text is padded by the first
              distance and the right side by the second.  If <u>pad</u> has just one distance, both the left and  right
              sides are padded evenly.  The default is <b>4</b>.

       <b>-pady</b> <u>pad</u>
              Sets  the padding above and below the text.  <u>Pad</u> can be a list of one or two screen distances.  If
              <u>pad</u> has two elements, the area above the text is padded by the first distance and the  area  below
              by the second.  If <u>pad</u> is just one distance, both the top and bottom areas are padded evenly.  The
              default is <b>4</b>.

       <b>-rotate</b> <u>theta</u>
              Specifies the number of degrees to rotate the text.  <u>Theta</u> is a real number representing the angle
              of  rotation.   The  marker  is  first rotated along its center and is then drawn according to its
              anchor position. The default is <b>0.0</b>.

       <b>-text</b> <u>text</u>
              Specifies the text of the marker.  The exact way the text is displayed may be  affected  by  other
              options such as <b>-anchor</b> or <b>-rotate</b>.

   <b>WINDOW</b> <b>MARKERS</b>
       A  window  marker  displays  a  widget at a given position.  Window markers are created with the marker's
       <b>create</b> operation in the form: <u>pathName</u> <b>marker</b> <b>create</b> <b>window</b> ?<u>option</u> <u>value</u>?...  There may be many  <u>option</u>-
       <u>value</u>  pairs, each sets a configuration option for the marker.  These same <u>option</u>-<u>value</u> pairs may be used
       with the marker's <b>configure</b> command.

       The following options are specific to window markers:

       <b>-anchor</b> <u>anchor</u>
              <u>Anchor</u> tells how to position the widget relative to the positioning  point  for  the  widget.  For
              example,  if  <u>anchor</u>  is  <b>center</b> then the widget is centered on the point; if <u>anchor</u> is <b>n</b> then the
              widget will be displayed such that the top center point of the rectangular region occupied by  the
              widget will be at the positioning point.  This option defaults to <b>center</b>.

       <b>-height</b> <u>pixels</u>
              Specifies  the  height to assign to the marker's window.  If this option isn't specified, or if it
              is specified as <b>""</b>, then the window is given whatever height the widget requests internally.

       <b>-width</b> <u>pixels</u>
              Specifies the width to assign to the marker's window.  If this option isn't specified, or if it is
              specified as <b>""</b>, then the window is given whatever width the widget requests internally.

       <b>-window</b> <u>pathName</u>
              Specifies the widget to be managed by the graph.  <u>PathName</u> must be a child of the <b>graph</b> widget.

</pre><h4><b>GRAPH</b> <b>COMPONENT</b> <b>BINDINGS</b></h4><pre>
       Specific graph components, such as elements, markers and legend entries, can have a command trigger  when
       event  occurs  in them, much like canvas items in Tk's canvas widget.  Not all event sequences are valid.
       The only binding events that may be specified are those related to the mouse and keyboard (such as <b>Enter</b>,
       <b>Leave</b>, <b>ButtonPress</b>, <b>Motion</b>, and <b>KeyPress</b>).

       Only one element or marker can be picked during an event.  This means, that if the mouse is directly over
       both an element and a marker, only the uppermost component is  selected.   This  isn't  true  for  legend
       entries.   Both  a legend entry and an element (or marker) binding commands will be invoked if both items
       are picked.

       It is possible for multiple bindings to match a particular event.  This could occur, for example, if  one
       binding is associated with the element name and another is associated with one of the element's tags (see
       the <b>-bindtags</b> option).  When this occurs, all of the matching bindings are invoked.  A binding associated
       with  the  element name is invoked first, followed by one binding for each of the element's bindtags.  If
       there are multiple matching bindings for a single tag, then only the most specific binding is invoked.  A
       continue command in a binding script terminates that script, and a break command terminates  that  script
       and skips any remaining scripts for the event, just as for the bind command.

       The  <b>-bindtags</b>  option for these components controls addition tag names which can be matched.  Implicitly
       elements and markers always have tags matching their names.  Setting the value of  the  <b>-bindtags</b>  option
       doesn't change this.

</pre><h4><b>C</b> <b>LANGUAGE</b> <b>API</b></h4><pre>
       You  can manipulate data elements from the C language.  There may be situations where it is too expensive
       to translate the data values from ASCII strings.  Or you might want  to  read  data  in  a  special  file
       format.

       Data  can  manipulated from the C language using BLT vectors.  You specify the X-Y data coordinates of an
       element as vectors and manipulate the vector from C.  The graph will be redrawn automatically  after  the
       vectors are updated.

       From Tcl, create the vectors and configure the element to use them.

              vector X Y
              .g element configure line1 -xdata X -ydata Y

       To  set data points from C, you pass the values as arrays of doubles using the <b>Blt_ResetVector</b> call.  The
       vector is reset with the new data and at the next idle point (when Tk  re-enters  its  event  loop),  the
       graph will be redrawn automatically.

              #include &lt;tcl.h&gt;
              #include &lt;blt.h&gt;

              register int i;
              Blt_Vector *xVec, *yVec;
              double x[50], y[50];

              /* Get the BLT vectors "X" and "Y" (created above from Tcl) */
              if ((Blt_GetVector(interp, "X", &amp;xVec) != TCL_OK) ||
                  (Blt_GetVector(interp, "Y", &amp;yVec) != TCL_OK)) {
                  return TCL_ERROR;
              }

              for (i = 0; i &lt; 50; i++) {
                  x[i] = i * 0.02;
                  y[i] = sin(x[i]);
              }

              /* Put the data into BLT vectors */
              if ((Blt_ResetVector(xVec, x, 50, 50, TCL_VOLATILE) != TCL_OK) ||
                  (Blt_ResetVector(yVec, y, 50, 50, TCL_VOLATILE) != TCL_OK)) {
                 return TCL_ERROR;
              }

       See the <b>vector</b> manual page for more details.

</pre><h4><b>SPEED</b> <b>TIPS</b></h4><pre>
       There  may  be  cases  where  the graph needs to be drawn and updated as quickly as possible.  If drawing
       speed becomes a big problem, here are a few tips to speed up displays.

       • Try to minimize the number of data points.  The more data points the looked at, the more work the graph
         must do.

       • If your data is generated as floating point values, the time required to convert the data values to and
         from ASCII strings can be significant, especially when there any many data points.  You can  avoid  the
         redundant string-to-decimal conversions using the C API to BLT vectors.

       • Data  elements  without  symbols  are  drawn  faster than with symbols.  Set the data element's <b>-symbol</b>
         option to <b>none</b>.  If you need to draw symbols, try using the simple symbols such as <b>splus</b> and <b>scross</b>.

       • Don't stipple or dash the element.  Solid lines are much faster.

       • If you update data elements frequently, try turning off the widget's <b>-bufferelements</b> option.  When  the
         graph  is first displayed, it draws data elements into an internal pixmap.  The pixmap acts as a cache,
         so that when the graph needs to be redrawn again, and the data  elements  or  coordinate  axes  haven't
         changed,  the  pixmap  is  simply  copied  to the screen.  This is especially useful when you are using
         markers to highlight points and regions on the graph.  But if the graph is updated frequently, changing
         either the element data or coordinate axes, the buffering becomes redundant.

</pre><h4><b>LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Auto-scale routines do not use requested min/max limits as boundaries when the  axis  is  logarithmically
       scaled.

       The  PostScript  output  generated  for polygons with more than 1500 points may exceed the limits of some
       printers (See PostScript Language Reference Manual, page 568).  The work-around is to break  the  polygon
       into separate pieces.
