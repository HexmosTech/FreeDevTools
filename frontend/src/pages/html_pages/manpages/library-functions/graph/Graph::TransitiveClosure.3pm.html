       Graph::TransitiveClosure - create and query transitive closure of graph

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Graph::TransitiveClosure;
           use Graph::Directed; # or Undirected

           my $g  = Graph::Directed-&gt;new;
           $g-&gt;add_...(); # build $g

           # Compute the transitive closure graph.
           my $tcg = Graph::TransitiveClosure-&gt;new($g);
           $tcg-&gt;is_reachable($u, $v) # Identical to $tcg-&gt;has_edge($u, $v)

           # Being reflexive is the default, meaning that null transitions
           # (transitions from a vertex to the same vertex) are included.
           my $tcg = Graph::TransitiveClosure-&gt;new($g, reflexive =&gt; 1);
           my $tcg = Graph::TransitiveClosure-&gt;new($g, reflexive =&gt; 0);

           # is_reachable(u, v) is always reflexive.
           $tcg-&gt;is_reachable($u, $v)

           # You can check any graph for transitivity.
           $g-&gt;is_transitive()

           my $tcg = Graph::TransitiveClosure-&gt;new($g, path_length =&gt; 1);
           $tcg-&gt;path_length($u, $v)

           # path_vertices is on by default so this is a no-op.
           my $tcg = Graph::TransitiveClosure-&gt;new($g, path_vertices =&gt; 1);
           $tcg-&gt;path_vertices($u, $v)

           # see how many paths exist from $u to $v
           my $tcg = Graph::TransitiveClosure-&gt;new($g, path_count =&gt; 1);
           $tcg-&gt;path_length($u, $v)

           # Both path_length and path_vertices.
           my $tcg = Graph::TransitiveClosure-&gt;new($g, path =&gt; 1);
           $tcg-&gt;path_vertices($u, $v)
           $tcg-&gt;length($u, $v)

           my $tcg = Graph::TransitiveClosure-&gt;new($g, attribute_name =&gt; 'length');
           $tcg-&gt;path_length($u, $v)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       You can use "Graph::TransitiveClosure" to compute the transitive closure graph of a graph and optionally
       also the minimum paths (lengths and vertices) between vertices, and after that query the transitiveness
       between vertices by using the is_reachable() and is_transitive() methods, and the paths by using the
       path_length() and path_vertices() methods.

       For further documentation, see the Graph::TransitiveClosure::Matrix.

   <b>Class</b> <b>Methods</b>
       new($g, %opt)
           Construct  a new transitive closure object.  Note that strictly speaking the returned object is not a
           graph; it is a graph plus other stuff.  But you should be able to use it as a graph plus a couple  of
           methods inherited from the Graph::TransitiveClosure::Matrix class.

   <b>Object</b> <b>Methods</b>
       These are only the methods 'native' to the class: see Graph::TransitiveClosure::Matrix for more.

       is_transitive($g)
           Return true if the Graph $g is transitive.

       transitive_closure_matrix
           Return the transitive closure matrix of the transitive closure object.
