</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       GD::Graph - Graph Plotting Module for Perl 5

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       use GD::Graph::moduleName;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>GD::Graph</b> is a <u>perl5</u> module to create charts using the GD module.  The following classes for graphs with
       axes are defined:

       "GD::Graph::lines"
           Create a line chart.

       "GD::Graph::bars" and "GD::Graph::hbars"
           Create a bar chart with vertical or horizontal bars.

       "GD::Graph::points"
           Create an chart, displaying the data as points.

       "GD::Graph::linespoints"
           Combination of lines and points.

       "GD::Graph::area"
           Create a graph, representing the data as areas under a line.

       "GD::Graph::mixed"
           Create  a  mixed type graph, any combination of the above. At the moment this is fairly limited. Some
           of the options that can be used with some of the individual graph types won't  work  very  well.  Bar
           graphs drawn after lines or points graphs may obscure the earlier data, and specifying bar_width will
           not produce the results you probably expected.

       Additional types:

       "GD::Graph::pie"
           Create a pie chart.

</pre><h4><b>DISTRIBUTION</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>2023</b> <b>Update</b>
       This  new  release  fixes  some tests that started to fail based on changes in dependencies. We hope this
       gets all tests passing again so users can install cleanly.

       The new active repo is here: &lt;https://github.com/bestpractical/gdgraph&gt;.

       You can continue to use &lt;https://rt.cpan.org&gt; for bug reports.

   <b>Status</b> <b>from</b> <b>2013</b>
       Distribution has no releases since 2007. It has new maintainer starting of 1.45 and my plan  is  to  keep
       modules backwards compatible as much as possible, fix bugs with test cases, apply patches and release new
       versions to the CPAN.

       I  got  repository  from  Martien  without  Benjamin's  work,  Benjamin  couldn't find his repository, so
       everything   else   is   imported   from   CPAN    and    BackPAN.     Now    it's    all    on    github
       &lt;https://github.com/ruz/GDGraph&gt;.  May  be  at  some  point  Benjamin will find his VCS backup and we can
       restore full history.

       Release 1.44_01 (development release) was released in 2007 by Benjamin, but never  made  into  production
       version.  This  dev  version contains very nice changes (truecolor, anti-aliasing and alpha support), but
       due to nature of how GD and GD::Graph works authors had to add third optional argument (truecolor) to all
       constructors in GD::Graph modules. I think that this should be and  can  be  adjusted  to  receive  named
       arguments  in  constructor and still be backwards compatible. If you were using that dev release and want
       to fast forward inclusion of this work into production release then contact <a href="mailto:ruz@cpan.org">ruz@cpan.org</a>

       Martien also has changes in his repository that were never published to CPAN. These are smaller and  well
       isolated, so I can merge them faster.

       My  goal  at  this  moment is to merge existing versions together, get rid of CVS reminders, do some repo
       cleanup, review existing tickets on rt.cpan.org. Join if you want to help.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       See the samples directory in the distribution, and read the Makefile there.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       Fill an array of arrays with the x values and the values of the data sets.  Make sure that every array is
       the same size, otherwise <u>GD::Graph</u> will complain and refuse to compile the graph.

         @data = (
           ["1st","2nd","3rd","4th","5th","6th","7th", "8th", "9th"],
           [    1,    2,    5,    6,    3,  1.5,    1,     3,     4],
           [ sort { $a &lt;=&gt; $b } (1, 2, 5, 6, 3, 1.5, 1, 3, 4) ]
         );

       If you don't have a value for a point in a certain dataset, you can use <b>undef</b>,  and  the  point  will  be
       skipped.

       Create  a  new  <u>GD::Graph</u> object by calling the <u>new</u> method on the graph type you want to create (<u>chart</u> is
       <u>bars</u>, <u>hbars</u>, <u>lines</u>, <u>points</u>, <u>linespoints</u>, <u>mixed</u> or <u>pie</u>).

         my $graph = GD::Graph::chart-&gt;new(400, 300);

       Set the graph options.

         $graph-&gt;set(
             x_label           =&gt; 'X Label',
             y_label           =&gt; 'Y label',
             title             =&gt; 'Some simple graph',
             y_max_value       =&gt; 8,
             y_tick_number     =&gt; 8,
             y_label_skip      =&gt; 2
         ) or die $graph-&gt;error;

       and plot the graph.

         my $gd = $graph-&gt;plot(\@data) or die $graph-&gt;error;

       Then do whatever your current version of GD allows you to do to save the file. For versions of  GD  older
       than 1.19 (or more recent than 2.15), you'd do something like:

         open(IMG, '&gt;file.gif') or die $!;
         binmode IMG;
         print IMG $gd-&gt;gif;
         close IMG;

       and for newer versions (1.20 and up) you'd write

         open(IMG, '&gt;file.png') or die $!;
         binmode IMG;
         print IMG $gd-&gt;png;

       or

         open(IMG, '&gt;file.gd2') or die $!;
         binmode IMG;
         print IMG $gd-&gt;gd2;

       Then  there's also of course the possibility of using a shorter version (for each of the export functions
       that GD supports):

         print IMG $graph-&gt;plot(\@data)-&gt;gif;
         print IMG $graph-&gt;plot(\@data)-&gt;png;
         print IMG $graph-&gt;plot(\@data)-&gt;gd;
         print IMG $graph-&gt;plot(\@data)-&gt;gd2;

       If you want to write something that doesn't require your code to 'know' whether to use gif  or  png,  you
       could do something like:

         if ($gd-&gt;can('png')) { # blabla }

       or you can use the convenience method "export_format":

         my $format = $graph-&gt;export_format;
         open(IMG, "&gt;file.$format") or die $!;
         binmode IMG;
         print IMG $graph-&gt;plot(\@data)-&gt;$format();
         close IMG;

       or for CGI programs:

         use CGI qw(:standard);
         #...
         my $format = $graph-&gt;export_format;
         print header("image/$format");
         binmode STDOUT;
         print $graph-&gt;plot(\@data)-&gt;$format();

       (the  parentheses  after  $format  are necessary, to help the compiler decide that you mean a method name
       there)

       See under "SEE ALSO" for references to other documentation, especially the FAQ.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Methods</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>graphs</b>
       GD::Graph::chart-&gt;new([width,height])
           Create a new object $graph with optional width and height.  Default width =  400,  default  height  =
           300. <u>chart</u> is either <u>bars</u>, <u>lines</u>, <u>points</u>, <u>linespoints</u>, <u>area</u>, <u>mixed</u> or <u>pie</u>.

       $graph-&gt;set_text_clr(<u>colour</u> <u>name</u>)
           Set the colour of the text. This will set the colour of the titles, labels, and axis labels to <u>colour</u>
           <u>name</u>. Also see the options <u>textclr</u>, <u>labelclr</u> and <u>axislabelclr</u>.

       $graph-&gt;set_title_font(font specification)
           Set the font that will be used for the title of the chart.  See "FONTS".

       $graph-&gt;plot(<u>\@data</u>)
           Plot the chart, and return the GD::Image object.

       $graph-&gt;set(attrib1 =&gt; value1, attrib2 =&gt; value2 ...)
           Set chart options. See OPTIONS section.

       $graph-&gt;get(attrib1, attrib2)
           Returns  a  list  of  the  values of the attributes. In scalar context returns the value of the first
           attribute only.

       $graph-&gt;<b>gd()</b>
           Get the GD::Image object that is going to be used to draw on. You can do this either before or  after
           calling the plot method, to do your own drawing.

           <b>Note:</b>  as  of  the  current  version, this GD::Image object will always be palette-based, even if the
           installed version of GD supports true-color images.

           Note also that if you draw  on  the  GD::Image  object  before  calling  the  plot  method,  you  are
           responsible for making sure that the background colour is correct and for setting transparency.

       $graph-&gt;<b>export_format()</b>
           Query  the  export  format  of  the GD library in use.  In scalar context, it returns 'gif', 'png' or
           undefined, which is sufficient for most people's use. In a list context, it returns a list of all the
           formats that are supported by the current version of GD. It can be called as a class or object method

       $graph-&gt;<b>can_do_ttf()</b>
           Returns true if the current GD library supports TrueType fonts, False otherwise. Can also  be  called
           as a class method or static method.

   <b>Methods</b> <b>for</b> <b>Pie</b> <b>charts</b>
       $graph-&gt;set_label_font(font specification)
       $graph-&gt;set_value_font(font specification)
           Set the font that will be used for the label of the pie or the values on the pie.  See "FONTS".

   <b>Methods</b> <b>for</b> <b>charts</b> <b>with</b> <b>axes.</b>
       $graph-&gt;set_x_label_font(font specification)
       $graph-&gt;set_y_label_font(font specification)
       $graph-&gt;set_x_axis_font(font specification)
       $graph-&gt;set_y_axis_font(font specification)
       $graph-&gt;set_values_font(font specification)
           Set  the  font  for the x and y axis label, the x and y axis value labels, and for the values printed
           above the data points.  See "FONTS".

       $graph-&gt;get_hotspot($dataset, $point)
           <b>Experimental</b>: Return a coordinate specification for a point in a dataset.  Returns  a  list.  If  the
           point  is  not  specified,  returns  a list of array references for all points in the dataset. If the
           dataset is also not specified, returns a list of array references for each data set.  See "HOTSPOTS".

       $graph-&gt;get_feature_coordinates($feature_name)
           <b>Experimental</b>: Return a coordinate specification for a  certain  feature  in  the  chart.   Currently,
           features  that  are  defined  are  <u>axes</u>,  the  coordinates of the rectangle within the axes; <u>x_label</u>,
           <u>y1_label</u> and <u>y2_label</u>, the labels printed along the axes, with  <u>y_label</u>  provided  as  an  alias  for
           <u>y1_label</u>; and <u>title</u> which is the title text box.  See "HOTSPOTS".

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Options</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>graphs</b>
       width, height
           The  width  and height of the canvas in pixels Default: 400 x 300.  <b>NB</b> At the moment, these are read-
           only options. If you want to set the size of a graph, you will have to do that with the <u>new</u> method.

       t_margin, b_margin, l_margin, r_margin
           Top, bottom, left and right margin of the canvas. These margins will be left blank.  Default:  0  for
           all.

       logo
           Name  of  a logo file. Generally, this should be the same format as your version of GD exports images
           in.  Currently, this file may be in any format that GD can import, but please see GD if  you  use  an
           XPM file and get unexpected results.

           Default: no logo.

       logo_resize, logo_position
           Factor  to  resize  the  logo  by,  and  the  position on the canvas of the logo. Possible values for
           logo_position are 'LL', 'LR', 'UL', and 'UR'.  (lower and upper left and right).  Default: 'LR'.

       transparent
           If set to a true value, the produced image will have the background colour marked as transparent (see
           also option <u>bgclr</u>).  Default: 1.

       interlaced
           If set to a true value, the produced image will be interlaced.  Default: 1.

           <b>Note</b>: versions of GD higher than 2.0 (that is, since GIF support was  restored  after  being  removed
           owing  to  patent  issues)  do not support interlacing of GIF images.  Support for interlaced PNG and
           progressive JPEG images remains available using this option.

   <b>Colours</b>
       bgclr, fgclr, boxclr, accentclr, shadowclr
           Drawing colours used for the chart: background, foreground (axes and grid),  axis  box  fill  colour,
           accents (bar, area and pie outlines), and shadow (currently only for bars).

           All  colours  should  have  a  valid  value  as  described  in "COLOURS", except boxclr, which can be
           undefined, in which case the box will not be filled.

       shadow_depth
           Depth of a shadow, positive for right/down shadow, negative for  left/up  shadow,  0  for  no  shadow
           (default).  Also see the "shadowclr" and "bar_spacing" options.

       labelclr, axislabelclr, legendclr, valuesclr, textclr
           Text  Colours  used  for  the chart: label (labels for the axes or pie), axis label (misnomer: values
           printed along the axes, or on a pie slice), legend text, shown values text, and all other text.

           All colours should have a valid value as described in "COLOURS".

       dclrs (short for datacolours)
           This controls the colours for the bars, lines, markers, or pie slices.  This should be a reference to
           an array of colour names as defined in GD::Graph::colour ("perldoc GD::Graph::colour" for  the  names
           available).

               $graph-&gt;set( dclrs =&gt; [ qw(green pink blue cyan) ] );

           The first (fifth, ninth) data set will be green, the next pink, etc.

           A  colour  can  be  "undef",  in  which  case the data set will not be drawn.  This can be useful for
           cumulative bar sets where you want certain data series (often the first one) not to  show  up,  which
           can be used to emulate error bars (see examples 1-7 and 6-3 in the distribution).

           Default: [ qw(lred lgreen lblue lyellow lpurple cyan lorange) ]

       borderclrs
           This  controls  the colours of the borders of the bars data sets. Like dclrs, it is a reference to an
           array of colour names as defined in GD::Graph::colour.  Setting a border colour to "undef" means  the
           border will not be drawn.

       cycle_clrs
           If  set  to  a  true  value, bars will not have a colour from "dclrs" per dataset, but per point. The
           colour sequence will be identical for each dataset. Note that this may have a weird effect if you are
           drawing more than one data set. If this is set to a value larger than 1 the border colour of the bars
           will cycle through the colours in "borderclrs".

       accent_treshold
           Not really a colour, but it does control a visual aspect: Accents on bars are  only  drawn  when  the
           width  of  a  bar  is larger than this number of pixels. Accents inside areas are only drawn when the
           horizontal distance between points is larger than this number.  Default 4

   <b>Options</b> <b>for</b> <b>graphs</b> <b>with</b> <b>axes.</b>
       options for <u>bars</u>, <u>lines</u>, <u>points</u>, <u>linespoints</u>, <u>mixed</u> and <u>area</u> charts.

       x_label, y_label
           The labels to be printed next to, or just below, the axes. Note that if you use the  two_axes  option
           that you need to use y1_label and y2_label.

       long_ticks, tick_length
           If <u>long_ticks</u> is a true value, ticks will be drawn the same length as the axes.  Otherwise ticks will
           be  drawn  with  length  <u>tick_length</u>. if <u>tick_length</u> is negative, the ticks will be drawn outside the
           axes.  Default: long_ticks = 0, tick_length = 4.

           These attributes can also be set for  x  and  y  axes  separately  with  x_long_ticks,  y_long_ticks,
           x_tick_length and y_tick_length.

       x_ticks
           If  <u>x_ticks</u>  is  a  true  value,  ticks will be drawn for the x axis.  These ticks are subject to the
           values of <u>long_ticks</u> and <u>tick_length</u>.  Default: 1.

       y_tick_number
           Number of ticks to print for the Y axis. Use this, together with <u>y_label_skip</u> to control the look  of
           ticks on the y axis.  Default: 5.

       y_number_format
           This  can  be either a string, or a reference to a subroutine. If it is a string, it will be taken to
           be the first argument to a sprintf, with the value as the second argument:

               $label = sprintf( $s-&gt;{y_number_format}, $value );

           If it is a code reference, it will be executed with the value as the argument:

               $label = &amp;{$s-&gt;{y_number_format}}($value);

           This can be useful, for example, if you want to reformat your values in currency, with the - sign  in
           the right spot. Something like:

               sub y_format
               {
                   my $value = shift;
                   my $ret;

                   if ($value &gt;= 0)
                   {
                       $ret = sprintf("\$%d", $value * $refit);
                   }
                   else
                   {
                       $ret = sprintf("-\$%d", abs($value) * $refit);
                   }

                   return $ret;
               }

               $graph-&gt;set( 'y_number_format' =&gt; \&amp;y_format );

           (Yes, I know this can be much shorter and more concise)

           Default: undef.

       y1_number_format, y2_number_format
           As with <u>y_number_format</u>, these can be either a string, or a reference to a subroutine. These are used
           as formats for graphs with two y-axis scales so that independent formats can be used.

           For compatibility purposes, each of these will fall back on <u>y_number_format</u> if not specified.

           Default: undef for both.

       x_label_skip, y_label_skip
           Print  every <u>x_label_skip</u>th number under the tick on the x axis, and every <u>y_label_skip</u>th number next
           to the tick on the y axis.  Default: 1 for both.

       x_last_label_skip
           By default, when <u>x_label_skip</u> is set to something higher than 1, the last label on the axis  will  be
           printed,  even  when it doesn't belong to the normal series that should be printed. Setting this to a
           true value prevents that.

           For example, when your X values are the months of the year (i.e. Jan - Dec), and you set <u>x_label_skip</u>
           to 3, the months printed on the axis will be Jan, Apr, Jul, Oct and Dec; even  though  Dec  does  not
           really   belong  to  that  sequence.  If  you  do  not  like  the  last  month  to  be  printed,  set
           <u>x_last_label_skip</u> to a true value.

           This option has no effect in other circumstances. Also see <u>x_tick_offset</u> for another method  to  make
           this look better.  Default: 0 for both

       x_tick_offset
           When  <u>x_label_skip</u>  is  used,  this  will  skip  the  first <u>x_tick_offset</u> values in the labels before
           starting to print. Let me give an example.  If you have a series of X labels like

             qw(Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec)

           and you set <u>x_label_skip</u> to 3, you will see ticks on the X axis for Jan, Apr, Jul, Oct and Dec.  This
           is  not always what is wanted. If you set <u>x_tick_offset</u> to 1, you get Feb, May, Aug, Nov and Dec, and
           if you set it to 2, you get Mar, Jun Sep and Dec, and  this  last  one  definitely  looks  better.  A
           combination of 6 and 5 also works nice for months.

           Note that the value for <u>x_tick_offset</u> is periodical. This means that it will have the same effect for
           each integer n in <u>x_tick_offset</u> + n * <u>x_label_skip</u>.

           Also see <u>x_last_label_skip</u> for another method to influence this.

       x_all_ticks
           Force a print of all the x ticks, even if x_label_skip is set to a value Default: 0.

       x_label_position
           Controls  the  position  of  the  X axis label (title). The value for this should be between 0 and 1,
           where 0 means aligned to the left, 1 means aligned to the right, and 1/2  means  centered.   Default:
           3/4

       y_label_position
           Controls  the  position of both Y axis labels (titles). The value for this should be between 0 and 1,
           where 0 means aligned to the bottom, 1 means aligned to the top, and 1/2  means  centered.   Default:
           1/2

       x_labels_vertical
           If  set  to  a  true  value, the X axis labels will be printed vertically.  This can be handy in case
           these labels get very long.  Default: 0.

       x_plot_values, y_plot_values
           If set to a true value, the values of the ticks on the x or y axes will be plotted next to the  tick.
           Also see <u>x_label_skip,</u> <u>y_label_skip</u>.  Default: 1 for both.

       box_axis
           Draw the axes as a box, if true.  Default: 1.

       no_axes
           Draw  no  axes  at all. If this is set to undef, all axes are drawn. If it is set to 0, the zero axis
           will be drawn, <u>for</u> <u>bar</u> <u>charts</u> <u>only</u>.  If this is set to a true value, no axes will be  drawn  at  all.
           Value  labels  on  the  axes  and  ticks will also not be drawn, but axis lables are drawn.  Default:
           undef.

       two_axes
           Use two separate axes for the first and second data set. The first data set will be set  against  the
           left  axis,  the  second  against  the right axis.  If more than two data sets are being plotted, the
           use_axis option should be used to specify which data sets use which axis.

           Note that if you use this option, that you need  to  use  y1_label  and  y2_label,  instead  of  just
           y_label,  if  you  want  the  two axes to have different labels. The same goes for some other options
           starting with the letter 'y' and an underscore.

           Default: 0.

       use_axis
           If two y-axes are in use and more than two datasets are  specified,  set  this  option  to  an  array
           reference  containing a value of 1 or 2 (for the left and right scales respectively) for each dataset
           being plotted.  That is, to plot three datasets with the second on a different scale than  the  first
           and third, set this to "[1,2,1]".

           Default: [1,2].

       zero_axis
           If set to a true value, the axis for y values of 0 will always be drawn. This might be useful in case
           your  graph  contains negative values, but you want it to be clear where the zero value is. (see also
           <u>zero_axis_only</u> and <u>box_axes</u>).  Default: 0.

       zero_axis_only
           If set to a true value, the zero axis will be drawn (see <u>zero_axis</u>), and no axis at the bottom of the
           graph will be drawn.  The labels for X values will be placed on the zero axis.  Default: 0.

       y_max_value, y_min_value
           Maximum and minimum value displayed on the y axis.

           The range (y_min_value..y_max_value) has to include all the values of the data points,  or  <u>GD::Graph</u>
           will die with a message.

           For  bar  and  area graphs, the range (y_min_value..y_max_value) has to include 0. If it doesn't, the
           values will be adapted before attempting to draw the graph.

           Default: Computed from data sets.

       y1_max_value, y1_min_value, y2_max_value, y2_min_value
           Maximum and minimum values for left (y1) and right (y2) axes when <b>two_axes</b>  is  a  true  value.  Take
           precedence over y_min_value and y_max_value.

           By  default  0  of  the  left axis is aligned with 0 of the right axis, it's not true if any of these
           options is defined.

           Otherwise behaviour and default values are as with y_max_value and y_min_value.

       y_min_range, y1_min_range, y2_min_range
           Minimal range between min and max values on y axis that is used to adjust  computed  y_min_value  and
           y_max_value.

           <b>NOTE</b>  that  author  of  the  feature implemented this for two_axes case only, patches are wellcome to
           expand over one y axis.

           If two_axes is a true value, then y1_min_range and  y2_min_range  take  precedence  over  y_min_range
           value.

           Default: undef

       axis_space
           This space will be left blank between the axes and the tick value text.  Default: 4.

       text_space
           This  space  will  be left open between text elements and the graph (text elements are title and axis
           labels.

           Default: 8.

       cumulate
           If this attribute is set to a true value, the data sets will be cumulated. This means that they  will
           be  stacked  on  top  of  each other. A side effect of this is that "overwrite" will be set to a true
           value.

           Notes: This only works for bar and area charts at the moment.

           If you have negative values in your data sets, setting this option  might  produce  odd  results.  Of
           course, the graph itself would be quite meaningless.

       overwrite
           If  set to 0, bars of different data sets will be drawn next to each other. If set to 1, they will be
           drawn in front of each other.  Default: 0.

           Note: Setting overwrite to 2 to produce cumulative sets is deprecated, and may  disappear  in  future
           versions of GD::Graph.  Instead see the "cumulate" attribute.

       correct_width
           If  this  is  set  to  a true value and "x_tick_number" is false, then the width of the graph (or the
           height for rotated graphs like "GD::Graph::hbar") will be recalculated to make sure  that  each  data
           point is exactly an integer number of pixels wide. You probably never want to fiddle with this.

           When  this  value  is true, you will need to make sure that the number of data points is smaller than
           the number of pixels in the plotting area of the chart. If you get errors saying that your horizontal
           size if too small, you may need to manually switch this off, or consider using something else than  a
           bar type for your chart.

           Default: 1 for bar, calculated at runtime for mixed charts, 0 for others.

   <b>Plotting</b> <b>data</b> <b>point</b> <b>values</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>data</b> <b>point</b>
       Sometimes  you  will  want  to  plot  the  value of a data point or bar above the data point for clarity.
       GD::Graph allows you to control this in a generic manner, or even down to the single point.

       show_values
           Set this to 1 to display the value of each data point above the point or bar  itself.  No  effort  is
           being made to ensure that there is enough space for the text.

           Set  this  to  a  GD::Graph::Data  object,  or  an  array  reference of the same shape, with the same
           dimensions as your data object that you pass in to the plot method. The reason  for  this  option  is
           that  it allows you to make a copy of your data set, and selectively set points to "undef" to disable
           plotting of them.

             my $data = GD::Graph::Data-&gt;new(
               [ [ 'A', 'B', 'C' ], [ 1, 2, 3 ], [ 11, 12, 13 ] ]);
             my $values = $data-&gt;copy;
             $values-&gt;set_y(1, 1, undef);
             $values-&gt;set_y(2, 0, undef);

             $graph-&gt;set(show_values =&gt; $values);
             $graph-&gt;plot($data);

           Default: 0.

       values_vertical
           If set to a true value, the values will be printed vertically, instead of horizontally. This  can  be
           handy if the values are long numbers.  Default: 0.

       values_space
           Space to insert between the data point and the value to print.  Default: 4.

       values_format
           How to format the values for display. See y_number_format for more information.  Default: undef.

       hide_overlapping_values
           If  set to a true value, the values that goes out of graph space are hidden.  Option is <b>EXPERIMENTAL</b>,
           works only for bars, text still can overlap with other bars and labels, most useful only with text in
           the same direction as bars.  Default: undef

   <b>Options</b> <b>for</b> <b>graphs</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>numerical</b> <b>X</b> <b>axis</b>
       First of all: GD::Graph does <b>not</b> support numerical x axis the way it should. Data for X  axes  should  be
       equally  spaced.  That  understood: There is some support to make the printing of graphs with numerical X
       axis values a bit better, thanks to Scott Prahl. If the option "x_tick_number" is set to a defined value,
       GD::Graph will attempt to treat the X data as numerical.

       Extra options are:

       x_tick_number
           If set to <u>'auto'</u>, GD::Graph will attempt to format the X axis in a nice way, based on  the  actual  X
           values.  If set to a number, that's the number of ticks you will get. If set to undef, GD::Graph will
           treat X data as labels.  Default: undef.

       x_min_value, x_max_value
           The minimum and maximum value to use for the X axis.  Default: computed.

       x_min_range
           Minimal range of x axis.

           Default: undef

       x_number_format
           See y_number_format

       x_label_skip
           See y_label_skip

   <b>Options</b> <b>for</b> <b>graphs</b> <b>with</b> <b>bars</b>
       bar_width
           The width of a bar in pixels. Also see "bar_spacing".  Use "bar_width" If you  want  to  have  fixed-
           width  bars, no matter how wide the chart gets.  Default: as wide as possible, within the constraints
           of the chart size and "bar_spacing" setting.

       bar_spacing
           Number of pixels to leave open between bars. This works well in most cases, but on some platforms,  a
           value  of 1 will be rounded off to 0.  Use "bar_spacing" to get a fixed amount of space between bars,
           with variable bar widths, depending on the width of the chart.  Note that if "bar_width" is also set,
           this setting will be ignored, and automatically calculated.  Default: 0

       bargroup_spacing
           Number of pixels (in addition to whatever is specified in "bar_spacing") to leave between  groups  of
           bars  when multiple datasets are being displayed.  Unlike "bar_spacing", however, this parameter will
           hold its value if "bar_width" is set.

   <b>Options</b> <b>for</b> <b>graphs</b> <b>with</b> <b>lines</b>
       line_types
           Which line types to use for <u>lines</u> and <u>linespoints</u> graphs. This should be a reference to an  array  of
           numbers:

               $graph-&gt;set( line_types =&gt; [3, 2, 4] );

           Available line types are 1: solid, 2: dashed, 3: dotted, 4: dot-dashed.

           Default: [1] (always use solid)

       line_type_scale
           Controls the length of the dashes in the line types. default: 6.

       line_width
           The width of the line used in <u>lines</u> and <u>linespoints</u> graphs, in pixels.  Default: 1.

       skip_undef
           For  all  other axes graph types, the default behaviour is (by their nature) to not draw a point when
           the Y value is "undef". For line charts the point gets skipped as well, but the line is drawn between
           the points n-1 to n+1 directly. If "skip_undef" has a true value, there will be a gap  in  the  chart
           where a Y value is undefined.

           Note  that  a line will not be drawn unless there are <u>at</u> <u>least</u> <u>two</u> consecutive data points exist that
           have a defined value. The following data set will only plot a very short  line  towards  the  end  if
           "skip_undef" is set:

             @data = (
               [ qw( Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct ) ],
               [ 1, undef, 2, undef, 3, undef, 4, undef, 5, 6 ]
             );

           This  option  is  useful when you have a consecutive gap in your data, or with linespoints charts. If
           you have data where you have intermittent gaps, be careful when you use this.  Default value: 0

   <b>Options</b> <b>for</b> <b>graphs</b> <b>with</b> <b>points</b>
       markers
           This controls the order of markers in <u>points</u> and <u>linespoints</u> graphs.  This should be a  reference  to
           an array of numbers:

               $graph-&gt;set( markers =&gt; [3, 5, 6] );

           Available  markers  are: 1: filled square, 2: open square, 3: horizontal cross, 4: diagonal cross, 5:
           filled diamond, 6: open diamond, 7: filled circle, 8: open circle, 9: horizontal line,  10:  vertical
           line.  Note that the last two are not part of the default list.

           Default: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]

       marker_size
           The size of the markers used in <u>points</u> and <u>linespoints</u> graphs, in pixels.  Default: 4.

   <b>Options</b> <b>for</b> <b>mixed</b> <b>graphs</b>
       types
           A reference to an array with graph types, in the same order as the data sets. Possible values are:

             $graph-&gt;set( types =&gt; [qw(lines bars points area linespoints)] );
             $graph-&gt;set( types =&gt; ['lines', undef, undef, 'bars'] );

           values that are undefined or unknown will be set to "default_type".

           Default: all set to "default_type"

       default_type
           The  type  of  graph to draw for data sets that either have no type set, or that have an unknown type
           set.

           Default: lines

   <b>Graph</b> <b>legends</b> <b>(axestype</b> <b>graphs</b> <b>only)</b>
       At the moment legend support is minimal.

       <b>Methods</b>

       $graph-&gt;set_legend(<u>@legend_keys</u>);
           Sets the keys for the legend. The elements of @legend_keys correspond to the data sets as provided to
           <u><b>plot()</b></u>.

           If a key is <u>undef</u> or an empty string, the legend entry will be skipped.

       $graph-&gt;set_legend_font(<u>font</u> <u>name</u>);
           Sets the font for the legend text (see "FONTS").  Default: GD::gdTinyFont.

       <b>Options</b>

       legend_placement
           Where to put the legend. This should be a two letter key of  the  form:  'B[LCR]|R[TCB]'.  The  first
           letter  indicates  the placement (<u>B</u>ottom or <u>R</u>ight), and the second letter the alignment (<u>L</u>eft, <u>R</u>ight,
           <u>C</u>enter, <u>T</u>op, or <u>B</u>ottom).  Default: 'BC'

           If the legend is placed at the bottom, some calculations will be made to ensure that  there  is  some
           'intelligent'  wrapping  going  on.  if the legend is placed at the right, all entries will be placed
           below each other.

       legend_spacing
           The number of pixels to place around a legend item, and between  a  legend  'marker'  and  the  text.
           Default: 4

       legend_marker_width, legend_marker_height
           The width and height of a legend 'marker' in pixels.  Defaults: 12, 8

       lg_cols
           If you, for some reason, need to force the legend at the bottom to have a specific number of columns,
           you can use this.  Default: computed

   <b>Options</b> <b>for</b> <b>pie</b> <b>graphs</b>
       3d  If set to a true value, the pie chart will be drawn with a 3d look.  Default: 1.

       pie_height
           The thickness of the pie when <u>3d</u> is true.  Default: 0.1 x height.

       start_angle
           The  angle  at  which  the  first  data  slice  will  be displayed, with 0 degrees being "6 o'clock".
           Default: 0.

       suppress_angle
           If a pie slice is smaller than this angle (in degrees), a label will not be drawn on it. Default: 0.

       label
           Print this label below the pie. Default: undef.

</pre><h4><b>COLOURS</b></h4><pre>
       All references to colours in the options for this module have been shortened to clr. The main reason  for
       this was that I didn't want to support two spellings for the same word ('colour' and 'color')

       Wherever  a  colour  is  required,  a  colour  name  should  be  used from the package GD::Graph::colour.
       "perldoc GD::Graph::colour" should give you the documentation  for  that  module,  containing  all  valid
       colour names. I will probably change this to read the systems rgb.txt file if it is available.

</pre><h4><b>FONTS</b></h4><pre>
       Depending  on your version of GD, this accepts both GD builtin fonts or the name of a TrueType font file.
       In the case of a TrueType font, you must specify the font size. See GD::Text for more details  and  other
       things, since all font handling in GD::Graph is delegated to there.

       Examples:

           $graph-&gt;set_title_font('/fonts/arial.ttf', 18);
           $graph-&gt;set_legend_font(gdTinyFont);
           $graph-&gt;set_legend_font(
               ['verdana', 'arial', gdMediumBoldFont], 12)

       (The above discussion is based on GD::Text 0.65. Older versions have more restrictive behaviour).

</pre><h4><b>HOTSPOTS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Note</u>  <u>that</u> <u>this</u> <u>is</u> <u>an</u> <u>experimental</u> <u>feature,</u> <u>and</u> <u>its</u> <u>interface</u> <u>may,</u> <u>and</u> <u>likely</u> <u>will,</u> <u>change</u> <u>in</u> <u>the</u> <u>future.</u>
       <u>It</u> <u>currently</u> <u>does</u> <u>not</u> <u>work</u> <u>for</u> <u>area</u> <u>charts</u> <u>or</u> <u>pie</u> <u>charts.</u>

       <u>A</u> <u>known</u> <u>problem</u> <u>with</u> <u>hotspots</u> <u>for</u> <u>GD::Graph::hbars</u> <u>is</u> <u>that</u> <u>the</u> <u>x</u> <u>and</u> <u>y</u> <u>coordinate</u>  <u>come</u>  <u>out</u>  <u>transposed.</u>
       <u>This</u> <u>probably</u> <u>won't</u> <u>be</u> <u>fixed</u> <u>until</u> <u>the</u> <u>redesign</u> <u>of</u> <u>this</u> <u>section</u>

       GD::Graph  keeps  an internal set of coordinates for each data point and for certain features of a chart,
       like the title and axis labels. This specification is very similar to the HTML image  map  specification,
       and  in  fact exists mainly for that purpose. You can get at these hotspots with the "get_hotspot" method
       for data point, and "get_feature_coordinates" for the chart features.

       The &lt;get_hotspot&gt; method accepts two optional arguments, the number of the dataset you're interested  in,
       and  the  number  of  the point in that dataset you're interested in. When called with two arguments, the
       method returns a list of one of the following forms:

         'rect', x1, y1, x2, y2
         'poly', x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, ....
         'line', xs, ys, xe, ye, width

       The parameters for "rect" are the coordinates of the corners of the rectangle, the parameters for  "poly"
       are the coordinates of the vertices of the polygon, and the parameters for the "line" are the coordinates
       for  the  start  and  end  point, and the line width.  It should be possible to almost directly translate
       these lists into HTML image map specifications.

       If the second argument to "get_hotspot" is omitted, a list of references to arrays will be returned. This
       list represents all the points in the dataset specified, and each  array  referred  to  is  of  the  form
       outlined above.

         ['rect', x1, y1, x2, y2 ], ['rect', x1, y1, x2, y2], ...

       if  both  arguments  to  "get_hotspot"  are  omitted, the list that comes back will contain references to
       arrays for each data set, which in turn contain references to arrays for each point.

         [
           ['rect', x1, y1, x2, y2 ], ['rect', x1, y1, x2, y2], ...
         ],
         [
           ['line', xs, ys, xe, ye, w], ['line', xs, ys, xe, ye, w], ...
         ],...

       The "get_feature" method, when called with the name of a feature, returns a single array reference with a
       type and coordinates as described above. When called with no arguments, a hash reference is returned with
       the keys being all the currently defined and set features, and the values array references with the  type
       and coordinates for each of those features.

</pre><h4><b>ERROR</b> <b>HANDLING</b></h4><pre>
       GD::Graph  objects  inherit from the GD::Graph::Error class (not the other way around), so they behave in
       the same manner. The main feature of that behaviour is that you have the <b>error()</b> method available to  get
       some  information  about what went wrong. The GD::Graph methods all return undef if something went wrong,
       so you should be able to write safe programs like this:

         my $graph = GD::Graph-&gt;new()    or die GD::Graph-&gt;error;
         $graph-&gt;set( %attributes )      or die $graph-&gt;error;
         $graph-&gt;plot($gdg_data)         or die $graph-&gt;error;

       More advanced usage is possible, and there are some caveats with  this  error  handling,  which  are  all
       explained in GD::Graph::Error.

       Unfortunately,  it  is  almost impossible to gracefully recover from an error in GD::Graph, so you really
       should get rid of the object, and recreate it from scratch if you want to recover. For example, to adjust
       the correct_width attribute if you get the error "Horizontal size too small" or "Vertical size too small"
       (in the case of hbar), you could do something like:

         sub plot_graph
         {
             my $data    = shift;
             my %attribs = @_;
             my $graph   = GD::Graph::bars-&gt;new()
                or die GD::Graph-&gt;error;
             $graph-&gt;set(%attribs)     or die $graph-&gt;error;
             $graph-&gt;plot($data)       or die $graph-&gt;error;
         }

         my $gd;
         eval { $gd = plot_graph(\@data, %attribs) };
         if ($@)
         {
             die $@ unless $@ =~ /size too small/;
             $gd = plot_graph(\@data, %attribs, correct_width =&gt; 0);
         }

       Of course, you could also adjust the width this way, and you can check for other errors.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       As with all Modules for Perl: Please stick to using the interface. If you try to  fiddle  too  much  with
       knowledge of the internals of this module, you could get burned. I may change them at any time.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       GD::Graph objects cannot be reused. To create a new plot, you have to create a new GD::Graph object.

       Rotated  charts  (ones with the X axis on the left) can currently only be created for bars. With a little
       work, this will work for all others as well. Please, be patient :)

       Other outstanding bugs can  (alas)  probably  be  found  in  the  RT  queue  for  this  distribution,  at
       <a href="http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Dist/Display.html">http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Dist/Display.html</a>?Name=GDGraph

       If  you think you have found a bug, please check first to see if it has already been reported.  If it has
       not, please do (you can use the web interface above or send e-mail  to  &lt;<a href="mailto:bug-GDGraph@rt.cpan.org">bug-GDGraph@rt.cpan.org</a>&gt;).   Bug
       reports should contain as many as possible of the following:

       •   a concise description of the buggy behavior and how it differs from what you expected,

       •   the versions of Perl, GD::Graph and GD that you are using,

       •   a short demonstration script that shows the bug in action,

       •   a patch that fixes it. :-)

       Of  all  of these, the third is probably the single most important, since producing a test case generally
       makes the explanation much more concise and understandable, as well as making it  much  simpler  to  show
       that the bug has been fixed.  As an incidental benefit, if the bug is in fact caused by some code outside
       of  GD::Graph,  it  will  become  apparent  while  you are writing the test case, thereby saving time and
       confusion for all concerned.
