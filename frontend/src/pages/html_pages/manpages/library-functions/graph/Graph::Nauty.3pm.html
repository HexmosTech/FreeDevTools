       Graph::Nauty - Perl bindings for Nauty

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Graph::Nauty qw(
             are_isomorphic
             automorphism_group_size
             canonical_order
             orbits
         );
         use Graph::Undirected;

         my $A = Graph::Undirected-&gt;new;
         my $B = Graph::Undirected-&gt;new;

         # Create graphs here

         # Get the size of the automorphism group:
         print automorphism_group_size( $A );

         # Get automorphism group orbits:
         print orbits( $A );

         # Check whether two graphs are isomorphs:
         print are_isomorphic( $A, $B );

         # Get canonical order of vertices:
         print canonical_order( $A );

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Graph::Nauty provides an interface to Nauty, a set of procedures for determining the automorphism group
       of a vertex-coloured graph, and for testing graphs for isomorphism.

       Currently Graph::Nauty only supports Graph::Undirected, that is, it does not handle directed graphs. Both
       colored vertices and edges are accounted for when determining equivalence classes.

   <b>Vertex</b> <b>color</b>
       As Graph supports any data types as graph vertices, not much can be inferred about them automatically.
       For now, Graph::Nauty by default stringifies every vertex (using Perl "" operator) and splits them into
       equivalence classes. If different behavior is needed, a custom anonymous subroutine can be passed inside
       an option hash:

         print orbits( $A, sub { return length $_[0] } );

       Subroutine gets a vertex as its 0th parameter, and is expected to return a string, or anything
       stringifiable.

       In subroutines where the order of returned vertices is important, a second anonymous subroutine can be
       passed to order vertices inside each of the equivalence classes:

         print orbits( $A, sub { return length $_[0] }, sub { return "$_[0]" } );

       If an ordering subroutine is not given, stringification (Perl "" operator) is used by default.

   <b>Edge</b> <b>color</b>
       Edge colors are generated from Graph edge attributes. Complete hash of each edge's attributes is
       stringified (deterministically) and used to divide edges into equivalence classes.

   <b>Working</b> <b>storage</b> <b>size</b>
       Nauty needs working storage, which it does not allocate by itself.  Graph::Nauty follows the advice of
       the Nauty user guide by allocating the recommended amount of memory, but for certain graphs this might
       not be enough, still. To control that, $Graph::Nauty::worksize could be used to set the size of memory in
       the units of Nauty's "setword".

</pre><h4><b>INSTALLING</b></h4><pre>
       Building and installing Graph::Nauty from source requires shared library and C headers for Nauty, which
       can be downloaded from &lt;https://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/nauty/&gt;. Both the library and C headers have
       to be installed to locations visible by Perl's C compiler.
