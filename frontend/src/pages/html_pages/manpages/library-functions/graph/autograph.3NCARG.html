</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Autograph - To draw graphs, each with a labeled background and each displaying one or more curves.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       Each of the following routines draws a complete graph with a single call:

       EZY - Draws, in a manner determined by the current values of the control parameters, a complete graph of
       a single curve through the points (I,YDRA(I)), for I from 1 to NPTS. The argument GLAB may be used to
       specify a "graph label", to be placed at the top of the graph.

       EZXY - Draws, in a manner determined by the current values of the control parameters, a complete graph of
       a single curve through the points (XDRA(I),YDRA(I)), for I from 1 to NPTS.  The argument GLAB may be used
       to specify a "graph label", to be placed at the top of the graph.

       EZMY - Draws, in a manner determined by the current values of the control parameters, a complete graph of
       one or more curves, each defined by a set of points (I,YDRA(I,J)) (or (I,YDRA(J,I)), depending on the
       current value of ´ROW.´), for I from 1 to NPTS. The curve number J runs from 1 to MANY. The argument GLAB
       may be used to specify a "graph label", to be placed at the top of the graph.

       EZMXY - Draws, in a manner determined by the current values of the control parameters, a complete graph
       of one or more curves, each defined by a set of points (XDRA(I),YDRA(I,J)) (or (XDRA(I),YDRA(J,I)) or
       (XDRA(I,J),YDRA(I,J)) or (XDRA(J,I),YDRA(J,I)), depending on the current value of ´ROW.´), for I from 1
       to NPTS. The curve number J runs from 1 to MANY. The argument GLAB may be used to specify a "graph
       label", to be placed at the top of the graph.

       The following routines provide access to control parameters:

       ANOTAT - Changes the values of certain primary control parameters, purportedly having to do with
       "annotation" of a graph.

       DISPLA - Changes the values of certain primary control parameters purportedly having to do with the
       "display" of a graph.

       AGSETC - Allows a user program to (in effect) store a character string as the value of a specified single
       parameter.

       AGSETF - Allows a user program to store a real number as the value of a single parameter.

       AGSETI - Allows a user program to store the real equivalent of an integer as the value of a single
       parameter.

       AGSETP - Allows a user program to reset the values of a group of parameters containing one or more
       elements.

       AGSETR - Allows a user program to store a real number as the value of a single parameter.

       AGGETC - Allows a user program to retrieve (in effect) the character-string values of certain single
       parameters.

       AGGETF - Allows a user program to retrieve the real value of a single parameter.

       AGGETI - Allows a user program to retrieve the integer equivalent of the real value of a single
       parameter.

       AGGETP - Allows a user program to get the values of a group of parameters containing one or more
       elements.

       AGGETR - Allows a user program to retrieve the real value of a single parameter.

       The following are lower-level user-callable routines:

       AGSTUP - Performs "set-up" tasks required before AGBACK and AGCURV may be called. Basically, AGSTUP
       examines the current values of the primary control parameters for errors and computes from them and from
       its arguments the values of secondary control parameters. The primary and secondary control parameters
       together determine how the routines AGBACK and AGCURV will behave.

       AGBACK - Draws the background specified by the current values of the control parameters - the primary
       parameters with default values or with values supplied by the user, and the secondary parameters with
       values computed by AGSTUP.

       AGCURV - Draws a curve in a manner specified by the current values of the control parameters - the
       primary parameters with default values or with values supplied by the user, and the secondary parameters
       with values computed by AGSTUP.

       The following are other user-callable routines:

       AGSAVE - Saves the current state of Autograph for later restoration by AGRSTR.

       AGRSTR - Restores a saved state of Autograph.

       The following are non-user-callable, CHARACTER*16 functions:

       AGBNCH - Provides an easy way to convert binary dash patterns into character dash patterns.

       AGDSHN - Provides an easy way to generate the names of parameters in the group ´DASH/PATTERN.´, for use
       in calls to AGSETC and AGGETC.

</pre><h4><b>ACCESS</b></h4><pre>
       To use the Autograph Fortran or C routines, load the NCAR Graphics libraries ncarg, ncarg_gks, and
       ncarg_c, preferably in that order.

       To get smoother curves, drawn using spline interpolation, also load libdashsmth.o

       Autograph contains a routine AGPWRT, which it calls to draw labels.  This routine just passes its
       arguments on to the system-plot-package routine PWRIT. To use one of the fancier character-drawers, like
       Plotchar, just compile a routine AGPWRT to replace the default version; it has the same arguments as
       PWRIT and may either draw the character string itself, or just pass the arguments on to a desired
       character-drawer.  You can also modify AGPWRT so that Autograph will access character fonts that are
       different from the default font.  In  its distributed form, AGPWRT calls PWRIT. Consult the documentation
       in the code.  The file AGUPWRT on the distribution tape contains an implementation of AGPWRTX that allows
       Autograph to access the PWRITX character set.  See the documentation in the code for AGUPWRTX.   See your
       NCAR Graphics site representative to learn how to access the code.

</pre><h4><b>MESSAGES</b></h4><pre>
       Autograph routines detect certain errors and, in response, call the routine SETER, which is an adapted
       version of a PORT error handler. Currently, all such errors are treated as being fatal and cause
       termination of the job. An error message is logged before the job is terminated. Each such message
       includes the name of the routine which detected the error and may be accompanied by supplementary
       information aimed at allowing the user to easily identify the call that caused the error. The possible
       error messages are as follows (in alphabetical order):

       AGEXAX (CALLED BY AGSTUP) - USER-SYSTEM-TO-LABEL-SYSTEM MAPPING IS NOT MONOTONIC

            This probably means that you have replaced the default routine AGUTOL with a version of your own,
            and you´ve blown it.

       AGGETC - PARAMETER TO GET IS NOT INTRINSICALLY OF TYPE CHARACTER

            The argument TPGN specifies a parameter which is not intrinsically of type character. See the
            description in the AGGETC man page.

       AGGETP OR AGSETP - ATTEMPT TO ACCESS LABEL ATTRIBUTES BEFORE SETTING LABEL NAME

            The parameter ´LABEL/NAME.´ must be set prior to the call which gave the error message, specifying
            which label´s attributes are being referenced.

       AGGETP OR AGSETP - ATTEMPT TO ACCESS LINE ATTRIBUTES BEFORE SETTING LINE NUMBER

            The parameter ´LINE/NUMBER.´ must be set prior to the call which gave the error message, specifying
            which label line´s attributes are being referenced.

       AGGETP OR AGSETP - ILLEGAL KEYWORD USED IN PARAMETER IDENTIFIER

            The argument TPGN contains an unrecognizable keyword.

       AGKURV - NUMBER OF POINTS IS .LE. 0

            The argument NEXY, in a call to AGCURV, is less than or equal to zero. The routine AGKURV is called
            by AGCURV to draw un-windowed curves.

       AGNUMB - MANTISSA TOO LONG
       AGNUMB - EXPONENT TOO LARGE
       AGNUMB - ZERO-LENGTH MANTISSA

            AGNUMB is called by AGAXIS to generate a character string expressing the value of a real number. You
            should not be able to generate any of AGNUMB´s error messages. If you do, see the Autograph
            specialist.

       AGQURV - NUMBER OF POINTS IS .LE. 0

            The argument NEXY, in a call to AGCURV, is less than or equal to zero. The routine AGQURV is called
            by AGCURV to draw windowed curves.

       AGRSTR - ERROR ON READ
       AGRSTR - END-OF-FILE ON READ

            Probably the unit specified by IFNO was not positioned properly.

       AGSAVE - ERROR ON WRITE

            A system error has occurred as a result of the attempted "WRITE".

       AGSETC - PARAMETER TO SET IS NOT INTRINSICALLY OF TYPE CHARACTER

            This means that the argument TPGN specifies some parameter other than one of the acceptable
            possibilities. See the description in the AGSETC man page.

       AGSETP - ATTEMPT TO DEFINE LINE OF NON-EXISTENT LABEL

            The user has attempted to define a line of a label without first specifying which label;
            ´LABEL/NAME.´ must be set prior to the call which gave the error message.

       AGSETP - LABEL LIST OVERFLOW - SEE AUTOGRAPH SPECIALIST

            The user has attempted to define more labels than Autograph can handle; a modification of Autograph
            is required.

       AGSETP - LINE LIST OVERFLOW - SEE AUTOGRAPH SPECIALIST

            The user has attempted to define more label lines than Autograph can handle; a modification of
            Autograph is required.

       AGSTCH - CHARACTER-STRING BUFFER OVERFLOW - SEE CONSULTANT

            The routine AGSTCH is called by AGSETC to stash the character string in Autograph´s character
            storage space.  The available storage space has been exhausted.  See the consultant.

       AGSTCH - CHARACTER-STRING INDEX OVERFLOW - SEE CONSULTANT

            The routine AGSTCH is called by AGSETC to stash the character string in Autograph´s character
            storage space.  Too many such strings have been stored. See the consultant.

       AGSTUP - GRAPH WINDOW IMPROPERLY SPECIFIED

            The parameters in the group named ´GRAPH.´ have improper values.

       AGSTUP - GRID WINDOW IMPROPERLY SPECIFIED

            The parameters in the group named ´GRID.´ have improper values. This is most likely to occur when
            ´SET.´ has the value "2." or "4.", specifying that the edges of the grid window are to be as implied
            by the last call to the plot package routine SET. Check to make sure that the portion of the plotter
            frame specified by the last SET call is within the current graph window.

       AGSTUP - s LABELS IMPROPERLY SPECIFIED

            (where "s" = "LEFT", "RIGHT", "BOTTOM", "TOP", or "INTERIOR"). Re-read the paragraph "THE LABEL
            BOXES", in the section "OVERVIEW". You have defined a label with a basepoint on one edge of the grid
            window and an offset vector pointing outward, some part of which extends inside the grid window (or
            vice-versa). This is not allowed.
