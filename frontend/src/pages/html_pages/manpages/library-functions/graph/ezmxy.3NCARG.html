</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       EZMXY - Draws, in a manner determined by the current values of the control parameters, a complete graph
       of one or more curves, each defined by a set of points (XDRA(I),YDRA(I,J)) (or (XDRA(I),YDRA(J,I)) or
       (XDRA(I,J),YDRA(I,J)) or (XDRA(J,I),YDRA(J,I)), depending on the current value of 'ROW.'), for I from 1
       to NPTS. The curve number J runs from 1 to MANY. The argument GLAB may be used to specify a "graph
       label", to be placed at the top of the graph.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       CALL EZMXY (XDRA,YDRA,IDXY,MANY,NPTS,GLAB)

</pre><h4><b>C-BINDING</b> <b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;ncarg/ncargC.h&gt;

       void c_ezmxy(float *xdra, float *ydra, int idxy, int many, \
       int npts, char *glab)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       XDRA        (an  input  array  of type REAL, dimensioned NPTS or IDXY x MANY or IDXY x NPTS, depending on
                   the current value of 'ROW.')  contains  curve-point  X  coordinates.  The  current  value  of
                   'NULL/1.'  (default  value  "1.E36")  may  be  used  in  XDRA to signal missing points; curve
                   segments on either side of a missing point are not  drawn.  Note:   Because  all  non-missing
                   coordinates  are  used in figuring the minimum and maximum user values along a given axis, it
                   is safest to mark both coordinates as "missing".

                   •      If 'ROW.' has the absolute value "1." (the default), XDRA is singly-dimensioned. It is
                          subscripted by point number.

                   •      If 'ROW.' has the absolute value "2." or greater, XDRA is  doubly-dimensioned.  It  is
                          subscripted by point number and curve number, in that order if 'ROW.' is positive (the
                          default), and in the reverse order if 'ROW.' is negative.

       YDRA        (an  input  array  of  type  REAL,  dimensioned  IDXY x MANY or IDXY x NPTS, depending on the
                   current value of 'ROW.')  contains curve-point Y coordinates. The current value of  'NULL/1.'
                   (default  value  "1.E36")  may  be  used  in YDRA to signal missing points; curve segments on
                   either side of a missing point are not drawn. Note:  Because all non-missing coordinates  are
                   used in figuring the minimum and maximum user values along a given axis, it is safest to mark
                   both coordinates as "missing".

                   •      If  'ROW.'  is  positive  (the default), YDRA is subscripted by point number and curve
                          number, in that order.

                   •      If 'ROW.' is negative, YDRA is subscripted by curve number and point number,  in  that
                          order.

       IDXY        (an  input  expression  of  type INTEGER) is the first dimension of the arrays XDRA (if it is
                   doubly-dimensioned) and YDRA (unconditionally), required by EZMXY in  order  to  index  these
                   arrays properly.

                   •      If 'ROW.' is positive (the default), IDXY must be greater than or equal to NPTS.

                   •      If 'ROW.' is negative, IDXY must be greater than or equal to MANY.

       MANY        (an input expression of type INTEGER) is the number of curves to be drawn by EZMXY.

       NPTS        (an input expression of type INTEGER) is the number of points defining each curve to be drawn
                   by EZMXY.

       GLAB        (an  input expression of type CHARACTER) defines a new "graph label". (If the first character
                   of this expression is "<a href="../man0/CHAR.0.html">CHAR</a>(0)", no new "graph  label"  is  defined;  the  current  one  will
                   continue  to  be  used.)  A character string defining a new graph label must either be of the
                   exact length specified by the current value of 'LINE/MAXIMUM.' (default: 40  characters),  or
                   shorter;  if  shorter, it must be terminated by the character defined by the current value of
                   'LINE/END.' (default: a '$'). The string becomes the new text of line number 100 of the label
                   named 'T'.

</pre><h4><b>C-BINDING</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The C-binding argument descriptions are the same as the FORTRAN argument descriptions.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Use the ncargex command to see the following relevant examples: agex04, agex05, agex07,  agex08,  tagupw,
       tautog, fagaxclr, fagaxlbl, fagaxmax, fagcuclr, fagcudsh, fagezmxy, fagilclr, fagovrvw.

</pre><h4><b>ACCESS</b></h4><pre>
       To  use  EZMXY  or c_ezmxy, load the NCAR Graphics libraries ncarg, ncarg_gks, and ncarg_c, preferably in
       that order.    To get smoother curves, drawn using spline interpolation, also  load  libdashsmth.o.   Or,
       you  can  use  the  ncargf77  command  to compile your program and load the above libraries, then, to get
       smoother curves, use the -dashsmth option.
