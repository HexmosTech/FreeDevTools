</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Graph::BitMatrix - create and manipulate a V x V bit matrix of graph G

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Graph::BitMatrix;
           use Graph::Directed;
           my $g  = Graph::Directed-&gt;new;
           $g-&gt;add_...(); # build $g
           my $m = Graph::BitMatrix-&gt;new($g, %opt);
           $m-&gt;get($u, $v)
           $m-&gt;set($u, $v)
           $m-&gt;unset($u, $v)
           $m-&gt;get_row($u, $v1, $v2, ..., $vn)
           $m-&gt;set_row($u, $v1, $v2, ..., $vn)
           $m-&gt;unset_row($u, $v1, $v2, ..., $vn)
           $a-&gt;vertices()

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This class enables creating bit matrices that compactly describe the connected of the graphs.

   <b>Class</b> <b>Methods</b>
       new($g)
           Create a bit matrix from a Graph $g.  The %opt, if present, can have the following options:

           •       connect_edges

                   If  true  or  if  not  present,  set the bits in the bit matrix that correspond to edges.  If
                   false, do not set any bits.  In either case the bit matrix of V x V bits is allocated.

           •       transpose

                   If true, set the bits in the  bit  matrix  that  correspond  to  edges  but  in  the  reverse
                   direction.  This  has  the effect of transposing the matrix. Obviously makes no difference to
                   the result for undirected graphs.

   <b>Object</b> <b>Methods</b>
       get($u, $v)
           Return true if the bit matrix has a "one bit" between the vertices $u and  $v;  in  other  words,  if
           there  is  (at  least one) a vertex going from $u to $v.  If there is no vertex and therefore a "zero
           bit", return false.

       set($u, $v)
           Set the bit between the vertices $u and $v; in other words, connect the vertices  $u  and  $v  by  an
           edge.  The change does not get mirrored back to the original graph.  Returns nothing.

       unset($u, $v)
           Unset the bit between the vertices $u and $v; in other words, disconnect the vertices $u and $v by an
           edge.  The change does not get mirrored back to the original graph.  Returns nothing.

       get_row($u, $v1, $v2, ..., $vn)
           Test the row at vertex "u" for the vertices "v1", "v2", ..., "vn" Returns a list of <u>n</u> truth values.

       set_row($u, $v1, $v2, ..., $vn)
           Sets  the  row  at  vertex  "u"  for the vertices "v1", "v2", ..., "vn", in other words, connects the
           vertex "u" to the vertices "vi".  The changes do  not  get  mirrored  back  to  the  original  graph.
           Returns nothing.

       unset_row($u, $v1, $v2, ..., $vn)
           Unsets  the row at vertex "u" for the vertices "v1", "v2", ..., "vn", in other words, disconnects the
           vertex "u" from the vertices "vi".  The changes do not get  mirrored  back  to  the  original  graph.
           Returns nothing.

       vertices
           Return the list of vertices in the bit matrix.

</pre><h4><b>ALGORITHM</b></h4><pre>
       The  algorithm  used to create the matrix is two nested loops, which is O(V**2) in time, and the returned
       matrices are O(V**2) in space.
