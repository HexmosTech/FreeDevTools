</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Graph::Writer::VCG - write out directed graph in VCG format

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Graph;
         use Graph::Writer::VCG;

         $graph = Graph-&gt;new();
         # add edges and nodes to the graph

         $writer = Graph::Writer::VCG-&gt;new();
         $writer-&gt;write_graph($graph, 'mygraph.vcg');

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Graph::Writer::VCG</b> is a class for writing out a directed graph in the file format used by the <u>VCG</u> tool,
       originally developed for Visualising Compiler Graphs.  The graph must be an instance of the Graph class,
       which is actually a set of classes developed by Jarkko Hietaniemi.

       If you have defined any attributes for the graph, nodes, or edges, they will be written out to the file,
       as long as they are attributes understood by VCG.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>new()</b>
       Constructor - generate a new writer instance.

         $writer = Graph::Writer::VCG-&gt;new();

       This doesn't take any arguments.

   <b>write_graph()</b>
       Write a specific graph to a named file:

         $writer-&gt;write_graph($graph, $file);

       The $file argument can either be a filename, or a filehandle for a previously opened file.

</pre><h4><b>KNOWN</b> <b>BUGS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       •   Attributes  with  non-atomic  values  aren't  currently  handled.   This includes the <b>loc</b>, <b>classname</b>,
           <b>colorentry</b>, and <b>infoname</b> attributes for graphs, and the <b>loc</b> attribute for nodes,

       •   Can currently only handle <b>graph</b>, <b>node</b>, and <b>edge</b> elements and their attributes.  So doesn't know about
           <b>foldnode_defaults</b> and things like that.
