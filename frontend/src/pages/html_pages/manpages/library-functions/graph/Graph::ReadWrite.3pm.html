</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Graph::ReadWrite - modules for reading and writing directed graphs

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module is a placeholder in the Graph-ReadWrite distribution, which is a collection of modules for
       reading and writing directed graphs.

       You don't use "Graph::ReadWrite", you use one of the reader or writer modules for a specific format:

       •   Graph::Reader::Dot - class for reading a Graph instance from Dot format.

       •   Graph::Reader::HTK - read an HTK lattice in as an instance of Graph.

       •   Graph::Reader::XML - class for reading a Graph instance from XML

       •   Graph::Writer::Dot - write out directed graph in Dot format

       •   Graph::Writer::HTK - write a perl Graph out as an HTK lattice file

       •   Graph::Writer::VCG - write out directed graph in VCG format

       •   Graph::Writer::XML - write out directed graph as XML

       •   Graph::Writer::daVinci - write out directed graph in daVinci format
