       GD::Graph::FAQ - Frequently asked questions

</pre><h4><b>IMPORTANT</b></h4><pre>
       Take a look at "DISTRIBUTION STATUS" in GD::Graph first.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
   <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>errors</b> <b>like</b> <b>"Can't</b> <b>call</b> <b>method</b> <b>METHOD</b> <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>undefined</b> <b>value".</b> <b>What</b> <b>gives?</b>
       You probably had an error somewhere, most likely in the <b>plot()</b> method, and you didn't check for it. See
       the section on Error Handling in the documentation for GD::Graph to find out how to deal with this sort
       of thing, and how to get more information about what the error was.

   <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>a</b> <b>bar</b> <b>chart,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>chart</b> <b>area</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>image.</b> <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>on?</b>
       As of version 1.30, GD::Graph automatically corrects the width of the plotting area of a chart if it
       needs to draw bars (i.e. for bars and some mixed charts). This is necessary, because rounding errors
       cause irregular gaps between or overlaps of bars if the bar is not an exact integer number of pixels
       wide.

       If you want the old behaviour back, set the correct_width attribute to a false value.

   <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>my</b> <b>data</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>format</b> <b>that</b> <b>doesn't</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>array</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>to</b>
       <b>GD::Graph's</b> <b>plot</b> <b>method.</b> <b>Do</b> <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>mess</b> <b>around</b> <b>with</b> <b>array</b> <b>references?</b>
       Not necessarily. Check out the GD::Graph::Data class.

   <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>stop</b> <b>those</b> <b>pesky</b> <b>accents</b> <b>appearing</b> <b>around</b> <b>bars</b> <b>or</b> <b>inside</b> <b>area</b> <b>charts?</b>
       You can set the "accent_treshold" option to a large enough value (larger than your chart). Alternatively,
       you may like it better to set the "borderclrs" attribute to be the same as the dclrs one.

       I'll probably include an option in a future version that gives better control over this.

   <b>Where</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>ActiveState</b> <b>ppm</b> <b>of</b> <b>GD::Graph?</b>
       Ask them. I have asked them, but didn't get an answer. I don't know what to do to get it included in
       their set of ppms, and I really do not have the time to keep asking them.

       I believe that GD::graph has finally made it into ActiveState's ppm archive. However, I am going to leave
       this question here in case they get behind again.

   <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> <b>example</b> <b>code</b> <b>for</b> <b>me?</b>
       The distribution has a large set of examples in it. If you don't have the original distribution, please
       get it from CPAN (<a href="http://www.cpan.org/">http://www.cpan.org/</a> or some local mirror).

   <b>Will</b> <b>you</b> <b>support</b> <b>X</b> <b>or</b> <b>Y?</b>
       If you send me a patch that (in a decent manner) adds the functionality to the latest version, I may very
       well add it for the next release. If you don't send me a patch, but just a question, you will have to be
       patient.  (Please also see the section on bugs in the main body of GD::Graph.)

   <b>Why</b> <b>does</b> <b>export_format</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>weird</b> <b>string,</b> <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>just</b> <b>'png'</b> <b>or</b> <b>'gif'?</b>
       As of version 1.31, export_format in a list context returns all formats that GD can export. If you are
       only interested in the answer 'gif' or 'png', make sure that you call it in a scalar context.

         $export_format = GD::Graph-&gt;export_format;
         $export_format = $graph-&gt;export_format;
         print "Export format is ", scalar $graph-&gt;export_format, "\n";
         print "Export format is " .  $graph-&gt;export_format . "\n";
         @export_formats = $graph-&gt;export_format;

   <b>TrueType</b> <b>fonts</b> <b>don't</b> <b>work</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>use</b> <b>GD::Graph</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>CGI</b> <b>program.</b>
       When your programs run as CGI, they typically do not have the same environment as when you use them from
       the command line. The Perl FAQ, section 9, has some information on this. It is also not guaranteed that
       your script runs from the directory that it is in. It is probably better to include something like:

         use GD::Text;
         GD::Text-&gt;font_path("/path/to/my/font_dir");

       See the GD::Text documentation for more information about font paths.

   <b>I'm</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>GD's</b> <b>builtin</b> <b>fonts,</b> <b>but</b> <b>it's</b> <b>not</b> <b>working.</b>
       Most likely, you are using the font short name, like gdGiantFont or gdMediumBoldFont, and you have not
       put a "use GD" in your program.  This is needed, because these short names need to be exported into your
       name space by the GD library:

         use GD;
         # ...
         $graph-&gt;set_x_axis_font(gdMediumBoldFont);

       If you don't want to include the GD library, you can use the longer alternative names (which is what I'd
       recommend anyway):

         $graph1-&gt;set_x_axis_font(GD::Font-&gt;MediumBold);

       If you "use strict" then you will actually get an error message if you try to use the short names without
       including the GD module.

       Also see the GD::Text documentation for this information.

   <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>many</b> <b>data</b> <b>sets,</b> <b>some</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> <b>having</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>colour.</b>
       The default number of colours for data sets is seven, so if you use more than seven data sets, those
       colours will be re-used for the higher data sets.

       This is described in the entry for the "dclrs" attribute in the GD::Graph documentation.

   <b>Can</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>X?</b>
       Not necessarily (X might be kind of complicated, after all).  Did you look in the samples for something
       similar?  If not, you're probably best off seeing if you can get help from a group of people, rather than
       one or the other of the overworked individuals whose e-mail addresses are shown below.

       If you're more comfortable with asking a newsgroup for help, the canonical resource is
       &lt;comp.lang.perl.misc&gt;; if you prefer web forums, there is a good one at &lt;<a href="http://www.perlmonks.org">http://www.perlmonks.org</a>&gt;.

       In either case, if you are not familiar with the forum and its denizens, you might wish to read the
       following helpful guide before posting your question: <a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/">http://www.perlmonks.org/</a>?node_id=172086

   <b>Can</b> <b>you</b> <b>fix</b> <b>this</b> <b>bug</b> <b>I've</b> <b>found?</b>
       Well, I hope so.  Please see the "BUGS" section in the main body of GD::Graph for the best way to report
       it.
