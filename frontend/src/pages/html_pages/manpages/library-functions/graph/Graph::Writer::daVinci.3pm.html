</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Graph::Writer::daVinci - write out directed graph in daVinci format

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Graph;
         use Graph::Writer::daVinci;

         $graph = Graph-&gt;new();
         # add edges and nodes to the graph

         $writer = Graph::Writer::daVinci-&gt;new();
         $writer-&gt;write_graph($graph, 'mygraph.davinci');

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Graph::Writer::daVinci</b> is a class for writing out a directed graph in the file format used by the <u>daVinci</u>
       tool.  The graph must be an instance of the Graph class, which is actually a set of classes developed by
       Jarkko Hietaniemi.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>new()</b>
       Constructor - generate a new writer instance.

         $writer = Graph::Writer::daVinci-&gt;new();

       This doesn't take any arguments.

   <b>write_graph()</b>
       Write a specific graph to a named file:

         $writer-&gt;write_graph($graph, $file);

       The $file argument can either be a filename, or a filehandle for a previously opened file.
