       Graph::TransitiveClosure::Matrix - create and query transitive closure of graph

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Graph::TransitiveClosure::Matrix;
           use Graph::Directed; # or Undirected

           my $g  = Graph::Directed-&gt;new;
           $g-&gt;add_...(); # build $g

           # Compute the transitive closure matrix.
           my $tcm = Graph::TransitiveClosure::Matrix-&gt;new($g);

           # Being reflexive is the default,
           # meaning that null transitions are included.
           my $tcm = Graph::TransitiveClosure::Matrix-&gt;new($g, reflexive =&gt; 1);
           $tcm-&gt;is_reachable($u, $v)

           # is_reachable(u, v) is always reflexive.
           $tcm-&gt;is_reachable($u, $v)

           # The reflexivity of is_transitive(u, v) depends on the reflexivity
           # of the transitive closure.
           $tcg-&gt;is_transitive($u, $v)

           my $tcm = Graph::TransitiveClosure::Matrix-&gt;new($g, path_length =&gt; 1);
           my $n = $tcm-&gt;path_length($u, $v)

           my $tcm = Graph::TransitiveClosure::Matrix-&gt;new($g, path_vertices =&gt; 1);
           my @v = $tcm-&gt;path_vertices($u, $v)

           my $tcm =
               Graph::TransitiveClosure::Matrix-&gt;new($g,
                                                     attribute_name =&gt; 'length');

           my @v = $tcm-&gt;vertices

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       You can use "Graph::TransitiveClosure::Matrix" to compute the transitive closure matrix of a graph and
       optionally also the minimum paths (lengths and vertices) between vertices, and after that query the
       transitiveness between vertices by using the is_reachable() and is_transitive() methods, and the paths by
       using the path_length() and path_vertices() methods.

       If you modify the graph after computing its transitive closure, the transitive closure and minimum paths
       may become invalid.

</pre><h4><b>Methods</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Class</b> <b>Methods</b>
       new($g)
           Construct the transitive closure matrix of the graph $g.

       new($g, options)
           Construct the transitive closure matrix of the graph $g with options as a hash. The known options are

           "attribute_name" =&gt; <u>attribute_name</u>
                   By  default  the edge attribute used for distance is "weight".  You can change that by giving
                   another attribute name with the "attribute_name" attribute to the <b>new()</b> constructor.

           reflexive =&gt; boolean
                   By default the transitive closure matrix is not reflexive: that is, the adjacency matrix  has
                   zeroes on the diagonal.  To have ones on the diagonal, use true for the "reflexive" option.

           path =&gt; boolean
                   If  set  true,  sets  "path_length"  and  "path_vertices".  If  either of those are true (and
                   "path_vertices" is by default), then both are calculated.

           path_length =&gt; boolean
                   By default "false", but see above as overridden by default  "path_vertices"  being  true.  If
                   calculated, they can be retrieved using the <b>path_length()</b> method.

           path_vertices =&gt; boolean
                   By default the paths are computed, with the boolean transitivity, they can be retrieved using
                   the <b>path_vertices()</b> method.

           path_count =&gt; boolean
                   As  an  alternative  to setting "path_length", if this is true then the matrix will store the
                   quantity of paths between the two vertices. This is still retrieved using  the  <b>path_length()</b>
                   method.  The path vertices will not be available. You should probably only use this on a DAG,
                   and not with "reflexive".

   <b>Object</b> <b>Methods</b>
       is_reachable($u, $v)
           Return true if the vertex $v is reachable from the vertex $u, or false if not.

       path_length($u, $v)
           Return the minimum path length from the vertex $u to the vertex $v, or undef  if  there  is  no  such
           path.

       path_vertices($u, $v)
           Return the minimum path (as a list of vertices) from the vertex $u to the vertex $v, or an empty list
           if there is no such path, OR also return an empty list if $u equals $v.

       has_vertices($u, $v, ...)
           Return true if the transitive closure matrix has all the listed vertices, false if not.

       is_transitive($u, $v)
           Return true if the vertex $v is transitively reachable from the vertex $u, false if not.

       vertices
           Return the list of vertices in the transitive closure matrix.

       path_successor($u, $v)
           Return the successor of vertex $u in the transitive closure path towards vertex $v.

       all_paths($u, $v)
           Return list of array-refs with all the paths from $u to $v. Will ignore self-loops.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUES</b></h4><pre>
       For  <b>path_length()</b>  the  return  value  will be the sum of the appropriate attributes on the edges of the
       path, "weight" by default.  If no attribute has been set, one (1) will be assumed.

       If you try to ask about vertices not in the graph, undefs and empty lists will be returned.

</pre><h4><b>ALGORITHM</b></h4><pre>
       The transitive closure algorithm used is Warshall and Floyd-Warshall for  the  minimum  paths,  which  is
       O(V**3) in time, and the returned matrices are O(V**2) in space.
