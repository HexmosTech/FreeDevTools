</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Graph::Maker::Uniform - Creates a graph distributed randomly over the d-dimensional grid.

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       Version 0.01

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       Creates a uniform graph with nodes distributed randomly over dims-dimensional unit cube.  A uniform graph
       distributes nodes randomly (generally uniformally) over a unit cube in some number of dimensions, where
       nodes are connected iff they are with rad units of distnace of eachother and no nodes are within repel
       distance of eachother.  If the graph is directed then edges are added in both directions to create an
       undirected graph.

               use warnings;
               use Graph;
               use Graph::Maker;

               my (@a, @b);
               @a = (2); @b = (1,1);
               $g = new Graph::Maker('uniform', N =&gt; 100, radius =&gt; 0.1, undirected =&gt; 1);
               @a = (2,3,1,2,1); @b = (2,2,1,3,1);
               $g2 = new Graph::Maker('uniform',
                       N =&gt; 100,
                       rad =&gt; 0.15,
                       dims =&gt; 3,
                       repel =&gt; 0.01,
                       random =&gt; sub { random_normal($_[0], 0, 0.5) }
               ); # make the nodes distributed over the cube with a gaussian (normal) distribution
               # work with the graph

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>new</b> <b>%params</b>
       Creates a uniform graph with N nodes randomly distributed over a dims-dimensional unit cube, where nodes
       are connected if they are within rad euclidian (L2) units of distance, and no nodes are within repel
       distance of eachother according to the random distribution.  The recognized parameters are N, rad, dims,
       repel, graph_maker, and random.  any others are passed onto Graph's constructor.  If N is not given it
       defaults to 0.  if rad is not given it defaults to 0.  If dims is not given it defaults to 2.  If repel
       is not given it defaults to 0.  if random is not given it defaults to uniform
       (Math::Random::Free::random_uniform(dims, 0, 1)), if random is given it is passed the number of random
       numbers that should be returned.  The vertex attribute pos will be set to an array reference of the nodes
       d-dimensional position.  If graph_maker is specified it will be called to create the Graph class as
       desired (for example if you have a subclass of Graph), this defaults to create a Graph with the
       parameters specified.
