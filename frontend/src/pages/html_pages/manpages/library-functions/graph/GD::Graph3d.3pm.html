       GD::Graph3D - Create 3D Graphs with GD and GD::Graph

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
               use GD::Graph::moduleName;
               my @data = (
                  ["Sun", "Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat"],
                  [ 1203,  3500,  3973,  2859,  3012,  3423,  1230]
               );
               my $graph = new GD::Graph::moduleName( 400, 300 );
               $graph-&gt;set(
                       x_label           =&gt; 'Day of the week',
                       y_label           =&gt; 'Number of hits',
                       title             =&gt; 'Daily Summary of Web Site',
               );
               my $gd = $graph-&gt;plot( \@data );

       Where <u>moduleName</u> is one of "bars3d", "lines3d" or "pie3d".

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This is the GD::Graph3d extensions module. It provides 3D graphs for the GD::Graph module by Martien
       Verbruggen, which in turn generates graph using Lincoln Stein's GD.pm.

       You use these modules just as you would any of the GD::Graph modules, except that they generate
       3d-looking graphs. Each graph type is described below with only the options that are unique to the 3d
       version. The modules are based on their 2d versions (e.g. GD::Graph::bars3d works like GD::Graph::bars),
       and support all the options in those. Make sure to read the documentation on GD::Graph.

       GD::Graph::pie3d
           This  is  merely a wrapper around GD::Graph::pie for consistency. It also sets 3d pie mode by default
           (which GD::Graph does as of version 1.22).  All options are exactly as in GD::Graph::pie.

       GD::Graph::bars3d
           This works like GD::Graph::bars, but draws 3d bars. The following settings  are  new  or  changed  in
           GD::Graph::bars3d.

           bar_depth
               Sets  the  z-direction depth of the bars. This defaults to 10. If you have a large number of bars
               or a small chart width, you may want  to  change  this.   A  visually  good  value  for  this  is
               approximately width_of_chart / number_of_bars.

           overwrite
               In  GD::Graph::bars,  multiple  series  of  bars  are  normally  drawn side-by-side.  You can set
               overwrite to 1 to tell it to draw each series behind the previous one. By setting overwrite to  2
               you can have them drawn on top of each other, that is the series are stacked.

           shading
               By default this is set to '1' and will shade and highlight the bars (and axes).  The light source
               is  at  top-left-center  which  scan well for most computer users. You can disable the shading of
               bars and axes by specifying a false value for this option.

       GD::Graph::lines3d
           This works like GD::Graph::lines, but draws 3d line. The following settings are  new  or  changed  in
           GD::Graph::line3d.

           line_depth
               Sets  the z-direction depth of the lines. This defaults to 10. If you have a large number of bars
               or a small chart width, you may want  to  change  this.   A  visually  good  value  for  this  is
               approximately width_of_chart / number_of_bars.

           shading
               By default this is set to '1' and will shade and highlight the line (and axes).  The light source
               is  at  top-left-center  which  scan well for most computer users. You can disable the shading of
               lines and axes by specifiying a false value for this option.

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       0.63 (6 December 2002)

</pre><h4><b>INSTALLATION</b></h4><pre>
       You will need to have the GD::Graph version 1.30 or later installed. You should also  have  Perl  version
       5.005 or 5.6 installed.

       To install, just do the normal:

               perl Makefile.PL
               make
               make install

       The documentation is in GD::Graph::Graph3d.pod.
