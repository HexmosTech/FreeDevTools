</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       CONOP1 - sets option switches for the Conran_family utility.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       CALL CONOP1 (IOPT)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       IOPT        Character,  input  --  Selects  an  internal  parameter  and  sets  an  option  switch.   The
                   possibilities are:

                    'DEF'
                    'EXT=ON' or 'EXT=OFF'
                    'GRI=ON' or 'GRI=OFF'
                    'ITP=C1' or 'ITP=LIN'
                    'LAB=ON' or 'LAB=OFF'
                    'LOT=ON' or 'LOT=OFF'
                    'MES=ON' or 'MES=OFF'
                    'PDV=ON' or 'PDV=OFF'
                    'PER=ON' or 'PER=OFF'
                    'PMM=ON' or 'PMM=OFF'
                    'PSL=ON' or 'PSL=OFF'
                    'REP=ON' or 'REP=OFF'
                    'SCA=ON' or 'SCA=OFF' or 'SCA=PRI'
                    'TFR=ON' or 'TFR=OFF'
                    'TOP=ON' or 'TOP=OFF'
                    'TRI=ON' or 'TRI=OFF'

                   The following options are defined by this subroutine:

       DEF         This option resets ALL parameters to their default values.  DEF has no 'ON' or 'OFF' states.

                   To activate: CALL CONOP1('DEF')

       EXT         Parameter to set extrapolation.  Normally all CONRAN versions will only plot  the  boundaries
                   of  the  convex  hull  defined by the user's data.  To have the contours fill the rectangular
                   area of the frame, set the EXT switch ON.  The default is OFF.

                   To turn on: CALL CONOP1('EXT=ON')

                   To turn off: CALL CONOP1('EXT=OFF')

       GRI         The parameter to display the grid.  GRI is OFF by default.

                   To turn on: CALL CONOP1('GRI=ON')

                   To turn off: CALL CONOP1('GRI=OFF')

                   Note: If GRI=ON, the virtual grid will be superimposed over the contour plot.  The  X  and  Y
                   tick intervals will be displayed under the map only if PER=ON.  (see PER)

       ITP         Set  the  interpolation  scheme.   There are two schemes  --  C1 surfaces and linear.  The C1
                   method takes longer but will give the best results when the data is  sparse  (less  than  100
                   points).   The  linear method will produce a better plot when there is a dense data set.  The
                   default is C1 surface.

                   For C1 surface CALL CONOP1('ITP=C1')

                   For linear  CALL CONOP1('ITP=LIN')

       LAB         This parameter can be set to either label  the  contours  (LAB=ON)  or  not  (LAB=OFF).   The
                   default value is LAB=ON.  (Does not apply to entry CONRAQ.)

                   To turn on: CALL CONOP1('LAB=ON')

                   To turn off: CALL CONOP1('LAB=OFF')

       LOT         The  parameter  to  list  options  on  the printer.  The default value is OFF: no options are
                   displayed.

                   To turn on: CALL CONOP1('LOT=ON')

                   To turn off: CALL CONOP1('LOT=OFF')

                   Note: Print is directed to the standard output unit.

       MES         The parameter to plot a message.  The default is ON.

                   To turn on: CALL CONOP1('MES=ON')

                   To turn off: CALL CONOP1('MES=OFF')

                   Note: If MES=ON, a message is printed below the plot giving contour intervals  and  execution
                   time in seconds.  If PER or GRI is ON, the message also contains the X and Y tick intervals.

       PDV         The parameter to plot the input data values.  The default value is PDV=OFF.

                   To turn on: CALL CONOP1('PDV=ON')

                   To turn off: CALL CONOP1('PDV=OFF')

                   Note:  If PDV=ON, the input data values are plotted relative to their location on the contour
                   map.  If you only wish to see the locations and not the values, set PDV=ON and change FMT  to
                   produce an asterisk (*) such as (I1).

       PER         The  parameter to draw a perimeter.  The default value is PER=ON, which causes a perimeter to
                   be drawn around the contour plot.

                   To turn on: CALL CONOP1('PER=ON')

                   To turn off: CALL CONOP1('PER=OFF')

                   Note: If MES is ON, the X and Y tick intervals will be given.  These  are  the  intervals  in
                   user coordinates that each tick mark represents.

       PMM         The  parameter  to  plot relative minima and maxima.  (Does not apply to entry CONRAQ.)  This
                   parameter is OFF by default.

                   To turn off:  CALL CONOP1('PMM=OFF')

                   To turn on:  CALL CONOP1('PMM=ON')

       PSL         The parameter which sets the plot shield option.  The outline of the shield will be drawn  on
                   the  same  frame  as  the  contour  plot.  (Does not apply to entry CONRAQ.)  By default this
                   option is OFF.

                   Draw the shield: CALL CONOP1('PSL=ON')

                   Don't draw it: CALL CONOP1('PSL=OFF')

                   Note:  See parameter SLD using "man conop3" to see how the polygon is entered  which  defines
                   the shield.

       REP         The  parameter  indicating the use of the same data in a new execution.  The default value is
                   OFF.

                   To turn on: CALL CONOP1('REP=ON')

                   To turn off: CALL CONOP1('REP=OFF')

                   Note: If REP=ON, the same X-Y data and triangulation are to be used, but it is  assumed  that
                   the  user  has  changed the contour values or resolution for this run.  Scratch arrays WK and
                   IWK must remain unchanged.

       SCA         The parameter for scaling of the plot on a frame.  This parameter is ON by default.

                   User scaling:  CALL CONOP1('SCA=OFF')

                   Program scaling: CALL CONOP1('SCA=ON')

                   Prior window:  CALL CONOP1('SCA=PRI')

                   If SCA=OFF, plotting instructions are issued using the  user's  input  coordinates.   SCA=OFF
                   should  be  used to interface with EZMAP.  If SCA=ON, a viewport is established such that the
                   plot will fit into the center 90 percent of the frame.  If  SCA=PRI,  the  program  maps  the
                   user's  plot  instructions into the portion of the frame defined by the current normalization
                   transformation.

       TFR         The parameter to advance the frame before triangulation.  The default value is TFR=ON,  which
                   means that the contours and the triangles will be plotted on separate frames.

                   If program set: CALL CONOP1('TFR=ON')

                   To turn off:  CALL CONOP1('TFR=OFF')

                   Note: Triangles are plotted after the contouring is completed.  To see the triangles over the
                   contours, set TFR=OFF.

       TOP         The parameter to plot only the triangles.

                   To turn off: CALL CONOP1('TOP=OFF')

                   To turn on: CALL CONOP1('TOP=ON')

                   Setting  TOP=ON  causes  parameters  TRI  and  TFR to be set to TRI=ON, and TFR=OFF.  Setting
                   TOP=OFF results in TRI=OFF and TFR=ON.  If another setting is wanted for either TRI  or  TFR,
                   it should be reset after the TOP call.

                   Note:  The  user  may  wish to overlay the triangles on some other plot.  'TOP=ON' will allow
                   that.

       TRI         The parameter to plot the triangulation.  The default is OFF and therefore the triangles  are
                   not drawn.

                   To turn on: CALL CONOP1('TRI=ON')

                   To turn off: CALL CONOP1('TRI=OFF')

                   Note:  Plotting  the  triangles  will  indicate  to  the  user  where  good and bad points of
                   interpolation are occurring in the  contour  map.   Equilateral  triangles  are  optimal  for
                   interpolation.   Quality  degrades as triangles approach a long and narrow shape.  The convex
                   hull of the triangulation is also a poor point of interpolation.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       CONOP1 is called to toggle Conran_family options before entries CONRAN, CONRAQ, or CONRAS are  called  to
       generate the contour plot.
