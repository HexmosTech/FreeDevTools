</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       App::Pinto::Command::roots - show the roots of a stack

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 0.14

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         pinto --root=REPOSITORY_ROOT roots [OPTIONS]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       !! THIS COMMAND IS EXPERIMENTAL !!

       This command lists the distributions that are the roots of the dependency tree that includes all the
       distributions in the stack.  In other words, it tells you which distributions or packages you would need
       to install from this stack to get all the other distribution in the stack.

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND</b> <b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       As an alternative to the "--stack" option, you can also specify the stack as an argument. So the
       following examples are equivalent:

         pinto --root REPOSITORY_ROOT list --stack dev
         pinto --root REPOSITORY_ROOT list dev

       A stack specified as an argument in this fashion will override any stack specified with the "--stack"
       option.  If a stack is not specified by neither argument nor option, then it defaults to the stack that
       is currently marked as the default stack.

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       --format FORMAT_SPECIFICATION
           Format of the output of each record using "printf"-style placeholders.  Valid placeholders are:

             Placeholder    Meaning
             -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
             %p             Package name
             %P             Package name-version
             %v             Package version
             %y             Pin status:                     (!) = is pinned
             %a             Distribution author
             %f             Distribution archive filename
             %m             Distribution maturity:          (d) = developer, (r) = release
             %M             Distribution main module
             %h             Distribution index path [1]
             %H             Distribution physical path [2]
             %s             Distribution origin:            (l) = local,     (f) = foreign
             %S             Distribution source
             %d             Distribution name
             %D             Distribution name-version
             %V             Distribution version
             %u             Distribution URI
             %%             A literal '%'

             [1]: The index path is always a Unix-style path fragment, as it
                  appears in the 02packages.details.txt index file.

             [2]: The physical path is always in the native style for this OS,
                  and is relative to the root directory of the repository.

           You  can  also  specify  the  minimum  field  widths and left or right justification, using the usual
           notation.  The default format is "%a/%f".

       --stack NAME
       -s NAME
           List the roots of the stack with the given  NAME.   Defaults  to  the  name  of  whichever  stack  is
           currently marked as the default stack.  Use the stacks command to see the stacks in the repository.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Install all modules in the stack in one shot:

         pinto -r /myrepo roots | cpanm --mirror-only --mirror file:///myrepo

       Generate a basic <u>cpanfile</u> that would install all modules in the stack:

         pinto -r /myrepo roots --format 'requires q{%M};' &gt; cpanfile

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
       This  list  of roots produced by this command is not always correct.  Many Perl distributions use dynamic
       configuration so you can't truly know what distributions need to be installed until you actually try  and
       install them.  Pinto relies entirely on the static META files to determine prerequisites.

       But  in  most  cases,  this  list  is  pretty accurate.  When it is wrong, it typically includes too many
       distributions rather than too few.  At best, this will have no impact because your  installer  will  have
       already  installed  them as prerequisites.  At worst, you may be installing a distribution that you don't
       really need.
