</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       IO::Pty - Pseudo TTY object class

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       1.20

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use IO::Pty;

           $pty = new IO::Pty;

           $slave  = $pty-&gt;slave;

           foreach $val (1..10) {
               print $pty "$val\n";
               $_ = &lt;$slave&gt;;
               print "$_";
           }

           close($slave);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       "IO::Pty" provides an interface to allow the creation of a pseudo tty.

       "IO::Pty" inherits from "IO::Handle" and so provide all the methods defined by the "IO::Handle" package.

       Please note that pty creation is very system-dependent.  If you have problems, see IO::Tty for help.

</pre><h4><b>CONSTRUCTOR</b></h4><pre>
       new
          The "new" constructor takes no arguments and returns a new file object which is the master side of the
          pseudo tty.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ttyname()</b>
           Returns  the  name of the slave pseudo tty. On UNIX machines this will be the pathname of the device.
           Use this name for informational purpose only, to get a slave filehandle, use <b>slave()</b>.

       <b>slave()</b>
           The "slave" method will return the slave filehandle of the given  master  pty,  opening  it  anew  if
           necessary.   If  IO::Stty  is  installed,  you  can then call "$slave-&gt;stty()" to modify the terminal
           settings.

       <b>close_slave()</b>
           The slave filehandle will be closed and destroyed.  This is necessary in the parent after forking  to
           get  rid of the open filehandle, otherwise the parent will not notice if the child exits.  Subsequent
           calls of slave() will return a newly opened slave filehandle.

       <b>make_slave_controlling_terminal()</b>
           This will set the slave filehandle as the controlling terminal of the  current  process,  which  will
           become a session leader, so this should only be called by a child process after a <b>fork()</b>, e.g. in the
           callback  to  sync_exec() (see Proc::SyncExec).  See the "try" script (also "test.pl") for an example
           how to correctly spawn a subprocess.

       <b>set_raw()</b>
           Will set the pty to raw.  Note that this is a  one-way  operation,  you  need  IO::Stty  to  set  the
           terminal settings to anything else.

           On some systems, the master pty is not a tty.  This method checks for that and returns success anyway
           on such systems.  Note that this method must be called on the slave, and probably should be called on
           the master, just to be sure, i.e.

             $pty-&gt;slave-&gt;set_raw();
             $pty-&gt;set_raw();

       clone_winsize_from(\*FH)
           Gets  the  terminal  size  from filehandle FH (which must be a terminal) and transfers it to the pty.
           Returns true on success and undef on failure.  Note that this must be called upon the <u>slave</u>, i.e.

            $pty-&gt;slave-&gt;clone_winsize_from(\*STDIN);

           On some systems, the master pty also isatty.  I actually have no idea if setting terminal sizes there
           is passed through to the slave, so if this method is called for a  master  that  is  not  a  tty,  it
           silently returns OK.

           See the "try" script for example code how to propagate SIGWINCH.

       <b>get_winsize()</b>
           Returns the terminal size, in a 4-element list.

            ($row, $col, $xpixel, $ypixel) = $tty-&gt;get_winsize()

       set_winsize($row, $col, $xpixel, $ypixel)
           Sets   the   terminal  size.  If  not  specified,  $xpixel  and  $ypixel  are  set  to  0.   As  with
           "clone_winsize_from", this must be called upon the <u>slave</u>.
