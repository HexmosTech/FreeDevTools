       tabset - Create and manipulate tabset widgets
_________________________________________________________________

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>tabset</b> <u>pathName</u> ?<u>options</u>?

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>tabset</b> widget displays a series of overlapping folders. Only the contents of one folder at a time is
       displayed.  By clicking on the tab's of a folder, you can view other folders.  Each  folder  may  contain
       any Tk widget that can be automatically positioned and resized in the folder.

       There's  no  limit  to  the  number  of  folders.   Tabs can be tiered or scrolled.  Pages (i.e. embedded
       widgets) can be torn off and displayed in another toplevel widget, and also restored.  A tabset can  also
       be  used  as just a set of tabs, without a displaying any pages.  You can bind events to individual tabs,
       so it's easy to add features like "balloon help".

</pre><h4><b>INTRODUCTION</b></h4><pre>
       Notebooks are a popular graphical paradigm.  They allow you to organize several windows that are too  big
       to display at the same time as pages of a notebook.  For example, your application may display several X-
       Y graphs at the same time.  The graphs are too big to pack into the same frame.  Managing them in several
       <b>toplevel</b>  widgets  is  also cumbersome and clutters the screen.  Instead, the <b>tabset</b> widget organizes the
       graphs as folders in a notebook.

       Only one page is visible at a time. When you click on a tab, the  folder  corresponding  to  the  tab  is
       displayed  in  the   <b>tabset</b>  widget.  The tabset also lets you temporarily tear pages out of the notebook
       into a separate toplevel widget, and put them back in the tabset later.  For example, you  could  compare
       two graphs side-by-side by tearing them out, and then replace them when you are finished.

       A  tabset can contain any number of folders.  If there are too many tabs to view, you can arrange them as
       multiple tiers or scroll the tabs. You can also attach Tk scrollbars to the tabset to scroll the tabs.

</pre><h4><b>SYNTAX</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>tabset</b> command creates a new window using the <u>pathName</u> argument and makes it into  a  tabset  widget.
       <b>tabset</b>  <u>pathName</u>  ?<u>option</u>  <u>value</u>?...   Additional  options may be specified on the command line or in the
       option database to configure aspects of the tabset such as its  colors,  font,  text,  and  relief.   The
       <b>tabset</b>  command returns its <u>pathName</u> argument.  At the time this command is invoked, there must not exist
       a window named <u>pathName</u>, but <u>pathName</u>'s parent must exist.

       When first created, a new tabset contains no tabs.  Tabs are added or  deleted  using  widget  operations
       described  below.  It  is  not  necessary  for all the tabs to be displayed in the tabset window at once;
       commands described below may be used to change the view in the window.  Tabsets allow scrolling  of  tabs
       using  the  <b>-scrollcommand</b>  option.   They  also  support scanning (see the <b>scan</b> operation).  Tabs may be
       arranged along any side of the tabset window using the <b>-side</b> option.

       The size of the tabset window is determined the number of tiers of tabs and the sizes of the  Tk  widgets
       embedded  inside  each  folder.   The  widest  widget  determines  the  width  of the folder. The tallest
       determines the height.  If no folders contain an embedded widget, the size is determined  solely  by  the
       size of the tabs.

       You can override either dimension with the tabset's <b>-width</b> and <b>-height</b> options.

</pre><h4><b>INDICES</b></h4><pre>
       Indices  refer  to individual tabs/folders in the tabset.  Many of the operations for tabset widgets take
       one or more indices as arguments.  An index may take several forms:

       <u>number</u>      Unique index offset of the tab.

       <b>@</b><u>x</u><b>,</b><u>y</u>        Tab that covers the point in the tabset window specified by <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> (in screen  coordinates).
                   If no tab covers that point, then the index is ignored.

       <b>select</b>      The  currently selected tab.  The <b>select</b> index is typically changed by either clicking on the
                   tab with the left mouse button or using the widget's <b>invoke</b> operation.

       <b>active</b>      The tab where the mouse pointer is currently located.  The label is drawn  using  its  active
                   colors  (see  the  <b>-activebackground</b>  and  <b>-activeforeground</b>  options).   The <b>active</b> index is
                   typically changed by moving the mouse pointer over a  tab  or  using  the  widget's  <b>activate</b>
                   operation.  There can be only one active tab at a time.  If there is no tab located under the
                   mouse pointer, the index is ignored.

       <b>begin</b>       First tab in the tabset.  If there are no tabs in the tabset then the index is ignored.

       <b>current</b>     Tab that is currently being operated upon.  Used within bindings.

       <b>focus</b>       Tab that currently has the widget's focus.  This tab is displayed with a dashed  line  around
                   its  label.   You  can  change  this using the <b>focus</b> operation. If no tab has focus, then the
                   index is ignored.

       <b>down</b>        Tab immediately below the tab that currently has focus, if there is one. If there is  no  tab
                   below, the current tab is returned.

       <b>left</b>        Tab  immediately  to the left the tab that currently has focus, if there is one.  If there is
                   no tab to the left, the current tab is returned.

       <b>next</b>        The next tab.  Wraps to the first tab if at end.

       <b>prev</b>        The previous tab.  Wraps to the last tab if at start.

       <b>right</b>       Tab immediately to the right the tab that currently has focus, if there is one. If  there  is
                   no tab to the right, the current tab is returned.

       <b>up</b>          Tab  immediately  above, if there is one, to the tab that currently has focus. If there is no
                   tab above, the current tab is returned.

       <b>end</b>         Last tab in the tabset.  If there are no tabs in the tabset then the index is ignored.

       Some indices may not always be available.  For example, if the mouse is not over any tab,  "active"  does
       not have an index.  For most tabset operations this is harmless and ignored.

</pre><h4><b>OPERATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       All  <b>tabset</b>  operations are invoked by specifying the widget's pathname, the operation, and any arguments
       that pertain to that operation.  The general form is:

            <u>pathName</u> <u>operation</u> ?<u>arg</u> <u>arg</u> <u>...</u>?

       <u>Operation</u> and the <u>arg</u>s determine the exact  behavior  of  the  command.   The  following  operations  are
       available for tabset widgets:

       <u>pathName</u> <b>activate</b> <u>index</u>
              Sets the active tab to the one indicated by <u>index</u>.  The active tab is drawn with its <u>active</u> colors
              (see  the  <b>-activebackground</b>  and  <b>-activeforeground</b>  options) and may be retrieved with the index
              <b>active</b>.  Only one tab may be active at a time.  If <u>index</u> is the empty string, then all  tabs  will
              be drawn with their normal foreground and background colors.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>bind</b> <u>tagName</u> ?<u>sequence</u>? ?<u>command</u>?
              Associates <u>command</u> with <u>tagName</u> such that whenever the event sequence given by <u>sequence</u> occurs for
              a  tab  with  this tag, <u>command</u> will be invoked.  The syntax is similar to the <b>bind</b> command except
              that it operates on tabs, rather than widgets.  The tagName is one  of  <b>all</b>,  <b>Perforation</b>,  <b>Image</b>,
              <b>Leftimage</b>,  <b>Startimage</b>,  <b>Endimage</b>,  or  the  name label used to create a Tab.  See the <b>bind</b> manual
              entry for complete details on <u>sequence</u> and the substitutions performed on <u>command</u>.

              If all arguments are specified then a new binding is created, replacing any existing  binding  for
              the  same  <u>sequence</u>  and <u>tagName</u>.  If the first character of <u>command</u> is <b>+</b> then <u>command</u> augments an
              existing binding rather than replacing it.  If no <u>command</u> argument is provided  then  the  command
              currently  associated  with <u>tagName</u> and <u>sequence</u> (it's an error occurs if there's no such binding)
              is returned.  If both <u>command</u> and <u>sequence</u> are missing then a list of all the event sequences  for
              which bindings have been defined for <u>tagName</u>.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>cget</b> <u>option</u>
              Returns the current value of the configuration option given by <u>option</u>.  <u>Option</u> may have any of the
              values accepted by the <b>configure</b> operation described in the section <b>WIDGET</b> <b>OPTIONS</b> below.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>configure</b> ?<u>option</u>? ?<u>value</u> <u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>...</u>?
              Query  or  modify  the  configuration options of the widget.  If no <u>option</u> is specified, returns a
              list describing all the available options for <u>pathName</u> (see <b>Tk_ConfigureInfo</b>  for  information  on
              the  format  of this list).  If <u>option</u> is specified with no <u>value</u>, then the command returns a list
              describing the one named option (this list will be identical to the corresponding sublist  of  the
              value  returned if no <u>option</u> is specified).  If one or more <u>option-value</u> pairs are specified, then
              the command modifies the given widget option(s) to have the given  value(s);   in  this  case  the
              command  returns  an  empty  string.  <u>Option</u> and <u>value</u> are described in the section <b>WIDGET</b> <b>OPTIONS</b>
              below.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>coords</b> <u>element</u> ?<u>index</u>?
              Returns the screen coordinates for the given <u>element</u>, which is one  of:  <b>text</b>,  <b>image</b>,  <b>leftimage</b>,
              <b>startimage</b>,  <b>endimage</b>, or <b>perforation</b>.  All except <b>startimage</b> and <b>endimage</b> must also provide a tab
              <u>index</u>.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>delete</b> <u>first</u> ?<u>last</u>?
              Deletes one or more tabs from the tabset.  <u>First</u> and <u>last</u> are the first and last indices, defining
              a range of tabs to be deleted.  If <u>last</u> isn't specified, then only the tab at <u>first</u> is deleted.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>focus</b> <u>index</u>
              Designates a tab to get the widget's focus.  This tab is displayed with a dashed line  around  its
              label.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>get</b> <u>index</u>
              Returns  the  name  of  the  tab.   The value of <u>index</u> may be in any form described in the section
              <b>INDICES</b> <b>.</b>

       <u>pathName</u> <b>hightlight</b> <u>index</u>
              Highlight a tab.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>index</b> ?<u>flag</u>? <u>string</u>
              Returns the index offset of the tab specified by <u>string</u>.  If <u>flag</u> is <b>-name</b>,  then  <u>string</u>  is  the
              name  of  a  tab.   If <u>flag</u> is <b>-index</b>, <u>string</u> is an index such as "active" or "focus".  If <u>flag</u> is
              <b>-both</b>, <u>string</u> is either.  If <u>flag</u> isn't specified, it defaults to <b>-index</b>.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>insert</b> <u>position</u> <u>?name</u> <u>...</u>? ?<u>option</u> <u>value</u>?...
              Inserts new tabs into the tabset.  Tabs are inserted  just  before  the  tab  given  by  <u>position</u>.
              <u>Position</u> may be either a number, indicating where in the list the new tab should be added, or <b>end</b>,
              indicating  that the new tab is to be added the end of the list.  <u>Name</u> is the symbolic name of the
              tab. <u>Be</u> <u>careful</u> <u>not</u> <u>to</u> <u>use</u> <u>a</u> <u>number.</u> <u>Otherwise</u> <u>the</u>  <u>tabset</u>  <u>will</u>  <u>confuse</u>  <u>it</u>  <u>with</u>  <u>tab</u>  <u>indices</u>.
              Returns a list of indices for all the new tabs.  If tab name is an empty string, or ends in #auto,
              it is generated using the given prefix.  The list of created tab names is returned.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>invoke</b> <u>index</u>
              Selects  the  tab  given  by  <u>index</u>,  maps  the tab's embedded widget, and invokes the Tcl command
              associated with the tab, if  there  is  one.  The return value is the return value  from  the  Tcl
              command,  or an empty string  if there  is  no  command  associated with the tab.  This command is
              ignored if the  tab's state (see the <b>-state</b> option) is disabled.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>move</b> <u>index</u> <b>before</b>|<b>after</b> <u>index</u>
              Moves the tab <u>index</u> to a new position in the tabset.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>nearest</b> <u>x</u> <u>y</u> ?<u>varName</u>? ?<u>coordsVar</u>?
              Returns the name of the tab nearest to given X-Y screen coordinate.  If the  argument  <u>varName</u>  is
              present,  this  is  a  Tcl  variable  that  is  set  to either <b>text</b>, <b>image</b>, <b>leftimage</b>, <b>startimage</b>,
              <b>endimage</b>, <b>perforation</b> or the empty string depending what part of the tab the coordinate  is  over.
              If  the  argument  <u>coordsVar</u>  is  present, return the bounding box coordinates coordinates for the
              matching item set in <u>varName</u>.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>perforation</b> <u>operation</u> ?<u>args</u>?
              This operation controls the perforation on the tab label.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>perforation</b> <b>activate</b> <u>boolean</u>
                     Set perforation active state to on or off.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>perforation</b> <b>invoke</b>
                     Invokes the command specified for perforations (see the <b>-perforationcommand</b> widget option).
                     Typically this command places the page into a top level widget. The name of the toplevel is
                     the concatonation of the <u>pathName</u>, "-",  and the <u>tabName</u>.  The return value is  the  return
                     value  from the Tcl command, or an empty string  if there  is  no  command  associated with
                     the tab.  This command is ignored if the  tab's state (see the <b>-state</b> option) is disabled.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>scan</b> <u>option</u> <u>args</u>
              This command implements scanning on tabsets.  It has two forms, depending on <u>option</u>:

              <u>pathName</u> <b>scan</b> <b>mark</b> <u>x</u> <u>y</u>
                     Records <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> and the current view in the tabset window;  used  with  later  <b>scan</b>  <b>dragto</b>
                     commands.   Typically  this  command is associated with a mouse button press in the widget.
                     It returns an empty string.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>scan</b> <b>dragto</b> <u>x</u> <u>y</u>.
                     This command computes the difference between its  <u>x</u>  and  <u>y</u>  arguments  and  the  <u>x</u>  and  <u>y</u>
                     arguments  to  the  last  <b>scan</b> <b>mark</b> command for the widget.  It then adjusts the view by 10
                     times the difference in coordinates.  This  command  is  typically  associated  with  mouse
                     motion  events  in  the  widget,  to  produce the effect of dragging the list at high speed
                     through the window.  The return value is an empty string.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>see</b> <u>index</u>
              Scrolls the tabset so that the tab <u>index</u> is visible in the widget's window.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>select</b> <u>index</u>
              Select the tab.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>size</b>
              Returns the number of tabs in the tabset.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>tab</b> <u>operation</u> ?<u>args</u>?

              <u>pathName</u> <b>tab</b> <b>cget</b> <u>nameOrIndex</u> <u>option</u>
                     Returns the current value of the configuration option given by <u>option</u>.  <u>Option</u> may have any
                     of the values accepted by the <b>tab</b> <b>configure</b> operation described in the section <b>TAB</b>  <b>OPTIONS</b>
                     below.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>tab</b> <b>configure</b> <u>nameOrIndex</u> ?<u>nameOrIndex</u>...? <u>option</u>? ?<u>value</u> <u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>...</u>?
                     Query  or modify the configuration options of one or more tabs.  If no <u>option</u> is specified,
                     this operation returns a  list  describing  all  the  available  options  for  <u>nameOrIndex</u>.
                     <u>NameOrIndex</u>  can  be  either the name of a tab or its index.  Names of tabs take precedence
                     over their indices.  That means a tab named <u>focus</u> is picked over the "focus" tab.

                     If <u>option</u> is specified, but not <u>value</u>, then a list  describing  the  one  named  option  is
                     returned.  If  one or more <u>option-value</u> pairs are specified, then each named tab (specified
                     by  <u>nameOrIndex</u>)  will  have  its configurations option(s) set the given value(s).  In this
                     last case, the empty string is returned.  <u>Option</u> and <u>value</u> are described in the section <b>TAB</b>
                     <b>OPTIONS</b> below.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>tab</b> <b>dockall</b>
                     Dock all tearoffs.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>tab</b> <b>names</b> ?<u>pattern</u>?
                     Returns the names of all the tabs matching the given pattern. If  no  <u>pattern</u>  argument  is
                     provided, then all tab names are returned.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>tab</b> <b>pageheight</b>

              <u>pathName</u> <b>tab</b> <b>pagewidth</b>

              <u>pathName</u> <b>tab</b> <b>select</b> <u>nameOrindex</u>
                     Select  a  tab  by  name or index, and cause it to become visible, selected, activated, and
                     receive focus.  This is a shortform for using separate commands.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>tab</b> <b>tearoff</b> ?<u>index</u>?
                     With no  ?<u>index</u>?, returns list of all torn-off tabs.  Otherwise, return the window for  the
                     given torn-off tab.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>tab</b> <b>tearoff</b> ?<u>index</u>?
              With no  ?<u>index</u>?, returns list of all torn-off tabs.  Otherwise, toggles the torn-off state of the
              tab.

       <u>pathName</u> <b>view</b> <u>args</u>
              This  command  queries  or changes the position of the tabset in the widget's window.  It can take
              any of the following forms:

              <u>pathName</u> <b>view</b>
                     Returns a list of two numbers between 0.0 and 1.0 that describe the amount and position  of
                     the  tabset  that  is visible in the window.  For example, if <u>view</u> is "0.2 0.6", 20% of the
                     tabset's text is off-screen to the left, 40% is visible in  the  window,  and  40%  of  the
                     tabset  is off-screen to the right.  These are the same values passed to scrollbars via the
                     <b>-scrollcommand</b> option.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>view</b> <b>moveto</b> <u>fraction</u>
                     Adjusts the view in the window so that <u>fraction</u> of the total width of the  tabset  text  is
                     off-screen to the left.  <u>fraction</u> must be a number between 0.0 and 1.0.

              <u>pathName</u> <b>view</b> <b>scroll</b> <u>number</u> <u>what</u>
                     This  command  shifts the view in the window (left/top or right/bottom) according to <u>number</u>
                     and <u>what</u>.  <u>Number</u> must be an integer. <u>What</u> must be either <b>units</b> or <b>pages</b> or an abbreviation
                     of these.  If <u>what</u> is <b>units</b>, the view adjusts left or right by <u>number</u> scroll units (see the
                     <b>-scrollincrement</b> option).  ; if it is <b>pages</b> then the view adjusts by <u>number</u> widget windows.
                     If <u>number</u> is negative then tabs farther to the left become visible; if it is positive  then
                     tabs farther to the right become visible.

       <b>-shadow</b> <u>color</u>
              Sets the shadow color for the text in the tab's label. Drop  shadows  are  useful  when  both  the
              foreground  and  background  of  the  tab  have  similar color intensities.  If <u>color</u> is the empty
              string, no shadow is drawn.  The default value is <b>""</b>.

       <b>-state</b> <u>state</u>
              Sets the state of the tab. If <u>state</u> is <b>disable</b> the text of  the  tab  is  drawn  as  engraved  and
              operations on the tab (such as <b>invoke</b> and <b>tab</b> <b>tearoff</b>) are ignored.  The default is <b>normal</b>.

       <b>-stipple</b> <u>bitmap</u>
              Specifies  a  stipple pattern to use for the background of the folder when the window is torn off.
              <u>Bitmap</u> specifies a bitmap to use as the stipple pattern. The default is <b>BLT</b>.

       <b>-text</b> <u>text</u>
              Specifies the text of the tab's label.  The exact way the text is drawn may be affected  by  other
              options such as <b>-state</b> or <b>-rotate</b>.

       <b>-tornwindow</b> <u>text</u>
              Name of window that was torn off.

       <b>-underline</b> <u>num</u>
              Character to underline in text.  Default is -1.

       <b>-window</b> <u>pathName</u>
              Specifies  the widget to be embedded into the tab.  <u>PathName</u> must be a child of the <b>tabset</b> widget.
              The tabset will "pack" and manage the size and placement of <u>pathName</u>.  The default value is <b>""</b>.

       <b>-windowheight</b> <u>pixels</u>
              Sets the requested height of the page.  The page is the area under the tab  used  to  display  the
              page  contents.   If  <u>pixels</u>  is  <b>0</b>,  the maximum height of all embedded tab windows is used.  The
              default is <b>0</b>.

       <b>-windowwidth</b> <u>pixels</u>
              Sets the requested width of the page.  The page is the area under the tab used to display the page
              contents.  If <u>pixels</u> is <b>0</b>, the maximum width of all embedded tab windows is used.  The default  is
              <b>0</b>.

</pre><h4><b>DEFAULT</b> <b>BINDINGS</b></h4><pre>
       BLT  automatically  generates  class  bindings that supply tabsets their default behaviors. The following
       event sequences are set by default for tabsets (via the class bind tag <b>Tabset</b>):

       <b>&lt;ButtonPress-2&gt;</b>

       <b>&lt;B2-Motion&gt;</b>

       <b>&lt;ButtonRelease-2&gt;</b>
              Mouse button 2 may be used for scanning.  If it is  pressed  and  dragged  over  the  tabset,  the
              contents of the tabset drag at high speed in the direction the mouse moves.

       <b>&lt;KeyPress-Up&gt;</b>

       <b>&lt;KeyPress-Down&gt;</b>
              The  up and down arrow keys move the focus to the tab immediately above or below the current focus
              tab.  The tab with focus is drawn with the a dashed outline around the tab label.

       <b>&lt;KeyPress-Left&gt;</b>

       <b>&lt;KeyPress-Right&gt;</b>
              The left and right arrow keys move the focus to the tab immediately to the left or  right  of  the
              current focus tab.  The tab with focus is drawn with the a dashed outline around the tab label.

       <b>&lt;KeyPress-space&gt;</b>

       <b>&lt;KeyPress-Return&gt;</b>
              The  space  and  return  keys select the current tab given focus.  When a folder is selected, it's
              command is invoked and the embedded widget is mapped.

       Each tab, by default, also has a set of bindings (via the tag <b>all</b>).  These bindings may  be  reset  using
       the tabset's <b>bind</b> operation.

       <b>&lt;Enter&gt;</b>

       <b>&lt;Leave&gt;</b>
              When  the  mouse  pointer enters a tab, it is activated (i.e. drawn in its active colors) and when
              the pointer leaves, it is redrawn in its normal colors.

       <b>&lt;ButtonRelease-1&gt;</b>
              Clicking with the left mouse button on a tab causes the tab to be selected and its Tcl script (see
              the <b>-command</b> or <b>-selectcommand</b> options) to be invoked.  The folder and any embedded widget (if one
              is specified) is automatically mapped.

       <b>&lt;ButtonRelease-3&gt;</b>

       <b>&lt;Control-ButtonRelease-1&gt;</b>
              Clicking on the right mouse button (or the left mouse button with the Control key held down) tears
              off the current page into its own toplevel widget. The embedded widget is  re-packed  into  a  new
              toplevel  and  an  outline  of  the widget is drawn in the folder.  Clicking again (toggling) will
              reverse this operation and replace the page back in the folder.

</pre><h4><b>BIND</b> <b>TAGS</b></h4><pre>
       You can bind commands to tabs that are triggered when a particular event sequence occurs  in  them,  much
       like  canvas  items  in  Tk's canvas widget.  Not all event sequences are valid.  The only binding events
       that may be specified are those related to the mouse and keyboard (such  as  <b>Enter</b>,  <b>Leave</b>,  <b>ButtonPress</b>,
       <b>Motion</b>, and <b>KeyPress</b>).

       It  is possible for multiple bindings to match a particular event.  This could occur, for example, if one
       binding is associated with the tab name and another is associated with the tab's tags (see the  <b>-bindtags</b>
       option).   When  this  occurs,  all the matching bindings are invoked.  A binding associated with the tab
       name is invoked first, followed by one binding for each of the tab's bindtags.   If  there  are  multiple
       matching  bindings  for a single tag, then only the most specific binding is invoked.  A continue command
       in a binding script terminates that script, and a break command terminates  that  script  and  skips  any
       remaining scripts for the event, just as for the bind command.

       The  <b>-bindtags</b> option for tabs controls addition tag names that can be matched.  Implicitly the first tag
       for each tab is its name.  Setting the value of the <b>-bindtags</b> option doesn't change this.

       Note that the &lt;&lt;TabsetTearoff&gt;&gt; virtual event is generated on tearoff.  and the &lt;&lt;TabsetSelect&gt;&gt;  virtual
       event is generated on selection.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       You create a tabset widget with the <b>tabset</b> command.

              # Create a new tabset
              tabset .ts -relief sunken -borderwidth 2

       A  new  Tcl  command  <b>.ts</b> is also created.  This command can be used to query and modify the tabset.  For
       example, to change the default font used by all the tab labels, you use the new command and the  tabset's
       <b>configure</b> operation.

              # Change the default font.
              .ts configure -font "fixed"

       You can then add folders using the <b>insert</b> operation.

              # Create a new folder "f1"
              .ts insert 0 "f1"

       This  inserts  the  new tab named "f1" into the tabset.  The index <b>0</b> indicates location to insert the new
       tab.  You can also use the index <b>end</b> to append a tab to the end of the tabset.  By default, the  text  of
       the tab is the name of the tab.  You can change this by configuring the <b>-text</b> option.

              # Change the label of "f1"
              .ts tab configure "f1" -text "Tab #1"

       The <b>insert</b> operation lets you add one or more folders at a time.

              .ts insert end "f2" -text "Tab #2" "f3" "f4"

       The  tab  on each folder contains a label.  A label may display both an image and a text string.  You can
       reconfigure the tab's attributes (foreground/background  colors,  font,  rotation,  etc)  using  the  <b>tab</b>
       <b>configure</b> operation.

              # Add an image to the label of "f1"
              set image [image create photo -file stopsign.gif]
              .ts tab configure "f1" -image $image
              .ts tab configure "f2" -rotate 90

       Each  folder may contain an embedded widget to represent its contents.  The widget to be embedded must be
       a child of the tabset widget.  Using the <b>-window</b> option, you specify the name of widget to  be  embedded.
       But don't pack the widget, the tabset takes care of placing and arranging the widget for you.

              graph .ts.graph
              .ts tab configure "f1" -window ".ts.graph" \
                  -fill both -padx 0.25i -pady 0.25i

       The size of the folder is determined the sizes of the Tk widgets embedded inside each folder.  The folder
       will  be  as wide as the widest widget in any folder. The tallest determines the height.  You can use the
       tab's <b>-pagewidth</b> and <b>-pageheight</b> options override this.

       Other options control how the widget appears in the folder.  The <b>-fill</b> option says that you wish to  have
       the widget stretch to fill the available space in the folder.

              .ts tab configure "f1" -fill both -padx 0.25i -pady 0.25i

       Now  when you click the left mouse button on "f1", the graph will be displayed in the folder.  It will be
       automatically hidden when another folder is selected.  If you  click  on  the  right  mouse  button,  the
       embedded  widget  will  be  moved  into  a toplevel widget of its own.  Clicking again on the right mouse
       button puts it back into the folder.

       If you want to share a page between two different folders, the <b>-command</b> option lets  you  specify  a  Tcl
       command  to  be  invoked  whenever  the folder is selected.  You can reset the <b>-window</b> option for the tab
       whenever it's clicked.

              .ts tab configure "f2" -command {
                  .ts tab configure "f2" -window ".ts.graph"
              }
              .ts tab configure "f1" -command {
                  .ts tab configure "f1" -window ".ts.graph"
              }

       If you have many folders, you may wish to stack tabs in  multiple  tiers.   The  tabset's  <b>-tiers</b>  option
       requests a maximum number of tiers.   The default is one tier.

              .ts configure -tiers 2

       If  the tabs can fit in less tiers, the widget will use that many.  Whenever there are more tabs than can
       be displayed in the maximum number of tiers, the tabset will automatically let you scroll the tabs.   You
       can even attach a scrollbar to the tabset.

              .ts configure -scrollcommand { .sbar set }  -scrollincrement 20
              .sbar configure -orient horizontal -command { .ts view }

       By  default  tabs are along the top of the tabset from left to right.  But tabs can be placed on any side
       of the tabset using the <b>-side</b> option.

              # Arrange tabs along the right side of the tabset.
              .ts configure -side right -rotate 270
