</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This package provides access to Amazon's Simple Storage Solution web service.

       As a quick summary, Amazon Simple Storage Solution provides a for-fee web service allowing the storage of
       arbitrary data as "resources" within "buckets" online.  See <u><a href="http://www.amazonaws.com/">http://www.amazonaws.com/</a></u> for details on that
       system.   Access  to  the  service  is via HTTP (SOAP or REST).  Much of this documentation will not make
       sense if you're not familiar with the terms and functionality of the Amazon S3 service.

       This package provides services for reading and writing the data items via the REST  interface.   It  also
       provides  some  higher-level  operations.   Other packages in the same distribution provide for even more
       functionality.

       INDEMNIFIES  THE  AUTHOR IN ALL WAYS.  This software is licensed under essentially the same terms as Tcl.
       See LICENSE.txt for the terms.

</pre><h4><b>ERROR</b> <b>REPORTING</b></h4><pre>
       The error reporting from this package makes use of $errorCode to provide more details  on  what  happened
       than  simply  throwing  an error.  Any error caught by the S3 package (and we try to catch them all) will
       return with an $errorCode being a list having at least three elements. In all cases,  the  first  element
       will  be "S3". The second element will take on one of six values, with that element defining the value of
       the third and subsequent elements. S3::REST does not throw an error, but rather returns a dictionary with
       the keys "error", "errorInfo", and "errorCode" set. This allows for reliable background use. The possible
       second elements are these:

       usage  The usage of the package is incorrect. For example, a command has been invoked which requires  the
              library  to  be  configured  before  the library has been configured, or an invalid combination of
              options has been specified. The third element of $errorCode supplies the  name  of  the  parameter
              that  was  wrong.  The  fourth  usually  provides the arguments that were actually supplied to the
              throwing proc, unless the usage error isn't confined to a single proc.

       local  Something happened on the local system which threw an error. For example, a request to  upload  or
              download a file was made and the file permissions denied that sort of access. The third element of
              $errorCode is the original $errorCode.

       socket Something  happened with the socket. It closed prematurely, or some other condition of failure-to-
              communicate-with-Amazon was detected. The third element of $errorCode is the original  $errorCode,
              or sometimes the message from fcopy, or ...?

       remote The  Amazon  web service returned an error code outside the 2xx range in the HTTP header. In other
              words, everything went as documented, except this particular case was documented not to work.  The
              third element is the dictionary returned from <b>::S3::REST</b>.  Note that S3::REST itself never  throws
              this  error,  but  just  returns  the  dictionary.  Most  of  the  higher-level commands throw for
              convenience, unless an argument indicates they should not. If  something  is  documented  as  "not
              throwing  an  S3  remote  error", it means a status return is set rather than throwing an error if
              Amazon returns a non-2XX HTTP result code.

       notyet The user obeyed the documentation, but the author has not yet gotten around to  implementing  this
              feature.  (Right  now,  only TLS support and sophisticated permissions fall into this category, as
              well as the S3::Acl command.)

       xml    The service has returned invalid XML, or XML  whose  schema  is  unexpected.  For  the  high-level
              commands that accept service XML as input for parsing, this may also be thrown.

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       This package provides several separate levels of complexity.

       â€¢      The  lowest  level  simply  takes  arguments  to be sent to the service, sends them, retrieves the
              result, and provides it to the caller.  <u>Note:</u> This layer allows both synchronous and  event-driven
              processing.  It  depends  on  the  MD5  and  SHA1  and  base64  packages from Tcllib (available at
              <u><a href="http://core.tcl.tk/tcllib/">http://core.tcl.tk/tcllib/</a></u>).  Note that <b>S3::Configure</b> is required for <b>S3::REST</b> to work due to  the
              authentication portion, so we put that in the "lowest level."

       â€¢      The  next  layer  parses  the  results of calls, allowing for functionality such as uploading only
              changed files, synchronizing directories, and so on.  This layer depends on the <b>TclXML</b> package  as
              well  as  the  included  <b>xsxp</b>  package.  These  packages  are  package  required  when these more-
              sophisticated routines are called, so nothing breaks if they are not correctly installed.

       â€¢      Also included is a separate program that uses the library.  It provides code to parse  $argv0  and
              $argv from the command line, allowing invocation as a tclkit, etc.  (Not yet implmented.)

       â€¢      Another  separate  program  provides  a  GUI  interface  allowing  drag-and-drop  and  other  such
              functionality. (Not yet implemented.)

       â€¢      Also built on this package is the OddJob program. It is  a  separate  program  designed  to  allow
              distribution of computational work units over Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud web service.

       The  goal  is to have at least the bottom-most layers implemented in pure Tcl using only that which comes
       from widely-available sources, such as Tcllib.

</pre><h4><b>LOW</b> <b>LEVEL</b> <b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       These commands do not require any packages not listed above.  They talk directly to the service, or  they
       are  utility or configuration routines. Note that the "xsxp" package was written to support this package,
       so it should be available wherever you got this package.

       <b>S3::Configure</b> ?<b>-reset</b> <u>boolean</u>? ?<b>-retries</b> <u>integer</u>? ?<b>-accesskeyid</b> <u>idstring</u>? ?<b>-secretaccesskey</b> <u>idstring</u>?
       ?<b>-service-access-point</b> <u>FQDN</u>? ?<b>-use-tls</b> <u>boolean</u>? ?<b>-default-compare</b>
       <u>always|never|exists|missing|newer|date|checksum|different</u>? ?<b>-default-separator</b> <u>string</u>? ?<b>-default-acl</b>
       <u>private|public-read|public-read-write|authenticated-read|keep|calc</u>? ?<b>-default-bucket</b> <u>bucketname</u>?
              There is one command for configuration, and that is <b>S3::Configure</b>.  If called with  no  arguments,
              it  returns  a  dictionary  of  key/value  pairs listing all current settings.  If called with one
              argument, it returns the value of that single argument.  If called with two or more arguments,  it
              must  be  called  with pairs of arguments, and it applies the changes in order.  There is only one
              set of configuration information per interpreter.

              The following options are accepted:

              <b>-reset</b> <u>boolean</u>
                     By default, false.  If true, any previous changes and any changes on the same  call  before
                     the reset option will be returned to default values.

              <b>-retries</b> <u>integer</u>
                     Default  value  is  3.  If Amazon returns a 500 error, a retry after an exponential backoff
                     delay will be tried this many times before finally throwing the 500 error. This applies  to
                     each call to <b>S3::REST</b> from the higher-level commands, but not to <b>S3::REST</b> itself.  That is,
                     <b>S3::REST</b>  will  always  return  httpstatus  500  if that's what it receives. Functions like
                     <b>S3::Put</b> will retry the PUT call, and will also retry the GET and  HEAD  calls  used  to  do
                     content  comparison.   Changing this to 0 will prevent retries and their associated delays.
                     In addition, socket errors (i.e., errors whose errorCode starts with "S3 socket")  will  be
                     similarly retried after backoffs.

              <b>-accesskeyid</b> <u>idstring</u>

              <b>-secretaccesskey</b> <u>idstring</u>
                     Each  defaults  to  an  empty string.  These must be set before any calls are made. This is
                     your S3 ID.  Once you sign up for an account, go to <u><a href="http://www.amazonaws.com/">http://www.amazonaws.com/</a></u>, sign in,  go
                     to  the  "Your Web Services Account" button, pick "AWS Access Identifiers", and your access
                     key ID and secret access keys will be available.  All  <b>S3::REST</b>  calls  are  authenticated.
                     Blame Amazon for the poor choice of names.

              <b>-service-access-point</b> <u>FQDN</u>
                     Defaults  to  "s3.amazonaws.com".  This is the fully-qualified domain name of the server to
                     contact for <b>S3::REST</b> calls. You should probably never need to touch  this,  unless  someone
                     else implements a compatible service, or you wish to test something by pointing the library
                     at your own service.

              <b>-slop-seconds</b> <u>integer</u>
                     When  comparing  dates  between  Amazon  and  the local machine, two dates within this many
                     seconds of each  other  are  considered  the  same.  Useful  for  clock  drift  correction,
                     processing overhead time, and so on.

              <b>-use-tls</b> <u>boolean</u>
                     Defaults  to  false.  This  is  not yet implemented. If true, <b>S3::REST</b> will negotiate a TLS
                     connection to Amazon. If false, unencrypted connections are used.

              <b>-bucket-prefix</b> <u>string</u>
                     Defaults to "TclS3".  This string is used  by  <b>S3::SuggestBucketName</b>  if  that  command  is
                     passed  an  empty  string  as an argument. It is used to distinguish different applications
                     using the Amazon service.  Your application should always set this to keep from interfering
                     with the buckets of other users of Amazon S3 or with other buckets of the same user.

              <b>-default-compare</b> <u>always|never|exists|missing|newer|date|checksum|different</u>
                     Defaults to "always." If no -compare is specified on <b>S3::Put</b>, <b>S3::Get</b>, or <b>S3::Delete</b>,  this
                     comparison is used.  See those commands for a description of the meaning.

              <b>-default-separator</b> <u>string</u>
                     Defaults to "/". This is currently unused. It might make sense to use this for <b>S3::Push</b> and
                     <b>S3::Pull</b>,  but  allowing  resources  to  have  slashes  in  their names that aren't marking
                     directories would be problematic. Hence, this currently does nothing.

              <b>-default-acl</b> <u>private|public-read|public-read-write|authenticated-read|keep|calc</u>
                     Defaults to an empty string. If no -acl argument is provided to <b>S3::Put</b> or  <b>S3::Push</b>,  this
                     string  is used (given as the x-amz-acl header if not keep or calc). If this is also empty,
                     no x-amz-acl header is generated.  This is <u>not</u> used by <b>S3::REST</b>.

              <b>-default-bucket</b> <u>bucketname</u>
                     If no bucket is given to <b>S3::GetBucket</b>, <b>S3::PutBucket</b>, <b>S3::Get</b>, <b>S3::Put</b>, <b>S3::Head</b>, <b>S3::Acl</b>,
                     <b>S3::Delete</b>, <b>S3::Push</b>, <b>S3::Pull</b>, or <b>S3::Toss</b>, and if this configuration variable is  not  an
                     empty  string  (and  not  simply "/"), then this value will be used for the bucket. This is
                     useful if one program does a large amount of resource manipulation within a single bucket.

       <b>S3::SuggestBucket</b> ?<u>name</u>?
              The <b>S3::SuggestBucket</b> command accepts an optional string as a prefix and returns  a  valid  bucket
              containing the <u>name</u> argument and the Access Key ID. This makes the name unique to the owner and to
              the  application  (assuming  the application picks a good <u>name</u> argument).  If no name is provided,
              the name from <b>S3::Configure</b> <u>-bucket-prefix</u> is used.  If that  too  is  empty  (which  is  not  the
              default), an error is thrown.

       <b>S3::REST</b> <u>dict</u>
              The  <b>S3::REST</b>  command  takes  as  an  argument a dictionary and returns a dictionary.  The return
              dictionary has the same keys as the input dictionary, and includes additional keys as the  result.
              The  presence  or absence of keys in the input dictionary can control the behavior of the routine.
              It never throws an error directly, but includes keys  "error",  "errorInfo",  and  "errorCode"  if
              necessary.   Some keys are required, some optional. The routine can run either in blocking or non-
              blocking mode, based on the presense of <b>resultvar</b> in  the  input  dictionary.  This  requires  the
              <u>-accesskeyid</u> and <u>-secretaccesskey</u> to be configured via <b>S3::Configure</b> before being called.

              The possible input keys are these:

              <b>verb</b> <u>GET|PUT|DELETE|HEAD</u>
                     This required item indicates the verb to be used.

              <b>resource</b> <u>string</u>
                     This  required  item  indicates  the  resource to be accessed.  A leading / is added if not
                     there already. It will be URL-encoded for you if necessary. Do not supply a  resource  name
                     that is already URL-encoded.

              ?<b>rtype</b> <u>torrent|acl</u>?
                     This  indicates a torrent or acl resource is being manipulated.  Do not include this in the
                     <b>resource</b> key, or the "?" separator will get URL-encoded.

              ?<b>parameters</b> <u>dict</u>?
                     This optional dictionary provides parameters added to the URL for the transaction. The keys
                     must be in the correct case (which is confusing in the Amazon documentation) and the values
                     must be valid. This can be an empty dictionary or omitted entirely  if  no  parameters  are
                     desired. No other error checking on parameters is performed.

              ?<b>headers</b> <u>dict</u>?
                     This optional dictionary provides headers to be added to the HTTP request. The keys must be
                     in <u>lower</u> <u>case</u> for the authentication to work. The values must not contain embedded newlines
                     or   carriage  returns.  This  is  primarily  useful  for  adding  x-amz-*  headers.  Since
                     authentication is calculated by <b>S3::REST</b>, do not add that header here.  Since  content-type
                     gets its own key, also do not add that header here.

              ?<b>inbody</b> <u>contentstring</u>?
                     This  optional  item,  if  provided, gives the content that will be sent. It is sent with a
                     tranfer encoding of binary, and only the low bytes are used,  so  use  [encoding  convertto
                     utf-8]  if  the  string  is a utf-8 string. This is written all in one blast, so if you are
                     using non-blocking mode and the <b>inbody</b> is especially large, you may wind up blocking on the
                     write socket.

              ?<b>infile</b> <u>filename</u>?
                     This optional item, if provided, and if <b>inbody</b> is not provided, names the file  from  which
                     the  body  of the HTTP message will be constructed. The file is opened for reading and sent
                     progressively by [fcopy], so it should not block in non-blocking mode even if the  file  is
                     very large. The file is transfered in binary mode, so the bytes on your disk will match the
                     bytes in your resource. Due to HTTP restrictions, it must be possible to use [file size] on
                     this file to determine the size at the start of the transaction.

              ?<b>S3chan</b> <u>channel</u>?
                     This  optional  item,  if  provided,  indicates  the  already-open  socket  over  which the
                     transaction should be conducted. If not provided, a  connection  is  made  to  the  service
                     access  point  specified  via <b>S3::Configure</b>, which is normally s3.amazonaws.com. If this is
                     provided, the channel is not closed at the end of the transaction.

              ?<b>outchan</b> <u>channel</u>?
                     This optional item, if provided, indicates the  already-open  channel  to  which  the  body
                     returned from S3 should be written. That is, to retrieve a large resource, open a file, set
                     the  translation mode, and pass the channel as the value of the key outchan. Output will be
                     written to the channel in pieces so memory does not fill up unnecessarily. The  channel  is
                     not closed at the end of the transaction.

              ?<b>resultvar</b> <u>varname</u>?
                     This  optional  item, if provided, indicates that <b>S3::REST</b> should run in non-blocking mode.
                     The <u>varname</u> should be fully qualified with respect to namespaces and cannot be local  to  a
                     proc.  If  provided,  the  result  of  the  <b>S3::REST</b> call is assigned to this variable once
                     everything has completed; use trace or vwait to know when this has happened.  If  this  key
                     is  not  provided,  the result is simply returned from the call to <b>S3::REST</b> and no calls to
                     the eventloop are invoked from within this call.

              ?<b>throwsocket</b> <u>throw|return</u>?
                     This optional item, if provided, indicates that <b>S3::REST</b> should throw an error if throwmode
                     is throw and a socket error is encountered.  It indicates that <b>S3::REST</b> should  return  the
                     error  code  in the returned dictionary if a socket error is encountered and this is set to
                     return. If <b>throwsocket</b> is set to <u>return</u> or if the call is not blocking, then a socket error
                     (i.e., an error whose error code starts with "S3 socket" will be returned in the dictionary
                     as <b>error</b>, <b>errorInfo</b>, and <b>errorCode</b>.  If a foreground call is made (i.e., <b>resultvar</b>  is  not
                     provided),  and  this option is not provided or is set to <u>throw</u>, then <b>error</b> will be invoked
                     instead.

       Once the call to <b>S3::REST</b> completes, a new dict is returned, either in the <u>resultvar</u> or as the result  of
       execution.  This dict is a copy of the original dict with the results added as new keys. The possible new
       keys are these:

              <b>error</b> <u>errorstring</u>

              <b>errorInfo</b> <u>errorstring</u>

              <b>errorCode</b> <u>errorstring</u>
                     If an error is caught, these three keys will be set in the result.  Note that <b>S3::REST</b> does
                     <u>not</u> consider a non-2XX HTTP return code as an error. The <b>errorCode</b> value will be  formatted
                     according  to  the <b>ERROR</b> <b>REPORTING</b> description.  If these are present, other keys described
                     here might not be.

              <b>httpstatus</b> <u>threedigits</u>
                     The three-digit code from the HTTP transaction. 2XX for good, 5XX for server error, etc.

              <b>httpmessage</b> <u>text</u>
                     The textual result after the status code. "OK" or "Forbidden" or etc.

              <b>outbody</b> <u>contentstring</u>
                     If <u>outchan</u> was not specified, this key will hold a reference to the (unencoded) contents of
                     the body returned.  If Amazon returned an error (a la the httpstatus not a 2XX value),  the
                     error message will be in <b>outbody</b> or written to <b>outchan</b> as appropriate.

              <b>outheaders</b> <u>dict</u>
                     This  contains a dictionary of headers returned by Amazon.  The keys are always lower case.
                     It's mainly useful for finding the x-amz-meta-* headers, if any, although things like last-
                     modified and content-type are also useful.  The keys of this dictionary  are  always  lower
                     case.  Both keys and values are trimmed of extraneous whitespace.

</pre><h4><b>HIGH</b> <b>LEVEL</b> <b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       The  routines  in this section all make use of one or more calls to <b>S3::REST</b> to do their work, then parse
       and manage the data in a convenient way.  All these commands throw errors as described in <b>ERROR</b> <b>REPORTING</b>
       unless otherwise noted.

       In all these commands, all arguments are presented as name/value pairs, in any order.  All  the  argument
       names start with a hyphen.

       There  are a few options that are common to many of the commands, and those common options are documented
       here.

       <b>-blocking</b> <u>boolean</u>
              If provided and specified as false, then any calls to <b>S3:REST</b> will be non-blocking, and internally
              these routines will call [vwait] to get the results. In other words, these  routines  will  return
              the same value, but they'll have event loops running while waiting for Amazon.

       <b>-parse-xml</b> <u>xmlstring</u>
              If  provided,  the routine skips actually communicating with Amazon, and instead behaves as if the
              XML string provided was returned as the body of the call. Since several of  these  routines  allow
              the  return of data in various formats, this argument can be used to parse existing XML to extract
              the bits of information that are needed. It's also helpful for testing.

       <b>-bucket</b> <u>bucketname</u>
              Almost every high-level command needs to know what  bucket  the  resources  are  in.  This  option
              specifies  that.  (Only  the  command  to list available buckets does not require this parameter.)
              This does not need to be URL-encoded, even if it contains special or non-ASCII characters. May  or
              may  not  contain  leading  or  trailing  spaces  -  commands normalize the bucket. If this is not
              supplied, the value is taken from <b>S3::Configure</b> <b>-default-bucket</b> if that string isn't  empty.  Note
              that spaces and slashes are always trimmed from both ends and the rest must leave a valid bucket.

       <b>-resource</b> <u>resourcename</u>
              This specifies the resource of interest within the bucket.  It may or may not start with a slash -
              both cases are handled.  This does not need to be URL-encoded, even if it contains special or non-
              ASCII characters.

       <b>-compare</b> <u>always|never|exists|missing|newer|date|checksum|different</u>
              When  commands copy resources to files or files to resources, the caller may specify that the copy
              should be skipped if the contents are the same. This argument specifies the conditions under which
              the files should be copied. If it is not passed, the result of <b>S3::Configure</b>  <b>-default-compare</b>  is
              used, which in turn defaults to "always." The meanings of the various values are these:

              <u>always</u> Always copy the data. This is the default.

              <u>never</u>  Never copy the data. This is essentially a no-op, except in <b>S3::Push</b> and <b>S3::Pull</b> where the
                     -delete flag might make a difference.

              <u>exists</u> Copy the data only if the destination already exists.

              <u>missing</u>
                     Copy the data only if the destination does not already exist.

              <u>newer</u>  Copy the data if the destination is missing, or if the date on the source is newer than the
                     date  on  the destination by at least <b>S3::Configure</b> <b>-slop-seconds</b> seconds. If the source is
                     Amazon, the date is taken from the Last-Modified header. If the  source  is  local,  it  is
                     taken  as  the mtime of the file. If the source data is specified in a string rather than a
                     file, it is taken as right now, via [clock seconds].

              <u>date</u>   Like <u>newer</u>, except copy if the date is newer <u>or</u> older.

              <u>checksum</u>
                     Calculate the MD5 checksum on the local file or string, ask Amazon  for  the  eTag  of  the
                     resource,  and copy the data if they're different. Copy the data also if the destination is
                     missing. Note that this can be slow with large local files unless the C version of the  MD5
                     support is available.

              <u>different</u>
                     Copy  the  data if the destination does not exist.  If the destination exists and an actual
                     file name was specified (rather than a content string), and the date on  the  file  differs
                     from the date on the resource, copy the data.  If the data is provided as a content string,
                     the  "date"  is treated as "right now", so it will likely always differ unless slop-seconds
                     is large.  If the dates are the same, the MD5 checksums  are  compared,  and  the  data  is
                     copied if the checksums differ.

       Note  that "newer" and "date" don't care about the contents, and "checksum" doesn't care about the dates,
       but "different" checks both.

       <b>S3::ListAllMyBuckets</b> ?<b>-blocking</b> <u>boolean</u>? ?<b>-parse-xml</b> <u>xmlstring</u>? ?<b>-result-type</b>
       <u>REST|xml|pxml|dict|names|owner</u>?
              This routine performs a GET on the Amazon S3 service, which is defined to return a list of buckets
              owned by the account identified by the authorization header. (Blame Amazon for the dumb names.)

              <b>-blocking</b> <u>boolean</u>
                     See above for standard definition.

              <b>-parse-xml</b> <u>xmlstring</u>
                     See above for standard definition.

              <b>-result-type</b> <u>REST</u>
                     The dictionary returned by <b>S3::REST</b> is the return value of  <b>S3::ListAllMyBuckets</b>.  In  this
                     case,  a  non-2XX httpstatus will not throw an error. You may not combine this with <u>-parse-</u>
                     <u>xml</u>.

              <b>-result-type</b> <u>xml</u>
                     The raw XML of the body is returned as the result (with no encoding applied).

              <b>-result-type</b> <u>pxml</u>
                     The XML of the body as parsed by <b>xsxp::parse</b> is returned.

              <b>-result-type</b> <u>dict</u>
                     A dictionary of interesting portions of the XML is returned. The  dictionary  contains  the
                     following keys:

                     Owner/ID
                            The Amazon AWS ID (in hex) of the owner of the bucket.

                     Owner/DisplayName
                            The Amazon AWS ID's Display Name.

                     Bucket/Name
                            A list of names, one for each bucket.

                     Bucket/CreationDate
                            A  list  of  dates,  one  for  each bucket, in the same order as Bucket/Name, in ISO
                            format (as returned by Amazon).

              <b>-result-type</b> <u>names</u>
                     A list of bucket names is returned with all other information stripped out.   This  is  the
                     default result type for this command.

              <b>-result-type</b> <u>owner</u>
                     A  list  containing  two elements is returned. The first element is the owner's ID, and the
                     second is the owner's display name.

       <b>S3::PutBucket</b> ?<b>-bucket</b> <u>bucketname</u>? ?<b>-blocking</b> <u>boolean</u>? ?<b>-acl</b> <u>{}|private|public-read|public-read-</u>
       <u>write|authenticated-read</u>?
              This command creates a bucket if it does not already exist. Bucket names are globally  unique,  so
              you   may   get   a  "Forbidden"  error  from  Amazon  even  if  you  cannot  see  the  bucket  in
              <b>S3::ListAllMyBuckets</b>. See <b>S3::SuggestBucket</b> for ways to minimize this risk. The  x-amz-acl  header
              comes from the <b>-acl</b> option, or from <b>S3::Configure</b> <b>-default-acl</b> if not specified.

       <b>S3::DeleteBucket</b> ?<b>-bucket</b> <u>bucketname</u>? ?<b>-blocking</b> <u>boolean</u>?
              This  command  deletes  a  bucket if it is empty and you have such permission.  Note that Amazon's
              list of buckets is a global resource, requiring far-flung synchronization. If you delete a bucket,
              it may be quite a few minutes (or hours) before you can recreate it,  yielding  "Conflict"  errors
              until then.

       <b>S3::GetBucket</b> ?<b>-bucket</b> <u>bucketname</u>? ?<b>-blocking</b> <u>boolean</u>? ?<b>-parse-xml</b> <u>xmlstring</u>? ?<b>-max-count</b> <u>integer</u>?
       ?<b>-prefix</b> <u>prefixstring</u>? ?<b>-delimiter</b> <u>delimiterstring</u>? ?<b>-result-type</b> <u>REST|xml|pxml|names|dict</u>?
              This lists the contents of a bucket. That is, it returns a directory listing of resources within a
              bucket, rather than transfering any user data.

              <b>-bucket</b> <u>bucketname</u>
                     The standard bucket argument.

              <b>-blocking</b> <u>boolean</u>
                     The standard blocking argument.

              <b>-parse-xml</b> <u>xmlstring</u>
                     The standard parse-xml argument.

              <b>-max-count</b> <u>integer</u>
                     If  supplied, this is the most number of records to be returned.  If not supplied, the code
                     will iterate until all records have been found.  Not compatible with -parse-xml. Note  that
                     if  this  is supplied, only one call to <b>S3::REST</b> will be made. Otherwise, enough calls will
                     be made to exhaust the listing, buffering results in memory, so take care if you  may  have
                     huge buckets.

              <b>-prefix</b> <u>prefixstring</u>
                     If  present,  restricts  listing  to  resources  with a particular prefix. One leading / is
                     stripped if present.

              <b>-delimiter</b> <u>delimiterstring</u>
                     If present, specifies a delimiter for the listing.  The presence  of  this  will  summarize
                     multiple  resources  into  one  entry,  as  if  S3  supported  directories.  See the Amazon
                     documentation for details.

              <b>-result-type</b> <u>REST|xml|pxml|names|dict</u>
                     This indicates the format of the return result of the command.

                     REST   If <u>-max-count</u> is specified, the dictionary returned from <b>S3::REST</b>  is  returned.  If
                            <u>-max-count</u> is not specified, a list of all the dictionaries returned from the one or
                            more calls to <b>S3::REST</b> is returned.

                     xml    If  <u>-max-count</u>  is  specified, the body returned from <b>S3::REST</b> is returned. If <u>-max-</u>
                            <u>count</u> is not specified, a list of all the bodies returned from the one or more calls
                            to <b>S3::REST</b> is returned.

                     pxml   If <u>-max-count</u> is specified, the body  returned  from  <b>S3::REST</b>  is  passed  throught
                            <b>xsxp::parse</b>  and  then  returned.  If <u>-max-count</u> is not specified, a list of all the
                            bodies returned from the one or more calls  to  <b>S3::REST</b>  are  each  passed  through
                            <b>xsxp::parse</b> and then returned.

                     names  Returns  a  list  of  all  names  found  in  either  the  Contents/Key fields or the
                            CommonPrefixes/Prefix fields. If no <u>-delimiter</u> is specified  and  no  <u>-max-count</u>  is
                            specified, this returns a list of all resources with the specified <u>-prefix</u>.

                     dict   Returns  a  dictionary.  (Returns  only  one  dictionary  even  if <u>-max-count</u> wasn't
                            specified.) The keys of the dictionary are as follows:

                            Name   The name of the bucket (from the final call to <b>S3::REST</b>).

                            Prefix From the final call to <b>S3::REST</b>.

                            Marker From the final call to <b>S3::REST</b>.

                            MaxKeys
                                   From the final call to <b>S3::REST</b>.

                            IsTruncated
                                   From the final call to  <b>S3::REST</b>,  so  always  false  if  <u>-max-count</u>  is  not
                                   specified.

                            NextMarker
                                   Always  provided  if  IsTruncated  is true, and calculated of Amazon does not
                                   provide it. May be empty if IsTruncated is false.

                            Key    A list of  names  of  resources  in  the  bucket  matching  the  <u>-prefix</u>  and

              This command sends data to a resource on Amazon's servers for storage, using the HTTP PUT command.
              It  returns  0 if the <b>-compare</b> mode prevented the transfer, 1 if the transfer worked, or throws an
              error if the transfer was attempted but failed.  Server  5XX  errors  and  S3  socket  errors  are
              retried  according  to <b>S3:Configure</b> <b>-retries</b> settings before throwing an error; other errors throw
              immediately.

              <b>-bucket</b>
                     This specifies the bucket into which the resource will be written.  Leading and/or trailing
                     slashes are removed for you, as are spaces.

              <b>-resource</b>
                     This is the full name of the resource within the bucket. A single leading slash is removed,
                     but not a trailing slash.  Spaces are not trimmed.

              <b>-blocking</b>
                     The standard blocking flag.

              <b>-file</b>  If this is specified, the <u>filename</u> must exist, must be readable, and must not be a  special
                     or directory file. [file size] must apply to it and must not change for the lifetime of the
                     call.   The  default  content-type  is  calculated based on the name and/or contents of the
                     file. Specifying this is an error if <b>-content</b> is also specified, but at least one of  <b>-file</b>
                     or  <b>-content</b>  must  be  specified.  (The file is allowed to not exist or not be readable if
                     <b>-compare</b> <u>never</u> is specified.)

              <b>-content</b>
                     If this is specified, the <u>contentstring</u> is sent as the body of the resource.  The  content-
                     type  defaults  to  "application/octet-string".   Only the low bytes are sent, so non-ASCII
                     should use the appropriate encoding (such as [encoding convertto utf-8]) before passing  it
                     to  this routine, if necessary. Specifying this is an error if <b>-file</b> is also specified, but
                     at least one of <b>-file</b> or <b>-content</b> must be specified.

              <b>-acl</b>   This defaults to <b>S3::Configure</b> <b>-default-acl</b> if not specified.  It sets the x-amz-acl header
                     on the PUT operation.  If the value provided is <u>calc</u>, the x-amz-acl  header  is  calculated
                     based on the I/O permissions of the file to be uploaded; it is an error to specify <u>calc</u> and
                     <b>-content</b>.   If  the  value provided is <u>keep</u>, the acl of the resource is read before the PUT
                     (or the default is used if the resource does not exist), then set back to what it was after
                     the PUT (if it existed). An error will occur if the resource is  successfully  written  but
                     the  kept  ACL  cannot  be  then  applied.  This  should  never happen.  <u>Note:</u>  <u>calc</u> is not
                     currently fully implemented.

              <b>-x-amz-meta-*</b>
                     If any header starts with "-x-amz-meta-", its contents are added to the PUT command  to  be
                     stored  as  metadata  with  the resource. Again, no encoding is performed, and the metadata
                     should not contain characters like newlines, carriage returns, and so on.  It  is  best  to
                     stick with simple ASCII strings, or to fix the library in several places.

              <b>-content-type</b>
                     This overrides the content-type calculated by <b>-file</b> or sets the content-type for <b>-content</b>.

              <b>-compare</b>
                     This  is  the standard compare mode argument. <b>S3::Put</b> returns 1 if the data was copied or 0
                     if the data was skipped due to the comparison mode so indicating it should be skipped.

       <b>S3::Get</b> ?<b>-bucket</b> <u>bucketname</u>? <b>-resource</b> <u>resourcename</u> ?<b>-blocking</b> <u>boolean</u>? ?<b>-compare</b> <u>comparemode</u>? ?<b>-file</b>
       <u>filename</u>? ?<b>-content</b> <u>contentvarname</u>? ?<b>-timestamp</b> <u>aws|now</u>? ?<b>-headers</b> <u>headervarname</u>?
              This command retrieves data from a resource on Amazon's S3 servers, using the HTTP GET command. It
              returns 0 if the <b>-compare</b> mode prevented the transfer, 1 if the  transfer  worked,  or  throws  an
              error  if  the  transfer  was attempted but failed. Server 5XX errors and S3 socket errors are are
              retried  according  to  <b>S3:Configure</b>  settings  before  throwing  an  error;  other  errors  throw
              immediately.  Note  that  this is always authenticated as the user configured in via <b>S3::Configure</b>
              <b>-accesskeyid</b>. Use the Tcllib http for unauthenticated GETs.

              <b>-bucket</b>
                     This specifies the bucket from which the resource will be read.   Leading  and/or  trailing
                     slashes are removed for you, as are spaces.

              <b>-resource</b>
                     This is the full name of the resource within the bucket. A single leading slash is removed,
                     but not a trailing slash.  Spaces are not trimmed.

              <b>-blocking</b>
                     The standard blocking flag.

              <b>-file</b>  If  this  is specified, the body of the resource will be read into this file, incrementally
                     without pulling it entirely into memory first. The parent directory must already exist.  If
                     the  file  already  exists, it must be writable. If an error is thrown part-way through the
                     process and the file already existed, it may be clobbered. If an error is  thrown  part-way
                     through  the  process and the file did not already exist, any partial bits will be deleted.
                     Specifying this is an error if <b>-content</b> is also specified, but at least  one  of  <b>-file</b>  or
                     <b>-content</b> must be specified.

              <b>-timestamp</b>
                     This  is  only  valid  in  conjunction  with  <b>-file</b>. It may be specified as <u>now</u> or <u>aws</u>. The
                     default is <u>now</u>. If <u>now</u>, the file's modification date is left up to the system. If <u>aws</u>,  the
                     file's  mtime  is  set to match the Last-Modified header on the resource, synchronizing the
                     two appropriately for <b>-compare</b> <u>date</u> or <b>-compare</b> <u>newer</u>.

              <b>-content</b>
                     If this is specified,  the  <u>contentvarname</u>  is  a  variable  in  the  caller's  scope  (not
                     necessarily  global)  that  receives  the value of the body of the resource. No encoding is
                     done, so if the resource (for example) represents a  UTF-8  byte  sequence,  use  [encoding
                     convertfrom  utf-8]  to  get  a  valid  UTF-8 string. If this is specified, the <b>-compare</b> is
                     ignored unless it is <u>never</u>, in which case no assignment  to  <u>contentvarname</u>  is  performed.
                     Specifying  this  is  an  error  if  <b>-file</b>  is also specified, but at least one of <b>-file</b> or
                     <b>-content</b> must be specified.

              <b>-compare</b>
                     This is the standard compare mode argument. <b>S3::Get</b> returns 1 if the data was copied  or  0
                     if the data was skipped due to the comparison mode so indicating it should be skipped.

              <b>-headers</b>
                     If  this  is  specified,  the  headers  resulting from the fetch are stored in the provided
                     variable, as a dictionary. This will include content-type and x-amz-meta-* headers, as well
                     as the usual HTTP headers, the x-amz-id debugging headers, and so on. If no file is fetched
                     (due to <b>-compare</b> or other errors), no assignment to this variable is performed.

       <b>S3::Head</b> ?<b>-bucket</b> <u>bucketname</u>? <b>-resource</b> <u>resourcename</u> ?<b>-blocking</b> <u>boolean</u>? ?<b>-dict</b> <u>dictvarname</u>? ?<b>-headers</b>
       <u>headersvarname</u>? ?<b>-status</b> <u>statusvarname</u>?
              This command requests HEAD from the resource.  It returns whether a 2XX code  was  returned  as  a
              result  of  the  request,  never  throwing  an  S3  remote error.  That is, if this returns 1, the
              resource exists and is accessible. If this returns 0, something went wrong, and the <b>-status</b> result
              can be consulted for details.

              <b>-bucket</b>
                     This specifies the bucket from which the resource will be read.   Leading  and/or  trailing
                     slashes are removed for you, as are spaces.

              <b>-resource</b>
                     This is the full name of the resource within the bucket. A single leading slash is removed,
                     but not a trailing slash.  Spaces are not trimmed.

              <b>-blocking</b>
                     The standard blocking flag.

              <b>-dict</b>  If  specified, the resulting dictionary from the <b>S3::REST</b> call is assigned to the indicated
                     (not necessarily global) variable in the caller's scope.

              <b>-headers</b>
                     If specified, the dictionary of headers from the result are assigned to the indicated  (not
                     necessarily global) variable in the caller's scope.

              <b>-status</b>
                     If  specified,  the  indicated  (not  necessarily global) variable in the caller's scope is
                     assigned a 2-element list. The first element is the 3-digit HTTP  status  code,  while  the
                     second element is the HTTP message (such as "OK" or "Forbidden").

       <b>S3::GetAcl</b> ?<b>-blocking</b> <u>boolean</u>? ?<b>-bucket</b> <u>bucketname</u>? <b>-resource</b> <u>resourcename</u> ?<b>-result-type</b> <u>REST|xml|pxml</u>?
              This command gets the ACL of the indicated resource or throws an error if it is unavailable.

              <b>-blocking</b> <u>boolean</u>
                     See above for standard definition.

              <b>-bucket</b>
                     This  specifies  the  bucket from which the resource will be read.  Leading and/or trailing
                     slashes are removed for you, as are spaces.

              <b>-resource</b>
                     This is the full name of the resource within the bucket. A single leading slash is removed,
                     but not a trailing slash.  Spaces are not trimmed.

              <b>-parse-xml</b> <u>xml</u>
                     The XML from a previous GetACL can be passed in to be parsed into dictionary form.  In this
                     case, -result-type must be pxml or dict.

              <b>-result-type</b> <u>REST</u>
                     The dictionary returned by <b>S3::REST</b> is the return value of <b>S3::GetAcl</b>.   In  this  case,  a
                     non-2XX httpstatus will not throw an error.

              <b>-result-type</b> <u>xml</u>
                     The raw XML of the body is returned as the result (with no encoding applied).

              <b>-result-type</b> <u>pxml</u>
                     The XML of the body as parsed by <b>xsxp::parse</b> is returned.

              <b>-result-type</b> <u>dict</u>
                     This fetches the ACL, parses it, and returns a dictionary of two elements.

                     The  first  element has the key "owner" whose value is the canonical ID of the owner of the
                     resource.

                     The second element has the key "acl"  whose  value  is  a  dictionary.   Each  key  in  the
                     dictionary is one of Amazon's permissions, namely "READ", "WRITE", "READ_ACP", "WRITE_ACP",
                     or  "FULL_CONTROL".   Each  value of each key is a list of canonical IDs or group URLs that
                     have that permission.  Elements are not in the list in any particular order,  and  not  all
                     keys  are  necessarily present.  Display names are not returned, as they are not especially
                     useful; use pxml to obtain them if necessary.

       <b>S3::PutAcl</b> ?<b>-blocking</b> <u>boolean</u>? ?<b>-bucket</b> <u>bucketname</u>? <b>-resource</b> <u>resourcename</u> ?<b>-acl</b> <u>new-acl</u>?
              This sets the ACL on the indicated resource. It returns the XML written to the ACL, or  throws  an
              error if anything went wrong.

              <b>-blocking</b> <u>boolean</u>
                     See above for standard definition.

              <b>-bucket</b>
                     This  specifies  the  bucket from which the resource will be read.  Leading and/or trailing
                     slashes are removed for you, as are spaces.

              <b>-resource</b>
                     This is the full name of the resource within the bucket. A single leading slash is removed,
                     but not a trailing slash.  Spaces are not trimmed.

              <b>-owner</b> If this is provided, it is assumed to match the owner of the resource.   Otherwise,  a  GET
                     may need to be issued against the resource to find the owner. If you already have the owner
                     (such  as from a call to <b>S3::GetAcl</b>, you can pass the value of the "owner" key as the value
                     of this option, and it will be used in the construction of the XML.

              <b>-acl</b>   If this option is specified, it provides  the  ACL  the  caller  wishes  to  write  to  the
                     resource.  If  this  is  not  supplied  or  is empty, the value is taken from <b>S3::Configure</b>
                     <b>-default-acl</b>.  The ACL is written with a PUT to the ?acl resource.

                     If the value passed to this option starts with "&lt;", it is taken to be a body to be  PUT  to
                     the ACL resource.

                     If  the  value  matches one of the standard Amazon x-amz-acl headers (i.e., a canned access
                     policy), that header is translated to XML and then applied. The canned access policies  are
                     private, public-read, public-read-write, and authenticated-read (in lower case).

                     Otherwise,  the value is assumed to be a dictionary formatted as the "acl" sub-entry within
                     the dict returns by <b>S3::GetAcl</b> <b>-result-type</b> <b>dict</b>.  The proper XML is generated and  applied
                     to  the  resource.   Note  that  a  value containing "//" is assumed to be a group, a value
                     containing "@" is assumed to be  an  AmazonCustomerByEmail,  and  otherwise  the  value  is
                     assumed to be a canonical Amazon ID.

                     Note  that  you  cannot change the owner, so calling GetAcl on a resource owned by one user
                     and applying it via PutAcl on a resource owned by another user may not do exactly what  you
                     expect.

       <b>S3::Delete</b> ?<b>-bucket</b> <u>bucketname</u>? <b>-resource</b> <u>resourcename</u> ?<b>-blocking</b> <u>boolean</u>? ?<b>-status</b> <u>statusvar</u>?
              This  command  deletes  the  specified  resource  from  the specified bucket.  It returns 1 if the
              resource was deleted successfully, 0 otherwise.  It returns 0 rather than throwing  an  S3  remote
              error.

              <b>-bucket</b>
                     This specifies the bucket from which the resource will be deleted.  Leading and/or trailing
                     slashes are removed for you, as are spaces.

              <b>-resource</b>
                     This is the full name of the resource within the bucket. A single leading slash is removed,
                     but not a trailing slash.  Spaces are not trimmed.

              <b>-blocking</b>
                     The standard blocking flag.

              <b>-status</b>
                     If  specified, the indicated (not necessarily global) variable in the caller's scope is set
                     to a two-element list. The first element is  the  3-digit  HTTP  status  code.  The  second
                     element is the HTTP message (such as "OK" or "Forbidden"). Note that Amazon's DELETE result
                     is 204 on success, that being the code indicating no content in the returned body.

       <b>S3::Push</b> ?<b>-bucket</b> <u>bucketname</u>? <b>-directory</b> <u>directoryname</u> ?<b>-prefix</b> <u>prefixstring</u>? ?<b>-compare</b> <u>comparemode</u>? ?<b>-x-</b>

              This synchronises a local directory with a remote bucket by pushing the differences using <b>S3::Put</b>.
              Note  that  if  something  has changed in the bucket but not locally, those changes could be lost.
              Thus, this is not a general two-way synchronization primitive. (See <b>S3::Sync</b> for that.)  Note  too
              that  resource  names  are case sensitive, so changing the case of a file on a Windows machine may
              lead to otherwise-unnecessary transfers.  Note that only regular files are considered, so devices,
              pipes, symlinks, and directories are not copied.

              <b>-bucket</b>
                     This names the bucket into which data will be pushed.

              <b>-directory</b>
                     This names the local directory from which files will be taken.  It must exist, be  readable
                     via  [glob]  and  so  on. If only some of the files therein are readable, <b>S3::Push</b> will PUT
                     those files that are readable and return in its results the list of files that could not be
                     opened.

              <b>-prefix</b>
                     This names the prefix that will be added to all resources.   That  is,  it  is  the  remote
                     equivalent  of  <b>-directory</b>.  If it is not specified, the root of the bucket will be treated
                     as the remote directory. An example may clarify.

                     S3::Push -bucket test -directory /tmp/xyz -prefix hello/world

                     In      this      example,      /tmp/xyz/pdq.html       will       be       stored       as
                     <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/test/hello/world/pdq.html">http://s3.amazonaws.com/test/hello/world/pdq.html</a>     in     Amazon's     servers.    Also,
                     /tmp/xyz/abc/def/Hello             will              be              stored              as
                     <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/test/hello/world/abc/def/Hello">http://s3.amazonaws.com/test/hello/world/abc/def/Hello</a>  in  Amazon's  servers.  Without the
                     <b>-prefix</b> option, /tmp/xyz/pdq.html would be stored as <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/test/pdq.html">http://s3.amazonaws.com/test/pdq.html</a>.

              <b>-blocking</b>
                     This is the standard blocking option.

              <b>-compare</b>
                     If present, this is  passed  to  each  invocation  of  <b>S3::Put</b>.   Naturally,  <b>S3::Configure</b>
                     <b>-default-compare</b> is used if this is not specified.

              <b>-x-amz-meta-*</b>
                     If  present,  this  is passed to each invocation of <b>S3::Put</b>. All copied files will have the
                     same metadata.

              <b>-acl</b>   If present, this is passed to each invocation of <b>S3::Put</b>.

              <b>-delete</b>
                     This defaults to false. If true, resources in the destination that are not  in  the  source
                     directory  are  deleted  with  <b>S3::Delete</b>.   Since  only  regular files are considered, the
                     existance of a symlink, pipe, device, or directory in the local source will <u>not</u> prevent the
                     deletion of a remote resource with a corresponding name.

              <b>-error</b> This controls the behavior of <b>S3::Push</b> in the event that <b>S3::Put</b> throws an error. Note that
                     errors encountered on the local file system or in reading the  list  of  resources  in  the
                     remote  bucket always throw errors.  This option allows control over "partial" errors, when
                     some files were copied and some were not. <b>S3::Delete</b> is always  finished  up,  with  errors
                     simply recorded in the return result.

                     throw  The error is rethrown with the same errorCode.

                     break  Processing  stops  without  throwing  an  error, the error is recorded in the return
                            value, and the command returns with a normal return.  The calls  to  <b>S3::Delete</b>  are
                            not started.

                     continue
                            This  is  the default. Processing continues without throwing, recording the error in
                            the return result, and resuming with the next file in  the  local  directory  to  be
                            copied.

              <b>-progress</b>
                     If  this  is  specified  and the indicated script prefix is not empty, the indicated script
                     prefix will be invoked several times in the caller's context with additional  arguments  at
                     various  points  in  the processing.  This allows progress reporting without backgrounding.
                     The provided prefix will be invoked with additional arguments, with  the  first  additional
                     argument indicating what part of the process is being reported on.  The prefix is initially
                     invoked  with  <u>args</u>  as  the  first  additional  argument and a dictionary representing the
                     normalized arguments to the <b>S3::Push</b> call as the  second  additional  argument.   Then  the
                     prefix is invoked with <u>local</u> as the first additional argument and a list of suffixes of the
                     files  to  be considered as the second argument.  Then the prefix is invoked with <u>remote</u> as
                     the first additional argument and a list of suffixes existing in the remote bucket  as  the
                     second  additional  argument.   Then,  for  each file in the local list, the prefix will be
                     invoked with <u>start</u> as the first additional argument and the common  suffix  as  the  second
                     additional  argument.   When <b>S3::Put</b> returns for that file, the prefix will be invoked with
                     <u>copy</u> as the first additional argument, the common suffix as the second additional argument,
                     and a third argument that will be "copied" (if <b>S3::Put</b> sent the  resource),  "skipped"  (if
                     <b>S3::Put</b>  decided  not  to  based  on  <b>-compare</b>), or the errorCode that <b>S3::Put</b> threw due to
                     unexpected errors (in which case the third argument is a list that starts with "S3").  When
                     all files have been transfered, the prefix may be invoked zero or more times with <u>delete</u> as
                     the  first  additional  argument and the suffix of the resource being deleted as the second
                     additional argument, with a third argument being either an  empty  string  (if  the  delete
                     worked)  or the errorCode from <b>S3::Delete</b> if it failed. Finally, the prefix will be invoked
                     with <u>finished</u> as the  first  additional  argument  and  the  return  value  as  the  second
                     additional argument.

              The  return result from this command is a dictionary. They keys are the suffixes (i.e., the common
              portion of the path after the <b>-directory</b> and <b>-prefix</b>),  while  the  values  are  either  "copied",
              "skipped"  (if  <b>-compare</b>  indicated  not to copy the file), or the errorCode thrown by <b>S3::Put</b>, as
              appropriate. If <b>-delete</b> was true, there may also be entries for suffixes with the value  "deleted"
              or "notdeleted", indicating whether the attempted <b>S3::Delete</b> worked or not, respectively. There is
              one  additional  pair  in  the  return  result, whose key is the empty string and whose value is a
              nested dictionary.  The keys of this nested dictionary include "filescopied" (the number of  files
              successfully  copied),  "bytescopied"  (the  number  of  data bytes in the files copied, excluding
              headers, metadata, etc), "compareskipped" (the number of files not copied due to  <b>-compare</b>  mode),
              "errorskipped"  (the  number of files not copied due to thrown errors), "filesdeleted" (the number
              of resources deleted due to not having corresponding files locally, or 0 if <b>-delete</b> is false), and
              "filesnotdeleted" (the number of resources whose deletion was attempted but failed).

              Note that this is currently implemented somewhat inefficiently.  It  fetches  the  bucket  listing
              (including  timestamps  and eTags), then calls <b>S3::Put</b>, which uses HEAD to find the timestamps and
              eTags again. Correcting this with no API change is planned for a future upgrade.

              This synchronises a remote bucket with a local directory by pulling the differences using  <b>S3::Get</b>
              If something has been changed locally but not in the bucket, those difference may be lost. This is
              not  a  general  two-way  synchronization  mechanism.  (See  <b>S3::Sync</b>  for  that.)   This  creates
              directories if needed; new directories are created with default permissions.  Note  that  resource
              names  are  case  sensitive,  so  changing  the  case  of  a file on a Windows machine may lead to
              otherwise-unnecessary transfers. Also, try not to store data in resources that end with  a  slash,
              or  which  are prefixes of resources that otherwise would start with a slash; i.e., don't use this
              if you store data in resources whose names have to be directories locally.

              Note that this is currently implemented somewhat inefficiently.  It  fetches  the  bucket  listing
              (including  timestamps  and eTags), then calls <b>S3::Get</b>, which uses HEAD to find the timestamps and
              eTags again. Correcting this with no API change is planned for a future upgrade.

              <b>-bucket</b>
                     This names the bucket from which data will be pulled.

              <b>-directory</b>
                     This names the local directory into which files will be written It must exist, be  readable
                     via  [glob],  writable  for file creation, and so on. If only some of the files therein are
                     writable, <b>S3::Pull</b> will GET those files that are writable and return  in  its  results  the
                     list of files that could not be opened.

              <b>-prefix</b>
                     The  prefix  of  resources  that  will  be considered for retrieval.  See <b>S3::Push</b> for more
                     details, examples, etc. (Of course, <b>S3::Pull</b> reads rather than writes, but  the  prefix  is
                     treated similarly.)

              <b>-blocking</b>
                     This is the standard blocking option.

              <b>-compare</b>
                     This  is  passed  to  each  invocation  of  <b>S3::Get</b>  if provided.  Naturally, <b>S3::Configure</b>
                     <b>-default-compare</b> is used if this is not provided.

              <b>-timestamp</b>
                     This is passed to each invocation of <b>S3::Get</b> if provided.

              <b>-delete</b>
                     If this is specified and true, files that exist in the  <b>-directory</b>  that  are  not  in  the
                     <b>-prefix</b>  will  be  deleted  after  all  resources  have  been  copied.  In  addition, empty
                     directories (other than the top-level <b>-directory</b>) will be deleted,  as  Amazon  S3  has  no
                     concept of an empty directory.

              <b>-error</b> See <b>S3::Push</b> for a description of this option.

              <b>-progress</b>
                     See  <b>S3::Push</b>  for  a  description  of  this  option.   It  differs  slightly in that local
                     directories may be included with a trailing slash to indicate they are directories.

              The return value from this command is a dictionary. It is identical in form  and  meaning  to  the
              description of the return result of <b>S3::Push</b>. It differs only in that directories may be included,
              with a trailing slash in their name, if they are empty and get deleted.

       <b>S3::Toss</b> ?<b>-bucket</b> <u>bucketname</u>? <b>-prefix</b> <u>prefixstring</u> ?<b>-blocking</b> <u>boolean</u>? ?<b>-error</b> <u>throw|break|continue</u>?
       ?<b>-progress</b> <u>scriptprefix</u>?
              This  deletes  some  or all resources within a bucket. It would be considered a "recursive delete"
              had Amazon implemented actual directories.

              <b>-bucket</b>
                     The bucket from which resources will be deleted.

              <b>-blocking</b>
                     The standard blocking option.

              <b>-prefix</b>
                     The prefix for resources to be deleted. Any resource that starts with this string  will  be
                     deleted.  This  is  required.  To delete everything in the bucket, pass an empty string for
                     the prefix.

              <b>-error</b> If this is "throw", <b>S3::Toss</b> rethrows any  errors  it  encounters.   If  this  is  "break",
                     <b>S3::Toss</b>  returns  with  a normal return after the first error, recording that error in the
                     return result. If this is "continue", which is the default, <b>S3::Toss</b> continues on and lists
                     all errors in the return result.

              <b>-progress</b>
                     If this is specified and not an empty string, the script prefix  will  be  invoked  several
                     times  in the context of the caller with additional arguments appended.  Initially, it will
                     be invoked with the first additional argument being <u>args</u> and the second being the processed
                     list of arguments to <b>S3::Toss</b>. Then it is invoked  with  <u>remote</u>  as  the  first  additional
                     argument  and  the  list  of  suffixes in the bucket to be deleted as the second additional
                     argument. Then it is invoked with the first additional argument being <u>delete</u> and the second
                     additional argument being the suffix  deleted  and  the  third  additional  argument  being
                     "deleted"  or  "notdeleted"  depending  on whether <b>S3::Delete</b> threw an error.  Finally, the
                     script prefix is invoked with a first  additional  argument  of  "finished"  and  a  second
                     additional argument of the return value.

              The  return  value  is a dictionary. The keys are the suffixes of files that <b>S3::Toss</b> attempted to
              delete, and whose values are either the string  "deleted"  or  "notdeleted".  There  is  also  one
              additional pair, whose key is the empty string and whose value is an embedded dictionary. The keys
              of  this  embedded  dictionary  include  "filesdeleted"  and  "filesnotdeleted", each of which has
              integer values.

</pre><h4><b>LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       â€¢      The pure-Tcl MD5 checking is slow. If you are processing files in  the  megabyte  range,  consider
              ensuring binary support is available.

       â€¢      The  commands  <b>S3::Pull</b>  and  <b>S3::Push</b> fetch a directory listing which includes timestamps and MD5
              hashes, then invoke <b>S3::Get</b> and <b>S3::Put</b>. If a complex <b>-compare</b>  mode  is  specified,  <b>S3::Get</b>  and
              <b>S3::Put</b>  will  invoke  a  HEAD  operation for each file to fetch timestamps and MD5 hashes of each
              resource again. It is expected that a future release of this package will solve this  without  any
              API changes.

       â€¢      The  commands <b>S3::Pull</b> and <b>S3::Push</b> fetch a directory listing without using <b>-max-count</b>. The entire
              directory is pulled into memory at once. For very large  buckets,  this  could  be  a  performance
              problem. The author, at this time, does not plan to change this behavior. Welcome to Open Source.

       â€¢      <b>S3::Sync</b>  is  neither  designed  nor  implemented  yet.   The  intention  would be to keep changes
              synchronised, so changes could be made to both the bucket and the local directory and be merged by
              <b>S3::Sync</b>.

       â€¢      Nor is <b>-compare</b> <u>calc</u> fully  implemented.  This  is  primarily  due  to  Windows  not  providing  a
              convenient  method  for distinguishing between local files that are "public-read" or "public-read-
              write". Assistance figuring out TWAPI for this  would  be  appreciated.  The  U**X  semantics  are
              difficult  to map directly as well. See the source for details.  Note that there are not tests for
              calc, since it isn't done yet.

       â€¢      The HTTP processing is implemented within the library, rather than using a  "real"  HTTP  package.
              Hence,  multi-line  headers  are  not  (yet) handled correctly. Do not include carriage returns or
              linefeeds in x-amz-meta-* headers, content-type values, and so on.  The author does  not  at  this
              time expect to improve this.

       â€¢      Internally, <b>S3::Push</b> and <b>S3::Pull</b> and <b>S3::Toss</b> are all very similar and should be refactored.

       â€¢      The  idea  of  using  <b>-compare</b>  <u>never</u> <b>-delete</b> <u>true</u> to delete files that have been deleted from one
              place but not the other yet not copying changed files is untested.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b> <b>SUGGESTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       To fetch a "directory" out of a bucket, make changes, and store it back:

              file mkdir ./tempfiles
              S3::Pull -bucket sample -prefix of/interest -directory ./tempfiles \
                -timestamp aws
              do_my_process ./tempfiles other arguments
              S3::Push -bucket sample -prefix of/interest -directory ./tempfiles \
                -compare newer -delete true

       To delete files locally that were deleted off of S3 but not otherwise update files:

              S3::Pull -bucket sample -prefix of/interest -directory ./myfiles \
                -compare never -delete true

</pre><h4><b>FUTURE</b> <b>DEVELOPMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       The author intends to work on several additional  projects  related  to  this  package,  in  addition  to
       finishing the unfinished features.

       First,  a  command-line program allowing browsing of buckets and transfer of files from shell scripts and
       command prompts is useful.

       Second, a GUI-based program allowing visual manipulation of bucket and resource trees not unlike  Windows
       Explorer would be useful.

       Third,  a  command-line (and perhaps a GUI-based) program called "OddJob" that will use S3 to synchronize
       computation amongst multiple servers running OddJob. An S3 bucket will be set up with a number of scripts
       to run, and the OddJob program can be invoked on multiple machines to run scripts on  all  the  machines,
       each  moving  on to the next unstarted task as it finishes each.  This is still being designed, and it is
       intended primarily to be run on Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud.

</pre><h4><b>TLS</b> <b>SECURITY</b> <b>CONSIDERATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       This package uses the <b>TLS</b> package to handle the security for <b>https</b> urls and other socket connections.

       Policy decisions like the set of protocols to support and what ciphers to use are not the  responsibility
       of  <b>TLS</b>,  nor  of  this  package  itself  however.   Such  decisions  are the responsibility of whichever
       application is using the package, and are likely influenced by the set of servers  the  application  will
       talk to as well.

       For        example,        in        light        of        the        recent        <u>POODLE</u>        <u>attack</u>
       [<a href="http://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.co.uk/2014/10/this-poodle-bites-exploiting-ssl-30.html">http://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.co.uk/2014/10/this-poodle-bites-exploiting-ssl-30.html</a>]  discovered
       by  Google  many  servers  will  disable  support  for  the  SSLv3  protocol.   To handle this change the
       applications using <b>TLS</b> must be patched, and not this package, nor <b>TLS</b> itself.  Such a  patch  may  be  as
       simple as generally activating <b>tls1</b> support, as shown in the example below.

                  package require tls
                  tls::init -tls1 1 ;# forcibly activate support for the TLS1 protocol

                  ... your own application code ...
