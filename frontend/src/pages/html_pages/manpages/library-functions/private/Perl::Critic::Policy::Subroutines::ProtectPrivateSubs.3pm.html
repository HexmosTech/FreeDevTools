</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Perl::Critic::Policy::Subroutines::ProtectPrivateSubs - Prevent access to private subs in other packages.

</pre><h4><b>AFFILIATION</b></h4><pre>
       This Policy is part of the core Perl::Critic distribution.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       By convention Perl authors (like authors in many other languages) indicate private methods and variables
       by inserting a leading underscore before the identifier.  This policy catches attempts to access private
       variables from outside the package itself.

       The subroutines in the POSIX package which begin with an underscore (e.g. "POSIX::_POSIX_ARG_MAX") are
       not flagged as errors by this policy.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       You can define what a private subroutine name looks like by specifying a regular expression for the
       "private_name_regex" option in your <u>.perlcriticrc</u>:

           [Subroutines::ProtectPrivateSubs]
           private_name_regex = _(?!_)\w+

       The above example is a way of saying that subroutines that start with a double underscore are not
       considered to be private.  (Perl::Critic, in its implementation, uses leading double underscores to
       indicate a distribution-private subroutine-- one that is allowed to be invoked by other Perl::Critic
       modules, but not by anything outside of Perl::Critic.)

       You can configure additional subroutines to accept by specifying them in a space-delimited list to the
       "allow" option:

           [Subroutines::ProtectPrivateSubs]
           allow = FOO::_bar FOO::_baz

       These are added to the default list of exemptions from this policy.  Allowing a subroutine also allows
       the corresponding method call. So "FOO::_bar" in the above example allows both FOO::_bar() and
       "FOO-&gt;_bar()".

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       This policy is inspired by a similar test in B::Lint.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Doesn't forbid "$pkg-&gt;_foo()" because it can't tell the difference between that and "$self-&gt;_foo()".
