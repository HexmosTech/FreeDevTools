</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Xray::Absorption::CL - Perl interface to the Cromer-Liberman tables

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
          use Xray::Absorption;
          Xray::Absorption -&gt; load("cl");

       See the documentation for Xray::Absorption for details.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module is inherited by the Xray::Absorption module and provides access to the data contained in the
       Cromer-Liberman tables of anomalous scattering factors and line and edge energies.

       The data in this module and the Fortran code which it calls as a shared library, referred to as "The CL
       Tables", was published as

         S. Brennan and P.L. Cowen, Rev. Sci. Instrum, vol 63,
         p.850 (1992)

       More information about these data is available on the Web at

          <a href="http://www.slac.ssrl.stanford.edu/absorb.html">http://www.slac.ssrl.stanford.edu/absorb.html</a>.

       The values for the anomalous scattering factors are calculated by calls to the Ifeffit library by Matt
       Newville.

       The values of edge and line energies are contained in a database file called <u>cl.db</u> which is generated at
       install time from the flat text files of the these data.  The data is stored in a Storable archive using
       "network" ordering.  This allows speedy disk and memory access along with network and platform
       portability.

       The required "File::Spec", "Chemistry::Elements", "Storable" are available from CPAN.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       The behaviour of the methods in this module is a bit different from other modules used by
       "Xray::Absorption".  This section describes methods which behave differently for this data resource.

       "get_energy"
           Example:

              $energy = Xray::Absorption -&gt; get_energy($elem, $edge);

           This  behaves  similarly  to  the "get_energy" method of the other resources.  When using the CL data
           resource, $edge can be any of K, L1-L3, M1-M5,  N1-N7,  O1-O7,  or  P1-P3.   Line  energies  are  not
           supplied with the CL data set.  The line energies from the McMaster tables are used.

       "cross_section"
           Example:

              $xsec = Xray::Absorption -&gt; cross_section($elem, $energy, $mode);

              @xsec = Xray::Absorption -&gt; cross_section($elem, \@energy, $mode);

           For this data resource, one call in list context is considerably faster than repeated calls in scalar
           context.   It is well worth the trouble of organizing your code to make a single call in list context
           and store the results for later use.

           This behaves slightly differently from the similar method for the McMaster and Elam  resources.   The
           CL  tables  are  actually  tables  of  anomalous scattering factors and do not come with coherent and
           incoherent scattering cross-sections.   The  photo-electric  cross-section  is  calculated  from  the
           imaginary part of the anomalous scattering by the formula

                mu = 2 * r_e * lambda * conv * f_2

           where,  "r_e"  is the classical electron radius, lamdba is the photon wavelength, and conv is a units
           conversion factor.

                r_e    = 2.817938 x 10^-15 m
                lambda = 2 pi hbar c / energy
                hbar*c = 1973.27053324 eV*Angstrom
                conv   = Avagadro / atomic weight
                       = 6.022045e7 / weight in cgs

           The $mode argument is different here than for the other resources.  The options are "xsec", "f1", and
           "f2", telling this method to return the cross-section or the real or imaginary  anomalous  scattering
           factor, respectively.

           The  values for f1 and f2 are computed by linear interpolation of a semi-log scale.  Care is taken to
           avoid the discontinuities at the edges.

           Because the CL tables do not include the coherent and incoherent scattering terms, the value returned
           by "get_energy" is a bit smaller using the CL tables than using the others.

</pre><h4><b>EDGE</b> <b>AND</b> <b>LINE</b> <b>ENERGIES</b></h4><pre>
       The CL data resource provides a fairly complete set of edge energies.  Any edge  tabulated  on  the  Gwyn
       William's  Table  of  Electron Binding Energies for the Elements (that's the one published by NSLS and on
       the door of just about every hutch at NSLS) is in the CL data resource.  The CL data comes with the same,
       limited set of fluorescence energies as McMaster.
