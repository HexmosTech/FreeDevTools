       PCRE - Perl-compatible regular expressions

</pre><h4><b>UTF-8,</b> <b>UTF-16,</b> <b>UTF-32,</b> <b>AND</b> <b>UNICODE</b> <b>PROPERTY</b> <b>SUPPORT</b></h4><pre>

       As  well  as UTF-8 support, PCRE also supports UTF-16 (from release 8.30) and UTF-32 (from release 8.32),
       by means of two additional libraries. They can be built as well as, or instead of, the 8-bit library.

</pre><h4><b>UTF-8</b> <b>SUPPORT</b></h4><pre>

       In order process UTF-8 strings, you must build PCRE's 8-bit library with UTF support, and,  in  addition,
       you  must call <b>pcre_compile()</b> with the PCRE_UTF8 option flag, or the pattern must start with the sequence
       (*UTF8) or (*UTF). When either of these is the case, both the pattern and any subject  strings  that  are
       matched against it are treated as UTF-8 strings instead of strings of individual 1-byte characters.

</pre><h4><b>UTF-16</b> <b>AND</b> <b>UTF-32</b> <b>SUPPORT</b></h4><pre>

       In  order  process  UTF-16  or  UTF-32  strings,  you must build PCRE's 16-bit or 32-bit library with UTF
       support, and, in addition, you must call <b>pcre16_compile()</b> or  <b>pcre32_compile()</b>  with  the  PCRE_UTF16  or
       PCRE_UTF32 option flag, as appropriate. Alternatively, the pattern must start with the sequence (*UTF16),
       (*UTF32),  as  appropriate,  or (*UTF), which can be used with either library. When UTF mode is set, both
       the pattern and any subject strings that are matched against it are treated as UTF-16 or  UTF-32  strings
       instead of strings of individual 16-bit or 32-bit characters.

</pre><h4><b>UTF</b> <b>SUPPORT</b> <b>OVERHEAD</b></h4><pre>

       If  you  compile  PCRE with UTF support, but do not use it at run time, the library will be a bit bigger,
       but the additional run time overhead is limited to testing the PCRE_UTF[8|16|32]  flag  occasionally,  so
       should not be very big.

</pre><h4><b>UNICODE</b> <b>PROPERTY</b> <b>SUPPORT</b></h4><pre>

       If  PCRE  is  built  with  Unicode  character  property  support  (which implies UTF support), the escape
       sequences \p{..}, \P{..}, and \X can be used.  The available properties that can be tested are limited to
       the general category properties such as Lu for an upper case letter or  Nd  for  a  decimal  number,  the
       Unicode script names such as Arabic or Han, and the derived properties Any and L&amp;. Full lists is given in
       the  <b>pcrepattern</b>  and  <b>pcresyntax</b>  documentation.  Only the short names for properties are supported. For
       example, \p{L} matches a letter. Its Perl synonym, \p{Letter}, is not supported.  Furthermore,  in  Perl,
       many  properties  may  optionally  be  prefixed  by  "Is", for compatibility with Perl 5.6. PCRE does not
       support this.

   <b>Validity</b> <b>of</b> <b>UTF-8</b> <b>strings</b>

       When you set the PCRE_UTF8 flag, the byte strings passed  as  patterns  and  subjects  are  (by  default)
       checked  for  validity  on entry to the relevant functions. The entire string is checked before any other
       processing takes place. From release 7.3 of PCRE, the check is according the rules of RFC 3629, which are
       themselves derived from the Unicode specification. Earlier releases of PCRE followed  the  rules  of  RFC
       2279,  which  allows  the  full  range  of 31-bit values (0 to 0x7FFFFFFF). The current check allows only
       values in the range U+0 to U+10FFFF, excluding the surrogate area. (From release 8.33 the so-called "non-
       character" code points are no longer excluded because Unicode corrigendum #9 makes  it  clear  that  they
       should not be.)

       Characters  in  the  "Surrogate  Area"  of Unicode are reserved for use by UTF-16, where they are used in
       pairs to encode codepoints with values greater than 0xFFFF. The code points that are  encoded  by  UTF-16
       pairs are available independently in the UTF-8 and UTF-32 encodings. (In other words, the whole surrogate
       thing is a fudge for UTF-16 which unfortunately messes up UTF-8 and UTF-32.)

       If  an  invalid  UTF-8  string  is  passed  to  PCRE, an error return is given. At compile time, the only
       additional information is the offset to the first byte of the failing character. The  run-time  functions
       <b>pcre_exec()</b>  and  <b>pcre_dfa_exec()</b> also pass back this information, as well as a more detailed reason code
       if the caller has provided memory in which to do this.

       In some situations, you may already know that your strings are valid, and therefore want  to  skip  these
       checks  in  order  to improve performance, for example in the case of a long subject string that is being
       scanned repeatedly.  If you set the PCRE_NO_UTF8_CHECK flag at compile time or at run time, PCRE  assumes
       that  the pattern or subject it is given (respectively) contains only valid UTF-8 codes. In this case, it
       does not diagnose an invalid UTF-8 string.

       Note that passing PCRE_NO_UTF8_CHECK to <b>pcre_compile()</b> just disables the check for the pattern;  it  does
       not  also  apply  to subject strings. If you want to disable the check for a subject string you must pass
       this option to <b>pcre_exec()</b> or <b>pcre_dfa_exec()</b>.

       If you pass an invalid UTF-8 string when PCRE_NO_UTF8_CHECK is set, the  result  is  undefined  and  your
       program may crash.

   <b>Validity</b> <b>of</b> <b>UTF-16</b> <b>strings</b>

       When  you  set  the  PCRE_UTF16  flag,  the  strings of 16-bit data units that are passed as patterns and
       subjects are (by default) checked for validity on entry to the  relevant  functions.  Values  other  than
       those  in the surrogate range U+D800 to U+DFFF are independent code points. Values in the surrogate range
       must be used in pairs in the correct manner.

       If an invalid UTF-16 string is passed to PCRE, an error return  is  given.  At  compile  time,  the  only
       additional  information  is  the  offset  to  the  first data unit of the failing character. The run-time
       functions <b>pcre16_exec()</b> and <b>pcre16_dfa_exec()</b> also pass back this information, as well as a more detailed
       reason code if the caller has provided memory in which to do this.

       In some situations, you may already know that your strings are valid, and therefore want  to  skip  these
       checks in order to improve performance. If you set the PCRE_NO_UTF16_CHECK flag at compile time or at run
       time,  PCRE  assumes  that  the  pattern or subject it is given (respectively) contains only valid UTF-16
       sequences. In this case, it does not diagnose an invalid UTF-16 string.  However, if an invalid string is
       passed, the result is undefined.

   <b>Validity</b> <b>of</b> <b>UTF-32</b> <b>strings</b>

       When you set the PCRE_UTF32 flag, the strings of 32-bit data  units  that  are  passed  as  patterns  and
       subjects  are  (by  default)  checked for validity on entry to the relevant functions.  This check allows
       only values in the range U+0 to U+10FFFF, excluding the surrogate area U+D800 to U+DFFF.

       If an invalid UTF-32 string is passed to PCRE, an error return  is  given.  At  compile  time,  the  only
       additional  information  is  the  offset  to  the  first data unit of the failing character. The run-time
       functions <b>pcre32_exec()</b> and <b>pcre32_dfa_exec()</b> also pass back this information, as well as a more detailed
       reason code if the caller has provided memory in which to do this.

       In some situations, you may already know that your strings are valid, and therefore want  to  skip  these
       checks in order to improve performance. If you set the PCRE_NO_UTF32_CHECK flag at compile time or at run
       time,  PCRE  assumes  that  the  pattern or subject it is given (respectively) contains only valid UTF-32
       sequences. In this case, it does not diagnose an invalid UTF-32 string.  However, if an invalid string is
       passed, the result is undefined.

   <b>General</b> <b>comments</b> <b>about</b> <b>UTF</b> <b>modes</b>

       1. Codepoints less than 256 can be specified in patterns by either braced or unbraced hexadecimal  escape
       sequences (for example, \x{b3} or \xb3). Larger values have to use braced sequences.

       2.  Octal  numbers up to \777 are recognized, and in UTF-8 mode they match two-byte characters for values
       greater than \177.

       3. Repeat quantifiers apply to complete UTF characters,  not  to  individual  data  units,  for  example:
       \x{100}{3}.

       4. The dot metacharacter matches one UTF character instead of a single data unit.

       5.  The escape sequence \C can be used to match a single byte in UTF-8 mode, or a single 16-bit data unit
       in UTF-16 mode, or a single 32-bit data unit in UTF-32 mode, but its use can lead to some strange effects
       because it breaks up multi-unit characters (see the description of \C in the <b>pcrepattern</b>  documentation).
       The  use  of  \C  is not supported in the alternative matching function <b>pcre[16|32]_dfa_exec()</b>, nor is it
       supported in UTF mode by the JIT optimization of <b>pcre[16|32]_exec()</b>. If JIT optimization is requested for
       a UTF pattern that contains \C, it will not succeed, and so the matching  will  be  carried  out  by  the
       normal interpretive function.

       6.  The character escapes \b, \B, \d, \D, \s, \S, \w, and \W correctly test characters of any code value,
       but, by default, the characters that PCRE recognizes as digits, spaces, or  word  characters  remain  the
       same  set as in non-UTF mode, all with values less than 256. This remains true even when PCRE is built to
       include Unicode property support, because to do otherwise would slow down PCRE in many common cases. Note
       in particular that this applies to \b and \B, because they are defined in terms of  \w  and  \W.  If  you
       really  want to test for a wider sense of, say, "digit", you can use explicit Unicode property tests such
       as \p{Nd}. Alternatively, if you set the PCRE_UCP option, the way that  the  character  escapes  work  is
       changed  so  that Unicode properties are used to determine which characters match. There are more details
       in the section on generic character types in the <b>pcrepattern</b> documentation.

       7. Similarly, characters that match the POSIX named character  classes  are  all  low-valued  characters,
       unless the PCRE_UCP option is set.

       8.  However,  the  horizontal and vertical white space matching escapes (\h, \H, \v, and \V) do match all
       the appropriate Unicode characters, whether or not PCRE_UCP is set.

       9. Case-insensitive matching applies only to characters whose values are less than 128,  unless  PCRE  is
       built  with  Unicode  property  support.  A few Unicode characters such as Greek sigma have more than two
       codepoints that are case-equivalent. Up to and including PCRE release 8.31, only one-to-one case mappings
       were supported, but later releases (with Unicode  property  support)  do  treat  as  case-equivalent  all
       versions of characters such as Greek sigma.
