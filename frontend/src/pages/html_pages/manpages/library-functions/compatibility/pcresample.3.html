</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       PCRE - Perl-compatible regular expressions

</pre><h4><b>PCRE</b> <b>SAMPLE</b> <b>PROGRAM</b></h4><pre>

       A  simple,  complete  demonstration  program, to get you started with using PCRE, is supplied in the file
       <u>pcredemo.c</u> in the PCRE distribution. A listing of this program is given in the <b>pcredemo</b> documentation. If
       you do not have a copy of the PCRE distribution, you can save this listing to re-create <u>pcredemo.c</u>.

       The demonstration program, which uses the original PCRE 8-bit library, compiles  the  regular  expression
       that  is  its  first  argument, and matches it against the subject string in its second argument. No PCRE
       options are set, and default character tables are used. If matching succeeds,  the  program  outputs  the
       portion of the subject that matched, together with the contents of any captured substrings.

       If  the  -g option is given on the command line, the program then goes on to check for further matches of
       the same regular expression in the same subject string. The logic is a little bit tricky because  of  the
       possibility of matching an empty string. Comments in the code explain what is going on.

       If  PCRE  is  installed  in  the  standard include and library directories for your operating system, you
       should be able to compile the demonstration program using this command:

         gcc -o pcredemo pcredemo.c -lpcre

       If PCRE is installed elsewhere, you may need to add additional options to the command line. For  example,
       on  a  Unix-like  system that has PCRE installed in <u><a href="file:/usr/local">/usr/local</a></u>, you can compile the demonstration program
       using a command like this:

         gcc -o pcredemo -I/usr/local/include pcredemo.c \
             -L/usr/local/lib -lpcre

       In a Windows environment, if you want to statically link the program against a non-dll <b>pcre.a</b>  file,  you
       must  uncomment  the  line  that  defines  PCRE_STATIC  before  including  <b>pcre.h</b>,  because otherwise the
       <b>pcre_malloc()</b> and <b>pcre_free()</b> exported functions will be declared  <b>__declspec(dllimport)</b>,  with  unwanted
       results.

       Once you have compiled and linked the demonstration program, you can run simple tests like this:

         ./pcredemo 'cat|dog' 'the cat sat on the mat'
         ./pcredemo -g 'cat|dog' 'the dog sat on the cat'

       Note  that  there  is  a  much more comprehensive test program, called <b>pcretest</b>, which supports many more
       facilities for testing regular expressions and both PCRE libraries. The <b>pcredemo</b> program is provided as a
       simple coding example.

       If you try to run <b>pcredemo</b> when PCRE is not installed in the standard library directory, you may  get  an
       error like this on some operating systems (e.g. Solaris):

         ld.so.1: a.out: fatal: libpcre.so.0: open failed: No such file or directory

       This is caused by the way shared library support works on those systems. You need to add

         -R/usr/local/lib

       (for example) to the compile command to get round this problem.
