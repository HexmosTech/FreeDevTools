</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       PCRE - Perl-compatible regular expressions

</pre><h4><b>BUILDING</b> <b>PCRE</b></h4><pre>

       PCRE  is  distributed  with  a  <b>configure</b>  script  that  can  be  used  to build the library in Unix-like
       environments using the applications known as Autotools.  Also in the distribution are  files  to  support
       building  using  <b>CMake</b>  instead  of  <b>configure</b>.  The  text file <b>README</b> contains general information about
       building with Autotools (some of which is repeated below), and also has some comments about  building  on
       various  operating  systems.  There is a lot more information about building PCRE without using Autotools
       (including information about using <b>CMake</b> and building "by hand") in the text file  called  <b>NON-AUTOTOOLS-</b>
       <b>BUILD</b>.   You  should  consult this file as well as the <b>README</b> file if you are building in a non-Unix-like
       environment.

</pre><h4><b>PCRE</b> <b>BUILD-TIME</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>

       The rest of this document describes the optional features of PCRE that can be selected when  the  library
       is  compiled.  It  assumes  use  of  the  <b>configure</b>  script,  where the optional features are selected or
       deselected by providing options to <b>configure</b> before running the <b>make</b> command. However, the  same  options
       can  be  selected in both Unix-like and non-Unix-like environments using the GUI facility of <b>cmake-gui</b> if
       you are using <b>CMake</b> instead of <b>configure</b> to build PCRE.

       If you are not using Autotools or <b>CMake</b>, option selection can be done by editing the <b>config.h</b> file, or by
       passing parameter settings to the compiler, as described in <b>NON-AUTOTOOLS-BUILD</b>.

       The complete list of options for <b>configure</b> (which includes the standard ones such as the selection of the
       installation directory) can be obtained by running

         ./configure --help

       The following sections include descriptions of options whose names  begin  with  --enable  or  --disable.
       These  settings  specify  changes  to  the  defaults  for  the <b>configure</b> command. Because of the way that
       <b>configure</b> works, --enable and --disable always come in pairs, so the complementary option  always  exists
       as well, but as it specifies the default, it is not described.

</pre><h4><b>BUILDING</b> <b>8-BIT,</b> <b>16-BIT</b> <b>AND</b> <b>32-BIT</b> <b>LIBRARIES</b></h4><pre>

       By  default, a library called <b>libpcre</b> is built, containing functions that take string arguments contained
       in vectors of bytes, either as single-byte characters, or interpreted as  UTF-8  strings.  You  can  also
       build  a  separate  library,  called  <b>libpcre16</b>, in which strings are contained in vectors of 16-bit data
       units and interpreted either as single-unit characters or UTF-16 strings, by adding

         --enable-pcre16

       to the <b>configure</b> command. You can also build yet another separate library,  called  <b>libpcre32</b>,  in  which
       strings are contained in vectors of 32-bit data units and interpreted either as single-unit characters or
       UTF-32 strings, by adding

         --enable-pcre32

       to the <b>configure</b> command. If you do not want the 8-bit library, add

         --disable-pcre8

       as  well. At least one of the three libraries must be built. Note that the C++ and POSIX wrappers are for
       the 8-bit library only, and that <b>pcregrep</b> is an 8-bit program. None of these are built if you select only
       the 16-bit or 32-bit libraries.

</pre><h4><b>BUILDING</b> <b>SHARED</b> <b>AND</b> <b>STATIC</b> <b>LIBRARIES</b></h4><pre>

       The Autotools PCRE building process uses <b>libtool</b> to build both shared and static  libraries  by  default.
       You can suppress one of these by adding one of

         --disable-shared
         --disable-static

       to the <b>configure</b> command, as required.

</pre><h4><b>C++</b> <b>SUPPORT</b></h4><pre>

       By  default, if the 8-bit library is being built, the <b>configure</b> script will search for a C++ compiler and
       C++ header files. If it finds them, it automatically builds the C++ wrapper library (which supports  only
       8-bit strings). You can disable this by adding

         --disable-cpp

       to the <b>configure</b> command.

</pre><h4><b>UTF-8,</b> <b>UTF-16</b> <b>AND</b> <b>UTF-32</b> <b>SUPPORT</b></h4><pre>

       To build PCRE with support for UTF Unicode character strings, add

         --enable-utf

       to  the  <b>configure</b>  command. This setting applies to all three libraries, adding support for UTF-8 to the
       8-bit library, support for UTF-16 to the 16-bit library, and support for UTF-32  to  the  to  the  32-bit
       library.  There  are no separate options for enabling UTF-8, UTF-16 and UTF-32 independently because that
       would allow ridiculous settings such as requesting UTF-16 support while building only the 8-bit  library.
       It  is  not possible to build one library with UTF support and another without in the same configuration.
       (For backwards compatibility, --enable-utf8 is a synonym of --enable-utf.)

       Of itself, this setting does not make PCRE treat strings as UTF-8, UTF-16 or UTF-32. As well as compiling
       PCRE with this option, you also have have to set the  PCRE_UTF8,  PCRE_UTF16  or  PCRE_UTF32  option  (as
       appropriate) when you call one of the pattern compiling functions.

       If  you  set  --enable-utf  when  compiling in an EBCDIC environment, PCRE expects its input to be either
       ASCII or UTF-8 (depending on the run-time option). It is not possible to support both  EBCDIC  and  UTF-8
       codes  in  the  same  version of the library. Consequently, --enable-utf and --enable-ebcdic are mutually
       exclusive.

</pre><h4><b>UNICODE</b> <b>CHARACTER</b> <b>PROPERTY</b> <b>SUPPORT</b></h4><pre>

       UTF support allows the libraries to process character codepoints up to 0x10ffff in the strings that  they
       handle.  On  its  own,  however,  it does not provide any facilities for accessing the properties of such
       characters. If you want to be able to use the pattern escapes \P, \p, and  \X,  which  refer  to  Unicode
       character properties, you must add

         --enable-unicode-properties

       to the <b>configure</b> command. This implies UTF support, even if you have not explicitly requested it.

       Including  Unicode  property  support  adds  around  30K  of tables to the PCRE library. Only the general
       category properties such as <u>Lu</u> and <u>Nd</u> are supported. Details are given in the <b>pcrepattern</b> documentation.

</pre><h4><b>JUST-IN-TIME</b> <b>COMPILER</b> <b>SUPPORT</b></h4><pre>

       Just-in-time compiler support is included in the build by specifying

         --enable-jit

       This support is available only for  certain  hardware  architectures.  If  this  option  is  set  for  an
       unsupported architecture, a compile time error occurs.  See the <b>pcrejit</b> documentation for a discussion of
       JIT usage. When JIT support is enabled, pcregrep automatically makes use of it, unless you add

         --disable-pcregrep-jit

       to the "configure" command.

</pre><h4><b>CODE</b> <b>VALUE</b> <b>OF</b> <b>NEWLINE</b></h4><pre>

       By  default,  PCRE  interprets  the  linefeed (LF) character as indicating the end of a line. This is the
       normal newline character on Unix-like systems. You can compile PCRE to use carriage return (CR)  instead,
       by adding

         --enable-newline-is-cr

       to  the  <b>configure</b>  command.  There  is  also a --enable-newline-is-lf option, which explicitly specifies
       linefeed as the newline character.

       Alternatively, you can specify that line endings are to be indicated by the two character sequence  CRLF.
       If you want this, add

         --enable-newline-is-crlf

       to the <b>configure</b> command. There is a fourth option, specified by

         --enable-newline-is-anycrlf

       which  causes  PCRE  to recognize any of the three sequences CR, LF, or CRLF as indicating a line ending.
       Finally, a fifth option, specified by

         --enable-newline-is-any

       causes PCRE to recognize any Unicode newline sequence.

       Whatever line ending convention is selected when PCRE  is  built  can  be  overridden  when  the  library
       functions are called. At build time it is conventional to use the standard for your operating system.

</pre><h4><b>WHAT</b> <b>\R</b> <b>MATCHES</b></h4><pre>

       By default, the sequence \R in a pattern matches any Unicode newline sequence, whatever has been selected
       as the line ending sequence. If you specify

         --enable-bsr-anycrlf

       the  default  is changed so that \R matches only CR, LF, or CRLF. Whatever is selected when PCRE is built
       can be overridden when the library functions are called.

</pre><h4><b>POSIX</b> <b>MALLOC</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>

       When the 8-bit library  is  called  through  the  POSIX  interface  (see  the  <b>pcreposix</b>  documentation),
       additional  working  storage  is  required for holding the pointers to capturing substrings, because PCRE
       requires three integers per substring, whereas the POSIX interface provides only two. If  the  number  of
       expected  substrings  is small, the wrapper function uses space on the stack, because this is faster than
       using <b>malloc()</b> for each call. The default threshold above which the stack is no longer used is 10; it can
       be changed by adding a setting such as

         --with-posix-malloc-threshold=20

       to the <b>configure</b> command.

</pre><h4><b>HANDLING</b> <b>VERY</b> <b>LARGE</b> <b>PATTERNS</b></h4><pre>

       Within a compiled pattern, offset values are used to point from one part to another (for example, from an
       opening parenthesis to an alternation metacharacter). By default, in the 8-bit and 16-bit libraries, two-
       byte values are used for these offsets, leading to a maximum size for a compiled pattern of  around  64K.
       This  is  sufficient  to handle all but the most gigantic patterns.  Nevertheless, some people do want to
       process truly enormous patterns, so it is possible to compile PCRE to use three-byte or four-byte offsets
       by adding a setting such as

         --with-link-size=3

       to the <b>configure</b> command. The value given must be 2, 3, or 4. For the 16-bit library, a  value  of  3  is
       rounded up to 4. In these libraries, using longer offsets slows down the operation of PCRE because it has
       to  load  additional  data when handling them. For the 32-bit library the value is always 4 and cannot be
       overridden; the value of --with-link-size is ignored.

</pre><h4><b>AVOIDING</b> <b>EXCESSIVE</b> <b>STACK</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>

       When matching with the <b>pcre_exec()</b> function, PCRE implements backtracking by making recursive calls to an
       internal function called <b>match()</b>. In environments where the size  of  the  stack  is  limited,  this  can
       severely  limit PCRE's operation. (The Unix environment does not usually suffer from this problem, but it
       may sometimes be necessary to increase the maximum stack size.  There is a discussion  in  the  <b>pcrestack</b>
       documentation.)  An  alternative  approach  to recursion that uses memory from the heap to remember data,
       instead of using recursive function calls, has been implemented to work  round  the  problem  of  limited
       stack size. If you want to build a version of PCRE that works this way, add

         --disable-stack-for-recursion

       to   the   <b>configure</b>   command.  With  this  configuration,  PCRE  will  use  the  <b>pcre_stack_malloc</b>  and
       <b>pcre_stack_free</b> variables to call memory management functions. By default these  point  to  <b>malloc()</b>  and
       <b>free()</b>, but you can replace the pointers so that your own functions are used instead.

       Separate  functions  are  provided  rather than using <b>pcre_malloc</b> and <b>pcre_free</b> because the usage is very
       predictable: the block sizes requested are always the same, and the blocks are always  freed  in  reverse
       order. A calling program might be able to implement optimized functions that perform better than <b>malloc()</b>
       and  <b>free()</b>.  PCRE  runs  noticeably  more  slowly  when  built in this way. This option affects only the
       <b>pcre_exec()</b> function; it is not relevant for <b>pcre_dfa_exec()</b>.

</pre><h4><b>LIMITING</b> <b>PCRE</b> <b>RESOURCE</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>

       Internally, PCRE has a function called <b>match()</b>, which it calls repeatedly  (sometimes  recursively)  when
       matching  a  pattern  with  the  <b>pcre_exec()</b>  function.  By  controlling the maximum number of times this
       function may be called during a single matching operation, a limit can be placed on the resources used by
       a single call to <b>pcre_exec()</b>. The limit can  be  changed  at  run  time,  as  described  in  the  <b>pcreapi</b>
       documentation. The default is 10 million, but this can be changed by adding a setting such as

         --with-match-limit=500000

       to the <b>configure</b> command. This setting has no effect on the <b>pcre_dfa_exec()</b> matching function.

       In  some environments it is desirable to limit the depth of recursive calls of <b>match()</b> more strictly than
       the total number of calls, in order to restrict the maximum amount of stack (or heap, if --disable-stack-
       for-recursion is specified) that is used. A second limit controls this; it defaults to the value that  is
       set  for  --with-match-limit, which imposes no additional constraints. However, you can set a lower limit
       by adding, for example,

         --with-match-limit-recursion=10000

       to the <b>configure</b> command. This value can also be overridden at run time.

</pre><h4><b>CREATING</b> <b>CHARACTER</b> <b>TABLES</b> <b>AT</b> <b>BUILD</b> <b>TIME</b></h4><pre>

       PCRE uses fixed tables for processing characters whose code values are less than 256. By default, PCRE is
       built with a set of tables that are distributed in the file <u>pcre_chartables.c.dist</u>. These tables are  for
       ASCII codes only. If you add

         --enable-rebuild-chartables

       to  the <b>configure</b> command, the distributed tables are no longer used.  Instead, a program called <b>dftables</b>
       is compiled and run. This outputs the source for new set of tables, created in the default locale of your
       C run-time system. (This method of replacing the tables does not work if you are cross compiling, because
       <b>dftables</b> is run on the local host. If you need to create alternative tables  when  cross  compiling,  you
       will have to do so "by hand".)

</pre><h4><b>USING</b> <b>EBCDIC</b> <b>CODE</b></h4><pre>

       PCRE assumes by default that it will run in an environment where the character code is ASCII (or Unicode,
       which  is  a superset of ASCII). This is the case for most computer operating systems. PCRE can, however,
       be compiled to run in an EBCDIC environment by adding

         --enable-ebcdic

       to the <b>configure</b> command. This setting implies --enable-rebuild-chartables. You should only use it if you
       know that you are in an EBCDIC  environment  (for  example,  an  IBM  mainframe  operating  system).  The
       --enable-ebcdic option is incompatible with --enable-utf.

       The  EBCDIC  character  that  corresponds  to  an  ASCII LF is assumed to have the value 0x15 by default.
       However, in some EBCDIC environments, 0x25 is used. In such an environment you should use

         --enable-ebcdic-nl25

       as well as, or instead of, --enable-ebcdic. The EBCDIC character for CR has the same value as  in  ASCII,
       namely,  0x0d.  Whichever  of  0x15 and 0x25 is <u>not</u> chosen as LF is made to correspond to the Unicode NEL
       character (which, in Unicode, is 0x85).

       The options that select newline  behaviour,  such  as  --enable-newline-is-cr,  and  equivalent  run-time
       options, refer to these character values in an EBCDIC environment.

</pre><h4><b>PCREGREP</b> <b>OPTIONS</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>COMPRESSED</b> <b>FILE</b> <b>SUPPORT</b></h4><pre>

       By  default,  <b>pcregrep</b>  reads all files as plain text. You can build it so that it recognizes files whose
       names end in <b>.gz</b> or <b>.bz2</b>, and reads them with <b>libz</b> or <b>libbz2</b>, respectively, by adding one or both of

         --enable-pcregrep-libz
         --enable-pcregrep-libbz2

       to the <b>configure</b> command. These options naturally require that the relevant libraries  are  installed  on
       your system. Configuration will fail if they are not.

</pre><h4><b>PCREGREP</b> <b>BUFFER</b> <b>SIZE</b></h4><pre>

       <b>pcregrep</b>  uses  an  internal buffer to hold a "window" on the file it is scanning, in order to be able to
       output "before" and "after" lines when it finds a match. The size  of  the  buffer  is  controlled  by  a
       parameter  whose default value is 20K. The buffer itself is three times this size, but because of the way
       it is used for holding "before" lines, the longest line that is  guaranteed  to  be  processable  is  the
       parameter size. You can change the default parameter value by adding, for example,

         --with-pcregrep-bufsize=50K

       to  the  <b>configure</b> command. The caller of <b>pcregrep</b> can, however, override this value by specifying a run-
       time option.

</pre><h4><b>PCRETEST</b> <b>OPTION</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>LIBREADLINE</b> <b>SUPPORT</b></h4><pre>

       If you add

         --enable-pcretest-libreadline

       to the <b>configure</b> command, <b>pcretest</b> is linked with the <b>libreadline</b> library, and when its input is  from  a
       terminal,  it  reads it using the <b>readline()</b> function. This provides line-editing and history facilities.
       Note that <b>libreadline</b> is GPL-licensed, so if you distribute a binary of  <b>pcretest</b>  linked  in  this  way,
       there may be licensing issues.

       Setting  this  option  causes  the <b>-lreadline</b> option to be added to the <b>pcretest</b> build. In many operating
       environments with a sytem-installed <b>libreadline</b> this is sufficient. However, in some  environments  (e.g.
       if  an unmodified distribution version of readline is in use), some extra configuration may be necessary.
       The INSTALL file for <b>libreadline</b> says this:

         "Readline uses the termcap functions, but does not link with the
         termcap or curses library itself, allowing applications which link
         with readline the to choose an appropriate library."

       If your environment has not been set up so that an appropriate library is automatically included, you may
       need to add something like

         LIBS="-ncurses"

       immediately before the <b>configure</b> command.

</pre><h4><b>DEBUGGING</b> <b>WITH</b> <b>VALGRIND</b> <b>SUPPORT</b></h4><pre>

       By adding the

         --enable-valgrind

       option to to the <b>configure</b> command, PCRE will use valgrind annotations to mark certain memory regions  as
       unaddressable.  This allows it to detect invalid memory accesses, and is mostly useful for debugging PCRE
       itself.

</pre><h4><b>CODE</b> <b>COVERAGE</b> <b>REPORTING</b></h4><pre>

       If your C compiler is gcc, you can build a version of PCRE that can generate a code coverage  report  for
       its test suite. To enable this, you must install <b>lcov</b> version 1.6 or above. Then specify

         --enable-coverage

       to the <b>configure</b> command and build PCRE in the usual way.

       Note  that  using <b>ccache</b> (a caching C compiler) is incompatible with code coverage reporting. If you have
       configured <b>ccache</b> to run automatically on your system, you must set the environment variable

         CCACHE_DISABLE=1

       before running <b>make</b> to build PCRE, so that <b>ccache</b> is not used.

       When --enable-coverage is used, the following addition targets are added to the <u>Makefile</u>:

         make coverage

       This creates a fresh coverage report for the PCRE test suite. It is equivalent to running "make coverage-
       reset", "make coverage-baseline", "make check", and then "make coverage-report".

         make coverage-reset

       This zeroes the coverage counters, but does nothing else.

         make coverage-baseline

       This captures baseline coverage information.

         make coverage-report

       This creates the coverage report.

         make coverage-clean-report

       This removes the generated coverage report without cleaning the coverage data itself.

         make coverage-clean-data

       This removes the captured coverage data without removing the  coverage  files  created  at  compile  time
       (*.gcno).

         make coverage-clean

       This  cleans  all  coverage data including the generated coverage report. For more information about code
       coverage, see the <b>gcov</b> and <b>lcov</b> documentation.
