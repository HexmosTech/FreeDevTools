</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       PCRE2 - Perl-compatible regular expressions (revised API)

</pre><h4><b>PCRE2</b> <b>REGULAR</b> <b>EXPRESSION</b> <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>SUMMARY</b></h4><pre>

       The  full  syntax  and  semantics  of  the  regular  expression  patterns that are supported by PCRE2 are
       described in the <b>pcre2pattern</b> documentation. This document contains  a  quick-reference  summary  of  the
       pattern  syntax  followed  by  the  syntax  of  replacement  strings  in substitution function.  The full
       description of the latter is in the <b>pcre2api</b> documentation.

</pre><h4><b>QUOTING</b></h4><pre>

         \x         where x is non-alphanumeric is a literal x
         \Q...\E    treat enclosed characters as literal

       Note that white space inside \Q...\E is always treated as literal, even if PCRE2_EXTENDED is set, causing
       most other white space to be ignored. Note also that PCRE2's handling of  \Q...\E  has  some  differences
       from Perl's. See the <b>pcre2pattern</b> documentation for details.

</pre><h4><b>BRACED</b> <b>ITEMS</b></h4><pre>

       With one exception, wherever brace characters { and } are required to enclose data for constructions such
       as  \g{2}  or \k{name}, space and/or horizontal tab characters that follow { or precede } are allowed and
       are ignored. In the case of quantifiers, they may also appear before or after the comma. The exception is
       \u{...} which is not Perl-compatible and is recognized only when PCRE2_EXTRA_ALT_BSUX is set. This is  an
       ECMAScript compatibility feature, and follows ECMAScript's behaviour.

</pre><h4><b>ESCAPED</b> <b>CHARACTERS</b></h4><pre>

       This table applies to ASCII and Unicode environments. An unrecognized escape sequence causes an error.

         \a         alarm, that is, the BEL character (hex 07)
         \cx        "control-x", where x is a non-control ASCII character
         \e         escape (hex 1B)
         \f         form feed (hex 0C)
         \n         newline (hex 0A)
         \r         carriage return (hex 0D)
         \t         tab (hex 09)
         \0dd       character with octal code 0dd
         \ddd       character with octal code ddd, or backreference
         \o{ddd..}  character with octal code ddd..
         \N{U+hh..} character with Unicode code point hh.. (Unicode mode only)
         \xhh       character with hex code hh
         \x{hh..}   character with hex code hh..

       \N{U+hh..}  is synonymous with \x{hh..} but is not supported in environments that use EBCDIC code (mainly
       IBM mainframes). Note that \N not followed by an opening curly  bracket  has  a  different  meaning  (see
       below).

       If PCRE2_ALT_BSUX or PCRE2_EXTRA_ALT_BSUX is set ("ALT_BSUX mode"), the following are also recognized:

         \U         the character "U"
         \uhhhh     character with hex code hhhh
         \u{hh..}   character with hex code hh.. but only for EXTRA_ALT_BSUX

       When  \x  is  not  followed by {, one or two hexadecimal digits are read, but in ALT_BSUX mode \x must be
       followed by two hexadecimal digits to be recognized as a  hexadecimal  escape;  otherwise  it  matches  a
       literal  "x".   Likewise,  if  \u  (in  ALT_BSUX  mode) is not followed by four hexadecimal digits or (in
       EXTRA_ALT_BSUX mode) a sequence of hex digits in curly brackets, it matches a literal "u".

       Note that \0dd is always an octal code. The treatment of  backslash  followed  by  a  non-zero  digit  is
       complicated;  for  details  see  the section "Non-printing characters" in the <b>pcre2pattern</b> documentation,
       where details of escape processing in EBCDIC environments are also given.

</pre><h4><b>CHARACTER</b> <b>TYPES</b></h4><pre>

         .          any character except newline;
                      in dotall mode, any character whatsoever
         \C         one code unit, even in UTF mode (best avoided)
         \d         a decimal digit
         \D         a character that is not a decimal digit
         \h         a horizontal white space character
         \H         a character that is not a horizontal white space character
         \N         a character that is not a newline
         \p{<u>xx</u>}     a character with the <u>xx</u> property
         \P{<u>xx</u>}     a character without the <u>xx</u> property
         \R         a newline sequence
         \s         a white space character
         \S         a character that is not a white space character
         \v         a vertical white space character
         \V         a character that is not a vertical white space character
         \w         a "word" character
         \W         a "non-word" character
         \X         a Unicode extended grapheme cluster

       \C is dangerous because it may leave the current matching point in  the  middle  of  a  UTF-8  or  UTF-16
       character.  The  application can lock out the use of \C by setting the PCRE2_NEVER_BACKSLASH_C option. It
       is also possible to build PCRE2 with the use of \C permanently disabled.

       By default, \d, \s, and \w match only ASCII characters, even in UTF-8 mode or in the  16-bit  and  32-bit
       libraries.  However,  if  locale-specific matching is happening, \s and \w may also match characters with
       code points in the range 128-255. If the PCRE2_UCP option is set, the behaviour of these escape sequences
       is changed to use Unicode properties and they match many more  characters,  but  there  are  some  option
       settings that can restrict individual sequences to matching only ASCII characters.

       Property  descriptions  in  \p and \P are matched caselessly; hyphens, underscores, and ASCII white space
       characters  are  ignored,  in  accordance  with  Unicode's   "loose   matching"   rules.   For   example,
       \p{Bidi_Class=al} is the same as \p{ bidi class = AL }.

         Xwd        Perl word: property Xan or underscore

       Perl and POSIX space are now the same. Perl added VT to its space character set at release 5.18.

</pre><h4><b>BINARY</b> <b>PROPERTIES</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>\p</b> <b>AND</b> <b>\P</b></h4><pre>

       Unicode  defines  a number of binary properties, that is, properties whose only values are true or false.
       You can obtain a list of those that are recognized by \p and  \P,  along  with  their  abbreviations,  by
       running this command:

         pcre2test -LP

</pre><h4><b>SCRIPT</b> <b>MATCHING</b> <b>WITH</b> <b>\p</b> <b>AND</b> <b>\P</b></h4><pre>

       Many  script names and their 4-letter abbreviations are recognized in \p{sc:...} or \p{scx:...} items, or
       on their own with \p (and also \P of course). You can obtain a list of  these  scripts  by  running  this
       command:

         pcre2test -LS

</pre><h4><b>THE</b> <b>BIDI_CLASS</b> <b>PROPERTY</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>\p</b> <b>AND</b> <b>\P</b></h4><pre>

         \p{Bidi_Class:&lt;class&gt;}   matches a character with the given class
         \p{BC:&lt;class&gt;}           matches a character with the given class

       The recognized classes are:

         AL          Arabic letter
         AN          Arabic number
         B           paragraph separator

       In  PCRE2,  POSIX  character  set  names recognize only ASCII characters by default, but some of them use
       Unicode properties if PCRE2_UCP is set. You can use \Q...\E inside a character class.

       When PCRE2_ALT_EXTENDED_CLASS is set, UTS#18 extended character classes  may  be  used,  allowing  nested
       character classes, combined using set operators.

         [x&amp;&amp;[^y]]   UTS#18 extended character class

         x||y        set union (OR)
         x&amp;&amp;y        set intersection (AND)
         x--y        set difference (AND NOT)
         x~~y        set symmetric difference (XOR)

</pre><h4><b>PERL</b> <b>EXTENDED</b> <b>CHARACTER</b> <b>CLASSES</b></h4><pre>

         (?[...])                Perl extended character class
         (?[\p{Thai} &amp; \p{Nd}])  operators; whitespace ignored
         (?[(x - y) &amp; z])        parentheses for grouping

         (?[ [^3] &amp; \p{Nd} ])    [...] is a nested ordinary class
         (?[ [:alpha:] - [z] ])  POSIX set is allowed outside [...]
         (?[ \d - [3] ])         backslash-escaped set is allowed outside [...]
         (?[ !\n &amp; [:ascii:] ])  backslash-escaped character is allowed outside [...]
                             all other characters or ranges must be enclosed in [...]

         x|y, x+y                set union (OR)
         x&amp;y                     set intersection (AND)
         x-y                     set difference (AND NOT)
         x^y                     set symmetric difference (XOR)
         !x                      set complement (NOT)

       Inside  a  Perl  extended character class, [...] switches mode to be interpreted as an ordinary character
       class. Outside of a nested [...], the only items permitted are backslash-escapes, POSIX sets,  operators,
       and  parentheses. Inside a nested ordinary class, ^ has its usual meaning (inverts the class when used as
       the first character); outside of a nested class, ^ is the XOR operator.

         (?^)            unset imnrsx options

       (?aP)  implies  (?aT)  as  well, though this has no additional effect. However, it means that (?-aP) also
       implies (?-aT) and disables all ASCII restrictions for POSIX classes.

       Unsetting x or xx unsets both. Several options may be set at once, and a mixture of setting and unsetting
       such as (?i-x) is allowed, but there may be only one hyphen. Setting (but no unsetting) is allowed  after
       (?^  for  example  (?^in).  An option setting may appear at the start of a non-capture group, for example
       (?i:...).

       The following are recognized only at the very start of a pattern or  after  one  of  the  newline  or  \R
       sequences  or  options with similar syntax. More than one of them may appear. For the first three, d is a
       decimal number.

         (*LIMIT_DEPTH=d)     set the backtracking limit to d
         (*LIMIT_HEAP=d)      set the heap size limit to d * 1024 bytes
         (*LIMIT_MATCH=d)     set the match limit to d
         (*CASELESS_RESTRICT) set PCRE2_EXTRA_CASELESS_RESTRICT when matching
         (*NOTEMPTY)          set PCRE2_NOTEMPTY when matching
         (*NOTEMPTY_ATSTART)  set PCRE2_NOTEMPTY_ATSTART when matching
         (*NO_AUTO_POSSESS)   no auto-possessification (PCRE2_NO_AUTO_POSSESS)
         (*NO_DOTSTAR_ANCHOR) no .* anchoring (PCRE2_NO_DOTSTAR_ANCHOR)
         (*NO_JIT)            disable JIT optimization
         (*NO_START_OPT)      no start-match optimization (PCRE2_NO_START_OPTIMIZE)
         (*TURKISH_CASING)    set PCRE2_EXTRA_TURKISH_CASING when matching
         (*UTF)               set appropriate UTF mode for the library in use
         (*UCP)               set PCRE2_UCP (use Unicode properties for \d etc)

       Note that LIMIT_DEPTH, LIMIT_HEAP, and LIMIT_MATCH can only reduce the value of the  limits  set  by  the
       caller  of  <b>pcre2_match()</b> or <b>pcre2_dfa_match()</b>, not increase them. LIMIT_RECURSION is an obsolete synonym
       for LIMIT_DEPTH. The application can lock out the use of (*UTF) and (*UCP) by setting the PCRE2_NEVER_UTF
       or PCRE2_NEVER_UCP options, respectively, at compile time.

</pre><h4><b>NEWLINE</b> <b>CONVENTION</b></h4><pre>

       These are recognized only at the very start of the pattern  or  after  option  settings  with  a  similar
       syntax.

         (*CR)           carriage return only
         (*LF)           linefeed only
         (*CRLF)         carriage return followed by linefeed
         (*ANYCRLF)      all three of the above
         (*ANY)          any Unicode newline sequence
         (*NUL)          the NUL character (binary zero)

</pre><h4><b>WHAT</b> <b>\R</b> <b>MATCHES</b></h4><pre>

       These are recognized only at the very start of the pattern or after option setting with a similar syntax.

         (*BSR_ANYCRLF)  CR, LF, or CRLF
         (*BSR_UNICODE)  any Unicode newline sequence

</pre><h4><b>LOOKAHEAD</b> <b>AND</b> <b>LOOKBEHIND</b> <b>ASSERTIONS</b></h4><pre>

         (?=...)                     )
         (*pla:...)                  ) positive lookahead
         (*positive_lookahead:...)   )

         (?!...)                     )
         (*nla:...)                  ) negative lookahead
         (*negative_lookahead:...)   )

         (*plb:...)                  ) positive lookbehind
         (*positive_lookbehind:...)  )

         (?&lt;!...)                    )
         (*nlb:...)                  ) negative lookbehind
         (*negative_lookbehind:...)  )

       Each  top-level  branch of a lookbehind must have a limit for the number of characters it matches. If any
       branch can match a variable number of characters, the maximum for each branch is limited to a  value  set
       by  the  caller of <b>pcre2_compile()</b> or defaulted. The default is set when PCRE2 is built (ultimate default
       255). If every branch matches a  fixed  number  of  characters,  the  limit  for  each  branch  is  65535
       characters.

</pre><h4><b>NON-ATOMIC</b> <b>LOOKAROUND</b> <b>ASSERTIONS</b></h4><pre>

       These assertions are specific to PCRE2 and are not Perl-compatible.

         (?P=name)       reference by name (Python)

</pre><h4><b>SUBROUTINE</b> <b>REFERENCES</b> <b>(POSSIBLY</b> <b>RECURSIVE)</b></h4><pre>

         (?R)            recurse whole pattern
         (?n)            call subroutine by absolute number
         (?+n)           call subroutine by relative number

         \g'-n'          call subroutine by relative number (PCRE2 extension)

</pre><h4><b>CONDITIONAL</b> <b>PATTERNS</b></h4><pre>

         (?(condition)yes-pattern)
         (?(condition)yes-pattern|no-pattern)

         (?(n)               absolute reference condition
         (?(+n)              relative reference condition (PCRE2 extension)
         (?(-n)              relative reference condition (PCRE2 extension)
         (?(&lt;name&gt;)          named reference condition (Perl)

         (?(name)            named reference condition (PCRE2, deprecated)
         (?(R)               overall recursion condition
         (?(Rn)              specific numbered group recursion condition
         (?(R&amp;name)          specific named group recursion condition
         (?(DEFINE)          define groups for reference
         (?(VERSION[&gt;]=n.m)  test PCRE2 version
         (?(assert)          assertion condition

       Note the ambiguity of (?(R) and (?(Rn) which might be named reference conditions or recursion tests. Such
       a condition is interpreted as a reference condition if the relevant named group exists.

</pre><h4><b>BACKTRACKING</b> <b>CONTROL</b></h4><pre>

       All  backtracking  control  verbs may be in the form (*VERB:NAME). For (*MARK) the name is mandatory, for
       the others it is optional. (*SKIP) changes its behaviour if :NAME is present. The others just set a  name
       for  passing  back  to  the  caller,  but  this  is  not  a  name that (*SKIP) can see. The following act
       immediately they are reached:

         (*ACCEPT)       force successful match
         (*FAIL)         force backtrack; synonym (*F)
         (*MARK:NAME)    set name to be passed back; synonym (*:NAME)

       The following act only when a subsequent match failure causes a backtrack to reach them. They all force a
       match failure, but they differ in what happens afterwards. Those that advance the start-of-match point do
       so only if the pattern is not anchored.

         (*COMMIT)       overall failure, no advance of starting point
         (*PRUNE)        advance to next starting character
         (*SKIP)         advance to current matching position
         (*SKIP:NAME)    advance to position corresponding to an earlier
                         (*MARK:NAME); if not found, the (*SKIP) is ignored
         (*THEN)         local failure, backtrack to next alternation

       The effect of one of these verbs in a group called as a subroutine is confined to the subroutine call.

</pre><h4><b>CALLOUTS</b></h4><pre>

         (?C)            callout (assumed number 0)
         (?Cn)           callout with numerical data n
         (?C"text")      callout with string data

       The allowed string delimiters are ` ' " ^ % # $ (which are the same for the start and the end),  and  the
       starting  delimiter  {  matched  with  the  ending delimiter }. To encode the ending delimiter within the
       string, double it.

</pre><h4><b>REPLACEMENT</b> <b>STRINGS</b></h4><pre>

       If the PCRE2_SUBSTITUTE_LITERAL option is  set,  a  replacement  string  for  <b>pcre2_substitute()</b>  is  not
       interpreted.  Otherwise,  by  default,  the  only special character is the dollar character in one of the
       following forms:

         $$                  insert a dollar character
         $n or ${n}          insert the contents of group <u>n</u>
         $&lt;name&gt;             insert the contents of named group
         $0 or $&amp;            insert the entire matched substring
         $`                  insert the substring that precedes the match
         $'                  insert the substring that follows the match
         $_                  insert the entire input string
         $*MARK or ${*MARK}  insert a control verb name

       For ${n}, n can be a name  or  a  number.  If  PCRE2_SUBSTITUTE_EXTENDED  is  set,  there  is  additional
       interpretation:

       1.  Backslash  is  an  escape  character,  and  the  forms  described  in  "ESCAPED CHARACTERS" above are
       recognized. Also:

         \Q...\E   can be used to suppress interpretation
         \l        force the next character to lower case
         \u        force the next character to upper case
         \L        force subsequent characters to lower case
         \U        force subsequent characters to upper case
         \u\L      force next character to upper case, then all lower
         \l\U      force next character to lower case, then all upper
         \E        end \L or \U case forcing
         \b        backspace character (note: as in character class in pattern)
         \v        vertical tab character (note: not the same as in a pattern)

       2. The Python form \g&lt;n&gt;, where the angle brackets are part of the syntax and <u>n</u> is either a group name or
       a number, is recognized as an alternative way of inserting the contents of a group, for example \g&lt;3&gt;.

       3. Capture substitution supports the following additional forms:

         ${n:-string}             default for unset group
         ${n:+string1:string2}    values for set/unset group

       The substitution strings themselves are expanded. Backslash can be used  to  escape  colons  and  closing
       curly brackets.
