</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Math::Prime::Util::PP - Pure Perl version of Math::Prime::Util

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       Version 0.73

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       The functionality is basically identical to Math::Prime::Util, as this module is just the Pure Perl
       implementation.  This documentation will only note differences.

         # Normally you would just import the functions you are using.
         # Nothing is exported by default.
         use Math::Prime::Util ':all';

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Pure Perl implementations of prime number utilities that are normally handled with XS or GMP.  Having the
       Perl implementations (1) provides examples, (2) allows the functions to run even if XS isn't available,
       and (3) gives big number support if Math::Prime::Util::GMP isn't available.  This is a subset of
       Math::Prime::Util's functionality.

       All routines should work with native integers or multi-precision numbers.  To enable big numbers, use
       bigint or bignum:

           use bigint;
           say <a href="../man1000000000000000000000000/prime_count_approx.1000000000000000000000000.html">prime_count_approx</a>(1000000000000000000000000)'
           # says 18435599767347543283712

       This is still experimental, and some functions will be very slow.  The Math::Prime::Util::GMP module has
       much faster versions of many of these functions.  Alternately, Math::Pari has a lot of these types of
       functions.

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>euler_phi</b>
       Takes a <u>single</u> integer input and returns the Euler totient.

   <b>euler_phi_range</b>
       Takes two values defining a range "low" to "high" and returns an array with the totient of each value in
       the range, inclusive.

   <b>moebius</b>
       Takes a <u>single</u> integer input and returns the Moebius function.

   <b>moebius_range</b>
       Takes two values defining a range "low" to "high" and returns an array with the Moebius function of each
       value in the range, inclusive.

</pre><h4><b>LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The SQUFOF and Fermat factoring algorithms are not implemented yet.

       Some of the prime methods use more memory than they should, as the segmented sieve is not properly used
       in "primes" and "prime_count".

</pre><h4><b>PERFORMANCE</b></h4><pre>
       Performance compared to the XS/C code is quite poor for many operations.  Some operations that are
       relatively close for small and medium-size values:

         next_prime / prev_prime
         is_prime / is_prob_prime
         is_strong_pseudoprime
         ExponentialIntegral / LogarithmicIntegral / RiemannR
         primearray

       Operations that are slower include:

         primes
         random_prime / random_ndigit_prime
         factor / factor_exp / divisors
         nth_prime
         prime_count
         is_aks_prime

       Performance improvement in this code is still possible.  The prime sieve is over 2x faster than anything
       I was able to find online, but it is still has room for improvement.

       Math::Prime::Util::GMP offers "C+XS+GMP" support for most of the important functions, and will be vastly
       faster for most operations.  If you install that module, Math::Prime::Util will load it automatically,
       meaning you should not have to think about what code is actually being used (C, GMP, or Perl).

       Memory use will generally be higher for the PP code, and in some cases <b>much</b> higher.  Some of this may be
       addressed in a later release.

       For small values (e.g. primes and prime counts under 10M) most of this will not matter.
