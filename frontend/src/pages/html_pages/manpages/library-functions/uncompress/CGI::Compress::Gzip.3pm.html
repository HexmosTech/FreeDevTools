</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
          use CGI::Compress::Gzip;

          my $cgi = new CGI::Compress::Gzip;
          print $cgi-&gt;header();
          print "&lt;html&gt; ...";

       See the CAVEATS section below!

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       CGI::Compress::Gzip extends the CGI module to auto-detect whether the client browser wants compressed
       output and, if so and if the script chooses HTML output, apply gzip compression on any content header for
       STDOUT.  This module is intended to be a drop-in replacement for CGI.pm.

       Apache mod_perl users may wish to consider the Apache::Compress or Apache::GzipChain modules, which allow
       more transparent output compression than this module can provide.  However, as of this writing those
       modules are more aggressive about compressing, regardless of Content-Type.

   <b>Headers</b>
       At the time that a header is requested, CGI::Compress::Gzip checks the HTTP_ACCEPT_ENCODING environment
       variable (passed by Apache).  If this variable includes the flag "gzip" and the outgoing mime-type is
       "text/*", then gzipped output is preferred.  [the default mime-type selection of text/* can be changed by
       subclassing -- see below]  The header is altered to add the "Content-Encoding: gzip" flag which indicates
       that compression is turned on.

       Naturally, it is crucial that the CGI application output nothing before the header is printed.  If this
       is violated, things will go badly.

   <b>Compression</b>
       When the header is created, this module sets up a new filehandle to accept data.  STDOUT is redirected
       through that filehandle.  The new filehandle passes data verbatim until it detects the end of the CGI
       header.  At that time, it switches over to Gzip output for the remainder of the CGI run.

       Note that the Zlib library on which this code is ultimately based requires a fileno for the output
       filehandle.  Where the output filehandle is faked (i.e. in mod_perl), we instead use in-memory
       compression.  This is more wasteful of RAM, but it is the only solution I've found (and it is one shared
       by the Apache::* compression modules).

       Debugging note: if you set <b>$CGI::Compress::Gzip::global_give_reason</b> to a true value, then this module
       will add an HTTP header entry called <b>X-non-gzip-reason</b> with an explanation of why it chose not to gzip
       the output stream.

   <b>Buffering</b>
       The Zlib library introduces latencies.  In some cases, this module may delay output until the CGI object
       is garbage collected, presumably at the end of the program.  This buffering can be detrimental to long-
       lived programs which are supposed to have incremental output, causing browser timeouts.  To compensate,
       compression is automatically disabled when autoflush (i.e. the $| variable) is set to true.  Future
       versions may try to enable autoflushing on the Zlib filehandles, if possible [Help wanted].

</pre><h4><b>CLASS</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       $pkg-&gt;new([CGI ARGS])
           Create  a  new object.  This resets the environment before creating a CGI.pm object.  This should not
           be called more than once per script run!  All arguments are passed to the parent class.

       $pkg-&gt;useCompression($boolean)
       $self-&gt;useCompression($boolean)
           This can be used as a class method or an instance  method.   The  former  is  included  for  backward
           compatibility,  and  is  NOT  recommended.  As a class method, this changes the default value.  As an
           instance method it affects only the specified instance.

           Turn compression on/off for the target.   If  turned  on,  compression  will  be  used  only  if  the
           prerequisite compression libraries are available and if the client browser requests compression.

           Defaults to on.

</pre><h4><b>INSTANCE</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       $self-&gt;useFileHandle($filehandle)
           Manually  set  the output filehandle.  Because of limitations of Zlib, this MUST be a real filehandle
           (with valid results from <b>fileno()</b>) and not a pseudo filehandle like IO::String.

           If this is not set, STDOUT is used.

       $self-&gt;isCompressibleType($content_type)
           Given a MIME type (with possible charset attached), return a boolean indicating if this media type is
           a good candidate for compression.  This implementation is simply:

               return $type =~ /^text\//;

           Subclasses may wish to override this method to apply different criteria.

       $self-&gt;header([HEADER ARGS])
           Overrides the header() method in CGI.

           Return a CGI header with the compression flags set properly.  Returns an empty string is a header has
           already been printed.

           This method engages the Gzip output by fiddling with the default output filehandle.   All  subsequent
           output via usual Perl <b>print()</b> will be automatically gzipped except for this header (which must go out
           as plain text).

           Any  arguments  will be passed on to CGI::header.  This method should NOT be called if you don't want
           your header or STDOUT to be fiddled with.

       $self-&gt;<b>DESTROY()</b>
           Override the CGI destructor so we can close the Gzip output stream, if there is one open.

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Apache::Registry</b>
       Under Apache::Registry, global variables may not go out of scope in time.  This may causes  timing  bugs,
       since  this  module makes use of the <b>DESTROY()</b> method.  To avoid this issue, make sure your CGI object is
       stored in a scoped variable.

          # BROKEN CODE
          use CGI::Compress::Gzip;
          $q = CGI::Compress::Gzip-&gt;new;
          print $q-&gt;header;
          print "Hello, world\n";

          # WORKAROUND CODE
          use CGI::Compress::Gzip;
          do {
            my $q = CGI::Compress::Gzip-&gt;new;
            print $q-&gt;header;
            print "Hello, world\n";
          }

   <b>Filehandles</b>
       This module works by changing the  default  filehandle.   It  does  not  change  STDOUT  at  all.   As  a
       consequence, your programs should call "print" without a filehandle argument.

          # BROKEN CODE
          use CGI::Compress::Gzip;
          my $q = CGI::Compress::Gzip-&gt;new;
          print STDOUT $q-&gt;header;
          print STDOUT "Hello, world\n";

          # WORKAROUND CODE
          use CGI::Compress::Gzip;
          my $q = CGI::Compress::Gzip-&gt;new;
          print $q-&gt;header;
          print "Hello, world\n";

       Future versions may steal away STDOUT and replace it with the compression filehandle, but that seemed too
       risky for this version.

   <b>Header</b> <b>Munging</b>
       When sending compressed output, the HTTP headers must remain uncompressed.  So, this module goes to great
       effort  to  keep  the  headers and body separate.  That has led to <b>CGI::header()</b> emulation code that is a
       little brittle.  Most potential problems arise because STDOUT gets tweaked as soon as <b>header()</b> is called.

       If you use the CGI.pm <b>header()</b> API as specified in CGI.pm, then all  should  go  well.   But  if  you  do
       anything unusual, this module may break.  For example:

          # BROKEN CODE
          use CGI::Compress::Gzip;
          my $q = CGI::Compress::Gzip-&gt;new;
          print "Set-Cookie: foo=bar\n" . $q-&gt;header;
          print "Hello, world\n";

          # WORKAROUND 1 (preferred)
          use CGI::Compress::Gzip;
          my $q = CGI::Compress::Gzip-&gt;new;
          print $q-&gt;header("-Set_Cookie" =&gt; "foo=bar");
          print "Hello, world\n";

          # WORKAROUND 2
          use CGI::Compress::Gzip;
          my $q = CGI::Compress::Gzip-&gt;new;
          print "Set-Cookie: foo=bar\n";
          print $q-&gt;header;
          print "Hello, world\n";

       Future  versions could try to parse the header to look for its end rather than insisting that the printed
       version match the version returned by <b>header()</b>.  Patches would be very welcome.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       CGI::Compress::Gzip depends on CGI and IO::Zlib.   Similar  functionality  is  available  from  mod_gzip,
       Apache::Compress   or   Apache::GzipChain,  however  all  of  those  require  changes  to  the  webserver
       configuration.

       Thanks to Laga Mahesa who did some Windows testing and experimentation.

       Thanks to Slaven Rezic who 1) found several header handling bugs, 2) discovered the Apache::Registry  and
       Filehandle  caveats,  3) provided a patch incorporated into v0.17, and 4) persisted with smoke tests that
       reproduced the envvar problem fixed in v0.23.

       Thanks to Jan Willamowius who found a header handling bug.

       Thanks to Andreas J. Koenig and brian d foy for module naming advice.

</pre><h4><b>HELP</b> <b>WANTED</b></h4><pre>
       If you like this module, please help by testing on Windows or in a "FastCGI" environment,  since  I  have
       neither available for easy testing.

       Personally, I don't use this module much anymore as all of my work is on Catalyst and mod_perl now.
