</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Email::MIME::Kit::Renderer::TestRenderer - extremely simple renderer for testing purposes only

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 3.000008

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The test renderer is like a version of Template Toolkit 2 that has had a crayon shoved up its nose and
       into its brain.  It can only do a very few things, but it does them well enough to test simple kits.

       Given the following template:

         This will say "I love pie": [% actor %] [% m_obj.verb() %] [% z_by("me") %]

       ...and the following set of variables:

         {
           actor =&gt; 'I',
           m_obj =&gt; $object_whose_verb_method_returns_love,
           z_by  =&gt; sub { 'me' },
         }

       ..then it will be a true statement.

       In method calls, the parens are <b>not</b> optional.  Anything between them (or between the parens in a coderef
       call) is evaluated like perl code.  For example, this will actually get the OS:

         [% z_by($^O) %]

</pre><h4><b>PERL</b> <b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This library should run on perls released even a long time ago.  It should work on any version of perl
       released in the last five years.

       Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made that the minimum required version
       will not be increased.  The version may be increased for any reason, and there is no promise that patches
       will be accepted to lower the minimum required perl.

</pre><h4><b>WARNING</b></h4><pre>
       Seriously, this is horrible code.  If you want, look at it.  It's swell for testing simple things, but if
       you use this for real mkits, you're going to be upset by something horrible soon.
