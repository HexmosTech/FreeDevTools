       Audio::RPLD - Module to communicate with RoarAudio PlayList Daemon

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        use Audio::RPLD;

        # Open new connection
        my $rpld = Audio::RPLD-&gt;new([$addr[, $type[, $port]]]);

        # Work with the connection
        $rpld-&gt;play();
        $rpld-&gt;stop();
        #...

        # close the connection

        # reconnect:
        $rpld-&gt;connect($addr[, $type[, $port]]);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module is used to communicate with a RoarAudio PlayList Daemon (rpld).  It includes support for
       nearly all of the protocol.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Common</b> <b>Arguments</b>
       Here is a list of all the arguments used in this documentation so I do not need to explain later for each
       method again.

       $addr
           The  Address of the server. This can be a filename or host or nodename.  If the type is known to you,
           you should set the $type argument.

           Do not limit the user to hostname or filenames or something. The user should be abled  to  enter  any
           server location in a freeform text input.

       $type
           This is the type of the address of the server. Currently defined types are:

           UNIX    Use a UNIX socket to connect to the server.

           DECnet  Use  a  DECnet  socket  to connect to the server (currently not supported because there is no
                   IO::Socket::DECnet yet).

           INET    Use a INET (IPv4) socket to connect to the server.

           #SOCKET Use a already connected socket as connection to the server. This can for example be a  object
                   opened  with a SSL/TLS or proxy module or any other bidirectional IO object. Object is passed
                   as $addr parameter.

           a value of undef
                   Use Autodetection.

       $port
           If using a INET socket this is the port number to connect to.  Use undef (not  include  in  arguments
           list) to use defaults.

       $playlist, $playlist_from, $playlist_to, $history
           A Playlist to use. This can be a integer to use the playlist ID (which is preferred), a string to use
           the  playlist  name  or  $any (return value of $rpld-&gt;<b>any()</b>) to search thru all playlists and use the
           first hint. $any is not supported by all commands as it does not make sense for all commands.

       $vol
           A volume. If this is an integer the volume is in range 0 to 65535 (recommended). If it's a string and
           suffixed by a '%' it is in range 0 to 100. A value of zero always means total silence.

       $size
           A history size. This is an integer or undef. If undef the server's default is used.

       $backend
           The address of a RoarAudio server as used as backend for a queue. If undef the default server will be
           used.

       $mixer
           The mixer ID of the mixer core which should be used by a queue. If undef the server's  default  mixer
           core will be used.  This should normally be undef.

       $role
           The  stream  role  as  used by a queue. This is the name or undef to use rpld's or RoarAudio server's
           default.   This  is  the  name  of  the  role  not  the  ID.  Common  values  include   "music"   and
           "background_music".

       $likeness
           A floating point describing how much the user likes a song.

       $name
           A string of a name of some object.

       $ple
           A  Playlist  entry  (item)  identifier. This is a string of one of the several types. Here is a quick
           overview:

           Long Global Track Number
                   The long GTN is a hex string (with leading 0x) prefixed by 'long:' with a length  of  64  bit
                   (16  raw  digits).   It is used to identify a playlist entry within the runtime of the server
                   process. This one is the one you normally use for all operations like  queuing  a  track  for
                   playback.

           Short Global Track Number
                   The  short GTN is a shorter (only 32 bit) version of the GTN prefixed with 'short:'. It's use
                   is exactly the same as for the long GTN. It exists to get the GTN passed thru things which do
                   not support more than 32 bit. As this is normally not the case for Perl (you pass them around
                   as strings anyway) you should not need to use it at all. It's not  recommended  to  use  this
                   one.

           UUID    The UUID is a string prefixed with 'uuid:' followed by the normal hex-dash notation (example:
                   uuid:54ab0c5f-b058-4c9b-ab3b-dea11b608482). It is used to identify a song. In contrast to the
                   GTN  this  is  not  changed by commands such like copy or move operations. The normal use for
                   this is if you want to store something over multiple runtimes  of  the  server  process  like
                   favorites or something.

                   If  a song does not include a UUID in it's meta data the server will generate a random one so
                   each song has one.

                   Those UUIDs can also be used together with the Tantalos protocol.

           Pointer A pointer is a string (the pointer name) prefixed by 'pointer:'  (example:  pointer:default).
                   Those  are  used  to  have  symbolic  pointers  a  playlist entry. The following pointers are
                   currently known by rpld:

                   default If the Main Queue runs out of songs and the current pointer reached the  end  of  the
                           current  playlist  the  current  pointer is set to this value and song lookup is done
                           again. For details about the current pointer see below.

                   current If the Main Queue run out of  queued  songs  the  song  this  pointer  points  to  is
                           automatically queued and this pointer is set to the next entry the the playlist. This
                           is used for 'start here and just play the playlist' behavior. If this pointer reaches
                           the  end  of  the  playlist  it  becomes  undefined and if the default pointer is set
                           redefined with it's value. See above for more information about the default pointer.

                   startup If the startup pointer is set the song it points to is added once at startup  of  the
                           daemon. This can for example be used to implement boot sounds.

                   temp    The  temp pointer is a pointer for user defined jobs. It is the only pointer which is
                           not global (shared with all clients) but a client local pointer. The application  can
                           use it for whatever it wants to use it for.

                   As  of  rpld  0.1rc7 multi queue support was added. To support this pointers can have a queue
                   and client ID suffix. The suffix has the syntax: pointer[queue:client]. Both queue and client
                   can be omitted. If the client ID is omitted the colon (':') can be omitted, too. If both  are
                   omitted  the  brackets  ('[]')  can  also  be omitted. Queue defaults to the current client's
                   default queue and client defaults to the current client.

           Numerical Index
                   This is a numerical index of the entry. It's format is num:N where N is  the  index  starting
                   with zero. For example num:0 is the first entry in playlist, num:15 is the 16th entry.

           Likeness Index
                   This is like the normal numerical index just uses the likeness values of the entries. This is
                   hardly  of  use  to  the  user  and  mainly for internal use. Syntax is likeness:F with F the
                   floating point index.

           Random Entry
                   A Random entry can be selected by using random:[PLI]. PLI is a optional parameter. It must be
                   the ID of the playlist to select entry from. If no playlist is given the current one is used.

           Random liked Entry
                   This is like normal random entry but prioritized by the  value  set  with  LIKE  and  DISLIKE
                   commands. Syntax is: randomlike:[PLI].

       $pointer
           A  Pointer.  This is a string of the pointer name. It is not prefixed with 'pointer:' as when used as
           PLE.

   <b>Common</b> <b>return</b> <b>values</b>
       The following return types are used by methods in this module:

       $rpld
           The instance of this module as returned by <b>new()</b>.

       $res
           A general return value. This is undef in case of failure or a defined value in case of no error.  The
           value may be a string, hash- or arrayref depending on the method. See description of the  method  for
           details.

       $any
           The return value of <b>any()</b>. This can be used as wildcard for playlist names in some cases.

   <b>Basic</b> <b>functions</b>
       <u>$rpld</u> <u>=</u> <u>Audio::RPLD-&gt;new([$addr[,</u> <u>$type[,</u> <u>$port]]])</u>

       This  method creates a new Audio::RPLD object. If arguments are passed they are directly passed to a call
       to the connect method (see below) in order to connect to the server. If this fails undef is returned.  If
       no  arguments are given you need to connect the object to the server via the connect method later on your
       own.

       <u>$res</u> <u>=</u> <u>$rpld-&gt;connect($addr[,</u> <u>$type[,</u> <u>$port]])</u>

       Connect to a server. You must not call this on a already connected object.

       <u>$res</u> <u>=</u> <u>$rpld-&gt;<b>connect_default()</b></u>

       Connect to a server by trying default locations. You must not call this on a already connected object.

       <u>$res</u> <u>=</u> <u>$rpld-&gt;<b>disconnect()</b></u>

       Disconnect from the server. You may use $rpld-&gt;<b>connect()</b> again to connect to a (new/different) server.

       <u>$res</u> <u>=</u> <u>$rpld-&gt;<b>is_connected()</b></u>

       Returns true value if the object is currently connected to a server or undef if not.

       <u>$res</u> <u>=</u> <u>$rpld-&gt;identify([%options])</u>

       This identifies the process at the server. An optional list of options is taken.  Each key-value pair  is
       send to the server as it is.

       Currently supported keys are: name, pid, nodename and hostid.

       This  command is send automatically at connect. You only need to call this manually if want to set one of
       those options. It is recommended to do this at least for the application name.

   <b>Special</b> <b>values</b>
       <u>$any</u> <u>=</u> <u>$rpld-&gt;<b>any()</b></u>

       This function returns a value that can be used as playlist wildcard.

   <b>Basic</b> <b>communication</b> <b>functions</b>
       <u>$res</u> <u>=</u> <u>$rpld-&gt;<b>noop()</b></u>

       Send a NOOP command to the server.

       This can be used to ping the server or for keep-alive.

   <b>Server</b> <b>information</b> <b>functions</b>
       <u>$res</u> <u>=</u> <u>$rpld-&gt;<b>serverinfo()</b></u>

       Send a SERVERINFO command to the server.

       This tells basic information about the server like it's version and location.

       The return value is a hashref which contains the following keys (all keys may or may not be set depending
       on what info the server provides):

       version
           This is the product name, version and vendor information for the server.

       location
           This is the location of the server in a lion readable way e.g. "kitchen".

       description
           This is a description for the server e.g. "Central Media Server"

       contact
           Those are information on the server administrator. Normally contains nick or real name as well as  an
           e-mail address.

       serial
           This is a string with the serial number of the device.

       address
           This contains address data of the device.

       uiurl
           This  is  an URL to a user interface used to control the server.  This can be a web interface such as
           Romie or some other kind of interface.  All  protocols  are  allowed.  This  includes  telnet://  and
           ssh:/<a href="file:/.">/.</a>

       hostid
           This is the UNIX HostID of the server.

       license
           This is the license of the server software or device.

       build
           This  is  a  build stamp. It contains information on the build.  This is mostly useful when reporting
           problems to upstream or the distributor.

       system
           This contains a sub-hash with information about the server's OS.  Those information are normally read
           via the <b>uname()</b> system call by the server software. This means all limits of <b>uname()</b>  also  apply  to
           those data.  The following keys are know as of this writing:

           sysname
               The operating system's name e.g. "NetBSD".

           release
               The operating system's release.

           nodename
               The node name of as known by the operating system.

           machine
               The host architecture as known by the operating system.

       x   This is a sub-hash with vendor specific information.  The name is based on the "X-"-prefix those keys
           have.   The  content  and format is fully up to the server software.  However the following keys have
           been seen in the wild:

           application This key is used by the RoarAudio PlayList Daemon (rpld) and contains it's name.

   <b>Storing</b> <b>and</b> <b>restoring</b>
       <u>$res</u> <u>=</u> <u>$rpld-&gt;<b>store()</b></u>

       Ask the server to store (dump) all data on permanent storage (disk). This is normally  used  at  exit  to
       save all the playlists on disk so they can be restored at next startup.

       <u>$res</u> <u>=</u> <u>$rpld-&gt;<b>restore()</b></u>

       Restore  from  disk.  This  is  normally done at startup time (by rpld itself).  You should not call this
       again if the server already restored it's state because this may result in undefined  behavior.   Current
       behavior of rpld is that it forgets the complete current state and loads the new state.  This was changed
       in  version  0.1rc7.  Before  version  0.1rc7  it  added  everything  to  the  current state resulting in
       duplicates.  This may change in future.

   <b>Playback</b> <b>control</b>
       <u>$res</u> <u>=</u> <u>$rpld-&gt;<b>play()</b></u>

       Start playback.

       <u>$res</u> <u>=</u> <u>$rpld-&gt;<b>stop()</b></u>

       Stop playback.

       <u>$res</u> <u>=</u> <u>$rpld-&gt;<b>next()</b></u>

       Skip to next song.

       <u>$res</u> <u>=</u> <u>$rpld-&gt;<b>prev()</b></u>

       Skip to previous song.

       <u>$res</u> <u>=</u> <u>$rpld-&gt;<b>isplaying()</b></u>

       Return a true value if we are currently playing.

       <u>$res</u> <u>=</u> <u>$rpld-&gt;<b>showidentifier()</b></u>

       Return a identifier for the currently running stream at the server.  The format  of  this  identifier  is
       undefined.  This should not be used.  Using this value can result in race conditions.

   <b>Queue</b> <b>control</b>
       <u>$res</u> <u>=</u> <u>$rpld-&gt;<b>flushq()</b></u>

       Flush the Main Queue. Playback is stopped (because no songs are left in the queue).

       <u>$res</u> <u>=</u> <u>$rpld-&gt;<b>showcur()</b></u>

       Return  the  Playlist  entry  for  the  current song (if playback is running this is the currently played
       song).  This contains information about this song from the playlist. If you want to read the current meta
       data or other live data use $rpld-&gt;<b>showplaying()</b>.

       The return value is in the same format  as  that  of  $rpld-&gt;<b>showple()</b>.  See  $rpld-&gt;<b>showple()</b>  for  more
       information on it.

       <u>$res</u> <u>=</u> <u>$rpld-&gt;<b>showplaying()</b></u>

       Returns live information on what is currently played.

       The return value is a hashref which contains the following keys (all keys may or may not be set depending
       on what info the server provides):

       state
           A  string  of  the  current  playback  state  in  uppercase. Possible values include: STOPPED, PAUSE,
           RUNNING.

       longgtn
           The long GTN of the current ple.

       shortgtn
           The short GTN of the current ple.

       uuid
           The UUID of the current ple.

       time
           A hash containing keys for the current playback time in different units. The unit  name  is  the  key
           name. Units may include: samples, s.

       meta
           A  hash  containing  keys  for  each meta data type provided by the server. Types may include: title,
           album, artist, performer, version.

       mduc
           The meta data update counter (MDUC) for current playback.

       rate
           The sample rate of the current playback.

       channels
           The number of channels of the current playback.

       bits
           The number of bits of the current playback.

       <u>$res</u> <u>=</u> <u>$rpld-&gt;listq([$playlist])</u>

       List playlist entries of the Main Queue or the given playlist.  This  is  the  same  as  $rpld-&gt;<b>listple()</b>
       expect that the default playlist is the Main Queue not the currently selected playlist.

       <u>$res</u> <u>=</u> <u>$rpld-&gt;showqueue([$playlist])</u>

       Returns  a  hashref  with information about the given list or the current queue if no list is given.  The
       structure of the hashref is the same as for <b>listplaylist()</b>.  This function is the same as <b>showlist()</b>  but
       returns the current queue as default of no list is given.

   <b>Volume</b> <b>control</b>
       <u>$res</u> <u>=</u> <u>$rpld-&gt;setvolume($vol)</u>

       Set volume to $vol.

       <u>$res</u> <u>=</u> <u>$rpld-&gt;<b>showvolume()</b></u>

       Return a hashref to a hash containing volume information.

       The hash contains the following keys:

       value
           The current playback volume in units of scale.

       scale
           The unit of value.

       pc  The volume in percent.

       The current volume (as float) is value/scale.

   <b>Controlling</b> <b>pause</b> <b>state</b>
       <u>$res</u> <u>=</u> <u>$rpld-&gt;<b>pause()</b></u>

       Set the playback in pause mode.

       You should not use this function but $rpld-&gt;<b>togglepause()</b> if possible.

       <u>$res</u> <u>=</u> <u>$rpld-&gt;<b>unpause()</b></u>

       Unpause the playback.

       You should not use this function but $rpld-&gt;<b>togglepause()</b> if possible.

       <u>$res</u> <u>=</u> <u>$rpld-&gt;<b>togglepause()</b></u>

       Toggle the pause state. This is the recommended function to change the pause state of playback.

       This is because it interacts best with other applications changing the current pause state.

   <b>Playlist</b> <b>management</b>
       <u>$res</u> <u>=</u> <u>$rpld-&gt;setplaylist($playlist)</u>

       Select the given playlist. After selecting a playlist it becomes the default playlist for most operations
       which  take  a optional playlist argument. (Operations for which this does not set the default are marked
       in the corresponding description).

       <u>$res</u> <u>=</u> <u>$rpld-&gt;addplaylist($name)</u>

       Add a playlist.

       <u>$res</u> <u>=</u> <u>$rpld-&gt;delplaylist($playlist)</u>

       Delete a playlist. All entries are deleted, too.

       <u>$res</u> <u>=</u> <u>$rpld-&gt;flushplaylist($playlist)</u>

       Flush a playlist. If this is used on the Main Queue the playback is stopped as no songs are left to play.

       <u>$res</u> <u>=</u> <u>$rpld-&gt;<b>listplaylist()</b></u>

       Get a list of playlists known by the server.  This returns a arrayref to a array containing a hashref for
       each list. This hash contains the following keys:

       id  The ID of the playlist.

       parent
           The ID of the parent playlist.

       name
           The name of the playlist.

       children
           A arrayref with the IDs of the children playlists.

       history_size (optional)
           The size of the history if this is a history.  This is the number of PLEs this  playlist  will  store
           before old entries becomes deleted automatically.

       history (optional)
           The PLI of the playlist used as history if this is a queue.

       volume (optional)
           The playback volume if this is a queue.

       backend (optional)
           The backend used by this queue (if this is a queue).  The backend is the name (server address) of the
           RoarAudio server.

       mixer (optional)
           The ID of the Mixer used on the RoarAudio server. -1 for default.  Only set if this is a queue.

       role (optional)
           The Stream role used by this queue. Often "music" or "background_music".  Only if this is a queue.

       Parent/child information should be used to display a tree to the user.

       <u>$res</u> <u>=</u> <u>$rpld-&gt;showlist($playlist)</u>

       Returns a hashref with information about the given playlist.  The structure of the hashref is the same as
       for <b>listplaylist()</b>.

       <u>$res</u> <u>=</u> <u>$rpld-&gt;setparentlist($playlist)</u>

       Set  the  parent  playlist of the current playlist.  Setting parent playlist of a list the current one is
       currently not supported.

   <b>Queue</b> <b>management</b>
       <u>$res</u> <u>=</u> <u>$rpld-&gt;setqueue($playlist)</u>

       Select the given playlist as queue. After selecting a queue it becomes the default queue for the  current
       connection.

       <u>$res</u> <u>=</u> <u>$rpld-&gt;delqueue($playlist)</u>

       Delete a queue from a playlist. The playlist will not be removed just the queue.

       <u>$res</u> <u>=</u> <u>$rpld-&gt;addqueue($playlist,</u> <u>$history[,</u> <u>$backend[,</u> <u>$mixer[,</u> <u>$role]]])</u>

       Add  a  queue to playlist $pl with the playlist $history as history.  Optionally the server to connect to
       can be given as $backend and the mixer to connect to as $mixer.  In addition the stream role can  be  set
       using $role.

   <b>History</b> <b>management</b>
       <u>$res</u> <u>=</u> <u>$rpld-&gt;addhistory($playlist,</u> <u>[$size])</u>

       Add  a  history  to  the playlist. The history size can be set using the optional argument $size.  If not
       given the server's default will be used.

       <u>$res</u> <u>=</u> <u>$rpld-&gt;delhistory($playlist)</u>

       Delete a history from a playlist. The playlist will not be removed just the history.

   <b>Playlist</b> <b>Entry</b> <b>management</b>
       <u>$res</u> <u>=</u> <u>$rpld-&gt;delple($ple[,</u> <u>$playlist])</u>

       Delete the given playlist entry.

       <u>$res</u> <u>=</u> <u>$rpld-&gt;queueple($ple[,</u> <u>$playlist[,</u> <u>$pos]])</u>

       Queue the given playlist entry. This means it is  copied  over  to  the  Main  Queue.  This  function  is
       recommended over $rpld-&gt;<b>copyple()</b> to queue songs.

       The  optional  position is used to give the place in the playlist where to queue the song.  It is counted
       as 'n entries after the first one'. This means if you pass a value of zero the song  is  placed  as  next
       song.  If  you  pass a value of one it is placed as the song after the next song and so on. A value of -1
       means that it is added before the first one. If you place a song before the first one in the  Main  Queue
       playback is stopped and restarted so this song becomes the currently played song.

       If  you  omit  the position or pass undef the default behavior is to add at the end of the playlist which
       should be the default in your applications, too.

       <u>$res</u> <u>=</u> <u>$rpld-&gt;copyple($ple,</u> <u>$playlist_from,</u> <u>$playlist_to[,</u> <u>$pos])</u>

       The given playlist entry is copied from the playlist $playlist_from to  the  playlist  $playlist_to.   If
       $playlist_from is undef the currently selected playlist is used as source.

       For the meaning of the position parameter ($pos) see $rpld-&gt;<b>queueple()</b> above.

       <u>$res</u> <u>=</u> <u>$rpld-&gt;moveple($ple,</u> <u>$playlist_from,</u> <u>$playlist_to[,</u> <u>$pos])</u>

       The  given  playlist  entry  is  moved from the playlist $playlist_from to the playlist $playlist_to.  If
       $playlist_from is undef the currently selected playlist is used as source.

       For the meaning of the position parameter ($pos) see $rpld-&gt;<b>queueple()</b> above.

       <u>$res</u> <u>=</u> <u>$rpld-&gt;listple($playlist)</u>

       List all playlist entries from the given playlist.  The return value is an arrayref with elements  as  if
       they are returned by $rpld-&gt;<b>showple()</b>.  See $rpld-&gt;<b>showple()</b> for more info about the return format.

       Note:  You  should avoid calling this too often as it returns a large amount of data. You also should not
       store data for currently not used playlists (for example only store data for the playlist currently shown
       to the user).

       <u>$res</u> <u>=</u> <u>$rpld-&gt;searchple($needle,</u> <u>$op,</u> <u>$src,</u> <u>[$pli,</u> <u>[$opts]])</u>

       List playlist entries matching a given rule.  The return value is the same as for $rpld-&gt;<b>listple()</b>.

       This function accepts the following arguments:

       $needle
           The needle is the search term the server will search for.  It may be a scalar value  or  a  arrayref.
           If  an arrayref the array must have one or two elements.  If the array has two elements the first one
           is the type of needle and the second is the value to search for.  The supported types depend  on  the
           server.   As  of version 0.1.5 RoarAudio PlayList Daemon supports: String types, DISCID, UUID, GENRE,
           TRACKNUM[BER].  String types are defined with a type of undef.  If it has only one element  the  type
           defaults to undef (string type).  If a scalar value is given the type is automatically selected based
           on the prefix. If a prefix is found matching one of the known types that type is selected. If no such
           prefix  is  found  the  string  is used as string type. This is handy for user interfaces with only a
           single "intelligent" search box.  For non-user input the array form is strongly recommended.

       $op This is the operator used to compare needle to the source.

           Currently the following options are defined. For negative versions see $opts.

           eq  The needle must to match the source.

           ne  The needle must not match the source.

           in  The needle is found anywhere within the source.

           begin
               The needle is found at the begin of the source.

           end The needle is found at the end of the source.

       $src
           This is the source to compare the needle with.

           This can be undef, a scalar value, $any or a arrayref.

           $any matches any information within the PLE.  If an arrayref is used the array must consist of one or
           two elements.  The first element is the source. The second is the sub-source.  Valid values depend on
           the server software.  As of version 0.1.5 RoarAudio PlayList Daemon supports: ALBUM,  TITLE,  ARTIST,
           PERFORMER,  VERSION,  FILENAME, DISCID, UUID, GENRE, TRACKNUM[BER] and TAG:"Tagname". Not all of them
           can be used with all kinds of needles.  If $src is a scalar value it is interpreted as ['TAG',  $src]
           or  [$src]  depending  on  the needle.  If this is undef the source is selected by the type of needle
           with string needles defaulting to $any.

       $pli (optional)
           This is the playlist to search in or $any.

       $opts (optional)
           This is an hashref with options. All options are optional. The following keys are currently defined:

           neg If set to a true value the search is inverted.

           casesensitive
               If set to a true value the search is done case sensetive.

           queues
               If set to true value searching in queues is allowed.  If set to a false but not undef value  such
               searches are disallowed.  If set to undef the default is used.

           histories
               Does the same as "queues" just for histories.

       <u>$res</u> <u>=</u> <u>$rpld-&gt;showple($ple[,</u> <u>$playlist])</u>

       Return data of the given playlist entry. If no playlist is given the currently selected one is used.

       The return value is a hashref with the following keys:

       codec (optional)
           The name of the used codec.

       length (optional)
           The playback length in seconds.

       file
           The  filename.  This  may be anything supported by RoarAudio's DSTR. Including local files, web radio
           streams and other types.

       meta
           The value for the meta key is a hashref of it's own to a list of provided meta data.

           The following keys may be included. All are optional. Other keys may also be included.

           album   Name of the album.

           title   Title of the song.

       shortid
           The short GTN for the entry.

       uuid (optional)
           The UUID for the entry.

       likeness (optional)
           The likeness value stored by the server.  This is a float in rage from zero to infinity.  The  bigger
           the value is the more the song is liked.

       <u>$res</u> <u>=</u> <u>$rpld-&gt;like($ple[,</u> <u>$likeness])</u>

       Tells  the  server that the user likes this entry.  Optionally tells the server how much. A value of +1.0
       is the default if no value is given.  This is added to the likeness value stored by the server.  A  value
       of  zero has no effect. A negative value indicates dislikeness.  See <b>dislike()</b> for more information about
       dislikeness.

       <u>$res</u> <u>=</u> <u>$rpld-&gt;dislike($ple[,</u> <u>$likeness])</u>

       This is the same as <b>like()</b> just marks a the given entry as disliked.  Optionally  tells  the  server  how
       much.  A value of +1.0 is the default if no value is given.  The value is subtracted from server's value.
       A value of zero has no effect. A negative value indicates likeness.   See  <b>like()</b>  for  more  information
       about likeness.

   <b>Pointers</b>
       <u>$res</u> <u>=</u> <u>$rpld-&gt;setpointer($pointer,</u> <u>$ple[,</u> <u>$playlist])</u>

       Set  the given pointer to the given playlist entry. If no playlist is given the currently selected one is
       used.

       <u>$res</u> <u>=</u> <u>$rpld-&gt;unsetpointer($pointer)</u>

       Unset the given pointer.

       <u>$res</u> <u>=</u> <u>$rpld-&gt;showpointer([$pointer])</u>

       Returns information about the given or all pointers.

       The return value is a hashref with keys of the pointer names.  The values for those keys  are  a  hashref
       containing  information  on  the corresponding pointer.  If the hashref for the pointer points to a empty
       hash (no keys defined) then the pointer is not defined.

       If the pointer is defined the following keys are contained:

       raw The playlist entry the pointer points to in a raw format.

       longid (optional)
           If the pointer contains an information about the playlist entries long GTN this GTN.

       shortid (optional)
           If the pointer contains an information about the playlist entries short GTN this GTN.

       uuid (optional)
           If the pointer contains an information about the playlist entries UUID this UUID.

       random (optional)
           If the pointer points to a random song within a  playlist  this  contains  the  corresponding  search
           string.

       randomlike (optional)
           If  the  pointer  points  to  a random song (respecting likeness) within a playlist this contains the
           corresponding search string.

       playlist (optional)
           If the pointer contains a playlist hint this contains the playlist ID.

   <b>Clients</b>
       <u>$res</u> <u>=</u> <u>$rpld-&gt;<b>listclients()</b></u>

       Get a list of clients connected to the server.  This returns a arrayref to a array containing  a  hashref
       for each client. This hash contains the following keys:

       id  The ID of the client.

       name
           The name of the client.

       protocol
