</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       SDL_OpenAudioDevice - Open a specific audio device.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;SDL3/SDL_audio.h&gt;</b>

       <b>SDL_AudioDeviceID</b> <b>SDL_OpenAudioDevice(SDL_AudioDeviceID</b> <b>devid,</b> <b>const</b> <b>SDL_AudioSpec</b> <b>*spec);</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       You  can  open both playback and recording devices through this function. Playback devices will take data
       from bound audio streams, mix it, and send it to the hardware. Recording  devices  will  feed  any  bound
       audio streams with a copy of any incoming data.

       An  opened audio device starts out with no audio streams bound. To start audio playing, bind a stream and
       supply audio data to it. Unlike SDL2, there is no audio callback; you only bind audio  streams  and  make
       sure they have data flowing into them (however, you can simulate SDL2's semantics fairly closely by using
       <b>SDL_OpenAudioDeviceStream</b> instead of this function).

       If    you    don't    care    about    opening    a   specific   device,   pass   a   <b>devid</b>   of   either
       <b>SDL_AUDIO_DEVICE_DEFAULT_PLAYBACK</b> or <b>SDL_AUDIO_DEVICE_DEFAULT_RECORDING</b>.  In this case, SDL will  try  to
       pick  the  most reasonable default, and may also switch between physical devices seamlessly later, if the
       most reasonable default changes during the lifetime of this opened device (user changed  the  default  in
       the  OS's  system  preferences, the default got unplugged so the system jumped to a new default, the user
       plugged in headphones on a mobile device, etc). Unless you have  a  good  reason  to  choose  a  specific
       device, this is probably what you want.

       You  may  request  a  specific format for the audio device, but there is no promise the device will honor
       that request for several reasons. As such, it's only meant to be a hint as to what  data  your  app  will
       provide.  Audio  streams will accept data in whatever format you specify and manage conversion for you as
       appropriate.  <b>SDL_GetAudioDeviceFormat</b> can tell you the preferred format for the  device  before  opening
       and the actual format the device is using after opening.

       It's  legal  to  open the same device ID more than once; each successful open will generate a new logical
       <b>SDL_AudioDeviceID</b> that is managed separately from  others  on  the  same  physical  device.  This  allows
       libraries to open a device separately from the main app and bind its own streams without conflicting.

       It  is also legal to open a device ID returned by a previous call to this function; doing so just creates
       another logical device on the same physical device. This may be useful for making  logical  groupings  of
       audio streams.

       This  function  returns  the  opened  device  ID on success. This is a new, unique <b>SDL_AudioDeviceID</b> that
       represents a logical device.

       Some backends might offer arbitrary devices (for example, a networked audio protocol that can connect  to
       an  arbitrary  server).  For these, as a change from SDL2, you should open a default device ID and use an
       SDL hint to specify the target if you care, or otherwise let the backend figure out a reasonable default.
       Most backends don't offer anything like this, and often this would be an end user setting an  environment
       variable for their custom need, and not something an application should specifically manage.

       When   done   with   an  audio  device,  possibly  at  the  end  of  the  app's  life,  one  should  call
       <b>SDL_CloseAudioDevice</b>() on the returned device id.

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTION</b> <b>PARAMETERS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>devid</u>  the    device    instance    id    to    open,     or     <b>SDL_AUDIO_DEVICE_DEFAULT_PLAYBACK</b>     or
              <b>SDL_AUDIO_DEVICE_DEFAULT_RECORDING</b> for the most reasonable default device.

       <u>spec</u>   the requested device configuration. Can be NULL to use reasonable defaults.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       Returns the device ID on success or 0 on failure; call <b>SDL_GetError</b>() for more information.

</pre><h4><b>THREAD</b> <b>SAFETY</b></h4><pre>
       It is safe to call this function from any thread.

</pre><h4><b>AVAILABILITY</b></h4><pre>
       This function is available since SDL 3.2.0.
