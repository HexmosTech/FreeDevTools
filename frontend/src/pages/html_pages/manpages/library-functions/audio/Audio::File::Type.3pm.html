</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Audio::File::Type - represents an audio filetype

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       An instance of an object inherited from Audio::File::Type is returned by the constructor of Audio::File.
       This object currently provides access to the audio files information like its audio properties (bitrate,
       sample rate, number of channels, ...) and the data stored in the files tag, but also providing access to
       the raw audio data and other information should be easy to be implemented.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>new</b>
       Constructor. In fact you don't need to use it. Please use Audio::File which will call the appropriate
       constructor corresponding to the files type.

   <b>init</b>
       This method will be called by the constructor. It's empty by default and should be overwritten by
       inheriting subclasses to initialize themselfes.

   <b>name</b>
       Returns the name of the audio file.

   <b>is_readable</b>
       Checks whether the file is readable or not. At the moment it's only used by the constructor, but it will
       be more useful with later versions of Audio::File.

   <b>is_writeable</b>
       Checks whether the file is writeable or not. At the moment you'll probably don't need to call this
       method, but it'll be more useful as soon as changing the audio file is implemented.

   <b>tag</b>
       Returns a reference to the files tag object. See the documentation of Audio::File::Tag to learn about
       what the tag object does.

   <b>audio_properties</b>
       Returns a reference to the files audio properties object. See the documentation of
       Audio::File::AudioProperties to get information about what the audio properties object does.

   <b>save</b>
       Saves the audio file. This is not yet implemented but it should remember me to do it at some time.. :-)

   <b>type</b>
       Returns the files type.

</pre><h4><b>TODO</b></h4><pre>
       implement changing the file

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
