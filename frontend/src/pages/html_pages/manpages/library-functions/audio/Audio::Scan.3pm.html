       Audio::Scan - Fast C metadata and tag reader for all common audio file formats

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Audio::Scan;

           my $data = Audio::Scan-&gt;scan('/path/to/file.mp3');

           # Just file info
           my $info = Audio::Scan-&gt;scan_info('/path/to/file.mp3');

           # Just tags
           my $tags = Audio::Scan-&gt;scan_tags('/path/to/file.mp3');

           # Scan without reading (possibly large) artwork into memory.
           # Instead of binary artwork data, the size of the artwork will be returned instead.
           {
               local $ENV{AUDIO_SCAN_NO_ARTWORK} = 1;
               my $data = Audio::Scan-&gt;scan('/path/to/file.mp3');
           }

           # Scan a filehandle
           open my $fh, '&lt;', 'my.mp3';
           my $data = Audio::Scan-&gt;scan_fh( mp3 =&gt; $fh );
           close $fh;

           # Scan and compute an audio MD5 checksum
           my $data = Audio::Scan-&gt;scan( '/path/to/file.mp3', { md5_size =&gt; 100 * 1024 } );
           my $md5 = $data-&gt;{info}-&gt;{audio_md5};

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Audio::Scan is a C-based scanner for audio file metadata and tag information. It currently supports MP3,
       MP4, Ogg Vorbis, FLAC, ASF, WAV, AIFF, Musepack, Monkey's Audio, and WavPack.

       See below for specific details about each file format.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>scan(</b> <b>$path,</b> <b>[</b> <b>\%OPTIONS</b> <b>]</b> <b>)</b>
       Scans $path for both metadata and tag information.  The type of scan performed is determined by the
       file's extension.  Supported extensions are:

           MP3:  mp3, mp2
           MP4:  mp4, m4a, m4b, m4p, m4v, m4r, k3g, skm, 3gp, 3g2, mov
           AAC (ADTS): aac
           Ogg:  ogg, oga
           FLAC: flc, flac, fla
           ASF:  wma, wmv, asf
           Musepack:  mpc, mpp, mp+
           Monkey's Audio:  ape, apl
           WAV: wav
           AIFF: aiff, aif
           WavPack: wv

       This method returns a hashref containing two other hashrefs: info and tags.  The contents of the info and
       tag hashes vary depending on file format, see below for details.

       An optional hashref may be provided with the following values:

           md5_size =&gt; $audio_bytes_to_checksum

       An MD5 will be computed of the first N audio bytes. Any tags in the file are automatically skipped, so
       this is a useful way of determining if a file's audio content is the same even if tags may have been
       changed.  The hex MD5 value is returned in the $info-&gt;{audio_md5} key.  This option will reduce
       performance, so choose a small enough size that works for you, you should probably avoid using more than
       64K for example.

       For FLAC files that already contain an MD5 checksum, this value will be used instead of calculating a new
       one.

           md5_offset =&gt; $offset

       Begin computing the audio_md5 value starting at $offset.  If this value is not specified, $offset
       defaults to a point in the middle of the file.

   <b>scan_info(</b> <b>$path,</b> <b>[</b> <b>\%OPTIONS</b> <b>]</b> <b>)</b>
       If you only need file metadata and don't care about tags, you can use this method.

   <b>scan_tags(</b> <b>$path,</b> <b>[</b> <b>\%OPTIONS</b> <b>]</b> <b>)</b>
       If you only need the tags and don't care about the metadata, use this method.

   <b>scan_fh(</b> <b>$type</b> <b>=&gt;</b> <b>$fh,</b> <b>[</b> <b>\%OPTIONS</b> <b>]</b> <b>)</b>
       Scans a filehandle. $type is the type of file to scan as, i.e. "mp3" or "ogg".  Note that FLAC does not
       support reading from a filehandle.

   <b>find_frame(</b> <b>$path,</b> <b>$timestamp_in_ms</b> <b>)</b>
       Returns the byte offset to the first audio frame starting from the given timestamp (in milliseconds).

       MP3, Ogg, FLAC, ASF, MP4
           The  byte offset to the data packet containing this timestamp will be returned. For file formats that
           don't provide timestamp information such as MP3, the best estimate for the location of the  timestamp
           will be returned.  This will be more accurate if the file has a Xing header or is CBR for example.

       WAV, AIFF, Musepack, Monkey's Audio, WavPack
           Not yet supported by find_frame.

   <b>find_frame_return_info(</b> <b>$mp4_path,</b> <b>$timestamp_in_ms</b> <b>)</b>
       The  header  of  an  MP4  file  contains various metadata that refers to the structure of the audio data,
       making seeking more difficult to perform. This method will return the usual $info hash with 2  additional
       keys:

           seek_offset - The seek offset in bytes
           seek_header - A rewritten MP4 header that can be prepended to the audio data
                         found at seek_offset to construct a valid bitstream. Specifically,
                         the following boxes are rewritten: stts, stsc, stsz, stco

       For example, to seek 30 seconds into a file and write out a new MP4 file seeked to this point:

           my $info = Audio::Scan-&gt;find_frame_return_info( $file, 30000 );

           open my $f, '&lt;', $file;
           sysseek $f, $info-&gt;{seek_offset}, 1;

           open my $fh, '&gt;', 'seeked.m4a';
           print $fh $info-&gt;{seek_header};

           while ( sysread( $f, my $buf, 65536 ) ) {
               print $fh $buf;
           }

           close $f;
           close $fh;

   <b>find_frame_fh(</b> <b>$type</b> <b>=&gt;</b> <b>$fh,</b> <b>$offset</b> <b>)</b>
       Same as "find_frame", but with a filehandle.

   <b>find_frame_fh_return_info(</b> <b>$type</b> <b>=&gt;</b> <b>$fh,</b> <b>$offset</b> <b>)</b>
       Same as "find_frame_return_info", but with a filehandle.

   <b>has_flac()</b>
       Deprecated.  Always returns 1 now that FLAC is always enabled.

   <b>is_supported(</b> <b>$path</b> <b>)</b>
       Returns 1 if the given path can be scanned by Audio::Scan, or 0 if not.

   <b>get_types()</b>
       Returns an array of strings of the file types supported by Audio::Scan.

   <b>extensions_for(</b> <b>$type</b> <b>)</b>
       Returns an array of strings of the file extensions that are considered to be the file type <u>$type</u>.

   <b>type_for(</b> <b>$extension</b> <b>)</b>
       Returns file type for a given extension. Returns <u>undef</u> for unsupported extensions.

</pre><h4><b>SKIPPING</b> <b>ARTWORK</b></h4><pre>
       To  save  memory while reading tags, you can opt to skip potentially large embedded artwork.  To do this,
       set the environment variable AUDIO_SCAN_NO_ARTWORK:

           local $ENV{AUDIO_SCAN_NO_ARTWORK} = 1;
           my $tags = Audio::Scan-&gt;scan_tags($file);

       This will return the length of the embedded artwork instead of the actual image data.  In some  cases  it
       will  also  return  a  byte  offset  to the image data, which can be used to extract the image using more
       efficient means.  Note that the offset is not always returned so if you want to use this data  make  sure
       to check for offset.  If offset is not present, the only way to get the image data is to perform a normal
       tag scan without the environment variable set.

       One  limitation  that  currently exists is that memory for embedded images is still allocated for ASF and
       Ogg Vorbis files.

       This information is returned in different ways depending on the format:

       ID3 (MP3, AAC, WAV, AIFF):

           $tags-&gt;{APIC}-&gt;[3]: image length
           $tags-&gt;{APIC}-&gt;[4]: image offset (unless APIC would need unsynchronization)

       MP4:

           $tags-&gt;{COVR}: image length
           $tags-&gt;{COVR_offset}: image offset (always available)

       Ogg Vorbis:

           $tags-&gt;{ALLPICTURES}-&gt;[0]-&gt;{image_data}: image length
           Image offset is not supported with Vorbis because the data is always base64-encoded.

       FLAC:

           $tags-&gt;{ALLPICTURES}-&gt;[0]-&gt;{image_data}: image length
           $tags-&gt;{ALLPICTURES}-&gt;[0]-&gt;{offset}: image offset (always available)

       ASF:

           $tags-&gt;{'WM/Picture'}-&gt;{image}: image length
           $tags-&gt;{'WM/Picture'}-&gt;{offset}: image offset (always available)

       APE, Musepack, WavPack, MP3 with APEv2:

           $tags-&gt;{'COVER ART (FRONT)'}: image length
           $tags-&gt;{'COVER ART (FRONT)_offset'}: image offset (always available)

   <b>TAGS</b>
       Raw tags are returned as found.  This means older tags such as ID3v1 and ID3v2.2/v2.3  are  converted  to
       ID3v2.4  tag names.  Multiple instances of a tag in a file will be returned as arrays.  Complex tags such
       as APIC and COMM are returned as arrays.  All tag fields  are  converted  to  upper-case.   All  text  is
       converted to UTF-8.

</pre><h4><b>THANKS</b></h4><pre>
       Logitech &amp; Slim Devices, for letting us release so much of our code to the world.  Long live Squeezebox!

       Kimmo Taskinen, Adrian Smith, Clive Messer, and Jurgen Kramer for DSF/DSDIFF support  and  various  other
       fixes.

       Some code from the Rockbox project was very helpful in implementing ASF and MP4 seeking.

       Some  of  the file format parsing code was derived from the mt-daapd project, and adapted by Netgear.  It
       has been heavily rewritten to fix bugs and add more features.

       The   source   to   the   original   Netgear   C   scanner    for    SqueezeCenter    is    located    at
       &lt;<a href="http://svn.slimdevices.com/repos/slim/7.3/trunk/platforms/readynas/contrib/scanner">http://svn.slimdevices.com/repos/slim/7.3/trunk/platforms/readynas/contrib/scanner</a>&gt;
