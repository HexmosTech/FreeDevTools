       Audio::File - Audio file abstraction library

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Audio::File;
         my $file = Audio::File-&gt;new( "foo.bar" );

         print "The ". $file-&gt;type() ."-file ". $file-&gt;name
                       ." is ". int $file-&gt;audio_properties-&gt;length() ." seconds long.\n";

         print "It's interpreted by ". $file-&gt;tag-&gt;artist()
                       ." and called ". $file-&gt;tag-&gt;title() ".\n";

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Audio::File abstracts a single audio file, independent of its format. Using this module you can access a
       files meta-info like title, album, etc. as well as the file's audio properties like its length and
       bitrate.

       Currently only the formats flac, ogg vorbis and mp3 are supported, but support for other formats may be
       easily added.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>new</b>
         $file = Audio::File-&gt;new( "foobar.flac" );

       Constructor. It takes the filename of the your audio file as its only argument and returns an instance of
       Audio::File::${Type} if the corresponding file type is supported. The file type will be determined using
       the file extension.  Currently flac, ogg and mp3 are supported but new formats may be added easily by
       creating a Audio::File::${Type} that inherits from Audio::File::Type, which is the base class for all
       file type classes.

       The methods and behaviour of the returned are documented in Audio::File::Type.

</pre><h4><b>TODO</b></h4><pre>
       •   Add possibility to change file and its tags.

       •   better (easier) interface?

       •   user shouldn't be forced to use Audio::File if he only wants the files tag or audio properties.

       •   Add possibility to access raw audio data (Audio::File::Data)

           That could be done via Audio::Data or equivalent.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       Audio::File::Type, Audio::File::Tag, Audio::File::AudioProperties
