</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Audio::MPD::Common::Item::Song - a song object with some audio tags

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 2.003

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Audio::MPD::Common::Item::Song is more a placeholder with some attributes. Those attributes are taken
       from the song tags, so some of them can be empty depending on the file.

       The constructor should only be called by Audio::MPD::Common::Item's constructor.

</pre><h4><b>ATTRIBUTES</b></h4><pre>

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>as_string</b>
           my $str = $song-&gt;as_string( [$format] );

       Return a string representing $song. If $format is specified, use it to format the string. Otherwise, the
       string returned will be:

       either "album = track = artist = title"
       or "artist = title"
       or "title"
       or "file"

       (in this order), depending on the existing tags of the song. The last possibility always exist of course,
       since it's a path.

       This method is also used to automatically stringify the $song.

       <b>WARNING:</b> the format codes are not yet definitive and may be subject to change!
