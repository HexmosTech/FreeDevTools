       It's called by the filetype-dependant subclasses of Audio::File::Type automatically.

   <b>init</b>
       Initializes the object. It's called by the constructor and empty by default.  It's ought to be
       overwritten by subclasses.

   <b>length</b>
       Returns the length of the audio file in seconds.

   <b>bitrate</b>
       Returns the bitrate of the file.

   <b>sample_rate</b>
