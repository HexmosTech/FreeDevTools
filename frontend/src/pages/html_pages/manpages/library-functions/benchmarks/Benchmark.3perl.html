       Benchmark - benchmark running times of Perl code

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Benchmark qw(:all) ;

           timethis ($count, "code");

           # Use Perl code in strings...
           timethese($count, {
               'Name1' =&gt; '...code1...',
               'Name2' =&gt; '...code2...',
           });

           # ... or use subroutine references.
           timethese($count, {
               'Name1' =&gt; sub { ...code1... },
               'Name2' =&gt; sub { ...code2... },
           });

           # cmpthese can be used both ways as well

               'Name2' =&gt; '...code2...',
           });

           cmpthese($count, {
               'Name1' =&gt; sub { ...code1... },
               'Name2' =&gt; sub { ...code2... },
           });

           # ...or in two stages
           $results = timethese($count,
               {
                   'Name1' =&gt; sub { ...code1... },
                   'Name2' =&gt; sub { ...code2... },
               },
               'none'
           );
           cmpthese( $results ) ;

           $t = timeit($count, '...other code...')
           print "$count loops of other code took:",timestr($t),"\n";

           $t = countit($time, '...other code...')
           $count = $t-&gt;iters ;
           print "$count loops of other code took:",timestr($t),"\n";

           # enable hires wallclock timing if possible
           use Benchmark ':hireswallclock';

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The Benchmark module encapsulates a number of routines to help you figure out how long it takes to
       execute some code.

       timethis - run a chunk of code several times

       timethese - run several chunks of code several times

       cmpthese - print results of timethese as a comparison chart

       timeit - run a chunk of code and see how long it goes

       countit - see how many times a chunk of code runs in a given time

   <b>Methods</b>
       new       Returns the current time.   Example:

                     use Benchmark;
                     $t0 = Benchmark-&gt;new;
                     # ... your code here ...
                     $t1 = Benchmark-&gt;new;
                     $td = timediff($t1, $t0);
                     print "the code took:",timestr($td),"\n";

       debug     Enables or disable debugging by setting the $Benchmark::Debug flag:

                     Benchmark-&gt;<a href="../man1/debug.1.html">debug</a>(1);
                     $t = timeit(10, ' 5 ** $Global ');
                     Benchmark-&gt;<a href="../man0/debug.0.html">debug</a>(0);

       iters     Returns the number of iterations.

   <b>Standard</b> <b>Exports</b>
       The following routines will be exported into your namespace if you use the Benchmark module:

       timeit(COUNT, CODE)
                 Arguments: COUNT is the number of times to run the loop, and CODE is the code to run.  CODE may
                 be  either a code reference or a string to be eval'd; either way it will be run in the caller's
                 package.

                 Returns: a Benchmark object.

       timethis ( COUNT, CODE, [ TITLE, [ STYLE ]] )
                 Time COUNT iterations of CODE. CODE may be a string to eval or a code reference; either way the
                 CODE will run in the caller's package.  Results will be printed to STDOUT as TITLE followed  by
                 the times.  TITLE defaults to "timethis COUNT" if none is provided. STYLE determines the format
                 of the output, as described for <b>timestr()</b> below.

                 The COUNT can be zero or negative: this means the <u>minimum</u> <u>number</u> <u>of</u> <u>CPU</u> <u>seconds</u> to run.  A zero
                 signifies the default of 3 seconds.  For example to run at least for 10 seconds:

                         timethis(-10, $code)

                 or to run two pieces of code tests for at least 3 seconds:

                         timethese(0, { test1 =&gt; '...', test2 =&gt; '...'})

                 CPU  seconds  is,  in  UNIX terms, the user time plus the system time of the process itself, as
                 opposed to the real (wallclock) time and the time spent by the child processes.  Less than  0.1
                 seconds  is  not  accepted  (-0.01  as  the  count,  for  example,  will  cause a fatal runtime
                 exception).

                 Note that the CPU seconds is the <b>minimum</b>  time:  CPU  scheduling  and  other  operating  system
                 factors  may  complicate  the  attempt  so that a little bit more time is spent.  The benchmark
                 output will, however, also tell the number  of  $code  runs/second,  which  should  be  a  more
                 interesting number than the actually spent seconds.

                 Returns a Benchmark object.

       timethese ( COUNT, CODEHASHREF, [ STYLE ] )
                 The  CODEHASHREF  is a reference to a hash containing names as keys and either a string to eval
                 or a code reference for each value.  For each  (KEY,  VALUE)  pair  in  the  CODEHASHREF,  this
                 routine will call

                         timethis(COUNT, VALUE, KEY, STYLE)

                 The routines are called in string comparison order of KEY.

                 The COUNT can be zero or negative, see <b>timethis()</b>.

                 Returns a hash reference of Benchmark objects, keyed by name.

       timediff ( T1, T2 )
                 Returns  the  difference between two Benchmark times as a Benchmark object suitable for passing
                 to <b>timestr()</b>.

       timestr ( TIMEDIFF, [ STYLE, [ FORMAT ] ] )
                 Returns a string that formats the times in the TIMEDIFF object in the requested STYLE. TIMEDIFF
                 is expected to be a Benchmark object similar to that returned by <b>timediff()</b>.

                 STYLE can be any of 'all', 'none', 'noc', 'nop' or 'auto'. 'all' shows  each  of  the  5  times
                 available  ('wallclock' time, user time, system time, user time of children, and system time of
                 children). 'noc' shows all except the two children times. 'nop' shows only  wallclock  and  the
                 two  children  times. 'auto' (the default) will act as 'all' unless the children times are both
                 zero, in which case it acts as 'noc'.  'none' prevents output.

                 FORMAT is the <b><a href="../man3/printf.3.html">printf</a></b>(3)-style format specifier (without the leading '%') to use  to  print  the
                 times. It defaults to '5.2f'.

   <b>Optional</b> <b>Exports</b>
       The  following  routines  will  be  exported  into  your  namespace  if you specifically ask that they be
       imported:

       clearcache ( COUNT )
                 Clear the cached time for COUNT rounds of the null loop.

       clearallcache ( )
                 Clear all cached times.

       cmpthese ( COUNT, CODEHASHREF, [ STYLE ] )
       cmpthese ( RESULTSHASHREF, [ STYLE ] )
                 Optionally calls <b>timethese()</b>, then outputs comparison chart.  This:

                     cmpthese( -1, { a =&gt; "++\$i", b =&gt; "\$i *= 2" } ) ;

                 outputs a chart like:

                            Rate    b    a
                     b 2831802/s   -- -61%
                     a 7208959/s 155%   --

                 This chart is sorted from slowest to fastest, and shows the percent  speed  difference  between
                 each pair of tests.

                 "cmpthese" can also be passed the data structure that <b>timethese()</b> returns:

                     $results = timethese( -1,
                         { a =&gt; "++\$i", b =&gt; "\$i *= 2" } ) ;
                     cmpthese( $results );

                 in  case  you  want  to  see  both sets of results.  If the first argument is an unblessed hash
                 reference, that is RESULTSHASHREF; otherwise that is COUNT.

                 Returns a reference to an ARRAY of rows, each row is an ARRAY of cells from  the  above  chart,
                 including labels. This:

                     my $rows = cmpthese( -1,
                         { a =&gt; '++$i', b =&gt; '$i *= 2' }, "none" );

                 returns a data structure like:

                     [
                         [ '',       'Rate',   'b',    'a' ],
                         [ 'b', '2885232/s',  '--', '-59%' ],
                         [ 'a', '7099126/s', '146%',  '--' ],
                     ]

                 <b>NOTE</b>:  This  result value differs from previous versions, which returned the timethese() result
                 structure.  If you want that, just use the two statement "timethese"..."cmpthese"  idiom  shown
                 above.

                 Incidentally,  note the variance in the result values between the two examples; this is typical
                 of benchmarking.  If this were a real benchmark, you would probably want  to  run  a  lot  more
                 iterations.

       countit(TIME, CODE)
                 Arguments:  TIME  is  the  minimum length of time to run CODE for, and CODE is the code to run.
                 CODE may be either a code reference or a string to be eval'd; either way it will be run in  the
                 caller's package.

                 TIME  is  <u>not</u>  negative.  <b>countit()</b> will run the loop many times to calculate the speed of CODE
                 before running it for TIME.  The actual time run for will usually be greater than TIME  due  to
                 system  clock resolution, so it's best to look at the number of iterations divided by the times
                 that you are concerned with, not just the iterations.

                 Returns: a Benchmark object.

       disablecache ( )
                 Disable caching of timings for the null loop. This will force Benchmark  to  recalculate  these
                 timings for each new piece of code timed.

       enablecache ( )
                 Enable  caching  of timings for the null loop. The time taken for COUNT rounds of the null loop
                 will be calculated only once for each different COUNT used.

       timesum ( T1, T2 )
                 Returns the sum of two Benchmark times as a Benchmark object suitable for passing to <b>timestr()</b>.

   <b>:hireswallclock</b>
       If the Time::HiRes module has been installed, you can  specify  the  special  tag  ":hireswallclock"  for
       Benchmark  (if  Time::HiRes is not available, the tag will be silently ignored).  This tag will cause the
       wallclock time to be measured in microseconds, instead of integer seconds.  Note though  that  the  speed
       computations are still conducted in CPU time, not wallclock time.

</pre><h4><b>Benchmark</b> <b>Object</b></h4><pre>
       Many  of  the  functions  in  this  module  return  a  Benchmark object, or in the case of timethese(), a
       reference to a hash, the values of which are Benchmark objects.  This is useful if you want to  store  or
       further process results from Benchmark functions.

       Internally  the  Benchmark object holds timing values, described in "NOTES" below.  The following methods
       can be used to access them:

       cpu_p
           Total CPU (User + System) of the main (parent) process.

       cpu_c
           Total CPU (User + System) of any children processes.

       cpu_a
           Total CPU of parent and any children processes.

       real
           Real elapsed time "wallclock seconds".

       iters
           Number of iterations run.

       The following illustrates use of the Benchmark object:

           $result = timethis(100000, sub { ... });
           print "total CPU = ", $result-&gt;cpu_a, "\n";

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       The data is stored as a list of values from the time and times functions:

             ($real, $user, $system, $children_user, $children_system, $iters)

       in seconds for the whole loop (not divided by the number of rounds).

       The timing is done using <b><a href="../man3/time.3.html">time</a></b>(3) and <b><a href="../man3/times.3.html">times</a></b>(3).

       Code is executed in the caller's package.

       The time of the null loop (a loop with the same number of rounds but empty loop body) is subtracted  from
       the time of the real loop.

       The  null  loop  times  can  be cached, the key being the number of rounds. The caching can be controlled
       using calls like these:

           clearcache($key);
           clearallcache();

           disablecache();
           enablecache();

       Caching is off by default, as it can (usually slightly) decrease accuracy and does not usually noticeably
       affect runtimes.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       For example,

           use Benchmark qw( cmpthese ) ;
           $x = 3;
           cmpthese( -5, {
               a =&gt; sub{$x*$x},
               b =&gt; sub{$x**2},
           } );

       outputs something like this:

          Benchmark: running a, b, each for at least 5 CPU seconds...
                 Rate    b    a
          b 1559428/s   -- -62%
          a 4152037/s 166%   --

       while

           use Benchmark qw( timethese cmpthese ) ;
           $x = 3;
           $r = timethese( -5, {
               a =&gt; sub{$x*$x},
               b =&gt; sub{$x**2},
           } );
           cmpthese $r;

       outputs something like this:

           Benchmark: running a, b, each for at least 5 CPU seconds...
                    a: 10 wallclock secs ( 5.14 usr +  0.13 sys =  5.27 CPU) @ 3835055.60/s (n=20210743)
                    b:  5 wallclock secs ( 5.41 usr +  0.00 sys =  5.41 CPU) @ 1574944.92/s (n=8520452)
                  Rate    b    a
           b 1574945/s   -- -59%
           a 3835056/s 144%   --

</pre><h4><b>INHERITANCE</b></h4><pre>
       Benchmark inherits from no other class, except of course from Exporter.

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
       Comparing eval'd strings with code references will give you inaccurate results:  a  code  reference  will
       show a slightly slower execution time than the equivalent eval'd string.

       The real time timing is done using <b><a href="../man2/time.2.html">time</a></b>(2) and the granularity is therefore only one second.

       Short tests may produce negative figures because perl can appear to take longer to execute the empty loop
       than a short test; try:

           timethis(100,'1');

       The  system time of the null loop might be slightly more than the system time of the loop with the actual
       code and therefore the difference might end up being &lt; 0.

</pre><h4><b>MODIFICATION</b> <b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       September 8th, 1994; by Tim Bunce.

       March 28th, 1997; by Hugo van der Sanden: added support for code references and  the  already  documented
       'debug' method; revamped documentation.

       April 04-07th, 1997: by Jarkko Hietaniemi, added the run-for-some-time functionality.

       September,  1999;  by Barrie Slaymaker: math fixes and accuracy and efficiency tweaks.  Added <b>cmpthese()</b>.
       A result is now returned from <b>timethese()</b>.  Exposed <b>countit()</b> (was <b>runfor()</b>).

       December, 2001; by Nicholas Clark: make <b>timestr()</b> recognise the style 'none' and return an empty  string.
       If  cmpthese is calling timethese, make it pass the style in. (so that 'none' will suppress output). Make
       sub new dump its debugging output to STDERR, to be consistent with everything else.  All bugs found while
       writing a regression test.

       September, 2002; by Jarkko Hietaniemi: add ':hireswallclock' special tag.

       February, 2004; by Chia-liang Kao: make cmpthese and timestr use time statistics for children instead  of
       parent when the style is 'nop'.

       November,  2007;  by  Christophe Grosjean: make cmpthese and timestr compute time consistently with style
       argument, default is 'all' not 'noc' any more.
