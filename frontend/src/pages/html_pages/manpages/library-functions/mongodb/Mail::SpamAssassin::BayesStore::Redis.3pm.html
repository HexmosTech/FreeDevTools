       Mail::SpamAssassin::BayesStore::Redis - Redis Bayesian Storage Module Implementation

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module implements a Redis based bayesian storage module.

       Apache SpamAssassin v3.4.0 introduces support for keeping a Bayes database on a Redis server, either
       running locally, or accessed over network. Similar to SQL backends, the database may be concurrently used
       by several hosts running SpamAssassin.

       The current implementation only supports a global Bayes database, i.e.  per-recipient sub-databases are
       not supported. The Redis 2.6.* server supports access over IPv4 or over a Unix socket, starting with
       Redis version 2.8.0 also IPv6 is supported. Bear in mind that Redis server only offers limited access
       controls, so it is advisable to let the Redis server bind to a loopback interface only, or to use other
       mechanisms to limit access, such as local firewall rules.

       The Redis backend for Bayes can put a Lua scripting support in a Redis server to good use, improving
       performance. The Lua support is available in Redis server since version 2.6.  In absence of a Lua
       support, the Redis backend uses batched (pipelined) traditional Redis commands, so it should work with a
       Redis server version 2.4 (untested), although this is not recommended for busy sites.

       Expiration of token and 'seen' message id entries is left to the Redis server. There is no provision for
       manually expiring a database, so it is highly recommended to leave the setting bayes_auto_expire to its
       default value 1 (i.e. enabled).

       Example configuration:

         bayes_store_module  Mail::SpamAssassin::BayesStore::Redis
         bayes_sql_dsn       server=127.0.0.1:6379;password=foo;database=2
         bayes_token_ttl 21d
         bayes_seen_ttl   8d
         bayes_auto_expire 1

       A redis server with a Lua support (2.6 or higher) is recommended for performance reasons.

       The bayes_sql_dsn config variable has been hijacked for our purposes:

         bayes_sql_dsn

           Optional config parameters affecting a connection to a redis server.

           This is a semicolon-separated list of option=value pairs, where an option
           can be: server, password, database. Unrecognized options are silently
           ignored.

           The 'server' option specifies a socket on which a redis server is
           listening. It can be an absolute path of a Unix socket, or a host:port
           pair, where a host can be an IPv4 or IPv6 address or a host name.
           An IPv6 address must be enclosed in brackets, e.g. [::1]:6379
           (IPv6 support in a redis server is available since version 2.8.0).
           A default is to connect to an INET socket at 127.0.0.1, port 6379.

           The value of a 'password' option is sent in an AUTH command to a redis
           server on connecting if a server requests authentication. A password is
           sent in plain text and a redis server only offers an optional rudimentary
           authentication. To limit access to a redis server use its 'bind' option
           to bind to a specific interface (typically to a loopback interface),
           or use a host-based firewall.

           The value of a 'database' option can be an non-negative (small) integer,
           which is passed to a redis server with a SELECT command on connecting,
           and chooses a sub-database index. A default database index is 0.

           Example: server=localhost:6379;password=foo;database=2

         bayes_token_ttl

           Controls token expiry (ttl value in SECONDS, sent as-is to Redis)
           when bayes_auto_expire is true. Default value is 3 weeks (but check
           Mail::SpamAssassin::Conf.pm to make sure).

         bayes_seen_ttl

           Controls 'seen' expiry (ttl value in SECONDS, sent as-is to Redis)
           when bayes_auto_expire is true. Default value is 8 days (but check
           Mail::SpamAssassin::Conf.pm to make sure).

       Expiry is done internally in Redis using *_ttl settings mentioned above, but only if bayes_auto_expire is
       true (which is a default).  This is why --force-expire etc does nothing, and token counts and atime
       values are shown as zero in statistics.

       LIMITATIONS: Only global bayes storage is implemented, per-user bayes is not currently available. Dumping
       (sa-learn --backup, or --dump) of a huge database may not be possible if all keys do not fit into process
       memory.
