________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  following  global  variables are created and managed automatically by the Tcl library.  Except where
       noted below, these variables should normally be treated as read-only by application-specific code and  by
       users.

       <b>auto_path</b>
              If  set,  then  it  must  contain  a  valid Tcl list giving directories to search during auto-load
              operations (including for package index files when using the  default  <b>package</b>  <b>unknown</b>  handler).
              This  variable  is  initialized during startup to contain, in order: the directories listed in the
              <b>TCLLIBPATH</b> environment variable, the directory named  by  the  <b>tcl_library</b>  global  variable,  the
              parent  directory  of  <b>tcl_library</b>, <b>[file</b> <b>dirname</b> <b>[file</b> <b>dirname</b> <b>[info</b> <b>nameofexecutable]]]<a href="file:/lib">/lib</a></b>, the
              directories listed in the <b>tcl_pkgPath</b> variable.   Additional  locations  to  look  for  files  and
              package  indices  should  normally  be  added  to  this variable using <b>lappend</b>.  Initialization of
              auto_path from the TCLLIBPATH environment variable undergoes tilde substitution (see <b>filename</b>)  on
              each  path.  Any  tilde  substitution  that fails because the user is unknown will be omitted from
              auto_path.

              Additional variables relating to  package  management  exist.  More  details  are  listed  in  the
              <b>VARIABLES</b> section of the <b>library</b> manual page.

       <b>env</b>    This  variable  is  maintained by Tcl as an array whose elements are the environment variables for
              the process.  Reading an element will return the value of the corresponding environment  variable.
              Setting an element of the array will modify the corresponding environment variable or create a new
              one  if  it  does  not  already  exist.  Unsetting an element of <b>env</b> will remove the corresponding
              environment variable.  Changes to the <b>env</b> array will affect the environment passed to children  by
              commands  like  <b>exec</b>.  If the entire <b>env</b> array is unset then Tcl will stop monitoring <b>env</b> accesses
              and will not update environment variables.

              Under Windows, the environment variables PATH and COMSPEC  in  any  capitalization  are  converted
              automatically  to  upper case.  For instance, the PATH variable could be exported by the operating
              system as “path”, “Path”, “PaTh”, etc., causing otherwise simple Tcl code to have to support  many
              special  cases.  All other environment variables inherited by Tcl are left unmodified.  Setting an
              env array variable to blank is the same as unsetting it as this is the behavior of the  underlying
              Windows  OS.   It  should be noted that relying on an existing and empty environment variable will
              not work on Windows and is discouraged for cross-platform usage.

              The following elements of <b>env</b> are special to Tcl:

              <b>env(HOME)</b>
                     This environment variable, if set, gives the location of the directory considered to be the
                     current user's home directory. The value of this variable is  returned  by  the  <b>file</b>  <b>home</b>
                     command.  Most platforms set this correctly by default; it does not normally need to be set
                     by user code. On Windows, if not already set, it is set to the  value  of  the  <b>USERPROFILE</b>
                     environment variable.

              <b>env(TCL_LIBRARY)</b>
                     If  set,  then  it  specifies the location of the directory containing library scripts (the
                     value of this variable will be assigned to the <b>tcl_library</b> variable and therefore  returned
                     by the command <b>info</b> <b>library</b>).  If this variable is not set then a default value is used.

                     Note that this environment variable should <u>not</u> normally be set.

              <b>env(TCLLIBPATH)</b>
                     If set, then it must contain a valid Tcl list giving directories to search during auto-load
                     operations.   Directories must be specified in Tcl format, using “/” as the path separator,
                     regardless of platform.  This  variable  is  only  used  when  initializing  the  <b>auto_path</b>
                     variable.

              <b>env(TCL_TZ)</b>, <b>env(TZ)</b>
                     These  specify  the default timezone used for parsing and formatting times and dates in the
                     <b>clock</b> command. On many platforms, the TZ environment variable is set up  by  the  operating
                     system.

              <b>env(LC_ALL)</b>, <b>env(LC_MESSAGES)</b>, <b>env(LANG)</b>
                     These  environment  variables  are  used  by the <b>msgcat</b> package to determine what locale to
                     format messages using.

              <b>env(TCL_INTERP_DEBUG_FRAME)</b>
                     If existing, it has the same effect as running <b>interp</b> <b>debug</b> <b>{}</b> <b>-frame</b> <b>1</b> as the  very  first
                     command of each new Tcl interpreter.

       <b>errorCode</b>
              This  variable  holds  the value of the <b>-errorcode</b> return option set by the most recent error that
              occurred in this interpreter.  This list value represents additional information about  the  error
              in  a  form  that  is  easy  to process with programs.  The first element of the list identifies a
              general class of errors, and determines the format of the rest of the list.  The following formats
              for <b>-errorcode</b> return options are used  by  the  Tcl  core;  individual  applications  may  define
              additional formats.

              <b>ARITH</b> <u>code</u> <u>msg</u>
                     This format is used when an arithmetic error occurs (e.g. an attempt to divide zero by zero
                     in  the <b>expr</b> command).  <u>Code</u> identifies the precise error and <u>msg</u> provides a human-readable
                     description of the error.  <u>Code</u> will be either DIVZERO (for an attempt to divide by  zero),
                     DOMAIN  (if  an  argument is outside the domain of a function, such as acos(-3)), IOVERFLOW
                     (for integer overflow), OVERFLOW (for a floating-point overflow), or UNKNOWN (if the  cause
                     of the error cannot be determined).

                     Detection of these errors depends in part on the underlying hardware and system libraries.

              <b>CHILDKILLED</b> <u>pid</u> <u>sigName</u> <u>msg</u>
                     This  format  is  used  when  a child process has been killed because of a signal.  The <u>pid</u>
                     element will be the process's identifier (in decimal).  The <u>sigName</u>  element  will  be  the
                     symbolic  name  of  the  signal that caused the process to terminate; it will be one of the
                     names from the include file signal.h, such as <b>SIGPIPE</b>.  The <u>msg</u> element  will  be  a  short
                     human-readable  message  describing the signal, such as “write on pipe with no readers” for
                     <b>SIGPIPE</b>.

              <b>CHILDSTATUS</b> <u>pid</u> <u>code</u>
                     This format is used when a child process has exited with a non-zero exit status.   The  <u>pid</u>
                     element will be the process's identifier (in decimal) and the <u>code</u> element will be the exit
                     code returned by the process (also in decimal).

              <b>CHILDSUSP</b> <u>pid</u> <u>sigName</u> <u>msg</u>
                     This  format  is used when a child process has been suspended because of a signal.  The <u>pid</u>
                     element will be the process's identifier, in decimal.  The  <u>sigName</u>  element  will  be  the
                     symbolic  name  of  the  signal that caused the process to suspend; this will be one of the
                     names from the include file signal.h, such as <b>SIGTTIN</b>.  The <u>msg</u> element  will  be  a  short
                     human-readable message describing the signal, such as “background tty read” for <b>SIGTTIN</b>.

              <b>NONE</b>   This  format  is  used for errors where no additional information is available for an error
                     besides the message returned with the error.  In these cases the <b>-errorcode</b>  return  option
                     will consist of a list containing a single element whose contents are <b>NONE</b>.

              <b>POSIX</b> <u>errName</u> <u>msg</u>
                     If  the  first  element  is <b>POSIX</b>, then the error occurred during a POSIX kernel call.  The
                     <u>errName</u> element will contain the symbolic name of the error that occurred, such as  <b>ENOENT</b>;
                     this  will  be one of the values defined in the include file errno.h.  The <u>msg</u> element will
                     be a human-readable message corresponding to <u>errName</u>, such as “no such file  or  directory”
                     for the <b>ENOENT</b> case.

              <b>TCL</b> ...
                     Indicates  some sort of problem generated in relation to Tcl itself, e.g. a failure to look
                     up a channel or variable.

              To set  the  <b>-errorcode</b>  return  option,  applications  should  use  library  procedures  such  as
              <b>Tcl_SetObjErrorCode</b>,  <b>Tcl_SetReturnOptions</b>,  and <b>Tcl_PosixError</b>, or they may invoke the <b>-errorcode</b>
              option of the <b>return</b> command.  If none of these methods for setting the error code has been  used,
              the Tcl interpreter will reset the variable to <b>NONE</b> after the next error.

       <b>errorInfo</b>
              This  variable  holds  the value of the <b>-errorinfo</b> return option set by the most recent error that
              occurred in this interpreter.  This string value will contain one or more  lines  identifying  the
              Tcl  commands  and  procedures  that were being executed when the most recent error occurred.  Its
              contents take the form of a stack trace showing the various nested  Tcl  commands  that  had  been
              invoked at the time of the error.

       <b>tcl_library</b>
              This  variable holds the name of a directory containing the system library of Tcl scripts, such as
              those used for auto-loading.  The value of this variable is returned by the <b>info</b> <b>library</b>  command.
              See  the  <b>library</b>  manual  entry for details of the facilities provided by the Tcl script library.
              Normally each application or package will have its  own  application-specific  script  library  in
              addition to the Tcl script library; each application should set a global variable with a name like
              <b>$</b><u>app</u><b>_library</b>  (where  <u>app</u>  is  the  application's  name)  to  hold  the network file name for that
              application's library directory.  The initial value of <b>tcl_library</b> is set when an  interpreter  is
              created by searching several different directories until one is found that contains an appropriate
              Tcl  startup  script.  If the <b>TCL_LIBRARY</b> environment variable exists, then the directory it names
              is checked first.  If <b>TCL_LIBRARY</b> is not set or doesn't refer to an  appropriate  directory,  then
              Tcl  checks several other directories based on a compiled-in default location, the location of the
              binary containing the application, and the current working directory.

       <b>tcl_patchLevel</b>
              When an interpreter is created Tcl initializes this variable to hold a string giving  the  current
              patch  level for Tcl, such as <b>8.4.16</b> for Tcl 8.4 with the first sixteen official patches, or <b>8.5b3</b>
              for the third beta release of Tcl 8.5.  The value  of  this  variable  is  returned  by  the  <b>info</b>
              <b>patchlevel</b> command.

       <b>tcl_pkgPath</b>
              This variable holds a list of directories indicating where packages are normally installed.  It is
              not used on Windows.  It typically contains either one or two entries; if it contains two entries,
              the  first is normally a directory for platform-dependent packages (e.g., shared library binaries)
              and the second is normally a directory for platform-independent  packages  (e.g.,  script  files).
              Typically  a  package  is  installed  as  a  subdirectory of one of the entries in the <b>tcl_pkgPath</b>
              variable. The directories in the <b>tcl_pkgPath</b> variable are included by  default  in  the  <b>auto_path</b>
              variable,  so  they  and  their  immediate  subdirectories are automatically searched for packages
              during <b>package</b> <b>require</b> commands.  Note:  <b>tcl_pkgPath</b>  is  not  intended  to  be  modified  by  the
              application.  Its value is added to <b>auto_path</b> at startup; changes to <b>tcl_pkgPath</b> are not reflected
              in  <b>auto_path</b>.   If  you want Tcl to search additional directories for packages you should add the
              names of those directories to <b>auto_path</b>, not <b>tcl_pkgPath</b>.

       <b>tcl_platform</b>
              This is an associative array whose elements contain information about the platform  on  which  the
              application  is running, such as the name of the operating system, its current release number, and
              the machine's instruction set.  The elements listed below will always be  defined,  but  they  may
              have  empty  strings  as  values if Tcl could not retrieve any relevant information.  In addition,
              extensions and applications may add additional values to the array.  The predefined elements are:

              <b>byteOrder</b>
                     The native byte order of this machine: either <b>littleEndian</b> or <b>bigEndian</b>.

              <b>debug</b>  If this variable exists, then the interpreter was compiled with  and  linked  to  a  debug-
                     enabled  C  run-time.   This  variable will only exist on Windows, so extension writers can
                     specify which package to load depending on the C run-time library that is in use.  This  is
                     not an indication that this core contains symbols.

              <b>engine</b> The  name  of the Tcl language implementation.  When the interpreter is first created, this
                     is always set to the string <b>Tcl</b>.

              <b>machine</b>
                     The instruction set executed by this machine, such as <b>intel</b>, <b>PPC</b>, <b>68k</b>, or <b>sun4m</b>.   On  UNIX
                     machines, this is the value returned by <b>uname</b> <b>-m</b>.

              <b>os</b>     The  name of the operating system running on this machine, such as <b>Windows</b> <b>NT</b> or <b>SunOS</b>.  On
                     UNIX machines, this is the value returned by <b>uname</b> <b>-s</b>.

              <b>osVersion</b>
                     The version number for the operating system running on this  machine.   On  UNIX  machines,
                     this is the value returned by <b>uname</b> <b>-r</b>.

              <b>pathSeparator</b>
                     The  character  that  should  be  used  to <b>split</b> PATH-like environment variables into their
                     corresponding list of directory names.

              <b>platform</b>
                     Either <b>windows</b>, or <b>unix</b>.  This identifies the general operating environment of the machine.

              <b>pointerSize</b>
                     This gives the size of the native-machine pointer in bytes (strictly, it  is  same  as  the
                     result of evaluating <u>sizeof(void*)</u> in C.)

              <b>threaded</b>
                     If this variable exists, then the interpreter was compiled with threads enabled.

              <b>user</b>   This  identifies the current user based on the login information available on the platform.
                     This value comes from the getuid() and getpwuid() system calls on Unix, and the value  from
                     the GetUserName() system call on Windows.

              <b>wordSize</b>
                     This gives the size of the native-machine word in bytes (strictly, it is same as the result
                     of evaluating <u>sizeof(long)</u> in C.)

       <b>tcl_traceCompile</b>
              The  value of this variable can be set to control how much tracing information is displayed during
              bytecode compilation.  By default, <b>tcl_traceCompile</b> is  zero  and  no  information  is  displayed.
              Setting  <b>tcl_traceCompile</b> to 1 generates a one-line summary in <b>stdout</b> whenever a procedure or top-
              level command is compiled.  Setting it to 2 generates a detailed listing in <b>stdout</b> of the bytecode
              instructions emitted during every compilation.  This variable is useful in tracking down suspected
              problems with the Tcl compiler.

              This variable  and  functionality  only  exist  if  <b>TCL_COMPILE_DEBUG</b>  was  defined  during  Tcl's
              compilation.

       <b>tcl_traceExec</b>
              The  value of this variable can be set to control how much tracing information is displayed during
              bytecode execution.  By default, <b>tcl_traceExec</b> is zero and no information is  displayed.   Setting
              <b>tcl_traceExec</b>  to 1 generates a one-line trace in <b>stdout</b> on each call to a Tcl procedure.  Setting
              it to 2 generates a line of output whenever any Tcl command is invoked that contains the  name  of
              the  command  and  its arguments.  Setting it to 3 produces a detailed trace showing the result of
              executing each bytecode instruction.  Note that when <b>tcl_traceExec</b> is 2 or 3, commands such as <b>set</b>
              and <b>incr</b> that have been entirely replaced by a sequence of bytecode instructions  are  not  shown.
              Setting this variable is useful in tracking down suspected problems with the bytecode compiler and
              interpreter.

              This  variable  and  functionality  only  exist  if  <b>TCL_COMPILE_DEBUG</b>  was  defined  during Tcl's
              compilation.

       <b>tcl_wordchars</b>
              The value of this variable is a regular expression that can be set to control what are  considered
              “word”  characters.   It  defaults  to <b>\w</b>, which is any Unicode word character (number, letter, or
              underscore).

       <b>tcl_nonwordchars</b>
              The value of this variable is a regular expression that can be set to control what are  considered
              “non-word” characters.  It defaults to <b>\W</b>, which is anything but a Unicode word character (number,
              letter, or underscore).

       <b>tcl_version</b>
              When  an  interpreter is created Tcl initializes this variable to hold the version number for this
              version  of  Tcl  in  the  form  <u>x.y</u>.   Changes  to  <u>x</u>  represent  major  changes  with   probable
              incompatibilities and changes to <u>y</u> represent small enhancements and bug fixes that retain backward
              compatibility.  The value of this variable is returned by the <b>info</b> <b>tclversion</b> command.

</pre><h4><b>OTHER</b> <b>GLOBAL</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       The  following variables are only guaranteed to exist in <b>tclsh</b> and <b>wish</b> executables; the Tcl library does
       not define them itself but many Tcl environments do.

       <b>argc</b>  The number of arguments to <b>tclsh</b> or <b>wish</b>.

       <b>argv</b>  Tcl list of arguments to <b>tclsh</b> or <b>wish</b>.

       <b>argv0</b> The script that <b>tclsh</b> or <b>wish</b> started executing (if it was specified)  or  otherwise  the  name  by
             which <b>tclsh</b> or <b>wish</b> was invoked.

       <b>tcl_interactive</b>
             Contains 1 if <b>tclsh</b> or <b>wish</b> is running interactively (no script was specified and standard input is
             a terminal-like device), 0 otherwise.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       To  add  a  directory  to  the collection of locations searched by <b>package</b> <b>require</b>, e.g., because of some
       application-specific packages that are used, the <b>auto_path</b> variable needs to be updated:

              lappend ::<b>auto_path</b> [file join [pwd] "theLibDir"]

       A simple though not very robust way to handle command line arguments of the form “-foo 1 -bar  2”  is  to
       load them into an array having first loaded in the default settings:
              array set arguments {-foo 0 -bar 0 -grill 0}
              array set arguments $::<b>argv</b>
              puts "foo is $arguments(-foo)"
              puts "bar is $arguments(-bar)"
              puts "grill is $arguments(-grill)"

       The  <b>argv0</b> global variable can be used (in conjunction with the <b>info</b> <b>script</b> command) to determine whether
       the current script is being executed as the main script or loaded as a library.  This is  useful  because
       it allows a single script to be used as both a library and a demonstration of that library:

              if {$::<b>argv0</b> eq [info script]} {
                  # running as: tclsh example.tcl
              } else {
                  package provide Example 1.0
              }
