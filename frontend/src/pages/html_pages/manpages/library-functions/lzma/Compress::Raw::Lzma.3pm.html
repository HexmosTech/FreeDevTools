</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       "Compress::Raw::Lzma" provides an interface to the in-memory compression/uncompression functions from the
       lzma compression library.

       Although the primary purpose for the existence of "Compress::Raw::Lzma" is for use by the
       "IO::Compress::Lzma", "IO::Uncompress::UnLzma", "IO::Compress::Xz" and "IO::Uncompress::UnXz" modules, it
       can be used on its own for simple compression/uncompression tasks.

       There are two functions, called "code" and "flush", used in all the compression and uncompression
       interfaces defined in this module. By default both of these functions overwrites any data stored in its
       output buffer parameter. If you want to compress/uncompress to a single buffer, and have "code" and
       "flush" append to that buffer, enable the "AppendOutput" option when you create the
       compression/decompression object.

</pre><h4><b>Compression</b></h4><pre>
       There are four compression interfaces available in this module.

       Compress::Raw::Lzma::EasyEncoder
       Compress::Raw::Lzma::AloneEncoder
       Compress::Raw::Lzma::StreamEncoder
       Compress::Raw::Lzma::RawEncoder

   <b>($z,</b> <b>$status)</b> <b>=</b> <b>new</b> <b>Compress::Raw::Lzma::EasyEncoder</b> <b>[OPTS];</b>
       Creates a new <u>xz</u> compression object.

       If successful, it will return the initialised compression object, $z and a $status of "LZMA_OK" in a list
       context. In scalar context it returns the deflation object, $z, only.

       If  not  successful, the returned compression object, $z, will be <u>undef</u> and $status will hold the an <u>lzma</u>
       error code.

       Below is a list of the valid options:

       <b>Preset</b> <b>=&gt;</b> <b>$preset</b>
            Used to choose the compression preset.

            Valid values are 0-9 and "LZMA_PRESET_DEFAULT".

            0 is the fastest compression with the lowest memory usage and the lowest compression.

            9 is the slowest compression with the highest memory usage but with the best compression.

            Defaults to "LZMA_PRESET_DEFAULT".

       <b>Extreme</b> <b>=&gt;</b> <b>0|1</b>
            Makes the compression a lot slower, but a small compression gain.

            Defaults to 0.

       <b>Check</b> <b>=&gt;</b> <b>$check</b>
            Used to specify the integrity check used in the xz data stream.  Valid values are "LZMA_CHECK_NONE",
            "LZMA_CHECK_CRC32", "LZMA_CHECK_CRC64", "LZMA_CHECK_SHA256".

            Defaults to "LZMA_CHECK_CRC32".

       <b>AppendOutput</b> <b>=&gt;</b> <b>0|1</b>
            Controls whether the compressed data is appended to the output buffer  in  the  "code"  and  "flush"
            methods.

            Defaults  to  0.   (Note in versions of this module prior to 2.072 the default value was incorrectly
            documented as 1).

       <b>BufSize</b> <b>=&gt;</b> <b>$number</b>
            Sets the initial size for the output buffer used by the "$d-&gt;code" method. If the buffer has  to  be
            reallocated to increase the size, it will grow in increments of "Bufsize".

            Defaults to 16k.

   <b>($z,</b> <b>$status)</b> <b>=</b> <b>new</b> <b>Compress::Raw::Lzma::AloneEncoder</b> <b>[OPTS];</b>
       Creates a legacy <u>lzma</u> compression object. This format is also know as lzma_alone.

       If successful, it will return the initialised compression object, $z and a $status of "LZMA_OK" in a list
       context. In scalar context it returns the deflation object, $z, only.

       If  not  successful, the returned compression object, $z, will be <u>undef</u> and $status will hold the an <u>lzma</u>
       error code.

       Below is a list of the valid options:

       <b>Filter</b> <b>=&gt;</b> <b>$filter</b>
            The  $filter  option must be an object of type "Lzma::Filter::Lzma1".  See  "Lzma::Filter::Lzma"  in
            Compress::Raw::Lzma for a definition of "Lzma::Filter::Lzma1".

            If this option is not present an "Lzma::Filter::Lzma1" object with default values will be used.

       <b>AppendOutput</b> <b>=&gt;</b> <b>0|1</b>
            Controls  whether  the  compressed  data  is appended to the output buffer in the "code" and "flush"
            methods.

            Defaults to 0.  (Note in versions of this module prior to 2.072 the default  value  was  incorrectly
            documented as 1).

       <b>BufSize</b> <b>=&gt;</b> <b>$number</b>
            Sets  the  initial size for the output buffer used by the "$d-&gt;code" method. If the buffer has to be
            reallocated to increase the size, it will grow in increments of "Bufsize".

            Defaults to 16k.

   <b>($z,</b> <b>$status)</b> <b>=</b> <b>new</b> <b>Compress::Raw::Lzma::StreamEncoder</b> <b>[OPTS];</b>
       Creates a <u>xz</u> compression object.

       If successful, it will return the initialised compression object, $z and a $status of "LZMA_OK" in a list
       context. In scalar context it returns the deflation object, $z, only.

       If not successful, the returned compression object, $z, will be <u>undef</u> and $status will hold the  an  <u>lzma</u>
       error code.

       Below is a list of the valid options:

       <b>Filter</b> <b>=&gt;</b> <b>[$filter1,</b> <b>$filter2,...]</b>
            This  option  is  used  to  change  the  bahaviour  of the StreamEncoder by applying between one and
            "LZMA_FILTERS_MAX" filters to the data stream during compression. See "Filters" for more details  on
            the available filters.

            If  this  option is present it must either contain a single "Lzma::Filter::Lzma" filter object or an
            array reference containing between one and "LZMA_FILTERS_MAX" filter objects.

            If this option is not present an "Lzma::Filter::Lzma2" object with default values will be used.

       <b>Check</b> <b>=&gt;</b> <b>$check</b>
            Used to specify the integrity check used in the xz data stream.  Valid values are "LZMA_CHECK_NONE",
            "LZMA_CHECK_CRC32", "LZMA_CHECK_CRC64", "LZMA_CHECK_SHA256".

            Defaults to "LZMA_CHECK_CRC32".

            Controls whether the compressed data is appended to the output buffer  in  the  "code"  and  "flush"
            methods.

            Defaults  to  0.   (Note in versions of this module prior to 2.072 the default value was incorrectly
            documented as 1).

       <b>BufSize</b> <b>=&gt;</b> <b>$number</b>
            Sets the initial size for the output buffer used by the "$d-&gt;code" method. If the buffer has  to  be
            reallocated to increase the size, it will grow in increments of "Bufsize".

            Defaults to 16k.

   <b>($z,</b> <b>$status)</b> <b>=</b> <b>new</b> <b>Compress::Raw::Lzma::RawEncoder</b> <b>[OPTS];</b>
       Low level access to lzma.

       If successful, it will return the initialised compression object, $z and a $status of "LZMA_OK" in a list
       context. In scalar context it returns the deflation object, $z, only.

       If  not  successful, the returned compression object, $z, will be <u>undef</u> and $status will hold the an <u>lzma</u>
       error code.

       Below is a list of the valid options:

       <b>Filter</b> <b>=&gt;</b> <b>$filter</b>
       <b>Filter</b> <b>=&gt;</b> <b>[$filter1,</b> <b>$filter2,...]</b>
            This option is used to  change  the  bahaviour  of  the  RawEncoder  by  applying  between  one  and

            array reference containing between one and "LZMA_FILTERS_MAX" filter objects.

            If this option is not present an "Lzma::Filter::Lzma2" object with default values will be used.

       <b>AppendOutput</b> <b>=&gt;</b> <b>0|1</b>
            Controls  whether  the  compressed  data  is appended to the output buffer in the "code" and "flush"
            methods.

            Defaults to 0.  (Note in versions of this module prior to 2.072 the default  value  was  incorrectly
            documented as 1).

       <b>BufSize</b> <b>=&gt;</b> <b>$number</b>
            Sets  the  initial size for the output buffer used by the "$d-&gt;code" method. If the buffer has to be
            reallocated to increase the size, it will grow in increments of "Bufsize".

            Defaults to 16k.

       <b>ForZip</b> <b>=&gt;</b> <b>1/0</b>
            This boolean option is used to enable prefixing the compressed data stream with an encoded  copy  of
            the filter properties.

   <b>$status</b> <b>=</b> <b>$lz-&gt;code($input,</b> <b>$output)</b>
       Reads the contents of $input, compresses it and writes the compressed data to $output.

       Returns "LZMA_OK" on success and an "lzma" error code on failure.

       If "appendOutput" is enabled in the constructor for the lzma object, the compressed data will be appended
       to $output. If not enabled, $output will be truncated before the compressed data is written to it.

   <b>$status</b> <b>=</b> <b>$lz-&gt;flush($output,</b> <b>LZMA_FINISH);</b>
       Flushes any pending compressed data to $output. By default it terminates the compressed data stream.

       Returns "LZMA_OK" on success and an "lzma" error code on failure.

   <b>Example</b>
       TODO

</pre><h4><b>Uncompression</b></h4><pre>
       There are four uncompression interfaces available in this module.

       Compress::Raw::Lzma::AutoDecoder
       Compress::Raw::Lzma::AloneDecoder
       Compress::Raw::Lzma::StreamDecoder
       Compress::Raw::Lzma::RawDecoder

   <b>($z,</b> <b>$status)</b> <b>=</b> <b>new</b> <b>Compress::Raw::Lzma::AutoDecoder</b> <b>[OPTS]</b> <b>;</b>
       Create  an  object  that  can  uncompress  any of the compressed data streams that can be created by this
       module.

       If successful, it will return the initialised uncompression object, $z and a $status of  "LZMA_OK"  in  a
       list context. In scalar context it returns the deflation object, $z, only.

       If not successful, the returned uncompression object, $z, will be <u>undef</u> and $status will hold the an <u>lzma</u>
       error code.

       Below is a list of the valid options:

       <b>-MemLimit</b>
            The number of bytes to use when uncompressing.

            Default is unlimited.

       <b>-Bufsize</b>
            Sets  the  initial size for the output buffer used by the "$i-&gt;code" method. If the output buffer in
            this method has to be reallocated to increase the size, it will grow in increments of "Bufsize".

            Default is 16k.

       <b>-AppendOutput</b>
            This option controls how data is written to the output buffer by the "$i-&gt;code" method.

            If the option is set to false, the output buffer in the "$i-&gt;code" method will be  truncated  before
            uncompressed data is written to it.

            If  the  option  is  set  to  true,  uncompressed  data will be appended to the output buffer by the
            "$i-&gt;code" method.

            This option defaults to false.

       <b>-ConsumeInput</b>
            If set to true, this option will remove compressed data from the  input  buffer  of  the  "$i-&gt;code"
            method as the uncompression progresses.

            This  option  can  be  useful  when  you  are processing compressed data that is embedded in another
            file/buffer. In this case the data that immediately follows the compressed stream will  be  left  in
            the input buffer.

            This option defaults to true.

       <b>-LimitOutput</b>
            The  "LimitOutput" option changes the behavior of the "$i-&gt;code" method so that the amount of memory
            used by the output buffer can be limited.

            When "LimitOutput" is used the size of the output buffer used  will  either  be  the  value  of  the
            "Bufsize"  option  or  the  amount  of  memory  already  allocated  to $output, whichever is larger.
            Predicting the output size available is tricky, so don't rely on  getting  an  exact  output  buffer
            size.

            When  "LimitOutout" is not specified "$i-&gt;code" will use as much memory as it takes to write all the
            uncompressed data it creates by uncompressing the input buffer.

            If "LimitOutput" is enabled, the "ConsumeInput" option will also be enabled.

            This option defaults to false.

            See "The LimitOutput option" for a discussion on why "LimitOutput" is needed and how to use it.

   <b>($z,</b> <b>$status)</b> <b>=</b> <b>new</b> <b>Compress::Raw::Lzma::AloneDecoder</b> <b>[OPTS]</b> <b>;</b>
       Create an object that can uncompress an lzma_alone data stream.

       If successful, it will return the initialised uncompression object, $z and a $status of  "LZMA_OK"  in  a
       list context. In scalar context it returns the deflation object, $z, only.

       If not successful, the returned uncompression object, $z, will be <u>undef</u> and $status will hold the an <u>lzma</u>
       error code.

       Below is a list of the valid options:

       <b>-MemLimit</b>
            The number of bytes to use when uncompressing.

            Default is unlimited.

       <b>-Bufsize</b>
            Sets  the  initial size for the output buffer used by the "$i-&gt;code" method. If the output buffer in
            this method has to be reallocated to increase the size, it will grow in increments of "Bufsize".

            Default is 16k.

       <b>-AppendOutput</b>
            This option controls how data is written to the output buffer by the "$i-&gt;code" method.

            If the option is set to false, the output buffer in the "$i-&gt;code" method will be  truncated  before
            uncompressed data is written to it.

            If  the  option  is  set  to  true,  uncompressed  data will be appended to the output buffer by the
            "$i-&gt;code" method.

            This option defaults to false.

       <b>-ConsumeInput</b>
            If set to true, this option will remove compressed data from the  input  buffer  of  the  "$i-&gt;code"
            method as the uncompression progresses.

            This  option  can  be  useful  when  you  are processing compressed data that is embedded in another
            file/buffer. In this case the data that immediately follows the compressed stream will  be  left  in
            the input buffer.

            This option defaults to true.

       <b>-LimitOutput</b>
            The  "LimitOutput" option changes the behavior of the "$i-&gt;code" method so that the amount of memory
            used by the output buffer can be limited.

            When "LimitOutput" is used the size of the output buffer used  will  either  be  the  value  of  the
            "Bufsize"  option  or  the  amount  of  memory  already  allocated  to $output, whichever is larger.
            Predicting the output size available is tricky, so don't rely on  getting  an  exact  output  buffer
            size.

            When  "LimitOutout" is not specified "$i-&gt;code" will use as much memory as it takes to write all the
            uncompressed data it creates by uncompressing the input buffer.

            If "LimitOutput" is enabled, the "ConsumeInput" option will also be enabled.

            This option defaults to false.

            See "The LimitOutput option" for a discussion on why "LimitOutput" is needed and how to use it.

   <b>$status</b> <b>=</b> <b>$z-&gt;code($input,</b> <b>$output);</b>
       Uncompresses $input and writes the uncompressed data to $output.

       Returns "LZMA_OK" if the uncompression was successful, but the end of the compressed data stream has  not
       been reached. Returns "LZMA_STREAM_END" on successful uncompression and the end of the compression stream
       has been reached.

       If "consumeInput" is enabled in the constructor for the lzma object, $input will have all compressed data
       removed  from  it  after  uncompression.  On "LZMA_OK" return this will mean that $input will be an empty
       string; when "LZMA_STREAM_END" $input will either be an  empty  string  or  will  contain  whatever  data
       immediately followed the compressed data stream.

       If  "appendOutput"  is  enabled  in  the  constructor  for the lzma object, the uncompressed data will be
       appended to $output. If not enabled, $output will be truncated before the uncompressed data is written to
       it.

</pre><h4><b>Filters</b></h4><pre>
       TODO - more here

       A  number  of  the   Lzma   compression   interfaces   (namely   "Compress::Raw::Lzma::StreamEncoder"   &amp;
       "Compress::Raw::Lzma::AloneEncoder")  and the raw lzma uncompression interface make use of filters. These
       filters are used to change the behaviour of compression (and raw uncompression).

       All Lzma Filters are sub-classed from the "Lzma::Filter" base-class.

   <b>Lzma::Filter::Lzma</b>
       The "Lzma::Filter::Lzma" class is used to... TODO - more here

       There are two subclasses of "Lzma::Filter::Lzma", namely "Lzma::Filter::Lzma1" and "Lzma::Filter::Lzma2".

       The   former   is   typically   used   with   "Compress::Raw::Lzma::AloneEncoder".    The   latter   with
       "Compress::Raw::Lzma::StreamEncoder".

       When  using  Lzma  filters an "Lzma::Filter::Lzma" <u>must</u> be included and it <u>must</u> be the last filter in the
       chain. There can only be one "Lzma::Filter::Lzma" filter in any filter chain.

       The "Lzma::Filter::Lzma" construction takes the following options.

       DictSize =&gt; $value
            Dictionary size in bytes. This controls how many bytes of the recently processed  uncompressed  data
            is kept in memory. The size of the dictionary must be at least "LZMA_DICT_SIZE_MIN".

            Defaults to "LZMA_DICT_SIZE_DEFAULT".

       PresetDict =&gt; $dict
            Provide an initial dictionary. This value is used to initialize the LZ77 history window.

            This  feature  only  works  correctly with raw encoding and decoding.  You may not be able to decode
            other formats that have been encoded with a preset dictionary.

            $dict should contain typical strings that occur  in  the  files  being  compressed,  with  the  most
            probably strings near the end fo the preset dictionary.

            If $dict is larger than "DictSize", only the last "DictSize" bytes are processed.

       Lc =&gt; $value
            Number of literal context bits.

            How  many  of the highest bits of the previous uncompressed eight-bit byte (also known as `literal')
            are taken into account when predicting the bits of the next literal.

            $value must be a number between "LZMA_LCLP_MIN" and "LZMA_LCLP_MAX".

            Note the sum of the "Lc" and "Lp" options cannot exceed 4.

            Defaults to "LZMA_LC_DEFAULT".

       Lp =&gt; $value
            Number of literal position bits.

            How many of the lowest bits of the current position (number of  bytes  from  the  beginning  of  the
            uncompressed  data)  in  the uncompressed data is taken into account when predicting the bits of the
            next literal (a single eight-bit byte).

            Defaults to "LZMA_LP_DEFAULT".

       Pb =&gt; $value
            Number of position bits

            How many of the lowest bits of the current position in the uncompressed data is taken  into  account
            when  estimating  probabilities  of  matches.  A  match  is a sequence of bytes for which a matching
            sequence is found from the dictionary and thus can be stored as distance-length pair.

            $value must be a number between "LZMA_PB_MIN" and "LZMA_PB_MAX".

            Defaults to "LZMA_PB_DEFAULT".

       Mode =&gt; $value
            The Compression Mode. Valid values are "LZMA_MODE_FAST" and "LZMA_MODE_NORMAL".

            Defaults to "LZMA_MODE_NORMAL".

       Nice =&gt; $value
            Nice length of a match

            Defaults to 64.

       Mf =&gt; $value
            Defines which Match Finder to use.  Valid  values  are  "LZMA_MF_HC3"  "LZMA_MF_HC4",  "LZMA_MF_BT2"
            "LZMA_MF_BT3" and "LZMA_MF_BT4".

            Defaults to "LZMA_MF_BT4".

       Depth =&gt; $value
            Maximum search depth in the match finder.

            Defaults to 0.

   <b>Lzma::Filter::BCJ</b>
       The  sub-classes  of  "Lzma::Filter::BCJ"  are the Branch/Call/Jump conversion filters. These filters are
       used to rewrite executable binary code for a number of processor architectures.  None  of  these  classes
       take any options.

       Lzma::Filter::X86
            Filter for x86 binaries.

       Lzma::Filter::PowerPC
            Filter for Big endian PowerPC binaries.

       Lzma::Filter::IA64
            Filter for IA64 (Itanium) binaries.

       Lzma::Filter::ARM
            Filter for ARM binaries.

       Lzma::Filter::ARMThumb
            Filter for ARMThumb binaries.

       Lzma::Filter::Sparc
            Filter for Sparc binaries.

   <b>Lzma::Filter::Delta</b>
       Usage is

           Lzma::Filter::Delta [OPTS]

       Type =&gt; $type
            Defines  the  type  of  Delta  calculation.  The  only available type (and therefore the default) is
            "LZMA_DELTA_TYPE_BYTE",

       Distance =&gt; $value
            Defines  the  Delta  Distance.  $value  must  be  a   number   between   "LZMA_DELTA_DIST_MIN"   and
            "LZMA_DELTA_DIST_MAX".

            Default is "LZMA_DELTA_DIST_MIN".
