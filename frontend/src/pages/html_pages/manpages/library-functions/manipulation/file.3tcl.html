       file - Manipulate file names and attributes

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>file</b> <u>option</u> <u>name</u> ?<u>arg</u> <u>arg</u> <u>...</u>?
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  command  provides several operations on a file's name or attributes.  The <u>name</u> argument is the name
       of a file in most cases. The <u>option</u> argument indicates what  to  do  with  the  file  name.   Any  unique
       abbreviation for <u>option</u> is acceptable.  The valid options are:

       <b>file</b> <b>atime</b> <u>name</u> ?<u>time</u>?
              Returns  a  decimal  string  giving  the  time  at  which file <u>name</u> was last accessed.  If <u>time</u> is
              specified, it is an access time to set for the file.  The time is measured in the  standard  POSIX
              fashion as seconds from a fixed starting time (often January 1, 1970).  If the file does not exist
              or  its  access  time  cannot  be queried or set then an error is generated.  On Windows, FAT file
              systems do not support access time.   On  <b>zipfs</b>  file  systems,  access  time  is  mapped  to  the
              modification time.

       <b>file</b> <b>attributes</b> <u>name</u>

       <b>file</b> <b>attributes</b> <u>name</u> ?<u>option</u>?

       <b>file</b> <b>attributes</b> <u>name</u> ?<u>option</u> <u>value</u> <u>option</u> <u>value...</u>?
              This  subcommand  returns  or sets platform-specific values associated with a file. The first form
              returns a list of the platform-specific options and their values.  The  second  form  returns  the
              value  for  the  given  option.  The  third form sets one or more of the values. The values are as
              follows:

              On Unix, <b>-group</b> gets or sets the group name for the file. A group id can be given to the  command,
              but  it  returns  a  group  name.  <b>-owner</b> gets or sets the user name of the owner of the file. The
              command returns the owner name, but the numerical  id  can  be  passed  when  setting  the  owner.
              <b>-permissions</b>  retrieves or sets a file's access permissions, using octal notation by default. This
              option also provides limited support for setting permissions using the symbolic notation  accepted
              by   the  <b>chmod</b>  command,  following  the  form  [<b>ugo</b>]?[[<b>+-=</b>][<b>rwxst</b>]<b>,</b>[...]].  Multiple  permission
              specifications may be given, separated by commas. E.g., <b>u+s,go-rw</b> would set the setuid bit  for  a
              file's  owner as well as remove read and write permission for the file's group and other users. An
              <b>ls</b>-style string of the form <b>rwxrwxrwx</b> is also accepted but must always be 9 characters long. E.g.,
              <b>rwxr-xr-t</b> is equivalent to <b>01755</b>. On versions of Unix supporting file flags, <b>-readonly</b> returns the
              value of, or sets, or clears the readonly attribute of a  file,  i.e.,  the  user  immutable  flag
              (<b>uchg</b>) to the <b>chflags</b> command.

              On  Windows, <b>-archive</b> gives the value or sets or clears the archive attribute of the file. <b>-hidden</b>
              gives the value or sets or clears the hidden attribute of the file.  <b>-longname</b>  will  expand  each
              path  element to its long version. This attribute cannot be set. <b>-readonly</b> gives the value or sets
              or clears the readonly attribute of the file. <b>-shortname</b> gives a string where every  path  element
              is replaced with its short (8.3) version of the name if possible. For path elements that cannot be
              mapped  to short names, the long name is retained. This attribute cannot be set.  <b>-system</b> gives or
              sets or clears the value of the system attribute of the file.

              On macOS and Darwin, <b>-creator</b> gives or sets the Finder creator type of the file. <b>-hidden</b> gives  or
              sets  or  clears  the hidden attribute of the file. <b>-readonly</b> gives or sets or clears the readonly
              attribute of the file. <b>-rsrclength</b> gives the length  of  the  resource  fork  of  the  file,  this
              attribute  can  only  be set to the value 0, which results in the resource fork being stripped off
              the file.

              On all platforms, files in <b>zipfs</b> mounted archives return the following attributes. These  are  all
              read-only and cannot be directly set.

                     <b>-archive</b>
                            The path of the mounted ZIP archive containing the file.

                     <b>-compsize</b>
                            The compressed size of the file within the archive.  This is <b>0</b> for directories.

                     <b>-crc</b>   The CRC of the file if present, else <b>0</b>.

                     <b>-mount</b> The path where the containing archive is mounted.

                     <b>-offset</b>
                            The offset of the file within the archive.

                     <b>-uncompsize</b>
                            The uncompressed size of the file. This is <b>0</b> for directories.

              Other attributes may be present in the returned list. These should be ignored.

       <b>file</b> <b>channels</b> ?<u>pattern</u>?
              If  <u>pattern</u>  is  not  specified,  returns  a list of names of all registered open channels in this
              interpreter.  If <u>pattern</u> is specified, only those names matching <u>pattern</u> are  returned.   Matching
              is determined using the same rules as for <b>string</b> <b>match</b>.

       <b>file</b> <b>copy</b> ?<b>-force</b>? ?<b>--</b>? <u>source</u> <u>target</u>

       <b>file</b> <b>copy</b> ?<b>-force</b>? ?<b>--</b>? <u>source</u> ?<u>source</u> ...? <u>targetDir</u>
              The  first  form makes a copy of the file or directory <u>source</u> under the pathname <u>target</u>. If <u>target</u>
              is an existing directory, then the second form is used.  The  second  form  makes  a  copy  inside
              <u>targetDir</u>  of each <u>source</u> file listed.  If a directory is specified as a <u>source</u>, then the contents
              of the directory will be recursively copied into <u>targetDir</u>. Existing files will not be overwritten
              unless the <b>-force</b> option is specified (when Tcl will also attempt to  adjust  permissions  on  the
              destination  file  or  directory if that is necessary to allow the copy to proceed).  When copying
              within a single filesystem, <u>file</u> <u>copy</u> will copy soft links (i.e.  the links themselves are copied,
              not the things they point to).  Trying to overwrite a non-empty directory, overwrite  a  directory
              with  a  file,  or  overwrite a file with a directory will all result in errors even if <b>-force</b> was
              specified.  Arguments are processed in the order specified, halting at the first error, if any.  A
              <b>--</b> marks the end of switches; the argument following the <b>--</b> will be treated as a <u>source</u> even if it
              starts with a <b>-</b>.

       <b>file</b> <b>delete</b> ?<b>-force</b>? ?<b>--</b>? ?<u>pathname</u> ... ?
              Removes the file or directory specified by each <u>pathname</u> argument.  Non-empty directories will  be
              removed  only  if  the  <b>-force</b>  option  is specified.  When operating on symbolic links, the links
              themselves will be deleted, not the objects they point to.  Trying to delete a  non-existent  file
              is  not considered an error.  Trying to delete a read-only file will cause the file to be deleted,
              even if the <b>-force</b> flags is not specified.  If the <b>-force</b> option is specified on a directory,  Tcl
              will attempt both to change permissions and move the current directory “pwd” out of the given path
              if  that  is  necessary  to  allow  the deletion to proceed.  Arguments are processed in the order
              specified, halting at the first error, if any.  A <b>--</b> marks  the  end  of  switches;  the  argument
              following the <b>--</b> will be treated as a <u>pathname</u> even if it starts with a <b>-</b>.

       <b>file</b> <b>dirname</b> <u>name</u>
              Returns  a  name  comprised  of all of the path components in <u>name</u> excluding the last element.  If
              <u>name</u> is a relative file name and only contains one path element, then returns “<b>.</b>”.  If <u>name</u> refers
              to a root directory, then the root directory is returned.  For example,

                     <b>file</b> <b>dirname</b> c:/

              returns <b>c:/</b>.

       <b>file</b> <b>executable</b> <u>name</u>
              Returns <b>1</b> if file <u>name</u> is executable by the current user, <b>0</b> otherwise. On Windows, which does  not
              have  an  executable  attribute,  the command treats all directories and any files with extensions
              <b>exe</b>, <b>com</b>, <b>cmd</b> or <b>bat</b> as executable.

       <b>file</b> <b>exists</b> <u>name</u>
              Returns <b>1</b> if file <u>name</u> exists and the current user  has  search  privileges  for  the  directories
              leading to it, <b>0</b> otherwise.

       <b>file</b> <b>extension</b> <u>name</u>
              Returns  all  of  the  characters  in <u>name</u> after and including the last dot in the last element of
              <u>name</u>.  If there is no dot in the last element of <u>name</u> then returns the empty string.

       <b>file</b> <b>home</b> <b>?</b><u>username</u>?
              If no argument is specified, the command returns the home directory of the current user.  This  is 2
              generally the value of the <b>$HOME</b> environment variable except that on Windows platforms backslashes 2
              in  the path are replaced by forward slashes. An error is raised if the <b>$HOME</b> environment variable 2
              is not set.                                                                                        2

              If <u>username</u> is specified, the command returns the home directory configured in the system for  the 2
              specified  user.  Note this may be different than the value of the <b>$HOME</b> environment variable even 2
              when <u>username</u> corresponds to the current user. An  error  is  raised  if  the  <u>username</u>  does  not 2
              correspond to a user account on the system.                                                        2

       <b>file</b> <b>isdirectory</b> <u>name</u>
              Returns <b>1</b> if file <u>name</u> is a directory, <b>0</b> otherwise.

       <b>file</b> <b>isfile</b> <u>name</u>
              Returns <b>1</b> if file <u>name</u> is a regular file, <b>0</b> otherwise.

       <b>file</b> <b>join</b> <u>name</u> ?<u>name</u> <u>...</u>?
              Takes  one  or more file names and combines them, using the correct path separator for the current
              platform.  If a particular <u>name</u> is relative, then it will be joined  to  the  previous  file  name
              argument.   Otherwise,  any earlier arguments will be discarded, and joining will proceed from the
              current argument.  For example,

                     <b>file</b> <b>join</b> a b /foo bar

              returns <b>/foo/bar</b>.

              Note that any of the names can contain separators, and that the result is always canonical for the
              current platform: <b>/</b> for Unix and Windows.

       <b>file</b> <b>link</b> ?<u>-linktype</u>? <u>linkName</u> ?<u>target</u>?
              If only one argument is given, that argument is assumed to be <u>linkName</u>, and this  command  returns
              the  value of the link given by <u>linkName</u> (i.e. the name of the file it points to).  If <u>linkName</u> is
              not a link or its value cannot be read (as, for example, seems to be the  case  with  hard  links,
              which look just like ordinary files), then an error is returned.

              If  2  arguments  are given, then these are assumed to be <u>linkName</u> and <u>target</u>. If <u>linkName</u> already
              exists, or if <u>target</u> does not exist, an error will be returned.  Otherwise, Tcl creates a new link
              called <u>linkName</u> which points to the existing filesystem  object  at  <u>target</u>  (which  is  also  the
              returned  value), where the type of the link is platform-specific (on Unix a symbolic link will be
              the default).  This is useful for the case where the user wishes to create  a  link  in  a  cross-
              platform way, and does not care what type of link is created.

              If the user wishes to make a link of a specific type only, (and signal an error if for some reason
              that  is not possible), then the optional <u>-linktype</u> argument should be given.  Accepted values for
              <u>-linktype</u> are “<b>-symbolic</b>” and “<b>-hard</b>”.

              On Unix, symbolic links can be made to relative paths, and those paths must  be  relative  to  the
              actual  <u>linkName</u>'s  location (not to the cwd), but on all other platforms where relative links are
              not supported, target paths will always be converted to absolute, normalized form before the  link
              is  created  (and  therefore relative paths are interpreted as relative to the cwd). When creating
              links on filesystems that either do not support any links, or do not  support  the  specific  type
              requested,  an error message will be returned.  Most Unix platforms support both symbolic and hard
              links (the latter for files only). Windows supports symbolic directory links and hard  file  links
              on NTFS drives.

       <b>file</b> <b>lstat</b> <u>name</u> ?<u>varName</u>?
              Same  as  <b>stat</b>  option  (see below) except uses the <u>lstat</u> kernel call instead of <u>stat</u>.  This means
              that if <u>name</u> refers to a symbolic link the information returned is for the link  rather  than  the
              file  it refers to.  On systems that do not support symbolic links this option behaves exactly the
              same as the <b>stat</b> option.

       <b>file</b> <b>mkdir</b> ?<u>dir</u> ...?
              Creates each directory specified.  For each pathname <u>dir</u> specified, this command will  create  all
              non-existing  parent  directories  as  well as <u>dir</u> itself.  If an existing directory is specified,
              then no action is taken and no error is returned.  Trying to overwrite an  existing  file  with  a
              directory will result in an error.  Arguments are processed in the order specified, halting at the
              first error, if any.

       <b>file</b> <b>mtime</b> <u>name</u> ?<u>time</u>?
              Returns  a  decimal  string  giving  the  time  at  which file <u>name</u> was last modified.  If <u>time</u> is
              specified, it is a modification time to set for the file (equivalent to Unix <b>touch</b>).  The time  is
              measured  in  the  standard  POSIX fashion as seconds from a fixed starting time (often January 1,
              1970).  If the file does not exist or its modified time cannot be queried or set then an error  is
              generated.  On <b>zipfs</b> file systems, modification time cannot be explicitly set.

       <b>file</b> <b>nativename</b> <u>name</u>
              Returns  the  platform-specific name of the file. This is useful if the filename is needed to pass
              to a platform-specific call, such as to a subprocess via <b>exec</b> under Windows (see <b>EXAMPLES</b> below).

       <b>file</b> <b>normalize</b> <u>name</u>
              Returns a unique normalized path representation for the file-system object (file, directory, link,
              etc), whose string value can be used as a unique identifier for  it.   A  normalized  path  is  an
              absolute  path  which  has  all “../” and “./” removed.  Also it is one which is in the “standard”
              format for the native platform.  On Unix, this means the segments leading up to the path  must  be
              free  of  symbolic links/aliases (but the very last path component may be a symbolic link), and on
              Windows it also means we want the long form with that form's case-dependence  (which  gives  us  a
              unique,  case-dependent  path).   The  one  exception  concerning  the  last  link  in the path is
              necessary, because Tcl or the user may wish to operate on the actual  symbolic  link  itself  (for
              example  <b>file</b>  <b>delete</b>, <b>file</b> <b>rename</b>, <b>file</b> <b>copy</b> are defined to operate on symbolic links, not on the
              things that they point to).

       <b>file</b> <b>owned</b> <u>name</u>
              Returns <b>1</b> if file <u>name</u> is owned by the current user, <b>0</b> otherwise.

       <b>file</b> <b>pathtype</b> <u>name</u>
              Returns one of <b>absolute</b>, <b>relative</b>, <b>volumerelative</b>. If <u>name</u> refers to a specific file on a specific
              volume, the path type will be <b>absolute</b>. If <u>name</u> refers to a file relative to the  current  working
              directory,  then  the path type will be <b>relative</b>. If <u>name</u> refers to a file relative to the current
              working directory on a specified volume, or to a specific file on the current working volume, then
              the path type is <b>volumerelative</b>.

       <b>file</b> <b>readable</b> <u>name</u>
              Returns <b>1</b> if file <u>name</u> is readable by the current user, <b>0</b> otherwise.

       <b>file</b> <b>readlink</b> <u>name</u>
              Returns the value of the symbolic link given by <u>name</u> (i.e. the name of the file it points to).  If
              <u>name</u> is not a symbolic link or its value cannot be read, then an error is  returned.   On  systems
              that do not support symbolic links this option is undefined.

       <b>file</b> <b>rename</b> ?<b>-force</b>? ?<b>--</b>? <u>source</u> <u>target</u>

       <b>file</b> <b>rename</b> ?<b>-force</b>? ?<b>--</b>? <u>source</u> ?<u>source</u> ...? <u>targetDir</u>
              The  first form takes the file or directory specified by pathname <u>source</u> and renames it to <u>target</u>,
              moving the file if the pathname <u>target</u> specifies a name in a different directory.  If <u>target</u> is an
              existing directory, then the second form is used.  The second  form  moves  each  <u>source</u>  file  or
              directory  into  the directory <u>targetDir</u>. Existing files will not be overwritten unless the <b>-force</b>
              option is specified.  When operating inside a single filesystem, Tcl will  rename  symbolic  links
              rather than the things that they point to.  Trying to overwrite a non-empty directory, overwrite a
              directory  with  a  file,  or  a  file  with a directory will all result in errors.  Arguments are
              processed in the order specified, halting at the first error, if any.   A  <b>--</b>  marks  the  end  of
              switches; the argument following the <b>--</b> will be treated as a <u>source</u> even if it starts with a <b>-</b>.

       <b>file</b> <b>rootname</b> <u>name</u>
              Returns  all of the characters in <u>name</u> up to but not including the last “.”  character in the last
              component of name.  If the last component of <u>name</u> does not contain a dot, then returns <u>name</u>.

       <b>file</b> <b>separator</b> ?<u>name</u>?
              If no argument is given, returns the character which is used to separate path segments for  native
              files  on this platform.  If a path is given, the filesystem responsible for that path is asked to
              return its separator character.  If no file system accepts <u>name</u>, an error is generated.

       <b>file</b> <b>size</b> <u>name</u>
              Returns a decimal string giving the size of file <u>name</u> in bytes.  If the file does not exist or its
              size cannot be queried then an error is generated.

       <b>file</b> <b>split</b> <u>name</u>
              Returns a list whose elements are the path components in <u>name</u>.  The first element of the list will
              have the same path type as <u>name</u>.  All other elements will be relative.  Path  separators  will  be
              discarded unless they are needed to ensure that an element is unambiguously relative.

       <b>file</b> <b>stat</b> <u>name</u> ?<u>varName</u>?
              Invokes  the <b>stat</b> kernel call on <u>name</u>, and returns a dictionary with the information returned from
              the kernel call. If <u>varName</u> is given, it uses the variable to hold the  information.   <u>VarName</u>  is
              treated as an array variable, and in such case the command returns the empty string. The following
              elements  are set: <b>atime</b>, <b>ctime</b>, <b>dev</b>, <b>gid</b>, <b>ino</b>, <b>mode</b>, <b>mtime</b>, <b>nlink</b>, <b>size</b>, <b>type</b>, <b>uid</b>.  Each element
              except <b>type</b> is a decimal string with the value of the corresponding field  from  the  <b>stat</b>  return
              structure;  see  the  manual  entry  for <b>stat</b> for details on the meanings of the values.  The <b>type</b>
              element gives the type of the file in the same form returned by the command <b>file</b> <b>type</b>.

       <b>file</b> <b>system</b> <u>name</u>
              Returns a list of one or two elements, the first of which is the name of the filesystem to use for
              the file, and the second, if given,  an  arbitrary  string  representing  the  filesystem-specific
              nature  or type of the location within that filesystem.  If a filesystem only supports one type of
              file, the second element may not be supplied.  For example the native files have a  first  element
              “native”,  and  a  second element which when given is a platform-specific type name for the file's
              system (e.g.  “NTFS”, “FAT”, on Windows).  A generic virtual file system  might  return  the  list
              “vfs  ftp”  to  represent  a  file on a remote ftp site mounted as a virtual filesystem through an
              extension called “vfs”.  If the file does not belong to any filesystem, an error is generated.

       <b>file</b> <b>tail</b> <u>name</u>
              Returns all of the characters in the last filesystem component of <u>name</u>.   Any  trailing  directory
              separator  in  <u>name</u>  is ignored.  If <u>name</u> contains no separators then returns <u>name</u>.  So, <b>file</b> <b>tail</b>
              <b>a/b</b>, <b>file</b> <b>tail</b> <b>a/b/</b> and <b>file</b> <b>tail</b> <b>b</b> all return <b>b</b>.

       <b>file</b> <b>tempdir</b> ?<u>template</u>?
              Creates a temporary directory (guaranteed to be newly created and writable by the current  script) 2
              and  returns its name. If <u>template</u> is given, it specifies one of or both of the existing directory 2
              (on a filesystem controlled by the operating system) to contain the temporary directory,  and  the 2
              base  part  of the directory name; it is considered to have the location of the directory if there 2
              is a directory separator in the name, and the base part is everything  after  the  last  directory 2
              separator  (if  non-empty).   The  default  containing  directory is determined by system-specific 2
              operations, and the default base name prefix is “<b>tcl</b>”.                                             2

              The following output is typical and illustrative; the actual output will vary between platforms:   2

                     % <b>file</b> <b>tempdir</b>                                                                              2
                     /var/tmp/tcl_u0kuy5                                                                         2
                      % <b>file</b> <b>tempdir</b> /tmp/myapp                                                                  2
                     /tmp/myapp_8o7r9L                                                                           2
                     % <b>file</b> <b>tempdir</b> <a href="file:/tmp/">/tmp/</a>                                                                        2
                     /tmp/tcl_1mOJHD                                                                             2
                     % <b>file</b> <b>tempdir</b> myapp                                                                        2
                     /var/tmp/myapp_0ihS0n                                                                       2

       <b>file</b> <b>tempfile</b> ?<u>nameVar</u>? ?<u>template</u>?
              Creates a temporary file and returns a read-write channel opened on that file.  If the <u>nameVar</u>  is
              given,  it  specifies  a  variable  that  the  name of the temporary file will be written into; if
              absent, Tcl will attempt to arrange for the temporary file to be deleted  once  it  is  no  longer
              required.  If  the  <u>template</u> is present, it specifies parts of the template of the filename to use
              when creating it (such as the directory, base-name or extension) though some platforms may  ignore
              some or all of these parts and use a built-in default instead.

              Note  that  temporary  files  are <u>only</u> ever created on the native filesystem. As such, they can be
              relied upon to be used with operating-system native APIs and  external  programs  that  require  a
              filename.

       <b>file</b> <b>tildeexpand</b> <u>name</u>
              Returns the result of performing tilde substitution on <u>name</u>. If the name begins with a tilde, then 2
              the  file  name  will  be interpreted as if the first element is replaced with the location of the 2
              home directory for the given user.  If the tilde is followed immediately by a path separator,  the 2
              <b>$HOME</b>  environment  variable  is  substituted.  Otherwise the characters between the tilde and the 2
              next separator are taken as a user name, which is used to retrieve the user's home  directory  for 2
              substitution.  An error is raised if the <b>$HOME</b> environment variable or user does not exist.        2

              If the file name does not begin with a tilde, it is returned unmodified.                           2

       <b>file</b> <b>type</b> <u>name</u>
              Returns  a  string  giving  the  type  of  file  <u>name</u>,  which  will  be  one  of  <b>file</b>, <b>directory</b>,
              <b>characterSpecial</b>, <b>blockSpecial</b>, <b>fifo</b>, <b>link</b>, or <b>socket</b>.

       <b>file</b> <b>volumes</b>
              Returns the absolute paths to the volumes mounted on the system, as a proper  Tcl  list.   Without
              any  virtual  filesystems  mounted  as  root volumes, on UNIX, the command will always return “/”,
              since all filesystems are locally mounted.  On Windows, it will return a  list  of  the  available
              local  drives  (e.g.   “a:/ c:/”).  If any virtual filesystem has mounted additional volumes, they
              will be in the returned list.

       <b>file</b> <b>writable</b> <u>name</u>
              Returns <b>1</b> if file <u>name</u> is writable by the current user, <b>0</b> otherwise.

</pre><h4><b>PORTABILITY</b> <b>ISSUES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Unix</b>   These commands always operate using the real user and group identifiers, not the effective ones.

       <b>Windows</b>
              The <b>file</b> <b>owned</b> subcommand uses the user identifier (SID) of the  process  token,  not  the  thread
              token which may be impersonating some other user.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       This  procedure  shows  how  to search for C files in a given directory that have a correspondingly-named
       object file in the current directory:

              proc findMatchingCFiles {dir} {
                  set files {}
                  switch $::tcl_platform(platform) {
                      windows {
                          set ext .obj
                      }
                      unix {
                         set ext .o
                      }
                  }
                  foreach file [glob -nocomplain -directory $dir *.c] {
                      set objectFile [<b>file</b> <b>tail</b> [<b>file</b> <b>rootname</b> $file]]$ext
                      if {[<b>file</b> <b>exists</b> $objectFile]} {
                          lappend files $file
                      }
                  }
                  return $files
              }

       Rename a file and leave a symbolic link pointing from the old location to the new place:

              set oldName foobar.txt
              set newName foo/bar.txt
              # Make sure that where we're going to move to exists...
              if {![<b>file</b> <b>isdirectory</b> [<b>file</b> <b>dirname</b> $newName]]} {
                  <b>file</b> <b>mkdir</b> [<b>file</b> <b>dirname</b> $newName]
              }
              <b>file</b> <b>rename</b> $oldName $newName
              <b>file</b> <b>link</b> -symbolic $oldName $newName

       On Windows, a file can be “started” easily enough (equivalent to double-clicking on it  in  the  Explorer
       interface) but the name passed to the operating system must be in native format:

              exec {*}[auto_execok start] {} [<b>file</b> <b>nativename</b> C:/Users/fred/example.txt]
