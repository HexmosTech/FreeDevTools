       curry - Create automatic curried method call closures for any class or object

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use curry;

         my $code = $obj-&gt;curry::frobnicate('foo');

       is equivalent to:

         my $code = sub { $obj-&gt;frobnicate(foo =&gt; @_) };

       If you have a method name (or a coderef), you can call (as of version 2):

         my $code = $obj-&gt;curry::_($method =&gt; 'foo');

       Additionally,

         use curry::weak;

         my $code = $obj-&gt;curry::weak::frobnicate('foo');

       is equivalent to:

         my $code = do {
           Scalar::Util::weaken(my $weak_obj = $obj);
           sub {
             return unless $weak_obj; # in case it already went away
             $weak_obj-&gt;frobnicate(foo =&gt; @_)
           };
         };

       Similarly, given a method name or coderef (as of version 2):

         my $code = $obj-&gt;curry::weak::_($method =&gt; 'foo');

       There are also $curry::curry and $curry::weak globals that work equivalently to "curry::_" and
       "curry::weak::_" respectively - you'll quite possibly see them in existing code because they were
       provided in pre-2.0 versions but they're unlikely to be the best option for new code.

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       How many times have you written

         sub { $obj-&gt;something($some, $args, @_) }

       or worse still needed to weaken it and had to check and re-check your code to be sure you weren't closing
       over things the wrong way?

       Right. That's why I wrote this.
