</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Test::Unit - the PerlUnit testing framework

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       This package provides only the project version number, copyright texts, and a framework overview in POD
       format.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This framework is intended to support unit testing in an object-oriented development paradigm (with
       support for inheritance of tests etc.) and is derived from the JUnit testing framework for Java by Kent
       Beck and Erich Gamma.  To start learning how to use this framework, see Test::Unit::TestCase and
       Test::Unit::TestSuite.  (There will also eventually be a tutorial in Test::Unit::Tutorial.

       However "Test::Unit::Procedural" is the procedural style interface to a sophisticated unit testing
       framework for Perl that .  Test::Unit is intended to provide a simpler interface to the framework that is
       more suitable for use in a scripting style environment.  Therefore, Test::Unit does not provide much
       support for an object-oriented approach to unit testing.

</pre><h4><b>FEEDBACK</b></h4><pre>
       The  Perl  Unit development team are humans. In part we develop stuff because it scratches our collective
       itch but we'd also really like to know if it scratches yours.

       Please        subscribe        to        the        perlunit-users        mailing         list         at
       &lt;<a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/perlunit-users">http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/perlunit-users</a>&gt; and let us know what you love and hate about
       PerlUnit and what else you want to do with it.
