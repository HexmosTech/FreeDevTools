       Supmap - Draws a map with a single call.  An implementation of the routine from which EZMAP grew.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        CALL SUPMAP (JPRJ, PLAT, PLON, ROTA, PLM1, PLM2, PLM3,
       + PLM4, JLTS, JGRD, IOUT, IDOT, IERR)

</pre><h4><b>C-BINDING</b> <b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;ncarg/ncargC.h&gt;

       void c_supmap (int jprj, float plat, float plon,
       float rota, float *plm1, float *plm2, float *plm3,
       float *plm4, int jlts, int jgrd, int iout, int idot,
       int *ierr)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       JPRJ        (input  expression, of type INTEGER) defines the projection type and indicates whether or not
                   continental outlines are to be plotted, as follows:

                   •   IABS(JPRJ) defines the projection type, as follows (values less than 1 or greater than 10
                       are treated as 1 or 10, respectively):

                           IABS(JPRJ)  Projection Type

                           1           Stereographic.

                           2           Orthographic.

                           3           Lambert conformal conic.

                           4           Lambert equal area.

                           5           Gnomonic.

                           6           Azimuthal equidistant.

                           7           Satellite view.

                           8           Cylindrical equidistant.

                           9           Mercator.

                           10          Mollweide-type.

                       Using the value 2 causes the EZMAP parameter 'SA' to be zeroed. ('SA',  if  greater  than
                       1.,  says that a satellite-view projection, rather than an orthographic projection, is to
                       be used, and specifies the distance of the satellite from the center  of  the  earth,  in
                       units of earth radii.)

                       Using  the  value  7 causes 'SA' to be examined. If it has a non-zero value, the value is
                       left alone. If it has a zero value, its value is reset to 6.631, which is about right for
                       a satellite in a geosynchronous equatorial orbit.

                   •   The sign of JPRJ, when IOUT is -1, 0, or +1, indicates whether the  continental  outlines
                       are to be plotted or not. See IOUT, below.

       PLAT, PLON, and ROTA
                   (input  expressions, of type REAL) define the origin of the projection and its rotation angle
                   and are used in the same way as they would be in a call to the routine MAPROJ (which see).

       JLTS        (input expression,  of  type  INTEGER),  and  PLM1,  PLM2,  PLM3,  and  PLM4  (input  arrays,
                   dimensioned  2,  of type REAL) specify the rectangular limits of the map. These arguments are
                   used in the same way as they would be in a call to MAPSET (which see), except that JLTS is an
                   integer instead of a character string. IABS(JLTS) may take on the  values  1  through  5,  as
                   follows:

                       IABS(JLTS)  Equivalent character string in a call to MAPSET

                       1           'MA' - maximal area desired.

                       2           'CO' - corner points given in PLM1, PLM2, PLM3, and PLM4.

                       3           'LI' - U/V limits given in PLM1, PLM2, PLM3, and PLM4.

                       4           'AN' - angles given in PLM1, PLM2, PLM3, and PLM4.

                       5           'PO' - edge points given in PLM1, PLM2, PLM3, and PLM4.

                   At  one  time,  the sign of JLTS specified whether or not a line of text was to be written at
                   the bottom of the plot produced. This line may no longer be written and the sign of  JLTS  is
                   therefore ignored.

       JGRD        (input   expression,   of  type  INTEGER)  is  used  in  the  following  way:  The  value  of
                   "MOD(IABS(JGRD),1000)" is the value, in degrees, of the interval at which lines  of  latitude
                   and longitude are to be plotted. If the given interval is zero, grid lines and labels are not
                   plotted.  If  JGRD  is  less  than  zero,  the perimeter is not plotted. Set JGRD to -1000 to
                   suppress both grid lines and perimeter and to +1000 to suppress the grid lines, but leave the
                   perimeter. The value -0 may have a meaning  on  ones'  complement  machines,  but  should  be
                   avoided; use -1000 instead.

       IOUT        (input expression, of type INTEGER) has the value 0 to suppress U.S.  state outlines, and the
                   value  -1  or  +1  to  plot  U.S.  state  outlines.  In both of these cases, the sign of JPRJ
                   indicates whether continental outlines are  to  be  plotted  (JPRJ  positive)  or  not  (JPRJ
                   negative).   Originally,  SUPMAP  recognized  only these values of IOUT; now, if IOUT is less
                   than 0 or greater than 1, the sign of JPRJ is ignored, and IOUT selects an outline group,  as
                   follows:

                       IOUT        Outline group selected

                       -2 or less  'NO' (no outlines)

                       2           'CO' (continental outlines)

                       3           'US' (U.S. state outlines)

                       4           'PS'  (continental  outlines  plus  international  outlines  plus  U.S. state
                                   outlines)

                       5 or greater
                                   'PO' (continental outlines plus international outlines)

                   At one time, the sign of IOUT specified whether or not a line of text was to  be  written  on
                   the print output unit. This may no longer be done.

       IDOT        (input  expression,  of  type  INTEGER)  is a 0 to get continuous outlines, a 1 to get dotted
                   outlines.

       IERR        (output variable, of type INTEGER) is the only output parameter. A non-zero  value  indicates
                   that an error has occurred. The section "ERROR CONDITIONS" lists the possible values of IERR.
