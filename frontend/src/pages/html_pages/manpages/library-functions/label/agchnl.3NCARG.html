</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       AGCHNL - Provides a way for the user to substitute arbitrary character strings for the numeric labels
       generated by Autograph.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        SUBROUTINE AGCHNL (IAXS,VILS,CHRM,MCIM,NCIM,IPXM,
       + CHRE,MCIE,NCIE)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       IAXS        (an input expression of type INTEGER) is the number of the axis being drawn. The values 1, 2,
                   3, and 4 imply the left, right, bottom, and top axes, respectively.

       VILS        (an  input  expression  of type REAL) is the value to be represented by the numeric label, in
                   the label system for the axis. The value of VILS must not be altered.

       CHRM        (an input variable of type CHARACTER), on entry, contains the mantissa of the numeric  label,
                   as it will appear if AGCHNL makes no changes. If the numeric label includes a "times" symbol,
                   it is represented by a blank in CHRM. (See IPXM, below.)  CHRM may be modified.

       MCIM        (an  input  expression  of  type  INTEGER)  is  the  length  of  CHRM - the maximum number of
                   characters that it will hold.  The value of MCIM must not be altered.

       NCIM        (an input variable of type INTEGER), on entry, is the  number  of  meaningful  characters  in
                   CHRM. If CHRM is changed, NCIM should be changed accordingly.

       IPXM        (an input variable of type INTEGER), on entry, is zero if there is no "times" symbol in CHRM;
                   if  it  is  non-zero,  it is the index of a character position in CHRM. If AGCHNL changes the
                   position of the "times" symbol in CHRM, removes it, or adds it, the value  of  IPXM  must  be
                   changed.

       CHRE        (an  input variable of type CHARACTER), on entry, contains the exponent of the numeric label,
                   as it will appear if AGCHNL makes no changes. CHRE may be modified.

       MCIE        (an input expression of type INTEGER)  is  the  length  of  CHRE  -  the  maximum  number  of
                   characters that it will hold.  The value of MCIE must not be altered.

       NCIE        (an  input  variable  of  type  INTEGER), on entry, is the number of meaningful characters in
                   CHRE. If CHRE is changed, NCIE should be changed accordingly.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       This routine is not called by the user program, but by Autograph itself, just after the character  string
       representing  each  numeric label has been generated and just before it is written on the graph. The user
       may change the character string in any desired way. Axes may thereby be labeled using the  names  of  the
       months, Roman numerals, etc.

       Note:  A user version of AGCHNL should not call any other Autograph routine.

</pre><h4><b>ACCESS</b></h4><pre>
       To use AGCHNL, load the NCAR Graphics libraries ncarg, ncarg_gks, and ncarg_c, preferably in that order.
