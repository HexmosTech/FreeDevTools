</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       CPCHHL - Called by Conpack routines as high/low labels are being drawn.  The default version does
       nothing.  A user-written version may be supplied to provide control as the labels are drawn.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       CALL CPCHHL (IFLG)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       IFLG        (INTEGER,  input)  is  positive  if an action is about to be taken, negative if an action has
                   just been completed.  The action in question is defined by the absolute  value  of  IFLG,  as
                   follows:

                   •   The  value 1 implies the determination of the size of the label for a high (by means of a
                       call to PLCHHQ, in the package Plotchar, with ANGD = 360.).

                   •   The value 2 implies the filling of the box around the label for a  high,  which  is  done
                       before the drawing of the label itself.

                   •   The value 3 implies the drawing of the label for a high (by means of a call to PLCHHQ, in
                       the package Plotchar).

                   •   The  value  4  implies  the drawing of the box around the label for a high, which is done
                       after the drawing of the label itself.

                   •   The value 5 implies the determination of the size of the label for a low (by means  of  a
                       call to PLCHHQ, in the package Plotchar, with ANGD = 360.).

                   •   The  value  6  implies  the  filling of the box around the label for a low, which is done
                       before the drawing of the label itself.

                   •   The value 7 implies the drawing of the label for a low (by means of a call to PLCHHQ,  in
                       the package Plotchar).

                   •   The  value  8  implies  the  drawing of the box around the label for a low, which is done
                       after the drawing of the label itself.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       The routine CPCHHL is not to be called by the user. It is called several times by  CPLBAM  and/or  CPLBDR
       while each high or low label is positioned and drawn. The default version of CPCHHL does nothing. A user-
       supplied  replacement  may  change  attributes  such as color and line width (by calling the SPPS routine
       SETUSV or the appropriate GKS routines). The text of the label may be  retrieved  by  means  of  a  "CALL
       CPGETC ('CTM',CVAL)". The text of the label may be changed by means of a "CALL CPSETC ('CTM',CVAL)"; this
       should  only  be  done during a call with IFLG = 1, 3, 5, or 7; if it is done for one of the two values 5
       and 7, it should also be done for the other.  When CPCHHL is called, the parameter 'ZDV' will  have  been
       set to the value of the high or low being labelled; its value may be retrieved and used by CPCHHL.

</pre><h4><b>ACCESS</b></h4><pre>
       To use CPCHHL, load the NCAR Graphics libraries ncarg, ncarg_gks, and ncarg_c, preferably in that order.
