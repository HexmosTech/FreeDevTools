       array_allocate - make sure array has at least n elements allocated

</pre><h4><b>SYNTAX</b></h4><pre>
       <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;libowfat/array.h&gt;</b>

       void* <b>array_allocate</b>(array* <u>x</u>, uint64 <u>membersize</u>, int64 <u>pos</u>);

         array <u>x</u>;
         int64 <u>pos</u>;
         <u>t</u>* p = array_allocate(&amp;<u>x</u>,sizeof(<u>t</u>),<u>pos</u>);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       array_allocate makes sure that enough bytes are allocated in <u>x</u> for at least <u>pos</u>+1 objects of type <u>t</u>. (The
       size of <u>t</u> must be positive; otherwise the effects are undefined.) If not enough bytes are allocated (or <u>x</u>
       is  unallocated),  array_allocate  allocates  more  bytes,  moving  the  dynamically  allocated region if
       necessary.  array_allocate often allocates somewhat more bytes than necessary, to save time later.

       array_allocate then makes sure that the number of bytes initialized covers at least those <u>pos</u>+1  objects.
       If  not  enough  bytes  are initialized, array_allocate initializes more bytes (setting them to 0), up to
       exactly the end of the <u>pos</u>+1st object.

       array_allocate then returns a pointer to the <u>pos</u>+1st  object;  i.e.,  object  number  <u>pos</u>,  with  objects
       numbered  starting  at  0.  This  pointer  can  be  used to change or inspect the object. The pointer can
       continue to be used through subsequent calls to array_get, array_start,  array_length,  and  array_bytes,
       but it must not be used after any other operations on this array.

       If  something  goes  wrong, array_allocate returns 0, setting <b>errno</b> appropriately, without touching <u>x</u>. In
       particular, array_allocate returns 0 if

       •      <u>x</u> has failed, or

       •      <u>pos</u> is negative, or

       •      not enough memory is available.

       array_allocate does <u>not</u> change <u>x</u> to have failed; if you want to do that, use array_fail.

</pre><h4><b>PERFORMANCE</b></h4><pre>
       This function can call realloc when the array needs to be  enlarged.   Under  exceptional  circumstances,
       this  can  lead  to  blocking  the current thread.  It will also zero-fill the newly enlarged part of the
       array, leading to all pages being mapped in by the operating system.  If a small array is enlarged  to  a
       very large array, this can lead to swapping and blocking.
