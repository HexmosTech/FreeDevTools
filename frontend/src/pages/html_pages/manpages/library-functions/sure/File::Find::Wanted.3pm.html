</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       File::Find::Wanted - More obvious wrapper around File::Find

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       Version 1.00

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       File::Find is a great module, except that it doesn't actually find anything.  Its "find()" function walks
       a directory tree and calls a callback function.  Unfortunately, the callback function is deceptively
       called "wanted", which implies that it should return a boolean saying whether you want the file.  That's
       not how it works.

       Most of the time you call "find()", you just want to build a list of files.  There are other modules that
       do this for you, most notably Richard Clamp's great File::Find::Rule, but in many cases, it's overkill,
       and you need to learn a new syntax.

       With the "find_wanted" function, you supply a callback sub and a list of starting directories, but the
       sub actually should return a boolean saying whether you want the file in your list or not.

       To get a list of all files ending in <u>.jpg</u>:

           my @files = find_wanted( sub { -f &amp;&amp; /\.jpg$/ }, $dir );

       For a list of all directories that are not <u>CVS</u> or <u>.svn</u>:

           my @files = find_wanted( sub { -d &amp;&amp; !/^(CVS|\.svn)$/ }, $dir ) );

       It's easy, direct, and simple.

</pre><h4><b>WHY</b> <b>DO</b> <b>THIS?</b></h4><pre>
       The cynical may say "that's just the same as doing this":

           my @files;
           find( sub { push @files, $File::Find::name if -f &amp;&amp; /\.jpg$/ }, $dir );

       Sure it is, but File::Find::Wanted makes it more obvious, and saves a line of code.  That's worth it to
       me.  I'd like it if <b>find_wanted()</b> made its way into the File::Find distro, but for now, this will do.

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>find_wanted(</b> <u><b>&amp;wanted</b></u><b>,</b> <u>@directories</u> <b>)</b>
       Descends through <u>@directories</u>, calling the <u>wanted</u> function as it finds each file.  The function returns a
       list of all the files and directories for which the <u>wanted</u> function returned a true value.

       This is just a wrapper around "File::Find::find()".  See File::Find for details on how to modify its
       behavior.
