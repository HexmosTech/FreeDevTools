</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       File::Find::Object - An object oriented File::Find replacement

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 0.3.9

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use File::Find::Object;
           my $tree = File::Find::Object-&gt;new({}, @targets);

           while (my $r = $tree-&gt;next()) {
               print $r ."\n";
           }

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       File::Find::Object does the same job as File::Find but works like an object and with an iterator. As
       File::Find is not object oriented, one cannot perform multiple searches in the same application. The
       second problem of File::Find is its file processing: after starting its main loop, one cannot easily wait
       for another event and so get the next result.

       With File::Find::Object you can get the next file by calling the <b>next()</b> function, but setting a callback
       is still possible.

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>new</b>
           my $ffo = File::Find::Object-&gt;new( { options }, @targets);

       Create a new File::Find::Object object. @targets is the list of directories or files which the object
       should explore.

       <u>options</u>

       depth
           Boolean - returns the directory content before the directory itself.

       nocrossfs
           Boolean - doesn't continue on filesystems different than the parent.

       followlink
           Boolean - follow symlinks when they point to a directory.

           You can safely set this option to true as File::Find::Object does not follow the link if it detects a
           loop.

       filter
           Function reference - should point to a function returning TRUE or FALSE. This function is called with
           the filename to filter, if the function return FALSE, the file is skipped.

       callback
           Function  reference  -  should  point  to  a  function, which would be called each time a new file is
           returned. The function is called with the current filename as an argument.

   <b>next</b>
       Returns the next file found by the File::Find::Object. It returns undef once the scan is completed.

   <b>item</b>
       Returns the current filename found by the File::Find::Object object, i.e:  the  last  value  returned  by
       <b>next()</b>.

   <b>next_obj</b>
       Like  <b>next()</b>  only returns the result as a convenient File::Find::Object::Result object. "$ff-&gt;next()" is
       equivalent to "$ff-&gt;next_obj()-&gt;path()".

   <b>item_obj</b>
       Like <b>item()</b> only returns the result as a convenient File::Find::Object::Result object.  "$ff-&gt;item()"  is
       equivalent to "$ff-&gt;item_obj()-&gt;path()".

   <b>$ff-&gt;set_traverse_to([@children])</b>
       Sets the children to traverse to from the current node. Useful for pruning items to traverse.

       Accepts a single array reference.

       Example:

           $ff-&gt;set_traverse_to([ grep { ! /\A\./ } @{ $ff-&gt;get_traverse_to }]);

   <b>$ff-&gt;prune()</b>
       Prunes the current directory. Equivalent to $ff-&gt;set_traverse_to([]).

   <b>[@children]</b> <b>=</b> <b>$ff-&gt;get_traverse_to()</b>
       Retrieves the children that will be traversed to. Returns a single array reference.

       (Example under "set_traverse_to").

   <b>[@files]</b> <b>=</b> <b>$ff-&gt;get_current_node_files_list()</b>
       Gets all the files that appear in the current directory. This value remains constant for every node, even
       after  traversal  or  calls  to  set_traverse_to()  and is useful to use as the basis of the argument for
       set_traverse_to().

       Returns a single array reference.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       No bugs are known, but it doesn't mean there aren't any.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       There's   an   article   about   this    module    in    the    Perl    Advent    Calendar    of    2006:
       &lt;<a href="http://perladvent.pm.org/2006/2/">http://perladvent.pm.org/2006/2/</a>&gt;.

       File::Find is the core module for traversing files in perl, which has several limitations.

       File::Next,  File::Find::Iterator,  File::Walker  and the unmaintained File::FTS are alternatives to this
       module.
