</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       File::Find - Traverse a directory tree.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use File::Find;
           find(\&amp;wanted, @directories_to_search);
           sub wanted { ... }

           use File::Find;
           finddepth(\&amp;wanted, @directories_to_search);
           sub wanted { ... }

           use File::Find;
           find({ wanted =&gt; \&amp;process, follow =&gt; 1 }, '.');

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       These are functions for searching through directory trees doing work on each file found similar to the
       Unix <b><a href="../man1/find.1.html">find</a></b>(1) command.  "File::Find" exports two functions, "find" and "finddepth".  They work similarly
       but have subtle differences.

       <b>find</b>
             find(\&amp;wanted,  @directories);
             find(\%options, @directories);

           find()  does  a depth-first search over the given @directories in the order they are given.  For each
           file or directory found, it calls the &amp;wanted subroutine.  (See below for details on how to  use  the
           &amp;wanted  function).   Additionally, for each directory found, it will chdir() into that directory and
           continue the search, invoking the &amp;wanted function on each file or subdirectory in the directory.

       <b>finddepth</b>
             finddepth(\&amp;wanted,  @directories);
             finddepth(\%options, @directories);

           finddepth() works just like find() except that it invokes the &amp;wanted function for a directory  <u>after</u>
           invoking  it  for  the  directory's  contents.   It  does a postorder traversal instead of a preorder
           traversal, working from the bottom of the directory tree up where find() works from the  top  of  the
           tree down.

       Despite the name of the finddepth() function, both find() and finddepth() perform a depth-first search of
       the directory hierarchy.

   <b>%options</b>
       The  first  argument  to  find() is either a code reference to your &amp;wanted function, or a hash reference
       describing the operations to be performed for each file.  The code reference is described in "The  wanted
       function" below.

       Here are the possible <b>keys</b> for the hash:

       "wanted"
           The  value  should  be  a  code reference.  This code reference is described in "The wanted function"
           below. The &amp;wanted subroutine is mandatory.

       "bydepth"
           Reports the name of a directory  only  AFTER  all  its  entries  have  been  reported.   Entry  point
           finddepth() is a shortcut for specifying "{ bydepth =&gt; 1 }" in the first argument of find().

       "preprocess"
           The  value  should  be  a  code  reference.  This  code  reference  is used to preprocess the current
           directory. The name of the currently processed directory is in $File::Find::dir.  Your  preprocessing
           function  is  called  after  readdir(),  but  before the loop that calls the wanted() function. It is
           called with a list of strings (actually file/directory names) and is expected to  return  a  list  of
           strings.  The  code  can  be used to sort the file/directory names alphabetically, numerically, or to
           filter out directory entries based on their name alone. When "follow" or "follow_fast" are in effect,
           "preprocess" is a no-op.

       "postprocess"
           The value should be a code reference. It is invoked  just  before  leaving  the  currently  processed
           directory.  It  is  called in void context with no arguments. The name of the current directory is in
           $File::Find::dir. This hook is handy for summarizing a directory, such as calculating its disk usage.
           When "follow" or "follow_fast" are in effect, "postprocess" is a no-op.

       "follow"
           Causes symbolic links to be followed. Since  directory  trees  with  symbolic  links  (followed)  may
           contain  files  more  than once and may even have cycles, a hash has to be built up with an entry for
           each file.  This might be expensive  both  in  space  and  time  for  a  large  directory  tree.  See
           "follow_fast" and "follow_skip" below.  If either "follow" or "follow_fast" is in effect:

           •   It  is  guaranteed that an "lstat" has been called before the user's wanted() function is called.
               This enables fast file checks involving "_".   Note  that  this  guarantee  no  longer  holds  if
               "follow" or "follow_fast" are not set.

           •   There  is a variable $File::Find::fullname which holds the absolute pathname of the file with all
               symbolic links resolved.  If the link is a dangling symbolic link, then fullname will be  set  to
               "undef".

       "follow_fast"
           This  is  similar  to  "follow"  except that it may report some files more than once.  It does detect
           cycles, however.  Since only symbolic links have to be hashed, this is much cheaper both in space and
           time.  If processing a file more than once (by the user's  wanted()  function)  is  worse  than  just
           taking time, the option "follow" should be used.

       "follow_skip"
           "follow_skip==1",  which  is the default, causes all files which are neither directories nor symbolic
           links to be ignored if they are about to be processed a second time. If a  directory  or  a  symbolic
           link are about to be processed a second time, "File::Find" dies.

           "follow_skip==0" causes "File::Find" to die if any file is about to be processed a second time.

           "follow_skip==2"  causes  "File::Find"  to  ignore any duplicate files and directories but to proceed
           normally otherwise.

       "dangling_symlinks"
           Specifies what to do with symbolic links whose target doesn't exist.  If true and a  code  reference,
           will be called with the symbolic link name and the directory it lives in as arguments.  Otherwise, if
           true  and  warnings  are on, a warning of the form "symbolic_link_name is a dangling symbolic link\n"
           will be issued.  If false, the dangling symbolic link will be silently ignored.

       "no_chdir"
           Does not chdir() to each directory as it recurses. The wanted() function will need  to  be  aware  of
           this, of course. In this case, $_ will be the same as $File::Find::name.

       "untaint"
           If  find  is  used  in taint-mode ("-T" command line switch or "if EUID != UID" or "if EGID != GID"),
           then internally directory names have to be untainted before they can be "chdir"'d to.  Therefore they
           are checked against a regular expression "untaint_pattern".  Note that all names passed to the user's
           wanted() function are still tainted. If this option is used while not in taint-mode, "untaint"  is  a
           no-op.

       "untaint_pattern"
           See   above.  This  should  be  set  using  the  "qr"  quoting  operator.   The  default  is  set  to
           "qr|^([-+@\w./]+)$|".  Note that the parentheses are vital.

       "untaint_skip"
           If set, a directory which fails the "untaint_pattern" is skipped, including all its  sub-directories.
           The default is to "die" in such a case.

   <b>The</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>function</b>
       The wanted() function does whatever verifications you want on each file and directory.  Note that despite
       its  name, the wanted() function is a generic callback function, and does <b>not</b> tell "File::Find" if a file
       is "wanted" or not.  In fact, its return value is ignored.

       The "wanted" function takes no arguments but rather does its work through a collection of variables.

       $File::Find::dir is the current directory name,
       $_ is the current filename within that directory
       $File::Find::name is the complete pathname to the file.

       The above variables have all been localized and may be changed without  affecting  data  outside  of  the
       wanted function.

       For example, when examining the file <u>/some/path/foo.ext</u> you will have:

           $File::Find::dir  = /some/path/
           $_                = foo.ext
           $File::Find::name = /some/path/foo.ext

       You  are chdir()'d to $File::Find::dir when the function is called, unless "no_chdir" was specified. Note
       that when changing to directories is in effect, the  root  directory  (<u>/</u>)  is  a  somewhat  special  case
       inasmuch   as   the   concatenation   of   $File::Find::dir,  '/'  and  $_  is  not  literally  equal  to
       $File::Find::name. The table below summarizes all variants:

                     $File::Find::name  $File::Find::dir  $_
        default      /                  /                 .
        no_chdir=&gt;0  <a href="file:/etc">/etc</a>               /                 etc
                     /etc/x             <a href="file:/etc">/etc</a>              x

        no_chdir=&gt;1  /                  /                 /
                     <a href="file:/etc">/etc</a>               /                 <a href="file:/etc">/etc</a>
                     /etc/x             <a href="file:/etc">/etc</a>              /etc/x

       When "follow" or "follow_fast" are in effect, there is also a $File::Find::fullname.   The  function  may
       set   $File::Find::prune  to  prune  the  tree  unless  "bydepth"  was  specified.   Unless  "follow"  or
       "follow_fast" is specified, for compatibility reasons ("find.pl", find2perl) there are  in  addition  the
       following    globals    available:    $File::Find::topdir,    $File::Find::topdev,   $File::Find::topino,
       $File::Find::topmode and $File::Find::topnlink.

       This library is useful for the "find2perl" tool (distributed with the App::find2perl CPAN module),  which
       when fed:

         find2perl / -name .nfs\* -mtime +7 \
           -exec rm -f {} \; -o -fstype nfs -prune

       produces something like:

        sub wanted {
           /^\.nfs.*\z/s &amp;&amp;
           (($dev, $ino, $mode, $nlink, $uid, $gid) = lstat($_)) &amp;&amp;
           int(-M _) &gt; 7 &amp;&amp;
           unlink($_)
           ||
           ($nlink || (($dev, $ino, $mode, $nlink, $uid, $gid) = lstat($_))) &amp;&amp;
           $dev &lt; 0 &amp;&amp;
           ($File::Find::prune = 1);
        }

       Notice the "_" in the above "int(-M _)": the "_" is a magical filehandle that caches the information from
       the preceding stat(), lstat(), or filetest.

       Here's another interesting wanted function.  It will find all symbolic links that don't resolve:

           sub wanted {
                -l &amp;&amp; !-e &amp;&amp; print "bogus link: $File::Find::name\n";
           }

       Note  that you may mix directories and (non-directory) files in the list of directories to be searched by
       the wanted() function.

           find(\&amp;wanted, "./foo", "./bar", "./baz/epsilon");

       In the example above, no file in <u>./baz/</u> other than <u>./baz/epsilon</u> will be evaluated by wanted().

       See also the script "pfind" on CPAN for a nice application of this module.

</pre><h4><b>WARNINGS</b></h4><pre>
       If you run your program with the "-w" switch, or if you use the "warnings" pragma, File::Find will report
       warnings for several weird situations. You can disable these warnings by putting the statement

           no warnings 'File::Find';

       in the appropriate scope. See warnings for more info about lexical warnings.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
       $dont_use_nlink
           You can set the variable $File::Find::dont_use_nlink to 0 if you are  sure  the  filesystem  you  are
           scanning reflects the number of subdirectories in the parent directory's "nlink" count.

           If you do set $File::Find::dont_use_nlink to 0, you may notice an improvement in speed at the risk of
           not recursing into subdirectories if a filesystem doesn't populate "nlink" as expected.

           $File::Find::dont_use_nlink now defaults to 1 on all platforms.

       Symlinks
           Be  aware  that  the option to follow symbolic links can be dangerous.  Depending on the structure of
           the directory tree (including symbolic links to directories) you might traverse  a  given  (physical)
           directory  more  than  once  (only if "follow_fast" is in effect).  Furthermore, deleting or changing
           files in a symbolically linked directory might cause very unpleasant surprises, since you  delete  or
           change files in an unknown directory.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       "File::Find" used to produce incorrect results if called recursively.  During the development of perl 5.8
       this bug was fixed.  The first fixed version of "File::Find" was 1.01.
