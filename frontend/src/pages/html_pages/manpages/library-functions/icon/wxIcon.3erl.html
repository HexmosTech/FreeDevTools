       wxIcon - Functions for wxIcon class

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       An icon is a small rectangular bitmap usually used for denoting a minimized application.

       It  differs  from  a <u>wxBitmap</u> in always having a mask associated with it for transparent drawing. On some
       platforms, icons and bitmaps are implemented identically, since there is no real  distinction  between  a
       <u>wxBitmap</u>  with  a  mask  and  an  icon;  and  there is no specific icon format on some platforms (X-based
       applications usually standardize on XPMs for small bitmaps and icons). However, some platforms  (such  as
       Windows) make the distinction, so a separate class is provided.

       Remark:  It  is  usually desirable to associate a pertinent icon with a frame. Icons can also be used for
       other purposes, for example with <u>wxTreeCtrl</u> and <u>wxListCtrl</u>. Icons have  different  formats  on  different
       platforms  therefore  separate  icons  will  usually be created for the different environments. Platform-
       specific methods for creating a <u>wxIcon</u>  structure  are  catered  for,  and  this  is  an  occasion  where
       conditional  compilation  will  probably be required. Note that a new icon must be created for every time
       the icon is to be used for a new window. In Windows, the icon will not be reloaded if it has already been
       used. An icon allocated to a frame will be deleted when the frame is deleted. For more information please
       see overview_bitmap.

       Predefined objects (include wx.hrl): ?wxNullIcon

       See: Overview bitmap, Overview bitmap, <u>wxIconBundle</u>, <u>wxDC:drawIcon/3</u>, <u>wxCursor</u>

       This class is derived (and can use functions) from: <u>wxBitmap</u>

       wxWidgets docs: wxIcon

</pre><h4><b>DATA</b> <b>TYPES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>wxIcon()</b> = wx:wx_object()

</pre><h4><b>EXPORTS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>new()</b> <b>-&gt;</b> <b>wxIcon()</b>

              Default ctor.

              Constructs an icon object with  no  data;  an  assignment  or  another  member  function  such  as
              <u>wxBitmap:loadFile/3</u> must be called subsequently.

       <b>new(Name)</b> <b>-&gt;</b> <b>wxIcon()</b>

       <b>new(Icon)</b> <b>-&gt;</b> <b>wxIcon()</b>

              Types:

                 Icon = wxIcon()

              Copy ctor.

       <b>new(Name,</b> <b>Options</b> <b>::</b> <b>[Option])</b> <b>-&gt;</b> <b>wxIcon()</b>

              Types:

                 Name = unicode:chardata()
                 Option =
                     {type, wx:wx_enum()} |
                     {desiredWidth, integer()} |
                     {desiredHeight, integer()}

              Loads an icon from a file or resource.

              See: <u>wxBitmap:loadFile/3</u>

       <b>copyFromBitmap(This,</b> <b>Bmp)</b> <b>-&gt;</b> <b>ok</b>

              Types:

                 This = wxIcon()
                 Bmp = wxBitmap:wxBitmap()

              Copies <u>bmp</u> bitmap to this icon.

              Under MS Windows the bitmap must have mask colour set.

              See: <u>wxBitmap:loadFile/3</u>

       <b>destroy(This</b> <b>::</b> <b>wxIcon())</b> <b>-&gt;</b> <b>ok</b>

              Destructor.

              See overview_refcount_destruct for more info.

              If  the  application omits to delete the icon explicitly, the icon will be destroyed automatically
              by wxWidgets when the application exits.

              Warning: Do not delete an icon that is selected into a memory device context.
