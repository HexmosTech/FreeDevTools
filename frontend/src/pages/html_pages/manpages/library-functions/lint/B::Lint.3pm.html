</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       B::Lint - Perl lint

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       perl -MO=Lint[,OPTIONS] foo.pl

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The B::Lint module is equivalent to an extended version of the <b>-w</b> option of <b>perl</b>. It is named after the
       program <u>lint</u> which carries out a similar process for C programs.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>LINT</b> <b>CHECKS</b></h4><pre>
       Option words are separated by commas (not whitespace) and follow the usual conventions of compiler
       backend options. Following any options (indicated by a leading <b>-</b>) come lint check arguments. Each such
       argument (apart from the special <b>all</b> and <b>none</b> options) is a word representing one possible lint check
       (turning on that check) or is <b>no-foo</b> (turning off that check). Before processing the check arguments, a
       standard list of checks is turned on. Later options override earlier ones. Available options are:

       <b>magic-diamond</b>
               Produces  a  warning  whenever  the  magic  "&lt;&gt;" readline is used. Internally it uses perl's two-
               argument open which itself treats filenames with special characters specially. This  could  allow
               interestingly named files to have unexpected effects when reading.

                 % touch 'rm *|'
                 % perl -pe 1

               The  above  creates  a  file named "rm *|". When perl opens it with "&lt;&gt;" it actually executes the
               shell program "rm *". This makes "&lt;&gt;" dangerous to use carelessly.

       <b>context</b> Produces a warning whenever an array is used in an implicit scalar context. For example, both  of
               the lines

                   $foo = length(@bar);
                   $foo = @bar;

               will elicit a warning. Using an explicit <b>scalar()</b> silences the warning. For example,

                   $foo = scalar(@bar);

       <b>implicit-read</b> and <b>implicit-write</b>
               These  options  produce a warning whenever an operation implicitly reads or (respectively) writes
               to one of Perl's special variables.  For example, <b>implicit-read</b> will warn about these:

                   /foo/;

               and <b>implicit-write</b> will warn about these:

                   s/foo/bar/;

               Both <b>implicit-read</b> and <b>implicit-write</b> warn about this:

                   for (@a) { ... }

       <b>bare-subs</b>
               This option warns whenever a bareword is implicitly quoted, but is also the name of a  subroutine
               in the current package. Typical mistakes that it will trap are:

                   use constant foo =&gt; 'bar';
                   @a = ( foo =&gt; 1 );
                   $b{foo} = 2;

               Neither of these will do what a naive user would expect.

               Notice:  Perl  5.22.0  does  not report "foo" in $b{foo} as BARE token anymore. Therefore B::Lint
               test        is        not        reliable        here.         See         CPAN         RT#101115
               &lt;https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=101115&gt;.

       <b>dollar-underscore</b>
               This option warns whenever $_ is used either explicitly anywhere or as the implicit argument of a
               <b>print</b> statement.

       <b>private-names</b>
               This  option  warns  on  each use of any variable, subroutine or method name that lives in a non-
               current package but begins with an underscore ("_"). Warnings aren't issued for the special  case
               of the single character name "_" by itself (e.g. $_ and @_).

       <b>undefined-subs</b>
               This  option  warns  whenever  an  undefined  subroutine is invoked.  This option will only catch
               explicitly invoked subroutines such as "foo()" and not indirect invocations such as  "&amp;$subref()"
               or  "$obj-&gt;meth()".  Note that some programs or modules delay definition of subs until runtime by
               means of the AUTOLOAD mechanism.

       <b>regexp-variables</b>
               This option warns whenever one of the regexp variables "$`", $&amp; or "$'" is used.  Any  occurrence
               of  any  of  these  variables  in  your  program can slow your whole program down. See perlre for
               details.

       <b>all</b>     Turn all warnings on.

       <b>none</b>    Turn all warnings off.

</pre><h4><b>NON</b> <b>LINT-CHECK</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-u</b> <b>Package</b>
               Normally, Lint only checks the main code of the program together with all subs defined in package
               main. The <b>-u</b> option lets you include other package names whose subs are then checked by Lint.

</pre><h4><b>EXTENDING</b> <b>LINT</b></h4><pre>
       Lint can be extended by with plugins. Lint uses Module::Pluggable to find available plugins. Plugins  are
       expected but not required to inform Lint of which checks they are adding.

       The  "B::Lint-&gt;register_plugin(  MyPlugin  =&gt;  \@new_checks )" method adds the list of @new_checks to the
       list of valid checks. If your module wasn't loaded by Module::Pluggable then your class name is added  to
       the list of plugins.

       You  must  create  a  "match(  \%checks  )" method in your plugin class or one of its parents. It will be
       called on every op as a regular method call with a hash ref of checks as its parameter.

       The class methods "B::Lint-&gt;file" and "B::Lint-&gt;line" contain the current filename and line number.

         package Sample;
         use B::Lint;
         B::Lint-&gt;register_plugin( Sample =&gt; [ 'good_taste' ] );

         sub match {
             my ( $op, $checks_href ) = shift @_;
             if ( $checks_href-&gt;{good_taste} ) {
                 ...
             }
         }

       strict oo
       unchecked system calls
       more tests, validate against older perls
