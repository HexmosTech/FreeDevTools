</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       fputc — put a byte on a stream

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/stdio.h">stdio.h</a>&gt;

       int fputc(int <u>c</u>, FILE *<u>stream</u>);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  functionality  described  on  this  reference  page is aligned with the ISO C standard. Any conflict
       between the requirements described  here  and  the  ISO C  standard  is  unintentional.  This  volume  of
       POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO C standard.

       The  <u>fputc</u>()  function  shall write the byte specified by <u>c</u> (converted to an <b>unsigned</b> <b>char</b>) to the output
       stream pointed to by <u>stream</u>, at the position indicated by the associated file-position indicator for  the
       stream  (if  defined),  and  shall  advance  the  indicator  appropriately.   If  the file cannot support
       positioning requests, or if the stream was opened with append mode, the byte shall  be  appended  to  the
       output stream.

       The  last data modification and last file status change timestamps of the file shall be marked for update
       between the successful execution of <u>fputc</u>() and the next successful completion of a call to  <u>fflush</u>()  or
       <u>fclose</u>() on the same stream or a call to <u>exit</u>() or <u>abort</u>().

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       Upon  successful  completion,  <u>fputc</u>()  shall return the value it has written. Otherwise, it shall return
       EOF, the error indicator for the stream shall be set, and <u>errno</u> shall be set to indicate the error.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>fputc</u>() function shall fail if either the <u>stream</u> is unbuffered or the <u>stream</u>'s  buffer  needs  to  be
       flushed, and:

       <b>EAGAIN</b> The  O_NONBLOCK  flag  is  set  for  the file descriptor underlying <u>stream</u> and the thread would be
              delayed in the write operation.

       <b>EBADF</b>  The file descriptor underlying <u>stream</u> is not a valid file descriptor open for writing.

       <b>EFBIG</b>  An attempt was made to write to a file that exceeds the maximum file size.

       <b>EFBIG</b>  An attempt was made to write to a file that exceeds the file size limit of the process.

       <b>EFBIG</b>  The file is a regular file and an attempt was made to write at or beyond the offset maximum.

       <b>EINTR</b>  The write operation was terminated due to the receipt of a signal, and no data was transferred.

       <b>EIO</b>    A physical I/O error has occurred, or the process is  a  member  of  a  background  process  group
              attempting to write to its controlling terminal, TOSTOP is set, the calling thread is not blocking
              SIGTTOU,  the  process  is not ignoring SIGTTOU, and the process group of the process is orphaned.
              This error may also be returned under implementation-defined conditions.

       <b>ENOSPC</b> There was no free space remaining on the device containing the file.

       <b>EPIPE</b>  An attempt is made to write to a pipe or FIFO that is not open  for  reading  by  any  process.  A
              SIGPIPE signal shall also be sent to the thread.

       The <u>fputc</u>() function may fail if:

       <b>ENOMEM</b> Insufficient storage space is available.

       <b>ENXIO</b>  A  request  was  made  of a nonexistent device, or the request was outside the capabilities of the
              device.
