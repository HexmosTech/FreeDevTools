</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Template::Alloy::Stream - Stream role - allows for playing out the AST and printing straight to file
       handle

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The Template::Alloy::Stream role works similar to the PLAY role, but instead of accumulating the data, it
       prints it as soon as it is available.

       All directives are supported except for the CLEAR directive which is meaningless.

       Most configuration items are supported - except for the TRIM directive which cannot be used because the
       output is not buffered into a variable that can be trimmed.

       The WRAPPER directive is still supported - but it essentially turns off STREAM as the content must be
       generated before playing the WRAPPER templates.

</pre><h4><b>ROLE</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       "stream_tree"
           Similar to play_tree from the Play role, but prints output to the screen as soon as it is ready.
