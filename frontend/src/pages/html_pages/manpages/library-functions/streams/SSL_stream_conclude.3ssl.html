       SSL_stream_conclude - conclude the sending part of a QUIC stream

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        #include &lt;openssl/ssl.h&gt;

        __owur int SSL_stream_conclude(SSL *s, uint64_t flags);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>SSL_stream_conclude()</b> signals the normal end-of-stream condition for the send part of a QUIC stream. If
       called on a QUIC connection SSL object with an associated default stream, it signals the end of the
       single stream to the peer.

       Any data already queued for transmission via a call to <b>SSL_write()</b> will still be written in a reliable
       manner before the end-of-stream is signalled, assuming the connection remains healthy. This function can
       be thought of as appending a logical end-of-stream marker after any data which has previously been
       written to the stream via calls to <b>SSL_write()</b>. Further attempts to call <b>SSL_write()</b> after calling this
       function will fail.

       When calling this on a stream, the receive part of the stream remains unaffected, and the peer may
       continue to send data until it also signals the end of the stream. Thus, <b>SSL_read()</b> can still be used.

       <u>flags</u> is reserved and should be set to 0.

       Only the first call to this function has any effect for a given stream; subsequent calls are no-ops. This
       is considered a success case.

       This function is not supported on an object other than a QUIC stream SSL object.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUES</b></h4><pre>
       Returns 1 on success and 0 on failure.

       Returns 0 if called on an SSL object not representing a QUIC stream.
