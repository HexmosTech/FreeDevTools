       SSL_get_stream_id, SSL_get_stream_type, SSL_STREAM_TYPE_NONE, SSL_STREAM_TYPE_READ,
       SSL_STREAM_TYPE_WRITE, SSL_STREAM_TYPE_BIDI, SSL_is_stream_local - get QUIC stream ID and stream type
       information

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        #include &lt;openssl/ssl.h&gt;

        uint64_t SSL_get_stream_id(SSL *ssl);

        #define SSL_STREAM_TYPE_NONE
        #define SSL_STREAM_TYPE_BIDI
        #define SSL_STREAM_TYPE_READ
        #define SSL_STREAM_TYPE_WRITE
        int SSL_get_stream_type(SSL *ssl);

        int SSL_is_stream_local(SSL *ssl);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>SSL_get_stream_id()</b> function returns the QUIC stream ID for a QUIC stream SSL object, or for a QUIC
       connection SSL object which has a default stream attached.

       The <b>SSL_get_stream_type()</b> function identifies what operations can be performed on the stream, and returns
       one of the following values:

       <b>SSL_STREAM_TYPE_NONE</b>
           The SSL object is a QUIC connection SSL object without a default stream attached.

       <b>SSL_STREAM_TYPE_BIDI</b>
           The  SSL  object  is a non-QUIC SSL object, or is a QUIC stream object (or QUIC connection SSL object
           with a default stream attached), and that stream is a bidirectional QUIC stream.

       <b>SSL_STREAM_TYPE_READ</b>
           The SSL object is a QUIC stream  object  (or  QUIC  connection  SSL  object  with  a  default  stream
           attached),  and  that  stream is a unidirectional QUIC stream which was initiated by the remote peer;
           thus, it can be read from, but not written to.

       <b>SSL_STREAM_TYPE_WRITE</b>
           The SSL object is a QUIC stream  object  (or  QUIC  connection  SSL  object  with  a  default  stream
           attached),  and  that  stream  is  a  unidirectional  QUIC  stream  which  was initiated by the local
           application; thus, it can be written to, but not read from.

       The <b>SSL_is_stream_local()</b> function determines whether a stream was locally created.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       While QUICv1 assigns specific meaning to the low two bits of a QUIC stream ID, QUIC stream IDs in  future
       versions  of  QUIC  are not required to have the same semantics. Do not determine stream properties using
       these bits. Instead, use <b>SSL_get_stream_type()</b> to determine the stream type and <b>SSL_get_stream_is_local()</b>
       to determine the stream initiator.

       The <b>SSL_get_stream_type()</b> identifies the type of a QUIC stream  based  on  its  identity,  and  does  not
       indicate whether an operation can currently be successfully performed on a stream. For example, you might
       locally   initiate   a   unidirectional  stream,  write  to  it,  and  then  conclude  the  stream  using
       <b><a href="../man3/SSL_stream_conclude.3.html">SSL_stream_conclude</a></b>(3), meaning that it can no longer be  written  to,  but  <b>SSL_get_stream_type()</b>  would
       still  return  <b>SSL_STREAM_TYPE_WRITE</b>.  The value returned by <b>SSL_get_stream_type()</b> does not vary over the
       lifespan of a stream.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>SSL_get_stream_id()</b> returns a QUIC stream ID, or <b>UINT64_MAX</b> if called on an SSL object  which  is  not  a
       QUIC  SSL  object,  or  if called on a QUIC connection SSL object without a default stream attached. Note
       that valid QUIC stream IDs are always below 2**62.

       <b>SSL_get_stream_type()</b> returns one of the <b>SSL_STREAM_TYPE</b> values.

       <b>SSL_is_stream_local()</b> returns 1 if called on a QUIC stream SSL object which represents a stream which was
       locally initiated. It returns 0 if called on a QUIC stream SSL object which represents a stream which was
       remotely initiated by a peer, and -1 if called on any other kind of SSL object.
