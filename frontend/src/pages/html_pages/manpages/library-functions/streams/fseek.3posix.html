</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       fseek, fseeko — reposition a file-position indicator in a stream

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/stdio.h">stdio.h</a>&gt;

       int fseek(FILE *<u>stream</u>, long <u>offset</u>, int <u>whence</u>);
       int fseeko(FILE *<u>stream</u>, off_t <u>offset</u>, int <u>whence</u>);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  functionality  described  on  this  reference  page is aligned with the ISO C standard. Any conflict
       between the requirements described  here  and  the  ISO C  standard  is  unintentional.  This  volume  of
       POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO C standard.

       The  <u>fseek</u>()  function  shall  set the file-position indicator for the stream pointed to by <u>stream</u>.  If a
       read or write error occurs, the error indicator for the stream shall be set and <u>fseek</u>() fails.

       The new position, measured in bytes from the beginning of the file, shall be obtained by adding <u>offset</u> to
       the position specified by <u>whence</u>.  The specified point is the beginning of the  file  for  SEEK_SET,  the
       current value of the file-position indicator for SEEK_CUR, or end-of-file for SEEK_END.

       If the stream is to be used with wide-character input/output functions, the application shall ensure that
       <u>offset</u>  is  either  0  or a value returned by an earlier call to <u>ftell</u>() on the same stream and <u>whence</u> is
       SEEK_SET.

       A successful call to <u>fseek</u>() shall clear the end-of-file indicator for the stream and undo any effects of
       <u>ungetc</u>() and <u>ungetwc</u>() on the same stream. After an <u>fseek</u>() call, the next operation on an update  stream
       may be either input or output.

       If  the  most recent operation, other than <u>ftell</u>(), on a given stream is <u>fflush</u>(), the file offset in the
       underlying open file description shall be adjusted to reflect the location specified by <u>fseek</u>().

       The <u>fseek</u>() function shall allow the file-position indicator to be set beyond the end of existing data in
       the file. If data is later written at this point, subsequent reads of data in the gap shall return  bytes
       with the value 0 until data is actually written into the gap.

       The  behavior  of <u>fseek</u>() on devices which are incapable of seeking is implementation-defined.  The value
       of the file offset associated with such a device is undefined.

       If the stream is writable and buffered data had not been written to the underlying  file,  <u>fseek</u>()  shall
       cause  the  unwritten  data  to be written to the file and shall mark the last data modification and last
       file status change timestamps of the file for update.

       In a locale with  state-dependent  encoding,  whether  <u>fseek</u>()  restores  the  stream's  shift  state  is
       implementation-defined.

       The  <u>fseeko</u>()  function shall be equivalent to the <u>fseek</u>() function except that the <u>offset</u> argument is of
       type <b>off_t</b>.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>fseek</u>() and <u>fseeko</u>() functions shall return 0 if they succeed.

       Otherwise, they shall return -1 and set <u>errno</u> to indicate the error.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>fseek</u>() and <u>fseeko</u>() functions shall fail if, either the <u>stream</u> is unbuffered or the <u>stream</u>'s  buffer
       needed  to  be flushed, and the call to <u>fseek</u>() or <u>fseeko</u>() causes an underlying <u>lseek</u>() or <u>write</u>() to be
       invoked, and:

       <b>EAGAIN</b> The O_NONBLOCK flag is set for the file descriptor and the thread would be delayed  in  the  write
              operation.

       <b>EBADF</b>  The  file  descriptor  underlying  the  stream file is not open for writing or the stream's buffer
              needed to be flushed and the file is not open.

       <b>EFBIG</b>  An attempt was made to write a file that exceeds the maximum file size.

       <b>EFBIG</b>  An attempt was made to write a file that exceeds the file size limit of the process.

       <b>EFBIG</b>  The file is a regular file and an attempt was made to  write  at  or  beyond  the  offset  maximum
              associated with the corresponding stream.

       <b>EINTR</b>  The write operation was terminated due to the receipt of a signal, and no data was transferred.

       <b>EINVAL</b> The  <u>whence</u>  argument is invalid. The resulting file-position indicator would be set to a negative
              value.

       <b>EIO</b>    A physical I/O error has occurred, or the process is  a  member  of  a  background  process  group
              attempting  to perform a <u>write</u>() to its controlling terminal, TOSTOP is set, the calling thread is
              not blocking SIGTTOU, the process is not ignoring SIGTTOU, and the process group of the process is
              orphaned.  This error may also be returned under implementation-defined conditions.

       <b>ENOSPC</b> There was no free space remaining on the device containing the file.

       <b>EOVERFLOW</b>
              For <u>fseek</u>(), the resulting file offset would be a value which cannot be represented  correctly  in
              an object of type <b>long</b>.

       <b>EOVERFLOW</b>
              For  <u>fseeko</u>(), the resulting file offset would be a value which cannot be represented correctly in
              an object of type <b>off_t</b>.

       <b>EPIPE</b>  An attempt was made to write to a pipe or FIFO that is not open for  reading  by  any  process;  a
              SIGPIPE signal shall also be sent to the thread.

       <b>ESPIPE</b> The file descriptor underlying <u>stream</u> is associated with a pipe, FIFO, or socket.

       The <u>fseek</u>() and <u>fseeko</u>() functions may fail if:

       <b>ENXIO</b>  A  request  was  made  of a nonexistent device, or the request was outside the capabilities of the
              device.
