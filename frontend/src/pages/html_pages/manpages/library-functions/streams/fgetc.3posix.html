</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       fgetc — get a byte from a stream

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/stdio.h">stdio.h</a>&gt;

       int fgetc(FILE *<u>stream</u>);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  functionality  described  on  this  reference  page is aligned with the ISO C standard. Any conflict
       between the requirements described  here  and  the  ISO C  standard  is  unintentional.  This  volume  of
       POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO C standard.

       If  the  end-of-file  indicator  for  the input stream pointed to by <u>stream</u> is not set and a next byte is
       present, the <u>fgetc</u>() function shall obtain the next byte as an <b>unsigned</b> <b>char</b> converted to  an  <b>int</b>,  from
       the  input stream pointed to by <u>stream</u>, and advance the associated file position indicator for the stream
       (if defined). Since <u>fgetc</u>() operates on bytes, reading a character consisting of multiple bytes  (or  ``a
       multi-byte character'') may require multiple calls to <u>fgetc</u>().

       The  <u>fgetc</u>()  function  may  mark  the  last data access timestamp of the file associated with <u>stream</u> for
       update. The last data access timestamp shall be marked for update by the first  successful  execution  of
       <u>fgetc</u>(),  <u>fgets</u>(),  <u>fread</u>(), <u>fscanf</u>(), <u>getc</u>(), <u>getchar</u>(), <u>getdelim</u>(), <u>getline</u>(), <u>gets</u>(), or <u>scanf</u>() using
       <u>stream</u> that returns data not supplied by a prior call to <u>ungetc</u>().

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       Upon successful completion, <u>fgetc</u>() shall return the next byte  from  the  input  stream  pointed  to  by
       <u>stream</u>.  If the end-of-file indicator for the stream is set, or if the stream is at end-of-file, the end-
       of-file  indicator  for the stream shall be set and <u>fgetc</u>() shall return EOF. If a read error occurs, the
       error indicator for the stream shall be set, <u>fgetc</u>() shall return EOF, and shall set  <u>errno</u>  to  indicate
       the error.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>fgetc</u>() function shall fail if data needs to be read and:

       <b>EAGAIN</b> The  O_NONBLOCK  flag  is  set  for  the file descriptor underlying <u>stream</u> and the thread would be
              delayed in the <u>fgetc</u>() operation.

       <b>EBADF</b>  The file descriptor underlying <u>stream</u> is not a valid file descriptor open for reading.

       <b>EINTR</b>  The read operation was terminated due to the receipt of a signal, and no data was transferred.

       <b>EIO</b>    A physical I/O error has occurred, or the process is in a background process group  attempting  to
              read  from  its  controlling  terminal,  and  either the calling thread is blocking SIGTTIN or the
              process is ignoring SIGTTIN or the process group of the process is orphaned.  This error may  also
              be generated for implementation-defined reasons.

       <b>EOVERFLOW</b>
              The  file  is  a  regular  file  and  an  attempt was made to read at or beyond the offset maximum
              associated with the corresponding stream.

       The <u>fgetc</u>() function may fail if:

       <b>ENOMEM</b> Insufficient storage space is available.

       <b>ENXIO</b>  A request was made of a nonexistent device, or the request was outside  the  capabilities  of  the
              device.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       If the integer value returned by <u>fgetc</u>() is stored into a variable of type <b>char</b> and then compared against
       the  integer constant EOF, the comparison may never succeed, because sign-extension of a variable of type
       <b>char</b> on widening to integer is implementation-defined.

       The <u>ferror</u>() or <u>feof</u>() functions must be used to distinguish between an error condition  and  an  end-of-
       file condition.

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>FUTURE</b> <b>DIRECTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       None.
