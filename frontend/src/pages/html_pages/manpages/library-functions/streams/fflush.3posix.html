</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       fflush — flush a stream

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/stdio.h">stdio.h</a>&gt;

       int fflush(FILE *<u>stream</u>);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  functionality  described  on  this  reference  page is aligned with the ISO C standard. Any conflict
       between the requirements described  here  and  the  ISO C  standard  is  unintentional.  This  volume  of
       POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO C standard.

       If  <u>stream</u>  points  to  an  output  stream or an update stream in which the most recent operation was not
       input, <u>fflush</u>() shall cause any unwritten data for that stream to be written to the file,  and  the  last
       data  modification  and  last  file  status  change timestamps of the underlying file shall be marked for
       update.

       For a stream open for reading with an underlying file description, if the file is not already at EOF, and
       the file is one capable of seeking, the file offset of the underlying open file description shall be  set
       to  the  file  position  of  the  stream,  and  any characters pushed back onto the stream by <u>ungetc</u>() or
       <u>ungetwc</u>() that have not subsequently been read from  the  stream  shall  be  discarded  (without  further
       changing the file offset).

       If  <u>stream</u>  is  a  null pointer, <u>fflush</u>() shall perform this flushing action on all streams for which the
       behavior is defined above.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       Upon successful completion, <u>fflush</u>() shall return 0; otherwise, it shall set the error indicator for  the
       stream, return EOF, and set <u>errno</u> to indicate the error.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>fflush</u>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EAGAIN</b> The  O_NONBLOCK  flag  is  set  for  the file descriptor underlying <u>stream</u> and the thread would be
              delayed in the write operation.

       <b>EBADF</b>  The file descriptor underlying <u>stream</u> is not valid.

       <b>EFBIG</b>  An attempt was made to write a file that exceeds the maximum file size.

       <b>EFBIG</b>  An attempt was made to write a file that exceeds the file size limit of the process.

       <b>EFBIG</b>  The file is a regular file and an attempt was made to  write  at  or  beyond  the  offset  maximum
              associated with the corresponding stream.

       <b>EINTR</b>  The <u>fflush</u>() function was interrupted by a signal.

       <b>EIO</b>    The  process  is  a  member  of  a background process group attempting to write to its controlling
              terminal, TOSTOP is set, the calling thread is not blocking SIGTTOU, the process is  not  ignoring
              SIGTTOU,  and the process group of the process is orphaned.  This error may also be returned under
              implementation-defined conditions.

       <b>ENOMEM</b> The underlying stream was created by <u>open_memstream</u>() or <u>open_wmemstream</u>() and insufficient memory
              is available.

       <b>ENOSPC</b> There was no free space remaining on the device containing the file or in the buffer used  by  the
              <u>fmemopen</u>() function.

       <b>EPIPE</b>  An  attempt  is  made  to  write  to a pipe or FIFO that is not open for reading by any process. A
              SIGPIPE signal shall also be sent to the thread.

       The <u>fflush</u>() function may fail if:

       <b>ENXIO</b>  A request was made of a nonexistent device, or the request was outside  the  capabilities  of  the
              device.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Sending</b> <b>Prompts</b> <b>to</b> <b>Standard</b> <b>Output</b>
       The  following  example  uses  <u>printf</u>()  calls to print a series of prompts for information the user must
       enter from standard input. The <u>fflush</u>() calls force the output to standard output. The <u>fflush</u>()  function
       is  used because standard output is usually buffered and the prompt may not immediately be printed on the
       output or terminal. The <u>getline</u>() function calls read strings from standard input and place  the  results
       in variables, for use later in the program.

           char *user;
           char *oldpasswd;
           char *newpasswd;
           ssize_t llen;
           size_t blen;
           struct termios term;
           tcflag_t saveflag;

           printf("User name: ");
           fflush(stdout);
           blen = 0;
           llen = getline(&amp;user, &amp;blen, stdin);
           user[llen-1] = 0;
           tcgetattr(fileno(stdin), &amp;term);
           saveflag = term.c_lflag;
           term.c_lflag &amp;= ~ECHO;
           tcsetattr(fileno(stdin), TCSANOW, &amp;term);
           printf("Old password: ");
           fflush(stdout);
           blen = 0;
           llen = getline(&amp;oldpasswd, &amp;blen, stdin);
           oldpasswd[llen-1] = 0;

           printf("\nNew password: ");
           fflush(stdout);
           blen = 0;
           llen = getline(&amp;newpasswd, &amp;blen, stdin);
           newpasswd[llen-1] = 0;
           term.c_lflag = saveflag;
           tcsetattr(fileno(stdin), TCSANOW, &amp;term);
           free(user);
           free(oldpasswd);
           free(newpasswd);

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       Data  buffered  by  the  system  may  make  determining  the validity of the position of the current file
       descriptor impractical. Thus, enforcing the repositioning  of  the  file  descriptor  after  <u>fflush</u>()  on
       streams open for <u>read</u>() is not mandated by POSIX.1‐2008.

</pre><h4><b>FUTURE</b> <b>DIRECTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       None.
