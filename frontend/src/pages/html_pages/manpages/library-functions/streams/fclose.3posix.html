</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       fclose — close a stream

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/stdio.h">stdio.h</a>&gt;

       int fclose(FILE *<u>stream</u>);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  functionality  described  on  this  reference  page is aligned with the ISO C standard. Any conflict
       between the requirements described  here  and  the  ISO C  standard  is  unintentional.  This  volume  of
       POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO C standard.

       The  <u>fclose</u>()  function shall cause the stream pointed to by <u>stream</u> to be flushed and the associated file
       to be closed. Any unwritten buffered data for the stream  shall  be  written  to  the  file;  any  unread
       buffered  data  shall  be  discarded. Whether or not the call succeeds, the stream shall be disassociated
       from the file and any buffer set by the <u>setbuf</u>() or <u>setvbuf</u>() function shall be  disassociated  from  the
       stream. If the associated buffer was automatically allocated, it shall be deallocated.

       If  the  file  is  not  already  at  EOF,  and the file is one capable of seeking, the file offset of the
       underlying open file description shall be set to the file position of the stream if  the  stream  is  the
       active handle to the underlying file description.

       The  <u>fclose</u>()  function  shall  mark  for  update  the last data modification and last file status change
       timestamps of the underlying file, if the stream was writable, and if buffered data remains that has  not
       yet been written to the file. The <u>fclose</u>() function shall perform the equivalent of a <u>close</u>() on the file
       descriptor that is associated with the stream pointed to by <u>stream</u>.

       After the call to <u>fclose</u>(), any use of <u>stream</u> results in undefined behavior.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       Upon  successful  completion,  <u>fclose</u>()  shall  return 0; otherwise, it shall return EOF and set <u>errno</u> to
       indicate the error.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>fclose</u>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EAGAIN</b> The O_NONBLOCK flag is set for the file descriptor underlying  <u>stream</u>  and  the  thread  would  be
              delayed in the write operation.

       <b>EBADF</b>  The file descriptor underlying stream is not valid.

       <b>EFBIG</b>  An attempt was made to write a file that exceeds the maximum file size.

       <b>EFBIG</b>  An attempt was made to write a file that exceeds the file size limit of the process.

       <b>EFBIG</b>  The  file  is  a  regular  file  and  an attempt was made to write at or beyond the offset maximum
              associated with the corresponding stream.

       <b>EINTR</b>  The <u>fclose</u>() function was interrupted by a signal.

       <b>EIO</b>    The process is a member of a background process group  attempting  to  write  to  its  controlling
              terminal,  TOSTOP  is set, the calling thread is not blocking SIGTTOU, the process is not ignoring
              SIGTTOU, and the process group of the process is orphaned.  This error may also be returned  under
              implementation-defined conditions.

       <b>ENOMEM</b> The underlying stream was created by <u>open_memstream</u>() or <u>open_wmemstream</u>() and insufficient memory
              is available.

       <b>ENOSPC</b> There  was  no free space remaining on the device containing the file or in the buffer used by the
              <u>fmemopen</u>() function.

       <b>EPIPE</b>  An attempt is made to write to a pipe or FIFO that is not open  for  reading  by  any  process.  A
              SIGPIPE signal shall also be sent to the thread.

       The <u>fclose</u>() function may fail if:

       <b>ENXIO</b>  A  request  was  made  of a nonexistent device, or the request was outside the capabilities of the
              device.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       Since after the call to <u>fclose</u>() any use of <u>stream</u> results in undefined behavior, <u>fclose</u>() should not  be
       used  on <u>stdin</u>, <u>stdout</u>, or <u>stderr</u> except immediately before process termination (see the Base Definitions
       volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Section</u> <u>3.303</u>, <u>Process</u> <u>Termination</u>), so as to avoid triggering undefined behavior
       in other standard interfaces that rely on these streams. If there are any <u>atexit</u>() handlers registered by
       the application, such a call to <u>fclose</u>() should not occur until  the  last  handler  is  finishing.  Once
       <u>fclose</u>() has been used to close <u>stdin</u>, <u>stdout</u>, or <u>stderr</u>, there is no standard way to reopen any of these
       streams.

       Use  of  <u>freopen</u>() to change <u>stdin</u>, <u>stdout</u>, or <u>stderr</u> instead of closing them avoids the danger of a file
       unexpectedly being opened as  one  of  the  special  file  descriptors  STDIN_FILENO,  STDOUT_FILENO,  or
       STDERR_FILENO at a later time in the application.

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>FUTURE</b> <b>DIRECTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       None.
