</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This package provides objects mainly describing the destination of a data transfer. They are also able to
       initiate the reception of information from a channel into the described destination.

</pre><h4><b>API</b></h4><pre>
       <b>transfer::data::destination</b> <u>objectName</u> ?<u>options</u>...?
              This  command  creates  a new data destination object with an associated Tcl command whose name is
              <u>objectName</u>.  This <u>object</u> command is explained in full detail in the sections  <b>Object</b>  <b>command</b>  and
              <b>Object</b> <b>methods</b>. The set of supported <u>options</u> is explained in section <b>Options</b>.

              The  object  command  will  be  created under the current namespace if the <u>objectName</u> is not fully
              qualified, and in the specified namespace otherwise.  The  fully  qualified  name  of  the  object
              command is returned as the result of the command.

   <b>OBJECT</b> <b>COMMAND</b>
       All objects created by the <b>::transfer::data::destination</b> command have the following general form:

       <u>objectName</u> <b>method</b> ?<u>arg</u> <u>arg</u> <u>...</u>?
              The  method  <b>method</b>  and  its <u>arg</u>'uments determine the exact behavior of the command.  See section
              <b>Object</b> <b>methods</b> for the detailed specifications.

   <b>OBJECT</b> <b>METHODS</b>
       <u>objectName</u> <b>destroy</b>
              This method destroys the object. Doing  so  while  the  object  is  busy  with  the  reception  of
              information  from  a channel will cause errors later on, when the reception completes and tries to
              access the now missing data structures of the destroyed object.

       <u>objectName</u> <b>put</b> <u>chunk</u>
              The main receptor method. Saves the received <u>chunk</u> of data into the configured destination. It has
              to be called for each piece of data received.

       <u>objectName</u> <b>done</b>
              The secondary receptor method. Finalizes the receiver. It has to  be  called  when  the  receiving
              channel signals EOF. Afterward neither itself nor method <b>put</b> can be called anymore.

       <u>objectName</u> <b>valid</b> <u>msgvar</u>
              This  method  checks  the  configuration  of the object for validity. It returns a boolean flag as
              result, whose value is <b>True</b> if the object is valid, and <b>False</b> otherwise. In the  latter  case  the
              variable  whose  name  is stored in <u>msgvar</u> is set to an error message describing the problem found
              with the configuration. Otherwise this variable is not touched.

       <u>objectName</u> <b>receive</b> <u>channel</u> <u>done</u>
              This method initiates the reception of data from the specified <u>channel</u>. The received data will  be
              stored into the configured destination, via calls to the methods <b>put</b> and <b>done</b>.  When the reception
              completes  the  command prefix <u>done</u> is invoked, with the number of received characters appended to
              it as the sole additional argument.

   <b>OPTIONS</b>
       All data destinations support the options listed below. It should be noted that all  are  semi-exclusive,
       each  specifying  a  different  type  of  destination  and  associated  information. If these options are
       specified more than once then the last option specified is used to actually configure the object.

       <b>-channel</b> <u>handle</u>
              This option specifies that the destination of the data is a channel, and its  associated  argument
              is the handle of the channel to write the received data to.

       <b>-file</b> <u>path</u>
              This  option  specifies that the destination of the data is a file, and its associated argument is
              the path of the file to write the received data to.

       <b>-variable</b> <u>varname</u>
              This option specifies that the destination of the data is a variable, and its associated  argument
              contains  the  name  of  the variable to write the received data to. The variable is assumed to be
              global or namespaced, anchored at the global namespace.

       <b>-progress</b> <u>command</u>
              This option, if specified, defines a command to be invoked  for  each  chunk  of  bytes  received,
              allowing  the  user  to  monitor the progress of the reception of the data. The callback is always
              invoked with one additional argument, the number of bytes received so far.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS,</b> <b>IDEAS,</b> <b>FEEDBACK</b></h4><pre>
       This document, and the package it describes, will undoubtedly contain bugs and  other  problems.   Please
       report  such  in  the  category  <u>transfer</u>  of the <u>Tcllib</u> <u>Trackers</u> [<a href="http://core.tcl.tk/tcllib/reportlist">http://core.tcl.tk/tcllib/reportlist</a>].
       Please also report any ideas for enhancements you may have for either package and/or documentation.

       When proposing code changes, please provide <u>unified</u> <u>diffs</u>, i.e the output of <b>diff</b> <b>-u</b>.

       Note further that <u>attachments</u> are strongly preferred over inlined patches. Attachments  can  be  made  by
       going  to the <b>Edit</b> form of the ticket immediately after its creation, and then using the left-most button
       in the secondary navigation bar.
