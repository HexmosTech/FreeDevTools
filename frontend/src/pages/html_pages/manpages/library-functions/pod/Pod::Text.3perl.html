       Pod::Text - Convert POD data to formatted text

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Pod::Text;
           my $parser = Pod::Text-&gt;new (sentence =&gt; 1, width =&gt; 78);

           # Read POD from STDIN and write to STDOUT.
           $parser-&gt;parse_from_filehandle;

           # Read POD from file.pod and write to file.txt.
           $parser-&gt;parse_from_file ('file.pod', 'file.txt');

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Pod::Text is a module that can convert documentation in the POD format (the preferred language for
       documenting Perl) into formatted text.  It uses no special formatting controls or codes, and its output
       is therefore suitable for nearly any device.

   <b>Encoding</b>
       Pod::Text uses the following logic to choose an output encoding, in order:

       1.  If  a  PerlIO encoding layer is set on the output file handle, do not do any output encoding and will
           instead rely on the PerlIO encoding layer.

       2.  If the "encoding" or "utf8" options are set, use the output encoding specified by those options.

       3.  If the input encoding of the  POD  source  file  was  explicitly  specified  (using  "=encoding")  or
           automatically detected by Pod::Simple, use that as the output encoding as well.

       4.  Otherwise,  if  running  on  a  non-EBCDIC system, use UTF-8 as the output encoding.  Since this is a
           superset of ASCII, this will  result  in  ASCII  output  unless  the  POD  input  contains  non-ASCII
           characters without declaring or autodetecting an encoding (usually via E&lt;&gt; escapes).

       5.  Otherwise, for EBCDIC systems, output without doing any encoding and hope this works.

       One  caveat:  Pod::Text  has  to  commit  to  an  output  encoding  the first time it outputs a non-ASCII
       character, and then has to stick with it for consistency.  However, "=encoding" commands don't have to be
       at the beginning of a POD document.  If someone uses a non-ASCII character early in a  document  with  an
       escape,  such as E&lt;0xEF&gt;, and then puts "=encoding iso-8859-1" later, ideally Pod::Text would follow rule
       3 and output the entire document as ISO 8859-1.  Instead, it will commit to UTF-8  following  rule  4  as
       soon as it sees that escape, and then stick with that encoding for the rest of the document.

       Unfortunately,  there's no universally good choice for an output encoding.  Each choice will be incorrect
       in some circumstances.  This approach was chosen primarily for backwards compatibility.   Callers  should
       consider  forcing  the  output encoding via "encoding" if they have any knowledge about what encoding the
       user may expect.

       In particular, consider importing the Encode::Locale module, if  available,  and  setting  "encoding"  to
       "locale"  to  use  an output encoding appropriate to the user's locale.  But be aware that if the user is
       not using locales or is using a locale of "C", Encode::Locale will set the output encoding  to  US-ASCII.
       This  will  cause  all  non-ASCII  characters will be replaced with "?"  and produce a flurry of warnings
       about unsupported characters, which may or may not be what you want.

</pre><h4><b>CLASS</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       new(ARGS)
           Create a new Pod::Text object.  ARGS should be a list of key/value pairs, where the keys  are  chosen
           from  the following.  Each option is annotated with the version of Pod::Text in which that option was
           added with its current meaning.

           alt [2.00] If set to a true value, selects an alternate output format that, among other things,  uses
               a different heading style and marks "=item" entries with a colon in the left margin.  Defaults to
               false.

           code
               [2.13]  If  set  to  a  true  value,  the non-POD parts of the input file will be included in the
               output.  Useful for viewing code documented with POD blocks with the POD rendered  and  the  code
               left intact.

           encoding
               [5.00]  Specifies  the  encoding  of the output.  The value must be an encoding recognized by the
               Encode module (see  Encode::Supported).   If  the  output  contains  characters  that  cannot  be
               represented  in  this  encoding,  that  is  an  error  that will be reported as configured by the
               "errors" option.  If error handling is other than "die", the unrepresentable  character  will  be
               replaced with the Encode substitution character (normally "?").

               If  the output file handle has a PerlIO encoding layer set, this parameter will be ignored and no
               encoding will be done by Pod::Man.  It will instead rely on the encoding layer to  make  whatever
               output encoding transformations are desired.

               WARNING:  The  input  encoding  of  the  POD  source is independent from the output encoding, and
               setting this option does not affect the interpretation of the POD input.  Unless your POD  source
               is  US-ASCII, its encoding should be declared with the "=encoding" command in the source, as near
               to the top of the file as possible.  If this is not done, Pod::Simple will will attempt to  guess
               the  encoding  and may be successful if it's Latin-1 or UTF-8, but it will produce warnings.  See
               <b><a href="../man1/perlpod.1.html">perlpod</a></b>(1) for more information.

           errors
               [3.17] How to report errors.  "die" says to throw an  exception  on  any  POD  formatting  error.
               "stderr"  says  to report errors on standard error, but not to throw an exception.  "pod" says to
               include a POD ERRORS section in the  resulting  documentation  summarizing  the  errors.   "none"
               ignores POD errors entirely, as much as possible.

               The default is "pod".

           guesswork
               [5.01] By default, Pod::Text applies some default formatting rules based on guesswork and regular
               expressions that are intended to make writing Perl documentation easier and require less explicit
               markup.   These  rules  may  not always be appropriate, particularly for documentation that isn't
               about Perl.  This option allows turning all or some of it off.

               The special  value  "all"  enables  all  guesswork.   This  is  also  the  default  for  backward
               compatibility reasons.  The special value "none" disables all guesswork.  Otherwise, the value of
               this option should be a comma-separated list of one or more of the following keywords:

               quoting
                   If  no guesswork is enabled, any text enclosed in C&lt;&gt; is surrounded by double quotes in nroff
                   (terminal) output unless the contents are already quoted.  When this  guesswork  is  enabled,
                   quote  marks  will  also  be  suppressed  for Perl variables, function names, function calls,
                   numbers, and hex constants.

               Any unknown guesswork name is silently  ignored  (for  potential  future  compatibility),  so  be
               careful about spelling.

           indent
               [2.00]  The  number  of  spaces  to  indent regular text, and the default indentation for "=over"
               blocks.  Defaults to 4.

           loose
               [2.00] If set to a true value, a blank line is printed after a "=head1" heading.  If set to false
               (the default), no blank line is printed after "=head1",  although  one  is  still  printed  after
               "=head2".   This  is the default because it's the expected formatting for manual pages; if you're
               formatting arbitrary text documents, setting this to true may result in more pleasing output.

           margin
               [2.21] The width of the left margin in spaces.  Defaults to 0.  This is the margin for all  text,
               including  headings,  not  the  amount by which regular text is indented; for the latter, see the
               <u>indent</u> option.  To set the right margin, see the <u>width</u> option.

           nourls
               [3.17] Normally, L&lt;&gt; formatting codes with a URL but anchor text are formatted to show  both  the
               anchor text and the URL.  In other words:

                   L&lt;foo|<a href="http://example.com/">http://example.com/</a>&gt;

               is formatted as:

                   foo &lt;<a href="http://example.com/">http://example.com/</a>&gt;

               This  option,  if  set  to  a  true  value, suppresses the URL when anchor text is given, so this
               example would be formatted as just "foo".  This can produce less cluttered output in cases  where
               the URLs are not particularly important.

           quotes
               [4.00] Sets the quote marks used to surround C&lt;&gt; text.  If the value is a single character, it is
               used as both the left and right quote.  Otherwise, it is split in half, and the first half of the
               string is used as the left quote and the second is used as the right quote.

               This  may  also be set to the special value "none", in which case no quote marks are added around
               C&lt;&gt; text.

           sentence
               [3.00] If set to a true value, Pod::Text will assume that each sentence ends in two  spaces,  and
               will  try  to preserve that spacing.  If set to false, all consecutive whitespace in non-verbatim
               paragraphs is compressed into a single space.  Defaults to false.

           stderr
               [3.10] Send error messages about invalid POD to standard error instead of appending a POD  ERRORS
               section  to the generated output.  This is equivalent to setting "errors" to "stderr" if "errors"
               is not already set.  It is supported for backward compatibility.

           utf8
               [3.12] If this option is set to a true value, the output encoding  is  set  to  UTF-8.   This  is
               equivalent  to  setting  "encoding" to "UTF-8" if "encoding" is not already set.  It is supported
               for backward compatibility.

           width
               [2.00] The column at which to wrap text on the right-hand side.  Defaults to 76.

</pre><h4><b>INSTANCE</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       As a derived class from Pod::Simple, Pod::Text supports the same methods and interfaces.  See Pod::Simple
       for all the details.  This section summarizes the most-frequently-used methods  and  the  ones  added  by
       Pod::Text.

       output_fh(FH)
           Direct  the output from <b>parse_file()</b>, <b>parse_lines()</b>, or <b>parse_string_document()</b> to the file handle FH
           instead of "STDOUT".

       output_string(REF)
           Direct the output from <b>parse_file()</b>, <b>parse_lines()</b>, or <b>parse_string_document()</b> to the scalar variable
           pointed to by REF, rather than "STDOUT".  For example:

               my $man = Pod::Man-&gt;new();
               my $output;
               $man-&gt;output_string(\$output);
               $man-&gt;parse_file('/some/input/file');

           Be aware that the output in that variable will already be encoded (see "Encoding").

       parse_file(PATH)
           Read the POD source from PATH and format it.  By default, the output is sent to  "STDOUT",  but  this
           can be changed with the <b>output_fh()</b> or <b>output_string()</b> methods.

       parse_from_file(INPUT, OUTPUT)
       parse_from_filehandle(FH, OUTPUT)
           Read the POD source from INPUT, format it, and output the results to OUTPUT.

           <b>parse_from_filehandle()</b>  is  provided  for  backward  compatibility  with older versions of Pod::Man.
           <b>parse_from_file()</b> should be used instead.

       parse_lines(LINES[, ...[, undef]])
           Parse the provided lines as POD source, writing the output to either "STDOUT" or the file handle  set
           with  the  <b>output_fh()</b>  or  <b>output_string()</b> methods.  This method can be called repeatedly to provide
           more input lines.  An explicit "undef" should be passed to indicate the end of input.

           This method expects raw bytes, not decoded characters.

       parse_string_document(INPUT)
           Parse the provided scalar variable as POD source, writing the output to either "STDOUT" or  the  file
           handle set with the <b>output_fh()</b> or <b>output_string()</b> methods.

           This method expects raw bytes, not decoded characters.

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Pod::Text  exports  one  function  for  backward  compatibility  with  older  versions.  This function is
       deprecated; instead, use the object-oriented interface described above.

       pod2text([[-a,] [-NNN,]] INPUT[, OUTPUT])
           Convert the POD source from INPUT to text and write it to OUTPUT.  If OUTPUT is not  given,  defaults
           to "STDOUT".  INPUT can be any expression supported as the second argument to two-argument <b>open()</b>.

           If  "-a"  is  given as an initial argument, pass the "alt" option to the Pod::Text constructor.  This
           enables alternative formatting.

           If "-NNN" is given as an initial argument, pass the "width" option to the Pod::Text constructor  with
           the number "NNN" as its argument.  This sets the wrap line width to NNN.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       Bizarre space in item
       Item called without tag
           (W)  Something  has  gone  wrong  in  internal  "=item" processing.  These messages indicate a bug in
           Pod::Text; you should never see them.

       Can't open %s for reading: %s
           (F) Pod::Text was invoked via the compatibility mode <b>pod2text()</b> interface and the input file  it  was
           given could not be opened.

       Invalid errors setting "%s"
           (F) The "errors" parameter to the constructor was set to an unknown value.

       Invalid quote specification "%s"
           (F)  The  quote  specification  given  (the "quotes" option to the constructor) was invalid.  A quote
           specification must be either one character long or an even number (greater than one) characters long.

       POD document had syntax errors
           (F) The POD document being formatted had syntax errors and the "errors" option was set to "die".

</pre><h4><b>COMPATIBILITY</b></h4><pre>
       Pod::Text 2.03 (based on Pod::Parser) was the first version of this module included with  Perl,  in  Perl
       5.6.0.  Earlier versions of Perl had a different Pod::Text module, with a different API.

       The  current  API  based on Pod::Simple was added in Pod::Text 3.00.  Pod::Text 3.01 was included in Perl
       5.9.3, the first version of Perl to incorporate those changes.  This is the first version that  correctly
       supports   all  modern  POD  syntax.   The  <b>parse_from_filehandle()</b>  method  was  re-added  for  backward
       compatibility in Pod::Text 3.07, included in Perl 5.9.4.

       Pod::Text 3.12, included in Perl 5.10.1, first implemented the current practice of  attempting  to  match
       the  default  output  encoding with the input encoding of the POD source, unless overridden by the "utf8"
       option or (added later) the "encoding" option.

       Support for anchor text in L&lt;&gt; links of type URL was added in Pod::Text 3.14, included in Perl 5.11.5.

       <b>parse_lines()</b>, <b>parse_string_document()</b>, and <b>parse_file()</b> set a default output file handle of "STDOUT"  if
       one was not already set as of Pod::Text 3.18, included in Perl 5.19.5.

       Pod::Text  4.00,  included  in  Perl  5.23.7, aligned the module version and the version of the podlators
       distribution.  All modules included in podlators, and the podlators distribution itself, share  the  same
       version number from this point forward.

       Pod::Text  4.09,  included in Perl 5.25.7, fixed a serious bug on EBCDIC systems, present in all versions
       back to 3.00, that would cause opening brackets to disappear.

       Pod::Text 5.00 now defaults, on non-EBCDIC systems, to UTF-8 encoding if it sees a non-ASCII character in
       the input and the input encoding is not specified.  It also commits to an encoding with  the  first  non-
       ASCII character and does not change the output encoding if the input encoding changes.  The Encode module
       is  now  used for all output encoding rather than PerlIO layers, which fixes earlier problems with output
       to scalars.
