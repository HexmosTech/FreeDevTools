</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Pod::Escapes - for resolving Pod E&lt;...&gt; sequences

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Pod::Escapes qw(e2char);
         ...la la la, parsing POD, la la la...
         $text = e2char($e_node-&gt;label);
         unless(defined $text) {
           print "Unknown E sequence \"", $e_node-&gt;label, "\"!";
         }
         ...else print/interpolate $text...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module provides things that are useful in decoding Pod E&lt;...&gt; sequences.  Presumably, it should be
       used only by Pod parsers and/or formatters.

       By default, Pod::Escapes exports none of its symbols.  But you can request any of them to be exported.
       Either request them individually, as with "use Pod::Escapes qw(symbolname symbolname2...);", or you can
       do "use Pod::Escapes qw(:ALL);" to get all exportable symbols.

</pre><h4><b>GOODIES</b></h4><pre>
       e2char($e_content)
           Given a name or number that could appear in a "E&lt;name_or_num&gt;" sequence, this returns the string that
           it  stands  for.   For  example,  e2char('sol'),  e2char('47'), e2char('0x2F'), and e2char('057') all
           return "/", because "E&lt;sol&gt;", "E&lt;47&gt;", "E&lt;0x2f&gt;", and "E&lt;057&gt;", all mean "/".  If  the  name  has  no
           known  value (as with a name of "qacute") or is syntactically invalid (as with a name of "1/4"), this
           returns undef.

       e2charnum($e_content)
           Given a name or number that could appear in a "E&lt;name_or_num&gt;" sequence, this returns the  number  of
           the   Unicode   character   that   this   stands  for.   For  example,  e2char('sol'),  e2char('47'),
           e2char('0x2F'), and e2char('057') all return 47, because "E&lt;sol&gt;", "E&lt;47&gt;", "E&lt;0x2f&gt;", and  "E&lt;057&gt;",
           all  mean  "/",  whose  Unicode  number  is  47.   If  the name has no known value (as with a name of
           "qacute") or is syntactically invalid (as with a name of "1/4"), this returns undef.

       $Name2character{<u>name</u>}
           Maps from names (as in "E&lt;<u>name</u>&gt;") like "eacute" or "sol" to the string that each  stands  for.   Note
           that this does not include numerics (like "64" or "x981c").  Under old Perl versions (before 5.7) you
           get a "?" in place of characters whose Unicode value is over 255.

       $Name2character_number{<u>name</u>}
           Maps  from  names (as in "E&lt;<u>name</u>&gt;") like "eacute" or "sol" to the Unicode value that each stands for.
           For example, $Name2character_number{'eacute'} is 201, and $Name2character_number{'eacute'}  is  8364.
           You  get  the  correct Unicode value, regardless of the version of Perl you're using -- which differs
           from %Name2character's behavior under pre-5.7 Perls.

           Note that this hash does not include numerics (like "64" or "x981c").

       $Latin1Code_to_fallback{<u>integer</u>}
           For numbers in the range 160 (0x00A0) to 255 (0x00FF), this  maps  from  the  character  code  for  a
           Latin-1 character (like 233 for lowercase e-acute) to the US-ASCII character that best aproximates it
           (like  "e").  You may find this useful if you are rendering POD in a format that you think deals well
           only with US-ASCII characters.

       $Latin1Char_to_fallback{<u>character</u>}
           Just as above, but maps from characters (like "\xE9", lowercase e-acute) to characters (like "e").

       $Code2USASCII{<u>integer</u>}
           This maps from US-ASCII codes (like 32) to the corresponding character (like space,  for  32).   Only
           characters  32  to  126  are  defined.   This is meant for use by e2char($x) when it senses that it's
           running on a non-ASCII platform (where <a href="../man32/chr.32.html">chr</a>(32) doesn't get  you  a  space  --  but  $Code2USASCII{32}
           will).  It's documented here just in case you might find it useful.

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
       On  Perl  versions  before 5.7, Unicode characters with a value over 255 (like lambda or emdash) can't be
       conveyed.  This module does work under such early Perl versions, but in the place of each such character,
       you get a "?".  Latin-1 characters (characters 160-255) are unaffected.

       Under EBCDIC platforms, e2char($n) may not always be the same  as  "chr(e2charnum($n))",  and  ditto  for
       $Name2character{$name}  and  chr($Name2character_number{$name}),  because  the  strings  are  returned as
       native, and the numbers are returned as Unicode.  However, for Perls starting with  v5.8,  e2char($n)  is
       the  same  as  "chr(utf8::unicode_to_native(e2charnum($n)))",  and  ditto  for $Name2character{$name} and
       "chr(utf8::unicode_to_native($Name2character_number{$name}))".
