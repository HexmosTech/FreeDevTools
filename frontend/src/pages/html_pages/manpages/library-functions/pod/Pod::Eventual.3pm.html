</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Pod::Eventual - read a POD document as a series of trivial events

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 0.094003

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         package Your::Pod::Parser;
         use base 'Pod::Eventual';

         sub handle_event {
           my ($self, $event) = @_;

           print Dumper($event);
         }

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       POD is a pretty simple format to write, but it can be a big pain to deal with reading it and doing
       anything useful with it.  Most existing POD parsers care about semantics, like whether a "=item" occurred
       after an "=over" but before a "back", figuring out how to link a "L&lt;&gt;", and other things like that.

       Pod::Eventual is much less ambitious and much more stupid.  Fortunately, stupid is often better.  (That's
       what I keep telling myself, anyway.)

       Pod::Eventual reads line-based input and produces events describing each POD paragraph or directive it
       finds.  Once complete events are immediately passed to the "handle_event" method.  This method should be
       implemented by Pod::Eventual subclasses.  If it isn't, Pod::Eventual's own "handle_event" will be called,
       and will raise an exception.

</pre><h4><b>PERL</b> <b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This library should run on perls released even a long time ago.  It should work on any version of perl
       released in the last five years.

       Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made that the minimum required version
       will not be increased.  The version may be increased for any reason, and there is no promise that patches
       will be accepted to lower the minimum required perl.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>read_handle</b>
         Pod::Eventual-&gt;read_handle($io_handle, \%arg);

       This method iterates through the lines of a handle, producing events and calling the "handle_event"
       method.

       The only valid argument in %arg (for now) is "in_pod", which indicates whether we should assume that we
       are parsing pod when we start parsing the file.  By default, this is false.

       This is useful to behave differently when reading a <u>.pm</u> or <u>.pod</u> file.

       <b>Important:</b> the handle is expected to have an encoding layer so that it will return text, not bytes, on
       reads.

   <b>read_file</b>
       This behaves just like "read_handle", but expects a filename rather than a handle.  The file will be
       assumed to be UTF-8 encoded.

   <b>read_string</b>
       This behaves just like "read_handle", but expects a string containing POD text rather than a handle.

   <b>handle_event</b>
       This method is called each time Pod::Eventual finishes scanning for a new POD event.  It must be
       implemented by a subclass or it will raise an exception.

   <b>handle_nonpod</b>
       This method is called each time a non-POD segment is seen -- that is, lines after "=cut" and before
       another command.

       If unimplemented by a subclass, it does nothing by default.

   <b>handle_blank</b>
       This method is called at the end of a sequence of one or more blank lines.

       If unimplemented by a subclass, it does nothing by default.

</pre><h4><b>EVENTS</b></h4><pre>
       There are four kinds of events that Pod::Eventual will produce.  All are represented as hash references.

   <b>Command</b> <b>Events</b>
       These events represent commands -- those things that start with an equals sign in the first column.  Here
       are some examples of POD and the event that would be produced.

       A simple header:

         =head1 NAME

         { type =&gt; 'command', command =&gt; 'head1', content =&gt; "NAME\n", start_line =&gt; 4 }

       Notice that the content includes the trailing newline.  That's to maintain similarity with this possibly-
       surprising case:

         =for HTML
         We're actually still in the command event, here.

         {
           type    =&gt; 'command',
           command =&gt; 'for',
           content =&gt; "HTML\nWe're actually still in the command event, here.\n",
           start_line =&gt; 8,
         }

       Pod::Eventual does not care what the command is.  It doesn't keep track of what it's seen or whether
       you've used a command that isn't defined.  The only special case is "=cut", which is never more than one
       line.

         =cut
         We are no longer parsing POD when this line is read.

         {
           type    =&gt; 'command',
           command =&gt; 'cut',
           content =&gt; "\n",
           start_line =&gt; 15,
         }

       Waiving this special case may be an option in the future.

   <b>Text</b> <b>Events</b>
       A text event is just a paragraph of text, beginning after one or more empty lines and running until the
       next empty line (or <u>=cut</u>).  In Perl 5's standard usage of Pod, text content that begins with whitespace
       is a "verbatim" paragraph, and text content that begins with non-whitespace is an "ordinary" paragraph.

       Pod::Eventual doesn't care.

       Text events look like this:

         {
           type    =&gt; 'text',
           content =&gt; "a string of text ending with a\n",
           start_line =&gt;  16,
         }

   <b>Blank</b> <b>events</b>
       These events represent blank lines (or many blank lines) within a Pod section.

       Blank events look like this:

         {
           type    =&gt; 'blank',
           content =&gt; "\n\n\n\n",
           start_line =&gt; 21,
         }

   <b>Non-Pod</b> <b>events</b>
       These events represent non-Pod segments of the input.

       Non-Pod events look like this:

         {
           type    =&gt; 'nonpod',
           content =&gt; "#!<a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?perl">/usr/bin/perl</a>\nuse strict;\n\nuse Acme::ProgressBar\n\n",
           start_line =&gt; 1,
         }
