       Pod::Coverage::TrustPod - allow a module's pod to contain Pod::Coverage hints

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 0.100006

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This is a Pod::Coverage subclass (actually, a subclass of Pod::Coverage::CountParents) that allows the
       POD itself to declare certain symbol names trusted.

       Here is a sample Perl module:

         package Foo::Bar;

         =head1 NAME

         Foo::Bar - a bar at which fooes like to drink

         =head1 METHODS

         =head2 fee

         returns the bar tab

         =cut

         sub fee { ... }

         =head2 fie

         scoffs at bar tab

         =cut

         sub fie { ... }

         sub foo { ... }

         =begin Pod::Coverage

           foo

         =end Pod::Coverage

         =cut

       This file would report full coverage, because any non-empty lines inside a block of POD targeted to
       Pod::Coverage are treated as "trustme" patterns.  Leading and trailing whitespace is stripped and the
       remainder is treated as a regular expression anchored at both ends.

       Remember, anywhere you could use "=begin" and "=end" as above, you could instead write:

         =for Pod::Coverage foo

       In some cases, you may wish to make the entire file trusted.  The special pattern "*EVERYTHING*" may be
       provided to do just this.

       Keep in mind that Pod::Coverage::TrustPod sets up exceptions using the "trust" mechanism rather than the
       "privacy" mechanism in Pod::Coverage.  This is unlikely ever to matter to you, but it's true.

</pre><h4><b>PERL</b> <b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This library should run on perls released even a long time ago.  It should work on any version of perl
       released in the last five years.

       Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made that the minimum required version
       will not be increased.  The version may be increased for any reason, and there is no promise that patches
       will be accepted to lower the minimum required perl.
