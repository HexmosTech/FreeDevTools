</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Pod::Spell - a formatter for spellchecking Pod

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 1.27

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Pod::Spell;
           Pod::Spell-&gt;new-&gt;parse_from_file( 'File.pm' );

           Pod::Spell-&gt;new-&gt;parse_from_filehandle( $infile, $outfile );

       Also look at podspell

           % perl -MPod::Spell -e "Pod::Spell-&gt;new-&gt;parse_from_file(shift)" Thing.pm |spell |fmt

       ...or instead of piping to spell or "ispell", use "&gt;temp.txt", and open <u>temp.txt</u> in your word processor
       for spell-checking.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Pod::Spell is a Pod formatter whose output is good for spellchecking.  Pod::Spell is rather like
       Pod::Text, except that it doesn't put much effort into actual formatting, and it suppresses things that
       look like Perl symbols or Perl jargon (so that your spellchecking program won't complain about mystery
       words like "$thing" or ""Foo::Bar"" or "hashref").

       This class works by filtering out words that look like Perl or any form of computerese (like "$thing" or
       ""N&gt;7"" or ""@{$foo}{'bar','baz'}"", anything in C&lt;...&gt; or F&lt;...&gt; codes, anything in verbatim paragraphs
       (code blocks), and anything in the stopword list.  The default stopword list for a document starts out
       from the stopword list defined by Pod::Wordlist, and can be supplemented (on a per-document basis) by
       having "=for stopwords" / "=for :stopwords" region(s) in a document.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>new</b>
           Pod::Spell-&gt;new(%options)

       Creates a new Pod::Spell instance. Accepts several options:

       debug
           When set to a true value, will output debugging messages about how the Pod is being processed.

           Defaults to false.

       stopwords
           Can be specified to use an alternate wordlist instance.

           Defaults to a new Pod::Wordlist instance.

       no_wide_chars
           Will  be  passed  to  Pod::Wordlist  when  creating  a new instance. Causes all words with characters
           outside the Latin-1 range to be stripped from the output.

   <b>stopwords</b>
           $self-&gt;stopwords-&gt;isa('Pod::WordList'); # true

   <b>parse_from_filehandle($in_fh,$out_fh)</b>
       This method takes an input filehandle (which is assumed to already be opened for reading) and  reads  the
       entire  input  stream  looking  for blocks (paragraphs) of POD documentation to be processed. If no first
       argument is given the default input filehandle "STDIN" is used.

       The $in_fh parameter may be any object that provides a <b>getline()</b> method to  retrieve  a  single  line  of
       input  text  (hence, an appropriate wrapper object could be used to parse PODs from a single string or an
       array of strings).

   <b>parse_from_file($filename,$outfile)</b>
       This method takes a filename and does the following:

       • opens the input and output files for reading (creating the appropriate filehandles)

       • invokes the <b>parse_from_filehandle()</b> method passing it the corresponding input and output filehandles.

       • closes the input and output files.

       If the special input filename "", "-" or "&lt;&amp;STDIN" is given then the STDIN filehandle is used  for  input
       (and  no  open  or close is performed). If no input filename is specified then "-" is implied. Filehandle
       references, or objects that support the regular IO operations (like "&lt;$fh&gt;"  or  "$fh-&lt;Egt"getline&gt;)  are
       also accepted; the handles must already be opened.

       If  a  second  argument  is  given  then it should be the name of the desired output file. If the special
       output filename "-" or "&gt;&amp;STDOUT" is given then the STDOUT filehandle is used for output (and no open  or
       close  is  performed).  If  the special output filename "&gt;&amp;STDERR" is given then the STDERR filehandle is
       used for output (and no open or close is performed). If no output filehandle is currently in use  and  no
       output  filename is specified, then "-" is implied.  Alternatively, filehandle references or objects that
       support the regular IO operations (like "print", e.g. IO::String) are  also  accepted;  the  object  must
       already be opened.

</pre><h4><b>ENCODINGS</b></h4><pre>
       If  your  Pod  is  encoded  in  something  other  than  Latin-1,  it should declare an encoding using the
       ""=encoding <u>encodingname</u>"" in perlpod directive.

</pre><h4><b>ADDING</b> <b>STOPWORDS</b></h4><pre>
       You can add stopwords on a per-document basis with "=for stopwords" / "=for :stopwords" regions, like so:

           =for stopwords  plok Pringe zorch   snik !qux
           foo bar baz quux quuux

       This adds every word in that paragraph after "stopwords" to the stopword list, effective for the rest  of
       the document.  In such a list, words are whitespace-separated.  (The amount of whitespace doesn't matter,
       as  long as there's no blank lines in the middle of the paragraph.)  Plural forms are added automatically
       using Lingua::EN::Inflect. Words beginning with "!" are <u>deleted</u> from  the  stopword  list  --  so  "!qux"
       deletes  "qux" from the stopword list, if it was in there in the first place.  Note that if a stopword is
       all-lowercase, then it means that it's okay in <u>any</u> case; but if the word has any capital letters, then it
       means that it's okay <u>only</u> with <u>that</u> case.  So a Wordlist entry of "perl" would permit "perl", "Perl", and
       (less interestingly) "PERL", "pERL", "PerL", et cetera.  However, a Wordlist entry of "Perl" catches only
       "Perl", not "perl".  So if you wanted to make sure you said only "Perl", never "perl", you could add this
       to the top of your document:

           =for stopwords !perl Perl

       Then all instances of the word "Perl" would be weeded out of the  Pod::Spell-formatted  version  of  your
       document,  but  any instances of the word "perl" would be left in (unless they were in a C&lt;...&gt; or F&lt;...&gt;
       style).

       You can have several "=for stopwords" regions in your document.  You can even express them like so:

           =begin stopwords

           plok Pringe zorch

           snik !qux

           foo bar
           baz quux quuux

           =end stopwords

       If you want to use E&lt;...&gt; sequences in a "stopwords" region, you have to use ":stopwords", as here:

           =for :stopwords
           virtE&lt;ugrave&gt;

       ...meaning that you're adding a stopword of "virtù".  If you left the ":" out, that would mean  you  were
       adding  a  stopword  of  "virtE&lt;ugrave&gt;" (with a literal E, a literal &lt;, etc), which will have no effect,
       since  any occurrences of virtE&lt;ugrave&gt; don't look like a normal human-language word anyway, and so would
       be screened out before the stopword list is consulted anyway.

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>finding</b> <b>stopwords</b> <b>defined</b> <b>with</b> <b>"=for"</b>
       Pod::Spell makes a single pass over the POD.  Stopwords must be added <b>before</b> they show up in the POD.

</pre><h4><b>HINT</b></h4><pre>
       If you feed output of Pod::Spell into your word processor and run a spell-check,  make  sure  you're  <u>not</u>
       also  running  a grammar-check -- because Pod::Spell drops words that it thinks are Perl symbols, jargon,
       or stopwords, this means you'll have ungrammatical sentences, what with words being missing and all.  And
       you don't need a grammar checker to tell you that.
