</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Tk::Pod::FindPods - find Pods installed on the current system

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Tk::Pod::FindPods;

           my $o = Tk::Pod::FindPods-&gt;new;
           $pods = $o-&gt;pod_find(-categorized =&gt; 1, -usecache =&gt; 1);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
   <b>pod_find</b>
       The <b>pod_find</b> method scans the current system for available Pod documentation. The keys of the returned
       hash reference are the names of the modules or Pods ("::" substituted by "/" --- this makes it easier for
       Tk::Pod::Tree, as the separator may only be of one character). The values are the corresponding
       filenames.

       If "-categorized" is specified, then the returned hash has an extra level with four categories: <b>perl</b> (for
       core language documentation), <b>pragma</b> (for pragma documentation like var or strict), <b>mod</b> (core or CPAN
       modules), and <b>script</b> (perl scripts with embedded Pod documentation). Otherwise, "-category" may be set to
       force the Pods into a category.

       By default, @INC is scanned for Pods. This can be overwritten by the "-directories" option (specify as an
       array reference).

       If "-usecache" is specified, then the list of Pods is cached (see cache directory). "-usecache" is
       disabled if "-categorized" is not set or "-directories" is set.

   <b>WriteCache</b>
       Write the Pod cache. The cache is written to the cache directory. The file name is constructed from the
       perl version, operation system and user id.

   <b>LoadCache()</b>
       Load the Pod cache, if possible.

   <b>Cache</b> <b>directory</b>
       By default the cache file is written to the directory <u><a href="file:~/.tkpod_cache">~/.tkpod_cache</a></u> (Unix systems), or the data
       directory as determined by File::HomeDir (Windows, MacOSX). If everything fails, then the temporary
       directory (<u><a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a></u> or the OS equivalent) is used.

       If necessary, then the last path component will be created (that is, <u>.tkpod_cache</u> will be created if the
       directory does not exist).

       To use another cache directory set the environment variable "TKPODCACHE".

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       TKPODCACHE
           Use  a  custom  cache  file instead of a file in the cache directory.  The following placeholders are
           recognized:

           %v  The perl version.

           %o  The OS (technically correct: the archname, which can include tokens like "64int" or "thread").

           %u  The user id.

           Example for using <u>/some/other/directory</u> for the cache file location:

                   TKPODCACHE=/some/other/directory/pods_%v_%o_%u; export TKPODCACHE

           or

                   setenv TKPODCACHE /some/other/directory/pods_%v_%o_%u

           depending on your shell (sh-like or csh-like).
