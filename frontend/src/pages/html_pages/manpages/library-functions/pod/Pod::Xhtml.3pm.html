       Pod::Xhtml - Generate well-formed XHTML documents from POD format documentation

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       This module inherits from Pod::Parser, hence you can use this familiar interface:

               use Pod::Xhtml;
               my $parser = new Pod::Xhtml;
               $parser-&gt;parse_from_file( $infile, $outfile );

               # or use filehandles instead
               $parser-&gt;parse_from_filehandle($in_fh, $out_fh);

               # or get the XHTML as a scalar
               my $parsertoo = new Pod::Xhtml( StringMode =&gt; 1 );
               $parsertoo-&gt;parse_from_file( $infile, $outfile );
               my $xhtml = $parsertoo-&gt;asString;

               # or get a reference to the XHTML string
               my $xhtmlref = $parsertoo-&gt;asStringRef;

               # to parse some other pod file to another output file all you need to do is...
               $parser-&gt;parse_from_file( $anotherinfile, $anotheroutfile );

       There are options specific to Pod::Xhtml that you can pass in at construction time, e.g.:

               my $parser = new Pod::Xhtml(StringMode =&gt; 1, MakeIndex =&gt; 0);

       See "OPTIONS". For more information also see Pod::Parser which this module inherits from.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       new Pod::Xhtml( [ OPTIONS ] )
           Create a new object. Optionally pass in some options in the form 'new Pod::Xhtml( StringMode =&gt; 1);'

       $parser-&gt;parse_from_file( INPUTFILE, [OUTPUTFILE] )
           Read  POD  from  the  input  file,  output  to  the  output file (or STDOUT if no file is given). See
           Pod::Parser docs for more.  Note that you can parse multiple files with the  same  object.  All  your
           options will be preserved, as will any text you added with the add*Text methods.

       $parser-&gt;parse_from_filehandle( [INPUTFILEHANDLE, [OUTPUTFILEHANDLE]] )
           Read POD from the input filehandle, output to the output filehandle (STDIN/STDOUT if no filehandle(s)
           given).  See Pod::Parser docs for more.  Note that you can parse multiple files with the same object.
           All your options will be preserved, as will any text you added with the add*Text methods.

       $parser-&gt;asString
           Get the XHTML as a scalar. You'll probably want to use this with the StringMode option.

       $parser-&gt;asStringRef
           As above, but you get a reference to the string, not the string itself.

       $parser-&gt;addHeadText( $text )
           Inserts some text just before the closing head tag. For example you can add a link to  a  stylesheet.
           May be called many times to add lots of text. Note: you need to call this some time <b>before</b> any output
           is done, e.g. straight after <b>new()</b>. Make sure that you only insert valid XHTML fragments.

       $parser-&gt;addBodyOpenText( $text ) / $parser-&gt;addBodyCloseText( $text )
           Inserts  some  text right at the beginning (or ending) of the body element. For example you can add a
           navigation header and footer.  May be called many times to add lots of text. Note: you need  to  call
           this  some  time <b>before</b> any output is done, e.g. straight after <b>new()</b>. Make sure that you only insert
           valid XHTML fragments.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       StringMode
           Default: 0. If set to 1 this does no output at all,  even  if  filenames/handles  are  supplied.  Use
           asString or asStringRef to access the text if you set this option.

       MakeIndex
           Default: 1. If set to 1 then an index of sections is created at the top of the body. If set to 2 then
           the index includes non-bulleted list items

       MakeMeta
           Default:  1.  If  set  to  1  then  some  meta  tags  are  created, recording things like input file,
           description, etc.

       FragmentOnly
           Default: 0. If 1, we only produce an XHTML fragment (suitable for use as a server-side include  etc).
           There is no HEAD element nor any BODY or HTML tags. Any text added with the add*Text methods will <b>not</b>
           be output.

       TopHeading
           Allows  you  to  set the starting heading level when in fragment mode.  For example, if your document
           already has h1 tags and you want the generated POD to nest inside the outline, you can specify

                   TopHeading =&gt; 2

           and "=head1" will be tagged with h2 tags, "=head3" with h3, and so on.

           Note that XHTML doesn't allow for heading tags past h6, so h7 and up will  be  translated  to  h6  as
           necessary.

       TopLinks
           At each section head this text is added to provide a link back to the top.  Set to 0 or '' to inhibit
           links, or define your own.

                   Default: &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#TOP" class="toplink"&gt;Top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

       LinkParser
           An object that parses links in the POD document. By default, this is a regular Pod::Hyperlink object.
           Any user-supplied link parser must conform the the Pod::Hyperlink API.

           This  module  works  with  a  Pod::Hyperlink::BounceURL  link  parser and generates hyperlinks as 'a'
           elements with a class of 'pod_xhtml_bounce_url'. The optional text giving the "node" is enclosed in a
           'strong' element with a class of 'pod_xhtml_bounce_url_text'

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       There's Pod::PXML and Pod::XML, so why do we need Pod::Xhtml? You need an  XSLT  to  transform  XML  into
       XHTML  and many people don't have the time or inclination to do this. But they want to make sure that the
       pages they put on their web site are well-formed, they want those pages to use  stylesheets  easily,  and
       possibly they want to squirt the XHTML through some kind of filter for more processing.

       By  generating  well-formed  XHTML  straight away we allow anyone to just use the output files as-is. For
       those who want to use XML tools or transformations they can use the XHTML as a  source,  because  it's  a
       well-formed XML document.

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
       This  module  outputs  well-formed  XHTML  if the POD is well-formed. To check this you can use something
       like:

               use Pod::Checker;
               my $syn = podchecker($defaultIn);

       If $syn is 0 there are no syntax errors. If it's -1 then no POD was found. Any positive number  indicates
       that  that number of errors were found. If the input POD has errors then the output XHTML <u>should</u> be well-
       formed but will probably omit information, and in addition  Pod::Xhtml  will  emit  warnings.  Note  that
       Pod::Parser  seems  to be sensitive to the current setting of $/ so ensure it's the end-of-line character
       when the parsing is done.
