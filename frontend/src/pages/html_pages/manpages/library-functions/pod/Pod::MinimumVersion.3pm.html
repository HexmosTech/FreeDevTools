</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Pod::MinimumVersion - Perl version for POD directives used

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        use Pod::MinimumVersion;
        my $pmv = Pod::MinimumVersion-&gt;new (filename =&gt; '/some/foo.pl');
        print $pmv-&gt;minimum_version,"\n";
        print $pmv-&gt;reports;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       "Pod::MinimumVersion" parses the POD in a Perl script, module, or document, and reports what version of
       Perl is required to process the directives in it with "pod2man" etc.

</pre><h4><b>CHECKS</b></h4><pre>
       The following POD features are identified.

       •   5.004: new "=for", "=begin" and "=end"

       •   5.005: new L&lt;display text|target&gt; style display part

       •   5.6.0: new C&lt;&lt; foo &gt;&gt; etc double-angles

       •   5.8.0: new "=head3" and "=head4"

       •   5.8.0:  new L&lt;<a href="http://some.where.com">http://some.where.com</a>&gt; URLs.  (Before 5.8 the "/" is a "section" separator, giving very
           poor output.)

       •   5.8.0: new E&lt;apos&gt;, E&lt;sol&gt;, E&lt;verbar&gt; chars.  (Documented in 5.6.0,  but  pod2man  doesn't  recognise
           them until 5.8.)

       •   5.10.0:  new  "=encoding"  command.   (Documented  in 5.8.0, but "pod2man" doesn't recognise it until
           5.10.)

       •   5.12.0: new L&lt;display text|<a href="http://some.where.com">http://some.where.com</a>&gt; URL with text.  (Before  5.12  the  combination  of
           display part and URL was explicitly disallowed by perlpodspec.)

       POD syntax errors are quietly ignored currently.  The intention is only to check what "pod2man" would act
       on but it's probably a good idea to use "Pod::Checker" first.

       "J&lt;&lt;  &gt;&gt;"  for  "Pod::MultiLang" is recognised and is allowed for any Perl, including with double-angles.
       The assumption is that if you're writing that then you'll first crunch with the  "Pod::MultiLang"  tools,
       so it's not important what "pod2man" thinks of it.

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       "$pmv = Pod::MinimumVersion-&gt;new (key =&gt; value, ...)"
           Create  and return a new "Pod::MinimumVersion" object which will analyze a document.  The document is
           supplied as one of

               filehandle =&gt; $fh,
               string     =&gt; 'something',
               filename   =&gt; '/my/dir/foo.pod',

           For "filehandle" and "string", a "filename" can be supplied too to give a name in the  reports.   The
           handle or string is what's actually read.

           The  "above_version"  option lets you set a Perl version of you have or are targeting, so reports are
           only about features above that level.

               above_version =&gt; '5.006',

       "$version = $pmv-&gt;minimum_version ()"
       "$report = $pmv-&gt;minimum_report ()"
           Return the minimum Perl required for the document in $pmv.

           "minimum_version" returns a "version"  number  object  (see  version).   "minimum_report"  returns  a
           "Pod::MinimumVersion::Report" object (see "REPORT OBJECTS" below).

       "@reports = $pmv-&gt;reports ()"
           Return a list of "Pod::MinimumVersion::Report" objects concerning the document in $pmv.

           These multiple reports let you identify multiple places that a particular Perl is required.  With the
           "above_version" option the reports are only about things higher than that.

           "minimum_version" and "minimum_report" are simply the highest Perl among these multiple reports.

</pre><h4><b>REPORT</b> <b>OBJECTS</b></h4><pre>
       A  "Pod::MinimumVersion::Report" object holds a location within a document and a reason that a particular
       Perl is needed at that point.  The hash fields are

           filename   string
           linenum    integer, with 1 for the first line
           version    version.pm object
           why        string

       "$str = $report-&gt;as_string"
           Return a formatted string for the report.  Currently this is in GNU file:line style, simply

               &lt;filename&gt;:&lt;linenum&gt;: &lt;version&gt; due to &lt;why&gt;
