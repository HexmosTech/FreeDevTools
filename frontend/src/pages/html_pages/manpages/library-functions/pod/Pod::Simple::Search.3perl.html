</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Pod::Simple::Search - find POD documents in directory trees

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Pod::Simple::Search;
         my $name2path = Pod::Simple::Search-&gt;new-&gt;limit_glob('LWP::*')-&gt;survey;
         print "Looky see what I found: ",
           join(' ', sort keys %$name2path), "\n";

         print "LWPUA docs = ",
           Pod::Simple::Search-&gt;new-&gt;find('LWP::UserAgent') || "?",
           "\n";

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Pod::Simple::Search</b> is a class that you use for running searches for Pod files.  An object of this class
       has several attributes (mostly options for controlling search options), and some methods for searching
       based on those attributes.

       The way to use this class is to make a new object of this class, set any options, and then call one of
       the search options (probably "survey" or "find").  The sections below discuss the syntaxes for doing all
       that.

</pre><h4><b>CONSTRUCTOR</b></h4><pre>
       This class provides the one constructor, called "new".  It takes no parameters:

         use Pod::Simple::Search;
         my $search = Pod::Simple::Search-&gt;new;

</pre><h4><b>ACCESSORS</b></h4><pre>
       This class defines several methods for setting (and, occasionally, reading) the contents of an object.
       With two exceptions (discussed at the end of this section), these attributes are just for controlling the
       way searches are carried out.

       Note that each of these return $self when you call them as "$self-&gt;<u>whatever(value)</u>".  That's so that you
       can chain together set-attribute calls like this:

         my $name2path =
           Pod::Simple::Search-&gt;new
           -&gt; <a href="../man0/inc.0.html">inc</a>(0) -&gt; <a href="../man1/verbose.1.html">verbose</a>(1) -&gt; callback(\&amp;blab)
           -&gt;survey(@there);

       ...which works exactly as if you'd done this:

         my $search = Pod::Simple::Search-&gt;new;
         $search-&gt;<a href="../man0/inc.0.html">inc</a>(0);
         $search-&gt;<a href="../man1/verbose.1.html">verbose</a>(1);
         $search-&gt;callback(\&amp;blab);
         my $name2path = $search-&gt;survey(@there);

       $search-&gt;inc( <u>true-or-false</u> );
           This  attribute, if set to a true value, means that searches should implicitly add perl's <u>@INC</u> paths.
           This automatically considers paths specified in the "PERL5LIB" environment as this  is  prepended  to
           <u>@INC</u>  by the Perl interpreter itself.  This attribute's default value is <b>TRUE</b>.  If you want to search
           only specific directories, set $self-&gt;<b><a href="../man0/inc.0.html">inc</a></b>(0) before calling $inc-&gt;survey or $inc-&gt;find.

       $search-&gt;verbose( <u>nonnegative-number</u> );
           This attribute, if set to a nonzero positive value, will make  searches  output  (via  "warn")  notes
           about  what  they're  doing  as  they  do  it.  This option may be useful for debugging a pod-related
           module.  This attribute's default value is zero,  meaning  that  no  "warn"  messages  are  produced.
           (Setting  verbose to 1 turns on some messages, and setting it to 2 turns on even more messages, i.e.,
           makes the following search(es) even more verbose than 1 would make them.)

       $search-&gt;limit_glob( <u>some-glob-string</u> );
           This option means that you want to limit the results just to items whose  podnames  match  the  given
           glob/wildcard  expression.  For example, you might limit your search to just "LWP::*", to search only
           for modules starting with "LWP::*" (but not including the module "LWP" itself); or  you  might  limit
           your  search to "LW*" to see only modules whose (full) names begin with "LW"; or you might search for
           "*Find*" to search for all modules with "Find" somewhere in their full name. (You can also use "?" in
           a glob expression; so "DB?" will match "DBI" and "DBD".)

       $search-&gt;callback( <u>\&amp;some_routine</u> );
           This attribute means that every time this search sees a  matching  Pod  file,  it  should  call  this
           callback  routine.   The  routine is called with two parameters: the current file's filespec, and its
           pod name.  (For example: "("/etc/perljunk/File/Crunk.pm", "File::Crunk")" would be in @_.)

           The callback routine's return value is not used for anything.

           This attribute's default value is false, meaning that no callback is called.

       $search-&gt;laborious( <u>true-or-false</u> );
           Unless you set this attribute to a true value, Pod::Search will  apply  Perl-specific  heuristics  to
           find  the  correct module PODs quickly.  This attribute's default value is false.  You won't normally
           need to set this to true.

           Specifically: Turning on this option will disable the heuristics for seeing only files with Perl-like
           extensions, omitting subdirectories that are numeric but do <u>not</u> match the current Perl  interpreter's
           version ID, suppressing <u>site_perl</u> as a module hierarchy name, etc.

       $search-&gt;recurse( <u>true-or-false</u> );
           Unless  you  set this attribute to a false value, Pod::Search will recurse into subdirectories of the
           search directories.

       $search-&gt;shadows( <u>true-or-false</u> );
           Unless you set this attribute to a true value, Pod::Simple::Search will consider only the first  file
           of  a  given modulename as it looks thru the specified directories; that is, with this option off, if
           Pod::Simple::Search has seen a "somepathdir/Foo/Bar.pm" already in this search, then it won't  bother
           looking  at  a  "somelaterpathdir/Foo/Bar.pm"  later on in that search, because that file is merely a
           "shadow". But if you turn on "$self-&gt;<a href="../man1/shadows.1.html">shadows</a>(1)", then these "shadow" files are  inspected  too,  and
           are noted in the pathname2podname return hash.

           This attribute's default value is false; and normally you won't need to turn it on.

       $search-&gt;is_case_insensitive( <u>true-or-false</u> );
           Pod::Simple::Search  will by default internally make an assumption based on the underlying filesystem
           where the class file is found whether it is case insensitive or not.

           If it is determined to be case insensitive, during <b>survey()</b> it may skip pod files/modules that happen
           to be equal to names it's already seen, ignoring case.

           However, it's possible to have distinct files in different directories  that  intentionally  has  the
           same  name,  just  differing  in  case, that should be reported. Hence, you may force the behavior by
           setting this to true or false.

       $search-&gt;limit_re( <u>some-regxp</u> );
           Setting this attribute (to a value that's a regexp) means that you want to limit the results just  to
           items  whose  podnames  match  the  given  regexp.  Normally  this option is not needed, and the more
           efficient "limit_glob" attribute is used instead.

       $search-&gt;dir_prefix( <u>some-string-value</u> );
           Setting this attribute to a string value means that  the  searches  should  begin  in  the  specified
           subdirectory  name  (like  "Pod"  or "File::Find", also expressible as "File/Find"). For example, the
           search option "$search-&gt;limit_glob("File::Find::R*")" is the same as the combination  of  the  search
           options "$search-&gt;limit_re("^File::Find::R") -&gt; dir_prefix("File::Find")".

           Normally  you  don't  need  to  know about the "dir_prefix" option, but I include it in case it might
           prove useful for someone somewhere.

           (Implementationally, searching with limit_glob ends up setting limit_re and usually dir_prefix.)

       $search-&gt;progress( <u>some-progress-object</u> );
           If you set a value for this attribute, the value is expected to be an object  (probably  of  a  class
           that you define) that has a "reach" method and a "done" method.  This is meant for reporting progress
           during the search, if you don't want to use a simple callback.

           Normally  you don't need to know about the "progress" option, but I include it in case it might prove
           useful for someone somewhere.

           While a search is in progress, the progress object's "reach" and "done" methods are called like this:

             # Every time a file is being scanned for pod:
             $progress-&gt;reach($count, "Scanning $file");   ++$count;

             # And then at the end of the search:
             $progress-&gt;done("Noted $count Pod files total");

           Internally, we often set this to an object of class Pod::Simple::Progress.  That  class  is  probably
           undocumented, but you may wish to look at its source.

       $name2path = $self-&gt;name2path;
           This  attribute  is  not  a search parameter, but is used to report the result of "survey" method, as
           discussed in the next section.

       $path2name = $self-&gt;path2name;
           This attribute is not a search parameter, but is used to report the result  of  "survey"  method,  as
           discussed in the next section.

</pre><h4><b>MAIN</b> <b>SEARCH</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       Once you've actually set any options you want (if any), you can go ahead and use the following methods to
       search for Pod files in particular ways.

   <b>"$search-&gt;survey(</b> <b>@directories</b> <b>)"</b>
       The method "survey" searches for POD documents in a given set of files and/or directories.  This runs the
       search according to the various options set by the accessors above.  (For example, if the "inc" attribute
       is  on,  as  it  is  by  default,  then  the  perl  @INC  directories are implicitly added to the list of
       directories (if any) that you specify.)

       The return value of "survey" is two hashes:

       "name2path"
           A   hash   that   maps   from   each   pod-name   to   the   filespec   (like    "Stuff::Thing"    =&gt;
           "/whatever/plib/Stuff/Thing.pm")

       "path2name"
           A  hash  that  maps  from  each Pod filespec to its pod-name (like "/whatever/plib/Stuff/Thing.pm" =&gt;
           "Stuff::Thing")

       Besides saving these hashes as the hashref attributes "name2path" and "path2name", calling this  function
       also  returns  these  hashrefs.   In  list  context,  the  return  value of "$search-&gt;survey" is the list
       "(\%name2path, \%path2name)".  In scalar context, the return value is "\%name2path".   Or  you  can  just
       call this in void context.

       Regardless  of  calling  context,  calling  "survey" saves its results in its "name2path" and "path2name"
       attributes.

       E.g., when searching in <u>$HOME/perl5lib</u>, the  file  <u>$HOME/perl5lib/MyModule.pm</u>  would  get  the  POD  name
       <u>MyModule</u>, whereas <u>$HOME/perl5lib/Myclass/Subclass.pm</u> would be <u>Myclass::Subclass</u>. The name information can
       be used for POD translators.

       Only text files containing at least one valid POD command are found.

       In  verbose  mode,  a warning is printed if shadows are found (i.e., more than one POD file with the same
       POD name is found, e.g. <u>CPAN.pm</u> in different directories).  This usually indicates duplicate  occurrences
       of  modules  in  the <u>@INC</u> search path, which is occasionally inadvertent (but is often simply a case of a
       user's path dir having a more recent version than the system's general path dirs in general.)

       The options to this argument is a list of either directories that are  searched  recursively,  or  files.
       (Usually  you  wouldn't  specify  files,  but  just  dirs.)  Or you can just specify an empty-list, as in
       $name2path; with the "inc" option on, as it is by default.

       The POD names of files are the plain basenames with any Perl-like extension (.pm,  .pl,  .pod)  stripped,
       and path separators replaced by "::"'s.

       Calling  Pod::Simple::Search-&gt;search(...) is short for Pod::Simple::Search-&gt;new-&gt;search(...).  That is, a
       throwaway object with default attribute values is used.

   <b>"$search-&gt;simplify_name(</b> <b>$str</b> <b>)"</b>
       The method <b>simplify_name</b> is equivalent to <b>basename</b>, but also strips Perl-like extensions (.pm, .pl, .pod)
       and extensions like <u>.bat</u>, <u>.cmd</u> on Win32 and OS/2, or <u>.com</u> on VMS, respectively.

   <b>"$search-&gt;find(</b> <b>$pod</b> <b>)"</b>
   <b>"$search-&gt;find(</b> <b>$pod,</b> <b>@search_dirs</b> <b>)"</b>
       Returns the location of a Pod file, given a Pod/module/script  name  (like  "Foo::Bar"  or  "perlvar"  or
       "perldoc"),  and  an  idea  of  what  files/directories to look in.  It searches according to the various
       options set by the accessors above.  (For example, if the "inc" attribute is on, as  it  is  by  default,
       then  the  perl  @INC  directories  are  implicitly  added  to  the list of directories (if any) that you
       specify.)

       This returns the full path of  the  first  occurrence  to  the  file.   Package  names  (eg  'A::B')  are
       automatically  converted  to  directory  names in the selected directory.  Additionally, '.pm', '.pl' and
       '.pod' are automatically appended to the search as required.  (So, for example,  under  Unix,  "A::B"  is
       converted to "somedir/A/B.pm", "somedir/A/B.pod", or "somedir/A/B.pl", as appropriate.)

       If no such Pod file is found, this method returns undef.

       If any of the given search directories contains a <u>pod/</u> subdirectory, then it is searched.  (That's how we
       manage to find <u>perlfunc</u>, for example, which is usually in <u>pod/perlfunc</u> in most Perl dists.)

       The  "verbose"  and "inc" attributes influence the behavior of this search; notably, "inc", if true, adds
       @INC <u>and</u> <u>also</u> <u>$Config::Config{'scriptdir'}</u> to the list of directories to search.

       It is common to simply say "$filename = Pod::Simple::Search-&gt; new -&gt;find("perlvar")"  so  that  just  the
       @INC  (well,  and scriptdir) directories are searched.  (This happens because the "inc" attribute is true
       by default.)

       Calling Pod::Simple::Search-&gt;find(...) is short  for  Pod::Simple::Search-&gt;new-&gt;find(...).   That  is,  a
       throwaway object with default attribute values is used.

   <b>"$self-&gt;contains_pod(</b> <b>$file</b> <b>)"</b>
       Returns true if the supplied filename (not POD module) contains some Pod documentation.
