       Pod::Man - Convert POD data to formatted *roff input

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Pod::Man;
           my $parser = Pod::Man-&gt;new (release =&gt; $VERSION, section =&gt; 8);

           # Read POD from STDIN and write to STDOUT.
           $parser-&gt;parse_file (\*STDIN);

           # Read POD from file.pod and write to file.1.
           $parser-&gt;parse_from_file ('file.pod', 'file.1');

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Pod::Man is a module to convert documentation in the POD format (the preferred language for documenting
       Perl) into *roff input using the man macro set.  The resulting *roff code is suitable for display on a
       terminal using <b><a href="../man1/nroff.1.html">nroff</a></b>(1), normally via <b><a href="../man1/man.1.html">man</a></b>(1), or printing using <b><a href="../man1/troff.1.html">troff</a></b>(1).  It is conventionally invoked
       using the driver script <b>pod2man</b>, but it can also be used directly.

       By default (on non-EBCDIC systems), Pod::Man outputs UTF-8.  Its output should work with the <b>man</b> program
       on systems that use <b>groff</b> (most Linux distributions) or <b>mandoc</b> (most BSD variants), but may result in
       mangled output on older UNIX systems.  To choose a different, possibly more backward-compatible output
       mangling on such systems, set the "encoding" option to "roff" (the default in earlier Pod::Man versions).
       See the "encoding" option and "ENCODING" for more details.

       See "COMPATIBILTY" for the versions of Pod::Man with significant backward-incompatible changes (other
       than constructor options, whose versions are documented below), and the versions of Perl that included
       them.

</pre><h4><b>CLASS</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       new(ARGS)
           Create  a  new  Pod::Man object.  ARGS should be a list of key/value pairs, where the keys are chosen
           from the following.  Each option is annotated with the version of Pod::Man in which that  option  was
           added with its current meaning.

           center
               [1.00]  Sets  the  centered  page header for the ".TH" macro.  The default, if this option is not
               specified, is "User Contributed Perl Documentation".

           date
               [4.00] Sets the left-hand footer for the ".TH" macro.  If this option is not set, the contents of
               the environment variable POD_MAN_DATE, if  set,  will  be  used.   Failing  that,  the  value  of
               SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH,  the  modification date of the input file, or the current time if <b>stat()</b> can't
               find that file (which will be the case if the input is from "STDIN") will be used.  If taken from
               any source other than POD_MAN_DATE (which is used  verbatim),  the  date  will  be  formatted  as
               "YYYY-MM-DD"  and  will  be  based  on UTC (so that the output will be reproducible regardless of
               local time zone).

           encoding
               [5.00] Specifies the encoding of the output.  The value must be an  encoding  recognized  by  the
               Encode  module  (see Encode::Supported), or the special values "roff" or "groff".  The default on
               non-EBCDIC systems is UTF-8.

               If the output contains characters that cannot be represented in this encoding, that is  an  error
               that  will  be  reported  as  configured by the "errors" option.  If error handling is other than
               "die", the unrepresentable character will be replaced  with  the  Encode  substitution  character
               (normally "?").

               If  the "encoding" option is set to the special value "groff" (the default on EBCDIC systems), or
               if the Encode module is not available and the encoding is set  to  anything  other  than  "roff",
               Pod::Man  will  translate  all non-ASCII characters to "\[uNNNN]" Unicode escapes.  These are not
               traditionally part of the *roff language, but are supported by <b>groff</b> and <b>mandoc</b> and thus  by  the
               majority of manual page processors in use today.

               If  the  "encoding"  option  is  set  to  the special value "roff", Pod::Man will do its historic
               transformation of (some) ISO 8859-1 characters into *roff escapes that may be adequate  in  troff
               and  may  be  readable (if ugly) in nroff.  This was the default behavior of versions of Pod::Man
               before 5.00.  With this encoding, all other non-ASCII characters will be replaced with  "X".   It
               may  be  required for very old troff and nroff implementations that do not support UTF-8, but its
               representation of any non-ASCII character is very poor and often specific to European languages.

               If the output file handle has a PerlIO encoding layer set, setting "encoding" to  anything  other
               than "groff" or "roff" will be ignored and no encoding will be done by Pod::Man.  It will instead
               rely on the encoding layer to make whatever output encoding transformations are desired.

               WARNING:  The  input  encoding  of  the  POD  source is independent from the output encoding, and
               setting this option does not affect the interpretation of the POD input.  Unless your POD  source
               is US-ASCII, its encoding should be declared with the "=encoding" command in the source.  If this
               is  not  done,  Pod::Simple will will attempt to guess the encoding and may be successful if it's
               Latin-1 or UTF-8, but it will produce warnings.  See <b><a href="../man1/perlpod.1.html">perlpod</a></b>(1) for more information.

           errors
               [2.27] How to report errors.  "die" says to throw an  exception  on  any  POD  formatting  error.
               "stderr"  says  to report errors on standard error, but not to throw an exception.  "pod" says to
               include a POD ERRORS section in the  resulting  documentation  summarizing  the  errors.   "none"
               ignores POD errors entirely, as much as possible.

               The default is "pod".

           fixed
               [1.00]  The  fixed-width font to use for verbatim text and code.  Defaults to "CW".  Some systems
               prefer "CR" instead.  Only matters for <b>troff</b> output.

           fixedbold
               [1.00] Bold version of the fixed-width font.  Defaults to "CB".  Only matters for <b>troff</b> output.

           fixeditalic
               [1.00] Italic version of the fixed-width font (something of a misnomer,  since  most  fixed-width
               fonts  only have an oblique version, not an italic version).  Defaults to "CI".  Only matters for
               <b>troff</b> output.

           fixedbolditalic
               [1.00] Bold italic (in theory, probably oblique in practice) version  of  the  fixed-width  font.
               Pod::Man doesn't assume you have this, and defaults to "CB".  Some systems (such as Solaris) have
               this font available as "CX".  Only matters for <b>troff</b> output.

           guesswork
               [5.00]  By default, Pod::Man applies some default formatting rules based on guesswork and regular
               expressions that are intended to make writing Perl documentation easier and require less explicit
               markup.  These rules may not always be appropriate, particularly  for  documentation  that  isn't
               about Perl.  This option allows turning all or some of it off.

               The  special  value  "all"  enables  all  guesswork.   This  is  also  the  default  for backward
               compatibility reasons.  The special value "none" disables all guesswork.  Otherwise, the value of
               this option should be a comma-separated list of one or more of the following keywords:

               functions
                   Convert function references like foo() to bold even if they have  no  markup.   The  function
                   name  accepts  valid  Perl  characters  for  function names (including ":"), and the trailing
                   parentheses must be present and empty.

               manref
                   Make the first part (before the parentheses) of manual page references like <a href="../man1/foo.1.html">foo</a>(1) bold  even
                   if they have no markup.  The section must be a single number optionally followed by lowercase
                   letters.

               quoting
                   If  no guesswork is enabled, any text enclosed in C&lt;&gt; is surrounded by double quotes in nroff
                   (terminal) output unless the contents are already quoted.  When this  guesswork  is  enabled,
                   quote  marks  will  also  be  suppressed  for Perl variables, function names, function calls,
                   numbers, and hex constants.

               variables
                   Convert Perl variable names to a  fixed-width  font  even  if  they  have  no  markup.   This
                   transformation  will  only  be  apparent in troff output, or some other output format (unlike
                   nroff terminal output) that supports fixed-width fonts.

               Any unknown guesswork name is silently  ignored  (for  potential  future  compatibility),  so  be
               careful about spelling.

           language
               [5.00]  Add  commands  telling  <b>groff</b> that the input file is in the given language.  The value of
               this setting must be a language abbreviation for which <b>groff</b> provides supplemental configuration,
               such as "ja" (for Japanese) or "zh" (for Chinese).

               Specifically, this adds:

                   .mso &lt;language&gt;.tmac
                   .hla &lt;language&gt;

               to the start of the file, which configure correct  line  breaking  for  the  specified  language.
               Without these commands, groff may not know how to add proper line breaks for Chinese and Japanese
               text  if  the  manual  page  is  installed  into  the  normal  manual  page  directory,  such  as
               <u><a href="file:/usr/share/man">/usr/share/man</a></u>.

               On many systems, this will be done automatically if the manual page is installed into a language-
               specific manual page directory, such as <u><a href="file:/usr/share/man/zh_CN">/usr/share/man/zh_CN</a></u>.  In that case, this option  is  not
               required.

               Unfortunately,  the  commands added with this option are specific to <b>groff</b> and will not work with
               other <b>troff</b> and <b>nroff</b> implementations.

           lquote
           rquote
               [4.08] Sets the quote marks used to surround C&lt;&gt; text.  "lquote" sets the  left  quote  mark  and
               "rquote" sets the right quote mark.  Either may also be set to the special value "none", in which
               case  no  quote  mark  is added on that side of C&lt;&gt; text (but the font is still changed for troff
               output).

               Also see the "quotes" option, which can be used to set both quotes at once.  If both "quotes" and
               one of the other options is set, "lquote" or "rquote" overrides "quotes".

           name
               [4.08] Set the name of the manual page for the ".TH" macro.  Without this option, the manual name
               is set to the uppercased base name of the file being converted unless the manual section is 3, in
               which case the path is parsed to see if it is a  Perl  module  path.   If  it  is,  a  path  like
               ".../lib/Pod/Man.pm"  is converted into a name like "Pod::Man".  This option, if given, overrides
               any automatic determination of the name.

               If generating a manual page from standard input, the name will be set to "STDIN" if  this  option
               is not provided.  In this case, providing this option is strongly recommended to set a meaningful
               manual page name.

           nourls
               [2.27]  Normally,  L&lt;&gt; formatting codes with a URL but anchor text are formatted to show both the
               anchor text and the URL.  In other words:

                   L&lt;foo|<a href="http://example.com/">http://example.com/</a>&gt;

               is formatted as:

                   foo &lt;<a href="http://example.com/">http://example.com/</a>&gt;

               This option, if set to a true value, suppresses the URL  when  anchor  text  is  given,  so  this
               example  would be formatted as just "foo".  This can produce less cluttered output in cases where
               the URLs are not particularly important.

           quotes
               [4.00] Sets the quote marks used to surround C&lt;&gt; text.  If the value is a single character, it is
               used as both the left and right quote.  Otherwise, it is split in half, and the first half of the
               string is used as the left quote and the second is used as the right quote.

               This may also be set to the special value "none", in which case no quote marks are  added  around
               C&lt;&gt; text (but the font is still changed for troff output).

               Also  see  the  "lquote" and "rquote" options, which can be used to set the left and right quotes
               independently.  If both "quotes" and one of the  other  options  is  set,  "lquote"  or  "rquote"
               overrides "quotes".

           release
               [1.00]  Set  the  centered footer for the ".TH" macro.  By default, this is set to the version of
               Perl you  run  Pod::Man  under.   Setting  this  to  the  empty  string  will  cause  some  *roff
               implementations to use the system default value.

               Note that some system "an" macro sets assume that the centered footer will be a modification date
               and  will  prepend something like "Last modified: ".  If this is the case for your target system,
               you may want to set "release" to the last modified date and "date" to the version number.

           section
               [1.00] Set the section for the ".TH" macro.  The standard section numbering convention is to  use
               1  for  user  commands, 2 for system calls, 3 for functions, 4 for devices, 5 for file formats, 6
               for games, 7 for miscellaneous information, and 8 for administrator commands.  There is a lot  of
               variation  here, however; some systems (like Solaris) use 4 for file formats, 5 for miscellaneous
               information, and 7 for devices.  Still others use 1m instead of 8, or some mix  of  both.   About
               the only section numbers that are reliably consistent are 1, 2, and 3.

               By  default, section 1 will be used unless the file ends in ".pm" in which case section 3 will be
               selected.

           stderr
               [2.19] If set to a true value, send error messages about invalid POD to standard error instead of
               appending a POD ERRORS section to the generated *roff output.   This  is  equivalent  to  setting
               "errors" to "stderr" if "errors" is not already set.

               This  option  is for backward compatibility with Pod::Man versions that did not support "errors".
               Normally, the "errors" option should be used instead.

           utf8
               [2.21] This option used to set the output encoding to UTF-8.  Since this is now the  default,  it
               is ignored and does nothing.

</pre><h4><b>INSTANCE</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       As  a derived class from Pod::Simple, Pod::Man supports the same methods and interfaces.  See Pod::Simple
       for all the details.  This section summarizes the most-frequently-used methods  and  the  ones  added  by
       Pod::Man.

       output_fh(FH)
           Direct  the output from <b>parse_file()</b>, <b>parse_lines()</b>, or <b>parse_string_document()</b> to the file handle FH
           instead of "STDOUT".

       output_string(REF)
           Direct the output from <b>parse_file()</b>, <b>parse_lines()</b>, or <b>parse_string_document()</b> to the scalar variable
           pointed to by REF, rather than "STDOUT".  For example:

               my $man = Pod::Man-&gt;new();
               my $output;
               $man-&gt;output_string(\$output);
               $man-&gt;parse_file('/some/input/file');

           Be aware that the output in that variable will already be encoded in UTF-8.

       parse_file(PATH)
           Read the POD source from PATH and format it.  By default, the output is sent to  "STDOUT",  but  this
           can be changed with the <b>output_fh()</b> or <b>output_string()</b> methods.

       parse_from_file(INPUT, OUTPUT)
       parse_from_filehandle(FH, OUTPUT)
           Read the POD source from INPUT, format it, and output the results to OUTPUT.

           <b>parse_from_filehandle()</b>  is  provided  for  backward  compatibility  with older versions of Pod::Man.
           <b>parse_from_file()</b> should be used instead.

       parse_lines(LINES[, ...[, undef]])
           Parse the provided lines as POD source, writing the output to either "STDOUT" or the file handle  set
           with  the  <b>output_fh()</b>  or  <b>output_string()</b> methods.  This method can be called repeatedly to provide
           more input lines.  An explicit "undef" should be passed to indicate the end of input.

           This method expects raw bytes, not decoded characters.

       parse_string_document(INPUT)
           Parse the provided scalar variable as POD source, writing the output to either "STDOUT" or  the  file
           handle set with the <b>output_fh()</b> or <b>output_string()</b> methods.

           This method expects raw bytes, not decoded characters.

</pre><h4><b>ENCODING</b></h4><pre>
       As  of  Pod::Man  5.00, the default output encoding for Pod::Man is UTF-8.  This should work correctly on
       any modern system that uses either <b>groff</b> (most Linux distributions) or <b>mandoc</b> (Alpine Linux and most  BSD
       variants, including macOS).

       The user will probably have to use a UTF-8 locale to see correct output.  This may be done by default; if
       not,  set  the  LANG  or LC_CTYPE environment variables to an appropriate local.  The locale "C.UTF-8" is
       available on most systems if one wants correct output without changing the other things  locales  affect,
       such as collation.

       The  backward-compatible  output format used in Pod::Man versions before 5.00 is available by setting the
       "encoding" option to "roff".  This may produce marginally nicer results on older UNIX  versions  that  do
       not  use  <b>groff</b>  or <b>mandoc</b>, but none of the available options will correctly render Unicode characters on
       those systems.

       Below are some additional details about how this choice was made and some discussion of alternatives.

   <b>History</b>
       The default output encoding for Pod::Man has been a  long-standing  problem.   <b>troff</b>  and  <b>nroff</b>  predate
       Unicode  by  a  significant  margin, and their implementations for many UNIX systems reflect that legacy.
       It's common for Unicode to not be supported in any form.

       Because of this, versions of Pod::Man prior to 5.00 maintained the  highly  conservative  output  of  the
       original  pod2man,  which  output  pure  ASCII  with  complex  macros to simulate common western European
       accented characters when processed with troff.  The nroff output was awkward and sometimes incorrect, and
       characters not used in western European scripts were replaced with "X".  This choice maximized  backwards
       compatibility  with  <b>man</b>  and  <b>nroff</b>/<b>troff</b> implementations at the cost of incorrect rendering of many POD
       documents, particularly those containing people's names.

       The modern implementations, <b>groff</b> (used in most  Linux  distributions)  and  <b>mandoc</b>  (used  by  most  BSD
       variants),  do  now support Unicode.  Other UNIX systems often do not, but they're now a tiny minority of
       the systems people use on a daily basis.  It's increasingly common (for very good reasons) to use Unicode
       characters for POD documents rather than using ASCII conversions  of  people's  names  or  avoiding  non-
       English text, making the limitations in the old output format more apparent.

       Four options have been proposed to fix this:

       • Optionally  support  UTF-8  output  but  don't  change  the  default.  This is the approach taken since
         Pod::Man 2.1.0, which added the "utf8" option.  Some Pod::Man users use this option for  better  output
         on  platforms  known  to  support Unicode, but since the defaults have not changed, people continued to
         encounter (and file bug reports about) the poor default rendering.

       • Convert characters to troff "\(xx" escapes.  This requires maintaining a large  translation  table  and
         addresses  only  a tiny part of the problem, since many Unicode characters have no standard troff name.
         <b>groff</b> has the largest list, but if one is willing to assume <b>groff</b> is the formatter, the next option  is
         better.

       • Convert  characters to groff "\[uNNNN]" escapes.  This is implemented as the "groff" encoding for those
         who want to use it, and is supported by both <b>groff</b> and <b>mandoc</b>.  However, it is  no  better  than  UTF-8
         output for portability to other implementations.  See "Testing results" for more details.

       • Change  the  default  output  format  to UTF-8 and ask those who want maximum backward compatibility to
         explicitly select the old encoding.  This fixes the issue for most  users  at  the  cost  of  backwards
         compatibility.   While  the  rendering of non-ASCII characters is different on older systems that don't
         support UTF-8, it's not always worse than the old output.

       Pod::Man 5.00 and later makes the last choice.  This arguably produces worse output when manual pages are
       formatted with <b>troff</b> into PostScript or PDF, but doing this is rare and normally manual, so the  encoding
       can be changed in those cases.  The older output encoding is available by setting "encoding" to "roff".

   <b>Testing</b> <b>results</b>
       Here  is  the  results  of testing "encoding" values of "utf-8" and "groff" on various operating systems.
       The testing methodology  was  to  create  <u>man/man1</u>  in  the  current  directory,  copy  <u>encoding.utf8</u>  or
       <u>encoding.groff</u> from the podlators 5.00 distribution to <u>man/man1/encoding.1</u>, and then run:

           LANG=C.UTF-8 MANPATH=$(pwd)/man man 1 encoding

       If  the  locale  is  not  explicitly  set to one that includes UTF-8, the Unicode characters were usually
       converted to ASCII (by, for example, dropping an accent) or deleted or replaced with "&lt;?&gt;" if  there  was
       no conversion.

       Tested on 2022-09-25.  Many thanks to the GCC Compile Farm project for access to testing hosts.

       I  did not have access to a macOS system for testing, but since it uses <b>mandoc</b>, it's behavior is probably
       the same as the BSD hosts.

       Notes:

       [1] Unicode characters were converted to one or two random ASCII characters  unrelated  to  the  original
           character.

       [2] Unicode characters were shown as the body of the groff escape rather than the indicated character (in
           other words, text like "[u00EF]").

       [3] Unicode  characters  were  deleted entirely, as if they weren't there.  Using "nroff -man" instead of
           <b>man</b> to format the page showed the same results as Solaris 10.  Using "groff -k -man -Tutf8" to format
           the page produced the correct output.

       PostScript and PDF output using groff on a Debian 12 system do not support combining accent marks or  SMP
       characters due to a lack of support in the default output font.

       Testing on additional platforms is welcome.  Please let the author know if you have additional results.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       roff font should be 1 or 2 chars, not "%s"
           (F)  You  specified  a  *roff  font  (using "fixed", "fixedbold", etc.) that wasn't either one or two
           characters.  Pod::Man doesn't support *roff fonts longer than two  characters,  although  some  *roff
           extensions do (the canonical versions of <b>nroff</b> and <b>troff</b> don't either).

       Invalid errors setting "%s"
           (F) The "errors" parameter to the constructor was set to an unknown value.

       Invalid quote specification "%s"
           (F)  The  quote  specification  given  (the "quotes" option to the constructor) was invalid.  A quote
           specification must be either one character long or an even number (greater than one) characters long.

       POD document had syntax errors
           (F) The POD document being formatted had syntax errors and the "errors" option was set to "die".

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       PERL_CORE
           If set and Encode is not available, silently fall back to an encoding of "groff" without  complaining
           to  standard  error.   This  environment  variable is set during Perl core builds, which build Encode
           after podlators.  Encode is expected to not (yet) be available in that case.

       POD_MAN_DATE
           If set, this will be used as the value of the left-hand footer unless the "date" option is explicitly
           set, overriding the timestamp of the input file or the current time.  This  is  primarily  useful  to
           ensure  reproducible  builds of the same output file given the same source and Pod::Man version, even
           when file timestamps may not be consistent.

       SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH
           If set, and POD_MAN_DATE and the "date" options are not set, this will be used  as  the  modification
           time  of  the source file, overriding the timestamp of the input file or the current time.  It should
           be set to the desired time in  seconds  since  UNIX  epoch.   This  is  primarily  useful  to  ensure
           reproducible  builds  of  the  same output file given the same source and Pod::Man version, even when
           file          timestamps          may           not           be           consistent.            See
           &lt;https://reproducible-builds.org/specs/source-date-epoch/&gt; for the full specification.

           (Arguably,  according to the specification, this variable should be used only if the timestamp of the
           input file is not available and Pod::Man uses the current time.  However, for reproducible builds  in
           Debian, results were more reliable if this variable overrode the timestamp of the input file.)

</pre><h4><b>COMPATIBILITY</b></h4><pre>
       Pod::Man 1.02 (based on Pod::Parser) was the first version included with Perl, in Perl 5.6.0.

       The  current  API  based  on  Pod::Simple was added in Pod::Man 2.00.  Pod::Man 2.04 was included in Perl
       5.9.3, the first version of Perl to incorporate those changes.  This is the first version that  correctly
       supports   all  modern  POD  syntax.   The  <b>parse_from_filehandle()</b>  method  was  re-added  for  backward
       compatibility in Pod::Man 2.09, included in Perl 5.9.4.

       Support for anchor text in L&lt;&gt; links of type URL was added in Pod::Man 2.23, included in Perl 5.11.5.

       <b>parse_lines()</b>, <b>parse_string_document()</b>, and <b>parse_file()</b> set a default output file handle of "STDOUT"  if
       one was not already set as of Pod::Man 2.28, included in Perl 5.19.5.

       Support  for  SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH and POD_MAN_DATE was added in Pod::Man 4.00, included in Perl 5.23.7, and
       generated dates were changed to use UTC instead of the local time zone.  This is also the  first  release
       that  aligned  the module version and the version of the podlators distribution.  All modules included in
       podlators, and the podlators distribution itself, share the same version number from this point forward.

       Pod::Man 4.10, included in Perl 5.27.8, changed the formatting for manual page  references  and  function
       names to bold instead of italic, following the current Linux manual page standard.

       Pod::Man  5.00  changed the default output encoding to UTF-8, overridable with the new "encoding" option.
       It also fixed problems with bold or italic extending too far  when  used  with  C&lt;&gt;  escapes,  and  began
       converting  Unicode zero-width spaces (U+200B) to the "\:" *roff escape.  It also dropped attempts to add
       subtle formatting corrections in the output that would only be visible when typeset with <b>troff</b>, which had
       previously been a significant source of bugs.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       There are numerous bugs and language-specific assumptions in the nroff fallbacks for accented  characters
       in  the "roff" encoding.  Since the point of this encoding is backward compatibility with the output from
       earlier versions of Pod::Man, and it is deprecated except when necessary to support  old  systems,  those
       bugs are unlikely to ever be fixed.

       Pod::Man  doesn't  handle  font names longer than two characters.  Neither do most <b>troff</b> implementations,
       but groff does as an extension.  It would be nice to support as an option for those who want to use it.

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Sentence</b> <b>spacing</b>
       Pod::Man copies the input spacing verbatim to the output *roff document.  This means your output will  be
       affected by how <b>nroff</b> generally handles sentence spacing.

       <b>nroff</b>  dates  from an era in which it was standard to use two spaces after sentences, and will always add
       two spaces after a line-ending period (or similar punctuation) when reflowing  text.   For  example,  the
       following input:

           =pod

           One sentence.
           Another sentence.

       will  result  in  two  spaces  after  the  period when the text is reflowed.  If you use two spaces after
       sentences anyway, this will be consistent, although you will have to be careful to not end a line with an
       abbreviation such as "e.g."  or "Ms.".  Output will also be consistent if you use the *roff  style  guide
       (and  XKCD  1285  &lt;https://xkcd.com/1285/&gt;)  recommendation  of putting a line break after each sentence,
       although that will consistently produce two spaces after each sentence, which may not be what you want.

       If you prefer one space after sentences (which is the more modern style), you will unfortunately need  to
       ensure  that  no line in the middle of a paragraph ends in a period or similar sentence-ending paragraph.
       Otherwise, <b>nroff</b> will add a two spaces after that sentence when reflowing, and your output document  will
       have inconsistent spacing.

   <b>Hyphens</b>
       The  handling  of  hyphens  versus dashes is somewhat fragile, and one may get a the wrong one under some
       circumstances.  This will normally only matter for line breaking and possibly for troff output.
