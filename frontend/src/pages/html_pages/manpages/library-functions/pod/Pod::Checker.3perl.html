</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Pod::Checker - check pod documents for syntax errors

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Pod::Checker;

         $syntax_okay = podchecker($filepath, $outputpath, %options);

         my $checker = Pod::Checker-&gt;new(%options);
         $checker-&gt;parse_from_file($filepath, \*STDERR);

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS/ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       $filepath is the input POD to read and $outputpath is where to write POD syntax error messages. Either
       argument may be a scalar indicating a file-path, or else a reference to an open filehandle.  If
       unspecified, the input-file it defaults to "\*STDIN", and the output-file defaults to "\*STDERR".

   <b>podchecker()</b>
       This function can take a hash of options:

       <b>-warnings</b> =&gt; <u>val</u>
           Turn  warnings  on/off.  <u>val</u>  is usually 1 for on, but higher values trigger additional warnings. See
           "Warnings".

       <b>-quiet</b> =&gt; <u>val</u>
           If "val" is true, do not print any errors/warnings.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>podchecker</b> will perform syntax checking of Perl5 POD format documentation.

       Curious/ambitious users are welcome to propose additional features they wish to see in  <b>Pod::Checker</b>  and
       <b>podchecker</b> and verify that the checks are consistent with perlpod.

       The following checks are currently performed:

       •   Unknown '=xxxx' commands, unknown 'X&lt;...&gt;' interior-sequences, and unterminated interior sequences.

       •   Check  for  proper  balancing  of  "=begin"  and  "=end".  The contents of such a block are generally
           ignored, i.e. no syntax checks are performed.

       •   Check for proper nesting and balancing of "=over", "=item" and "=back".

       •   Check for same nested interior-sequences (e.g.  "L&lt;...L&lt;...&gt;...&gt;").

       •   Check for malformed or non-existing entities "E&lt;...&gt;".

       •   Check for correct syntax of hyperlinks "L&lt;...&gt;". See perlpod for details.

       •   Check for unresolved document-internal links. This check may also reveal misspelled links  that  seem
           to be internal links but should be links to something else.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Errors</b>
       •   empty =headn

           A heading ("=head1" or "=head2") without any text? That ain't no heading!

       •   =over on line <u>N</u> without closing =back

       •   You forgot a '=back' before '=head<u>N</u>'

       •   =over is the last thing in the document?!

           The  "=over"  command  does  not  have  a  corresponding "=back" before the next heading ("=head1" or
           "=head2") or the end of the file.

       •   '=item' outside of any '=over'

       •   =back without =over

           An "=item" or "=back" command has been found outside a "=over"/"=back" block.

       •   Can't have a 0 in =over <u>N</u>

           You need to indent a strictly positive number of spaces, not 0.

       •   =over should be: '=over' or '=over positive_number'

           Either have an argumentless =over, or have its argument a strictly positive number.

       •   =begin <u>TARGET</u> without matching =end <u>TARGET</u>

           A "=begin" command was found that has no matching =end command.

       •   =begin without a target?

           A "=begin" command was found that is not followed by the formatter specification.

       •   =end <u>TARGET</u> without matching =begin.

           A standalone "=end" command was found.

       •   '=end' without a target?

           '=end' directives need to have a target, just like =begin directives.

       •   '=end <u>TARGET</u>' is invalid.

           <u>TARGET</u> needs to be one word

       •   =end <u>CONTENT</u> doesn't match =begin <u>TARGET</u>

           <u>CONTENT</u> needs to match =begin's <u>TARGET</u>.

       •   =for without a target?

           There is no specification of the formatter after the "=for" command.

       •   unresolved internal link <u>NAME</u>

           The given link to <u>NAME</u> does not have a matching node in the current POD. This also  happened  when  a
           single word node name is not enclosed in "".

       •   Unknown directive: <u>CMD</u>

           An  invalid  POD  command  has been found. Valid are "=head1", "=head2", "=head3", "=head4", "=over",
           "=item", "=back", "=begin", "=end", "=for", "=pod", "=cut"

       •   Deleting unknown formatting code <u>SEQ</u>

           An invalid markup command has been encountered. Valid are: "B&lt;&gt;", "C&lt;&gt;", "E&lt;&gt;", "F&lt;&gt;", "I&lt;&gt;",  "L&lt;&gt;",
           "S&lt;&gt;", "X&lt;&gt;", "Z&lt;&gt;"

       •   Unterminated <u>SEQ</u>&lt;&gt; sequence

           An unclosed formatting code

       •   An E&lt;...&gt; surrounding strange content

           The <u>STRING</u> found cannot be interpreted as a character entity.

       •   An empty E&lt;&gt;

       •   An empty "L&lt;&gt;"

       •   An empty X&lt;&gt;

           There needs to be content inside E, L, and X formatting codes.

       •   Spurious text after =pod / =cut

           The commands "=pod" and "=cut" do not take any arguments.

       •   =back doesn't take any parameters, but you said =back <u>ARGUMENT</u>

           The "=back" command does not take any arguments.

       •   =pod directives shouldn't be over one line long!  Ignoring all <u>N</u> lines of content

           Self explanatory

       •   =cut found outside a pod block.

           A '=cut' directive found in the middle of non-POD

       •   Invalid =encoding syntax: <u>CONTENT</u>

           Syntax error in =encoding directive

   <b>Warnings</b>
       These may not necessarily cause trouble, but indicate mediocre style.

       •   nested commands <u>CMD</u>&lt;...<u>CMD</u>&lt;...&gt;...&gt;

           Two nested identical markup commands have been found. Generally this does not make sense.

       •   multiple occurrences (<u>N</u>) of link target <u>name</u>

           The  POD  file has some "=item" and/or "=head" commands that have the same text. Potential hyperlinks
           to such a text cannot be unique then.  This warning is printed only with warning level  greater  than
           one.

       •   line containing nothing but whitespace in paragraph

           There  is some whitespace on a seemingly empty line. POD is very sensitive to such things, so this is
           flagged. <b>vi</b> users switch on the <b>list</b> option to avoid this problem.

       •   =item has no contents

           There is a list "=item" that has no text contents. You probably want to delete empty items.

       •   You can't have =items (as at line <u>N</u>) unless the first thing after the =over is an =item

           A list introduced by "=over" starts with a text or verbatim paragraph, but continues  with  "=item"s.
           Move the non-item paragraph out of the "=over"/"=back" block.

       •   Expected '=item <u>EXPECTED</u> <u>VALUE</u>'

       •   Expected '=item *'

       •   Possible =item type mismatch: '<u>x</u>' found leading a supposed definition =item

           A  list  started with e.g. a bullet-like "=item" and continued with a numbered one. This is obviously
           inconsistent. For most translators the type of the <u>first</u> "=item" determines the type of the list.

       •   You have '=item x' instead of the expected '=item <u>N</u>'

           Erroneous numbering of =item numbers; they need to ascend consecutively.

       •   Unknown E content in E&lt;<u>CONTENT</u>&gt;

           A character entity was found that does not belong to  the  standard  ISO  set  or  the  POD  specials
           "verbar"  and  "sol".  <u>Currently,</u> <u>this</u> <u>warning</u> <u>only</u> <u>appears</u> <u>if</u> <u>a</u> <u>character</u> <u>entity</u> <u>was</u> <u>found</u> <u>that</u> <u>does</u>
           <u>not</u> <u>have</u> <u>a</u> <u>Unicode</u> <u>character.</u> <u>This</u> <u>should</u> <u>be</u> <u>fixed</u> <u>to</u> <u>adhere</u> <u>to</u> <u>the</u> <u>original</u> <u>warning.</u>

       •   empty =over/=back block

           The list opened with "=over" does not contain anything.

       •   empty section in previous paragraph

           The previous section (introduced by a "=head" command) does  not  contain  any  valid  content.  This
           usually  indicates  that something is missing. Note: A "=head1" followed immediately by "=head2" does
           not trigger this warning.

       •   Verbatim paragraph in NAME section

           The NAME section ("=head1 NAME") should consist of a single paragraph with  the  script/module  name,
           followed by a dash `-' and a very short description of what the thing is good for.

       •   =head<u>n</u> without preceding higher level

           For example if there is a "=head2" in the POD file prior to a "=head1".

       •   A non-empty Z&lt;&gt;

           The "Z&lt;&gt;" sequence is supposed to be empty. Caveat: this issue is detected in Pod::Simple and will be
           flagged as an <u>ERROR</u> by any client code; any contents of "Z&lt;...&gt;" will be disregarded, anyway.

   <b>Hyperlinks</b>
       There are some warnings with respect to malformed hyperlinks:

       •   ignoring leading/trailing whitespace in link

           There is whitespace at the beginning or the end of the contents of L&lt;...&gt;.

       •   alternative text/node '%s' contains non-escaped | or /

           The characters "|" and "/" are special in the L&lt;...&gt; context.  Although the hyperlink parser does its
           best  to  determine  which "/" is text and which is a delimiter in case of doubt, one ought to escape
           these literal characters like this:

             /     E&lt;sol&gt;
             |     E&lt;verbar&gt;

       Note that the line number of the error/warning may refer to the line number of the start of the paragraph
       in which the error/warning exists, not the line number that the error/warning is on. This bug is  present
       in errors/warnings related to formatting codes. <u>This</u> <u>should</u> <u>be</u> <u>fixed.</u>

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       <b>podchecker</b> returns the number of POD syntax errors found or -1 if there were no POD commands at all found
       in the file.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       See "SYNOPSIS"

</pre><h4><b>SCRIPTS</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>podchecker</b>  script  that  comes with this distribution is a lean wrapper around this module. See the
       online manual with

         podchecker -help
         podchecker -man

</pre><h4><b>INTERFACE</b></h4><pre>
       While checking, this module collects document  properties,  e.g.  the  nodes  for  hyperlinks  ("=headX",
       "=item")  and  index  entries  ("X&lt;&gt;").  POD translators can use this feature to syntax-check and get the
       nodes in a first pass before actually starting to convert. This is expensive in terms of execution  time,
       but allows for very robust conversions.

       Since  v1.24  the  <b>Pod::Checker</b>  module  uses  only the <b>poderror</b> method to print errors and warnings. The
       summary output (e.g.  "Pod syntax OK") has been  dropped  from  the  module  and  has  been  included  in
       <b>podchecker</b>  (the  script).  This  allows users of <b>Pod::Checker</b> to control completely the output behavior.
       Users of <b>podchecker</b> (the script) get the well-known behavior.

       v1.45 inherits from Pod::Simple as opposed to all previous versions inheriting from Pod::Parser.  Do  <b>not</b>
       use  Pod::Simple's  interface  when  using Pod::Checker unless it is documented somewhere on this page. I
       repeat, DO <b>NOT</b> USE POD::SIMPLE'S INTERFACE.

       The following list documents the overrides to Pod::Simple, primarily to make Pod::Coverage happy:

       end_B
       end_C
       end_Document

       "Pod::Checker-&gt;new( %options )"
           Return a reference to a new Pod::Checker object that  inherits  from  Pod::Simple  and  is  used  for
           calling the required methods later. The following options are recognized:

           "-warnings =&gt; num"
             Print  warnings  if  "num"  is  true. The higher the value of "num", the more warnings are printed.
           Currently there are only levels 1 and 2.

           "-quiet =&gt; num"
             If "num" is true, do not print any errors/warnings. This is useful when  Pod::Checker  is  used  to
           munge POD code into plain text from within POD formatters.

       "$checker-&gt;poderror( @args )"
       "$checker-&gt;poderror( {%opts}, @args )"
           Internal  method  for  printing errors and warnings. If no options are given, simply prints "@_". The
           following options are recognized and used to form the output:

             -msg

           A message to print prior to @args.

             -line

           The line number the error occurred in.

             -file

           The file (name) the error occurred in. Defaults to the name of the current file being processed.

             -severity

           The error level, should be 'WARNING' or 'ERROR'.

       "$checker-&gt;num_errors()"
           Set (if argument specified) and retrieve the number of errors found.

       "$checker-&gt;num_warnings()"
           Set (if argument specified) and retrieve the number of warnings found.

       "$checker-&gt;name()"
           Set (if argument specified) and retrieve the canonical name of POD as  found  in  the  "=head1  NAME"
           section.

       "$checker-&gt;node()"
           Add  (if  argument  specified)  and  retrieve  the  nodes (as defined by "=headX" and "=item") of the
           current POD. The nodes are returned in the order of their occurrence. They  consist  of  plain  text,
           each piece of whitespace is collapsed to a single blank.

       "$checker-&gt;idx()"
           Add  (if argument specified) and retrieve the index entries (as defined by "X&lt;&gt;") of the current POD.
           They consist of plain text, each piece of whitespace is collapsed to a single blank.

       "$checker-&gt;hyperlinks()"
           Retrieve an array containing the hyperlinks to things outside the current POD (as defined by "L&lt;&gt;").

           Each is an instance of a class with the following methods:

       <b>line()</b>
           Returns the approximate line number in which the link was encountered

       <b>type()</b>
           Returns the type of the link; one of: "url" for things like "<a href="http://www.foo">http://www.foo</a>", "man" for man pages, or
           "pod".

       <b>page()</b>
           Returns the linked-to page or url.

       <b>node()</b>
           Returns the anchor or node within the linked-to page, or an empty string ("") if none appears in  the
           link.
