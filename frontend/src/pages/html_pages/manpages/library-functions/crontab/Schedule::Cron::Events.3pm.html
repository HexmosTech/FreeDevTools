       Schedule::Cron::Events - Schedule::Cron::Events - take a line from a crontab and find out when events
       will occur

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 1.96

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Schedule::Cron::Events;
         my @mon = qw(Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec);

         # a crontab line which triggers an event every 5 minutes
         # initialize the counter with the current time
         my $cron1 = new Schedule::Cron::Events( '*/5 * * * * /bin/foo', Seconds =&gt; time() );

         # or initialize it with a date, for example 09:51:13 on 21st June, 2002
         my $cron2 = new Schedule::Cron::Events( '*/5 * * * * /bin/foo', Date =&gt; [ 13, 51, 9, 21, 5, 102 ] );

         # you could say this too, to use the current time:
         my $cron = new Schedule::Cron::Events( '*/5 * * * * /bin/foo',  Date =&gt; [ ( localtime(time()) )[0..5] ] );

         # find the next execution time
         my ($sec, $min, $hour, $day, $month, $year) = $cron-&gt;nextEvent;
         printf("Event will start next at %2d:%02d:%02d on %d %s, %d\n", $hour, $min, $sec, $day, $mon[$month], ($year+1900));

         # find the following occurrence of the job
         ($sec, $min, $hour, $day, $month, $year) = $cron-&gt;nextEvent;
         printf("Following event will start at %2d:%02d:%02d on %d %s, %d\n", $hour, $min, $sec, $day, $mon[$month], ($year+1900));

         # reset the counter back to the original date given to new()
         $cron-&gt;resetCounter;

         # find out when the job would have last run
         ($sec, $min, $hour, $day, $month, $year) = $cron-&gt;previousEvent;
         printf("Last event started at %2d:%02d:%02d on %d %s, %d\n", $hour, $min, $sec, $day, $mon[$month], ($year+1900));

         # see when the job would have next run at a point in time
         $cron-&gt;setCounterToDate(0, 18, 1, 26, 9, 85); # that's 26th October, 1985
         ($sec, $min, $hour, $day, $month, $year) = $cron-&gt;nextEvent;
         printf("Event did start at %2d:%02d:%02d on %d %s, %d\n", $hour, $min, $sec, $day, $mon[$month], ($year+1900));

         # turn a local date into a Unix time
         use Time::Local;
         my $epochSecs = timelocal($sec, $min, $hour, $day, $month, $year);
         print "...or that can be expressed as " . $epochSecs . " seconds which is " . localtime($epochSecs) . "\n";

       Here is a sample of the output produced by that code:

         # Event will start next at  0:45:00 on 28 Aug, 2002
         # Following event will start at  0:50:00 on 28 Aug, 2002
         # Last event started at  0:40:00 on 28 Aug, 2002
         # Event did start at  1:20:00 on 26 Oct, 1985
         # ...or that can be expressed as 499134000 seconds which is Sat Oct 26 01:20:00 1985

       Note that results will vary according to your local time and timezone.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Given a line from a crontab, tells you the time at which cron will next run the line, or when the last
       event occurred, relative to any date you choose. The object keeps that reference date internally, and
       updates it when you call <b>nextEvent()</b> or <b>previousEvent()</b> - such that successive calls will give you a
       sequence of events going forward, or backwards, in time.

       Use <b>setCounterToNow()</b> to reset this reference time to the current date on your system, or use
       <b>setCounterToDate()</b> to set the reference to any arbitrary time, or <b>resetCounter()</b> to take the object back
       to the date you constructed it with.

       This module uses Set::Crontab to understand the date specification, so we should be able to handle all
       forms of cron entries.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Schedule::Cron::Events - take a line from a crontab and find out when events will occur

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       In the following, DATE_LIST is a list of 6 values suitable for passing to <b>Time::Local::timelocal()</b> which
       are the same as the first 6 values returned by the builtin <b>localtime()</b>, namely these 6 numbers in this
       order

       •   seconds

           a number 0 .. 59

       •   minutes

           a number 0 .. 59

       •   hours

           a number 0 .. 23

       •   dayOfMonth

           a number 0 .. 31

       •   month

           a number 0 .. 11 - January is *0*, December is *11*

       •   year

           the desired year number *minus 1900*

       new( CRONTAB_ENTRY, Seconds =&gt; REFERENCE_TIME, Date =&gt; [ DATE_LIST ] )
           Returns  a  new  object  for  the specified line from the crontab. The first 5 fields of the line are
           actually parsed by Set::Crontab, which should be able to handle the  original  <b><a href="../man5/crontab.5.html">crontab</a></b>(5)  ranges  as
           well  as  Vixie  cron  ranges  and  the like. It's up to you to supply a valid line - if you supply a
           comment line, an environment variable setting line, or a line which does not seem  to  begin  with  5
           fields (e.g. a blank line), this method returns undef.

           Give  either  the  Seconds  option  or  the  Date  option,  not both.  Supply a six-element array (as
           described above) to specify the date at which you want to start.  Alternatively, the  reference  time
           is the number of seconds since the epoch for the time you want to start looking from.

           If neither of the 'Seconds' and 'Date' options are given we use the current <b>time()</b>.

       <b>resetCounter()</b>
           Resets  the  object  to  the  state  when created (specifically resetting the internal counter to the
           initial date provided)

       <b>nextEvent()</b>
           Returns a DATE_LIST for the next event following the current reference time.  Updates  the  reference
           time to the time of the event.

       <b>previousEvent()</b>
           Returns  a  DATE_LIST for the last event preceding the current reference time.  Updates the reference
           time to the time of the event.

       <b>setCounterToNow()</b>
           Sets the reference time to the current time.

       setCounterToDate( DATE_LIST )
           Sets the reference time to the time given, specified in seconds since the epoch.

       <b>commandLine()</b>
           Returns the string that is the command to be executed as specified in the crontab - i.e. without  the
           leading date specification.

</pre><h4><b>ERROR</b> <b>HANDLING</b></h4><pre>
       If  something  goes wrong the general approach is to raise a fatal error with <b>confess()</b> so use eval {} to
       trap these errors. If you supply a comment line to the constructor then you'll simply get back undef, not
       a fatal error. If you supply a line like 'foo bar */15 baz qux <a href="file:/bin/false">/bin/false</a>' you'll get a <b>confess()</b>.

</pre><h4><b>DEPENDENCIES</b></h4><pre>
       Set::Crontab, Time::Local, Carp. Date::Manip is no longer required thanks to B Paulsen.
