</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       PPI::Token::HereDoc - Token class for the here-doc

</pre><h4><b>INHERITANCE</b></h4><pre>
         PPI::Token::HereDoc
         isa PPI::Token
             isa PPI::Element

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Here-docs are incredibly handy when writing Perl, but incredibly tricky when parsing it, primarily
       because they don't follow the general flow of input.

       They jump ahead and nab lines directly off the input buffer. Whitespace and newlines may not matter in
       most Perl code, but they matter in here-docs.

       They are also tricky to store as an object. They look sort of like an operator and a string, but they
       don't act like it. And they have a second section that should be something like a separate token, but
       isn't because a string can span from above the here-doc content to below it.

       So when parsing, this is what we do.

       Firstly, the PPI::Token::HereDoc object, does not represent the "&lt;&lt;" operator, or the "END_FLAG", or the
       content, or even the terminator.

       It represents all of them at once.

       The token itself has only the declaration part as its "content".

         # This is what the content of a HereDoc token is
         &lt;&lt;FOO

         # Or this
         &lt;&lt;"FOO"

         # Or even this
         &lt;&lt;      'FOO'

       That is, the "operator", any whitespace separator, and the quoted or bare terminator. So when you call
       the "content" method on a HereDoc token, you get '&lt;&lt; "FOO"'.

       As for the content and the terminator, when treated purely in "content" terms they do not exist.

       The content is made available with the "heredoc" method, and the name of the terminator with the
       "terminator" method.

       To make things work in the way you expect, PPI has to play some games when doing line/column location
       calculation for tokens, and also during the content parsing and generation processes.

       Documents cannot simply by recreated by stitching together the token contents, and involve a somewhat
       more expensive procedure, but the extra expense should be relatively negligible unless you are doing huge
       quantities of them.

       Please note that due to the immature nature of PPI in general, we expect "HereDocs" to be a rich (bad)
       source of corner-case bugs for quite a while, but for the most part they should more or less DWYM.

   <b>Comparison</b> <b>to</b> <b>other</b> <b>string</b> <b>types</b>
       Although technically it can be considered a quote, for the time being "HereDocs" are being treated as a
       completely separate "Token" subclass, and will not be found in a search for PPI::Token::Quote or
       PPI::Token::QuoteLike objects.

       This may change in the future, with it most likely to end up under QuoteLike.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       Although it has the standard set of "Token" methods, "HereDoc" objects have a relatively large number of
       unique methods all of their own.

   <b>heredoc</b>
       The "heredoc" method is the authoritative method for accessing the contents of the "HereDoc" object.

       It returns the contents of the here-doc as a list of newline-terminated strings. If called in scalar
       context, it returns the number of lines in the here-doc, <b>excluding</b> the terminator line.

   <b>indentation</b>
       The "indentation" method returns the indentation string of an indented here-doc if that can be
       determined. If the indented here-doc is damaged (say, missing terminator) or the here-doc was not
       indented, it returns "undef".

   <b>terminator</b>
       The "terminator" method returns the name of the terminating string for the here-doc.

       Returns the terminating string as an unescaped string (in the rare case the terminator has an escaped
       quote in it).

</pre><h4><b>TO</b> <b>DO</b></h4><pre>
       - Implement PPI::Token::Quote interface compatibility

       - Check CPAN for any use of the null here-doc or here-doc-in-s///e

       - Add support for the null here-doc

       - Add support for here-doc in s///e

</pre><h4><b>SUPPORT</b></h4><pre>
