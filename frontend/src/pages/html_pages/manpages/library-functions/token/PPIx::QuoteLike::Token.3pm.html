</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       PPIx::QuoteLike::Token - Represent any token.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       This is an abstract class, and should not be instantiated by the user.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This Perl module represents the base of the token hierarchy.

</pre><h4><b>INHERITANCE</b></h4><pre>
       "PPIx::QuoteLike::Token" is not descended from any other class.

       "PPIx::QuoteLike::Token" is the parent of PPIx::QuoteLike::Token::Control,
       PPIx::QuoteLike::Token::Interpolation, PPIx::QuoteLike::Token::String, PPIx::QuoteLike::Token::Structure,
       PPIx::QuoteLike::Token::Unknown and PPIx::QuoteLike::Token::Whitespace.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       This class supports the following public methods:

   <b>column_number</b>
       This method returns the column number of the first character in the element, or "undef" if that can not
       be determined.

   <b>content</b>
        say $token-&gt;content();

       This method returns the text that makes up the token.

   <b>error</b>
        say $token-&gt;error();

       This method returns the error text. This will be "undef" unless the token actually represents an error.

   <b>line_number</b>
       This method returns the line number of the first character in the element, or "undef" if that can not be
       determined.

   <b>location</b>
       This method returns a reference to an array describing the position of the element in the string, or
       "undef" if the location is unavailable.

       The array is compatible with the corresponding PPI::Element method.

   <b>logical_filename</b>
       This method returns the logical file name (taking "#line" directives into account) of the file containing
       first character in the element, or "undef" if that can not be determined.

   <b>logical_line_number</b>
       This method returns the logical line number (taking "#line" directives into account) of the first
       character in the element, or "undef" if that can not be determined.

   <b>parent</b>
        my $parent = $token-&gt;parent();

       This method returns the token's parent, which will be the PPIx::QuoteLike object that contains it.

   <b>next_sibling</b>
        my $next = $token-&gt;next_sibling();

       This method returns the token after the invocant, or nothing if there is none.

   <b>perl_version_introduced</b>
       This method returns the version of Perl in which the element was introduced. This will be at least 5.000.
       Before 5.006 I am relying on the <u>perldelta</u>, <u>perlre</u>, and <u>perlop</u> documentation, since I have been unable to
       build earlier Perls. Since I have found no documentation before 5.003, I assume that anything found in
       5.003 is also in 5.000.

       Since this all depends on my ability to read and understand masses of documentation, the results of this
       method should be viewed with caution, if not downright skepticism.

       There are also cases which are ambiguous in various ways. For those see "RESTRICTIONS" in PPIx::Regexp,
       and especially "Changes in Syntax" in PPIx::Regexp.

   <b>perl_version_removed</b>
       This method returns the version of Perl in which the element was removed. If the element is still valid
       the return is "undef".

       All the <u>caveats</u> to <b>perl_version_introduced()</b> apply here also, though perhaps less severely since although
       many features have been introduced since 5.0, few have been removed.

   <b>previous_sibling</b>
        my $prev = $token-&gt;previous_sibling();

       This method returns the token before the invocant, or nothing if there is none.

   <b>significant</b>
        $token-&gt;significant()
            and say 'significant';

       This Boolean method returns a true value if the token is significant, and a false one otherwise.

   <b>snext_sibling</b>
        my $next = $token-&gt;snext_sibling();

       This method returns the significant token after the invocant, or nothing if there is none.

   <b>sprevious_sibling</b>
        my $prev = $token-&gt;sprevious_sibling();

       This method returns the significant token before the invocant, or nothing if there is none.

   <b>statement</b>
       This method returns the PPI::Statement that contains this token, or nothing if the statement can not be
       determined.

       In general this method will return something only under the following conditions:

       •   The token is contained in a PPIx::QuoteLike object;

       •   That object was initialized from a PPI::Element;

       •   The PPI::Element is contained in a statement.

   <b>top</b>
       This method returns the top of the hierarchy.

   <b>variables</b>
        say "Interpolates $_" for $elem-&gt;variables();

       <b>NOTE</b>  that  this  method is discouraged, and may well be deprecated and removed. I have two problems with
       it. The first is that it returns variable names rather than PPI::Element objects, leaving you no idea how
       the variables are used. The second is that it does not properly handle things like "${^CAPTURE[0]}",  and
       it   seems   infeasible   to   make   it   do   so.   It  was  originally  written  for  the  benefit  of
       Perl::Critic::Policy::Variables::ProhibitUnusedVarsStricter, but has proven inadequate to  that  policy's
       needs.

       This  convenience  method  returns  all  interpolated variables. Each is returned only once, and they are
       returned in no particular order.

       <b>NOTE</b> that because this class does not represent an interpolation, this method returns nothing.

   <b>visual_column_number</b>
       This method returns the visual column number (taking tabs into account) of the  first  character  in  the
       element, or "undef" if that can not be determined.
