</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Bio::Search::Iteration::IterationI - Abstract interface to an iteration from an iterated search result,
       such as PSI-BLAST.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           # Bio::Search::Iteration::IterationI objects cannot be
           # instantiated since this module defines a pure interface.
           # Given an object that implements the
           # Bio::Search::Iteration::IterationI interface,
           # you can do the following things with it:

           # First, open up a SearchIO stream
           use Bio::SearchIO;
           my $file = shift or die "Usage: $0 &lt;BLAST-report-file&gt;\n";
           my $in = Bio::SearchIO-&gt;new(-format =&gt; 'blast',
                                      -file =&gt; $file # comment out this line to read STDIN
                                     );
           # Iterate over all results in the input stream
           while (my $result = $in-&gt;next_result) {

               printf "Result #%d: %s\n", $in-&gt;result_count, $result-&gt;to_string;
               printf "Total Iterations: %d\n", $result-&gt;num_iterations();

               # Iterate over all iterations and process old and new hits
               # separately.

               while( my $it = $result-&gt;next_iteration) {
                   printf "\nIteration %d\n", $it-&gt;number;
                   printf "Converged: %d\n", $it-&gt;converged;

                   # Print out the hits not found in previous iteration
                   printf "New hits: %d\n", $it-&gt;num_hits_new;
                   while( my $hit = $it-&gt;next_hit_new ) {
                       printf "  %s, Expect=%g\n", $hit-&gt;name, $hit-&gt;expect;
                   }

                   # Print out the hits found in previous iteration
                   printf "Old hits: %d\n", $it-&gt;num_hits_old;
                   while( my $hit = $it-&gt;next_hit_old ) {
                       printf "  %s, Expect=%g\n", $hit-&gt;name, $hit-&gt;expect;
                   }
               }
               printf "%s\n\n", '-' x 50;
           }

           printf "Total Reports processed: %d: %s\n", $in-&gt;result_count;

           __END__

           # NOTE: The following functionality is just proposed
           # (does not yet exist but might, given sufficient hew and cry):

           # Zero-in on the new hits found in last iteration.
           # By default, iteration() returns the last one.

           my $last_iteration = $result-&gt;iteration();
           while( my $hit = $last_iteration-&gt;next_hit) {
               # Do something with new hit...
           }

           # Get the first iteration

           my $first_iteration = $result-&gt;<a href="../man1/iteration.1.html">iteration</a>(1);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Bio::Search::Result::ResultI objects are data structures containing the results from the execution of a
       search algorithm.  As such, it may contain various algorithm specific information as well as details of
       the execution, but will contain a few fundamental elements, including the ability to return
       Bio::Search::Hit::HitI objects.

   <b>Classification</b> <b>of</b> <b>Hits</b>
       Within a given iteration, the hits can be classified into a number of useful subsets based on whether or
       not the hit appeard in a previous iteration and whether or not the hit is below the threshold E-value for
       inclusion in the score matrix model.

                                  All hits
                                    (A)
                      _______________|_________________

                                     (H)                  (I)

       Notes: The term <u>threshold</u> in the diagram and descriptions below refer to this inclusion threshold. <u>Below</u>
       <u>threshold</u> actually means <u>at</u> <u>or</u> <u>below</u> <u>threshold</u>.

       The IterationI interface defines a number of methods for extracting these subsets of hits.

       •   <b>newhits_below_threshold()</b> [subset D]

           Hits that did not appear in a previous iteration and are below threshold in the current iteration.

       •   <b>newhits_not_below_threshold()</b> [subset E]

           Hits  that  did  not  appear  in  a  previous  iteration  and  are not below threshold in the current
           iteration.

       •   <b>newhits()</b> [subset B]

           All  newly  found  hits,  below  and  above  the  inclusion  threshold.   This  is   the   union   of
           <b>newhits_below_threshold()</b> + <b>newhits_not_below_threshold()</b> [subset D + subset E].

       •   <b>oldhits_below_threshold()</b> [subset H]

           Hits  that  appeared  in  a  previous  iteration below threshold and are still below threshold in the
           current iteration.

       •   <b>oldhits_newly_below_threshold()</b> [subset I]

           Hits that appeared in a previous iteration above threshold but are below  threshold  in  the  current
           iteration. (Not applicable to the first iteration.)

       •   <b>oldhits_not_below_threshold()</b> [subset G]

           Hits  that  appeared in a previous iteration not below threshold and are still not below threshold in
           the current iteration.

       •   <b>oldhits()</b>  [subset C]

           All hits that occurred in a previous iteration, whether below  or  above  threshold  in  the  current
           iteration.     Union     of    <b>oldhits_below_threshold()</b>    +    <b>oldhits_newly_below_threshold()</b>    +
           <b>oldhits_not_below_threshold()</b> [subset H + subset  I  +  subset  G].  (Not  applicable  to  the  first
           iteration.)

       •   <b>hits_below_threshold()</b> [subset D + subset F]

           All hits, old and new, that are below the inclusion threshold in this iteration. This is the union of
           <b>newhits_below_threshold()</b>  +  <b>oldhits_below_threshold()</b> + <b>oldhits_newly_below_threshold()</b> [subset D +
           subset H + subset I].

       •   <b>hits()</b> [subset A]

           The union of <b>newhits()</b> and <b>oldhits()</b> [subset B + subset C].

       For the first iteration, the methods oldhits, oldhits_below_threshold, oldhits_newly_below_threshold, and
       <b>oldhits_not_below_threshold()</b> will return empty lists.

       Iterator and numbers-of-hit methods are provided for subsets A, B, and C:

       •   <b>next_hit_new()</b>, <b>num_hits_new()</b> [subset B]

       •   <b>next_hit_old()</b>, <b>num_hits_old()</b> [subset C]

       •   <b>next_hit()</b>, <b>num_hits()</b> [subset A]

                  iteration above threshold but are below threshold in the
                  current iteration. Not applicable to the first iteration.
                  Corresponds to subset I in the "Classification of Hits"
                  documentation section of this module.
        Returns : An array containing Bio::Search::Hit::HitI objects.
                  Hits will be returned in the order in which they occur in the report
                  unless otherwise specified.
