</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       SDL_AppIterate - App-implemented iteration entry point for <b>SDL_MAIN_USE_CALLBACKS</b> apps.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;SDL3/SDL_main.h&gt;</b>

       <b>SDL_AppResult</b> <b>SDL_AppIterate(void</b> <b>*appstate);</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Apps implement this function when using <b>SDL_MAIN_USE_CALLBACKS</b>.  If using a standard "main" function, you
       should not supply this.

       This  function  is called repeatedly by SDL after <b>SDL_AppInit</b> returns 0. The function should operate as a
       single iteration the program's primary loop; it should update whatever state it  needs  and  draw  a  new
       frame of video, usually.

       On  some  platforms,  this function will be called at the refresh rate of the display (which might change
       during the life of your app!). There are no promises made about what frequency this  function  might  run
       at.  You  should  use  SDL's  timer  functions if you need to see how much time has passed since the last
       iteration.

       There is no need to process the SDL event queue during this function; SDL will send events as they arrive
       in <b>SDL_AppEvent</b>, and in most cases the event queue will be empty when this function runs anyhow.

       This function should not go into an infinite mainloop; it should do one iteration of whatever the program
       does and return.

       The <b>appstate</b> parameter is an optional pointer provided by the app during <b>SDL_AppInit</b>().  If the app never
       provided a pointer, this will be NULL.

       If this function returns <b>SDL_APP_CONTINUE</b>, the app will continue  normal  operation,  receiving  repeated
       calls  to  <b>SDL_AppIterate</b>  and  <b>SDL_AppEvent</b>  for  the  life  of  the  program.  If this function returns
       <b>SDL_APP_FAILURE</b>, SDL will call <b>SDL_AppQuit</b> and terminate the process with an exit code  that  reports  an
       error  to  the platform. If it returns <b>SDL_APP_SUCCESS</b>, SDL calls <b>SDL_AppQuit</b> and terminates with an exit
       code that reports success to the platform.

       This function is called by SDL on the main thread.

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTION</b> <b>PARAMETERS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>appstate</u>
              an optional pointer, provided by the app in <b>SDL_AppInit</b>.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       Returns  <b>SDL_APP_FAILURE</b>  to  terminate  with  an  error,  <b>SDL_APP_SUCCESS</b>  to  terminate  with  success,
       <b>SDL_APP_CONTINUE</b> to continue.

</pre><h4><b>THREAD</b> <b>SAFETY</b></h4><pre>
       This function may get called concurrently with <b>SDL_AppEvent</b>() for events not pushed on the main thread.

</pre><h4><b>AVAILABILITY</b></h4><pre>
       This function is available since SDL 3.2.0.
