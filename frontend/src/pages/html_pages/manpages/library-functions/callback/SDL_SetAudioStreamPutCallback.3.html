</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       SDL_SetAudioStreamPutCallback - Set a callback that runs when data is added to an audio stream.

</pre><h4><b>HEADER</b> <b>FILE</b></h4><pre>
       Defined in SDL3/SDL_audio.h

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>#include</b> <b>"SDL3/SDL.h"</b>

       <b>bool</b> <b>SDL_SetAudioStreamPutCallback(SDL_AudioStream</b> <b>*stream,</b> <b>SDL_AudioStreamCallback</b> <b>callback,</b> <b>void</b> <b>*userdata);</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This callback is called _after_ the data is added to the stream, giving the callback the chance to obtain
       it immediately.

       The callback can (optionally) call

       <b>SDL_GetAudioStreamData</b> () to obtain audio from the stream during this call.

       The  callback's  <b>additional_amount</b> argument is how many bytes of _converted_ data (in the stream's output
       format) was provided by the caller, although this may underestimate a little for safety. This value might
       be less than what is currently available in the stream, if data was already there, and might be less than
       the caller provided if the stream needs to keep a buffer to aid in resampling. Which means  the  callback
       may be provided with zero bytes, and a different amount on each call.

       The callback may call

       <b>SDL_GetAudioStreamAvailable</b>
        to  see  the  total amount currently available to read from the stream, instead of the total provided by
       the current call.

       The callback is not required to obtain all data. It is allowed to read less or none at all. Anything  not
       read now simply remains in the stream for later access.

       Clearing or flushing an audio stream does not call this callback.

       This  function obtains the stream's lock, which means any existing callback (get or put) in progress will
       finish running before setting the new callback.

       Setting a NULL function turns off the callback.

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTION</b> <b>PARAMETERS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>stream</u> the audio stream to set the new callback on.

       <u>callback</u>
              the new callback function to call when data is added to the stream.

       <u>userdata</u>
              an opaque pointer provided to the callback for its own personal use.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       Returns true on success or false on failure; call

       <b>SDL_GetError</b> () for more information. This only fails if <b>stream</b> is NULL.

</pre><h4><b>THREAD</b> <b>SAFETY</b></h4><pre>
       It is safe to call this function from any thread.

</pre><h4><b>AVAILABILITY</b></h4><pre>
       This function is available since SDL 3.2.0.
