</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Tk::IO - high level interface to Tk's 'fileevent' mechanism

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         my $fh = Tk::IO-&gt;new(-linecommand =&gt; callback, -childcommand =&gt; callback);
         $fh-&gt;exec("command")
         $fh-&gt;wait
         $fh-&gt;kill

</pre><h4><b>WARNING</b></h4><pre>
       INTERFACES TO THIS MODULE MAY CHANGE AS PERL'S IO EVOLVES AND WITH PORT OF TK4.1

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Tk::IO is now layered on perl's IO::Handle class. Interfaces have changed, and are still evolving.

       In theory C methods which enable non-blocking IO as in earlier Tk-b* release(s) are still there. I have
       not changed them to use perl's additional Configure information, or tested them much.

       Assumption is that <b>exec</b> is used to fork a child process and a callback is called each time a complete
       line arrives up the implied pipe.

       "line" should probably be defined in terms of perl's input record separator but is not yet.

       The -childcommand callback is called when end-of-file occurs.

       $fh-&gt;<b>wait</b> can be used to wait for child process while processing other Tk events.

       $fh-&gt;<b>kill</b> can be used to send signal to child process.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Still not finished.  Idea is to use "exec" to emulate "system" in a non-blocking manner.
