</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       A client application wishing to use TLSv1.3 PSKs should use either <b>SSL_CTX_set_psk_use_session_callback()</b>
       or <b>SSL_set_psk_use_session_callback()</b> as appropriate. These functions cannot be used for TLSv1.2 and
       below PSKs.

       The callback function is given a pointer to the SSL connection in <b>ssl</b>.

       The first time the callback is called for a connection the <b>md</b> parameter is NULL. In some circumstances
       the callback will be called a second time. In that case the server will have specified a ciphersuite to
       use already and the PSK must be compatible with the digest for that ciphersuite. The digest will be given
       in <b>md</b>. The PSK returned by the callback is allowed to be different between the first and second time it
       is called.

       On successful completion the callback must store a pointer to an identifier for the PSK in <b>*id</b>. The
       identifier length in bytes should be stored in <b>*idlen</b>.  The memory pointed to by <b>*id</b> remains owned by the
       application and should be freed by it as required at any point after the handshake is complete.

       Additionally the callback should store a pointer to an SSL_SESSION object in <b>*sess</b>. This is used as the
       basis for the PSK, and should, at a minimum, have the following fields set:

       The master key
           This can be set via a call to <b><a href="../man3/SSL_SESSION_set1_master_key.3.html">SSL_SESSION_set1_master_key</a></b>(3).

       A ciphersuite
           Only  the handshake digest associated with the ciphersuite is relevant for the PSK (the server may go
           on to negotiate any ciphersuite which is compatible with the digest). The  application  can  use  any
           TLSv1.3  ciphersuite.  If <b>md</b> is not NULL the handshake digest for the ciphersuite should be the same.
           The ciphersuite can be set via a call to &lt;<b><a href="../man3/SSL_SESSION_set_cipher.3.html">SSL_SESSION_set_cipher</a></b>(3)&gt;.  The  handshake  digest  of  an
           SSL_CIPHER object can be checked using &lt;<b><a href="../man3/SSL_CIPHER_get_handshake_digest.3.html">SSL_CIPHER_get_handshake_digest</a></b>(3)&gt;.

       The protocol version
           This can be set via a call to <b><a href="../man3/SSL_SESSION_set_protocol_version.3.html">SSL_SESSION_set_protocol_version</a></b>(3) and should be TLS1_3_VERSION.

       Additionally  the  maximum early data value should be set via a call to <b><a href="../man3/SSL_SESSION_set_max_early_data.3.html">SSL_SESSION_set_max_early_data</a></b>(3)
       if the PSK will be used for sending early data.

       Alternatively an SSL_SESSION created from a previous non-PSK handshake may also be used as the basis  for
       a PSK.

       Ownership of the SSL_SESSION object is passed to the OpenSSL library and so it should not be freed by the
       application.

       It is also possible for the callback to succeed but not supply a PSK. In this case no PSK will be sent to
       the server but the handshake will continue. To do this the callback should return successfully and ensure
       that <b>*sess</b> is NULL. The contents of <b>*id</b> and <b>*idlen</b> will be ignored.

       A  client  application  wishing  to  use  PSK ciphersuites for TLSv1.2 and below must provide a different
       callback function. This function will be called when the client is sending the ClientKeyExchange  message
       to the server.

       The  purpose  of the callback function is to select the PSK identity and the pre-shared key to use during
       the connection setup phase.

       The callback is set using functions <b>SSL_CTX_set_psk_client_callback()</b>  or  <b>SSL_set_psk_client_callback()</b>.
       The  callback  function is given the connection in parameter <b>ssl</b>, a <b>NUL</b>-terminated PSK identity hint sent
       by the server in parameter <b>hint</b>, a buffer  <b>identity</b>  of  length  <b>max_identity_len</b>  bytes  (including  the
       <b>NUL</b>-terminator)  where  the resulting <b>NUL</b>-terminated identity is to be stored, and a buffer <b>psk</b> of length
       <b>max_psk_len</b> bytes where the resulting pre-shared key is to be stored.

       The callback for  use  in  TLSv1.2  will  also  work  in  TLSv1.3  although  it  is  recommended  to  use
       <b>SSL_CTX_set_psk_use_session_callback()</b> or <b>SSL_set_psk_use_session_callback()</b> for this purpose instead. If
       TLSv1.3  has  been  negotiated  then  OpenSSL  will  first  check  to  see if a callback has been set via
       <b>SSL_CTX_set_psk_use_session_callback()</b> or <b>SSL_set_psk_use_session_callback()</b> and  it  will  use  that  in
       preference.  If  no  such  callback  is  present then it will check to see if a callback has been set via
       <b>SSL_CTX_set_psk_client_callback()</b> or <b>SSL_set_psk_client_callback()</b> and use that. In this  case  the  <b>hint</b>
       value  will always be NULL and the handshake digest will default to SHA-256 for any returned PSK. TLSv1.3
       early data exchanges are possible in PSK connections only with the <b>SSL_psk_use_session_cb_func</b>  callback,
       and are not possible with the <b>SSL_psk_client_cb_func</b> callback.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       Note that parameter <b>hint</b> given to the callback may be <b>NULL</b>.

       A  connection  established  via  a  TLSv1.3 PSK will appear as if session resumption has occurred so that
       <b><a href="../man3/SSL_session_reused.3.html">SSL_session_reused</a></b>(3) will return true.

       There are no known security issues with sharing the same PSK between  TLSv1.2  (or  below)  and  TLSv1.3.
       However, the RFC has this note of caution:

       "While  there  is  no known way in which the same PSK might produce related output in both versions, only
       limited analysis has been done.  Implementations can ensure safety from cross-protocol related output  by
       not reusing PSKs between TLS 1.3 and TLS 1.2."

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUES</b></h4><pre>
       Return values from the <b>SSL_psk_client_cb_func</b> callback are interpreted as follows:

       On  success  (callback found a PSK identity and a pre-shared key to use) the length (&gt; 0) of <b>psk</b> in bytes
       is returned.

       Otherwise or on errors the callback should return 0. In this case the connection setup fails.

       The SSL_psk_use_session_cb_func callback should return 1 on success or 0 on  failure.  In  the  event  of
       failure the connection setup fails.
