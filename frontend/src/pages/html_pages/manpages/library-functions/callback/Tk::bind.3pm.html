</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Tk::bind - Arrange for X events to invoke callbacks

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       Retrieve bindings:

           <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>bind</b>

           <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>bind</b>(<u>tag</u>)

           <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>bind</b>(<u>sequence</u>)

           <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>bind</b>(<u>tag</u>,<u>sequence</u>)

       Associate and destroy bindings:

           <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>bind</b>(<u>sequence</u>,<u>callback</u>)

           <u>$widget</u>-&gt;<b>bind</b>(<u>tag</u>,<u>sequence</u>,<u>callback</u>)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>bind</b> method associates callbacks with X events.  If <u>callback</u> is specified, <b>bind</b> will arrange for
       <u>callback</u> to be evaluated whenever the event(s) given by <u>sequence</u> occur in the window(s) identified by
       <u>$widget</u> or <u>tag</u>.  If <u>callback</u> is an empty string then the current binding for <u>sequence</u> is destroyed,
       leaving <u>sequence</u> unbound.  In all of the cases where a <u>callback</u> argument is provided, <b>bind</b> returns an
       empty string.

       If <u>sequence</u> is specified without a <u>callback</u>, then the callback currently bound to <u>sequence</u> is returned,
       or <b>undef</b> is returned if there is no binding for <u>sequence</u>.  If neither <u>sequence</u> nor <u>callback</u> is specified,
       then the return value is a list whose elements are all the sequences for which there exist bindings for
       <u>tag</u>.

       If no <u>tag</u> is specified then the <b>bind</b> refers to <u>$widget</u>.  If <u>tag</u> is specified then it is typically a class
       name and the <b>bind</b> refers to all instances of the class on the <b>MainWindow</b> associated with <u>$widget</u>. (It is
       possible for <u>tag</u> to be another "widget object" but this practice is deprecated.) Perl's <b>ref</b>(<u>$object</u>) can
       be used to get the class name of any object.  Each window has an associated list of tags, and a binding
       applies to a particular window if its tag is among those specified for the window.  Although the <b>bindtags</b>
       method may be used to assign an arbitrary set of binding tags to a window, the default binding tags
       provide the following behavior:

       If a tag is the name of an internal window the binding applies to that window.

       If the tag is the name of a toplevel window the binding applies to the toplevel window and all its
       internal windows.

       If the tag is the name of a class of widgets, such as <b>Tk::Button</b>, the binding applies to all widgets in
       that class;

       If <u>tag</u> has the value <b>all</b>, the binding applies to all windows descended from the MainWindow of the
       application.

</pre><h4><b>EVENT</b> <b>PATTERNS</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>sequence</u> argument specifies a sequence of one or more event patterns, with optional white space
       between the patterns.  Each event pat may take one of three forms.  In the simplest case it is a single
       printing ASCII character, such as <b>a</b> or <b>[</b>.  The character may not be a space character or the character &lt;.
       This form of pattern matches a <b>KeyPress</b> event for the particular character.  The second form of pattern
       is longer but more general.  It has the following syntax:

           '&lt;modifier-modifier-type-detail&gt;'

       The entire event pattern is surrounded by angle brackets, and normally needs to be quoted, as angle
       brackets are special to perl.  Inside the angle brackets are zero or more modifiers, an event type, and
       an extra piece of information (<u>detail</u>) identifying a particular button or keysym.  Any of the fields may
       be omitted, as long as at least one of <u>type</u> and <u>detail</u> is present.  The fields must be separated by white
       space or dashes.

       The third form of pattern is used to specify a user-defined, named virtual event; see Tk::event for
       details.  It has the following syntax:

           '&lt;&lt;name&gt;&gt;'

       The entire virtual event pattern is surrounded by double angle brackets.  Inside the angle brackets is
       the user-defined name of the virtual event.  Modifiers, such as <b>Shift</b> or <b>Control</b>, may not be combined
       with a virtual event to modify it.  Bindings on a virtual event may be created before the virtual event
       is defined, and if the definition of a virtual event changes dynamically, all windows bound to that
       virtual event will respond immediately to the new definition.

</pre><h4><b>MODIFIERS</b></h4><pre>
       Modifiers consist of any of the following values:

        Control        Mod2, M2
        Shift          Mod3, M3
        Lock           Mod4, M4
        Button1, B1    Mod5, M5
        Button2, B2    Meta, M
        Button3, B3    Alt
        Button4, B4    Double
        Button5, B5    Triple
        Mod1,    M1    Quadruple

       Where more than one value is listed, separated by commas, the values are equivalent.  Most of the
       modifiers have the obvious X meanings.  For example, <b>Button1</b> requires that button 1 be depressed when the
       event occurs.  For a binding to match a given event, the modifiers in the event must include all of those
       specified in the event pattern.  An event may also contain additional modifiers not specified in the
       binding.  For example, if button 1 is pressed while the shift and control keys are down, the pattern
       <b>&lt;Control-Button-1&gt;</b> will match the event, but <b>&lt;Mod1-Button-1&gt;</b> will not.  If no modifiers are specified,
       then any combination of modifiers may be present in the event.

       <b>Meta</b> and <b>M</b> refer to whichever of the <b>M1</b> through <b>M5</b> modifiers is associated with the meta key(s) on the
       keyboard (keysyms <b>Meta_R</b> and <b>Meta_L</b>).  If there are no meta keys, or if they are not associated with any
       modifiers, then <b>Meta</b> and <b>M</b> will not match any events.  Similarly, the <b>Alt</b> modifier refers to whichever
       modifier is associated with the alt key(s) on the keyboard (keysyms <b>Alt_L</b> and <b>Alt_R</b>).

       The <b>Double</b>, <b>Triple</b> and <b>Quadruple</b> modifiers are a convenience for specifying double mouse clicks and other
       repeated events. They cause a particular event pattern to be repeated 2, 3 or 4 times, and also place a
       time and space requirement on the sequence: for a sequence of events to match a <b>Double</b>, <b>Triple</b> or
       <b>Quadruple</b> pattern, all of the events must occur close together in time and without substantial mouse
       motion in between.  For example, <b>&lt;Double-Button-1&gt;</b> is equivalent to <b>&lt;Button-1&gt;&lt;Button-1&gt;</b> with the extra
       time and space requirement.

</pre><h4><b>EVENT</b> <b>TYPES</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>type</u> field may be any of the standard X event types, with a few extra abbreviations.  Below is a list
       of all the valid types; where two names appear together, they are synonyms.

           Activate            Destroy            Map
           ButtonPress, Button Enter              MapRequest
           ButtonRelease       Expose             Motion
           Circulate           FocusIn            MouseWheel
           CirculateRequest    FocusOut           Property
           Colormap            Gravity            Reparent
           Configure           KeyPress, Key      ResizeRequest
           ConfigureRequest    KeyRelease         Unmap
           Create              Leave              Visibility
           Deactivate

       Most of the above events have the same fields and behaviors  as  events in  the X Windowing system.  You
       can find more detailed descriptions of these events in any X window programming book.  A couple of the
       events are  extensions to the X event system to support features unique to the Macintosh and Windows
       platforms.  We provide a little  more  detail  on these events here.  These include:

           Activate
           Deactivate

       These two events are sent to every sub-window of a toplevel when they change state.  In addition to the
       focus Window, the Macintosh platform and Windows platforms have a notion of an active window (which often
       has but is not required to have the focus).  On the Macintosh, widgets in the active window have a
       different appearance than widgets in deactive windows.  The Activate event is sent to all the sub-windows
       in a toplevel when it changes from being deactive to active.  Likewise, the Deactive event is sent when
       the window's state changes from active to deactive.  There are no use- ful percent substitutions you
       would make when binding to these events.

           MouseWheel

       Some mice on the Windows platform support a mouse wheel  which  is used  for  scrolling  documents
       without using the scrollbars.  By rolling the wheel, the system will generate MouseWheel events that the
       application  can use to scroll.  Like Key events the event is always routed to the window that currently
       has  focus.  When  the event is received you can use the %D substitution to get the delta field for the
       event which is a integer value of  motion  that  the mouse  wheel  has  moved.  The smallest value for
       which the system will report is defined by the OS.  On Windows  95  &amp;  98  machines this value is at
       least 120 before it is reported.  However, higher resolution devices may be available in the future.
       The  sign  of the  value  determines  which direction your widget should scroll.  Positive values should
       scroll up and negative values should scroll down.

       The last part of a long event specification is <u>detail</u>.  In the case of a <b>ButtonPress</b> or <b>ButtonRelease</b>
       event, it is the number of a button (1-5).  If a button number is given, then only an event on that
       particular button will match;  if no button number is given, then an event on any button will match.
       Note:  giving a specific button number is different than specifying a button modifier; in the first case,
       it refers to a button being pressed or released, while in the second it refers to some other button that
       is already depressed when the matching event occurs.  If a button number is given then <u>type</u> may be
       omitted:  if will default to <b>ButtonPress</b>.  For example, the specifier <b>&lt;1&gt;</b> is equivalent to
       <b>&lt;ButtonPress-1&gt;</b>.

       If the event type is <b>KeyPress</b> or <b>KeyRelease</b>, then <u>detail</u> may be specified in the form of an X keysym.
       Keysyms are textual specifications for particular keys on the keyboard; they include all the alphanumeric
       ASCII characters (e.g. ``a'' is the keysym for the ASCII character ``a''), plus descriptions for non-
       alphanumeric characters (``comma'' is the keysym for the comma character), plus descriptions for all the
       non-ASCII keys on the keyboard (``Shift_L'' is the keysm for the left shift key, and ``F1'' is the keysym
       for the F1 function key, if it exists).  The complete list of keysyms is not presented here;  it is
       available in other X documentation and may vary from system to system.  If necessary, you can use the <b>'K'</b>
       notation described below to print out the keysym name for a particular key.  If a keysym <u>detail</u> is given,
       then the <u>type</u> field may be omitted;  it will default to <b>KeyPress</b>.  For example, <b>&lt;Control-comma&gt;</b> is
       equivalent to <b>&lt;Control-KeyPress-comma&gt;</b>.

</pre><h4><b>BINDING</b> <b>CALLBACKS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>SUBSTITUTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>callback</u> argument to <b>bind</b> is a perl/Tk callback.  which will be executed whenever the given event
       sequence occurs.  (See Tk::callbacks for description of the possible forms.)  <u>Callback</u> will be associated
       with the same <b>MainWindow</b> that is associated with the <u>$widget</u> that was used to invoke the <b>bind</b> method, and
       it will run as though called from <b>MainLoop</b>.  If <u>callback</u> contains any <b>Ev</b>(<u>%</u>) calls, then each "nested"
       <b>Ev</b>(<u>%</u>) "callback" will be evaluated when the event occurs to form arguments to be passed to the main
       <u>callback</u>.  The replacement depends on the character <u>%</u>, as defined in the list below.  Unless otherwise
       indicated, the replacement string is the numeric (decimal) value of the given field from the current
       event. Perl/Tk has enhanced this mechanism slightly compared to the comparable Tcl/Tk mechanism. The
       enhancements are not yet all reflected in the list below.  Some of the substitutions are only valid for
       certain types of events;  if they are used for other types of events the value substituted is undefined
       (not the same as <b>undef</b>!).

       <b>'#'</b> The  number  of  the  last  client request processed by the server (the <u>serial</u> field from the event).
           Valid for all event types.

       <b>'a'</b> The <u>above</u> field from the event, formatted as a hexadecimal number.  Valid only for <b>Configure</b> events.

       <b>'b'</b> The number of the button that was pressed or released.  Valid only for <b>ButtonPress</b> and  <b>ButtonRelease</b>
           events.

       <b>'c'</b> The <u>count</u> field from the event.  Valid only for <b>Expose</b> events.

       <b>'d'</b> The <u>detail</u> field from the event.  The <b>'d'</b> is replaced by a string identifying the detail.  For <b>Enter</b>,
           <b>Leave</b>, <b>FocusIn</b>, and <b>FocusOut</b> events, the string will be one of the following:

            NotifyAncestor          NotifyNonlinearVirtual
            NotifyDetailNone        NotifyPointer
            NotifyInferior          NotifyPointerRoot
            NotifyNonlinear         NotifyVirtual

           For <b>ConfigureRequest</b> events, the string will be one of:

            Above                   Opposite
            Below                   None
            BottomIf                TopIf

           For events other than these, the substituted string is undefined.  (Note that this is <u>not</u> the same as
           Detail part of sequence use to specify the event.)

       <b>'f'</b> The <u>focus</u> field from the event (<b>0</b> or <b>1</b>).  Valid only for <b>Enter</b> and <b>Leave</b> events.

       <b>'h'</b> The  <u>height</u>  field  from  the event.  Valid only for <b>Configure</b>, <b>ConfigureRequest</b>, <b>Create</b>, <b>Expose</b>, and
           <b>ResizeRequest</b> events.

       <b>'i'</b> The window field from the  event,  represented  as  a  hexadecimal integer.

       <b>'k'</b> The <u>keycode</u> field from the event.  Valid only for <b>KeyPress</b> and <b>KeyRelease</b> events.

       <b>'m'</b> The <u>mode</u> field  from  the  event.   The  substituted  string  is  one  of  <b>NotifyNormal</b>,  <b>NotifyGrab</b>,
           <b>NotifyUngrab</b>, or <b>NotifyWhileGrabbed</b>.  Valid only for <b>Enter</b>, <b>FocusIn</b>, <b>FocusOut</b>, and <b>Leave</b> events.

       <b>'o'</b> The <u>override_redirect</u> field from the event.  Valid only for <b>Map</b>, <b>Reparent</b>, and <b>Configure</b> events.

       <b>'p'</b> The <u>place</u> field from the event, substituted as one of the strings <b>PlaceOnTop</b> or <b>PlaceOnBottom</b>.  Valid
           only for <b>Circulate</b> and <b>CirculateRequest</b> events.

       <b>'s'</b> The  <u>state</u> field from the event.  For <b>ButtonPress</b>, <b>ButtonRelease</b>, <b>Enter</b>, <b>KeyPress</b>, <b>KeyRelease</b>, <b>Leave</b>,
           and  <b>Motion</b>  events,  a  decimal  string  is  substituted.   For  <b>Visibility</b>,  one  of  the   strings
           <b>VisibilityUnobscured</b>, <b>VisibilityPartiallyObscured</b>, and <b>VisibilityFullyObscured</b> is substituted.

       <b>'t'</b> The <u>time</u> field from the event.  Valid only for events that contain a <u>time</u> field.

       <b>'w'</b> The  <u>width</u>  field  from  the  event.   Valid only for <b>Configure</b>, <b>ConfigueRequest</b>, <b>Create</b>, <b>Expose</b>, and
           <b>ResizeREquest</b> events.

       <b>'x'</b> The <u>x</u> field from the event.  Valid only for events containing an <u>x</u> field.

       <b>'y'</b> The <u>y</u> field from the event.  Valid only for events containing a <u>y</u> field.

       <b>'@'</b> The string "@<u>x,y</u>" where <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> are as above.  Valid only for events containing <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> fields.  This
           format is used my methods of <b>Tk::Text</b> and similar widgets.

       <b>'A'</b> Substitutes the UNICODE character corresponding to the event,  or  the  empty  string  if  the  event
           doesn't correspond to a UNICODE character (e.g. the shift key was pressed).  <b>XmbLookupString</b> does all
           the  work  of  translating  from  the  event  to  a  UNICODE  character.  Valid only for <b>KeyPress</b> and
           <b>KeyRelease</b> events.

       <b>'B'</b> The <u>border_width</u> field from the event.  Valid only for <b>Configure</b>, <b>ConfigureRequest</b> and <b>Create</b> events.

       <b>'D'</b> This reports the delta value of a  <b>MouseWheel</b>  event.   The  delta value  represents   the   rotation
           units   the   mouse wheel has been moved.  On Windows 95 &amp; 98 systems  the  smallest  value  for  the
           delta is 120.  Future systems may support higher resolution values for the delta.  The  sign  of  the
           value represents the direction the mouse wheel was scrolled.

       <b>'E'</b> The <u>send_event</u> field from the event.  Valid for all event types.

       <b>'K'</b> The  keysym corresponding to the event, substituted as a textual string.  Valid only for <b>KeyPress</b> and
           <b>KeyRelease</b> events.

       <b>'N'</b> The keysym corresponding to the event, substituted as a decimal number.  Valid only for <b>KeyPress</b>  and
           <b>KeyRelease</b> events.

       <b>'R'</b> The <u>root</u> window identifier from the event.  Valid only for events containing a <u>root</u> field.

       <b>'S'</b> The  <u>subwindow</u> window identifier from the event, as an object if it is one otherwise as a hexadecimal
           number.  Valid only for events containing a <u>subwindow</u> field.

       <b>'T'</b> The <u>type</u> field from the event.  Valid for all event types.

       <b>'W'</b> The window to which the event was reported (the $widget field from the event) - as an perl/Tk object.
           Valid for all event types.

       <b>'X'</b> The <u>x_root</u> field from the event.  If a virtual-root window manager is being used then the substituted
           value  is  the  corresponding  x-coordinate  in  the  virtual  root.   Valid  only  for  <b>ButtonPress</b>,
           <b>ButtonRelease</b>, <b>KeyPress</b>, <b>KeyRelease</b>, and <b>Motion</b> events.

       <b>'Y'</b> The <u>y_root</u> field from the event.  If a virtual-root window manager is being used then the substituted
           value  is  the  corresponding  y-coordinate  in  the  virtual  root.   Valid  only  for  <b>ButtonPress</b>,
           <b>ButtonRelease</b>, <b>KeyPress</b>, <b>KeyRelease</b>, and <b>Motion</b> events.

</pre><h4><b>MULTIPLE</b> <b>MATCHES</b></h4><pre>
       It is possible for several bindings to match a given X  event.   If  the  bindings  are  associated  with
       different  <u>tag</u>'s, then each of the bindings will be executed, in order.  By default, a class binding will
       be executed first, followed by a binding for the widget, a binding for its toplevel, and an <b>all</b>  binding.
       The  <b>bindtags</b>  method may be used to change this order for a particular window or to associate additional
       binding tags with the window.

       <b>return</b> and <b>Tk-&gt;break</b> may be used inside a callback to control the processing of matching  callbacks.   If
       <b>return</b>  is  invoked,  then  the  current callback is terminated but Tk will continue processing callbacks
       associated with other <u>tag</u>'s.  If <b>Tk-&gt;break</b> is invoked within a callback, then  that  callback  terminates
       and  no  other  callbacks will be invoked for the event.  (<b>Tk-&gt;break</b> is implemented via perl's <b>die</b> with a
       special value which is "caught" by the perl/Tk "glue" code.)

       If more than one binding matches a particular event and they have the same <u>tag</u>, then  the  most  specific
       binding is chosen and its callback is evaluated.  The following tests are applied, in order, to determine
       which  of  several  matching  sequences  is more specific: (a) an event pattern that specifies a specific
       button or key is more specific than one that doesn't; (b) a longer sequence (in terms of number of events
       matched) is more specific than a shorter sequence; (c) if the modifiers specified in one  pattern  are  a
       subset of the modifiers in another pattern, then the pattern with more modifiers is more specific.  (d) a
       virtual event whose physical pattern matches the sequence is less specific than the same physical pattern
       that  is  not  associated  with  a  virtual event.  (e) given a sequence that matches two or more virtual
       events, one of the virtual events will be chosen, but the order is undefined.

       If the matching sequences contain more than one event, then tests (c)-(e) are applied in order  from  the
       most recent event to the least recent event in the sequences.  If these tests fail to determine a winner,
       then the most recently registered sequence is the winner.

       If there are two (or more) virtual events that are both triggered by the same sequence, and both of those
       virtual  events  are bound to the same window tag, then only one of the virtual events will be triggered,
       and it will be picked at random:

        $widget-&gt;eventAdd('&lt;&lt;Paste&gt;&gt;' =&gt; '&lt;Control-y&gt;');
        $widget-&gt;eventAdd('&lt;&lt;Paste&gt;&gt;' =&gt; '&lt;Button-2&gt;');
        $widget-&gt;eventAdd &lt;&lt;Scroll&gt;&gt;' =&gt; '&lt;Button-2&gt;');
        $widget-&gt;bind('Tk::Entry','&lt;&lt;Paste&gt;&gt;',sub { print 'Paste'});
        $widget-&gt;bind('Tk::Entry','&lt;&lt;Scroll&gt;&gt;', sub {print 'Scroll'});

       If the user types Control-y, the <b>&lt;&lt;Paste&gt;&gt;</b> binding will be invoked, but if the user presses button 2 then
       one of either the <b>&lt;&lt;Paste&gt;&gt;</b> or the <b>&lt;&lt;Scroll&gt;&gt;</b> bindings will  be  invoked,  but  exactly  which  one  gets
       invoked is undefined.

       If  an  X event does not match any of the existing bindings, then the event is ignored.  An unbound event
       is not considered to be an error.

</pre><h4><b>MULTI-EVENT</b> <b>SEQUENCES</b> <b>AND</b> <b>IGNORED</b> <b>EVENTS</b></h4><pre>
       When a <u>sequence</u> specified in a <b>bind</b> method contains more than one event pattern,  then  its  callback  is
       executed  whenever  the  recent  events  (leading  up to and including the current event) match the given
       sequence.   This  means,  for  example,  that  if  button  1   is   clicked   repeatedly   the   sequence
       <b>&lt;Double-ButtonPress-1&gt;</b>  will  match  each  button  press  but the first.  If extraneous events that would
       prevent a match occur in the middle of an event sequence then the extraneous events  are  ignored  unless
       they  are  <b>KeyPress</b>  or <b>ButtonPress</b> events.  For example, <b>&lt;Double-ButtonPress-1&gt;</b> will match a sequence of
       presses of button 1, even though there will be <b>ButtonRelease</b> events (and possibly <b>Motion</b> events)  between
       the  <b>ButtonPress</b>  events.   Furthermore, a <b>KeyPress</b> event may be preceded by any number of other <b>KeyPress</b>
       events for modifier keys without the modifier keys preventing a match.  For example, the  event  sequence
       <b>aB</b>  will match a press of the <b>a</b> key, a release of the <b>a</b> key, a press of the <b>Shift</b> key, and a press of the
       <b>b</b> key:  the press of <b>Shift</b> is ignored because it is a modifier key.  Finally, if  several  <b>Motion</b>  events
       occur in a row, only the last one is used for purposes of matching binding sequences.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       If an error occurs in executing the callback for a binding then the <b>Tk::Error</b> mechanism is used to report
       the  error.   The  <b>Tk::Error</b>  mechanism will be executed at same call level, and associated with the same
       <b>MainWindow</b> as as the callback was invoked.

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
       Note that for the <b>Canvas</b> widget, the call to <b>bind</b> has to be fully qualified. This  is  because  there  is
       already a bind method for the <b>Canvas</b> widget, which binds individual canvas tags.
