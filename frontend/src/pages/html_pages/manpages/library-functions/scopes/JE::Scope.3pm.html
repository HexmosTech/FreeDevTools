       JE::Scope - JavaScript scope chain (what makes closures work)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       JavaScript code runs within an execution context which has a scope chain associated with it. This class
       implements this scope chain. When a variable is accessed the objects in the scope chain are searched till
       the variable is found.

       A JE::Scope object can also be used as global (JE) object. Any methods it does not understand will be
       delegated to the object at the bottom of the stack (the far end of the chain), so that "$scope-&gt;null"
       means the same thing as "$scope-&gt;[0]-&gt;null".

       Objects of this class consist of a reference to an array, the elements of which are the objects in the
       chain (the first element being the global object). (Think of it as a stack.)

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       find_var($name, $value)
       find_var($name)
           This  method  searches  through the scope chain, starting at the end of the array, until it finds the
           variable named by the first argument. If the second argument is present, it  sets  the  variable.  It
           then returns an lvalue (a JE::LValue object) that references the variable.

       new_var($name, $value)
       new_var($name)
           This  method  creates  (and  optionally sets the value of) a new variable in the variable object (the
           same thing that JavaScript's "var" keyword does) and returns an lvalue.

           The variable object is the first object in the scope chain (searching from the top of the stack) that
           is a call object, or "$scope-&gt;[0]" if no call object is found.

</pre><h4><b>CONSTRUCTOR</b></h4><pre>
       None. Just bless an array reference. You should not need to do this because it is done  for  you  by  the
       "JE" and "JE::Object::Function" classes.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       JE
       JE::LValue
       JE::Object::Function
