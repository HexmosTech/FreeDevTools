</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       LWP::RobotUA - a class for well-behaved Web robots

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use LWP::RobotUA;
         my $ua = LWP::RobotUA-&gt;new('my-robot/0.1', '<a href="mailto:me@foo.com">me@foo.com</a>');
         $ua-&gt;<a href="../man10/delay.10.html">delay</a>(10);  # be very nice -- max one hit every ten minutes!
         ...

         # Then just use it just like a normal LWP::UserAgent:
         my $response = $ua-&gt;get('<a href="http://whatever.int/">http://whatever.int/</a>...');
         ...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This class implements a user agent that is suitable for robot applications.  Robots should be nice to the
       servers they visit.  They should consult the <u>/robots.txt</u> file to ensure that they are welcomed and they
       should not make requests too frequently.

       But before you consider writing a robot, take a look at &lt;<a href="http://www.robotstxt.org/">http://www.robotstxt.org/</a>&gt;.

       When you use an <u>LWP::RobotUA</u> object as your user agent, then you do not really have to think about these
       things yourself; "robots.txt" files are automatically consulted and obeyed, the server isn't queried too
       rapidly, and so on.  Just send requests as you do when you are using a normal <u>LWP::UserAgent</u> object
       (using "$ua-&gt;get(...)", "$ua-&gt;head(...)", "$ua-&gt;request(...)", etc.), and this special agent will make
       sure you are nice.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       The LWP::RobotUA is a sub-class of LWP::UserAgent and implements the same methods. In addition the
       following methods are provided:

   <b>new</b>
           my $ua = LWP::RobotUA-&gt;new( %options )
           my $ua = LWP::RobotUA-&gt;new( $agent, $from )
           my $ua = LWP::RobotUA-&gt;new( $agent, $from, $rules )

       The LWP::UserAgent options "agent" and "from" are mandatory.  The options "delay", "use_sleep" and
       "rules" initialize attributes private to the RobotUA.  If "rules" are not provided, then WWW::RobotRules
       is instantiated providing an internal database of <u>robots.txt</u>.

       It is also possible to just pass the value of "agent", "from" and optionally "rules" as plain positional
       arguments.

   <b>delay</b>
           my $delay = $ua-&gt;delay;
           $ua-&gt;delay( $minutes );

       Get/set the minimum delay between requests to the same server, in <u>minutes</u>.  The default is 1 minute.
       Note that this number doesn't have to be an integer; for example, this sets the delay to 10 seconds:

           $ua-&gt;delay(10/60);

   <b>use_sleep</b>
           my $bool = $ua-&gt;use_sleep;
           $ua-&gt;use_sleep( $boolean );

       Get/set a value indicating whether the UA should "sleep" in LWP::RobotUA if requests arrive too fast,
       defined as "$ua-&gt;delay" minutes not passed since last request to the given server.  The default is true.
       If this value is false then an internal "SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE" response will be generated.  It will have a
       "Retry-After" header that indicates when it is OK to send another request to this server.

   <b>rules</b>
           my $rules = $ua-&gt;rules;
           $ua-&gt;rules( $rules );

       Set/get which <u>WWW::RobotRules</u> object to use.

   <b>no_visits</b>
           my $num = $ua-&gt;no_visits( $netloc )

       Returns the number of documents fetched from this server host. Yeah I know, this method should probably
       have been named "num_visits" or something like that. :-(

   <b>host_wait</b>
           my $num = $ua-&gt;host_wait( $netloc )

       Returns the number of <u>seconds</u> (from now) you must wait before you can make a new request to this host.

   <b>as_string</b>
           my $string = $ua-&gt;as_string;

       Returns a string that describes the state of the UA.  Mainly useful for debugging.
