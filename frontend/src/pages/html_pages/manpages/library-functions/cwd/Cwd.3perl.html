       Cwd - get pathname of current working directory

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Cwd;
           my $dir = getcwd;

           use Cwd 'abs_path';
           my $abs_path = abs_path($file);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module provides functions for determining the pathname of the current working directory.  It is
       recommended that getcwd (or another *<b>cwd()</b> function) be used in <u>all</u> code to ensure portability.

       By default, it exports the functions <b>cwd()</b>, <b>getcwd()</b>, <b>fastcwd()</b>, and <b>fastgetcwd()</b> (and, on Win32,
       <b>getdcwd()</b>) into the caller's namespace.

   <b>getcwd</b> <b>and</b> <b>friends</b>
       Each of these functions are called without arguments and return the absolute path of the current working
       directory.

       getcwd
               my $cwd = getcwd();

           Returns the current working directory.  On error returns "undef", with $! set to indicate the error.

           Exposes the POSIX function <b><a href="../man3/getcwd.3.html">getcwd</a></b>(3) or re-implements it if it's not available.

       cwd
               my $cwd = cwd();

           The <b>cwd()</b> is the most natural form for the current architecture.  For most systems it is identical to
           `pwd` (but without the trailing line terminator).

       fastcwd
               my $cwd = fastcwd();

           A more dangerous version of <b>getcwd()</b>, but potentially faster.

           It  might conceivably <b>chdir()</b> you out of a directory that it can't <b>chdir()</b> you back into.  If fastcwd
           encounters a problem it will return undef but will probably leave you in a different directory.   For
           a  measure of extra security, if everything appears to have worked, the <b>fastcwd()</b> function will check
           that it leaves you in the same directory that it started in.  If it has changed it  will  "die"  with
           the  message  "Unstable  directory  path, current directory changed unexpectedly".  That should never
           happen.

       fastgetcwd
             my $cwd = fastgetcwd();

           The <b>fastgetcwd()</b> function is provided as a synonym for <b>cwd()</b>.

       getdcwd
               my $cwd = getdcwd();
               my $cwd = getdcwd('C:');

           The <b>getdcwd()</b> function is also provided on  Win32  to  get  the  current  working  directory  on  the
           specified  drive, since Windows maintains a separate current working directory for each drive.  If no
           drive is specified then the current drive is assumed.

           This function simply calls the Microsoft C library <b>_getdcwd()</b> function.

   <b>abs_path</b> <b>and</b> <b>friends</b>
       These functions are exported only on request.  They each take a single argument and return  the  absolute
       pathname for it.  If no argument is given they'll use the current working directory.

       abs_path
             my $abs_path = abs_path($file);

           Uses  the same algorithm as <b>getcwd()</b>.  Symbolic links and relative-path components ("." and "..") are
           resolved to return the canonical pathname, just like <b><a href="../man3/realpath.3.html">realpath</a></b>(3).  On error returns "undef", with  $!
           set to indicate the error.

       realpath
             my $abs_path = realpath($file);

           A synonym for <b>abs_path()</b>.

       fast_abs_path
             my $abs_path = fast_abs_path($file);

           A more dangerous, but potentially faster version of abs_path.

   <b>$ENV{PWD}</b>
       If you ask to override your <b>chdir()</b> built-in function,

         use Cwd qw(chdir);

       then your PWD environment variable will be kept up to date.  Note that it will only be kept up to date if
       all packages which use chdir import it from Cwd.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       •   Since  the  path  separators  are  different  on some operating systems ('/' on Unix, ':' on MacPerl,
           etc...) we recommend you use the File::Spec modules wherever portability is a concern.

       •   Actually, on Mac OS, the getcwd(), fastgetcwd() and fastcwd() functions are all aliases for the cwd()
           function, which, on Mac OS,  calls  `pwd`.   Likewise,  the  abs_path()  function  is  an  alias  for
           fast_abs_path().
