</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       ENTSR - Called by a user to set recovery mode in NCAR Graphics.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       CALL ENTSR(IROLD,IRNEW)

</pre><h4><b>C-BINDING</b> <b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;ncarg/ncargC.h&gt;

       void c_entsr(int *irold, int irnew)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The FORTRAN statement "CALL ENTSR(IROLD,IRNEW)" is normally used to enter recovery mode and save the
       previous value of the internal error-recovery flag, but it can also be used to exit from recovery mode
       and save the previous value of the flag, or to just get the value of the flag, without changing it.

       If recovery mode is turned off by a call to ENTSR at a time when the internal error flag is non-zero,
       this is treated as a fatal error; the error message is printed, the dump routine FDUM is called, and a
       STOP is executed.

       The arguments of ENTSR are as follows:

       IROLD       (an  output  variable  of  type  INTEGER)  - Receives the old value of the internal flag that
                   indicates whether recovery mode is in effect or not.  In the former case, the returned  value
                   will be a 1; in the latter case, it will be a 2.  Normally, the value returned is saved for a
                   later call to RETSR.

       IRNEW       (an  input  expression  of  type INTEGER) - Specifies what is to be done to the internal flag
                   that indicates whether recovery mode is in effect or not.  If IRNEW is a 1 or a 2, it becomes
                   the new value of the internal recovery-mode flag: the value 1 turns recovery mode on and  the
                   value 2 turns it off.  Other non-zero values are illegal, but, if IRNEW is zero, the state of
                   the internal recovery-mode flag is not changed.

</pre><h4><b>C-BINDING</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The C-binding argument descriptions are the same as the FORTRAN argument descriptions.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Use the ncargex command to see the following relevant examples: tseter, arex02.

</pre><h4><b>ACCESS</b></h4><pre>
       To  use  ENTSR  or c_entsr, load the NCAR Graphics libraries ncarg, ncarg_gks, and ncarg_c, preferably in
       that order.
