           use builtin ':5.40';  # most of the above

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Perl provides several utility functions in the "builtin" package. These are plain functions, and look and
       behave just like regular user-defined functions do. They do not provide new syntax or require special
       parsing. These functions are always present in the interpreter and can be called at any time by their
       fully-qualified names. By default they are not available as short names, but can be requested for
       convenience.

       Individual named functions can be imported by listing them as import parameters on the "use" statement
       for this pragma.

       <b>Warning</b>:  At present, many of the functions in the "builtin" namespace are experimental.  Calling them
       will trigger warnings of the "experimental::builtin" category.

   <b>Lexical</b> <b>Import</b>
       This pragma module creates <u>lexical</u> aliases in the currently-compiling scope to these builtin functions.
       This is similar to the lexical effect of other pragmas such as strict and feature.

           sub classify
           {
               my $val = shift;

               use builtin 'is_bool';
               return is_bool($val) ? "boolean" : "not a boolean";
           }

           # the is_bool() function is no longer visible here
           # but may still be called by builtin::is_bool()

       Because these functions are imported lexically, rather than by package symbols, the user does not need to
       take any special measures to ensure they don't accidentally appear as object methods from a class.

           package An::Object::Class {
               use builtin 'true', 'false';
               ...
           }

           # does not appear as a method
           An::Object::Class-&gt;true;

           # Can't locate object method "true" via package "An::Object::Class"
           #   at ...

       Once imported, a lexical function is much like any other lexical symbol (such as a variable) in that it
       cannot be removed again.  If you wish to limit the visiblity of an imported "builtin" function, put it
       inside its own scope:

           {
             use builtin 'refaddr';
             ...
           }

   <b>Version</b> <b>Bundles</b>
       The entire set of builtin functions that were considered non-experimental by a version of perl can be
       imported all at once, by requesting a version bundle.  This is done by giving the perl release version
       (without its subversion suffix) after a colon character:

           use builtin ':5.40';

       The following bundles currently exist:

           Version    Includes
           -------    --------

           :5.40      true false weaken unweaken is_weak blessed refaddr reftype
                      ceil floor is_tainted trim indexed

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>true</b>
           $val = true;

       Returns the boolean truth value. While any scalar value can be tested for truth and most defined, non-
       empty and non-zero values are considered "true" by perl, this one is special in that "is_bool" considers
       it to be a distinguished boolean value.

       This gives an equivalent value to expressions like "!!1" or "!0".

   <b>false</b>
           $val = false;

       Returns the boolean fiction value. While any non-true scalar value is considered "false" by perl, this
       one is special in that "is_bool" considers it to be a distinguished boolean value.

       This gives an equivalent value to expressions like "!!0" or "!1".

   <b>is_bool</b>
           $bool = is_bool($val);

       This function is currently <b>experimental</b>.

       Returns true when given a distinguished boolean value, or false if not. A distinguished boolean value is
       the result of any boolean-returning builtin function (such as "true" or "is_bool" itself), boolean-
       returning operator (such as the "eq" or "==" comparison tests or the "!" negation operator), or any
       variable containing one of these results.

       This function used to be named "isbool". A compatibility alias is provided currently but will be removed
       in a later version.

   <b>inf</b>
           $num = inf;

       This function is currently <b>experimental</b>.

       Returns the floating-point infinity value.

   <b>nan</b>
           $num = nan;

       This function is currently <b>experimental</b>.

       Returns the floating-point "Not-a-Number" value.

   <b>weaken</b>
           weaken($ref);

       Weakens a reference. A weakened reference does not contribute to the reference count of its referent. If
       only weakened references to a referent remain, it will be disposed of, and all remaining weak references
       to it will have their value set to "undef".

   <b>unweaken</b>
           unweaken($ref);

       Strengthens a reference, undoing the effects of a previous call to "weaken".

   <b>is_weak</b>
           $bool = is_weak($ref);

       Returns true when given a weakened reference, or false if not a reference or not weak.

       This function used to be named "isweak". A compatibility alias is provided currently but will be removed
       in a later version.

   <b>blessed</b>
           $str = blessed($ref);

       Returns the package name for an object reference, or "undef" for a non-reference or reference that is not
       an object.

   <b>refaddr</b>
           $num = refaddr($ref);

       Returns the memory address for a reference, or "undef" for a non-reference.  This value is not likely to
       be very useful for pure Perl code, but is handy as a means to test for referential identity or
       uniqueness.

   <b>reftype</b>
           $str = reftype($ref);

       Returns the basic container type of the referent of a reference, or "undef" for a non-reference. This is
       returned as a string in all-capitals, such as "ARRAY" for array references, or "HASH" for hash
       references.

   <b>created_as_string</b>
           $bool = created_as_string($val);

       This function is currently <b>experimental</b>.

       Returns a boolean representing if the argument value was originally created as a string. It will return
       true for any scalar expression whose most recent assignment or modification was of a string-like nature -
       such as assignment from a string literal, or the result of a string operation such as concatenation or
       regexp. It will return false for references (including any object), numbers, booleans and undef.

       It is unlikely that you will want to use this for regular data validation within Perl, as it will not
       return true for regular numbers that are still perfectly usable as strings, nor for any object reference
       - especially objects that overload the stringification operator in an attempt to behave more like
       strings. For example

           my $val = URI-&gt;new( "https://metacpan.org/" );

           if( created_as_string $val ) { ... }    # this will not execute

   <b>created_as_number</b>
           $bool = created_as_number($val);

       This function is currently <b>experimental</b>.

       Returns a boolean representing if the argument value was originally created as a number. It will return
       true for any scalar expression whose most recent assignment or modification was of a numerical nature -
       such as assignment from a number literal, or the result of a numerical operation such as addition. It
       will return false for references (including any object), strings, booleans and undef.

       It is unlikely that you will want to use this for regular data validation within Perl, as it will not
       return true for regular strings of decimal digits that are still perfectly usable as numbers, nor for any
       object reference - especially objects that overload the numification operator in an attempt to behave
       more like numbers. For example

           my $val = Math::BigInt-&gt;new( 123 );

           if( created_as_number $val ) { ... }    # this will not execute

       While most Perl code should operate on scalar values without needing to know their creation history,
       these two functions are intended to be used by data serialisation modules such as JSON encoders or
       similar situations, where language interoperability concerns require making a distinction between values
       that are fundamentally stringlike versus numberlike in nature.

   <b>stringify</b>
           $str = stringify($val);

       Returns a new plain perl string that represents the given argument.

       When given a value that is already a string, a copy of this value is returned unchanged. False booleans
       are treated like the empty string.

       Numbers are turned into a decimal representation. True booleans are treated like the number 1.

       References to objects in classes that have overload and define the "" overload entry will use the
       delegated method to provide a value here.

       Non-object references, or references to objects in classes without a "" overload will return a string
       that names the underlying container type of the reference, its memory address, and possibly its class
       name if it is an object.

   <b>ceil</b>
           $num = ceil($num);

       Returns the smallest integer value greater than or equal to the given numerical argument.

   <b>floor</b>
           $num = floor($num);

       Returns the largest integer value less than or equal to the given numerical argument.

   <b>indexed</b>
           @ivpairs = indexed(@items)

       Returns an even-sized list of number/value pairs, where each pair is formed of a number giving an index
       in the original list followed by the value at that position in it.  I.e. returns a list twice the size of
       the original, being equal to

           (0, $items[0], 1, $items[1], 2, $items[2], ...)

       Note that unlike the core "values" function, this function returns copies of its original arguments, not
       aliases to them. Any modifications of these copies are <u>not</u> reflected in modifications to the original.

           my @x = ...;
           $_++ for indexed @x;  # The @x array remains unaffected

       This function is primarily intended to be useful combined with multi-variable "foreach" loop syntax; as

           foreach my ($index, $value) (indexed LIST) {
               ...
           }

       In scalar context this function returns the size of the list that it would otherwise have returned, and
       provokes a warning in the "scalar" category.

   <b>trim</b>
           $stripped = trim($string);

       Returns the input string with whitespace stripped from the beginning and end. <b>trim()</b> will remove these
       characters:

       " ", an ordinary space.

       "\t", a tab.

       "\n", a new line (line feed).

       "\r", a carriage return.

       and all other Unicode characters that are flagged as whitespace.  A complete list is in "Whitespace" in
       perlrecharclass.

           $var = "  Hello world   ";            # "Hello world"
           $var = "\t\t\tHello world";           # "Hello world"
           $var = "Hello world\n";               # "Hello world"
           $var = "\x{2028}Hello world\x{3000}"; # "Hello world"

       "trim" is equivalent to:

           $str =~ s/\A\s+|\s+\z//urg;

       For Perl versions where this feature is not available look at the String::Util module for a comparable
       implementation.

   <b>is_tainted</b>
           $bool = is_tainted($var);

       Returns true when given a tainted variable.

   <b>export_lexically</b>
           export_lexically($name1, $ref1, $name2, $ref2, ...)

       This function is currently <b>experimental</b>.

       Exports new lexical names into the scope currently being compiled. Names given by the first of each pair
       of values will refer to the corresponding item whose reference is given by the second. Types of item that
       are permitted are subroutines, and scalar, array, and hash variables. If the item is a subroutine, the
       name may optionally be prefixed with the "&amp;" sigil, but for convenience it doesn't have to. For items
       that are variables the sigil is required, and must match the type of the variable.

           export_lexically func    =&gt; \&amp;func,
                            '&amp;func' =&gt; \&amp;func;  # same as above

           export_lexically '$scalar' =&gt; \my $var;

           # The following are not permitted
           export_lexically '$var' =&gt; \@arr;   # sigil does not match
           export_lexically name =&gt; \$scalar;  # implied '&amp;' sigil does not match

           export_lexically '*name' =&gt; \*globref;  # globrefs are not supported

       This must be called at compile time; which typically means during a "BEGIN" block. Usually this would be
       used as part of an "import" method of a module, when invoked as part of a "use ..." statement.

   <b>load_module</b>
           load_module($module_name);

       This function is currently <b>experimental</b>.

       Loads a named module from the inclusion paths (@INC).  $module_name must be a string that provides a
       module name.  It cannot be omitted, and providing an invalid module name will result in an exception.
       Not providing any argument results in a compilation error.  Returns the loaded module's name on success.

       The effect of "load_module"-ing a module is mostly the same as "require"-ing, down to the same error
       conditions when the module does not exist, does not compile, or does not evaluate to a true value.  See
       also the "module_true" feature.

       "load_module" can't be used to require a particular version of Perl, nor can it be given a bareword
       module name as an argument.
