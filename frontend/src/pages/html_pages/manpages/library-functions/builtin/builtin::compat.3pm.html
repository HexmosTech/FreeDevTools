         );

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Provides builtin functions for perl versions that do not include the builtin module.

       No functions are exported by default.

       This module does its best to behave similar to builtin, which creates its exported functions as lexicals.
       The functions will be created in the currently compiling scope, not the immediate caller of
       "builtin::compat-&gt;import".  The functions will also be removed at the end of the compilation scope using
       namespace::clean.

       The builtin functions will be used directly when they are available.

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       true
           See "true" in builtin.

       false
           See "false" in builtin.

       is_bool
           See "is_bool" in builtin.

           Prior  to perl 5.36, it was not possible to track boolean values fully accurately. This function will
           not be perfectly accurate on earlier perl versions.

       inf See "inf" in builtin.

       nan See "nan" in builtin.

       weaken
           See "weaken" in builtin.

       unweaken
           See "unweaken" in builtin.

       is_weak
           See "is_weak" in builtin.

       blessed
           See "blessed" in builtin.

       refaddr
           See "refaddr" in builtin.

       reftype
           See "reftype" in builtin.

       created_as_string
           See "created_as_string" in builtin.

           Prior to perl 5.36, it was not possible to check if a scalar value was created as a number  or  as  a
           string  fully  accurately.  This function will not be entirely accurate before then, but should be as
           accurate as is possible on these perl versions. In particular, a string like "12345"  that  has  been
           used  as  a  number  will  cause "create_as_string" to return false and "created_as_number" to return
           true.

       created_as_number
           See "created_as_number" in builtin.

           Has the same caveats as "created_as_string".

       stringify
           See "stringify" in builtin.

       ceil
           See "ceil" in builtin.

       floor
           See "floor" in builtin.

       trim
           See "trim" in builtin.

       indexed
           See "indexed" in builtin.

       load_module
           See "load_module" in builtin.
