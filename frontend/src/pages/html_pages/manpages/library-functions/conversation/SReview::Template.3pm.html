</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       SReview::Template - process a string or a file and apply changes to it

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use SReview::Template;
         use SReview::Talk;

         my $talk = SReview::Talk-&gt;new(...);
         my $template = SReview::Template-&gt;new(talk =&gt; $talk, vars =&gt; { foo =&gt; "bar" }, regexvars =&gt; {"@FOO@" =&gt; "foo"});
         my $processed = $template-&gt;string("The @FOO@ is &lt;%== $foo %&gt;, and the talk is titled &lt;%== $talk-&gt;title %&gt;");
         # $processed now contains "The foo is bar, and the talk is titled ..."
         # (with the actual talk title there)
         $template-&gt;file("inputfile.txt", "outputfile.txt"

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       "SReview::Template" is a simple wrapper around Mojo::Template. All the variables that are passed in to
       the "vars" parameter are passed as named variables to Mojo::Template.

       In addition, some bits of SReview previously did some simple sed-like search-and-replace templating. For
       backwards compatibility, this module also supports such search-and-replace templating (e.g.,
       SReview::Template::SVG has a few of those). These, however, are now deprecated; the $talk variable and
       Mojo::Template-style templates should be used instead.

</pre><h4><b>ATTRIBUTES</b></h4><pre>
       "SReview::Template" objects support the following attributes:

   <b>talk</b>
       An SReview::Talk object for the talk that this template is for.  Required. Will be passed on to the
       template as the $talk variable.

   <b>vars</b>
       Additional Mojo::Template variables to be made available to the template.

   <b>regexvars</b>
       Variables to be replaced by search-and-replace.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>file</b>
       A method to process an input file through the templating engine into an output file.

       Takes to arguments: the name of the input file, followed by the name of the output file.

       Is implemented in terms of the "string" method.

   <b>string</b>
       A function to process a string, passed as the only argument. Returns the result of the template function.
