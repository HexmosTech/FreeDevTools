       Mail::SpamAssassin::Plugin::DCC - perform DCC check of messages

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         loadplugin Mail::SpamAssassin::Plugin::DCC

         full DCC_CHECK        eval:check_dcc()
         full DCC_CHECK_50_79  eval:check_dcc_reputation_range('50','79')

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The DCC or Distributed Checksum Clearinghouse is a system of servers collecting and counting checksums of
       millions of mail messages.  The counts can be used by SpamAssassin to detect and filter spam.

       See https://www.dcc-servers.net/dcc/ for more information about DCC.

       Note that DCC is disabled by default in "v310.pre" because its use requires software that is not
       distributed with SpamAssassin and that has license restrictions for certain commercial uses.  See the DCC
       license at https://www.dcc-servers.net/dcc/LICENSE for details.

       Enable it by uncommenting the "loadplugin Mail::SpamAssassin::Plugin::DCC" confdir/v310.pre or by adding
       this line to your local.pre.  It might also be necessary to install a DCC package, port, rpm, or
       equivalent from your operating system distributor or a tarball from the primary DCC source at
       https://www.dcc-servers.net/dcc/#download See also https://www.dcc-servers.net/dcc/INSTALL.html

</pre><h4><b>TAGS</b></h4><pre>
       The following tags are added to the set, available for use in reports, header fields, other plugins,
       etc.:

         _DCCB_    DCC server ID in X-DCC-*-Metrics header field name
         _DCCR_    X-DCC-*-Metrics header field body
         _DCCREP_  DCC Reputation or percent bulk mail (0..100) from
                     commercial DCC software

</pre><h4><b>USER</b> <b>SETTINGS</b></h4><pre>
       use_dcc (0|1)       (default: 1)
           Whether to use DCC, if it is available.

       use_dcc_rep (0|1)        (default: 1)
           Whether  to use the commercial DCC Reputation feature, if it is available.  Note that reputation data
           is free for all starting from DCC 2.x version, where it's automatically used.

       dcc_body_max NUMBER
       dcc_fuz1_max NUMBER
       dcc_fuz2_max NUMBER
           Sets how often a message's body/fuz1/fuz2 checksum must have been reported to the DCC  server  before
           SpamAssassin will consider the DCC check hit.  999999 is DCC's MANY count.

           The default is 999999 for all these options.

       dcc_rep_percent NUMBER
           Only  the  commercial  DCC software provides DCC Reputations (but starting from DCC 2.x version it is
           available for all).  A DCC Reputation is the percentage of bulk mail received from the last untrusted
           relay in the path taken by a mail message as measured  by  all  commercial  DCC  installations.   See
           <a href="http://www.rhyolite.com/dcc/reputations.html">http://www.rhyolite.com/dcc/reputations.html</a>  You  "must" whitelist your trusted relays or MX servers
           with MX or MXDCC lines in /var/dcc/whiteclnt as described in the main DCC man page  to  avoid  seeing
           your       own       MX       servers       as       sources       of       bulk      mail.       See
           https://www.dcc-servers.net/dcc/dcc-tree/dcc.html#White-and-Blacklists The default is 90.

</pre><h4><b>ADMINISTRATOR</b> <b>SETTINGS</b></h4><pre>
       dcc_timeout n       (default: 5)
           How many seconds you wait for DCC to complete, before scanning continues without the DCC  results.  A
           numeric  value  is  optionally  suffixed by a time unit (s, m, h, d, w, indicating seconds (default),
           minutes, hours, days, weeks).

       dcc_home STRING
           This option tells SpamAssassin where to find the dcc homedir.  If  not  specified,  try  to  use  the
           locally configured directory from the "cdcc homedir" command.  Try /var/dcc if that command fails.

       dcc_dccifd_path STRING
           This  option  tells SpamAssassin where to find the dccifd socket instead of a local Unix socket named
           "dccifd" in the "dcc_home" directory.  If  a  socket  is  specified  or  found,  use  it  instead  of
           "dccproc".

           If specified, "dcc_dccifd_path" is the absolute path of local Unix socket or an INET socket specified
           as  "[Host]:Port"  or  "Host:Port".  Host can be an IPv4 or IPv6 address or a host name Port is a TCP
           port number. The brackets are required for an IPv6 address.

           The default is "undef".

       dcc_path STRING
           Where to find the "dccproc" client program instead of relying on  SpamAssassin  to  find  it  in  the
           current  PATH or "dcc_home/bin". This must often be set, because the current PATH is cleared by <u>taint</u>
           <u>mode</u> in the Perl interpreter,

           If a "dccifd" socket is found in "dcc_home" or specified explicitly with "dcc_dccifd_path",  use  the
           <a href="../man8/dccifd.8.html">dccifd</a>(8) interface instead of "dccproc".

           The default is "undef".

       dcc_options options
           Specify additional options to the <b><a href="../man8/dccproc.8.html">dccproc</a></b>(8) command.  Only characters in the range [0-9A-Za-z ,._/-]
           are allowed for security reasons.

           The default is "undef".

       dccifd_options options
           Specify  additional  options  to  send  to the dccifd daemon with the ASCII protocol described on the
           <b><a href="../man8/dccifd.8.html">dccifd</a></b>(8) man page.  Only characters in the range [0-9A-Za-z ,._/-] are allowed for security reasons.

           The default is "undef".

       dcc_learn_score n        (default: undef)
           Report messages with total scores this much larger than the SpamAssassin spam  threshold  to  DCC  as
           spam.
