</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Math::Round - Perl extension for rounding numbers

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Math::Round qw(...those desired... or :all);

         $rounded = round($scalar);
         @rounded = round(LIST...);
         $rounded = nearest($target, $scalar);
         @rounded = nearest($target, LIST...);

         # and other functions as described below

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Math::Round</b> supplies functions that will round numbers in different ways.  The functions <b>round</b> and
       <b>nearest</b> are exported by default; others are available as described below.  "use ... qw(:all)" exports all
       functions.

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>round</b> LIST
         Rounds  the  number(s)  to  the  nearest  integer.   In scalar context, returns a single value; in list
         context, returns a list of values.  Numbers that are halfway  between  two  integers  are  rounded  "to
         infinity";  i.e.,  positive values are rounded up (e.g., 2.5 becomes 3) and negative values down (e.g.,
         -2.5 becomes -3).

         Starting in Perl 5.22, the POSIX module by default exports all functions, including one named  "round".
         If you use both POSIX and this module, exercise due caution.

       <b>round_even</b> LIST
         Rounds  the  number(s)  to  the  nearest  integer.   In scalar context, returns a single value; in list
         context, returns a list of values.  Numbers that are halfway between two integers are  rounded  to  the
         nearest even number; e.g., 2.5 becomes 2, 3.5 becomes 4, and -2.5 becomes -2.

       <b>round_odd</b> LIST
         Rounds  the  number(s)  to  the  nearest  integer.   In scalar context, returns a single value; in list
         context, returns a list of values.  Numbers that are halfway between two integers are  rounded  to  the
         nearest odd number; e.g., 3.5 becomes 3, 4.5 becomes 5, and -3.5 becomes -3.

       <b>round_rand</b> LIST
         Rounds  the  number(s)  to  the  nearest  integer.   In scalar context, returns a single value; in list
         context, returns a list of values.  Numbers that are halfway between two integers  are  rounded  up  or
         down  in  a  random fashion.  For example, in a large number of trials, 2.5 will become 2 half the time
         and 3 half the time.

       <b>nearest</b> TARGET, LIST
         Rounds the number(s) to the nearest multiple of the target value.  TARGET must be positive.  In  scalar
         context,  returns  a single value; in list context, returns a list of values.  Numbers that are halfway
         between two multiples of the target will be rounded to infinity.  For example:

           nearest(10, 44)    yields  40
           nearest(10, 46)            50
           nearest(10, 45)            50
           nearest(25, 328)          325
           nearest(.1, 4.567)          4.6
           nearest(10, -45)          -50

       <b>nearest_ceil</b> TARGET, LIST
         Rounds the number(s) to the nearest multiple of the target value.  TARGET must be positive.  In  scalar
         context,  returns  a single value; in list context, returns a list of values.  Numbers that are halfway
         between two multiples of the target will be rounded to the ceiling, i.e. the next algebraically  higher
         multiple.  For example:

           nearest_ceil(10, 44)    yields  40
           nearest_ceil(10, 45)            50
           nearest_ceil(10, -45)          -40

       <b>nearest_floor</b> TARGET, LIST
         Rounds  the number(s) to the nearest multiple of the target value.  TARGET must be positive.  In scalar
         context, returns a single value; in list context, returns a list of values.  Numbers that  are  halfway
         between  two  multiples  of  the target will be rounded to the floor, i.e. the next algebraically lower
         multiple.  For example:

           nearest_floor(10, 44)    yields  40
           nearest_floor(10, 45)            40
           nearest_floor(10, -45)          -50

       <b>nearest_rand</b> TARGET, LIST
         Rounds the number(s) to the nearest multiple of the target value.  TARGET must be positive.  In  scalar
         context,  returns  a single value; in list context, returns a list of values.  Numbers that are halfway
         between two multiples of the target will be rounded up or down in a random fashion.  For example, in  a
         large number of trials, "nearest(10, 45)" will yield 40 half the time and 50 half the time.

       <b>nlowmult</b> TARGET, LIST
         Returns the next lower multiple of the number(s) in LIST.  TARGET must be positive.  In scalar context,
         returns  a  single  value;  in  list  context,  returns a list of values.  Numbers that are between two
         multiples of the target will be adjusted to the nearest multiples of LIST that are algebraically lower.
         For example:

           nlowmult(10, 44)    yields  40
           nlowmult(10, 46)            40
           nlowmult(25, 328)          325
           nlowmult(.1, 4.567)          4.5
           nlowmult(10, -41)          -50

       <b>nhimult</b> TARGET, LIST
         Returns the next higher multiple of the number(s)  in  LIST.   TARGET  must  be  positive.   In  scalar
         context,  returns  a single value; in list context, returns a list of values.  Numbers that are between
         two multiples of the target will be adjusted to the nearest multiples of LIST  that  are  algebraically
         higher. For example:

           nhimult(10, 44)    yields  50
           nhimult(10, 46)            50
           nhimult(25, 328)          350
           nhimult(.1, 4.512)          4.6
           nhimult(10, -49)          -40

</pre><h4><b>VARIABLE</b></h4><pre>
       The  variable  <b>$Math::Round::half</b>  is  used  by  most routines in this module. Its value is very slightly
       larger than 0.5, for reasons explained below. If you find that your  application  does  not  deliver  the
       expected results, you may reset this variable at will.

</pre><h4><b>STANDARD</b> <b>FLOATING-POINT</b> <b>DISCLAIMER</b></h4><pre>
       Floating-point  numbers  are, of course, a rational subset of the real numbers, so calculations with them
       are not always exact.  Numbers that are supposed to be halfway between two others may surprise  you;  for
       instance,  0.85  may  not be exactly halfway between 0.8 and 0.9, and (0.75 - 0.7) may not be the same as
       (0.85 - 0.8).

       In order to give more predictable results, these routines use a  value  for  one-half  that  is  slightly
       larger  than  0.5.  Nevertheless, if the numbers to be rounded are stored as floating-point, they will be
       subject as usual to the mercies of your hardware, your C compiler, etc.
