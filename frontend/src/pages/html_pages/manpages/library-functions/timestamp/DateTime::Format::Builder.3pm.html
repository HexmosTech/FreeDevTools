</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       DateTime::Format::Builder - Create DateTime parser classes and objects.

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 0.83

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           package DateTime::Format::Brief;

           use DateTime::Format::Builder (
               parsers =&gt; {
                   parse_datetime =&gt; [
                       {
                           regex  =&gt; qr/^(\d{4})(\d\d)(\d\d)(\d\d)(\d\d)(\d\d)$/,
                           params =&gt; [qw( year month day hour minute second )],
                       },
                       {
                           regex  =&gt; qr/^(\d{4})(\d\d)(\d\d)$/,
                           params =&gt; [qw( year month day )],
                       },
                   ],
               }
           );

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       DateTime::Format::Builder creates DateTime parsers. Many string formats of dates and times are simple and
       just require a basic regular expression to extract the relevant information. Builder provides a simple
       way to do this without writing reams of structural code.

       Builder provides a number of methods, most of which you'll never need, or at least rarely need. They're
       provided more for exposing of the module's innards to any subclasses, or for when you need to do
       something slightly beyond what I expected.

</pre><h4><b>TUTORIAL</b></h4><pre>
       See DateTime::Format::Builder::Tutorial.

</pre><h4><b>ERROR</b> <b>HANDLING</b> <b>AND</b> <b>BAD</b> <b>PARSES</b></h4><pre>
       Often, I will speak of "undef" being returned, however that's not strictly true.

       When a simple single specification is given for a method, the method isn't given a single parser
       directly. It's given a wrapper that will call "on_fail" if the single parser returns "undef". The single
       parser must return "undef" so that a multiple parser can work nicely and actual errors can be thrown from
       any of the callbacks.

       Similarly, any multiple parsers will only call "on_fail" right at the end when it's tried all it could.

       "on_fail" (see later) is defined, by default, to throw an error.

       Multiple parser specifications can also specify "on_fail" with a coderef as an argument in the options
       block. This will take precedence over the inheritable and overrideable method.

       That said, don't throw real errors from callbacks in multiple parser specifications unless you really
       want parsing to stop right there and not try any other parsers.

       In summary: calling a <b>method</b> will result in either a "DateTime" object being returned or an error being
       thrown (unless you've overridden "on_fail" or "create_method", or you've specified a "on_fail" key to a
       multiple parser specification).

       Individual <b>parsers</b> (be they multiple parsers or single parsers) will return either the "DateTime" object
       or "undef".

</pre><h4><b>SINGLE</b> <b>SPECIFICATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       A single specification is a hash ref of instructions on how to create a parser.

       The precise set of keys and values varies according to parser type. There are some common ones though:

       •   length

           <b>length</b>  is  an  optional  parameter  that  can  be used to specify that this particular <u>regex</u> is only
           applicable to strings of a certain fixed length. This can be used to  make  parsers  more  efficient.
           It's strongly recommended that any parser that can use this parameter does.

           You may happily specify the same length twice. The parsers will be tried in order of specification.

           You  can  also specify multiple lengths by giving it an arrayref of numbers rather than just a single
           scalar. If doing so, please keep the number of lengths to a minimum.

           If any specifications without <u>length</u>s are given and the particular  <u>length</u>  parser  fails,  then  the
           non-<u>length</u> parsers are tried.

           This parameter is ignored unless the specification is part of a multiple parser specification.

       •   label

           <b>label</b>  provides  a  name  for  the  specification  and  is  passed  to some of the callbacks about to
           mentioned.

       •   on_match and on_fail

           <b>on_match</b> and <b>on_fail</b> are callbacks. Both routines will be called with parameters of:

           •   input

               <b>input</b> is the input to the parser (after any preprocessing callbacks).

           •   label

               <b>label</b> is the label of the parser if there is one.

           •   self

               <b>self</b> is the object on which the method has been  invoked  (which  may  just  be  a  class  name).
               Naturally, you can then invoke your own methods on it do get information you want.

           •   <b>args</b>  is  an  arrayref  of  any  passed  arguments, if any. If there were no arguments, then this
               parameter is not given.

           These routines will be called depending on whether the <b>regex</b> match succeeded or failed.

       •   preprocess

           <b>preprocess</b> is a callback provided for cleaning up input prior  to  parsing.  It's  given  a  hash  as
           arguments with the following keys:

           •   input

               <b>input</b>  is  the  datetime  string  the  parser  was given (if using multiple specifications and an
               overall <u>preprocess</u> then this is the date after it's been through that preprocessor).

           •   parsed

               <b>parsed</b> is the state of parsing so far. Usually empty at this point unless an  overall  <u>preprocess</u>
               was  given.  Items may be placed in it and will be given to any <b>postprocess</b>or and "DateTime-&gt;new"
               (unless the postprocessor deletes it).

           •   self, args, label

               <b>self</b>, <b>args</b>, <b>label</b> as per <u>on_match</u> and <u>on_fail</u>.

           The return value from the routine is what is given to the <u>regex</u>. Note that this  is  last  code  stop
           before the match.

           <b>Note</b>:  mixing  <u>length</u>  and  a <u>preprocess</u> that modifies the length of the input string is probably not
           what you meant to do. You probably meant to use the <u>multiple</u> <u>parser</u> variant of  <u>preprocess</u>  which  is
           done  <b>before</b>  any  length calculations. This "single parser" variant of <u>preprocess</u> is performed <b>after</b>
           any length calculations.

       •   postprocess

           <b>postprocess</b> is the last code stop before "DateTime-&gt;new" is called. It's given the same arguments  as
           <u>preprocess</u>. This allows it to modify the parsed parameters after the parse and before the creation of
           the object. For example, you might use:

               {
                   regex       =&gt; qr/^(\d\d) (\d\d) (\d\d)$/,
                   params      =&gt; [qw( year  month  day   )],
                   postprocess =&gt; \&amp;_fix_year,
               }

           where "_fix_year" is defined as:

               sub _fix_year {
                   my %args = @_;
                   my ( $date, $p ) = @args{qw( input parsed )};
                   $p-&gt;{year} += $p-&gt;{year} &gt; 69 ? 1900 : 2000;
                   return 1;
               }

           This will cause the two digit years to be corrected according to the cut off. If the year was '69' or
           lower,  then  it  is  made  into  2069 (or 2045, or whatever the year was parsed as). Otherwise it is
           assumed to be 19xx. The DateTime::Format::Mail module uses code similar to this (only it  allows  the
           cut off to be configured and it doesn't use Builder).

           <b>Note</b>:  It  is <b>very</b> <b>important</b> to return an explicit value from the <u>postprocess</u> callback. If the return
           value is false then the parse is taken to have failed. If the return value is true, then the parse is
           taken to have succeeded and "DateTime-&gt;new" is called.

       See the documentation for the individual parsers for their valid keys.

       Parsers at the time of writing are:

       •   DateTime::Format::Builder::Parser::Regex - provides regular expression based parsing.

       •   DateTime::Format::Builder::Parser::Strptime - provides strptime based parsing.

   <b>Subroutines</b> <b>/</b> <b>coderefs</b> <b>as</b> <b>specifications.</b>
       A single parser specification can be a coderef. This was added mostly because it could be and  because  I
       knew someone, somewhere, would want to use it.

       If  the specification is a reference to a piece of code, be it a subroutine, anonymous, or whatever, then
       it's passed more or less straight through. The code should return "undef" in event  of  failure  (or  any
       false  value,  but  "undef"  is  strongly  preferred), or a true value in the event of success (ideally a
       "DateTime" object or some object that has the same interface).

       This all said, I generally wouldn't recommend using this feature unless you have to.

   <b>Callbacks</b>
       I mention a number of callbacks in this document.

       Any time you see a callback being mentioned, you can, if you like, substitute  an  arrayref  of  coderefs
       rather than having the straight coderef.

</pre><h4><b>MULTIPLE</b> <b>SPECIFICATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       These are very easily described as an array of single specifications.

       Note that if the first element of the array is an arrayref, then you're specifying options.

       •   preprocess

           <b>preprocess</b>  lets  you specify a preprocessor that is called before any of the parsers are tried. This
           lets you do things like strip off timezones or any unnecessary data. The most common use people  have
           for  it  at  present  is  to  get  the input date to a particular length so that the <u>length</u> is usable
           (DateTime::Format::ICal would use it to strip off the variable length timezone).

           Arguments are as for the <u>single</u> <u>parser</u> <u>preprocess</u> variant with the  exception  that  <u>label</u>  is  never
           given.

       •   on_fail

           <b>on_fail</b>  should  be  a  reference  to a subroutine that is called if the parser fails. If this is not
           provided, the default action is to call "DateTime::Format::Builder::on_fail", or the "on_fail" method
           of the subclass of DTFB that was used to create the parser.

</pre><h4><b>EXECUTION</b> <b>FLOW</b></h4><pre>
       Builder allows you to plug in a fair few callbacks, which can make  following  how  a  parse  failed  (or
       succeeded unexpectedly) somewhat tricky.

   <b>For</b> <b>Single</b> <b>Specifications</b>
       A single specification will do the following:

       User calls parser:

           my $dt = $class-&gt;parse_datetime($string);

       1.  <u>preprocess</u>  is  called. It's given $string and a reference to the parsing workspace hash, which we'll
           call $p. At this point, $p is empty. The return value is used as $date for the rest  of  this  single
           parser.  Anything put in $p is also used for the rest of this single parser.

       2.  <u>regex</u> is applied.

       3.  If <u>regex</u> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> match, then <u>on_fail</u> is called (and is given $date and also <u>label</u> if it was defined).
           Any return value is ignored and the next thing is for the single parser to return "undef".

           If <u>regex</u> <b>did</b> match, then <u>on_match</u> is called with the same arguments as would be given to <u>on_fail</u>. The
           return value is similarly ignored, but we then move to step 4 rather than exiting the parser.

       4.  <u>postprocess</u>  is  called  with $date and a filled out $p. The return value is taken as a indication of
           whether the parse was a success or not. If it wasn't a success then the single parser  will  exit  at
           this point, returning undef.

       5.  "DateTime-&gt;new" is called and the user is given the resultant "DateTime" object.

       See the section on error handling regarding the "undef"s mentioned above.

   <b>For</b> <b>Multiple</b> <b>Specifications</b>
       With multiple specifications:

       User calls parser:

           my $dt = $class-&gt;complex_parse($string);

       1.  The  overall  <u>preprocess</u>or  is called and is given $string and the hashref $p (identically to the per
           parser <u>preprocess</u> mentioned in the previous flow).

           If the callback modifies $p then a <b>copy</b> of $p is given to each of the individual parsers. This is  so
           parsers won't accidentally pollute each other's workspace.

       2.  If  an appropriate length specific parser is found, then it is called and the single parser flow (see
           the previous section) is followed, and the parser is given a copy of $p and the return value  of  the
           overall <u>preprocess</u>or as $date.

           If a "DateTime" object was returned so we go straight back to the user.

           If no appropriate parser was found, or the parser returned "undef", then we progress to step 3!

       3.  Any non-<u>length</u> based parsers are tried in the order they were specified.

           For each of those the single specification flow above is performed, and is given a copy of the output
           from the overall preprocessor.

           If a real "DateTime" object is returned then we exit back to the user.

           If no parser could parse, then an error is thrown.

       See the section on error handling regarding the "undef"s mentioned above.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       In the general course of things you won't need any of the methods. Life often throws unexpected things at
       us so the methods are all available for use.

   <b>import</b>
       "import"  is  a  wrapper  for  "create_class".  If  you  specify  the <u>class</u> option (see documentation for
       "create_class") it will be ignored.

   <b>create_class</b>
       This method can be used as the runtime  equivalent  of  "import".  That  is,  it  takes  the  exact  same
       parameters as when one does:

           use DateTime::Format::Builder ( ... )

       That can be (almost) equivalently written as:

           use DateTime::Format::Builder;
           DateTime::Format::Builder-&gt;create_class( ... );

       The difference being that the first is done at compile time while the second is done at run time.

       In  the  tutorial  I  said there were only two parameters at present. I lied. There are actually three of
       them.

       •   parsers

           <b>parsers</b>   takes   a   hashref   of   methods   and   their    parser    specifications.    See    the
           DateTime::Format::Builder::Tutorial for details.

           Note that if you define a subroutine of the same name as one of the methods you define here, an error
           will be thrown.

       •   constructor

           <b>constructor</b>  determines  whether and how to create a "new" function in the new class. If given a true
           value, a constructor is created. If given a false value, one isn't.

           If given an anonymous sub or a reference to a sub then that is used as "new".

           The default is 1 (that is, create a constructor using our default code which simply creates a hashref
           and blesses it).

           If your class defines its own "new" method it will not be overwritten. If you define your  own  "new"
           and <b>also</b> tell Builder to define one an error will be thrown.

       •   verbose

           <b>verbose</b>  takes  a  value.  If  the  value  is  "undef",  then  logging is disabled. If the value is a
           filehandle then that's where logging will go. If it's a true value, then output will go to "STDERR".

           Alternatively, call $DateTime::Format::Builder::verbose with the relevant value. Whichever  value  is
           given more recently is adhered to.

           Be aware that verbosity is a global setting.

       •   class

           <b>class</b> is optional and specifies the name of the class in which to create the specified methods.

           If  using  this  method in the guise of "import" then this field will cause an error so it is only of
           use when calling as "create_class".

       •   version

           <b>version</b> is also optional and specifies the value to give $VERSION in the class.  It's  generally  not
           recommended unless you're combining with the <u>class</u> option. A "ExtUtils::MakeMaker" / "CPAN" compliant
           version specification is much better.

       In addition to creating any of the methods it also creates a "new" method that can instantiate (or clone)
       objects.

</pre><h4><b>SUBCLASSING</b></h4><pre>
       In  the  rest  of the documentation I've often lied in order to get some of the ideas across more easily.
       The thing is, this module's  very  flexible.  You  can  get  markedly  different  behaviour  from  simply
       subclassing it and overriding some methods.

   <b>create_method</b>
       Given a parser coderef, returns a coderef that is suitable to be a method.

       The  default action is to call "on_fail" in the event of a non-parse, but you can make it do whatever you
       want.

   <b>on_fail</b>
       This is called in the event of a non-parse (unless you've  overridden  "create_method"  to  do  something
       else.

       The  single  argument  is the input string. The default action is to call "croak". Above, where I've said
       parsers or methods throw errors, this is the method that is doing the error throwing.

       You could conceivably override this method to, say, return "undef".

</pre><h4><b>USING</b> <b>BUILDER</b> <b>OBJECTS</b> <b>aka</b> <b>USERS</b> <b>USING</b> <b>BUILDER</b></h4><pre>
       The methods listed in the METHODS section are all you  generally  need  when  creating  your  own  class.
       Sometimes  you may not want a full blown class to parse something just for this one program. Some methods
       are provided to make that task easier.

   <b>new</b>
       The basic constructor. It takes no arguments, merely returns a new "DateTime::Format::Builder" object.

           my $parser = DateTime::Format::Builder-&gt;new;

       If called as a method on an object (rather than as a class method), then it clones the object.

           my $clone = $parser-&gt;new;

   <b>clone</b>
       Provided for those who prefer an explicit "clone" method rather than using "new" as an object method.

           my $clone_of_clone = $clone-&gt;clone;

   <b>parser</b>
       Given either a single or multiple parser specification, sets the object to have a parser  based  on  that
       specification.

           $parser-&gt;parser(
               regex  =&gt; qr/^ (\d{4}) (\d\d) (\d\d) $/x;
               params =&gt; [qw( year    month  day    )],
           );

       The arguments given to "parser" are handed directly to "create_parser". The resultant parser is passed to
       "set_parser".

       If called as an object method, it returns the object.

       If called as a class method, it creates a new object, sets its parser and returns that object.

   <b>set_parser</b>
       Sets the parser of the object to the given parser.

           $parser-&gt;set_parser($coderef);

       Note:  this method does not take specifications. It also does not take anything except coderefs. Luckily,
       coderefs are what most of the other methods produce.

       The method return value is the object itself.

   <b>get_parser</b>
       Returns the parser the object is using.

           my $code = $parser-&gt;get_parser;

   <b>parse_datetime</b>
       Given a string, it calls the parser and returns the "DateTime" object that results.

           my $dt = $parser-&gt;parse_datetime('1979 07 16');

       The return value, if not a "DateTime" object, is whatever the parser  wants  to  return.  Generally  this
       means that if the parse failed an error will be thrown.

   <b>format_datetime</b>
       If you call this function, it will throw an error.

</pre><h4><b>LONGER</b> <b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Some  longer  examples  are  provided  in  the  distribution.  These implement some of the common parsing
       DateTime modules using Builder. Each of them are, or were, drop in replacements for the  modules  at  the
       time of writing them.

</pre><h4><b>THANKS</b></h4><pre>
       Dave  Rolsky  (DROLSKY)  for  kickstarting  the  DateTime  project,  writing  DateTime::Format::ICal  and
       DateTime::Format::MySQL, and some much needed review.

       Joshua Hoblitt (JHOBLITT) for the concept, some of the API, impetus for  writing  the  multi-length  code
       (both  one  length  with  multiple  parsers and single parser with multiple lengths), blame for the Regex
       custom constructor code, spotting a bug in Dispatch, and more much needed review.

       Kellan Elliott-McCrea (KELLAN) for  even  more  review,  suggestions,  DateTime::Format::W3CDTF  and  the
       encouragement to rewrite these docs almost 100%!

       Claus  Färber  (CFAERBER)  for having me get around to fixing the auto-constructor writing, providing the
       'args'/'self' patch, and suggesting the multi-callbacks.

       Rick Measham (RICKM) for DateTime::Format::Strptime which Builder now supports.

       Matthew McGillis for pointing out that "on_fail" overriding should be simpler.

       Simon Cozens (SIMON) for saying it was cool.

       Bugs may be submitted at &lt;https://github.com/houseabsolute/DateTime-Format-Builder/issues&gt;.

       I am also usually active on IRC as 'autarch' on "irc://irc.perl.org".

</pre><h4><b>SOURCE</b></h4><pre>
       The    source     code     repository     for     DateTime-Format-Builder     can     be     found     at

</pre><h4><b>DONATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       If  you'd  like to thank me for the work I've done on this module, please consider making a "donation" to
       me via PayPal. I spend a lot of free time creating free software, and would appreciate any support  you'd
       care to offer.

       Please  note  that  <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> in order for me to continue working on this
       particular software. I will continue to do so, inasmuch as I  have  in  the  past,  for  as  long  as  it
       interests me.

       Similarly,  a donation made in this way will probably not make me work on this software much more, unless
       I get so many donations that I can consider working on free software full time (let's all have a  chuckle
       at that together).

       To   donate,   log   into   PayPal   and   send   money   to  <a href="mailto:autarch@urth.org">autarch@urth.org</a>,  or  use  the  button  at
       &lt;https://www.urth.org/fs-donation.html&gt;.
