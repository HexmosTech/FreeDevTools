</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       DateTime::Event::Recurrence - DateTime::Set extension for create basic recurrence sets

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        use DateTime;
        use DateTime::Event::Recurrence;

        my $dt = DateTime-&gt;new( year   =&gt; 2000,
                                month  =&gt; 6,
                                day    =&gt; 20,
                              );

        my $daily_set = DateTime::Event::Recurrence-&gt;daily;

        my $dt_next = $daily_set-&gt;next( $dt );

        my $dt_previous = $daily_set-&gt;previous( $dt );

        my $bool = $daily_set-&gt;contains( $dt );

        my @days = $daily_set-&gt;as_list( start =&gt; $dt1, end =&gt; $dt2 );

        my $iter = $daily_set-&gt;iterator;

        while ( my $dt = $iter-&gt;next ) {
            print ' ', $dt-&gt;datetime;
        }

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module provides convenience methods that let you easily create "DateTime::Set" objects for various
       recurrences, such as "once a month" or "every day".  You can also create more complicated recurrences,
       such as "every Monday, Wednesday and Thursday at 10:00 AM and 2:00 PM".

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       â€¢   yearly monthly weekly daily hourly minutely secondly

           These methods all return a new "DateTime::Set" object representing the given recurrence.

             my $daily_set = DateTime::Event::Recurrence-&gt;daily;

           If  no  parameters  are  given,  then  the  set  members each occur at the <u>beginning</u> of the specified
           recurrence.

           For example, by default, the "monthly()" method returns a set containing the first day of each month.

           Without parameters, the "weekly()" method returns a set containing <u>Mondays</u>.

           However, you can pass in parameters to alter where these datetimes fall.  The parameters are the same
           as those given to the "DateTime::Duration" constructor for specifying the length of a duration.   For
           example, to create a set representing a daily recurrence at 10:30 each day, we write this:

             my $daily_at_10_30_set =
                 DateTime::Event::Recurrence-&gt;daily( hours =&gt; 10, minutes =&gt; 30 );

           To represent every <u>Tuesday</u> (second day of the week):

             my $weekly_on_tuesday_set =
                 DateTime::Event::Recurrence-&gt;weekly( days =&gt; 2 );

           A  negative duration counts backwards from the end of the period.  This is done in the same manner as
           is specified in RFC 2445 (iCal).

           Negative durations are useful for creating recurrences such as the <u>last</u> <u>day</u> <u>of</u> <u>each</u> <u>month</u>:

             my $last_day_of_month_set =
                 DateTime::Event::Recurrence-&gt;monthly( days =&gt; -1 );

           You can also provide multiple sets of duration arguments, such as this:

               my $set = DateTime::Event::Recurrence-&gt;daily
                             ( hours =&gt;   [ 10, 14,  -1 ],
                               minutes =&gt; [ 15, 30, -15 ],
                             );

           This specifies a recurrence occurring every day at these 9 different times:

             10:15,  10:30,  10:45,   # +10h         ( +15min / +30min / last 15min (-15) )
             14:15,  14:30,  14:45,   # +14h         ( +15min / +30min / last 15min (-15) )
             23:15,  23:30,  23:45,   # last 1h (-1) ( +15min / +30min / last 15min (-15) )

           To create a set of recurrences occurring every thirty seconds, we could do this:

               my $every_30_seconds_set =
                   DateTime::Event::Recurrence-&gt;minutely( seconds =&gt; [ 0, 30 ] );

           The following is also valid. See the section on the "interval" parameter:

               my $every_30_seconds_set =
                   DateTime::Event::Recurrence-&gt;secondly( interval =&gt; 30 );

   <b>Invalid</b> <b>DateTimes</b>
       Invalid values are skipped at run time.

       For example, when days are added to a month, the result is checked for a nonexisting day (such as  31  or
       30), and the invalid datetimes are skipped.

       Another example of this would be creating a set via the "daily()" method and specifying "hours =&gt; 25".

   <b>The</b> <b>"days"</b> <b>Parameter</b>
       The  "days"  parameter  can  be  combined  with yearly, monthly, and weekly recurrences, resulting in six
       possible meanings:

           # tuesday of every week
           my $set = DateTime::Event::Recurrence-&gt;weekly( days =&gt; 2 );

           # 10th day of every month
           my $set = DateTime::Event::Recurrence-&gt;monthly( days =&gt; 10 );

           # second full week of every month, on tuesday
           my $set = DateTime::Event::Recurrence-&gt;monthly( weeks =&gt; 2, days =&gt; 2 );

           # 10th day of every year
           my $set = DateTime::Event::Recurrence-&gt;yearly( days =&gt; 10 );

           # 10th day of every december
           my $set = DateTime::Event::Recurrence-&gt;yearly( months =&gt; 12, days =&gt; 10 );

           # second week of every year, on tuesday
           my $set = DateTime::Event::Recurrence-&gt;yearly( weeks =&gt; 2, days =&gt; 2 );

       Week days can also be called by name, as is specified in RFC 2445 (iCal):

         my $weekly_on_tuesday_set =
             DateTime::Event::Recurrence-&gt;weekly( days =&gt; 'tu' );

       The "days" parameter defaults to  "the  first  day".   See  also  the  section  on  the  "week_start_day"
       parameter.

           # second full week of every month, on monday
           my $set = DateTime::Event::Recurrence-&gt;monthly( weeks =&gt; 2 );

           # second tuesday of every month
           my $set = DateTime::Event::Recurrence-&gt;monthly( weeks =&gt; 2, days =&gt; "tu", week_start_day =&gt; "1tu" );

   <b>The</b> <b>"interval"</b> <b>and</b> <b>"start"</b> <b>Parameters</b>
       The "interval" parameter represents how often the recurrence rule repeats.

       The optional "start" parameter specifies where to start counting:

           my $dt_start = DateTime-&gt;new( year =&gt; 2003, month =&gt; 6, day =&gt; 15 );

           my $set = DateTime::Event::Recurrence-&gt;daily
                         ( interval =&gt; 11,
                           hours    =&gt; 10,
                           minutes  =&gt; 30,
                           start    =&gt; $dt_start,
                         );

       This  specifies a recurrence that happens at 10:30 on the day specified by "start =&gt; $dt", and then every
       11 days <u>before</u> <u>and</u> <u>after</u> $dt.  So we get a set like this:

           ...
           2003-06-04T10:30:00,
           2003-06-15T10:30:00,
           2003-06-26T10:30:00,
           ...

       In this case, the method is used to specify the unit, so "daily()" means that our  unit  is  a  day,  and
       "interval =&gt; 11" specifies the quantity of our unit.

       The "start" parameter should have no time zone.

   <b>The</b> <b>"week_start_day"</b> <b>Parameter</b>
       The "week_start_day" represents how the 'first week' of a period is calculated:

       "mo",  "tu",  "we",  "th", "fr", "sa", "su" - The first week is one that starts on this week-day, and has
       <u>the</u> <u>most</u> <u>days</u> in this period.  Works for "weekly" and "yearly" recurrences.

       "1mo", "1tu", "1we", "1th", "1fr", "1sa", "1su" - The first week is one that starts on this week-day, and
       has <u>all</u> <u>days</u> in this period.  This works for "weekly()", "monthly()" and "yearly()" recurrences.

       The "week_start_day" defaults to "1mo", except in yearly ("yearly()") recurrences which default to "mo".

   <b>Time</b> <b>Zones</b>
       Recurrences are created in the 'floating' time zone, as specified in the "DateTime" module.

       If you want to specify a time zone for a recurrence, you can do this by calling "set_time_zone()" on  the
       returned set:

         my $daily = DateTime::Event::Recurrence-&gt;daily;
         $daily-&gt;set_time_zone( 'Europe/Berlin' );

       You can also pass a "DateTime.pm" object with a time zone to the set's "next()" and "previous()" methods:

         my $dt = DateTime-&gt;today( time_zone =&gt; 'Europe/Berlin' );
         my $next = $daily-&gt;next($dt);

       A  recurrence  can  be affected DST changes, so it would be possible to specify a recurrence that creates
       nonexistent datetimes.  Because "DateTime.pm" throws an exception  if  asked  to  create  a  non-existent
       datetime, please be careful when setting a time zone for your recurrence.

       It  might  be  preferable  to always use "UTC" for your sets, and then convert the returned object to the
       desired time zone.

   <b>Leap</b> <b>Seconds</b>
       There are no leap seconds, because the recurrences are created in the 'floating' time zone.

       The value 60 for seconds (the leap second) is ignored.  If you <u>really</u> want the leap second, then  specify
       the second as "-1".
