       methods

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>events</b> <b>[span]</b> <b>[period]</b>
       Provides a Data::ICal object with a method to return all events.

       If a DateTime::Set, DateTime::Span or DateTime::SpanSet object is passed then only the events that occur
       within that set will be returned including expansion of all recurring events. All events will be
       normalised to have a dtstart and dtend rather than any other method of determining their start and stop
       time.

       Additionally you can pass a period string which can be one of the following

           year month week day hour minute second

       This will explode an event into as many sub events as needed e.g a period of 'day' will explode a 2-day
       event into 2 one day events with the second starting just after the first

   <b>collapse</b> <b>&lt;events&gt;</b>
       Provides a Data::ICal object with a method to collapse "recurrence-id"s.

       Given a list of events, some of which might have "recurrence-id"s, return a list of events with all
       recurrences within "span" and all "recurrence-id"s handled correctly.

       Used internally by "events".

   <b>start</b> <b>[new]</b>
       Returns a DateTime object representing the start time of this event.

       May return undef.

       If passed a DateTime object will set that to be the new start time.

   <b>end</b>
       Returns a DateTime object representing the end time of this event.

       May return undef.

       If passed a DateTime object will set that to be the new end time.

   <b>all_day</b>
       Returns 1 if event is all day or 0 if not.

       If no end has been set and 1 is passed then will set end to be a nanosecond before midnight the next day.

       The have multi-day all-day events simply set the end time to be nanosecond before midnight on the last
       day of the event.

   <b>floating</b>
       An event is considered floating if it has a start but no end. It is intended to represent an event that
       is associated with a given calendar date and time of day, such as an anniversary and should not be
       considered as taking up any amount of time.

       Returns 1 if the evnt is floating and 0 if it isn't.

       If passed a 1 then will set the event to be floating by deleting the end time.

       If passed a 0 and no end is currently set then it will set end to be a nanosecond before midnight the
       next day.

   <b>duration</b>
       Returns a DateTime::Duration object representing the duration of this event.

       May return undef.

       If passed a DateTime::Duration object will set that to be the new duration.

   <b>period</b>
       Returns a DateTime::Span object representing the period of this event.

       May return undef.

       If passed a DateTime::Span object will set that to be the new period.

   <b>recurrence</b>
       Returns a DateTime::Set object representing the union of all the "RRULE"s in this object.

       May return undef.

       If passed one or more DateTime lists, DateTime::Span lists, DateTime::Sets, or DateTime::SpanSets then
       set the recurrence rules to be those.

   <b>rdate</b>
       Returns a DateTime::Set object representing the set of all "RDATE"s in the object.

       May return undef.

   <b>exrule</b>
       Returns a DateTime::Set object representing the union of all the "EXRULE"s in this object.

       May return undef.

       If passed one or more DateTime lists, DateTime::Span lists, DateTime::Sets, or DateTime::SpanSets then
       set the recurrence exclusion rules to be those.

   <b>exdate</b>
       Returns a DateTime::Set object representing the set of all "RDATE"s in the object.

       May return undef.

   <b>recurrence_id</b>
       Returns a DateTime object representing the recurrence-id of this event.

       May return undef.

       If passed a DateTime object will set that to be the new recurrence-id.

   <b>uid</b>
       Returns the uid of this event.

       If passed a new value then sets that to be the new uid value.

   <b>summary</b>
       Returns a string representing the summary of this event.

       May return undef.

       If passed a new value then sets that to be the new summary (and will escape all relevant characters).

   <b>description</b>
       Returns a string representing the description of this event.

       May return undef.

       If passed a new value then sets that to be the new description (and will escape all relevant characters).

   <b>url</b>
       Returns a string representing the url of this event.

       May return undef.

       If passed a new value then sets that to be the new description (and will escape all relevant characters).

   <b>explode</b> <b>&lt;span&gt;</b> <b>[period]</b>
       Takes DateTime::Set, DateTime::Span or DateTime::SpanSet and returns an array of events.

       If this is not a recurring event, and it falls with the span, then it will return one event with the
       dtstart and dtend properties set and no other time information.

       If this is a recurring event then it will return all times that this recurs within the span. All returned
       events will have the dtstart and dtend properties set and no other time information.

       If "period" is optionally passed then events longer than "period" will be exploded into multiple events.

       "period" can be any of the following

           year month week day hour minute second

   <b>original</b> <b>&lt;event&gt;</b>
       Store or fetch a reference to the original event this was derived from.

   <b>split_up</b> <b>&lt;period&gt;</b>
       Split an n-period event into n 1-period events.

   <b>is_in</b> <b>&lt;span&gt;</b>
       Takes DateTime::Set, DateTime::Span or DateTime::SpanSet and returns whether this event can fall within
       that time frame.
