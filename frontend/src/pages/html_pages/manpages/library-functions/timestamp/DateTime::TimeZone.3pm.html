</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       DateTime::TimeZone - Time zone object base class and factory

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 2.65

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use DateTime;
         use DateTime::TimeZone;

         my $tz = DateTime::TimeZone-&gt;new( name =&gt; 'America/Chicago' );

         my $dt = DateTime-&gt;now();
         my $offset = $tz-&gt;offset_for_datetime($dt);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This class is the base class for all time zone objects.  A time zone is represented internally as a set
       of observances, each of which describes the offset from GMT for a given time period.

       Note that without the DateTime module, this module does not do much.  It's primary interface is through a
       DateTime object, and most users will not need to directly use "DateTime::TimeZone" methods.

   <b>Special</b> <b>Case</b> <b>Platforms</b>
       If you are on the Win32 platform, you will want to also install DateTime::TimeZone::Local::Win32. This
       will enable you to specify a time zone of 'local' when creating a DateTime object.

       If you are on HPUX, install DateTime::TimeZone::HPUX. This provides support for HPUX style time zones
       like 'MET-1METDST'.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       This class has the following methods:

   <b>DateTime::TimeZone-&gt;new(</b> <b>name</b> <b>=&gt;</b> <b>$tz_name</b> <b>)</b>
       Given a valid time zone name, this method returns a new time zone blessed into the appropriate subclass.
       Subclasses are named for the given time zone, so that the time zone "America/Chicago" is the
       DateTime::TimeZone::America::Chicago class.

       If the name given is a "link" name in the Olson database, the object created may have a different name.
       For example, there is a link from the old "EST5EDT" name to "America/New_York".

       When loading a time zone from the Olson database, the constructor checks the version of the loaded class
       to make sure it matches the version of the current DateTime::TimeZone installation. If they do not match
       it will issue a warning.  This is useful because time zone names may fall out of use, but you may have an
       old module file installed for that time zone.

       There are also several special values that can be given as names.

       If the "name" parameter is "floating", then a "DateTime::TimeZone::Floating" object is returned.  A
       floating time zone does not have <u>any</u> offset, and is always the same time.  This is useful for calendaring
       applications, which may need to specify that a given event happens at the same <u>local</u> time, regardless of
       where it occurs. See RFC 2445 &lt;https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2445.txt&gt; for more details.

       If the "name" parameter is "UTC", then a "DateTime::TimeZone::UTC" object is returned.

       If the "name" is an offset string, it is converted to a number, and a "DateTime::TimeZone::OffsetOnly"
       object is returned.

       <u>The</u> <u>"local"</u> <u>time</u> <u>zone</u>

       If the "name" parameter is "local", then the module attempts to determine the local time zone for the
       system.

       The method for finding the local zone varies by operating system. See the appropriate module for details
       of how we check for the local time zone.

       •   DateTime::TimeZone::Local::Unix

       •   DateTime::TimeZone::Local::Android

       •   DateTime::TimeZone::Local::hpux

       •   DateTime::TimeZone::Local::Win32

       •   DateTime::TimeZone::Local::VMS

       If a local time zone is not found, then an exception will be thrown. This exception will always stringify
       to something containing the text "Cannot determine local time zone".

       If you are writing code for users to run on systems you do not control, you should try to account for the
       possibility that this exception may be thrown.  Falling back to UTC might be a reasonable alternative.

       When  writing tests for your modules that might be run on others' systems, you are strongly encouraged to
       either not use "local" when creating DateTime objects or to set $ENV{TZ} to a known value  in  your  test
       code. All of the per-OS classes check this environment variable.

   <b>$tz-&gt;offset_for_datetime(</b> <b>$dt</b> <b>)</b>
       Given  a "DateTime" object, this method returns the offset in seconds for the given datetime.  This takes
       into account historical time zone information, as well as Daylight Saving Time.  The offset is determined
       by looking at the object's UTC Rata Die days and seconds.

   <b>$tz-&gt;offset_for_local_datetime(</b> <b>$dt</b> <b>)</b>
       Given a "DateTime" object, this method returns the offset in seconds for the given datetime.  Unlike  the
       previous  method,  this method uses the local time's Rata Die days and seconds.  This should only be done
       when the corresponding UTC time is not yet known, because local times can be ambiguous  due  to  Daylight
       Saving Time rules.

   <b>$tz-&gt;is_dst_for_datetime(</b> <b>$dt</b> <b>)</b>
       Given a "DateTime" object, this method returns true if the DateTime is currently in Daylight Saving Time.

   <b>$tz-&gt;name</b>
       Returns the name of the time zone.

   <b>$tz-&gt;short_name_for_datetime(</b> <b>$dt</b> <b>)</b>
       Given  a "DateTime" object, this method returns the "short name" for the current observance and rule this
       datetime is in.  These are names like "EST", "GMT", etc.

       It is <b>strongly</b> recommended that you do not rely on these names for anything other  than  display.   These
       names  are  not  official,  and  many of them are simply the invention of the Olson database maintainers.
       Moreover, these names are not unique.  For example, there is an "EST" at both -0500 and +1000/+1100.

   <b>$tz-&gt;is_floating</b>
       Returns a boolean indicating whether or not this object represents a floating time zone,  as  defined  by
       RFC 2445 &lt;https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2445.txt&gt;.

   <b>$tz-&gt;is_utc</b>
       Indicates whether or not this object represents the UTC (GMT) time zone.

   <b>$tz-&gt;has_dst_changes</b>
       Indicates whether or not this zone has <u>ever</u> had a change to and from DST, either in the past or future.

   <b>$tz-&gt;is_olson</b>
       Returns true if the time zone is a named time zone from the Olson database.

   <b>$tz-&gt;category</b>
       Returns  the  part of the time zone name before the first slash.  For example, the "America/Chicago" time
       zone would return "America".

   <b>DateTime::TimeZone-&gt;is_valid_name($name)</b>
       Given a string, this method returns a boolean value indicating whether or not the string is a valid  time
       zone name.  If you are using "DateTime::TimeZone::Alias", any aliases you've created will be valid.

   <b>DateTime::TimeZone-&gt;all_names</b>
       This  returns  a  pre-sorted list of all the time zone names.  This list does not include link names.  In
       scalar context, it returns an array reference, while in list context it returns an array.

   <b>DateTime::TimeZone-&gt;categories</b>
       This returns a list of all time zone categories.  In scalar context, it returns an array reference, while
       in list context it returns an array.

   <b>DateTime::TimeZone-&gt;links</b>
       This returns a hash of all time zone links, where the keys are the old, deprecated names, and the  values
       are  the  new  names.  In scalar context, it returns a hash reference, while in list context it returns a
       hash.

   <b>DateTime::TimeZone-&gt;names_in_category(</b> <b>$category</b> <b>)</b>
       Given a valid category, this method returns a list of the names in that category,  without  the  category
       portion.    So   the   list   for   the   "America"   category   would  include  the  strings  "Chicago",
       "Kentucky/Monticello", and "New_York". In scalar context, it returns an array reference,  while  in  list
       context it returns an array.

   <b>DateTime::TimeZone-&gt;countries()</b>
       Returns  a  sorted  list  of  all  the  valid  country  codes  (in  lower-case)  which  can  be passed to
       names_in_country(). In scalar context, it returns an array reference, while in list context it returns an
       array.

       If you need to convert country codes to names or vice versa you can use "Locale::Country" to do so.  Note
       that  one  of the codes returned is "uk", which is an alias for the country code "gb", and is not a valid
       ISO country code.

   <b>DateTime::TimeZone-&gt;names_in_country(</b> <b>$country_code</b> <b>)</b>
       Given a two-letter ISO3166 country code, this method returns a list of time zones used in  that  country.
       The  country  code  may  be  of any case. In scalar context, it returns an array reference, while in list
       context it returns an array.

       This list is returned in an order vaguely based on geography and population. In general, the  least  used
       zones  come  last,  but  there  are not guarantees of a specific order from one release to the next. This
       order is probably the best option for presenting zones names to end users.

   <b>DateTime::TimeZone-&gt;offset_as_seconds(</b> <b>$offset</b> <b>)</b>
       Given an offset as a string, this returns the number of seconds represented by the offset as  a  positive
       or negative number.  Returns "undef" if $offset is not in the range "-99:59:59" to "+99:59:59".

       The    offset    is    expected    to    match    either   "/^([\+\-])?(\d\d?):(\d\d)(?::(\d\d))?$/"   or
       "/^([\+\-])?(\d\d)(\d\d)(\d\d)?$/".  If it doesn't match either of these, "undef" will be returned.

       This means that if you want to specify hours as a single digit, then each element of the offset  must  be
       separated by a colon (:).

   <b>DateTime::TimeZone-&gt;offset_as_string(</b> <b>$offset,</b> <b>$sep</b> <b>)</b>
       Given  an  offset  as a number, this returns the offset as a string. Returns "undef" if $offset is not in
       the range -359999 to 359999.

       You can also provide an optional separator which will go between the  hours,  minutes,  and  seconds  (if
       applicable) portions of the offset.

   <b>Storable</b> <b>Hooks</b>
       This module provides freeze and thaw hooks for "Storable" so that the huge data structures for Olson time
       zones are not actually stored in the serialized structure.

       If  you subclass "DateTime::TimeZone", you will inherit its hooks, which may not work for your module, so
       please test the interaction of your module with Storable.

</pre><h4><b>LOADING</b> <b>TIME</b> <b>ZONES</b> <b>IN</b> <b>A</b> <b>PRE-FORKING</b> <b>SYSTEM</b></h4><pre>
       If you are running an application that does pre-forking (for example with Starman), then you  should  try
       to  load  all  the time zones that you'll need in the parent process. Time zones are loaded on-demand, so
       loading them once in each child will waste memory that could otherwise be shared.

</pre><h4><b>CREDITS</b></h4><pre>
       This module was inspired by Jesse Vincent's work on Date::ICal::Timezone, and written with much help from
       the <a href="mailto:datetime@perl.org">datetime@perl.org</a> list.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       <a href="mailto:datetime@perl.org">datetime@perl.org</a> mailing list

       The tools directory of the DateTime::TimeZone distribution includes two scripts that may be  of  interest
       to  some people.  They are parse_olson and tests_from_zdump.  Please run them with the --help flag to see
       what they can be used for.

       care to offer.

       Please  note  that  <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> in order for me to continue working on this

       Similarly,  a donation made in this way will probably not make me work on this software much more, unless
       I get so many donations that I can consider working on free software full time (let's all have a  chuckle
       at that together).

       To   donate,   log   into   PayPal   and   send   money   to  <a href="mailto:autarch@urth.org">autarch@urth.org</a>,  or  use  the  button  at
