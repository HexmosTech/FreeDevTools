</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       DateTime is a class for the representation of date/time combinations, and is part of the Perl DateTime
       project.

       It represents the Gregorian calendar, extended backwards in time before its creation (in 1582). This is
       sometimes known as the "proleptic Gregorian calendar". In this calendar, the first day of the calendar
       (the epoch), is the first day of year 1, which corresponds to the date which was (incorrectly) believed
       to be the birth of Jesus Christ.

       The calendar represented does have a year 0, and in that way differs from how dates are often written
       using "BCE/CE" or "BC/AD".

       For infinite datetimes, please see the DateTime::Infinite module.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
   <b>0-based</b> <b>Versus</b> <b>1-based</b> <b>Numbers</b>
       The "DateTime" module follows a simple logic for determining whether or not a given number is 0-based or
       1-based.

       Month, day of month, day of week, and day of year are 1-based. Any method that is 1-based also has an
       equivalent 0-based method ending in "_0". So for example, this class provides both "day_of_week" and
       "day_of_week_0" methods.

       The "day_of_week_0" method still treats Monday as the first day of the week.

       All <u>time</u>-related numbers such as hour, minute, and second are 0-based.

       Years are neither, as they can be both positive or negative, unlike any other datetime component. There
       <u>is</u> a year 0.

       There is no "quarter_0" method.

   <b>Error</b> <b>Handling</b>
       Some errors may cause this module to die with an error string. This can only happen when calling
       constructor methods, methods that change the object, such as "set", or methods that take parameters.
       Methods that retrieve information about the object, such as "year" or "epoch", will never die.

   <b>Locales</b>
       All the object methods which return names or abbreviations return data based on a locale. This is done by
       setting the locale when constructing a DateTime object. If this is not set, then "en-US" is used.

   <b>Floating</b> <b>DateTimes</b>
       The default time zone for new DateTime objects, except where stated otherwise, is the "floating" time
       zone. This concept comes from the iCal standard. A floating datetime is one which is not anchored to any
       particular time zone. In addition, floating datetimes do not include leap seconds, since we cannot apply
       them without knowing the datetime's time zone.

       The results of date math and comparison between a floating datetime and one with a real time zone are not
       really valid, because one includes leap seconds and the other does not. Similarly, the results of
       datetime math between two floating datetimes and two datetimes with time zones are not really comparable.

       If you are planning to use any objects with a real time zone, it is strongly recommended that you <b>do</b> <b>not</b>
       mix these with floating datetimes.

   <b>Math</b>
       If you are going to be doing date math, please read the section "How DateTime Math Works".

   <b>Determining</b> <b>the</b> <b>Local</b> <b>Time</b> <b>Zone</b> <b>Can</b> <b>Be</b> <b>Slow</b>
       If $ENV{TZ} is not set, it may involve reading a number of files in <u><a href="file:/etc">/etc</a></u> or elsewhere. If you know that
       the local time zone won't change while your code is running, and you need to make many objects for the
       local time zone, it is strongly recommended that you retrieve the local time zone once and cache it:

           my $local_time_zone = DateTime::TimeZone-&gt;new( name =&gt; 'local' );

           # then everywhere else

           my $dt = DateTime-&gt;new( ..., time_zone =&gt; $local_time_zone );

       DateTime itself does not do this internally because local time zones can change, and there's no good way
       to determine if it's changed without doing all the work to look it up.

   <b>Far</b> <b>Future</b> <b>DST</b>
       Do not try to use named time zones (like "America/Chicago") with dates very far in the future (thousands
       of years). The current implementation of "DateTime::TimeZone" will use a huge amount of memory
       calculating all the DST changes from now until the future date. Use UTC or the floating time zone and you
       will be safe.

   <b>Globally</b> <b>Setting</b> <b>a</b> <b>Default</b> <b>Time</b> <b>Zone</b>
       <b>Warning:</b> <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>dangerous.</b> <b>Do</b> <b>this</b> <b>at</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>risk!</b>

       By default, "DateTime" uses either the floating time zone or UTC for newly created objects, depending on
       the constructor.

       You can force "DateTime" to use a different time zone by setting the "PERL_DATETIME_DEFAULT_TZ"
       environment variable.

       As noted above, this is very dangerous, as it affects all code that creates a "DateTime" object,
       including modules from CPAN. If those modules expect the normal default, then setting this can cause
       confusing breakage or subtly broken data. Before setting this variable, you are strongly encouraged to
       audit your CPAN dependencies to see how they use "DateTime". Try running the test suite for each
       dependency with this environment variable set before using this in production.

   <b>Upper</b> <b>and</b> <b>Lower</b> <b>Bounds</b>
       Internally, dates are represented the number of days before or after 0001-01-01. This is stored as an
       integer, meaning that the upper and lower bounds are based on your Perl's integer size ($Config{ivsize}).

       The limit on 32-bit systems is around 2^29 days, which gets you to year (+/-)1,469,903. On a 64-bit
       system you get 2^62 days, to year (+/-)12,626,367,463,883,278 (12.626 quadrillion).

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       DateTime provides many methods. The documentation breaks them down into groups based on what they do
       (constructor, accessors, modifiers, etc.).

   <b>Constructors</b>
       All constructors can die when invalid parameters are given.

       <u>Warnings</u>

       Currently, constructors will warn if you try to create a far future DateTime (year &gt;= 5000) with any time
       zone besides floating or UTC. This can be very slow if the time zone has future DST transitions that need
       to be calculated. If the date is sufficiently far in the future this can be <u>really</u> slow (minutes).

       All warnings from DateTime use the "DateTime" category and can be suppressed with:

           no warnings 'DateTime';

       This warning may be removed in the future if DateTime::TimeZone is made much faster.

       <u>DateTime-&gt;new(</u> <u>...</u> <u>)</u>

           my $dt = DateTime-&gt;new(
               year       =&gt; 1966,
               month      =&gt; 10,
               day        =&gt; 25,
               hour       =&gt; 7,
               minute     =&gt; 15,
               second     =&gt; 47,
               nanosecond =&gt; 500000000,
               time_zone  =&gt; 'America/Chicago',
           );

       This class method accepts the following parameters:

       •   year

           An  integer  year  for  the  DateTime. This can be any integer number within the valid range for your
           system (See "Upper and Lower Bounds"). This is required.

       •   month

           An integer from 1-12. Defaults to 1.

       •   day

           An integer from 1-31. The value will be validated based on the month,  to  prevent  creating  invalid
           dates like February 30. Defaults to 1.

       •   hour

           An integer from 0-23. Hour 0 is midnight at the beginning of the given date.  Defaults to 0.

       •   minute

           An integer from 0-59. Defaults to 0.

       •   second

           An  integer  from  0-61.  Values of 60 or 61 are only allowed when the specified date and time have a
           leap second. Defaults to 0.

       •   nanosecond

           An integer that is greater than or equal to 0. If this number is greater than 1 billion, it  will  be
           normalized into the second value for the DateTime object.  Defaults to 0

       •   locale

           A  string  containing  a  locale  code,  like  "en-US"  or  "zh-Hant-TW",  or  an  object returned by
           "DateTime::Locale-&gt;load". See the DateTime::Locale documentation for details. Defaults to  the  value
           of "DateTime-&gt;DefaultLocale", or "en-US" if the class default has not been set.

       •   time_zone

           A  string containing a time zone name like "America/Chicago" or a DateTime::TimeZone object. Defaults
           to the value of $ENV{PERL_DATETIME_DEFAULT_TZ} or  "floating"  if  that  env  var  is  not  set.  See
           "Globally  Setting  a Default Time Zone" for more details on that env var (and why you should not use
           it).

           A string will simply be passed to the "DateTime::TimeZone-&gt;new" method as its "name" parameter.  This
           string  may  be  an  Olson  DB time zone name ("America/Chicago"), an offset string ("+0630"), or the
           words "floating" or "local". See the "DateTime::TimeZone" documentation for more details.

       •   formatter

           An object or class name with a "format_datetime" method. This will be used to stringify the  DateTime
           object. This is optional. If it is not specified, then stringification calls "$self-&gt;iso8601".

       Invalid parameter types (like an array reference) will cause the constructor to die.

       Parsing Dates

       <b>This</b>  <b>module</b>  <b>does</b>  <b>not</b> <b>parse</b> <b>dates!</b> That means there is no constructor to which you can pass things like
       "March 3, 1970 12:34".

       Instead,        take        a        look        at        the        various         DateTime::Format::*
       &lt;https://metacpan.org/search?q=datetime%3A%3Aformat&gt;  modules on CPAN. These parse all sorts of different
       date formats, and you're bound to find something that can handle your particular needs.

       Ambiguous Local Times

       Because of Daylight Saving Time, it is possible to specify a local time that is ambiguous.  For  example,
       in  the  US  in  2003, the transition from to saving to standard time occurred on October 26, at 02:00:00
       local time. The local clock changed from 01:59:59 (saving time) to 01:00:00 (standard time).  This  means
       that the hour from 01:00:00 through 01:59:59 actually occurs twice, though the UTC time continues to move
       forward.

       If  you  specify  an  ambiguous  time, then the latest UTC time is always used, in effect always choosing
       standard time. In this case, you can simply subtract an hour from the object in order to move  to  saving
       time, for example:

           # This object represent 01:30:00 standard time
           my $dt = DateTime-&gt;new(
               year      =&gt; 2003,
               month     =&gt; 10,
               day       =&gt; 26,
               hour      =&gt; 1,
               minute    =&gt; 30,
               second    =&gt; 0,
               time_zone =&gt; 'America/Chicago',
           );

           print $dt-&gt;hms;    # prints 01:30:00

           # Now the object represent 01:30:00 saving time
           $dt-&gt;subtract( hours =&gt; 1 );

           print $dt-&gt;hms;    # still prints 01:30:00

       Alternately,  you could create the object with the UTC time zone and then call the "set_time_zone" method
       to change the time zone. This is a good way to ensure that the time is not ambiguous.

       Invalid Local Times

       Another problem introduced by Daylight Saving Time is that certain local times just  do  not  exist.  For
       example,  in  the  US  in  2003,  the transition from standard to saving time occurred on April 6, at the
       change to 2:00:00 local time. The local clock changed from 01:59:59 (standard time) to  03:00:00  (saving
       time).  This means that there is no 02:00:00 through 02:59:59 on April 6!

       Attempting to create an invalid time currently causes a fatal error.

       <u>DateTime-&gt;from_epoch(</u> <u>epoch</u> <u>=&gt;</u> <u>$epoch,</u> <u>...</u> <u>)</u>

       This  class  method  can  be  used  to  construct  a  new  DateTime  object from an epoch time instead of
       components. Just as with the "new" method, it accepts "time_zone", "locale", and "formatter" parameters.

       You can also call it with a single unnamed argument, which will be treated as the epoch value.

       If the epoch value is a non-integral value, it will be rounded to nearest microsecond.

       By default, the returned object will be in the UTC time zone.

       If you pass a "time_zone", then this time zone will be applied <u>after</u> the object is constructed. In  other
       words, the epoch value is always interpreted as being in the UTC time zone. Here's an example:

           my $dt = DateTime-&gt;from_epoch(
               epoch     =&gt; 0,
               time_zone =&gt; 'Asia/Tokyo'
           );
           say $dt; # Prints 1970-01-01T09:00:00 as Asia/Tokyo is +09:00 from UTC.
           $dt-&gt;set_time_zone('UTC');
           say $dt; # Prints 1970-01-01T00:00:00

       <u>DateTime-&gt;now(</u> <u>...</u> <u>)</u>

       This  class  method  is  equivalent  to  calling  "from_epoch" with the value returned from Perl's "time"
       function. Just as with the "new" method, it accepts "time_zone" and "locale" parameters.

       By default, the returned object will be in the UTC time zone.

       If you want  sub-second  resolution,  use  the  DateTime::HiRes  module's  "DateTime::HiRes-&gt;now"  method
       instead.

       <u>DateTime-&gt;today(</u> <u>...</u> <u>)</u>

       This class method is equivalent to:

           DateTime-&gt;now(@_)-&gt;truncate( to =&gt; 'day' );

       <u>DateTime-&gt;last_day_of_month(</u> <u>...</u> <u>)</u>

       This  constructor  takes  the  same  arguments  as  can  be  given to the "new" method, except for "day".
       Additionally, both "year" and "month" are required.

       <u>DateTime-&gt;from_day_of_year(</u> <u>...</u> <u>)</u>

       This constructor takes the same arguments as can be given to the "new" method, except that  it  does  not
       accept  a  "month" or "day" argument. Instead, it requires both "year" and "day_of_year". The day of year
       must be between 1 and 366, and 366 is only allowed for leap years.

       <u>DateTime-&gt;from_object(</u> <u>object</u> <u>=&gt;</u> <u>$object,</u> <u>...</u> <u>)</u>

       This class method can be used to construct a new DateTime object from  any  object  that  implements  the
       "utc_rd_values"  method.  All "DateTime::Calendar" modules must implement this method in order to provide
       cross-calendar compatibility. This method accepts a "locale" and "formatter" parameter

       If the object passed to this method has a "time_zone" method, that is used to set the time  zone  of  the
       newly created "DateTime" object.

       Otherwise, the returned object will be in the floating time zone.

       <u>$dt-&gt;clone</u>

       This object method returns a new object that is replica of the object upon which the method is called.

   <b>"Get"</b> <b>Methods</b>
       This class has many methods for retrieving information about an object.

       <u>$dt-&gt;year</u>

       Returns the year.

       <u>$dt-&gt;ce_year</u>

       Returns  the year according to the BCE/CE numbering system. The year before year 1 in this system is year
       -1, aka "1 BCE".

       <u>$dt-&gt;era_name</u>

       Returns the long name of the current era, something like "Before Christ". See the "Locales"  section  for
       more details.

       <u>$dt-&gt;era_abbr</u>

       Returns  the abbreviated name of the current era, something like "BC". See the "Locales" section for more
       details.

       <u>$dt-&gt;christian_era</u>

       Returns a string, either "BC" or "AD", according to the year.

       <u>$dt-&gt;secular_era</u>

       Returns a string, either "BCE" or "CE", according to the year.

       <u>$dt-&gt;year_with_era</u>

       Returns a string containing the year immediately followed by the appropriate era abbreviation,  based  on
       the  object's  locale.  The  year is the absolute value of "ce_year", so that year 1 is "1" and year 0 is
       "1BC". See the "Locales" section for more details.

       <u>$dt-&gt;year_with_christian_era</u>

       Like "year_with_era", but uses the "christian_era" method to get the era name.

       <u>$dt-&gt;year_with_secular_era</u>

       Like "year_with_era", but uses the "secular_era" method to get the era name.

       <u>$dt-&gt;month</u>

       Returns the month of the year, from 1..12.

       Also available as "$dt-&gt;mon".

       <u>$dt-&gt;month_name</u>

       Returns the name of the current month. See the "Locales" section for more details.

       <u>$dt-&gt;month_abbr</u>

       Returns the abbreviated name of the current month. See the "Locales" section for more details.

       <u>$dt-&gt;day</u>

       Returns the day of the month, from 1..31.

       Also available as "$dt-&gt;mday" and "$dt-&gt;day_of_month".

       <u>$dt-&gt;day_of_week</u>

       Returns the day of the week as a number, from 1..7, with 1 being Monday and 7 being Sunday.

       Also available as "$dt-&gt;wday" and "$dt-&gt;dow".

       <u>$dt-&gt;local_day_of_week</u>

       Returns the day of the week as a number, from 1..7. The day corresponding to 1 will  vary  based  on  the
       locale. See the "Locales" section for more details.

       <u>$dt-&gt;day_name</u>

       Returns the name of the current day of the week. See the "Locales" section for more details.

       <u>$dt-&gt;day_abbr</u>

       Returns the abbreviated name of the current day of the week. See the "Locales" section for more details.

       <u>$dt-&gt;day_of_year</u>

       Returns the day of the year.

       Also available as "$dt-&gt;doy".

       <u>$dt-&gt;quarter</u>

       Returns the quarter of the year, from 1..4.

       <u>$dt-&gt;quarter_name</u>

       Returns the name of the current quarter. See the "Locales" section for more details.

       <u>$dt-&gt;quarter_abbr</u>

       Returns the abbreviated name of the current quarter. See the "Locales" section for more details.

       <u>$dt-&gt;day_of_quarter</u>

       Returns the day of the quarter.

       Also available as "$dt-&gt;doq".

       <u>$dt-&gt;weekday_of_month</u>

       Returns  a  number from 1..5 indicating which week day of the month this is. For example, June 9, 2003 is
       the second Monday of the month, and so this method returns 2 for that date.

       <u>$dt-&gt;ymd($optional_separator),</u> <u>$dt-&gt;mdy(...),</u> <u>$dt-&gt;dmy(...)</u>

       Each method returns the year, month, and day, in the order indicated by the method name. Years are  zero-
       padded to four digits. Months and days are 0-padded to two digits.

       By  default, the values are separated by a dash (-), but this can be overridden by passing a value to the
       method.

       The "$dt-&gt;ymd" method is also available as "$dt-&gt;date".

       <u>$dt-&gt;hour</u>

       Returns the hour of the day, from 0..23.

       <u>$dt-&gt;hour_1</u>

       Returns the hour of the day, from 1..24.

       <u>$dt-&gt;hour_12</u>

       Returns the hour of the day, from 1..12.

       <u>$dt-&gt;hour_12_0</u>

       Returns the hour of the day, from 0..11.

       <u>$dt-&gt;am_or_pm</u>

       Returns the appropriate localized abbreviation, depending on the current hour.

       <u>$dt-&gt;minute</u>

       Returns the minute of the hour, from 0..59.

       Also available as "$dt-&gt;min".

       <u>$dt-&gt;second</u>

       Returns the second, from 0..61. The values 60 and 61 are used for leap seconds.

       Also available as "$dt-&gt;sec".

       <u>$dt-&gt;fractional_second</u>

       Returns the second, as a real number from 0.0 until 61.999999999

       The values 60 and 61 are used for leap seconds.

       <u>$dt-&gt;millisecond</u>

       Returns the fractional part of the second as milliseconds (1E-3 seconds).

       Half a second is 500 milliseconds.

       This value will always be rounded down to the nearest integer.

       <u>$dt-&gt;microsecond</u>

       Returns the fractional part of the second as microseconds (1E-6 seconds).

       Half a second is 500,000 microseconds.

       This value will always be rounded down to the nearest integer.

       <u>$dt-&gt;nanosecond</u>

       Returns the fractional part of the second as nanoseconds (1E-9 seconds).

        Half a second is 500,000,000 nanoseconds.

       <u>$dt-&gt;hms($optional_separator)</u>

       Returns the hour, minute, and second, all zero-padded to two digits. If  no  separator  is  specified,  a
       colon (:) is used by default.

       Also available as "$dt-&gt;time".

       <u>$dt-&gt;datetime($optional_separator)</u>

       This method is equivalent to:

           $dt-&gt;ymd('-') . 'T' . $dt-&gt;hms(':')

       The  $optional_separator  parameter  allows  you to override the separator between the date and time, for
       e.g. "$dt-&gt;datetime(q{ })".

       This method is also available as "$dt-&gt;iso8601", but it's not really a very good ISO8601  format,  as  it
       lacks a time zone. If called as "$dt-&gt;iso8601" you cannot change the separator, as ISO8601 specifies that
       "T" must be used to separate them.

       <u>$dt-&gt;rfc3339</u>

       This  formats  a  datetime in RFC3339 format. This is the same as "$dt-&gt;datetime" with an added offset at
       the end of the string except if the time zone is the floating time zone.

       If the offset is '+00:00' then this is represented as 'Z'. Otherwise  the  offset  is  formatted  with  a
       leading  sign (+/-) and a colon separated numeric offset with hours and minutes. If the offset has a non-
       zero seconds component, that is also included.

       <u>$dt-&gt;stringify</u>

       This method returns a stringified version of the object. It is also how  stringification  overloading  is
       implemented.  If  the  object  has  a  formatter,  then its "format_datetime" method is used to produce a
       string.  Otherwise,  this  method  calls  "$dt-&gt;iso8601"  to  produce  a  string.  See  "Formatters   And
       Stringification" for details.

       <u>$dt-&gt;is_leap_year</u>

       This method returns a boolean value indicating whether or not the datetime object is in a leap year.

       <u>$dt-&gt;is_last_day_of_month</u>

       This  method returns a boolean value indicating whether or not the datetime object is the last day of the
       month.

       <u>$dt-&gt;is_last_day_of_quarter</u>

       This method returns a boolean value indicating whether or not the datetime object is the last day of  the
       quarter.

       <u>$dt-&gt;is_last_day_of_year</u>

       This  method returns a boolean value indicating whether or not the datetime object is the last day of the
       year.

       <u>$dt-&gt;month_length</u>

       This method returns the number of days in the current month.

       <u>$dt-&gt;quarter_length</u>

       This method returns the number of days in the current quarter.

       <u>$dt-&gt;year_length</u>

       This method returns the number of days in the current year.

       <u>$dt-&gt;week</u>

          my ( $week_year, $week_number ) = $dt-&gt;week;

       Returns information about the calendar week for the date. The values returned by  this  method  are  also
       available separately through the "$dt-&gt;week_year" and "$dt-&gt;week_number" methods.

       The  first  week of the year is defined by ISO as the one which contains the fourth day of January, which
       is equivalent to saying that it's the first week to overlap the new year by at least four days.

       Typically the week year will be the same as the year that the  object  is  in,  but  dates  at  the  very
       beginning  of  a  calendar year often end up in the last week of the prior year, and similarly, the final
       few days of the year may be placed in the first week of the next year.

       <u>$dt-&gt;week_year</u>

       Returns the year of the week. See "$dt-&gt;week" for details.

       <u>$dt-&gt;week_number</u>

       Returns the week of the year, from 1..53. See "$dt-&gt;week" for details.

       <u>$dt-&gt;week_of_month</u>

       The week of the month, from 0..5. The first week of the month is the first week that contains a Thursday.
       This is based on the ICU definition of week of  month,  and  correlates  to  the  ISO8601  week  of  year
       definition. A day in the week <u>before</u> the week with the first Thursday will be week 0.

       <u>$dt-&gt;jd,</u> <u>$dt-&gt;mjd</u>

       These return the Julian Day and Modified Julian Day, respectively. The value returned is a floating point
       number. The fractional portion of the number represents the time portion of the datetime.

       The  Julian  Day  is a count of days since the beginning of the Julian Period, which starts with day 0 at
       noon on January 1, -4712.

       The Modified Julian Day is a count of days since midnight on November 17, 1858.

       These methods always refer to the local time, so the  Julian  Day  is  the  same  for  a  given  datetime
       regardless  of  its  time  zone. Or in other words, 2020-12-04T13:01:57 in "America/Chicago" has the same
       Julian Day as 2020-12-04T13:01:57 in "Asia/Taipei".

       <u>$dt-&gt;time_zone</u>

       This returns the DateTime::TimeZone object for the datetime object.

       <u>$dt-&gt;offset</u>

       This returns the offset from UTC, in seconds, of the datetime object's time zone.

       <u>$dt-&gt;is_dst</u>

       Returns a boolean indicating whether or not the datetime's time zone is currently in Daylight Saving Time
       or not.

       <u>$dt-&gt;time_zone_long_name</u>

       This is a shortcut for "$dt-&gt;time_zone-&gt;name". It's provided so that one can use "%{time_zone_long_name}"
       as a strftime format specifier.

       <u>$dt-&gt;time_zone_short_name</u>

       This method returns the time zone abbreviation for the current time zone, such as "PST" or  "GMT".  These
       names  are  <b>not</b>  definitive,  and should not be used in any application intended for general use by users
       around the world. That's because it's possible for multiple time zones to have the same abbreviation.

       <u>$dt-&gt;strftime(</u> <u>$format,</u> <u>...</u> <u>)</u>

       This method implements functionality similar to the "strftime" method in C.  However, if  given  multiple
       format strings, then it will return multiple scalars, one for each format string.

       See the "strftime Patterns" section for a list of all possible strftime patterns.

       If you give a pattern that doesn't exist, then it is simply treated as text.

       Note  that  any  deviation from the POSIX standard is probably a bug. DateTime should match the output of
       "POSIX::strftime" for any given pattern.

       <u>$dt-&gt;format_cldr(</u> <u>$format,</u> <u>...</u> <u>)</u>

       This method implements formatting based on the CLDR date patterns. If given multiple format strings, then
       it will return multiple scalars, one for each format string.

       See the "CLDR Patterns" section for a list of all possible CLDR patterns.

       If you give a pattern that doesn't exist, then it is simply treated as text.

       <u>$dt-&gt;epoch</u>

       Returns the UTC epoch value for the datetime object. Datetimes before the start  of  the  epoch  will  be
       returned as a negative number.

       The return value from this method is always an integer number of seconds.

       Since  the  epoch  does  not  account  for  leap seconds, the epoch time for 1972-12-31T23:59:60 (UTC) is
       exactly the same as that for 1973-01-01T00:00:00.

       <u>$dt-&gt;hires_epoch</u>

       Returns the epoch as a floating point number. The floating point portion  of  the  value  represents  the
       nanosecond value of the object. This method is provided for compatibility with the "Time::HiRes" module.

       Note  that  this method suffers from the imprecision of floating point numbers, and the result may end up
       rounded to an arbitrary degree depending on your platform.

           my $dt = DateTime-&gt;new( year =&gt; 2012, nanosecond =&gt; 4 );
           say $dt-&gt;hires_epoch;

       On my system, this simply prints 1325376000 because adding 0.000000004 to 1325376000 returns 1325376000.

       <u>$dt-&gt;is_finite,</u> <u>$dt-&gt;is_infinite</u>

       These methods allow you to distinguish normal datetime objects  from  infinite  ones.  Infinite  datetime
       objects are documented in DateTime::Infinite.

       <u>$dt-&gt;utc_rd_values</u>

       Returns  the  current  UTC  Rata  Die days, seconds, and nanoseconds as a three element list. This exists
       primarily to allow other calendar modules to create objects based on the values provided by this object.

       <u>$dt-&gt;local_rd_values</u>

       Returns the current local Rata Die days, seconds, and nanoseconds as a three element  list.  This  exists
       for  the  benefit  of  other  modules  which  might  want  to use this information for date math, such as
       DateTime::Event::Recurrence.

       <u>$dt-&gt;leap_seconds</u>

       Returns the number of leap seconds that have happened up to the datetime represented by the  object.  For
       floating datetimes, this always returns 0.

       <u>$dt-&gt;utc_rd_as_seconds</u>

       Returns  the  current UTC Rata Die days and seconds purely as seconds. This number ignores any fractional
       seconds stored in the object, as well as leap seconds.

       <u>$dt-&gt;locale</u>

       Returns the datetime's DateTime::Locale object.

       <u>$dt-&gt;formatter</u>

       Returns the current formatter object or class. See "Formatters And Stringification" for details.

   <b>"Set"</b> <b>Methods</b>
       The remaining methods provided by "DateTime", except where otherwise specified, return the object itself,
       thus making method chaining possible. For example:

           my $dt = DateTime-&gt;now-&gt;set_time_zone( 'Australia/Sydney' );

           my $first = DateTime
                           -&gt;last_day_of_month( year =&gt; 2003, month =&gt; 3 )
                           -&gt;add( days =&gt; 1 )
                           -&gt;subtract( seconds =&gt; 1 );

       <u>$dt-&gt;set(</u> <u>..</u> <u>)</u>

       This method can be used to change the local components of a date time. This method accepts any  parameter
       allowed  by the "new" method except for "locale" or "time_zone". Use "set_locale" and "set_time_zone" for
       those instead.

       This method performs parameter validation just like the "new" method.

       <b>Do</b> <b>not</b> <b>use</b> <b>this</b> <b>method</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>date</b> <b>math.</b> <b>Use</b> <b>the</b> <b>"add"</b> <b>and</b> <b>"subtract"</b> <b>methods</b> <b>instead.</b>

       <u>$dt-&gt;set_year,</u> <u>$dt-&gt;set_month,</u> <u>etc.</u>

       DateTime has a "set_*" method for every item that can be passed to the constructor:

       •   $dt-&gt;set_year

       •   $dt-&gt;set_month

       •   $dt-&gt;set_day

       •   $dt-&gt;set_hour

       •   $dt-&gt;set_minute

       •   $dt-&gt;set_second

       •   $dt-&gt;set_nanosecond

       These are shortcuts to calling "set" with a single key. They all take a single parameter.

       <u>$dt-&gt;truncate(</u> <u>to</u> <u>=&gt;</u> <u>...</u> <u>)</u>

       This method allows you to reset some of the local time components in the object to their  "zero"  values.
       The  "to"  parameter is used to specify which values to truncate, and it may be one of "year", "quarter",
       "month", "week", "local_week", "day", "hour", "minute", or "second".

       For example, if "month" is specified, then the local day becomes 1, and the hour, minute, and second  all
       become 0.

       If  "week"  is given, then the datetime is set to the Monday of the week in which it occurs, and the time
       components are all set to 0. If you truncate to "local_week", then the first day of the week  is  locale-
       dependent. For example, in the "en-US" locale, the first day of the week is Sunday.

       <u>$dt-&gt;set_locale($locale)</u>

       Sets  the  object's  locale.  You  can provide either a locale code like "en-US" or an object returned by
       "DateTime::Locale-&gt;load".

       <u>$dt-&gt;set_time_zone($tz)</u>

       This method accepts either a time zone object or a string that can be passed as the "name"  parameter  to
       "DateTime::TimeZone-&gt;new".  If  the  new time zone's offset is different from the old time zone, then the
       <u>local</u> time is adjusted accordingly.

       For example:

           my $dt = DateTime-&gt;new(
               year      =&gt; 2000,
               month     =&gt; 5,
               day       =&gt; 10,
               hour      =&gt; 15,
               minute    =&gt; 15,
               time_zone =&gt; 'America/Los_Angeles',
           );

           print $dt-&gt;hour;    # prints 15

           $dt-&gt;set_time_zone('America/Chicago');

           print $dt-&gt;hour;    # prints 17

       If the old time zone was a floating time zone, then no adjustments to the local time are made, except  to
       account  for  leap  seconds.  If the new time zone is floating, then the <u>UTC</u> time is adjusted in order to
       leave the local time untouched.

       Fans of Tsai Ming-Liang's films will be happy to know that this does work:

           my $dt = DateTime-&gt;now( time_zone =&gt; 'Asia/Taipei' );
           $dt-&gt;set_time_zone('Europe/Paris');

       Yes, now we can know "ni3 na4 bian1 ji2 dian3?"

       <u>$dt-&gt;set_formatter($formatter)</u>

       Sets the formatter for the object. See "Formatters And Stringification" for details.

       You can set this to "undef" to revert to the default formatter.

   <b>Math</b> <b>Methods</b>
       Like the set methods, math related methods always return the object itself, to allow for chaining:

           $dt-&gt;add( days =&gt; 1 )-&gt;subtract( seconds =&gt; 1 );

       <u>$dt-&gt;duration_class</u>

       This returns "DateTime::Duration", but exists so that a subclass of "DateTime" can  provide  a  different
       value.

       <u>$dt-&gt;add_duration($duration_object)</u>

       This  method  adds a DateTime::Duration to the current datetime. See the DateTime::Duration docs for more
       details.

       <u>$dt-&gt;add(</u> <u>parameters</u> <u>for</u> <u>DateTime::Duration</u> <u>)</u>

       This method  is  syntactic  sugar  around  the  "$dt-&gt;add_duration"  method.  It  simply  creates  a  new
       DateTime::Duration object using the parameters given, and then calls the "$dt-&gt;add_duration" method.

       <u>$dt-&gt;add($duration_object)</u>

       A synonym of "$dt-&gt;add_duration($duration_object)".

       <u>$dt-&gt;subtract_duration($duration_object)</u>

       When  given  a  DateTime::Duration  object,  this  method simply calls "$dur-&gt;inverse" on that object and
       passes that new duration to the "$self-&gt;add_duration" method.

       <u>$dt-&gt;subtract(</u> <u>DateTime::Duration-&gt;new</u> <u>parameters</u> <u>)</u>

       Like "$dt-&gt;add", this is syntactic sugar for the "$dt-&gt;subtract_duration" method.

       <u>$dt-&gt;subtract($duration_object)</u>

       A synonym of "$dt-&gt;subtract_duration($duration_object)".

       <u>$dt-&gt;subtract_datetime($datetime)</u>

       This method returns a new DateTime::Duration object representing the difference between  the  two  dates.
       The duration is <b>relative</b> to the object from which $datetime is subtracted. For example:

           2003-03-15 00:00:00.00000000
        -  2003-02-15 00:00:00.00000000
        -------------------------------
        = 1 month

       Note  that  this  duration  is  not  an absolute measure of the amount of time between the two datetimes,
       because the length of a month varies, as well as due to the presence of leap seconds.

       The returned duration may have deltas for months, days, minutes, seconds, and nanoseconds.

       <u>$dt-&gt;delta_md($datetime),</u> <u>$dt-&gt;delta_days($datetime)</u>

       Each of these methods returns a new DateTime::Duration object representing some portion of the difference
       between two datetimes.  The "$dt-&gt;delta_md" method returns a duration which contains only the  month  and
       day  portions  of  the  duration  is  represented.  The "$dt-&gt;delta_days" method returns a duration which
       contains only days.

       The "$dt-&gt;delta_md" and "$dt-&gt;delta_days" methods truncate the duration so that any fractional portion of
       a day is ignored. Both of these methods  operate  on  the  date  portion  of  a  datetime  only,  and  so
       effectively ignore the time zone.

       Unlike the subtraction methods, <b>these</b> <b>methods</b> <b>always</b> <b>return</b> <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> <b>(or</b> <b>zero)</b> <b>duration</b>.

       <u>$dt-&gt;delta_ms($datetime)</u>

       Returns  a  duration which contains only minutes and seconds. Any day and month differences are converted
       to minutes and seconds. This method <b>always</b> <b>returns</b> <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> <b>(or</b> <b>zero)</b> <b>duration</b>.

       <u>$dt-&gt;subtract_datetime_absolute($datetime)</u>

       This method returns a new DateTime::Duration object representing the difference between the two dates  in
       seconds  and  nanoseconds. This is the only way to accurately measure the absolute amount of time between
       two datetimes, since units larger than a second do not represent a fixed number of seconds.

       Note that because of leap seconds, this may not return the same result as doing this math  based  on  the
       value returned by "$dt-&gt;epoch".

       <u>$dt-&gt;is_between(</u> <u>$lower,</u> <u>$upper</u> <u>)</u>

       Checks whether $dt is strictly between two other DateTime objects.

       "Strictly"  means  that  $dt  must  be greater than $lower and less than $upper. If it is <u>equal</u> to either
       object then this method returns false.

   <b>Class</b> <b>Methods</b>
       <u>DateTime-&gt;DefaultLocale($locale)</u>

       This can be used to specify the default locale to be used when creating DateTime objects. If unset,  then
       "en-US" is used.

       This  exists  for  backwards  compatibility,  but  is probably best avoided. This will change the default
       locale for every "DateTime" object created in  your  application,  even  those  created  by  third  party
       libraries which also use "DateTime".

       <u>DateTime-&gt;compare(</u> <u>$dt1,</u> <u>$dt2</u> <u>),</u> <u>DateTime-&gt;compare_ignore_floating(</u> <u>$dt1,</u> <u>$dt2</u> <u>)</u>

           $cmp = DateTime-&gt;compare( $dt1, $dt2 );

           $cmp = DateTime-&gt;compare_ignore_floating( $dt1, $dt2 );

       This  method  compare  two DateTime objects. The semantics are compatible with Perl's "sort" function; it
       returns -1 if "$dt1 &lt; $dt2", 0 if "$dt1 == $dt2", 1 if "$dt1 &gt; $dt2".

       If one of the two DateTime objects has a floating time zone, it will first be converted to the time  zone
       of the other object. This is what you want most of the time, but it can lead to inconsistent results when
       you compare a number of DateTime objects, some of which are floating, and some of which are in other time
       zones.

       If  you  want to have consistent results (because you want to sort an array of objects, for example), you
       can use the "compare_ignore_floating" method:

           @dates = sort { DateTime-&gt;compare_ignore_floating( $a, $b ) } @dates;

       In this case, objects with a floating time zone will be sorted as if they were UTC times.

       Since DateTime objects overload comparison operators, this:

           @dates = sort @dates;

       is equivalent to this:

           @dates = sort { DateTime-&gt;compare( $a, $b ) } @dates;

       DateTime objects can be compared to any other calendar class that implements the "utc_rd_values" method.

   <b>Testing</b> <b>Code</b> <b>That</b> <b>Uses</b> <b>DateTime</b>
       If you are trying to test code that calls uses DateTime, you may want to be to explicitly set  the  value
       returned by Perl's "time" builtin. This builtin is called by "DateTime-&gt;now" and "DateTime-&gt;today".

       You can override "CORE::GLOBAL::time", but this will only work if you do this <b>before</b> loading DateTime. If
       doing this is inconvenient, you can also override "DateTime::_core_time":

           no warnings 'redefine';
           local *DateTime::_core_time = sub { return 42 };

       DateTime is guaranteed to call this subroutine to get the current "time" value. You can also override the
       "_core_time" sub in a subclass of DateTime and use that.

   <b>How</b> <b>DateTime</b> <b>Math</b> <b>Works</b>
       It's important to have some understanding of how datetime math is implemented in order to effectively use
       this module and DateTime::Duration.

       <u>Making</u> <u>Things</u> <u>Simple</u>

       If you want to simplify your life and not have to think too hard about the nitty-gritty of datetime math,
       I have several recommendations:

       •   use the floating time zone

           If you do not care about time zones or leap seconds, use the "floating" timezone:

               my $dt = DateTime-&gt;now( time_zone =&gt; 'floating' );

           Math done on two objects in the floating time zone produces very predictable results.

           Note  that  in  most  cases  you will want to start by creating an object in a specific zone and <u>then</u>
           convert it to the floating time zone. When an object goes from a real zone to the floating zone,  the
           time for the object remains the same.

           This means that passing the floating zone to a constructor may not do what you want.

               my $dt = DateTime-&gt;now( time_zone =&gt; 'floating' );

           is equivalent to

               my $dt = DateTime-&gt;now( time_zone =&gt; 'UTC' )-&gt;set_time_zone('floating');

           This might not be what you wanted. Instead, you may prefer to do this:

               my $dt = DateTime-&gt;now( time_zone =&gt; 'local' )-&gt;set_time_zone('floating');

       •   use UTC for all calculations

           If you do care about time zones (particularly DST) or leap seconds, try to use non-UTC time zones for
           presentation  and user input only. Convert to UTC immediately and convert back to the local time zone
           for presentation:

               my $dt = DateTime-&gt;new( %user_input, time_zone =&gt; $user_tz );
               $dt-&gt;set_time_zone('UTC');

               # do various operations - store it, retrieve it, add, subtract, etc.

               $dt-&gt;set_time_zone($user_tz);
               print $dt-&gt;datetime;

       •   math on non-UTC time zones

           If you need to do date math on objects with  non-UTC  time  zones,  please  read  the  caveats  below
           carefully.  The  results  "DateTime"  produces  are  predictable,  correct, and mostly intuitive, but
           datetime math gets very ugly when time zones are involved, and there are a few strange  corner  cases
           involving subtraction of two datetimes across a DST change.

           If  you  can  always use the floating or UTC time zones, you can skip ahead to "Leap Seconds and Date
           Math"

       •   date vs datetime math

           If you  only  care  about  the  date  (calendar)  portion  of  a  datetime,  you  should  use  either
           "$dt-&gt;delta_md"  or  "$dt-&gt;delta_days",  not  "$dt-&gt;subtract_datetime".  This  will give predictable,
           unsurprising results, free from DST-related complications.

       •   $dt-&gt;subtract_datetime and $dt-&gt;add_duration

           You must convert your datetime objects to the UTC time zone before doing date math  if  you  want  to
           make sure that the following formulas are always true:

               $dt2 - $dt1 = $dur
               $dt1 + $dur = $dt2
               $dt2 - $dur = $dt1

           Note  that  using  "$dt-&gt;delta_days"  ensures  that this formula always works, regardless of the time
           zones of the objects involved, as does  using  "$dt-&gt;subtract_datetime_absolute".  Other  methods  of
           subtraction are not always reversible.

       •   never do math on two objects where only one is in the floating time zone

           The  date  math  code accounts for leap seconds whenever the "DateTime" object is not in the floating
           time zone. If you try to do math where one object is in the floating zone and the  other  isn't,  the
           results will be confusing and wrong.

       <u>Adding</u> <u>a</u> <u>Duration</u> <u>to</u> <u>a</u> <u>DateTime</u>

       The parts of a duration can be broken down into five parts. These are months, days, minutes, seconds, and
       nanoseconds.  Adding  one  month  to  a  date is different than adding 4 weeks or 28, 29, 30, or 31 days.
       Similarly, due to DST and leap seconds, adding a day can be different than  adding  86,400  seconds,  and
       adding a minute is not exactly the same as 60 seconds.

       We  cannot  convert  between  these  units, except for seconds and nanoseconds, because there is no fixed
       conversion between most pairs of units. That is because of things like leap seconds, DST changes, etc.

       "DateTime" always adds (or subtracts) days, then months, minutes, and then seconds  and  nanoseconds.  If
       there  are  any  boundary overflows, these are normalized at each step. For the days and months the local
       (not UTC) values are used. For minutes and seconds, the local values are used. This generally just works.

       This means that adding one month and one day to February 28, 2003 will produce the date  April  1,  2003,
       not March 29, 2003.

           my $dt = DateTime-&gt;new( year =&gt; 2003, month =&gt; 2, day =&gt; 28 );

           $dt-&gt;add( months =&gt; 1, days =&gt; 1 );

           # 2003-04-01 - the result

       On the other hand, if we add months first, and then separately add days, we end up with March 29, 2003:

           $dt-&gt;add( months =&gt; 1 )-&gt;add( days =&gt; 1 );

           # 2003-03-29

       We see similar strangeness when math crosses a DST boundary:

           my $dt = DateTime-&gt;new(
               year      =&gt; 2003,
               month     =&gt; 4,
               day       =&gt; 5,
               hour      =&gt; 1,
               minute    =&gt; 58,
               time_zone =&gt; "America/Chicago",
           );

           $dt-&gt;add( days =&gt; 1, minutes =&gt; 3 );
           # 2003-04-06 02:01:00

           $dt-&gt;add( minutes =&gt; 3 )-&gt;add( days =&gt; 1 );
           # 2003-04-06 03:01:00

       Note that if you converted the datetime object to UTC first you would get predictable results.

       If  you  want  to  know  how many seconds a DateTime::Duration object represents, you have to add it to a
       datetime to find out, so you could do:

           my $now   = DateTime-&gt;now( time_zone =&gt; 'UTC' );
           my $later = $now-&gt;clone-&gt;add_duration($duration);

           my $seconds_dur = $later-&gt;subtract_datetime_absolute($now);

       This returns a DateTime::Duration which only contains seconds and nanoseconds.

       If we were add the duration to a different "DateTime" object we might get a different number of seconds.

       DateTime::Duration supports three different end-of-month algorithms for adding months.  This  comes  into
       play when an addition results in a day past the end of the following month (for example, adding one month
       to January 30).

           # 2010-08-31 + 1 month = 2010-10-01
           $dt-&gt;add( months =&gt; 1, end_of_month =&gt; 'wrap' );

           # 2010-01-30 + 1 month = 2010-02-28
           $dt-&gt;add( months =&gt; 1, end_of_month =&gt; 'limit' );

           # 2010-04-30 + 1 month = 2010-05-31
           $dt-&gt;add( months =&gt; 1, end_of_month =&gt; 'preserve' );

       By  default,  it  uses  "wrap"  for  positive  durations  and  "preserve"  for  negative  durations.  See
       DateTime::Duration for a detailed explanation of these algorithms.

       If you need to do lots of work with durations, take a  look  at  the  DateTime::Format::Duration  module,
       which lets you present information from durations in many useful ways.

       There  are  other  subtract/delta  methods  in "DateTime" to generate different types of durations. These
       methods     are     "$dt-&gt;subtract_datetime",     "$dt-&gt;subtract_datetime_absolute",     "$dt-&gt;delta_md",
       "$dt-&gt;delta_days", and "$dt-&gt;delta_ms".

       <u>DateTime</u> <u>Subtraction</u>

       Date  subtraction  is done based solely on the two object's local datetimes, with one exception to handle
       DST changes. Also, if the two datetime objects are in different time zones, one of them is  converted  to
       the other's time zone first before subtraction. This is best explained through examples:

       The first of these probably makes the most sense:

           # not DST
           my $dt1 = DateTime-&gt;new(
               year      =&gt; 2003,
               month     =&gt; 5,
               day       =&gt; 6,
               time_zone =&gt; 'America/Chicago',
           );

           # is DST
           my $dt2 = DateTime-&gt;new(
               year      =&gt; 2003,
               month     =&gt; 11,
               day       =&gt; 6,
               time_zone =&gt; 'America/Chicago',
           );

           # 6 months
           my $dur = $dt2-&gt;subtract_datetime($dt1);

       Nice and simple.

       This one is a little trickier, but still fairly logical:

           # is DST
           my $dt1 = DateTime-&gt;new(
               year      =&gt; 2003,
               month     =&gt; 4,
               day       =&gt; 5,
               hour      =&gt; 1,
               minute    =&gt; 58,
               time_zone =&gt; "America/Chicago",
           );

           # not DST
           my $dt2 = DateTime-&gt;new(
               year      =&gt; 2003,
               month     =&gt; 4,
               day       =&gt; 7,
               hour      =&gt; 2,
               minute    =&gt; 1,
               time_zone =&gt; "America/Chicago",
           );

           # 2 days and 3 minutes
           my $dur = $dt2-&gt;subtract_datetime($dt1);

       Which contradicts the result this one gives, even though they both make sense:

           # is DST
           my $dt1 = DateTime-&gt;new(
               year      =&gt; 2003,
               month     =&gt; 4,
               day       =&gt; 5,
               hour      =&gt; 1,
               minute    =&gt; 58,
               time_zone =&gt; "America/Chicago",
           );

           # not DST
           my $dt2 = DateTime-&gt;new(
               year      =&gt; 2003,
               month     =&gt; 4,
               day       =&gt; 6,
               hour      =&gt; 3,
               minute    =&gt; 1,
               time_zone =&gt; "America/Chicago",
           );

           # 1 day and 3 minutes
           my $dur = $dt2-&gt;subtract_datetime($dt1);

       This  last example illustrates the "DST" exception mentioned earlier. The exception accounts for the fact
       2003-04-06 only lasts 23 hours.

       And finally:

           my $dt2 = DateTime-&gt;new(
               year      =&gt; 2003,
               month     =&gt; 10,
               day       =&gt; 26,
               hour      =&gt; 1,
               time_zone =&gt; 'America/Chicago',
           );

           my $dt1 = $dt2-&gt;clone-&gt;subtract( hours =&gt; 1 );

           # 60 minutes
           my $dur = $dt2-&gt;subtract_datetime($dt1);

       This seems obvious until you realize that subtracting 60 minutes from $dt2 in  the  above  example  still
       leaves the clock time at "01:00:00". This time we are accounting for a 25 hour day.

       <u>Reversibility</u>

       Date  math  operations are not always reversible. This is because of the way that addition operations are
       ordered. As was discussed earlier, adding 1 day and 3 minutes in one call to "$dt-&gt;add" is not  the  same
       as first adding 3 minutes and 1 day in two separate calls.

       If  we  take  a  duration  returned  from  "$dt-&gt;subtract_datetime"  and then try to add or subtract that
       duration from one of the datetimes we just used, we sometimes get interesting results:

           my $dt1 = DateTime-&gt;new(
               year      =&gt; 2003,
               month     =&gt; 4,
               day       =&gt; 5,
               hour      =&gt; 1,
               minute    =&gt; 58,
               time_zone =&gt; "America/Chicago",
           );

           my $dt2 = DateTime-&gt;new(
               year      =&gt; 2003,
               month     =&gt; 4,
               day       =&gt; 6,
               hour      =&gt; 3,
               minute    =&gt; 1,
               time_zone =&gt; "America/Chicago",
           );

           # 1 day and 3 minutes
           my $dur = $dt2-&gt;subtract_datetime($dt1);

           # gives us $dt2
           $dt1-&gt;add_duration($dur);

           # gives us 2003-04-05 02:58:00 - 1 hour later than $dt1
           $dt2-&gt;subtract_duration($dur);

       The "$dt-&gt;subtract_duration" operation gives us a (perhaps) unexpected answer because it first  subtracts
       one day to get 2003-04-05T03:01:00 and then subtracts 3 minutes to get the final result.

       If we explicitly reverse the order we can get the original value of $dt1.  This can be facilitated by the
       DateTime::Duration class's "$dur-&gt;calendar_duration" and "$dur-&gt;clock_duration" methods:

           $dt2-&gt;subtract_duration( $dur-&gt;clock_duration )
               -&gt;subtract_duration( $dur-&gt;calendar_duration );

       <u>Leap</u> <u>Seconds</u> <u>and</u> <u>Date</u> <u>Math</u>

       The  presence of leap seconds can cause even more anomalies in date math. For example, the following is a
       legal datetime:

           my $dt = DateTime-&gt;new(
               year      =&gt; 1972,
               month     =&gt; 12,
               day       =&gt; 31,
               hour      =&gt; 23,
               minute    =&gt; 59,
               second    =&gt; 60,
               time_zone =&gt; 'UTC'
           );

       If we add one month ...

           $dt-&gt;add( months =&gt; 1 );

       ... the datetime is now "1973-02-01 00:00:00", because there is no 23:59:60 on 1973-01-31.

       Leap seconds also force us to distinguish between  minutes  and  seconds  during  date  math.  Given  the
       following datetime ...

           my $dt = DateTime-&gt;new(
               year      =&gt; 1972,
               month     =&gt; 12,
               day       =&gt; 31,
               hour      =&gt; 23,
               minute    =&gt; 59,
               second    =&gt; 30,
               time_zone =&gt; 'UTC'
           );

       ...  we will get different results when adding 1 minute than we get if we add 60 seconds. This is because
       in this case, the last minute of the day, beginning at 23:59:00, actually contains 61 seconds.

       Here are the results we get:

           # 1972-12-31 23:59:30 - our starting datetime
           my $dt = DateTime-&gt;new(
               year      =&gt; 1972,
               month     =&gt; 12,
               day       =&gt; 31,
               hour      =&gt; 23,
               minute    =&gt; 59,
               second    =&gt; 30,
               time_zone =&gt; 'UTC'
           );

           # 1973-01-01 00:00:30 - one minute later
           $dt-&gt;clone-&gt;add( minutes =&gt; 1 );

           # 1973-01-01 00:00:29 - 60 seconds later
           $dt-&gt;clone-&gt;add( seconds =&gt; 60 );

           # 1973-01-01 00:00:30 - 61 seconds later
           $dt-&gt;clone-&gt;add( seconds =&gt; 61 );

       <u>Local</u> <u>vs.</u> <u>UTC</u> <u>and</u> <u>24</u> <u>hours</u> <u>vs.</u> <u>1</u> <u>day</u>

       When math crosses a daylight saving boundary, a single day may have more or less than 24 hours.

       For example, if you do this ...

           my $dt = DateTime-&gt;new(
               year      =&gt; 2003,
               month     =&gt; 4,
               day       =&gt; 5,
               hour      =&gt; 2,
               time_zone =&gt; 'America/Chicago',
           );

           $dt-&gt;add( days =&gt; 1 );

       ... then you will produce an <u>invalid</u> local time, and therefore an exception will be thrown.

       However, this works ...

           my $dt = DateTime-&gt;new(
               year      =&gt; 2003,
               month     =&gt; 4,
               day       =&gt; 5,
               hour      =&gt; 2,
               time_zone =&gt; 'America/Chicago',
           );

           $dt-&gt;add( hours =&gt; 24 );

       ... and produces a datetime with the local time of "03:00".

       If all this makes your head hurt, there is a simple alternative. Just convert your datetime object to the
       "UTC" time zone before doing date math on it, and switch it back to the local time zone afterwards.  This
       avoids the possibility of having date math throw an exception, and makes sure that 1 day equals 24 hours.
       Of course, this may not always be desirable, so caveat user!

   <b>Overloading</b>
       This  module  explicitly  overloads  the  addition  (+),  subtraction  (-), string and numeric comparison
       operators. This means that the following all do sensible things:

           my $new_dt = $dt + $duration_obj;

           my $new_dt = $dt - $duration_obj;

           my $duration_obj = $dt - $new_dt;

           for my $dt ( sort @dts ) {...}

       Additionally, the fallback parameter is set to true, so other derivable operators  (+=,  -=,  etc.)  will
       work properly. Do not expect increment (++) or decrement (--) to do anything useful.

       The  string  comparison  operators,  "eq" or "ne", will use the string value to compare with non-DateTime
       objects.

       DateTime objects do not have a numeric value, using "==" or "&lt;=&gt;" to compare a  DateTime  object  with  a
       non-DateTime  object will result in an exception. To safely sort mixed DateTime and non-DateTime objects,
       use "sort { $a cmp $b } @dates".

       The module also overloads stringification using the object's formatter, defaulting to  "iso8601"  method.
       See "Formatters And Stringification" for details.

   <b>Formatters</b> <b>And</b> <b>Stringification</b>
       You  can  optionally  specify a "formatter", which is usually a "DateTime::Format::*" object or class, to
       control the stringification of the DateTime object.

       Any of the constructor methods can accept a formatter argument:

           my $formatter = DateTime::Format::Strptime-&gt;new(...);
           my $dt        = DateTime-&gt;new( year =&gt; 2004, formatter =&gt; $formatter );

       Or, you can set it afterwards:

           $dt-&gt;set_formatter($formatter);
           $formatter = $dt-&gt;formatter;

       Once you set the formatter, the overloaded stringification method will use the formatter. If unspecified,
       the "iso8601" method is used.

       A formatter can be handy when you know that in your application  you  want  to  stringify  your  DateTime
       objects into a special format all the time, for example in Postgres format.

       If  you  provide  a  formatter  class  name or object, it must implement a "format_datetime" method. This
       method will be called with just the "DateTime" object as its argument.

   <b>CLDR</b> <b>Patterns</b>
       The CLDR pattern language is both  more  powerful  and  more  complex  than  strftime.   Unlike  strftime
       patterns,  you  often  have to explicitly escape text that you do not want formatted, as the patterns are
       simply letters without any prefix.

       For example, "yyyy-MM-dd" is a valid CLDR pattern. If you want to include any lower or upper  case  ASCII
       characters  as-is,  you  can surround them with single quotes ('). If you want to include a single quote,
       you must escape it as two single quotes ('').

           my $pattern1 = q{'Today is ' EEEE};
           my $pattern2 = q{'It is now' h 'o''clock' a};

       Spaces and any non-letter text will always be passed through as-is.

       Many CLDR patterns which produce numbers will pad the number with leading zeroes depending on the  length
       of the format specifier. For example, "h" represents the current hour from 1-12. If you specify "hh" then
       hours 1-9 will have a leading zero prepended.

       However,  CLDR  often uses five of a letter to represent the narrow form of a pattern. This inconsistency
       is necessary for backwards compatibility.

       There are many cases where CLDR patterns distinguish between the "format" and "stand-alone"  forms  of  a
       pattern.  The format pattern is used when the thing in question is being placed into a larger string. The
       stand-alone form is used when displaying that item by itself, for example in a calendar.

       There are also many cases where  CLDR  provides  three  sizes  for  each  item,  wide  (the  full  name),
       abbreviated, and narrow. The narrow form is often just a single character, for example "T" for "Tuesday",
       and may not be unique.

       CLDR  provides  a  fairly complex system for localizing time zones that we ignore entirely. The time zone
       patterns just use the information provided by "DateTime::TimeZone", and <u>do</u> <u>not</u> <u>follow</u> <u>the</u> <u>CLDR</u> <u>spec</u>.

       The output of a CLDR pattern is always localized, when applicable.

       CLDR provides the following patterns:

       •   G{1,3}

           The abbreviated era (BC, AD).

       •   GGGG

           The wide era (Before Christ, Anno Domini).

       •   GGGGG

           The narrow era, if it exists (but it mostly doesn't).

       •   y and y{3,}

           The year, zero-prefixed as needed. Negative years will start with a "-", and this will be included in
           the length calculation.

           In other, words the "yyyyy" pattern will format year -1234 as "-1234", not "-01234".

       •   yy

           This is a special case. It always produces a two-digit year, so "1976" becomes "76".  Negative  years
           will start with a "-", making them one character longer.

       •   Y{1,}

           The year in "week of the year" calendars, from "$dt-&gt;week_year".

       •   u{1,}

           Same as "y" except that "uu" is not a special case.

       •   Q{1,2}

           The quarter as a number (1..4).

       •   QQQ

           The abbreviated format form for the quarter.

       •   QQQQ

           The wide format form for the quarter.

       •   q{1,2}

           The quarter as a number (1..4).

       •   qqq

           The abbreviated stand-alone form for the quarter.

       •   qqqq

           The wide stand-alone form for the quarter.

       •   M{1,2}

           The numerical month.

       •   MMM

           The abbreviated format form for the month.

       •   MMMM

           The wide format form for the month.

       •   MMMMM

           The narrow format form for the month.

       •   L{1,2}

           The numerical month.

       •   LLL

           The abbreviated stand-alone form for the month.

       •   LLLL

           The wide stand-alone form for the month.

       •   LLLLL

           The narrow stand-alone form for the month.

       •   w{1,2}

           The week of the year, from "$dt-&gt;week_number".

       •   W

           The week of the month, from "$dt-&gt;week_of_month".

       •   d{1,2}

           The numeric day of the month.

       •   D{1,3}

           The numeric day of the year.

       •   F

           The day of the week in the month, from "$dt-&gt;weekday_of_month".

       •   g{1,}

           The modified Julian day, from "$dt-&gt;mjd".

       •   E{1,3} and eee

           The abbreviated format form for the day of the week.

       •   EEEE and eeee

           The wide format form for the day of the week.

       •   EEEEE and eeeee

           The narrow format form for the day of the week.

       •   e{1,2}

           The  <u>local</u>  numeric  day  of the week, from 1 to 7. This number depends on what day is considered the
           first day of the week, which varies by locale. For example, in the US, Sunday is the first day of the
           week, so this returns 2 for Monday.

       •   c

           The numeric day of the week from 1 to 7, treating Monday as the first  of  the  week,  regardless  of
           locale.

       •   a

           The localized form of AM or PM for the time.

       •   h{1,2}

           The hour from 1-12.

       •   H{1,2}

           The hour from 0-23.

       •   K{1,2}

           The hour from 0-11.

       •   k{1,2}

           The hour from 1-24.

       •   j{1,2}

           The  hour, in 12 or 24 hour form, based on the preferred form for the locale. In other words, this is
           equivalent to either "h{1,2}" or "H{1,2}".

       •   m{1,2}

           The minute.

       •   s{1,2}

           The second.

       •   S{1,}

           The fractional portion of the seconds, rounded based on the length of the  specifier.  This  returned
           <u>without</u> a leading decimal point, but may have leading or trailing zeroes.

       •   A{1,}

           The  millisecond  of  the  day, based on the current time. In other words, if it is 12:00:00.00, this
           returns 43200000.

       •   z{1,3}

           The time zone short name.

       •   zzzz

           The time zone long name.

           The time zone offset.

       •   ZZZZ

           The time zone short name and the offset as one string, so something like "CDT-0500".

       •   ZZZZZ

           The time zone offset as a sexagesimal number, so something like "-05:00". (This  is  useful  for  W3C
           format.)

       •   v{1,3}

           The time zone short name.

       •   vvvv

           The time zone long name.

       •   V{1,3}

           The time zone short name.

           The time zone long name.

       <u>CLDR</u> <u>"Available</u> <u>Formats"</u>

       The CLDR data includes pre-defined formats for various patterns such as "month and day" or "time of day".
       Using these formats lets you render information about a datetime in the most natural way for users from a
       given locale.

       These  formats are indexed by a key that is itself a CLDR pattern. When you look these up, you get back a
       different CLDR pattern suitable for the locale.

       Let's look at some example We'll use "2008-02-05T18:30:30" as our example datetime  value,  and  see  how
       this is rendered for the "en-US" and "fr-FR" locales.

       •   "MMMd"

           The  abbreviated  month  and day as number. For "en-US", we get the pattern "MMM d", which renders as
           "Feb 5". For "fr-FR", we get the pattern "d MMM", which renders as "5 févr.".

       •   "yQQQ"

           The year and abbreviated quarter of year. For "en-US", we get the pattern "QQQ y", which  renders  as
           "Q1 2008". For "fr-FR", we get the same pattern, "QQQ y", which renders as "T1 2008".

       •   "hm"

           The  12-hour  time of day without seconds. For "en-US", we get the pattern "h:mm a", which renders as
           "6:30 PM". For "fr-FR", we get the exact same pattern and rendering.

       The available formats for each locale are documented in the POD for that locale. To get back the  format,
       you use the "$locale-&gt;format_for" method.  For example:

           say $dt-&gt;format_cldr( $dt-&gt;locale-&gt;format_for('MMMd') );

   <b>strftime</b> <b>Patterns</b>
       The following patterns are allowed in the format string given to the "$dt-&gt;strftime" method:

       •   %a

           The abbreviated weekday name.

       •   %A

           The full weekday name.

       •   %b

           The abbreviated month name.

       •   %B

           The full month name.

       •   %c

           The default datetime format for the object's locale.

       •   %C

           The century number (year/100) as a 2-digit integer.

       •   %d

           The day of the month as a decimal number (range 01 to 31).

       •   %D

           Equivalent  to  %m/%d/%y.  This  is not a good standard format if you want folks from both the United
           States and the rest of the world to understand the date!

       •   %e

           Like %d, the day of the month as a decimal number, but a leading zero is replaced by a space.

       •   %F

           Equivalent to %Y-%m-%d (the ISO 8601 date format)

       •   %G

           The ISO 8601 year with century as a decimal number. The 4-digit year corresponding to  the  ISO  week
           number (see %V). This has the same format and value as %Y, except that if the ISO week number belongs
           to the previous or next year, that year is used instead. (TZ)

       •   %g

           Like %G, but without century, i.e., with a 2-digit year (00-99).

       •   %h

           Equivalent to %b.

           (See also %H.)

       •   %l

           The hour (12-hour clock) as a decimal number (range 1 to 12); single digits are preceded by a  blank.
           (See also %I.)

           This value will always be rounded down to the nearest integer.

       •   %p

           Either  `AM'  or `PM' according to the given time value, or the corresponding strings for the current
           locale. Noon is treated as `pm' and midnight as `am'.

       This module is part of a larger ecosystem of modules in the DateTime family.

   <b>DateTime::Set</b>
       The DateTime::Set module represents sets (including recurrences) of datetimes. Many modules  return  sets
       or recurrences.

   <b>Format</b> <b>Modules</b>
       The  various  format  modules  exist  to  parse and format datetimes. For example, DateTime::Format::HTTP
       parses dates according to the RFC 1123 format:

           my $datetime
               = DateTime::Format::HTTP-&gt;parse_datetime(
               'Thu Feb  3 17:03:55 GMT 1994');

           print DateTime::Format::HTTP-&gt;format_datetime($datetime);

       Most format modules are suitable for use as a "formatter" with a DateTime object.

       All format modules start with DateTime::Format:: &lt;https://metacpan.org/search?q=datetime%3A%3Aformat&gt;.

   <b>Calendar</b> <b>Modules</b>
       There are a number of modules on CPAN that implement non-Gregorian calendars, such as the Chinese, Mayan,
       and Julian calendars.

       All           calendar           modules            start            with            DateTime::Calendar::
       &lt;https://metacpan.org/search?q=datetime%3A%3Acalendar&gt;.

   <b>Event</b> <b>Modules</b>
       There are a number of modules that calculate the dates for events, such as Easter, Sunrise, etc.

       All event modules start with DateTime::Event:: &lt;https://metacpan.org/search?q=datetime%3A%3Aevent&gt;.

   <b>Others</b>
       There  are  many  other  modules  that  work  with DateTime, including modules in the DateTimeX namespace
       &lt;https://metacpan.org/search?q=datetimex&gt; namespace, as well as others.

       See MetaCPAN &lt;https://metacpan.org/search?q=datetime&gt; for more modules.

</pre><h4><b>KNOWN</b> <b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       The tests in <u>20infinite.t</u> seem to fail on some machines,  particularly  on  Win32.  This  appears  to  be
       related   to   Perl's   internal   handling   of   IEEE   infinity  and  NaN,  and  seems  to  be  highly
       platform/compiler/phase of moon dependent.

       If you don't plan to use infinite datetimes you can probably ignore this. This will be fixed (perhaps) in
       future versions.

</pre><h4><b>DONATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       If  you'd  like to thank me for the work I've done on this module, please consider making a "donation" to
       me via PayPal. I spend a lot of free time creating free software, and would appreciate any support  you'd
       care to offer.

       Please  note  that  <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> in order for me to continue working on this
       particular software. I will continue to do so, inasmuch as I  have  in  the  past,  for  as  long  as  it
       interests me.

       Similarly,  a donation made in this way will probably not make me work on this software much more, unless
       I get so many donations that I can consider working on free software full time (let's all have a  chuckle
       at that together).

       To   donate,   log   into   PayPal   and   send   money   to  <a href="mailto:autarch@urth.org">autarch@urth.org</a>,  or  use  the  button  at
       &lt;https://houseabsolute.com/foss-donations/&gt;.
