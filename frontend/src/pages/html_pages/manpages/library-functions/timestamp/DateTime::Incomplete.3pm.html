</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       DateTime::Incomplete - An incomplete datetime, like January 5

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         my $dti = DateTime::Incomplete-&gt;new( year =&gt; 2003 );
         # 2003-xx-xx
         $dti-&gt;set( month =&gt; 12 );
         # 2003-12-xx
         $dt = $dti-&gt;to_datetime( base =&gt; DateTime-&gt;now );
         # 2003-12-19T16:54:33

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       DateTime::Incomplete is a class for representing partial dates and times.

       These are actually encountered relatively frequently.  For example, a birthday is commonly given as a
       month and day, without a year.

</pre><h4><b>ERROR</b> <b>HANDLING</b></h4><pre>
       Constructor and mutator methods (such as "new" and "set") will die if there is an attempt to set the
       datetime to an invalid value.

       Invalid values are detected by setting the appropriate fields of a "base" datetime object. See the
       "set_base" method.

       Accessor methods (such as day()) will return either a value or "undef", but will never die.

</pre><h4><b>THE</b> <b>"BASE"</b> <b>DATETIME</b></h4><pre>
       A "DateTime::Incomplete" object can have a "base" "DateTime.pm" object.  This object is used as a default
       datetime in the to_datetime() method, and it also used to validate inputs to the set() method.

       The base object must use the year/month/day system.  Most calendars use this system including Gregorian
       ("DateTime") and Julian.  Note that this module has not been well tested with base objects from classes
       other than "DateTime.pm" class.

       By default, newly created "DateTime::Incomplete" objects have no base.

</pre><h4><b>DATETIME-LIKE</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       Most methods provided by this class are designed to emulate the behavior of "DateTime.pm" whenever
       possible.

       •   <b>new()</b>

           Creates a new incomplete date:

             my $dti = DateTime::Incomplete-&gt;new( year =&gt; 2003 );
             # 2003-xx-xx

           This  class  method  accepts  parameters  for  each  date and time component: "year", "month", "day",
           "hour", "minute", "second", "nanosecond".  Additionally, it accepts "time_zone", "locale", and "base"
           parameters.

           Any parameters not given default to "undef".

           Calling the new() method without parameters creates a completely undefined datetime:

             my $dti = DateTime::Incomplete-&gt;new();

       •   from_day_of_year( ... )

           This constructor takes the same arguments as can be given to the new() method, except  that  it  does
           not accept a "month" or "day" argument.  Instead, it requires both "year" and "day_of_year".  The day
           of year must be between 1 and 366, and 366 is only allowed for leap years.

           It  creates  a  "DateTime::Incomplete"  object with all date fields defined, but with the time fields
           (hour, minute, etc.) set to undef.

       •   from_object( object =&gt; $object, ... )

           This class method can be used to construct a new "DateTime::Incomplete" object from any  object  that
           implements  the  utc_rd_values() method.  All "DateTime::Calendar" modules must implement this method
           in order to provide cross-calendar compatibility.  This method accepts a "locale" parameter.

           If the object passed to this method has a time_zone() method, that is used  to  set  the  time  zone.
           Otherwise UTC is used.

           It creates a "DateTime::Incomplete" object with all fields defined.

       •   from_epoch( ... )

           This  class  method  can  be used to construct a new "DateTime::Incomplete" object from an epoch time
           instead of components.   Just  as  with  the  new()  method,  it  accepts  "time_zone"  and  "locale"
           parameters.

           If  the  epoch  value is not an integer, the part after the decimal will be converted to nanoseconds.
           This is done in order to be compatible with "Time::HiRes".

           It creates a "DateTime::Incomplete" object with all fields defined.

       •   now( ... )

           This class method is equivalent to "DateTime-&gt;now".

           It creates a new "DateTime::Incomplete" object with all fields defined.

       •   today( ... )

           This class method is equivalent  to  now(),  but  it  leaves  hour,  minute,  second  and  nanosecond
           undefined.

       •   clone

           Creates a new object with the same information as the object this method is called on.

   <b>"Get"</b> <b>Methods</b>
       •   year

       •   month

       •   day

       •   hour

       •   minute

       •   second

       •   nanosecond

       •   time_zone

       •   locale

           These methods returns the field value for the object, or "undef".

           These  values  can  also be accessed using the same alias methods available in "DateTime.pm", such as
           mon(), mday(), etc.

       •   has_year

       •   has_month

       •   has_day

       •   has_hour

       •   has_minute

       •   has_second

       •   has_nanosecond

       •   has_time_zone

       •   has_locale

       •   has_date

       •   has_time

           Returns a boolean value indicating whether the corresponding component is defined.

           "has_date" tests for year, month, and day.

           "has_time" tests for hour, minute, and second.

       •   has

               $has_date = $dti-&gt;has( 'year', 'month', 'day' );

           Returns a boolean value indicating whether all fields in the argument list are defined.

       •   defined_fields

               @fields = $dti-&gt;defined_fields;   # list of field names

           Returns a list containing the names of the fields that are defined.

           The list order is: year, month, day, hour, minute, second, nanosecond, time_zone, locale.

       •   datetime, ymd, date, hms, time, iso8601, mdy, dmy

           These are equivalent to DateTime  stringification  methods  with  the  same  name,  except  that  the
           undefined fields are replaced by 'xx' or 'xxxx' as appropriate.

       •   epoch

       •   hires_epoch

       •   is_dst

       •   utc_rd_values

       •   utc_rd_as_seconds

               my $epoch = $dti-&gt;epoch( base =&gt; $dt );

           These methods are equivalent to the "DateTime" methods with the same name.

           They all accept a "base" argument to use in order to calculate the method's return values.

           If no "base" argument is given, then "today" is used.

       •   is_finite, is_infinite

           Incomplete dates are always "finite".

       •   strftime( $format, ... )

           This  method  implements  functionality  similar  to  the  strftime() method in C.  However, if given
           multiple format strings, then it will return multiple scalars, one for each format string.

           See the "strftime Specifiers" section in the "DateTime.pm" documentation for a list of  all  possible
           format specifiers.

           Undefined fields are replaced by 'xx' or 'xxxx' as appropriate.

           The  specification  %s  (epoch) is calculated using "today" as the base date, unless the object has a
           base datetime set.

       <u>Computed</u> <u>Values</u>

       All other accessors, such as day_of_week(), or week_year() are  computed  from  the  base  values  for  a
       datetime.   When  these methods are called, they return the requested information if there is enough data
       to compute them, otherwise they return "undef"

       <u>Unimplemented</u> <u>Methods</u>

       The following "DateTime.pm" methods are not implemented in "DateTime::Incomplete", though  some  of  them
       may be implemented in future versions:

       •   add_duration

       •   add

       •   subtract_duration

       •   subtract

       •   subtract_datetime

       •   subtract_datetime_absolute

       •   delta_md

       •   delta_days

       •   delta_ms

       •   compare

       •   compare_ignore_floating

       •   DefaultLanguage

   <b>"Set"</b> <b>Methods</b>
       •   set

           Use this to set or undefine a datetime field:

             $dti-&gt;set( month =&gt; 12 );
             $dti-&gt;set( day =&gt; 24 );
             $dti-&gt;set( day =&gt; undef );

           This  method takes the same arguments as the set() method in "DateTime.pm", but it can accept "undef"
           for any value.

       •   set_time_zone

           This method accepts either a time zone object or a string that can be passed as the "name"  parameter
           to "DateTime::TimeZone-&gt;new()".

           Unlike with "DateTime.pm", if the new time zone's offset is different from the previous time zone, no
           local time adjustment is made.

           You can remove time zone information by calling this method with the value "undef".

       •   truncate( to =&gt; ... )

           This  method  allows  you  to  reset  some of the local time components in the object to their "zero"
           values.  The "to" parameter is used to specify which values to truncate, and it may be one of "year",
           "month", "day", "hour", "minute", or "second".  For example, if "month" is specified, then the  local
           day becomes 1, and the hour, minute, and second all become 0.

           Note that the "to" parameter <b>cannot</b> <b>be</b> <b>"week"</b>.

</pre><h4><b>DATETIME::INCOMPLETE"</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       "DateTime::Incomplete" objects also have a number of methods unique to this class.

       •   base

           Returns the base datetime value, or "undef" if the object has none.

       •   has_base

           Returns a boolean value indicating whether or not the object has a base datetime set.

       •   is_undef

           Returns true if the datetime is completely undefined.

       •   can_be_datetime

           Returns true if the datetime has enough information to be converted to a proper DateTime object.

           The year field must be valid, followed by a sequence of valid fields.

           Examples:

             Can be datetime:
             2003-xx-xxTxx:xx:xx
             2003-10-xxTxx:xx:xx
             2003-10-13Txx:xx:xx

             Can not be datetime:
             2003-10-13Txx:xx:30
             xxxx-10-13Txx:xx:30

       •   set_base

           Sets the base datetime object for the "DateTime::Incomplete" object.

           The default value for "base" is "undef", which means no validation is made on input.

       •   to_datetime

           This method takes an optional "base" parameter and returns a "complete" datetime.

             $dt = $dti-&gt;to_datetime( base =&gt; DateTime-&gt;now );

             $dti-&gt;set_base( DateTime-&gt;now );
             $dt = $dti-&gt;to_datetime;

           The  resulting  datetime  can  be  either before of after the given base datetime. No adjustments are
           made, besides setting the missing fields.

           This method will use "today" if the object has no base datetime set and none is given as an argument.

           This method may die if it results in a datetime that doesn't actually exist, such as February 30, for
           example.

           The fields in the resulting datetime are set in this order: locale,  time_zone,  nanosecond,  second,
           minute, hour, day, month, year.

       •   to_recurrence

           This  method  generates  the  set  of  all  possible  datetimes  that fit into an incomplete datetime
           definition.

             $dti = DateTime::Incomplete-&gt;new( month =&gt; 12, day =&gt; 24 );
             $dtset1 = $dti-&gt;to_recurrence;
             # Christmas recurrence, with _seconds_ resolution

             $dti-&gt;truncate( to =&gt; 'day' );
             $dtset2 = $dti-&gt;to_recurrence;
             # Christmas recurrence, with days resolution (hour/min/sec = 00:00:00)

           Those recurrences are "DateTime::Set" objects:

             $dt_next_xmas = $dti-&gt;to_recurrence-&gt;next( DateTime-&gt;today );

           Incomplete dates that have the year defined will generate finite sets.  This kind of set can  take  a
           lot  of  resources  (RAM  and  CPU).  The following incomplete datetime would generate the set of <u>all</u>
           <u>seconds</u> in 2003:

             2003-xx-xxTxx:xx:xx

           Recurrences are generated with up to 1 second resolution.  The "nanosecond" value is ignored.

       •   to_spanset

           This method generates the set of all possible spans that fit into an incomplete datetime definition.

             $dti = DateTime::Incomplete-&gt;new( month =&gt; 12, day =&gt; 24 );
             $dtset1 = $dti-&gt;to_spanset;
             # Christmas recurrence, from xxxx-12-24T00:00:00
             #                         to xxxx-12-25T00:00:00

       •   start

       •   end

       •   to_span

           These methods view an incomplete datetime as a "time span".

           For example, the incomplete datetime "2003-xx-xxTxx:xx:xx" starts in "2003-01-01T00:00:00"  and  ends
           in "2004-01-01T00:00:00".

           The "to_span" method returns a "DateTime::Span" object.

           An incomplete datetime without an year spans "forever".  Start and end datetimes are "undef".

       •   contains

           Returns a true value if the incomplete datetime range <u>contains</u> a given datetime value.

           For example:

             2003-xx-xx contains 2003-12-24
             2003-xx-xx does not contain 1999-12-14

       •   previous / next / closest

             $dt2 = $dti-&gt;next( $dt );

           The next() returns the first complete date <u>after</u> <u>or</u> <u>equal</u> to the given datetime.

           The previous() returns the first complete date <u>before</u> <u>or</u> <u>equal</u> to the given datetime.

           The closest() returns the closest complete date (previous or next) to the given datetime.

           All of these methods return "undef" if there is no matching complete datetime.

           If no datetime is given, these methods use the "base" datetime.

           Note:  The  definition of previous() and next() is different from the methods of the same name in the
           "DateTime::Set" class.

           The datetimes are generated with 1 nanosecond precision. The last "time" value  of  a  given  day  is
           23:59:59.999999999 (for non leapsecond days).
