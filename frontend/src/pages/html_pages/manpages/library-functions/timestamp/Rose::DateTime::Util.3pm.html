</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Rose::DateTime::Util - Some simple DateTime wrapper functions.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Rose::DateTime::Util qw(:all);

           $now  = parse_date('now');
           $then = parse_date('12/25/2001 11pm');

           print $now-&gt;day_of_week; # e.g., "Monday"

           # "December 25th 2001 at 11:00:00 PM"
           $date_text = format_date($then, "%B %E %Y at %t");

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Rose::DateTime::Util is a thin wrapper around DateTime that provides a very simple date parser and a few
       extra date formatting options.

</pre><h4><b>EXPORTS</b></h4><pre>
       Rose::DateTime::Util does not export any function names by default.

       The 'all' tag:

           use Rose::DateTime::Util qw(:all);

       will cause the following function names to be imported:

           format_date()
           parse_date()
           parse_epoch()
           parse_european_date()

</pre><h4><b>CLASS</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>error</b>
           Returns a message describing the last error that occurred.

       <b>european_dates</b> <b>[BOOL]</b>
           Get  or  set  a  boolean  flag  that  determines  how "xx/xx/xxxx" dates are parsed by the parse_date
           function.  If set to a false-but-defined value, then such dates are parsed as "mm/dd/yyyy".   If  set
           to  true,  then  they're  parsed  as "dd/mm/yyyy".  If set to undef, then the attribute resets to its
           initial value, which is determined as described below.

           The initial value of this attribute is chosen based on the current locale  as  stored  in  DateTime's
           DefaultLocale  setting.   This   initial  value  is  looked  up only once.  Any subsequent changes to
           DateTime's DefaultLocale setting will be ignored until/unless this attribute is reset to undef.

       <b>time_zone</b> <b>[TZ]</b>
           Get or set the default time zone.  This value is passed to DateTime-&gt;new(...) as  the  value  of  the
           "time_zone"  parameter  when  <b>parse_date()</b>  creates  the DateTime object that it returns. The default
           value is "floating".

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>format_date</b> <b>DATETIME,</b> <b>FORMAT1,</b> <b>FORMAT2</b> <b>...</b>
           Takes a DateTime object and a list of format strings.  In list context, it returns a list of  strings
           with  the formats interpolated.  In scalar context, it returns a single string constructed by joining
           all of the list-context return values with single spaces.  Examples:

             # $s = 'Friday 5PM'
             $s = format_date(parse_date('1/23/2004 17:00'), '%A, %I%p');

             # @s = ('Friday', 5, 'PM')
             @s = format_date(parse_date('1/23/2004 17:00'), '%A', '%I', '%p');

             # $s = 'Friday 5 PM'
             $s = format_date(parse_date('1/23/2004 17:00'), '%A', '%I', '%p');

           Returns undef on failure, or if passed an undefined value for DATETIME.  An exception will be  raised
           if the DATETIME argument is defined, but is not a DateTime object.

           The  supported  formats  are  mostly  based  on  those  supported  by DateTime's "strftime()" method.
           Rose::DateTime::Util calls DateTime's "strftime()" method when interpolating these formats.

           Note  that  the  %t  and  %F  formats  are  <u>not</u>  passed  to  "strftime()",   but   are   handled   by
           Rose::DateTime::Util instead.  See the "Non-standard formats" section below.

           The   "strftime()"-compatible   formats   listed  below  have  been  transcribed  from  the  DateTime
           documentation for the sake of convenience, but the DateTime documentation is the definitive source.

           Using any format strings not in the "strftime()"-compatible set will be slightly slower.

           <b>"strftime()"-compatible</b> <b>formats</b>

           •   %a

       <b>parse_european_date</b> <b>TEXT</b> <b>[,</b> <b>TIMEZONE]</b>
           This  function  works  the  same  as  the  parse_date  function, except it forces Eurpoean-style date
           parsing.  In other words, this:

               parse_european_date($date, $tz);

           is equivalent to this:

               # Save old value of the European date setting
               my $save = Rose::DateTime::Util-&gt;european_dates;

               # Turn European date parsing on
               Rose::DateTime::Util-&gt;<a href="../man1/european_dates.1.html">european_dates</a>(1);

               # Parse the date
               parse_date($date, $tz);

               # Restore the old European date setting
               Rose::DateTime::Util-&gt;european_dates($save);

       <b>parse_date</b> <b>TEXT</b> <b>[,</b> <b>TIMEZONE]</b>
           Attempts to parse the date described by TEXT.  Returns a DateTime object, or undef on  failure,  with
           an error message available via Rose::DateTime::Util-&gt;<b>error()</b>.

           If  a  DateTime  object  is passed in place of the TEXT argument, it is returned as-is if there is no
           TIMEZONE argument, or after having set_time_zone(TIMEZONE) called  on  it  if  there  is  a  TIMEZONE
           argument.

           Since  the  time  zone is not part of any of the supported date string formats, <b>parse_date()</b> takes an
           optional TIMEZONE argument which  is  passed  to  the  DateTime  constructor  as  the  value  of  the
           "time_zone"  parameter.   In  the  absence  of  a TIMEZONE argument to "parwse_date()", the time zone
           defaults to the value returned by the <b>time_zone()</b> class method ("floating", by default)

           The formats understood and their interpretations are listed  below.   Square  brackets  are  used  to
           indicate optional portions of the formats.

           now Right now.  Also valid with an exclamation point: "now!"

           today
               Today, at 00:00:00.

           yyyy mm dd
           yyyy mm dd [hh? am/pm]
           yyyy mm dd [hh?:mm [am/pm]]
           yyyy mm dd [hh?:mm:ss [am/pm]]
           yyyy mm dd [hh?:mm:ss.nnnnnnnnn [am/pm]]
               Exact  date  and  time.   Also  valid  without  spaces,  with  hyphens  ("-"),  periods ("."), or
               underscores ("_") between the year, month, and day, and with a "T", hyphen, period, or underscore
               between the date and time.  The time is optional and defaults to 00:00:00.   The  am/pm  part  is
               optional  unless  only the "hh" (hours) part of the time is specified.  Fractional seconds take a
               maximum of 9 digits, but fewer are also acceptable.

           mm/dd/yyyy [hh[:mm[:ss[.nnnnnnnnn]]]] [am/pm]
               Exact date and time.  Also valid with hyphens ("-"), periods ("."), or underscores ("_")  instead
               of  slashes  ("/"), and with a "T", hyphen, period, or underscore between the date and time.  The
               time is optional and defaults to 00:00:00.  The am/pm part is optional.  Fractional seconds  take
               a maximum of 9 digits, but fewer are also acceptable.

               This format is only valid when european_dates is set to <b>false</b> (which is the default).

           dd/mm/yyyy [hh[:mm[:ss[.nnnnnnnnn]]]] [am/pm]
               Exact  date and time.  Also valid with hyphens ("-"), periods ("."), or underscores ("_") instead
               of slashes ("/").  The time is optional and defaults to 00:00:00.  The am/pm  part  is  optional.
               Fractional seconds take a maximum of 9 digits, but fewer are also acceptable.

               This format is only valid when european_dates is set to <b>true</b>.

           [-]infinity
               Positive or negative infinity.  Case insensitive.

           [-]dddddddddd[.nnnnnnnnn] seconds)
               A  positive  or  negative number with optional fractional seconds is interpreted as seconds since
               the Unix epoch.  Fractional seconds take a maximum of 9 digits, but fewer are also acceptable.

       <b>parse_epoch</b> <b>TEXT</b> <b>[,</b> <b>TIMEZONE]</b>
           This function is the same as parse_date except that it prefers Unix epoch values in cases where  this
           format conflicts with another.  Example:

               $arg = '19991231';

               $dt = parse_date($arg);  # Dec 31, 1999
               $dt = parse_epoch($arg); # Aug 20, 1970
