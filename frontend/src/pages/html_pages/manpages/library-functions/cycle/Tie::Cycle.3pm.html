</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Tie::Cycle - Cycle through a list of values via a scalar.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
               use v5.10;
               use Tie::Cycle;

               tie my $cycle, 'Tie::Cycle', [ qw( FFFFFF 000000 FFFF00 ) ];

               say $cycle; # FFFFFF
               say $cycle; # 000000
               say $cycle; # FFFF00
               say $cycle; # FFFFFF  back to the beginning

               (tied $cycle)-&gt;reset;  # back to the beginning

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       You use "Tie::Cycle" to go through a list over and over again.  Once you get to the end of the list, you
       go back to the beginning.  You don't have to worry about any of this since the magic of tie does that for
       you.

       The tie takes an array reference as its third argument. The tie should succeed unless the argument is not
       an array reference.  Previous versions required you to use an array that had more than one element
       (what's the pointing of looping otherwise?), but I've removed that restriction since the number of
       elements you want to use may change depending on the situation.

       During the tie, this module makes a shallow copy of the array reference. If the array reference contains
       references, and those references are changed after the tie, the elements of the cycle will change as
       well. See the included <u>test.pl</u> script for an example of this effect.

</pre><h4><b>OBJECT</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       You can call methods on the underlying object (which you access with tied() ).

       reset
           Roll  the  iterator back to the starting position. The next access will give the first element in the
           list.

       previous
           Give the previous element. This does not affect the current position.

       next
           Give the next element. This does not affect the current position.  You can peek at the  next  element
           if you like.
