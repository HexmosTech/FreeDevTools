</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Text::Names - Perl extension for proper name parsing, normalization, recognition, and classification

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Text::Names qw/parseNames samePerson/;

           my @authors = parseNames("D Bourget, Zbigniew Z Lukasiak and John Doe");

           # @authors = ('Bourget, D.','Lukasiak, Zbigniew Z.','Doe, John')

           print "same!" if samePerson("Dave Bourget","David F. Bourget");

           # same!

           print guessGender("David");

           # "M"

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This modules provides a number of name normalization routines, plus high-level parsing and name
       comparison utilities such as those illustrated in the synopsis.

       While it tries to accommodate non-Western names, this module definitely works better with Western names,
       especially English-style names.

       No subroutine is exported by default.

       This modules normalizes names to this format:

       Lastname(s) [Jr], Given name(s)

       Some examples:

       1) Bourget, David Joseph Richard

       2) Bourget Jr, David

       3) Bourget, D. J. R.

       These are all normalized names. This format is what is referred to as the normalized representation of a
       name here.

</pre><h4><b>SUBROUTINES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>abbreviationOf(string</b> <b>name1,string</b> <b>name2):</b> <b>boolean</b>
       Returns true iff name1 is a common abbreviation of name2 in English. For example, 'Dave' is a common
       abbreviation of 'David'. The list of abbreviations used includes a number of old abbreviations such as
       'Davy' for 'David'.

   <b>cleanName(string</b> <b>name):</b> <b>string</b>
       Like parseName, but a) returns the normalized form of the name instead of an array, and b) does
       additional cleaning-up. To be preferred to parseName in most cases and by default if processing variable
       or dubious data.

   <b>composeName(string</b> <b>given,</b> <b>string</b> <b>last):</b> <b>string</b>
       Returns the name in the "last, given" format.

   <b>isCommonFirstname(string</b> <b>name,</b> <b>[float</b> <b>threshold]):</b> <b>boolean</b>
       Returns true if the name is among the 1000 most popular firstnames (male or female) according to the 1990
       US Census. If a threshold percentage is passed, the name must have at least this frequency for the
       subroutine to return true. See <a href="http://www.census.gov/genealogy/www/data/1990surnames/names_files.html">http://www.census.gov/genealogy/www/data/1990surnames/names_files.html</a>.

   <b>isCommonSurname(string</b> <b>name,</b> <b>[float</b> <b>threshold]):</b> <b>boolean</b>
       Returns true if the name is among the 1000 most popular surnames according to the 1990 US Census. If a
       threshold percentage is passed, the name must have at least this frequency for the subroutine to return
       true. See <a href="http://www.census.gov/genealogy/www/data/1990surnames/names_files.html">http://www.census.gov/genealogy/www/data/1990surnames/names_files.html</a>.

   <b>firstnamePrevalence(string</b> <b>name):</b> <b>float</b> <b>[0-100]</b>
       Returns a float between 0 and 100 indicating how common the firstname is according to the 1990 US Census.
       Names that are not in the top 1000 return 0.

   <b>surnamePrevalence(string</b> <b>name):</b> <b>float</b> <b>[0-100]</b>
       Returns a float between 0 and 100 indicating how common the surname is according to the 1990 US Census.
       Names that are not in the top 1000 return 0.

   <b>normalizeNameWhitespace(string</b> <b>name):</b> <b>string</b>
       Normalizes the whitespace within a name. This is mainly for internal usage.

   <b>parseName(string</b> <b>name):</b> <b>array</b>
       Takes a name in one of the multiple formats that one can write a name in, and returns it as an array
       representing the post-comma and pre-comma parts of its normalized form (in that order). For example,
       parseName("David Bourget") returns ('David','Bourget').

   <b>parseName2(string</b> <b>name):</b> <b>array</b>
       Use on already-normalized names to split them into four parts: full given names, initials, last names,
       and suffix. The only 'suffix' recognied is 'Jr'.

   <b>parseNameList(array</b> <b>names):</b> <b>array</b>
       Takes an array of names (as strings) and returns an array of normalized representations of the names in
       the array.

   <b>parseNames(string</b> <b>names):</b> <b>array</b>
       Takes a string of names as parameter and returns an array of normalized representations of the names in
       the string. This routine understands a wide variety of formattings for names and lists of names typically
       found as list of authors in bibliographic citations. See the test 03-parseNames.t for multiple examples.

   <b>reverseName(string</b> <b>name):</b> <b>string</b>
       Given a normalized name of the form "last, given", returns "given last".

   <b>samePerson(string</b> <b>name1,</b> <b>string</b> <b>name2):</b> <b>string</b>
       Returns a true value iff name1 and name2 could reasonably be two writings of the same name. For example,
       'D J Bourget' could reasonably be a writing of 'David Joseph Bourget'. So could 'D Bourget'. But 'D F
       Bourget' is not a reasonable writing of 'David Joseph Bourget'. The value returned is a (potentially new)
       name string which combines the most complete tokens of the two submitted name strings.

       Contrary to what one might expect, this subroutine does not use <b>weakenings()</b> behind the scenes. Another
       way to check for name compatibility would be to check that two names have a weakening in common (probably
       too permissive for most purposes) or that one name is a weakening of the other.

   <b>setNameAbbreviations(array):</b> <b>undef</b>
       Sets the abbreviation mapping used to determine whether, say, 'David' and 'Dave' are compatible name
       parts. The mapping is also used by <b>abbreviationOf()</b>. The format of the array should be: 'Dave', 'David',
       'Davy', 'David', etc, otherwise representable in Perl as 'Dave' =&gt; 'David', 'Davy' =&gt; 'David', etc.

   <b>getNameAbbreviations</b>
       Returns the abbreviation mapping.

   <b>weakenings(string</b> <b>first_name,</b> <b>string</b> <b>last_name):</b> <b>array</b>
       Returns an array of normalized names which are weakenings of the first and last name passed as argument.
       Substituting a given names by an initial, or removing an initial, for example, are operations which
       generate weakenings of a name. Such operations are applied with arbitrary depth, until the name has been
       reduced to a single initial followed by the lastname, and all intermediary steps returned.

       You can use weakenings(parseName("Lastname, Firstname")) to weaken a first and last name as a single
       string.

   <b>guessGender(string</b> <b>firstname,</b> <b>[float</b> <b>threshold]):</b> <b>string</b>
       Returns 'F' if someone with the provided firstname is likely female, 'M' if likely male, and undef
       otherwise. A frequency threshold (default = 0) can be specified so that a gender is returned only if the
       name is found with at least this frequency among people with this gender (according to the US census). A
       threshold of 0.1 (which means 0.1%) ensures very reliable results (precision above 99%) with a recall of
       about 60%. When the threshold is lower, this function has a tendency to overestimate the number of
       females.

</pre><h4><b>EXPORT</b></h4><pre>
       None by default.

</pre><h4><b>KNOWN</b> <b>ISSUES</b></h4><pre>
       This module currently overwrites @Text::Capitalize::exceptions globally, which can have unintended side-
       effects.
