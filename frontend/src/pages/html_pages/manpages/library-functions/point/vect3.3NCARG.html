</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       VECT3 - Defines the second and all subsequent points in a sequence of points connected by straight-line
       segments, the projections of which are to be drawn. (FRST3 is called for the first point in the sequence
       and VECT3 is called for the rest.)

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       CALL VECT3 (U,V,W)

</pre><h4><b>C-BINDING</b> <b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;ncarg/ncargC.h&gt;

       void c_vect3 (float u, float v, float w)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       U,V,W       (input  expressions of type REAL) are the coordinates of a point in 3-space to the projection
                   of which a line is to be drawn.

       Each call to FRST3 moves a conceptual "pen" to the new starting point for a sequence of line draws.  Each
       call to VECT3 draws a line from the current pen position to a new pen position and then  makes  that  the
       current pen position.

       Line  segments are drawn in the current polyline color, as determined by the last call to the GKS routine
       GSPLCI; by default, color index 1 is used.  Line width is determined by the last call to the GKS  routine
       GSLWSC; by default, the value of the line width scale factor is 1.

       Note  that  the routines FRST3 and VECT3 do not flush the SPPS pen-move buffer.  In fact, to have them do
       so would entirely defeat the purpose of that buffer.  Therefore, if your last call  was  to  the  routine
       VECT3  and you are about to call GKS routines to change color or line width, you must first call the SPPS
       routine PLOTIF to flush the buffer; otherwise, the color and line width changes will  affect  line  draws
       flushed from the buffer later.

</pre><h4><b>C-BINDING</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The C-binding argument descriptions are the same as the FORTRAN argument descriptions.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Use the ncargex command to see the following relevant examples: fthex01, fthex02, fthex03.

</pre><h4><b>ACCESS</b></h4><pre>
       To  use  VECT3  or c_vect3, load the NCAR Graphics libraries ncarg, ncarg_gks, and ncarg_c, preferably in
       that order.
