</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       FRSTD - Defines the first of a sequence of points through which a curve is to be drawn.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       CALL FRSTD (X,Y)

</pre><h4><b>C-BINDING</b> <b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;ncarg/ncargC.h&gt;

       void c_frstd (float x, float y)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       X           (an input expression of type REAL) defines the X user coordinate of the starting point of the
                   curve.

       Y           (an input expression of type REAL) defines the Y user coordinate of the starting point of the
                   curve.

</pre><h4><b>C-BINDING</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The C-binding argument descriptions are the same as the FORTRAN argument descriptions.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       One  way  to  draw a curve with Dashline is to call FRSTD once to define the first point of the curve and
       then to call VECTD repeatedly to define the second and all following points of the curve.

       If three or more distinct points are given, and if one of the smoothing versions  of  Dashline  is  being
       used,  and if the internal parameter that suppresses smoothing is not set, then splines under tension are
       used to generate a smooth curve; the number of points actually used to draw the curve will depend on  its
       length.  In all other cases, the "curve" will be approximated by just connecting the user-given points in
       the specified order.

       After  the  call  to  VECTD  defining  the last point of the curve, you may call LASTD, which flushes any
       portions of smoothed curves that are defined by coordinates saved in internal buffers of FRSTD and  VECTD
       and  that  have  not  yet  been drawn.  Calls to LASTD are not always required - for example, when a non-
       smoothing version of Dashline is used (no buffering) or when the next call to an  NCAR  Graphics  routine
       will  be  to FRSTD (which flushes the buffers) - but unnecessary calls do no harm.  If you judge that one
       of the smoothing versions of Dashline may be used, it is best to put in the calls to LASTD.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Use the ncargex command to see the following relevant examples: tdashc, tdashl, tdashp, tdashs, fdldashc,
       fdldashd.

</pre><h4><b>ACCESS</b></h4><pre>
       To use FRSTD or c_frstd load the NCAR Graphics libraries ncarg, ncarg_gks,  and  ncarg_c,  preferably  in
       that order.
