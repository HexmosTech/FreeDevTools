</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Pod::Weaver::Role::Preparer - something that mucks about with the input before weaving begins

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 4.020

</pre><h4><b>PERL</b> <b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This module should work on any version of perl still receiving updates from the Perl 5 Porters.  This
       means it should work on any version of perl released in the last two to three years.  (That is, if the
       most recently released version is v5.40, then this module should work on both v5.40 and v5.38.)

       Although it may work on older versions of perl, no guarantee is made that the minimum required version
       will not be increased.  The version may be increased for any reason, and there is no promise that patches
       will be accepted to lower the minimum required perl.

</pre><h4><b>IMPLEMENTING</b></h4><pre>
       The Preparer role indicates that a plugin will be used to pre-process the input hashref before weaving
       begins.  The plugin must provide a "prepare_input" method which will be called with the input hashref.
       It is expected to modify the input in place.
