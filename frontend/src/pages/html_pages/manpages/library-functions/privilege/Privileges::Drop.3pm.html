</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Privileges::Drop - A module to make it simple to drop all privileges, even POSIX groups.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module tries to simplify the process of dropping privileges. This can be useful when your Perl
       program needs to bind to privileged ports, etc. This module is much like Proc::UID, except that it's
       implemented in pure Perl.  Special care has been taken to also drop saved uid on platforms that support
       this, currently only test on on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Privileges::Drop;

         # Do privileged stuff

         # Drops privileges and sets euid/uid to 1000 and egid/gid to 1000.
         drop_uidgid(1000, 1000);

         # Drop privileges to user nobody looking up gid and uid with getpwname
         # This also set the environment variables USER, LOGNAME, HOME and SHELL.
         drop_privileges('nobody');

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       drop_uidgid($uid, $gid, @groups)
           Drops privileges and sets euid/uid to $uid and egid/gid to $gid.

           Supplementary groups can be set in @groups.

       drop_privileges($user)
           Drops  privileges  to the $user, looking up gid and uid with getpwname and calling <b>drop_uidgid()</b> with
           these arguments.

           The environment variables USER, LOGNAME, HOME and SHELL are  also  set  to  the  values  returned  by
           getpwname.

           Returns the $uid and $gid on success and dies on error.

           NOTE: If <b>drop_privileges()</b> is called when you don't have root privileges it will just return undef;

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       As  this  module  only  uses  Perl's  built-in functions, it relies on them to work correctly. That means
       setting $GID and $EGID should also call <b>setgroups()</b>, something that might not have been the  case  before
       Perl 5.004. So if you are running an older version, Proc::UID might be a better choice.
