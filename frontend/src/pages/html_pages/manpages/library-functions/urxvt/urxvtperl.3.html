</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       urxvtperl - rxvt-unicode's embedded perl interpreter

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
          # create a file grab_test in some directory:

          sub on_sel_grab {
             warn "you selected ", $_[0]-&gt;selection;
             ()
          }

          # start a urxvt instance using it:

          urxvt --perl-lib path/to/somedirectory -pe grab_test

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Every time a terminal object gets created, extension scripts specified via the "perl" resource are loaded
       and associated with it.

       Scripts are compiled in a 'use strict qw(vars subs)' and 'use utf8' environment, and thus must be encoded
       as UTF-8.

       Each script will only ever be loaded once, even in urxvtd, where scripts will be shared (but not enabled)
       for all terminals.

       You can disable the embedded perl interpreter by setting both "perl-ext" and "perl-ext-common" resources
       to the empty string.

</pre><h4><b>PREPACKAGED</b> <b>EXTENSIONS</b></h4><pre>
       A number of extensions are delivered with this release. You can find them in <u>&lt;libdir&gt;/urxvt/perl/</u>, and
       the documentation can be viewed using <u>man</u> <u>urxvt-&lt;EXTENSIONNAME&gt;</u>.

       You can activate them like this:

         urxvt -pe &lt;extensionname&gt;

       Or by adding them to the resource for extensions loaded by default:

         URxvt.perl-ext-common: default,selection-autotransform

       Extensions may add additional resources and "actions", i.e., methods which can be bound to a key and
       invoked by the user. An extension can define the resources it support using so called META comments,
       described below. Similarly to builtin resources, extension resources can also be specified on the command
       line as long options (with "."  replaced by "-"), in which case the corresponding extension is loaded
       automatically. For this to work the extension <b>must</b> define META comments for its resources.

</pre><h4><b>API</b> <b>DOCUMENTATION</b></h4><pre>
   <b>General</b> <b>API</b> <b>Considerations</b>
       All objects (such as terminals, time watchers etc.) are typical reference-to-hash objects. The hash can
       be used to store anything you like. All members starting with an underscore (such as "_ptr" or "_hook")
       are reserved for internal uses and <b>MUST</b> <b>NOT</b> be accessed or modified).

       When objects are destroyed on the C++ side, the perl object hashes are emptied, so its best to store
       related objects such as time watchers and the like inside the terminal object so they get destroyed as
       soon as the terminal is destroyed.

       Argument names also often indicate the type of a parameter. Here are some hints on what they mean:

       $text
           Rxvt-unicode's  special  way  of  encoding  text, where one "unicode" character always represents one
           screen cell. See ROW_t for a discussion of this format.

       $string
           A perl text string, with an emphasis on <u>text</u>. It can store  all  unicode  characters  and  is  to  be
           distinguished with text encoded in a specific encoding (often locale-specific) and binary data.

       $octets
           Either binary data or - more common - a text string encoded in a locale-specific way.

       $keysym
           an  integer  that is a valid X11 keysym code. You can convert a string into a keysym and viceversa by
           using "XStringToKeysym" and "XKeysymToString".

   <b>Extension</b> <b>Objects</b>
       Every perl extension is a perl class. A separate perl object is  created  for  each  terminal,  and  each
       terminal  has  its  own  set  of  extension objects, which are passed as the first parameter to hooks. So
       extensions can use their $self object without having to think about  clashes  with  other  extensions  or
       other  terminals,  with the exception of methods and members that begin with an underscore character "_":
       these are reserved for internal use.

       Although it isn't a "urxvt::term" object, you can call all methods of the  "urxvt::term"  class  on  this
       object.

       Additional  methods  only supported for extension objects are described in the "urxvt::extension" section
       below.

   <b>META</b> <b>comments</b>
       Rxvt-unicode recognizes special meta comments in extensions that  define  different  types  of  metadata.
       These  comments  are scanned whenever a terminal is created and are typically used to autoload extensions
       when their resources or command line parameters are used.

       Currently, it recognises these comments below. Individual components are separated by colons  (":"),  and
       should not contain colons themselves - there is also currently no escaping mechanism provided for this.

       #:META:RESOURCE:name:type:desc
           The  RESOURCE  comment  defines  a resource used by the extension, where "name" is the resource name,
           "type" is the resource type, "boolean" or "string", and "desc" is the resource description.

           The extension will be autoloaded when this resource is specified or used as a command line parameter.

           Example: matcher provides the "matcher.launcher" resource by having this comment:

              #:META:RESOURCE:%.launcher:string:default launcher command

           Example: load this extension when the "-tr" command line option or resource name is used.

              #:META:RESOURCE:tr:boolean:set root pixmap as background

       #:META:OSC:number:desc
           The OSC comment specifies an OSC sequence, where "number" is the numerical OSC code and "desc"  is  a
           short description that is currently unused.

           This will cause the extension to be autoloaded when the OSC sequence is used for the first time.

           Note  that  autoloading  carries  some  extra  responsibilities with it: although the terminal cannot
           really protect itself against malicious sources  of  command  sequences,  therefore  relying  on  the
           programs  running  <u>inside</u>  to  sanitize data that they output, it is very common for programs to emit
           command sequences from untrusted sources.

           While this means that extensions should, as a defense-in-depth mechanism, always consider whether OSC
           sequences are safe, autoloading automatically  exposes  any  autoloaded  extension  in  all  terminal
           windows, so extra care should be taken.

           Example: the background extension registers OSC 20 like this:

              #:META:OSC:20:change/query background image

       #:META:OSC_PERL:prefix:desc
           The same as the OSC comment, but for the Perl OSC sequence (777). The "prefix" should be unique among
           extensions,  of  course,  which is most easily arranged by using the extension name, although this is
           not required.

           Example: the overlay-osc extension registers its Perl OSC like this:

              #:META:OSC_PERL:overlay:man overlay-osc

   <b>Hooks</b>
       The following subroutines can be declared in extension files, and will be called  whenever  the  relevant
       event happens.

       The  first  argument passed to them is an extension object as described in the in the "Extension Objects"
       section.

       <b>All</b> of these hooks must return a boolean value. If any of the called hooks returns true, then  the  event
       counts as being <u>consumed</u>, and the relevant action might not be carried out by the C++ code.

       <u>When</u> <u>in</u> <u>doubt,</u> <u>return</u> <u>a</u> <u>false</u> <u>value</u> <u>(preferably</u> <u>"()").</u>

       on_attach $term
           Called  when an extension package is attached to a running terminal instance. Must return true in all
           cases, and runs with the same limitations as "on_init".

           Unlike "on_init" or "on_start", this is  called  when  the  extension  is  attached  to  a  terminal,
           regardless  of  whether  the  extension is loaded before or after the terminal is started. Extensions
           that need to do something before they work can do it in this callback, as opposed to e.g.  "on_init",
           which might not be called.

       on_init $term
           Called after a new terminal object has been initialized,  but  before  windows  are  created  or  the
           command  gets  run.  Most  methods are unsafe to call or deliver senseless data, as terminal size and
           other characteristics have not yet been determined. You can safely query  and  change  resources  and
           options, though. For many purposes the "on_start" hook is a better place.

       on_start $term
           Called  at  the very end of initialisation of a new terminal, just before trying to map (display) the
           toplevel and returning to the main loop.

       on_destroy $term
           Called whenever something tries to destroy terminal, when the terminal is still fully functional (not
           for long, though).

       on_reset $term
           Called after the screen is "reset" for any reason, such as resizing or  control  sequences.  Here  is
           where you can react on changes to size-related variables.

       on_child_start $term, $pid
           Called just after the child process has been "fork"ed.

       on_child_exit $term, $status
           Called just after the child process has exited. $status is the status from "waitpid".

       on_sel_make $term, $eventtime
           Called  whenever  a  selection has been made by the user, but before the selection text is copied, so
           changes to the beginning, end or type of the selection will be honored.

           Returning a true value aborts selection making by urxvt, in which case you have to make  a  selection
           yourself by calling "$term-&gt;selection_grab".

       on_sel_grab $term, $eventtime
           Called  whenever  a selection has been copied, but before the selection is requested from the server.
           The selection text can be queried and changed by calling "$term-&gt;selection".

           Returning a true value aborts selection grabbing. It will still be highlighted.

       on_sel_extend $term
           Called whenever the user tries to extend the selection (e.g. with  a  double  click)  and  is  either
           supposed to return false (normal operation), or should extend the selection itself and return true to
           suppress  the  built-in  processing.  This can happen multiple times, as long as the callback returns
           true, it will be called on every further click by the user and is supposed to enlarge  the  selection
           more and more, if possible.

           See the <u>selection</u> example extension.

       on_view_change $term, $offset
           Called whenever the view offset changes, i.e. the user or program scrolls. Offset 0 means display the
           normal terminal, positive values show this many lines of scrollback.

       on_scroll_back $term, $lines, $saved
           Called  whenever  lines  scroll  out  of  the terminal area into the scrollback buffer. $lines is the
           number of lines scrolled out and may be larger than the scroll back buffer or the terminal.

           It is called before lines are scrolled out (so rows 0 .. min ($lines - 1, $nrow -  1)  represent  the
           lines to be scrolled out). $saved is the total number of lines that will be in the scrollback buffer.

       on_osc_seq $term, $op, $args, $resp
           Called  on  every  OSC  sequence  and can be used to suppress it or modify its behaviour. The default
           should be to return an empty list. A true value suppresses execution of the request completely.  Make
           sure  you  don't  get  confused  by recursive invocations when you output an OSC sequence within this
           callback.

           "on_osc_seq_perl" should be used for new behaviour.

       on_osc_seq_perl $term, $args, $resp
           Called whenever the <b>ESC</b> <b>]</b> <b>777</b> <b>;</b> <b>prefix</b> <b>;</b> <b>string</b> <b>ST</b> command sequence (OSC = operating system  command)
           is  processed.  Cursor  position  and  other  state  information is up-to-date when this happens. For
           interoperability, the argument should start with  the  extension  name  (sans  -osc)  or  some  other
           suitable prefix, and a semicolon, to distinguish it from commands for other extensions.

           For example, "overlay-osc" uses this:

              sub on_osc_seq_perl {
                 my ($self, $osc, $resp) = @_;

                 return unless $osc =~ s/^overlay;//;

                 ... process remaining $osc string
              }

           Be careful not ever to trust (in a security sense) the data you receive, as its source can not easily
           be controlled (e-mail content, messages from other users on the same system etc.).

           For responses, $resp contains the end-of-args separator used by the sender.

       on_add_lines $term, $string
           Called  whenever  text  is  about  to be output, with the text as argument. You can filter/change and
           output the text yourself by returning a  true  value  and  calling  "$term-&gt;scr_add_lines"  yourself.
           Please note that this might be very slow, however, as your hook is called for <b>all</b> text being output.

       on_tt_write $term, $octets
           Called whenever some data is written to the tty/pty and can be used to suppress or filter tty input.

       on_tt_paste $term, $octets
           Called  whenever  text  is  about  to be pasted, with the text as argument. You can filter/change and
           paste the text yourself by returning a true value and calling "$term-&gt;tt_paste" yourself. $octets  is
           locale-encoded.

       on_line_update $term, $row
           Called  whenever  a  line was updated or changed. Can be used to filter screen output (e.g. underline
           urls or other useless stuff). Only lines  that  are  being  shown  will  be  filtered,  and,  due  to
           performance reasons, not always immediately.

           The row number is always the topmost row of the line if the line spans multiple rows.

           Please  note  that,  if  you  change the line, then the hook might get called later with the already-
           modified line (e.g. if unrelated parts change), so you cannot just toggle rendition  bits,  but  only
           set them.

       on_refresh_begin $term
           Called  just  before the screen gets redrawn. Can be used for overlay or similar effects by modifying
           the terminal contents in refresh_begin, and restoring them in refresh_end. The built-in  overlay  and
           selection display code is run after this hook, and takes precedence.

       on_refresh_end $term
           Called just after the screen gets redrawn. See "on_refresh_begin".

       on_action $term, $string
           Called  whenever  an action is invoked for the corresponding extension (e.g. via a "extension:string"
           builtin action bound to a key, see description of the <b>keysym</b> resource in the <b><a href="../man1/urxvt.1.html">urxvt</a></b>(1)  manpage).  The
           event  is  simply  the  action  string.  Note  that  an action event is always associated to a single
           extension.

       on_user_command $term, $string *DEPRECATED*
           Called whenever a user-configured event is being activated (e.g. via a "perl:string" action bound  to
           a key, see description of the <b>keysym</b> resource in the <b><a href="../man1/urxvt.1.html">urxvt</a></b>(1) manpage).

           The  event is simply the action string. This interface is going away in preference to the "on_action"
           hook.

       on_resize_all_windows $term, $new_width, $new_height
           Called just after the new window size has been calculated, but  before  windows  are  actually  being
           resized  or  hints  are  being set. If this hook returns a true value, setting of the window hints is
           being skipped.

       on_x_event $term, $event
           Called on every X event received on the vt window (and possibly other windows). Should only  be  used
           as a last resort. Most event structure members are not passed.

       on_root_event $term, $event
           Like "on_x_event", but is called for events on the root window.

       on_focus_in $term
           Called whenever the window gets the keyboard focus, before rxvt-unicode does focus in processing.

       on_focus_out $term
           Called whenever the window loses keyboard focus, before rxvt-unicode does focus out processing.

       on_configure_notify $term, $event
       on_property_notify $term, $event
       on_key_press $term, $event, $keysym, $octets
       on_key_release $term, $event, $keysym
       on_button_press $term, $event
       on_button_release $term, $event
       on_motion_notify $term, $event
       on_map_notify $term, $event
       on_unmap_notify $term, $event
           Called  whenever  the  corresponding  X event is received for the terminal. If the hook returns true,
           then the event will be ignored by rxvt-unicode.

           The event is a hash with most values as named by Xlib (see the XEvent manpage), with  the  additional
           members  "row"  and  "col",  which  are  the  (real, not screen-based) row and column under the mouse
           cursor.

           "on_key_press" additionally receives the string rxvt-unicode would output, if any, in locale-specific
           encoding.

       on_client_message $term, $event
       on_wm_protocols $term, $event
       on_wm_delete_window $term, $event
           Called when various types of ClientMessage events are received (all with format=32,  WM_PROTOCOLS  or
           WM_PROTOCOLS:WM_DELETE_WINDOW).

       on_bell $term
           Called on receipt of a bell character.

   <b>Variables</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>"urxvt"</b> <b>Package</b>
       $urxvt::LIBDIR
           The  rxvt-unicode  library  directory,  where,  among  other things, the perl modules and scripts are
           stored.

       $urxvt::RESCLASS, $urxvt::RESCLASS
           The resource class and name rxvt-unicode uses to look up X resources.

       $urxvt::RXVTNAME
           The basename of the installed binaries, usually "urxvt".

       $urxvt::TERM
           The current terminal. This variable stores the current "urxvt::term" object, whenever a callback/hook
           is executing.

       @urxvt::TERM_INIT
           All code references in this array will be called as methods of the next newly  created  "urxvt::term"
           object  (during  the "on_init" phase). The array gets cleared before the code references that were in
           it are being executed, so references can push themselves onto it again if they so desire.

           This complements to the perl-eval command line option, but gets executed first.

       @urxvt::TERM_EXT
           Works similar to @TERM_INIT, but contains perl package/class names, which get  registered  as  normal
           extensions  after calling the hooks in @TERM_INIT but before other extensions. Gets cleared just like
           @TERM_INIT.

   <b>Functions</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>"urxvt"</b> <b>Package</b>
       urxvt::fatal $errormessage
           Fatally aborts execution with the given error message (which  should  include  a  trailing  newline).
           Avoid  at  all  costs!  The  only  time this is acceptable (and useful) is in the init hook, where it
           prevents the terminal from starting up.

       urxvt::warn $string
           Calls "rxvt_warn" with the given string which should include a  trailing  newline.  The  module  also
           overwrites the "warn" builtin with a function that calls this function.

           Using this function has the advantage that its output ends up in the correct place, e.g. on stderr of
           the connecting urxvtc client.

           Messages have a size limit of 1023 bytes currently.

       @terms = urxvt::termlist
           Returns  all  urxvt::term objects that exist in this process, regardless of whether they are started,
           being destroyed etc., so be careful. Only term objects that have perl  extensions  attached  will  be
           returned (because there is no urxvt::term object associated with others).

       $time = urxvt::NOW
           Returns the "current time" (as per the event loop).

       urxvt::CurrentTime
       urxvt::ShiftMask, LockMask, ControlMask, Mod1Mask, Mod2Mask, Mod3Mask, Mod4Mask, Mod5Mask, Button1Mask,

       ResizeRequest, CirculateNotify, CirculateRequest, PropertyNotify, SelectionClear, SelectionRequest,
       SelectionNotify, ColormapNotify, ClientMessage, MappingNotify
           Various constants for use in X calls and event processing.

   <b>RENDITION</b>
       Rendition  bitsets  contain  information about colour, font, font styles and similar information for each
       screen cell.

       The following "macros" deal with changes in rendition sets. You should never just create  a  bitset,  you
       should  always  modify  an  existing  one,  as  they  contain  important information required for correct
       operation of rxvt-unicode.

       $rend = urxvt::DEFAULT_RSTYLE
           Returns the default rendition, as used when the terminal is starting up or being reset. Useful  as  a
           base to start when creating renditions.

       $rend = urxvt::OVERLAY_RSTYLE
           Return the rendition mask used for overlays by default.

       $rendbit = urxvt::RS_Bold, urxvt::RS_Italic, urxvt::RS_Blink, urxvt::RS_RVid, urxvt::RS_Uline
           Return the bit that enabled bold, italic, blink, reverse-video and underline, respectively. To enable
           such a style, just logically OR it into the bitset.

       $foreground = urxvt::GET_BASEFG $rend
       $background = urxvt::GET_BASEBG $rend
           Return the foreground/background colour index, respectively.

       $rend = urxvt::SET_FGCOLOR $rend, $new_colour
       $rend = urxvt::SET_BGCOLOR $rend, $new_colour
       $rend = urxvt::SET_COLOR $rend, $new_fg, $new_bg
           Replace the foreground/background colour in the rendition mask with the specified one.

       $value = urxvt::GET_CUSTOM $rend
           Return  the  "custom"  value:  Every  rendition has 5 bits for use by extensions. They can be set and
           changed as you like and are initially zero.

       $rend = urxvt::SET_CUSTOM $rend, $new_value
           Change the custom value.

   <b>The</b> <b>"urxvt::term::extension"</b> <b>class</b>
       Each extension attached to a terminal object is represented by a "urxvt::term::extension" object.

       You can use these objects, which are passed to all callbacks to store any state related to  the  terminal
       and extension instance.

       The  methods  (And data members) documented below can be called on extension objects, in addition to call
       methods documented for the &lt;urxvt::term&gt; class.

       $urxvt_term = $self-&gt;{term}
           Returns the "urxvt::term" object associated with this instance of the extension. This member <u>must</u> <u>not</u>
           be changed in any way.

       $self-&gt;enable ($hook_name =&gt; $cb[, $hook_name =&gt; $cb..])
           Dynamically enable the given hooks (named without the "on_" prefix) for this extension, replacing any
           hook previously installed via "enable" in this extension.

           This is useful when you want to overwrite time-critical hooks only temporarily.

           To install additional callbacks for the same hook, you can use the "on" method of  the  "urxvt::term"
           class.

       $self-&gt;disable ($hook_name[, $hook_name..])
           Dynamically disable the given hooks.

       $guard = $self-&gt;on ($hook_name =&gt; $cb[, $hook_name =&gt; $cb..])
           Similar  to the "enable" enable, but installs additional callbacks for the given hook(s) (that is, it
           doesn't replace existing callbacks), and returns a guard object. When the guard object  is  destroyed
           the callbacks are disabled again.

       $self-&gt;bind_action ($hotkey, $action)
       $self-&gt;x_resource ($pattern)
       $self-&gt;x_resource_boolean ($pattern)
           These  methods  support  an additional "%" prefix for $action or $pattern when called on an extension
           object, compared to the "urxvt::term" methods of the same name - see the description of these methods
           in the "urxvt::term" class for details.

   <b>The</b> <b>"urxvt::anyevent"</b> <b>Class</b>
       The sole purpose of this class is to deliver an interface to the "AnyEvent" module - any module using  it
       will  work  inside  urxvt  without  further  programming.  The  only exception is that you cannot wait on
       condition variables, but non-blocking condvar use is ok.

       In practical terms this means is that you cannot use blocking APIs, but the non-blocking  variant  should
       work.

   <b>The</b> <b>"urxvt::term"</b> <b>Class</b>
       $term = new urxvt::term $envhashref, $rxvtname, [arg...]
           Creates  a  new  terminal,  very  similar  as  if you had started it with system "$rxvtname, arg...".
           $envhashref must be a reference to a  %ENV-like  hash  which  defines  the  environment  of  the  new
           terminal.

           Croaks  (and  probably  outputs  an  error message) if the new instance couldn't be created.  Returns
           "undef" if the new instance didn't initialise perl, and the terminal object otherwise. The "init" and
           "start" hooks will be called before this call returns, and are free to refer to global data (which is
           race free).

       $term-&gt;destroy
           Destroy the terminal object (close the window, free resources etc.). Please note that urxvt will  not
           exit as long as any event watchers (timers, io watchers) are still active.

       $term-&gt;exec_async ($cmd[, @args])
           Works  like  the combination of the "fork"/"exec" builtins, which executes ("starts") programs in the
           background. This function takes care of setting the user  environment  before  exec'ing  the  command
           (e.g. "PATH") and should be preferred over explicit calls to "exec" or "system".

           It  also  sets  the  "URXVT_EXT_WINDOWID"  environment  variable  to  the  window  ID of the terminal
           ("$self-&gt;parent"), similar to the  "WINDOWID"  variable  set  for  the  process  spawned  inside  the
           terminal.

           Returns the pid of the subprocess or "undef" on error.

       $isset = $term-&gt;option ($optval[, $set])
           Returns  true  if  the  option  specified by $optval is enabled, and optionally change it. All option
           values are stored by name in the hash %urxvt::OPTION. Options not enabled in this binary are  not  in
           the hash.

           Here is a likely non-exhaustive list of option names, please see the source file <u>/src/optinc.h</u> to see
           the actual list:

       $value = $term-&gt;resource ($name[, $newval])
           Returns  the  current  resource  value  associated with a given name and optionally sets a new value.
           Setting values is most useful in the "init" hook.  Unset  resources  are  returned  and  accepted  as
           "undef".

           The  new  value  must  be properly encoded to a suitable character encoding before passing it to this
           method. Similarly, the returned value may need to be converted from the used encoding to text.

           Resource names are as defined in <u>src/rsinc.h</u>. Colours can be specified as resource names of the  form
           "color+&lt;index&gt;", e.g. "color+5". (will likely change).

           Please  note  that  resource  strings will currently only be freed when the terminal is destroyed, so
           changing options frequently will eat memory.

           Here is a likely non-exhaustive list of resource names, not all  of  which  are  supported  in  every
           build, please see the source file <u>/src/rsinc.h</u> to see the actual list:

       $value = $term-&gt;x_resource ($pattern)
           Returns   the  X-Resource  for  the  given  pattern,  excluding  the  program  or  class  name,  i.e.
           "$term-&gt;x_resource ("boldFont")" should return the same value as  used  by  this  instance  of  rxvt-
           unicode. Returns "undef" if no resource with that pattern exists.

           Extensions that define extra resources also need to call this method to access their values.

           If  the  method  is  called  on  an extension object (basically, from an extension), then the special
           prefix "%." will be replaced by the name of the extension and a dot, and the lone string "%" will  be
           replaced  by  the  extension name itself. This makes it possible to code extensions so you can rename
           them and get a new set of resources without having to change the actual code.

           This method should only be called during the "on_start" hook, as there is only one resource  database
           per display, and later invocations might return the wrong resources.

       $value = $term-&gt;x_resource_boolean ($pattern)
           Like "x_resource", above, but interprets the string value as a boolean and returns 1 for true values,
           0 for false values and "undef" if the resource or option isn't specified.

           You should always use this method to parse boolean resources.

       $action = $term-&gt;lookup_keysym ($keysym, $state)
           Returns  the  action  bound  to  key combination "($keysym, $state)", if a binding for it exists, and
           "undef" otherwise.

       $success = $term-&gt;bind_action ($key, $action)
           Adds a key binding exactly as specified via a "keysym" resource. See the  "keysym"  resource  in  the
           <b><a href="../man1/urxvt.1.html">urxvt</a></b>(1) manpage.

           To  add default bindings for actions, an extension should call "-&gt;bind_action" in its "init" hook for
           every such binding. Doing it in the "init" hook allows users to override or remove the binding again.

           Example: the "searchable-scrollback" by default binds itself on "Meta-s", using "$self-&gt;bind_action",
           which calls "$term-&gt;bind_action".

              sub init {
                 my ($self) = @_;

                 $self-&gt;bind_action ("M-s" =&gt; "%:start");
              }

       $rend = $term-&gt;rstyle ([$new_rstyle])
           Return and optionally change the current rendition. Text that is output by the  terminal  application
           will use this style.

       ($row, $col) = $term-&gt;screen_cur ([$row, $col])
           Return  the  current  coordinates of the text cursor position and optionally set it (which is usually
           bad as applications don't expect that).

       ($row, $col) = $term-&gt;selection_mark ([$row, $col])
       ($row, $col) = $term-&gt;selection_beg ([$row, $col])
       ($row, $col) = $term-&gt;selection_end ([$row, $col])
           Return the current values of the selection mark, begin or end positions.

           When arguments are given, then the selection coordinates are set to $row and $col, and the  selection
           screen is set to the current screen.

       $screen = $term-&gt;selection_screen ([$screen])
           Returns the current selection screen, and then optionally sets it.

       $term-&gt;selection_make ($eventtime[, $rectangular])
           Tries  to  make  a  selection  as set by "selection_beg" and "selection_end". If $rectangular is true
           (default: false), a rectangular selection will be made. This is the  preferred  function  to  make  a
           selection.

       $success = $term-&gt;selection_grab ($eventtime[, $clipboard])
           Try  to acquire ownership of the primary (clipboard if $clipboard is true) selection from the server.
           The corresponding text can be set with the next method.  No  visual  feedback  will  be  given.  This
           function is mostly useful from within "on_sel_grab" hooks.

       $oldtext = $term-&gt;selection ([$newtext, $clipboard])
           Return  the  current  selection  (clipboard  if $clipboard is true) text and optionally replace it by
           $newtext.

       $term-&gt;selection_clear ([$clipboard])
           Revoke ownership of the primary (clipboard if $clipboard is true) selection.

       $term-&gt;overlay_simple ($x, $y, $text)
           Create a simple multi-line overlay box. See the next method for details.

       $term-&gt;overlay ($x, $y, $width, $height[, $rstyle[, $border]])
           Create a new (empty) overlay at the given position with the given width/height. $rstyle  defines  the
           initial rendition style (default: "OVERLAY_RSTYLE").

           If $border is 2 (default), then a decorative border will be put around the box.

           If either $x or $y is negative, then this is counted from the right/bottom side, respectively.

           This  method returns an urxvt::overlay object. The overlay will be visible as long as the perl object
           is referenced.

           The methods currently supported on "urxvt::overlay" objects are:

           $overlay-&gt;set ($x, $y, $text[, $rend])
               Similar to "$term-&gt;ROW_t" and "$term-&gt;ROW_r" in that  it  puts  text  in  rxvt-unicode's  special
               encoding and an array of rendition values at a specific position inside the overlay.

               If $rend is missing, then the rendition will not be changed.

           $overlay-&gt;hide
               If visible, hide the overlay, but do not destroy it.

           $overlay-&gt;show
               If hidden, display the overlay again.

       $popup = $term-&gt;popup ($event)
           Creates  a  new  "urxvt::popup"  object  that  implements  a popup menu. The $event <u>must</u> be the event
           causing the menu to pop up (a button event, currently).

       $cellwidth = $term-&gt;strwidth ($string)
           Returns the number of screen-cells this string would need. Correctly accounts for wide and  combining
           characters.

       $octets = $term-&gt;locale_encode ($string)
           Convert  the  given text string into the corresponding locale encoding. Returns "undef" if $string is
           "undef".

       $string = $term-&gt;locale_decode ($octets)
           Convert the given locale-encoded octets into a perl string. Returns "undef" if $octets is "undef".

       $term-&gt;scr_xor_span ($beg_row, $beg_col, $end_row, $end_col[, $rstyle])
           XORs the rendition values in the given span with the provided value (default: "RS_RVid"), which  <u>MUST</u>
           <u>NOT</u> contain font styles. Useful in refresh hooks to provide effects similar to the selection.

       $term-&gt;scr_xor_rect ($beg_row, $beg_col, $end_row, $end_col[, $rstyle1[, $rstyle2]])
           Similar  to  "scr_xor_span",  but  xors a rectangle instead. Trailing whitespace will additionally be
           xored with the $rstyle2, which defaults to "RS_RVid | RS_Uline", which removes  reverse  video  again
           and underlines it instead. Both styles <u>MUST</u> <u>NOT</u> contain font styles.

       $term-&gt;scr_bell
           Ring the bell!

       $term-&gt;scr_add_lines ($string)
           Write  the  given  text  string  to  the  screen,  as if output by the application running inside the
           terminal. It may not contain command sequences (escape codes - see "cmd_parse" for that), but is free
           to use line feeds, carriage returns and tabs. The string is a normal  text  string,  not  in  locale-
           dependent encoding.

           Normally its not a good idea to use this function, as programs might be confused by changes in cursor
           position or scrolling. Its useful inside a "on_add_lines" hook, though.

       $term-&gt;scr_change_screen ($screen)
           Switch to given screen - 0 primary, 1 secondary.

       $term-&gt;cmd_parse ($octets)
           Similar  to "scr_add_lines", but the argument must be in the locale-specific encoding of the terminal
           and can contain command sequences (escape codes) that will be interpreted.

       $term-&gt;tt_write ($octets)
           Write the octets given in $octets to the tty (i.e. as user input to the program, see "cmd_parse"  for
           the  opposite direction). To pass characters instead of octets, you should convert your strings first
           to the locale-specific encoding using "$term-&gt;locale_encode".

       $term-&gt;tt_write_user_input ($octets)
           Like "tt_write", but should be used when writing strings in response to the user pressing a  key,  to
           invoke the additional actions requested by the user for that case ("tt_write" doesn't do that).

           The typical use case would be inside "on_action" hooks.

       $term-&gt;tt_paste ($octets)
           Write  the octets given in $octets to the tty as a paste, converting NL to CR and bracketing the data
           with control sequences if bracketed paste mode is set.

       $old_events = $term-&gt;pty_ev_events ([$new_events])
           Replaces the event mask of the pty watcher by the given event mask. Can be used to suppress input and
           output handling to the pty/tty. See the description of "urxvt::timer-&gt;events". Make  sure  to  always
           restore the previous value.

       $fd = $term-&gt;pty_fd
           Returns the master file descriptor for the pty in use, or -1 if no pty is used.

       $windowid = $term-&gt;parent
           Return the window id of the toplevel window.

       $windowid = $term-&gt;vt
           Return the window id of the terminal window.

       $term-&gt;vt_emask_add ($x_event_mask)
           Adds  the  specified events to the vt event mask. Useful e.g. when you want to receive pointer events
           all the times:

              $term-&gt;vt_emask_add (urxvt::PointerMotionMask);

       $term-&gt;set_urgency ($set)
           Enable/disable the urgency hint on the toplevel window.

       $term-&gt;focus_in
       $term-&gt;focus_out
       $term-&gt;key_press ($state, $keycode[, $time])
       $term-&gt;key_release ($state, $keycode[, $time])
           Deliver various fake events to to terminal.

       $window_width = $term-&gt;width ([$new_value])
       $window_height = $term-&gt;height ([$new_value])
       $font_width = $term-&gt;fwidth ([$new_value])
       $font_height = $term-&gt;fheight ([$new_value])
       $font_ascent = $term-&gt;fbase ([$new_value])
       $terminal_rows = $term-&gt;nrow ([$new_value])
       $terminal_columns = $term-&gt;ncol ([$new_value])
       $has_focus = $term-&gt;focus ([$new_value])
       $is_mapped = $term-&gt;mapped ([$new_value])
       $max_scrollback = $term-&gt;saveLines ([$new_value])
       $nrow_plus_saveLines = $term-&gt;total_rows ([$new_value])
       $topmost_scrollback_row = $term-&gt;top_row ([$new_value])
           Return various integers describing terminal characteristics. If an argument  is  given,  changes  the
           value and returns the previous one.

       $x_display = $term-&gt;display_id
           Return the DISPLAY used by rxvt-unicode.

       $lc_ctype = $term-&gt;locale
           Returns the LC_CTYPE category string used by this rxvt-unicode.

       $env = $term-&gt;env
           Returns a copy of the environment in effect for the terminal as a hashref similar to "\%ENV".

       @envv = $term-&gt;envv
           Returns the environment as array of strings of the form "VAR=VALUE".

       @argv = $term-&gt;argv
           Return the argument vector as this terminal, similar to @ARGV, but includes the program name as first
           element.

       $modifiermask = $term-&gt;ModLevel3Mask
       $modifiermask = $term-&gt;ModMetaMask
       $modifiermask = $term-&gt;ModNumLockMask
           Return the modifier masks corresponding to the "ISO Level 3 Shift" (often AltGr), the meta key (often
           Alt) and the num lock key, if applicable.

       $screen = $term-&gt;current_screen
           Returns the currently displayed screen (0 primary, 1 secondary).

       $cursor_is_hidden = $term-&gt;hidden_cursor
           Returns whether the cursor is currently hidden or not.

       $priv_modes = $term-&gt;priv_modes
           Returns a bitset with the state of DEC private modes.

           Example:

             if ($term-&gt;priv_modes &amp; urxvt::PrivMode_mouse_report) {
                 # mouse reporting is turned on
             }

       $view_start = $term-&gt;view_start ([$newvalue])
           Returns  the row number of the topmost displayed line and changes it, if an argument is given. Values
           greater than or equal to 0 display the terminal contents. Lower values scroll this  many  lines  into
           the scrollback buffer.

       $term-&gt;want_refresh
           Requests  a  screen refresh. At the next opportunity, rxvt-unicode will compare the on-screen display
           with its stored representation. If they differ, it redraws the differences.

           Used after changing terminal contents to display them.

       $term-&gt;refresh_check
           Checks if a refresh has been requested and, if so, schedules one.

       $text = $term-&gt;ROW_t ($row_number[, $new_text[, $start_col]])
           Returns the text of the entire row with number  $row_number.  Row  "$term-&gt;top_row"  is  the  topmost
           terminal  line,  row  "$term-&gt;nrow-1"  is the bottommost terminal line. Nothing will be returned if a
           nonexistent line is requested.

           If $new_text is specified, it will replace  characters  in  the  current  line,  starting  at  column
           $start_col  (default  0),  which  is  useful  to  replace only parts of a line. The font index in the
           rendition will automatically be updated.

           $text is in a special encoding: tabs and wide characters that use more than one cell  when  displayed
           are padded with $urxvt::NOCHAR (chr 65535) characters. Characters with combining characters and other
           characters  that  do  not  fit  into the normal text encoding will be replaced with characters in the
           private use area.

           You have to obey this encoding when changing  text.  The  advantage  is  that  "substr"  and  similar
           functions work on screen cells and not on characters.

           The methods "$term-&gt;special_encode" and "$term-&gt;special_decode" can be used to convert normal strings
           into this encoding and vice versa.

       $rend = $term-&gt;ROW_r ($row_number[, $new_rend[, $start_col]])
           Like  "$term-&gt;ROW_t",  but  returns  an  arrayref  with  rendition bitsets. Rendition bitsets contain
           information about colour, font, font styles and similar information. See also "$term-&gt;ROW_t".

           When setting rendition, the font mask will be ignored.

           See the section on RENDITION, above.

       $length = $term-&gt;ROW_l ($row_number[, $new_length])
           Returns the number of screen cells that are in use ("the line length"). Unlike the urxvt  core,  this
           returns "$term-&gt;ncol" if the line is joined with the following one.

       $bool = $term-&gt;is_longer ($row_number)
           Returns  true  if  the  row is part of a multiple-row logical "line" (i.e.  joined with the following
           row), which means all characters are in use and it is continued on  the  next  row  (and  possibly  a
           continuation of the previous row(s)).

       $line = $term-&gt;line ($row_number)
           Create  and return a new "urxvt::line" object that stores information about the logical line that row
           $row_number is part of. It supports the following methods:

           $text = $line-&gt;t ([$new_text])
               Returns or replaces the full text of the line, similar to "ROW_t"

           $rend = $line-&gt;r ([$new_rend])
               Returns or replaces the full rendition array of the line, similar to "ROW_r"

           $length = $line-&gt;l
               Returns the length of the line in cells, similar to "ROW_l".

           $rownum = $line-&gt;beg
           $rownum = $line-&gt;end
               Return the row number of the first/last row of the line, respectively.

           $offset = $line-&gt;offset_of ($row, $col)
               Returns the character offset of the given row|col pair within the logical line.  Works  for  rows
               outside the line, too, and returns corresponding offsets outside the string.

           ($row, $col) = $line-&gt;coord_of ($offset)
               Translates a string offset into terminal coordinates again.

       $text = $term-&gt;special_encode ($string)
           Converts  a  perl  string  into  the  special  encoding  used  by  rxvt-unicode,  where one character
           corresponds to one screen cell. See "$term-&gt;ROW_t" for details.

       $string = $term-&gt;special_decode ($text)
           Converts rxvt-unicode's text representation into a perl string. See "$term-&gt;ROW_t" for details.

       $success = $term-&gt;grab_button ($button, $modifiermask[, $window = $term-&gt;vt])
       $term-&gt;ungrab_button ($button, $modifiermask[, $window = $term-&gt;vt])
           Register/unregister a synchronous button grab. See the XGrabButton manpage.

       $success = $term-&gt;grab ($eventtime[, $sync])
           Calls XGrabPointer and XGrabKeyboard in asynchronous (default) or synchronous ($sync is  true).  Also
           remembers the grab timestamp.

       $term-&gt;allow_events_async
           Calls XAllowEvents with AsyncBoth for the most recent grab.

       $term-&gt;allow_events_sync
           Calls XAllowEvents with SyncBoth for the most recent grab.

       $term-&gt;allow_events_replay
           Calls XAllowEvents with both ReplayPointer and ReplayKeyboard for the most recent grab.

       $term-&gt;ungrab
           Calls  XUngrabPointer  and  XUngrabKeyboard  for  the  most  recent  grab. Is called automatically on
           evaluation errors, as it is better to lose the grab in the error case as the session.

       $atom = $term-&gt;XInternAtom ($atom_name[, $only_if_exists])
       $atom_name = $term-&gt;XGetAtomName ($atom)
       @atoms = $term-&gt;XListProperties ($window)
       ($type,$format,$octets) = $term-&gt;XGetWindowProperty ($window, $property)
       $term-&gt;XChangeProperty ($window, $property, $type, $format, $octets)
       $term-&gt;XDeleteProperty ($window, $property)
       $window = $term-&gt;DefaultRootWindow
       $term-&gt;XReparentWindow ($window, $parent, [$x, $y])
       $term-&gt;XMapWindow ($window)
       $term-&gt;XUnmapWindow ($window)
       $term-&gt;XMoveResizeWindow ($window, $x, $y, $width, $height)
       ($x, $y, $child_window) = $term-&gt;XTranslateCoordinates ($src, $dst, $x, $y)
       $term-&gt;XChangeInput ($window, $add_events[, $del_events])
       $keysym = $term-&gt;XStringToKeysym ($string)
       $string = $term-&gt;XKeysymToString ($keysym)
           Various X or X-related functions. The $term  object  only  serves  as  the  source  of  the  display,
           otherwise those functions map more-or-less directly onto the X functions of the same name.

   <b>The</b> <b>"urxvt::popup"</b> <b>Class</b>
       $popup-&gt;add_title ($title)
           Adds a non-clickable title to the popup.

       $popup-&gt;add_separator ([$sepchr])
           Creates a separator, optionally using the character given as $sepchr.

       $popup-&gt;add_button ($text, $cb)
           Adds a clickable button to the popup. $cb is called whenever it is selected.

       $popup-&gt;add_toggle ($text, $initial_value, $cb)
           Adds  a  toggle/checkbox item to the popup. The callback gets called whenever it gets toggled, with a
           boolean indicating its new value as its first argument.

       $popup-&gt;show
           Displays the popup (which is initially hidden).

   <b>The</b> <b>"urxvt::timer"</b> <b>Class</b>
       This class implements timer watchers/events. Time is represented as a fractional number of seconds  since
       the epoch. Example:

          $term-&gt;{overlay} = $term-&gt;overlay (-1, 0, 8, 1, urxvt::OVERLAY_RSTYLE, 0);
          $term-&gt;{timer} = urxvt::timer
                           -&gt;new
                           -&gt;interval (1)
                           -&gt;cb (sub {
                              $term-&gt;{overlay}-&gt;set (0, 0,
                                 sprintf "%2d:%02d:%02d", (localtime urxvt::NOW)[2,1,0]);
                           });

       $timer = new urxvt::timer
           Create a new timer object in started state. It is scheduled to fire immediately.

       $timer = $timer-&gt;cb (sub { my ($timer) = @_; ... })
           Set the callback to be called when the timer triggers.

       $timer = $timer-&gt;set ($tstamp[, $interval])
           Set the time the event is generated to $tstamp (and optionally specifies a new $interval).

       $timer = $timer-&gt;interval ($interval)
           By  default  (and when $interval is 0), the timer will automatically stop after it has fired once. If
           $interval is non-zero, then the timer is automatically rescheduled at the given intervals.

       $timer = $timer-&gt;start
           Start the timer.

       $timer = $timer-&gt;start ($tstamp[, $interval])
           Set the event trigger time to $tstamp and start the timer. Optionally also replaces the interval.

       $timer = $timer-&gt;after ($delay[, $interval])
           Like "start", but sets the expiry timer to c&lt;urxvt::NOW + $delay&gt;.

       $timer = $timer-&gt;stop
           Stop the timer.

   <b>The</b> <b>"urxvt::iow"</b> <b>Class</b>
       This class implements io watchers/events. Example:

         $term-&gt;{socket} = ...
         $term-&gt;{iow} = urxvt::iow
                        -&gt;new
                        -&gt;fd (fileno $term-&gt;{socket})
                        -&gt;events (urxvt::EV_READ)
                        -&gt;start

                          # $revents must be 1 here, no need to check
                          sysread $term-&gt;{socket}, my $buf, 8192
                             or end-of-file;
                        });

       $iow = new urxvt::iow
           Create a new io watcher object in stopped state.

       $iow = $iow-&gt;cb (sub { my ($iow, $reventmask) = @_; ... })
           Set the callback to be called when io events are triggered. $reventmask is a bitset as  described  in
           the "events" method.

       $iow = $iow-&gt;fd ($fd)
           Set the file descriptor (not handle) to watch.

       $iow = $iow-&gt;events ($eventmask)
           Set  the  event  mask  to  watch. The only allowed values are "urxvt::EV_READ" and "urxvt::EV_WRITE",
           which might be ORed together, or "urxvt::EV_NONE".

       $iow = $iow-&gt;start
           Start watching for requested events on the given handle.

       $iow = $iow-&gt;stop
           Stop watching for events on the given file handle.

   <b>The</b> <b>"urxvt::iw"</b> <b>Class</b>
       This class implements idle watchers, that get called automatically when the process is idle. They  should
       return as fast as possible, after doing some useful work.

       $iw = new urxvt::iw
           Create a new idle watcher object in stopped state.

       $iw = $iw-&gt;cb (sub { my ($iw) = @_; ... })
           Set the callback to be called when the watcher triggers.

           Stop the watcher.

   <b>The</b> <b>"urxvt::pw"</b> <b>Class</b>
       This  class  implements process watchers. They create an event whenever a process exits, after which they
       stop automatically.

          my $pid = fork;
          ...
          $term-&gt;{pw} = urxvt::pw
                           -&gt;new

                           });

       $pw = new urxvt::pw
           Create a new process watcher in stopped state.

       $pw = $pw-&gt;cb (sub { my ($pw, $exit_status) = @_; ... })
           Set the callback to be called when the timer triggers.

       $pw = $timer-&gt;start ($pid)
           Tells the watcher to start watching for process $pid.

       $pw = $pw-&gt;stop
           Stop the watcher.
