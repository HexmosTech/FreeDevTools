</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       PPI::XS - (Minor) XS acceleration for PPI

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 0.910

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       PPI::XS provides XS-based acceleration of the core PPI packages. It selectively replaces a (small but
       growing) number of methods throughout PPI with identical but much faster C versions.

       Once installed, it will be auto-detected and loaded in by PPI completely transparently.

       Because the C implementations are linked to the perl versions of the same function, it is preferable to
       upgrade PPI::XS any time you do a major upgrade of PPI itself.

       If the two fall out of sync, the integration between the two is designed to degrade gracefully. PPI::XS
       is capable of determining which functions are no longer equal, and will simple leave the perl version
       alone, deleting the C version to free up the memory.

       If the versions of the two get so far apart that they become completely incompatible, PPI::XS will simply
       silently not load at all.

       Beyond that, there isn't that much more you really need to know. :)
