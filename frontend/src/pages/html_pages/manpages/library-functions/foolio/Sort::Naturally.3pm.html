       Sort::Naturally -- sort lexically, but sort numeral parts numerically

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         @them = nsort(qw(
          foo12a foo12z foo13a foo 14 9x foo12 fooa foolio Foolio Foo12a
         ));
         print join(' ', @them), "\n";

       Prints:

         9x 14 foo fooa foolio Foolio foo12 foo12a Foo12a foo12z foo13a

       (Or "foo12a" + "Foo12a" and "foolio" + "Foolio" and might be switched, depending on your locale.)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module exports two functions, "nsort" and "ncmp"; they are used in implementing my idea of a
       "natural sorting" algorithm.  Under natural sorting, numeric substrings are compared numerically, and
       other word-characters are compared lexically.

       This is the way I define natural sorting:

       •   Non-numeric  word-character  substrings are sorted lexically, case-insensitively: "Foo" comes between
           "fish" and "fowl".

       •   Numeric substrings are sorted numerically: "100" comes after "20", not before.

       •   \W substrings (neither words-characters nor digits) are <u>ignored</u>.

       •   Our use of \w, \d, \D, and \W is locale-sensitive:  Sort::Naturally uses a "use locale" statement.

       •   When comparing two strings, where a numeric substring in one  place  is  <u>not</u>  up  against  a  numeric
           substring  in another, the non-numeric always comes first.  This is fudged by reading pretending that
           the lack of a number substring has the value -1, like so:

             foo       =&gt;  "foo",  -1
             foobar    =&gt;  "foo",  -1,  "bar"
             foo13     =&gt;  "foo",  13,
             foo13xyz  =&gt;  "foo",  13,  "xyz"

           That's so that "foo" will come before "foo13", which will come before "foobar".

       •   The start of a string is  exceptional:  leading  non-\W  (non-word,  non-digit)  components  are  are
           ignored, and numbers come <u>before</u> letters.

       •   I  define  "numeric  substring"  just  as  sequences  matching m/\d+/ -- scientific notation, commas,
           decimals, etc., are not seen.  If your data has thousands  separators  in  numbers  ("20,000  Leagues
           Under  The  Sea"  or  "20.000  lieues sous les mers"), consider stripping them before feeding them to
           "nsort" or "ncmp".

   <b>The</b> <b>nsort</b> <b>function</b>
       This function takes a list of strings, and returns a copy of the list, sorted.

       This is what most people will want to use:

         @stuff = nsort(...list...);

       When nsort needs to compare non-numeric substrings, it uses Perl's "lc"  function  in  scope  of  a  &lt;use
       locale&gt;.   And  when  nsort  needs  to  lowercase things, it uses Perl's "lc" function in scope of a &lt;use
       locale&gt;.  If you want nsort to use other functions instead, you can specify them in an  arrayref  as  the
       first argument to nsort:

         @stuff = nsort( [
                           \&amp;string_comparator,   # optional
                           \&amp;lowercaser_function  # optional
                         ],
                         ...list...
                       );

       If  you  want  to specify a string comparator but no lowercaser, then the options list is "[\&amp;comparator,
       '']" or "[\&amp;comparator]".  If you want to specify no string comparator but a lowercaser, then the options
       list is "['', \&amp;lowercaser]".

       Any comparator you specify is called as "$comparator-&gt;($left, $right)", and, like  a  normal  Perl  "cmp"
       replacement,  must  return  -1,  0,  or 1 depending on whether the left argument is stringwise less than,
       equal to, or greater than the right argument.

       Any lowercaser function you specify is called as "$lowercased = $lowercaser-&gt;($original)".   The  routine
       must not modify its $_[0].

   <b>The</b> <b>ncmp</b> <b>function</b>
       Often, when sorting non-string values like this:

          @objects_sorted = sort { $a-&gt;tag cmp $b-&gt;tag } @objects;

       ...or even in a Schwartzian transform, like this:

          @strings =
            map $_-&gt;[0]
            sort { $a-&gt;[1] cmp $b-&gt;[1] }
            map { [$_, make_a_sort_key_from($_) ]
            @_
          ;

       ...you  wight  want  something that replaces not "sort", but "cmp".  That's what Sort::Naturally's "ncmp"
       function is for.  Call it with the  syntax  "ncmp($left,$right)"  instead  of  "$left  cmp  $right",  but
       otherwise it's a fine replacement:

          @objects_sorted = sort { ncmp($a-&gt;tag,$b-&gt;tag) } @objects;

          @strings =
            map $_-&gt;[0]
            sort { ncmp($a-&gt;[1], $b-&gt;[1]) }
            map { [$_, make_a_sort_key_from($_) ]
            @_
          ;

       Just  as  with "nsort" can take different a string-comparator and/or lowercaser, you can do the same with
       "ncmp", by passing an arrayref as the first argument:

         ncmp( [
                 \&amp;string_comparator,   # optional
                 \&amp;lowercaser_function  # optional
               ],
               $left, $right
             )

       You might get string comparators from Sort::ArbBiLex.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       •   This module is not a substitute for Sort::Versions!  If you just need  proper  version  sorting,  use
           <u>that!</u>

       •   If  you  need  something  that  works  <u>sort</u>  <u>of</u> like this module's functions, but not quite the same,
           consider scouting thru this module's source code, and adapting what you see.  Besides  the  functions
           that  actually  compile  in this module, after the POD, there's several alternate attempts of mine at
           natural sorting routines, which are not compiled as part of the module,  but  which  you  might  find
           useful.   They  should  all  be <u>working</u> implementations of slightly different algorithms (all of them
           based on Martin Pool's "nsort") which I eventually discarded in favor of my algorithm.   If  you  are
           having  to  naturally-sort  <u>very</u> <u>large</u> data sets, and sorting is getting ridiculously slow, you might
           consider trying one of those discarded functions -- I have a feeling they might be  faster  on  large
           data  sets.   Benchmark  them on your data and see.  (Unless you <u>need</u> the speed, don't bother.  Hint:
           substitute "sort" for "nsort" in your code, and unless your program speeds up drastically,  it's  not
           the  sorting  that's  slowing things down.  But if it <u>is</u> "nsort" that's slowing things down, consider
           just:

                 if(@set &gt;= SOME_VERY_BIG_NUMBER) {
                   no locale; # vroom vroom
                   @sorted = sort(@set);  # feh, good enough
                 } elsif(@set &gt;= SOME_BIG_NUMBER) {
                   use locale;
                   @sorted = sort(@set);  # feh, good enough
                 } else {
                   # but keep it pretty for normal cases
                   @sorted = nsort(@set);
                 }

       •   If you do adapt the routines in this module, email me; I'd just be interested in hearing about it.

       •   Thanks to the EFNet #perl people for encouraging this module, especially magister and a-mused.
