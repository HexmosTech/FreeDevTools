</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       truncate — truncate a file to a specified length

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       #include &lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/unistd.h">unistd.h</a>&gt;

       int truncate(const char *<u>path</u>, off_t <u>length</u>);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>truncate</u>() function shall cause the regular file named by <u>path</u> to have a size which shall be equal to
       <u>length</u> bytes.

       If  the  file  previously was larger than <u>length</u>, the extra data is discarded. If the file was previously
       shorter than <u>length</u>, its size is increased, and the extended area appears as if it were zero-filled.

       The application shall ensure that the process has write permission for the file.

       If the request would cause the file size to exceed the soft file size limit for the process, the  request
       shall fail and the implementation shall generate the SIGXFSZ signal for the process.

       The  <u>truncate</u>()  function shall not modify the file offset for any open file descriptions associated with
       the file. Upon successful completion, <u>truncate</u>() shall mark for update the  last  data  modification  and
       last  file status change timestamps of the file, and the S_ISUID and S_ISGID bits of the file mode may be
       cleared.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       Upon successful completion, <u>truncate</u>() shall return 0. Otherwise, -1 shall be returned, and <u>errno</u> set  to
       indicate the error.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>truncate</u>() function shall fail if:

       <b>EINTR</b>  A signal was caught during execution.

       <b>EINVAL</b> The <u>length</u> argument was less than 0.

       <b>EFBIG</b> or <b>EINVAL</b>
              The <u>length</u> argument was greater than the maximum file size.

       <b>EIO</b>    An I/O error occurred while reading from or writing to a file system.

       <b>EACCES</b> A  component  of  the  path  prefix denies search permission, or write permission is denied on the
              file.

       <b>EISDIR</b> The named file is a directory.

       <b>ELOOP</b>  A loop exists in symbolic links encountered during resolution of the <u>path</u> argument.

       <b>ENAMETOOLONG</b>
              The length of a component of a pathname is longer than {NAME_MAX}.

       <b>ENOENT</b> A component of <u>path</u> does not name an existing file or <u>path</u> is an empty string.

       <b>ENOTDIR</b>
              A component of the path prefix names an existing file that is neither a directory nor  a  symbolic
              link  to  a  directory,  or the <u>path</u> argument contains at least one non-&lt;slash&gt; character and ends
              with one or more trailing &lt;slash&gt; characters and the last pathname  component  names  an  existing
              file that is neither a directory nor a symbolic link to a directory.

       <b>EROFS</b>  The named file resides on a read-only file system.

       The <u>truncate</u>() function may fail if:

       <b>ELOOP</b>  More than {SYMLOOP_MAX} symbolic links were encountered during resolution of the <u>path</u> argument.

       <b>ENAMETOOLONG</b>
              The length of a pathname exceeds {PATH_MAX}, or pathname resolution of a symbolic link produced an
              intermediate result with a length that exceeds {PATH_MAX}.
