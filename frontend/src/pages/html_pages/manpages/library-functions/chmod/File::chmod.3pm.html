</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       File::chmod - Implements symbolic and ls chmod modes

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 0.42

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use File::chmod;
         $File::chmod::UMASK = 0;
         # It is recommended that you explicitly set $File::chmod::UMASK
         # as the default will change in the future
         #
         # 0 is recommended to behave like system chmod
         # 1 if you want File::chmod to apply your environment set umask.
         # 2 is how we detect that it's internally set, undef will become the
         # default in the future, eventually a lexicaly scoped API may be designed

         # chmod takes all three types
         # these all do the same thing
         chmod(0666,@files);
         chmod("=rw",@files);
         chmod("-rw-rw-rw-",@files);

         # or

         use File::chmod qw( symchmod lschmod );

         chmod(0666,@files);           # this is the normal chmod
         symchmod("=rw",@files);       # takes symbolic modes only
         lschmod("-rw-rw-rw-",@files); # takes "ls" modes only

         # more functions, read on to understand

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       File::chmod is a utility that allows you to bypass system calls or bit processing of a file's
       permissions.  It overloads the <b>chmod()</b> function with its own that gets an octal mode, a symbolic mode
       (see below), or an "ls" mode (see below).  If you wish not to overload <b>chmod()</b>, you can export <b>symchmod()</b>
       and <b>lschmod()</b>, which take, respectively, a symbolic mode and an "ls" mode.

       An added feature to version 0.30 is the $UMASK variable, explained in detail below; if "symchmod()" is
       called and this variable is true, then the function uses the (also new) $MASK variable (which defaults to
       "umask()") as a mask against the new mode. This mode is on by default, and changes the behavior from what
       you would expect if you are used to UNIX "chmod".  <b>This</b> <b>may</b> <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>future.</b>

       Symbolic modes are thoroughly described in your <b><a href="../man1/chmod.1.html">chmod</a></b>(1) man page, but here are a few examples.

         chmod("+x","file1","file2");  # overloaded chmod(), that is...
         # turns on the execute bit for all users on those two files

         chmod("o=,g-w","file1","file2");
         # removes 'other' permissions, and the write bit for 'group'

         chmod("=u","file1","file2");
         # sets all bits to those in 'user'

       "ls" modes are the type produced on the left-hand side of an "ls -l" on a directory.  Examples are:

         chmod("-rwxr-xr-x","file1","file2");
         # the 0755 setting; user has read-write-execute, group and others
         # have read-execute priveleges

         chmod("-rwsrws---","file1","file2");
         # sets read-write-execute for user and group, none for others
         # also sets set-uid and set-gid bits

       The regular <b>chmod()</b> and <b>lschmod()</b> are absolute; that is, they are not appending to or subtracting from
       the current file mode.  They set it, regardless of what it had been before.  <b>symchmod()</b> is useful for
       allowing the modifying of a file's permissions without having to run a system call or determining the
       file's permissions, and then combining that with whatever bits are appropriate.  It also operates
       separately on each file.

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTIONS</b> <b>-</b> <b>EXPORT</b></h4><pre>
   <b>chmod(MODE,FILES)</b>
       Takes an octal, symbolic, or "ls" mode, and then chmods each file appropriately.

   <b>getchmod(MODE,FILES)</b>
       Returns a list of modified permissions, without chmodding files.  Accepts any of the three kinds of
       modes.

         @newmodes = getchmod("+x","file1","file2");
         # @newmodes holds the octal permissions of the files'
         # modes, if they were to be sent through chmod("+x"...)

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTIONS</b> <b>-</b> <b>EXPORT_OK</b></h4><pre>
   <b>symchmod(MODE,FILES)</b>
       Takes a symbolic permissions mode, and chmods each file.

   <b>lschmod(MODE,FILES)</b>
       Takes an "ls" permissions mode, and chmods each file.

   <b>getsymchmod(MODE,FILES)</b>
       Returns a list of modified permissions, without chmodding files.  Accepts only symbolic permission modes.

   <b>getlschmod(MODE,FILES)</b>
       Returns a list of modified permissions, without chmodding files.  Accepts only "ls" permission modes.

   <b>getmod(FILES)</b>
       Returns a list of the current mode of each file.

</pre><h4><b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>$File::chmod::DEBUG</b>
       If set to a true value, it will report warnings, similar to those produced by <b>chmod()</b> on your system.
       Otherwise, the functions will not report errors.  Example: a file can not have file-locking and the set-
       gid bits on at the same time.  If $File::chmod::DEBUG is true, the function will report an error.  If
       not, you are not warned of the conflict.  It is set to 1 as default.

   <b>$File::chmod::MASK</b>
       Contains the umask to apply to new file modes when using <b>getsymchmod()</b>.  This defaults to the return
       value of <b>umask()</b> at compile time.  Is only applied if $UMASK is true.

   <b>$File::chmod::UMASK</b>
       This is a boolean which tells <b>getsymchmod()</b> whether or not to apply the umask found in $MASK.  It
       defaults to true.

</pre><h4><b>PORTING</b></h4><pre>
       This is only good on Unix-like boxes.  I would like people to help me work on File::chmod for any OS that
       deserves it.  If you would like to help, please email me (address below) with the OS and any information
       you might have on how <b>chmod()</b> should work on it; if you don't have any specific information, but would
       still like to help, hey, that's good too.  I have the following information (from "perlport"):

       Win32
           Only  good  for changing "owner" read-write access, "group", and "other" bits are meaningless.  <u>NOTE:</u>
           <u>Win32::File</u> <u>and</u> <u>Win32::FileSecurity</u> <u>already</u> <u>do</u>  <u>this.</u>   <u>I</u>  <u>do</u>  <u>not</u>  <u>currently</u>  <u>see</u>  <u>a</u>  <u>need</u>  <u>to</u>  <u>port</u>
           <u>File::chmod.</u>

       MacOS
           Only limited meaning. Disabling/enabling write permission is mapped to locking/unlocking the file.

       RISC OS
           Only good for changing "owner" and "other" read-write access.
