</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       SDL_GetPowerInfo - Get the current power supply details.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;SDL3/SDL_power.h&gt;</b>

       <b>SDL_PowerState</b> <b>SDL_GetPowerInfo(int</b> <b>*seconds,</b> <b>int</b> <b>*percent);</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       You  should  never  take a battery status as absolute truth. Batteries (especially failing batteries) are
       delicate hardware, and the values reported here are best estimates based on what that  hardware  reports.
       It's  not  uncommon  for  older batteries to lose stored power much faster than it reports, or completely
       drain when reporting it has 20 percent left, etc.

       Battery status can change at any time; if you are concerned  with  power  state,  you  should  call  this
       function frequently, and perhaps ignore changes until they seem to be stable for a few seconds.

       It's possible a platform can only report battery percentage or time left but not both.

       On  some platforms, retrieving power supply details might be expensive. If you want to display continuous
       status you could call this function every minute or so.

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTION</b> <b>PARAMETERS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>seconds</u>
              a pointer filled in with the seconds of battery life left, or NULL to ignore. This will be  filled
              in with -1 if we can't determine a value or there is no battery.

       <u>percent</u>
              a  pointer  filled  in  with  the  percentage  of battery life left, between 0 and 100, or NULL to
              ignore. This will be filled in with -1 we can't determine a value or there is no battery.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       Returns the current battery state or  <b>SDL_POWERSTATE_ERROR</b>  on  failure;  call  <b>SDL_GetError</b>()  for  more
       information.

</pre><h4><b>AVAILABILITY</b></h4><pre>
       This function is available since SDL 3.2.0.
