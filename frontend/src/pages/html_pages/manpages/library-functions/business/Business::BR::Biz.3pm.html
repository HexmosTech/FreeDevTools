</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Business::BR::Biz - DEPRECATED (was: Modules for Brazilian business-related subjects)

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Business::BR::Biz; # does nothing, it is here because of POD and $VERSION

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module was a placeholder for the overview of the 'biz-br' distribution, now called
       'Business-BR-Ids'. Soon we will get rid of it, by moving the introductory documentation contained here to
       Business::BR::Ids.

   <b>EXPORT</b>
       None by default.

</pre><h4><b>TESTING</b> <b>CORRECTNESS</b></h4><pre>
       Among the functionalities to be made available in this distribution, we'll have tests for correctness of
       typical identification numbers and codes.

       <u>To</u> <u>be</u> <u>correct</u> will mean here to satisfy certain easily computed rules. For example, a CPF number is
       correct if it is 11-digits-long and satisfy two check equations which validate the check digits.

       The modules "Business::BR::*" will provide subroutines "test_*" for testing the correctness of such
       concepts.

       To be <u>correct</u> does not mean that an identification number or code had been <u>verified</u> to stand for some
       real entry, like an actual Brazilian taxpayer citizen in the case of CPF. This would require access to
       government databases which may or may not be available in a public basis. And besides, to <u>verify</u>
       something will not be <u>easily</u> <u>computed</u> in general, implying access to databases and applying specialized
       rules.

       Here we'll be trying to stick to a consistent terminology and 'correct' will always be used for validity
       against syntactical forms and shallow semantics. In turn, 'verified' will be used for telling if an
       entity really makes sense in the real world.  This convention is purely arbitrary and for the sake of
       being formal in some way. Terms like 'test', 'verify', 'check', 'validate', 'correct', 'valid' are often
       used interchangeably in colloquial prose.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       As a rule, the documentation and tests choose correct identification codes which are verified to be
       invalid by the time of the distribution update. That is, in Business::BR::CPF, the mentioned correct CPF
       number '390.533.447-05' is correct, but doesn't actually exist in government databases.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       As you might have guessed, this is not the first Perl distribution to approach this kind of
       functionality. Take a look at
