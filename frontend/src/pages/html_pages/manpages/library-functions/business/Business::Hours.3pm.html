       Business::Hours - Calculate business hours in a time period

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Business::Hours;
         my $hours = Business::Hours-&gt;new();

         # Get a Set::IntSpan of all the business hours in the next week.
         # use the default business hours of 9am to 6pm localtime.
         $hours-&gt;for_timespan( Start =&gt; time(), End =&gt; time()+(86400*7) );

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module is a simple tool for calculating business hours in a time period.  Over time, additional
       functionality will be added to make it easy to calculate the number of business hours between arbitrary
       dates.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
   <b>new</b>
       Creates a new Business::Hours object.  Takes no arguments.

   <b>business_hours</b> <b>HASH</b>
       Gets / sets the business hours for this object.  Takes a hash (NOT a hash reference) of the form:

           my %hours = (
               0 =&gt; { Name     =&gt; 'Sunday',
                      Start    =&gt; 'HH:MM',
                      End      =&gt; 'HH:MM' },

               1 =&gt; { Name     =&gt; 'Monday',
                      Start    =&gt; 'HH:MM',
                      End      =&gt; 'HH:MM' },
               ....

               6 =&gt; { Name     =&gt; 'Saturday',
                      Start    =&gt; 'HH:MM',
                      End      =&gt; 'HH:MM' },
           );

       Start and End times are of the form HH:MM.  Valid times are from 00:00 to 23:59.  If your hours are from
       9am to 6pm, use Start =&gt; '9:00', End =&gt; '18:00'.  A given day MUST have a start and end time OR may
       declare both Start and End to be undef, if there are no valid hours on that day.

       You can use the array Breaks to mark interruptions between Start/End (for instance lunch hour). It's an
       array of periods, each with a Start and End time:

           my %hours = (
               0 =&gt; { Name     =&gt; 'Sunday',
                      Start    =&gt; 'HH:MM',
                      End      =&gt; 'HH:MM',
                      Breaks  =&gt; [
                                    { Start    =&gt; 'HH:MM',
                                    End      =&gt; 'HH:MM' },
                                    { Start    =&gt; 'HH:MM',
                                    End      =&gt; 'HH:MM' },
                                  ],

               1 =&gt; { Name     =&gt; 'Monday',
                      Start    =&gt; 'HH:MM',
                      End      =&gt; 'HH:MM' },
               ....

               6 =&gt; { Name     =&gt; 'Saturday',
                      Start    =&gt; 'HH:MM',
                      End      =&gt; 'HH:MM' },
           );

       Note that the ending time is really "what is the first minute we're closed.  If you specify an "End" of
       18:00, that means that at 6pm, you are closed.  The last business second was 17:59:59.

       As well, you can pass information about holidays using key 'holidays' and an array reference value, for
       example:

           $hours-&gt;business_hours(
               0 =&gt; { Name     =&gt; 'Sunday',
                      Start    =&gt; 'HH:MM',
                      End      =&gt; 'HH:MM' },
               ....
               6 =&gt; { Name     =&gt; 'Saturday',
                      Start    =&gt; 'HH:MM',
                      End      =&gt; 'HH:MM' },

               holidays =&gt; [qw(01-01 12-25 2009-05-08)],
           );

       Read more about holidays specification below in holidays.

   <b>preprocess_business_hours</b>
       Checks and transforms business hours data. No need to call it.

   <b>holidays</b> <b>ARRAY</b>
       Gets / sets holidays for this object. Takes an array where each element is ether 'MM-DD' or 'YYYY-MM-DD'.

       Specification with year defined may be required when a holiday matches Sunday or Saturday. In many
       countries days are shifted in such case.

       Holidays can be set via business_hours method as well, so you can use this feature without changing your
       code.

   <b>for_timespan</b> <b>HASH</b>
       Takes a hash with the following parameters:

       Start
           The start of the period in question in seconds since the epoch

       End The end of the period in question in seconds since the epoch

       Returns a Set::IntSpan of business hours for this period of time.

   <b>between</b> <b>START,</b> <b>END</b>
       Returns  the  number  of business seconds between START and END Both START and END should be specified in
       seconds since the epoch.

       Returns -1 if START or END are outside the calculated business hours.

   <b>first_after</b> <b>START</b>
       Returns START if START is within business hours.  Otherwise,  returns  the  next  business  second  after
       START.  START should be specified in seconds since the epoch.

       Returns -1 if it can't find any business hours within thirty days.

   <b>add_seconds</b> <b>START,</b> <b>SECONDS</b>
       Returns  a  time  SECONDS  business  seconds after START.  START should be specified in seconds since the
       epoch.

       Returns -1 if it can't find any business hours within thirty days.
