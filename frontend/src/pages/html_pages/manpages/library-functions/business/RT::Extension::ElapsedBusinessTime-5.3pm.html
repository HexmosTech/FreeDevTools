       The available configuration options, with their defaults are given here.

           Set( %ElapsedBusinessTime,
               Start   =&gt; '08:30',
               End     =&gt; '17:30',
               Country =&gt; undef,
               Region  =&gt; undef,
               'Exclude Days'   =&gt; [6, 7],
               'Exclude States' =&gt; ['stalled', 'blocked', 'resolved', 'rejected', 'deleted'],
           );

       Options are:

       Start
           The start of the business day.

       End The end of the business day.

       Country
           A  country  for which there is a Date::Holidays module which describes the holidays for that country.
           If there isn't one, please consider writing one!  For example 'NZ' for New Zealand.

       Region
           Some country  modules  for  Date::Holidays  include  regions  for  regional  holidays.   For  example
           'Wellington' within New Zealand for Wellington Anniversary Day.

       Excluded Days
           Days  which  should  not be considered working days. The day numbers are from DateTime. For reference
           they are:

               1: Monday
               2: Tuesday
               3: Wednesday
               4: Thursday
               5: Friday
               6: Saturday
               7: Sunday

       Excluded States
           Which a ticket is in one of these states, then it is considered inactive and the counter stops.  This
           is  to  allow  when  a  ticket is waiting on a customers feedback, and for some businesses, that time
           shouldn't be added to their ticket duration time.
