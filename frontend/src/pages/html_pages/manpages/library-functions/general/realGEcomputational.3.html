       <b>SGEBAL</b>

       <b>Purpose:</b>

            SGEBAL balances a general real matrix A.  This involves, first,
            permuting A by a similarity transformation to isolate eigenvalues
            in the first 1 to ILO-1 and last IHI+1 to N elements on the
            diagonal; and second, applying a diagonal similarity transformation
            to rows and columns ILO to IHI to make the rows and columns as
            close in norm as possible.  Both steps are optional.

            Balancing may reduce the 1-norm of the matrix, and improve the
            accuracy of the computed eigenvalues and/or eigenvectors.

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>JOB</u>

                     JOB is CHARACTER*1
                     Specifies the operations to be performed on A:
                     = 'N':  none:  simply set ILO = 1, IHI = N, SCALE(I) = 1.0
                             for i = 1,...,N;
                     = 'P':  permute only;
                     = 'S':  scale only;
                     = 'B':  both permute and scale.

           <u>N</u>

                     N is INTEGER
                     The order of the matrix A.  N &gt;= 0.

                     On entry, the input matrix A.
                     On exit,  A is overwritten by the balanced matrix.
                     If JOB = 'N', A is not referenced.
                     See Further Details.

           <u>LDA</u>

                     LDA is INTEGER
                     The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA &gt;= max(1,N).

           <u>ILO</u>

                     IHI is INTEGER
                     ILO and IHI are set to integers such that on exit
                     A(i,j) = 0 if i &gt; j and j = 1,...,ILO-1 or I = IHI+1,...,N.
                     If JOB = 'N' or 'S', ILO = 1 and IHI = N.

           <u>SCALE</u>

                     SCALE is REAL array, dimension (N)
                     Details of the permutations and scaling factors applied to
                     A.  If P(j) is the index of the row and column interchanged
                     with row and column j and D(j) is the scaling factor
                     applied to row and column j, then
                     SCALE(j) = P(j)    for j = 1,...,ILO-1
                              = D(j)    for j = ILO,...,IHI
                              = P(j)    for j = IHI+1,...,N.
                     The order in which the interchanges are made is N to IHI+1,
                     then 1 to ILO-1.

           <u>INFO</u>

                     INFO is INTEGER
                     = 0:  successful exit.
                     &lt; 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value.

       <b>Further</b> <b>Details:</b>

             The permutations consist of row and column interchanges which put
             the matrix in the form

                        ( T1   X   Y  )
                P A P = (  0   B   Z  )
                        (  0   0   T2 )

             where T1 and T2 are upper triangular matrices whose eigenvalues lie
             along the diagonal.  The column indices ILO and IHI mark the starting
             and ending columns of the submatrix B. Balancing consists of applying
             a diagonal similarity transformation inv(D) * B * D to make the
             1-norms of each row of B and its corresponding column nearly equal.
             The output matrix is

                ( T1     X*D          Y    )
                (  0  inv(D)*B*D  inv(D)*Z ).
                (  0      0           T2   )

             Information about the permutations P and the diagonal matrix D is
             returned in the vector SCALE.

             This subroutine is based on the EISPACK routine BALANC.

       <b>Purpose:</b>

            SGEEQU computes row and column scalings intended to equilibrate an

       <b>SGEEQUB</b>

       <b>Purpose:</b>

            SGEEQUB computes row and column scalings intended to equilibrate an
            M-by-N matrix A and reduce its condition number.  R returns the row
            scale factors and C the column scale factors, chosen to try to make
            the largest element in each row and column of the matrix B with
            elements B(i,j)=R(i)*A(i,j)*C(j) have an absolute value of at most
            the radix.

            R(i) and C(j) are restricted to be a power of the radix between
            SMLNUM = smallest safe number and BIGNUM = largest safe number.  Use
            of these scaling factors is not guaranteed to reduce the condition
            number of A but works well in practice.

            This routine differs from SGEEQU by restricting the scaling factors
            to a power of the radix.  Barring over- and underflow, scaling by
            these factors introduces no additional rounding errors.  However, the
            scaled entries' magnitudes are no longer approximately 1 but lie
            between sqrt(radix) and 1/sqrt(radix).

                     LDX is INTEGER
                     The leading dimension of the array X.  LDX &gt;= max(1,N).

           <u>FERR</u>

                     FERR is REAL array, dimension (NRHS)
                     The estimated forward error bound for each solution vector
                     X(j) (the j-th column of the solution matrix X).
                     If XTRUE is the true solution corresponding to X(j), FERR(j)
                     is an estimated upper bound for the magnitude of the largest
                     element in (X(j) - XTRUE) divided by the magnitude of the
                     largest element in X(j).  The estimate is as reliable as
                     the estimate for RCOND, and is almost always a slight
                     overestimate of the true error.

           <u>BERR</u>

                     BERR is REAL array, dimension (NRHS)
                     The componentwise relative backward error of each solution
                     vector X(j) (i.e., the smallest relative change in
                     any element of A or B that makes X(j) an exact solution).

                     = 0:  successful exit
                     &lt; 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value

       <b>SGERFSX</b>

       <b>Purpose:</b>

               SGERFSX improves the computed solution to a system of linear
               equations and provides error bounds and backward error estimates
               for the solution.  In addition to normwise error bound, the code
               provides maximum componentwise error bound if possible.  See
               comments for ERR_BNDS_NORM and ERR_BNDS_COMP for details of the
               error bounds.

               The original system of linear equations may have been equilibrated
               before calling this routine, as described by arguments EQUED, R
               and C below. In this case, the solution and error bounds returned
               are for the original unequilibrated system.

                Some optional parameters are bundled in the PARAMS array.  These
                settings determine how refinement is performed, but often the
                defaults are acceptable.  If the defaults are acceptable, users
                can pass NPARAMS = 0 which prevents the source code from accessing
                the PARAMS argument.

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>TRANS</u>

                     TRANS is CHARACTER*1
                Specifies the form of the system of equations:
                  = 'N':  A * X = B     (No transpose)
                  = 'T':  A**T * X = B  (Transpose)
                  = 'C':  A**H * X = B  (Conjugate transpose = Transpose)

           <u>EQUED</u>

                     EQUED is CHARACTER*1
                Specifies the form of equilibration that was done to A
                before calling this routine. This is needed to compute
                the solution and error bounds correctly.
                  = 'N':  No equilibration
                  = 'R':  Row equilibration, i.e., A has been premultiplied by
                          diag(R).
                  = 'C':  Column equilibration, i.e., A has been postmultiplied
                          by diag(C).
                  = 'B':  Both row and column equilibration, i.e., A has been
                          replaced by diag(R) * A * diag(C).
                          The right hand side B has been changed accordingly.

           <u>N</u>

                     N is INTEGER
                The order of the matrix A.  N &gt;= 0.

           <u>NRHS</u>

                     NRHS is INTEGER
                The number of right hand sides, i.e., the number of columns
                of the matrices B and X.  NRHS &gt;= 0.

           <u>A</u>

                     A is REAL array, dimension (LDA,N)
                The original N-by-N matrix A.

           <u>LDA</u>

                     LDA is INTEGER
                The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA &gt;= max(1,N).

           <u>AF</u>

                     AF is REAL array, dimension (LDAF,N)
                The factors L and U from the factorization A = P*L*U
                as computed by SGETRF.

           <u>LDAF</u>

                     LDAF is INTEGER
                The leading dimension of the array AF.  LDAF &gt;= max(1,N).

           <u>IPIV</u>

                     IPIV is INTEGER array, dimension (N)
                The pivot indices from SGETRF; for 1&lt;=i&lt;=N, row i of the
                matrix was interchanged with row IPIV(i).

           <u>R</u>

                     R is REAL array, dimension (N)
                The row scale factors for A.  If EQUED = 'R' or 'B', A is
                multiplied on the left by diag(R); if EQUED = 'N' or 'C', R
                is not accessed.
                If R is accessed, each element of R should be a power of the radix
                to ensure a reliable solution and error estimates. Scaling by
                powers of the radix does not cause rounding errors unless the
                result underflows or overflows. Rounding errors during scaling
                lead to refining with a matrix that is not equivalent to the
                input matrix, producing error estimates that may not be
                reliable.

           <u>C</u>

                     C is REAL array, dimension (N)
                The column scale factors for A.  If EQUED = 'C' or 'B', A is
                multiplied on the right by diag(C); if EQUED = 'N' or 'R', C
                is not accessed.
                If C is accessed, each element of C should be a power of the radix
                to ensure a reliable solution and error estimates. Scaling by
                powers of the radix does not cause rounding errors unless the
                result underflows or overflows. Rounding errors during scaling
                lead to refining with a matrix that is not equivalent to the
                input matrix, producing error estimates that may not be
                reliable.

           <u>B</u>

                     B is REAL array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)
                The right hand side matrix B.

           <u>LDB</u>

                     LDB is INTEGER
                The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB &gt;= max(1,N).

           <u>X</u>

                     X is REAL array, dimension (LDX,NRHS)
                On entry, the solution matrix X, as computed by SGETRS.
                On exit, the improved solution matrix X.

           <u>LDX</u>

                     LDX is INTEGER
                The leading dimension of the array X.  LDX &gt;= max(1,N).

           <u>RCOND</u>

                     RCOND is REAL
                Reciprocal scaled condition number.  This is an estimate of the
                reciprocal Skeel condition number of the matrix A after
                equilibration (if done).  If this is less than the machine
                precision (in particular, if it is zero), the matrix is singular
                to working precision.  Note that the error may still be small even
                if this number is very small and the matrix appears ill-
                conditioned.

           <u>BERR</u>

                     BERR is REAL array, dimension (NRHS)
                Componentwise relative backward error.  This is the
                componentwise relative backward error of each solution vector X(j)
                (i.e., the smallest relative change in any element of A or B that
                makes X(j) an exact solution).

           <u>N_ERR_BNDS</u>

                     N_ERR_BNDS is INTEGER
                Number of error bounds to return for each right hand side
                and each type (normwise or componentwise).  See ERR_BNDS_NORM and
                ERR_BNDS_COMP below.

           <u>ERR_BNDS_NORM</u>

                     ERR_BNDS_NORM is REAL array, dimension (NRHS, N_ERR_BNDS)
                For each right-hand side, this array contains information about
                various error bounds and condition numbers corresponding to the
                normwise relative error, which is defined as follows:

                Normwise relative error in the ith solution vector:
                        max_j (abs(XTRUE(j,i) - X(j,i)))
                       ------------------------------
                             max_j abs(X(j,i))

                The array is indexed by the type of error information as described
                below. There currently are up to three pieces of information
                returned.

                The first index in ERR_BNDS_NORM(i,:) corresponds to the ith
                right-hand side.

                The second index in ERR_BNDS_NORM(:,err) contains the following
                three fields:
                err = 1 "Trust/don't trust" boolean. Trust the answer if the
                         reciprocal condition number is less than the threshold
                         sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon').

                err = 2 "Guaranteed" error bound: The estimated forward error,
                         almost certainly within a factor of 10 of the true error
                         so long as the next entry is greater than the threshold
                         sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon'). This error bound should only
                         be trusted if the previous boolean is true.

                err = 3  Reciprocal condition number: Estimated normwise
                         reciprocal condition number.  Compared with the threshold
                         sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon') to determine if the error
                         estimate is "guaranteed". These reciprocal condition
                         numbers are 1 / (norm(Z^{-1},inf) * norm(Z,inf)) for some
                         appropriately scaled matrix Z.
                         Let Z = S*A, where S scales each row by a power of the
                         radix so all absolute row sums of Z are approximately 1.

                See Lapack Working Note 165 for further details and extra
                cautions.

           <u>ERR_BNDS_COMP</u>

                     ERR_BNDS_COMP is REAL array, dimension (NRHS, N_ERR_BNDS)
                For each right-hand side, this array contains information about
                various error bounds and condition numbers corresponding to the
                componentwise relative error, which is defined as follows:

                Componentwise relative error in the ith solution vector:
                               abs(XTRUE(j,i) - X(j,i))
                        max_j ----------------------
                                    abs(X(j,i))

                The array is indexed by the right-hand side i (on which the
                componentwise relative error depends), and the type of error
                information as described below. There currently are up to three
                pieces of information returned for each right-hand side. If
                componentwise accuracy is not requested (<a href="../man3/PARAMS.3.html">PARAMS</a>(3) = 0.0), then
                ERR_BNDS_COMP is not accessed.  If N_ERR_BNDS &lt; 3, then at most
                the first (:,N_ERR_BNDS) entries are returned.

                The first index in ERR_BNDS_COMP(i,:) corresponds to the ith
                right-hand side.

                The second index in ERR_BNDS_COMP(:,err) contains the following
                three fields:
                err = 1 "Trust/don't trust" boolean. Trust the answer if the
                         reciprocal condition number is less than the threshold
                         sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon').

                err = 2 "Guaranteed" error bound: The estimated forward error,
                         almost certainly within a factor of 10 of the true error
                         so long as the next entry is greater than the threshold
                         sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon'). This error bound should only
                         be trusted if the previous boolean is true.

                err = 3  Reciprocal condition number: Estimated componentwise
                         reciprocal condition number.  Compared with the threshold
                         sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon') to determine if the error
                         estimate is "guaranteed". These reciprocal condition
                         numbers are 1 / (norm(Z^{-1},inf) * norm(Z,inf)) for some
                         appropriately scaled matrix Z.
                         Let Z = S*(A*diag(x)), where x is the solution for the
                         current right-hand side and S scales each row of
                         A*diag(x) by a power of the radix so all absolute row
                         sums of Z are approximately 1.

                See Lapack Working Note 165 for further details and extra
                cautions.

           <u>NPARAMS</u>

                     NPARAMS is INTEGER
                Specifies the number of parameters set in PARAMS.  If &lt;= 0, the
                PARAMS array is never referenced and default values are used.

           <u>PARAMS</u>

                     PARAMS is REAL array, dimension NPARAMS
                Specifies algorithm parameters.  If an entry is &lt; 0.0, then
                that entry will be filled with default value used for that
                parameter.  Only positions up to NPARAMS are accessed; defaults
                are used for higher-numbered parameters.

                  PARAMS(LA_LINRX_ITREF_I = 1) : Whether to perform iterative
                       refinement or not.
                    Default: 1.0
                       = 0.0:  No refinement is performed, and no error bounds are

       <b>SGESVJ</b>

       <b>Purpose:</b>

            SGESVJ computes the singular value decomposition (SVD) of a real
            M-by-N matrix A, where M &gt;= N. The SVD of A is written as
                                               [++]   [xx]   [x0]   [xx]
                         A = U * SIGMA * V^t,  [++] = [xx] * [ox] * [xx]
                                               [++]   [xx]
            where SIGMA is an N-by-N diagonal matrix, U is an M-by-N orthonormal
            matrix, and V is an N-by-N orthogonal matrix. The diagonal elements
            of SIGMA are the singular values of A. The columns of U and V are the
            left and the right singular vectors of A, respectively.
            SGESVJ can sometimes compute tiny singular values and their singular vectors much
            more accurately than other SVD routines, see below under Further Details.

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>JOBA</u>

                     JOBA is CHARACTER*1
                     Specifies the structure of A.
                     = 'L': The input matrix A is lower triangular;
                     = 'U': The input matrix A is upper triangular;
                     = 'G': The input matrix A is general M-by-N matrix, M &gt;= N.

           <u>JOBU</u>

                     JOBU is CHARACTER*1
                     Specifies whether to compute the left singular vectors
                     (columns of U):
                     = 'U': The left singular vectors corresponding to the nonzero
                            singular values are computed and returned in the leading
                            columns of A. See more details in the description of A.
                            The default numerical orthogonality threshold is set to
                            approximately TOL=CTOL*EPS, CTOL=SQRT(M), EPS=SLAMCH('E').
                     = 'C': Analogous to JOBU='U', except that user can control the
                            level of numerical orthogonality of the computed left
                            singular vectors. TOL can be set to TOL = CTOL*EPS, where
                            CTOL is given on input in the array WORK.
                            No CTOL smaller than ONE is allowed. CTOL greater
                            than 1 / EPS is meaningless. The option 'C'
                            can be used if M*EPS is satisfactory orthogonality
                            of the computed left singular vectors, so CTOL=M could
                            save few sweeps of Jacobi rotations.
                            See the descriptions of A and <a href="../man1/WORK.1.html">WORK</a>(1).
                     = 'N': The matrix U is not computed. However, see the
                            description of A.

           <u>JOBV</u>

                     JOBV is CHARACTER*1
                     Specifies whether to compute the right singular vectors, that
                     is, the matrix V:
                     = 'V':  the matrix V is computed and returned in the array V
                     = 'A':  the Jacobi rotations are applied to the MV-by-N
                             array V. In other words, the right singular vector
                             matrix V is not computed explicitly; instead it is
                             applied to an MV-by-N matrix initially stored in the
                             first MV rows of V.
                     = 'N':  the matrix V is not computed and the array V is not
                             referenced

           <u>M</u>

                     M is INTEGER
                     The number of rows of the input matrix A. 1/SLAMCH('E') &gt; M &gt;= 0.

           <u>N</u>

                     N is INTEGER
                     The number of columns of the input matrix A.
                     M &gt;= N &gt;= 0.

           <u>A</u>

                     A is REAL array, dimension (LDA,N)
                     On entry, the M-by-N matrix A.
                     On exit,
                     If JOBU = 'U' .OR. JOBU = 'C':
                            If INFO = 0:
                            RANKA orthonormal columns of U are returned in the
                            leading RANKA columns of the array A. Here RANKA &lt;= N
                            is the number of computed singular values of A that are
                            above the underflow threshold SLAMCH('S'). The singular
                            vectors corresponding to underflowed or zero singular
                            values are not computed. The value of RANKA is returned
                            in the array WORK as RANKA=NINT(<a href="../man2/WORK.2.html">WORK</a>(2)). Also see the
                            descriptions of SVA and WORK. The computed columns of U
                            are mutually numerically orthogonal up to approximately
                            TOL=SQRT(M)*EPS (default); or TOL=CTOL*EPS (JOBU = 'C'),
                            see the description of JOBU.
                            If INFO &gt; 0,
                            the procedure SGESVJ did not converge in the given number
                            of iterations (sweeps). In that case, the computed
                            columns of U may not be orthogonal up to TOL. The output
                            U (stored in A), SIGMA (given by the computed singular
                            values in SVA(1:N)) and V is still a decomposition of the
                            input matrix A in the sense that the residual
                            ||A-SCALE*U*SIGMA*V^T||_2 / ||A||_2 is small.
                     If JOBU = 'N':
                            If INFO = 0:
                            Note that the left singular vectors are 'for free' in the
                            one-sided Jacobi SVD algorithm. However, if only the
                            singular values are needed, the level of numerical
                            orthogonality of U is not an issue and iterations are

       <b>Further</b> <b>Details:</b>
           The orthogonal N-by-N matrix V is obtained as a product of Jacobi plane rotations. The rotations are
           implemented as fast scaled rotations of Anda and Park [1]. In the case of underflow of the Jacobi
           angle, a modified Jacobi transformation of Drmac [4] is used. Pivot strategy uses column interchanges
           of de Rijk [2]. The relative accuracy of the computed singular values and the accuracy of the
           computed singular vectors (in angle metric) is as guaranteed by the theory of Demmel and Veselic [3].
           The condition number that determines the accuracy in the full rank case is essentially min_{D=diag}
           kappa(A*D), where kappa(.) is the spectral condition number. The best performance of this Jacobi SVD
           procedure is achieved if used in an accelerated version of Drmac and Veselic [5,6], and it is the
           kernel routine in the SIGMA library [7]. Some tuning parameters (marked with [TP]) are available for
           the implementer.
            The computational range for the nonzero singular values is the machine number interval ( UNDERFLOW ,
           OVERFLOW ). In extreme cases, even denormalized singular values can be computed with the
           corresponding gradual loss of accurate digits.

       <b>Purpose:</b>

        SGETRF computes an LU factorization of a general M-by-N matrix A
        using partial pivoting with row interchanges.

        The factorization has the form
           A = P * L * U
        where P is a permutation matrix, L is lower triangular with unit
        diagonal elements (lower trapezoidal if m &gt; n), and U is upper
        triangular (upper trapezoidal if m &lt; n).

        This code implements an iterative version of Sivan Toledo's recursive
        LU algorithm[1].  For square matrices, this iterative versions should
        be within a factor of two of the optimum number of memory transfers.

        The pattern is as follows, with the large blocks of U being updated

       <b>SGETRF2</b>

       <b>Purpose:</b>

            SGETRF2 computes an LU factorization of a general M-by-N matrix A
            using partial pivoting with row interchanges.

            The factorization has the form
               A = P * L * U
            where P is a permutation matrix, L is lower triangular with unit
            diagonal elements (lower trapezoidal if m &gt; n), and U is upper
            triangular (upper trapezoidal if m &lt; n).

            This is the recursive version of the algorithm. It divides
            the matrix into four submatrices:

                   [  A11 | A12  ]  where A11 is n1 by n1 and A22 is n2 by n2
               A = [ -----|----- ]  with n1 = min(m,n)/2
                   [  A21 | A22  ]       n2 = n-n1

                                                  [ A11 ]
            The subroutine calls itself to factor [ --- ],
                                                  [ A12 ]
                            [ A12 ]
            do the swaps on [ --- ], solve A12, update A22,
                            [ A22 ]

            then calls itself to factor A22 and do the swaps on A21.

                     On exit, the factors L and U from the factorization
                     A = P*L*U; the unit diagonal elements of L are not stored.

                     matrix was interchanged with row IPIV(i).

       <b>SHGEQZ</b>

       <b>Purpose:</b>

            SHGEQZ computes the eigenvalues of a real matrix pair (H,T),
            where H is an upper Hessenberg matrix and T is upper triangular,
            using the double-shift QZ method.
            Matrix pairs of this type are produced by the reduction to
            generalized upper Hessenberg form of a real matrix pair (A,B):

               A = Q1*H*Z1**T,  B = Q1*T*Z1**T,

            as computed by SGGHRD.

            If JOB='S', then the Hessenberg-triangular pair (H,T) is
            also reduced to generalized Schur form,

               H = Q*S*Z**T,  T = Q*P*Z**T,

            where Q and Z are orthogonal matrices, P is an upper triangular
            matrix, and S is a quasi-triangular matrix with 1-by-1 and 2-by-2
            diagonal blocks.

            The 1-by-1 blocks correspond to real eigenvalues of the matrix pair
            (H,T) and the 2-by-2 blocks correspond to complex conjugate pairs of
            eigenvalues.

            Additionally, the 2-by-2 upper triangular diagonal blocks of P
            corresponding to 2-by-2 blocks of S are reduced to positive diagonal
            form, i.e., if S(j+1,j) is non-zero, then P(j+1,j) = P(j,j+1) = 0,
            P(j,j) &gt; 0, and P(j+1,j+1) &gt; 0.

            Optionally, the orthogonal matrix Q from the generalized Schur
            factorization may be postmultiplied into an input matrix Q1, and the
            orthogonal matrix Z may be postmultiplied into an input matrix Z1.
            If Q1 and Z1 are the orthogonal matrices from SGGHRD that reduced
            the matrix pair (A,B) to generalized upper Hessenberg form, then the
            output matrices Q1*Q and Z1*Z are the orthogonal factors from the
            generalized Schur factorization of (A,B):

               A = (Q1*Q)*S*(Z1*Z)**T,  B = (Q1*Q)*P*(Z1*Z)**T.

            To avoid overflow, eigenvalues of the matrix pair (H,T) (equivalently,
            of (A,B)) are computed as a pair of values (alpha,beta), where alpha is
            complex and beta real.
            If beta is nonzero, lambda = alpha / beta is an eigenvalue of the
            generalized nonsymmetric eigenvalue problem (GNEP)
               A*x = lambda*B*x
            and if alpha is nonzero, mu = beta / alpha is an eigenvalue of the
            alternate form of the GNEP
               mu*A*y = B*y.
            Real eigenvalues can be read directly from the generalized Schur
            form:
              alpha = S(i,i), beta = P(i,i).

       <b>SLA_GEAMV</b> computes a matrix-vector product using a general matrix to calculate error bounds.

       <b>Purpose:</b>

            SLA_GEAMV  performs one of the matrix-vector operations

                    y := alpha*abs(A)*abs(x) + beta*abs(y),
               or   y := alpha*abs(A)**T*abs(x) + beta*abs(y),

            where alpha and beta are scalars, x and y are vectors and A is an
            m by n matrix.

            This function is primarily used in calculating error bounds.
            To protect against underflow during evaluation, components in
            the resulting vector are perturbed away from zero by (N+1)
            times the underflow threshold.  To prevent unnecessarily large
            errors for block-structure embedded in general matrices,
            "symbolically" zero components are not perturbed.  A zero
            entry is considered "symbolic" if all multiplications involved
            in computing that entry have at least one zero multiplicand.

       <b>SLA_GERFSX_EXTENDED</b> improves the computed solution to a system of linear equations for general matrices
       by performing extra-precise iterative refinement and provides error bounds and backward error estimates
       for the solution.

       <b>Purpose:</b>

            SLA_GERFSX_EXTENDED improves the computed solution to a system of
            linear equations by performing extra-precise iterative refinement
            and provides error bounds and backward error estimates for the solution.
            This subroutine is called by SGERFSX to perform iterative refinement.
            In addition to normwise error bound, the code provides maximum
            componentwise error bound if possible. See comments for ERRS_N
            and ERRS_C for details of the error bounds. Note that this
            subroutine is only resonsible for setting the second fields of
            ERRS_N and ERRS_C.

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>PREC_TYPE</u>

                Specifies the transposition operation on A.
                The value is defined by ILATRANS(T) where T is a CHARACTER and T
                     = 'N':  No transpose
                     = 'T':  Transpose
                     = 'C':  Conjugate transpose

           <u>N</u>

                     N is INTEGER
                The number of linear equations, i.e., the order of the
                matrix A.  N &gt;= 0.

           <u>NRHS</u>

                     NRHS is INTEGER
                The number of right-hand-sides, i.e., the number of columns of the
                matrix B.

           <u>A</u>

                     A is REAL array, dimension (LDA,N)
                On entry, the N-by-N matrix A.

           <u>LDA</u>

                     LDA is INTEGER
                The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA &gt;= max(1,N).

           <u>AF</u>

                     AF is REAL array, dimension (LDAF,N)
                The factors L and U from the factorization
                A = P*L*U as computed by SGETRF.

           <u>LDAF</u>

                     LDAF is INTEGER
                The leading dimension of the array AF.  LDAF &gt;= max(1,N).

           <u>IPIV</u>

                     IPIV is INTEGER array, dimension (N)
                The pivot indices from the factorization A = P*L*U
                as computed by SGETRF; row i of the matrix was interchanged
                with row IPIV(i).

           <u>COLEQU</u>

                     COLEQU is LOGICAL
                If .TRUE. then column equilibration was done to A before calling
                this routine. This is needed to compute the solution and error
                bounds correctly.

           <u>C</u>

                     C is REAL array, dimension (N)
                The column scale factors for A. If COLEQU = .FALSE., C
                is not accessed. If C is input, each element of C should be a power
                of the radix to ensure a reliable solution and error estimates.
                Scaling by powers of the radix does not cause rounding errors unless
                the result underflows or overflows. Rounding errors during scaling
                lead to refining with a matrix that is not equivalent to the
                input matrix, producing error estimates that may not be
                reliable.

           <u>B</u>

                     B is REAL array, dimension (LDB,NRHS)

           <u>Y</u>

                     Y is REAL array, dimension (LDY,NRHS)
                On entry, the solution matrix X, as computed by SGETRS.
                On exit, the improved solution matrix Y.

           <u>LDY</u>

                     LDY is INTEGER
                The leading dimension of the array Y.  LDY &gt;= max(1,N).

           <u>BERR_OUT</u>

                     BERR_OUT is REAL array, dimension (NRHS)
                On exit, BERR_OUT(j) contains the componentwise relative backward
                error for right-hand-side j from the formula
                    max(i) ( abs(RES(i)) / ( abs(op(A_s))*abs(Y) + abs(B_s) )(i) )
                where abs(Z) is the componentwise absolute value of the matrix
                or vector Z. This is computed by SLA_LIN_BERR.

           <u>N_NORMS</u>

                     N_NORMS is INTEGER
                Determines which error bounds to return (see ERRS_N
                and ERRS_C).
                If N_NORMS &gt;= 1 return normwise error bounds.
                If N_NORMS &gt;= 2 return componentwise error bounds.

           <u>ERRS_N</u>

                     ERRS_N is REAL array, dimension (NRHS, N_ERR_BNDS)
                For each right-hand side, this array contains information about
                various error bounds and condition numbers corresponding to the
                normwise relative error, which is defined as follows:

                Normwise relative error in the ith solution vector:
                        max_j (abs(XTRUE(j,i) - X(j,i)))
                       ------------------------------
                             max_j abs(X(j,i))

                The array is indexed by the type of error information as described
                below. There currently are up to three pieces of information
                returned.

                The first index in ERRS_N(i,:) corresponds to the ith
                right-hand side.

                The second index in ERRS_N(:,err) contains the following
                three fields:
                err = 1 "Trust/don't trust" boolean. Trust the answer if the
                         reciprocal condition number is less than the threshold
                         sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon').

                err = 2 "Guaranteed" error bound: The estimated forward error,
                         almost certainly within a factor of 10 of the true error
                         so long as the next entry is greater than the threshold
                         sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon'). This error bound should only
                         be trusted if the previous boolean is true.

                err = 3  Reciprocal condition number: Estimated normwise
                         reciprocal condition number.  Compared with the threshold
                         sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon') to determine if the error
                         estimate is "guaranteed". These reciprocal condition
                         numbers are 1 / (norm(Z^{-1},inf) * norm(Z,inf)) for some
                         appropriately scaled matrix Z.
                         Let Z = S*A, where S scales each row by a power of the
                         radix so all absolute row sums of Z are approximately 1.

                This subroutine is only responsible for setting the second field
                above.
                See Lapack Working Note 165 for further details and extra
                cautions.

           <u>ERRS_C</u>

                     ERRS_C is REAL array, dimension (NRHS, N_ERR_BNDS)
                For each right-hand side, this array contains information about
                various error bounds and condition numbers corresponding to the
                componentwise relative error, which is defined as follows:

                Componentwise relative error in the ith solution vector:
                               abs(XTRUE(j,i) - X(j,i))
                        max_j ----------------------
                                    abs(X(j,i))

                The array is indexed by the right-hand side i (on which the
                componentwise relative error depends), and the type of error
                information as described below. There currently are up to three
                pieces of information returned for each right-hand side. If
                componentwise accuracy is not requested (<a href="../man3/PARAMS.3.html">PARAMS</a>(3) = 0.0), then
                ERRS_C is not accessed.  If N_ERR_BNDS &lt; 3, then at most
                the first (:,N_ERR_BNDS) entries are returned.

                The first index in ERRS_C(i,:) corresponds to the ith
                right-hand side.

                The second index in ERRS_C(:,err) contains the following
                three fields:
                err = 1 "Trust/don't trust" boolean. Trust the answer if the
                         reciprocal condition number is less than the threshold
                         sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon').

                err = 2 "Guaranteed" error bound: The estimated forward error,
                         almost certainly within a factor of 10 of the true error
                         so long as the next entry is greater than the threshold
                         sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon'). This error bound should only
                         be trusted if the previous boolean is true.

                err = 3  Reciprocal condition number: Estimated componentwise
                         reciprocal condition number.  Compared with the threshold
                         sqrt(n) * slamch('Epsilon') to determine if the error
                         estimate is "guaranteed". These reciprocal condition
                         numbers are 1 / (norm(Z^{-1},inf) * norm(Z,inf)) for some
                         appropriately scaled matrix Z.
                         Let Z = S*(A*diag(x)), where x is the solution for the
                         current right-hand side and S scales each row of
                         A*diag(x) by a power of the radix so all absolute row
                         sums of Z are approximately 1.

                This subroutine is only responsible for setting the second field
                above.
                See Lapack Working Note 165 for further details and extra
                cautions.

           <u>RES</u>

                     RES is REAL array, dimension (N)
                Workspace to hold the intermediate residual.

           <u>AYB</u>

                     AYB is REAL array, dimension (N)
                Workspace. This can be the same workspace passed for Y_TAIL.

           <u>DY</u>

                     DY is REAL array, dimension (N)
                Workspace to hold the intermediate solution.

           <u>Y_TAIL</u>

                     Y_TAIL is REAL array, dimension (N)
                Workspace to hold the trailing bits of the intermediate solution.

           <u>RCOND</u>

                     RCOND is REAL
                Reciprocal scaled condition number.  This is an estimate of the
                reciprocal Skeel condition number of the matrix A after
                equilibration (if done).  If this is less than the machine
                precision (in particular, if it is zero), the matrix is singular
                to working precision.  Note that the error may still be small even
                if this number is very small and the matrix appears ill-
                conditioned.

           <u>ITHRESH</u>

                     ITHRESH is INTEGER
                The maximum number of residual computations allowed for
                refinement. The default is 10. For 'aggressive' set to 100 to
                permit convergence using approximate factorizations or
                factorizations other than LU. If the factorization uses a
                technique other than Gaussian elimination, the guarantees in
                ERRS_N and ERRS_C may no longer be trustworthy.

           <u>RTHRESH</u>

                     RTHRESH is REAL
                Determines when to stop refinement if the error estimate stops
                decreasing. Refinement will stop when the next solution no longer
                satisfies norm(dx_{i+1}) &lt; RTHRESH * norm(dx_i) where norm(Z) is
                the infinity norm of Z. RTHRESH satisfies 0 &lt; RTHRESH &lt;= 1. The
                default value is 0.5. For 'aggressive' set to 0.9 to permit
                convergence on extremely ill-conditioned matrices. See LAWN 165
                for more details.

           <u>DZ_UB</u>

                     DZ_UB is REAL
                Determines when to start considering componentwise convergence.
                Componentwise convergence is only considered after each component
                of the solution Y is stable, which we define as the relative
                change in each component being less than DZ_UB. The default value
                is 0.25, requiring the first bit to be stable. See LAWN 165 for
                more details.

           <u>IGNORE_CWISE</u>

                     IGNORE_CWISE is LOGICAL
                If .TRUE. then ignore componentwise convergence. Default value
                is .FALSE..

           <u>INFO</u>

                     INFO is INTEGER
                  = 0:  Successful exit.
                  &lt; 0:  if INFO = -i, the ith argument to SGETRS had an illegal
                        value

       <b>SLA_GERPVGRW</b>

       <b>Purpose:</b>

            SLA_GERPVGRW computes the reciprocal pivot growth factor
            norm(A)/norm(U). The "max absolute element" norm is used. If this is
            much less than 1, the stability of the LU factorization of the
            (equilibrated) matrix A could be poor. This also means that the
            solution X, estimated condition numbers, and error bounds could be
            unreliable.

       <b>SLAORHR_COL_GETRFNP</b>

       <b>Purpose:</b>

            SLAORHR_COL_GETRFNP computes the modified LU factorization without
            pivoting of a real general M-by-N matrix A. The factorization has
            the form:

                A - S = L * U,

            where:
               S is a m-by-n diagonal sign matrix with the diagonal D, so that
               D(i) = S(i,i), 1 &lt;= i &lt;= min(M,N). The diagonal D is constructed
               as D(i)=-SIGN(A(i,i)), where A(i,i) is the value after performing
               i-1 steps of Gaussian elimination. This means that the diagonal
               element at each step of "modified" Gaussian elimination is
               at least one in absolute value (so that division-by-zero not
               not possible during the division by the diagonal element);

               L is a M-by-N lower triangular matrix with unit diagonal elements
               (lower trapezoidal if M &gt; N);

               and U is a M-by-N upper triangular matrix
               (upper trapezoidal if M &lt; N).

            This routine is an auxiliary routine used in the Householder
            reconstruction routine SORHR_COL. In SORHR_COL, this routine is
            applied to an M-by-N matrix A with orthonormal columns, where each
            element is bounded by one in absolute value. With the choice of
            the matrix S above, one can show that the diagonal element at each
            step of Gaussian elimination is the largest (in absolute value) in
            the column on or below the diagonal, so that no pivoting is required
            for numerical stability [1].

            For more details on the Householder reconstruction algorithm,
            including the modified LU factorization, see [1].

            This is the blocked right-looking version of the algorithm,
            calling Level 3 BLAS to update the submatrix. To factorize a block,
            this routine calls the recursive routine SLAORHR_COL_GETRFNP2.

            the form:

                A - S = L * U,

            where:

               (lower trapezoidal if M &gt; N);

               and U is a M-by-N upper triangular matrix
               (upper trapezoidal if M &lt; N).

            This routine is an auxiliary routine used in the Householder
            reconstruction routine SORHR_COL. In SORHR_COL, this routine is
            applied to an M-by-N matrix A with orthonormal columns, where each

            For more details on the Householder reconstruction algorithm,
            including the modified LU factorization, see [1].

            This is the recursive version of the LU factorization algorithm.
            Denote A - S by B. The algorithm divides the matrix B into four
            submatrices:

                   [  B11 | B12  ]  where B11 is n1 by n1,
               B = [ -----|----- ]        B21 is (m-n1) by n1,
                   [  B21 | B22  ]        B12 is n1 by n2,
                                          B22 is (m-n1) by n2,
                                          with n1 = min(m,n)/2, n2 = n-n1.

            The subroutine calls itself to factor B11, solves for B21,
            solves for B12, updates B22, then calls itself to factor B22.

            For more details on the recursive LU algorithm, see [2].

            SLAORHR_COL_GETRFNP2 is called to factorize a block by the blocked
            routine SLAORHR_COL_GETRFNP, which uses blocked code calling
            Level 3 BLAS to update the submatrix. However, SLAORHR_COL_GETRFNP2
            is self-sufficient and can be used without SLAORHR_COL_GETRFNP.

       <b>STGEVC</b>

       <b>Purpose:</b>

            STGEVC computes some or all of the right and/or left eigenvectors of
            a pair of real matrices (S,P), where S is a quasi-triangular matrix
            and P is upper triangular.  Matrix pairs of this type are produced by
            the generalized Schur factorization of a matrix pair (A,B):

               A = Q*S*Z**T,  B = Q*P*Z**T

            as computed by SGGHRD + SHGEQZ.

            The right eigenvector x and the left eigenvector y of (S,P)
            corresponding to an eigenvalue w are defined by:

               S*x = w*P*x,  (y**H)*S = w*(y**H)*P,

            where y**H denotes the conjugate tranpose of y.
            The eigenvalues are not input to this routine, but are computed
            directly from the diagonal blocks of S and P.

            This routine returns the matrices X and/or Y of right and left
            eigenvectors of (S,P), or the products Z*X and/or Q*Y,
            where Z and Q are input matrices.
            If Q and Z are the orthogonal factors from the generalized Schur
            factorization of a matrix pair (A,B), then Z*X and Q*Y
            are the matrices of right and left eigenvectors of (A,B).

                     The number of columns in the arrays VL and/or VR actually
                     used to store the eigenvectors.  If HOWMNY = 'A' or 'B', M
                     is set to N.  Each selected real eigenvector occupies one
                     column and each selected complex eigenvector occupies two
                     columns.

           <u>WORK</u>

                     WORK is REAL array, dimension (6*N)

           <u>INFO</u>

                     INFO is INTEGER
                     = 0:  successful exit.
                     &lt; 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value.
                     &gt; 0:  the 2-by-2 block (INFO:INFO+1) does not have a complex
                           eigenvalue.

             Allocation of workspace:
             ---------- -- ---------

                WORK( j ) = 1-norm of j-th column of A, above the diagonal
                WORK( N+j ) = 1-norm of j-th column of B, above the diagonal
                WORK( 2*N+1:3*N ) = real part of eigenvector
                WORK( 3*N+1:4*N ) = imaginary part of eigenvector
                WORK( 4*N+1:5*N ) = real part of back-transformed eigenvector
                WORK( 5*N+1:6*N ) = imaginary part of back-transformed eigenvector

             Rowwise vs. columnwise solution methods:
             ------- --  ---------- -------- -------

             Finding a generalized eigenvector consists basically of solving the
             singular triangular system

              (A - w B) x = 0     (for right) or:   (A - w B)**H y = 0  (for left)

             Consider finding the i-th right eigenvector (assume all eigenvalues
             are real). The equation to be solved is:
                  n                   i
             0 = sum  C(j,k) v(k)  = sum  C(j,k) v(k)     for j = i,. . .,1
                 k=j                 k=j

             where  C = (A - w B)  (The components v(i+1:n) are 0.)

             The "rowwise" method is:

             (1)  v(i) := 1
             for j = i-1,. . .,1:
                                     i
                 (2) compute  s = - sum C(j,k) v(k)   and
                                   k=j+1

                 (3) v(j) := s / C(j,j)

             Step 2 is sometimes called the "dot product" step, since it is an
             inner product between the j-th row and the portion of the eigenvector
             that has been computed so far.

             The "columnwise" method consists basically in doing the sums
             for all the rows in parallel.  As each v(j) is computed, the
             contribution of v(j) times the j-th column of C is added to the
             partial sums.  Since FORTRAN arrays are stored columnwise, this has
             the advantage that at each step, the elements of C that are accessed
             are adjacent to one another, whereas with the rowwise method, the
             elements accessed at a step are spaced LDS (and LDP) words apart.

             When finding left eigenvectors, the matrix in question is the
             transpose of the one in storage, so the rowwise method then
             actually accesses columns of A and B at each step, and so is the
             preferred method.

       <b>STGEXC</b>

       <b>Purpose:</b>

            STGEXC reorders the generalized real Schur decomposition of a real
            matrix pair (A,B) using an orthogonal equivalence transformation

                           (A, B) = Q * (A, B) * Z**T,

            so that the diagonal block of (A, B) with row index IFST is moved
            to row ILST.

            (A, B) must be in generalized real Schur canonical form (as returned
            by SGGES), i.e. A is block upper triangular with 1-by-1 and 2-by-2
            diagonal blocks. B is upper triangular.

            Optionally, the matrices Q and Z of generalized Schur vectors are
            updated.

                   Q(in) * A(in) * Z(in)**T = Q(out) * A(out) * Z(out)**T
                   Q(in) * B(in) * Z(in)**T = Q(out) * B(out) * Z(out)**T

                     ILST is INTEGER
                     Specify the reordering of the diagonal blocks of (A, B).

                     sequence of swapping between adjacent blocks.
                     On exit, if IFST pointed on entry to the second row of

                     ILST always points to the first row of the block in its
                     final position (which may differ from its input value by
                     +1 or -1). 1 &lt;= IFST, ILST &lt;= N.

           <u>WORK</u>

                     WORK is REAL array, dimension (MAX(1,LWORK))
                     On exit, if INFO = 0, <a href="../man1/WORK.1.html">WORK</a>(1) returns the optimal LWORK.

           <u>LWORK</u>

                     If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine
                     only calculates the optimal size of the WORK array, returns
                     this value as the first entry of the WORK array, and no error
                     message related to LWORK is issued by XERBLA.

           <u>INFO</u>

                     INFO is INTEGER
                      =0:  successful exit.
                      &lt;0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value.
                      =1:  The transformed matrix pair (A, B) would be too far
                           from generalized Schur form; the problem is ill-
                           conditioned. (A, B) may have been partially reordered,
                           and ILST points to the first row of the current
                           position of the block being moved.
