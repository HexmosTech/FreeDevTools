       <b>ZPOTRF</b> VARIANT: right looking block version of the algorithm, calling Level 3 BLAS. <b>ZPOTRF</b> VARIANT: top-
       looking block version of the algorithm, calling Level 3 BLAS.

       <b>Purpose:</b>

        ZPOTRF computes the Cholesky factorization of a real Hermitian
        positive definite matrix A.

        The factorization has the form
           A = U**H * U,  if UPLO = 'U', or
           A = L  * L**H,  if UPLO = 'L',
        where U is an upper triangular matrix and L is lower triangular.

        This is the right looking block version of the algorithm, calling Level 3 BLAS.

       <b>Parameters</b>

                     UPLO is CHARACTER*1
                     = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored;
                     = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored.

           <u>N</u>

                     N is INTEGER
                     The order of the matrix A.  N &gt;= 0.

           <u>A</u>

                     A is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDA,N)
                     On entry, the Hermitian matrix A.  If UPLO = 'U', the leading
                     N-by-N upper triangular part of A contains the upper
                     triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly lower
                     triangular part of A is not referenced.  If UPLO = 'L', the
                     leading N-by-N lower triangular part of A contains the lower
                     triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly upper
                     triangular part of A is not referenced.

                     On exit, if INFO = 0, the factor U or L from the Cholesky
                     factorization A = U**H*U or A = L*L**H.

           <u>LDA</u>

                     LDA is INTEGER
                     The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA &gt;= max(1,N).

           <u>INFO</u>

                     INFO is INTEGER
                     = 0:  successful exit

                     &gt; 0:  if INFO = i, the leading minor of order i is not
                           positive definite, and the factorization could not be
                           completed.

       <b>Purpose:</b>

        ZPOTRF computes the Cholesky factorization of a real symmetric
        positive definite matrix A.

        The factorization has the form
           A = U**H * U,  if UPLO = 'U', or
           A = L  * L**H,  if UPLO = 'L',
        where U is an upper triangular matrix and L is lower triangular.

        This is the top-looking block version of the algorithm, calling Level 3 BLAS.

           <u>A</u>

                     A is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDA,N)
                     On entry, the symmetric matrix A.  If UPLO = 'U', the leading
                     N-by-N upper triangular part of A contains the upper
                     triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly lower
                     triangular part of A is not referenced.  If UPLO = 'L', the
                     leading N-by-N lower triangular part of A contains the lower
                     triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly upper

                     On exit, if INFO = 0, the factor U or L from the Cholesky
                     factorization A = U**H*U or A = L*L**H.

                           positive definite, and the factorization could not be
