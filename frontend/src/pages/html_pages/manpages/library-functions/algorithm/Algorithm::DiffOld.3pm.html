</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Algorithm::DiffOld - Compute `intelligent' differences between two files / lists but use the old (&lt;=0.59)
       interface.

</pre><h4><b>NOTE</b></h4><pre>
       This has been provided as part of the Algorithm::Diff package by Ned Konz.  This particular module is
       <b>ONLY</b> for people who <b>HAVE</b> to have the old interface, which uses a comparison function rather than a key
       generating function.

       Because each of the lines in one array have to be compared with each of the lines in the other array,
       this does M*N comparisons. This can be very slow. I clocked it at taking 18 times as long as the stock
       version of Algorithm::Diff for a 4000-line file. It will get worse quadratically as array sizes increase.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Algorithm::DiffOld qw(diff LCS traverse_sequences);

         @lcs    = LCS( \@seq1, \@seq2, $comparison_function );

         $lcsref = LCS( \@seq1, \@seq2, $comparison_function );

         @diffs = diff( \@seq1, \@seq2, $comparison_function );

         traverse_sequences( \@seq1, \@seq2,
                            { MATCH =&gt; $callback,
                              DISCARD_A =&gt; $callback,
                              DISCARD_B =&gt; $callback,
                            },
                            $comparison_function );

</pre><h4><b>COMPARISON</b> <b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Each of the main routines should be passed a comparison function. If you aren't passing one in, <b>use</b>
       <b>Algorithm::Diff</b> <b>instead</b>.

       These functions should return a true value when two items should compare as equal.

       For instance,

         @lcs    = LCS( \@seq1, \@seq2, sub { my ($a, $b) = @_; $a eq $b } );

       but if that is all you're doing with your comparison function, just use Algorithm::Diff and let it do
       this (this is its default).

       Or:

         sub someFunkyComparisonFunction
         {
               my ($a, $b) = @_;
               $a =~ m{$b};
         }

         @diffs = diff( \@lines, \@patterns, \&amp;someFunkyComparisonFunction );

       which would allow you to diff an array @lines which consists of text lines with an array @patterns which
       consists of regular expressions.

       This is actually the reason I wrote this version -- there is no way to do this with a key generation
       function as in the stock Algorithm::Diff.
