       <b>CGEQRF</b> VARIANT: left-looking Level 3 BLAS version of the algorithm. <b>Purpose:</b>

        CGEQRF computes a QR factorization of a real M-by-N matrix A:
        A = Q * R.

        This is the left-looking Level 3 BLAS version of the algorithm.

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>M</u>

                     M is INTEGER
                     The number of rows of the matrix A.  M &gt;= 0.

           <u>N</u>

                     N is INTEGER
                     The number of columns of the matrix A.  N &gt;= 0.

           <u>A</u>

                     A is COMPLEX array, dimension (LDA,N)
                     On entry, the M-by-N matrix A.
                     On exit, the elements on and above the diagonal of the array
                     contain the min(M,N)-by-N upper trapezoidal matrix R (R is
                     upper triangular if m &gt;= n); the elements below the diagonal,
                     with the array TAU, represent the orthogonal matrix Q as a
                     product of min(m,n) elementary reflectors (see Further
                     Details).

           <u>LDA</u>

                     LDA is INTEGER
                     The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA &gt;= max(1,M).

           <u>TAU</u>

                     TAU is COMPLEX array, dimension (min(M,N))
                     The scalar factors of the elementary reflectors (see Further
                     Details).

           <u>WORK</u>

                     WORK is COMPLEX array, dimension (MAX(1,LWORK))
                     On exit, if INFO = 0, <a href="../man1/WORK.1.html">WORK</a>(1) returns the optimal LWORK.

           <u>LWORK</u>

                     LWORK is INTEGER

                     The dimension of the array WORK. The dimension can be divided into three parts.

                     1) The part for the triangular factor T. If the very last T is not bigger
                        than any of the rest, then this part is NB x ceiling(K/NB), otherwise,
                        NB x (K-NT), where K = min(M,N) and NT is the dimension of the very last T

                     2) The part for the very last T when T is bigger than any of the rest T.
                        The size of this part is NT x NT, where NT = K - ceiling ((K-NX)/NB) x NB,
                        where K = min(M,N), NX is calculated by
                              NX = MAX( 0, ILAENV( 3, 'CGEQRF', ' ', M, N, -1, -1 ) )

                     3) The part for dlarfb is of size max((N-M)*K, (N-M)*NB, K*NB, NB*NB)

                     So LWORK = part1 + part2 + part3

                     If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine
                     only calculates the optimal size of the WORK array, returns
                     this value as the first entry of the WORK array, and no error
                     message related to LWORK is issued by XERBLA.

           <u>INFO</u>

                     INFO is INTEGER
                     = 0:  successful exit
                     &lt; 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value

       <b>Further</b> <b>Details</b>

         The matrix Q is represented as a product of elementary reflectors

            Q = <a href="../man1/H.1.html">H</a>(1) <a href="../man2/H.2.html">H</a>(2) . . . H(k), where k = min(m,n).

         Each H(i) has the form

            H(i) = I - tau * v * v'

         where tau is a real scalar, and v is a real vector with
         v(1:i-1) = 0 and v(i) = 1; v(i+1:m) is stored on exit in A(i+1:m,i),
         and tau in TAU(i).

                     A = P*L*U; the unit diagonal elements of L are not stored.

       <b>Purpose:</b>

        CGETRF computes an LU factorization of a general M-by-N matrix A
        using partial pivoting with row interchanges.

        The factorization has the form
           A = P * L * U
        where P is a permutation matrix, L is lower triangular with unit
        diagonal elements (lower trapezoidal if m &gt; n), and U is upper
        triangular (upper trapezoidal if m &lt; n).

        This code implements an iterative version of Sivan Toledo's recursive
        LU algorithm[1].  For square matrices, this iterative versions should
        be within a factor of two of the optimum number of memory transfers.

        The pattern is as follows, with the large blocks of U being updated
        in one call to DTRSM, and the dotted lines denoting sections that
        have had all pending permutations applied:

         1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
        +-+-+---+-------+------
        | |1|   |       |

        | | | | | | | | |

        The 1-2-1-4-1-2-1-8-... pattern is the position of the last 1 bit in
        the binary expansion of the current column.  Each Schur update is
        applied as soon as the necessary portion of U is available.

                     LWORK is INTEGER

                     The dimension of the array WORK. The dimension can be divided into three parts.

                     1) The part for the triangular factor T. If the very last T is not bigger
                        than any of the rest, then this part is NB x ceiling(K/NB), otherwise,
                        NB x (K-NT), where K = min(M,N) and NT is the dimension of the very last T

                     2) The part for the very last T when T is bigger than any of the rest T.
                        The size of this part is NT x NT, where NT = K - ceiling ((K-NX)/NB) x NB,
                        where K = min(M,N), NX is calculated by

                     3) The part for dlarfb is of size max((N-M)*K, (N-M)*NB, K*NB, NB*NB)

                     So LWORK = part1 + part2 + part3

                     If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine

        The pattern is as follows, with the large blocks of U being updated
        in one call to DTRSM, and the dotted lines denoting sections that
        have had all pending permutations applied:

        using partial pivoting with row interchanges.

        The factorization has the form

        This code implements an iterative version of Sivan Toledo's recursive
        LU algorithm[1].  For square matrices, this iterative versions should
        be within a factor of two of the optimum number of memory transfers.

        The pattern is as follows, with the large blocks of U being updated
        in one call to STRSM, and the dotted lines denoting sections that
        have had all pending permutations applied:

         1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

        The 1-2-1-4-1-2-1-8-... pattern is the position of the last 1 bit in
        the binary expansion of the current column.  Each Schur update is

                     N is INTEGER
                     The number of columns of the matrix A.  N &gt;= 0.

           <u>A</u>

                     A is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDA,N)
                     On entry, the M-by-N matrix A.
                     On exit, the elements on and above the diagonal of the array
                     contain the min(M,N)-by-N upper trapezoidal matrix R (R is
                     upper triangular if m &gt;= n); the elements below the diagonal,
                     with the array TAU, represent the orthogonal matrix Q as a
                     product of min(m,n) elementary reflectors (see Further
                     Details).

           <u>LDA</u>

                     LDA is INTEGER
                     The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA &gt;= max(1,M).

                     The scalar factors of the elementary reflectors (see Further
                     Details).

           <u>WORK</u>

                     WORK is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (MAX(1,LWORK))
                     On exit, if INFO = 0, <a href="../man1/WORK.1.html">WORK</a>(1) returns the optimal LWORK.

           <u>LWORK</u>

                     LWORK is INTEGER

                     The dimension of the array WORK. The dimension can be divided into three parts.

                     1) The part for the triangular factor T. If the very last T is not bigger
                        than any of the rest, then this part is NB x ceiling(K/NB), otherwise,
                        NB x (K-NT), where K = min(M,N) and NT is the dimension of the very last T

                     2) The part for the very last T when T is bigger than any of the rest T.
                        The size of this part is NT x NT, where NT = K - ceiling ((K-NX)/NB) x NB,
                        where K = min(M,N), NX is calculated by
                              NX = MAX( 0, ILAENV( 3, 'ZGEQRF', ' ', M, N, -1, -1 ) )

                     3) The part for dlarfb is of size max((N-M)*K, (N-M)*NB, K*NB, NB*NB)

                     So LWORK = part1 + part2 + part3

                     If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine
                     only calculates the optimal size of the WORK array, returns
                     this value as the first entry of the WORK array, and no error
                     message related to LWORK is issued by XERBLA.

                     INFO is INTEGER

       <b>Purpose:</b>

        ZGETRF computes an LU factorization of a general M-by-N matrix A
        using partial pivoting with row interchanges.

        The factorization has the form
           A = P * L * U
        where P is a permutation matrix, L is lower triangular with unit
        diagonal elements (lower trapezoidal if m &gt; n), and U is upper
        triangular (upper trapezoidal if m &lt; n).

        This code implements an iterative version of Sivan Toledo's recursive
        LU algorithm[1].  For square matrices, this iterative versions should
        be within a factor of two of the optimum number of memory transfers.

        The pattern is as follows, with the large blocks of U being updated
        in one call to DTRSM, and the dotted lines denoting sections that
        have had all pending permutations applied:

         1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
        +-+-+---+-------+------
        | |1|   |       |
        |.+-+ 2 |       |
        | | |   |       |
        |.|.+-+-+   4   |
        | | | |1|       |
        | | |.+-+       |
        | | | | |       |
        |.|.|.|.+-+-+---+  8
        | | | | | |1|   |
        | | | | |.+-+ 2 |
        | | | | | | |   |
        | | | | |.|.+-+-+
        | | | | | | | |1|
        | | | | | | |.+-+
        | | | | | | | | |
        |.|.|.|.|.|.|.|.+-----
        | | | | | | | | |

        The 1-2-1-4-1-2-1-8-... pattern is the position of the last 1 bit in
        the binary expansion of the current column.  Each Schur update is
        applied as soon as the necessary portion of U is available.

       <b>Parameters</b>
           <u>M</u>

                     M is INTEGER
                     The number of rows of the matrix A.  M &gt;= 0.

           <u>N</u>

                     N is INTEGER
                     The number of columns of the matrix A.  N &gt;= 0.

           <u>A</u>

                     A is COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (LDA,N)
                     On entry, the M-by-N matrix to be factored.
                     On exit, the factors L and U from the factorization
                     A = P*L*U; the unit diagonal elements of L are not stored.

           <u>LDA</u>

                     LDA is INTEGER
                     The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA &gt;= max(1,M).

           <u>IPIV</u>

                     IPIV is INTEGER array, dimension (min(M,N))
                     The pivot indices; for 1 &lt;= i &lt;= min(M,N), row i of the
                     matrix was interchanged with row IPIV(i).

           <u>INFO</u>

                     INFO is INTEGER
                     = 0:  successful exit
                     &lt; 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
                     &gt; 0:  if INFO = i, U(i,i) is exactly zero. The factorization
                           has been completed, but the factor U is exactly
                           singular, and division by zero will occur if it is used
                           to solve a system of equations.
