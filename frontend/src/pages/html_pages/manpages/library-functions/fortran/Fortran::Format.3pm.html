       Fortran::Format - Read and write data according to a standard Fortran 77 FORMAT

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSYS</b></h4><pre>
           use Fortran::Format;

           my $f = Fortran::Format-&gt;new("2('N: ',I4,2X)");
           print $f-&gt;write(1 .. 10);
           # prints the following:
           # N:    1  N:    2
           # N:    3  N:    4
           # N:    5  N:    6
           # N:    7  N:    8
           # N:    9  N:   10

           # if you don't want to save the format object,
           # just chain the calls:
           Fortran::Format-&gt;new("2('N: ',I4,2X)")-&gt;write(1 .. 10);

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This is a Perl implementation of the Fortran 77 formatted input/output facility.  One possible use is for
       producing input files for old Fortran programs, making sure that their column-oriented records are
       rigorously correct. Fortran formats may also have some advantages over "printf" in some cases: it is very
       easy to output an array, reusing the format as needed; and the syntax for repeated columns is more
       concise. Unlike "printf", for good or ill, Fortran-formatted fields <b>never</b> exceed their desired width. For
       example, compare

           printf "%3d", 12345;                            # prints "12345"
           print Fortran::Format-&gt;new("I3")-&gt;<a href="../man12345/write.12345.html">write</a>(12345); # prints "***"

       This implementation was written in pure Perl, with portability and correctness in mind. It implements the
       full ANSI standard for Fortran 77 Formats (or at least it should). It was not written with speed in mind,
       so if you need to process millions of records it may not be what you need.

</pre><h4><b>FORMATS</b></h4><pre>
       What follows is a very brief summary of Fortran formats. For a rigorous description, see the ANSI
       standard. A format consists of a list of "edit descriptors" or sublists of edit descriptors. Edit
       descriptors are separated by commas, but the comma may be omitted if there's no ambiguity. Spaces and
       case are ignored, except within strings, so 'i 1 2' is the same as 'I12'.

   <b>Repeatable</b> <b>edit</b> <b>descriptors</b>
       The following edit descriptors may be repeated if they are preceded by a number; for example, '3I4' is
       the same as 'I4,I4,I4' or 'I4I4I4' or 'I4,2I4'. Lists can be nested by using parentheses, so '2(I2I3)' is
       the same as 'I2I3I2I3'. Most descriptors include a width <u>w</u>. If the width is larger than needed, the
       output is right-justified. If the width is not large enough, the entire field is filled with asterisks.

       I<u>w</u>
       I<u>w</u>.<u>m</u>
           An  integer  with  width <u>w</u>, and optionally a minimum number of digits <u>m</u> (adding zeroes on the left if
           needed).

       F<u>w</u>.<u>d</u>
           An fixed precision floating-point number with width <u>w</u>, and <u>d</u> digits after the decimal point.

       E<u>w</u>.<u>d</u>
       E<u>w</u>.<u>d</u>E<u>e</u>
       D<u>w</u>.<u>d</u>
           A number in exponential notation with width <u>w</u>, <u>d</u> digits after the decimal  point,  and  optionally  <u>e</u>
           digits after the exponent.

       G<u>w</u>.<u>d</u>
       G<u>w</u>.<u>d</u>E<u>e</u>
           For values between 0.1 and 10^<u>d</u>, format like <u>F</u>. For values outside that range, format like <u>E</u>.

       F<u>w</u>  Treat the variable as Boolean and output either <u>T</u> or <u>F</u> in a field of width <u>w</u>.

       A
       A<u>w</u>  Insert  a  string variable. If the width is not specified, it outputs the entire string. If the width
           is smaller than the string, the string is truncated (instead of filling with asterisks).

   <b>Non-repeatable</b> <b>edit</b> <b>descriptors</b>
       Most of the following descriptors don't output anything but  act  as  control  strings.  "Non-repeatable"
       descriptors can be repeated only by including them in a repeated list within parentheses.

       '<u>string</u>'
           Insert <u>string</u> as is. Quotes may be escaped by doubling them; for example, <u>'Joe''s'</u> produces <u>Joe's</u>.

       <u>n</u>H<u>string</u>...
           Insert The next <u>n</u> characters after the H as is.

       T<u>c</u>
       TL<u>c</u>
       TR<u>c</u> Move  to  position  <u>c</u> of the current record (T), or <u>c</u> characters to the left (TL), or <u>c</u> characters to
           the right (TR).

       <u>n</u>X  Move <u>n</u> characters to the right.

       /   Move to the beginning of the next record (the next line).

       :   Stop producing output immediately if there are no more variables left to format.

       S
       SP
       SS  Control whether the plus sign is included for positive numbers. Include it for SP, do not include  it
           for SS, and use the default (do not include) for S.

       <u>k</u>P  Scaling factor for output in exponential notation. By default, a number such as 1.23 would be written
           as  0.123E+01. When a scaling factor <u>k</u> is given, the decimal point is shifted <u>k</u> positions to the left
           and the exponent is decreased by <u>k</u> orders of magnitude. With 1P the output would be 1.23E+00.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       new
               my $format = Fortran::Format-&gt;new($format_string);

           Create a new format object. The string is parsed and compiled when the object is constructed.  Croaks
           if there is a syntax error.

       format
               my $format_string = $format-&gt;format;

           Returns the format string used by the object.

       write
               $output = $format-&gt;write(@data);

           Formats  the  data.  This is equivalent to the Fortran "WRITE" statement, except that it just returns
           the formatted string. It does not write directly to a file. Data items may be either scalar or  array
           references (which can be nested).

           For  matrices (multidimensional arrays), the contents are formatted in column-major order, same as in
           Fortran. For example,

               my $a = [[1,2],[3,4]];
               Fortran::Format-&gt;new('4I4')-&gt;write($a);

           will print

               1   3   2   4

           or

               Fortran::Format-&gt;new('2I4')-&gt;write($a);

           will print

               1   3
               2   4

           This is effectively equivalent to transposing the matrix before printing it in  the  row-major  order
           that  would  be expected by most non-Fortran programmers. This kludge is necessary to ensure that the
           output can be read properly by a Fortran program.

           <b>Note</b>: this is incompatible with Fortran::Format 0.5x,  which  simply  flattened  the  nested  arrays,
           producing the output in row-major order. Also note that the behavior is undefined if the nested array
           is not rectangular. For example, [[1],[2,3]] will give strange results.

       read
               my (@results) = $format-&gt;read($fh, @input_list);

           Read  data  from  the  filehandle  $fh  using  the  format  ($fh  can  also  be a string instead of a
           filehandle). The input list is a list of array sizes: 1 for simple scalars, <u>n</u> for simple arrays,  and
           an array reference of dimensions (such as [3,3]) for multidimensional arrays. For example,

               my ($i, $matrix, $j) = $format-&gt;read($fh, 1, [3,3], 2)

           will read one scalar, followed by a 3x3 matrix, followed by an array with size two. <b>Note</b>: this method
           should be called in list context!

           The  input list is needed because Fortran formats are reused automatically for subsequent lines until
           all the variables are read.

           Matrices are read in column-major order. See "write" for details.

           When reading, it is also possible to  specify  the  length  of  the  resulting  string  variables  by
           appending "A<u>length</u>". For example,

               my $s = $format-&gt;read($fh, '1A40')

           will  read  the  data <u>into</u> a 40-character long string variable (this is regardless of the field width
           specified in the format string itself). The string will be padded with trailing spaces if  needed  to
           ensure  that  it  is  exactly  40 characters long. This attempts to emulate Fortran's peculiar string
           length semantics. It is needed if you want to read a string, write it back, and be sure that you  get
           the exact same output that you would get with Fortran.

           For example,

               my $in = 'hello world';
               my $a5  = Fortran::Format-&gt;new('A5');
               my $a20 = Fortran::Format-&gt;new('A20');

               my ($s) = $a5-&gt;read($in, '1A10');

               print $a20-&gt;write($s);
               # prints "          hello     "

           Notice  that 1) $s was padded with five space, to a length of ten characters; 2) the output is right-
           justified to a total width of 20 characters.

           Now, if we do this instead:

               my ($s) = $a5-&gt;read($in, '1A3');
               print $a20-&gt;write($s);
               # prints "                 llo"

           Five character are read from the left of the string ("hello"),  but  only  the  rightmost  three  are
           copied to the 3-character-long variable ("llo").
