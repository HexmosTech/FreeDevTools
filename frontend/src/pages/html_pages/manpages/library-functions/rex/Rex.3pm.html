</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Rex - the friendly automation framework

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Rex is an automation framework that is friendly to any combinations of local and remote execution, push
       and pull style of management, or imperative and declarative approach.

       Its flexibility makes it a great fit for many different use cases, but most commonly Rex is used to
       automate application deployment and data center infrastructure management tasks.

       See Rex::Commands for a starting point of available built-in commands.

       See rex &lt;https://metacpan.org/pod/distribution/Rex/bin/rex&gt; for more information about how to use rex on
       the command line.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           # In a Rexfile:
           use Rex -feature =&gt; [qw/1.4/];

           user "root";
           password "ch4ngem3";

           desc "Show system information";
           task "sysinfo", sub {
              say run "uname -a";
           };

           1;

           # On the command line:
           $ rex -H server[01..10] sysinfo

</pre><h4><b>CLASS</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>get_current_connection</b>
       This function is deprecated since 0.28! See Rex::Commands::connection.

       Returns the current connection as a hashRef.

       server
           The server name

       ssh 1 if it is a ssh connection, 0 if not.

   <b>is_ssh</b>
       Returns 1 if the current connection is a ssh connection. 0 if not.

   <b>is_local</b>
       Returns 1 if the current connection is local. Otherwise 0.

   <b>is_sudo</b>
       Returns 1 if the current operation is executed within sudo.

   <b>get_sftp</b>
       Returns the sftp object for the current ssh connection.

   <b>connect</b>
       Use this function to create a connection if you use Rex as a library.

        use Rex;
        use Rex::Commands::Run;
        use Rex::Commands::Fs;

        Rex::connect(
          server    =&gt; "remotehost",
          user      =&gt; "root",
          password   =&gt; "f00b4r",
          private_key =&gt; "/path/to/private/key/file",
          public_key  =&gt; "/path/to/public/key/file",
        );

        if(is_file("/foo/bar")) {
          print "Do something...\n";
        }

        my $output = run("uptime");

</pre><h4><b>FEATURE</b> <b>FLAGS</b></h4><pre>
       Everyone  knows  the pain if something gets deprecated and one has to port his old (and stable) code to a
       new version of a library or a framework. There is enough work to do instead of fixing code to  work  with
       newer versions of them.

       So there is one promise new versions of Rex has to fulfill. They must be backward compatible.

       I  know  this  might  be  impossible  in one way or another, but to minimize this danger there is a thing
       called feature flags. If there is the need to break backward compatibility in  favor  of  a  new  feature
       there  will  be a feature flag for this change. And only if this feature flag gets enabled in the Rexfile
       it will break compatibility.

       So the default is always to remain compatible.

       If you have a problem that occurs after an update, it is considered as a bug. Please report this  bug  in
       our issue tracker.

       Also                   see                  the                  backwards                  compatibility
       &lt;https://metacpan.org/release/Rex/source/CONTRIBUTING.md#backwardscompatibility&gt;    section    of     the
       CONTRIBUTING guide.

   <b>How</b> <b>to</b> <b>enable</b> <b>feature</b> <b>flags</b>
       You can enable feature flags in your Rexfile with the following code:

           use Rex -feature =&gt; ['1.4'];

       or even multiple ones like this:

           use Rex -feature =&gt; [qw(1.4 exec_autodie)];
