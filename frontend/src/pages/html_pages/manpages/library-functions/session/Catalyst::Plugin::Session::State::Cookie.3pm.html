</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Catalyst::Plugin::Session::State::Cookie - Maintain session IDs using cookies.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Catalyst qw/Session Session::State::Cookie Session::Store::Foo/;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       In order for Catalyst::Plugin::Session to work the session ID needs to be stored on the client, and the
       session data needs to be stored on the server.

       This plugin stores the session ID on the client using the cookie mechanism.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       make_session_cookie
           Returns a hash reference with the default values for new cookies.

       update_session_cookie $hash_ref
           Sets the cookie based on "cookie_name" in the response object.

       calc_expiry
       calculate_session_cookie_expires
       cookie_is_rejecting
       delete_session_id
       extend_session_id
       get_session_cookie
       get_session_id
       set_session_id

</pre><h4><b>EXTENDED</b> <b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       prepare_cookies
           Will restore if an appropriate cookie is found.

       finalize_cookies
           Will set a cookie called "session" if it doesn't exist or if its value is not the current session id.

       setup_session
           Will set the "cookie_name" parameter to its default value if it isn't set.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       cookie_name
           The name of the cookie to store (defaults to "Catalyst::Utils::apprefix($c) . '_session'").

       cookie_domain
           The name of the domain to store in the cookie (defaults to current host)

       cookie_expires
           Number  of  seconds  from  now  you  want  to elapse before cookie will expire.  Set to 0 to create a
           session cookie, ie one which will die when the user's browser is shut down.

       cookie_secure
           If this attribute <b>set</b> <b>to</b> <b>0</b> the cookie will not have the secure flag.

           If this attribute <b>set</b> <b>to</b> <b>1</b> (or true for backward compatibility) - the cookie sent by  the  server  to
           the  client  will  get  the secure flag that tells the browser to send this cookie back to the server
           only via HTTPS.

           If this attribute <b>set</b> <b>to</b> <b>2</b> then the cookie will get the secure flag only if the request  that  caused
           cookie  generation  was  sent over https (this option is not good if you are mixing https and http in
           your application).

           Default value is 0.

       cookie_httponly
           If this attribute <b>set</b> <b>to</b> <b>0</b>, the cookie will not have HTTPOnly flag.

           If this attribute <b>set</b> <b>to</b> <b>1</b>, the cookie will  got  HTTPOnly  flag  that  should  prevent  client  side
           Javascript  accessing  the  cookie  value  -  this  makes  some  sort  of  session  hijacking attacks
           significantly harder. Unfortunately not  all  browsers  support  this  flag  (MSIE  6  SP1+,  Firefox
           3.0.0.6+, Opera 9.5+); if a browser is not aware of HTTPOnly the flag will be ignored.

           Default value is 1.

           Note1: Many people are confused by the name "HTTPOnly" - it <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> that this cookie works only
           over HTTP and not over HTTPS.

           Note2: This parameter requires Catalyst::Runtime 5.80005 otherwise is skipped.

       cookie_samesite
           This   attribute   configures   the   value   of   the   SameSite  &lt;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-
           US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Set-Cookie/SameSite&gt; flag.

           If set to None, the cookie will be sent when making cross origin requests, including following  links
           from other origins. This requires the "cookie_secure" flag to be set.

           If  set  to  Lax, the cookie will not be included when embedded in or fetched from other origins, but
           will be included when following cross origin links.

           If set to Strict, the cookie will not be included for any cross origin requests, including links from
           different origins.

           Default value is "Lax". This is the default modern browsers use.

           Note: This parameter requires Catalyst::Runtime 5.90125 otherwise is skipped.

       cookie_path
           The path of the request url where cookie should be baked.

       For example, you could stick this in MyApp.pm:

           __PACKAGE__-&gt;config( 'Plugin::Session' =&gt; {
               cookie_domain  =&gt; '.mydomain.com',
           });

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
       Sessions have to be created before the first write to be saved. For example:

           sub action : Local {
               my ( $self, $c ) = @_;
               $c-&gt;res-&gt;write("foo");
               $c-&gt;session( ... );
               ...
           }

       Will cause a session ID to not be set, because by the time a session is actually created the headers have
       already been sent to the client.
