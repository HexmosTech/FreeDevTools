       Session::Storage::Secure - Encrypted, expiring, compressed, serialized session data with integrity

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 1.000

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         my $store = Session::Storage::Secure-&gt;new(
           secret_key   =&gt; "your pass phrase here",
           default_duration =&gt; 86400 * 7,
         );

         my $encoded = $store-&gt;encode( $data, $expires );

         my $decoded = $store-&gt;decode( $encoded );

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module implements a secure way to encode session data.  It is primarily intended for storing session
       data in browser cookies, but could be used with other backend storage where security of stored session
       data is important.

       Features include:

       •   Data serialization and compression using Sereal

       •   Data encryption using AES with a unique derived key per encoded session

       •   Enforced expiration timestamp (optional)

       •   Integrity protected with a message authentication code (MAC)

       The   storage   protocol   used   in   this   module  is  based  heavily  on  A  Secure  Cookie  Protocol
       &lt;<a href="http://www.cse.msu.edu/~alexliu/publications/Cookie/Cookie_COMNET.pdf">http://www.cse.msu.edu/~alexliu/publications/Cookie/Cookie_COMNET.pdf</a>&gt; by  Alex  Liu  and  others.   Liu
       proposes a session cookie value as follows:

         user|expiration|E(data,k)|HMAC(user|expiration|data|ssl-key,k)

         where

           | denotes concatenation with a separator character
           E(p,q) is a symmetric encryption of p with key q
           HMAC(p,q) is a keyed message hash of p with key q
           k is HMAC(user|expiration, sk)
           sk is a secret key shared by all servers
           ssl-key is an SSL session key

       Because  SSL  session  keys  are  not  readily  available  (and  SSL  termination may happen prior to the
       application server), we omit "ssl-key".  This weakens protection against replay attacks  if  an  attacker
       can break the SSL session key and intercept messages.

       Using  "user"  and  "expiration"  to generate the encryption and MAC keys was a method proposed to ensure
       unique keys to defeat volume attacks against the secret key.  Rather than rely on  those  for  uniqueness
       (with the unfortunate side effect of revealing user names and prohibiting anonymous sessions), we replace
       "user" with a cryptographically-strong random salt value.

       The  original  proposal  also  calculates  a MAC based on unencrypted data.  We instead calculate the MAC
       based on the encrypted data.  This avoids an extra step decrypting invalid messages.  Because the salt is
       already encoded into the key, we omit it from the MAC input.

       Therefore, the session storage protocol used by this module is as follows:

         salt|expiration|E(data,k)|HMAC(expiration|E(data,k),k)

         where

           | denotes concatenation with a separator character
           E(p,q) is a symmetric encryption of p with key q
           HMAC(p,q) is a keyed message hash of p with key q
           k is HMAC(salt, sk)
           sk is a secret key shared by all servers

       The salt value is generated using Math::Random::ISAAC::XS, seeded from Crypt::URandom.

       The  HMAC  algorithm  is  "hmac_sha256"  from  Digest::SHA.   Encryption  is  done  by  Crypt::CBC  using
       Crypt::Rijndael  (AES).   The  ciphertext  and  MAC's in the cookie are Base64 encoded by MIME::Base64 by
       default.

       During session retrieval, if the MAC does not authenticate or if the expiration is set and in  the  past,
       the session will be discarded.

</pre><h4><b>ATTRIBUTES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>secret_key</b> <b>(required)</b>
       This  is  used to secure the session data.  The encryption and message authentication key is derived from
       this using a one-way function.  Changing it will invalidate all sessions.

   <b>default_duration</b>
       Number of seconds for which the session may be considered valid.  If an expiration  is  not  provided  to
       "encode",  this  is  used  instead to expire the session after a period of time.  It is unset by default,
       meaning that session expiration is not capped.

   <b>old_secrets</b>
       An optional array reference of strings containing old secret keys no longer used for encryption but still
       supported for decrypting session data.

   <b>separator</b>
       A character used to separate fields.  It defaults to "~".

   <b>sereal_encoder_options</b>
       A  hash  reference  with  constructor  arguments  for  Sereal::Encoder.  Defaults  to  "{  snappy  =&gt;  1,
       croak_on_bless =&gt; 1 }".

   <b>sereal_decoder_options</b>
       A  hash  reference  with  constructor  arguments for Sereal::Decoder. Defaults to "{ refuse_objects =&gt; 1,
       validate_utf8  =&gt; 1 }".

   <b>transport_encoder</b>
       A code reference to convert binary data elements (the encrypted data and the MAC) into  a  transport-safe
       form.  Defaults to MIME::Base64::encode_base64url.  The output must not include the "separator" attribute
       used to delimit fields.

   <b>transport_decoder</b>
       A  code reference to extract binary data (the encrypted data and the MAC) from a transport-safe form.  It
       must be the complement to "encode".  Defaults to MIME::Base64::decode_base64url.

   <b>protocol_version</b>
       An integer representing the protocol used by "Session::Storage::Secure".   Protocol  1  was  the  initial
       version, which used a now-deprecated mode of Crypt::CBC.  Protocol 2 is the current default.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>encode</b>
         my $string = $store-&gt;encode( $data, $expires );

       The  $data  argument should be a reference to a data structure.  By default, it must not contain objects.
       (See "Objects not stored by default" for rationale and alternatives.) If it is undefined, an  empty  hash
       reference will be encoded instead.

       The  optional $expires argument should be the session expiration time expressed as epoch seconds.  If the
       $expires time is in the past, the $data argument is cleared and an empty hash reference  is  encoded  and
       returned.   If  no $expires is given, then if the "default_duration" attribute is set, it will be used to
       calculate an expiration time.

       The method returns a string that securely encodes the session data.  All binary components are  protected
       via the "transport_encoder" attribute.

       An exception is thrown on any errors.

   <b>decode</b>
         my $data = $store-&gt;decode( $string );

       The $string argument must be the output of "encode".

       If the message integrity check fails or if expiration exists and is in the past, the method returns undef
       or an empty list (depending on context).

       An exception is thrown on any errors.

</pre><h4><b>LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Secret</b> <b>key</b>
       You must protect the secret key, of course.  Rekeying periodically would improve security.  Rekeying also
       invalidates  all  existing sessions unless the "old_secrets" attribute contains old encryption keys still
       used for decryption.  In a multi-node application, all nodes must share the same secret key.

   <b>Session</b> <b>size</b>
       If storing the encoded session in a cookie, keep in mind that cookies must fit within 4k, so don't  store
       too  much  data.   This module uses Sereal for serialization and enables the "snappy" compression option.
       Sereal plus Snappy appears to be one of the fastest and most  compact  serialization  options  for  Perl,
       according to the Sereal benchmarks &lt;https://github.com/Sereal/Sereal/wiki/Sereal-Comparison-Graphs&gt; page.

       However,  nothing  prevents  the  encoded  output  from  exceeding  4k.  Applications must check for this
       condition and handle it appropriately with an error or by splitting the value across multiple cookies.

   <b>Objects</b> <b>not</b> <b>stored</b> <b>by</b> <b>default</b>
       The default Sereal options  do  not  allow  storing  objects  because  object  deserialization  can  have
       undesirable   side  effects,  including  potentially  fatal  errors  if  a  class  is  not  available  at
       deserialization time or if internal class structures changed from when the session data was serialized to
       when it was deserialized.  Applications should take steps to deflate/inflate objects before storing  them
       in session data.

       Alternatively,  applications  can  change  "sereal_encoder_options" and "sereal_decoder_options" to allow
       object serialization or other object transformations and accept the risks of doing so.

</pre><h4><b>SECURITY</b></h4><pre>
       Storing encrypted session data within a browser cookie avoids latency and  overhead  of  backend  session
       storage, but has several additional security considerations.

   <b>Transport</b> <b>security</b>
       If  using  cookies  to  store  session  data,  an  attacker  could  intercept  cookies and replay them to
       impersonate a valid user regardless of encryption.  SSL encryption of the transport channel  is  strongly
       recommended.

   <b>Cookie</b> <b>replay</b>
       Because all session state is maintained in the session cookie, an attacker or malicious user could replay
       an  old  cookie  to  return  to a previous state.  Cookie-based sessions should not be used for recording
       incremental steps in a transaction or to record "negative rights".

       Because cookie expiration happens on the client-side, an attacker or malicious user could replay a cookie
       after  its  scheduled  expiration  date.   It  is  strongly  recommended  to  set  "cookie_duration"   or
       "default_duration" to limit the window of opportunity for such replay attacks.

   <b>Session</b> <b>authentication</b>
       A  compromised  secret  key  could  be  used  to  construct valid messages appearing to be from any user.
       Applications should take extra  steps  in  their  use  of  session  data  to  ensure  that  sessions  are
       authenticated to the user.

       One simple approach could be to store a hash of the user's hashed password in the session on login and to
       verify it on each request.

         # on login
         my $hashed_pw = bcrypt( $password, $salt );
         if ( $hashed_pw eq $hashed_pw_from_db ) {
           session user =&gt; $user;
           session auth =&gt; bcrypt( $hashed_pw, $salt ) );
         }

         # on each request
         if ( bcrypt( $hashed_pw_from_db, $salt ) ne session("auth") ) {
           context-&gt;destroy_session;
         }

       The downside of this is that if there is a read-only attack against the database (SQL injection or leaked
       backup  dump)  and  the secret key is compromised, then an attacker can forge a cookie to impersonate any
       user.

       A  more  secure  approach  suggested  by  Stephen  Murdoch  in   Hardened   Stateless   Session   Cookies
       &lt;<a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~sjm217/papers/protocols08cookies.pdf">http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~sjm217/papers/protocols08cookies.pdf</a>&gt;  is  to  store  an  iterated  hash of the
       hashed password in the database and use the hashed password itself within the session.

         # on login
         my $hashed_pw = bcrypt( $password, $salt );
         if ( bcrypt( $hashed_pw, $salt ) eq $double_hashed_pw_from_db ) {
           session user =&gt; $user;
           session auth =&gt; $hashed_pw;
         }

         # on each request
         if ( $double_hashed_pw_from_db ne bcrypt( session("auth"), $salt ) ) {
           context-&gt;destroy_session;
         }

       This latter approach means that even a compromise of the secret key and the database  contents  can't  be
       used  to  impersonate  a  user because doing so would requiring reversing a one-way hash to determine the
       correct authenticator to put into the forged cookie.

       Both methods require an additional database read per request. This diminishes  some  of  the  scalability
       benefits of storing session data in a cookie, but the read could be cached and there is still no database
       write needed to store session data.
