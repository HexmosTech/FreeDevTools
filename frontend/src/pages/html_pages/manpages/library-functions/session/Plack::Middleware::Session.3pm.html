</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Plack::Middleware::Session - Middleware for session management

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         use Plack::Builder;

         my $app = sub {
             my $env = shift;
             my $session = $env-&gt;{'psgix.session'};
             return [
                 200,
                 [ 'Content-Type' =&gt; 'text/plain' ],
                 [ "Hello, you've been here for ", $session-&gt;{counter}++, "th time!" ],
             ];
         };

         builder {
             enable 'Session';
             $app;
         };

         # Or, use the File store backend (great if you use multiprocess server)
         # For more options, see perldoc Plack::Session::Store::File
         builder {
             enable 'Session', store =&gt; 'File';
             $app;
         };

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This is a Plack Middleware component for session management. By default it will use cookies to keep
       session state and store data in memory. This distribution also comes with other state and store
       solutions. See perldoc for these backends how to use them.

       It should be noted that we store the current session as a hash reference in the "psgix.session" key
       inside the $env where you can access it as needed.

       <b>NOTE:</b> As of version 0.04 the session is stored in "psgix.session" instead of "plack.session".

   <b>State</b>
       Plack::Session::State
           This  will  maintain  session state by passing the session through the request params. It does not do
           this automatically though, you are responsible for passing the session param.

       Plack::Session::State::Cookie
           This will maintain session state using browser cookies.

   <b>Store</b>
       Plack::Session::Store
           This is your basic in-memory session data store. It is  volatile  storage  and  not  recommended  for
           multiprocessing environments. However it is very useful for development and testing.

       Plack::Session::Store::File
           This  will  persist  session  data in a file. By default it uses Storable but it can be configured to
           have a custom serializer and deserializer.

       Plack::Session::Store::Cache
           This will persist session data using the Cache interface.

       Plack::Session::Store::Null
           Sometimes you don't care about storing session data, in that case you can use this noop module.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following are options that can be passed to this module.

       <u>state</u>
           This is expected to be an instance of Plack::Session::State or an object  that  implements  the  same
           interface. If no option is provided the default Plack::Session::State::Cookie will be used.

       <u>store</u>
           This  is  expected  to  be an instance of Plack::Session::Store or an object that implements the same
           interface. If no option is provided the default Plack::Session::Store will be used.

           It should be noted that this default is an in-memory volatile store is only suitable for  development
           (or  single  process  servers).  For  a  more  robust  solution  see  Plack::Session::Store::File  or
           Plack::Session::Store::Cache.

</pre><h4><b>PLACK</b> <b>REQUEST</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       In addition to providing a "psgix.session" key in $env for persistent session  information,  this  module
       also  provides a "psgix.session.options" key which can be used to control the behavior of the module per-
       request.  The following sub-keys exist:

       <u>change_id</u>
           If set to a true value, forces the session identifier to change (rotate).  This should always be done
           after   logging   in,   to    prevent    session    fixation    attacks    from    subdomains;    see
           &lt;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_fixation">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_fixation</a>#Attacks_using_cross-subdomain_cooking&gt;

       <u>expire</u>
           If set to a true value, expunges the session from the store, and clears the state in the client.

       <u>no_store</u>
           If  set  to  a true value, no changes made to the session in this request will be saved to the store.
           Either "expire" and "change_id" take precedence over this, as both need to update the session store.

       <u>late_store</u>
           If set to a true value, the session will be saved at the <u>end</u> of the request, after all data has  been
           sent  to the client -- this may be required if streaming responses attempt to alter the session after
           the header has already been sent to the client.  Note, however, that it introduces  a  possible  race
           condition,  where  the  server attempts to store the updated session before the client makes the next
           request.  For redirects, or other responses on which the client needs do  minimal  processing  before
           making  a  second request, this race is quite possible to win -- causing the second request to obtain
           stale session data.

       <u>id</u>  This key contains the session identifier of the session.   It  should  be  considered  read-only;  to
           generate a new identifier, use "change_id".
