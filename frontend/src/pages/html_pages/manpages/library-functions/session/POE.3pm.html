</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       POE is a framework for cooperative, event driven multitasking and networking in Perl.  Other languages
       have similar frameworks.  Python has Twisted.  TCL has "the event loop".

       POE provides a unified interface for several other event loops, including <b>select()</b>, IO::Poll, Glib, Gtk,
       Tk, Wx, and Gtk2.  Many of these event loop interfaces were written by others, with the help of
       POE::Test::Loops.  They may be found on the CPAN.

       POE achieves its high degree of portability to different operating systems and Perl versions by being
       written entirely in Perl.  CPAN hosts optional XS modules for POE if speed is more desirable than
       portability.

       POE is designed in layers.  Each layer builds atop the lower level ones.  Programs are free to use POE at
       any level of abstraction, and different levels can be mixed and matched seamlessly within a single
       program.  Remember, though, that higher-level abstractions often require more resources than lower-level
       ones.  The conveniences they provide are not free.

       POE's bundled abstraction layers are the tip of a growing iceberg.  Sprocket, POE::Stage, and other CPAN
       distributions build upon this work.  You're encouraged to look around.

       No matter how high you go, though, it all boils down to calls to POE::Kernel.  So your down-to-earth code
       can easily cooperate with stratospheric systems.

   <b>Layer</b> <b>1:</b> <b>Kernel</b> <b>and</b> <b>Sessions</b>
       The lowest public layer is comprised of POE::Kernel, POE::Session, and other session types.

       POE::Kernel does most of the heavy lifting.  It provides a portable interface for filehandle activity
       detection, multiple alarms and other timers, signal handling, and other less-common features.

       POE::Session and derived classes encapsulate the notion of an event driven task.  They also customize
       event dispatch to a particular calling convention.  POE::NFA, for example, is more of a proper state
       machine.  The CPAN has several other kinds of sessions.

       Everything ultimately builds on these classes or the concepts they implement.  If you're short on time,
       the things to read besides this are POE::Kernel and POE::Session.

   <b>Layer</b> <b>2:</b> <b>Wheels,</b> <b>Filters,</b> <b>and</b> <b>Drivers</b>
       POE::Wheel objects are dynamic mix-ins for POE::Session instances. These "wheels" perform very common,
       generic tasks in a highly reusable and customizable way.  POE::Wheel::ReadWrite, for example, implements
       non-blocking buffered I/O.  Nearly everybody needs this, so why require people to reinvent it all the
       time?

       POE::Filter objects customize wheels in a modular way.  Filters act as I/O layers, turning raw streams
       into structured data, and serializing structures into something suitable for streams.  The CPAN also has
       several of these.

       Drivers are where the wheels meet the road.  In this case, the road is some type of file handle.  Drivers
       do the actual reading and writing in a standard way so wheels don't need to know the difference between
       <b>send()</b> and <b>syswrite()</b>.

       POE::Driver objects get relatively short shrift because very few are needed.  The most common driver,
       POE::Driver::SysRW is ubiquitous and also the default, so most people will never need to specify one.

   <b>Layer</b> <b>3:</b> <b>Components</b>
       POE::Component classes are essentially Perl classes that use POE to perform tasks in a non-blocking or
       cooperative way.  This is a very broad definition, and POE components are all over the abstraction map.

       Many components, such as POE::Component::Server::SMTP, encapsulate the generic details of an entire
       application.  Others perform rather narrow tasks, such as POE::Component::DirWatch::Object.

       POE components are often just plain Perl objects.  The previously mentioned
       POE::Component::DirWatch::Object uses Moose.  Other object and meta-object frameworks are compatible.

       Also of interest is POE::Component::Generic, which allows you to create a POE component from nearly any
       blocking module.

       There are quite a lot of components on the CPAN.
       &lt;<a href="http://search.cpan.org/search">http://search.cpan.org/search</a>?query=poe+component&amp;mode=all&gt;

   <b>Layer</b> <b>4</b> <b>and</b> <b>Beyond:</b> <b>Frameworks</b> <b>and</b> <b>Object</b> <b>Metaphors</b>
       It's possible to abstract POE entirely behind a different framework.  In fact we encourage people to
       write domain-specific abstractions that entirely hide POE if necessary.  The nice thing here is that even
       at these high levels of abstraction, things will continue to interoperate all the way down to layer 1.

       Two examples of ultra-high level abstraction are Sprocket, a networking framework that does its own
       thing, and POE::Stage, which is POE's creator's attempt to formalize and standardize POE components.

       It is also possible to communicate between POE processes.  This is called IKC, for <u>Inter-Kernel</u>
       <u>Communication</u>.  There are a few IKC components on the CPAN
       (&lt;<a href="http://search.cpan.org/search">http://search.cpan.org/search</a>?query=IKC&amp;mode=all&gt;), notably POE::Component::IKC and POE::TIKC.

   <b>Layer</b> <b>0:</b> <b>POE's</b> <b>Internals</b>
       POE's layered architecture continues below the surface.  POE's guts are broken into specific POE::Loop
       classes for each event loop it supports.  Internals are divided up by type, giving POE::Resource classes
       for Aliases, Controls, Events, Extrefs, FileHandles, SIDs, Sessions and Signals.

       POE::Kernel's APIs are extensible through POE::API mix-in classes.  Some brave souls have even published
       new APIs on CPAN, such as POE::API::Peek (which gives you access to some of the internal POE::Resource
       methods).

       By design, it's possible to implement new POE::Kernel guts by creating another POE::Resource class.  One
       can then expose the functionality with a new POE::API mix-in.

</pre><h4><b>DOCUMENTATION</b> <b>ROADMAP</b></h4><pre>
       You're reading the main POE documentation.  It's the general entry point to the world of POE.  You
       already know this, however, so let's talk about something more interesting.

   <b>Basic</b> <b>Features</b>
       POE's basic features are documented mainly in POE::Kernel and POE::Session.  Methods are documented in
       the classes that implement them.  Broader concepts are covered in the most appropriate class, and
       sometimes they are divided among classes that share in their implementation.

   <b>Basic</b> <b>Usage</b>
       Basic usage, even for POE.pm, is documented in POE::Kernel.  That's where most of POE's work is done, and
       POE.pm is little more than a class loader.

   <b>@_[KERNEL,</b> <b>HEAP,</b> <b>etc.]</b>
       Event handler calling conventions, that weird @_[KERNEL, HEAP] stuff, is documented in POE::Session.
       That's because POE::Session implements the calling convention, and other session types often do it
       differently.

   <b>Base</b> <b>Classes</b> <b>Document</b> <b>Common</b> <b>Features</b>
       The POE::Wheel, POE::Driver, POE::Filter, and POE::Component base classes describe what's common among
       each class.  It's a good idea to at least skim the base class documentation since the subclasses tend not
       to rehash the common things.

       POE::Queue, POE::Resource, and POE::Loop document the concepts and sometimes the standard interfaces
       behind multiple subclasses.  You're encouraged to have a look.

   <b>Helper</b> <b>Classes</b>
       POE includes some helper classes for portability.  POE::Pipe, and its subclasses POE::Pipe::OneWay and
       POE::Pipe::TwoWay are portable pipes.

   <b>Event</b> <b>Loop</b> <b>Bridges</b>
       POE::Loop documents and specifies the interface for all of POE's event loop bridges.  The individual
       classes may document specific details, but generally they adhere to the spec strongly enough that they
       don't need to.

       Many of the existing POE::Loop bridges provided in POE's base distribution will move out to separate
       distributions shortly.  The documentation will probably remain the same, however.

   <b>POE::Queue</b> <b>and</b> <b>POE::Queue::Array</b>
       POE's event queue is basically a priority heap implemented as an ordered array.  POE::Queue documents the
       standard interface for POE event queues, and POE::Queue::Array implements the ordered array queue.  Tony
       Cook has released POE::XS::Queue::Array, which is a drop-in C replacement for POE::Queue::Array.  You
       might give it a try if you need more performance.  POE's event queue is some of the hottest code in the
       system.

   <b>This</b> <b>Section</b> <b>Isn't</b> <b>Complete</b>
       Help organize the documentation.  Obviously we can't think of everything.  We're well aware of this and
       welcome audience participation.

   <b>See</b> <b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b>
       Wherever possible, the SEE ALSO section will cross-reference one module to related ones.

   <b>Don't</b> <b>Forget</b> <b>the</b> <b>Web</b>
       Finally, there are many POE resources on the web.  The CPAN contains a growing number of POE modules.
       &lt;<a href="http://poe.perl.org/">http://poe.perl.org/</a>&gt; hosts POE's wiki, which includes tutorials, an extensive set of examples,
       documentation, and more.  Plus it's a wiki, so you can trivially pitch in your two cents.

</pre><h4><b>SYSTEM</b> <b>REQUIREMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       POE's basic requirements are rather light.  Most are included with modern versions of Perl, and the rest
       (if any) should be generally portable by now.

       Time::HiRes is highly recommended, even for older Perls that don't include it.  POE will work without it,
       but alarms and other features will be much more accurate if it's included. POE::Kernel will use
       Time::HiRes automatically if it's available.

       POE::Filter::Reference needs a module to serialize data for transporting it across a network.  It will
       use Storable, FreezeThaw, YAML, or some other package with <b>freeze()</b> and <b>thaw()</b> methods.  It can also use
       Compress::Zlib to conserve bandwidth and reduce latency over slow links, but it's not required.

       If you want to write web servers, you'll need to install libwww-perl, which requires libnet.  This is a
       small world of modules that includes HTTP::Status, HTTP::Request, HTTP::Date, and HTTP::Response.  They
       are generally good to have, and modern versions of Perl even include them.

       Programs that use POE::Wheel::Curses will of course require the Curses module, which in turn requires
       some sort of curses library.

       If you're using POE with Tk, you'll need Tk installed.

       And other obvious things.  Let us know if we've overlooked a non-obvious detail.

</pre><h4><b>COMPATIBILITY</b> <b>ISSUES</b></h4><pre>
       One of POE's design goals is to be as portable as possible.  That's why it's written in "Plain Perl".  XS
       versions of POE modules are available as third-party distributions.  Parts of POE that require
       nonstandard libraries are optional, and not having those libraries should not prevent POE from
       installing.

       Despite Chris Williams' efforts, we can't test POE everywhere.  Please see the GETTING HELP section if
       you run into a problem.

       POE is expected to work on most forms of UNIX, including FreeBSD, MacOS X, Linux, Solaris.  Maybe even
       AIX and QNX, but we're not sure.

       POE is also tested on Windows XP, using the latest version of ActiveState, Strawberry and Cygwin Perl.
       POE is fully supported with Strawberry Perl, as it's included in the Strawberry distribution.

       OS/2 and MacOS 9 have been reported to work in the past, but nobody seems to be testing there anymore.
       Reports and patches are still welcome.

       Past versions of POE have been tested with Perl versions as far back as 5.6.2 and as recent as "blead",
       today's development build.  We can no longer guarantee each release will work everywhere, but we will be
       happy to work with you if you need special support for a really old system. You can always use older POE
       releases that works on your version, please check BackPAN
       &lt;<a href="http://backpan.perl.org/authors/id/R/RC/RCAPUTO/">http://backpan.perl.org/authors/id/R/RC/RCAPUTO/</a>&gt;.

       POE's quality is due in large part to the fine work of Chris Williams and the other CPAN testers.  They
       have dedicated resources towards ensuring CPAN distributions pass their own tests, and we watch their
       reports religiously.  You can, too.  The latest POE test reports can be found at
       &lt;<a href="http://cpantesters.org/distro/P/POE.html">http://cpantesters.org/distro/P/POE.html</a>&gt;.

       Thanks also go out to Benjamin Smith and the 2006 Google Summer of Code.  Ben was awarded a grant to
       improve POE's test suite, which he did admirably.

   <b>Windows</b> <b>Issues</b>
       POE seems to work very nicely with Perl compiled for Cygwin.  If you must use ActiveState Perl, please
       use the absolute latest version.  ActiveState Perl's compatibility fluctuates from one build to another,
       so we tend not to support older releases.

       Windows and ActiveState Perl are considered an esoteric platform due to the complex interactions between
       various versions.  POE therefore relies on user feedback and support here.

       A number of people have helped bring POE's Windows support this far, through contributions of time,
       patches, and other resources.  Some of them are: Sean Puckett, Douglas Couch, Andrew Chen, Uhlarik
       Ondoej, Nick Williams, and Chris Williams (no relation).

   <b>Linux/Unix</b> <b>Issues</b>
       <u>pty</u> <u>woes</u>

       Some distributions chose to not completely setup the pseudo-tty support. This is needed for
       POE::Wheel::Run to interact with the subprocess. If you see something like this while running "make test"
       please look at your distribution's documentation on how to fix it. For example, on Debian-based systems
       the solution was to execute "sudo apt-get install udev".

         t/30_loops/io_poll/wheel_run.t ..................... 1/99
         pty_allocate(nonfatal): posix_openpt(): No such file or directory at /usr/local/lib/perl/5.10.0/IO/Pty.pm line 24.

         Jeffrey  Goff  is  &lt;<a href="mailto:jgoff@blackboard.com">jgoff@blackboard.com</a>&gt;.   Jeffrey  is the author of several POE modules, including a
         tokenizing filter and a component for managing user information, PoCo::UserBase.  He's  also  co-author
         of "A Beginner's Introduction to POE" at www.perl.com.

       Philip Gwyn
         Philip  Gwyn is &lt;<a href="mailto:gwynp@artware.qc.ca">gwynp@artware.qc.ca</a>&gt;.  He extended the Wheels I/O abstraction to support hot-swappable
         filters, and he eventually convinced Rocco that unique session and kernel IDs were a good thing.

         Philip also enhanced POE::Filter::Reference to support different serialization methods.   He  has  also
         improved  POE's  quality by finding and fixing several bugs.  He provided POE a much needed code review
         around version 0.06.

         Lately, Philip tracked down the race condition in signal handling and fixed it with the signal pipe.

       Arnar M. Hrafnkelsson
         Arnar is &lt;<a href="mailto:addi@umich.edu">addi@umich.edu</a>&gt;.  Addi tested POE  and  POE::Component::IRC  on  Windows,  finding  bugs  and
         testing  fixes.   He  appears throughout the Changes file.  He has also written "cpoe", which is a POE-
         like library for C.

       Dave Paris
         Dave Paris is &lt;<a href="mailto:dparis@w3works.com">dparis@w3works.com</a>&gt;.  Dave tested and benchmarked POE around version  0.05,  discovering
         some subtle (and not so subtle) timing problems.  The pre-forking server sample was his idea.  Versions
         0.06  and  later  scaled  to higher loads because of his work.  He has contributed a lot of testing and
         feedback, much of which is tagged in the Changes file as a-mused.  The man is scarily good  at  testing
         and troubleshooting.

       Dieter Pearcey
         Dieter  Pearcey  is &lt;<a href="mailto:dieter@bullfrog.perlhacker.org">dieter@bullfrog.perlhacker.org</a>&gt;.  He goes by several Japanese nicknames.  Dieter's
         current area of expertise is in Wheels and Filters.  He greatly  improved  POE::Wheel::FollowTail,  and
         his  Filter  contributions  include the basic Block filter, as well as Stackable, RecordBlock, Grep and
         Map.

       Plixer International
         Plixer International is at &lt;<a href="http://plixer.com/">http://plixer.com/</a>&gt;.  Their sponsorship has helped POE 1.300 and beyond  be
         significantly more robust using iThreads, especially when using <b>fork()</b> in Windows.

       Robert Seifer
         Robert Seifer is &lt;e-mail unknown&gt;.  He rotates IRC nicknames regularly.

         Robert  contributed  entirely  too much time, both his own and his computers, towards the detection and
         eradication of a memory corruption bug that POE tickled in earlier Perl versions.  In the end, his work
         produced a simple compile-time hack that worked around a problem relating to anonymous subs, scope  and
         @{} processing.

       Matt Sergeant
         Matt contributed "POE::Kernel::Poll", a more efficient way to watch multiple files than <b>select()</b>.  It's
         since been moved to POE::Loop::IO_Poll.

       Richard Soderberg
         Richard  Soderberg  is  &lt;<a href="mailto:poe@crystalflame.net">poe@crystalflame.net</a>&gt;, aka "coral".  Richard is a collaborator on several side
         projects involving POE.  His work provides valuable testing and feedback from a user's point of view.

       Dennis Taylor
         Dennis Taylor is &lt;<a href="mailto:dennis@funkplanet.com">dennis@funkplanet.com</a>&gt;.  Dennis has been testing, debugging and  patching  bits  here
         and  there,  such  as  Filter::Line  which  he  improved  by  leaps in 0.1102.  He's also the author of
         POE::Component::IRC, the widely popular POE-based successor to his wildly popular Net::IRC library.

       David Davis
         David Davis, aka Xantus is &lt;<a href="mailto:xantus@cpan.org">xantus@cpan.org</a>&gt;.  David contributed patches to the HTTPD filter, and added
         CALLER_STATE to POE::Session.  He is the author of Sprocket, a networking framework built on POE.

         and  he  has  more  thanks than he can count for all the people who have contributed.  POE would not be
