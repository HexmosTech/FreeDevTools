</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Catalyst::Plugin::Session::Store - Base class for session storage drivers.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           package Catalyst::Plugin::Session::Store::MyBackend;
           use base qw/Catalyst::Plugin::Session::Store/;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This class doesn't actually provide any functionality, but when the "Catalyst::Plugin::Session" module
       sets up it will check to see that "YourApp-&gt;isa("Catalyst::Plugin::Session::Store")". When you write a
       session storage plugin you should subclass this module for this reason. This documentation is intended
       for authors of session storage plugins, not for end users.

</pre><h4><b>WRITING</b> <b>STORE</b> <b>PLUGINS</b></h4><pre>
       All session storage plugins need to adhere to the following interface specification to work correctly:

   <b>Required</b> <b>Methods</b>
       get_session_data $key
       store_session_data $key, $data
           Retrieve or store session data by key.

           $data is currently either a hash reference (for most keys) or an integer value (for expires), but all
           value types should be supported.

           Keys  are  in the format "prefix:id", where "prefix" is "session", "expires", or "flash", and "id" is
           always the session ID. Plugins such as Catalyst::Plugin::Session::PerUser store  extensions  to  this
           format, such as "user:username".

           It  is  suggested  that the store should split on the colon and store the data more efficiently - the
           API should remain stable, with the possible addition of new prefixes in the future.

           For  example,  "Store::DBI"  maps  "expires:id"  a   column   of   "session:id"   by   special-casing
           "get_session_data"  and "store_session_data" for that key format, in order to ease the implementation
           of "delete_expired_sessions".

           The only assurance stores are required to make is that given

               $c-&gt;store_session_data( $x, $y );

           for any $x,

               $y == $c-&gt;get_session_data( $x )

           will hold.

       store_session_data ( $key, $data )
           Store a session whose KEY is the first parameter and data is the second parameter in storage.

           The second parameter is a hash reference, which should normally be serialized (and later deserialized
           by "get_session_data").

       delete_session_data ( $key )
           Delete the session whose KEY is the parameter.

       delete_expired_sessions
           This method is not called by any code at present, but may be called in  the  future,  as  part  of  a
           Catalyst-specific maintenance script.

           If  you are wrapping around a backend which manages its own auto expiry you can just give this method
           an empty body.

   <b>Error</b> <b>handling</b>
       All errors should be thrown using Catalyst::Exception. Return values are not checked, and are assumed  to
       be OK. Missing values are not errors.

   <b>Auto-Expiry</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Backend</b>
       Storage  plugins  are encouraged to use "$c-&gt;session_expires", "$c-&gt;config('Plugin::Session' =&gt; { expires
       =&gt; $val })", or the storage of the "expires:$sessionid" key to perform  more  efficient  expiration,  but
       only for the key prefixes "session", "flash" and "expires".

       If  the  backend chooses not to do so, Catalyst::Plugin::Session will detect expired sessions as they are
       retrieved and delete them if necessary.

       Note that session store that use this approach may leak disk space, since nothing will actively delete an
       expired session. The "delete_expired_sessions" method is there so that  regularly  scheduled  maintenance
       scripts can give your backend the opportunity to clean up.

   <b>Early</b> <b>Finalization</b>
       By  default  the  main  session  plugin  will  finalize  during  body finalization which ensures that all
       controller code related to the session has completed.  However some storage plugins may wish to  finalize
       earlier,  during  header  finalization.   For example a storage that saved state in a client cookie would
       wish    this.     If    a    storage    plugin    wants    to    finalize    early    it    should    set
       $c-&gt;_needs_early_session_finalization  to true.  Please note that if you do this in a storage plugin, you
       should warn users not to attempt to change or add session keys if you use a streaming or socket interface
       such as $c-&gt;res-&gt;write, $c-&gt;res-&gt;write_fh or $c-&gt;req-&gt;io_fh.
