</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       MasonX::Request::WithMultiSession - Multiple sub-sessions within one "parent" session

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         PerlSetVar  MasonRequestClass  MasonX::Request::WithMultiSession

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This module subclasses "MasonX::Request::WithApacheSession" in order to allow multiple "sub-sessions" to
       exist within one parent session.

       This can be quite useful for a web app where you want to allow the user to open multiple windows, each
       with a different session, but session ids are stored in a cookie.

       Like "MasonX::Request::WithApacheSession", sub-sessions are shared between a request and any subrequests
       it creates.

</pre><h4><b>METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       This class has an interface quite similar to that of "MasonX::Request::WithApacheSession".

       •   session

           The  primary  interface  to this class is through the "session()" method.  When this method is called
           without any parameters, the module looks for an existing sub-session specified by the sub-session  id
           argument  parameter  (which  can  be  in  a  query  string or POST).  This value can be overridden by
           explicitly passing a "sub_session_id" parameter.

           If this parameter is found, an existing sub-session is returned.  If this parameter is not  found,  a
           new sub-session is created.

           If  the  "session()"  method  is  called  as  "session(  clone =&gt; 1 )" then a new sub-session will be
           created, and its contents will be the same as that of the current sub-session.   This  is  a  shallow
           copy of the old session hash, so objects and references are shared between them.

           If "session( new =&gt; 1 )" is called, then a new, empty, sub-session is created.

           You can specify the main session id to use via the "session_id" parameter.

       •   sub_session_id

           This  method  returns the currently active sub-session's id.  Use this method to put this id into URL
           parameters, forms, etc. as needed.

           If given a "sub_session_id" parameter, it will set the current sub-session id.

       •   delete_sub_session

           By default, this simply defaults the current sub-session.  You can pass a "sub_session_id"  parameter
           to delete a specific session.

   <b>Parameters</b>
       This module takes two parameters besides those inherited from "MasonX::Request::WithApacheSession":

       •   multi_session_args_param / MultiSessionArgsParam

           This  parameter  can be used to specify which parameter contains the sub-session id.  By default, the
           module will look for a parameter called "sub_session_id".

       •   multi_session_expire / MultiSessionExpire

           This parameter specifies the number of seconds after a sub-session is accessed until  it  is  purged.
           If not specified, then sub-sessions are never purged.

           Sub-sessions expiration is checked when the request object goes out of scope.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       You will need to manually set the sub-session id argument parameter for each request.  The easiest way to
       do  this  is  to  make  sure  that  all  URLs  contain  the  sub-session id.  This can be done by using a
       "&lt;%filter&gt;" block in a top-level autohandler (although this won't catch redirects), or by making sure all
       URLs are generated by a single component/function.

</pre><h4><b>SUPPORT</b></h4><pre>
       Bug   reports   and   requests   for   help   should   be   sent   to   the   mason-users   list.     See
