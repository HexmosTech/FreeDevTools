</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Catalyst::Plugin::Session::Tutorial - Understanding and using sessions.

</pre><h4><b>ASSUMPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       This tutorial assumes that you are familiar with web applications in general and Catalyst specifically
       (up to models and configuration), and that you know what HTTP is.

</pre><h4><b>WHAT</b> <b>ARE</b> <b>SESSIONS</b></h4><pre>
       When users use a site, especially one that knows who they are (sites you log in to, sites which let you
       keep a shopping cart, etc.), the server preparing the content has to know that request X comes from
       client A while request Y comes from client B, so that each user gets the content meant for them.

       The problem is that HTTP is a stateless protocol. This means that every request is distinct, and even if
       it comes from the same client, it's difficult to know that.

       The way sessions are maintained between distinct requests is that the client says, for every request,
       "I'm client A" or "I'm client B".

       This piece of data that tells the server "I'm X" is called the session ID, and the threading of several
       requests together is called a session.

</pre><h4><b>HOW</b> <b>SESSIONS</b> <b>WORK</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Cookies</b>
       HTTP has a feature that lets this become easier, called cookies. A cookie is something the server asks
       the client to save somewhere, and resend every time a request is made.

       The way they work is that the server sends the "Set-Cookie" header, with a cookie name, a value, and some
       metadata (like when it expires, what paths it applies to, etc.). The client saves this.

       Then, on every subsequent request the client will send a "Cookie" header, with the cookie name and value.

   <b>Cookie</b> <b>Alternatives</b>
       Another way is to make sure that the session ID is repeated is to include it in every URI.

       This can be as either a part of the path, or as a query parameter.

       This technique has several issues which are discussed in "CAVEATS" in
       Catalyst::Plugin::Session::State::URI.

   <b>Server-Side</b> <b>Behavior</b>
       When the server receives the session ID it can then look this key up in a database of some sort. For
       example the database can contain a shopping cart's contents, user preferences, etc.

</pre><h4><b>USING</b> <b>SESSIONS</b></h4><pre>
       In Catalyst, the Catalyst::Plugin::Session plugin provides an API for convenient handling of session
       data. This API is based on the older, less flexible and less reliable
       Catalyst::Plugin::Session::FastMmap.

       The plugin is modular, and requires backend plugins to be used.

   <b>State</b> <b>Plugins</b>
       State plugins handle session ID persistence. For example Catalyst::Plugin::Session::State::Cookie creates
       a cookie with the session ID in it.

       These plugins will automatically set "$c-&gt;sessionid" at the beginning of the request, and automatically
       cause "$c-&gt;sessionid" to be saved by the client at the end of the request.

   <b>Store</b> <b>Plugins</b>
       The backend into which session data is stored is provided by these plugins. For example,
       Catalyst::Plugin::Session::Store::DBI uses a database table to store session data, while
       Catalyst::Plugin::Session::Store::FastMmap uses Cache::FastMmap.

   <b>Configuration</b>
       First you need to load the appropriate plugins into your Catalyst application:

           package MyApp;

           use Catalyst qw/
               Session
               Session::State::Cookie
               Session::Store::File
           /;

       This loads the session API, as well as the required backends of your choice.

       After the plugins are loaded they need to be configured. This is done according to
       "Configure_your_application" in Catalyst::Manual::Cookbook.

       Each backend plugin requires its own configuration options (with most plugins providing sensible
       defaults). The session API itself also has configurable options listed in "CONFIGURATION" in
       Catalyst::Plugin::Session.

       For the plugins above we don't need any configuration at all - they should work out of the box, but
       suppose we did want to change some things around, it'll look like this:

           MyApp-&gt;config( 'Plugin::Session' =&gt; {
               cookie_name =&gt; "my_fabulous_cookie",
               storage     =&gt; "/path/to/store_data_file",
           });

   <b>Usage</b>
       Now, let's say we have an online shop, and the user is adding an item to the shopping cart.

       Typically the item the user was viewing would have a form or link that adds the item to the cart.

       Suppose this link goes to "/cart/add/foo_baz/2", meaning that we want two units of the item "foo_baz" to
       be added to the cart.

       Our "add" action should look something like this:

           package MyApp::Controller::Cart;

           sub add : Local {
               my ( $self, $c, $item_id, $quantity ) = @_;
               $quantity ||= 1;

               if ( $c-&gt;model("Items")-&gt;item_exists($item_id) ) {
                   $c-&gt;session-&gt;{cart}{$item_id} += $quantity;
               } else {
                   die "No such item";
               }
           }

       The way this works is that "$c-&gt;session" always returns a hash reference to some data which is stored by
       the storage backend plugin. The hash reference returned always contains the same items that were in there
       at the end of the last request.

       All the mishmash described above is done automatically. First, the method looks to see if a session ID is
       set. This session ID will be set by the State plugin if appropriate, at the start of the request (e.g. by
       looking at the cookies sent by the client).

       If a session ID is set, the store will be asked to retrieve the session data for that specific session
       ID, and this is returned from "$c-&gt;session". This retrieval is cached, and will only happen once per
       request, if at all.

       If a session ID is not set, a new one is generated, a new anonymous hash is created and saved in the
       store with the session ID as the key, and the reference to the hash is returned.

       The action above takes this hash reference, and updates a nested hash within it, that counts quantity of
       each item as stored in the cart.

       Any cart-listing code can then look into the session data and use it to display the correct items, which
       will, of course, be remembered across requests.

       Here is an action some Template Toolkit example code that could be used to generate a cart listing:

           sub list_cart : Local {
               my ( $self, $c ) = @_;

               # get the cart data, that maps from item_id to quantity
               my $cart = $c-&gt;session-&gt;{cart} || {};

               # this is our abstract model in which items are stored
               my $storage = $c-&gt;model("Items");

               # map from item_id to item (an object or hash reference)
               my %items = map { $_ =&gt; $storage-&gt;get_item($_) } keys %$cart;

               # put the relevant info on the stash
               $c-&gt;stash-&gt;{cart}{items} = \%items;
               $c-&gt;stash-&gt;{cart}{quantity} = $cart;
           }

       And [a part of] the template it forwards to:

           &lt;table&gt;

               &lt;thead&gt;
                   &lt;tr&gt;
                       &lt;th&gt;Item&lt;/th&gt;
                       &lt;th&gt;Quantity&lt;/th&gt;
                       &lt;th&gt;Price&lt;/th&gt;
                       &lt;th&gt;remove&lt;/th&gt;
                   &lt;/tr&gt;
               &lt;/thead&gt;

               &lt;tbody&gt;
               [%# the table body lists all the items in the cart %]
               [% FOREACH item_id = cart.items.keys %]

                   [%# each item has its own row in the table %]

                   [% item = cart.items.$item_id %]
                   [% quantity = cart.quantity.$item_id %]

                   &lt;tr&gt;
                       &lt;td&gt;
                           [%# item.name is an attribute in the item
                             # object, as loaded from the store %]
                           [% item.name %]
                       &lt;/td&gt;

                       &lt;td&gt;
                           [%# supposedly this is part of a form where you
                             # can update the quantity %]
                           &lt;input type="text" name="[% item_id %]_quantity"
                               value="[% quantity %]" /&gt;
                       &lt;/td&gt;

                       &lt;td&gt; $ [% item.price * quantity %] &lt;/td&gt;

                       &lt;td&gt;
                           &lt;a href="[% c.uri_for('/cart/remove') %]/[% item_id %]"&gt;
                               &lt;img src="/static/trash_can.png" /&gt;
                           &lt;/a&gt;
                       &lt;/td&gt;
               [% END %]
               &lt;tbody&gt;

               &lt;tfoot&gt;
                   &lt;tr&gt;
                       &lt;td colspan="2"&gt; Total: &lt;/td&gt;
                       &lt;td&gt;
                           [%# calculate sum in this cell - too
                             # much headache for a tutorial ;-) %]
                       &lt;/td&gt;
                       &lt;td&gt;
                           &lt;a href="[% c.uri_for('/cart/empty') %]"&gt;Empty cart&lt;/a&gt;
                       &lt;/td&gt;
                   &lt;/tr&gt;
               &lt;/tfoot&gt;

           &lt;/table&gt;

       As you can see the way that items are added into "$c-&gt;session-&gt;{cart}" is pretty simple. Since
       "$c-&gt;session" is restored as necessary, and contains data from previous requests by the same client, the
       cart can be updated as the user navigates the site pretty transparently.

</pre><h4><b>SECURITY</b> <b>ISSUES</b></h4><pre>
       These issues all relate to how session data is managed, as described above.  These are not issues you
       should be concerned about in your application code, but are here for their educational value.

   <b>(Not)</b> <b>Trusting</b> <b>the</b> <b>Client</b>
       In order to avoid the overhead of server-side data storage, the session data can be included in the
       cookie itself.

       There are two problems with this:

       1.  The user can change the data.

       2.  Cookies have a 4 kilobyte size limit.

           The  size  limit  is  of no concern in this section, but data changing is. In the database scheme the
           data can be trusted, since the user can neither read nor write it. However, if the data is  delegated
           to  the user, then special measures have to be added for ensuring data integrity, and perhaps secrecy
           too.

           This can be implemented by encrypting and signing the cookie data, but this is a big headache.

   <b>Session</b> <b>Hijacking</b>
       What happens when client B says "I'm client A"?  Well, basically, the server buys it. There's no real way
       around it.

       The solution is to make "I'm client A" a difficult thing to say. This is why session IDs are  randomized.
       If they are properly randomized, session IDs are so hard to guess that they must be stolen instead.

       This is called session hijacking. There are several ways one might hijack another user's session.

       <u>Cross</u> <u>Site</u> <u>Scripting</u>

       One  is  by  using cross site scripting attacks to steal the cookie data. In community sites, where users
       can cause the server to display arbitrary HTML, they can use this to put JavaScript code on the server.

       If the server does not enforce a strict subset of tags that may be used, the  malicious  user  could  use
       this  code  to  steal the cookies (there is a JavaScript API that lets cookies be accessed, but this code
       has to be run on the same website that the cookie came from).

       <u>Social</u> <u>Engineering</u>

       By tricking a user into revealing a URI with session data embedded in it (when cookies are not used), the
       session ID can also be stolen.

       Also, a naive user could be tricked into showing the cookie data from the browser to a malicious user.
