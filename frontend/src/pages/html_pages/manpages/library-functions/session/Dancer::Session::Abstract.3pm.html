</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Dancer::Session::Abstract - abstract class for session engine

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 1.3521

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This virtual class describes how to build a session engine for Dancer. This is done in order to allow
       multiple session storage backends with a common interface.

       Any session engine must inherit from Dancer::Session::Abstract and implement the following abstract
       methods.

   <b>Configuration</b>
       These settings control how a session acts.

       <u>session_name</u>

       The default session name is "dancer_session". This can be set in your config file:

           setting session_name: "mydancer_session"

       <u>session_domain</u>

       Allows you to set the domain property on the cookie, which will override the default.  This is useful for
       setting the session cookie's domain to something like ".domain.com" so that the same cookie will be
       applicable and usable across subdomains of a base domain.

       <u>session_secure</u>

       The user's session id is stored in a cookie.  If true, this cookie will be made "secure" meaning it will
       only be served over https.

       <u>session_expires</u>

       When the session should expire.  The format is either the number of seconds in the future, or the human
       readable offset from "expires" in Dancer::Cookie.

       By default, there is no expiration.

       <u>session_is_http_only</u>

       This setting defaults to 1 and instructs the session cookie to be created with the "HttpOnly" option
       active, meaning that JavaScript will not be able to access to its value.

   <b>Abstract</b> <b>Methods</b>
       <b>retrieve($id)</b>
           Look for a session with the given id, return the session object if found, undef if not.

       <b>create()</b>
           Create a new session, return the session object.

       <b>flush()</b>
           Write the session object to the storage engine.

       <b>destroy()</b>
           Remove the current session object from the storage engine.

       <b>session_name</b> (optional)
           Returns a string with the name of cookie used for storing the session ID.

           You  should probably not override this; the user can control the cookie name using the "session_name"
           setting.

       <b>get_value($key)</b>
           Retrieves the value associated with the key.

       <b>set_value($key,</b> <b>$value)</b>
           Stores the value associated with the key.

   <b>Inherited</b> <b>Methods</b>
       The following methods are not supposed to be overloaded, they are generic  and  should  be  OK  for  each
       session engine.

       <b>build_id</b>
           Build a new uniq id.

       <b>read_session_id</b>
           Reads the session ID from the cookie, ensuring it's syntactically valid.

       <b>write_session_id</b>
           Write the current session id to the "dancer.session" cookie.

       <b>is_lazy</b>
           Default is false.  If true, session data will not be flushed after every modification and the session
           engine (or application) will need to ensure that a flush is called before the end of the request.

</pre><h4><b>SPEC</b></h4><pre>
       <b>role</b>
           A Dancer::Session object represents a session engine and should provide anything needed to manipulate
           a session, whatever its storing engine is.

       <b>id</b>  The  session  id will be written to a cookie, by default named "dancer.session", it is assumed that a
           client must accept cookies to be able to use a session-aware Dancer webapp. (The cookie name  can  be
           change using the "session_name" config setting.)

       <b>storage</b> <b>engine</b>
           When  the session engine is enabled, a <u>before</u> filter takes care to initialize the appropriate session
           engine (according to the setting "session").

           Then, the filter looks for a cookie named "dancer.session" (or whatever you've set the "session_name"
           setting to, if you've used it) in order to <u>retrieve</u> the current session object. If not found,  a  new
           session object is <u>created</u> and its id written to the cookie.

           Whenever  a  session  call  is  made  within  a route handler, the singleton representing the current
           session object is modified.

           A <u>flush</u> is made to the session object after every modification unless the  session  engine  overrides
           the "is_lazy" method to return true.
