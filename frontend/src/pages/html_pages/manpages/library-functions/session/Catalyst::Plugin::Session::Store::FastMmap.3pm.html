</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Catalyst::Plugin::Session::Store::FastMmap - FastMmap session storage backend.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           use Catalyst qw/Session Session::Store::FastMmap Session::State::Foo/;

           MyApp-&gt;config(
               'Plugin::Session' =&gt; {
                   expires =&gt; 3600,
                   storage =&gt; '/tmp/session'
               },
           );

           # ... in an action:
           $c-&gt;session-&gt;{foo} = 'bar'; # will be saved

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       "Catalyst::Plugin::Session::Store::FastMmap" is a fast session storage plugin for Catalyst that uses an
       mmap'ed file to act as a shared memory interprocess cache. It is based on Cache::FastMmap.

   <b>METHODS</b>
       get_session_data
       store_session_data
       delete_session_data
       delete_expired_sessions
           These are implementations of the required methods for a store. See Catalyst::Plugin::Session::Store.

       get_and_set_session_data
           This is the optional method for atomic write semantics. See Catalyst::Plugin::Session::AtomicWrite.

       setup_session
           Sets up the session cache file.

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
       Very loaded sites with lots of data in the session hash may have old sessions expired prematurely, due to
       the  LRU caching policy employed by Cache::FastMmap. To get around this you can increase the "cache_size"
       parameter, or switch session storage backends.  Cache::FastMmap defaults to around 5mb (89 * 64k).

       This is particularly inappropriate for use as a backend for e.g.  Catalyst::Plugin::Session::PerUser, for
       example.

       As Cache::FastMmap is not "thread-safe" (at least version 1.30 and before)  therefore  also  this  module
       does  not  work in multi-threaded environment.  It is "fork-safe", however keep in mind that on Win32 the
       perl "fork" call is implemented as an emulation via threads - that is the reason why you cannot use  this
       store    for    example    when    running    you   catalyst   application   on   Win32   platform   with
       Catalyst::Engine::HTTP::Prefork engine.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       These parameters are placed in the hash under the "Plugin::Session" key in the configuration hash.

       storage
           Specifies the file to be used for the sharing of session data. The default value will use  File::Spec
           to  find  the  default  tempdir, and use a file named "MyApp_session_data", where "MyApp" is replaced
           with the appname.

           Note that the file will be created with mode 0640, which means that it  will  only  be  writeable  by
           processes  running with the same uid as the process that creates the file.  If this may be a problem,
           for example if you may try to debug the program as one user and run it as another, specify a filename
           like "/tmp/session-$&gt;", which includes the UID of the process in the filename.

       init_file
       cache_size
       unlink_on_exit
           See the Cache::FastMmap documentation for the meaning of these keys. If these keys  are  not  present
           Cache::FastMmap's defaults will be used.
